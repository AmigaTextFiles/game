ATC is a program that simulates an air traffic regional control center.
You are the controller, and you direct the planes (up to 8 at a time) to
the airport.  You control the planes' heading, altitude and speed.  You
receive points for directing the planes correctly to the airport.  You
also have to contend with planes departing from the same airport, and
you have to make sure that the planes do not collide with each other.
You also have only a limited amount of time to get the plane to the
airport.  You receive fewer points for a late flight, and if a flight is
very late, it will run out of fuel and crash.  All program input is done
with the left mouse button.

INSTRUCTIONS:

To run ATC, type "ATC" from the CLI or click on its icon It will take a
few seconds for the program to load.  Once it has loaded, you will be
presented with the "Set Up" screen.  Here you have a few choices to
make:

ATC has three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and difficult.  The
differences between the levels are things like the amount of time the
flights are spaced apart and how quickly the planes respond to changes
in altitude or speed. 

ATC uses the Amiga's built-in speech facilities.  If you want to hear
the speech, select "Sound On"; otherwise select "Sound Off".  If you are
playing the difficult level, the speech facility can slow the game down
when many flights are in your airspace - especially when playing with
more than 20 total flights. 

To select levels or sound, you must first unselect the item which is
already selected - then select the new entry.  The defaults are "Easy"
and "Sound Off". 

The "Number of flights" button controls the game length and difficulty.
A game with 100 flights will last about an hour; 20 flights about 10
minutes.  Shorter games are usually easier to play - the action does not
get quite so fast and furious.  Be sure to press RETURN after changing
the number of flights. 

When you are satisfied with the set up, select the CONTINUE button.
Then the screen will change to purple, and after a few seconds, the
radar screen will appear and the game will begin. 

The object of the game is to direct incoming flights to the airport for
landing and to direct departing flights out of your airspace.  The
airport resides at the center of the green sweeping radar line.  Before
an aircraft can land, its heading must be 180, speed - 100, altitude -
500, and the distance must equal 0.  A successful departure is at 20000
and a speed of 400 when the aircraft leaves your airspace.  The game is
over when the last scheduled flight has either landed or left your
airspace. 

THE RADAR SCREEN

Flight Status Display

In the upper right hand corner of the screen is a blue rectangle in
which information about a selected flight appears.  When the program
first starts up, some of the information will be zeroes until a flight
is selected.  Here's a description of the data appearing in the blue
rectangle:

     Fl #:  - the flight number for the selected flight.  Also displayed
              is the "In" or "Out" indicator which shows if the flight
              is arriving or departing.  The flight number consists of
              two parts:  a 2 digit abbreviation for the airline name
              and a three digit number.  ATC has four airlines:
                  
                 BA - Beta Airlines
                 CO - Consolidated Airlines
                 IC - Intercontenential Airlines
                 NA - National Airlines
                   
     Stat:  - There are three possible statuses:
                
                 Normal    - everything's ok
                 Priority  - the flight is late     
                 Emergency - the flight is low on fuel
     
     Schd:  - This the scheduled arrival or departure time.  ATC always
              begins with an arriving flight scheduled to arrive by
              8:45 in the morning.  Note: flights enter your airspace
              approximately 45 minutes before their scheduled arrival
              time.  When the airport is particularly busy, some 
              flights may enter your airspace later.

     Dist:  - This is the flight's current distance from the airport.
              The flight can't land until the distance reads zero.

     Head:  - This is the flight's current heading.  There are eight 
              possible headings: 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315.
              To change the current heading, click on the up/down 
              arrows to the right of the display.  To land, a flight
              must have a heading of 180, that is, all landings must be
              to the south.  Also, all departures are to the south.
        
     Alt:   - This is the flight's current altitude.  There are six
              possible altitudes: 20000, 15000, 10000, 5000, 1000, 500.     
              To change the current altitude, click on the up/down 
              arrows to the right of the display.  To land, a flight
              must be at 500 feet.
      
     Spd:   - This is the flight's current speed.  There are four
              possible speeds: 100, 200, 300, 400. To change the current
              speed, click on the up/down arrows to the right of the 
              display.  To land, a flight must have a speed of 100.
     
     Fuel   - This is the current amount of fuel left.  If the amount
              goes under 50, the flight's status changes to "Emergency."
              IF the amount goes to zero, the flight crashes. 
        
Flight Schedule Display

Just under the Flight Status Display is a white box - the Flight
Schedule Display.  This box will display the arrival/departure time for
all flights.  To cycle through the flights, click on the up/down arrows
to the right of the box. 

Flight Message Display

Just under the Flight Schedule Display is a black box - the Flight
Message Display.  All messages from the aircraft to you will appear in
this box.  If speech is enabled, the messages appearing in this box will
also be reported verbally. 

TOD Display
  
This box displays the game's current time of day in hours and minutes.
You will notice that the game's time of day moves along quite a bit
faster than real time. 

Score Display

This box displays the current score.  The score is determined as
follows:

     On time landing   = 10 points
     Late landing      =  5 points
     Emergency landing =  2 points
     Crashes           =  0 points   

You also get points for getting a departing flight to 20000 feet and 400
knots when it leaves your airspace.  5 points for each. 

A perfect score for a game with 20 flights is 200; with 100, the perfect
score is 10,000. 

If an arriving flight leaves your airspace without landing, there is no
way to get back, and it will crash when it runs out of fuel. 

QUIT button

Clicking on this button at any time will end the game.  If you want to
play again click on the "AGAIN" button; otherwise, click on the "QUIT"
button.

PAUSE button

Clicking on this button will pause the game indefinitely.

The radar

Once a flight appears on the radar, you can select it by positioning the
mouse pointer over it and clicking the left button once.  The aircraft
appear as V-shaped objects and they are color-coded:

    white  = normal arriving flight
    yellow = currently selected flight
    gray   = departing flight
    green  = late flight
    red    = emergency flight (low on fuel)

ADDITIONAL NOTES

 - Flights at the same altitude and near each other will crash. 
 - At an altitude of 500 and a speed of 100, if the distance is 0, but
   the heading is not 180, the flight will crash.  
 - At medium and difficult levels, it will take an aircraft a few
   "game minutes" to reach its new speed or altitude.  You must wait
   for it to attain the new speed or altitude before you will be 
   allowed to select a new one.
 - The performance characteristics of the aircraft are simulated.  This
   may not be how they work in real life.  This is not FAA approved
   training material.  So, do not try this with real aircraft.
 - A departing flight always starts out at 1,000 feet with a speed of
   100.  An arriving flight entering the airport at an altitude will
   collide with the departing flight causing both flights to crash.

TROUBLE-SHOOTING

If the game locks up and you can't move the mouse cursor, the problem is
probably a lack of memory.  To remedy this, re-boot your machine and
avoid running any background tasks that take up memory.  A lot of
fragmented memory (an Amiga that has been turned on a long time with
many different programs having being run) can screw up almost any
program that requires blocks of contiguous memory.  If you have a
machine that only has a really small amount of memory (ex: 256K), then
this program may not run if anything else is also running.  One more
thing: make sure that the library files mentioned above are available in
the correct directory.  If not, ATC is guaranteed not to run.  If none
of the above seems to help, contact me at the addresses given below. 
Also if you have any suggestions for improvement, please let me know,
and I will consider installing them.
