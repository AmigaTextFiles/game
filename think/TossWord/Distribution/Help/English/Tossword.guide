I'm really surprised that you're reading this text. After recovering from
first shock I'd like to tell you, that:

English isn't my native language: long time ago I've made my first mistake being
born  in  Russia.  All  other mistakes may reside as possible mistypings in this
file and bugs in program (hope, not too many left untouched!). Anyway, don't  be
too strict!

Some words about obtaining the help information while  playing  TossWord.  There
are several ways to do it:

1. Press the "Help" key. You'll get into the root of this document.
2. Choose the neccessary menu item and while still holding right mouse button,
   press the "Help" key. You'll see what this particular menu does or relates to.
   If choosen item is ghosted, you'll be explained why.
3. Just leave the mouse pointer steady upon one of the @{" MUI " link MUI} windows. Sooner or
   later (depends upon your MUI settings) a bubble will appear with some brief
   explanation, what's under the pointer.
4. If all above mentioned doesn't help, then try to read all Russian newspapers.
   All the lacking information is already there :)

If some options are not working, and you're not a registered  user,  then  these
options are possibly @{" crippled " link Register }.

Please note, that TossWord's menus will not work while @{" seconds meter " link SecMeter} or
@{" time gauges " link TGauges} window is active.

@endnode
@node "General" "General info"

                                General info

There are too many shoot-em-ups in the streets and on displays, so  I  tried  to
write  something a little bit more intelligent (and more simple :). This program
was preliminary done for my own pleasure (pleasure = programming the Amiga), but
afterwards I decided to release it as @{" shareware " link Register}.

This is a crossword game. One or two humans play  against  each  other  and  the
Amiga.  You  have  to  put  the  nouns  of your  native (I hope) language on the
playfield and gather points for each letter in your word. Letters have different
"prices"  or "weights": more common letters are "lighter" than their rarely used
counterparts. Say, "A" in English is worth  1  point,  while  "K"  may  possibly
weight  10  points.  Prices  of  the letters may be calculated automaticaly (see
@{" Scanning " link Scan}).

In order to play with you as an opponent, Amiga sure must  know  some  words  of
your language. These words reside in a @{" dictionary " link Dictionary}. At the moment, 3
dictionaries are supplied: English (of course), Deutsch and Russian.  For  using
other  languages,  see @{" Localization " link Locale}. At startup time TossWord asks the name
of system's current language and uses it throughout the entire playing  session.
You  may  change  language  between  subsequent  launches  of Tossword, just use
Prefs/Locale to do that.

If it happens so, that Amiga doesn't know the word you've put on the  playfield,
then  she  may remember the new word and add it into the dictionary for current
language. Be sure, you're not mistaken and put  only  valid  words!  Words  with
mistakes may be put to special @{" antidictionary " link Blacklist}; Amiga won't let you to
use them while playing.

In this version of TossWord, size of the playfield is  calculated  automatically
and  depends  upon  the  resolution of your preferred screen; this may be cloned
Workbench screen or any other not less then 640в480. At  the  moment,  I  didn't
implement   screenmode  requester  (this  may  be  possibly  changed  in  future
releases), but you may explicitly specify neccessary screenmode in @{" Tooltypes " link Startup}.

The font sizes are always the same - 14В18 points for letters and 5В8 points for
letter  "weights";  that  means,  that  the  size of playfield is being entirely
determined by vertical  and  horizontal  resolution  of  screen.  For  Multiscan
Productivity  it may be 15в15, for DblPal -17в17, for something like CyberGraphX
1280в1024 - 34в34.

@endnode
@node "Requirements" "System needed"

                          System requirements

Initially, Tossword was written on A4000/040 with CyberVision64 and a lot of RAM
for  my  own  personal  use.  That  means,  I  didn't  care  a  lot about memory
consumption or pre-V39 compatibility. The idea to spread it came when  the  game
was already done, because my friends got nearly crazy playing it (so did I).

If you don't have an AGA Amiga, then you must set tooltype USE_BOBS to YES in
TossWord's icon, otherwise the letters you drag will be not shown correctly.

If you do not have a Multiscan monitor (or, generally speaking,  your  Workbench
is  something like 640*256), you will "enjoy" a full-flickering display, because
Tossword needs minimum 640*480 resolution. If I'll have a  reasonable  feedback,
then  non-flickering  screen for 640*256 resolution will be implemented (as well
as some other pretty things - see @{" ToDo " link ToDo}.

Hard disk is a must at the moment, although floppy installation is  theoreticaly
possible.  CPU should be at least 68020, Kickstart - 3.0. Cybervision64 graphics
card is welcome (other Workbench-emulating cards may work, but were not  tested;
program may explicitly use cybergraphics.library, if available). Required memory
is around 1.2 Mb. @{" MUI " link MUI} 3.1+ (╘ Stefan Stuntz) (V12+) and reqtools V38 (╘ Nico
Francois)  are  also  neccessary.  Both MUI and reqtools are not included in the
archive and are available from, say, Aminet.

Program may extensively use built-in speech synthesizer of the Amiga,  so  you'd
better  have translator.library V37+ and narrator.device, even though mysterious
Commodore (RIP!) people dropped built-in speech support  from  OS  2.1  onwards.
Anyway, speech is not absolutely needed to run TossWord, you'll only loose some
"flavour" of the game.

Russian users need Rusifier V39.1+ and rusgrammar.library  (any  version);  both
products  are  ╘  by me (Dmitry Mikhilov), They're not included in this archive.
Russian speech is available if both of them are used.

Tossword needs three fonts. First is used to  show  player's  letters  (possible
pitch is in the range of 14В18). Font with the same name, but less pitch is used
to show @{" zipped" link Zip} letters. The third font is used to  show  letter's
prices (pitch 5В8).

It will be better if these fonts will be proportional (rather then fixed width).
A  sample  font  TossWord.fony  is  included  in  this  package - it is actually
combination of pHelvetica.16 and Helvetica.7 (the latter is "rusified"), but  it
doesn't  matter,  because  only digits are used). You mave specify in icon's
@{" tooltype " link Startup} another suitable font instead of supplied one.

This program was written in C, compiled under SASC 6.56 and tested with Enforcer
and Mungwall. Hope it won't cut some wires on your motherboard.

For users of MagicCX 1.2: there is a bug in "Blanker/Blank on keystroke" option.
Because  of  it, when you do not switch on @{" USE_BOBS " link Startup} mode and press "Esc"
key while dragging a letter, the letter will be temporarily  "duplicated"  until
you press any mouse button or move mouse pointer. You'd better uncheck "Blank on
keystroke" in MagicCx preferences editor and use standard MouseBlanker commodity
instead.

@endnode
@node "Install" "Installation"

                              Installation

TossWord is installed by  standard  Commodore's  installer,  which  must  reside
somewhere  in  your  standard  paths. Installer will ask you where to create the
"TossWord" directory. All  the  neccessary  files  will  be  put  there,  except
Tossword.catalog  which  will go to appropriate place in your LOCALE: directory,
if needed.

Generally, the process of installation is rather self-explanatory and  there  is
not  too much to say about it.

@endnode
@node "Startup" "Tool types"

                            Tool types

TossWord may be started either from Workbench or from Shell. Possible tool types
are:

FONT

  The name of  standard  Amiga  font.  This  font  shouldn't  be  "rusified"  or
  "chinesed"  or  "gypsiated".  It  is  used  to show player's letters when your
  current language uses only standard Amiga fonts. Example:

                      FONT=Times.18

  The font of EXACTLY this size MUST exist in your system. Possible  size  range
  is  14В18  (inclusively).  This font is used when your current system language
  doesn't need any special character sets.

TINY_FONT

  The name of the font which is used to show letter's prices.  Only  digits  are
  used from this font. Example:

                   TINY_FONT=helvetica.7

  The font of EXACTLY this size MUST exist in your system. Possible  size  range
  is from 5 till 8 (inclusively).

RUSSIAN

  What can you do if you live in Russia or, say, Greece? Yes, you're  absolutely
  right - use special bilingual English-Russian or English-Greek character sets.
  If the name of your current system language is equal to this parameter's name,
  then specified font will be used instead of standard Amiga font. Example:

                      RUSSIAN=cyrillic.18

  The font of EXACTLY this size MUST exist in your system. Possible  size  range
  is  from  14  till  18 (inclusively). This font is used ONLY when your current
  system language needs special character sets. You may see the  exact  name  of
  your language with the help of "Prefs/Locale" program.

ZIP_FONTSIZE

  When you @{" zip " link Zip} letters, this is the new size of the font for displaying them.
  Font name is the  same  as  the  one  which  is  used  to  show  letters.  The
  corresponding size must be valid for choosen font. Example:

                     ZIP_FONTSIZE=11

MIDBUTTONZIP

  @{" (un)Zip " link Zip} a letter with middle mouse button. If this parameter isn't
  specified, then you the only way to (un)zip the letter is  to  press  "Z"  key
  ("Y" for Deutsch keyboard).

MOVE_ZIPPED=UP|DOWN

  This tooltype instructs TossWord to group zipped letters in the upper or
  lower part of player's bank respectively. If not specified, the zipped letters
  will remain on their initial places.

POPUP_SETTINGS=YES|NO

  Instructs Tossword to pop up settings window immediately at startup time.  You
  may  specify  player(s)  name(s) in settings window and start the game without
  extra delays.

SCREENMODEID

  If this parameter is not specified, then TossWord takes the  Workbench  screen
  as  an anchor when opening it's own screen. Otherwise, the DECIMAL screen mode
  identifier must follow it. Example:

              SCREENMODEID=233508

  In this case Multiscan Productivity screen will  be  opened.  For  DblPal  the
  value  should  be  692228.  You may use other modes, but remember that current
  version of TossWord needs at least 640*480 screen!

..._PLAYERS

  If you don't want to tell TossWord the names of human players each time you
  start the program, then specify one or two names after this identifier. It's
  better to show then to explain:

  ENGLISH_PLAYERS=Robert Plant,Jimmy Page

  Plant will be the "left" player and Page - "right" player

  RUSSIAN_PLAYERS=,Gorby

  Gorby will be the "right" player. No "left"  player  is  specified.  Note  the
  comma after equal sign - without it Gorby would be the "left" player.

USE_BOBS=YES|NO

  If you have non-AGA Amiga which is capable of displaying 64-coloured screens,
  then you must specify this tooltype in order to play TossWord - otherwise the
  letters you drag will be "cut" horizontally.

@endnode
@node "Dictionary" "Dictionary"

                                   Dictionary

The dictionary is used by Amiga  to  fight  against  Humans.  Dictionary  should
contain  only  NOUNS  in NOMINATIVE case. Nouns must be SINGULAR (except for the
cases when a particular noun doesn't can be only plural, i.e. "scissors"). Names
are  strictly  prohibited.  Avoid  the names of drugs (too many of them) and the
words which gentleman (even Russian) will never say.

At the moment, there are 2 dictionaries included: English and  Russian.  Russian
contains more than 20.000 words, and English - only 7000. Sorry, but I'm Russian
myself and it's hard for me to play in English :). If you're  a  native  English
speaking  person  AND  have some spare time, then please, have a look at English
dictionary after @{" exporting " link Export} it. I'm not  sure,  that  all  the words
there are correct and (even) all of them are nouns. If you'll correct dictionary
a  lot,  then  please,  delete the original one, start TossWord and @{" import " link Import}
corrected text back. I shall be very glad to hear that valid English  dictionary
exists  somewhere  and  will  immediately include it in new releases of TossWord
(especially, if it will grow from it's original size :).

You can't start game in particular language if the dictionary for this  language
contains  less  then  5000  words (20.000 words for Russian :). This feature was
implemented due to the fact, that some people, whose logic I fail to understand,
started to cut dictionaries in order to make game easier.

If it happens so, that after the computer's move you'll see that the word, which
Amiga  has put on the playfield is inadequate to be used in Tossword, then press
the "Del" key to delete this word from both the playfield  and  the  dictionary.
Amiga  will  make another move in this case. If more than a single word appeared
on the field due to Amiga's last move, then a listview will  appear  asking  you
about  the  words  you  do not like. You have to mark them and then click at the
window's close gadget (or press Esc). If none of the  words  were  marked,  then
nothing  will  happen  and  the game will proceed normally, otherwise all marked
words will be deleted from dictionary and Amiga will make new move.

Anyway, after massive enlarging of the dictionary (which may  take  place  after
@{" merging " link MergeVoc}, or after @{" text import " link Import}, you'd better check the
@{" new words list " link NewWordsList} to ensure that all the new words are correct and
may be safely used in TossWord. TossWord's dictionaries are freely distributable
by definition and @{" merging " link MergeVoc} them may improve Amiga's  playing facilities
tremendously.

If the dictionary was changed and you're going to quit TossWord, then  you  will
be  asked  whether  to  save  updated  dictionary  to disk or not. Sometimes the
dictionary may be automatically optimized by Tossword to consume less disk space
- in this case saving will take place without any requests.

You may explicitly @{" add new words " link MoreVoc} to dictionary any time you want, not
just by putting new words to the playfield. @{" Deleting " link  DelWord} and
@{" searching for words " link FindWord} is extremely easy too.

Moreover, you may always @{" export dictionary as text " link Export}, edit the resulting
plain ASCII file with your favourite text editor and then @{" import text " link Import} back
to dictionary.

@endnode
@node "MoreVoc" "Adding new words to dictionary"

                       Adding new words to dictionary

If you want to explicitly add some words to dictionary, then  use  this  option.
Generally,  new  words may be added during the game time (if the word you put on
the playfield doesn't exist in dictionary, then it will be added automatically).
As a strict rule, all words that you type are first searched in @{" antidictionary " link BlackList},
and if they're not found there, then in dictionary itself. If they are not found
in both cases, then they're included in the dictionary. When you play in Russian,
a special library function determines, whether particular word meets some general
requirements of Russian grammar and won't let it in if it doesn't.

If the word was included in the dictionary, then you  will  hear  the  "swallow"
sound  which  is  phonenic  synonym  to "ми" in this game; otherwise you'll hear
"reject" sound which is really hard to explain by text -  historicaly  first  it
was  "swallowing"  vice  versa  (socalled  "Technicolor Yawning") but for public
release of Tossword I've changed it to something more suitable  for  gentlemen's
ears.

The new words that you have input during the game can not be used in this game -
only from next games onwards

The input window is closed either by clicking on it's close gadget, or  pressing
the "Esc" key (or "Enter" key if the input string is empty).

@endnode
@node "DelWord" "Deleting words from the dictionary"

                        Deleting words from the dictionary

If you think that some word in the dictionary is not suitable for playing,  then
you  may  always  delete  it.  There is only one theoretical exception - if your
dictionary contains only one word. You have to type the neccessary word  in  the
little window and press "Enter". If this words exists in dictionary, you'll hear
the "OK" sound (see @{" Adding words "  link  MoreVoc}),  otherwise  -  "Reject"
sound. The word you delete is always added to @{" antidictionary " link BlackList}.

The input window is closed either by clicking on it's close gadget, or  pressing
the "Esc" key (or "Enter" key if the input string is empty).

@endnode
@node "FindWord" "Find a word in the dictionary"

                      Find a word in the dictionary

If you are not sure, whether a particular word is included  in  the  dictionary,
try  this  option.  Looking  for word makes sense only if your dictionary is big
enough (say, 5000 words or  more).  If  the  word  is  found,  you'll  hear  the
"OK" sound (see @{" Adding words " link MoreVoc}), otherwise - "reject" sound.

The input window is closed either by clicking on it's close gadget, or  pressing
the "Esc" key (or "Enter" key if the input string is empty).

@endnode
@node "BlackList" "Antidictionary"

                          Antidictionary

Antidictionary (or "trash" dictionary) contains the words  with  common  grammar
mistakes  and/or  words  which you can not put om the playfield (of course, only
SOME of these words :). TossWord will never permit you use these  words  in  the
game. Physically, antidictionary is the part of "normal" dictionary - that means
that both of them reside in the same file. When  some  words  are  deleted  from
dictionary,  they  are transferred automatically to antidictionary; well, if you
add some words to  antidictionary,  then  these  words  are  deleted  from  main
dictionary  (if  they  are  already there). All this simply means, that the same
word can never reside both in dictionary and antidictionary.

You   can   explicitly   add   word(s)   to   antidictionary   via   the    menu
"Antidictionary/Add  word",  just  type the neccessary word in the pop-up window
and press "Enter". If this word was successfully found, then you will  hear  the
"OK" sound (see @{" Adding words " link MoreVoc}), otherwise - "reject" sound.

You  may  always  have  a  look  at  contents  of   anti-dictionary   via   menu
"Antidictionary/Show".  In  order to delete a word from it, just double click on
the neccessary entry.

The input window is closed either by clicking on it's close gadget, or  pressing
the "Esc" key (or "Enter" key if the input string is empty).

@endnode
@node "Settings" "Settings"

                                Settings

The settings window of TossWord is much more @{" MUI " link MUI}-looking then other windows; you
can adjust it's view to your own personal needs using @{" MUI/Settings " link MuiSettings} menu.
Control facilities are divided into two main groups:

                     @{" Sound control   " link SoundParams}
                     @{" General control " link MainParams}

In addition, there are @{" Modem settings " Link Modem} and settings defining the behavior
of the program when it encounters new word that is not in dictionary. In this
case  the  word may be either accepted (and Amiga will tell you that the word
was "Quite unexpected" or something like that),  or  accepted/rejected  after
query, or simply rejected.

@endnode
@node "SoundParams" "Sound control"

                            Sound control

If the "Voice" radio buttons are not  "Off",  then  TossWord  will  use  Amiga's
built-in  speech  synthesizer.  In this case all other control elements of sound
group will determine, when, what and how will be said by the Amiga while playing
the  game.  If  the  "Comments" field is checked, then Amiga will pay particular
attention  when  human  didn't  see  a  valuable  word  and   lost   more   then
(approximately)  30  points  (well, not actually lost, but could win at least 30
points more then he (or she) actually did). If you're self confident enough  and
do  not  like  to  hear  the expressions of sorrow from a piece of silicon (btw,
human beings generally consist of several gallons of water  and  a  handfull  of
salt  - nothing personal, of course :), then either uncheck the "Comments" field
or decrease value of the slider from the right side of it. If you made a  really
nice move, Amiga will possibly praise you.

If the gadget "Who's turn" is checked, then Amiga will tell  the  name  of  each
player, who's turn to move. Otherwise, she will pronounce words that she puts on
the playfild.

Sliders "Pitch", "Rate" and "Volume" are self-explanatory. Press "Test" button
to hear the way Amiga speaks after adjusting them.

@endnode
@node "MainParams" "General control"

                          General control

This group is accessible only between games. Here you can define player's  names
and  conditions  of game termination, as well as the time you may spend thinking
on each separate move (only if you're a registered user). You can  also  specify
the  number  of  seconds  before  the  end  of  thinking time when
@{" seconds meter " link SecMeter} triggers.

The names of the players who played on your Amiga are always remembered in files
called  "Players.xxx"  (xxx  stands for current language - so, filename may look
like "Players.english") which reside in the same  directory  as  TossWord.  This
file  is always loaded at startup time, and all the names are put into two lists
- for "left" and for "right" players. There's no neccessity to type the names of
already  known  players - just double click on needed list entry. If the name is
not in the list, then type it in the input string gadget. At least  one  human's
name is mandatory to start game.

Player's name can always appear in @{" highscores " link HighScores} which may possibly
travel around the world together with TossWord's @{" dictionary " link Dictionary}. That's why
you have to put down at least your first and second name; second name will be  used
only in highscores. Please, input "Eric Clapton", not "Clapton Eric" (in case of
Elton John that doesn't matter). After you press "Enter", the name will be copied
to both name lists and first letters of all words will be capitalized.

if "MaxTime" gadget is marked, then the slider from the right side  of  it  will
determine the maximum time that a single game can last (see @{" time gauges " link TGauges}.

If "MaxPoints" gadget is marked, then the slider from the right side of it  will
determine the maximum points any player may get. If someone's result is equal or
more, then it's value, game will be terminated and winner announced.

@endnode
@node TGauges "Time gauges"

                         Time gauges

The three gauges in the upper right corner of the screen represent (from  up  to
down)  number  of  contiguous  passes,  overall  time remained and player's time
remained.

Note well, that if you have clicked on this window and it's  border  has  become
blue (the only sense to activate this window is to obtain bubble help), then all
TossWord's menus will be disabled until you click somewhere in the main field of
TossWord's window.


@endnode
@node SecMeter "Seconds meter"

                         Seconds meter

A little window in upper left corner contatins the "alarm seconds meter" which
triggers when certain defined in @{" general control " link MainParams} number of seconds
remains before player's thinking time will be expired.

Note well, that if you have clicked on this window and it's  border  has  become
blue (the only sense to activate this window is to obtain bubble help), then all
TossWord's menus will be disabled until you click somewhere in the main field of
TossWord's window.

@endnode
@node "MergeVoc" "Merge dictionaries"

                         Merge dictionaries

This option merges @{" dictionaries " link Dictionary} and @{" antidictionaries " link BlackList}, which were created
(modified) by other TossWord owners, with your dictionary and antidictionary.
@{" Highscore " link HighScores} table also gets merged. The words which are known in alien
dictionary, but not reside in your dictionary are added to @{" list of new words " link NewWordsList},
where you may have a look at them and possibly delete some of  them.  There  are
some peculiarities when merging:

1. If same words are in both dictionaries, then they are ignored.
2. If same words are in both antidictionaries, then they are ignored.
3. If same words are in new antidictionary and your dictionary, then they're
   deleted from dictionary and added to antidictionary.
4. If same words are in new dictionary and your antidictionary, then they
   are ignored.

Merging of highscores means, that if new names are good  enough  to  wedge  into
existing  table,  then  they  will  do  it. If the same player's name is in both
tables, then the program looks, how many games were played in both cases: if the
player  in  new  highscores  table  has  played  more games, then new entry will
replace the old entry. Highscores table never has more than 10 entries, so  some
loosers  may  be  possibly  "shifted  out".  Sure,  this  algorithm  is far from
perfection, but perfect algorithm neededs to  preserve  information  about  each
seperate  game, together with some unique ID's; in this case the highscore table
may possibly become rather memory-hungry. Anyway, this  may  be  implemented  in
future.

@node "Import" "Text import"

                          Text import

You may import a text file to add some words to TossWord's  @{" dictionary " link Dictionary}.
If the file is big enough (say, more then 500 words) you'd better use @{" cut " link Cut}
operation first, and only then import text.

Of course, this file must include only words  of  your  current  language  (that
means, these words shouldn't have any letters not included in the @{" 'Prices.xxx' file " link Scan}).

The words in imported file must also meet  general  requirements  of  TossWord's
usage (see @{" dictionary " link Dictionary}). Spaces and linefeeds are permitted. If an
asterisk is found in the first column of the line, then the  following  word  is
added to @{" antidictionary " link BlackList} instead of dictionary. Blank lines are ignored.
Here's an example of imported text file for English language:

elephant fly goldfish
parrot monkey
skyscraper
perestroika
* elefant
* perrot
* mankey

Same subtleties may occur during text import as during dictionary merging (see
@{" Merge " link MergeVoc} for details).

@endnode
@node Cut "Text cutting"

                         Text cutting

Suppose you've got a huge text file containing new words to be included in
TossWord's dictionary. You already have a dictionary of say, 10000 words and
want to @{" import " link Import} new ones. But some words in the text file may possibly
contain mistakes or simpy do not comply to TossWord's rules. Would it be nicer to
cut  all already known words from text file and view/edit the remaining words
using your favourite text editor, instead of rambling around with
@{" new words list " link NewWordsList} after importing the file?

Here the "Cut" option comes in. After specifying the name of text file the
words which are either already known or unacceptable to TossWord are deleted from
this file. Of course, a lot of unacceptable words may remain yet (hey, it's up to
you - human being - to make final decisions!). You may then edit the file with
your favourite text editor and @{" import " link Import} file after all.

@endnode
@node "Export" "Text export"

                                Text export

This option enables you to write the @{" dictionary " link Dictionary} and @{" antidictionary " link BlackList} contents as
a  pure  text  file.  Each  line  will  hold  exactly  one  word.   Words   from
antidictionary  will  be  preceded by asterisks. This text may be @{" imported " link Import}
back to Tossword after possible editing in your favourite  text  editor.  If  it
happened so, that  your  dictionary  contains  invalid  characters  for  current
language, then all these characters will be replaced by exclamation marks (it is
easy to find and correct them using your favourite text editor).

@endnode
@node "Check" "Validating the dictionary"

It may happen somehow that your dictionary gets corrupted. This may be caused by
some  crashed  or  misbehaving  task  running simulaneously with Tossword, or by
(yet) unknown bug in TossWord  itself.  That's  why  the  dictionary  is  always
checked when saving, loading, or @{" export " link Export} takes place. Please, keep a
backup copy of your dictionary in the safe place and refresh it periodically  to
be guaranteed from disasters.

@endnode
@node "NewWordsList" "List of new words"

                               List of new words

This list contains words which were learnt by TossWord since it's last launch.
There are 4 ways to add new words to dictionary and to this list:

1. While playing, put the word on the playfield.
2. Use the @{" Add new word " link MoreVoc} menu option.
3. @{" Merge " link MergeVoc} dictionaries.
4. @{" Import " link Import} some text.

If you wish to delete a word from this list (and from dictionary as well), just
double click on the unneeded word.

@node Game "The process of the game"

                           The process of the game

You can not start the game if at least one name  of  the  human  player  is  not
specified.  Use the @{" settings " link Settings} menu option in order to do it. First move
is done by randomly selected player. Red  arrows,  embracing  player's  letters,
indicate who's turn to move is.

In order to pick up a letter from your bank, just click on it. You'll see,  that
letter's  background  will become slightly darker. Since now, the choosen letter
will replace the mouse pointer. You may put it to three possible places:

1. To the playfield. Just move it to desired place and  click  once  again.  The
   letter wil be "dropped" and the normal mouse pointer will  be  restored.  You
   can drop letter only to the empty place on playfield!

2. If you move the letter from your bank towards the nearest vertical screen
   border, then the colour of letter's  background  will  suddenly  change  from
   white  to  yellow.  That means that letter is ready to go to trash. If you'll
   click when background of the letter is yellow, then the  letter  will  go  to
   trash.  This  is  usually done to change your letters when you can't find any
   suitable move (or any move at all). You can always  get  the  letter(s)  back
   from trash to your bank either pressing the "Esc" key, or putting a letter to
   the playfield; in leach case all  letters  gone  to  trash  will  immediately
   return to your bank.

3. Return letter to your bank. It is not neccessary to drag the letter back,
   though you may do it (it's often easier to press the "Esc"  key).  Sometimes,
   however, it's neccessary to return back several letters that you have already
   put on the playfield. In this case press "Esc" key  for  each  letter  to  be
   returned (it is not neccessary to wait until each letter will move back while
   pressing "Esc").

Before fixing your move, you may always pick up letters of newly formed word and
move them to some other places.

The words start either from leftmost or uppermost side (like in crosswords).

All the letters you have put on the playfield MUST meet these requirements:

a). Lay  in  one  line  (either horizontal  or  vertical). 
b). Touch each other or some letters which are already on the playfield.
c)  Form a @{" valid word " link Dictionary}.
d). The word must be readable either from left to right or from top to botton.
e). If it is not first move in the game, then you MUST use at least one letter
    which is already on the playfield and belongs to another word.
f). The word MUST be a singular noun in nominative case; it may be plural only
    if singular form doesn't exist (see  @{"  dictionary  " link Dictionary} for more details).
g)  If your word "touches"  some  other  existing  word(s)  in  either  vertical
    or horizontal direction(s), then new extra VALID words must be automatically
    created. Here's an example:

   Initial position        Position after your move

                                   L
                                   E
    POLICEMAN               POLICEMAN
            ACTOR                  FACTOR
            M                       M
            E                       E

Initially there are three words on the playfield: POLICEMAN, ACTOR and  NAME.
Then  you put the word "LEAF"; the side effect was that the word "factor" was
created. In this case you'll get points for both words: "leave" and "factor".
If extra words are formed, and one or more of them are unknown to Amiga, then
the requester will appear asking you to confirm that unknown  word(s)  really
exist(s).

It is not possible to put the word which is already on the  playfield;  however,
if the word became longer and disappeared, you may safely put it again:

    Pos. 1       Pos.2        Pos.3

                                M
    MOTOR      MOTORCYCLE    MOTORCYCLE
                                T
                                O
                                R

Remember, you  always  get  points  for  WHOLE  words,  in  which  your  letters
"participate".  In the example above when you added "CYCLE" to "MOTOR" in pos.2,
you've got points for all the letters in the word "MOTORCYCLE". After pos. 2 the
word  "MOTOR"  actually  disappeared  from  playfield  and you can safely put it
again without complaints from the Amiga.

Your task is to get more points, then other players manage to do. For words with
8  or more letters, initial price of the word is mutiplied by 2 for each "extra"
letter. That means, that word with 8 letters will have it's price doubled,  with
9 letters - multiplied by 3, with 10 letters - multiplied by 4 etc...

As it was already mentioned, after you finished putting the word  to  playfield,
you  have  to  fix  it by clicking on any empty square on the playfield (you may
press the "Space" key in order to do it as well). You will hear  the  door  bell
sound  and the turn will go either to computer or to the next player (on screen,
the turn of move is "rotating anticlockwise").

When Amiga makes it's move, she doesn't care,  whether  you  will  have  a  nice
opportunity to earn a lot of points due to the word she puts. The main target of
the game is to provide as many choices for you as possible - it's up to  you  to
use  all  of them in the most efficient way. The same time when you think of the
best word you can put, Amiga does it for you also and will always  compare  your
word  with  the word she expected. The result of such comparison is reflected in
the @{" table of highscores " link HighScores} in "Efficiency" column. The number in
this column is calculated in such way:

                     sum of all the points you really got
efficiency = -------------------------------------------------- * 100%
              sum of points Amiga could get having your letters

If it happens so, that Amiga is still calculating the best variant for you,  but
you're  ready  with  your word and fix it, then Amiga's thinking will be aborted
and the best variant she has found may not be actually the best. The  efficiency
of  your  move  in  this case will be higher, then "real" efficiency. So, try to
think quicker (or buy slower Amiga! :).

If speech is enabled, Amiga will always say "Exactly!" if you've put the word
she  expected.  Actually,  sometimes she says some other things - i.e. always
tells you when the word you've put is  unknown  for  her  (depends  upon  the
behaviour you've defined in @{" settings " link Settings}.

If you're interested, how many variants Amiga could use  if  she  were  on  your
place, press F1 or F2 key - the requester will appear telling you about it (when
you play in Russian and have Rusifier installed, Amiga will SAY  the  number  of
your  variants  if  you  press  F2).  Because  Amiga  thinks in "your time", her
thinking will be aborted when you "fix" your move.

If F1 or F2 is pressed while Amiga is thinking about your variants, you'll know
the number of variants calculated up to the time you've pressed F1 or F2. This
may be less than their final number.

It may happen so, that Amiga has put a word to the playfield, but you think this
word is not suitable and/or correct. In this case you must press "Del" key before
picking your letters and making your move. A requester will appear, asking you if
you really think that Amiga used an "outlaw" word. If you'll confirm, then this
word will be deleted from @{" dictionary " link Dictionary} and added to @{" antidictionary " link BlackList},
and Amiga will take back it's move and make another move instead.

If you want to keep some letters for future use in a very expensive word, then
you may @{" zip " link Zip} them.

If you'll see one or more asterisk(s) among your letters, then you're lucky - an
asterisk  can  substitute any letter you want, and will have the price of letter
it actually substitutes.When you put an  asterisk  to  the  playfield,  a  small
window  with  all  the letters of your current language will pop up; you have to
choose proper letter instead  of  asterisk.  The  background  of  the  letter(s)
created from asterisk(s) will remain yellow until you "fix" the word.

If you've put the word Amiga is unfamiliar with, then you won't get more then 10
points  for  it. This strange rule was introduced since version 1.17 of TossWord
due to the reports, that some jerks are trying  to  win  the  games  by  putting
non-existing  long  words to playfield. I'm sorry that honest players do suffer,
but highscores table must be as objective as possible. Moreover, you can not put
the  word  unknown  to  Amiga if you'll get enough points to win the game due to
this word.

By the same reason (dishonesty of some part of Earth inhabitants), I had to
introduce one more rule since version 1.17: if you @{" terminate the game " link StopGame}, then
highscores table will be changed ONLY and ALWAYS if Amiga is winning at the moment.
Again, some people used to play till Amiga started to definitely win - then they
terminate the game and try again and so on... Not gentle at all.

To pause a game choose menu @{" Game/pause " link PauseGame}. Resume playing by pressiing
left  mouse  button.

The game will end if any of the following conditions are met:

1. Two full rounds were made without any words put on the playfield. This
   condition is visualized by emptying of the uppermost gauge in  the  upright
   corner of the screen.
2. The game time has expired (middle gauge is empty). Also see @{"  General control " link MainParams}.
3. One of the players got points equal or more then estimated maximum of points
   (see @{" General control " link MainParams}).

@endnode
@node Zip "Zipping"

                                  Zipping

It may happen sometimes, that you wish to divide your letters in two distinctive
groups. This is the case when you are awaiting for some extra letters to come, in
order to put a very expensive word and you don't want to use other letters which
you  already  posess.  In  this case you may "zip" letters by either clicking on
them with the middle mouse button, or pressing "Z" ("Y"  for  German  keyboards)
key while the mouse pointer stands over the neccessary letter in your bank.

The size of "zipped" letters will immediately change to the one specified in
@{" tooltypes " link Startup}, so you can easily distinguish between different groups of
letters in your bank. In order to "unzip" the letter, just click on it with the
middle mouse button again or press the same key. An attempt to "pick up" the
letter and drag it will unzip it also.

Look at the @{" tooltypes " link Startup} for some additional information  about
zipping.

@endnode
@node HighScores  "HighScores"

                            HighScores

Highscores table contains the names of 10 best @{" registered " link Register} players
(and/or players who played on registered version of program :).

This table is a part of @{" dictionary " link Dictionary} file and, therefore, travels
around the world together with TossWord's dictionaries. The different fields
in this table are rather self-explanatory (see also @{" game process " link Game}).

When the program determines the place of a player in the table, first of all  it
sums  pure  wins.  If  this  parameter  is  equal to the same parameter of other
player(s), then the efficiency and finally the speed of earning points are taken
into  account.

@endnode
@node "Scan" "Scanning"

                            Scanning

If the @{" dictionary " link Dictionary} you're using has changed a lot, or you've made a new
dictionary for new language to be used in TossWord, then it might be  neccessary
to  find  the  prices  of  different  letters.  There's a general rule: the more
frequent a particular letter is, the less is it's price (not less, then 1 point,
of  course).  From  the  other  side,  maximum permitted price is 50 points. The
larger is  your  dictionary,  the  more  exact  is  letter  prices  calculation.
Letters generally reduce their price if they are  often  used  in  short  words.
Result  of  scanning  will  be  taken  into account only since the next TossWord
session; if you want to use it immediately, then  quit  and  restart  the  whole
program.

The result of scanning is fixed in text file called  "Prices.xxx",  where  "xxx"
stays  for  the  name  of  your  current language. This file resides in the same
directory as TossWord itself. It's more than easy to view and/or edit this file
in your favourite text editor.

A note about asterisks, which may represent ANY valid letter from  the  rest  of
the  file:  their  price  is  fictive,  and determines ONLY probability of their
appearance in someone's bank.

You may look at supplied prices file(s) to see how they're organized. The current
prices of the letters may be always seen via menu option @{" Dictionary/Letter prices " link Prices}.
Note that for Russian and English languages alphabets are fixed; say, for
English, the Prices.english file MUST represent exactly 26 English letters
and (possibly) an asterisk. If there will be unexpected letters or some of
letters will be missed, you'll get an error message at startup time.

@node "ARexx" "ARexx"

                                     ARexx

If you do not know, what the hell is ARexx, then skip this part; otherwise, here
are the commands TossWord understands (default result code is 0):

ADD/A  <word> - add the word to @{" dictionary" link Dictionary}; result will be 1, if this word is
                already there. If the word is already in @{" antidictionary " link Blacklist}, then
                2 will be the result.
DEL/A  <word> - delete word from dictionary (and add it to antidictionary). If
                the word is not found, result will be 1; if the word is already
                in antidictionary, result will be 2.
FIND/A <word> - try to find word either in dictionary or in antidictionary. If
                it is not found result will be RC_WARN (5); if the word is found
                in antidictionary, resuly will be 2.

If the supplied word contains invalid characters for current  language,  or  (in
case  of  Russian  language  only)  the  word is considered to be impossible for
Russian  language  (this  is  determined  by  an   appropriate   function   from
rusgrammar.library), then result will be 8.

If the word contains less than 2 letters, result will be 6. The word may be ended
with punctuation marks.

Here's an example of an Arexx script which permits to add words to TossWord's
dictionary from within the great GoldEd editor:

/* Add words to TossWord's dictionary */

OPTIONS RESULTS                             /* Result codes enabled       */

if (left(address(), 6) ~= "GOLDED") then    /* Launch from GoldEd?        */
  address 'GOLDED.1'
  'LOCK CURRENT'                            /* Interface locked           */
  options failat 10                         /* Error level                */

  'QUERY WORD'                              /* Take the word under cursor */
  address 'TOSSWORD'                        /* Pass it to TossWord        */
  'ADD' result
  if rc then say rc                         /* Something wrong?           */
  address                                   /* GoldEd again               */
  'UNLOCK'                                  /* Unlock interface           */
  exit                                      /* Bye...                     */

SYNTAX:
  SAY "Error in line" SIGL ":" ERRORTEXT(RC)
  'UNLOCK'
  exit

/* EOF */

ARexx functions work only between games (otherwise  result  will  be  9  and  no
actions  will  take place). If RC_OK is returned, you'll simultaneously hear the
"swallow" sound. Be sure, TossaWord's ARexx is enabled in @{" MUI settings " link MuiSettings}!

@endnode
@node "Locale" "Adaptation to new languages"

                        Adaptation to new languages

At startup TossWord uses locale settings of  your  system  to  set  the  current
language  for  the entire playing session. Currently, there are English, Deutsch
and Russian versions, but nothing can prevent TossWord to use  other  languages.
If  you're  brave  enough,  leave  in  Tanzania and have some spare time between
hunting the crocodiles, then you may adapt TossWord  to  your  native  language:
award  will  be a free personal keyfile and gratitude of all progressive mankind
(I mean Amiga conmmunity, of course). The steps to be done in this case  are  as
follows:

1. Contact @{" me " link Address}. Maybe someone is already doing (has done) this job.
2. Make @{" price file " link Scan} for your language. Sure you know which letters your
   language has, and which it hasn't :).
3. Make a @{" dictionary " link Dictionary} at least 5000 words long (if your language has enough
   words - otherwise give it up :).
4. Make the language catalog or .ct file (the latter is the better). You may use
   TossWord.cd and/or Tossword.ct files  to  do  it.  Both  of  them  reside  in
   TossWord/Locale  directory.  The  simplest  way  is  to  fill  blank lines in
   TossWord.ct file and then send this file to me. The most complex  way  is  to
   compile  the catalog by yourself using something like CatComp. Note, that the
   version of catalog shouldn't be lower, than the version of TossWord itself.
5. And not neccessary, but could be great, if you would translate this help file
   as well.

Too much job, isn't it? Go hunting crocodiles...

@node "Register" "Registration"

If you like this program, you may consider registering.  Registered  users  will
receive  their  own  personal keyfile which will enable all crippled features of
TossWord. The keyfile contains user's name and  address  and  is  worth  US  $20
(equal to 10 bottles of vodka).

If you're not a registered user, then you'll encounter these limitations:

1. You can't activate any menus during the game (even pause the game). The only
   thing you can do is to stop the game by pressing the "T" key.
2. Game time is limited to 10 minutes.
3. You can't think more than 1 minute for each move.
4. Maximum score for each player is limited to 100 points.
5. You will never find yourself in highscores table.

@node MuiSettings "MUI settings"

These settings permit you to adjust the "look and feel" of @{" MUI " link MUI} interface used in
TossWord. You should understand, that neither playfield, nor player's letters, nor
gray bevel boxes are MUI obects, but everything else belongs to MUI. Use MUI
doocumentation if you're new to MUI.

You'd better set the screen to  "TOSSWORD"  in  the  appropriate  field  of  MUI
settings. This will force MUI settings window to open on TossWord screen.

@node ToDo "ToDo"

                          What is still to be done...

The future of this game depends upon you. If I'll get enough feedback, then
I'll try to implement all these stuff:

1. Built-in explanation of meaning of the words in dictionary.
2. Non-flickering 640в256 screen for those, who can't afford VGA or better
   resolutions.
3. Ability to play with remote partners via modem.
4. Save, load and replay game options.
5. Ability to define the size of playfield (making font smaller, than 14
   points).

@node History "History"

                                    History

1.11  First public release.

1.12

  - Some errors corrected in English version of Tossword.guide.

  - Sorting of @{" highsores table " link HighScores} became more intelligent :)

  - In Russian mode of playing the sorting of letters in "asterisk
    substitution" window will be correct if you have Rusifier V39.1+
    installed.

  - New @{" tooltype " link Startup} "LANGUAGE" may be specified as one of
    starting parameters.

1.13

  - Bug fixed: if you didn't like the word that Amiga has just put and pressed
    "Del" key AND there were some extra words (not just a single  word)  which
    appeared due to last move, then you could possibly get "CxErr #5". Now a
    listview appears where you have to mark unwanted word(s), which will be
    deleted from dictionary.

  - Bug fixed: if @{" MUI " link MUI} setting for TossWord was "Start in iconified state", then
    you couldn't start program and could possibly get message "Out of memory".

  - The calculation of word's prices is different from now from words with
    length more then 8 letters onwards: their "real" prices are multiplied by
    3,4,5... (not 4,8,16... as before).

  - Sorting of different word lists is now being handled according to your
    current locale settings. That's why it would be better if you do not
    specify language for playing as a @{" tooltype " link Startup}; better
    use your default system locale settings instead.

  - More fantabulous MUI help bubbles added :)

  - Bug fixed: merging dictionaries when no highscores table was available and
    new highscores table came with new dictionary caused trashing of this table.

  - When merging dictionaries, the new dictionary from now is tested for
    compliance to current TossWord's language.

  - Lists of player's names are from now "language sensitive" and must have
    the same extension, as current TossWord's language - say, not "Players",
    but "Players.english".

  - Installer script now preserves your existing dictionaries (if any), when
    refreshing old installation of TossWord.

1.14

  - TossWord now opens public screen named "TOSSWORD" in order to permit MUI
    settings window to be opened there.

  - Dictionary from now is being periodically validated (who can be 100% sure
    that concurrently running tasks in your Amiga are absolutely "bugs free"
    and even the Tossword itself has no bugs? Better safe, than sorry...)
    If by some reasons the dictionary  will  be  corrupted,  then  you'll  be
    notified  as soon as possible and the game will be aborted without saving
    dictionary to disk (it is not safe to continue game in this case anyway).
    You'd better reset your Amiga if such a disaster happens...

  - The lists of English and Russian letters are no longer loaded from the
    "Prices" file(s) - they are built-in instead. Of course, the prices
    of valid letters are still being taken from "Prices" files.

  - Bug fixed: last letters in the words were not validated during
    export operation.

  - Bug fixed: adding words to dictionary via ARexx sometimes caused
    garbage characters to be appended to new words.

  - Some internal handling of deleting of words from dictionaries
    rewritten. Now when trying to delete a word you may possibly get
    the message "Can't delete the word now. Do it later". That means,
    that the thinking process which is concurrently working the moment
    has choosen this word as a possible candidate to be put on the
    playfield and it's impossible to remove it safely. This is an
    extremely rare case though.

  - Now you can choose the program's behaviour when you put an unknown
    word on the playfield. In earlier versions it was immediately accepted
    (only for Russian language it was rougly checked to see if it MAY be
    Russian word or not). Now you may choose between old behavoir, or
    ask the player whether he (she) is sure that this word exists, or
    reject it entirely.

1.15

  - @{" Cut words " link Cut} menu option added.

  - bug fixed: you couldn't @{" import " link Import} words longer then current
    field size. Now words can be up to 40 characters long.

  - bug fixed - after deletetion of words sometimes it was reported that
    dictionary was corrupted, even though it wasn't.

  - a lot of new Russian words were added to Russian dictionary.

1.16

  - bug fixed: if Amiga ran out of time while thinking about her move,
    then the turn to move didn't go to next player. Can't understand,
    how this bug could exist for such a long time :((.

  - buf fixed: if you query for number of variants pressing F1 or F2 and
    your time has expired (and Amiga still couldn't calculate all the
    variants), then you were told abount the variants at other player's
    time.

1.17

  - fixed ugly and silly bug, which caused Enforcer hits (write of byte 0 to
    $0000) when "Who's turn" option in speech settings was enabled.

  - bug fixed: it could be potentially possible in some cases that background
    thinking wasn't really running in the background and human player,
    therefore, had to wait until Amiga will calculate his variants before
    making actual move.

  - bug fixed: when Amiga puts more then 2 words at oncce (rather rare case :),
    you could possibly (even more rare case) get the message "Cx Error #6".

  - when you drag letters to playfield and occasionally click somewhere
    in the outside area of the field, the last letter won't be removed
    to your bank as it happened before.

  - bug fixed: after playing a game the general settings field of settings
    window remained disabled.

  - fixed funny bug which caused crash after program exit under MUI 3.2
    (not MUI 3.1). Can tell details to Stefan Stuntz only :)

  - pause screen option is redone from scratch.

  - some minor rules of the game were changed: maximum 10 points are given
    now for unknown words and writing of highscores was changed also.

  - bug fixed: in some rare cases Amiga could not see "good moves", when
    several words were formed simultaneously.

  - from now you can't play game if your dictionary contains less then 5000
    words (20.000 words for Russian language).

  - new tooltypes POPUP_SETTINGS and ...PLAYERS are introduced.

  - parsing of player's names during their input in setting's window became
    more intellectual :)

  - background thinking is now switched off temporarily when player
    presses the ESC key in order to move back some of his letters from
    the field. This was done in order to speed up this process on slow
    machines.

1.18

  - since now Amiga will speak the word it puts on the playfield (of
    course, if this option is enabled) even if it was putting the word
    "in a hurry" due to shortage of time. The (somehow changed) sound of
    moving letters is also produced in this case.

  - bug fixed - some bizarre movements of letters happened if you denied
    computer move while the game was paused. Now you must switch pause off
    and then do whatever you want.

  - bug fixed - human player's time of thinking sometimes could be
    calculated incorrectly while forming of "speed of earning points"
    parameter for the table of highscores.

1.19

  - deutsch language is now available.

  - the @{" zipping " link Zip} of letters in player's banks is
    introduced. You can reirganise the order of letters in your bank
    as well.

  - tooltype "LANGUAGE" doesn't work anymore. It is not possible since now
    to play not in your system default language. Users usually got mixed
    up while handling user interface and the game itself in different
    languages. So, I decided to simplify it all radically :)

  - since now you may play TossWord on non-AGA Amigas, which are capable
    of displayin 64-coloured screens in non-EHB and non-HAM mode; activate
    @{" USE_BOBS " link Startup} tooltype and everything will be OK (I
    hope).

  - you can now get letters back from trashcan if you've decided to make
    a move instead of changing letters - just put the letter to playfield
    or simply press "Esc" key.

  - bug fixed - unregistered players got the preferences window with some
    field looking like enabled ones during the game time (fields such
    "player time" and "game time"). Couldn't properly test it, because
    it happened somehow that I'm a registered player myself... :)

  - installer script was enhanced a little bit.

@node FAQ "Frequently asked questions"

                    Frequently asked questions

1. Why isn't it possible to put several words in different parts of the
   playfield at the same time?

   If you could do that, then it would be often more convenient to  put  several
   short  words instead of one beautiful long word. The game would lost a lot of
   it's flavour in this case. Pragmatism is not the main goal of TossWord.

2. Are there any similiar games written for other computer platforms?

   The programmer from Saint-Petersburg Oleg Kozlov made Macintosh version
   of TossWord.

3. After pressing the 'Esc' key while dragging a letter, this letter suddenly
   gets "duplicated" until I move a mouse pointer or press a mousebutton.
   Is this a bug?

   It's not a bug of TossWord - look at @{" System needed " ling Requirements } chapter.
