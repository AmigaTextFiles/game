@NODE intro "Introduction"

This is a puzzle game with a simple basic idea and (hopefully) addictive
gameplay. You can easily learn how to play it without long manuals and
instructions.

It is based on an old game, named Logical, which works only on Amigas with
68000 processor and Kickstart 1.3. My game tries to bring the idea of this
old game onto today's hardware and also tries to extend the original game
with some new ideas.

There are two versions of the game (AGA and ECS), each available in their
own archive on Aminet. They differ only in quality of graphics so that this
guide file is the same.

@NODE menu "Main menu"

You can choose among:

@{b}START GAME@{ub} - Starts @{"the game" LINK instructions} at the very beginning.

@{b}ENTER PASSWORD@{ub} - You can enter password here and continue playing from a
                 later level. (Not available in @{"unregistered" LINK full} version.)

@{b}OPTIONS@{ub} - Brings you to the @{"options" LINK options} screen. (Not available in @{"unregistered" LINK full}
          version.)

@{b}ABOUT@{ub} - Shows the @{"credits" LINK credits} screen with info on the game version.

@{b}QUIT GAME@{ub} - Quits the game. (What else?)

@ENDNODE


@NODE options "Options"

Following options are available:

@{b}Sound on/off@{ub} - Turns sound effects on or off.

@{b}Music on/off@{ub} - Turns in-game music on or off.

@{b}Profi mode on/off@{ub} - Turns profi mode on or off.

   @{i}Explanation:@{ui} In profi mode you can fill every wheel only once (after the
   green light is turned on, a full wheel won't be emptied any more), whereas
   in normal mode you can fill every wheel as often as you want, but at least
   once.

@ENDNODE


@NODE instructions "Instructions"

The gameplay is really simple. On the top of the screen there is a tube with
a small ball running left and right. This ball leaves the tube as soon as
there is an "empty" wheel right below it. You can rotate the wheel using the
right mouse button. With the left mouse button you can send the ball out of
the whell into a tube. (You can't send it back to the top tube.)

The aim of the game is to fill every single wheel with four balls of the
same colour. Once you fill a wheel, these balls will disappear and the red
light in the middle of the wheel will turn green. As soon as you turn all
the lights green, you will proceed to the next level.

There is one more important thing - there are two different time limits:

- the first one is the time limit for the whole level (diplayed in the
  @{"information panel" LINK info})
- the second one is the time limit for the ball to leave the top tube (it's
  displayed as a bar above this tube)

You can get additional information about the gameplay in the @{"game elements" LINK elements}
section.

@ENDNODE


@NODE info "Information panel"

The information panel is situated at the bottom of the screen. From left to
right it contains following information:

@{b}TIME@{ub} - time available to finish the level

@{b}LEFT@{ub} - number of wheels, you still have to fill to complete the level

@{b}ORDER@{ub} - the order of colours you have to fill the wheels with (read it from
        left to right)

   @{i}Explanation:@{ui} If the five black holes are filled with balls of different
   colours, it means that only the wheel filled with balls of the same
   colour as the leftmost ball in the order panel will be regarded as full
   (ie. will be emptied).

@{b}CODE@{ub} - the combination of colours that is required to fill a wheel (bonus
       time award is shown as a bar under it)

   @{i}Explanation:@{ui} If this display is active the wheels with four balls of the
   same colour will not be regarded as full. First you have to make the
   combination shown (It means that you have to  fill a wheel with the
   balls in the same colour manner as it's shown here.) and first when you
   do that, you can proceed with regular game. If you make the combination
   required fast enough you get additional time to complete the level.

@{b}NEXT@{ub} - the next ball to appear in the top tube

@ENDNODE


@NODE elements "Game elements"

In this section you can read about all the elements that are present in the
game:

@{b}BALLS@{ub} - There are balls of four basic colours in the game: red, yellow,
        green and blue. Everything else regarding the balls has already been
        explained in previous sections.

@{b}JOKER BALL@{ub} - In some levels a special white ball (joker) appears from time to
             time. This ball can take place of any ordinary ball. It is
             regarded as red, yellow, green or blue - whatever is most
             suitable in current situation.

@{b}TUBES@{ub} - The place, where the balls are moving.

@{b}WHEEL@{ub} - A place for storing the balls. It was already axplained in previous
        sections. It rotates clockwise or counter-clockwise. That depends on
        its sort.

@{b}AUTO-WHEEL@{ub} - The same as wheel, only that it rotates by itself and you can't
             rotate it yourself.

@{b}ARROWS@{ub} - They are placed on tubes and specify the way in which the balls can
         move through the tube.

@{b}COLOUR FILTERS@{ub} - They specify balls of which colour can move through the
                 tube.

@{b}COLOUR MACHINES@{ub} - They change the colour of balls that move through such tube.

@{b}TELEPORT@{ub} - There are always two of them in the level. The ball that enters
           one of them, appears in the other one and continues to move in the
           same direction.

@NODE distribution "Distribution"

This game is distributed as @{b}Shareware@{ub}. It means that you can freely distribute
the game as long as you keep complete and unmodified game archive and you 
don't make any own profit out of it.

You may use the game for a 14 days test period to evaluate it. After that
you should either @{"register" LINK full} it or delete it from your disk.

The game may be included on CD compilations (Aminet, Fred Fish and the like),
the same goes for magazine cover CDs and cover disks, but in this case I would
be glad if you let me know about it and maybe even send me a free copy of the
magazine. 

@ENDNODE


@NODE full "Registering"

As you will soon notice (or probably already have), this version of the game
contains only ten levels. To get access to all 100 levels, you have to
register.

Upon registration you will receive a personal keyfile that allows you to play
the whole game and will also enable options and password entering.

The keyfile will work with all future updates unless there's going to be a
huge upgrade to the game (v2.0) in which case there will be an upgrade offer
for all registered users.

To register you should send @{i}10 USD@{ui} (@{i}7 GBP @{ui}or @{i}20 DEM@{ui}) in cash (no coins) to my
home address together with your full name and e-mail address. I will then
send you the keyfile @{b}via e-mail@{ub}.

If you send me @{i}15 USD@{ui} (@{i}10 GBP @{ui}or @{i}30 DEM@{ui}) together with your full name and
home address, I'll send you the keyfile together with the latest version of
the game on a disk @{b}via common mail@{ub}.
