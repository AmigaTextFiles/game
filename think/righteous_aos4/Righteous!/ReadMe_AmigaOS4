Press M while playing to play the music.
The included music is a tiny loop, i recommend you to
replace bgm.ogg with one of your favourite ogg
trance/ambient tunes instead.

Also note that the keyhandling in the game is a bit slow in this
game, if nothing happens when pressing M try again and hold it
a bit longer. If you get a black screen when pressing F, press
F again. Let's hope this gets improved in future updates.

I modified an old MOS makefile to build this new AmigaOS 4.0 
version from the latest sources.

Thanx to Herbert 'HAK' Klackl for doing the MOS compile.

This game is a copy of the famous and great Lumines on the PSP.
It's got potential, and i'll keep an eye on the progress and
try to compile future versions for AmigaOS 4.0!
