TRANSLATION OF WARNING

     This program is distributed as FREEWARE.  I'm not asking for any
donations but if you really feel you need to send me something my
address is listed below.  (I'd prefer chocolate to money any day).
I keep a copyright on the program, and if any big company eventually
asks to publish my game, I may stop distribution of the program as
FREEWARE.  However, lightning will probably strike me first so don't
worry about this.  Give this program to as many of your friends as
possible but make sure to give them the docs as well.

STARTING THE GAME

     Double click on the icon from the workbench screen or type in "ZNYK"
at a CLI.  The SilverFox SoftWare logo will be displayed before the
game goes into demo mode.  Press the joystick fire button during demo
mode to play a game.

PLAYING THE GAME

     ZNYK is a YATLA (Yet Another Tetris Look Alike).  However, the game
is different enough to avoid all the copyright problems.  I got the idea
from several games and just put together my own version.  Eventually
I may add several options to change the game play slightly.  However,
right now, I don't have the time (I'm a starving Electrical Engineering
student at UW-Madison who should either be at work or doing homework
rather than writing games).  ZNYK runs in an intuition screen and
multitasks (although I do read the joystick thru hardware) but I don't
recommend multitasking on a 512K machine with 68000.

     During the game, two balls will "zap" together and then you can
move and rotate them to place them where you want.  The next two balls
to be "zapped" are visible in the upper left corner of the screen. In the
lower left corner of the screen is a tiny window with a chart of how
many white outlined balls of each color remain.  As you near completion
of a stage, the white outlined balls in this window move left.  The
score and level are displayed at the top of the screen.

     The basic idea is to maneuver these balls of three different colors
to match up four or more in a row horizontally and vertically.  When you
do this, the balls disappear.  You get more points for the more balls
you make disappear.  You also get more points for making white outlined
balls disappear.  The main goal is to get rid of white outlined balls.
You can match shadowed balls with outlined balls.  No balls will
disappear until the first "zapped" pair lands.

     When balls disappear, they may "free" adjacent balls and cause them
to fall as well.  This can be useful in clearing up the top of the
screen or setting up chain reactions.  It can also annoying.

     After you get rid of all the balls with a white outline (as opposed
to the balls with shadows), you will advance to the next level with a
sizeable scoring bonus.  If you take too long to complete a stage,
eventually the speed of the game will increase until you decide it is in
your best interest to finish quickly or you will lose.  Each time you
clear a level, the board is reset with new outlined balls.  The highest
level possible is level 9.  After reaching level 9, difficulty no longer
increases (believe me, it's hard enough!!).

     The game ends when you leave a ball in the top row.

HIGH SCORES

     A high score file named "ZNYK.highscores" is created by ZNYK in
its current directory to keep track of the six highest scores.  To reset
the high score table, delete this file.  The high score table keeps track
of name (6 characters), rank (1-6), level (0-9), and score.

     High scores are entered using the joystick to select letters and then
pressing the fire button after each selection.  You can also use the cursor
keys and SPACE to enter high scores.  (Sorry, but right now you can't just
type them in).

     The author's current high score is 107,289 points at Level 9.  Wow,
was I surprised to see the score roll-over!

CONTROLLING THE GAME

     The game is completely Joystick controlled.  Put a joystick in port
1 to play.  You can leave the mouse plugged into port 0.

     ESC key        Ends the game / Exits the Program.

     FIRE           Rotates the balls counterclockwise / Starts a game.

     LEFT           Moves the balls left.

     RIGHT          Moves the balls right.

     DOWN           Causes the balls to fall faster.

     UP             "SWAPS" the balls (equivalent to pressing FIRE
                    twice).

     Cursor Keys    duplicate joystick functions

     SPACE          duplicates joystick fire button

     RETURN         PAUSE

     F1             Toggle Music (sound effects are still active)

     Note:     Pressing FIRE or LEFT/RIGHT multiple times will cause
               multiple rotations / movements.  Also, the Joystick
               will "repeat" if held for more than 1/3 second in any
               direction.

During the game, PAUSE May be activated with the RETURN key.  Pressing the
RETURN key again will deactivate PAUSE.

EXITING THE GAME

     Press the ESC key to exit the current game.  Press the ESC key during
the demo to exit the program completely.

COMMENTS, QUESTIONS???

     If you are interested in this program or have any comments, questions,
or bug reports....  (Source is available for a small fee - $10 - US).  I
am also constantly improving all of my programs.  If you feel there is a
bug in ZNYK or a new feature should be added, feel free to contact me.
Also, you may not have the latest version of ZNYK.  Contact me if you
are interested in receiving updates (for a nominal disk fee of $5 - US).

     ZNYK was written using Lattice C V5.10b and CAPE 68K 2.0 assembler.
Music for this program was written using Easy Sequencer (from SilverFox).
All music, sound effects, graphics, and programming were done by me.
This program represents several weeks work in sampling sound effects,
writing music, drawing graphics and programming code.
