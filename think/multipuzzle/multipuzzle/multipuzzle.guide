@node Tooltypes "Tooltypes"

The following tooltypes are recognized by MultiPuzzle:

PUBSCREEN=<name of public screen>
Use this to open the window on other public screens than the default one (if
there is no public screen with the given name, the program will try to open its
window on the default public screen).

PICTURE=<name of picture>
Set this to the name of the picture to be used.

ROWS=<number of rows>
Use this to set the number of rows wanted.

COLUMNS=<number of columns>
Use this to set the number of columns wanted.

(NOTE! The number of rows or columns set here will be corrected if they
are to big or small.)

@node History "Version History"

v1.0 (10.4.94)  Initial version.
v1.1 (23.4.94)  Added the PUBSCREEN tooltype.
                Added possibility to load pictures from within the program.
v1.2 (13.12.98) Added support for locale.library.
                Source code made public!

@endnode


@node Future "Plans for the Future"

Make it possible to set the options now set by using tooltypes, from within
the program.
Make it runnable on pre V39 systems.
Write more catalogs (if you help me).
Add "online-help".

@endnode


@node Troubleshooting "Troubleshooting"

If you get a message about opening libraries make sure you've got at least
version 39 of the system libraries.
Any other messages are probably due to lack of memory. They're not likely to
show up.

@node Acknowledgements "Acknowledgements"

I dedicate this program to my parents. It was during a vacation to Gran
Canaria with them that I figured out how to use custom pictures as motive
for the puzzles. Before this I could only use preprogrammed motives, or just
numbered bricks.

@node Address "Contacting the Author"

Since the source code has been made public, you can fix bugs or make
improvements yourself. Of course, if you do so I still would like to know
about it.

@node Localization "Localization"

MultiPuzzle is localized, so if you have v2.1 or higher of the OS
MultiPuzzle will try to use the language you have set in Preferences. If
there is no catalog for your language, English will be used as default.

Since I'm not very good at languages I've only written one additional catalog
(the Swedish one). However I've included some files so that you easily can make
MultiPuzzle support your language too.

Translate the strings in template.ct and save it as <language>.ct. Then send
that file to me so that I can include it in my package.
NOTE! The first two characters in menuitems are used for menu shortcuts.
The first one is the shortcut (space means no shortcut) and the second is
always a nullbyte. Make sure you don't use the same character as shortcut
for different items in the same Menu!

@node Game "The Game"

When MultiPuzzle is run, it tries to load the selected picture (or a
default one if none has been selected). If this fails, a file requester
will open where a picture can be selected. When the picture is loaded a
window will open on the Workbench screen where the picture is diplayed.

To start a new game choose New from the Game menu. The bricks are now
shuffled (it may take some time if there are lots of bricks). When the
bricks have been shuffled it's time to start sorting them.

The bricks are moved by clicking on them with the left mousebutton or by
using the arrow keys. Only neighbors to the empty position may be moved.
It's possible to move a whole row or column with a single mouse click.

Since it some times is hard to see any difference between two bricks it's
possible to display their numbers. This is done by pressing 'n'. If the
mouse has three buttons, pressing the button in the middle also displays
the numbers. The numbers are hidden when a brick is moved or by pressing
'n' again (or the middle mousebutton).

To quit the program choose Quit from the Game menu or just close the
window.

The picture can also be set from within the program by selecting
Load Picture in the Settings menu. This brings up a file requester from
where a new picture can be chosen.
