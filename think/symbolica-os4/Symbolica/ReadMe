Symbolica for AmigaOS 4.0

This is a remake of my 1991's (IIRC) game Symbolica for C64.

The symbols on the screen represent a numeric value in the
order as they are displayed on the right. As you move over
a symbol, it decrements to the next lower symbol or
disappears.

Your job is to clear the screen and move to the 'E' symbol.

Ofcourse all is in favour to save the world from some evil space
mutants that have captured your girlfriend to take over the
world... or something like that.

It tries to select best screen resolution for your system, to change
default, see symbolica -h

Keys:

	RETURN enters random level seed editor
	SPACE skips seed editor (aka starts level)
	in seed editor, BACKSPACE deletes a char, SPACE selects one
       	and RETURN sets the new seed.
	1/2 adjusts volume
       	ESC quits - rest should be obvious

Commandline param -help shows a list of the available commandline
params.

There are several predefined levels, but by default a random level
generator is used. In the options screen you can switch between the
random levels and the predefined levels and you can set after how much
random levels the game should be finished.

The random level generator takes a seed, which can be a text, so every
time you enter the same text, you will end up with the same level.
Just play around and write down your favourite levels.

Game, Graphics and Music copyright 2007 by Heiko Irrgang and
contributors.

This is beta software, use at your own risk

All Musics are covers of famous C64 SID Songs, played and
rearranged by Heiko Irrgang:

Menu: Ben Daglish, Bombo, 1986
      (being itself a cover)
Game: Mike Alsop, Wizardry, 1985
      Jeroen Tel, Myth, 1989
      Matt Gray/Steve Barrett, Magic Land Dizzy, 1989

You can replace the music by deleting the files from data/music.
There MUST be a file named menu.ogg, this is the music played in the
menu, but also in the game. Any other file just have to be placed
in data/music. Only .ogg files are supported.

Copyright FAQ
=============

   1. I don't understand the resale restriction... What gives?

      Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
      competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system
      and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money
      from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to
      do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,
      however.

   2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and
      sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?

      Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package" to begin 
      with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. 
      See 1. above.

   3. Are derivative works allowed?
      Yes!

   4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
      Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).

   5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?

      You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the
      quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to
      ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these
      names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,
      substitutions could still could have occurred during font
      opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional
      copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!

   6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get 
       adopted in future versions?

      Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
      provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to
      the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
      additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
      entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep
      both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add
      glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's
      design. Vera cannot become a "ransom note" font. Jim Lyles will be
      providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a
      guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.

   7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?

      Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software
      with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.

   8. If applications have built the names "Bitstream Vera" into them, 
      can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?

      This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source
      systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to
      use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,
      selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font
      names and subsituting alternatives. An example is provided by the
      supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for
      "sans", "serif" and "monospace".  Other software (e.g., the XFree86
      core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.
