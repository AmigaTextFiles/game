                         *** Installation ***

First of all you need Kickstart 2.04 or higher. 
To  install  CrazyClock, simply copy all files into a directory.  Then
start  the program by typing CrazyClock from CLI or by clicking on its
WB icon.
If  you  are running your machine with PAL resolutions the clock image
may  look a litle bit squeesed.  To avoid this effect you only have to
install  the NTSC drivers on your system (for more information consult
your  amiga  manual).   CrazyClock  will  then  automatically open its
screen in NTSC mode.
The  program was created and tested on an A2000 with A2091 & A2630 but
should also run on 68000 with 512k.

                         *** Introduction ***

CrazyClock is... eh... .Yes it is!
For  all  of  those  who  already  kown Mr.R.'s cube.  This program is
inspired  by  Mr.R.'s  clock  (almost  unknown) which is a much easier
alternative   for   everyone  who  couldn't  solve  the  cube  through
intuition.

This  time you only have to move the 9 clocks on both sides to twelve.
Therefor  you  can  rotate  one  of  the four clocks in each corner by
clicking on them.  To decide whether they rotate forwards or backwards
the  clocks  are  devided into halves.  Click on the left to turn left
and vice versa.

The  four yellow buttons in the middle can be pushed up or down.  They
influence  the  connection  between  the clocks.  The only question is
how?   Well  this  problem is up to you.  (It is not difficult at all,
trust me!!!)

So  if  you  are  waiting  for your girl/boy friend, for your modem to
connect,  etc.   simply  test  it  out.   You will soon understand the
mechanism  which  works  inside  the  clock  and later solve the clock
within seconds.

For  absolute beginners it should take about 1 to 3 hours to solve the
clock  for  the  first time, without really understanding how they did
it.   But  after  some  more  tries  only  a  few  minutes/seconds are
possible.

                         *** Dedication ***

Many thanks to:

    - Stefan  Birmanns who  made some suggestions and did a little bit
      beta testing.

    - Christian Scholz who created the game icon.

    - Stefan  Becker.   I  got  good   solutions  to  some problems by
      studying Toolmanagers's source code.






                           Bonne chance!!!
