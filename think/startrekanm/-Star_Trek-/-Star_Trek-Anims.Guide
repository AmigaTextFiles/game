                                Installation
==============================================================================

To install the animations, just copy the contents of the Graphics directory
of this archive into the graphics directory where you have previously
installed the -Star Trek- game.

When playing the game, it will automatically load the animations when
needed (when you die).

Thank you for playing -Star Trek-.  There is also a developers archive
available, for those who wish to create other games from the -Star Trek-
exe.  This would allow for a Voyager one, a Dominion war and many others.

Please contact me if you have any comments (good or bad)
