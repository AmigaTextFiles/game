  What is Twinz?
 ----------------

    Twinz is a game in which you must match up pairs of a selected range of
tiles, until all the board is cleared. In this demo, you can choose from 5
different sets of tiles, and 2 bonus games.

    All controls are done using the mouse. On the main screen, and any
other menus, just click the mouse on any of the options that you wish to
select. By default, the difficulty is set to easy, with the first set of
tiles being chosen, and sound FX being switched off. A lot of the samples
have been cut out of the game, as well as music and some of the other
features, in order to cut down on the size.

    Once you start a game, you will be given a set amount of time and
moves, depending on which skill level you select. The more difficult the
level you select, the less time and moves you start with, but the more
points you get when you score.

    When playing the game, you click the mouse in the brown boxes on the
left-hand side of the screen. If the 2 tiles that you select do not match,
they will turn back over. Remember where you saw them though, as you can go
back to them if you uncover the other piece. If the tiles match, they will
stay uncovered.

    For every pair you uncover, you will get 2 extra moves, as well as 4
seconds extra time. If your time or moves run out, then it is game over. If
you manage to uncover all the tiles, you will go on to one of the bonus
levels supplied with this demo. At first, the computer will pick a random
number, but after that they will alternate between each other.

    The 2 bonus rounds included in this demo are the easy-round bonus,
which consists of different coloured spots. The second, and by far the most
difficult, is a set of resistors, with a 3-pin colour code, which is
different on all the possible resistors. For every pair that you make on
the bonus, you will get a lot more points, depending again on which level
you selected. If you run out of time or moves here, then you will go back
to the normal game.

  How to register for the full-version
 --------------------------------------

    The full version is now ready to buy, and will only cost you five
pounds. Here is a snippet of the things that you will get. Note that you
will need at least 1Mb to run the full version !!!


  *  Over 10 different sets of tiles to choose from. Images range from
     scanned pictures, to hand-drawn logos and signs.

  *  2 bonus levels for each of the difficulty sections. These consist of
     either the same tile that has been slightly changed, or matching pairs
     that consist of opposites I.E. A match in one tile, and a matchbox in
     another.

  *  A personalised highscore table, in which you can save all information
     on rounds you have played. It saves how many games you have won + lost
     for each set of tiles, on each difficulty level, as well as how many
     times you have attempted a bonus-level. It is also password encrypted
     so that no other player can access your data.

  *  Loads of sneak bonus tiles. The best ones reset the board, swap all
     covered up tiles around, super points-bonus, brief uncover, and finish
     level.

  * Over 100K of samples, with at least 3 music tracks to choose from. All
    music and sample options are controlled from within the program.

  * No waiting for the graphics to un-squidge, so the game will run almost
    instantly. Squidger is (C) Copyright Paul Burkey, and is used with his
    written permission, as are some of the tiles. Look out for some of his
    games, namely 'Sneech', 'Jelly-Othelly', 'Shroom-Gammon', 'Peg-It' and
    'Piles'o'Tiles'. 

  * The game itself will be ready as you read this but you still have the
    chance to send your suggestions along with your order and I'll try to
    add your ideas and send you the new version.......

    I am also gratefull for any bug reports, or suggestions to make the

exclusively on issue 1 of Extreme AMOS !! See below for acquiring a copy.

  About Mushroom PD
 -------------------

    Mushroom PD is an AMOS-only PD library I set up at the beginning of
this year. It consists entirely of AMOS programs, and AMOS related
criteria, such as samples and music. I also co-write a disk magazine called
Extreme AMOS, which has recently been reviewed in some commercial Amiga
magazines.

    If you would like a bit more information about Mushroom PD, then you
can either write to me, or E-Mail if you want. If you would like the
shareware issue of Extreme AMOS, then send an SAE with 2 formatted disks to
the above address, where I will be happy to send it to you. Extreme AMOS is
packed full of AMOS tutorials and hints, as well as some of the non-AMOS
stuff, including the foundations of a fantasy-football system.

    At the moment, Extreme AMOS is looking for people to help, by writing
various types of articles. If you have any articles which you would like to
have included, or have suggestions for a longer-running article series,
then you can either write to me at the above address, or contact me at the
E-Mail address.

      Thank-you for your time

              Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett
