                  ›31;42m*****************************›0m



 ›4m=> VERSION 1.0 and earlier <=›0m

  ¤  Beta relased for friends only (and with the bugs in bonus...)


 ›4m=> VERSION 1.02 <=›0m

  ¤  First public released


 ›4m=> VERSION 1.06 <=›0m

  ¤  2 graphics versions ECS/AGA in one cardset.
  ¤  No more file Marryampic.prefs for HardDisk users.
     (very easy installation of new cardsets:just the drawer-icon to drag!)
  ¤  Presence of ToolTypes in the icon of Marryampic :
       PRELOAD
       DIRECTTODISK
       FLASHSCREEN
  ¤  Names of Files CardSample#xx can be named CardSample-xx
     (usefull if your archive your cardset for distribution, just
      because archivers like LHA doesn't support those names !)
  ¤  Screen sizes are now open exactly like the file CardPic.IFF is.
     Before fixed to 320/640/1280 and 256/512 : stupid!
  ¤  Support international caracters when displaying players names.
  ¤  A little menu. (But what for?)
  ¤  And some others changes and less bugs I can't remember...


 ›4m=> VERSION 1.1 <=›0m

  ¤  ToolType 'Filter' + key 'f' to swap the filter during the game.
  ¤  Errors message at the start not correctly displayed : always the
     same error 'Unitialized IntuiFont'
  ¤  Guru if drawer Cards/ is empty, corrected.
  ¤  All the windows on the WorkBench are now RMB disabled.
  ¤  All the gadgets are now GadTools ones.
  ¤  You can push SPACE in the config window, to make a CardSet test.
     (with a hard disk, you hadn't got enough time to push space...!So fast)
     The test displays info on the screenmode used.
  ¤  ToolTypes 'Players' and 'Player#x' added, can be usefull...
  ¤  If no players names are given, set Player#x by default during the game.


 ›4m=> VERSION 1.2 <=›0m / February 1996

  ¤  Now, ok if the font of your WorkBench screen bigger than topaz/8.
     (otherwise bottom-gadgets could be a little cutted)
  ¤  No more displaying : 12 mins , 0 secs ... stupid => only 12 mins.
  ¤  New line supported in CardInfo.TXT : FONT=...../y which will be used
     for the screen (Dominique complains again the too much little topaz/8!)
     Now depending the resolution of the picture, make what you want!
  ¤  2 samples named 'SampleFound' & 'SampleFinished' in the cardset drawer
     will be used (if present) during the game.
  ¤  A little modified to be less memory hungry in fixed released v1.2c .
     (no more bitmap of the size of the window...)
  ¤  Bug when loading a sample while one is playing : pffft at the start. 
     (fixed in 1.2d)


 ›4m=> VERSION 1.3 <=›0m / April 1996

  ¤  A big work : now Marryampic is localised !!!
     I have done the Marryapic.catalog for the 'français'
     Note: yet the errors messages aren't, but don't worry eh?
           cardsets developpers should speak english...
  ¤  A preview is now possible of all the cards during a time in
     seconds. (gadgets)
  ¤  AGA graphics and KeepSample now CheckBox gadget.
  ¤  New ToolTypes :
        * SCANWINDOW=  Yes/No    (Dominique hate this window, so now...)
        * KEEPSAMPLE=  Yes/No
        * PREVIEW=  Yes/No
        * PREVIEWTIME=  number of seconds
        * CARDSET=  name of a drawer  (Dominique like speed...)


 ›4m=> VERSION 1.4 <=›0m / November 1996

  ¤  New rule for the game : now the player who find the good pair
     will play again. (Great Idea by Oliver Lüthje, thanks!) 
  ¤  The "Finished" sample is played when the results appears on the
     workbench (I think it's better...?)
  ¤  German catalog included. Translation done By Oliver Lüthje
     (Many thanks Oliver!)


 ›4m=> VERSION 1.5 <=›0m / October 1997

  ¤  Again new rule : now you can play like a normal 'memory' game:
     (Dominique just said me that he suggested this to me for a long time,
     but I didn't make it at that age.... sorry Dominique, it was a
     nice idea!)
     This is done with the check gadget 'Only sound-pair valid'
  ¤  No more ToolTypes... see below.
  ¤  A new menu appeared with the setup window, in which you can set
     the same options than the old tooltypes.
  ¤  The list of cardsets in the gadget of selection is now displayed
     in alphabetical order.
  ¤  $VER string added in the prog for cli command Version.
  ¤  You now have a new ugly icon, but less ugly than the old, I hope!
     If someone have sometime and some talent, please send me your new
     icon.
  ¤  The docs are now guide, and have been rewritten partially.

 ›4m=> VERSION 1.6 <=›0m / January 1998

  ¤  A little hard disk crash, caused me some troubles to make this version.
     I have no saves of the source of v1.5 final...
  ¤  New line supported in CardInfo.txt, MODEID= number in hexa for the
     screen mode to open the screen. Usefull to avoid using a promoter.
     Many thanks to Starsky and Michael Taylor for the 8 digits bug.
  ¤  Using ScreenTags command to open the screen.
  ¤  New button 'ScreenMode' in the setup to choose easily a screen mode.
     The choice will be saved in the CardInfo.txt at the line MODEID=
  ¤  Enforcer hit removed when displaying the messages in the bottom.
  ¤  Buttons of the interface resized (a little bigger). (You were right
     Starsky!)
  ¤  Displaying the name of the cardset selected in the title of the screen.
  ¤  English doc "debugged" by Michael Taylor <rushmax@calweb.com>.
  ¤  Compiled with a new audio lib fixed : XBaudio.lib (v1.6c)
  ¤  First player to start in a random order. (v1.6c)
  ¤  Open the requester 'Screen Mode' if the screen can not been opened,
     because the MODEID isn't available on your machine. (v1.6c)

 ›4m=> VERSION 1.7 <=›0m / 3 October 1999

  ¤  Now you can pack your samples with XPK package. They will be unpacked
     by Marryampic automatically during the game. Thanks to Frederic
     Laboureur for his NewCommandSet libraries and the XPK support one !
     And final thanks to Dirk Neubauer to suggest me making it !
  ¤  if the xpkmaster.library was not found there was a little bug which
     make the playing of sound failed (I have found that bug with WinUAE
     at my work). Here on my real Amiga I've made the test with renaming
     the library, but it must be already in memory after the workbench
     is loaded... so, I've not see the problem, sorry... But is there
     someone which do not have the xpkmaster.library in his LIBS: ?
     (fixed in v1.7c / 31 October 1999)
  ¤  Czech catalog included. Translation done By AGASlayer^HVR
