@node intro "Introduction"
Introduction :
==============

This is a game based on the popular *NIX game.  The objective of the game
is to guess correctly all the letters of a word in a maximum of 10
attempts.

A few features of this version of the game :

 a. Can use a user supplied data file of words.
 b. Both the keyboard and the mouse can be used to guess the words.
 c. Can give hints if the user is stuck.
 d. Online help in AmigaGuide hypertext format available.
 e. Partly supports localization to default to the localized language.
 f. Comes with 6 languages including English.

@endnode

@node startup "Starting the Game"
Startup  :
=========
  The program can be executed from the WorkBench or from the CLI. It
multitasks properly and runs in its own window.

   From the CLI, you can specify the following optional command line
arguments :

  PUB/PUBSCREEN = Any available public screen on which to open the
                  Hangman window. (Note that the name is case sensitive)
                  If the Public screen is not available, the screen
                  flashes and the window opens on the Workbench screen.
                  Defaults to 'Workbench'.

 LANG/LANGUAGE =  Should be any of the following :
                    Deutsch
                    English
                    Español
                    Français
                    Nederlands
                    Svenska
                    default

                  You can also specify the language that Hangman will use.
                  If not specified or if it is 'default', the Locale
                  language or English will be used. This is useful if you
                  don't have Locale (OS 2.1 or greater) or you want to
                  override the Locale language. The appropriate language
                  data file will be used.

  DATA/DATAFILE = You can also specify your own data file (full path name)
                  to play with. This overrides any language you have
                  specified.

  From the Workbench the same tooltypes are supported. But additionally,
you can also specify a data file by holding the shift key down and clicking
once on the Hangman icon and double clicking on the data file icon. If you
do not specify the data file or the language, it searches for the default
file for that Locale (if supported by the OS) or defaults to searching for
'English.data' in the program's directory.  The uppercase equivalents of
the words in the data file will be picked randomly for you to guess. Only
words with characters a-z or A-Z and length less than 30 characters in
size will be used.


@endnode

@node execution "Playing the Game"
Playing  :
=========

  You start with a word picked randomly from the data file, all of whose
letters are shown as hyphens (-).

  - - - - -    (five letters to guess)

If you guess a letter in the word correctly, they are filled in :

  A M - - A    (two more letters to guess)

You finish the game when you have guessed every letter in the word

  A M I G A

or when you have made 10 incorrect guesses.

@endnode

@node layout "Screens, Buttons and Menus"
The Screen Layout :
==================

- All letters that can be guessed are in the Unused letters box on the
  left hand top corner of the window.  Once you guess a letter the
  corresponding gadget in the Unused letters box will be ghosted. You
  can guess a letter either by clicking on the letter button or by typing
  the letter on the keyboard.

- Below the Unused letter box is the actual word being guessed.

- On the right hand top corner of the window is the scoreboard which shows
  the number of games played, number of games won, percentage of wins,
  the percentage accuracy and number of guesses to go before the game ends.
  There is also a small picture of a man on the gallows which will be shown
  in parts.

- The bottom of the window has the following buttons :

  SHOW ALL : If you cannot guess the word and you want to see that word
             you can click on this button. The game ends and a new word is
             picked from the file for the next game.

  HINT     : If you are stuck and just want a hint, you can click on this
             button. A random letter in the word will be shown and you
             can continue to play the game but this won't be counted as a
             win when you complete it. If you get hints for all the letters
             in the word, a message will come up !!.

  HELP     : If you have amigaguide.library installed in the LIBS:
             directory and this file is in the directory in which the
             executable resides, an amigaguide hyper text window with this
             document opens to give you online help.

  ABOUT    : Some details about the program and the author is shown.

  EXIT     : Quit from the game.


- The Menus :

  Game :     Show All : Same as the above buttons

             Hint     :         - DO -

             Help     :         - DO -

             About    :         - DO -

             Iconize  : Closes the window and creates an icon in the
                        Workbench window. If it is not possible to iconize,
                        the screen will flash once.
                        Double click on this icon to reopen the window and
                        continue playing the previous game.
                        
             Exit     : Same as the above buttons

  Language : This program can select words from different data files which
             have words in the following languages.

             Language          Data File Name Used
             --------          -------------------
             Deutsch           German.data
             English           English.data
             Español           Spanish.data
             Français          French.data
             Nederlands        Dutch.data
             Svenska           Swedish.data

             If the program is running on OS 2.1 or 3.0 which supports
             localization, the program defaults to the Locale language
             preference if it is one of the above.  It searches for the
             data file in the program's directory and if not found then
             defaults to 'English.data'.  If somebody is willing to do
             the translation, all the English messages will be replaced
             by the appropriate language messages.

             On machines which do not support localization, it always
             defaults to 'English.data' but it can be started with a
             different language (or data file) or changed later in the
             menus.

             The menu items under this menu option lets you choose the
             language you want and the appropriate data file will be
             searched for and used. If the program has been started with
             a startup data file, the 'Unknown' item will be enabled and
             ticked. You can change the language any time you want as long
             as the respective data files are present. You do not need to
             have all the huge data files which come with this program and
             you can have only the ones you play with in the program's
             directory.

@node misc "Compatibility, Acknowledgements etc."
Miscellaneous :
=============

Hardware and Software Used :
   Amiga 1200 HD, Additional Disk Drive and an old T.V.
   GadToolsBox V2.0B
   SAS C 6.3
   VI editor (Yes! on the Amiga, I can't do without it)

Compatibility :
   This program will run only on Amigas with Workbench 2.0 and above. It
   has not been tested on the Amiga 4000 (Big bucks!) but I am sure there
   won't be any problems.  It also requires the asl.library and optionally
   amigaguide.library to be in the LIBS: directory. The data file(s) for
   the program should also be present in the same directory as the program.

Acknowledgements :
----------------
   The interface for this program was inspired by a similar one which I saw
   running on MS Windows 3.1 for the IBM PC.

   Thanks to
      - Tom De Voeght (my pal on Internet and Beta Tester)
      - Members of WECC (for their support)
      - Nico Francais (for his Powerpacker group of utilities)
      - Jan van den Baard (for his excellent GadToolsBox)
      - Anders Bjerin (for the C Encyclopedia)
      - Bram Moolenaar (for the VI editor)
      - and to the Amiga, the best Computer I have ever worked on.
   -  All other Copyrights acknowledged.

   The data files were downloaded from 'ftp.denet.dk' (thanks to TDV) and
   modified a bit. If you want more words or languages to play around with,
   you can FTP from /pub/mirror1/wordlists directory in the above site.

@node todo "To Do"
To Do:
=====

 a. Add different levels of play
 b. Support and include more data files in other languages.
 c. Support Powerpacked data files to save some space.
 d. Support localization fully with all messages and gadgets shown in
    different languages.
    Is anybody willing to do the translation ?  If so please send me an
    E-Mail or write to me.
 e. Add sound samples.

 - Do you have any more ideas ?

  All this will be done, if I get a good response for this version. Other-
  wise what is the point in me wasting my time on a program which people
  do not support.
