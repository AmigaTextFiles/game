Cross: Installation
-------------------

Floppy Disk
-----------

DISKCOPY your original WorkBench disk; then delete some files from this
COPY of your Workbench in order to make space for Cross and its files.
Candidates for deletion are "c/edit", "c/ed", "fonts", "tools", "utilities"
or at least some files from those drawers.

Then copy the entire "Cross" drawer from this disk to the Workbench copy
and create a Startup-Sequence on the Workbench copy which must contain at
least the following entries:

   Assign Cross: :Cross
   Cross:Cross


Hard disk
---------
Hard disk users will probably have all required files already somewhere on
their hard disk drive; simply copy the "Cross"-drawer to your
hard disk, and then add the "Assign" to your Startup-Sequence.
