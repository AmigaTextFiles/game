   TinyTainer consists of two games: @{" Mines " link "Mines"} and @{" Master Mind " link "Master Mind"}

   TinyTainer is published under GNU licence. For those unacquainted, it's
   basicly public domain software with few restrictions.

   TinyTainer was implemented and drawn by Daniel Polansky.

@NODE "Mines"
   
   The game is played on randomly mined rectangular area. 
   The purpose of the game is to learn exact positions of mines. 

   The game is controlled with mouse.

   Covered Square
      Left Button:   uncover square asuming no mine is here. If there is no
                     mine, number of mines in adjacent squares is displayed.
                     To avoid misunderstanding, for typical square there are 8
                     adjacent squares.
      Right Button:  Mark square. (Mark as mined).

   Uncovered Square
      Right Button:  if number of adjacent squares marked as mines equals to
                     number on square, remaining adjacents are uncovered. If
                     adjancents were marked incorectly as mined, this may lead
                     to failure.
      
   Marked Square
      Left Button:   Unmark the square.
      
   ----------------------------------------------

   There are four buttons at top left corner:
   
   Z)    Find some place with no mines.
   C)    Change colour of pointer.
   P)    Change shape of pointer.
   F)    Enter new area parameters. These are:
            X size
            Y size
            Mines in filed

         If @{h}Mines in filed@{t} is entered as a number which is less than 1,
         then the meaning is percentage of mines. Otherwise it means absolute
         number of mines.

         For example 0.25 means that on average every fourth square is mined
         (my favorite choice). Choice of 34 means there are totally 34 mines.

   

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Master Mind"

   For those of you who actually know Master Mind, game should be
   selfexplanatory.
   
   Master Mind is played with eight colour squares. Computer randomly chooses
   five of them. Your task is to find out which are these. You have to find
   out exact positions, not just set of colours chosen. For example

   if Y=Yellow and B=Brown

             Y Y B B Y        is not the same as
             Y B B Y Y

   You have several trials. In each trial you chose some configuration
   (example of which is above) and then confirm that configuration (by
   clicking   /  / placed right). You then obtain an information how close
            \/ \/
   your guess was. This information is expressed as number of black and white
   pins. White pins indicate number of positions at which colour of your trial
   matches computer's hidden configuration. Black pins indicate number of pins
   that have the right colour though are not positioned right. Example

      Computer's configuration (colour represented by letter):
      
            Y Y B R G

      And you try:

            Y D Y R D            pins: @{h}2@{t} 1

      Because first and fourth positions are exact match and in addition third
      position's Y is contained in Computer's configuration. These statements
      about whites and blacks assignment might not be accurate and precise for
      you - then you will learn by playing. And one more example:

            B D B G D            pins: @{h}1@{t} 1

      Notice that though first B is contained in Computer's configuration, you
      don't get black for it, because Computer's third B was exhausted by
      perfect match. In other words, you can't get more than one pins for one
      Computer's color square.
