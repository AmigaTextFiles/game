Every ORB blown up by bomb                  -   500

Every 10 matches, advances you 1 wave.
Each increase in waves, increases the speed of the ORBZ descending down the ramp.
Every 2 waves get you an extra pad. (Max. of 10)

Stuff:
------
1.  You start with 5 padz.

2.  If you let an ORB reach the bottom of the ramp without catching it, or
    if you have an ORB on the pad when another ORB reaches the bottom of the
    ramp, you loose the ORB on the ramp, the ORB on the pad (if
    applicable), a pad and 1000 points.

3.  If you fill all of the slots without a single match, the ORBZ are cleared
    and you get a fresh start. HOWEVER, this will cost you 5000 points and a
    pad.

4.  A bomb will blow up all ORBZ surrounding where the bomb was dropped.

5.  Catching a SuperORBZ will allow you to choose between any of the
    5 regular ORBZ.

6.  When CHAOS!! strikes, keep the Chaotic ORB from entering the slots by
    just blocking its' way down with the SuperPad. If you allow the
    Chaotic ORB to enter a slot, ALL ORBZ ,in the slots,will be changed
    to a new color and you lose 1000 points. The Chaotic ORB will try,
    anywhere from 0 to 50 times, to get in. If you keep the Chaotic ORB out,
    then you get 1000 points.
