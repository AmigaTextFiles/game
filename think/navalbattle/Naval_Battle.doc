     I was tired to play battle naval against my grandmother, it's too
easy!. So I told me "Why not to play against the computer?", and I made
this game. I spent a lot of time programming the computer's "brain", it is
not very intelligent, but now I think it is a very good player!. It play
like a man, some times better than a man and it often wins.
The rules are very easy: there are 4 ships that occupy just 1 place,3 ships
that occupy 2 places and 1 big ship that stays in 3 places. The ships can't
stay to cloose one another, there must be water between one and another.

               YES                                NO
                                                                *
          *** **                             ***       ***    ***
         **                                     **       *      *


To place the boats you have to click in the place where you want your boat
begins and, then, where you want it ends (for the littlest ones just in
the place where you want it!!!)

     For AMOS Users:
Naval Battle is written enterely in "AMOS The Creator".
I have compiled it not to make faster(I had to make slower because it was
too fast), but independent from AMOS and to give it to everybody.
If you want sources codes, please send me a blank disk and you'll receive
the codes and all the other games and serious programs by me.
No money is charged, but I'd like to receive pictures or bobs for my next
programs.

     This program may be copied as long as it is accompained by this doc
file both unalterated & money is charged.
