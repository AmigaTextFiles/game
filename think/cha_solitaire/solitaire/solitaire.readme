Solution to the puzzle game solitaire, the one with the
cross shaped board:

    start       end         example moves

      000         иии       00и  ->  ии0
      000         иии
    0000000     иииииии      0        и
    000и000     иии0иии      0   ->   и
    0000000     иииииии      и        0
      000         иии
      000         иии


The solution is given, as is source code (in Amiga E) and
binary of the program I wrote to solve it.  Useful example
of recursively searching a move tree if you want it.
