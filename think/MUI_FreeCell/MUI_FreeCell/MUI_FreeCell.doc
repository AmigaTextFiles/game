WHY

I  must  use PC at work :-( and I play FreeCell on it in free time. I think
I've become addicted to this game and I've tried to find Amiga version. But
there  wasn't any at that time. So I've decided to write it myself and here
it is. It's almost two year old (yes, I was lazy in uploading it to aminet)
but  never  crashed. Recently I've made some improvements for GFX cards. If
you  find  any  bugs  or  have  any  suggestions  feel  free to write me at

USAGE

If  you  don't  know  rules  of  this  game  you won't find them here. Read
original Windows95 help file or ask somebody around ;-)

      Card images dir
                Allows you select directory with cardset
      Card stack offset
                Adjusts spacing beetween cards in stack. Adjust it to the
                cardset
      Card move step
                Selects speed of the card in move. Adjust to your needs.
      Make stacks virtual
                If set, stack area became MUI's VirtualGroup. This prevents
                window from "growing" when stack increases but slows down
                the game.

    MUI:        Allows change MUI-specific parameters of the game.

Keys:
  ESC - quits the game
  F2  - new game
  F4  - show statistics

Hints:
  Press RMB over a card in stack to view it in front.

How to create own cardset:

Every  cardset  is a directory with IFF images named from CARD03 to CARD54.
You  can  display  them  to  see  how  filenames  refer  to cards. For easy
translation  cardsets  from REKO standard I included some Arexx scripts for
Personal  Paint  and  ADPro.  They'll  probably  need  some changes to work
correctly.

HISTORY

1.2 - Fixed shuffling bug which caused that King-club was always placed at
      the end of right-most stack

1.1 - Changed default cardset to allow starting the game on 640 pixel-wide
      screen

1.0 - First public release
