InterLOGIC - Interactive Logic game
-----------------------------------
InterLOGIC game is based on an old Amiga logic game Balls.
The object of the game is to move differently colored balls through
the maze, connecting it with the other same collored balls. Two or
more connected same-colored balls will disappear, and you should
clean the whole maze and finish the level. The balls are connected
if they are in 90 degrees position to each other, in a row or a
corner (cannot be connected diagonally). Current release contains
30 mind-breaking levels for you to solve.
