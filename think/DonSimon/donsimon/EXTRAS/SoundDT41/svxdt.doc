DESCRIPTION
 svx.datatype has been written for use with sound.datatype v41. It replaces
 8svx-/16sv.datatype, the following filetypes are supported:

 8SVX both compressed and uncompressed, mono as well as stereo including 
 channel selection (CHAN chunk) and panning (PAN chunk).
 The same applies to 16SV samples but there's no support for compressed
 files.

HISTORY

 41.0 first public release.
 41.1 decoding of 16sv stereo samples didn't work correctly.
 41.2 fixed a bug that were introduced by 41.1 (didn't work on v40 systems).
 41.3 releasing sample memory for uncompressed 8svx stereo samples crashed
      the system (again a bug introduced by 41.1).
 41.4 internal release
 41.5 fixed and optimized library module.
 41.6 recompiled for use with v41sound.datatype.
 41.7 v41.6 didn't work because it still opened sound.datatype and not
      v41sound.datatype <Aldo Bianchi>.
