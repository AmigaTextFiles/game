 This program is based on work by:
 Christian Buchner (wavdt v40)
 Mark Podlipec (xanim)
 various authors (sox)

REQUIREMENTS
 Any Amiga® (compatible) computer with at least AmigasOS3 and 68020+ cpu,
 ---> v41sound.datatype (get it from my HP or Aminet) <---,
 mpega.library by Stephane Tavenard to play mpeg files.

INSTALLATION
 The supplied Installer script can be used to install the datatype.

DESCRIPTION
 wav.datatype allows you to load and save wave samples that are used on PCs.
 It supports samples with either 8 or 16 bits and one or two channels.

FEATURES
 Makes use of the sounddt 41 API (no stereo->mono or 16bit->8bit conversion).
 Supports (DVI/IMA) ADPCM encoded samples (async reading is used to speed up
 decoding) as well as mulaw, alaw and mpeg ones.
 Provides an encoder!
 
BUGS
 For mpeg encoded streams more memory will be allocated than necessary. The
 reasons for this is that it isn't possible to precalculate how large a 
 sample will actually be. 14/01/2001: Need to fix that, it's possible :)

HISTORY
 41.0  first public release.
 41.1  (DVI/IMA) ADPCM encoded samples are supported now (thanks to Christoph 
       Loewe and Nils Goers for the samples). Encoder didn't calculate
       AvgBytesPerSec and BlockAlign for stereo samples correctly. Truncated
       files shouldn't be a problem any longer.
 41.2  optimized and bug-fixed library module <Gunther Nikl>. Encoder could
       produce odd-length data chunks.
 41.3  implemented alaw and mulaw decoding routines. Thanks to Holger Richter
       for the sample.
 41.4  using mpega.library by Stephane Tavenard, mpeg compressed wave files
       can be played, too. You can find a lot of them at http://www.soundamerica.com.
       Thanks to Gerald Schnabel for the information.
 41.5  recompiled for use with v41sound.datatype.
 41.6  malformed samples could make the RIFF parser loop forever (well almost:)
       <Todd Oberly>
 41.6a included WarpUP version.  
 41.7  the encoder of the WUP version didn't work. Async reading is always
       used, now.
 41.8  it seems that the linker somehow failed to generate a running 68k 
       version of this datatype (mulaw,alaw decoding was broken), this
       is fixed, now <Albrecht Kinzkofer>.
 41.9  clears the break signal before starting loading, for unknown reasons
       this signal is set when IPrefs loads a sound. Without clearing it,
       the computer stops booting telling you that the sound could not be 
       loaded.
 41.10 ok, the saving should really work, again <Luca Longone>.
 
FUTURE
 Support of more compression types (DOCUMENTATION AND SAMPLES NEEDED!).
