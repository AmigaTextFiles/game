                  AWE - The AMOS Workbench Emulator

                        An Brief Introduction


The Amos Pro Browser uses the  latest  in  AMOS extensions, AWE.  This
royalty-FREE extension provides programmers with  the ability to use a
complete interface system in line  with  Workbench 2.04+, within their
own AMOS software! It even permits the use of multiple windows open at
the same time!

   Unlike other extensions, AWE does not rely on the Workbench version
being used,  or  complex  intuition  calls  requiring  the  ROM Kernal
manuals. It uses simple AMOS commands to set up, query, and change the
state of individual  windows  under  AWE  control,  while the emulator
procedures handle all of  the  hard  work  of moving windows, handling
button depressions, text input  boxes  and  so  on.  In fact, AWE will
automatically handle the actions of  most  of WB 2.04+ features. These
include,

Boolean Buttons         Any size, containing text and/or graphics
Text Requesters         Permitting full cursor/mouse control
Check Boxes             With additional text placement
Radio Buttons           Can be split into separate groups
Cycling Buttons         Any number of options in cycling list.
Scroll bars             Full scrolling lists are easy.
Window-to-back gadgets  For cycling between open windows
Multiple screens        All independent: 4/8/16 colours, variable size
Key Shortcuts           With optional character underline.
Disabled gadgets        Saves error checking as gadget is greyed out
File requester          Fully automated, and error checking.
User gadgets            ...for anything we've forgotten!


   The extension also provides a large  set of extra commands that can
be used in *any* product. They  provide powerful re-writes of the AMOS
bank system (allowing over  4  billion  banks),  the zone system (with
excellent grouping  facilities)  and  keyboard  handler.  It  also has
utility  commands  you  will  be  unable  to  live  with  once  you've
discovered them!

   In addition, there is also 'The  AWE Creator', which permits you to
design your windows in a  purely  visual  fashion  with the mouse, and
then generate the AWE-based code from your design. It is also possible
to produce several windows in the  creator and link them together into
a complete application...and then get  the  Amiga to generate the code
for this automatically!


                           Release Details

   Although no formal release date has  been  set, it is expected that
both 'The AWE Creator' and 'The AWE Extension' will be released during
