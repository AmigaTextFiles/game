This is a really simple  little  game  involving  a grid of tiles. The
object being to  turn  them  all  face  down,  whilst  only flipping a
specific pattern over at a time, like a small cross.

For example:

 A game grid that starts,

  ...X.X.                              ...X.X.
  ..XXX..      might change to         ...XX..   if you click on the
  XX.XXXX                              ..X.XXX   third dot of the
  ..X....                              .......   third line...

                            X
... when the flip grid is: XXX
                            X


   This process can be enhanced  by  having  3 surfaces! This means is
will take two flips to turn it up the right way again. Eg. X->Y->Z->X.


Features:

Addictive gameplay. (something that everyone else puts at the bottom!)
Variable grid sizes (from 4x4 to 14x14)
Variable tile sizes (16 or 32 square)
Wrap-around grids.
Various tile sets.
Various flip grid patterns.
Tri-state tiles. (N-state possible, if your brain can handle it!)
Fortune cookie win messages.
Fully upgrable.


                           -- Operation --

This is dead easy, I don't know why I'm writing about it!

Game: This opens a list that allows you to select a Flip Grid shape.

Tile Set: Opens a list that lets you specify which tiles will be used.
It also sets up the 'type'  of  tile.  'Single'  means it has a single
front face. 'Double' means it has  one  back, and two front faces, you
must flip the tile twice to get it to face down again.

Size: The size of the game grid.  This  can  be changed by you to make
the basic game easier or harder.


                           - Game Options -

Wrap-around grid: When this is tick,  and  a tile changes at the edge,
any changes that should occur on  a  tile just outside the limit, will
change the tile on the other side of the grid.

Background tile: This replaces the  graphic  on  the  back on the tile
with a basic tile (blank with  a  small  blue dot in the corner). This
option makes it easy to play with tiles that have two front faces.

Music On: If there  is  enough  Chip  Ram,  a  sound  module will play
throughout the game...but only if this item is ticked.

Sound Effects: Annoying little sounds  that  occur  when you flip some
tiles, finish the game, etc.

Kooky win messages: Shows a sillier  message than 'You Have Won!' when
all the tiles are turned face down.

  The recessed area on the bottom right  if the current Flip Grid. You
can change the design at  this  stage,  if  you  wish. This is done by
clicking inside it. Each area is a  toggle,  click it once to remove a
cross, click again to replace it.


                         - The Game Screen -

Timer On - Opens (or closes)  a  small  timer window. This has its own
'Start', 'Stop', and 'Reset' buttons.

New Game - Starts a completely new game, by returning you to the Setup
screen.

Re-start Game - Randomize the  grid  for  another game, using the same
tile set, Flip Grid pattern, and size of grid.

Quit Game - Let's you give up gracefully!


The large panel on the left is the play area. Just click anywhere, and
the appropiate tiles will flip.


                         -- Configuration --

The file 'flipgrid.cfg' starts with  the  basic configuration for Flip
Grid. You may alter if you wish.  All parameters are optional, and are
in the format:

parameter=on     or   parameter=off

   There is  never  a  space  around  the  equals  sign,  and  case is
unimportant. The valid parameters are,

fx              - play sound effects
music           - play background music
win             - show "fortune cookie" style win messages
wrap            - Use a wrap-around grid


                           -- Upgrading --

One of the extra special features of  Flip Grid, is its ability to add
new graphics and flip grids. To do  this you simply need to extend the
'flipgrid.cfg' file.  There  are  three  parameters  to  define  these
operations:

loadtile        - specifies a new tileset
defgame         - describes the size and pattern of a flip grid
winningtext     - adds new fortune cookie style text

   The simplest feature to add is winning text. You just add the text,
on separate lines, after  the  'winningtext'  parameter and finish the
list with the word 'END'. For example,

winningtext
This line will be added to the list of winning messages!
So will this!
This is the last line to add.
END

   Defining games are also easy. Each  game needs two names (one long,
one short), a 'by' credit, indicating  the  creator, and the flip grid
pattern. Example,

defgame
The Games Long Name
Short Name
'By' Credit
X.X.X
.X.X.
X.X.X
.X.X.
X.X.X

   The flip grid must be  5x5  in  size,  even  if  a portion of it is
unused.

   Tile sets do not require  much  additional  work. However, you must
have previously created an AMOS  icon  bank  holding the new graphics,
and these graphics must be  displayable  in  hi-res  with 8 colours as
either 16x16 or 32x32 icons.

loadtile
FlipGrid:Tiles/path_and_filename_of_icon_bank.abk
2               ; the number of tile sets in the bank
Name of set #1
2               ; The number of tiles in this set
32              ; The size of each tile
Name of set #2
3               ; The number of tiles in this set
16              ; The size of each tile

   If you create any good  tile  sets, interesting Flip Grid patterns,
win messages or hints, then why not  send  them to me and I'll include
them on the next release with your name attatched!!!!


                             -- Hints --

Making the game easier:

   Use smaller grids. By using larger tile sets, you will be limited
        to 7x7 grids.
   Disable wrap around.
   Use simple patterns like the cross (there is a trivial case...use
        a single dot...but that's is just *tooooo* easy!)

Making the game harder:

   Use larger grids (use the small Pooh bear set to go up to 14x14)
   Enable wrap around.
   Play a 3-flip grid.
   Use complex, irregular, flip grid patterns.


                           -- More Hints --

In all games (without wrap-around), it is  often best to get groups of
2 or 3 tiles into a corner, where they can be disposed of easily.


   Here some real give-away clues for  the  Flip Grid pattern known as
"Small Cross".

Key:

. = No tile
X = Main tile
x = Main tile, click here to reduce
: = No tile, click here to reduce

Patterns to look for:

...X..      .....
...xX.  ->  ..X..
.XX...      .XxX.
..X...      ..X..


..X..      .....
.XxX.      .....
.....  ->  ..X..
.XXX.      .XxX.
..X..      ..X..


.X..       ....      ....
XxX.       ....      ....     (must be at left edge, no wrap)
X...   ->  XX..   -> X...
..X.       .:X.      xX..
XX..       XX..      X...

.X         ..
X:   ->    .X     (must be at the bottom right edge, no wrap)
X.         Xx

X.         XX        XX
Xx  ->     .:  ->    .X      (must be at right hand edge, no wrap)
X.         Xx        ..
..         ..        .X

..X       ..X       ..X          ..X
...       .X.       .X.          .Xx   (must be at right hand edge)
X:. ->    .XX  ->   .X:     ->   ..X      (no wrap)
...       .X:       ..X          ...
..X       ..X       ...          ...


As for the others...experiment...

Hi Mr. Steven Goodwin,

   I would like to register my copy of Flip Grid because,

a) I'd like to get some more tile sets.
b) I feel sorry for you, not having had any mail for days!
c) I want to find out how YOU program AWE.
d) If I send this letter it will tear me away from my Amiga for over 2
1/2 minutes!
e) I have a tremendous guilt complex!
f) All of the above                         (circle as appropriate)

   I enclose a cheque/postal order for #5 (which includes P&P) because
I'm a kind hearted  soul  whos  cares  about  the  people  who make my
software.

   Thanks very much,


      Name ________________ (not completely necessary, but ties up the
