   Master Mind is a great computerised version of the classic game of
Mastermind.  The rules of the game are much the same as the original, which
is that you have 12 chances to guess a five colour code which can be made up
of eight different colours and blanks.  Each of the colours can be used once,
more than once or not at all, the same applies to blank spaces.

When each attempt has been made at the code the column will be marked.  The
marks for each column will be shown below that column, a black peg will be
shown for each correct colour in the correct place, a white peg will be given
to each correct colour in the wrong place.  The position of these pegs do not
correspond to the positions of the colours they are marking.

eg. 1 Black peg + 2 White pegs = one colour is in the correct position, two
    of the four remaining colours are in the wrong positions and the final
    two colours are not in the code at all.

When playing the game the colours are chosen from a palette in the bottom 
left hand corner of the screen using the left mouse button, they can then be
placed in the appropriate hole also using the left mouse button.  The right
mouse button is used to remove pegs and the escape can be used during game
play to abort the game.  When each code attempt has been made click on the 
DONE button in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.

If you crack the code and your score is low enough, your name will be placed 
in the appropriate position and the scores saved on disk.  The score table 
will come up whether you crack the code or not and to return to the title
screen after the scores just click the left mouse button.

During the title screen the following keys can be used:

   1 - One player game.
   2 - Two player game.
   S - Score table.
   I - Instructions.
   Q - Exit game.

One Player Game:  First of all you will enter your name and the computer will
                  randomly select the code for you to crack.

Two Player Game:  After the players have entered their names they can chose
                  from playing 1 - 5 games.  In each game they will take turns
                  in entering the code and cracking it.  After the total 
                  number of games have being completed the scores are totaled
                  up and the player with the lowest score will win.  This
                  score is then divided by the number of games played to see
                  if it qualifies for the high scores.

REMEMBER!  Make sure the game disk is write-enabled so that the scores can be
           saved else the game will abort.



                                  HAVE FUN!
