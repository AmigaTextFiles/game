@node "Features" "MineClone - Features"
 
 Why a new minesweeper-style game? Aren't there enough out there?  Well  I
 wanted  a  game  running on the Workbench screen with a nice GUI and nice
 colors. But the programs I've found weren't that  what  I  wanted.  So  I
 wrote my own one.

 I've tried to make it looking like the IBM Minesweeper, but includes some
 features  the  original  is missing. (sizeable window, changeable size of
 minefields, etc) And another difference: it needs Kick 3.0.


 Here's a complete list about the features:

  - sizeable window
  - variable size of fields
  - nice GUI, nice Colors and nice Smileys :-)
  - opens on any Publicscreen
  - using flexible way for allocating colors
  - flashing fields
  - choose bombs by number or percentage
  - Saveclick-option, Automark-option and a whole lot more...
  - global Automark-function, clearing all the trivial cases
  - extra menu with custom actions
  - keyboard-support
  - localized
  - needs Kick 3.0 and reqtools.library
  - written in E

@node "Usage" "MineClone - Usage, Menus and Toolstypes"

 How to start? Well, simply click the right Icon.

 After starting the game you'll see lots of sqares. Over these  sqares
 a  number  of  bombs  are  spread.  Its on you finding these bombs by
 marking the right squares. You need the mousebuttons for  this  task.
 Pressing  the  right  MB  over  a square marks this one regardless of
 whether there is a bomb or not. You can see that only indirectly.
 Pressing the left MB clears this square. If there was a bomb you have
 lost  the game, because you must'n touch bombs. But when there wasn't
 a bomb the square gets cleared and two things can happen: the  square
 is   furthermore  clear  or  a  number  appears.  These  numbers  are
 bomb-indicators. Lets say you see "1" at such  a  field.  This  means
 that  exactly  one  bomb  lies  somewhere in the squares lying in the
 touching squares around this one.


 MineClone  offers an Menu which is available everywhere in the window
 where pressing the right Mousebutton doesn't matter.

                       disabled   and   you   pick  a  touched  field, 
                       MineClone shows the untouched fields as long as
                       you hold the left Mousebutton.
     @{b}Flashing@{ub}       -  flashing on or off
     @{b}check last@{ub}     -  After every Mouseclick MineClone checks whether
                       there  is  an  emtpy field or not like the IBM-
                       Original does.
     @{b}Request@{ub}        -  Sure-Requester  on  or off. If you clicking the 
                       display  fields  for  starting  a  new  game  a 
                       requester may come up or not.
     @{b}Indicator@{ub}      -  Automark-Indicator as windowtitle on or off
     @{b}Release Colors@{ub} -  MineClone  releases  all the Pens it has locked
                       when  the  window gets inactive. Other programs 
                       may  lock  the colors now. When the window gets 
                       the active one MineClone will allocate the Pens
                       again.
     @{b}Allocate exact@{ub} -  When  this  is  selected MineClone tries to get 
                       the  Pens  as  exact  as   specified   in   the 
                       Tooltypes. If not the allocated Pens may differ 
                       from  the  RGB-specs  but  now some Pens may be 
                       free now for other programs.

 @{b}CUSTOMMENU_@{i}@{ub}<num>@{b}@{ui}_SEPARATOR@{ub}           - a separator between the items

 For  the  CUSTOMMENU_... entries <num> means the number of the actual
 item,  starting  with  "1".  For  adding a  custom item the
 CUSTOMMENU_<num>_SEPARATOR ToolType or at least the
 CUSTOMMENU_<num>_NAME  ToolType  must  be  given.  All  the  rest  is
 optional.

 For a living example how to use these ToolTypes look at the ToolTypes
 of the orginal Icon.
