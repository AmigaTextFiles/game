Introduction/Instructions
-------------------------

Guess It is a word guessing game, the idea of the game is to invite a friend
round or get your mum, dad or brother on the computer to give you a game,
then what you do is pick a 2 player game, one of you has to look away or go
out the room while the other one types in the word, it's best doing a small
word otherwise the other player will be there all night. Then once you've
entered your word press return and another screen will come up, you can
tell the other person to turn around or come back in now. Now it's his/her
turn to play, what he/she has to do is type in a word and see if it is
right, if it is right the screen will fade and CORRECT will come up, you 
now get the option the play again or exit, if you get it wrong, the answer
box will clear and you will hear a shoot noise. When your picking one
player or two player NOTE : the one player option is disabled until you 
register, you can try but it will ask for a code, you recive this when
registering.
