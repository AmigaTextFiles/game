@{b}Introduction to AmyFreeCell@{ub}

AmyFreeCell is an Amiga version of a cardgame (@{i}"FreeCell"@{ui}) that comes with Windows95. Made 'cause had nothing else to do.. and it's a nice game:)

AmyFreeCell is emailware, that is if you like it and play it, then send me email saying so..:) (or suggestions etc.. See contacting info for my @{"email-address" link Contacting}).

AmyFreeCell may be freely distributed, but remains the copyright of the author, Joni Yrjänä. All files must be distributed together unmodified.

@node Installation "Installing AmyFreeCell"

@{b}Installation:@{ub}
 - Move this drawer to anywhere you want
 - Copy the @{i}SJYGamesFONT@{ui} -font to @{i}FONTS:@{ui}
   or use the supplied script-file @{i}InstallSJYGamesFONT@{ui}
 - Start it from shell or Workbench

@{i}Note:@{ui} To have "nice" colors (ie. black is black and red is red) either use ScreenMode-preferences to make enough colors available, or use Palette-preferences to make some of the color red and black (also white and grey is used). AmyFreeCell tries first to allocate pens by itself, and if it fails it uses nearest color it can find.

@{b}Files needed:@{ub}
 - @{i}AmyFreeCell@{ui}         executable    @{i}somewhere@{ui}
 - @{i}SJYGamesFONT@{ui}        font size 8   @{i}in FONTS:@{ui}
 - @{i}asl.library@{ui}         library       @{i}in LIBS:@{ui}
 - @{i}diskfont.library@{ui}    library       @{i}in LIBS:@{ui}

Libraries (asl and diskfont) should already be in your harddisk. Or if you don't have harddisk, boot with your Workbench disk and start it after Workbench has been loaded.

@node Usage "Playing AmyFreeCell"

@{b}Playing window@{ub} looks like this:

|-------------|
|AAAA    BBBB |
|AAAA    BBBB |
|             |
|CCCCCCCCCCC  |   A = places where you can store cards 
|CCCCCCCCCCC  |   B = places where cards should end up
|CCCCCCCCCCC  |   C = places where cards are at start
|CCCCCCCCCCC  |
|CCCCCCCCCCC  |
---------------

The goal is to move all cards from A to B, the cards must go in order (first ace .. and last one is king).

You may move only one card at a time and it must be placed in a 'free' place or (in C-area) on top of another card, which must be different color (black on red, or red on black) and the card you are moving must be one less than the card you are moving it on (ie. 2 on 3).

@{i}Note:@{ui} You may not move cards back from B-area.

AmyFreeCell tries first open it's window on default publicscreen, so you should have one open when you start it (ie. Workbench). After you have started it you may resize, position and select publicscreen for it and save settings (or use @{i}Save Settings On Exit@{ui}-option).

@{b}Menus:@{ub}

@{i}Game@{ui}
 @{i}New@{ui}                    - start a new game
 @{i}About...@{ui}               - about information and statistics
 @{i}Quit@{ui}                   - quit game
@{i}Settings@{ui}
 @{i}Use Settings On Exit@{ui}   - when quitting game, save settings to ram
 @{i}Save Settings On Exit@{ui}  - when quitting game, save settings to disk
 @{i}Select Pubscreen...@{ui}    - select public screen to open window on
 @{i}Load Settings...@{ui}       - bring up a requester to load settings
 @{i}Save Settings@{ui}          - save settings using last used prefs-name
 @{i}Save Settings As...@{ui}    - bring up a requester to save settings

@node ToDo "Things that I might add..."

@{b}Things to do..@{ub}

 - tooltypes, shell arguments
 - more font-sensitive
 - user-defined font, hmm not all fonts have those symbols...
 - make font scalable?
 - save/load -game
 - more rules to play with (options)
 - score + highscore list
 - 'true' gfx
 - user-selectable action for double-click
 - possibility to move more than one card at a time
 - 'animation' when card moves from one place to another
 - card-dragging
 - more statistics
 - make own public screen
 - improve documentation, installer script, make some 'real' icons..

And your new ideas, and ideas how to implement some of those things (above) ie. what should double-clicking do? etc..

Send mail to @{"me" link Contacting}.
