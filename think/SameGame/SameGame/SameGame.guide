If you want to have your hiscores added to the list on the website
then send your hiscore file to: samegame@amiga-stuff.com
(The hiscore file can be found in the SameGame directory and
is named SameGame.Hiscores)
@endnode

@node "Requirements"
@{b}Requirements:@{ub}

An Amiga with OS 2.04 or higher.
For some features OS 2.1, OS 3.0 or higher is required.

SameGame can use its own screen, or open a window on any public screen.

For the sound to work, at least one audio channel of the audio.device must
be available.

The only files used are the executable, the hiscores file and, when locale
is used, files from the Catalogs drawer.
No libraries, fonts or graphics files have to be loaded from disk!
To be able to save the hiscore file, the program should be started from a
write-enabled disk.

@{b}Tool Types:@{ub}

Display options:
Note that these only work on OS 3.0 or higher.
When no display tool type is specified, auto mode is used: if a window on
the default public screen is not possible, then a custom screen is opened.

@{b}SCREEN:@{ub}      SameGame opens its own screen.
@{b}PUBSCREEN:@{ub}   SameGame opens its window on a public screen which name is
             entered after the PUBSCREEN tool type. If no name is specified,
             the default public screen will be used.

Other options:

@{b}NOSOUND:@{ub}     To switch off the sounds.
@{b}SELECTBOARD:@{ub} To select the new board number manually.
@{b}NEXTBOARD:@{ub}   To play the boards in sequence.

@node "Rules"
@{b}The rules of the game:@{ub}

Pieces can be removed when there is a block of at least two pieces of the
same colour. These pieces will be marked when you move the mousepointer over
them. After a block is removed, the pieces above it drop down to fill the
empty space. When a column is empty, all columns right of it are shifted to
the left.
The points of a marked block of pieces are calculated by squaring the number
of pieces minus two. So try to remove as many pieces at a time as possible
to get a higher score.
When there are no pieces left at the end of the game, you'll get a 1000
points bonus.
