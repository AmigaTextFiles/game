 MasterMind.jl,  By Kamran Karimi


 MasterMind.jl briefly shows the main points of the MasterMind program.

 To use it, execute MasterMind (from Workbench by double clicking, from CLI
by typing 'run MasterMind' and pressing return), then run MasterMind.jl, this
is an executable file, and don't forget the '.jl' extension. This stands for
JustLook. JustLook is also available on Fish disks.

 During the demo, mouse and keyboard are disabled, don't worry about it,
this is restored when the demo has ended. 

 Note that you are required to press a mouse button from time to time. This
is reflected in a text appearing during the demo. Press the left mouse 
button to continue the demo, or the right one to quit it.
 
 Program has been written considering  various situations MasterMind may be 
in, but just to make sure, you'd better run it with MasterMind's default 
configuration. The best thing to do is to run MasterMind.jl right after
running MasterMind.
