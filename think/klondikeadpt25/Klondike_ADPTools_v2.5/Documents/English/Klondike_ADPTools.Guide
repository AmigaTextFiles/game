@TITLE "Introduction :"

                            @{B}@{U} 3.) Introduction @{UU}@{UB}



 This collection of ARexx programs has been created for the users of
 the game Klondike who wish to @{B}* EASILY *@{UB} create their own games, hence
 if you do not have the game @{B}KLONDIKE DELUXE AGA@{UB}, Klondike ADPTools
 will be of no use to you. !!!

 The main aim in creating these programs was to minimise the user's
 manipulation of files, as well as the time needed to create a game.
 Hence the creation of a game is done practically all automatically.

 @{B}Remarks@{UB} : A good knowledge of the documentations of the ADPro program
           and of the game Klondike (notably section 7. @{B}How to make a cardset@{UB})
           is strongly recommended to fully understand this documentation.

@TITLE "Preparation of images :"

                        @{B}@{U} 7.1) Preparation of images @{UU}@{UB}



 Before being able to create a new card game you must have on your hard
 disc a sufficient number of images of your choice in whatever format and
 size you wish, but >= 86x128.
 
 Users of scanners can digitise directly their images in 86x128 format,
 save then @{B}uniquely@{UB} as IFF 24Bits and use the programs 3 to 5. 
 
 Otherwise you will need :

   * 52 images for the actual cards.
     + 1 image CARD00 = card "REKO-Production" (refer Klondike doc).
     + 1 image CARD01 = card with only a frame (refer Klondike doc)
                        designating an empty space on the screen.

         -> For these two cards, you can use those found in the drawer
            "@{B}Klondike_ADPTools/Templates@{UB}".

     + 1 image CARD02 = representing the back of the card (refer Klondike doc).

 this for a standard card game (55 cards)

 For an "extra" card game (59 cards) you will need in ADDITION :

     + 1 image CARD55 = card extreme left bottom of screen.
     + 1 image CARD56 = card centre left at bottom of screen.
     + 1 image CARD57 = card centre right at bottom of screen.
     + 1 image CARD58 = card extreme right at bottom of screen.

  * 52 image symbols (spade, heart, etc...)

    -> You are strongly advised to use those provided in the drawer
       "@{B}Klondike_ADPTools/Symbols@{UB}".

       The aim of Klondike ADPTools is not to waste time designing
       new symbols.

 And finally, to obtain a perfect result, these images should for
 preference conform to the following points :

 - they should be taller than their width in a system (ideal) of
   86/128=0.67 (example format : 344x512)

 - they should not already contain borders in black or of any other
   colour.

   If it does happen, you can load the image under ADPro and use
   "Operators/Crop_Visual" to supress them then save the image preferably
   as IFF.

@TITLE "2-ScalePics.adpro :"

                         @{B}@{U} 7.4) 2-ScalePics.adpro @{UU}@{UB}



 This ARexx program allows the reduction of your images to 86x128
 then to save them as IFF ILBM 24 Bits.

 These images will be used later by the programs 3 and 4:

  - Start this program from ADPro.

  - Choose the images to be reduced (normally 52, but you may choose more
    to create an image bank then choose those to be actually used).

  - Choose the destination of the reduced images.

  - Enter the base-name of the reduced images.

    Ex : If you enter "Card", the images will be called :
             Card.001
             Card.002
             etc...

    @{B}Remarks@{UB} : The program will provide by default the name of the
              first image selected.
                
  @{B}IMPORTANT@{UB} : After the execution of this program, you can delete
  those images that you do not like but you must be sure that at the end
  of this operation that there are actually 52 files numbered sucessively
  from 001 to 052.

@TITLE "3-MakeGlobalPalette.adpro :"

                    @{B}@{U} 7.5) 3-MakeGlobalPalette.adpro @{UU}@{UB}



 This ARexx program allows the calculation of the global palette of
 the images reduced with @{"'2-ScalePics.adpro'" LINK "CH-7.4"}, thus, all the cards can be
 filed simultaneously on the same screen with good colours :

 - Start this program from ADPro.

 - Choose ONE of the reduced images in 86x128 format.

 - Then the program will ask if you want to define yourself the background
   colour or use the default instead.
  
   If you want to define your own colour. the program will ask you
   to enter the three components of the colour.

 - The program calculates the global palette while loading as many as possible
   of the reduced images.

 - Choose the destination and name of the palette file.

@TITLE "4-RenderCards.adpro :"

                        @{B}@{U} 7.6) 4-RenderCards.adpro @{UU}@{UB}
 


 This ARexx program allows the creation of the normal cards (those
 with symbols) as well as the extra cards (card backs etc...).

 It will use the images reduced by @{"'2-ScalePics.adpro'" LINK "CH-7.4"} as well as
 the global palette calculated with @{"'3-MakeGlobalPalette.adpro'" LINK "CH-7.5"}.

 - Start this program from ADPro.

 - Select the types of cards that you want to create.

   According to the choice that you have made, certain of the following
   operations may not be effected.

 - Choose ONE reduced image.

 - Choose the global palette.

 - Choose ONE image symbol.

 - Choose the destination of the cards created.

 - Enter the name of the card game to be created.

 - The program starts by creating the normal cards.

 - Choose the type of game :

     55 cards : standard
     59 cards : extra

 - No matter which you choose, you must select the cards CARD00,
   CARD01 and CARD02 (refer Klondike doc).

 - ALSO if you have chosen extra, you must also select CARD55, CARD56,
   CARD57 and CARD59 (refer Klondike doc).

 @{B}IMPORTANT NOTE@{UB} : The utility '@{B}REKO@{UB}' provided with the game Klondike and
                  with this archive must be located in 'C:'.
                  (see @{"'Installation'" LINK "CH-5"})

 - Choose ONE card image.

 - Choose the destination of the card game.

 - The program creates the game.

 - The program will then ask if you wish to delete the cards created.

 You can now assign this new game to a key under Klondike, for this
 you should edit the file REKO.Prefs.

 In order to have maximum available memory for the game, I advise you
 to reboot your Amiga, and if this is not enough, to deactivate all
 commodity programs that may be running in background.

 If despite this, you still do not have sufficient memory available,
 you can quit ADPro, open a Shell (or CLI), go yourself in the drawer
 where the created cards are located then type :

                          REKO Card 0 59

 ...assuming that the cards have a base name "Card" and the game is one with
 59 cards.
 
 You should then rename the file "card.reko" in the current drawer and
 put it in the drawer "Klondike/Cards".

    - Added english documentations translated by Peter Hillebrand.
                                              
                                                (Thanks a lot Peter !!)
                                                         
    - Updated installation program (english & french version)


 
 @{B}@{U}v2.0 (16.06.97) :@{UU}@{UB}

  - Rewrite all the ARexx scripts

  - Bug in the command ARexx "GETFILES" in ADPro :

     If the access path appearing in the file requester contained an '/'
     at the end, the list of files chosen obtained by "GETFILES" was
     incorrect (the access paths to files contained two '/' which prevented
     access to the files and caused an error message to appear).

     The ARexx programs allow for this bug and use a 'work-around' to correct it.

  - Deactivation of processor caches and increasing the stack size
    before using the tool REKO to create the card game.

  - Ergonomics improved again : It is no longer necessary to reselect
    each time the 52 files required for the creation of the card game.

  - All the scripts safeguard on the hard disc the important variables
    such as the access path for the images, symbols and palette, the current
    counter of cards, etc... facilitating the choices in the various
    requesters shown by the programs.



 @{B}@{U}v1.25 (15.05.95) :@{UU}@{UB}

  - Updated all the ARexx programs.



 @{B}@{U}v1.2 (07.05.95) :@{UU}@{UB}

  - Correction of some bugs.

  - General ergonomic improvements of the ARexx programs.

  - Optimisation of the ARexx programs.

  - All the scripts save the important variables such as the access paths for the images,
    symbols and palette, the current counter of cards, etc... facilitating the selections
    in the various requesters shown in the programs.

    Note: At this actual time, this saving is lost on each reboot of your Amiga.

  - Added a second collection of symbols (Klondike_ADPTools/Symbols/2).

  - Added a file 'Frame_BackCard' in the templates.

  - Updated the documentation.

  - Added the files @{"'Bugs_Report' and 'Print'" LINK "CH-9"} to make it easier to report
    bugs.

  - Ability to erase the files which have been used to create a card
    game (uniquely the cards created with the palette, not those which are
    in the format IFF ILBM 24 Bits).



 @{B}@{U}v1.1 (06.04.95) :@{UU}@{UB}

  - Correction of some bugs in the message requesters.

  - Better control of file/system errors.

  - Automatic determination :

     - of the base name of the cards
     - of the name of the global palette.
     - of the name of the preview.
       from the first file chosen.
     - of the number of cards to be used to calculate the global palette.
  
  - Ability to choose your own colour or use a default.
  - Added the program '4-CreateCardset.adpro' in case the program
    '3-RenderCardset.adpro'.
  - Support for Commodore's Installer program for the @{"install" LINK "CH-5"} function.



 @{B}@{U}v1.0 (22.02.95) :@{UU}@{UB}
