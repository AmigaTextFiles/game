@node HELP_SYSTEM "A_Sweeper.Guide : System requirements"

@{b}Hardware :@{ub}

A_Sweeper has been written to run on AGA machines, or at least, using an 8 color workbench.
A_Sweeper needs some Ko on your disk and in memory. It is not small, because the program includes some binary graphics and sounds data but it should not take more than 115 Ko.


@{b}Logiciel :@{ub}

To run A_Sweeper your Amiga must have two standards libraries in the 'Libs:' drawer, the GadTools.library, and the Locale.library.

Your WorkBench must be set with at least 8 colors.
Ready to run with MagicWorkbench palette, A_Sweeper can be used with all the palettes you want. Just use the @{" Personnalisation" link HELP_PERSON}.

Just remove the A_Sweeper drawer, all objects used are there. It's simple, quick and clean.

@node HELP_REGLES "A_Sweeper.guide : Game rules"

@{i}Basis :@{ui}

  The one who knows Windows and its Sweeper 'WinMine' don't need any explanations. For the others here are the rules and goal.

  You first get a grid with 10 columns and 10 rows (this is the default).
  This makes 100 cells where the program will hide a fixed number of mines (default is 10).
  The goal is to find where the mines are, without exploding !
  First click on a cell. A_Sweeper will immediately inform you of the result, by displaying its attributes. The possible informations are :
        - Empty cell : the cell isn't a mine and none of the neighbour
          cells is a mine.
        - Number x  : the cell isn't a mine, but x of the neighbour cells
          is (are) explosive(s).
        - Mine      : Bad luck, you exploded. Game ends.

  You have some help !
  For example, if you think a cell is a mine, you can mark it by clicking with the right mouse button. A small flag will appear there. If you click one more time on this cell with the right button, the flag will be replaced by a "?" indicating a doubt. A third pression with the right button will place the cell in the normal 'unclicked' state.

  For those who like challenges, a timer will allow them to make some competitions.

  To stop a game running, click on 'Stop'. To exit click on the window close gadget.
  To start a game, click on 'start'.
  The 'pause' gagdet allows you to stop the running game, without ending it. It's useful when phone rings, etc ... Some ones use it to cheat in some speed competitions. Well, some always need to ...
  You can only use menus when game is stopped or paused, because the right mouse button has a special meaning in A_Sweeper.

        This setting allows you to change the aspect of the different cells
        of the grid. Just indicate the drawer where the icons to use are.
        A_Sweeper comes with at least four drawers to be used with MagicWb
        and NewIcons, for 1x1 screens (ex : DoublePal), and for 2x1 screens
        (ex : PAL).
        Note that to choose a drawer you must click on the 'drawer' icon. A
        path requester will appear and let you select the one you want.

When the settings have been modified, press on the appropriate button.
The choices are :

@node HELP_PERSON "A_Sweeper.Guide : Personnalisation"

    A_sweeper was written to allow you to change the aspect of any type of cell. There are thirteen icons used. You just need to draw new ones, and to change the 'drawer' setting to get a new A_Swepper screen. At least four drawers to use with MagicWorkbench and NewIcons come with A_Sweeper. For screens in DoublePal (or equivalent) and for screens in PAL (or equivalent).

    Here are the icons, the program needs :

        - 1_Mine.iff : Unmined cell. 1 neighbour  is  a mine.
        - 2_Mine.iff : Unmined cell. 2 neighbours are   mines.
        - 3_Mine.iff : Unmined cell. 3 neighbours are   mines.
        - 4_Mine.iff : Unmined cell. 4 neighbours are   mines.
        - 5_Mine.iff : Unmined cell. 5 neighbours are   mines.
        - 6_Mine.iff : Unmined cell. 6 neighbours are   mines.
        - 7_Mine.iff : Unmined cell. 7 neighbours are   mines.
        - 8_Mine.iff : Unmined cell. 8 neighbours are   mines.
        - Clickd.iff : This cell was clicked, isn't a mine, and no neighbour cell is a mine.
        - Flaged.iff : This is supposed to be a mine (flaged).
        - Mined!.iff : Oops, it's a mine.
        - QuestM.iff : What the hell is this cell ? not sure (?).
        - UnClic.iff : Unclicked cell.

    Unlike the previous version, your icons can have as many colours as you want.

    If you make some very beautiful icons, think to me ...
    Good drawing !

   Date version : December, 18th 2000.

   A_Sweeper was written to run on machines with Kickstart and Workench 2.10 and above.

   This program was written for my own pleasure, and certainly won't give you all you have dreamed off. I only hope it will give you some good moments of distraction.

   Distributed as GIFTWARE, A_Sweeper can be copied freely, if and only if all files and programs listed below are distributed together :
     - A_Sweeper            : Main program.
     - A_Sweeper.guide      : AmigaGuide help file.
     - A_Sweeper.catalog    : Localisation file.
     - 4 drawers .......... : drawers with 13 icons each to use with A_Sweeper.

   Note : A_Sweeper.guide and A_Sweeper.catalog files, exist in several
          langages. One copy of each at least must be distributed with
          A_Sweeper. 

   After some time, if you keep A_Sweeper on your disk to play, you should
   send me something (this is giftware). Instead of Shareware you can send
   what you want. It can be postcards, stamps, disks (empty or full), and
   even money. I almost accept everything, but I'm not fond of viruses.

   If some users want to add some .Guide et .catalog files to the langages
   drawers, they should send me a copy first. I will include their work
   and name in the distribution and send them two of my future products
   (actually in developpement), A_Money and A_Video.

   Magazines : if you want to put A_Sweeper on a floppy cover-disk, or on
   a CD-Rom, you are allowed to. But I would be pleased to get a free copy
   of the issue or anything interesting.


@{u}@{b}Acknowledgements : @{uu}@{ub}
   Thanks first to missing @{FG shine}JAY MINER@{FG text}, when he had the great, well, wonderful idea, of making the Amiga. Thanks to ACID SOFTWARE for creating the BLITZ BASIC, even if there is a lot of bugs and missing functions (can't use french caracters, need a powerful editor, code is not always reliable, what about real interface creation tools, ...).
   Thanks to backup copies. Who said Western Digital harddisks were reliable ? My first one did work for 2 hours, my second one has 'Read/Write errors' if I use it more than 30 minutes, etc.... I now own a Quantum Fireball and it is not only fast, it works without any problem (four years yet). What a pleasure ...
   Thanks to all the beta testers, who helped me in improving A_Sweeper.
   Big thanks to David McMinn for the routine using icons and BlitzShapes.
   And finally thanks to me. Hey, who did write all these lines of code ...?
