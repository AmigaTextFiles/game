As  regards  the first picture, should be a pong game (with better graphics
sure)  where instead of two blocks there are two players and instead of the
ball  there  is  a  frisbee.   The game fields should be into the principal
tourists locality of my region.

The second picture, regards a car game (with split screen for two players).
Of this game, there is a playable demo.
