IFF TO TILES  has proven  to be stable in  everyday use.  The author is not
responsible  for any loss of data, damages to software or hardware that may
result  directly  or  indirectly  from the use of this program.  The author
reserves the right to make changes to the software or documentation without

WHAT IS THIS THING?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
IFF TO TILES  is a tool that converts tiles drew with  graphics programs to
special  type  of files.  So you can load these files with HIT TILES 2.  To
draw  the  tiles you can use the file EMPTY.pic in directory Pics.  For the
drawing of the tiles you can respect the following NEW RULES:
Now, you can use all the 32 colors, without limitations,  but remember, the
last tree colors are for the pointer



SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Any Amiga with some memory and kickstart 1.2 or higher
    Asl.library (optional, only for kickstart 2.0 or higher)
    DiskFont.library
    IconX and Execute commands


BUGS
¯¯¯¯
Don't try to use Asl.library with kickstart below 2.0 (remember, this fact
is valid for all programs)

I've tested it on:

    A500    OS 1.3   68000  7Mhz               512K of Chip +  512K of Fast
    A500    OS 1.3   68000  7Mhz               512K of Chip + 1.5Mb of Fast
    A500    OS 2.0   68000  7Mhz               512K of Chip +   1Mb of Fast
    A1200   OS 3.0   68020 14Mhz                2Mb of Chip
    A1200   OS 3.0   68020 28Mhz                2Mb of Chip +   4Mb of Fast
    A1200   OS 3.0   68030 50Mhz + 68882 50Mhz  2Mb of Chip +   4Mb of Fast



Asl.library,  DiskFont.library,  IconX  and  Execute  commands  are  (C) by
Commodore  therefore I am not allowed to spread this files in the HIT TILES
2 package



In future : VERMONE 2, SECOND TO NONE (?) and other special things...
