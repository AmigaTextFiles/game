WHAT IS THIS THING?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HIT TILES 2 is a game based on the wellknown oriental game called Shanghai.
It  consists of 15 levels, each one featuring a screen made up of 120 tiles
placed  in  piles  up to 4 high.  In every screen there are 4 of each tile.
The  aim  of  the  game is to remove all of the tiles from the screen.  The
main and only rule you have to keep in mind is this:  You can only remove 2
equals  tiles at a time ad both must have an empty place on either the left
or the right hand side.



PERSONAL NOTES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I have re-proposed this game only because the latest version had some bugs,
doesn't  work  fine  in NTSC mode and other small problems.  Then, the game
doesn't have nothing of new for graphics, music, etc.  Somebody lament that
the  sound effects can't be changed, but in this doc there isn't wrote this
possibility!   In  fact, not even the modules can be changed (for who likes
the  games  with configurable sounds, soon will be available VERMONE 2).  I
think that this one will be the last version of the game (if I receive some
request  of update and somebody that would help me with music etc.  I might
change idea (but the game will be freeware in every case)).



IMPORTANT

Who wants to create the own tiles, it's better that read the IffToTiles.doc
because some rules are changed!
