SHORT:Asteroids for OS2.0+ systems

This archive contains both a Freeware asteroids clone and the
extended Shareware AsteriodsII game (limited to level 5).

Version 0.92 of AsteriodsII requires:
i)   OS2.0+
ii)  iffparse.library
iii) all game fonts in a FONTS: assigned directory 
iv)  500k memory (300k chip)

The game creates the following files in the current directory:
i)   'keydefinitions'  stores custom key assignments
ii)  'options'         stores game options
iii) 'highscores'      stores high score list

If you have registered for AsteriodsII and have not been offered
