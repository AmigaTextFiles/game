Voyage to Neptune

I did this quick hack to learn ACE BASIC.  It's adapted from some old
source I found in a book.  I compressed it with Imploder.  I WAS about
100K, now it's more like 20K.  Hmm..that tells me perhaps ACE doesn't
optimize for size. <shrug>  I think ACE is a neat hack.

I invite anyone to take a look at the source and hack on it.  If you
need to get in touch with me, my email address is lda@netcom.com.
