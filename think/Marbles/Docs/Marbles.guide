@node whatis "What is this all about"

	What is this all about
	----------------------

	Why was this game made? Well, it all started when I played a small
	game named boxes with one of my friend's TI-85 calculator. I got
	addicted and I bet with my friends that I can port that game for my
	amiga in a short time. I won the bet, here the game is.

	Marbles is based on a very simple idea like boxes, but still it's very
	very addictive. Somehow you cannot leave the game until you have
	completed all of the levels. At least I can't, and I believe that you
	can't either. :) 

	Have fun with the game and please, if you like the game, drop me a
	@{" mail " link authors }. I'd like to hear from you.

	Sources for Marbles are available on request!

@node installation "Installation:"

	Installation
	------------

	You need not to do anything special to install the game. It doesn't
	require any fonts or external devices. The only exeption is the
	BFBPlayMaster.library in the libs drawer. The library is not needed to
	play the game, but if you want to playback music during the game, then
	it has to be installed. Simply copy the contents of the libs/ drawer
	into your libs: drawer.

	BFBPlayMaster.library is a multiformat moduleplayer that is able to
	playback different music format transparently to the user. This means
	that you can play every music format in the background bu just
	selecting the module file. However, in this package only the
	ProTracker subreplayer library is included. This means that if you
	want to playback other formats too than ProTracker, you have to
	download the BFBPlayMaster.library package from amiget and install it
	to your system. By doing this Marbles is also automaticly able to
	playback the different moduleformats. See the @{" .readme " link bfbreadme } and @{" Announce " link bfbannounce }
	texts for further information in this matter.

	That's it. After this just make sure every file is in its right place.
	Binary files are searched from PROGDIR:bin and music from
	PROGDIR:Music. The directory structure should look like this:

     Levelsets (dir)
       Default.lvl                      
     bin (dir)
          Gadgets (dir)

	Launching
	---------

	Ok, how to launch this baby. Just by typing the name of the game:
	Marbles or Marbles020 depending on your machine configuration. You can
	launch the program from WorkBench too if you like. 

	If you experience troubles with launching the program check out the
	@{" trouble shooting " link troubles } section. If it doesn'y help either, then @{" contact me " link authors }

@node gadgets "Gadgets"

	Main gadgets
	------------

	1. Load levels		Load a new levelbank. Levels in marbles are
				gathered in one big file. This way everyone
				can make his/her own levels and automaticly
				save it in one file. No moe hundreds of files.
				Just a handy package.
	2. Load music		Quite obvious. It just calls the bfbplay
				library to change music.
	3. Load game		Load a game in progress. To start a game you
				have to load one of the level banks or a saved
				game.
	4. Start game		What might this be. :)
	5. Quit and die		Quit to WorkBench and kill all used resources.

	Ingame gadgets
	--------------

	1. Undo			This one allows you to correct one faulty move
				If you happen to typo. The game stores only
				one move in memory at a time, because otherwise
				you could try and undo the whole level.
	2. Abort		Aborts the whole game. You are not able to
				continue aborted game unless you have saved it
				first.
	3. (c)			Show some credits.

@node keys "In game keys."

	In game keys:
	-------------

	The marbles has a few in-game keys you should know about:

	's' or 'S'	Save game. The game is saved to position where you
			were when you first began the level. This is because
			otherwise you could move one step and save the game
			again and again. I'm just preventing this.
	'l' or 'L'	Load a game in progress. The previous game will be
			erased from memory.
	'm' or 'M'	Change the background music.
	'r' or 'R'	Restart level.
	'u' or 'U'	Undo last move.
	'4'		Move left.
	'8'		Move up.
	'6'		Move right.
	'2'		Move down.
	Esc		Exit the game.

@node troubles "Trouble shooting"

	Trouble Shooting section
	------------------------

	Sometimes Marbles may throw you out of the game and display an error
	message. If Marbles figures the problem out itself, it displays a
	corresponding error message and exits freeing all resources. If there
	happens a crash or a message is not displayed it's probably because of
	a bug, and it should be reported to @{" me " link authors }.

	Here are the descriptions for error messages:

	E: Unable to open intuition.library V36+.
	R: This appears only if you try to load this on an Amiga that has
	   older kickstart ROM than V2.04.

	E: Unable to open asl.library V36+
	R: Make sure the asl.library V36+ is properly installed in your
	   system.

	E: Unable to open graphics.library V39+
	R: Take a look at the first error message above. This game requires
	   Kickstart V3.0+ (V39).

	E: Unable to allocate memory.
	R: Quite obvious. You have run out of memory. Close something and try
	   again. Note that this software requires 1Mb of Chip RAM.

	E: Unable to allocate asl request.
	R: This happens too if you have too little public memory. Close
	   something and try again.

	E: Unable to open screen/window.
	R: You either have run out of chip memory or you don't have an AGA
	   machine. This game requires at least 1Mb of free chip RAM.

	E: Troubles with palette files: bin/palettes.bin
	R: This happens when you have run out of memory or the file is somehow
	   broken. If you have a lot of memory, make sure you have @{" installed " link installation }
	   the game correctly.

	E: Trouble with gadget files: bin/gadgets/gadget*.bin
	R: This happens when you have run out of chip memory or the files
	   cannot be read or are broken. Of you have a lot of free memory,
	   then make sure that you have @{" installed " link installation } the game correctly.

	E: Any error message appearing with music.
	R: Music errors are all produced by BFBPlayMaster.library. Take a look
	   at it's documents for more info.

Description:    V1.1 library based multiformat moduleplayer. All Amigas.
Author:         Jarkko Vatjus-Anttila <quaid@kempele.fi>
Uploader:       Jarkko Vatjus-Anttila <quaid@kempele.fi>
Version:        1.1
replaces:       mus/play/BFBPlayMasterU.lha
Dir:            mus/play

BFBPlayer is a library based multi-format module player like SmartPlay
but smarter. It uses multiformat replayer library system called
BFBPlayMaster.library.

DEVELOPERS: check out the package mus/play/BFBPlayMasterD.lha. It offers
you the needed information about how to use these libraries in you own
applications.

This version is 1.1 and adds following features since last version:
  - Displays sample lengths too, if possible.
  - Preferences setup. You can save windows' positions and your own module
    path.
  - Several bugs and improvements are made to the library system since last
    release so everything fixed there are automaticly fixed in this player.


 Some features of the player:
  - Small memory consuption: 20 kb for the player and about 100 kb for
    libraries in total.
  - XPK support.
  - Separate versions for KickStart V1.3 and V2.04+ to take full
    advantage over their features.
  - It won't beat HippoPlayer, the best, but it's good anyway and it's
    freeware.
  - The package introduces a new module format BMOD. There is a converter and
    of course a replayer library to play the modules.
  - Autodocs and other developer information is available, but in other
    package: mus/play/BFBPlayMasterD.lha.

 Currently supported module formats are:
   1) ProTracker             2) MED / OctaMED
   3) QuadraComposer         4) The Player 6.0a
   5) The Player 6.1a        6) David Whittaker
   7) GMOD                   8) DigiBooster
   9) PSID                  10) THX Sound System
  11) Oktalyzer             12) BMOD
  13) TrackerPacker III

Download this now, it's worth it!!

@node bfbannounce "BFBAnnounce"

	This is the announce file of the BFBPlayMaster.library. See also the
	@{" .readme " link bfbreadme } file.


Do you have problems with music in your applications? Do you find difficulties
in interrupt setup or in audio channel allocation? These problems don't need
to exist anymore!! BFBPLAYMASTER.LIBRARY has born!! Read on...

What is bfbplaymaster.library??
   It's a library that uses sublibraries to playback different types of
   modules. All module formats are completely accessible through the master
   library. You do not need to know what you are tryng to play or is it
   even possible to start the playback. Bfbplaymaster.library does EVERYTHING
   for you. Functions are called with taglists so you do not need to mess
   up with the registers.

A multiformat replayer library?? Which formats are supported??
   Currently supported formats are:
    1) ProTracker             2) MED / OctaMED
    3) QuadraComposer         4) The Player 6.0a
    5) The Player 6.1a        6) David Whittaker
    7) GMOD                   8) DigiBooster
    9) PSID                  10) THX Sound System
   11) Oktalyzer             12) BMOD
   Remember that every replayer is in it's own sublibrary, so if you need to
   replay only one format in your application, you can easily call directly
   the corresponding sublibrary and forget the others. This saves space but
   does not allow you to call AllocateChannels() function.

Quite a list. What is the needed hardware/software??
   Only the ones your program needs. These libs are capable to run on all
   Amiga machines with KS1.3+ and mc68000 CPU. Note that some of the libs
   may require 020+ CPU, like THX sound system and some may need higher
   kickstart than v1.3. However, all things like that are exaplained in the
   documents coming with the developer package.

Sounds interesting. How am I supposed to use those libs then??
   When copying the developer package you receive complete autodocs,
   example sources and includes in both C and assembly language. They are
   free to use. (Autodocs are in AmigaGuide format :)

FREE TO USE!! You mean NO registration fee??
   Nope. You are allowed to use the libs in your NONCOMMERCIAL programs for
   free. Only the commercial use is not allowed without my permission.

Too good to be true. There has to be a catch.
   No there isn't. I've seen enough programs that fail with music or play
   it wrong hanging or crashing my machine. This doesn't need to continue
   anymore... Oh yes, there was something. Because these are standard runtime
   libraries, you are not allowed to stop multitasking or make non-systemfriendly
   events, but I think that's not a problem, is it?

WOW! I'm off to get those, but where they are?
   In the same place than other wonderful Amiga software, AMINET. Remember that
   there exist two packages:
     BFBPlayMasterU.lha     mus/play
	V1.1 library based multiformat moduleplayer. All Amigas.
     BFBPlayMasterD.lha     mus/play
	V1.1 Developer material for BFBPlayMaster.library.
   Depending on your purposes download the right package or preferably both.

   The packages were uploaded into ftp.uni-paderborn.de on 25th of October
   1996, so if you are not able to find the files from aminet soon after
   that, you are free to ask me to send them to you. Or in other case, if you
   find difficulties in downloading the files, for example your local
   aminet mirror does not work, then drop me a mail and I'll send them for
   you! That's no problem.

Remember that a program worth using is a program worth rating. RATE!! ;)

If you have anything to inquire, suggest or complain, feel free to contact
me. The EMail address is <quaid@kempele.fi> but It'll expire on the 1st of
June in 1997.

@node leveled "Level editor"

	Leveleditor:
	------------

	Here lie the instructions for the leveleditor. The version of the
	editor is shareware and it doesn't allow you to build levelsets with
	more than one level. By registering the editor you'll receive a full
	version with no restrictions. The registration fee is $12 USD or 50
	FIM and I prefer that you send cash as payment. Do not send coins.
	Remember to tell if you want the editor by SMail or by EMail. If you
	want it by SMail you don't need to worry about the disk. I'll send it
	to you free. @{" Contact " link authors } me and ask more details if
	you are interested!

	I think the leveleditor itself is very easy to use. The gadgets explain
	themselves so all I have to do is tell you the following:

	- Each level has to have a starting point. Quite obvious, huh?
	- Each level has to have equal number of balls and goals. Otherwise
	  the levels would be impossible to pass.
	- You may use any combination of wall pieces and others items.

	Keys:

	's' or 'S'	Save the levelset.
	'l' or 'L'	Load a levelset.
	'4'		Abjust level to leftwards.
	'8'		Abjust level to upwards.
	'6'		Abjust level to rightwards.
	'2'		Abjust level to downwards.
	Del		Delete current level.
	Esc		Quit the editor.
