[II] Introduction


 (COLOURS PRO IS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS YOU SHOULD USE BEFORE READING THE
            INSTRUCTIONS, FOR IT IS FAR FROM BEING DIFFICULT!)

COLOURS Pro is the cunning synthesis between Tetris and Breakout. You control
a little spaceship in the centre of the screen; coloured tiles invade the 
screen from the borders trying to reach your ship. To stop them you are armed
with a flying, coloured disk. Shooting it at a tile will add to your score 
and obliterate the tile, if it matches the colour of your disk. If not, the 
disk will be thrown back to your ship with the colours of the disk and the 
tile swapped. The disk's new colour may now enable you to kill a different 
tile. The game ends, if the tiles catch up with you.


_____________________________________________________________________________

[III] Additional rules


If your disk hits a row of tiles with the same colour, all of them will be 
gone. The first tile means the standard score for you. Any other tile adds 
two times to your score.

The standard score you get for a removed tile depends on some factors you can
change before the game begins:

<1> The speed of the tiles [1-8]. The faster, the harder to play and better 
for your score [±5 per unit]. During the game the speed increases 
automatically from time to time.

<2> Bonus-feature off/on (explained below) [±5]

<3> Malus-feature on/off (explained below) [±10]

<4> Tiles coming from all directions or from the left and right only [±10]

<5> Swap-feature on/off (explained below) [±3]

<6> Marble-feature on/off (explained below) [±5]

<7> All-Disk-feature off/on (explained below) [±5]


By configuring these factors you can modify the score you get for a tile from
30 to 98 making the game more [98] or less [30] hard.

If you enable the Bonus-feature, bonus-pieces will appear and disappear on 
screen. You can collect them by moving your ship over them. Collecting four 
pieces of the same colour in a row conjures up a special incident:

  <1> Four GREEN bonus-pieces mean an addition of 1000 to your score.

  <2> Four RED ones give you an extra score of 10 whenever you hit a tile.

  <3> Four BLUE ones have the same effect as <1> and <2> together.

  <4> Four YELLOW ones wipe out all tiles immediately.

If you enable the Malus-feature, collecting bonus-pieces of different colours
inverts the steering of your ship. Doing this again turns everything back to 
normal. The malus-feature can only be enabled, if the bonus-feature is also 
active.

If you enable the Swap-feature, the X-axis will mirror all the tiles on the
screen from time to time.

If you enable the Marble-feature, a marble will appear on the screen bouncing
from one border to the other. Touching it destroys your ship!

If you enable the All-Disk-feature, you'll get a multicoloured disk that
appears from time to time and kills whole rows of tiles no matter which co-
lours they consist of.


You can also play COLOURS Pro with two players, if you have two Amigas 
connected via a serial cable. The two-player game works like the Gameboy(TM)
version of Tetris(TM): Killing two or more tiles with one shoot means two or
more tiles growing on your enemy's screen!

COLOURS Pro can even be played in a special campaign-mode in which you have
to reach a certain score to proceed to the next of the 40 levels. However,
the campaign-mode cannot be used with two players.


_____________________________________________________________________________

[IV] Using the program itself


To load COLOURS Pro just boot with your workbench and doubleclick on its 
icon.
Starting the game opens a title screen that can be left by pressing either 
the mouse- or joystickbutton. You can then choose to change the configuration
or play the game in one player/two player or campaign-mode. 
If you choose to configure the game, a new screen will open with several
buttons on it allowing you to change the tiles' speed, the Bonus/Malus
features, the tiles' directions and the Swap-, Marble- and All-Disk-features.
"Save config" saves your changes to the configuration and starts the game. 
"Use config" does the same without saving.
A one player game is the standard choice when playing. For two players you
need to have two Amigas properly connected to each other with a serial cable.
When playing your spaceship is controlled with the joystick. Pressing the 
"P"-key pauses the game. Ctrl+"C" exits the program. Left Amiga+"A" switches
between the workbench and the game. (Now guess the language!)

When the game ends, you may enter your name in the highscore-table. Scores 
are automatically saved to disk. The highscore-table does not appear after a
Campaign-mode played game.
