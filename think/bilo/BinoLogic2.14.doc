 BinoLogic v2.10 by Per Jonsson DeadZoft 1992

 OBS!! This program requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher!!!!
 And that means it will not run if you've got Kickstart 1.1, 1.2, 1,3 etc.

About Binologic:

 About a year ago I got an idea of making a sortofa Tetris game which
 should be based on binary numbers. The same theory of making pieces
 falling down in a pit and puzzles together full rows.

 Unfortunately I had to reduce almost all my ideas, they weren't
 as good as I thought from the beginning. I made a version , but it
 wasn't much to the world. It wasn't good. I forgot that version
 and after a while I lost the source, maybe that was good :-)

 In the beginning of the year 92 I upgraded to an A500+ and bought me
 an GVP-Harddisk. Later on I went to London and bought me the
 superb Assembler Devpac3.0. (A very good purchase!)

 So, I had to try out all of the new libraries in 2.04 and my new
 DEVPAC. I got the idea of remaking "BinoWars".
 (I call the first version that, Erhmm..)

 AND HERE IT IS! (but with a little better name :-)

Bugs:
 There is one bug that I know at this point, It frees all the memory etc.
 But it steals 152 bytes when it quits, and I have no idea why...
 Hmm.. I haven't made it WB compatible so it's not to good to run it from
 the WorkBench, but if you run it with execute or "show all files" there
 should be no problems...
 And Sometimes I get a guru when I quit the game... But wattaheck..


Instruction:

 There are 11 Buttongadgets which you can press to get some action..
 These are:

 About        : Self explaining

 Xor          : An "EXCLUSIVE OR" (EOR)
 Or           : An LOGICAL "OR"
 And          : An LOGICAL "AND"
 None         : No operation just a "MOVE"

 Not          : An "LOGICAL COMPLEMENT"
 Rol          : An "ROTATE LEFT"
 Ror          : An "ROTATE RIGHT"

 Start/Stop   : Self explaining
 Pause        : Self explaining
 HiScore      : Self explaining but not implemented yet..


 Then there are three binary number-gadgets, three Hexadecimal-gadgets &
 three Decimal-gadgets with some numbers inside. (After you have pressed
 the Start/Stop button. It begins with no numbers at all inside..)

The game itself:
 Your quest is too manipulate the first row of numbers with the
 NOT, ROL, ROL gadgets as best you can. Then with the logical commands
 to the left (XOR, OR, AND, NONE) you can move the first number down to
 the second row. And here comes the point... You shall try to make
 row number two EQUAL to row number three...

 Row number one is randomized, row number three too, But the middle row is
 staying blank until you have made some moves...

 The game is on time and when the time goes to ZERO you lost a "live".
 And when you have lost a live the numbers on row 1 & 2 is rerandomized
 so you still have a chance to reach the score 4294967295 which is the
 highest you can get.. (new from version 2.12)
 The points is the leftmost number-gadget under row three.
 To the right of the score comes the "lives", and at last the time..


New for version 2.12:
 * The rerandomizing when losing a live.

New for version 2.14:
 * Keyboard shortcuts for every gadgets.
   About > Help
   Not   > Number 5 on numeric keypad
   Rol   > Number 4 on numeric keypad
   Ror   > Number 6 on numeric keypad

   Xor   > Number 7 on numeric keypad
   Or    > Number 8 on numeric keypad
   And   > Number 9 on numeric keypad

   None  > "-" on numeric keypad

 (I forgott that the A600 doesn't have any numeric keypad, so if there is
  someone who owns one, tell me if it triggers on the normal numbers or
  do I have too change the key? Faan åxå, alltid är det ngt..)


Misc:
 I couldn't come up with a good routine for generating the numbers and
 I didn't want to calculate all of the numbers to be shown. 
 In this version i just randomize the row one number & the row three
 number , I don't know if it's good, but I think so.

 I'll be glad if I got some feedback, so write to me for Bugreports,
 ideas and/or complains (EXCEPT FOR MY ENGLISH!!!).

 Thanks to Jonas Holmberg for BetaTesting, Henry Aromaa for reading the
 previous doc which is almost gone at this point...

 AND Commodore for 2.04... I just luuuve it...

 (This was a bloody boring documentation, but when you have made the game
  it's VERY boring to write a doc... You have too excuse me... Hope you
  understood what the game is all about :-)
