 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 L.O.G, stands for Lights Out Game, firstly, I must apologize for
 the crap title, as you may guess, I`m not that good with names! 
 If you have a better title feel free to send me your idea.

 The object of the game is to remove all the lights from the
 playing area, to do this, just click on a light, if it is on, 
 it will go off, and if it is off, it will turn on! "Simple!", I 
 hear you all cry, but theres a catch!


 The Playing Area
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ·--·--·--·--·--·  The playing area is a 5x5 grid, like the one
 |  |  |  |  |  |  on the left, when you start playing you can
 ·--·--·--·--·--·  turn lights on in the grid, or you can get
 |  |  |  |  |  |  the computer to create a random level for you.
 ·--·--·--·--·--·
 |  |  |  |  |  |  Starting the Game
 ·--·--·--·--·--·  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 |  |  |  |  |  |  When you first load LOG, you will be shown a
 ·--·--·--·--·--·  little introduction, all the lights will flash
 |  |  |  |  |  |  on and off in sequence, when that is over two
 ·--·--·--·--·--·  menu items appear:

        .-.
        | |  Create a Grid to Play.
        `-'
        .-.
        | |  Quit the Game!
        `-'

 Obviously, the second item will exit from LOG and return to what
 ever you were doing before. The second menu item, however will 
 take you to the grid creator, at this point the first menu item 
 changes to become "Play the Game!". If you click on that now, 
 the computer will generate a random level for you and then go on
 to play the game. If, however you want to create your own grid,
 just click on the lights above the menu items to turn the 
 disired lights on or off, when you have finished click on "Play 
 the Game!". If you decide to use a random level, rather than 
 your own, once you have started to create a level, turn all the
 lights off, and click on "Play the Game!"

 How to Play
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 At first playing may seem quite complicated, it is much easier 
 to learn how to play, by playing the game yourself, before I 
 start, why don`t you load up LOG and have a quick mess around, 
 clicking on the grid squares to turn lights on and off. Once you
 have done that press LEFT AMIGA - A to return workbench, while 
 leaving LOG running, hopefully you didn`t close this window, 
 and the text will still be hear! 

    START GRID          Moves: 1      To the left is a sample
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   .--.--.--.--.--.  game which could be played
 |**|**|  |  |  |   |CH|  |  |  |  |  by you, it is really easy
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  to do, and can be complete
 |**|  |  |**|  |   |  |  |  |**|  |  in only 3 moves. As you can
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  see, the start grid has 12
 |  |  |**|**|**|   |  |  |**|**|**|  lights on. Now, you can do
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  the 3 moves in any order
 |  |**|  |**|  |   |  |**|  |**|  |  you like, i`ll start with
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  the 3rd move, as you can
 |**|**|**|  |  |   |**|**|**|  |  |  see, after move 2, the
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  player has a cross lit up.
                                      When you click on a square
     Moves: 2           Moves: 3      that light will either go
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   .--.--.--.--.--.  on or off, depending
 |  |  |  |  |  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  whether the square is lit,
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  in our case the square is
 |  |  |  |**|  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  lit, so that goes out, but
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  in the 3rd move all the
 |  |  |**|**|**|   |  |  |  |CH|  |  lights are out, this is
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  because, the four lights
 |  |  |  |**|  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  next to the square also go
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  out! This is the case for
 |  |CH|  |  |  |   |  |  |  |  |  |  most of the squares, except
 ·--·--·--·--·--·   ·--·--·--·--·--·  for those on the edge. If
                                      you click in one of the
 cornera in the grid, there are only 3 possible lights, (Move 1) 
 to be switched on or off, in this case, only 3 lights change on
 the board, instead of the normal 5. If you are on the edge, but
 not on a corner, you have a possible 4 lights to change, the 
 same applies as before, and 4 lights change.

 Complicated?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Yes, it is complicated at first, but press LEFT AMIGA - A and 
 continue playing, you`ll get the hang of things soon.

 You`ve Done It!
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 When all the lights are out, the text saying "Playing the 
 Game..." changes to "You`ve Done It!". Umm, thats it, you can 
 then play another game, or quit.

 Limitations
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 ...and to make the game that little bit harder you only get 25
 moves in each game, once you have run out a cross will appear
 over the grid and you will be told "You`ve Had Too Many Moves!"

 Qutting
 ~~~~~~~
 To quit click on "Quit the Game!" at any time. If you want to
 quit immediately press CTRL + C to interrupt the program, you 
 will get a requester appear, just click on "Cancel"

 Example Grids
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ·--·--·--·--·--·  These are some examples of the easier grids
 |**|**|  |**|**|  which you could customise, try them yourself,
 ·--·--·--·--·--·  at first they may be hard, but once you learn
 |**|  |**|  |**|  to play, they can be real fun!
