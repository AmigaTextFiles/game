KaPooka
=======


Introduction
------------

KaPooka is a logic game, written in SDL. It was written on linux, but should
run on any OS that can compile an SDL application.

The object of the game is to guide your red blobby to the exit, pushing the
green blobbies out of the way. You can only push a green blobby if there is
an empty space behind it.


History
-------

The game idea comes from Sokoban and Pengo. It was originally written as
a text-mode demo in Basic when I was in school; I later rewrote it as a
KDE app for KDE1 (called "KPooka"), and thereafter ported it to KDE2. I never
got round to porting it to KDE3, but after making the "Exobius 0" project
(http://exobius0.sourceforge.net) I had a pretty decent SDL based library,
so I rewrote KPooka in SDL, and renamed it KaPooka (as it is no longer a KDE
specific application).


Controls
--------

You can use either the keyboard or joystick to control your red blobby. The
basic keys are as follows :

Arrows / joystick	: Move the main red blobby around.
Esc					: Restart the current level.
Q					: Save and quit.

There are corresponding buttons for most of these which can be clicked with
the mouse.


Saving and loading
------------------

The game will automatically save a file called ~/.kapookarc when it exits,
containing the level number you are currently on. If you delete this file,
the game restarts from level 1. (I plan on making a more user-friendly
interface for new game, continue old game, and moving back & forward between
levels, hopefully for the next version).


Creating new levels
-------------------

The levels are stored in a file level.dat. The format of a level is as follows:

Level name
w h
<level data - multiple lines>
<blank line>

w and h are the width and height (in blocks) of that level.
<level data> is as follows:
	0 = blank
	2 = start (red block)
	5 = teleport
	9 = exit
	10 = normal (green) block
	11 = unmovable (grey/cement) block


Conclusion
----------

I hope you enjoy the game and if you have any questions, comments, problems,
or have made your own levels please contact me.
