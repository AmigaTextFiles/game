Introduction:

AMines is the conversion of the XWindows-Game XMines. I don't know
the sourcecode of XMines, but I tried to write AMines to behave just
as the XWindows version. The only difference is the Mouse-Handling
(because the Amiga-Mouse has only two buttons) and the windowtitle
(because there is not enough free space on an Amiga-Screen).

Why did I do it:

I saw this game on XWindows Workstations, and I think the idea
of this game is really good. Also the XWindows implementation of it
is nice to use. So I looked for an Amiga version of this game, and
found one. But it was different from what I expected. So I decided to
write my own Version. My aim was, to have the same simple user-interface,
as the XWindows version has (No Menus to restart or pressing any keys,
but doing everything by simple mouseclicks).
On the other hand, I never wrote any Amiga specific program, and I
used this game to learn a little bit about Intuition and such things.
Because it is my first Program written in C, I didn't include the
sources. Everyone who knows something about C would have lots of fun
reading the sourcecode, and those people who don't know C wouldn't
be able to learn something from it (except from learning how to do it NOT).



Starting AMines:

You can start AMines CLI or Workbench. AMines tries to create a
file .minesrc in your S: directory, where the highscores are saved,
if it is not already existant.


How to play:

When you started AMines, a window appears, with 30x16 fields.
Under 99 of these, there is a mine. Your aim is, do detect all the
fields with mines. Therefore you can use the left mousebutton, to look
at a field. If there is a mine, you have lost and can restart the game
by pressing the left mousebutton in the Highscore-window. If there was no 
mine under the field, a number appears,
that says to you, how much mines are on the fields in the direct
neighbourhood. (The fields in the middle have eight neighbours, the ones
at the border 5, and the fields in the corners 3).
If you touch a field that has no mine at the neighbour-fields, all
neighbour-fields are uncovered automatically (this works recursively, so
that many fields may be uncovered by one touch).
If you are shure that a mine is under a special field, you can mark it
by touching it with the right mousebutton and a small flag appears on it.
But there is another function for the right mousebutton. If a field has
for example 3 mines in the neighbourhood and you already marked 3 fields,
you can free the rest of neighbours, by touching the field with the
right mousebutton. But be carefull: If you marked the wrong fields,
the fields that really contain mines are uncovered and the game is over.


Known Bugs:
There is a problem with the string-requester for entering the players
name for the highscore list. It works under 1.3 and 2.0, but
with 1.3 it doesn't look very good and it doesn't autoactivate.

=====================================================================
Changes since V1.0:

- There was an error in the recursively clearing of the field, that is
  removed now.

- If you loose, the gametime is displayed, too

- The Restart or Stop function is changed a little bit.


Changes since V1.1

- AMines is fontsensitive now.

- It runs under OS2.0 only
  (1.2/1.3-Users can still run Version 1.1, that can be found on 
   Fish-Disk 707)

=====================================================================

AMines was compiled with DICE. (thanks to  Matt Dillon)

Special thanks to Franz-Josef Brinkkoetter, who tested and tested and
tested and tested and .......
Thanks also to Michael Moellerfeld, who gave me some hints
when i had problems.

If you like the game spread it, if you don't like it spread it, too.


If you find any bug or if you have suggestions for improvements
report them to me. Also if you just want to tell me how fantastic
the game is, you can send me a note :-)
