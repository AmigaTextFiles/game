     The Gallows is a Hangman type game with 3,150 words available in a file
named GallowWords. 
     Objective of the game is to fill in the blanks and guess the word.
Operation of the game itself is mostly self-explanatory.  Guess letters by
either using the mouse and the letters across the bottom of the screen or by
using the keyboard.  The character graphic is hung after the seventh miss.
     The letter gadgets at the bottom of the screen also function as the list
of available letters. If a letter is showing, it is available.
     New words may be added to or substituted for the ones included by
listing one word per line using practically any ASCII text editor and saving
the list under the name "GallowWords". The word list can have no more than
9,450 words, and each word can have no more than 20 characters. Put the word
list in the same directory as the program: Gallows.
