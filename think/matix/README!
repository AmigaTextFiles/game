HI!

Thank you for downloading MATTIX.

In order to install mattix you should open a drawer and assign it:

example: 
           assign MATTIX: hd0:game/mattix

when the drawer name is mattix.

in that drawer you have to put all the files from this archive.

You have to copy the ruby fonts to your fonts drawer if you still dont have it.

Now type mattix from shell or dobble-click on mattix and choos ok.


have fun.
                         Alon Fliess.
