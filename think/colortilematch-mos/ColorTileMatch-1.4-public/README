------------------------------ THE GAME -----------------------------

Click on groups of adjacent, identically-colored
squares to eliminate them.


----------------------- BUILDING THE PROGRAM ------------------------

Use *.sh build scripts to build on UNIX or Mac OS X and use the *.bat 
script to build with MinGW on Windows.

To build on Mac OS 9 with MPW, extract "MPWBuildScript.sea.hqx" and
follow instructions inside.

Requires SDL 1.2 library (on Mac OS X, it must be installed as a Framework).
