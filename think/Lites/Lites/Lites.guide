@node lites "How to Play"

   When you first run lites, a small window comes up with four buttons inside
of it. The buttons are labeled, Quit Lites, Continue Game, New Game and
Instructions. The instructions button gives a little overview to the game,
how to win, etc. To start a new game and go to the game screen you click the
new game button, from there the game screen is brought up with your puzzle.
Move the cursor around with the numeric keypad until you come to the squares
you want to switch. To switch the squares just press 's' and the five squares
will switch to off if they are on or vice-versa. To quit back to the main
menu just press 'q', you will immidiately go back to the main menu and be able
to continue your game by just clicking the Continue Game button.
