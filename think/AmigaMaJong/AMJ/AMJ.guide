Group 4. Words         (7 tiles * 4 of each kind =   28 tiles)
Group 5. Flowers       (8 unique flowers)        =    8 tiles)
                                                   ===========
                                                    144 tiles

                           East, West and South.

Mah Jong Objectives
-------------------

     The objective of Mah Jong is to try to match up all of your
tiles in a three tiles run sequence or 3 or 4 of a kind before
all 144 tiles has been taken from the deck or other players has
won the game.

     The player who starts the round receives 14 random tiles and
the rest of the players gets 13 tiles.  The player with 14 tiles



must throw one tile out to start the round.  The player right
next to him can take the tile that he just threw out or he can
take a new tile from the deck.  If the player decides to take the
tile, he must have two other tiles in his hand that he can match
the throwing tile.  And if he does match it, he then must lay
down the two tiles with the throwing tile facing up so other
players would know which tiles are out.  The three tiles are now
his and nobody can get it even the player who owns the tiles.
    And if the player decides that he can't match the throwing
tile, he must pick a new tile from the deck and throw out one
tile from his own hand.  This tile can be any tile from the
player's hand or even the one he just picked up.
    After the second player has throwing out his tile,  the
player right next to him have the options to take the throwing
tile or take a new tile from the deck.
    The  procedure describe above  repeats until a player has won
or there are no more tiles left to continue playing.  In the
event of that, it's considered draw.


How to Start Up Amiga Mah Jong
------------------------------

    You can run Amiga Mah Jong by clicking AMJ icon from
WorkBench or by typing 'AMJ' from CLI.


Game Menus
----------

    Game Menus are located on the left hand side of the screen. 
These menus let you control the flow of the game.  Here are game
menus.


New Tile
--------

    When you select this menu, you will be given the next
available tile from the deck.  Your new tile will be shown on the
right hand side of the screen just below the game options by the
edge of the table.


Take
----

    To take the tile that the computer just threw out, select
TAKE from the game menu.  Now, you must select three tiles.  The
first two tiles are for matching and the third tile to throw out,
that's the tile that you don't need.  The two matching tiles must
be in sequence or in-between tiles or pairs.  To match four of a
kind, just select the three tiles that you want to match.

Eg: computer throws out tile circle 4.

    possible run-sequence matches (the first two tiles):

    1. 2 3 
    2. 5 6 
    3. 4 4   (for three of a kind)
    4. 4 4 4 (for four of a kind)

    possible match in-between tiles (the first two tiles):

    1. 3 5

    The two tiles your've selected to match will be ghosted.  If
you successfully matched the computer's tile, your two tiles and
the computer's tile will be grouped and will be put on the left
hand side of your tiles and will be ghost.  Ghosted tiles cannot
be moved or selected.  If you are unable to match the computer's
tile, you will be prompted with a message and you can try to
match the computer's tile with your other tiles again.


Drop
----

    When you select a new tile and you don't want it, you select
DROP to throw it out.


Keep
----

    Keep is when you select a new tile and want to keep it.  When
you select KEEP from the game menu, you must now select a tile to
throw out from your own tiles.  You will not be able to undo this
procedure, so you must be careful when you want to keep a tile.


Game Options
------------

    Game options are located on the right hand side of the
screen.  There are four (4) options.


New
---

    Quit this game and restart a new game.





Quit
----

    To quit the game and return to AmigaDos or WorkBench.


Sort
----

    Sort your tiles.  Note that sort will your tiles accordingly
but will not put any tiles in sequence for you.  You must decide
which tiles goes with which.


Win
---

    To win the game you must have all your tiles in sequenced or
in ordered.  Eg: all circles, bamboos and characters must be
grouped in 3's for a sequence run or grouped 3 of a kind or 4 of
a kind.     
    The groups don't have to be in order, they can to placed
anywhere, but the tiles must belong to the same group and
sequenced.  Eg: circles 2 3 4 characters 1 2 3 circles 8 8 8. 
And you must always have a pair to win.
    When you're ready to win, select the 'WIN' option from the
game option.  After you have selected the 'WIN' option, move the
pointer to your tiles and select the position where you want the
winning tile to go.  Your tiles now should be shifted to the
right by one tile, and the position where your new tile is, it
is now your 14th tile.  You will be prompted if you win the game
or not.  You can repeat the winning process as long as you want.

Eg: suppose that you need circle 6 to win the game and your
    tiles are as follows:

    . . .  5 7  . . .

    You would move the pointer to 7 and press the left button
mouse to win the game.


Player's and Computer's Tiles
-----------------------------

     Your playing tiles are on the bottom screen with all the
tiles opened.  The computer's tiles are located on the top and
it's facing down.






Moving Your Own Tiles
---------------------

     You can freely swap your tiles by selecting two tiles that
are not ghosted.  Ghosted tiles are the ones that you've laid
down earlier in the game when you matched them with the
computer's tile.



New Tile Position
-----------------

     The new tile position is used for the your new tile, your
14th tile when you are attempting to win and the computer's 14th
tile when the computer has won.

receive a new tile from the deck.
