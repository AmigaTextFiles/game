@ENDNODE
@NODE Installation Installation
@TOC MAIN

    Just copy the AmiSudoku drawer anywhere you want. No assignation is needed.
    The AmiSudoku.guide and AmiSudoku.iff files can be deleted if you don't want
    to use the guide.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Running "Running the program / ToolTypes"
@TOC MAIN

    The stack used by AmiSudoku can be set to about 32 kB. If you have some
    crash using the solver, try to increase it, and please let me know what
    was the problem (sending me the grid that caused the crash would be a
    nice thing).

    AmiSudoku can be started from the CLI or the Workbench (by double
    clicking on it's icon).

    @{b}Running from a CLI (or Shell)@{ub}
    The template of the command is:

    AmiSudoku GAME_FILE

    You can start the program without giving it a file name: a grid will be
    generated at start up. The file passed as an argument, if any, must be
    a file previously saved using the save menu.

    @{b}Running from Workbench@{ub}
    You only have to click twice on the icon of the program or on an icon
    associated to a file saved with AmiSudoku.

      The program icon accepts the two tooltypes described here:
    @{"  LEVEL " LINK LEVEL},
    @{"CELLSIZE" LINK CELLSIZE},

      Use the Workbench Information menuitem to display and modify them.
@ENDNODE
@NODE LEVEL "The LEVEL tooltype"
@TOC Running

    This tooltype is used to define the level used by AmiSudoku to @{"create" LINK "New game"}
    a new grid. It can be set between 1 (easy) to 4 (difficult).
    This value can be set using the @{"prefs menu" LINK Prefs} of the program.
@ENDNODE
@NODE CELLSIZE "The CELLSIZE tooltype"
@TOC Running

    This tooltype is used to define the size of the game area. It can be set
    between 1 (little) and 6 (very large). This tooltype has to be set
    according to your screen dimensions, little value is good for low
    resolutions and greater values are better for large screens.
    This value can be set using the @{"prefs menu" LINK Prefs} of the program.
@ENDNODE
@NODE Usage "Program usage"
@TOC MAIN

    Sudoku is a simple number-based puzzle/game played on a
    9x9 grid that is divided into 3x3 subgrids. The goal is to enter
    a number from 1 to 9 in each cell so that each number appears
    only once in each column and row. In addition, each 3x3 subgrid
    may only contain one of each number.

    How to Play the Game.

    @{"The main window" Link "AmiSudoku.iff/MAIN"}

    The window is divided in two main parts : the left side is a 9x9
    grid, used to display the game, the right part is a column including
    nine cells used to help the player to find the good numbers.

    At the start of a new game, Sudoku fills in a random selection
    of cells for you - the number of cells depends on the difficulty
    level you use. The grey cells are locked and can't be changed.
    Click in any of the empty cells or use the arrow keys to highlight
    individual cells and press a number from 1 to 9 to fill in the cell.
    To clear a cell, press 0 or Delete, or click on it with the middle
    mouse button. You can also use the right column to play a number
    (click using the middle button on the cell with the number you
    want to play).
    The current selected cell is colored in blue.

    When you have successfully completed all subgrids, the entire
    puzzle is highlighted in green until you start a new game.

    As you work to complete the puzzle, you can display possible or
    impossible solutions inside each cell by clicking on the right column
    for each number in turn (These cells are called test cells).
    Repeat the process to change the state of these cells (white means
    no check, red is used for impossible play and green for possible
    playing). These cells can be filled using the @{"Help" LINK Help} menu, and even
    be updated while filling the grid. As declared previously you
    can also use these cells to play in the current cell of the grid
    using the middle mouse button.
    You can also use a qualifier key (Control, shift or alt) to change
    the state of the test cells while pressing a numeric key (0 will
    erase all test cells, 1 to 9 will change the state of the corresponding
    cell).
@ENDNODE
@NODE Menus "AmiSudoku menus"

    using a custom grid (see @{"Edit game" LINK "Edit game"} menu).

    Keyboard shortcut: Right AMIGA-N (New)
@ENDNODE
@NODE Check "Project menu/Check"
@TOC Project

    This menu is used to check the current grid and display errors (if any).

@NODE Restart "Project menu/Restart"
@TOC Project

@ENDNODE
@NODE Solve "Project menu/Solve"
@TOC Project

    The current grid, including the numbers placed by the player,
    is evaluated, and the solution is displayed, if any.

    If no solution can be found or if there is an error, a requester
    is opened to signal the user. It can be necessary to restart the
    game before solving it.

    Aborting the operation is possible using the ESC key or clicking
    on the window close gadget (perhaps some problems can crash the
    solving routine, please send @{"me" LINK Auteur} the grids that cause any problem).

    A crash can be generated if the stack of the program is too small,
    a value of 50 kB seems to be sufficient to do the job, but try to
    increase it if you experiment some problem using this menu (the
    solve routine is recursive) and please send @{"me" LINK Auteur} a mail to try to
    fix this.

    Keyboard shortcut: Right AMIGA-W

    filled grid and you then can choose what cell you keep. The
    Show easy cells menu can help you to define the difficulty of
    the game.

    You can use the Restart menu to delete all the cells content and

@ENDNODE
@NODE QuickHelp "Help menu/Quick help"
@TOC Help

    This menu entry is used to enabled some extra errors to be viewed and
    some quick clicks.
    Errors are normaly shown when a column, a line or a group has more than
    one same number. But sometimes some cells can't have any number in them
    without creating an error, because all numbers are present in the line,
    the column or the group. The same thing can occur for a line, a column
    or a group, so when this menu is checked, some empty cells can be
    highlighted in red to show these errors.
    The other feature of this menu is to highlight (in green) the cells where
    some numbers can be played : if you click on a locked cell (in grey), all
    the cells that can include the included number will be colored on green.
    Then clicking with middle button while the cell is green will set this
    number in the cell (equivalent in using the @{"Show possible" LINK ShowPossible} menu).
    While using this mode you can also set another number clicking on the
    right column (the selected number is colored in blue).
@ENDNODE
@NODE CellTest "Help menu/Cell test"
@TOC Help

    This menu is used to update test cells (at the right of the grid) by
    hand. Usualy test cells can be colored in white, red or green. White
    means that the cell has not been tested, red means that the number
    can't be played in the selected cell, and green means that the number
    can be played. To change the color, just click with the left mouse
    button on the test cell, each click change the color to the next.
    Each cell of the grid have its own associated test cells state.
    This menu helps the user to fill the content of the test cells
    faster, without looking to the other cells of the grid.

	This menu has 5 entries:
	    @{"Init   " LINK Init}
	    @{"+Column" LINK AddColumn}
	    @{"+Line  " LINK AddLine}
