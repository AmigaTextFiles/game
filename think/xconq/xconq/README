WELCOME TO XCONQ!				XC5.5 3/19/92 EWZ

If you're reading this file, you've found the best multiplayer strategy
game that's come around in a while (ok, maybe of all time).

Xconq 5.5 is the version you have right now and seems fairly stable. 
It's basically four years worth of incremental improvements on my July
1988 5.0 release.

Xconq 6.0 is either a) an "unofficial" version that has been hacked on
is available, or b) what Stan was calling hew new version up until a few
days ago.  Copies of another "6.0" have been reportedly floating around
Europe.

Xconq 7.0 is Stan Shebs' "new" version.  Like Intel's i786 chip, it's not
even close to an alpha product yet.  It will draw upon the past experience
with 5.x, but will be a complete rewrite full of improvements that hope-
fully make it *the* programmable game system of the 90s.

INSTALLATION NOTES

This is the source directory for XCONQ, a multi-player strategy game.
The code herein includes interfaces for curses and X11R4&5.

1. Look at the Imakefile and configure it to suit any of your sys-
tem's quirks.  Imake should be able to figure out most everything,
but there may be a few defines which may have to be set to catch
special cases in the source.

2. Look at config.h and edit as desired.  It contains mainly game
controls.

3. Do "xmkmf" or the appropriate imake command to create a working
Makefile.

4. Do "make depend" to iron out the dependencies between the files.

5. Do:
    "make all" 		to build xconq and cconq.
    "make install"	to install the binaries, library, etc...
    "make install.man" 	to install the man pages.
    "make docs"		to convert the ms documents to readable ASCII.

Read the part of the Imakefile regarding "FONTS".  It gives you important
info regarding the loading of fonts which you need to address.

6. If you installed everything in default places, you're ready to
just do "xconq" or "cconq".  Unless you want to use a hard-to-read
text font in "xconq" you must first set your font path correctly.
See the Imakefile for more info.

7. The man pages just tell how to start up the programs; xconq.ms has
complete details on every aspect of play.  A lot of behavior can be
figured out by experimentation and by using the extensive online help
('?' should always provide something).

8. If installed in a public place, announce availability.  The library
file "xconq.news" provides a convenient place to put in any notes
about changes, new maps/scenarios, and so forth.

9. If you get bored with the standard game, look at "custom.doc",
which tells how to build your own historical periods, maps, and
scenarios.  Many have already been defined; all are in the library
directory.

The program has been tested on lots of different kinds of systems.
Porting to other graphics environments should not be too difficult,
since all the user interface goes through about 50 abstract functions.
(Suntools, Macintosh, and Atari ST would be good candidates.)
Non-Un*x should be straightforward also, since there are only a
handful of Un*x system calls, and none of those are absolutely
required.  Please contact me about any portability problems.

OpenWindows: People seem to have a lot of trouble with OpenWindows.
We expect this is because they are not gods.  If you encounter any
problem with OpenWindows that you solve by changing our code or
installation procedure, TELL US!

  HPUX: (pronounced "HPOX" or "HPsucks") These guys have something
screwy with random and you may have to link with the MIT X library
instead of their installed one.  Earlier versions also didn't have the
strcasecmp function, so uncomment bsd.o from the OBJS line in the
Makefile if you have a problem.  We will have to improve our support
in the future, since HPs look like they're going to stomp Sun into the
ground.

  AIX 3.0: Miraculously, the game compiled without modification.  It
seems that IBM's successes are as surprising as it's screw-ups.

Finally, to repeat what is all over the files, you may copy,
redistribute, modify, or even mangle the code, as long as the
copyright notices are retained, and you don't try to sell it.  Common
decency dictates that you identify your changes before passing the
sources on, and it would help future hackers if you try to maintain
the style and standards of the existing code.  Also I would enjoy seeing
any improvements/fixes/suggestions, and will try to incorporate them in
future versions of XCONQ.

Thanks to the many XCONQ players around the net who have sent in
literally hundreds of suggestions, fixes, and improvements.  The
manual includes more detailed acknowledgments.

XCONQ MAILING LIST

Xconq has a mailing list for xconq players and developers.  The list
includes discussion on anything related to xconq (design, bugs, strat-
egies, etc...).  In addition, patches and new releases will be announced
through the mailing list.  To subscribe to the list, send mail to
"xconq-request":

    Internet: xconq-request@uunet.uu.net
    UUCP:     ...!uunet!xconq-request

To post to the list, send mail to "xconq":

    Internet: xconq@uunet.uu.net
    UUCP:     ...!uunet!xconq-request

Mail to the list is archived on ftp.uu.net in the xconq directory.
Look for the file "mail.Z".

If you have anything that you would like to add to xconq archive on
ftp.uu.net, mail it to xconq-request.

Any binary files should be uuencoded before sending.

HOW TO GET XCONQ

Listed below are sites where you can get the most current release of
xconq.  If this info is outdated, send mail to xconq-request.

By FTP:

    UUNET is the official xconq archive of the 1992 Summer Olympics.
    Any sources or other xconq errata can be usually be found here.

        $ ftp ftp.uu.net
        Name: ftp
        Password: anything (your mail address is preferred)
        ftp> bin
        ftp> cd games/xconq
        ftp> ls

    A copy of the most recent source can also be found at ufl.edu:

        $ ftp ftp.cis.ufl.edu
        Name: ftp
        Password: anything (your mail address is preferred)
        ftp> bin
        ftp> cd pub/empire
        ftp> ls


By UUCP:

    Xconq is accessable from the uunet archives.  Those who are not
    UUNET subscribers can access the archives via UUNET's 900 number.
    (No, it's not a sex line, at least not unless you're a modem. ;^)
    For more information on using the 900 number, mail xconq-request.
        
    Once you are able to access UUNET via UUCP, you can use the fol-
    lowing shell scripts to access files in the archive.

       #!/bin/sh
       # How to get the index of files you can transfer.
       DESTDIR=/usr/spool/uucppublic/xconq
       uucp -d -r -m uunet!~/games/xconq/Index $DESTDIR/Index
   
       #!/bin/sh
       # How to get a bunch of files at once.
       #
       # For the "FILES" variable below, # add any files you want to
       # retrieve.  They should appear below the same as they do in
       # the Index.
       # 
       DESTDIR=/usr/spool/uucppublic/xconq
       FILES='
       README
       '
       for file in $FILES
       do
           uucp -d -r uunet!~/games/xconq/$file $DESTDIR/$file
       done
   
    After executing these shell scripts you can wait for UUCP to
    poll uunet, or you can poll uunet manually:

        uucico -r1 -x1 -suunet

    See the uucp(1) and uucico(8) man pages or a local system
    administrator for further info.

(For further info on how to retrieve files, mail xconq-request)
