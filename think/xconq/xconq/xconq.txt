NAME
       xconq - X-based strategy game

SYNOPSIS
       xconq [ options ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Xconq  is  a multi-player strategic wargame.  Your goal is
       to save the world from the evil empires attempting to take
       over.   You  get cities, armies, airplanes, and ships with
       which to accomplish your task.  Success is achieved by the
       neutralization  or defeat of the other sides, by any means
       available.  First you have to find them!

       Although the game can get complicated, to start  you  need
       only  know  about  the help command '?', which is valid at
       any time.  You start  with  only  one  city,  which  makes
       things  even simpler.  The city will automatically produce
       a military unit,  which  you  will  be  prompted  to  move
       around.   Eventually, you will get more and can attempt to
       take over other cities.  The game keeps going  until  only
       one  side  is left in action; this player is then declared
       the winner.

       By default, xconq starts up with one human (on the display
       in $DISPLAY) and one machine, playing on a randomly gener-
       ated 60x30 world.  Options are available  to  set  numbers
       and kinds of players, as well as the kind of map used.  In
       addition, xconq has extensive and elaborate facilities for
       building  maps, scenarios, and historical periods, result-
       ing in a wide variety of games.

OPTIONS
       host:display
            adds a human player to the game and  assigns  to  the
            given  host  and display.  Players get created in the
            same order as they appear on the command line, inter-
            leaved  with  the players created via -e and -A.  All
            of the player adding options may be used  any  number
            of times in any order.

       -A host:display
            attaches  a  machine  player  to  the  given display.
            Ideal for those who like to watch.

       -C   allows the machine player to play in cheat mode.   It
            will  get a complete update of the screen every turn.

       -e number
            sets the number of machine players  not  attached  to
            displays.    Non-displayed   machine   players   form
            alliance blocks of 5-9 countries.

       -m name
            reads the map named name and starts up a game on  it.

       -M width height
            generates  a  random map of the given size.  The size
            must be at least  5x5,  although  some  periods  will
            impose additional constraints on the lower bound.  In
            theory, there is  no  upper  bound  (but  200x100  is
            huge).

       -p name
            reads  the  historical  period specified by name, and
            sets everything up for that period.

       -r   resets the list of players on the command  line.   It
            is most useful when placed before other player speci-
            fications, to clear out the default players.

       -s name
            reads a scenario with the name name.  A scenario sets
            up  a  particular situation; it has a fixed number of
            sides that can participate.

       -t number
            toggles a chess-clock-like feature  that  limits  the
            total time of play for each side.  The amount is num-
            ber minutes per side.  Time  is  only  counted  while
            actually waiting for input.

       -v   make the entire world seen by all players at the out-
            set.  This is useful if exploration is deemed  to  be
            time-consuming,  or  if  the  map is already known to
            everybody.  Some maps already have this enabled.

       In addition, -B and -D are recognized; see the  customiza-
       tion document for more details.

X DEFAULTS
       Class / name
                 You  may  specify  these resources in your .Xres
                 (or .Xdefaults) using a spec of the form

                     XConq.Class: value

                 or

                     XConq.name: value

                 and you can mix classes and names in  the  spec.
                 This is just standard X resource stuff.

       The  following resources have a prefix of XConq.Map.Period
       / xconq.map.%s

       HexDisplayMode / hexDisplayMode
                 This is  how  xconq  will  display  the  terrain
                 hexes.   Possible values are FullHex, BorderHex,
                 TerrIcons, and BothIcons.

       Background / ownColor
                 The color for your own units.

       Background / alternateColor
                 I forgot

       Background / differentColor
                 Reminders would be appreciated

       Foreground / borderColor
                 It shouldn't be hard to figure out anyway

       Foreground / grayColor
                 but my boss is looking over my shoulder

       Foreground / enemyColor
                 The color of enemy units

       Foreground / neutralColor
                 The color of neutral units

       Foreground / goodColor
                 The color of allied units

       Foreground / badColor
                 And I really shouldn't play this game until I've
                 finished the project

DIAGNOSTICS
       If  a  given  display  cannot  be  opened due to a missing
       xhost(1) command, xconq will quit with  a  message  "Error
       opening display host:0".

       If  the icon fonts cannot be found or opened, text will be
       substituted.  This is usually pretty yucky.

       If the map is too small for the desired number of players,
       xconq will complain about not being able to place units.

       There are some panic messages which usually precede a core
       dump by a few milliseconds.

       Incorrect combinations of periods, maps, and scenarios can
       generate a host of different error messages.

BUGS
       Since some periods/maps/scenarios are interdependent, they
       must be specified in a particular  order  on  the  command
       line (period first usually).

       Does  not  cope gracefully (it doesn't really cope at all)
       with insufficient memory.

       Some annoying behaviors are actually features.

       Feel free to report bugs to xconq@uunet.uu.net.  There are
       people  there  willing  (if not able) to help you.  If you
       wish to listen in on the list you may join by sending mail
       to xconq-request@uunet.uu.net.
