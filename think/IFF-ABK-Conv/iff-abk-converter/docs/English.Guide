 At first I wanne say sorry again for my f..ing english  !  Here  comes  the
 Converter  for  the Game GermanJack V1.0. Now you can make your own Cardset
 for the Game in IFF-Format and this tool will change it into the right Size
 and into the ABK-Format.

                           How I use the Converter

 At first the Program ask you what Language you wanne use.  Click  with  the
 Mouse  on  the  right  Flag.  Then  you  must answer if you wanne load your
 finnished Cardset one Bob by one Bob ore all Bobs together in one Pic (this
 depent on what you have used for change the Cards).
 Answer with "o" ore "a" !
 If you have answer with "a" (thats the easy way), then  a  Requester  opens
 and  wanne know the way to the Pic "IFF.AllBobs". Its the best to copy this
 Pic and give him another Name. After this you can  load  your  changed  Pic
 into the Converter.

 IMPORTANT: Don`t change the Size of the Bobs ! You only can  do  this  with
 the Option "o" !

 After a few Seconds a new Requester will open and you  must  save  now  the
 converted  Bobs called "Bobs.abk". Its the best to save it in the same Path
 like the Game GermanJack (under the Drawer  CARDS).  Its  possible  to  use
 another Name for the Datas, if you have create more Cardsets !

                      ---------------------------------

 If you create Cardsets for the Game GermanJack  V1.0  and  put  it  on  the
 Aminet  into  the  Drawer Game/Think, then you don`t must pay the SHARE for
 the Game !
 The SHARE is 8 US-$ ore 10 German Mark !

                      ---------------------------------

 Here now the Explain for Users, who wanne change the  Size  of  the  Cards.
 Answer  the  2. Question after starting the Converter with "o". Now you can
 type in the Size for x and for y.
 Never use greater Sizes like x=58 and y=98. This  will  the  Converter  not
 accept.  All  other  Sizes  will he acceppt, because there is no Problem to
 show the Cards into the Game.
 If you don`t type anything in, the Converter  will  use  the  Standard-Size
 (x=58, y=98).
 After this Procedure a Requester will open and wanne know the Path  to  the
 first Pic called "7.1" (it`s in the Drawer IFF-Cards).

 IMPORTANT: Take the right path and the right Pic, all other  will  finished
 in a Error. And only the Size of the Pic "About" is not changeable !

 Now the Converter load the IFF-Cards one by one (he  do  it  alone  !)  and
 after  this  Work  a new Requester opens and ask you, where he must put the
 convertet Datas called now "Bobs.abk". You can use also  another  Name  for
 the Datas, if you have create more Cardsets.

 And remeber: If you got a Option to put your Cardset on the Aminet into the
 Drawer  Game/Think,  then  do  it,  because we all wanne have Fun with your
 Cardset too, and you don`t must pay your SHARE for the Game !
