@node "Short tale" "A short tale"
 Some days ago my brother borrowed a portable Pc with Windows inside. He was
very happy for his computer and was going to tell me: "What, an Amiga?". I
was angry, since I think thare's nothing better than an Amiga, but he
doesn't know it. And he played with his Pc for a lot of time, so I asked
him: "What are you doing with that crap?". He was playing a game called
"Minefield" and he said: "It's really very nice!!". I watched it for a
moment and I replied: "Eh, eh, eh, I could do it in few hours...!". He
didn't believe me and do I wanted to show him that it was possible. It was
about 9 o'clock of the nigth and the next morning I called him telling:
"Come on, play now!".

Of course, now the pc is in the house of its owner and my friend always
plays with MANOS on my Amiga!!


Another tale? Well, I had to choice a name for this new program; so I went
to my mother asking her a name. In Italy, when you want an help, you ask for
a mano (hand). My mother told be that she could have given me even both her
hands, and so I took the idea for the name: one mano....two manos (even if
in Italian the plural is not done in this way!).


A lst tale?  Let's say about shareware. I think it's a very good thing, much
better than commercial productions since the price is far lower and
sometimes the value is higher. By the way, someone think that Shareware
means free: IT'S NOT TRUE! But now, I want to make Manos a PD program. This
means it's totally FREE, you can copy it as much as you want and you can
give it to anyone. But you cannot change the program in any way and this doc
must be in the same archive.

And if you want to support with money.... then you're welcome anyway!!!

@node "Requirements" "Requirements"
 Requirements to run Manos:

     - Amiga computer, of course!

     - OS 2.0 or higher

     - reqtools.library in your libs: directory


Manos saves the best score in a file called Best_score_MANOS in s:, but you
don't need it. If it doesn't exist, Manos will create one.


But, not just, you ALSO need:

     - Intelligence

     - Skill

     - Speed

     - Good reflexes

     - ...and so on!!

@node "Instructions" "How to play"
 Manos is a very easy game. When you load it, it opens a window on the
workbench screen with 2 gadgets and the minefield. Clicking on Info, another
request will pop up asking you what you want to know; click on Start, you
begin a new game (the first time you don't need to click it).

Now, game started...

You can click both the left and the right button of your mouse, pointing a
box on the minefield. The rigth button leaves a cross on the box and doen't
anything else. You can use these to remember where the bombs are. You can
use no more than 16 crosses since as many are the bombs themselves. If you
click twice on the same box with the right button, the cross is deleted. The
left button allows you to "check" if there's a bomb. If you click on a
"bombed" box, the game is over and you're out; otherwise, a number will be
written on the box, showing you how many bombs are next (even diagonally) to
that box. The zero value is not displayed, but Manos itself will "click" on
the close boxes to allow you to save time.

The importarnt thing is to finish the game as fast as you can; if you make
the best time, a new window will be opened to ask your name: enter it and
close the window. The name with your time is saved in Best_score_of_Manos in
your s: directory.


The clock starts just when you click for the first time on the field, and
not when you click on the Start button. There is no pause, since you could
use it to think about your next moviment.

 I want to thank a lot of people for helping me, not just making Manos!

Here's a short list:


Stefano Berionne  (my brother)   : By the way, the idea is from you!!

Francois Lionet (author of Amos) : Please, come back to Amiga and to Amos!!

Andy Church (author of @{"Intuition" link "Intuition" 0}): Your extension is still the best!!

Fabio Chiechi (friend)           : Study less and program more!

Chris Hodges (author of AMCAF)   : I don't know why...

Arturo Ortino (author of Ital)   : Please, speed up your job.

Roberto Pratesi (sysop of Amp)   : No words, but just THANX: u're the best!

Michael Cox (administer of list) : Some problems in last months: fantastic!

.....

.....

You (yes, just you!)             : For reading this doc!!



O.K.: they could be enogh for this small and easy game!

@node "Intuition" "Intuition extension"
 Manos is made totally in Amos; so now a lot (?) of you could ask me: and
how can it work on an intuition screen then?

The answer is INTUITION extension by Andy Church. It opens a new great world
for the powerful Amos: the world of intuition screens and windows!

But let me show you what Angy hiself write about:

<< Although AMOS is an excellent language, with hundreds of commands for
graphics, sound, I/O, and much more, it has had, until now, one serious
lack: support for Intuition, the Amiga's native graphics system.  The
Intuition Extension fills this gap. The Intuition Extension was designed as
an interface between AMOS and Intuition.  Most of the commands included,
therefore, function almost identically to AMOS commands.  For most
instructions, you can simply add an "I" in front of the instruction to make
it work with Intuition rather than the AMOS graphics system.  However,
additional Intuition- specific instructions have been included, so that AMOS
programmers can take full advantage of the Intuition graphical interface.

Private to Andy Church:

Hello Andy, don't worry about the new OS-DevKit extension: you one is still
the best. And to show you it, watch this simple game!

When the next version of it?

 First of all, HELLO!!!

Then, THANKS!!!

Now...

Also on Internet at:   Michele_Berionne@amp.flashnet.it


Please, let me know what you think about Manos, if you found bugs or ideas
to improve it!

    Thank you.


Other programs by me are: Fantasy (shoot'em up reviewed on AR with ***)
                          Atoms   (a newer version is being out in next
days)
                          Tetris  (you know what it is, don't you?)
                          In the target (another shoot'em up)
                          Naval battle  (a think game against computer)

Write me if you want them or just infos about.


But then the most important one: @{b}LOGO v1.4@{ub}
                                 ^^^^^^^^^

Logo is a powerful programming language with more than 70 commands and all
the structures of the most important languages (like C, E and AMOS, of
course!) such as procedures, loops, If statements and so on.

If you want the demo version of it, please let me know.
