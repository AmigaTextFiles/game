@NODE HISTORY "History"
This is release V1.1a of Virus Attack.  VAttack has never been released to
the public only locally.  VAttack was completed in 1992 and was submitted
to AmigaWorld tool chest and they have accepted with conditional
modification to VAttack for faster CPUs.  VAttack was never released and
so here it is all free.

V1.1a Enhancements  May 18, 1994
--------------------------------

 o Made it WB 2.x compatible, although it works for some OS2 machines but
   not others.

 o Fixed the random background selection, before it always play the same
   background FX.

V1.1 Enhancements
-----------------
 o add MED modules or sound FX option
 
 o better joystick control
 
 o minor bug fixes

Bugs
----
1. It seems that sometime Virus Attack wouldn't lanuch correctly under
   workbench, if that's the case just type VAttack at the shell prompt.
   
2. If you have a screen blanker running, make sure that you disable it
   before running Virus Attack.
   
3. For programming error or whatever (might as well be a virus) but it
   seems that sometimes it will allow you to go on to the next stage even
   thought there is one virus left to kill (a bonus to you guyz an galz)

@NODE INTRO "Intro"
VAttack Objectives                                

   The object of VAttack is to seek and destroy all viruses.  To
do so you must gather the same colour of pills as the virus in
order to kill it.  You must need at least 2 full pills.  Pills
come in different colours, some are one colour and some are
different colours, so you must rearrange them in order to make
the 2 required pills to kill a virus.  The only way to kill the
virus is to stack the pills vertically or put the pills
horizontally across, in either case you must have at least 2
complete pills.  However you could kill multiple viruses using
only 1 or half a pill.  If the viruses for example stacked two
vertically, you will only need one full pill to kill it.
   Once all the viruses all destroyed, you will advance to the
next stage with more viruses and a faster pace.  The game ends
when a pill reaches the top.

Joystick Controls                                

   VAttack requires a joystick in port2 not the mouse port.     

   FIRE  - rotates pill
   LEFT  - move pill to the left
   RIGHT - move pill to the right
   DOWN  - move pill down
   UP    - pause game until UP is pressed again
          
Viruses

   Each completed level the next level will be more viruses. 
Take note that there are some Super Smart viruses, these viruses
disguises as a different coloured virus thus you must kill it
with the right coloured pill.  There maybe more than one Super
Smart virus.  The maximum viruses per level is 60 viruses and the
minium is 1 virus.

Scoring

  50  points for a completed pill
 100  points for killing 1 virus
 400  points for killing 2 viruses
 900  points for killing 3 viruses
1600  points for killing 4 viruses
2500  points for killing 5 viruses
3600  points for killing 6 viruses
4900  points for killing 7 viruses   
6400  points for killing 8 viruses 
      
Selecting Starting Level

   When you first loaded VAttack, you are given a music type option.  Move
the joystick to the LEFT for MED modules or move the joystick to the 
RIGHT for sound FX.
   During a new game, you are given a choice to start at a given
level.  Valid levels are 1 to 31 and increments of 2 levels each
step.  To increase the current level, move the joystick to the
right, and to decrease the current level move the joystick to the
left.  The higher the level, the more viruses and speed also
increases.  Press the fire button to start at the current level. 
   
Game Over                                        

   When any of the pill reaches the top, the game ends.  To start
a new game, press the fire button.  This will take you to the
level selection screen.  Select the level and press fire button
to restart.  To quit the game and exist to WorkBench, simply move
the joystick in any direction except the fire button.

Entering Hiscore Name

   VAttack keeps the best 10 scores of all times.  If the hiscore
file is not on the current directory, then a new hiscore file is
created.  Use the joystick left and right to move around the
alphabet.   Press fire button to select that letter.   Use rub if
you have made a mistake, and select end to save your name.

Background MED music 

   You can change the background music in VAttack by renaming
your MOD file to 'med.song'.  VAttack only excepts MED modules thus
you must load the MOD file into MED and save it as a MODULE file if the
MOD is not a MED type.
        
Note: If the screen goes blank then turn off your screen blanker
before playing or just simply press the space bar when that
happens.
