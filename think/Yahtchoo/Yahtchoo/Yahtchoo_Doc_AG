@node PLAY "The Game"

@{fg shine}Playing Yahtchoo.@{fg text}

    Once loaded, you will be confronted with the intro screen of Yahtchoo.
This is where you press @{fg shine}"1"@{fg text} for a one-player game, @{fg shine}"2"@{fg text} for a two-player game,
or @{fg shine}"Q"@{fg text} to quit back to workbench.

    The rules of Yahtchoo are pretty easy, and if you've ever played Yahtzee
before, you'll pick it up in no time.  It is basically a conversion when
all's said and done!

    If you want to take a look at the rules though, click @{"here." Link RULES}

@endnode

@node RULES "The Player"

@{fg shine}The rules of Yahtchoo.@{fg text}

    In each turn, a player is allowed a @{b}maximum@{ub} of three rolls of the dice,
although you may elect to stop after your first or second goes.

    For the first roll, all five dice are thrown.  For subsequent (2nd and 3rd)
rolls, any or all of the dice may be thrown again.  To hold a die,
just click with the left mouse button on it, and a @{fg shine}"HELD"@{fg text} marker will
appear above it.  If you change your mind, clicking on the die again will
remove the @{fg shine}"HELD"@{fg text} marker, and the die will be rolled again on your next go.

    The player need not declare which category they are attempting to score
under and may change their mind at any time.

    The players' turn ends after the third roll of the dice, or when the
@{fg shine}"End Turn"@{fg text} button is clicked on.  A score must then be placed in a free
category on the score pad.


@{fg shine}Scoring.@{fg text}

    To actually place a score on the scorecard, the player must click with
the left mouse button on the corresponding button under the @{fg shine}"CATEGORIES"@{fg text}
heading down the centre of the screen.  The computer will then
automatically award the appropriate score.

    In the upper section of the scorecard, there are six categories from
@{fg shine}"ACES"@{fg text} up to @{fg shine}"SIXES"@{fg text}.  After completing his/her turn, a player may place
a score in the @{fg shine}"THREES"@{fg text} box (for example) which will count and add ONLY
those dice which have rolled a 3.  Simple as that.

    In the lower section there are a further seven categories.  These are
all explained separately below...


@{fg shine}3 OF A KIND@{fg text}   - If three of your dice show the same
                number, entering a score here will
                add the numbers on ALL of your dice.

@{fg shine}4 OF A KIND@{fg text}   - As above, but a score will only be
                placed under this category if 4 of
                your dice show the same number.

@{fg shine}FULL HOUSE@{fg text}    - If your dice are showing three of one
                number and two of another you will
                score 25 points.

@{fg shine}LOW STRAIGHT@{fg text}  - If you have a run of FOUR
                consecutive numbers, you will score
                30 points.

@{fg shine}HIGH STRAIGHT@{fg text} - As above, but a run of FIVE
                consecutive numbers which will score
                40 points.

@{fg shine}YAHTZEE!@{fg text}      - The ultimate of all combinations.
                If all FIVE dice show the same
                number, you will receive 50 points!

@{fg shine}CHANCE@{fg text}        - This merely adds up all of your
                dice and awards a score equal to the
                total.


    At the end of each turn, a player @{b}must@{ub} choose a category to score under
before proceeding.  A player can place a zero in any of the free categories
if they believe it to be to their advantage...but choose wisely.  When
nearing the end of a game, you may not want to risk having to get a @{fg shine}"YAHTZEE"@{fg text}
on one of your last throws, as the chances are slim, so if a situation
arises where you @{b}must@{ub} place a zero in either, say, the @{fg shine}"TWOS"@{fg text} category or
the @{fg shine}"YAHTZEE"@{fg text} category, it would be safer to put the zero in @{fg shine}"YAHTZEE"@{fg text},
giving you the chance to score a few more points under @{fg shine}"TWOS"@{fg text} with your
next throw.


@{fg shine}Further points regarding "Yahtzee"s.@{fg text}

    In the original game, a YAHTZEE BONUS was available if two or more
YAHTZEEs were thrown in one game.

    Also, a further YAHTZEE throw could be used as a joker under certain
circumstances.

    HOWEVER!!! - These features have not been included in Yahtchoo!

uploaded to the above page.  The date of each game will be shown on the home

later version to the one you have.
