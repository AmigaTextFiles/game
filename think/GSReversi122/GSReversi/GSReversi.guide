 @{b}System Requirements@{ub}
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 An Amiga?

 Well, You need OS 2.0 or better to play the game. If you don't have
 a harddisk you have to wait a few second for the game to load the
 choosed background, so if you want to change the background without
 waiting, I think you have to buy a harddisk.
 To get the best view of the MagicWB icon you must have the MagicWB
 colours (MagicWB by Martin Hutterloher). I think this is all you need
 to play GSReversi painless.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 GSReversi is very simple to install and uninstall, just copy the
 files to the directory you want to have the game. But you MUST
 include all the original files in the directory (see @{"Product Facts" LINK "Product"}).
 When someday want to delete GSReversi from your disk/harddisk you
 just delete the files in the directory and then the directory.

 @{b}Rules@{ub}
 ~~~~~
 In the start both players have two pieces each in the middle of the
 board. First Player1 puts a piece then Player2 and so on. When a player
 puts one of his pieces in the same line as one of his own with the other
 player's pieces between, all pieces will be changed to his colour.
 The lines can be horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
 One player can take pieces in several lines in different directions at
 the same time.

 The game ends when nobody can put a piece. The player who got the most
 pieces of his own colour at the end wins.

@NODE "Description" "Window descripition"
@TOC "MAIN"

 @{b}Window description@{ub}
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 In the top-right corner is the two player's name, rating and time.
 A raster indicating the player's color is beneath the player's stats.

 Under the two player's stats is four boxes. The upper two of the boxes
 is for player one the lower for player two. The left of the boxes means
 wins and the rightmost is the current number of pieces the player has.

 To the right of the score is a piece showing who's turn it is.

 Under the score and the turn piece is two symbols.
 An eye meaning about, and a trashcan symbolizing new or resign.

 @{b}Single Game:@{ub}
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 In a Single game two players play against each other. The game can be
 played in one, three or five rounds. If you choose "Best of One" the
 game won't end.
 
 @{b}League Game:@{ub}
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 A League Game is a game with 2 to 8 players where everbody meets everbody
 in one to three rounds. The player who gets most points wins.


 @{b}Tournament Game:@{ub}
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 In a tournament the player who gets most points in 1-3 games continues to
 next game and the other player is out of the tournament.
 A tournament needs 2, 4 or 8 players.

 A gain is worth 2 points, a draw 1 point and a loss 0 points.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Time" "Time Setup"
@TOC "MAIN"

 @{b}Time Setup@{ub}
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 There are three different kinds of 'None', 'Move', 'Game'.
 If you have chosen @{b}Move@{ub} each player will get the time before each move.
 When choosing @{b}Game@{ub} the time will countdown from the first move.
 If any player runs out of time he has lost the game.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Player" "Player Setup"
@TOC "MAIN"

 @{b}Player Setup@{ub}
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 In the Player Setup, Players and Computers are chosen. Every Player in
 the Player Setup has a rating, a number telling the level of the player.
 When a new player is created the rating is 1000. When the player plays
 against another rated player or computer, the ratings is increased if he
 wins - decreased if he loses.
 If a high-rated player wins against a low-rated player he gets few points.
 But if he has less rating than his opponent he gets plenty of points.
