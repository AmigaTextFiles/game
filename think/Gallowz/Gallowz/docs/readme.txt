Playing the game
----------------
It's hangman, man! If you don't know how to play hangman, here's a brief
explaination....

The computer will select a word or phrase. Using the letter buttons on the
left hand side of the window, it's your job to try and guess what the
computer has chosen. If you choose a letter which is not in the selection,
the little guy in the middle of the window will be one step closer to death
by hanging. You're allowed to make 11 mistakes. The twelfth mistake will
be the end for your little friend.

You score points each time you get a letter right. Should a letter be in the
phrase more than once, you'll score 5 points for the first occurence, 10
for the second, 15 for the third... for example, if the letter "s" is in
the phrase four times, you'll score 50 points (5+10+15+20).

Get the puzzle right WITHOUT making a mistake, you get a whopping 1000 point
bonus. Each mistake you do make will reduce the bonus. Your mission (should
you choose to download it) is to score as many points as possible.

Two film related datafiles are supplied, along with four football related
files. An editor will be released soon to allow you to create your own. I
built the files with an early beta, but I'm not prepared to release that
yet.

Problems?
---------
This game was developed on an '060 and uses GadTools. It's been tested
(successfully) under WinUAE. Shouldn't be any problems, but if there are,
e-mail me with a description of what you were doing and what went wrong.

he'd also like to thank Natalie Semikina for reminding him that projects
CAN be finished.
