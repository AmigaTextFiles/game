@{b}Briscola @{ub}(in English: Trump) is a traditional italian card game. 
It is played with a @{"40 cards deck" link CARDS} between two or four players.
In this version of the game it is only possible to play in two, human versus 
computer.

The @{"rules" link RULES} are easy and a good memory is needed to play well
of course this is not a problem for the computer player ;)

The game has been tested on an Amiga 1200 and it should work on any Amiga with
at least WorkBench 2.0.

@{b}Briscola @{ub} is played with a @{"40 cards deck" link CARDS}, between two players.
A the beginning of the game each player is given tree cards, the last card
of the deck lies on the table facing up and the remaining cards are put 
upon it, but still leaving it visible. The suit of this card is the 
@{i}"Briscola" @{ui} i.e. the trump or atout of the match.

The first player plays a card, and the second follow him. He who played the 
trump of highest value gets both cards and put them in his deck. If neither 
player played a trump, (i.e. a card of the same suit of the last card of 
the deck) there are two cases:

If the second player played a card of the same suit of the first player, 
who played the highest card will get both cards

Otherwise the first player gets the cards.

Who takes the cards get the first card of the deck, the other player
gets the next, so that both players got exactly three cards in their hand.
Who got the cards has to play another card and the match continues until all 
the cards of the deck (including the last) are been taken, and then the last 
three cards of each players will be played, according to the rules above.

The player who scores at least 121 points in two matches wins the game.

The card set present with the game could look @{i}strange@{ui} to who doesen't 
know it. So, if you want, you may change it.
The card set is read in a standard IFF file called "carte.iff". In the file
provided with the game it is present the "sicilian" card set. It is
possible to substitute this file with another, by example, a french card
set. 
Colors 0 to 3 are used for the rendering of the screen and the windows,
colors 4 to 31 may be freely changed. 
Designing a new cardset you should preserve the position and size of cards
and put the back card on the first position of the fifth row.
