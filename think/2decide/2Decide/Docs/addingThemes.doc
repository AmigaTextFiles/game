This file introduces the
game directory structure,
and how to make a new theme.


the directories:
----------------

campaigns/
----------

 contains missions within campaign
 directories on every theme.
 
data/
-----

 contains unused data.

graphics/
---------

 Units and map terrain gfx is contained
 in 8x8 pixel invisible boxes.
  if you are editing these boxes, make sure no
 gfx is drawn outside the boxes.
  the unit gfx needs to be positioned in ascending
 order from the unit text files in units/theme?/

saves/
------

 here are the savefile(s),
 and any savefile saved with the map editor.

structures/
-----------

 Has information of places
 that create units.
 It does not need to be defined
 as "structure".
 It could just aswell be called a hole
 in the ground, the themes decide this.

themeinfo/
----------

 name and description of the different themes.

units/
------

 single files within a theme?/ directory
 containing unit specifications,(attack/movement),
 are loaded in ascending order,
 and will be displayed in that order ingame.
  If there is a gap between the unit numbers,
 then only those before the gap will be included ingame.



the same filetypes are put togheter
to make multiple editings easier on my behalf.


adding rules:
-------------

you cannot name your files like you want
and throw them in there, but need to
number and path your files correct.

you can assign a theme any number,
but preferably shortly after
the other themes.

all text files must have
Amiga style line endings (CR),
not Windows style (CRLF).
 Some text files,
should not have too many lines.
 Campaign and mission briefings
with its -overview- and -mission-
should not have more than about 20.

Ilbm picture files can not have
comments in them. And cannot
have stencil data in them.

tips:
-----

if you want to make your own theme
this is -one- way to do it

1.Start with copying all files of an existing theme
  and assign them an other number.
  so that you can do whatever you want with them.

2.load the theme gfx file (graphics/theme?)
  into your favourite paint package wich must
  support 8bit bitmaps. I use Personal Paint.
  don't bother about the unit gfx, but concentrate
  on drawing terrain as a first approach.
  the 4 terrain boxes that is added to the right
  of the other terrain boxes, is just for variation
  when displaying the terrain ingame, so if you
  have drawn the one box on the left, you can just
  copy it to the others.

 about the terrain boxes:
  the box is rarer displayed on the map
  the more it is to the right,
  so variative terrain details can be add,
  but note that they will standout much more
  than you think.

3.Don't draw straight into the boxes, but rather copy
  the boxes from their position, onto an unused area
  on the screen before changing it.

4.if you like your gfx a bit, but is not fully satisfied,
  don't just continue on it, but backup it elsewhere
  on the screen first.

5.when you have an idea what the setting of your theme is,
  then start drawing a unit, and design its statistics
  in its text file (units/theme?/?).
  don't bother about the morale gfx of each unit yet.

6.My method when I want to create all the different
  versions of one unit, is that I;
  1.grab hilited (grey) unit and copy to all the other boxes
    by using arrow keys while being zoomed in.
  2.select "Tint" operator in PPaint, and select the same
    foreground color as background color.
  3.now when using this Tint operator,
    it will convert any gfx into a fade of the color you selected.
  but you can have the different gfx versions
  in any way you want! maybe a colored flag, or just
  colored stripes... imagination is the limit.
   It is less work to do this if you draw more grey
  units first, as you can do the Tinting on several at once. 

7.when you have added some units, go for
  creating a name and description for your theme.

8.if you consider your designed units permanent,
  then draw the morale gfx of them,
  maybe just add "hats" on them.
  note that you do not have to use humans in your theme.
  you are free to use whatever animal or alien creature
  you want.
  alltho' you do not need to stick to "lifeforms" ;)
  


You can test your theme anytime,
even if there is no gfx somewhere.
that gfx would just not show.

If you want 2Decide to support new features
so that your new theme can use them,
then do not hesitate to ask the author.
 2Decide is very modular
specifically to allow ppl to make cool themes,
so its easy to add new theme options!

when you have made a theme,
then pls don't keep it to yourself,
but share it
with everyone else that has this game.
