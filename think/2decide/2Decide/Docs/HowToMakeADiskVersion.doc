Copy these dirs (with all their files) to the disk:

campaigns
graphics
miscgraphics
saves
structures
themeinfo
units

Copy these root files to the disk:

2Decide.exe
lha
runfromdisk
runfromdisk.info


If I recall correctly
you still have to load workbench on a separate disk
before running 2Decide from its disk.
