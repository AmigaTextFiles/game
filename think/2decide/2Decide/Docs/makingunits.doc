units have their gfx in theme graphic
files in "graphics/theme?"

unit nr 1 has its gfx above all the other units
unit nr 2 has its gfx right underneath unit nr 1
unit nr 3 has its gfx right underneath unit nr 2
etc...

you can simply extend the height
of the bitmap when you want more units
that will go below the 256 pixel height.


unit stats that are 0, does not need to
be included in the unit text file,
but I include them for orderly sake.

all values/texts must be directly benath
the UPPERCASE:

NAME:
the units name that will be shown ingame

PRODUCTIONTIME:
how many rounds it needs when in production

MOVEMENT:
how many cells it can move per turn

CANWAIT:
;1=can wait
;0=can wait in friendly structures, or unit types that can carry them.
;  ie: an eartlhy airplane should have this set to 0

CANNOTWAITTEXT:
-If I can wait, then I will never need to say this ingame.

ATTACKPOWER:
battle strength of unit when attacking.
maybe considering element of surprise.

DEFENCEPOWER:
battle strength of unit when being attacked

CANINVADE:
if it can invade structures, 0=no 1=yes

GRUMPYTEXT:
used when the player wants to attack,
but the units morale is too low.
feel free to avoid english. ;)
3 <-- how many lines added below, max 10.
      0 means the unit cannot get grumpy.
-no, we have had enough.
-maybe later!

above 0 means it depends on fuel.
and will be (re)fueled to that point.

the power and accuracy of ranged attacks

or how easy it is to hit it (little)

like a construction vehicle (CV)

CANBECARRIED:
0=cannot be carried by any transport units
1=can be carried by transport units
defaults to 1 if not included in unit text file.

ARMOUR:
from 0 to 100. Max 100. Measured in percentage.
Armour means how tough a unit is in a battle.
A high value means it will lose less energy in every battle. 
Armour feature can also be used to make wall units
that doesnt break easily.


check any unit text files
for better understanding.


when you have made a units stats and gfx,
then you may add the unit number
to a structures CANMAKEUNITS:
 but it is not neccessary,
because the unit can still be
added with the mapeditor,
and appear in (some) custom games.
