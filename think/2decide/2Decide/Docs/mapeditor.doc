very needed help to use the editor:


when any of the following keys
are pressed, they act on the cell
under the mouse, and on all units in it.
 to not cause havoc on the map,
the actions are delayed a bit.


::terrain::
0 and 1 on numeric pad,
or left mousebutton,
changes terrain type while holding
down the key. It has nearly no delay
to allow quick filling easier.


::misc objects::
m cycles object (and disables)


::structures::
s creates a new structure
t changes structure type
c changes structure belonging (color)
x remove structure


::units::
n adds a new (type 1) unit
u changes units type
b changes units belonging (color)
d deletes all units in the cell
-top left number keys;
1 freeze units
3 enprison units


If you want
it to be a mission,
you should select an appropriate
mission type in the menu.

The "start & save" menuitem
will prepare and save the mission
and will be untouched by the game.

Name it the mission number
and then just move it
to your campaign dir.
