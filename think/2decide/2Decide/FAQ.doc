game:

Q: I don't know how to drop the units from the transport.

A: move over valid terrain, and click on the transport.
a list of units are displayed, with the carried units,
wich can be activated with a click on it,
provided there is valid terrain beneath.


map editor:


Q: maps have no fog of war.

A: the "start and save" menuitem adds fog of war.

the save and load within the map editor
is to allow a way of handling
the maps "cleanly" without letting the game
'mess' it up.


misc:

Q: I have played a while,
and my fingers don't feel good.

A: This is common.
Stretch out your arm(s) infront of you,
then point your fingers upwards towards
the ceiling. I read that one should bend
as much as one can, but I just bend them
till they won't go further.
Hold them there for about 5 seconds,
then lower your fingers and make a fist,
for then to bend this fist down towards
the floor, and hold for about 5 seconds. 
Rise fingers, and repeat sequence if you
feel you should.
 I don't know exactly what it does,
but it helps alot.


problems:

Q: There is no color fading,
and there are random graphical bugs.
It also crashes alot, and my head hurts.

A: It seems you are using an Amiga emulator.
One solution is to use a real AGA Amiga.
