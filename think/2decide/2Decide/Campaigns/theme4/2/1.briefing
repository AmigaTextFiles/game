-OVERVIEW-

I have played this
so many times now.
All my units get killed
every time...

I know that the enemy
units are very close
to eachother, and
never moves anywhere.

when I move each unit in
to attack, they get killed
mostly by ranged attacks.

-MISSION-

my units are a bit
scattered around,
but atleast they can
move, unlike the enemy.

others say this scenario
is easy,
what am I doing wrong?
