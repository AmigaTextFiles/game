-OVERVIEW-

The Attacker unit
comes short when it
is being attacked,
 but when itself attacks,
then it shows
its true power.

There are 2
enemy Attacker units
in this mission.
 but don't worry,
they won't attack you
as they are frozen
to their position.

-MISSION-

take the
neutral generator.

you might have to attack
one of the enemy units.
but remember that an
Attacker unit is always
stronger when it attacks,
but is weak when it
has to defend.
