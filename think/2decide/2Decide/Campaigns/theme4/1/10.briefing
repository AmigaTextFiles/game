-OVERVIEW-

Sometimes,
a mission's goal may not
be to strike the enemy,
but to let the enemy win.

It sounds strange,
but it could have a meaning
in some situations.

-MISSION-

Try to act as stupid
as possible to ensure
that you lose. 

note that it is possible
for your units to win
this scenario,
but your goal is to lose.
