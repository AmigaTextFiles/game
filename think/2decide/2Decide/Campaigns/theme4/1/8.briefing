-OVERVIEW-

Ground units that
are trapped on islands
with no enemies,
are wasting time,
unless the island has
a strategic value.

Therefore it is
important to get your
units to places where
they are needed.

For this we need
transport units.

-MISSION-

onto a Transport,
just move into it.

moving the transport
into valid ground
Unloads the unit.

Use your Transports
to locate and kill
the few enemy units.
