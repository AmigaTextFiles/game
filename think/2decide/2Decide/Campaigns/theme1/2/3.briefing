-OVERVIEW-
  
Our numbers
outweighed these
weakly defended cities
filled with foreign
and "superior" people.

Now that we have control
of most cities in our
country, we can start
organizing our forces.
  
And not least,
grow food
instead of tea.

-MISSION-
   
The "superiors"
does not like
what we have done
at all,
so we expect internal,
aswell as external,
resistance.

We cannot stop
our liberty now.
