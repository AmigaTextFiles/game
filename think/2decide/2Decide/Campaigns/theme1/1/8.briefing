-OVERVIEW-

As you are about to start
a new simulation,
the tall man rushes in
and says that you must
come to the control room.

'but, its my day off'
you say.

'Its an emergency!
you must come!'

-MISSION-

'Enemy units are about
to invade our big cities
on this outlet.'

'We have sent
reinforcements,
but it may be too late.'

'Try to remove the enemy
from this important
area. We are counting on
you.
I know you can do it!'
