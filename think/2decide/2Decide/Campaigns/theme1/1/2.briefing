-OVERVIEW-

'I didn't expect you to 
do that well on your first
assignment, so I want
you to have more challenging
missions from now on.'

'The enemy has scattered
artillery units in this
area.
This is probably to defend
the strategical position
of this outskirt.'

-MISSION-

'If we let them go on,
they might get an upperhand
later, so We need to act
now or never while they
are still lightly protected.'

'find, and destroy
these artilleries.'
