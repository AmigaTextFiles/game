-NAME-
The Feelings of Memories.
-OVERVIEW-

The bed is not very
comfortable as you wake up.

you don't
remember anything...

but your head feels
like its in complete order.

a tall man enters,
and wants you to
come with him.
    
-SUPREME MISSION-
   
he leads you to a
big room with displays
of all kinds.

few people are here.

he points you to a
small screen in the corner,
and somehow you know
exactly what you need
to do next.
