-OVERVIEW-

Unfortunately,
fellow comrades
didn't make it.

Endless walking
made Morale weaker,
and even though we
encouraged,
some turned
to surrender.
 
After long,
our enemy trackers
seemed gone,
and we finally got
to our base.

-MISSION-

There, we told lies
of how we fought
our way out
with just our bare hands.

But calm down
we had to do later,
as we suddenly
heard a loud bang.
