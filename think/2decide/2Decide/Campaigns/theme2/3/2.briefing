-OVERVIEW-
  
The hower bikes
gave us a good beatup,
 but the escape
was succesfull.

The journey was long,
and the Battle orb
had ran out of fuel,
so the path suddenly
looked much longer
now that we were on
our feet.

Hope rised when we
spotted a hidden base.
Strange thing,
it seems empty...

-MISSION-

Investigate base.
