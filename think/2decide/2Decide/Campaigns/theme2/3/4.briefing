-OVERVIEW-

Unfortunately,
the enemy equipment
revealed that they
had been able to
contact their base.

Wether the enemy would
come to us or not,
remained unanswered.
 But we did not
take any chances.

We instructed the
robotic machines
to make us Hower bikes
and fled the base...
just in time... 

-MISSION-

Flee from
the approaching
enemy group.
