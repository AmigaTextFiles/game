-NAME-
Lucky escape
-OVERVIEW-

The alarm sounded
as we ran out to
freedom.

There was little
resistance when we
were running to
find a vehicle.

There,
big as it was,
an unguarded
Battle orb.
    
-SUPREME MISSION-
   
The controls were
a bit tricky at first,
but very easy
once we figured out
what was forward.  

The speed and
acceleration astonished
as we set our path back
to our allies.
