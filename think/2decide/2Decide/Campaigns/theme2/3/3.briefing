-OVERVIEW-

Empty was not the
right word when
we found some people
trapped inside the
various buldings.

They soon became
our friends.

Hope did not prevail
as we spotted enemy
troops searching for us.
 We never thought
they would go this far.

If they found us,
they could not be allowed
to tell any others.

-MISSION-

Kill enemy search party.
