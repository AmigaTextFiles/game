-OVERVIEW-

We found a long
passage that seem
to lead to their
hideout.
 However, when our
troops had been following
it a while,
they were met with
fire from all around.

It sounded like cannons.

-MISSION-

We brought a number of
Hover bikes so that you
could take out these
cannons.  

make sure you are quick
when attacking them,
as they may reveal
the bikes locations to
other cannons.

Note that you bikes
depend on fuel,
thats why you have a
mobile Fuel pad.
