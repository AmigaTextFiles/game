the different files:

 campaignbriefing files has the name
and info of the campaign.

 #.briefing files is the text displayed
before each mission starts. these files
are all editable with any text editor.

 #.lha files is the savefile with the map
of the mission terrain, units, and other things.
these maps are made with the map editor.
they are packed and extracted with Lha packer
automatically using t: as a temporary directory.

---------------------

here is one procedure
to make a new campaign:

copy and rename an existing campaign dir
to the number you want.

edit the campaignbriefing file,
then save it in your dir.

you do not need a campaigncompletion file,
but it is supported.
You can add credits to this file.

you do not need a campaignpicture file,
but it is supported.

note: I prefer to make a briefing file first,
and then make the map, so I give that order here.

the mission will need a briefing file.
easiest is to load an other briefing file
in any text editor,
then save as <your mission number>.briefing

start the mapeditor in the desired theme,
(read mapeditor.doc for further info)
make sure you include both friendly (green),
and enemy (any other color) units.

when you feel the map is complete,
save to editormap for a handy backup.
Then select start and save,
and give it 1 as name.
 
move saved map (in saves directory) to
campaigns/theme<the theme number>/
<your campaign number>/<the mission number>.lha

short: saves/1 goes into campaigns/theme?/?/  


voila, you have made a campaign.


a campaign can have a virtually
unlimited number of missions.
(the limit of the Long value)


problems:

Mission maps that has been created,
will be wrong if the order of units
has been rearranged,
or if units have been removed.
 But new units can safely be added after
all the other units.
Please remember this, because others
may make campaigns on your theme.
