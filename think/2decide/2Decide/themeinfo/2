DESCRIPTION:

A giant, but simple lifeform
is covering most of this planet.
Samples from the lifeform
suggests that there once was
many more lifeforms, but that
this simple lifeform had greedily
taken all nutrition away from the
others, or forced them to live
in complete symbiosis with it.
 The lifeform is so soft and deep
that any human stepping on it,
would drown or get stuck.



The human race has already explored
this planet. They now know that
the simple lifeform is covering
a variety of highly valuable
materials that they want to use.


However, Humans are not willing
to just share everything, so the
different groups of people are
starting a new war. Goal being
to secure as much as possible
from the others.



The thin atmosphere makes
projectiles fly longer than usual,
so artillery units are popular.

besides humans, There are only
specially designed vehicles
that can move on the hard and rugged
ground of various stone materials.
