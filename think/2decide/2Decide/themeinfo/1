NAME:
Humans: Earth 2000
ROUNDTEXT:
day
DESCRIPTION:

A planet filled with water
and an abundance in life.

The homo sapien race has proven
that it is the most adaptive,
survival, and breeding species
according to its size.
 This highly intelligent primate
has no natural enemies
and it has the ability to remove
diseases that are supposed to decline
their numbers.

 All these elements
has negative global consequences
for all life on the beatiful planet,
including the lives of humans.

 Humans always wants more than they have,
so they will always fight for more
inbetween themselves.
Wars are often a result of this crave.
