The guide for 2Decide.


introduction  
------------

This is my attempt to make a strategy game.
I have always wanted to create my own.
But not only have I realized my dream,
I have also made it possible for anyone
else to design their own theme wich will
dominate the game when selected.

about the actual game
---------------------


...............................game intuiton


it opens a lores 256 color screen.

it multitasks.

does not process when screen is not active.


...............................terrain


there are 3 types of terrain:

"sea"  -terrain nr 0
"land" -terrain nr 1
"air"  -terrain nr 2

I added the "" because sea and land
are different from theme to theme.

and additionally 3
other miscellaneous objects
that only works on units travelling
either terrain nr 0 or 1:

misc nr1: ground units -cannot- enter cell,
          but nr1 could randomly change to nr2.

misc nr2: ground units -can- enter cell.
          but nr2 could randomly change to nr1.

misc nr3: ground units -can never- enter cell.

on theme 1, nr1&2 is a volcano mountain,
and units cannot move into the cell
if the volcano is active.

random (custom) games never add misc nr3,
but they can still be added in the editor.


................................world


The map dimension is 38x22
and covers most of the game screen.
 I could have made it bigger,
and implemented scrolling,
but I like to have total overview
of the playfield, and don't like it
when one must scroll around to find stuff.


................................exploration


There are currently 5 different exploration features:

type:

-1=See only around units.
 0=See around units, but remember explored terrain.
 1=Always see explored areas. (common in many games)
 2=Know the world, but still only see explored areas.
 3=See everywhere.


More info on type 0:

All units explore around them at all times,
but will each turn loose overview
of whatever area
they left behind when moving that turn.


units with ranged attack needs to have
enemy units explored
before they can target them.


................................resources


Assign a new production
in any of your structures
by holding down left mousebutton over it
to open its GUI.

The structure GUI is very easy to use.

One can here make a list of what to make
and the 2nd will start when the 1st is complete.

When the mousepointer is above the last ordered unit,
the unit text turns dark,
which means you can remove/deassign it from the list by clicking.

each unit has different completion times
which are showed to the right of it
and with a T-# rounds on the production list.


................................turn based


Units are commanded in order, -first this -then that -start over.

you can not select wich one to move in the order you want,
thats because I never liked the way one could cheat with a units
time in games like civilization.

its almost always "your turn".
especially when one of your units are blinking.


................................units


Unit specs are loaded from
individual files in units/theme?/
Look at those with a text viewer
to see how they are built up.

if there are 2 units ingame with less
than half power each in one position,
they will probably team up over a round,
except if it is transport units.


................................battle


all battle outcomes are randomly processed
from each units attack or defence values,
units morale, and units power.
 the resulting odds are shown in battle display.

a weak unit has less power in attack and defence.

a battle does not necessary
result in one unit standing.

a unit can battle a unit in a different color.
in same main terrain, (land,sea),
except aerial units wich can generally attack all units.

units with 0 in attack value
can not attack any other unit.

a "land" unit placed in a structure will have a 2x defense,
but not air units or "sea" units.

when a unit attacks a position with several
hostile units, then the hostile unit with the most
defence, energy and morale will battle the attacking unit.


................................ranged attack


units with ranged attack will try to
aim their weapons against enemy units
that are revealed, and close enough.

ranged attack has a better chance of hitting enemy
the nearer the enemy unit is.

ranged attack will be less powerfull
and reliable with lower energy on the unit.


................................transport

a unit is loaded onto a transport
unit by either moving into it,
or loading (] key) the unit on top of it.

a cargo (unit inside/on transport)
will never attack a unit, nor defend.

You can click on the transport unit
and you will get a list of all units
in that cell, including units that are being carried.

Click on a carried unit to unload it
to the same cell, if possible.


................................morale


this game is filled with morale
in units and structures.
morale can mean;

-motivation, aswell as
-contentment, and
-happiness.

the morale is shown with different good/bad gfx.

Units that stay in structures
will have their morale raised.

Units that wander around in the world
will slowly increase or decline
to the average 5/10 morale.

A good morale helps units keep up
the duration when attacking others.
 in a smaller scale, it also boosts
the attack and defence values.

When a unit is defending within a structure,
then the structure will always lose some morale.

A morale below half in structures
stalls any production in it.

The morale in structures
rise very slowly each round.

When a unit is created in a structure,
it will have the same morale as the structure.

................................player,user


In campaigns, the player controls the green color.

keypad 1-9 to move/attack with units.

the [ key on the keypad to freeze unit.
the ] key on the keypad to load unit
 onto a transport in same cell.
the / key to change a unit that can change to a structure.

any unit can be activated
by clicking on the cell it stands on
and then select it from the list that appears.

Freezing units is a way to keep load
off of the player.
 The freezed unit has no advantages
or disadvantages to an active unit.

s key to save a screenshot in ram. 

the game has a menu
with the standard save, quit, about
but also numerous game options
and special commands for units.











Known bugs:

Unproblematic flaw when serial linked:
The battle strategies and battle bonus of 2 players
on the same computer
will not be the same as on the other computer,
but this does not affect the battle at all.
