@node "Quick Start!" "Quick Start!"
Smoke'em Poker is a @{"freeware" link "About BeerWare" 0} game of @{"five-card draw poker" link "About Five-Card Draw" 0}. You play against up
to 5 opponents simulated by the computer.

@{"Requirements" link "System Requirements" 0}: Workbench 2.04 or later, with an overscan preferences setting of
at least 704x240. May be slow on 68000-based Amigas (turn the speech off and
disable card-sorting to speed it up). To get synthesized speech, you need the
AmigaDOS speech software from WB 2.0x or earlier releases.

You can change the @{"game settings" link "Setting Preferences" 0} at the start of each game.

Each hand proceeds as follows:

 - ante and dealing
 - opening bets (no minimum hand to open)
 - discarding cards (1 discard of up to 3 cards)
 - closing bets
 - the showdown (where you win, lose, or tie)

All standard poker hands are allowed, including low-ace straights (A-2-3-4-5).
@{"Check-raising (sandbagging)" link "Setting Preferences" 0} can be prohibited. If a computer player @{"runs out" link "Running Out Of Money" 0}
@{"of money" link "Running Out Of Money" 0}, they're out of the game. If you run out of money, you can end the
game or let the other players continue.

After any hand, you can view @{"statistics and graphs" link "Generating Stats" 0} of the current game.

For more details, see the @{"other topics" link "Main" 0} in this documentation.

For information on what's new in this version, see @{"Version History" link "Version History" 0}.

Just Deal It!
@endnode

@node "Introduction" "Introduction"
Welcome to Smoke'em Poker. Ante up and deal it, Tex!

The game is five-card draw (for rules, see @{"About Five-Card Draw" link "About Five-Card Draw" 0}). You play
against five other simulated players who would like nothing better than to
"smoke" you on a big pot.

(Yes, this is real multi-player poker, not another lame "video poker" game.
The best thing about poker is matching wits with conniving opponents, not
playing a glorified slot machine. So there.)

Smoke'em Poker uses a standard Amiga user interface, although the graphics are
spartan (for now). If you've played real poker before, you should have no
problem playing Smoke'em Poker.
@endnode

@node "System Requirements" "System Requirements"
Smoke'em Poker requires an Amiga with the following:

 - Workbench 2.04 or later (so upgrade, already!)
 - at least 2 megs of memory (I'm not too sure of this, though)

Smoke'em Poker uses a custom overscan screen of 704x240. Your Workbench
preferences for overscan should be set to at least this size so that the
Smoke'em Poker screen can open normally. If your Workbench isn't that big,
you'll only be able to see part of the Smoke'em Poker screen at once and
you'll get that annoying "auto-scroll" effect. (Sorry about this - I assumed
that I could force open an overscan screen, but apparently not. Unfortunately,
it's a major pain to rearrange everything to fit on a standard (640x200)
screen. Sigh...)

To get synthesized speech, you must have the AmigaDOS speech synthesis
software. This was part of the system software up to WB 2.0x, but Commodore
(in their finite wisdom) removed it from later system releases. If you have WB
2.1 or later, you just need to get your hands on the 2.0x speech software
(narrator.device, "Say", etc.). How you get it is your business.
 Smoke'em Poker does speech by sending arguments to the "say" program, which
it expects to find in the Utilities drawer of your boot volume (sys:). So, if
your "say" program is elsewhere, move or copy it to "sys:utilities".

While Smoke'em Poker should run on any model of Amiga, it can be sluggish on
slower (68000-based) Amigas. To speed things up, turn the sound off (see
@{"Controlling Sound And Speech" link "Controlling Sound And Speech" 0}) and make sure that card-sorting is turned off
(see @{"Setting Preferences" link "Setting Preferences" 0}).
@endnode

@node "About Five-Card Draw" "About Five-Card Draw"
Poker comes in hundreds of different flavours, but five-card draw is probably
the best known and simplest form. Here's how it goes:

After paying an initial ante, each player is dealt five cards down (visible
only to that player).

After the cards are dealt, the opening round of betting starts with the player
to the left of the dealer. Betting continues clockwise around the table until
all players have matched the highest bet or folded out of the hand. There is
NO minimum hand required to open the betting. If no bets are made (that is,
everyone checks), then the hand continues normally - everyone gets a free
discard.

All players who pay the opening bet can then discard UP TO THREE cards from
their hands. These cards are replaced by the same number of new cards from the
deck.

A closing round of betting follows, starting with the player who last raised
in the opening round. All players who pay the final bet then reveal their
hands in the "showdown". The player with the best hand wins the "pot" (the
accumulated money bet during the hand). In case of a tie (which is rare), the
winners split the pot.

For more information on using Smoke'em Poker's interface to play a round of
five-card draw, see @{"Playing A Hand" link "Playing A Hand" 0}.
@endnode

@node "What Beats What?" "What Beats What?"
For those of you who keep forgetting, here's the order of poker hands (from
worst to best):

 Runt (nothing, nada, e.g. 2-4-7-J-K)
 Pair (e.g. 2-2-7-J-K)
 Two Pair (e.g. 2-2-7-7-K)
 Three of a Kind (e.g. 2-2-2-J-K)
 Straight (e.g. 2-3-4-5-6, but different suits)
 Flush (e.g. five hearts, but not consecutive)
 Full House (e.g. 2-2-2-7-7)
 Four of a Kind (e.g. 2-2-2-2-7)
 Straight Flush (e.g. 2-3-4-5-6, all of same suit)
 Royal Flush (10-J-Q-K-A, all of same suit)

Smoke'em Poker automatically displays which of these hands you have. It's up
to YOU to make money with it.

(In some cases, Smoke'em Poker may tell you that you have an inside straight,
outside straight, "baby" flush, or "baby" straight flush. For more information
on these special hands, see @{"Four-Card Hands" link "Four-Card Hands" 0}.)
@endnode

@node "House Rules" "House Rules"
Every poker gathering decides on a few "house rules". Here are the house rules
for Smoke'em Poker:

Low-Ace Straights:
 Normally, aces are high (valued above kings). The only exception to this is a
low-ace straight (A-2-3-4-5), where the ace is the "one" card. If you get an
low-ace straight, Smoke'em Poker automatically re-sorts your hand to put the
ace before the 2. Note that an ace can only be high OR low (not both) in a
given hand. You cannot create a "wrap-around" straight using an ace (for
example, Q-K-A-2-3).

Splitting Pots:
 Once in a great while, two or more players will tie at the showdown. For
example, two players may have the same two pairs. In this case, the "kickers"
(the remaining card(s) in their hands) determine the winning hand. If the
kickers are also equal, the players divide the money in the pot equally. In
case of tied flushes (for example, two players with king-high flushes), the
suit is NOT used to break the tie - suits have no inherent value.

Check-Raising:
 This house rule is configurable - see @{"Setting Preferences" link "Setting Preferences" 0}.
@endnode

@node "Four-Card Hands" "Four-Card Hands"
As a convenience, in the opening round of betting (before you discard),
Smoke'em Poker checks your cards for the following four-card hands:

 - baby straight flushes - four-card straight flushes with no gaps
 - baby flushes - four-card flushes (gaps or not)
 - outside straights - four-card straights with no gaps
   (a.k.a. two-sided straights)
 - inside straights - four-card straights with a gap between two
   of the cards, or one-sided straights (ace-low or ace-high)

These hands, while worth nothing in themselves, only need one card to make
them into excellent hands.

Smoke'em Poker points out these promising hands for you, but only points them
out BEFORE the discard (while you still have a chance to complete them).

When deciding how to label your hand BEFORE the discard, Smoke'em Poker
follows these rules:

 - inside straights are better than runts
 - outside straights are better than pairs
 - baby flushes are better than outside straights
 - baby straight flushes are better than baby flushes

For example, suppose that you started with a hand of 3-4-4-5-6. Before you
discarded anything, Smoke'em Poker would label your hand as an outside
straight, since this is POTENTIALLY worth more than your pair. If you had this
same hand AFTER the discard, however, the outside straight would no longer
have a chance of becoming a real (five-card) straight, so Smoke'em Poker would
label it as just a pair.
@endnode

@node "Setting Preferences" "Setting Preferences"
When you start a new game of poker, the preferences window appears, and
Smoke'em Poker automatically loads any saved game settings from its icon. You
can then set the following:

Your Name:
 Enter your name (up to 12 characters). If you don't enter a name, you'll be
called "Stranger". Defaults to blank.

Opponents:
 Opens the opponents window in which you set your opponents' names, skill
levels, and so on. For more information on this window, see @{"Choosing" link "Choosing Opponents" 0}
@{"Opponents" link "Choosing Opponents" 0}.

Starting Cash:
 The amount of money that every player starts with. Must be between $100 and
$10000. Defaults to $1000.

Ante:
 The amount of money that each player chips in to play in each hand. Must be
between $1 and $100. Defaults to $10.

Maximum Raises:
 The maximum number of raises (NOT including the first bet) that are allowed
in each round of betting. Must be between 1 and 10. Defaults to 3.

Minimum Bet:
 The smallest amount that a player can raise. Must be between $5 and $50, but
must be smaller than the medium bet (see below). Defaults to $10.

Medium Bet:
 The in-between amount that a player can raise. Must be between $10 and $100,
but must be larger than the minimum bet and smaller than the maximum bet.
Defaults to $25.

Maximum Bet:
 The largest amount that a player can raise. Must be between $15 and $200, but
must be larger than the medium bet. Defaults to $50.

Allow Check-Raising (Sandbagging):
 To allow check-raising (also known as sandbagging) in the game, select this
option. Check-raising means that if player A checks, then player B raises,
player A is allowed to re-raise the bet. Defaults to on.
 You typically check-raise when you have a strong hand but want to see who
else does too. Instead of making the first raise, you check (pass) the bet.
When someone else raises, you can then raise them more. If you disallow
check-raising, player A (in the example above) would not be allowed to
re-raise - they would have to call instead.
 Note: Call-raising (re-raising when you had previously called) is
       ALWAYS allowed.

Sort During Deal:
 To automatically sort your hand as each card is dealt, select this option. If
auto-sorting is slow on your Amiga, turn this option off - the hand will not
be sorted until it is completely dealt. Defaults to off.

Pre-select Discards:
 To automatically pre-select the cards to discard from your hand, select this
option. When it's time to discard, Smoke'em Poker evaluates your hand and
selects the cards that it thinks you should discard. Defaults to on.
 Note: Smoke'em Poker always tries to fill outside straights and
       four-card flushes (or straight flushes) instead of keeping a pair.
 This feature is particularly convenient when used in conjunction with key
shortcuts (see @{"Key Shortcuts" link "Key Shortcuts" 0}).

Reveal Skill:
 To reveal each opponent's skill level during the game, select this option.
The skill level is shown beside the player's name in short form (for example,
"Dave (b)" means that Dave has a skill level of "bonehead"). Defaults to off.
For more information on skill levels, see @{"Choosing Opponents" link "Choosing Opponents" 0}.

Reveal All Hands:
 To show the other players' hands face-up, select this option. This is useful
for figuring out how the simulated players bet, or for just plain cheating.
Defaults to off.

Reset To Saved:
 Reloads saved values from Smoke'em Poker's tooltypes (stored in its icon).
Useful if you've mucked around with the game settings in the window and then
decide to cancel your changes.

Reset To Defaults:
 Resets all values in the preferences window and the opponents window to their
default values.
 Note: If Smoke'em Poker cannot load its game settings from its icon,
       it automatically resets all values to their defaults.

Save & Start:
 Exits from the preferences window, saves your game settings, and starts the
new game.
 Note: If Smoke'em Poker cannot save its game settings to its icon,
       an error window warns you of this before starting the new game.

A Note About Icon Tooltypes:
 Smoke'em Poker saves your game settings by storing them as tooltypes in its
icon (.info file). To change the game settings, I recommend that you take the
easy route and use the controls in the preferences window and opponents
window.
 However, if you want to manipulate the tooltypes directly in Workbench (using
the "Information" command), note the following:
 - If Smoke'em Poker doesn't find or understand a tooltype, it uses
   the appropriate default value.
 - If a numeric tooltype (like StartingCash) contains a value outside
   its legal range, Smoke'em Poker uses the appropriate minimum or
   maximum value instead.

@node "Choosing Opponents" "Choosing Opponents"
From the preferences window, you can click the Opponents button to open the
opponents window, which lets you customize the computer players for the next
game.

In this window, the computer players are arranged as they will appear in the
game. For each player, you can set the following:

Active:
 To include the player in the game, select this option.
 If you turn it off, the other controls for the player are automatically
disabled. This makes it possible for you to play a game with fewer than five
opponents. Defaults to on (for all five opponents).

Male:
 Determines the sex (male or female) of the player. This helps Smoke'em Poker
supply appropriate names for unnamed players, and to set appropriate
male/female voice settings. Defaults to male or female at random.
 (Socially Correct Disclaimer: Having a Male/notMale option (as opposed
  to a Male/Female option) is NOT intended to be chauvinistic - it simply
  saves some room in the window.)

Name:
 Enter the name of the computer player.
 If you supply a name of your own, make sure that you have set the Male option
to agree with the name (so that the voice matches the player's sex).
 If you leave the Name field blank, Smoke'em Poker supplies a random name each
time you start a new game. The name will be male or female depending on the
Male option. Defaults to blank.

Skill:
 To set the skill of the computer player, click repeatedly to cycle through
these skill levels:
 - Bonehead - Can barely distinguish good hands from
              bad ones, but bets anyway (duh).
 -     Fair - Bets based on the value of his/her own
              hand only.
 -     Good - Bets based on the value of his/her own
              hand and the amount of betting so far
              in the round.
 - (Random) - For each new game, this selects a random
              skill level (Bonehead, Fair, or Good).
              The random skill level is only revealed
              if you select the Reveal Skill option
              in the preferences window.
 Defaults to (Random).
 In upcoming releases of Smoke'em Poker, I hope to add higher skill levels -
see @{"Future Enhancements" link "Future Enhancements" 0}.

Done:
 Exits the opponents window and returns to the preferences window.

 Note: The settings in the opponents window are saved automatically along
       with the settings in the preferences window.

@node "Playing A Hand" "Playing A Hand"
Paying The Ante And Dealing:
 To deal a new hand, click the "Deal" button. Each player automatically pays
the ante for the hand, and the cards are then dealt by the next dealer. The
dealer is outlined in pink while dealing, and the dealer's name is highlighted
in pink throughout the hand.
 Note: Even if a player's cards are shown face-up on the screen (using the
"Reveal All Hands" option), players cannot see each other's cards until the
hand is over.

Opening Bets:
 When the betting comes around to you, you can do one of the following:
 - "Check" (or pass) your bet if no one else has bet yet.
    The "Check" button does not appear if someone has made a bet before
    you.
 - "Fold" your hand to get out of the current hand without matching the
    current bet.
    The "Fold" button does not appear if no one has made a bet yet.
 - "Call" the current bet by paying enough to match it.
    The "Call" button does not appear if no one has made a bet yet.
 - "Raise" the current bet by matching it and then increasing it by
   a certain amount.
   To raise, click the "Raise" button and choose from one of the three
   fixed amounts in the Raise window.
   These amounts are determined by the preferences that you set for the
   game - see @{"Setting Preferences" link "Setting Preferences" 0}.
   The "Raise" button does not appear if the maximum number of raises has
   already been reached, or if this would be a check-raise in a game where
   you have prohibited check-raising - see @{"Setting Preferences" link "Setting Preferences" 0}.

Discarding Cards:
 To drop UP TO THREE cards from your hand, click the "X"-shaped discard
pointer on the unwanted cards to mark them with an "X", then click the
"Discard" button. The new cards are dealt from the deck and automatically
sorted into your hand.
 To "stand pat" (that is, to keep all of your cards), make sure that no cards
are selected, then click the "Discard None" button.

Closing Bets:
 Betting in the closing round is done exactly as it is in the opening round,
except that it starts with the player who last raised in the opening round.

The Showdown:
 After the closing bets are done, the remaining players reveal their hands,
starting with the player who made the final raise. The winner of the hand is
outlined in gold (the colour of money) and collects the cash in the pot.
 At this point, if a simulated player is out of money, they leave the game. If
you are the last player left, you win the game. If YOU run out of money, you
lose (see @{"Running Out Of Money" link "Running Out Of Money" 0}).
@endnode

@node "Running Out Of Money" "Running Out Of Money"
A player can keep playing until they run out of money. More precisely, a
player can play a hand if they can afford the ante. They are permitted to go
into debt (showing negative cash) while betting on a hand.

When one of your simulated opponents doesn't have enough money left to ante up
for the next hand, they leave the table, and their name is shown dimmed. If
you bankrupt ALL of your opponents, the game ends with you as the new poker
champion (woohoo!).

If YOU run out of money, you can do one of the following:
 - @{"Start a new poker game" link "Restarting The Game" 0} (everyone gets a fresh bankroll), or
 - Crawl into a hole and die (@{"quit" link "Quitting The Program" 0}, that is), or
 - If there are at least two other players left, you can let them
   continue the game without you (see @{"Watching The Game" link "Watching The Game" 0}).
@endnode

@node "Key Shortcuts" "Key Shortcuts"
Most buttons have a keyboard shortcut (a key that you can press instead of
using the mouse to click the button). For a given button, the key shortcut is
the highlighted letter in the button (for example, S for the Sound checkbox).

In the raise window, you can choose a bet by pressing 1,2,3 or F1,F2,F3
(minimum, medium, and maximum respectively), or you can cancel the raise by
pressing Esc.

When discarding, you can press 1-5 or F1-F5 to select the corresponding card.

In addition, you can use the Return or Enter keys to activate the current
"default" button (marked by a sunken border). The default button changes
depending on the stage of the hand, as follows:
 - After a hand, Deal is the default action
 - If there is no bet yet, Check is the default action
 - If there is a bet, Call is the default action
 - If some discards are selected, Discard is the default action
 - If you shouldn't discard any, Discard None is the default action
   (for example, if you have a pat flush)
 These "smart" shortcuts let you play a hand mostly by pressing Return or
Enter. (Can you say "couch potato"? ;^)

You can exit from the stats window or the help window by pressing Esc.

You'll probably find that using key shortcuts (especially the "smart" Return
and Enter keys) is faster and easier than continually mousing around and
clicking buttons, especially once you get used to the game.

@node "Controlling Sound And Speech" "Controlling Sound And Speech"
To turn the sound effects (shuffling, money clinking, etc.) on or off, click
the Sound checkbox at the upper left corner of the screen. Sound is on by
default.

To turn synthesized speech on or off, click the Speech checkbox at the upper
left corner of the screen. Speech is on by default.

In this release, speech is rudimentary. For example, your opponents speak up
when betting ("I call", etc.). Their voices are matched to their sex - see
@{"Choosing Opponents" link "Choosing Opponents" 0}.

To get speech, you must have the AmigaDOS 2.0x speech software. For more
information, see @{"System Requirements" link "System Requirements" 0}.

While you can change the Sound and Speech settings at any time during a game,
they are not yet saved as @{"game preferences" link "Setting Preferences" 0}.

@node "Generating Stats" "Generating Stats"
For each poker game that you play, Smoke'em Poker keeps track of various
statistics that can help you analyze your play (and your opponents' play).

To examine the stats for the current game, click the Stats button. This opens
a stats window that shows a list of categories. Click on a category to display
the corresponding stats.

Clicking the "Graph Of Winnings" category displays a line graph of each
player's cash over the last 100 hands. The break-even point is shown as a
horizontal grey line.
 Note: In the first few hands of a graph, lines of different players may
       exactly overlap and obscure one another. Your hand is always plotted
       last so that it is never obscured.

To exit from the stats window, click the close box at the upper left corner of
the window, or press Esc.

Note that you can't look at stats in the middle of a hand. The Stats button is
only available between hands.

Statistics can be very useful in computer poker, since you typically play many
more hands in a given time that you would in normal poker. This can turn up
weaknesses in your play (for example, discovering that you are in too many
showdowns, which is a losing habit in the long run).
@endnode

@node "Getting Help" "Getting Help"
On-line help for Smoke'em Poker is available as an AmigaGuide document
(Smoke'emPoker.guide).

To read the help in its proper hypertext form, AmigaGuide must be installed on
your system. If you don't have AmigaGuide, you can always open the help file
with a plain text reader and just ignore the AmigaGuide markups.

To get help at any time during the game:

 - Click the Help button, or

 - Press the Help key (what a concept!)

This opens an AmigaGuide window showing the Smoke'em Poker documentation. If
you asked for help while in a particular window (such as the stats window),
the documentation automatically opens on the appropriate page (e.g. how to
generate stats). Otherwise, the table of contents is displayed.

Like any AmigaGuide document, you can navigate by reading page by page or by
clicking the hypertext buttons embedded in the documentation. An index is also
included; it lists all sections and all hypertext buttons.

To exit from the help window, click the close box at the upper left corner of
the window, or press Esc.

Since the documentation is a standard AmigaGuide file, you can also open it
directly from the Workbench or the shell (CLI).

Note: If Smoke'em Poker cannot find its help file (Smoke'emPoker.guide) in
      the same directory as Smoke'em Poker, nothing will happen when you
      ask for help.

other players.

To interrupt a game that you're watching, click the Stop Watching button. Once
the players finish the current hand, you can then continue. Note that there is
no key shortcut for the Stop Watching button.

You can also watch a game if you lose all of your money AND there are at least
two other players left. In the "losing" window that appears, select the "Let

@node "Known Problems" "Known Problems"
The following are bugs, problems, or limitations that I know of:

 - AGA/3.0 users may still have problems getting Smoke'em Poker to
   use a decent screen-mode. I hope v1.4 looks better on your system
   than v1.3 did - if not, let me know and I'll release an alternate
   version that opens the exact screen-mode (no promotion) which may
   work better.
   This is a problem that can probably only be eliminated by rewriting
   the game to fit on a non-overscan screen. Something for v1.5, I guess.

 - The program seems to eat small amounts of memory every few hands,
   so playing it for hundreds of hands (or leaving it in auto-play mode
   for a few hours) may consume all of your memory and eventually crash
   your machine. To be safe, make sure you've saved any other work in
   other apps before running the game.
   This seems to be a memory leak in CanDo 3.0. Hopefully it will be
   fixed in time for the next release of Smoke'em Poker.

 - While the Sound and Speech buttons can be toggled by clicking at any
   time, their key shortcuts don't work until there is a break in the play.

 - If, when watching the game, you click the Stop Watching button, it is
   replaced by a text message. This is actually just the selected state of
   the button - if you click it again, it reverts to Stop Watching. The
   button's state at the end of the hand determines if the game continues
   without you.

 - When generating the graph of winnings in the stats window, note that:
   - graphing may take a while on slower Amigas (especially those without
     floating-point chips)
   - in some cases, integer round-off errors may cause lines to go off the
     top of the graph

 - In the preferences window and the opponents windows, you can only get
   on-line help if the cursor isn't in a text field (i.e. the Help key
   is not detected if you're changing a value in a text field). To get
   help in these windows, de-select the text field by clicking somewhere
   outside it, then press the Help key.

 - When returning from the opponents window to the preferences window,
   the preferences window is not automatically selected and the
   "prohibit" pointer is shown. You must click manually on the
   preferences window to activate it.

 - Smoke'em Poker does not handle the case of three or more players tying
   (having the same hand) in the showdown (e.g. three Ace-high
   flushes). If this ever happens (which is extremely unlikely), the
   only two of the players will split the pot.

 - When comparing very close hands at the showdown, Smoke'em Poker only
   looks to the third (and sometimes fourth) card to break any ties.
   While this may result in the wrong player winning the pot, it is
   so unlikely that I've left it that way for now.

@node "Future Enhancements" "Future Enhancements"
Here's what I'd like to add to future releases of Smoke'em Poker (in no
particular order):

- More skill levels and selectable playing styles (loose or conservative)
  for the computer players. Also, computer players that learn about your
  betting tendencies and adjust their play accordingly. Eventually, I'd
  like to open up Smoke'em Poker to external players that play via ARexx.
  This would allow you to code your own computer players and hook them into
  the game. This would make for an interesting my-player-will-smoke-
  your-player "tournament".

- More poker variations, of course, starting with the more common games
  like five-card stud, seven- card stud, hold'em, high/low splits, and so
  on. This would also open the door for dealer's choice. I'm not a big fan
  of wild-card games, so don't hold your breath for "pregnant threes"...

- An option for playing over a network, modem, or direct connection. This
  would fill one or more of those other spots at the table with live people
  using Amigas linked to yours.

- An Odds button that shows you the odds of improving your hand vs. the
  odds offered by the pot.

- An Ask button that shows you what the various levels of computer players
  would do if they had your hand. Useful when you're just learning.

- Better graphics and animation, perhaps including a graphic pot that
  grows as more money is bet, animated dealing and discarding, player
  graphics (with an option to supply your own), choice of cardback
  graphics, and so on.
  I can barely draw stick-men, so if you want to supply some better
  graphics, let me know - see @{"About The Author" link "About The Author" 0}.

- An option for digitized sound for each player. I like the idea of
  playing sound files from external directories, so you could supply your
  buddies' voices and make Smoke'em Poker feel more like your own weekend
  poker game.

- Voice control using a sound digitizer, probably using something like
  Richard Horne's VoiceCLI with ARexx.

- Hooks to David Braben's Frontier(tm). Just imagine cruising the galaxy,
  docking your Cobra Mark III at the nearest orbiter, and challenging those
  Imperial scum to a fast-and-loose game of Follow-The-Emperor, no limit.
  Hmmm. Maybe next release...

Any other enhancements or changes that you'd like to see? Let me know - see

@node "Acknowledgments" "Acknowledgments"
Here's the section where I admit who I've ripped off for ideas  ;^)

Namely:

- "Poker Pete" on my old TRS-80 Model III. When you had beaten Pete out of
  all his money, he got up, pulled out his six-gun, and plugged you. Now
  THERE'S a way to end a computer game!

- "Vegas Johnny Draw Poker" by Top Score Software on MS-DOS (boo, hiss!).
  Pretty it ain't, but the keyboard interface is simple and the play is
  easy to follow. Some good betting algorithms, too. This is the game I was
  looking for on the Amiga, but the existing Amiga poker games either had
  brain-dead interfaces or were just "video" poker. Smoke'em Poker owes a
  lot to Vegas Johnny.

- The players in my local Saturday-night game (Gina, Paul, Rob, Karen, Lou,
  Derek, and Gord) who play-tested Smoke'em Poker, and without whom it
  would have taken half the time to program.  ;^D
  Thanks to Rob, especially, for losing some huge real-life pots and
  thereby providing me with a name for my program ("What a smoke! What an
  incredible burn!"). Sorry that I couldn't include an animation of the
  famed Dance-Of-The-Unbelievably-Smoked in this release.

- Thanks to Oxxi and Martin Taillefer for TurboText - a great text editor.
  Thanks also to Edd Dumbill for Heddley - a great tool for building
  AmigaGuide documents (don't worry, Edd - the money is on its way).

- Finally, thanks to Inovatronics for @{"CanDo" link "CanDo Legal Notice" 0}, an easy-to-use authoring
  system that made it possible for a C-hater like me to produce Amiga
  programs.

@node "About BeerWare" "About BeerWare"
Smoke'em Poker is BeerWare: if you like it, have a beer!

BeerWare is FREE, so keep it, play it, and make copies for your friends.

(A long time ago, in an interview far, far away, a games programmer remarked
that he and his rivals were competing for the user's beer-money. Hence the
happy concept of BeerWare - you can play this game AND still afford beer.)

While this software is freely redistributable, it is NOT public domain,
meaning that:

- I retain the copyright (©1994/95 Dave O'Brien)

- You shouldn't change the program and then redistribute it yourself.
  If you discover bugs or think up improvements, let me know and I'll try
  to oblige you - see @{"About The Author" link "About The Author" 0}.

Distributors: don't be wankers and try to charge anything for this, except for
nominal copying fees.

Fred Fish: feel free to put this on an upcoming Fish disk, and thanks for all
the great software you've supplied us with for so many years.

More BeerWare* coming soon:

- Battle Grid - two players pit their knights, assassins, clerics, and
                sorcerors against each other on a 8x8 grid

- Net Runner  - expand and conquer a computer network using viruses,
                trojan horses, and worms to punch through your opponents'
                I.C.E.

  * Strictly speaking, these titles are currently BelchWare (vapour),
    but they are very close to condensing.

By the way, this documentation is also BeerWare: if you've read this far, have
another one!

I'm a technical writer by trade (paid by the word - can you tell?), and I do
my work on Macs and PCs, but the Amiga is still my favourite for having fun.

I've been fooling with Amigas for a long time now, but only recently tried
programming them (thanks to @{"CanDo" link "CanDo Legal Notice" 0} for making this part easier).

My two other favourite things to do are playing poker and riding recumbent
bikes (not at the same time).
