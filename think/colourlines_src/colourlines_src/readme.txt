Colour Lines Source Code Readme
===============================

 This package contains the complete source code of the Colour Lines game for Amiga without the image and music files.
Image and music files can be found in the binary archive.

 Binary archive can be downloaded from Aminet:
http://aminet.net/package/game/think/colourlines


Requirements for compiling
--------------------------
 You need to set up AmigaE compiler package to compile the source code. More information about AmigaE:
http://strlen.com/amiga-e

 For music module file playback you will need the widely used Player 6.1A source code converted into an AmigaE module.
Unfortunately, I have no recollection how was I able to achieve this 15 years ago, but the assembly source code of the player
is available on this page:
http://www.amiga-stuff.com/modpackers-download.html

 Copy the Player 6.1A AmigaE module into the same directory where the source code is or to the EModules: assign
among the rest of the AmigaE modules named as 'player610.m'.


Compiling the sources
---------------------
 Using the original AmigaE compiler source code can be compiled by executing the following command:

ec lines
