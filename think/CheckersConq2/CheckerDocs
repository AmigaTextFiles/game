            ******* INTRODUCTION *******

                (What is STRATOPLEX?)

   I have succeeded in my mission of creating The Ultimate
Games In The History Of The Universe.  This is the most diverse
fleet of games ever created by a single person!  Now you can
play Snowfort, the first game designed using the aesthetic
design principles of "Feng Shuey".

   You can now get my games for new lower prices, as defined
in the middle of this document.  You can get 1 disk from my
armada for $3, 2 disks for $5, 3 disks for $8, 4 disks for $10,
etc...  All quoted prices are USA Dollar Quotes.  Current
exchange rates cannot be printed, as they change daily.  To save
postage, avoid sending metal coinage, and round to the nearest
full currency unit.  Also, you cannot print your own currency,
even if you intend to become your very own country.

 My Checkers game has lots of features that are useful to play however you might want to.  I have options to play against the computer, in four varying levels that can give anyone a challenge.  You can also play against another human player, or watch the computer play against itself.  You can also select two different checker designs.  Now to give, in detail, what every feature does:

  EDIT BOARD:  This allows you to change the board setup at any time.  You select which checker you want to place, and then place as many of that type of checker on the board as you want (without having to keep clicking on the side of the board to pick up more checkers).  To erase checkers, you can click on the empty space on the side, between the other checkers.  When you are done, click on Edit Board resume doing what you were doing immediately before.

  SHOW THREATS:  You can see if there are any spaces that you can be jumped in, ifyou move there, or if a checker is already threatened.  Such squares are marked in a white box.

   MULTIPLE JUMPS:  To make this game so that doing multiple jumps is optional, and not mandatory, like some other checkers games, I came up with this feature.  All you have to do is remember to use it when making jumps.  You also have to turn it off, since you also have the possibility of making three or four jumps in a row.

  FORFEIT MOVE:  You can give avay a move if you want to, but it may be considered cheating (yeah, right, as if the edit board feature isn't considered cheating).

  FORFEIT GAME:  If you get bored with a situation and want to start fresh, then click here to kill the current game.

  TOGGLE SOUND:  If you get sick of hearing these mind wrenching sounds, as they are often repeated non-stop throughout the game, then you know what to do.

  TAKE BACK MOVE:  This will let you take back up to 100 moves, as this is usually enough to get the game back to the beginning anyway.

  SWITCH SIDES:  If you get jeallous of the enemy side, or if you are winning and want a challenge, then this feature will let you play the other side's situation.

  CHANGE PLAYERS:  At any time, you can use this to go gack to the main control panel and change the players or the checker's designs.

          ******* NEW FEATURES *******

   FAST MODE:  The computer can play a game by itself in only
5-10 seconds, or you can skip the animated checkers for a
faster game of your own.

   NEW RULE:  Now you can choose to end your turn when one
of your checkers gains a promotion by jumping.

   SMARTER COMPUTER PLAYER:  There is now one more computer
player, to make it a bit more difficult for you.

   Numbered Game Board:  When retouching the game screen, I
added numbers on the game board for fanatics who like this
sort of thing.

             ******* EXTRA STUFF *******

  This game is the full version, and it is only $3.00 Shareware, so it is a great deal for you th get.  I am working on other stuff too, and as you can see, I am not greedy, you may like my other games released simultaneously.  This can be spread around and this document, as well as the game and support files must stay intact and together when you are spreading it around.

     ******* REVOLUTIONARY PRICING STRATEGY *******

    (STRATOPLEX, worth more, same low price, coming soon)

   Here it is!  You can get any 2 disks of my armada of games
for $5 for just 1 disk for $3.  These prices effectively negate
previous declarations (since it might be possible to combine them
with this one and wind up with the entire fleet of games for
something less than I can afford :).  This lets you get 4 disks
for $10, instead of the previous 3 as offered earlier.

   These are the FULL VERSIONS, which are only available
directly from me :).

   Let's see:
1 disk costs $3
2 disks cost $5
3 disks cost $8
4 disks cost $10
etc...

Disk #1) Incinerator and New CheckersConquest
Disk #2) Castle Incinerator and New Conundrum
Disk #3) Mangled Fenders (V1.1)
Disk #4) SplatterPaint Version 1.67 (with some of my artwork)
Disk #5) SNOWFORT
Disk #6) Mangled Fenders: Armored Combat Edition
Disk #7) New CheckersConquest and New Conundrum

   I recommend disks 1, 2, 5, and 6 as a set, since you get
SIX FULL GAMES for $10, instead of the standard $20 for a
single game of the same calibur.  Remember, My games are of
the same, or higher quality than all other games!

   Let's see: 
6/10, or 12/20, Value Quotient for my games.
compared to 1/20, Value Quotient for a fictional other game.

A simple calculator yields that you get twelve times the value
out of my fleet than you can possibly get with this example.

   What if you only like half of them?  Well, you still get a
six times value from me, and even more if you decided
beforehand only to get the ones you like!

Splatterpaint is freely distributible in it's full form, so
spread Splatterpaint around :)

   Let's see:
1/0, Value Quotient for Splatterpaint, this is the highest rating
anyone can ever get!  The Rating is so high, it is undefined by
conventional mathematics.  Remember, only my paint program,
and my checkers game, defy the laws of the Universe!

(Version numbers may increase, which is a good thing)

Mangled Fenders V1.1 has memory conservation code, and will
try to fit the game in available memory by substituting car
graphics (This is also a good thing).

       ******* AWESOME GAMES BY ME *******

     (STRATOPLEX: Wear a Titanium Helmet for safety)

In 1994, I have developed and released an entire fleet of 5
awesome games.  These games have set new standards in the
games industry.  My games are simply the greatest ever to
exist.  They have the highest quality graphics, gameplay, and
ingenuity that exist only in my games!

   In the last part of this document, I declared cheaper prices
for my games, so I have removed references to cash for full
versions from the descriptions below.  Remember, the only
source for my armada of full versions is directly from me :)

   CONUNDRUM is my abstract hexagon based puzzle board game,
where the object is to negate all of the colored tiles by placing
them next to each other.  This game was inspired by all of
those hexagonal floor tiles you commonly find on bathroom
floors.  Despite the high level of abstraction, Conundrum is
very simple to play, and Conundrum is highly addictive for any
puzzle gamer.

   My awesome original has a new swath of power in the new
version of CONUNDRUM.  It has 20 new bonus round puzzles, as
well as several new "Super Tiles".  Super Tiles enclude a Wipe
Tile to destroy the grey matter, and Super Negator Tiles that
drain color from all of the tiles on the board.  The greatest
enhancement yet is the addition of a second "ready" position, so
you can choose between two different tiles to place on the
board.  The 10 second Death Limit remains as ominous as ever. 
You can also play just the bonus rounds, if you like.  There is
even a cheat mode in this spectacular new game!

   MANGLED FENDERS is my top view, 6 player demo derby game,
where the objective is to destroy all of the other vehicles, by
crashing into them.  There are cash awards to all the players,
depending on the order in which they are destroyed.  There are
different types of vehicles, so you can pick the one that suits
you.  You can even pick multiple cars to one input device, as a
novelty feature.  Both joysticks are supported in Full Version,
as well as continued play.

   The ARMORED COMBAT EDITION of MANGLED FENDERS lets you
stock up on essential ammo and blast your way to victory with
your choice of 6 battle tanks from various countries.  The fire
button releases barrages of powerful munitions against enemy
targets that lie in your path.  This Is True Mangled Fenders
Style!

   INCINERATOR is THE Decisive 3D missile attack/defend game,
where you defend your city from the enemy's missiles and
helicopters, with your laser cannons, forcefields, and super
bombs.  Every other round, you get to pulverize the enemy city,
with missiles of your own.  It supports NTSC/PAL, is hard drive
installable, has high scores, and a secret cheat mode.

   CASTLE INCINERATOR is a graphics rewrite of Incinerator,
with castles instead of cities, and horses instead of missiles.
The graphics are the only real change, but WOW, they are so
awesome.  Well, I have had the chance to improve it a bit more
than that, as I have improved the sounds and gameplay too.
I have made what used to be the helicopter more powerful, as
it can now drain the shields with a special beam.  Actually, the
helicopter is now a giant bird, with flapping wings instead of
rotor blades.  It was fun rewriting the docs for it.  

   It looked silly in text, having to defend a castle from
flatulent horses, with laser wielding mages.  It will be available
from me only, since I am greedy (well, not really :), so it is
another incentive to register with me.

   CHECKERS CONQUEST is a checkers game with lots of
features, and has intelligent computer opponents.  There are
lots of options, including changing the board layout, and showing
possible threatened positions.  There is no demo version of
Checkers Conquest, as the freely distributible version of it is 
available almost anywhere,  another testiment to my generosity.

   The New Version of Checkers Conquest has another level of
computer intelligence, a standard numbered game board, and new
options like Fast play and a new rule option. 

   Gee, let's see, thats one... two... three... four... FIVE games,
all released in 1994, that was a lot of stuff, I should be
exhausted by now, but no!  As you are experiencing first hand,
I have another game, a paint program, and a few of my awesome
originals redesigned and already released!  This brings my fleet
of games up to an awesome armada!

   It is my policy to give at least something to everyone, this
is why Splatterpaint and Checkers Conquest are freely
distributible.  It is also why some games only have minimal
disablement.  I have also given bonus games to my registerers,
since they are the fuel that keep the Incinerplex running.  This
conjures up images of people being sacraficed to volcanoes, oops.

          ******* FUTURE GAMES *******

   (STRATOPLEX: DON'T STARE DIRECTLY INTO THE MONITOR)

   I have played around with several possible new games, even a
standard shoot-em-up, and this is what I have come up with:

STRATOPLEX:  This game, when finished, will be without a doubt
The Greatest Game Ever Conceived In The History Of The
Universe.  The release date for this game is yet to be
announced.  This awesome game uses my exclusive "Embrace The
Adrenaline" Play Sequence and Algorithm, as well as the aesthetic
design principles of "Feng Shuey".

   "Embrace The Adrenaline" refers to my new Play Sequence,
which is also an Algorithm and a Set of Protocols.  When used
in conjunction with the reverse polarity version of the Ambiance
Inhibitor, yielding an Ambiance Spectaculomoplex Matrix that
causes a synaptic overload that creates hours of unadulterated
pure adrenaline pumping through your vital organs.  Also, if 
you stare directly into the monitor, a Psionic Wave Cascade will
sweep through your brain and cause your head to explode, oops.

   Unfortunately, withdrawal from this sensory overload
phenomenon could cause motion sickness, halucinations, or total
neural disruption, resulting in a spontaneous bursting of the
human head, and a possible chain reaction of human head
explosions from the insuing Psionic Wave Cascade.

   Of course, to avert this catastrophe, you should delve
directly into oragami, and stick your tongue slightly out of 
one side of your mouth.  The resulting drooling will ground your
psionic reserves, avoiding the side effects.

   You should also keep your cats or other animals away from
the monitor, causing similiar effects.

   YOU SHOULD NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, split the
output to two monitors, and face them at each other.  This will
cause a rift in the continuum, and the insuing flux will draw
the entire Universe in on itself.  This may cause a chain
reaction and completely incinerate the entire Omniverse, where
our Universe resides as a seemingly insignifant bubble.  Actually,
it is this reaction that powers the Stratoplex in the first
place.  OOPS, this seems to define a paradox, a conundrum that
will destroy the entire Stratoverse, oh darn.
