==============================================================================
         A scenario for the game "-Star_Trek-" by Frank Mathieson
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+++ UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS
+++ STARFLEET HEADQUARTERS
+++ STARDATE 50878.5
+++ ADMIRAL VAN DOREEN

Dear Captain T. YUKASAWA,

the Klingon house of Duras has sent a small battle fleet of Klingon
cruisers to the Federation's space to take revenge for Captain J.-L. PICARD
helping Gowron to become leader of the Klingon Empire at stardate
45025.4 .

Take your ship, the Galaxy class star ship USS DURABLE (NCC-1722) and
support the Federation fleet around the USS ENTERPRISE (NCC-1701-E)
against the Klingons.

Good luck, Captain!

@title "What is in this scenario?"

@{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

Estimated difficulty: Very easy
Solvable with unregistered version: Yes (tested)

8 versus 6 - not that hard, isn't it? This scenario is thought for
beginners and much easier than the standard game and the scenarios
provided with it. You can use it to get familiar with -Star_Trek-.
Experienced users can take it to check the power of their ships
without upgrading it that much first. Should be easy and quick (less
than 20 turns) to win.

@{b}HINTS@{ub}

Here you can find some hints to solve this scenario. However,
try yourself at first, it's twice the fun.

Continue only, if you really fail to win this game.

@{" Read hints " link HINT1}
@endnode

@node HINT1
@title "Hint 1"

Read the hints in the -Star_Trek-Tips.guide provided with the
game itself. All should work in this scenario too.

Of course you should also read the documentation of -Star_Trek-,
these are just few lines about this scenario, not a tutorial.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT2}
@endnode

@node HINT2
@title "Hint 2"

You have enough starbases (3), as many other Federation ships
in the game as possible (5) and also only a few enemies (8),
so you should have a couple of turns before the last starbase
is destroyed and the game is lost.

Use this time wisely to upgrade your ship before starting to
attack the enemies.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT3}
@endnode

@node HINT3
@title "Hint 3"

To say it more clearly: Try to visit all 3 starbases during
your first 3 turns. Take nearly all power units and always all
torpedos from them.

If you want to go the safe way, leave one starbase out in order
to make it defend much better against the enemy because there
are more power units left to defend it.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT4}
@endnode

@node HINT4
@title "Hint 4"

You will not need upgrades in any case, because your enemies are
not that strong. But if you like to buy one, take the torpedo
upgrade and maybe also the shield upgrade.

You don't really need ANY of the other upgrades, however the
phaser upgrade can be interesting in the registered version
of -Star_Trek- (which you really should not miss).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT5}
@endnode

@node HINT5
@title "Hint 5"

Always keep your ship in a perfect state. Repairing damages
immediately after a battle is much more effective than using
your power units for the shields. If you run out of power
units, visit a starbase - preferable one which you haven't
visited lately and which hasn't been attacked recently.

However, always leave at least 1 power unit in your shield
systems. If you get attacked by an enemy you win the time
of one turn with it, because no matter how many power units
are available for the shields, the enemy needs one attack
round to make them collapse and greater damages to the ship
itself will just happen one round later then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT6}
@endnode

@node HINT6
@title "Hint 6"

Always leave enough power units in the warp drive,
so you can always warp away when the enemy is too strong
for your ship. This option is interesting when two enemies
involve you in a battle at the same time, which happens
randomly sometimes.

For each time you engage the warp drive you need 25
power units, so without thinking about damage you should
always leave 50 units in the warp drive before following
an enemy ship so 25 are left next turn.

But since you should expect damage to the ship (during
the battle and also additional after a normal turn in the
unregistered version), you should add some more units
because the warp drive and all the other ship systems will
be less effective. 75 units instead of 50 leave your warp
drive online until 50% of damage. Add some more if you
want to be on the safe side, e.g. 100 are enough to still
have warp available after 66% of damage.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT7}
@endnode

@node HINT7
@title "Hint 7"

However, you should never attack an enemy ship with your
warp drive in mind. Follow enemy ships only if you are
prepared well for a battle and you think you have a
chance to win. Because enemy ships are repaired quite
fast, it is of no use to just damage them instead of
destroying them. You will only loose power units and
torpedos and encounter the enemy ship in totally
repaired state later in the game with high propability.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT8}
@endnode

@node HINT8
@title "Hint 8"

You need 6 torpedo hits to destroy a Klingon cruiser or
4 if you purchased the torpedo upgrade.

Always have in mind, that one of eight torpedos misses
Think about firing one or two more torpedos to destroy an
enemy ship in only one round safely, you will get much
less damage to your ship because the enemy will fire only
once at you before he is destroyed.

If you can not destroy an enemy in one battle round, but
you have lowered his shields under 100 and have enough
shield energy left for yourself, consider to send an away
team. If the enemy's shields are under 75, think about if
it could be better to fire phasers than another torpedo
(registered version only).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT9}
@endnode

@node HINT9
@title "Hint 9"

Try to lower the shields of a Klingon cruiser under 100
early in the game. Be sure you have power units for your
shields left and send an away team to the enemy ship. The
away team will collect knowledge about the alien race and
you will be more effective in future battles against that
race. No, not just you, the starbases and the other
Federation ships will fight better too and this can be of
great use.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT10}
@endnode

@node HINT10
@title "Hint 10"

Basically, just follow a Klingon ship whenever you have
full energy for your shields, no damage to the ship
systems and at least 6 (4 after upgrade) torpedos left.

If you need power units or torpedos, visit a starbase.

If you visited all starbases recently, there should be
no new power units and torpedos for you. In this case
you should just use the "Wait" function in the "Helm"
menu. In the unregistered version the ship will take
damage anyway, but at least you save the 25 power units
for the warp drive. Proceed to a starbase after a few
"Wait"'s.

Still not enough? Watch one, two or three hundred
episodes of Star Trek to learn how Starfleet crews
usually solve problems like yours.

Engage! ;*)
