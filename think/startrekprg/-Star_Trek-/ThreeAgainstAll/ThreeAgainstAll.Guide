Dear Captain G. VINCENT,

the USS HOPE (NCC-1731) has order to meet the USS ENTERPRISE
(NCC-1701-E) and the USS DEFIANT (NX-74205) to defend us against several
great invasion fleets some alien races sent to us!

Good luck, Captain!

@title "What is in this scenario?"

@{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

Estimated difficulty: Hard
Solvable with unregistered version: Maybe (not tested)

This one is really hard: Only two other ships are there to prevent
the enemies from just destroying the few starbases. You have only
short time to upgrade your ship since many starbases will missing
soon. Good thing although, the two other ships are the ENTERPRISE
and the DEFIANT and both are a little bit stronger this time, maybe
they will do a great job in also destroying some enemies...

@{b}HINTS@{ub}

Here you can find some hints to solve this scenario. However,
try yourself at first, it's twice the fun.

Continue only, if you really fail to win this game.

@{" Read hints " link HINT1}

@node HINT1
@title "Hint 1"

Read the hints in the -Star_Trek-Tips.guide provided with the
game itself. All should work in this scenario too.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT2}

@node HINT2
@title "Hint 2"

You have lots of enemies (40) and only two Federation ships
this time, so the few starbases (7) will be destroyed quickly
if you do not succeed in killing some ships early in the game.

So just visit a few starbases to get the most important
upgrades, torpedos and power units, then don't lose any more
time and attack the enemies.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT3}
@endnode

@node HINT3
@title "Hint 3"

You will need the torpedo upgrade in any case, buy this one
first. The shield upgrade is also useful, especially against
the Borg Cube.

You don't really need ANY of the other upgrades, however the
phaser upgrade can be interesting in the registered version
of -Star_Trek- (which you really should not miss).

Because you don't have much time (only 2 other ships and 7
starbases are targets for the enemies), just start with the
torpedo upgrade and leave the other ones for later in the
game.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT4}

@node HINT4
@title "Hint 4"

Always keep your ship in a perfect state. Repairing damages
immediately after a battle is much more effective than using
your power units for the shields. If you run out of power
units, visit a starbase - preferable one which you haven't
visited lately and which hasn't been attacked recently.

However, always leave at least 1 power unit in your shield
systems. If you get attacked by an enemy you win the time
of one turn with it, because no matter how many power units
are available for the shields, the enemy needs one attack
round to make them collapse and greater damages to the ship
itself will just happen one round later then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT5}
@endnode

@node HINT5
@title "Hint 5"

Always leave enough power units in the warp drive,
so you can always warp away when the enemy is too strong
for your ship. This option is interesting when you
encounter the Borg Cube too early or when two enemies
involve you in a battle at the same time, which happens
randomly sometimes.

For each time you engage the warp drive you need 25
power units, so without thinking about damage you should
always leave 50 units in the warp drive before following
an enemy ship so 25 are left next turn.

But since you should expect damage to the ship (during
the battle and also additional after a normal turn in the
unregistered version), you should add some more units
because the warp drive and all the other ship systems will
be less effective. 75 units instead of 50 leave your warp
drive online until 50% of damage. Add some more if you
want to be on the safe side, e.g. 100 are enough to still
have warp available after 66% of damage.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT6}
@endnode

@node HINT6
@title "Hint 6"

However, you should never attack an enemy ship with your
warp drive in mind. Follow enemy ships only if you are
prepared well for a battle and you think you have a
chance to win. Because enemy ships are repaired quite
fast, it is of no use to just damage them instead of
destroying them. You will only loose power units and
torpedos and encounter the enemy ship in totally
repaired state later in the game with high propability.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT7}
@endnode

@node HINT7
@title "Hint 7"

Begin attacking the Klingon cruisers, they are weakest
(275) in the game, then follow the Cardassian Galor class
cruisers and the Romulan warbirds which both have a
strength of 300 (like you). Leave the Jem'Hadar warships
with 375 strength for later in the game when your ship
has also the shield upgrade and some power units in
reserve. Leave the Borg Cube out until the end.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT8}
@endnode

@node HINT8
@title "Hint 8"

After upgrading your torpedo systems (which is really
recommended here), you need

- 4 torpedo hits for a Klingon cruiser, a Romulan warbird
  or a Cardassian Galor cruiser,

- 5 for a Jem'Hadar warship and

- 30 for the Borg Cube.

Always have in mind, that one of eight torpedos misses
(except for the Borg, the Borg are always hit). Think
about firing one or two more torpedos to destroy an enemy
ship in only one round safely, you will get much less
damage to your ship because the enemy will fire only once
at you before he is destroyed.

If you can not destroy an enemy in one battle round, but
you have lowered his shields under 100 and have enough
shield energy left for yourself, consider to send an away
team. If the enemy's shields are under 75, think about if
it could be better to fire phasers than another torpedo
(registered version only).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT9}
@endnode

@node HINT9
@title "Hint 9"

Try to lower the shields of one ship of each enemy race
under 100 early in the game. Be sure you have power units
for your own shields left and send an away team to the
enemy ship. The away team will collect knowledge about
the alien race and you will be more effective in future
battles against that race. No, not just you, the
starbases and the other Federation ships will fight
better too and this can be of great use.

Do not send an away team to the Borg Cube, since there is
only one in this scenario and you will not need any
knowledge about the Borg anymore. Because they are very
strong, they possibly will kill you if you give them the
chance for another attack round while you send your away
team.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT10}
@endnode

@node HINT10
@title "Hint 10"

Try a strategy like this:

- Visit only a few starbases, maybe 2 or 3, take lots of
  power units from them so you can get the torpedo upgrade
  quickly. Of course take also all torpedos.

- Then don't waste any more time for starbases, attack your
  enemies right now, starting with the weakest.

- Send away teams to one ship of each race (except the
  Borg) early in the game, so you, the other two Federation
  ships and the starbases can fight with more effectivity.

- Only visit starbases if you really have to due to severe
  damages and lack of power units.

- Try to get the shield and maybe the phaser upgrade, but
  don't waste any turns to visit the starbases to gain
  additional power units just for that.

- As soon as you have both torpedo and shield upgrade, 30
  torpedos, 600 power units for the shields and maybe some
  more power units as reserve, attack the Borg cube, even
  if there are other ships left. Borg cubes always leave
  lots of power units which should help you to visit
  starbases less often. So you can use your turns to
  destroy more enemy ships soon and the starbases will
  defend better because there are more power units left for
  them.

- After destroying the Borg, follow the Jem'Hadar ships at
  highest priority. You should have a strong ship now and
  the Jem'Hadar warships are the ones who are the greatest
  danger for your starbases.
