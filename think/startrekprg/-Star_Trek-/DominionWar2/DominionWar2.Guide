                             The Dominion War 2
==============================================================================
         A scenario for the game "-Star_Trek-" by Frank Mathieson
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+++ UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS
+++ STARFLEET HEADQUARTERS
+++ STARDATE 50996.5
+++ ADMIRAL CONSIERGE

Dear Captain F. MILLER,

a large attack fleet of 50 Jem'Hadar and Cardassian warships is
threatening the Federation's starbases. In addition, a Borg Cube has
been sighted.

I give you the command over the Galaxy class ship USS SAVANNAH
(NCC-1752) in order to join the Federation fleet defending the
Federation against the mighty Dominion and the Borg.

It's up to you and the 5 other Federation ships to save the last
dozen starbases left after the last bloody war against the Dominion.

Good luck, Captain!

@title "What is in this scenario?"

@{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

Estimated difficulty: Medium
Solvable with unregistered version: Yes (tested)

This scenario is thought for people who find the standard game and
the "DominionWar" scenario provided with it too easy, but
"BorgInvasion" and "Madness" too hard. In addition, it takes a little
more time to finish, but since you have a nice number of starbases
and Federation ships at your side, you have some time to find a good
strategy. I think you have a very fair chance to win this one...

@{b}HINTS@{ub}

Here you can find some hints to solve this scenario. However,
try yourself at first, it's twice the fun.

Continue only, if you really fail to win this game.

@{" Read hints " link HINT1}
@endnode

@node HINT1
@title "Hint 1"

Read the hints in the -Star_Trek-Tips.guide provided with the
game itself. All should work in this scenario too.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT2}

@node HINT2
@title "Hint 2"

You have many starbases (12) and as many other Federation ships
in the game as possible (5), so you should have many turns
before the last starbase is destroyed and the game is lost.

Use this time wisely to upgrade your ship before starting to
attack the enemies.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT3}
@endnode

@node HINT3
@title "Hint 3"

To say it more clearly: Try to visit all 12 starbases during
your first 12 turns. Take some power units and all torpedos
from them. Buy upgrades as soon as possible.

If you want to go the safe way, leave one or two starbases out
in order to make them defend much better against the enemy
because they have more power units left.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT4}
@endnode

@node HINT4
@title "Hint 4"

You will need the torpedo upgrade in any case, buy this one
first. The shield upgrade is also useful, especially against
the Borg Cube.

You don't really need ANY of the other upgrades, however the
phaser upgrade can be interesting in the registered version
of -Star_Trek- (which you really should not miss).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT5}
@endnode

@node HINT5
@title "Hint 5"

Always keep your ship in a perfect state. Repairing damages
immediately after a battle is much more effective than using
your power units for the shields. If you run out of power
units, visit a starbase - preferable one which you haven't
visited lately and which hasn't been attacked recently.

However, always leave at least 1 power unit in your shield
systems. If you get attacked by an enemy you win the time
of one turn with it, because no matter how many power units
are available for the shields, the enemy needs one attack
round to make them collapse and greater damages to the ship
itself will just happen one round later then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT6}
@endnode

@node HINT6
@title "Hint 6"

Always leave enough power units in the warp drive,
so you can always warp away when the enemy is too strong
for your ship. This option is interesting when you
encounter the Borg Cube too early or when two enemies
involve you in a battle at the same time, which happens
randomly sometimes.

For each time you engage the warp drive you need 25
power units, so without thinking about damage you should
always leave 50 units in the warp drive before following
an enemy ship so 25 are left next turn.

But since you should expect damage to the ship (during
the battle and also additional after a normal turn in the
unregistered version), you should add some more units
because the warp drive and all the other ship systems will
be less effective. 75 units instead of 50 leave your warp
drive online until 50% of damage. Add some more if you
want to be on the safe side, e.g. 100 are enough to still
have warp available after 66% of damage.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT7}
@endnode

@node HINT7
@title "Hint 7"

However, you should never attack an enemy ship with your
warp drive in mind. Follow enemy ships only if you are
prepared well for a battle and you think you have a
chance to win. Because enemy ships are repaired quite
fast, it is of no use to just damage them instead of
destroying them. You will only loose power units and
torpedos and encounter the enemy ship in totally
repaired state later in the game with high propability.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT8}
@endnode

@node HINT8
@title "Hint 8"

Begin attacking the Cardassian Galor class cruisers, they
only have a strength of 300 (like you). Leave the
Jem'Hadar warships with 375 strength for later in the
game when your ship has also the shield upgrade and some
power units in reserve. Leave the Borg Cube out until the
end.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT9}
@endnode

@node HINT9
@title "Hint 9"

After upgrading your torpedo systems, you need 4 torpedo
hits for a Cardassian Galor cruiser, 5 for a Jem'Hadar
warship and 30 for the Borg Cube.

Always have in mind, that one of eight torpedos misses
(except for the Borg, the Borg are always hit). Think
about firing one or two more torpedos to destroy an enemy
ship in only one round safely, you will get much less
damage to your ship because the enemy will fire only once
at you before he is destroyed.

If you can not destroy an enemy in one battle round, but
you have lowered his shields under 100 and have enough
shield energy left for yourself, consider to send an away
team. If the enemy's shields are under 75, think about if
it could be better to fire phasers than another torpedo
(registered version only).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT10}
@endnode

@node HINT10
@title "Hint 10"

Try to lower the shields of both a Cardassian and a
Jem'Hadar ship under 100 early in the game. Be sure
you have power units for your shields left and send an
away team to the enemy ship. The away team will collect
knowledge about the alien race and you will be more
effective in future battles against that race. No, not
just you, the starbases and the other Federation ships
will fight better too and this can be of great use.

Do not send an away team to the Borg Cube, since there is
only one in this scenario and you will not need any
knowledge about the Borg anymore. Because they are very
strong, they possibly will kill you if you give them the
chance for another attack round while you send your away
team.

@title "Hint 11"

OK, the last one. It is only thought for more experienced
players and basically you will do some things the other
hints told you not to do. ;*)

- Avoid any battles.

- Just visit enough starbases to collect a nice amount of
  power units and torpedos. Leave one or two out so they
  have enough power units to defend themselves until the
  end of the game.

- Do so until you have enough for the torpedo and shield
  upgrades. Buy both.

- Collect enough power units at more starbases until you
  can load your shields with 600 power units.

- Collect at least 30 torpedos.

- Now follow the Borg Cube. Do nothing else than firing
  quantum torpedos at it, the maximum of 8 per round three
  times, 6 in the last round. If you reached the battle
  with not that much damage (mainly a problem of the
  unregistered game version where the ship is also damaged
  when using the warp drive) and nearly 600 power units in
  the shield, it should be no problem to destroy the Borg
  Cube.

- After destroying the Borg Cube you should get lots of
  power units, usually more than 1000. Use them to repair
  your ship.

- You should now have a well equiped Galaxy class ship
  and several hundreds of power units left. You should now
  be able to just follow any enemy ship you want and to
  destroy it easily.

- At first attack a Cardassian and a Jem'Hadar ship. Send
  away parties to them and make your starbases and ships
  stronger in defense to them.

- Because of your reserve power units there should be no
  need any longer to gain more power units from starbases,
  however you might need some new torpedos any now and
  then. But because the starbases now have more power
  units available for their own defense and you made them
  even stronger by your away teams, you will not loose
  much more from the ones left until now. So you can
  easily relax and destroy one enemy ship after each
  other - and you still have your starbases with extra
  power units if you are not that effective or would like
  to try some things out (like the "Ramming Speed"
  function for example...). Easy going, isn't it? ;*)

Shortest description: Borg really can help to give you a
great ship which is better than 50 Dominion ships, you
just need some time and some starbases before... like in
this scenario!
