Dear Captain H. SCHNEIDER,

the Dominion has sent out a fleet of improved Jem'Hadar warships of a
new, unknown class in order to take over the Alpha Quadrant. Our recons
report, that they have much more fire power and much stronger shield
systems now, so the situation is serious.

The galaxy class USS ROYAL (NCC-1801) has order to defeat the Jem'Hadar
at any cost.

Good luck, Captain!

Estimated difficulty: Hard
Solvable with unregistered version: Maybe (not tested)

Another hard one: The Jem'Hadar are really strong this time and only
a few of your Federation allies can become strong enough to defeat
them. So upgrade your ship and do the best you can...

Here you can find some hints to solve this scenario. However,
try yourself at first, it's twice the fun.

Continue only, if you really fail to win this game.

Read the hints in the -Star_Trek-Tips.guide provided with the
game itself. All should work in this scenario too.

@title "Hint 2"

You have to fight against 30 enemies this time which mostly
are much stronger than your ship and of course also stronger
than your starbases.

You can only make it with a well equiped ship, but since
there are only 7 starbases, you might have not that much
time to visit starbases in order to get power units and
upgrades.

So: Try to visit as few starbases as necessary when starting
the game, but try to upgrade as quick as possible.

As usual, leave some starbases out in order to give them
full power units and better odds to defend at least against
the Cardassian cruisers.

@title "Hint 3"

You will need the torpedo upgrade in any case, buy this one
first. You should also purchase the shield upgrade to defend
yourself better against the Jem'Hadar. You will really need
the shield upgrade if you like to lower the shields of a
Jem'Hadar warship in order to send an away team.

You don't really need ANY of the other upgrades, however the
phaser upgrade can be interesting in the registered version
of -Star_Trek- (which you really should not miss).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT4}

@node HINT4
@title "Hint 4"

Here is a trick to get at least one upgrade quick (should be
the torpedo upgrade):

- Start the game

- Keep your fingers crossed, that you are not attacked in the
  first turn, it might cost you power units

- Go to Engineering/EPS and transfer the 100 power units from
  the phasers and the 100 from main power to reserve energy

- Go to a starbase with the Helm menu

- Visit Engineering/EPS again and transfer all main power
  units to reserve - with some luck it could be more than
  100 units so you have more than 400 reserve units now

- Dock to the starbase, if it is in perfect state, it has
  300 power units, just take the around 200 you need and
  buy your first upgrade after just one turn... ;*)

@{" Read another hint " link HINT5}
@endnode

@node HINT5
@title "Hint 5"

Always keep your ship in a perfect state. Repairing damages
immediately after a battle is much more effective than using
your power units for the shields. If you run out of power
units, visit a starbase - preferable one which you haven't
visited lately and which hasn't been attacked recently.

However, always leave at least 1 power unit in your shield
systems. If you get attacked by an enemy you win the time
of one turn with it, because no matter how many power units
are available for the shields, the enemy needs one attack
round to make them collapse and greater damages to the ship
itself will just happen one round later then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT6}
@endnode

@node HINT6
@title "Hint 6"

Always leave enough power units in the warp drive,
so you can always warp away when the enemy is too strong
for your ship. This option is interesting when two enemies
involve you in a battle at the same time, which happens
randomly sometimes or if a Jem'Hadar warship attacks you
before you have your upgrades.

For each time you engage the warp drive you need 25
power units, so without thinking about damage you should
always leave 50 units in the warp drive before following
an enemy ship so 25 are left next turn.

But since you should expect damage to the ship (during
the battle and also additional after a normal turn in the
unregistered version), you should add some more units
because the warp drive and all the other ship systems will
be less effective. 75 units instead of 50 leave your warp
drive online until 50% of damage. Add some more if you
want to be on the safe side, e.g. 100 are enough to still
have warp available after 66% of damage.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT7}

@node HINT7
@title "Hint 7"

However, you should never attack an enemy ship with your
warp drive in mind. Follow enemy ships only if you are
prepared well for a battle and you think you have a
chance to win. Because enemy ships are repaired quite
fast, it is of no use to just damage them instead of
destroying them. You will only loose power units and
torpedos and encounter the enemy ship in totally
repaired state later in the game with high propability.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT8}
@endnode

@node HINT8
@title "Hint 8"

Begin attacking the Cardassian Galor class cruisers, they
only have a strength of 300 (like you). Leave the
Jem'Hadar warships with 490 strength for later in the
game when your ship might also have the shield upgrade and
some power units in reserve - it's even easier then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT9}
@endnode

@node HINT9
@title "Hint 9"

After upgrading your torpedo systems, you need 4 torpedo
hits for a Cardassian Galor cruiser and 7 for a Jem'Hadar
warship.

Always have in mind, that one of eight torpedos misses
Think about firing one or two more torpedos to destroy an
enemy ship in only one round safely, you will get much less
damage to your ship because the enemy will fire only once
at you before he is destroyed.

If you can not destroy an enemy in one battle round, but
you have lowered his shields under 100 and have enough
shield energy left for yourself, consider to send an away
team. If the enemy's shields are under 75, think about if
it could be better to fire phasers than another torpedo
(registered version only).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT10}
@endnode

@node HINT10
@title "Hint 10"

Try to lower the shields of both a Cardassian and a
Jem'Hadar ship under 100 early in the game. Be sure
you have power units for your shields left and send an
away team to the enemy ship. The away team will collect
knowledge about the alien race and you will be more
effective in future battles against that race. No, not
just you, the starbases and the other Federation ships
will fight better too and this can be of great use.

Before trying to send an away team to the Jem'Hadar, get
both torpedo and shield upgrade and make sure, you have
at least 400 power units in your shield systems, because
your ship will be damaged at least one more time by the
Jem'Hadar.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT11}
@endnode

@node HINT11
@title "Hint 11"

Try a strategy like this:

- Visit starbases first to get the torpedo and shield
  upgrades, but try to get them as quick as possible. You
  may take nearly all power units from the first starbases
  you visit, but leave some of them out, so they can defend
  themselves better during the game.

- Do not attack the Jem'Hadar with less than 400 power
  units in your shield systems. If you can not go to
  starbases to gain power units, attack the Cardassians
  first. Try to win quick by firing one torpedo more than
  needed, so you will only be attacked once, which results
  in much less battle damage.

- Send away teams to both a Cardassian and a Jem'Hadar ship
  early in the game. The starbases should get the extra
  effectiviness this way to defend at least against the
  Cardassians. With lots of luck some of the Federation
  ship can be made strong enough this way to win against
  the Jem'Hadar ships, when starting the game, they don't
  have any chance.

- When you have a well equiped ship, concentrate on
  attacking the Jem'Hadar ships before they destroy all
  your starbases.

In any case, you have to take the Jem'Hadar out of the
game quickly, they will do a great job in destroying the
much weaker starbases otherwise.
