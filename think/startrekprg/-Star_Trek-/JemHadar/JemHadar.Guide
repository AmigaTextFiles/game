@title "What is in this scenario?"

@{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

Estimated difficulty: Hard
Solvable with unregistered version: Yes (tested)

This is a hard one: There are lots of strong enemies, but only a few
starbases out there. Decide yourself how much time you take to
upgrade your ship before destroying as much enemies as quick as
possible - you might have not that much time!

ENEMY UNITS

32x Dominion Warship (JEM'HADAR CLASS)         375

YOUR UNITS

Here you can find some hints to solve this scenario. However,
try yourself at first, it's twice the fun.

Continue only, if you really fail to win this game.

Read the hints in the -Star_Trek-Tips.guide provided with the
game itself. All should work in this scenario too.

@title "Hint 2"

You have to fight against 38 enemies this time and most of
them are stronger than your ship is at the start. Normally
you should visit some starbases to upgrade your ship well
before trying to attack them, but since there are only 7
of them, you don't have much time before the Dominion will
destroy even the last one and the game is lost.

So just visit only 3 or 4 starbases at the beginning of the
game and get nearly all power units from them. Of course
you will risk, that they can not defend that well against
the enemies then, but you need to get at least the topedo
upgrade and as many torpedos as possible quickly in this
scenario.

In any case, leave at least 3 starbases out in order to
let them defend better (more power units) until the end of
the game.

@title "Hint 3"

You will need the torpedo upgrade in any case, buy this one
first. The shield upgrade is also useful, but don't waste
much time for visiting starbases just in order to get this
one - you might not have that time.

You don't really need ANY of the other upgrades, however the
phaser upgrade can be interesting in the registered version
of -Star_Trek- (which you really should not miss).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT4}

@node HINT4
@title "Hint 4"

Always keep your ship in a perfect state. Repairing damages
immediately after a battle is much more effective than using
your power units for the shields. If you run out of power
units, visit a starbase - preferable one which you haven't
visited lately and which hasn't been attacked recently.

However, always leave at least 1 power unit in your shield
systems. If you get attacked by an enemy you win the time
of one turn with it, because no matter how many power units
are available for the shields, the enemy needs one attack
round to make them collapse and greater damages to the ship
itself will just happen one round later then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT5}
@endnode

@node HINT5
@title "Hint 5"

Always leave enough power units in the warp drive,
so you can always warp away when the enemy is too strong
for your ship. This option is interesting when two enemies
involve you in a battle at the same time, which happens
randomly sometimes.

For each time you engage the warp drive you need 25
power units, so without thinking about damage you should
always leave 50 units in the warp drive before following
an enemy ship so 25 are left next turn.

But since you should expect damage to the ship (during
the battle and also additional after a normal turn in the
unregistered version), you should add some more units
because the warp drive and all the other ship systems will
be less effective. 75 units instead of 50 leave your warp
drive online until 50% of damage. Add some more if you
want to be on the safe side, e.g. 100 are enough to still
have warp available after 66% of damage.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT6}

@node HINT6
@title "Hint 6"

However, you should never attack an enemy ship with your
warp drive in mind. Follow enemy ships only if you are
prepared well for a battle and you think you have a
chance to win. Because enemy ships are repaired quite
fast, it is of no use to just damage them instead of
destroying them. You will only loose power units and
torpedos and encounter the enemy ship in totally
repaired state later in the game with high propability.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT7}

@title "Hint 7"

Begin attacking the Cardassian Galor class cruisers, they
only have a strength of 300 (like you). Leave the
Jem'Hadar warships with 375 strength for later in the
game when your ship might also have the shield upgrade and
some power units in reserve - it's even easier then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT8}
@endnode

@node HINT8
@title "Hint 8"

After upgrading your torpedo systems, you need 4 torpedo
hits for a Cardassian Galor cruiser and 5 for a Jem'Hadar
warship.

Always have in mind, that one of eight torpedos misses
Think about firing one or two more torpedos to destroy an
enemy ship in only one round safely, you will get much less
damage to your ship because the enemy will fire only once
at you before he is destroyed.

If you can not destroy an enemy in one battle round, but
you have lowered his shields under 100 and have enough
shield energy left for yourself, consider to send an away
team. If the enemy's shields are under 75, think about if
it could be better to fire phasers than another torpedo
(registered version only).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT9}
@endnode

@node HINT9
@title "Hint 9"

Try to lower the shields of both a Cardassian and a
Jem'Hadar ship under 100 early in the game. Be sure
you have power units for your shields left and send an
away team to the enemy ship. The away team will collect
knowledge about the alien race and you will be more
effective in future battles against that race. No, not
just you, the starbases and the other Federation ships
will fight better too and this can be of great use.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT10}

@node HINT10
@title "Hint 10"

Try a strategy like this:

- Visit starbases first to get the torpedo update, but try
  to get it quickly by taking lots of power units from the
  first 2 or 3.

- Don't waste any more time visiting starbases, concentrate
  on destroying the enemy ships now. Purchase the shield
  and maybe the phaser upgrade later in the game when you
  already have to go to a starbase.

- Send away teams to both a Cardassian and a Jem'Hadar ship
  early in the game. This might give the starbases just the
  extra effectiviness to survive the attack of a Jem'Hadar
  ship.

- Attack the Cardassians first.

Short: Try to solve the game quickly - Jem'Hadar are much
stronger than starbases and they will do their destroying
job well.
