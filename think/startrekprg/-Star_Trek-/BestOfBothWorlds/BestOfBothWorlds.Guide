@{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

Estimated difficulty: Hard
Solvable with unregistered version: Yes (tested)

This Borg scenario is not that hard as the one provided with
-Star_Trek-, but indeed: you have to make it against the Borg! You
have some more starbases this time, giving you a fair chance to get
a good ship and the other Federation ships are a bit stronger too,
which could give you the time you need. But don't forget: We are
talking about the Borg! Don't get assimilated!

Here you can find some hints to solve this scenario. However,
try yourself at first, it's twice the fun.

Continue only, if you really fail to win this game.

Read the hints in the -Star_Trek-Tips.guide provided with the
game itself. All should work in this scenario too.

@title "Hint 2"

You have quite a lot starbases (9), all Federation ships (5)
which are stronger this time, but you have to fight against
10 Borg Cubes.

So visiting as many starbases as possible before they get
destroyed by the Borg is highly recommended. You only have a
chance to win with a best equiped ship.

The starbases don't have much chances to defeat an attacking
Borg ship, they are much weaker than the Federation ships
this time. So don't mind too much to take lots of power units
from some of the starbases and of course all torpedos. Don't
hesitate to upgrade your ship as good and as fast as possible.

@title "Hint 3"

You really need both the torpedo and the shield update to
survive a battle against a Borg ship, so buy those ones.

You don't really need ANY of the other upgrades, however the
phaser upgrade can be interesting in the registered version
of -Star_Trek- (which you really should not miss).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT4}
@endnode

@node HINT4
@title "Hint 4"

Always keep your ship in a perfect state. Repairing damages
immediately after a battle is much more effective than using
your power units for the shields. If you run out of power
units, you should normally visit a starbase - preferable one
which you haven't visited lately and which hasn't been
attacked recently.

However, always leave at least 1 power unit in your shield
systems. If you get attacked by an enemy you win the time
of one turn with it, because no matter how many power units
are available for the shields, the enemy needs one attack
round to make them collapse and greater damages to the ship
itself will just happen one round later then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT5}
@endnode

@node HINT5
@title "Hint 5"

Always leave enough power units in the warp drive,
so you can always warp away when the enemy is too strong
for your ship. This option is interesting when two enemies
involve you in a battle at the same time, which happens
randomly sometimes. Of course you will also need your
warp drive if the Borg encounter you too early.

For each time you engage the warp drive you need 25
power units, so without thinking about damage you should
always leave 50 units in the warp drive before following
an enemy ship so 25 are left next turn.

But since you should expect damage to the ship (during
the battle and also additional after a normal turn in the
unregistered version), you should add some more units
because the warp drive and all the other ship systems will
be less effective. 75 units instead of 50 leave your warp
drive online until 50% of damage. Add some more if you
want to be on the safe side, e.g. 100 are enough to still
have warp available after 66% of damage.

@title "Hint 6"

However, you should never attack an enemy ship with your
warp drive in mind. Follow enemy ships only if you are
prepared well for a battle and you think you have a
chance to win. Because enemy ships are repaired quite
fast, it is of no use to just damage them instead of
destroying them. You will only loose power units and
torpedos and encounter the enemy ship in totally
repaired state later in the game with high propability.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT7}

@node HINT7
@title "Hint 7"

To win against a Borg cube you need 30 torpedos (after
upgrading them) and also the shield upgrade at nearly
full strength (600 power units).

You don't have to matter about missing torpedos, the
Borg are always hit. You should fire the maximum of
8 torpedos three times at a Borg cube and the other
6 afterwards.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT8}
@endnode

@node HINT8
@title "Hint 8"

If you collect 700-800 power units for your reserve
before attacking a Borg cube, you should be able to
repair all damages and to reload your shields to
full or nearly full power (600) even during a battle.

However, using the engineering menu in a battle
instead of switching to the tactical menu is always
"expensive", because the Borg cube has time to attack
you one more time and to damage your systems even
more, so use this option only if you really need to!

The only situation you should consider a repair
during a battle is when your shields fail and you
don't have a chance to kill the Borg cube during the
next turn. Better try to destroy the enemy and repair
afterwards without beeing attacked in any other case.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT9}
@endnode

@node HINT9
@title "Hint 9"

Phasers aren't the best idea to defeat the Borg with,
because their effectivity is randomly and they
usually do less damage than torpedos. A full salvo of
8 quantum torpedos always does 600 units of damage.
A phaser does between 150 and 300 units of damage only
and it even will be less effective when your ship is
damaged. In addition you will have to switch to the
engineering menu after firing them (you can fire two
times at full power with the phaser upgrade) in order
to transfer new power units to the phaser systems.
Remember: Each visit to the engineering menu gives the
Borg the time for another attack.

Of course you can repair your ship during the battle
(see hint before) and reload the phasers, but you need
lots of power units for it (up to 198 to repair your
ship, up to 600 to reload the shields and up to 600 to
reload the phasers).

You see, torpedos really make life easier against the
Borg, so try to collect enough of them before
attacking a Borg cube. Try to use phasers only if you
attack a Borg ship which is severely damaged and also
if you do not have enough torpedos, but lots of power
units - don't forget to repair in this case.

@node HINT10
@title "Hint 10"

It's a good idea to send an away team to a Borg cube to
gain knowledge about them and to fight against them more
effective during the next turns, but going aboard of a
Borg cube is a very hard task.

To do so you need 30 quantum torpedos, shields with
around 600 power units and 600-700 power units as a
reserve. Problems in collecting that much power units?
Then just destroy a first cube to gain lots of them and
try to send an away team to a second Borg cube instead
of trying it with the first ship.

Attack a Borg cube as described before, but instead of
6 fire only 5 torpedos in the fourth battle round. The
Borg's shields should now be down to 25 units. Of course
you can try to lower their shields to something below
100 also by using phasers. Your own shields will also not
look very well and you will be attacked at least two more
times by the Borg, so it is highly recommended to go to
the engineering menu now and to repair the ship. In
addition you should reload your shields. Then go to the
Ops menu (you will be attacked once by the Borg) and
send your away team. Then go back to the tactical menu
(again you will be attacked once) and destroy the Borg
cube, e.g. with a torpedo.

A hard task, wasn't it? But now you, the starbases and
the Federation ships will be more effective when
fighting against the Borg.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT11}
@endnode

@node HINT11
@title "Hint 11"

Once you have destroyed the first Borg cube, everything
is a bit easier. Any destroyed Borg cube should give you
lots of power units (usually more than 1000) and some
torpedos. Since you already should have a good ship to
encounter the first Borg at all (torpedo and shield
upgrades), you can now attack the Borg cubes left.

The only problems to solve in this scenario are:

- You have to upgrade your ship quickly to have a ship
  you can resist a Borg cube with.

- You need to collect lots of torpedos, the destroyed
  Borg cubes will give you many power units, but not
  that much torpedos, so you have to take most of them
  from the starbases. Phasers aren't a good alternative
  against the Borg.

- You have not much time for upgrading and collecting
  torpedos, since the Federation ships and - much more
  important - the starbases have no chance to defend
  themselves against the attack of a Borg cube. You
  just have to be faster than the Borg...
