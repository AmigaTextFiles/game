This guide includes some tips on the shareware and registered versions of
the game.  If you want to win the game, you'll have to read this.

Everybody should read the General Tips,  Registered users should only read

                                General Tips
==============================================================================

1. Leave the Borg until last.

2. Upgrade to Quantum torpedoes ASAP.

3. When fully charged, Star bases can only defend themselfs against
   Klingons, Romulans and Cardassians.  This is to do with power, not
   Torpedoes.  You can take as many of them as you like.

4. When first starting the game, take all the available power from all of
   the starbases.  And upgrade to Quantum torpedoes when you are at the third
   one.  WARNING.  This leaves to starbases vunerable to attack, but it's
   worth the risk!

5. 1 in 8 shots miss!  Except with the Borg.

6. Try to keep your shields and warp drive powered.  To defend yourself,
   and to run away!

7. If your shields get extremely low, don't worry too much.  Even if they
   have only 1 unit of power in them,  they will still work for one hit.  This
   is very good if you have to run away.  Just put only unit of power into the
   shields, and at least 25 units into the warp drive.  When you leave
   engineering,  the shields will take 80% of damage and fail.  But with any
   luck you'll still have enough in the warp drive to run away to the nearist
   starbase.

8. If you're in trouble just keep warping to the next starbase.  Collect
   all the power and torpedoes.

==============================================================================

1. Remember, your phasers don't work.  Yet you start with 100 units of
   energy in them.  This could be put to good use in another system.

2. Try to repair damage before going to warp.  If you're dadly damaged you
   could die when you use the warp drive.

3. Torpedoes are your only form of attack.  Try not to use too many to kill
   the enemy.

4. Pay regular (but not too regular) visits to the starbases to collect
   torpedoes.

5. Register.  It only costs £5.

                               Registered Tips.
==============================================================================

1.  Because of the way Phasers work, you won't always cause as much damaged
    as you thought.  It'll be between half the units used and all of the
    units used.  Consult the table below

    Amount of |  Min.   |  Max.
    Power     |  Effect |  Effect.  
    ------------------------------
        50    |    25   |    50
       100    |    50   |   100
       150    |    75   |   150
       200    |   100   |   200
       250    |   125   |   250
       300    |   150   |   300

2. Don't repair Damage!  Leave that for the engineering crews during warp. 
   Unless you are following an enemy.
