                           The Last Cardassians
==============================================================================
         A scenario for the game "-Star_Trek-" by Frank Mathieson
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+++ UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS
+++ STARFLEET HEADQUARTERS
+++ STARDATE 50998.5
+++ ADMIRAL VLADIKOV

Dear Captain H.-R. WATERS,

the Cardassians have been defeated, the ships of the Federation and the
Bajorans have finally invaded Cardassia Prime.

The last Cardassian cruisers have been reported to have joined at system
Trivia-9 to a last, giantic battle fleet. We know most of the ships have
been involved in recent battles, so they are damaged and not that strong
as you are used to, but it really are MANY ships.

The USS VECTOR (NCC-1742) has order to immediatly join the Federation
fleet to defend us against the probably last strike of the Cardassians.

Good luck, Captain!

@node SCENARIOOVERVIEW
@title "What is in this scenario?"

@{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

Estimated difficulty: Medium
Solvable with unregistered version: Yes (tested) - but here, the
registered version is HIGHLY recommended!

This is an interesting, not that easy to win scenario, but more
experienced players should be able to do it in around 50 turns.
The enemy ships are weaker than you are used to, but there are lots
of them! Since you have not that much starbases, you will not have
much time to upgrade your ship. Try to defeat the enemy quickly even
with a not so perfect ship before all starbases are destroyed.

Here you can find some hints to solve this scenario. However,
try yourself at first, it's twice the fun.

Continue only, if you really fail to win this game.

Read the hints in the -Star_Trek-Tips.guide provided with the
game itself. All should work in this scenario too.

@title "Hint 2"

You have not that many starbases (8), all Federation ships (5)
but also lots of enemies (50), so visiting all starbases at
first as usual is a good idea, but not the best one.

Act wisely and visit only a few starbases first, just enough
to get the torpedo upgrade. Then start to destroy some
Cardassian cruisers in order to have less of them attacking
the starbases.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT3}

@node HINT3
@title "Hint 3"

It's always nice to have the shield upgrade in addition to the
torpedo upgrade, but destroying many enemies quickly should be
the higher priority in this scenario. Since the enemies aren't
that strong, you can win the game even without those two
upgrades.

You don't really need ANY of the other upgrades, however the
phaser upgrade can be interesting in the registered version
of -Star_Trek- (which you really should not miss).

@{" Read another hint " link HINT4}

@title "Hint 4"

Always keep your ship in a perfect state. Repairing damages
immediately after a battle is much more effective than using
your power units for the shields. If you run out of power
units, you should normally visit a starbase - preferable one
which you haven't visited lately and which hasn't been
attacked recently.

But since the enemies aren't that strong this time, consider
to have some more battles with a not that perfect ship before
"wasting" a turn to go to a starbase.

However, always leave at least 1 power unit in your shield
systems. If you get attacked by an enemy you win the time
of one turn with it, because no matter how many power units
are available for the shields, the enemy needs one attack
round to make them collapse and greater damages to the ship
itself will just happen one round later then.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT5}
@endnode

@node HINT5
@title "Hint 5"

Always leave enough power units in the warp drive,
so you can always warp away when the enemy is too strong
for your ship. This option is interesting when two enemies
involve you in a battle at the same time, which happens
randomly sometimes. Since there are lots of enemies here,
you can get into this trouble more often than in other
scenarios, you can even meet more than two enemy ships at
a time.

For each time you engage the warp drive you need 25
power units, so without thinking about damage you should
always leave 50 units in the warp drive before following
an enemy ship so 25 are left next turn.

But since you should expect damage to the ship (during
the battle and also additional after a normal turn in the
unregistered version), you should add some more units
because the warp drive and all the other ship systems will
be less effective. 75 units instead of 50 leave your warp
drive online until 50% of damage. Add some more if you
want to be on the safe side, e.g. 100 are enough to still
have warp available after 66% of damage.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT6}

@title "Hint 6"

However, you should never attack an enemy ship with your
warp drive in mind. Follow enemy ships only if you are
prepared well for a battle and you think you have a
chance to win. Because enemy ships are repaired quite
fast, it is of no use to just damage them instead of
destroying them. You will only loose power units and
torpedos and encounter the enemy ship in totally
repaired state later in the game with high propability.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT7}
@endnode

@node HINT7
@title "Hint 7"

You need 5 torpedo hits to destroy a Cardassian cruiser or
4 if you purchased the torpedo upgrade. Even if you have
an unregistered version of -Star_Trek-, consider not to
get the torpedo upgrade - one torpedo more or less might
not be that important as destroying many enemy ships
quickly. In the registered version, you should be able
to do a lot of your work with your phasers.

Always have in mind, that one of eight torpedos misses
Think about firing one or two more torpedos to destroy an
enemy ship in only one round safely, you will get much
less damage to your ship because the enemy will fire only
once at you before he is destroyed.

If you can not destroy an enemy in one battle round, but
you have lowered his shields under 100 and have enough
shield energy left for yourself, consider to send an away
team. If the enemy's shields are under 75, think about if
it could be better to fire phasers than another torpedo
(registered version only). You might need lots of
torpedos in this scenario...

@{" Read another hint " link HINT8}
@endnode

@node HINT8
@title "Hint 8"

Try to lower the shields of a Cardassian cruiser under 100
early in the game. Be sure you have power units for your
shields left and send an away team to the enemy ship. The
away team will collect knowledge about the alien race and
you will be more effective in future battles against that
race. No, not just you, the starbases and the other
Federation ships will fight better too and this can be of
great use.

@title "Hint 9"

Play this scenario with a registered version of -Star_Trek-.
This is not thought to be a commercial, but you have two
advantages in the registered version:

1. You can use the phasers whenever you are in lack of
   torpedos.

2. The ship is not damaged when using the warp drive, so
   you can safe lots of power units you need for repairs in
   the unregistered version - and use them in the phasers,
   of course.

Both things are of great use, especially at beginning of
this scenario. You have no need to visit starbases that
often and you can reduce the number of Cardassians much
faster.

@{" Read another hint " link HINT10}
@endnode

@node HINT10
@title "Hint 10"

My favorite strategy in short (I needed only 48 turns
recently):

- Don't waste any time at all with starbases, directly
  attack the Cardassians.

- Continue attacking the Cardassians even if your ship is
  damaged and doesn't have full shield power - the enemy
  ships aren't perfect either.

- If you have enough torpedos and your shields are at
  good strength, you can even win against two Cardassians
  at the same time. Just make sure, you destroy the first
  enemy ship in only one round (e.g. by firing one or two
  more torpedos than needed in case a torpedo is missing).

- Don't mind that much to get the torpedo upgrade. It is
  not really necessary here.

- Visit starbases only when necessary. Buy upgrades only
  when you already have to visit a starbase because you
  really need torpedos or power units.

Shortest description: Follow and destroy a Cardassian
cruiser each turn, even if your ship is a wreck! ;*)
