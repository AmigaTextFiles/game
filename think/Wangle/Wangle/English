Before starting the Description of the game, I want to adress some lines
to all the PD-Distributors and Software Publishers:

If you want to distribute Wangle, you have to get my written Permission.
You are not allowed to sell my Program on your own PD-Catalog or include
it in Bookware. You may not distribute it with commercial Software or
Hardware, you may not give it away as advertising Gift to get
subscriptions for your magazine, etc. If you wonder why : I've seen all of
it and I think that these people are stealing my mental property.

Every Version of this Game contains an Entry in the Form of "This Version
is only for XYX...', so everyone can find out, if you have got my
permission to distribute this game. If anyone notices this Game on a
PD-Catalog without a matching Entry, please contact me and give me the
adress of the PD-Distributor.

I'm sorry I have to touch this aspect again and again, but a lot of greedy
People make money out of my work - I regard them as immoral.

__________________________________________________________________________

The Rules of the Game:

After loading the Game, the Titlescreen will show up (this is the time to
check, if the distributor stole the game). After pressing any mousebutton,
you will see the main screen with a kind of Highscore, containing up to
five Names and some additional Info (next level to play, number of moves
up to that level). Klick one of the five Entries with the left Mousbutton
and type your Name. If you click on one of the (existing) Entries with the
right Mousbutton, the according Level will be loaded and you are ready to
play this Level without typing your Name.

The second change of concept introduced with this game is: If you finish the
game, your scores will be saved automatically, so write-enable your Disk !
The state af the game will only be saved, if you reached the second level
and you don't have to go through the hassle of loading your last Score any
more and you can't forget to save your Score any more.

The aim of the game is to remove all of the colored Squares (red, green,
blue, yellow) by grouping squares of the same Color into bigger Squares.

  Wrong:  ####                Correct: ##
                                       ##

To move the squares: move the mousepointer above them, press the left
mousebutton and drag in the direction the square should move, release
the left mousbutton - thats all, the square should move until it reaches
a wall.

If you managed to group 4 squares (2 by 2), the squares will be removed.
In the lower left corner, you can see how many squares of the according
color have to be removed to get to the next level, but beware: there are
levels, in which some squares may remain on the board.

Gray squares are walls: you have to bypass them somehow, squares with
cracks may only be passed twice by the colored squares, the third square
passing such an area will be lost. And you can't place a colored square on
it for a longer time: the crash will be immediate.

Another gimmick are the light bulbs (dark and light ones). You may have
guessed it: touch a dark one with a colored one and light will be off -
you can only see the colored squares and have to touch a lighted bulb to
switch on the light again.

Finally, there is the magic Reproducer (Yellow with 4 red Triangels).
Touch it and you will get another square on the opposite side of the
reproducer - this square will have the same color. The reproducer will
enable you to create new squares - it might be easier to produce new
squares than grouping the existing ones.

If movement of the squares seems to be to slow or to fast for your
machine, edit the File "TIME" with any ASCII-Editor - bigger values of
the number result in slower speed. So you have got the possibility to
adjust your favorite Speed. A3000 = 10000 / A500 = 800.

There is no Timelimit in this game - you have got all the time you need to
complete your level without the possibility of getting angry because you
would have finished the level in just about 2 Seconds - but then the Time
expired ...

If you want to replay the level, press "Replay", if you want to quit, try
"Quit", and if you click on "New Player, you get back to the main screen
and can choose a new Player.


The Editor
----------

Using the Editor should be intuitive, you click on the sqares and then
place the Squares with your Mouse. Attention: you have to adjust the
number of grouped Squares to remove, so if you've got 4 red squares that
must be removed in a level, adjust the Number for red Squares in the lower
right corner to 1.
