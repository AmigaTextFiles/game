3.So, what's this game about?

Well, ever heard of >>concentration<< (aka >>Memory<< in Germany)? The  aim  of
this  game  is  to  find  all  pairs  of  matching cards (or stones). A pair of
matching cards is a pair of stones with identical images on them.



4.Installation

To install, simply drag the program's icon into the desired destination  drawer
or  you  can  copy  the  files  'ThinkAMania'  and 'ThinkAMania.info' into that
directory.
If  you  run ThinkAMania, you will be asked if you'd like to accept the default
(which  is  PAL/NTSC:Hires Interlace) or last saved screenmode.  Click on "Use"
to  proceed  with this mode, click on "Select new" to choose a new one or click
on  "Cancel"  to  abort  the  program.  If you clicked on "Select new", you can
choose  a  screenmode  via an asl.library screenmode requester.  After that you
will  be  asked,  whether you'd like to "Save" this screenmode for further use,
"Use"  it  only  in this game or "Cancel" the program.  If you selected "Save",
your choice will be stored as a tooltype entry in the accompanying icon.
If  you wish to bypass this selection to always use the default (PAL/NTSC:Hires
Interlace), simply add a tooltype USEDEFAULT.  This can be useful if you have a
screenmode promoter enabled which does the trick for you.

Note: Make sure the selected mode is able to display a region of 640x400 pixels
or you will get an autoscrolling screen. 



5.How to play with this program

You can turn a stone and thus make its image visible by clicking  (left  button
:-))  on  it. Only two stones can be examined at each draw. If both stones show
the same image, the active player gets one point (score display). If the images
differ,  the  draw counter is incremented and it's the other player's (if there
is any other player) turn. The  active  player's  score  and  draw  display  is
display  in  red  letters,  the  inactive's in gray. After finding all matching
pairs the best players can enter their names  in  the  highscore  list.  If  no
player qualifies for a highscore the program just proceeds to the main menu.


                  The menu offers you the following choices:


 ONE PLAYER/TWO PLAYERS * Toggle one and two player mode.

 SOUND ON/SOUND OFF     * Toggle soundeffects on/off.

 COLORS                 * Change background and stonecolors.  We provided a few
                          colormaps  that  we  think  reduce flickering without
                          flickerfixers or AGA chipset.

 HIGHSCORES             * Show  highscores.  To leave the highscore window just
                          click  into it.  There are separate lists for one and
                          two  player modes.  Only the list for the active mode
                          is   shown.   You  can  reset  highscores  by  simply
                          deleting the file ThinkAMania.HIGH in the current and
                          in the S: directory.

 DEFAULT                * Every possible option is reset to its default setting.

 NEW                    * A  new game is started.  If you want to continue your
                          current   (not   yet  finished)  game,  press  ESCAPE
                          instead.

 QUIT                   * Leave program.  The highscore list is saved to either
                          the current or the S:  directory (depends on where it
                          was  read  from  (default  is  S:))  under  the  name
                          ThinkAMania.HIGH.   You should enable write access if
                          you like to have up to date highscores.


                 Furthermore you can use one keyboard command:


 ESCAPE                 * Toggle between menu and game mode without leaving the
                          current  game.  If you only change uncritical options
                          (colors,  sound  on/off),  the  current  game  can be
                          continued  by  pressing  ESCAPE  again.   But  if you
                          changed  the  number of players, it wouldn't make any
                          sense  to  continue the current game (a single player
                          always  has to find all pairs, so only the draw count
                          is  considered  for a highscore).  In this case a new
                          board has to be build.
