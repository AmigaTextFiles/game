@{fg shine}Legal Notice.@{fg text}

 @{fg highlight}1) @{fg text}This product and its author cannot be held responsible for any loss of
    control over your bodily functions / damage to your computer system or
    any other niggle you may come across after playing.  Sorry.

 @{fg highlight}2) @{fg text}The files that should have been extracted from the archive
    or should be on the disk are as follows...

 @{fg highlight}3) @{fg text}This version of Connexion is @{b}Public Domain@{ub}, and can therefore be
    distributed (as long as all of the above files are included
    @{b}unaltered@{ub}) for free!

@{fg shine}Additional notice to Magazine and Compilation people@{fg text}

 If you would like to put Connexion on a magazine coverdisk or include it
in a compilation (on floppy @{b}or@{ub} compact disc), all that I ask in addition
to the above is that you send me a copy of the magazine (with the
coverdisk of course) or compilation for my records.  You'll need to know
my address for this, so @{"here it is." Link ENVELOPE}  Thanks in advance.

@endnode

@node ENVELOPE "The Snail-Mail address for those who need it..."

@{fg shine}Postal address@{fg text}

      ENGLAND.

@node INSTALL "Hope Street"

@{fg shine}Installing Connexion@{fg text}

@{b}With the install script...@{ub}

 Installling is now even easier, thanks to the install script which has
been included.  If you have the Commodore "Installer" utility on your
system, just double-click on the "Install_Connexion" icon.  You'll be
asked to select a destination directory for the game in which a new
drawer called "Connexion" will be created.  All the necessary files
will then be copied across into this directory.  No assigns should
be necessary, so you can play Connexion as soon as you've installed it!

@{b}The old-fashioned way...@{ub}

 If you have the archived version, just un-archive the LHA file to wherever
you want the program to go.  A drawer will be created, in which all the
necessary files will be placed.  Or un-archive to your Ram disk, and drag
the "Connexion" drawer which is created to wherever you want it.

 If you get the game in un-archived form on floppy disk, and want to put it
on your hard disk, just make sure that all the files go in the same drawer,
so that the directory structure remains the same (see @{" Legal notes " Link LEGAL}).


@{fg shine}Note:@{fg text}

 Everything should be okay if the directory structure remains as intended.
If the program won't load, check this before @{"contacting me." Link FINAL}

@endnode

@node PLAY "The Game"

@{fg shine}Playing Connexion.@{fg text}

 Once loaded, you will be confronted with the selection screen of Connexion.
This is where you set the preferences for your game.  There are several
different aspects of play which you can change by clicking on the options
on the screen.  Moving the mouse pointer over an option (yellow lettering)
will cause further information detailing that option to appear in the
message bar (at the bottom of the screen).

 The options... (as they appear on screen)

 @{" Number of players " Link PLAYERS} One-player, Two-player or demo game?
 @{" Grid dimensions   " Link DIMENSIONS} How big is your grid?
 @{" Line length       " Link CONNEX} How long is your line?
 @{" Games in a match  " Link GAMES} How many games can you win?

 Further information...

 @{" Playing screen    " Link PLAYSCREEN} What's all this?
 @{" Quitting          " Link HOW2QUIT} How do I escape?
 @{" A.I. routines     " Link AINT} Artificial Intelligence.

@endnode

@node AINT "How do they do that?"

@{fg shine}A quick guide to coding Artificial Intelligence...?@{fg text}

 Don't.

 No, seriously.  In Connexion, I've had my first bash at coding some
"Artificial Intelligence" (or "Virtual Stupidity") routines.  They're
basic.  I'm still pretty chuffed with them though - you can sit and
watch a demo game, which is a novelty when you know you made it possible.

 However, as I said, they are basic routines.  God knows how, for example,
Team 17 coded the AI for Breed 3D 2.  Well, I s'pose Team 17 know as well :)

 I'd like to be able to improve on these AI routines that I've written,
so if anyone out there has any constructice comments, or knows if there's
any good literature (books, docs on the Aminet etc.) about, please
@{" drop me a line. " Link FINAL}

@endnode

@node HOW2QUIT "I can't take it any more!"

@{fg shine}Not playing Connexion :)@{fg text}

 When playing, you can press "@{fg highlight}Q@{fg text}" at any time to tell Connexion that you want
to abort the current game.  After the current turn has been taken, you
will be asked for confirmation of this, and pressing "@{fg highlight}Y@{fg text}" will take you
back to the selection screen.  Pressing "@{fg highlight}N@{fg text}" instead will allow the game
to continue from where you left off.

@endnode

@node PLAYERS "The Player"

@{fg shine}Players.@{fg text}

 By clicking on either of the 3 options, @{fg shine}"Human v Human"@{fg text}, @{fg shine}"Human v Computer"@{fg text}
or @{fg shine}"Computer v Computer"@{fg text}, the corresponding game mode is selected - Two
player, One player, or a demo game where the computer plays itself.

@endnode

@node DIMENSIONS "Outside Inside"

@{fg shine}Board size.@{fg text}

 If you want a more challenging game, you can increase the board size
from a measly 3 by 3 (a la "Noughts and Crosses") to a whopping 10 by 10.

 Do this by moving the mouse pointer over either @{fg shine}"WIDTH"@{fg text} or @{fg shine}"HEIGHT"@{fg text} and
clicking the right mouse button to increase, or the left mouse button to
decrease.

@endnode

@node CONNEX "Broken Circles"

@{fg shine}Length of winning line.@{fg text}

 By clicking on the "@{fg shine}+@{fg text}" and "@{fg shine}-@{fg text}" buttons at either end of the number line,
the length of line required to win the game is lengthened or shortened
accordingly.

 Please note, however, that you will only be able to increase this if the
width or height of the board is at least equal to it.  So you can only have
a line length of 8, for example, if the width or height of the grid is set
to 8 or more.  Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to win at all!

@endnode

@node GAMES "Far From Home"

@{fg shine}Increasing the length of a match.@{fg text}

 By clicking on the "@{fg shine}+@{fg text}" and "@{fg shine}-@{fg text}" buttons at either end of the number line,
the number of games required to win a match is increased or decreased
accordingly, so you can have a nice long battle with your friends and
enemies alike.  Including the computer, if you so desire.

 So that's what the playing screen looks like.  In the centre is the
grid in which you play your game of Connexion with the chosen @{"preferences." Link PLAY}

 To the left and right of the grid are two 10-square grids into which
your tokens will grow every time you win a game.  This gives an easy
visual display of the match score.

 Messages in the bar below the playing grid will tell you what the
match score is (at the beginning of each new game) and whose turn it
is to place their token.

 When a square is clicked on by a player (left mouse button), the
token for that player will appear inside that square.  For player one,
a tree will grow and blossom.  For player two, a flower will pop up and
unfold its petals.  @{b}:-)@{ub}

@node FINAL "Just The One"

@{fg shine}We need your feedback!@{fg text}

 If this version of Connexion has kept you busy for a few minutes, please
take a few more to send your comments to Anarchy Software!  Do you have
any suggestions about how the game might be improved? Please let me know
if you have, as your comments are appreciated.

 You can E-mail your comments to...

 @{fg highlight}Anarchy@nebula.demon.co.uk@{fg text}

 And if you haven't got access to the internet, you can write to @{b}Anarchy
Software@{ub} the old-fashioned way at @{"this address." Link ENVELOPE}

@{fg shine}There's more!@{fg text}

 If you want the latest version of Connexion (assuming I do another
one), and you have access to the internet, you can look on the Anarchy 
Software Amiga home page, located at the following address...

 @{fg highlight}http://www.nebula.demon.co.uk/anarchy/@{fg text}

 If I do release another major update, I will probably upload it to the
Aminet, but any minor changes (little bug fixes and tweaks) will only be
uploaded to the above page.  The date and version of each game will be
shown on the home page so that you'll be able to tell if the version
currently available is a later version to the one you have.

 Meanwhile, have fun and enjoy the game :)

@node HISTORY "What's changed?"

@{fg shine}Program history@{fg text}

@{b}Version   Changes@{ub}

@{fg shine}  1.0     o@{fg text} The whole program was changed from not existing to being there.

@{fg shine}  1.1     o@{fg text} Removed some redundant code.

@{fg shine}  1.2     o@{fg text} Small bugfix in the square selection routine, as
            sometimes, it was possible to select a square which wasn't
            empty.  Doh!

@node FUTURE "Mystic Meg?  No, a little more accurate than that... :)"

@{fg shine}Future developments@{fg text}

 Hopefully, I'll continue to improve Connexion, and perhaps make it into
something a little moe special than it is at the moment.  If you have any
ideas for improving this game, please @{" drop me a line " Link FINAL}.

 Current ideas include, in no particular order...

 @{fg shine}o@{fg text} Sound FX - when (and if) I find some decent ones :)

 @{fg shine}o@{fg text} Serial link option (not very likely, but it would be cool :)

 @{fg shine}o@{fg text} Token designer, allowing the user to make their own tokens to use when
   playing.  One possibility would be including an IFF of a grid with the
   game, which the user could modify in a paint package (and animate the
   token like an animbrush to see what it would look like).  The IFF,
   once modified, could be sent back to Anarchy Software via Email, and
   the new token might be included in the next release, with due credit
   to the author, of course.

 @{fg shine}o@{fg text} Background music?  Well, I thought of this one, but decided
   against it, because @{b}a)@{ub} I just cannot write any MODs successfully (this
   has nothing to do with lack of musical ability though, which annoys me)
   and @{b}b)@{ub} I always listen to the radio, or put a CD on when playing,
   which sounds a lot better than most in-game music.  There's a greater
   possibility of liking the music as well, and it's a lot more versatile.
