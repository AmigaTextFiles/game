Introduction
------------
Landmine is based on a game which has been floating around the IBM
(remember those boring single tasking boxes?) world for a while.  I
looked around for something on the Amiga, couldn't find it, and wrote
it.  I hope you like it.

Version 1.0
-----------
This is the very first version of Landmine which I have released as
Shareware.  It was written in the AMOS Proramming Language © Mandarin/Jawx,
and compiled with the AMOS compiler (Thanks Fancois!), so you can run it from
Workbench without other software.

You can register by sending $10 and a disk to the above address, and in return
I'll provide you with support, new releases, and the source code.
When sending money, please send Australian dollars (our banks charge more to
change foreign currency than the cheques are worth in a lot of cases).

Landmine is my first attempt at a released piece of software.  Future
releases and the release of other software depends mainly on the response to
this.  Why AMOS? Simple - I got the game up and running within one week.
I stuffed around in 'C' for a lot longer and got a lot less done.

Playing Landmine
----------------
The object of Landmine is simple.  You are presented with a grid which
measures 15 squares by 10.  At level 1, there are 20 mines buried somewhere
within the grid.  To complete the level, you need to reach the bottom right
corner of the grid.  If you do so without stepping on a mine, you go to the
next level and the number of mines increases.  You score one point for each
square which is cleared, and you get bonus points at the end of each level
(maximum bonus points are awarded for clearing every non-mined square).
To help you reach your objective, the number of mines adjacent to your current
location is displayed.  With some thought, you can usually work out where the
mines are buried.  All movement is carried out using the mouse (unlike the
IBM version which used the arrow keys).

Oh yeah - if you step on a mine, you're dead!

There are much more comprehensive instructions built into the game - when you
fire it up, take a look at the menus.

Other Stuff
-----------
Landmine has the ability to load and save games (the IBM version which I
played didn't) because I found it very annoying to finish the game up when I
had to go and do something else.  Check out the game menus for details.

Known bugs
----------
None (quiet, Andrew...).

Credits
-------
Thanks go to a lot of people, namely: 
        * Andrew Kreibich for hours spent on the title screen
        * My wife (Therese) and son (James) for putting up with me
        * Francois Lionet for creating AMOS, and saving me HEAPS of time
        * Mandarin/Jawx for the tools that are packaged with AMOS
        * Pactronics (the Australian AMOS distributors) for pricing AMOS
          at around $100 (instead of $400).

Special thanks to anyone who registers (I'll name you in the next release).
