WHAT IS THIS THING?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HIT TILES 2 SPECIAL EDITION is a game based on the well-known oriental game
called  Shanghai.   It  consists  of 15 levels, each one featuring a screen
made  up  of 120 tiles placed in piles up to 4 high.  In every screen there
are 4 of each tile.  The aim of the game is to remove all of the tiles from
the  screen.  The main and only rule you have to keep in mind is this:  You
can  only  remove 2 equals tiles at a time ad both must have an empty place
on either the left or the right hand side.
