-------------------------------- IMPORTANT --------------------------------

If "HIT TILES 2 SPECIAL EDITION" (or any other of my products)  is put on a
cd/disk compilation, please inform me or send me a copy of it.

If  some  paper/internet  magazine  rates  my  games,  please inform me for
informations or for the full version of the game.

If  some  shareware  distributor  is  interested  in the distribution of my
products, please contact me.

If  you  find  this  game  or  any other of my products (especially the OLD
versions of "Hit Tiles 2", "Vermone 2" etc.) in some shareware-disk and you
discover  some  bugs, please don't write asking me advices!  Because simply
you  can  find  the  new  versions  on AMINET!  (Even though with big delay
because  I  haven't  an Internet access...  so if some cool italian can put
sometime  my  programs  on  AMINET,  he  will  give  me  a big help and the
registered  version of the game in question...).  The latest versions of my
games are:  "HIT PUZZLE" v1.6, "HIT TILES 2" v1.3 and "VERMONE 2" v1.1 (now
no  more  bugs  into  inserting  the  name  in  the high-score page on some
boards).   So  if  you  don't  find  these  versions  on Aminet, please you
register or must be patient...

Programmers,  I  will  be  happy to swap the registered version of my games
with  your  registered programs (especially with the authors of the various
emulators).
