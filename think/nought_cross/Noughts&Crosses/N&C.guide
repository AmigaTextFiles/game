             Naughts and Crosses was written on an Amiga 2000
             with 4 Megs. of memory.  Programing was done with
             Amos1.36 and then compiled.  It SHOULD run on any
                             Amiga computer.

@node Introduction

An Introduction to Naughts and Crosses.
---------------------------------------

     As from now on, I shall refer to Naughts and Crosses, as n&c.  I'm
 sure just about every one in the world knows the game of n&c, it was one
 of the first games I learned as a kid.  Off course, way back then it was
 played on a piece of paper using just a pencil, (no computers in those
 days).  You would play against a friend or family member.  The first
 thing to do was to draw two vertical parallel lines a character apart,
 then two horizontal lines the same.

    ie:        ___|___|___
               ___|___|___
                  |   |

     One person would use an 'X' and the other a 'O', you would then
 take it in turn to start playing.  The first to get three of their
 characters in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, was
 the winner.

    ie:        _X_|_O_|___
               ___|_X_|_O_
                O |   | X      'X' wins.

     The idea is to block the opponent from getting three in a row.  If
 the game plays out with No winner, it is a Drawn game, (No points).
 It was a good game for a child and as I have said, only needed a piece
 of paper and a pencil.

@node Why

 Why Computerize Naughts and Crosses.
 ------------------------------------

     In this computerized game of n&c the opponent (that is YOU), plays
 the computer.  It is funny, but a lot of people get the impression that a
 computer is very smart, very clever how they beat you at games, (as with
 the game of Chess), and how fast they are.  As any computer programer
 will tell you,  they are ONLY fast, and have no more intelligence, no
 more cleverness than the writer of the program can give it.

     How do you write into a program the intelligence and knowledge of a
 human being.  How do you make your computer as shrewd, as cunning and as
 ruthless as homo sapiens, (sounds dramatic dosn't it).  Answer, damned if
 I know!  I was programing a game called 'Draughts', my first try at a
 game against a computer, (a game much more simple than Chess, but it uses
 the same board), and I was getting nowhere.  I decided to try something 
 simpler still, hence I wrote n&c.

     Much easier, and I now have a good logical base to work from.  I
 could have made n&c even harder to win, but the game is really for
 pre teenagers, so have left it at that.  Much more could have been put
 into the game but, I was really only looking for a pattern to be used
 for this so called 'artificial intelligence'.

     The title packed picture is designed for a 320x200, 32 colour
 Lores screen.  This will allow the program to run on both, NTSC and
 PAL mode formats.

     I am now back re-working 'Draughts', and it should be finished soon.

 How To Play The Game.
 ---------------------

    Amiga has a few words to say, so please have your volume at hearing
 level.  Who Starts play is purely Random, the more games played the
 closer to an even percentage you will get.  You are always 'X', just
 wait your turn and then Click on the square you wish to take.  It is
 very simple, after a while you will learn to hold, (computer first move)
 to a Drawn Game, then (you first move), to win all the time.

    Needless to say, for another game just Click Mouse Button on
 'New Game', or 'Quit' if you wish finish playing.

    As I have already said, it's a simple game, nothing flashy, but it
 should keep the young one's amused for a while.
