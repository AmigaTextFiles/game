    version 0.2.1
    -------------

                  'configure', README and co. out of src/
    
    15th Sep 2005 Changes to graphics due to the upcoming release,
                  also replaced the sound effect with some new ones
		  (quick and dirty.)

    12th Sep 2005 Updated inst.	Updated the documentation, added a manpage.
                  FIX: add -lm link flag: math lib used by
		  bg.c, needed on non-GNU systems.

    11th Sep 2005 Revised installation procedure: replaced
                  mkinstalldirs (a public domain script) by
		  a more clever "inst".

    25th Aug 2005 Registered the game as a SourceForge project

    23rd Aug 2005 Added a simple configure script to detect
                  Cygwin automatically (detects executable suffix
		  and whether it's necessary to use -lwinmm)
		  
		  Idea to rename the game to HotBlock

    22nd Aug 2005 Started adding 16bit directcolor support
                  to avoid palette management during graphics
