                    Block Rage 0.2.1 - KNOWN PROBLEMS
                    =================================

(windows problems are possibly caused by SDL misbehavior)
* windows: when you toggle fullscreen or doublesize with ALT+Enter/Backslash,
    ALT gets stuck and you must press and release it again
    (otherwise instead of Enter - select in menu you get ALT+Enter)

* windows: switching from fullscreen to windowed mode doesn't work
    for some unknown reason under WinXP the window does not appear
    in this case

* windows: the audio skew is BIG

* might not run properly on Solaris
	- most probably swapped colors due to endianness

* the directcolor screenshot writing is a mess

* security
	- no protection for shared topscore table yet

* highscores
	- there is only one topten table for all difficulties/starting levels,
	  thus on multiuser systems with shared table this might be unfair

* background speed
	- currently, speeds of some bagrounds are machine-speed dependent

* configuration
	- the fullscreen and doublesize settings are not
	  accessible from the menu
