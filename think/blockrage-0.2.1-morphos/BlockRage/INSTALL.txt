                 Block Rage - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
	         ======================================


COMPILING UNDER UNIX or GNU/Linux
---------------------------------

  To compile and run the game under a UNIX or GNU/Linux system
  you need:
  
    libSDL 1.2.x (just the core library)

  and the usual: gcc, make.
  Go to the blockrage-<version>/ directory and type:
  
    ./configure
    make
  
  This will hopefully compile the game. You can try it out by typing:
  
    ./blockrage
    
  which should run the game.


COMPILING UNDER WIN32
---------------------

  To compile the game for Win32 you will need a working Cygwin
  environment with gcc, make. You will also need to download (manually)
  a source distribution of libSDL, compile and install it.
  
  In your Cygwin bash shell go to the blockrage-<version>/ directory
  and type
  
    ./configure
    make

  If successful, the file blockrage.exe will be created. Try it:
  
    ./blockrage.exe
    
  should run the game. To run the game from outside the Cygwin
  bash shell you need to find a SDL.dll somewhere and copy
  it to the same directory where blockrage.exe resides.


INSTALLING INTO THE LIVE UNIX FILE SYSTEM
-----------------------------------------

  Once the game is compiled you can install it into the live filesystem
  by typing:
  
    make install
    
  The default prefix is /usr/local and so the following files
  will be installed:

    /usr/local/games/blockrage			executable
    /etc/games/blockrage/blockrage.rc		RC file
    /etc/games/blockrage/blockrage.cfg		system-wide config file
    /usr/local/man/man6/blockrage.6		man page
    /usr/local/share/blockrage/*		data files

UNINSTALLING FROM THE LIVE UNIX FILESYSTEM
------------------------------------------
  Just go to the blockrage-<version>/ directory and type:

    make uninstall
