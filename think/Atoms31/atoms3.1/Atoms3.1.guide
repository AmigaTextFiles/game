 INTRODUCTION

     Atoms is a nice game where luck and ability are needed to win.

     This is the newest version of my most famous game: "Atoms"; I said
"my", but actually it isn't totally true since the idea is copied from a
similar game by Hewlett for ST.

     I hope to have improved that one and made a better game, also thanking
to the great power of Amiga!!: enjoy yourself playing it!

   - Amiga with a mouse.

   - intelligence (at least to win!!)





                ** WINNERS DON'T USE DRUGS, BUT URANIUM!! **

 PLAYING

    When you start Atoms3.1, you can see the Preferences screen: you can
select the four player among:
   1- Human: you are the player and you put atoms with the mouse pointer.
   2- None: The player is out.
   3- Computer Easy: The computer will play in an easy way.
   4- Computer Hard: It's a more difficult level!! You can also select if
you want the music during the game or not and if you want to see the
electrons moving aroud the atoms.
    Every time the preferences are saved in s: directory (if available), so
you will not have to re-enter them every time you play Atoms3.1 (I hope
often!!).


    Then click start and you're on the board game!

     It is very easy to play: each player puts in the table an atom and
adding them in the same place it will explodes. In the corners they explode
when they are just 2, on the sides when they are 3 and elsewhere when 4. You
can start a non-stop reaction and so win.... Don't worry if it seems you're
losing: a player can win even with just an atom!!

     Press "m" to switch the music on/off.
     Press "e" to stop/restart the moviment of electrons.
     Press Esc to quit the game.

     A tip? Don't put your atoms to close one another because you could lose
them all together, and use diagonals as much as possible.

 ABOUT AI:

Atoms is a quite complex game, even if it seems to be easy to play.

Making good AI routines wasn't easy, also because they had to be not too
slow. It could sound incredible, but the Easy level can also win the Hard
one when playing one against the other and this is because luck can help
it!

I played quite a lot of time during the beta-tests and I can say the
computer players aren't so bad, even if they can be won. So, start playing
and look who's the best around!
