The object of the game is to move all the face-up
cards at the top into a row along the bottom by
clicking on pairs.  When you can no longer find a
pair in the top section, you click on the face-down
'deck' at the lower left to turn a card.  When the
deck is all gone, click one more time there to start
a new game.  There are menu items to check out, too.
