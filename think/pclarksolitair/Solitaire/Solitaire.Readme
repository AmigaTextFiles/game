Solitaire

This is 'regular' solitaire.  On the main part, you
build down alternating colors, moving cards or piles
of cards among the columns.  If you develop an empty
column, it can only be filled with a King.  The Aces
go into the upper left corner, and then you build up
in the same suit.  When you click on the deck, the
next 3 cards are shown, or the deck is turned over.
