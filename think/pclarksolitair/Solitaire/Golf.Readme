Golf

The object of the game is to move all the face-up
cards at the top into a row along the bottom by
clicking on cards which are in sequence regardless
of suit or direction.  The Ace is not in sequence
with the King.  No card may be played on a King.  If
you run out of plays, click on the 'deck.'  When the
deck is gone, click once more for a new game.
