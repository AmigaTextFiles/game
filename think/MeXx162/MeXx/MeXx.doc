my fastest in AMOSPRO written game, it tooks only 2 days for the mainpart
and 2 days for the optionsmenu.

Install:

First copy the included amospro.library (>v2.0) to LIBS:
Then copy the fonts flow_fix_ffm.font and the flow_fixx_ffm dir
to FONTS:

You need to copy the memory.prefs into the Dir where you will place
the Game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gameplay:

You can reache the Options menu by pressing the F1 key everytime
during the game. More details later.

The rules are easy to explain: You have some gamecards at the table
which are closed. Every card is present two times. and you must find
the other one. You can open one card and try to find the other one. 
If you fail the next player can try his luck and so on...

The actuell player can be seen at his name in the status line at the bottom.
At the right you can see his points.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By pressing the F1 key you are enter in the optionsmenu where you can change
the settings.

In the first field every player can enter the players name. 8 players are 
possible. The lenght of the names are limited to 40 charakters. With the
Buttons 1-8 you can jump throw the names.

If you want to player against the computer you need just to typ in a name
starting with Amiga, e.g. "Amiga Computer" or "Amiga 1" etc.

The next field is the path for your cardset. You must enter with
the name of the base-card name, e.g. mexx/citrone/citrone !

In the field Frames you can define how many cards you want to play with. The
Value must be a Square value (4,16,36). More then 36 cards is not possible 
and some cardset has only 16 pictures and should set to 16 (the cardset Citrone
has only 16 pictures!).

The Button Preview is to switch on/off a delay after sorting all cards to close.
You have 10 sec. to see all cards bevor they is closing.

The Slider Players is set the numbers of players.

The ComputerIQ will set the IQ of the computer enemy, of course this has only
a affect if you have a Computer Enemy. The best Values are between 20%-50%,
more is only for really crazy guys. :-)

After pressing Okay it will be write down in 'memory.prefs'. If this is not
possible (because write protect) you get a message and can play with your 
settings.

If you eant toend the game just press Control+C

Enjoy this amazing game.
