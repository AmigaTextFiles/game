HOW TO PLAY
›0;31;40m
   Start TTT by clicking its icon, or from CLI type `RUN TTT'.  

   TTT is played on a cube with four levels.  Each level has 16 squares
   arranged as 4 by 4.  The cube is displayed in perspective.  The object
   of the game is to get four marks in a row before the computer does.
   Winning marks may be in ANY straight line, e.g., left-to-right,
   up-and-down, front-to-back, diagonally across a level or diagonally
   across the cube.

   To move, point to a square and click the left mouse button.
   Your move will be marked in blue.  The computer will respond by flashing
   its move in white.  You and the computer alternate moves until someone
   wins.  The computer will highlight the winning row.  You may then start
   a new game or quit.

   TTT has three menus:

	Actions
	    New Game       N
	    Computer Move  C
	    Quit	   Q

	Instructions
	    "How to Play"

   TTT was compiled with SAS/C v6.51.  It has been tested with Enforcer
   and Mungwall on Release 2.1.  It should work with any release, 1.0
   and later, on any Amiga.
   
   TTT may be installed in any drawer by dragging its icon there.  It
   requires no third-party libraries, etc.
