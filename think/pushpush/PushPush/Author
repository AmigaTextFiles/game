N.B.: The Music used for the game is created by Davide Filidei.
      If you change it, you may replace the file
      'pushpush/musiche/level001.sp' with another music with
      some name without ".sp" ('pushpush/musiche/level001').
      The music must by realized with Octamed and the first 3 voices.
      The string ".sp" is used if the file is crunched with
      'the slow spremi cruncher' by Luigi Recanatese.
