@node "Background" "What`s Reversi?           "
@{b}WHERE IT CAME FROM..@{ub}

Reversi was first published in 1880 in England.  The game is also known as Othello.  Here in Germany it's published by the famous company Ravensburger.

@{b}THE RULES@{ub}

The board size is 8x8 squares.  The game is played with 2-coloured stones, normally black on one side, white on the other.  Before the first move, the squares D5 and E4 are occupied by the stones of the first player; the second player's stones are on D4 and E5.  In this game, player 1 always starts; however, you can, of course, choose who player 1 is.
Now, the players by turn place a stone in a free square.  If two of, say, the white player's stones are placed at each end of the opponent's row (which may be horizontal, vertical or diagonal), all the black stones between them are turned over, and thus, from that moment on, belong to the white player (this works the other way 'round, too:).  At least one row of stones has to be turned over if possible.  If you can't move for some reason - bad luck.
The aim of the game is (you guess it) to have the most stones on the board in the end.  This happens when
  - all squares are occupied.
  - it's not possible to turn one or more of the opponent's stones.
  - only stones of one colour are left.

If you want to tease me, send a disk with a saved game after you defeated the computer.  But forget it, you won't be able to do it. :)

As far as I know, there are three @{"variations" link "Rows_per_Move" 0} of the game, in which, on any given turn:

1) You can only turn one row per move, even if there are more possibilities.
2) You can turn as many rows as you like ­ of course, at least one.
3) All possible rows have to be turned.

MUIReversi 1.1 knows all of these.

The @{"size" link "Board_Size" 0} of the board can be adjusted between 4x4 and 16x16.  The bigger the board is, the more time the computer needs to think.  The @{"starting position" link "Game_Start" 0} of the four stones can be either diagonal or parallel.

@node "Author" "About The Author             "
@{b}ABOUT THE AUTHOR@{ub}

I`m a student of computer sciences at the Universität Stuttgart.  In 1989, I got my first Amiga, which I've been programming with C since then.  I like playing strategy games (e.g. Populous, Civilization or The Settlers).  Because I also like board games, I developed a Reversi for the Amiga a few years ago.  The computer opponent wasn't that intelligent, but it was really comfortable and had a nice interface.
When I saw the @{"Magic User Interface" link "MUI"} system 2 years ago, I thought about what I could do with it and remembered my old Reversi.  So I started to rewrite it, although @{"MUI" link "MUI"} isn't intended for games.  Anyway, I wanted to see what is possible.  After nearly a year, MUIReversi was born ­ it's using @{"MUI" link "MUI"} the whole way.  Luckily, I attended a lecture about programming trees in games at the university, and thus, I had a good base for the computer player, which now plays a lot better than in the old version.

Thanks a lot to my little brother @{b}Heiko@{ub}, who created all the nice pictures.  I like them very much; they give the game a personal touch.  

If you have questions, criticism or want to voice appreciation for my work, feel free to contact me.  You're always welcome!

@{b}WHAT`S FREEWARE?@{ub}

This game is freeware.  
First of all, this means that you can copy the archive as many times as you want; however, I, the author, still own the copyrights!  You are not allowed to distribute only parts of this archive, nor sell it for more than about 5 DM (or the same amount in any other currency).  Distribution via Public Domain CDs is restricted under the same terms.  
If you include my game in a public domain collection on floppy disk or CD, please leave me a note.  A free copy of that disk is also warmly accepted.  

In any case, I'm not responsible for any kind of damage, and I cannot guarantee that this program is bug free.  
@endnode

@node "Installation" "Installation               "
@{b}INSTALLATION@{ub}

Installation is easy:  Just copy the complete drawer anywhere you want it.  That's all; however, you'll need at least @{"MUI 3.1" link MUI}.  MUI can be found e.g. on Aminet in misc/libs.
The settings are done by the MUI preferences program as usual.  Some things, like the colour of the stones, are adjustable in MUIReversi.  See @{"configuration" link "Configuration" 0} for more details.

@{b}REMOVING THE WHOLE THING@{ub}

First of all, remove the MUIReversi drawer.  As with all MUI programs, there are also some files left in ENVARC:  

    envarc:MUIReversi.cfg
    envarc:MUI/reversi.?.cfg
    envarc:MUI/reversi.?.cfg.error
    envarc:MUI/reversi.?.wini
    envarc:MUI/reversi.?.wini.error

You'll have to delete these by hand.

@{b}THE ITEMs LOAD and SAVE GAME@{ub}

A game may last very long, so it's possible to save and load a game.  You can also save won or lost games for use with the built-in history.  

MUIReversi uses the AmigaOS' standard ASL file requesters.

@{b}THE MENU CONFIGURATION@{ub}

Since this a @{"MUI" link "MUI"} application, nearly the whole appearance can be adjusted.  See your MUI documentation for more info about this.  Just for your info:  The board uses the background of a group.  

The rest is configurable via the Configuration menu:

       @{"Game Variant..." link "Game Variant" 0}   (Amiga-V)
       @{"Computer...    " link "Computer" 0}   (Amiga-C)

       @{"MUI...         " link "mui:docs/englisch/MUI.guide/main" 0}

The first three items all open the same MUIReversi window and display the appropriate group.  
The last item opens the @{"MUI-Preferences" link "mui:docs/englisch/MUI.guide/main" 0} to alter the local appearance settings of MUIReversi.  If enabled, the small gadget with the MUI logo in the upper right corner of the windows will do the same.  

All settings will be saved in the ENV: and ENVARC: drawers on program exit.

To close the configuration window, press either

@{b}THE VARIANT SETTINGS@{ub}

This Reversi version allows you to adjust several rules of the game:

  @{"the rows per move" link "Rows_per_Move" 0}
  @{"the size of the board" link "Board_Size" 0}
  @{"the start positions" link "Game_Start" 0}

The default configuration is:
  - turn all rows per move
  - size of the board is 8x8
  - start with the stones placed diagonally

To close the configuration window, press either
 @{"     OK      " link "Config_EndButtons" 0}  @{" New Game " link "Config_EndButtons" 0}  @{"   Cancel   " link "Config_EndButtons" 0}

@node "Computer" "Computer Opponent"
@{b}THE COMPUTER OPPONENT SETTINGS@{ub}

No computer game is complete without a good opponent played by the computer.  In this window you can adjust your ultimate nightmare in playing Reversi.  

                 Human - Human
                 Human - Computer
              Computer - Human
              Computer - Computer

You can adjust the computer's intelligence in 3 levels.  Level 1 is the easiest - the time needed to compute the next move is short even on slow machines.  Level 3 is the hardest, and also the most time consuming.  Using huge boards on slow Amigas with this level might cost you your nerves. :)  
The @{"rows per move" link "" 0} setting will also affect the computers speed.  "turn all rows per move" is the fastest, while "turn any rows per move" will again let your computer brood for a while; however, this is also the most interesting version, since you have a maximum of freedom in your moves.  

To close the configuration window, press either
 @{"     OK      " link "Config_EndButtons" 0}  @{" New Game " link "Config_EndButtons" 0}  @{"   Cancel   " link "Config_EndButtons" 0}

@node "Colors" "Colours"
@{b}THE COLOUR SETTINGS@{ub}

So, you can adjust tons of colours, frames, and more with @{"MUI" link "MUI" 0}.  Why not the stones' colours?  No?  Well, of course you can:

  - colour player 1
  - colour player 2
  - shadow of the stones and the board

There are three `penpopup` gadgets in the lower part of this window.  A click on them will open another window that lets you choose the colour.  You'll know that from the @{"MUI-Preferences-Editor" link "mui:Docs/englisch/MUI.guide/main" 0}....  

To close the configuration window, press either

@node "Rows_per_Move" "Rows Per Move"
@{b}ROWS PER MOVE@{ub}

Depending on where you place your stone, you may have the possibility to turn more than one row in that move.  MUIReversi lets you choose between three different rules for that case.  

@{fg highlight}turn one row per move:@{fg text} The player can only turn one row per move.  Toggle one of the @{"arrow buttons" link "Direction_Buttons"} to indicate the direction the desired row runs.  

@{fg highlight}turn any rows per move:@{fg text} You can turn as many rows as you like; however, you must turn at least one.  Defining which rows you want to turn works in much the same way as above; however, now you can toggle as many buttons as you want.  

@{fg highlight}turn all rows per move:@{fg text} Since you have no choice but to turn all possible rows, you cannot use the arrow buttons here.  They'll just show you which rows will be turned automatically.  

Choose the rule by clicking on one of the buttons in the @{"variants window" link "Game Variant" 0}.  This window is opened via the @{"Configuration" link "Configuration" 0} menu.  

You'll have to start a new game, so you can only leave this window with the @{" New Game " link "Config_EndButtons" 0} button.  
@endnode

@node "Board_Size" "Board Size"
@{b}BOARD SIZE@{ub}

The original board consists of 8x8 squares.  
...but why shouldn't we try other sizes as well?  That's why you can adjust the size between 4x4 and 16x16 squares.  Notice that the board itself is always a square.  That's why there's only one button to change it in the variants window.  This window is opened via the @{"Configuration" link "Configuration" 0} menu.

You'll have to start a new game, so you can only leave this window with the @{" New Game " link "Config_EndButtons" 0} button.
@endnode

@node "Game_Start" "Start Position"
@{b}START POSITION@{ub}

In the original game, the stones are placed diagonally in the center of the board.
MUIReversi lets you also place the stones parallel.  You can choose between these variants in the @{"variants window" link "Game Variant" 0}.  This window is opened via the @{"Configuration" link "Configuration" 0} menu.

You'll have to start a new game, so you can only leave this window with the @{" New Game " link "Config_EndButtons" 0} button.

There are three ways to leave the configuration window:

@{fg highlight}OK:@{fg text} The new configuration is saved in ENV: and ENVARC:.  In some case, e.g. after changing the board size, you'll have to start a new game, and thus, this button might be deactivated.  

@{fg highlight}New Game:@{fg text} The new configuration is saved and a new game is started.

    @{"Possible Moves" link "PossibleMoves" 0}   (Amiga-Z)
    @{"Protocol      " link "Protocol" 0}   (Amiga-P)

Both items act like a switch that enables or disables the function.  The 'on' postion is marked by a checkmark.  
@endnode

@node "PossibleMoves" "Possible Moves"
@{b}THE ITEM POSSIBLE MOVES@{ub}

For all those who don't know the game, it might be handy to let MUIReversi display the possible moves.  You can enable or disable this with this item.  If enabled, all turnable rows are displayed with a small arrow.  Looks nice, try it!  
@endnode

@node "Protocol" "Protocol"
@{b}THE ITEM PROTOCOL@{ub}

The protocol is written in a separate window.  The table contains two rows per line:  yours, and your opponent's.  Only the starting position of the stone is displayed, and turned rows are not shown.  Sorry for that!  

The squares are named like in a chess game:  The upper left corner is A1, and the lower right would be D4, on a 4x4 board.  

This window is not only an information source; you can also 'undo' your moves (cheating is the correct word:) by clicking on one of the lines, or you can move backward and forward in a game.  The selected line becomes white, and the stones' postions are shown on the board.  
Remember, if you jump back in a game and restart from that position, all recorded moves after that move are removed.  Move on....

@endnode

@node "CurrentPlayer" "current player"
@{b}THE CURRENT PLAYER@{ub}

A frame of stones shows the colour of the player whose turn it is.  In this frame, a picture of the player or the computer is displayed.  

If your system doesn't know about datatypes (included in AmigaOS 3.0), you won't see any pictures; however, this won't limit the game in any way.  
@endnode

@node "Player_Status" "Player's Status"
@{b}PLAYER`S STATUS@{ub}

This small box has several functions:
If it's a human player's turn, it displays the appropriate information.  
If it's the computer's turn, it displays the status of the machines' mindwork.  You can interrupt this by clicking in the display.  Another click restarts his thinking.  
@endnode

@node "Take_Back_Move" "Take Back A Move"
@{b}TAKE BACK A MOVE@{ub}

There are two buttons in the main window that let you move forward (right) and backward (left) in the game.
This way, you can undo a move or just look at what's happened in the past moves.

See also: @{"protocol window" link "Protocol" 0}.
@endnode

@node "Direction_Buttons" "Arrow Buttons"
@{b}THE ARROW BUTTONS@{ub}

You choose the row(s) you want to turn by pressing one or more of the arrow buttons.  They point in the same directions as the rows that originate from the stone you placed on the board in this move.

@{fg shine}turn one row per move:@{fg text} You can toggle only one button.  If another one is already pressed, it will be released automatically.

@{fg shine}turn any rows per move:@{fg text} You can toggle all buttons independently on and off.

@{fg shine}turn all rows per move:@{fg text} All buttons are disabled.  They just display the direction(s) of the row(s) that will be turned automatically.

If the cat has stolen your mouse, you can also use the keys 1 through 9 (except 5) on the numeric pad of your keyboard.

@endnode

@node "Execute" "Execute"
@{b}THE EXECUTE BUTTON@{ub}

Since you can select which rows you want to turn, a move cannot be executed automatically.  That's why there's an Execute button.

You can also use the RETURN key of your keyboard ­ or even faster, double click on the board on one of the @{"arrow buttons" link "Direction_Buttons"}.  

@endnode

@node "Game_Board" "Board"
@{b}THE BOARD@{ub}

The board is located in the right half of the main window; you won't miss it.
Each row and column is labeled, which gives each square a unique name.  You'll know that from other board games.  

You select the square in which you want to put your stone with the mouse.  A small black arrow will then point to it.  

After you've placed your stone, you can ­ depending on the selected rule ­ select which rows have to be turned with the @{"arrow buttons" link "Direction_Buttons" 0}.  The rows that are about to be turned are marked with a hatching in the user's colour.  

To execute the move, you'll have to press the @{"Execute button" link "Execute" 0}, or double click on the starting square, or one of the @{"arrow buttons" link "Direction_Buttons" 0}.  

The stones will automatically adjust their size, depending on the size of the board.  
@endnode

@node "Commodity-Interface" "Commodity Interface"
@{b}THE COMMODITY INTERFACE@{ub}

As with any other MUI application, you can enable a commodity interface for MUIReversi.  
The supported functions are:

@{fg shine}show:@{fg text} If MUIReversi is iconified, all windows will reopen.  

@{fg shine}hide:@{fg text} All windows are closed, and an icon will appear on the workbench.  The program is now iconified and its windows can be reopened by double clicking on the icon, or using the 'show' button in Exchange.  

@{fg shine}remove:@{fg text} MUIReversi exits.  

The functions active/inactive are not supported.  
@endnode

@node "AREXX Port" "ARexx-Port"
@{b}THE AREXX-PORT@{ub}

As with any other MUI application, an ARexx port can be activated for MUIReversi.  
The port is labeled Reversi.n (e.g. Reversi.1, Reversi.2 etc.).  Since there's not much use for an ARexx port in this game, it only supports the standard MUI commands.  See your @{"MUI documentation" link "mui:docs/English/MUI.guide/main" 0} for more info on this.  
@endnode

@node "Internal_Multitasking" "Internal Multitasking"
@{b}THE INTERNAL MULTITASKING@{ub}

Although the Amiga is a multitasking machine from the first day on, it's still not usual to use more than one task in an application.  
For MUIReversi, I thought it would be nice if you could still talk to the game while the computer is thinking about the next move.  Therefore, the computer opponents always have their own task.  

Benefits:

  - the window refresh (eg after resizing one of the windows) works any time
  - you can use the computer for both players
  - you can look at the protocol anytime
  - changing the configuration is possible any time

Let the computer play against the computer and iconify the program.  The computer will continue playing!

@{b}LOCALES@{ub}

Like every good Amiga application, MUIReversi uses the locale.library, and thus supports several languages; currently included are German and English.  

There's an empty catalog translation file in 'catalogs/empty.ct'.  Use it if you want to translate MUIReversi to your own language.  The file was built by CatComp, and together with catalogs/default.cd you'll be able to create your own catalog.
If you have created a new catalog, drop @{"me" link "Author" 0} a note; I'll include it in the next release.

Many thanks to Piergiorgio Ghezzo, who sent me a Italian catalog, too. I'm sorry, but I included the one from the ATO :-(

Also many thanks for the bug reports that were sent by some of the above-mentioned translators.

I used the following programs for the development of the game:

   - MUI by Stefan Stuntz
   - GoldEd by Dietmar Eilert
