Description:
-----------
 This is a small "Tile-Flipping" game where the objective is to change
 a board of tiles into the same number/colour with as few moves possible.

Usage:
-----
 The trick is that you are flipping/rotating all the present tiles within
 the shape of a cross or plus-sign (A flippable tile must be loacated at the
 center). You can set the range of the tiles/numbers from 2-5, Left mouse
 button will rotate the numbers up and right mouse button...down! (Surprise)

 The board is always solvable with "1"'s as it's shuffled from such a setup,
 I haven't bother to explore the mathematics of this but i'm quite sure that
 a board can be solved with ANY of the available numbers/colours.

 Mouse - Move cursor on board
   LMB - Rotate up
   RMB - Rotate Down

Settings:
--------
   Size - Size of board 1-6, Higher = Harder
  Range - Span of the numbers/colours 1-4, Higher = Harder
 Blocks - Amount of random non-flippable blocks 0-4, Higher = Easier

Display:
-------
 Level - This is an approximation of the difficulty level
  Time - Time spent on the current game
 Moves - Number of moves used on the current game
 Score - Your score, a multiple of "Level" reduced by "Time" and "Moves"

 You might wonder why there is no high-score system? With purely random
 levels and a sometimes inaccurate difficlutly rating it makes little
 sense to compare games. However with the "Restart" option you can play
 the same level any number of times and compete with yourself or a friend.

Background:
----------
 I came up with this idea myself and pondered for a few months if it
 could work as a game. And a week in May 2001 i sat down and wrote it
 (Still working on BabeAnoid right now). But i guessed that this idea
 must have been made into a game before?...Well, i looked around and
 found one or two very old games on Aminet that came close, but of course
 this game is much better and polished (It's not brag when you're right ;))

Feedback:
-------
Feel free to send me a mail and give me your thoughts...there aren't many
Amigans left out there, and if no-one bothers to show their appreciation
i have no reason to continue making free Amiga games.

This game was written very fast and has gone through very little testing
and evaluation...so please send any bug-reports or ideas to me.

Future: Possible improvements
------
* Number coded levels
* Highscore system
* Random background pattern (The shadows rendered at every new game so...)

Also check out my other Aminet releases:...

* game/think/DawnVideoPoker.lha - DawnVideoPoker2.0, The world's greatest
  videopoker game! (Well, you have to play it to prove me wrong ;))

* game/actio/spaceball2000.lha - A futuristic sport game, a cross between
  pong/tennis/speedball. 1 or 2 players.

* game/think/SeaHaven2000.lha - Semi-finished but fully playable solitare
  game with features taken from the SGI version.

* game/actio/Fnurr2000.lha - Make your pixel avoid other homing pixels and
  trick them to crash and explode. A demonstration that a simple game
  with only 26 pixels can actually be funny!

development of my game BabeAnoid.
