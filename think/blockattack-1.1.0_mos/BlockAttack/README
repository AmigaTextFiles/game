Thanks for downloading Block Attack - Rise Of the Blocks 1.1.0 for Linux

The game is precompiled in the Game folder. You have to launch it from a console, I don't know how to fix that :-( You have to be in the Game folder then launching it. By typing "./blockattack" in the Game folder.

The game is compiled under Mandrivia Linux Limited Edition 2005, there are known problems on some distros. If you have a problem delete "Game/blockattack"

To compile the game, you must be in folder with the "block.make" file and run "make -f block.make" this will recompile the parts of the program that you made changes to or the whole program if "Game/blockattack" was deleted
