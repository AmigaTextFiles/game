-----

general:
- drop-in Zip file support (for level and artwork packages)
- internationalization / localization support (local language catalogs)
- support for different (higher) screen resolutions / resizable window
- local multiplayer mode with auto-player-focus
- support for playing network games for the SDL version (Windows, Mac OS X)
- graphical user interface for playing network games

game engine:
- more game elements like transporters
- change BD style amoeba behaviour from "only in BD-elements-only level"
  to configurable in the level editor (-> "player blocks amoeba or not")

other:
- makefile target for installing the game
- updated version of the man page
- decent documentation in HTML
- more levels (that's the point where *you* can help out! :-) )
