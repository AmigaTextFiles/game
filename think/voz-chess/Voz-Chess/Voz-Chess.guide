	Voz-Chess is a simple Chess based puzzle game. 
	   
	
	It runs from the Workbench on all Amigas, and
automatically adapts to Workbench 1.3 or 2.0+ colour schemes.  It
is multitasking-friendly and uses no system time when waiting for
input.

    Several White pieces have been secretly placed on a
chessboard, but hidden from you.  You can click with the mouse on
any square, and you will be told how many pieces are attacking
that square.  Your objective is to guess their positions in the
minimum number of clicks.   You have three free guesses, after
that each guess costs ten points.  To make a guess, place the
pieces from the box onto the board and click the "Guess!" gadget. 
You must place all pieces on the board to make a guess. 


    A large number of options are available from the menu.  But
start with the default "Easy" mode.  In this mode, you will be
shown which five squares the pieces are on, so all you have to 
do is decide which is which.


    To pick up a piece just click the left mouse button on it.
If you then click on another piece they will be swapped.  If you
click on the "box" where the pieces start, they will be returned
to it.  You can move them freely anywhere, but when you press 
"Guess!" they must be right.

              ---------------------------------


    All the following options are selected from the menu.
             

    The Standard game, in which you are not told where the five
pieces are, is very hard.  If you select "One Type", however,
all the pieces will be the same sort, which makes matters a bit
easier.


     You may prefer a "Custom Game".  Set up the custom rules on
the menu, then select this option.  You can choose board size,
and how many pieces are active.  E.G. you could have just King,
Knight and Bishop on a 6x6 board, which is a good choice for a
relatively easy puzzle (in fact this is the default).


     If you select "One Type" here in the Custom menu, the number
of pieces depends on how many are active.  "Easy" here is the
same as for standard games, but of course it is disabled when
there is only one type of piece.  All the options in the Custom
menu only work when "Custom" is selected in the "Game_Rules"
menu.  Your most recent set of custom rules is saved when you
quit, as long as your disk is write-enabled.


     Your score for each game is the number of squares you have
clicked on, plus ten for any guesses after the third.  If you
give up, 99 points are scored.  The current score is shown in a
box beside the board.  When each game is finished, an ongoing
rating is calculated, a bit like a chess rating - every result
brings it up or down slightly.


     You have a separate rating for each style of play i.e.
Standard, Easy, Custom, and five One-Piece games.  The rating for 
Custom is reset if you play a game with different custom rules.
These ratings are saved, along with the current custom rules,
every time you quit (so long as your disk is write-enabled).  If
you delete the file "voz-ratings", all current ratings will be
forgotten, and the custom rules will revert to the default (6x6
board, with King, Knight and Bishop).

    About     -  Message

    Give Up   -  Show solution.  You score 99 (the worst)

    New Game  -  Set up a new board

    Quit      -  Quit game and save scores (if write-enabled)
     
         
    Confirm Hits -  Tells you how many pieces are exactly correct
when you guess.  This is the default mode.  You can turn it off
if you want but there is no score bonus for doing so.  Messages
are shown in the window title bar.


    Spread Out - Spreads the pieces around a bit more evenly e.g.
on an 8x8 board there will be at least two squares between any
two pieces, and on 6x6 and 7x7 boards, at least one square.  No
effect on smaller boards.


  The game window can be dragged around or sent behind others.
Click on it to re-activate.  Unless you have two computers, you
probably won't notice, but Voz-Chess will adapt itself to WB1.3
or WB2+ colour schemes.

    Voz-Chess should be kept in its own drawer, and then it can
easily be copied, just by dragging the drawer to wherever you want
it.  The following files should always be present:

Voz-Chess            -  the game itself  
Voz-Chess.guide      -  this document
voz-graphics.iff     -  the graphics
                           
Voz-Chess.info, Voz-Chess.guide.info  -  the icon files

    The file "voz-rating" may or may not be present.  It saves
scores and custom setups, but can be deleted at will - custom
setup will then revert to the default.

    You can edit the graphics if you like, just load them into a
paint program, then save them out as a four-colour brush, the
same size as before.  Don't change the colours.  Note that altered
versions may be distributed, but not in the same directory as the 
standard program.
   

    If Voz-Chess fails to run, check that (i) all files are
present; (ii) your LIBS: directory has the usual libraries;
(iii) Workbench is hi-res with at least four colours; (iv) you
have 75K or so of RAM to spare.

    To play Voz-Chess, here is all you need to know:


    Chess pieces attack various squares around them, but do not
attack  their own squares.  The King and Knight always attack
certain nearby squares.  The others attack along lines or
diagonals.  If the line is blocked by another piece, that piece's
square is attacked, but no squares beyond it - otherwise all
squares right across the board are attacked.


     King: Attacks the eight squares adjacent to it.

     Knight: Attacks the eight squares that are exactly a
knight-jump away... which means two squares away along one row or
column, and then one square on either side.  For example, in a 3
x 2 rectangle, the opposite corners are a knight-jump away from
each other.

     Rook: Attacks every square along rows and columns, unless
blocked by another piece.

     Bishop: Attacks every square  along each diagonal, unless
blocked by another piece.

     Queen: This megapiece combines the moves of Rook and Bishop.
Attacks in eight directions, unless blocked by another piece.

   Voz-Chess was written entirely in Blitz Basic 2.  Graphics
were drawn in DPaintIV.  Crunched with Imploder V3.1.


   The game concept is derived from Martin Gardner's "Puzzles
from Other Worlds" (Oxford Paperbacks).  In "Chess by Ray and
Smull" the eponymous astronauts instruct their ship's computer
VOZ to generate puzzles of this type, and some examples are given
for the reader.  The original idea was conceived by one Jaime
Poniachik of Buenos Aires.


   A VOZ emulator seemed an obvious theme for a computer game.
Of course it should have been called "MYUSM-Chess" but that was
just too hard to pronounce.  It would have been nice to have a
program which generated exactly enough attack-numbers to solve
the position, but alas I could find no way to implement this.


   V1.0 had a small bug which prevented proper operation in 
"Easy" mode on WB1.3 machines.  (Actually the program was 
perfect but the graphics file was bugged!)

   Now that I have a multiscan monitor, I plan to do a
super-cool DblPal version sometime, maybe with some extra
options - and possibly a PC version. Meanwhile you will
have to put up with this...

   If you like this little game, you may be interested in some
others I have done:


   "Spelltris" - Tetris variant; letters fall down and you 
have to make words.  1 Mb needed, 1.5 Mb preferable.  This
game appeared on a coverdisk of Amiga User International (on or
about September '95). 

   "Holomaze" - 3D Maze where a six-pronged object must move
in a hollow box, in which tracks are cut in the six faces.  Full
design, edit, and autosolve capability.

   "Imperator" - The classic(?) Conquest game, somewhat enhanced.

   "Attack of the Smileys" - Dalek variant.
