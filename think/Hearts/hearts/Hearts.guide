@node intro "Introduction"
How did all begin?

In autumn 1996 I had my first contact with hearts. The game was Microsoft Hearts (network version) and I was excited: finally a card game which to play you also need brains, not only good luck. Then I visited Aminet hoping to find one for Amiga, but unfortunately I could not see a sign of a hearts game. I had only one choice: to code one myself.

Now after various hours, days and months spent making this game, you can enjoy the result. A piece of software for Amiga that looks good and plays well, but a word of warning before you start playing (I hope I am not late): PLEASE, BEWARE, THIS GAME CAN CAUSE SEVERE ADDICTION (trust me,I know it).

This game program was written 100% in C using Blizzard-IV 030/50 boosted A1200 with 10MB memory and 250MB hard drive. The code was generated using GoldED, GNU C-compiler and Native Developer's Kit. Graphics were created using Personal Paint 6.4 and AGAIFF. A massive thank you to the creators of these wonderful tools.

@node system "System requirements"
OS              V36 (v2.0) or greater
External libs   asl.library (any version) and mathieeedoubbas.library (V37)
Memory          .5MB Chip + .5MB should be enough
Disk space      ~200KB
CPU             680x0
Chip set        OCS or better
Display         Monitor, or if you are using tv, SCART-cable recommended. Signal through tv-modulator may not be good enough so that you could identify cards and read the small letters.

Tested on:
A1200/020       2MB         DD  OS3.0 (basic configuraton)
A1200/030/50    10MB(2+8)   HD  OS3.0 (Blizzard-IV boosted)

This game is not tested on other configurations, sorry. I have not had a chance. However, it should work from unexpanded A600 to 060 boosted A4000 without any problems, because it is totally (100%) system friendly. Anyway, I would be grateful if you could send @{"me" link contact} information about your configuration and tell whether it worked or not.

@node install "Installation"
Installation of Deep Red Hearts could not be easier: just simply unpack Hearts.lha-archive or copy Hearts-directory and its @{"contents" link copyright} to your desired place. No assigns are needed, just make sure you have asl.library and mathieeedoubbas.library in your LIBS: directory.

@node rules "Game idea & rules"
trick = 4 cards
round = 13 tricks
game = 4-16 rounds
a point card = a heart (1 p.) or the queen of spades (13 p.)

Changing cards

In the beginning of a round you must change three cards. It is good idea to give away big cards or to get rid of a suit.
Note that every 4th round you cannot change cards.

Starting a round

The player who has two of clubs will start.
On the first trick you cannot use point cards, unless you have no choice.

Playing

You must follow suit if possible. The player who takes the trick will get possible minus points and start the next trick. Each heart gives one point and the Queen of spades 13. It is okay to take other cards, bacause they give no minus points.
You can also try to collect all the point cards. Then you get no points, but all the other players will get 26 minus points. Fun but risky.
Note that you cannot start the trick with a heart, if hearts have not been opened(=have not been used before). Of course, if you do not have any other other cards, you must use hearts.

Winner

The game will end when one of the players has reached 100 points. This will take four to 16 rounds. The winner is the player, who has collected least points.

@node control "Game control"
Players

Before you can play you must create a player for you. Open setup-window and type your name (one to 10 characters) and an optional code word (maximum of 4 characters). Changing the code word afterwords is not possible, but you can easily rename your player or delete it using standard DOS-commands. Players are stored in Players-directory (logical, eh).

Points

If you want to know who is leading or who won (highlighted) you should open points window. You can switch between two modes: points collected per round or total points by the end of every round.

Statistics

Player information shows your average points during last 100 games and situation in last 15 and last five games compared to the average points.
'+' = average points (last 15/five games) < average points -1
'·' = average points (last 15/five games) = average points +/-1
'-' = average points (last 15/five games) > average points +1
Ranking is players' top 10 in average points (last 100 games).

@node future "History, present, future"
History

Artificial intelligence
v1.00       Basic artificial intelligence

Game
30/6/1997   AI v1.00 and probably almost the final look of the game
2/7/1997    some problems with points fixed (thanks to my little brother)

Present

Do not expect any updates within a year (before autumn 1998), because my military service lasts eight to 11 months. That's why there will be only bug fixes. However, I have not found any bugs, but write to @{"me" link contact} if you find one, please.

Future

Artificial intelligence
Upgrade is under consideration. My goal is to make the world's best hearts game and release it as Deep Red Hearts Pro, which will be shareware program.

Game
Link game would be really cool. (I know it ;-))Unfortunately I have only one machine and no knowledge about networks. If you know something about them, please write to @{"me" link contact}. You can also tell your opinion about the best way to do it (eg. using null cable).
User interface will probably remain the same; I am not planning any big changes. Huge improvements will only be internal.

@node contact "Contact author"
To send me feedback (bug reports, suggestions, postcards, any reasonable feedback is welcome) write to me to:

E-mail address is not available until autumn 1998, because I do not have Internet access at the moment. So please, anyone, upload this game (Hearts.lha or @{"all the files" link copyright}) to Aminet (game/think). Before that you can obtain your copy of Deep Red Hearts from me. Just send me 20 FIM or amount of 35 FIM (~ $7 ~ £4 ~ 12 DEM, no coins, please) if you want to use some other currency (exchanging money is not free).

Bug reports

If you are sending me bug reports remember to describe as precisely as possible what happened and when, what were you doing and what is your computer configuration.

Help me to create link playing option!

To help me create a link play, please send me suggestions about the best way to do it (eg. using null cable). If you have any information about linking computers together or you know where to get it, please, share your knowledge with me.
