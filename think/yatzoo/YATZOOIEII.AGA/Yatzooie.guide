@node intro "Introduction"

*****
Welcome to Yatzooie II...AGA

by Ken Winfield, Oct 1993
Freeware
Written in CanDo tm from Inovatronics

Yatzooie II was written to allow players to have AGA graphics with a five
of kind game that will "Yatzooie"...

@endnode

@node startup "Starting the Game"

Loading the game is very easy, it will run from the workbench icon or
the CLI prompt.


@endnode

@node execution "Playing the Game"

Sound "on" Is the default mode, however to increase game speed there
is a pull down menu that will allow you shut off the sound.

The first thing to do when starting a new game is to 
select "New Game" button. 

To play two players click on the 1 PLYR button this will toggle from 
one player to two players. One player is default.

Now push the roll button at the bottom of the screen. The five dice 
will roll, now click on the dice you wish to pick up and hit roll 
again. Repeat this process 3 times until the message window at the
bottom center of the screen tells you to "select your score.

To select your score click on the score you wish to keep, if you have 
and X beside your score you must choose another score.

When the game is over the total will appear in the total slot with 
subtotals for the top and bottom sections of the board

To play another game select new.

game with their permission.

  if you use it is at your own risk.

  fee is charged.




@endnode

@node stuff "Compatibility"

Amiga 1200 or Amiga 4000 for AGA support..requires fast memory and 
therefore will not run on a unexpanded amiga 1200.

It will run peacefully with any program that multitasks (providing 
you have the memory) makes it great for playing while downloading files
or whatever.

@endnode

@node history "History"

Yeap there was a Yatzooie I, program was written in 1990 and was quite
buggie so except for me and a few friends it never was released. So 
improvements are that this program works. Yatzooie is a "throw the dice"
game like you have seen before but it is fast and supports AGA. 

@endnode


@node future "Future"

Will there be a Yatzooie III, I still don't know. I got the idea for the
game it just a matter of having the time to do the programming.
