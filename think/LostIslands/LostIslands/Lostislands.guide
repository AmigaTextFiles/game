@NODE intro "Introduction"
@{u}
Introduction            
@{uu}
A person known to you as Mr Psycho has trapped you on several islands which all contain time bombs. You are given a set amount of time at the beginning of each island to `escape' from the masses of mazes which are can be found there.

To escape you must find the exit which is a purple block on the ground that changes colour when you step on it. Once you have found this hidden block, press the fire button to proceed to the next level. 

Also included on the islands are switches and/or teleporters.
Switches activate bridges or change to maze slightly, usually
allowing you to complete island. Teleporters are also very useful, as they transport you from one part of the island to the other. To
activate a switch or teleporter, press the fire button whilst standing on them.

@NODE sysre "System Requirements"
@{u}
System Requirements         
@{uu}
To play the Lðst Islands you will require at the following system:

An Amiga with an ECS/AGA chipset.
Two megabytes of memory. Fast RAM is not needed, however it is recommended. Lots of graphics memory is required.
Workbench 2.0 or higher.

It may also be necessary to disable any system enhancing programs such as screen savers, commodities etc., as it may slow down or even crash the game.

@NODE play "Controls"
@{u}
Controls                
@{uu}
To play the Lost Islands, you will require a control pad or joystick, plugged into the Joy port at the back or side of your Amiga. Use the directional controls to move the ENGiNE NiNE man up, down, left or right and the fire button to activate switches, teleporters and to finish the level whilst standing over the exit

Pressing `p' during play will freeze the game, until you press `p' or fire again. Pressing the Escape key will restart the game.

On the option screen use up and down to move to start game, difficulty, audio, starting island or go away. Pressing fire will change their values.

START GAME: This option will, as it says, start the game at the selected level.

DIFFICULTY: Allows you to select between `Ezy Peezy' and `Rock Hard Man'. The harder level will reduce your time, allow you to have more points and increase the level size.

AUDIO: Turns the in game music on or off. Good if you have an ear ache or are low on memory.

STARTING ISLAND: This option allows you to enter a password from previously played levels, and to start the game at that level.

GO AWAY: Will end the lost islands and go back to Workbench or DOS.
