This is just a very small game intending to help beginners to cope up with
assembly language rather than really entertain them. The source is provided,
and is heavily commented. The game was inspired by some I saw on a calculator
(HP 48S),which I found interesting. You will control a tank and make it roll
through a mine field. You must reach the target without stepping on a mine.
The tank can move either up,down,left or right,and on a status line is given
the number of mines around the tank. Try it yourself to have a clear idea.
YAMFG can be started either from CLI or Workbench. Some menues will help
you get some informations,quit the game,change the number of mines and the
width/height of the mine field. Once again,it was mostly designed to help
beginners. I used the reqtools.library © Nico François,which is in the
public domain for the requesters,because they look very nice. Enjoy!
