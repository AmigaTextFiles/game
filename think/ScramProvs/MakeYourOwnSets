To make your own set of proverbs and hints for ScrambledProverbs just
follow these simple rules.

1) Most importantly, there must be exactly 42 proverbs in each set.  This
list of proverbs must then be followed by exactly 42 hints.  If this is not
done the program will abort when it tries to read your custom set.

2) Each proverb and hint must not have any carriage returns in it. If it
does the program will interpret it as being two separate proverbs.

3) Though not required, it is helpful to make sure that no words overlap the
22 character display width.  To make this easier just follow the template
below, adding spaces where necessary so that a word is not split between two
lines of display.

4) The hint for the proverbs must, of course, be in the same order as the
proverbs.

That's all there is to it.

You can use this file as a template by typing in your proverbs and hints
below the dashed line.  The plus signs in the dashed line indicate a 22
character display line.  After typing in your proverbs and hints delete all
of the lines up to and including the dashed line and then save the file.
