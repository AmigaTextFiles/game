@node editor "I will now perform my cabaret number..."

In the map editor, all editing is done on the editor screen, which is the only
screen in RoboEd. This editor screen is laid out as follows:
  The biggest area in the upper right corner is the map window, showing you a
20*20 square area of the whole 40*40 square map. On the right side are the
editor control buttons. Below these are the buttons for scrolling the map
window (the central button centres the window) and the drawing tools.
  On the left side of the screen, below the map window, is the palette of the
different @{"blocks and items" link "blocks"}. Right of these are the buttons for placing a robot
on the map. Note that there are 4 robots on the map in all situations. The
placing buttons just move the robots around the map.
  Read the following nodes for information on how to actually edit a map.
@endnode

@node editing "I presume that's enough 'Allo 'Allo puns."

In this node, I will explain the buttons and drawing tools on the @{"editor screen" link "editor"}.
The control buttons, from top to bottom, are as follows:
    - Load a map. Loads a new RoboQuest map file from disk. If the map file is
password protected, you will be asked for the password. If the password is
wrong, you will not be able to edit, or even see the map.
    - Save this map. Saves the current RoboQuest map to disk. You will be asked
for the map name (to be written into the file) and a password. If you don't want
the map to be password protected, just press Return when asked for a password.
Saving maps is only possible in the @{"registered" link "money"} version.
    - Delete a map. With this button you can delete map files, and other files,
too, from disk. You will be asked for confirmation.
    - View this map. Shows the whole 40*40 map for your benefit. You can scroll
the map up and down with the cursor keys, and return to the editor by pressing
Return.
    - Check robots. Merely checks what the 4 robots are standing on, and alerts
you if they're standing on something they probably shouldn't be standing on.
    - Clear this map. Clears the entire map. Does not affect the robots. You
will be asked for confirmation.
    - Quit the program. Quits the editor, obviously. But why would you want to
do that?

To edit the map, draw on the map window with the six drawing tools. They are as
follows:
    - Dot. Places a single @{"block or item" link "blocks"} on the map. Messages and teleports can
only be added with this tool.
    - Line. Draws a line of blocks or items from one point to another. Click
once to set the source, and then again to set the destination.
    - Hollow square. Draws a hollow square. Click once to set one corner, and
then again to set the opposite corner.
    - Filled square. Like the hollow square, only filled.
    - Circle. Draws a hollow circle. Click once to set the centre, then again to
set the radius.
    - Spray paint. Places blocks or items randomly around the point you clicked
on.

When placing a robot, the drawing tools are temporarily inaccessible. After the
robot has been placed, they return to use.
@endnode

@node blocks "It's a world of blocks and items"

There are 16 blocks and 8 items available in the editor. These are:
Blocks:
    - Empty. Totally inaccessible to the robots.
    - Floor. The basic block, robots can move on this.
    - Weak floor 1. Once a robot steps on this, this becomes weak floor 2.
    - Weak floor 2. Once a robot steps on this, this becomes empty space.
    - Arrow up. Robots can only move upwards from this.
    - Arrow right. Robots can only move to the right of this.
    - Arrow down. Robots can only move downwards from this.
    - Arrow left. Robots can only move to the left of this.
    - Water. Robots can only enter water if they are carrying a boat, or there's
another robot carrying a boat in the square.
    - Desert. Robots can only enter desert if they are carrying air
conditioning, or there's another robot carrying air conditioning in the square.
    - Red lock. Can be opened with red keys.
    - Green lock. Can be opened with green keys.
    - Message block. When added, you will be prompted for the message in this
block. The message can later be read by the robots.
    - Teleport. When added, you will be presented with the teleport destination
screen. Select the teleport destination by clicking the mouse. The teleport
location and its current destination are highlighted on the screen.
    - Pyramid. Like empty space, robots can't enter this.
    - Diamond deposit. Dropping diamonds onto this is the goal of the game.
Items:
    - Nothing. Like the name says, nothing whatsoever.
    - Diamond. Dropping these onto diamond deposits advances the game. The
diamonds disappear in the process.
    - Fuel. Containers containing 51 units of fuel for the robots.
    - Red key. To open red locks.
    - Green key. To open green locks.
    - Boat. To traverse upon water.
    - Air conditioning. To traverse upon desert.
    - Teleport ring. Stops teleports from functioning automatically when the
robot steps on them.

@node money "Money makes the world go round"

So far, I have had a few registrations for my earlier games, Excavation and
Cubical Worlds, but for some mysterious reason none for my last game, Mr UFO.
Anyway I've carried the keyfile system over from Mr UFO to this game.
  The version of RoboQuest itself included in this release is the full one.
However, the ShareWare version of RoboEd (the map editor) will refuse to save
maps. To register the program, you need a keyfile.
  Keyfiles are written personally for each person registering the game. The
person's name is included in the keyfile, and can be up to 20 characters long.
Keyfiles can also be password protected to prevent unauthorised people from
playing the registered version of the game. To use this feature, submit a
password of up to 20 characters when registering.
  You can buy a keyfile for Mr UFO, RoboEd, or both. Here are the possible
registration methods:

Method of registration                      SEK   FIM   DEM   USD   GBP
===============================================================================

1) You supply your own disks (1 DD disk for keyfiles, 2 DD disks for all games)
2) I provide disks for you

If you register by "all games", you get the following games: The Butterflies!,
Self Defense, Maze Mania, Fantasy Trade, The Secret of Arcturus, Super Daleks,
Lactose Intolerance, L, ZombieZ, Strateq, Excavation, Cubical Worlds, Mr UFO and
RoboQuest. All of them will be registered versions, of course. That's only 2.29
SEK, 1.57 FIM, 0.52 DEM, 0.29 USD or 0.18 GBP per game! Where else can you get
games this cheap? Not from many places, that's for sure.

If you want to register, please e-mail me at: palaste@cc.helsinki.fi
Or write to me at:
    Joona Palaste

@node amos "Professional widow"

Some people wonder why I still use AMOS. I often wonder the same too. To put it
shortly, AMOS is a simple, but quite powerful language. Its biggest downside is
its inability to function on a standard Intuition screen, not having to open a
non-system screen all the time. But I'm happy that I'm not the only person in
the world to program games in AMOS. Just read the Readers' Games part of Amiga
Format, and you'll see lots of other AMOS games. Well, a few, at least. Too bad
EuroPress has totally forgotten about AMOS's existence. A hint for EuroPress: A
real PC version of AMOS, unlike that stupid Klik'n'Play, would certainly get you
more buyers. Ask François Lionet, he's sure to have some vague recollection of
AMOS hidden in a corner of his mind, despite years of drinking French cognac
trying to forget it. =)
