"Mine" consists of the programs Mine.deutsch, Mine.english, their icons, the
documentations Mine.dok, Mine.doc, and its installer-file.

You may distribute and use Mine as long as Mine remains unchanged and
complete.

DISCLAIMER: MINE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IS MADE.
YOU CANNOT MAKE ME LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MINE DOES DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY TO ANYONE OR ANYTHING.  IF YOU USE MINE, YOU DO SO ON YOUR OWN
RISK!

Mine has been tested with Kickstart 3.0 ONLY.  It should run with Kickstart
2.0 as well, but I cannot try this.  So be careful with Kickstart<3.0.


So, what is Mine? It is a simple workbench game. You have a (square) board
consisting of fields with some mines hidden. All you have to do is to find
and mark them with the right mouse button.

If you click on a field with your left button, the field is unmasked. It
will tell you the number of mines hidden in it's direct neighbourhood if
there is no mine on it, otherwise the mine explodes and the game is over. It
is also over when all mines are marked and all other fields are unmasked.
Then the number of marked mines and the time it took decide whether you
enter the highscore-list (one for each combination mine-density/board-size)
or not (click somewhere inside the highscore-window to close it without
terminating the program)


You should give Mine 10000 bytes of stack. The usual 4kByte stack is not
large enough. If Mine needs more stack than it has, it terminates with a
"Modula-2-Laufzeitfehler: Stapel Überlauf"-requester, which is simply a
stack overflow.

If you type "Mine ?" in the CLI, you get a bunch of arguments. Most of them
work as tooltypes as well. Write KEYWORD ARGUMENT in the cli or
KEYWORD=ARGUMENT as tooltype (or only KEYWORD, if there is no argument).

Important is the tooltype WINDOW. Here you can specify a dos-window that
opens when you run Mine from the workbench. It is good to use the attribute
AUTO here...


Some people I want to say hello: Michael, Stephan, Fred Fish, AMOK (, ...)


So, that's it! Enjoy Mine!

PS:  If you are intrested in the source code and a MC68020+ version of Mine,
you can get it from me for DM 10.-- (inside Europe) or DM 20.-- (outside).
No stamps, please. I prefer cash.
