This is Mine 2.0, an update to Mine 1.8 on Fish disk 835.  There are some
bug fixes and some improvements (the highscore part has been rewritten,
there are now four different levels, and some internal things).  Each
combination level/board size has its own highscore list, and they are in the
current directory (and not somewhere they do not belong like S:).  Most
important:  Mine 2.0 always uses the default public screen and does not
(repeat:  NOT) open it's own multitasking-and-chipmem-goodbye-screen.  Mine
was written for kick 2.0 and up, but could be tested only with 3.0.  Source
in M2Amiga Modula-2 and (newest) 68020 version are available from the
author.
