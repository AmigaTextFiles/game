README for cuyo:


For the impatient
=================

To install cuyo, follow the instructions in the INSTALL file. Or follow
this ultra-short installation guide:
1.   ./configure (in the same directory as this file)
2.   make
3.   make install

To play cuyo without really installing it (perhaps because you are not root),
leave out step 3 and start cuyo directly in the src directory:
3b.  src/cuyo

If ./configure did not work or if you intend to modify cuyo, then read
README.maintainer instead.
