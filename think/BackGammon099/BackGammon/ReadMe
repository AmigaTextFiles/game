   Welcome back to BackGammon,

   due to good responses we got, here's an update. Please don't expect any
   revolutionary new functions, but from now on updates come on roling in...

   At the moment, there are still no proper rules available (maybe some 
   professional could write them...). The gameplay has been enhanced
   and have a look at the titlebar. There are some menus now available.

   So here is the quite stupid text:

   hopefully you know the game already and don't need any further 
   information on that game. In that case, just go on playing. For all
   the others (that might be one or two), here are the rules:

   The aim of the game is to win!!!! (What a funny game, I haven't heard
   of a game before, where you have to win). At the beginning of the 
   game, you may choose the colour of your pieces and the strength of
   your opponent (AMIGA is of course much stronger than ATARI, ATARI is 
   in fact a randomized mover). After selecting the options, the computer
   throws the dice (ALEA ACTA EST, as would Ceasar say). Let's say you've
   got a 4 and a 2. Then you're able to move either with one piece 4 and 
   with another 2 or you might move with one 6. If the dice show the same
   number on them, you may move 4 times the number on the dice (e.g. a 
   pair of 6 means 24 moves). The aim is to move into your square (either
   the upper or lower left corner, depending on your colour) and then take
   all the pieces out of the board. You've got a possibility to stop your
   opponent: If he/she has only one piece at a field, you can catch it 
   with a move to that field. The other piece will be removed from the 
   board and has to start from the beginning.

   We know that this is actually not very informative, but we hope, that
   you've understood it, otherwise ask someone who knows to play.

   Ciao,

   Igor & Danny
