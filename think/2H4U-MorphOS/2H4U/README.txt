INTRODUCTION

Thank you for downloading 2H4U v1.3.

This program has been tested and built on Windows (XP SP2), Linux (Ubuntu Dapper Drake, Edgy Eft and Feisty Fawn) and partialy on Mac Os X.

COMPILATION

Windows : The build version is given and is called 2H4U.exe. To rebuild, please install Code::Blocks IDE, and open 2H4U_win.cbp in the scripts folder. Then build the project (F9). You must have installed the librairies SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf and SDL_mixer in Code::blocks before building.

Linux : Using a console, go to the scripts folder, and type "make". You must have installed the packages called libsdl1.2-dev, libsdl-image1.2-dev, libsdl-ttf2.0-dev, libsdl-mixer1.2-dev, using applications like Synaptic or apt-get.

Mac OS : It should work the same way as Linux, using make (but it has not been tested yet).

If the sound causes troubles, you may disable it before building, just uncomment 
//#define NO_SOUND_2H4U in the file sdl_includes.h.

Please let us know of any successful building with any other OS, as well as the changes you may have done to the program.

Please do not hesitate to tell us about any change brought to the game, in any field.
