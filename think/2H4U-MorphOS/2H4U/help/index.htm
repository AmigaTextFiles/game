<h2>Goal of the game : </h2><br />
To score as many points as possible !<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, 2H4U is made up of two parts : the section on the bottom is very similar to "Breakout", while the upper section is a form of the game Tetris.<br />
<br />
<h2>Upper part</h2><br />
For the upper part of the game, you must align the bricks (using the moving and rotational buttons) to form horizontal lines. Once a line is completed filled up with the bricks (as well as on the left side as on the right side of the screen), the line will disappear and you will be given points<br />
Note that the more lines you make at a time, the more points you will receive.<br />
<br />
<h2>Bottom Part</h2><br />
For the bottom part of the game, or the "Breakout" part, you must make sure not to lose the ball in handling your "bat" or "racket". When the ball hits a colored brick, the brick becomes grey. Note that the ball goes through grey bricks. Once all of the bricks in a line are grey, that line disappears and you are given points.<br />
<br />
<h2>Game Over</h2><br />
The game ends (Game Over) when you have no more balls, or when the upper part gets filled up to the top of the screen.<br />
<br />
<h2>Points</h2><br />
Here is a reference chart showing the point values:<br />
<br />
<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Action</th>
			<th>Points</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Next level</td>
			<td>10 000</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1 line destroyed</td>
			<td>600</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2 lines destroyed</td>
			<td>2 500</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>3 lines destroyed</td>
			<td>10 000</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4 lines destroyed</td>
			<td>50 000</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1 line destroyed with the ball</td>
			<td>300</td>
		</tr>		
</table>
<br />
There are other tricks to scoring more points. And it's up to you to figure them out !<br />
<br />
<h2>Levels</h2><br />
To pass a level, you must make the required amount of lines. In each new level, the speed of both the ball and the bricks increase.<br />
