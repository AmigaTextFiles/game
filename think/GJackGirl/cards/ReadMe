                           Hi to all my Friends !
                          ------------------------

         Here comes a realy hot Cardset from the Boss himself ;^) .

You must put this in the Cards-Drawer of the Game "German Jack". The  Drawer
shoud  be  in the same Directory like the Game. Its much faster to found the
new Cardset, but you can put it whereever you want, `cause a Requester  will
ask you for the right Path.
But don`t load other  Datas. This  will  give  you  a  I/O- Error  and  will
finished the Game. No Problem but not funny !

The second Cardset with the name "Standard.abk" is the normal Cardset.  It`s
only  for reloading, when the Parents come into your Room, but Attention ! -
the Bobs are drawed, so all Cards will change after the next Round.

For all creativ People - if you got own Ideas for a  Cardset  (Comics,  Cars
and so on), look after the IFF-ABK-Converter in the Aminet-Drawer Game/Think
With this Tool it`s easy to make your own Cardset !

And remember: The Game GermanJack V1.0 is SHAREWARE !
Only 8 US-$ ore 10.- German Mark in cash to my Adress:
