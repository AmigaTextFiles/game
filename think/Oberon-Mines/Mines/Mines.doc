                           ---------------------

                A Minesweeper clone for the Oberon System V4




Oberon-Mines needs the Oberon System V4. The Oberon System is an operating
system, designed by Prof. N Wirth and Prof. Juerg Gutknecht, ETH Zuerich.
Implementations exits for Amiga, Mac, IBM-PC, IBM-RS6000 and many
workstations. You can download the version, you are interested in, from
ftp.inf.ethz.ch (129.132.101.33, directory /pub/Oberon/) and the
Amiga version from any AmiNet-Site (dev/obero/Oberon.lha), too.
You can use Oberon-Mines on any computer, Systen V4 is available for,
just by recompiling the sourcecode. No changes need to be made to the
sourcecode. Read the files released with the system, how to use the system
and his compiler.

If you like Mines and if you put it on a public domain disk library
or a mailbox, send me a postcard and tell how you get Mines.
You are only authorized to spread the files like you get it.


How to use:
Oberon-Mines is a simple Minesweeper program as you know it from many
computers. I think, i don`t have do say anythink about the rules.
Copy the files Mines.Mod, Mines.Tool, Mines.Score, Mines.Pal and
Mines.Menu.Text to your Oberon directory and compile Mines.Mod. If you are
using the greatest computer on earth, the Commodore Amiga, you can copy the
files Mines.Sym and Mines.Obj from directory Amiga too, so you do not need to
recompile Mines. If you are using Windows 3.x (you poor person), use the
files in the directory Windows. 11 letters to use as filename are not enough,
so the files are in a special format to support full length of filenames.
If you copy all files from Windows directory, there is no need to recompile
Mines. There could be problems at 4 MB Windows-Systems to work with the
Mines.Mod file and if you want to compile it. Some small changes are done at
Mines.Menu.Text, Mines.Mod und Mines.Tool for Windows.


Start Mines by activating Mines.Open. If you open the Mines.Tool, you will
see any kown command and how to use them. If you see a Trap after starting
Mines, kill Mines.Menu.Text and try again.

The right mousekey marks a field as a mine, the middle sets or clears a
? (only a help for your mind) and the left one shows the kind of the
field. Interclick clears the operation. If you select a field with a number
on it and interclick with right mousebutton, all neighbouring fields, that
are not marked as a mine, will be selected.
If you click at the smily at the top of the field, the game will restart.
You will see the number of mines to find left beside the smily and the
game time right beside it.
IF (system has a username) & (you like your username) THEN (Mines uses it)
ELSE (use Mines.SetUser to specify it)
There are a color and a black&white mode of Mines. Choose the one you like
with Mines.ColorMode. If you use the color mode, it will only loke nice, if
you use the right colors. "Colos.Load Mines.Pal" will load them. The Windows
version uses the standard colors and does not need the Mines.Pal file.
Mines uses a background task to display the game time. Kill that task with
Mines.StopTask before unloading the Mines module. If you do not like
tasks running at your system, Mines.TimeMode will switch to another mode.
This mode displays the time only if you select a field.

 If running at the Windows NT version of Oberon using Windows 3.1
