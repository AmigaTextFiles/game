@NODE th "Thanx..."

 Thanks go out to the Amiga Club of Szeged, the members of which beta
tested and helped out with their constructive criticism. Special thanks
to Hanzi, Micus who translated this text, to all those who composed the
music, and painted the gfx.  Thanks to Billy for Win'95, if it was any
better we might have switched :-).  Thanks to Intel for not producing a
68060 clone.  Thanks to Escom for making the best deal of their lives.
 Thanks to Guru for all the messages.

@NODE pl "Game play"

  On the title  screen you can  select levels, the load and save functions
 (they are not available in demo version), and the exit.  Select one level
 with the mouse and click the left mouse button .. screen goes down, music
 changes,  screen goes up,  and then you see the level. The stones must be
 moved to the exit marked by an X.

	There are four different colours of stones:

Blue			-  General stone. (no special functions)
Red			-  Special stone to move any other stone (only one)
Yellow			-  Not available!!!
Green			-  Teleport stone (not available)

	and four diffenrent of lifts:

Horizontal automatic	-  Stops at blue wall.
Vertical automatic	-  Stops at blue wall.
Horizontal moveable	-  It works after pushing the switcher
			   (marked by the arrows)
Vertical moveable	-  It works after pushing the switcher
			   (marked by the arrows)

  The lifts can carry only one stone, and if a stone doesn't stand fully
 on the lift,  then the lift will not start.  The time is showed on the
 upper-left corner of screen, if time is out, you were unlucky. (I think,
 it will never happen).  The time at the begining starts with   9.59.98.
 You can use the CRSR keys for control.

 The level is completed, when you have moved all the stones to the exit.
