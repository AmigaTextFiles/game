EquiLog  is nothing but a Master Mind :  I think it's a better name for it,
that's all.

EquiLog package comprises :

* the program EquiLog itself
* its icon EquiLog.info
* this file EquiLog.Doc_Fra or EquiLog.Doc_Eng
* a drawer c: containing HeliosMouse
* a drawer l: containing Helios-Handler


Installation :
------------

- copy HeliosMouse in the repertory c: of your system
- copy Helios-Handler in the repertory l: of your system

WARNING  :  if you use another window activator (DMouse, MachIII or other),
please quit it before launching EquiLog.

- that's all :  now launch EquiLog from its workbench icon or from shell.



Great thanks to David P. Cervone, author of HeliosMouse.



How to play :
-------------



The player chooses his mode of game and the level of difficulty (3,4,5 or 6
pawns) in the right part of the screen.

There are three different games :

- human versus human :  player A chooses a combination that player B has to
  discover.

- human versus Amiga :  The player  has to  discover  the combination  that
  Amiga has chosen.

- Amiga versus human :  Amiga has to discover the combination chosen by the
  player.   The  latter may or may not enter his combination.  If he enters
  it,  Amiga  will  make  propositions and supplies answers itself.  If the
  player  does  not  want  to enter his combination, he will have to answer
  Amiga's propositions with the triangular buttons.



The player chooses his colors with the cursor that appears in the left part
of  the  screen  when  he  goes on.  Then, he puts the selected pawn on the
central game area.

To erase a pawn, just click two times on it.

The upper lunar rocket erases the complete current line.

The  lower  lunar  rocket  repeats a line :  the undermost line of the game
area if the player clicks on or under this line, or every line on which the
player clicks.

To  uphold  his proposition, the player must click with the right mousebut-
ton.

A "hole" without pawn is not considered as a color.



Remember  that  in  Master  Mind, the first number (in white on the screen)
indicates  the  number of pawns of the right color at the right place.  The
second  number (in grey on the screen) indicates the number of pawns of the
right color but not at the right place.



You can remove every requester by only clicking on the right mousebutton.



Warnings (but not bugs) :

If  you click just on the boundary of central area and left area, your bowl
disappears  and  you  must  restart  a  new  game.   If  you  maintain  the
mousebutton  pressed and you come and go over the screen, you will probably
crash the system.

EquiLog does not support screen zapping : if you come and go among screens,
you may have a certain difficulty to restore the control of events.

But in normal use, you don't have to do such things.
