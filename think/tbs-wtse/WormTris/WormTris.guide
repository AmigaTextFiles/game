@node "New" "New stuff"

        THIS IS A STAND ALONE RELEASE, ALL OLD WORMTRIS FILES ARE NOW
         OBSOLETE AND CAN BE DELETED, EXCEPT FOR THE HIGHSCORE FILE,
        WHICH SHOULD BE RENAMED AS WORMTRIS.HSC AND BE PUT IN THE DATA
                                  DIRECTORY.

 What's new in this version of WormTris?

  и On popular demand (well, three people asked for it..) there's a PAUSE
    option included in this special edition. Just press 'p' to pause the
    game, and any key to continue.
 
  и NEW feature: The WORMUTATION, check it out! 

  и File structure enhanced: Now there are only 4 datafiles, this doesn't
    add any real value to the game but it just looks pro!

  и BUG FIX: There was a problem with the PIT-PURGE feature, it would just
    result in an infinite loop. I hope this is fixed now. (or else I just
    release another fix version :^)
 
  и AmigaGuide documentation! :^)

  Oh, by the way: the flashing number under the 'press button to play' text
  when you just loaded the game indicates how much chipmem is used. It is
  only for developing purposes, to keep me from using too much mem (I have 2
  meg Chip, and I wanted this game to run with 1 meg chip :^)

@node "Yourfault" "Disclaimer stuff"
  
  Whatever happens: It's not my fault! :^)

@endnode

@node "Shareware" "Shareware stuff"

 This is the SHAREWARE section (Oh, please, keep on reading!).

 This in my opinion quite well done game is SHAREWARE. That means: if you
 play it a lot (and you DO :^) then you are encouraged to encourage me to
 keep on programming by sending me the quite LOW shareware fee of just
 10 (ten) dutch guilders. In return for the money you get the chance to
 play future games I develop. If you DON'T want to pay me, then so be it,
 but that is both immoral and illegal. You already have the FULL game, as
 this game is not crippled in any way, so I trust you pay for it. If I
 don't get much 'donations' then I *WILL* revert to crippling my games,
 (pay first, play later) as I will have lost the trust in the shareware
 concept. THINK about it, then decide my destiny :^).
          
If you thought about it and decided to pay me after all, then you can do
this in numerous ways:

  и For dutch users: Via de POSTGIRO. Stort het tientje op giro rekening
    nummer 5139305, Lees verder voor adres.

  и Via snailmail: Put the cash (no coins!) in a SEALED envelope to:

            J. van den Berge
            Hontestraat 15
            Oost-Souburg, Zeeland
            The Netherlands

    if you use this method, then 'shield' the money by putting it in a
    christmas card or something, or else it might not reach me at all! 
    Also for bug reports

  и Give it to me personally, although this method is not very handy if
    you don't live in Zeeland! ;^)


  и Other ways to contacting me:

    - Try the @{" TBS " LINK "TBS"} BBS systems, leave a messy to eNTiTy.

    - Mail networks: AGANET, FIDONET, AMYNET.

    - E-mail: eNTiTy@155-1600-100-10.iwg.nl


@endnode

@node "Thnx" "Thank you!"

THANKS:

 everyone who has contacted me about the game. sadly there were only 3,
and I really think that figure misses atleast one zero at the end, given
the widespread distribution of this game. Come on people, are you afraid
to write me or is it just lazyness? I really need the feedback! WRITE!

 The BrotherS: For testing and distributing. Also thanks for the nice
long chats which cost me a fortune (although that's probably my fault :^)

SPECIAL THANKS:

 to R.G.A.M. de Witt who has been (the first) kind enough to pay the
 shareware fee. Much thanks dude! I'd wish there were more like you :^)

@endnode

@node "Requirements" "Waddayaneed?"

 To play this kewl game you need:

 и A working Amiga system with kickstart 2.0 (didn't test older kicks),
 и A joystick :^)
 и 10 dutch guilders ;^)

@endnode

@node "Introduction" "What is this stuff?"

 It's Tetris...

 It's Worms... 

 It's COOL!

 WormTris is, as its name suggests, a Tetris clone with a bit of Worms mixed
 in. It has numerous special features which can help or hinder you in your
 quest for the all mighty HighScore.

@endnode

@node "Play" "What do I have to do to play this stuff?"

 Errm... Do I have to? ;^) You play this game with a joystick, A joystick
 is a usually plastic device with which you can use to influence the
 actions of a program supporting such a device. In this case you use the
 joystick to execute these actions:
               
 up   : Clear pit if you have 25 cash (see below)   *BUGFIXED*

 down : Perform a positive vertical translation on the current block

 left : Perform a negative horizontal translation on the current block

 right: Perform a positive horizontal translation on the current block

 fire : Perform a 0.5 Pi clockwise rotation on the current block

 the purpose is to make lines with the handed blocks, the game is really
 easy to play, even without this doc you can still play it..

@endnode

@node "Features" "What's in this game?"

 Aaaah, nice.. This is what makes the game fun!

 to 'get' a feature, make a line when a '?' appears above the block. If you
 don't make the line, then you don't get the feature. 

 Here's a few cool features:

 UFO:      The most irritating feature. It can do numerous things, but you
           have to find out yourself what it does...

 Extend:   A unique feature never seen in any other tetris clone, this
           extends the bottom of the pit to hold an extra line!

 Bonus:    The most dull thing in any game, a score bonus..... DUH!

 Revenge:  Aah, you'd better not get this one when your kill ratio is a tad
           high!

 Suicidal: This detonates any sheep in the pit! Very not-nice when you have
   Sheep   a few on screen...

That's not all folks! There are quite some features in the game, and it would
spoil the effect if I would tell 'm all!

There are also some 'special' blocks, which can either help, or annoy you:

    Worm:  You can make combo's with worms, they are affected by gravity,
           so if you would make a line, and a worm is above that line, the
           worm would fall down if the line dissapears, possibly making
           another line. you could also just dump a worm in a long shaft,
           but that results a lower score that with the other method...
           Worms can get squashed by blocks, and your kills are noted.

    Sheep: This block is very handy to destroy other blocks which are in the
           way, the sheep explodes when you press the fire button while it
           is falling, or when it gets squashed. Sheeps behave, apart from
           their explosive nature, exactly the same as worms, thus you can
           also make combo's with sheeps. Be careful with sheep! If they
           explode, all other sheeps in range will also go (chain-reaction)!

    Laser: A bit overpowered block, it allows you to shoot away unwanted
           blocks, or, if you're fast enough, clear the entire pit..
           press fire to shoot the laser. you can fire as many times as
           you can, until the block can't drop anymore.

 The brothers is a group of really nice guys and above all: AMIGA freaks,
 releasing quite some good software. The reason I joined is because they
 asked me ;^) and because my stuff gets spread much faster via BBSes and
 InterNet, I can't afford it to spread my stuff myself.. (have to watch
 the phone-bill! ;^)

 As you can see, it's quite much what I still have to do... NOT!
 This may change if you send me some cash and ideas! If you have really
 cool ideas for this game then please tell me. If I include YOUR idea in
