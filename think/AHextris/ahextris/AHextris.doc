0.Preface
=========

   AHextris is an extremely addictive, yet simple game.  The original idea
came from David Markley who wrote the Unix version (xhextris) and put the
source code in public domain.  Jeff Teague made a direct port of it to the
Amiga and called it hextris. That version also is in public domain. What I
did was rewrite it completely from scratch to make best use of the Amiga's
capabilities.

   This game is Copyright (c) by Ives Aerts and may only be distributed
in its complete, unmodified form (program and docs) and as long as only
a moderate charge is asked for it.

   This game is shareware.  If you like this game I would appreciate it if
you send me a contribution of $15 or 500Bfr (Belgian Francs). Please send
money by international money order, EuroCheck (in Belgian Francs) or cash,
'cos it's quite expensive for me to cash in other checks. Registered users
who supply an e-mail address or add 3$ (for a disk and postage) to the
shareware fee, will receive full C-source code of the game. My address is:

1.System requirements
=====================

   To run AHextris you'll need OS2.04 or higher and reqtools.library
V37 (included in the package) or higher. If you haven't got OS2.04 (or
want to go for less features but no shareware contribution) then take
a look at Jeff Teague's version.

2.Playing the game
==================

   First of all you should copy reqtools.library to your LIBS: directory,
either from the CLI or from Workbench by clicking on the InstallLib icon.
Then you can start the game from Workbench or CLI. It takes no arguments.

   To play the game use the cursor keys and the space bar:

                       left - left
                      right - right
                         up - rotate clockwise
                       down - rotate counterclockwise
                      space - drop piece faster

                        f10 - pause
                        esc - abort game

   The game also pauses if its window becomes inactive, make it active
again to resume the game. Note also that there is an invisible drag bar
and depth gadget at the top of the screen.

3.Main menu
===========

   The options in the main menu are rather self-explaining, so I will only
discuss them briefly:

   · One Player Game
         Starts a one player game.

   · Two Player Game
         Not available at the moment.

   · Game Options
         Brings up the Game Options menu. (see section 4)

   · Merge Hiscores
         If you and your friends play AHextris on multiple machines, you
         can use this button to join your hiscore lists. A filerequester
         will pop up, asking for the location of the other person's hiscore
         file. The hiscores in that file will be merged to the hiscores
         currently in memory. When you exit the game, the merged hiscore
         list will be saved.

   · Exit
         Now what could this do ? ;^)

4.Game Options Menu
===================

   In this menu you can alter the game's configuration. Available options
at the moment are:

   ·Player one name
         Here you can enter a default name for player one. This will appear
         in the name requester at the start of the game.

   ·Ask name/Lock name 
         If set to lock name, this option prevents the name requester at
         the start of the game from coming up and thus forces AHextris
         to use the default name.

   ·Limited hiscores
         When playing AHextris with multiple persons on the same machine
         it often happens that a single person will dominate the hiscore
         list, occupying almost all of the 50 entries. Usually this player
         will only be interested in his highest scores but his lower
         scores may prevent weaker players from achieving a hiscore entry.
         If you use this option, only the 10 highest scores of each person
         will be remembered enabling weaker players to keep a log of their
         game play too. On the other hand this doesn't make much sense if
         you play the game alone so in that case you probably won't use
         this options.

   ·Main Menu
         Return to the main menu and save your options to "AHextris.options"
         if they were changed.

4.ReqTools.library
==================

   Thanks go to Nico François for writing reqtools.library. It is a package
that every Amiga programmer should take a look at. The following is an
excerpt from the documentation of ReqTools 1.0d:

                          reqtools.library

                          (c) 1991/1992 Nico François

    reqtools.library is a standard Amiga shared, runtime library.  The
purpose of ReqTools is to make it a lot quicker and easier to build standard
requesters into your programs.  ReqTools is designed with Commodore's style
guidelines in mind, all requesters have the look-and-feel of AmigaDOS
Release 2.

    If you use ReqTools in your programs you do not have to worry about
requesters too much.  You'll have a lot more time to concentrate on the
really important stuff your program does.

    The library has been inspired by req.library (by Colin Fox & Bruce
Dawson) and Commodore's own asl.library.  You will find it shares a lot of
the features with these two libraries, while it has some additional ones as
well.  While asl.library was great in look-and-feel I felt it lacked quite
a bit in the power department.  This power _is_ mostly available in
req.library, but this doesn't fit in too well with AmigaDOS Release 2.  So
the idea for a new requester library was born.

    I tried to make all requesters in ReqTools very powerful, easy to use
and with a very nice new-look 3D interface.  Efficiency was also considered
very important.  The 2.0 version of the library is about 20K large.  I'm
sure you will agree this is not too much considering what ReqTools offers.

    ReqTools features the following requesters:  a query requester, a
string requester, a number requester, a file requester, a font requester
and a palette requester.

5.Future
========

   Now that the game is out I will let it rest for some time and try to study
for the upcoming exams 8^( and finish some other projects that are lying
around.  I do have plans for a two player mode though, where you can play
together (two falling blocks in one large container) or against each other
(filling lines in your container causes lines to appear at the bottom of the
other player's container). The one player version could also be extended with
random hexes appearing, etc... Useful suggestions are always welcome.
A non-interlace version would also be handy for the people out there who
don't have a flicker fixer but since I have one I'm not very motivated
at the moment (unless there's a considerable demand).
