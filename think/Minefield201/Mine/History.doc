HISTORY:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.01  02/27/93	Fixed a bug which crept in that caused some text not to
		be displayed when using the custom screen.

2.00  02/26/93	Added support for public screens.  Icon tooltypes/CLI
		options for settings.  Moved history out of doc file.

1.19  01/19/93	Changed 'about' display to intuition easy-requester.
		'Expert' gadget wasn't disabled while in about display.
		In pause mode, the window which covers the board wasn't
		activated, which made it hard to un-pause.

1.18  01/13/93	Fixed bug when pausing before timer starts.  Your first
		click in the board will never be a mine now to make
		starting a game easier.  New CLI argument "noscores"
		and WB icon tooltype "NOSCORES" will disable the loading
		and saving of the score file.

1.17  01/02/93	Finally found and fixed the CloseWindow() bug causing
                enforcer hits, alerts, and crashes.  Should be quite
                stable now (famous last words :-).  New pause mode:
                game pauses when you hit space, or the window/screen
                becomes inactive (i.e. you switch screens).  Fixed bug
		causing stack overflows.  Game starts in expert mode
		now by default.

1.16  12/17/92	Recompiled with SAS/C 6.1.  Made some minor changes to the
                code to make it more 'correct'.  However, minefield
                sometimes gives a 'recoverable alert' on exiting on my
                A3000!  Will look into this...  Also changed my e-mail
                address in the about requester.

1.15  04/18/92  Improved way of determining overscan screen size.
                Fixed bug: clicking 'start' while board being drawn left
                'start' gadget in undetermined state.  Can now click in
                score chart to close it (yeah! shared IDCMP).  Better way
                of drawing images (flags and mines).  Mines are now graphic
                instead of text (*).  Added expert mode - see manual.  Fixed
                up some incorrect or outdated info in the manual.

1.14  02/16/92  Gadgets clicked while board is being drawn are discarded.
                Added an icon!  Drastically speeded up board drawing.
                Found a bug in about window which sometimes caused crashing.
                Removed 'help' button for release.

1.13  02/08/92  Exiting 'about' window would enable HELP gadget.  Fixed.
                Increased stack size to prevent overflow during recursion.
                Fixed 'about' window crash bug.

1.12  02/02/92  If you get a high score, it is highlighted in the score
                chart.  Timer doesn't start until you click the mouse.
                Clicks in main window while other window (such as scores
                or about) is open are discarded now.  Medium and large
                boards had too many mines.  The number of mines is now
                proportional to the number of squares in the board.

1.11  01/28/92  Fixed bug which caused small screen to open for those who's
                workbench screen was non-interlaced.  Score chart is only
                displayed if you win a game.  All windows (score, messages,
                name entry) centered in play-area.

1.10  01/27/92  Implemented 'about' display.

1.09  01/26/92  Game opens to size of workbench screen.  Reorganized and
                cleaned up code.  Game board is centered in the play-area.

1.08  01/24/92  Fixed bug in random number generator which caused mines to
                only appear on odd x locations and even y locations!!
                Thanks Glade for spotting that... I never noticed!

1.07  01/23/92  Found similar bugs in score display, main gadget check,
                and get_name().

1.06  01/22/92  Found and fixed the insidious crashing bug! Thanks Doug...

1.05  01/19/92  Major changes to code. Changed start button to a cycle-
                gadget so QUIT button isn't overloaded. Added ABOUT
                gadget (doesn't work yet). Overall code cleanup. Started
                using RCS for revision control.  Correct launches from WB.

1.04  01/18/92  Auto-detaches from CLI

1.03  01/17/92  Changed method of exiting score chart from QUIT button
                to SCORES button.

1.02  01/14/92  Added 2.04 version lookup string.  Tried unsuccessfully
                to fix the crashing bug.

1.01  01/20/91  Code cleanup.

1.00  01/08/91  First release.
