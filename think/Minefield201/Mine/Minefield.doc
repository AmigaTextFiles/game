NOTE:
----
Minefield works ONLY on Amigas running Workbench 2.04 or greater!


DESCRIPTION:
------------
Minefield is a fun and addictive game in which the object is to find
all the mines in a minefield.  The minefield is a rectangular grid of
squares.  You are equipped with a mine proximity detector, which will
tell you how many mines are near you.  You also know how many mines
are in the minefield, and have one flag for each mine.  When you think
you know where a mine is, you put a flag at that place to mark it.
The score for each game is the amount of time it took you to win.
Therefore, lower scores are BETTER than high scores.  A score chart is
kept for each type of game (difficulty level and board size).


STARTING MINEFIELD:
-------------------

Minefield can be started from the CLI or from Workbench.  When started
from the CLI it automatically detaches itself, so there is no need to
start it with the "run" command.  There are several options that can
be specified when starting Minefield.  These can either be set in the
icon tooltypes (select the icon and choose "Information" from the
"Icons" menu) or as CLI arguments.

NOSCORES	- The high scores will not be saved to disk.  Normally,
		the scores are saved.

NOVICE		- The game will start in novice mode (see "expert mode"
		below in the manual.  Normally expert mode is used.

PUBSCREEN=name	- Specify the public screen to open on.  If no screen
		name is given in the tooltype, the default public screen
		is used.  On the CLI, a screen must be named if this
		option is used.  If this tooltype or CLI argument is
		not given, Minefield opens its own screen.

DIFFICULTY=easy/hard	- Starts the game in either easy or hard mode.
			The default is easy.

SIZE=small/medium/large	- Starts with either a small, medium, or large
			board size.  The default is small.


GETTING STARTED:
----------------
If you start Minefield on its own screen, you will see a row of gadgets
along the right side of the screen.  If you use a public screen, a set
of menus will be supplied instead.  The gadgets and menus are described
here.

expert: This sets whether or not you want expert mode.  See GAME PLAY.

easy/hard: This is the difficulty selector.  It toggles between easy and
      hard. It determines how many mines are in the minefield.

small/medium/large: This determines the size of the minefield.

start/end: This starts a new game or ends the current game.

scores: This displays the score chart for the currently selected game
        type.  Clicking in the scores window will close it.

about: This will show you a little information about the program and
       its author, me!

exit: This exits minefield.


GAME PLAY:
----------
Once you have chosen a game type and selected "start", the minefield
will be drawn on the screen.  At the top are two counters: One lists
the number of flags you are holding.  The other indicates the amount
of time that has passed since the game started.

There are two things you may do while playing:

Use the mouse to point to a square and press the left mouse button.
This will cause you to "step" on the square.  If there is a mine on
the square, you are killed!  If there ISN'T a mine there, you will
activate your mine-detector which will tell you how many mines are
ADJACENT to the square you stepped on.  For example, if the number 2
appears, it means that there are two mines in the squares around
yours.  If there are no mines adjacent, i.e. the number is zero, the
square is cleared rather than labeled with a "0".  This improves the
clarity of the board.  Also, in this case, the computer will save you
some time: Since the number is zero, you know that all the squares
around yours are not mined!  Therefore, the computer will
automatically step on them for you.  If any of THOSE are also zero's,
the squares adjacent those are also stepped on.  This can clear off
quite a large part of the board for you.

If you think you know where a mine is, you can put a flag there by
pressing the right mouse button over that square.  Once a square is
flagged, you can not step on it.  If you realize you made a mistake,
you may pick up a flag by pressing the right mouse button there again.
Once you have correctly flagged all the mines, you win!  If your time
is one of the top 15 for that game type, you will be asked to enter
your name for the score chart.  Scores are saved in the file
s:minefield.scores

Clicking on "abort" will end the current game.  Clicking "exit" will
exit the program.


EXPERT MODE:
------------
In non-expert mode (novice mode), Minefield gives you a chance to
change your mind before stepping on a square or flagging it.  When you
click with a button, the square is highlighted.  When you release the
button, you step down or place a flag, depending on the button
pressed.  If you decide you do not want to do this, you can move off
the square, and then release the button.  The action will be
cancelled.  Once players become expert at Minefield, they move and
click squares very quickly.  Sometimes, they click down on a square,
and before their finger releases the mouse button, they have moved off
the square, resulting in the square not being stepped on or flagged.
Expert mode solves this problem.  In expert mode, when you click the
mouse button DOWN, the square is IMMEDIATELY stepped on or flagged.
The game does not wait for the button to be released.  If you find
that you are moving quickly and are 'missing' squares when you try to
click them, this may be the answer.


SCORE CHARTS:
-------------
If you click the "scores" button, or achieve a high score after a
game, the score chart for the current game type is displayed.  If you
just got a high score, your score and name are highlighted.  By
clicking the difficulty and size buttons you may view the score charts
of the other game types.  Select "scores" to exit the scorechart, or
"exit" to exit the program.

If you do not wish to have the score file created, you may run
minefield with the "noscores" argument from the command line
("minefield noscores") or insert the "NOSCORES" tooltype into the
icon, by selecting the icon and selecting "Information" from the
"Icons" workbench menu.
