Things to do for Minfield, in approximate order or urgency:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

	o Allow user to look through score boards on pubscr

	o Require the user to turn over all the squares!

	o When scores are off, should keep track during each game session.

	o Allow a mouse-click to unpause the game in pause mode.

	o Allow placement of the game window on public screens; i.e.
		LEFT=100 TOP=100 or "minefield left 100 top 100".

	o Start gadget should not be a cycle gadget for future OS compat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe start a 3.0-only version of Minefield once the current version
is going smoothly.  This one will have pen-sharing on public screens
and anything else I can think of!
