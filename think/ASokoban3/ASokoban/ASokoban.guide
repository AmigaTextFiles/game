@{b}Wellcome to ASokoban!@{ub}

This is as implementation of the famous warehouse keeper game Sokoban. It
has the original 90 levels of the UNIX game, which means that if you have
already played the original game, you will find ASokoban's stages familiar.

ClassAct is a set of BOOPSI gadget and image classes, designed to speed
up and simplify the development of GUI applications. Free to users of the
applications, ClassAct is available as shareware and commercial licences
for Amiga developers. The licence includes the development kit, support,

@node Acknowledgements "Acknowledgements"

Many people have shared their feelings about ASokoban with me, but there
are a few who's ideas, comments and work have helped me a lot in improving
this game. These people include Nils Görs and Aris Basic.

I hope that you will always let me know your feelings about my products.
It's through such communication that the progress of Amiga software
continues to be accomplished.

Last but not least I would like to thank Panagiotis Cristias for letting
me take over this project. Without his original work ASokoban wouldn't
have been what it is today.

@node Installation "Installation"

First make sure you have installed the @{"ClassAct" link ClassAct} BOOPSI classes.
To install ASokoban from scratch or to update an old version just run the
installation script. (The script requires Commodore's Installer to run. If
you don't have it, it can be found on aminet).

If you install ASokoban 3 in the same location as an old version (i.e. 2.x)
your old score file will be converted to a new format when the game is run.

You can still use old data files, but you might want to rename them, since
the name of the data file also becomes the name of your player. You are
advised to place any data files into your chosen @{"Save directory" link ToolTypes}.

@endnode


@node Requirements "System Requirements"

ASokoban will run on any Amiga computer with version 2.0 or higher of the OS
(or at least I hope it will).

If you have version 2.1 or higher ASokoban will try to use the @{"language" link Localization} you
have selected through Preferences.

ASokoban requires the @{"ClassAct" link ClassAct} BOOPSI classes.

@endnode


@node Troubleshooting "Troubleshooting"

I havn't put any effort in writing code to display error messages when
something goes wrong. If you have any problem running ASokoban please
contact @{"me" link Address}.

@node Game "The Game"

Sokoban is Japanese for Warehouse keeper. The purpose of the game is to
push all the packets through the maze into the safe. You can ONLY push
the packets - you can't pull them, pick them up or in any other way
manipulate them. Once all the packets are in the safe you proceed to the
next level. There is no time limit (you can sit all day trying to solve a
level). If you have already solved a level you can try to solve it again -
this time with less moves and pushes (there is a highscore entry for
every level). 

You can move your man with either the cursor keys or the mouse. The left
mouse button moves the man to the location you click at without making
any pushes. The right mouse button pushes the closest adjacent packet
to the location you clicked at. The middle mouse button undoes your last
move.

@node History "Version History"

(v1.0a - v1.1c by Panagiotis Christias)
1.0a    : First stable version. Distributed among my friends only for beta
          testing.

1.0b    : First official release.

1.1     : Compiled with SAS C 6.1 using Reqtools.library 2.1. Undo bug fixed
          (found it myself!). Now ASokoban saves its position  automatically
          on exit ( reported by Kriton Kyrimis ) . Level 15  bug fixed , now
          ASokoban  counts as saved  packets which are  in the safe from the
          beginning of a level (like level 15 ) . First reported by  Carsten
          Steger . When  loading a datafile  maxlevel won't decrease if max-
          level of datafile is smaller than  current maxlevel . Suggested by
          Sebastian Delmont.

1.1c    : ASokoban used to have some problems  when finishing a level  using 
          the mouse . Bug is fixed , now  ASokoban  does not  lose any IDCMP 
          message ( reported by Markus Torpvret) .  This version of ASokoban
          supports any  kind ( and size ) of font  for the titlebar .  First
          reported by Terence Russell and Ives Aerts ( still Asokoban is not
          font sensitive, sorry...).

(Project taken over by Lorens Younes)
v2.0  (95-02-08) ASokoban is now fontsensitive (falls back to topaz 8 if the
                 graphics won't fit with the user prefered fonts).
                 Support for locale.library added.
                 Gadgets are now disabled when they have no function.
                 PUBSCREEN and DATAFILE tooltypes added.
                 New highscore list (one high score for each level instead of
                 an overall top ten).
                 Documentation in AmigaGuide format.
                 Installation script for Commodore's Installer.
                 ReqTools.library no longer used for requesters
                 (asl filerequester used instead).
v2.1  (95-02-25) ASokoban will no longer crash you system if the number of
                 moves exceed 9999 (reported by Jouni Jääskeläinen).
                 Zoom gadget (re)added on Panagiotis Christias' "demand" ;-)
v2.2  (95-03-01) Now ASokoban correctly handles translated gadget labels
                 without an undersore (reported by Uwe Röhm).
v2.3  (95-05-27) Undo no longer causes system failure under AmigaOS 2.x (first
                 reported by Fredrik Hällgren who also solved the problem for
                 me).
                 Five more levels included from xsokoban.
v2.4  (95-06-05) Bug that caused some strange text to appear over the name
                 gadget fixed (reported by Niels Knoop).
v2.5  (95-07-06) Added LANGUAGE tooltype (requested by Niels Goers).
v2.6  (95-07-17) Fixed layout bug that occured when using fonts with height
                 less then 8 pixels (reported by Lauri Aalto).
v2.7b (95-08-??) Version only released to beta-testers. It used XPM images to
                 get colorfull graphics, but it was very slow!

v3.0  (96-08-11) A completly rewritten version. Major new features are
                 ARexx support, external graphic files (XPM format),
                 external level files (text), unlimited undo, improved
                 mouse support and improved handling of data files (players).
                 Also, ASokoban now uses the ClassAct GUI toolkit.
v3.1  (96-11-19) Fixed problem with large fonts.

@node Future "Plans for the Future"

Write more @{"catalogs" link Localization} (if you help me).
Add "online-help".
More ARexx commands.

@endnode


@node Localization "Localization"

ASokoban is localized, so if you have v2.1 or higher of the OS ASokoban will
try to use the language you have set in Preferences. If there is no catalog
for your language, English will be used as default.

Since I'm not very good at languages I've only written one additional catalog
(the Swedish one). However I've included some files so that you easily can
make ASokoban support your language too.
