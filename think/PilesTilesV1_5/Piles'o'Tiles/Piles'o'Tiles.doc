   The full version of Piles'O'Tiles costs only £5.
 
   You are pefectly welcome to play the demo for months on end without paying!
   If you do play a lot then it would be wise to update because of the new
   tile setups as well as the extra copy of the old game giving you 84 levels!!!!
  
   I will be updating the game in early 1997 with a total re-write in Blitz Basic
   so that I can make it more system friendly including real multitasking as well
   as giving you AGA colours and the chance to use your own tiles. All this will
   be *FREE* to registered users of this game so why not order this game now while
   the FREE update offer is still available....

   Anyone from outside the U.K. can send a £5 note or at least £5 worth of your
   own currency! I will accept a 15fl 10US$ 15DM and basicly any currency of
   around £8....

   If you want to Email me then post to :- paulb@sneech.demon.co.uk

   If you have Internet Access then I could possibly send you the full version
   via the net. If you want to contact me on the net about anything then look
   for me on IRC under the nickname 'shoecake'. Get in touch any way you can...

   When you order your copy it would help me if you were to give me other
   details, like:-

   1. Amiga Set-Up, inc. Hard Drive? Memory, Workbench Version 1.3,3.0 etc.

   2. Where you got hold of this demo. If you got it off a mate then tell me
   that! You see I know exactly where I've sent the demo to so I'll be happy
   if you can tell me where it's traveled to! When a magazine uses one of my
   demo's I get loads of orders and I presume thats the reason. But after a
   few months I might get a new bunch of orders and I always wonder why? I
   know it will pop up in all sorts of places so let me know!

   Instructions
   ------------

   If you've played Dragon Tiles or Shanghai or any other Tiles Game then you
   wont need much help. You can skip to the next section called
   Piles'O'Tiles Extras.

   Heres a quick Tiles lesson......

   The board is made up of between 80-260 tiles. Each Picture Tiles occurs four
   times, so an 80 tile board needs 20 different Picture Tiles.

   The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board.
   You have to remove two matching tiles at a time and they must be FREE!

   By free I mean that it must have a Free space either to the left or
   the right or both. It doesn't matter if there's a free space above or below
   the Tile. It must be a space left or right. If a tile is on the edge of the
   screen or on the end of a row or simple alone by itself then it is Free.

   To remove two tiles you simply select the first tile and then select
   a second matching tile. When the two Tiles are selected they will be
   removed from the board. If you select a tile and then decide you don't
   want to remove it then you simply re-select the same tile.

   The game is over when you've cleared the whole board of tiles.

   The trick of the game is to decide which pairs to remove. Every game IS
   possible so if you don't clear a board it's because you made a mistake!
   
   Imagine the board looks like this...

   fig a.     [C][C]            fig b.     [B][A][B][A]
           [B][A][B][A]                       [B][B]
              [B][B][C]
              [C]

   It doesn't matter what order you remove tiles [C] because you wont get
   stuck. But after removing the [C] tiles you can see in fig.b that you
   have to remove the [B] tiles in a strict order. If you take the bottom
   two tiles you will be stuck. If you take the far left tile and any of
   the bottom tiles then you will be okay. I know it's a simple example but
   it shows you what to look out for. Once you get used to the pitfalls you
   will start playing skillfully rather than click and hope!

   Piles'O'Tiles Extras!
   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

   To help compare your play with other peoples or to improve on your own
   Tiles skill, you will be able to Score points. 100 Points are given
   to you for every pair you take off. At the same time you will loose
   a point for every couple of seconds you wait between moves.

   At the end of the game you will either receive a bonus for clearing
   the whole board or loose some points for not completing the board.

   At any point in the game you are sure you can't take any more Tiles
   you can press on the STOP button. This will stop the timer and end your
   game.

   Sometimes when you play you wont be able to see a matching pair but your
   are sure there is one! you can select the '?' Button. This will search
   the whole board for a matching pair. At the same time you will loose some
   of your points. Sometimes you'll only loose a few points but if you are
   very unlucky you might loose 200 or more! It's better than stoping the
   game when you could have continued! If you choose '?' and there's no pair
   on the whole board then the game will be stopped for you!

   Thank You
