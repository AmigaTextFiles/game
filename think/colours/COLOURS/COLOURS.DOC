_____________________________________________________________________________

[II] Introduction


    (COLOURS IS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS YOU SHOULD USE BEFORE READING THE
            INSTRUCTIONS, FOR IT IS FAR FROM BEING DIFFICULT!)

COLOURS is the cunning synthesis between Tetris and Breakout. You control a 
little spaceship in the centre of the screen; coloured tiles invade the 
screen from the borders trying to reach your ship. To stop them you are armed
with a flying, coloured disk. Shooting it at a tile will add to your score 
and obliterate the tile, if it matches the colour of your disk. If not, the 
disk will be thrown back to your ship with the colours of the disk and the 
tile swapped. The disk's new colour may now enable you to kill a different 
tile. The game ends, if the tiles catch up with you.


_____________________________________________________________________________

[III] Additional rules


If your disk hits a row of tiles with the same colour, all of them will be 
gone. The first tile means the standard score for you. Any other tile adds 
two times to your score.

The standard score you get for a removed tile depends on some factors you can
change before the game begins:

<1> The speed of the tiles [1-8]. The faster, the harder to play and better 
for your score [±5 per unit]. During the game the speed increases 
automatically from time to time.

<2> Bonus-feature off/on (explained below) [±5]

<3> Malus-feature on/off (explained below) [±10]

<4> Tiles coming from all directions or from the left and right only [±10]


By configuring these factors you can modify the score you get for a tile from
35 to 90 making the game more [90] or less [35] hard.

If you enable the bonus-feature, bonus-pieces will appear and disappear on 
screen. You can collect them by moving your ship over them. Collecting four 
pieces of the same colour in a row conjures up a special incident:

<1> Four GREEN bonus-pieces mean an addition of 1000 to your score.

<2> Four RED ones give you an extra score of 10 whenever you hit a tile.

<3> Four BLUE ones have the same effect as <1> and <2> together.

<4> Four YELLOW ones wipe out all tiles immediately.


If you enable the malus-feature, collecting bonus-pieces of different colours
inverts the steering of your ship. Doing this again turns everythng back to 
normal. The malus-feature can only be enabled, if the bonus-feature is also 
active.

You can also play COLOURS with two players, if you have two Amigas connected
via a serial cable. The two-player game works like the Gameboy(TM) version of
Tetris(TM): Killing two or more tiles with one shoot means two or more tiles
more on your enemy's screen!

[IV] The Amiga implementation


There are two versions of COLOURS. One for 512k-Amigas and a second for any 
Amiga with at least one meg. of RAM. Their main difference is the soundtrack 
which is much better (and hungry for memory) with one meg. than with ½ meg.
Also, only 1 meg. Amigas can be serial-linked.

To load COLOURS just boot with your workbench and doubleclick on its icon.
Starting the game opens a title screen that can be left by pressing either 
the mouse- or joystickbutton. You can then choose to change the configuration
or play the game by clicking the mouse at the appropriate button.
Alternatively, you can press the joystickbutton to start playing. 
The "X" in the upper left corner of the screen is an eXit-button, as you 
might have guessed. If you choose to configure the game, a new screen will 
open with several buttons on it allowing you to change the tiles' speed, 
the bonus/malus-features and the tiles' directions.
One meg. Amigas can turn the serial-link on and off here by clicking on the
"(UN)DO SERIAL LINK" button on both systems.
"Save config" saves your changes to the configuration and starts the game. 
"Use config" does the same without saving.

When playing your spaceship is controlled with the joystick. Pressing the 
"P"-key pauses the game. Ctrl+"C" exits the program. Left Amiga+"A" switches
between the workbench and the game. (Now guess the language!)

When the game ends, you may enter your name in the highscore-table. Scores 
are automatically saved to disk.

If you encounter any kind of problem loading COLOURS, then make sure the re-
quired libraries are on your system disk and load the game via the CLI:
"cd colours" ; may vary, of course :-)
"colours.exe" ; for the normal version
"colours_512k.exe" ; for the 512k version

[V] Have fun!


If you still have questions, just ask me! I am always interested to hear from
you, no matter if you register or not! Needless to say that I don't mind 
getting bug-reports, suggestions for future versions or informaion about
tests in computer magazines from you.
