- loading campaign takes 65MB?
- somehow show move mask of enemy unit?
- byte order wird nicht beachtet in lgc-pg?
- warning signs for low ammo/fuel
(- mount/umount option for transporter)
- allow destruction of airfields/towns by level bombers
  or give suppression on the supply rate
- unit list window (with picture) to select a unit (goto unit)
- unmoved planes don't loose fuel
- shortcuts for map,toggle,gotounit,cancelmove,skipunit
- AI should let single units stay if well-entrechned
  (Bonus for having entrenchment which is added to the 
   current position but might be exceeded by a very good
   attack chance, flag capture etc)
- allow split of units?
- random landing of paratroopers?
- during AI move view is not toggled (can't see airplan damage)
- victory hexes are bad to see many units are arround
- message when reinforcements have arrived
- proper sound of jet engine aircrafts
- deploy does not work in 1024x768 (broken display)
- apply patch from bobby
- check bug: paratroops do not attack in crete and south france
- put the readme from guru to this
- scenario briefings for the campaign
- land units should not retreat when tacbombs attack
- artillery does rugged defense???
- airplanes do not return though out of fuel and in reach
  of an airfield (warsaw)
- whether enemy may attack a truck position must be checked not only
by getting the plain distance but by computing the required path 
to allow placement behind a closed front line
- trucks cannot pass rivers in bad weather and they don't try to take
the longer way around

**** Attack Bug ****
Also came across a bug - in Barbarossa scenario I tried to kill
enemy artillery - I didn't make it, it was left with 2 poits of
strength. Next round I attacked it with my tank, something
strange happened - enemy Art dissapeared, then it showed with str
15, and then my own tank was considered as enemy for my other
troops (it stopped movement, and its strength increased to 15) -
I think that somehow enemy artillery has swapped with him (but
graphics remained the same) - like in SF movies ;)
Could not reproduce this bug later.
**** END ****

- AI must protect own cities with units
- AI groups: implement execution order (artillery fire, bombers, 
  fighters, ground units, artillery movement)
- loop execution several times to move when a unit which is 
  handled later blocked the destination position
- tweak tactical action scores (are quite good already though)
- AI does not protect airborne units
- AI does not go for U-boots

??? France with 25/30 turns instead of 13/26 ???
??? when is the west beaten ???
