                 Astro Blox is (C)2013 Robert Szacki
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This archive contains Astro Blox - a logic game very similiar to SokoBan, 
but with more features. I will not say the features not to spoil the game! 
:-). The game offers attractive graphics and interesting puzzles.

The requirement is an Amiga with Kickstart 3.0 and AGA chipset. The game was
tested with success on Amiga 1200 with 68060 / 32MB Fast RAM.

Sounds and music are missing.

There are 6 playable levels in the archive with the increasing difficulty.

Everything is controlled by keyboard, here's the description:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title screen keys:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
S	- start game
Q	- quit game
(the rest like Hiscores and Passcode not yet implemented)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In-game keys:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
J	- move left
L	- move right
I	- move up
K	- move down
R	- restart level
Q	- quit level

I wish you to have fun and good luck with solving the puzzles!
