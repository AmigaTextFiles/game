@Node "Einleitung" "Introduction"

Introduction
------------

First I want to say a word about my bad English: I have no Problems
reading English Docs, but I noticed some Problems writing in English...


I always wanted to learn C, but I never came to the Point to begin
with it... But then I found a good start because I had to learn it for
my studies.

The Mastermind Algorithm was already finished, then I built a MUI GUI
around, and this is what came out at the end...

@Node "Systemanf" "System Requirements"

System Requirements
-------------------

* an 68020+
  If you need an 68000 Version write to @{" me " Link "Autor"},
  or make your own one with the included sources.

* @{" MUI " Link "MUI"} V3.3+
  It is recommanded to use always the latest Version.

* ImageButton.mcc (Aminet/dev/mui/MCC_ImgButton.lha)
  It is strongly recommanded to use Version 11.4+.

* WB 3.0+ because the Symbols in the Evaluation Column are loaded
  with Datatypes. It should also work with WB 2.04 but you can't see
  the Symbols then...

@Node "Spielregeln" "How to Play"

This part of the docs was written by Matthew O'Neill, mash@dingnet.demon.co.uk

The object of the game is to work out the computers 4 chosen symbols

these are either:

disk
network
ram
volume
harddisk
drawer

if this is your first game, then click on each symbol and choose one at random.
Now click on the guess button. You should see something pop up at the top. it will
tell you that this is the first try, then it tells you which symbols you chose,
and next it will give you an evaluation.

@{b}what the hell do the dots mean?!@{ub}

right, if you get 1 black dot, then this means one of your choices is completely
correct, so if you get 2 black dots then you will know that you have 2 correct
and so on. the only thing is though, it will not tell you which symbol is correct
(:P)

now if you get a white dot then you are half right. a white dot means you have
the correct symbol, but it is in the wrong place (so put it somewhere else!)

from these dots you should be able to work out the answer. but beware, you only
get 8 guesses at what it could be.

good luck!

note: each symbol can be used more than once!

@{b}more help@{ub}

Q: I have 4 white dots!, what now?

A: this means that you have all the correct symbols you need, the only problem is
that they are all in the wrong places! have a look at your previous attempts, if
you had a black dot somewhere, then this means that you did have a symbol in the
right, place, but you have since moved it. compare your current symbols with
that one and see which symbols are the same, it @{b}must@{ub} have been one of them.

Source
------

The Sources are included. You may use Parts of them in your own Projects,
but please mention me in your 'Credits' Section then.

If you have some Tips or Comments about the Code then please mail to @{" me " Link "Autor"}.

The Code was made with StormC V3.
To compile with StormC you have to install the stormamiga.lib-Packet (by Matthias
Henze, http://www.CyberdyneSystems.de/ ), or you must comment out the
Part '#ifdef __STORM__ ... #endif' in the Sources.

INLINE, REG and SAVEDS are defined in GUI.h and might have to be changed
depending on which compiler you use.

  Textlengths are different.

* The Symbols in the Evaluation Column aren't Transparent.

* The Symbols in the Symbols Column don't line up if they don't have
