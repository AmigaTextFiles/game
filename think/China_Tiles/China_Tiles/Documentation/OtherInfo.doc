Additional Information
======================

China Tiles has been tested on the following:-

  Machine                        Result
512k A500 wb1.3         Failed - Lack of memory
1MB A500 wb1.3          Worked O.K.
2MB A500+ wb2           Worked O.K.
1MB A600 wb2            Worked O.K.
2MB A1200 wb3           Worked, but intro graphics messed up. Bug now fixed.

The program should therefore work on all present and future Amigas,
provided they have sufficient memory. The only problem might arise with
new chip sets. The problem with the A1200 was (I think) due to a bug in
AMOS, where instead of dual playfield screens taking their colours from
the first and second 16 registers, they were all in sequence (e.g. instead
of using registers 0,1,16,17 for two 2 colour screens, it used registers
0,1,2,3). The A1200 fix simply remaps the colour allocations used by the
game, thus solving the problem.


Bugs
====

  The game has been extensively tested, so hopefully there are no bugs
present. However, I cannot confirm this, as AMOS seems to be infested with
bugs, so if anything goes wrong, blame the french person who wrote AMOS!
The find a pair routine in particular has given me immense trouble. I have
designed, proved and implemented at least three different algorythms for
this routine, and all of them failed apart from the current one. I tested
all of them in Archimedes Basic, and all worked fine.
  For some reason, AMOS gives all requestors to do with disks (e.g. disk
full, insert disk fred) about 12 times. I decided that leaving the user to
cancel a requestor a dozen times was a bit much, so I trapped some of
them. This seems to work, but is not a very good way to do it, so might
cause problems.


Hard Drive Installation
=======================

  China tiles can be installed to a hard drive quite easily. All you
need to do is copy the program, levels directory, default icon and
scroll text to the same directory and load the program from there.
If the program can`t find anything it needs, it will attempt to carry
on without them. It can manage without the icon and the scroll text, and
will ask you for the level file if it can`t find it, but it any libraries,
or the font are not available, then it will fail. These should be installed
into your boot partition, but the game itself can be anywhere.

I am assuming that you have made a full workbench installation on your hard
drive. if you have not, and the game fails, then try copying all the libs, c,
l and devs drawers from your workbench disk to your boot partition.

If I knew how to, I would write an installation script, but I haven`t the
foggiest how to use the installer. If I work it out, I will put a separate
installation routine on Aminet.
