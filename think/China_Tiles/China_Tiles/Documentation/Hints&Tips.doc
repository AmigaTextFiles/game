  There is no definite strategy to playing China Tiles, but here are some
hints that may help you to pick up the game.

  When you first start the game, the best thing to do is try to remove any
sets of tiles where all 4 are either free or at least visible. This cannot
hinder your progress and often aids you greatly.

  When you come to removing single pairs, try to remove a pair of tiles
where there is at least one of the set left and is preferably on the
bottom level. It is also helpful to try and keep track of all pairs
removed, as if you have already removed one pair of a set, you can safely
remove the other without risking trapping any tiles.

  If there are two or more of a certain type on the same line, or two next
to each other, try to remove at least one of these as soon as possible,
otherwise, you may finish up not being able to get at one of them.

  If you have to remove two of three tiles where they are all 'above
ground' then it is sometimes helpful to remove two, undo, then remove the
other one too see which would be the best to remove.

  Note, some levels are much harder than others. I find that the first
level in the default file is one of the easiest.



  If you wish to change the icon for the levels file, then you can use
iconed or a similar program to edit the Def_Icon file in the levels
directory. Note, this file must be called Def_Icon once you have edited
it. You may need to rename it as this, as some editors append .info
automatically.

  If your levels files get corrupted, there are duplicated in the backup
draw in the levels directory.
