How to load China Tiles
=======================

  I recommend that china tiles is loaded from workbench, preferably by
booting from the game disk.
To load it, simply click on the icon.
If you wish to load the game from the CLI, simply type the name of the
program (China_Tiles), after CDing to the directory containing the program.

How to play the game
====================

  When the game has loaded, you will be presented with an introduction
screen. From this screen, you can either quit by clicking the right mouse
button at the top of the screen, or start the game by clicking the left
mouse button.
  Once you have started the game, you will be presented with a selection
of levels. You can load more levels by clicking on the load button, of
edit the levels by selecting the level editor button. To start the game,
click on the level you wish to play.
  The game will then fill the level with random tiles and show an enlarged
3D version of the level.
  To play the game, scan the available tiles to find matching pairs of
tiles. These can only be removed if they have a space to one or both
sides. To remove a pair, simply click on them both and if they can be
removed, they will be. Continue removing tiles until they have all been
removed, or there are no more pairs available. The game is now complete,
although if there are tiles left, you can use the find and cheat options
to remove them all. If you decide to try again, click on the quit button
to return to the intro.
