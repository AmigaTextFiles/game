Level Editor Instructions:-
=========================

  When you first enter the level editor, you will see the 15 loaded levels
at the top of the screen, several buttons and a grid at the bottom. The first
level will be highlighted, and the grid will contain an enlarged version of
it. The 5 buttons to the right of the grid determine how high the piles of
tiles will be. You place a pile of tiles by simply clicking in the grid
where you want them. Blank means that the pile will be erased.
  To select a level to edit, simply click in one of the 15 boxes at the top
of the screen. If they contain a level, it will be zoomed into the grid. If
you want to erase a level, select it, then click on CLEAR. A requester will
be displayed for you to confirm your decision, in case you click clear by
accident. RESET clears all level definitions in memory. This also has a
confirm requester.
  If you want to edit another levels file, simply click on load and select
the required one, then click OK to confirm you choice. QUIT exits without
loading any levels.
  Once you have selected the level you want to edit, or a blank level to
create one of your own, you simply place piles of tiles in the grid. A proper
level should have 120 tiles in it, you can create levels with less, but
you can't play them. Once you have edited or created all the levels in
memory you want, click on SAVE to save them to disk. A file requester
will appear asking you for a name. You can either enter a new name, or click
on an old file then OK to replace the old definitions with the new ones.
You don't have to save the levels to be able to play them, but once you
exit the game, or load other levels, they will be wiped unless you have
saved them. As ever, QUIT exits back to level editor without saving the
levels.
  If you want a preview of what a level will look like in the game, simply
click on SHOW. This will display the level with random tiles. Once you have
finished examining the level, click the left mouse button to return to the
editor.
  If you get stuck, simply click on HELP for another look at the instructions
for the editor.
  With the editor, you can define easy levels, hard levels or just plain
impossible levels, and you can easily give your friends a copy of your levels
by copying them the levels file.

It is important to remember that no changes are made to the level definitions
stored on disk unless the save option is selected. The level may appear to
have changed, but unless you have saved it once you quit and try to reload
the game, the level will no longer be available.

Have fun!
