China Tiles History.

Version 0 > 0.70

These version were development versions.

Version 0.75

The game appeared to be fully working... until I found a bug in the
find routine.

Version 0.80

Find bug fixed, and a custom file requester implemented.

Version 0.83

File requester tidied up and a slight bug with the string gadget fixed.
Major problem found. I recently got a Hard drive, and on trying to install
the game found that it would only work with if an install was done before
the program was run. I completely changed the way the data files were
loaded. This decreased the flexibility, but made the game easily installable.

Version 1.0

First public release. All known bugs and problems fixed.
