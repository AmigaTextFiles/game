                                 Help!!!!
                                 --------

The following is a list of possible problems and how to solve them. If
your problem is not mentioned here, then read the main documentation
again, and if you are still stuck, drop me a line, and I will try to solve
it as quickly as possible.


What can I do at the intro screen?
==================================

  Well, you have one of three choices. You can click the left mouse button
to start the game, Click the Right Mouse Button on the top line of the
screen to QUIT, or simply read the scroll text until your eyeballs start to
wrap around in your head.


Once I have started the game, what do I do next?
================================================

  When you click the left mouse button on the intro screen, a level selection
screen appears. This shows the levels currently loaded in miniature form.
If you like the look of any of these levels, simply click on the one you
have picked, and this will take you to the game proper. 
  If none of the levels tickle your fancy, then you can click on the 'Load
Levels' button. A file requester will pop up, asking you to select a new 
levels file. If you see a file you like, simply double click on it, or click
once then click OK.
  If you can't find any levels files, or none of the them take your fancy,
then click on QUIT to return you to the level select screen. Don't worry if
you click on the wrong file, as the program checks to make sure you have
picked a levels file before it loads it.
  If you want to design your own levels, then simply click on the 'LEVEL
EDITOR' button.


How do I remove a pair of tiles once I have located them?
=========================================================

  All you have to do to remove tiles is simply click on them. When you click
on the first tile, a small arrow will appear in the top left corner of it.
If this does not appear, then either you missed the tile, or the tile
cannot be selected. When you click on the second tile, both will disappear.
Again, if nothing happens, try clicking on the tile again. If it still 
doesn't respond, then it isn't free.


How do I use the FIND function?
===============================

  Simply click on the FIND button in the game. The computer will search all
available tiles and find the first 2 free tiles that match. It then 
automatically removes them. If no pairs exist, then nothing happens when
you press this button.


How do I Cheat?
===============

  Well, you shouldn't really have to cheat, but if you get completely stuck,
click on the cheat button. This activates the cheat mode. Now, simply click
on any tile, free or not, and the computer will find its pair and remove
both. You can then resume play as normal. If you decide not to cheat, then
simply click the right mouse button to cancel cheat mode.


Help! I can't remember how to play the game!
============================================

  Well, first give up the hypnosis classes, then click on the HELP button.
This gives some helpful instructions. Once you have refreshed your Swiss
cheese, click the left mouse button to return to the game.


Oh *!%$, I've removed the wrong pair!
=====================================

  First, sober up a bit, then click on UNDO. This returns the board to the
situation before your last move. Note, this only works for one move, and
cannot be used after a FIND or CHEAT operation.


I can't see any more pairs, Find can't either and I don't want to Cheat.
========================================================================

  First, full marks for honesty. When no accessible pairs are left, the
game is over. Once you get to this point, click on QUIT. This returns you
to the intro, from where you can do what you like.


I want to load some new levels, but I can't find any! Help!
===========================================================

  The most likely reason for this is that you have either booted from a
different disk, or copied the game to hard disk or similar and forgotten
to copy the levels as well. If you click the Right Mouse Button on the main
window if the file requester, a list of devices appears. You can now click on
any of these to try and find the levels files. They should be in the Levels
directory on the program disk, but if you have copied the game to HD or
similar, they might be anywhere! If you can't find any levels files, then it
is likely they have been deleted. If this is the case, you will have to 
create some more with the editor. Note, if you select a file which is not
a levels file by mistake, the program will simply reject it and you can
load another.


I have tried to save some levels to disk, but the program complains.
====================================================================

  The most probable reason for this is the disk you are saving to is Write
protected, or has been removed from the drive. To write enable a disk, slide
the black tag in the bottom corner so that is covers the hole.
  If this doesn't work, then either the disk is damaged, or your disk 
drive is defective.
  To exit the Disk Error requestor, simply click a mouse button.
  Note:- Don't try to save over the default levels file, as this is write
protected as the program needs this to run.


The program says it can't find the default levels! What can I do?
=================================================================

  If this happens, a file requester will appear prompting you to select
an alternative levels file. Any levels file can be used, just click
on one then OK.
  This also tells you that something has happened to your default levels
file. Either it is missing or in the wrong directory. You can either 
rename another levels file as 'CT_LEVELS' (without quotes) or if it
does exist, move it to the root directory of the boot disk.


When I click on a level to play it, nothing happens. Why?
=========================================================

  The level you have picked does not have 120 tiles in it, therefore it
cannot be played. You will have to edit it so that it does have 120 tiles
in it.


The game gets so far then crashed out! What's wrong?
====================================================

  The most probable reason for any seeming inexplicable crash is that the
game either cannot find a file it needs, or a file has become corrupted.
Check all files against the list below, and if none are missing, contact
me and tell me what you were doing when the program crashed, because you
have probably found a bug! (What? A bug in MY code? Come off it, bugs only
happen to the John Whelans of this world!)


Disk Error messages:-
===================

  Here is a list of the cryptic error messages that may occur when saving
levels to disk, and what to do about them.

    Error                         Cause/Action

Device not available.    The disk/device specified is not connected to
                         your computer! This can be caused if you remove a
                         disk before the data is saved. To correct, simply
                         specify a new file/drive/device and try again.

Disk full.               There is no free storage space on the disk. Try
                         another disk, preferable a blank one.

Disk not validated.      Either AmigaDOS cannot find a disk validator, or
                         the disk has become corrupt. Copy a fresh disk   
                         validator from workbench (Found in the L drawer)
                         or run the disk through FixDisk or similar.      
                         Note, WB2 and above don`t need a disk validator.

Disk is write protected. The slider on the bottom left corner of the disk
                         needs to be covering the hole before data can be 
                         saved to the disk. Move the slider and retry.

File is write protected. You have tried to save over a file which is
                         protected against this. Simply use a different   
                         file name to save the data.

I/O error.               AAAAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!! Your disk is probably
                         corrupt! Try again, and if the same happens, run
                         the disk through FixDisk or a similar program to
                         try and recover it. Note, I don't recommend using
                         DiskDoctor, as it is more likely to trash your
                         disk than fix it.

Illegal File Name.       The name you have used is not allowed under      
                         AmigaDOS. Try again with another name. Note, file
                         names generally have to start with a letter.

Not an AmigaDOS disk.    The disk you are trying to access has not been 
                         formatted for use under AmigaDOS. Try another.
