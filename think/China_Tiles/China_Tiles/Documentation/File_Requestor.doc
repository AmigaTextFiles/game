How to use the file requestor.
==============================

  China Tiles was originally going to use the standard AMOS file
requestor, but I decided that this was not good enough for my program, as
well as being difficult for beginners, so I wrote my own. 

  There are two main displays on the requestor, the left hand one, which
shows a list of files and directories in the current path, and the right
hand one which shows all the available devices (disks, assigns etc.)

  To select a file, simply click on the name. If you double click on the
name, then the file will be automatically chosen for you. If you click on
a file with the right mouse button, a check will be made to determine if
the selected file is a levels file.

  To select a new directory, simply click on the name. Note, directory
names are prefixed with a star. To step back one directory, click the
parent button.

  To select a new disk or device, click on the name in the right hand
list. The directory of this device will automatically be loaded.

  If you wish to type in a file or directory name by hand, simply click on
the bar showing the name. A cursor will appear and you can edit the name.
Special key combinations are:- 

   Shift-Backspace        Delete from cursor to start of line.
   Shift-Del              Delete from cursor to end of line.
   Shift-Cursors          Move to start or end of the name.

  As usual, OK selects the file name, and Cancel quits without selecting a
file.
