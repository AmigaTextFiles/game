Introduction
============

  This game is basically just a vastly improved version of Mahjong. If you
have played any other version of the game (Dragon Tiles, China Challenge,
Shanghi, Tiles etc) then this version plays exactly the same as these.
  For those who don't know how to play, and are too impatient to read the
full docs (This is recommended for complete beginners), here is a basic
overview of how to play the game.

  When you have selected a level, a board will appear with 120 tiles on
it. It is split into 4 layers, each a different colour to aid
identification. You simply have to match pairs of tiles. When you find a
pair, click on them and they are removed automatically. Tiles can only be
selected if the space directly to one side of them (Left or Right) is
clear. There can still be tiles on the neighbouring stack, as long as they
are not on the same level.
  Quit returns you to the intro, Find locates and removes a pair of free
tiles, Help gives you some instructions and Cheat allows you to remove a
pair even if they are not free. To cheat, simply press cheat then click on
a tile to remove it and its pair.
