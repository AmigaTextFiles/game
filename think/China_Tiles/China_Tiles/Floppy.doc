To make a self-booting floppy, you need the following files:-

C:Assign
Libs:Diskfont.library
Fonts:Swiss.font
      Swiss/36

as well as the standard system files needed for workbench to load
from a floppy. If you are inexperienced in making self-booting
disks, I recommend you make a copy of your workbench disk then delete
the contents of the System, Utilities, Tools and Prefs directories.
Then copy the China Tiles executable, level files and (if you wish)
documentation files to the root directory of the disk, then copy
swiss.font and swiss/36 to the fonts directory. Rename the disk
`China_Tiles' and change the startup-sequence to:-

SetPatch
LoadWB
EndCLI

If there still isn`t space on the disk, start by deleting some of the
c commands such as ed, edit, only remember to leave assign, loadwb,
assign, and for wb1.3 and below, endcli.
If this doesn`t work, then either boot from a full workbench or contact
me for more help.

If you do make your own self-booting disk, remember that for the game
uses a ramdisk, so for wb1.3 and below, you need the ramdisk files,
ram-handler and ramdisk.device (or equivalent).

If possible, try to solve any disk problems with snoopdos before you
contact me.
