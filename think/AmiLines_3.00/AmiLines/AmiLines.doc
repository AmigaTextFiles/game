AmiLines is a nice little game meant to amuse you for
anywhere from 3 minutes to 6 days (straight).


Introduction ******************************************************************

AmiLines is a simple game. It is played by one player, so there is
only one winner :-) You play for fun and against the high score. It has
been inspired by well known game - Colorlines, written for DOS by Olga
Demina, Igor Ivkin and Gennady Denisov back at 1992.

In 2000 Roman Merzlyakov wrote a original version for KDE. Roman
Roazilov added to it a cool povray generated animation. Later in
2001 he ported it to KDE 2 and made it conform to the KDE games standard.


Using AmiLines ****************************************************************

The main rules of the game is as simple as possible: you move (using
mouse) marbles from cell to cell and build lines (horizontal, vertical
or diagonal).  When a line contains 5 or more marbles - they are removed
from the field and your score grows. After each of your turns computer
drops three more marbles onto the field.

The increase in score depends on the amount of erased marbles
and if AmiLines shows the next balls.  The increase will be smaller if
you use the information of what's next.


More AmiLines features ********************************************************

AmiLines is wonderful in that it will allow you to kill 5 minutes
while you wait for that program to compile. Or, if nothing
else, it will allow you to kill 5 minutes.


Command Reference *************************************************************
