@node about "About Eor"

    Eor is based on the game Xor from the old 8bits machines.It
    was really a very great game. Not a shoot'em up but something
    you played with your head. But it never appeared on Amiga. Now
    this is done. This version is a nearly clone of it. The levels
    have been ripped from my old plans and I've done the rest of
    the job with my memory.
    Hope you'll enjoy.

@node controlling "How to control the game"

        You  can control your man with a joystick in port #2.
          Fire makes you change your hero.
          
        You can play with the cursor keys.
          Return makes you change your hero.
        
        M       This show you the parts of the map you've got.
        
        ESC     Stops the game in play, and quits the game if you
                are on the menu page.

@node purpose "What you have to do"

       You have 15 terrifics levels to complete. You can play them
       in the order you want.
       You play two persons. They need to get all the masks and then
       they must go out.
       It's simple.
       In fact, there's some objects which have their own properties
       and it's not so simple.
       And you have to exit before you've done 2000 moves.
       The puzzles are really mindbreaking.
       It's up to you.
