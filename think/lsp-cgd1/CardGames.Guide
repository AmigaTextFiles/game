To load a new carddeck into CardGames Deluxe is easy. Click on button 'Cardset'
in the options window and a new Window will open. In this window you can select
a cardset file. Now click on the desired cardset you want to load. A double
click will start the loading immediately.

Remember that you can't use a AGA cardset on a ECS Amiga. It will not warn you
if it is a AGA cardset. It will load a AGA cardset and tries to open a AGA
screen. If this fails, you can retry or load a other cardset, selecting 'exit'
will exit from the programm and lose the current game.

These 'cardset' files must be the REKO cardset format. You can recognize a REKO
cardset when the filename ends with '.REKO'. There are more than 90 different
cardsets. You can also make your own cardset(s). See the 'REKO.doc' or 
'REKO.Guide' included on any version of Klondike from @{"REKO-Productions" LINK "RekoProductions"}.

@TOC "MAIN"

Begin by placing a bet using the 'Bet $1' or higher buttons. Push on button
'Hit' when done. A maximum of 5 coins is allowed. Both the Dealer (CPU) and you
will receive 2 cards. The cards of the Dealer is shown above, your hand is
shown below on the left of the screen. Only one card is visible of the Dealer.
If the card visible is a Ace, then you can place a insurance bet (see below).

You must count the cards, which is done for you by the computer, displayed in
the small window just above your hand. Face cards are counted as a 10 and a
Ace can count as 1 or 11 (your choice). You must try to beat the Dealer's hand
by asking for cards until your hand is as close to 21 points. Go over 21 and
you lose.

The Dealer will give you a set of options depending on your cards.

Hit....... Get another card.

Stand..... Stop with the cards you have.

Double.... Double current bet, receive one new card and Stand.

Split..... If you have dealt two matching cards, you may split the pair and
           play two separate hands. This allows you to win double, lose double
           or break even. Splitting is not possible if you don't have enough
           money to place a second bet or if you are playing the second hand.
           If you split two aces, then both hands will receive only one card.

Insurance. A window will open, if the open card of the dealer is a Ace. You'll
           be asked if you want to place a insurence bet, which is the a half
           of your original bet. The Dealer will check if he has BlackJack, if
           so, then the game is over. If you have placed a insurence bet,
           you'll receive two-to-one payoff on your insurence bet. If the
           dealer doesn't have BlackJack, the game will continue and you'll
           lose the insurence bet.

When you are finished, the dealer will show his cards. The dealer must draw
more cards until his hand is worth at least 17 points and must stand when his
hand equals 17 points or more. If your hand beats the dealer's hand, you win
the game and collect a payoff of two-to-one on your bet. If the dealer goes
over 21 (breaks), you win. A BlackJack (Ace + Face Card) paysoff five-to-two.

Introduction to CardGames Deluxe v1.0 By Logic System Productions.

CardGames Deluxe contains two games, BlackJack and VideoPoker. Both these card
games are fully compatible with the REKO cardsets made for Klondike 1/2/3 by
@{"REKO Productions" LINK "RekoProductions"}. There more than 90 cardsets going around, so you won't have
any trouble getting new cardsets.

CardGames Deluxe is programmed in 100% assembler, 100% system friendly, 100%
multitasking, and 100% legally programmed (and hopyfully 100% bug free?), it
took me more 5 months to make this. So please consider a @{"ShareWare" LINK "ShareWare"} fee!

This game only supports MED music format modules. Due to a bug in the
'PT.Library' which crashes (!) the system  to many times, it can't support
Protracker music modules. If you still want to play Protracker Modules, then
you can do 2 things:

1. Use a music module converter programm or use Octamed to load and save it as
   a MED music module.

2. Turn off the music in CardGames Deluxe and use a system friendly music
   replayer on the background.

This programm is fully compatible with Amigas with ECS or AGA graphics chips.
The programm has been tested on a Amiga 3000 (KS 3.1/2mb Chip (graphics)/3.5mb
Fast(Other)), a Amiga 1200 (KS 3.0/2mb Chip and other memory configurations)
and on a A4000 (KS3.0/2mb Chip/8mb Other). I haven't been able to test the game
on KS2.1 (V37), but it should work (in theory?). 


Required minimum configuration (theoraticly, not tested!):

KickStart 2.1 (V37) or higher.
68020 or higher Proccessor.
1.4mb memory (at least 1mb CHIP (graphics) memory(!)) without music.

ECS Graphics Chip (Maximum of 16 colors)
or
AGA Graphics Chip (Maximum of 256 colors and HAM8 cardsets)


Recommended:

2mb Chip.
1mb+ Fastmem.
A HardDisk.
A MultiSync Monitor


Required Libaries:

Asl.library V37+ (V38.33 included, on disk1 in the 'libs' directory)
Medplayer.library V3+ (V5.2 included, on disk1 in the 'libs' directory)


NOTE: This game can be run from disks, a HardDisk is not needed.


Included Cardsets:

Standard_ECS.REKO 16 color version. (Thankx to @{"REKO Productions" LINK "RekoProductions"})
DragonsLair_ECS.REKO 16 color version.
DragonsLair_AGA.REKO HAM8 (AGA ONLY) version.


Included Music:

House Kraft.med (164562 bytes) by @{"Marco van Steen" LINK "MarcoVanSteen"}.
Low Transe.med (72194 bytes) by @{"Marco van Steen" LINK "MarcoVanSteen"}.
