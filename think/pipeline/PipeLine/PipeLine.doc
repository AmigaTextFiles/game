    1. Introduction

    PipeLine is an thinking game for one  player  with	the  objective	to
    create an closed network of pipes.


    2. System Requirements

    PipeLine works on any Amiga with  Kickstart  1.3  or  above.  (it  was
    tested only on a 2000B with A2630)
    PipeLine requires the "diskfont.library" and the  font  "topaz"  at  a
    size of 11 points ! (as far as i know, this is part of  the  workbench
    distribution)
    PipeLine requires about 170 KByte disp-space.
    PipeLine can be run from a CLI or from the Workbench.
    Pipeline gets copied by copying the whole drawer.
    The files are:
    - PipeLine: the game-program
    - PipiLine.levels: the level-data
    - PipiLine.doc: this doc-file
    - SAMPLES.RAW: the data for the sound-effects
    - Editor: the level-editor
    Who wants/has to give up the sound-effects for any reason, may  delete
    the file SAMPLES.RAW. The program nevertheless runs. But please  don't
    copy the program in this crippled form !


    3. Objective of the Game

    The player has the task to create ONE closed object out of a given set
    of tiles in  a  limited  space.  All  ends	of  branches  have  to	be
    terminated with half straights. As soon as such an object is built and
    all tiles are used up, the level is solved.
    The levels differ in the size of the playfield and	in  the  stock	of
    piles.


    4. Usage

    4.1. Starting the program

    PipeLine can be run from the Workbench or from a CLI.
    A parameter can be given, which states the (name of the) level-file to
    be used.
    If starting via Workbench, you have to ensure, that the level-file	is
    in the same drawer as PipeLine because else the sound-data-file is not
    found (which should not cause a crash, either).

    4.2. The Menu

    Here you can choose the wanted level, start the game itself  or  leave
    the program.
    To select another level-file, first type 'F' or click the gadget under
    the text "level-file:". Then enter the name of your level-file in  the
    string-gadget.
    With '+' and '-' or the equivalent gadgets you can now choose a  level
    of the current levelfile. The name gets displayed at the bottom border
    of the screen.
    With Escape you can leave the program (after a security request).
    With all other keys you start the chosen level.

    4.3. The Game itself

    At the bottom of the screen you see all possible elements,	which  you
    have to set in the raster in the area above. Under each element  there
    is the number, how often it still has to  be  used.  If  there  is	no
    number, this element is not (anymore) available. One of  the  elements
    is framed. That means, you are  going  to  set  this  element  in  the
    playfield. In the  playfield  there  is  also  most  often	one  field
    framed. It shows you, where you are going to set or remove an element.

    Usage with Mouse:

    You can set the chosen element in the playfield  by  pointing  at  the
    wanted field and clicking the left mousebutton. If you click the right
    mousebutton, the field is cleared if it was filled,  else  the  chosen
    element is set, too.
    If the last element of one kind is set, a  new  kind  of  elements	is
    chosen automatically.
    If you point at one  of  the  elements  at	the  bottom  and  click  a
    mousebutton, this element is chosen as the current element -  as  far,
    as available.
    If you see that your creation had to grow  over  the  borders  of  the
    playfield, maybe one of the four scrolling-gadgets at the right top of
    the screen can help you. With them you can shift all of the  playfield
    one field in the arrows direction. Caution: if  something  leaves  the
    playfield, its lost (of course the tiles are counted to  the  stock  -
    else you could simplify the level as you want).

    Usage with keyboard:

    The frame in the playfield and around  the	element  to  set  act  are
    cursors.
    The cursor-keys and the keys 1-4 and 6-9 on  the  numeric  keypad  are
    equivalent (1,3,7,9 encode diagonal directions).
    The playfield-cursor is moved  with  the  cursor-keys,  the  "element-
    cursor" with shift and the  horizontal  cursor-keys  or  Tab  (to  the
    right) and shift-Tab (to the left).
    With Return, Enter or keypad-5 you set a tile, with Backspace  or  Del
    you take it back; with Space you clear the field or  set  the  current
    element if the field was empty.
    With Escape you can quit the game.
    If you don't change the settings in the menu and restart the game, you
    can continue to play: What you did before,	is  not  cleared  in  this
    case.
    The scrolling is done with Alt and the cursor-keys.


    5. Designing own Levels

    The program "Editor" looks pretty much  like  the  game  program.  The
    usage is nearly identical apart from  the  fact,  that  you  get  your
    paintings saved and may (nearly) any number of tiles of any kind.
    Now the differences / extensions in the usage:
    - Menu:
      - There is a new string-gadget "level-name" where you have to  enter
	the name of the level to be designed bevor you start to paint it.
      - You can append a level to an existing file.
      - Names of not yet existing level-files are accepted.
    - Editor (very similair to the game in the game-program)
      - You start without tile-stock; the display at  the  bottom  of  the
	screen counts the used tiles.
      - You can change the size of the playfield.
	The Control and a cursor-key add a row/column at the corresponding
	end of the playfield; Control & Shift and a  cursor-key  delete  a
	row/column at the corresponding end of the playfield. The same	do
	the four scrolling-gadgets without/with Shift.
      - As soon as you have "drawn" an allowed igure, you are asked if you
	want to overwrite the level.
	Caution: This question is not repeated at leaving the editor !
    It is not possible to modify levels designed before because  only  the
    number of used tiles, not their arrangement is  saved  to  the  level-
    file.

    A level-file may contain any number of  levels.  Seperate  level-files
    can be linked to a single one with a CLI-command like
	"join <level_1> ... <level_n> <level_1_to_n>"

    Level-files of the PC-version can simply be used.
    The other way around you have  to  obey  that  the	PC-version  allows
    playfield of one row less height !


    6. Legal Stuff

    I do not guarantee full functionality of PipeLine. The author takes no
    liability for any damage caused by the programs to the player/user	or
    the computer.
    PipeLine is FreeWare. It may be copied freely as far as the files  are
    copied unchanged and complete. New levels may be added,  but  only	as
    FreeWare.
    Noone may profit from distributing PipeLine.
    I approve improvements of the  game,  portations  to  other  computer-
    systems and further implementations on the	amiga,	as  far  as  these
    include innovations and the program remains FreeWare. Please write	to
    me, if you have further questions.

		      don't want to wast money on postage, do we ?]
	  [but i'll get angry if i find out that the level can't be
	   solved !]
	- suggestions for improvements
	- Bug-Reports. Please as precise as possible:
	  - How can i (the programmer) produce the error
	  - How does it show (What tellls PipeLine / what a nonsense
	    happens / Guru number / ...)
	  - Type of amiga, CPU, memory
	  - Version-number of Kickstart, Workbench

	- donations (remember: PipeLine is FreeWare !)
	  [is there somewhere a 4000 with 68060 getting dusty ?!?]
