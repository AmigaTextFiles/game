........:: BINIAX ::........
        version  1.2
 A game by Jordan Tuzsuzov

..:: Introduction ::..

 BINIAX is a logical game with respect of time - there is no need of deep thought to master the game, you only need the right simple solution in the right time. Train your brain in background :)

..:: What about 1.2 ::..

 Why version 1.2 is so important ? After few months of playing and feedback, in version 1.2, for the first time since the first BINIAX prototype, the game ballance is changed. Now the game is more dynamic at the beginning and *possible* to play later.

* BINIAX IS AN ORIGINAL GAME, IT'S NOT A CLONE OR REMAKE. *

..:: How to play ::..

 You control the box with the element inside. You can move around the field on empty spaces. You can also remove pairs of elements, if you have the same element as one of the pair. When you remove a pair your element becomes the other element of the pair and the score is increased;
 The gaming field scrolls down slowly (increasing the speed with your progress) and your goal is to stay as long as possible on the field. Remember, that if you can not take the pair in front of you, the scrolling will move your block down !

..:: Controls ::..

 Space bar acts different in different cases. Pressing at the splash screen will choose option from the menu. During the game, space bar acts as "Back to menu" key. It also means CONTINUE when the game is over. If you go to the menu during the game, the game is automatically saved. "Continue" in the menu means load the saved game.
 Arrow keys are used to move the cursor during the game or to choose between the options in the menu.
