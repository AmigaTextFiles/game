BINIAX 1.1
How to build...

- WINDOWS :

You should install SDL and SDL_Mixer include files in folder called \SDLincludes and lib files in \SDLlib.
Open the DSP file with MVS 6.0 or newer and just build the project.
To run the game you need the result biniax.exe and SDL.dll + SDL_Mixer.dll. Place them in one folder and copy the \data folder to the same place. Run. Enjoy!

- UNIX, LINUX, BSD, MACOS :

Type "make" in the console, when you are in the root of the Biniax source. You need the developer libs of SDL 1.2 (libsdl1.2) and SDL_mixer (libsdl-mixer1.2)
