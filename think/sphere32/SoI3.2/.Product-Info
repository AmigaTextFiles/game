.description
Spheres of Influence is a game of galactic colonization for 1 to 8
players; AmigaDOS 3.0+ and 1 meg CHIP + 1 meg FASTRAM required. This
game involves at least one human (up to eight) and optionally up to
7 computer players in a struggle to colonize and control a segment of
a galaxy. Players must balance the 16 resources and 12 industries in
an effort to build space vessels which may be anything from drones
with manly weapons to massive transports and battle stations. An almost
unlimited ability to design these vessels is included. The game is rich
in detail, and handicapping allows for many players of considerably
varied skills to play with an equal chance.
