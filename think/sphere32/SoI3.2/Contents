Spheres of Influence 3.0 ©1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, Ed Musgrove,
All Rights Reserved, is a strategy game of galactic
colonization (for one to eight players one of which
must be human.) This version requires at least one
meg of CHIP and 1 meg of FASTRAM, requires AmigaDOS 3.0 or
higher, and a hard drive or hi-density floppy drive. This
is a DEMO version--ALL game features are fully accessable, but
only 100 turns are allowed. I am asking a $20 registration
fee for an uncrippled two disk set. Registered users will
receive the most recent version for the cost of media,
postage, and handling.
