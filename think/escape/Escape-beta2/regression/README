roughtest.esx - tests bug from "rough.esx" where two panels
		with their destination set to the floor between
		them causes a block pushed over the configuration
		to duplicate itself.

selfpanel.esx - When pushing a block onto a panel that targets
		itself, that block should disappear. This is
		used in the level "don't touch".

elecbug.esx - If the target of a panel is electric, and we push
        a gold block off the panel into that electric, we need
        to set the alternate world to electric, not the current
        world.

sdead.esx - Starting dead. Since the rule is that we check for
        death or winning *after* each move, it is safe to start
        in the path of a laser.

spheretest.esx - Tests various things about spheres and colored
        panels.
