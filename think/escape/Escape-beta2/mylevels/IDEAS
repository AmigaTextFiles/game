The Right Way?

Have a level where the solution is to only move to
the right. (transporters, etc.)


False Dichotomy.


Have a situation like this:

#########
#o       G
#         #
#        o#
###########

it should not be possible to press both panels.

shooting the gold block at either one of the choices
ultimately results in a non-solution, even though
they are both tantalizing, and both together would
form a solution. (Instead the player must do something
else, like not push the gold block at all, or push it
upwards)
