Amigatration is my adaption of Concentration.  It will
run on any Amiga with at least 100K of Chip and 50K of
fast ram free (or 150K of Chip).

This is a cute little game, but of course I assume no
responsibility if it blows up your computer (and all
the other regular disclaimer crap).

The following files should be included:
	AmigaTration
    AmigaTration.info
	AmigaTration.screen
	about.brush
	brushes.dat
	AmigaTration.doc   (This file)


To play, simply load the game.  It is fairly self
explainatory, but I will explain anyway.

No. Players x
    Click this button to change the number of players
    from 1-4.

New
    This button starts a new game.

Size
    This button changes the size (and dificulty) of the
    game.  It ranges from 4x4 to 12x12.

About
    This button tells about the game and me.

Quit
    Guess what, this quits.


If you would like to design your own tiles, or modify
mine, you can do so with DPaint or another paint program.
First load the brushes.dat file as a picture.  Then change
and add to it as you wish.  You must keep the first two
tiles the same, these are the blank board and the covered
picture image.  If you add more tiles, you must add enough
that there is a rectangle of pictures.  In other words,
there can not be a partial line of pictures.  The program
will automatically detect how many pictures there are and
use them.  When you are done and want to save, you must
cut the pictures out and save them as a brush.  It MUST be
a multiple of 16 wide (the size of the pictures) and an
even number of pictures high.

BUGS:
   The only known bug is that the screen may be thrashed
   due to text if you are not using an 8x8 font as your
   default.
   Also, occasionaly for some unknown reason the computer
   will not notice when you finish your game.  This doesn't
   really cause a problem, since you can just start a new
   game anyway.
