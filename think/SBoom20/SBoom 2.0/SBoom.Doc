====================
= PLAYING THE GAME =
====================

The GOAL of the game is to discover all the hidden mines
in  the  shortest  time possible. You are presented with a
minefield  with a known number of mines shown in the top of
the  window. 
The games starts when you click on the "GO" button.
Then the "GO" button becomes a "NO" button and you can abort
by clicking again on this button. 
The Timer situated in the upper-right begins when
the first square of the minefield is discovered.


MENUS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE WHEN YOU ARE NOT PLAYING A GAME.

At the Beginning of a new game, you get the right number of flags
equal to the number of bombs to find in the Minefield.
The timer Starts when the FIRST SQUARE is discover.

To reveal a square, use LEFT MOUSE BUTTON over any of the
unrevealed  squares.  This  will  lead  to  one of three possible
cases:
    
    1)  The  square  is  blank  and the computer performs a flood
        fill of all the surround blanks.

    2)  A  number in the range of 1 to 8 appears. This means that
        there  is  that  number  of  mines  to  be  found  in the
        surrounding eight squares.

    3)  A bomb appears. You stepped on a mine and the game is over.

By logical deduction and sometimes with a bit of luck, mines can
be located.

When you have located a Bomb, use the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON to put a flag.
If later you discover you were wrong and there is no bomb under the
square marked with a flag, just press the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON again 
and the flag will disappear.



==========================
= MENUS and GAME OPTIONS =
==========================

* PROJECT

      ** HIGHSCORES    : Show the first ten scores classed by Time, HighScore
                         Table unique relative to SIZE, LEVEL and EXPERT.
                         That means 4*3*2=24 different Highscore Tables.

      ** ABOUT         : Bring to front a Requester with informations about me.
                         
      ** TCHAO         : Same use that the Window Close Gadget.



* MINEFIELD

      ** SIZE (Size of the Minefield)

              *** Nothing : 10*10 squares.

              *** Cool    : 16*14 squares.

              *** OKay    : 22*18 squares.

              *** MAX     : Find the Biggest Minefield according to your
                            WorkBench Resolution and your SQUARE RATIO.

              *** CUSTOM  : Use the size defined by user.


      ** LEVEL (Percentage of Bombs in the Minefield)

              *** NOVICE  : 10 %

              *** HOT     : 20 %

              *** MASTER  : 30 %

              *** CUSTOM  : Use the percentage of Bombs defined by user.


      ** EXPERT  : Way to inform player of surround squares.
                   This mode activated (activated by default), the number
                   printed on the selected square with the left mouse button
                   can range from 1 to 8 because it checks the top,
                   bottom, left and right but also the four corners.
                   If you disable this option, it will check only the Top,
                   bottom, left and right, BUT NOT the four corners of the
                   selected square, and then the number printed range only
                   from 1 to 4.
                   If you used to play the common and classic mode EXPERT,
                   as on the PeeCees, you will find that this mode needs
                   more thinking time cause you don't use to play this mode
                   whereas it is a lot easier.


* SETTINGS

      ** AUTOSAVE  (Save Highscores & All Menu Config to Disk)

              *** At End  : After using the Window Close Gadget or
                            "Tchao" Menu to quit the Game.

              *** In Game : After Each NEW HighScore.

              *** Never   : More Explanations ?

              *** Now     : ?


      ** SQUARE RATIO (Pixel Ratio on the screen= Width:Height )

              *** 2:1     : Hires, etc...

              *** 2:2     : Lowres, Hires Interlaced, etc...


      ** DEFINE CUSTOM    : Allow to Redefine Custom Size (Width & Height)
                            and custom percentage of bombs.
                            By default, equal to easier Minefield :
                            Size=10*10, percentage=10%.
                            Pleaze NOTE that if you define a new Custom
                            Level, all the Custom Highscores tables will be
                            erased.

      ** SOUNDS           : (Des)activate all sounds during Game.


      ** SAFE START       : This option activated, the game will automatically
                            clear the very first square you click on, and all
                            squares that surround it. This means that you will
                            never die on the first square, and that you will
                            always get a reasonably sized safe area in which
                            to start.



===================
== Usefull Infos ==
===================

- AutoPause : When the main SBoom window becomes unselected, the Time Counter
              stop immediately and a small scrolltext is printed over it.
              So if you suddenly remember that some other task in the
              background needs some attention, you can go and see to it without
              loosing your current game. Reselect the window with the Left
              MouseButton, and the game restarts.


- Encryption : HighScore File has been Crypted by using a new kind of routine
               No cheats allowed !


- HS 1->2.0  : A tiny utility is supplied which allow to convert
               SBoom HighScores 1.0 File to SBoom 2.0 File.
               You have just to select your current SBoom 1.0 Path, here
               a new file called "SBoom.save" will be generated.
               Just move this file inside your SBoom 2.0 directory,
               and that's all.

- SBoom executable file support the generic "Version" Command.
