New things in version 1.1.1:

Fixed:
Unlimited moves in puzzle bug

New:
There are now blocks on the board then starting a new game except in "Stage Clear"
User can now select puzzle file
User can now reset a puzzle by pushing the "Push" key even if "Game Over"
User can set more option for VS mode
Basic AI, only basic clearing and makes one move every frame!
Saved games are now stored in "Application Data" (Windows 2000+ only)
A new puzzle file, just to test the "select puzzle file" feature

Changed:
New graphics
Default player names

Bugs:
If you have solved a puzzle and restart it by pushing "Push", then fail it you winn still see "Winner"
If a puzzle file is extended the new puzzles will appear solved (it has always been like that)
The AI sometimes get stock (especially in Vs. mode since it doesn't know how to clear blocks)
Windows 9x compatibility is broken, I don't know why. It shouldn't happen!
