What is it? :
 Exit 16 is a simple puzzle game. The objective is to move blocks with the
 same pattern together, so they disappear. This is easier said than done,
 however. The game is controlled by joystick; fire grabs or releases a block,
 and stick movements move the block or cursor. Pressing [ESCAPE] while
 playing ends the current game. Pressing [ESCAPE] while on the title
 screen quits the game and returns to dos or workbench. Pressing [M] 
 toggles between music and sound effects.

What does it cost? :
 Nothing, Exit16 is freeware. If you really like it, and play it a lot,
