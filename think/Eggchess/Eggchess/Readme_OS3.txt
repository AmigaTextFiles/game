This is a quick compile for OS3 of the SDL game 'Egg Chess' 
by Anders Lindström. 

This is a very simple game called Egg Chess (or in swedish: Äggaschack).

Egg Chess URL: http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~e8cal1/sge/apps.html

This game also uses SGE from http://www.etek.chalmers.se/~e8cal1/sge/index.html,
but a version of SGE is included with the game.

Egg Chess is released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, please read the
file 'COPYING' for more info. 

To compile the game for OS3, make sure you have your SDL environment setup 
properly and use the Makefile to compile (type 'make' in the src folder).
