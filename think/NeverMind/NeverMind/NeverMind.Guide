Some of the keys in NeverMind: ___/\\
                               || \\/

In Game Keys:
   "Esc" to quit.
   The arrow keys to move around.
   The numeric keypad to mark/unmark mines in a specific direction.

Menu keys:
   Up and down to move in the menu.
   Space or return to select, or alter an option.

You are also able to use the joystick to move around. But in that case, you are not able to
mark mines (at least not yet).(joysupport is currently disabled)
By the way, moving around with the keyboard is way much faster.

@endnode

@node "menu" "- We don't need no stinkin' Menus! -"
@toc "main"            
Well, not much to say! See the @{"keys" link "keys" 0} section for more info.
The preferences are saved on exit!

On the settings menu you can change a number of option, a short description follows:

There are 4 different difficulty levels:
*Beginner - For beginners and rookies...
*Novice - Recommended for those who tried Beginner level ;)
*Professional - If you've managed Novice, this is the one for you!
*HBe-Expert - *WARNING* only for super-mega-turbo-experts!!

Change Blockset, changes the ingame graphics.

Select Another Screenmode, makes it possible for you to use your favourite screenmode.
You should select a screenmode close to 320*256, but do NOT select a screenmode that is
smaller than this!!!

Music On/Off (You can turn the music off and use your favourite music player instead or run quiet)

@node "instructions" "-Some Brief Instructions For NeverMind-"
@toc "main"
How to play the game:
It's quite easy, you start in the upper left corner of the screen and your target
is to reach the lower right. Does it sound simple enough? Well, there's actually
mines in your way, which you'll have to avoid too. You will only now how many mines
you have around yourself. And for example if you know that there are 0 (none) mines
surrounding. There are no mines to the upleft, up, upright, left, right, belowleft,
below or belowright of you. Some examples:
 
    UL   U   UR
      \\  |  /
       \\ | /
        \\|/
    L ---*--- R   You are --> *
        /|\\       
       / | \\    <-- 0 Mines Surrounding
      /  |  \\
    BL   B   BR



  Mine Mine Mine
      \\  |  /
       \\ | /
        \\|/
 Mine ---*--- Mine   You are --> *
        /|\\       
       / | \\    <-- 8 Mines Surrounding (Should never happen. But if it does, theres a bug!)
      /  |  \\
  Mine Mine Mine


To move around read the @{"keys" link "keys" 0} section.

Note: There might be a chance that you won't be able to complete the the field.
      So it will be forever, unless anyone can write me a pathfinder.

From version 0.64 you are also able to mark mines, see the @{"keys" link "keys" 0} section.

Well, go ahead, try it! You'll probably find the rest out yourself.

Good Luck!

@node "scores" "-How To Score-"
@toc "main"
You've probably asked yourself the following question many times: "How Do I Score?"
The answer is: Go out and rent the movie "Beavis & Butthead Do America", and watch
it onethousand times. Just kidding!

Well, how to get as much score as possible you'll have to find out yourself,
but here is a brief introduction of how the score system works:

To start with, there's one highscore table for every difficulty level, so a there's
a total of four highscore tables.

You get score-points like this:
* Every time you step on new, unvisited block you get 5 plus points.
* Every time you step on a visited block block you get 1 minus point.

If you reach exit, final score is calculated like this:
* 400 plus points at Beginner difficulty
 * 600 plus points at Novice difficulty
  * 800 plus points at Professional difficulty
   * 1000 plus points at HBe-Expert difficulty
 
* 5 plus points for every correct marked mine
* 5 minus points for every incorrect marked mine

The Story
---------
Once, I played a game on a HP48-calculator, I think it was called MineHunt
or something similar. Some years later (1997) I decided to make a clone.
Of course for my favourite computer, Amiga. So I started, and here's the
result. Try it out, and see what you think. Then, if you'd like, write
to @{"Me" link "me" 0} and give me your opinions about it. I'd really appreciate some help.
You might want to check out what to expect in @{"future" link "future" 0} versions.

NeverMind is not misspelled, anyway, here's the story:

@{i}   I was thinking of a name for the game, but all
     names were already taken, so I thought:
                "NeverMind" @{ui}

@node "require" "-System Requirements-"
@toc "main"
NeverMind is multitasking, you can switch screens with left-amiga + M.
But I don't guarantee that NeverMind is safe for your system.

 To run NeverMind, you will (probably) need the following:

   * Kickstart 3.0 or later
   * All data-files in the "data" drawer and the "NeverMind" font
   * diskfont.library (V39 or later)
   * asl.library (V39 or later)
   * Should work without AGA (Tried it out on a friends UAE, worked fine)
   * A keyboard or joystick/joypad (Keyboard is recommended, and faster)
   * medplayer.library (V??  Not included, don't know if it's copyrighted)
     Although the game should work without this one, running silent.

   * A Numeric keypad (Not needed but nice if you would like to mark mines,
     in that way, you can't run into them ;)

@node "future" "-The Future-"
@toc "main"
Please note, by sending @{"Me" link "me" 0} mail and telling me that you like this product, you cheer me up, which
leads to quicker development. When I'm finished with this game, I will continue with my next project,
a Zelda clone! I could need some help creating that game gfx/music/sfx/code, so...contact @{"me" link "me" 0}.
But I don't want to start it until I'm finished with this game. ;)
Currently I'm also working on a NES-rom editor, and a hockey game. The hockey game will probably be
in style with Sensible Soccer.

What I (if I get time) intend to do in "The Future":
    * Add 2-player modes (Thanks Josh Yates-Walker, for the suggestion)

Things I'm currently working on:
    * Fixing bugs and creating a highscore joiner program.

If you would like to draw a blockset, let @{"me" link "me" 0} know.
There will probably never be a wb-version (Due to lack of time).
Maybe if I get some time over, but I don't think I will, sorry.
