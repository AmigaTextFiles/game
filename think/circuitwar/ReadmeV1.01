CIRCUIT WAR V1.01 2/17/89

Circuit War V1.01 includes a few changes from V1.0.  While they aren't major
alterations, they do make the program run a bit smoother...

- the error regarding an attacking gridrunner moving onto a stronger energy
  enemy gridrunner has been fixed so that it works as described in the
  documentation.  A weaker gridrunner moving onto a stronger died and did
  nothing to the target (no loss of target's energy) in V1.0.

- the keyboard shortcut for a Resistor has been changed to Amiga-S.
  V1.0 used Amiga-R which was also the same for a Diode Right!

- the right mouse button bug on the entry screen, as detailed to me by Eric
  Penn, has been corrected.  V1.0 allowed the program to continue when the
  menu button was pressed on the player selection entry screen, effectively
  freezing the task.  Thanks, Eric!

- the program now can sense if all sides have "zeroed out" (no circuits and
  no leftover power).  It now notifies you if zeroing happens and
  terminates normally.

- the audio routines are a bit more well behaved now in the multitasking
  environment.  Sound effects will not be active if the program can't
  access or lock the channels effectively.

- a winner can now be determined at the end of the game.  A short message
  comes up before the program terminates.  V1.0 had no such provision - it
  simply halted execution, allowing exit by menu.

There is also some addendum regarding the documentation file

- SWITCHES - switches are toggled at anytime, except during the Build
  Phase, by simply clicking on them with the mouse.  Remember, though, that
  toggling a switch counts as an action.

- OBJECT DEFENSE STRENGTH TABLE - the base percentages have the gridrunner
  strength * 10% SUBTRACTED from their values.  In other words, the
  stronger the attacking gridrunner is, the easier it is the attack and
  destroy a circuit.

That's it for now!  Keep those messages and replies coming in!  By the way,
anyone interesting in writing a computer opponent for the game?
