Circuit War v1.0  2/10/89

Included in this release are the files:
	CircuitWar          (game program)
	CircuitWar.info     (icon)
	CircuitWar.doc      (game documentation)
	Readme              (this very file)
	fonts/
      2001.font       (2001 font descriptor)
      2001/
          8           (the actual 2001 font)

I've decided to include Jim's "2001.doc" file for use with the 2001 font.
Note: The 2001 font isn't essential to CircuitWar, but I like the aesthetics
of it and have programmed CircuitWar to use it if it can find it in the
current fonts: directory.

Notes about 2001-font:

   I originally created this font to be incorporated into a VT102 emulator
as an alternate font (for compatibility).  Since many people expressed a 
desire to use it in their own programs, I am releasing it into the public
domain.  You may use it any way you wish, as long as you do not gain any
monetary profit from it.
