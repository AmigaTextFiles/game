	Excellent tactical fighting in classic Laser-Squad style. The complexity of
the game allows you to choose or develop different battle tactics to ruin your
opponents. The large number of available scenarios should offer lots of fun for a
long, long time. The three one player scenarios should help you to practise and
they even offer some limited fun.

	-Many scenarios (More than 20)
	-Over 50 Spells! 48 in menu, and more behind items!
	-Nearly 200 different items!
