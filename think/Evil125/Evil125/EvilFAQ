	Q: WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS?
	A: The dragons are not included in the game, mainly because of the fact
	   that the monster graphics are only 32*16 pixels of size. Drawing 8
	   images of a dragon in such a small space is rather difficult. Also,
	   there is the thing with the wings... read the next question...
	   
	Q: FLYING MONSTERS?
	A: Evil is a two dimensional game. That means that no monsters can
	   actually fly in Evil. It would be possible 'say' that a monster is
	   flying, and give it more action points or something, but would be
	   a bit silly. 
	   
	Q: WHY NOT HAVE MORE MONSTERS?
	A: Even now the summon menu contains monsters which are, in fact, just
	   copies of other monsters in the menu. It makes no point to have loads
	   of different looking monsters with the same abilities. We will not expand
	   the summon list any further until we get rid of the boring monsters.
	   
	Q: WHERE IS THE SCENARIO EDITOR?
	A: We might star to develop it after the 1.3 version of Evil is finished.
	
	Q: HOW DO YOU MAKE THE SCENARIOS?
	A: We have a map editor, which we use to make the maps. Then we use DevPac to
	   write down the scenariodata, and then assemble the crap into a scenario.
	   So, the scenariodata is written down using numbers... (Rather boring,
	   actually... guess the scenario editor is a good idea)
	   
	Q: IS THERE ANY WAY OF KNOWING HOW EFFECTIVE A WEAPON IS?
	A: Not really. The only way tho do this is to listen to the screams of
	   your enemies. The louder they scream, the more damage you do.
	   
	Q: HOW SMART THE CPU IS?
	A: It depends from the scenario. Some scenarios have pre-set data for the
	   CPU, thus making it appear to play 'smarter'. Some scenarios have no
	   special data for the CPU, making it just walk around, collect weapons,
	   search for interesting places, etc. but no tactic of any sort.
	   
	Q: WHY NOT HAVE EXPERIENCE POINTS FOR THE MONSTERS?
	A: We fear that it would make players more careful with the monsters. 
	   Monsters in Evil should born fast and die fast. With experiece points,
	   players would not be so eager to take risks, thus slowing down the game.
	   That would be no fun.
