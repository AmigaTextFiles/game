@NODE ONEPLAYER "1-Player-Scenarios"

	One player scenarios work a bit differently that multiplayer scenarios. The
most important change is, that sometimes the CPU-moves are shown to you. This happens 
if certain @{"conditions" link CONDIS} are met. There are three 1player scenarios
available at the moment:

	Math-1: An invasion scenario. You attack a castle controlled by the cpu.

	Prison-1: A rescue mission, you have forces which you must release with a
	          small band of monsters.

        Distillery-1: You protect a house attacked by the cpu.
        
 	
 	All three scenarios have a time limit, and some special victory conditions.
The CPU-monsters have different 'orders' specially developed for the scenario, but
their acting is still quite random. So they do not appear in the same place in every
scenario.

	The scenarios are also quite difficult, and are currently only tested by the
coder. Even he loses frequently, so don't get sad if you don't manage at first :)
        	
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE CONDIS

	While it is the cpu's turn, a text appears on the screen, reading "independent
creatures". You can hear the sound effect, so if a cpu-player opens a door, you can
hear it. So listen carefully. Also, sometimes you can actually see what is happening,
if 
	1) Your monster sees the cpu-player. Your monster must have the correct
	   facing for this, and it's sight range must be sufficient.
	2) If a cpu-player engages your monster in hand-to-hand combat, the combat
	   is shown.
	3) For both 1 and 2, the cpu player must be visible, or if it is
	   invisible, your monster must have IR-vision.
	   
	So, the cpu moves are not shown, when, for example
	
	- cpu throws a spear at you, but your monster does not see it.
	- cpu shoots you with a bow, but your monster does not see it.
	- your are targetted with a spell ...
	
	and so on. If your monster dies from a attack such as those, you do not
	see it.


@ENDNODE
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE KOMPIS "Independent Monsters"
   
     	There are 3 different computer player allegiances in Evil. All of them are
equally intelligent, but they attack each other just as if they were human players.
These three allegiances include:
 
	@{"The normal independent monsters" link KOMPIS6}
	@{"The living dead zombies" link KOMPIS7}
	@{"The demongate gargoyles" link KOMPIS8}
  
  	The independent monsters are able to use almost all available items for your
doom. They can cast spells for their own benefit and your doom. Alone they are not
very dangerous, but if they outnumber your troops, they can be a serious threat.
    
        The CPU player does not 'think'. The monsters just run around, quaff potions,
cast peaceful spells, and collect weaponry until enemy is sighted. Then they will 
attack using all the resources they are programmed to use. 

	Sometimes, however, the CPU player has some pre-planned maneuvers. Every
1-player scenario has specific instructions for some CPU monsters, and so do a few
multiplayer scenarios, too. These instructions create different paths for the CPU
monsters to follow. In this way, the cpu player is enable to guard, invade or just
stay out of trouble. But this guiding is not the CPU's number one priority. It will
only follow pre-set instructions when it has nothing else to do. (that is, no items
to pick up, no interesting locations to go to, no enemies etc.) This means, that
despite the pre-set control data, the CPU player still acts quite randomly, not
always going the same ways over and over again.

	Also, the CPU monsters don't do things quite in the same way as human
players do. CPU players can, for example, use wands and bows directly from their
backpack. However, the CPU pays 4 extra action points for this (The price it would
cost to move the wand/bow into the monster's hand).
 
 	
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE KOMPIS6 "Normal Independent Monsters"
 
 	These independent computer-controlled monsters are present in some scenarios.
They take their turn immediately after the last participating human player. Their
only objective is to kill everyone not of their own allegiance. 
        
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE KOMPIS7 "The Living Dead"
 
	This allegiance comes into the play when the @{"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD" link B8} spell is
cast. @{"The dead corpses" link CORPSES} rise to revenge, and their only purpose is to kill all monster
not of their own rotten allegiance. They are almost harmless unless there are a great
number of them.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE KOMPIS8 "The Grotesque Gargoyles"
   
 	Independent monsters of this allegiance appear when a @{"demongate" link V7} is left
uncontrolled, or controlled by a inadept monster. If a @{"gargoyle" link GARGOYLE} steps out of the
gate without being instantly commanded, it becomes independent, and wants to kill
all monsters not of its own allegiance. Naturally, if these gargoyles could somehow
possess other monsters, it is possible to have others than just gargoyles in this
allegiance. 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ATTRIBUTES "Monster Attributes"

	In addition of Action Points, Health Value and Mana, all monsters have different
physical attributes.
       
	STRENGTH: The ability to carry and throw things. Also, modifies inflicted
		  damage. Varies from 1 to about 15
	
	DEXTERITY: The ability to hit targets in all forms of combat. Varies from
		   0 to about 60
	   
	INTELLIGENCE: The ability to resist spells, and regenerate spent mana points.
		      Varies from 0 to about 100. Monsters regenerate intelligence/10
		      points of mana every turn.
	 
	MACHO BONUS: The ability to resist pain. Varies from 0 to about 10. The	value
		     of macho bonus is directly subtracted from battle damage.
		     
	REGENERATION: The amount of hitpoints regenerated in a turn. Varies from 0 to
		      about 40.
		     
	MAGIC ABILITY: The spell casting knowledge of a monster. Varies from 0 to 6.
	 	       (0=Can not cast spells, 6=Can cast up to the Violet level)
	 	    
	@{"MAGIC RESISTANCE:" link MAGICPROT} The natural magic protection. Varies from 0 to 6. 0 means
			  no protection at all. Protection levels beyond 3 can only
			  be achieved via the use of magical consumables.
  
  	SIGHT RANGE: The number of square the monster is able to see. Varies from 1 to 25
              			  
	These attribute values can not be seen in the game, but they do affect it
in many ways.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE SAVE "Loading And Saving Game"
 
 	Saving Game
 	-----------
 	           
 	At the beginning of the player number 1's turn, you are granted an opportunity 
to save the current game. To do so, press 'S' when it is asked for. Then, enter a path
and a name for the savegame, then press return when you are ready. If the save was
succesful, you will see a 'OK' message, in case of an error, you will hear a sound
signal, and get to edit the name again.

	The game saves the savefiles into Save-directory in Evil: . When you wish
to load a saved game, just launch Evil from WB, click on the 'load saved' and pick
the game. Unfortunately, for now, there is no delete-button, so you must delete
the old savefiles by yourself, or to save over them. Maybe a delete-button will be
included in a really boring and rainy day with no money or anything.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ITEMS "Items"

	There are lots of different items in Evil. The purpose of some is obvious, but
for some more peculiar items, it is not...

	@{" Consumables " link CONSUMABLES }
	@{" Armors " link ARMORS }
	@{" Weapons " link WEAPONS }
	@{" Mines and Shovel " link MINES }
	@{" Bugs " link BUGS }
	@{" Cauldrons&Compounds " link CAULDRONS }
	@{" Bombs and Grenades " link BOMBS }
	@{" Corpses " link CORPSES }
	@{" Treasure Items " link TREASURES }
	@{" Scrolls " link SCROLLS }
	@{" Magic Wand " link MAGIC }
	@{" Other Magic Stuff " link SPELLCASTERS }
	
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE CONSUMABLES "Consumable Stuff"

	Quite often, you are able to find stuff that can be somehow consumed. This
includes everything between bananas and syringes. Some of these edibles heal your
monster, while some of them might be serious intoxicants. Some consumables are magic,
and they can give your monster a magic @{"state" link STATES}, for example,invisibility.

	Consumables are consumed using the right mousebutton over the consumable item,
which is located in your monster's @{"hand" link ITEMBX}.

	But a word of caution! Sometimes even the nicest looking potions can be
proven to contain most evil and utterly malevolent forces :).

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE WEAPONS "Weapons"

	There are two different weapon categories in Evil. The melee weapons, and the 
long ranged weapons. Some of these items might be magic. If they are, the 
@{"level of the magic" link MAGIC} is shown after the name of the weapon. Non-magical items
can also be magically @{"enchanted" link Y8}.
       
       	The Melee Weapons
	-----------------
	
	These are the basic melee weapons, such as swords, daggers and axes. They can
require your monster to use either one or two hands to wield the weapon. The
main purpose of these items is to kill your enemies. To do this, you should put
these items in your @{"monster's hands" link ITEMBX}, and initiate @{"close combat" link CLOSEC}.

	The Long Ranged Weapons
	-----------------------
	
	These inculde bows, crossbows and the hat. They are used in the normal way,
just put the item in your monster's @{"hand-box" link ITEMBX}, and use the right mouse button
over the weapon's image.
  
  
	NOTE: All items can be used as long ranged weapons. Just @{"throw" link ICONS} them
at your enemies. Naturally, melee weapons inflict more damage than say, potions.
	
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE MINES "Mines and Shovel"

	One of the most effective ways to block passage to a certain area is to use
landmines. There are two different mines in Evil, the anti-personnel mine and the
anti-tank mine. Both of these items are used in the @{"normal way" link ITEMBX}. This
causes your monster to deploy the mine right in front of it. The mine is now active, and
will detonate immediately when stepped on by a monster of ANY allegiance. Non-Material
monsters will not detonate mines. Explosions will detonate all mines inside the blast
radius.
  
	Most of the time, you will want your mines to be hidden. The shovel is a perfect
item for this, for it allows you to hide items that are located in front of your
monster. Use the shovel with the right mousebutton, and if the square is suitable for
digging, the item(s) will disappear from the map. They are now hidden, and can be made
visible using the @{"search-icon" link ICONS}. Naturally, you cannot make mines visible in this 
way, because when you enter the square where a mine is hidden and activated, it will 
immediately detonate. 
  
	Another way to conceal mines is to use @{"magic" link O8}.
 	
	Pioneers are experts with mines. When @{"summoned" link V8}, they appear with a shovel and
a pile of mines.		

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE BUGS "Throwable Magic Bugs"

	These special items are used to track the movements of the enemy monsters. The
use of the bugs is easy, all you need to do is to @{"throw" link ICONS} it at your enemy. If your 
monster hits the enemy with a bug, the bug will attach itself into the enemy monster. 
Now, the enemy monster is permanently visible to your monsters, and you will ALWAYS
know where it is located. 

	The only way to get rid of these bugs is to get rid of the monster. When the
monster dies, the bug becomes inactive.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE CAULDRONS "Cauldrons And Spell Compounds"

	These items work with the @{"CONFUSING COOKING OF COMPOUNDS" link G6} spell. The spell 
compounds can be found from a certain type of bushes, and the cauldron are usually found
inside chests etc.
 
 	A filled cauldron has unlimited charges, and generally stronger effects than
the normal consumable items. The only way to get rid of a filled cauldron is to use
the @{"throw icon" link ICONS}. When a filled cauldron is throwed it becomes empty.
 
 	The effect of a cauldron depends of the spell compound you used to create it.

	Compound			Cauldron
	--------			--------

	Big Blue Berries		Invisibility Cauldron 	
	Ominous Mushroom		Protection Cauldron
	Weird Smelling Leaf		Cannabis Cauldron
	Big Brown Nut			Strength Cauldron
	Edelweiss			Dexterity Cauldron
	Ominous Berries			Macho Cauldron
    	
	Nitro				Explosive Cauldron - Cannot be consumed, 
					explodes when thrown or used. (a trap)	
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE BOMBS "Bombs and Grenades"

	Bombs
	-----
	
	These items are simple explosives, that are @{"thrown" link ICONS} towards your enemies. They
explode immediately on impact, i.e. when thrown.
 
  	Grenades
  	--------
   	
 	Grenades are a bit more complex explosives than the Bombs. They need to be
primed before they explode. If you wish to prime a grenade, you need to have it in
your hand, and click right mouse button on top of it. Then use the arrow keys to set
the timer, and left mouse button to activate the grenade. The timer counts the small
sub-turns you and the participating players take. For example, if the timer is set to
be 0, the grenade will explode immediately when you end your turn. If the timer was set
to be 1, the grenade would explode when the next player ends his turn. 
 
 	Most often you propably want to set the timer to be 0, for the simpliest use.
The @{"IMMEDIATE ITEM DELIVERY" link R5} spell works exceptionally well with the grenades... 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE CORPSES "- You wanna see em'?  -The What?   -The Cooorpseees"
  
	When the battle goes on, it is normal that lots of corpses start to appear.
These stiffs might look harmless, because they are already dead, right ? Wrong. The
dead might not stay dead for long, if the @{"NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD" link B8} spell should be
cast. Also, corpses can be reanimated to serve you as zombies, with the use of the
@{"ASTONISHING ANIMATION OF CORPSES" link Y7}-spell.
 
	Also, because the corpses are quite large items, they weight a lot. Thus they
are deadly if throwed at enemies by strong monsters.
 
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE TREASURES "Treasure Items"

 	In some scenarios, there might be special items that might cause one of the
participating sides to win the match. Sometimes these items are 'treasure items', that
can not be transported by means of magic. Also, if your monster walks into a portal
with a treasure-item in its backpack, the item is automatically dropped before entering
the portal. The same happens with the use of teleportation spells.

 	Treasure items were created, because the magic spells of Evil allow very quick
transport of items around the map, and it would be almost impossible to design
scenarios with important items as objectives.
 
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE SCROLLS "Scrolls"
 
  	Scrolls are created by the @{"SCROLL OF SERIOUS SCRIBBLING" link R3}-spell. They are very
useless, but good for sending taunts and threats to your enemies. Also, they can be
used to appeal into your enemies curiousity.
 
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE SPELLCASTERS "Items That Contain Specific Spells"
 
  	Some special items can cast spells. When your monster uses such an item, it
is able to cast a spell inside the item without losing mana or without having any
knowledge of magic. Spellcasting items are activated in the normal way.
 
 	Some spellcating items might have spells in them that can not be found from
the magic menu. Some spellcasters allow you to choose a target for the spell, while
some might target yourself immediately. Some spellcasters tell you the name of the
spell, which they contain, while some do not.
 
 	A good example of a spellcaster that lets you know the name of the spell is
the wand of missiles. Also, a good example of a spellcaster that does not tell you
its spell are the anomalous ankhs. The use of such items can be dangerous, but also
very beneficial.

	@{"The harp" link HARP}
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@NODE HARP "The Harp"

	This interesting piece of musical equipment first appeared in the V1.25. All
monsters who have at least one arm, can play the harp. This terrible music can have
a fatal effect on monsters who disagree with the musicant's taste. 

	Musicians usually play music, which corresponds to their intelligence. Very
smart characters enjoy complex music, while stupid ones like to listen simple 'plings'
and 'plongs'. (It should be noted that the coder's record collection contains mainly
techno music at this point. :) ) Anyway, it is quite obvious that the harp can be used
as an effective weapon against monsters with different taste of music.

	The harp has a range of about 10 squares. If there is an obstacle in the way,
the music can not be heard. There is an exception; inside a 3-square-radius ALL 
monsters hear the music, even through obstacles. Disabled (passed out) monsters do 
not care for music. Intoxicants of all sorts are ignored, if taken reasonably. The 
music is considered to cover the lower half of the magic, that is, it is of the
3rd level - yellow magic. This means that every monster is affected, unless they
have obtained special protection via potions or something. The possible damage due
to the music is not lowered by any faction.

@ENDNODE
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE STATES "Magic States"

	During the play, your monsters can be affected by magic. They might quaff a
strength potion, or be targetted by an invisibilty spell. When something like this
happens, the monster is said to be under a specific state. This state is shown after
the name of the monster in brackets. For example, if a brave knight drinks a bottle
of booze, his new state would be 'drunken' and shown like this :

	BRAVE KNIGHT (DRUNKEN)
   
   	The monsters of Evil may have only one magical state active at a time. If you
try to use several state modifiers simultaneously, you will get an error message. If
you happen to accidentally gain an unwanted state, you can cancel its effects via the
use of the @{"SUDDEN SOBERING OF SERVANTS" link Y6}-spell.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE COMBAT "Combat"

	Monsters can kill their enemies in a number of ways:
	
	@{"Close Combat" link CLOSEC}
	@{"Long Range Combat" link LONGC}
	@{"Magic" link MAGIC}

	Monsters can also try to defend themselves:
	
	@{"Saving Action Points" link SAVINGPOINTS}
	@{"Magic Protection" link MAGICPROT}
	@{"Armors" link ARMORS}

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE MAGIC "Magic"

	Magic in Evil is divided up into 6 different levels. These levels
are represented by colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Violet.
Red magic is the easiest to handle and Violet is the most difficult.
Wizards and other spellcasters wear different colored robes. These colors
usually indicate the highest level of magic the character can handle, i.e.
a yellow colored mage could cast spells of red,orange and yellow level but
no higher. 

	Casting Spells :
 		
	The spells are cast by using a magical wand. Put it into your
character's hand and use right button to see the magic menu. Choose a spell
by using the left mouse button, right button aborts. Note that some 
@{"wands or other items" link SPELLCASTERS} contain certain spells in them, and are only able to 
cast that spell only (but you don't lose any mana). Such items are usually named 
as 'wand of fireballs' or something similiar. 
 	
	We have tried to make every spell useful. In some games there's 
stupid spells nobody would never cast in serious combat. If we discover
that none of us is using a certain spell, we'll do something to make it
better... lower the manaprice or boost the effect, whatever. Obviously a
master sorcerer doesn't cast red level spells very often, but the point is,
that a red level illusionist finds all of them useful. (or at least FUN)

	Each spell level contains 8 spells.

@NODE R1 "SpellData"


MAGIC MISSILE O'MASSIVE MAULING
-------------------------------
	This one is targetted against a single character. The targetted
character suffers slight damage (20Pts) from the impact of the missile. 
The spell causes no damage against terrain, and cannot ignite fires. 
Illusionist's basic weapon with 100% hit. Shields and armors do not reduce 
the damage of this spell. The target must be visible.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE R2 "SpellData"

BANDAGE OF VERY SUDDEN HEALING
------------------------------
	This one is like the magic missile, but has opposite effect, i.e. it
heals a character. 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE R3 "SpellData"

SCROLL OF SERIOUS SCRIBBLING
----------------------------
	Creates a scroll. You need to have one hand free for this. Scrolls
can be used to send obscene messages to your enemies, threats or pure
malicious taunts and insults. We recommend that this is used frequently to
annoy your enemies. (They do make more mistakes when annoyed, and are more
likely to run right into your traps)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE R4 "SpellData"

CREATION OF INSIDIOUS ILLUSIONS
-------------------------------
	Creates an illusion of a selected target. The illusion is a non-material
image and its able to slowly hover around. The Illusion can't attack, and
it can't pick or use any items. The spellcaster is able to sense terrain
trough the illusion, but only a few squares (so the illusion can actually 'see')
The illusion is destroyed right after it suffers any damage. Its not protected
by any magic. Needless to say, the main purpose of this spell is to attract
enemy firepower. A fireball wasted at an illusion is a costly one...

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE R5 "SpellData"

IMMEDIATE ITEM DELIVERY
-----------------------
	This teleports the item in the mouse pointer to a place choosed by
you. Very useful if you want to send equipment to your troops or scrolls
to your enemies. Also useful for sending explosives.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE R6 "SpellData"

LONG RANGE OPEN OF OPENING
--------------------------
	Opens a door or a window, works just like the icon of opening but
can be done from quite far away. Quite useful when you want to block the
line of sight or to confuse your enemy. Note that you don't need to see
the door to cast this spell.

@NODE R7 "SpellData"

BOSAUS OF INVISIBLE MONSTERS
----------------------------
	Makes invisible monsters visible from 10*10 area. The location you
choose is the centre of the area. Exceptionally useful if you suspect
infiltrators or notice mysterious deaths or wounds. (They might be right
behind you, keep your las.. er.. sword handy) 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE R8 "SpellData"

SUDDEN STRENGTH OF JAX
----------------------
	Makes one of your characters to become exceptionally strong.
This should not be underestimated. It's a great advantage in combat and 
very useful if you're wearing armor and don't want to lose action points.

@ENDNODE

@NODE O1 "SpellData"
                     _ _   
PUNTTI OF INSTANT SETALA MODE
-----------------------------
	This creates a rather large and heavy object into your target's
backpack. Your target needs to have space for this, too. This spell has
a very low range and is meant for defensive purposes. It causes no damage
but surely slows down your opponent. Two of these is usually enough to
almost totally immobilize a character. The name of the spell comes from
a certain invidual (who is very fat indeed, and moves around very slowly).

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE O2 "SpellData"

FURIOUS FLAME O'FORMIDABLE FIRE
-------------------------------
	Ignites a 2*2 area. Useful if you believe the bushes nearby are
occupied by enemy warriors. Also useful if you think those damn bushes
are going to slow you down too much.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE O3 "SpellData"

MAGIC SHIELD OF SUDDEN SURVIVAL
-------------------------------
	A useful spell, protects you from direct damage (swords, fire, etc).
Reduces the damage by 13 points, making you hard to kill in combat. (But is
little help when you face fireballs and about 150 points of damage...) Does
not protect against magic missiles. Lasts 4 turns.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE O4 "SpellData"

SURPRISING SPEED OF LIGHTNING
-----------------------------
	Speeds up a character of your choice. Immediately adds 30 action
points to the character, and maintains the bonus for the next 5 turns.
(gain of 6*30=180 aps - a lot)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE O5 "SpellData"

SURPRISING SHAPE OF FOUL FOG
----------------------------
	Makes somebody non-material. Useful if you want to do a sneak attack
or just to escape quickly inside a wall. Note that when this spell wears
off, its not good to be inside rock. (2 rounds)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE O6 "SpellData"

GLOWING EYES O'SUDDEN IR-VISION
-------------------------------
	Cast this spell and you're able to actually see those damned 
invisible enemies running around you. Very useful indeed. You can also
see monsters who are hiding.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE O7 "SpellData"

CONFUSING CREATION OF ODD ITEMS
-------------------------------
	Casting this spell allows you to actually grab an item out of
nowhere. But what item will that be? That's the chance you take, but usually
you can expect a powerful weapon... You need a free hand for this spell, just
as if you were about to cast the scroll spell.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE O8 "SpellData"

DEVIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF ITEMS
------------------------------
	This spell conceals items. Exceptionally useful for making mines
totally invisible. Also useful for protecting your cauldrons. The items
hidden with this spell can be found normally by searching.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Y1 "SpellData"

TELEPORTATION OF TRAVELLING
---------------------------
	Teleports your caster to a place choosed by you. The place must be
a square which you have already seen, that is, visible on your map. Riders
cannot teleport their horses, neither can horses teleport with their riders.
(Like magic-user centaurs) You can not teleport inside solide substance,
neither can you teleport on top of somebody.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Y2 "SpellData"

BIG BLAST OF COLOSSAL CHARRING
------------------------------

	A tremendous explosion of a very wide area. The only drawback is the
quite small amount of damage, but it doesn't decrease very quickly - making it 
almost as effective through its whole area. 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Y3 "SpellData"

HEAVENLY HEALING O'WHOLE HEALTH
-------------------------------
	A quick way to regenerate your nearly dead warriors to face combat
again. Or to avoid doom. And death. And destruction.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Y4 "SpellData"

MAGIC MISSILE O'MEGA MUTILATION
-------------------------------
	A stronger version of the red level missile. Inflicts more damage
(40pts), is useful against non-material creatures and is not affected by 
armor or shields. The target must be visible.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Y5 "SpellData"

SUDDEN BODILY DISAPPEARANCE
---------------------------
	A defensive invisibility spell. Causes the spellcaster to become 
invisible for a short period of time. Hardly useful in offensive maneuvers, but
good for quick escapes.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Y6 "SpellData"
 
SUDDEN SOBERING OF SERVANTS   
---------------------------
	Sometimes it happens that somebody gets accidentally intoxicated so
that he's unable to do anything... That's when this spell comes handy, it
clears the target's head from intoxicating substances such as ethanol, LSD or
THC. Handy... accidents (?) happen...  Note that this spell can also be used
to cancel spells... shields, strength spells etc.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Y7 "SpellData"

ASTONISHING ANIMATION O'CORPSES
-------------------------------
	The dead rise to serve you with this spell! All you need is a dead
corpse... This spell awakens the dead, and makes them zombies. They lose
their intelligence and all magical benefits. They also become slow and 
clumsy, but they do still have their strength... Very useful for creating
zombies from large corpses. 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Y8 "SpellData"


ENCHANTING OF ENORMOUS EDGES
----------------------------
	This spell enchants the weapons you are holding in your hands.
Non-magical axes turn into lethal magical blades which disrupt even the most
evil spirits who are not affected by normal weapons. This spell is not
cumulative, weapons which are already magical are not affected at all. The
spell comes handy if you are unable to find magical weaponry and are facing
a number of undead or other magically protected creatures. Enchanted weapons
inflict a bit more damage too, so the spell is somewhat useful against 
normal creatures aswell. Encanting a weapon gives it a green magic level. 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE G1 "SpellData"

FIREBALL OF FURIOUS FLAMING 
----------------------------
	A deadly fireball is launched towards your target. The fireball has a
very impressive damage which can kill almost every character instantly. 
However, The damage decreases quite fast and does only little damage far from
the centre of the explosion. The area of the fireball is 5*5. Notice that the
fireball acts like a thrown weapon; it can possibly hit any obstacles between
the caster and the target. If you shoot the fireball through a window, it might
not fly through it and explode. Naturally bushes and trees have a higher chance
to block the fireball. This spell is deadly, and very popular.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE G2 "SpellData"

SHIELD O'SUDDEN INVULNERABILITY
-------------------------------
	Just as the orange level shield, but absorbs up to 50 points of damage.
This makes your characters almost impossible to kill. (a warrior wearing a
platemail and under this spell can take up to 66 points of damage without
losing a single hitpoint)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE G3 "SpellData"

PERPLEXING PORTAL O'PUNY PLACES
-------------------------------
	Creates a dimensional gate which allows very fast travel between two
places. It can be used by both friendly and hostile creatures. Crossing the
portal costs 4 action points. This version has a very limited range, and is
useful for creating shortcuts mostly inside your controlled area. (or what
you THINK you control...)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE G4 "SpellData"

MEGA MACULATION OF MAGGOT MINDS
-------------------------------
	Attacks a character of your choise mentally. The damage of this spell
is calculated directly from the intelligence values of the caster and the
defender. If the defender is mentally stronger, the attacker takes damage
instead. Very useful against mindless undeads and stupid sword brandishers
who don't understand to stay far from those of superior intelligence...
The largest drawback is the limited range of this spell, only 5 squares.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE G5 "SpellData"

MEGA MASKING O'MASSIVE MONSTERS
-------------------------------
	This spell allows characters to appear as something they are
not. Demons might look like puny goblins, and horses might appear to be
master sorcerers. The main drawback of this spell is the fact that you'll
never know what you are going to look like after the spell is cast. The
spell never wears off - the change is permanent and the only thing you
can do is to cast this spell again and hope for a better form... (This
spell has no drawbacks, it merely changes your icon)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE G6 "SpellData"

CONFUSING COOKING OF COMPOUNDS
------------------------------
	This spell brews magical liquids into your cauldrons. You'll need
to find some magical herbs for this spell. Different herbs create different
liquids. These liquids are usually far more effective than the normal 
potions found in chests. Note also, that the cauldrons never go empty by
drinking; the only way to empty one is to throw it somewhere. (Do this to
your enemies cauldrons...) Different spell compounds (herbs, mushrooms etc.)
create different cauldrons. Ever tasted sweet, nice chockolade ???

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE G7 "SpellData"

SHOCKING SNATCHING OF SWORDS
----------------------------
	If your foes are armed with too powerful weapons, cast this spell
to steal them from their hands. The items appear into the same square you
are in. Wands are not affected by this spell (the ones used to bring up 
the magic menu; all the other wands are affected normally) Non-material
items are also not affected. (Ethereal items or normal items carried by
an non-material monster)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE G8 "SpellData"

MYSTERIOUS MELTING OF MATERIALS
-------------------------------
	If your path is blocked by an annoying wall, you can melt it with
this spell. This spell also works on boulders, stone walls and so on, but
it can not be cast against non-solid targets. Good for creating shorcuts.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE B1 "SpellData"

SCATTERING OF SHOCKING SULUTE
-----------------------------
	Lets you deploy 2 antitank mines, and 5 anti personnel mines to the map. You 
must deploy the mines in 10' radius, but you do not have to see the square you wish to 
booby-trap. The antitank mines are left visible, but the antipersonnel mines are
concealed. Also, if you should try to deploy a mine under someone's feet, you lose
that mine. No message will tell you of this if, say, you try to put a mine in a square, 
which is occupied by an invisible enemy monster.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE B2 "SpellData"

BLAST OF HUGE AREA CHARRING
---------------------------
	A more powerful version of the Yellow level blast. Inflicts more
damage and has an ever wider area (be careful with this!) Very useful when
facing lots of enemies.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE B3 "SpellData"

POSSESSION OF PATHETIC BASTARDS
-------------------------------
	With this spell you are able to convert enemy characters into friendly
ones! The ones you try to possess can try to resist this spell. The more 
intelligent they are, the more difficult they are to possess.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE B4 "SpellData"

DEVIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF ALLIES
-------------------------------
	Makes a character of your choice invisible. This lasts for a longer
time than the yellow level version, and can be used more effectively in 
invasions.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE B5 "SpellData"

CONFUSING CONCEALING OF PORTALS
-------------------------------
	Makes your portals invisible. This is very useful if you cast it
immediately after opening a portal. A very useful spell, but quite expensive...

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE B6 "SpellData"

INFERNOUS INDICATION OF THE IT
------------------------------
	Useful only when there's independent creatures present in the
scenario. This spell makes somebody the ultimate enemy, or the 'it', and
every independent monsters wants to get him and only him. There can be only
one IT at a time; if another it-spell is cast, all the previous spell lose
effect. When a monster dies it of course is no longer it. The range of this
spell is 30 squares. Your spellcaster does NOT have to see the target, it
is enough when he is inside the range.

	Independent creatures are unaffected by this spell. It can not
be used against them. (Yes, they are protected by laws of physics.)

	This spell is disabled in 1-player battles. (And maybe in some
other future scenarios)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE B7 "SpellData"

ENORMOUS ERUPTION O'ELECTRICITY
-------------------------------
	Creates a 15 squares long lighting bolt. Every character in it's
path suffers 100 points of damage, the effect does not fade and the bolt
bounces off targets it can't destroy. It is not a good idea to cast this
spell directly ahead towards a wall, because it changes it's direction by
180 degrees.... or right towards your conjurer. The spell is very useful
if your foes are coming to get you in a line formation.

@ENDNODE

@NODE B8 "SpellData"

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUDDEN NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD
-------------------------------
	The dead rise up and start massacring the living around them! The
Zombies are controlled by the computer, and they attack everybody except
their own. (That is, they don't attack zombies created by this spell, but
they do attack zombies controlled by you or your foes) They are able to
pick up weapons, drink bottles, throw bombs at you etc. so be careful
with them. Again a very popular spell.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE V1 "SpellData"

DISPELLING OF DIMENSIONAL DOORS
--------------------------------
	A spell that closes a demongate or a portal. Good for closing enemy demongates,
or closing dangerous portals.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE V2 "SpellData"

GIGANTIC GATE OF GREAT DISTANCE
-------------------------------
	Creates a portal similiar to the short one, but has a dramatically
longer range. This allows you to open dimensional gates inside your opponent's
base of power for deadly surprise invasions.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE V3 "SpellData"

SUDDEN SLAYING OF SLIMY SUCKERS
-------------------------------
	A simple spell, kills somebody. It has a rather good chance of success,
much better than the possession spell. Only very intelligent characters can
resist this spell. 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE V4 "SpellData"

SUDDEN SUICIDAL NUCLEAR STRIKE
------------------------------
	A desperate sorcerer's spell... the sorcerer detonates with the power
of a nuclear warhead, causing sudden destruction. The price you pay for this
spell is your life. (But the chances of taking other to hell with you are
quite good...)

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE V5 "SpellData"

CONFUSING CONQUESTING O'CORPSES
-------------------------------
	Master sorcerers have one major flaw - they can't withstand physical
damage. But what if they would leave that frail body and possess a stronger
one? This spell makes this possible. All you need to do is to find a dead
corpse (should not be too difficult), put it in your hand-box and cast this
spell. However, your old body does not die, but it turns into a zombie, and
it still has all your old equipment. So be prepared to kill your old body
right after you possess a new one.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE V6 "SpellData"

RADIOACTIVE RADAR OF REVEALING
-------------------------------
	Enchants your birdmap to show all enemies. Very useful for spotting
invisible monsters. Lasts only one turn. This spell is extremely effective
when you have clearly gained the upper hand. This allows you to quickly root
out those last enemies, who are propably hiding somewhere - only waiting to
be killed. The manacost of this spell is high, but if you are already clearly
victorious, you should not need that much mana anyway.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE V7 "SpellData"

GLUM GATE O'GROTESQUE GARGOYLES
-------------------------------
	Opens a gate straight to hell. Just wait a few turns and soon the
most foul creatures of hell start crawling out of the gate... You can
immediately try to possess these creatures, the only thing you need to
do is to stand right next to the gate with one of your characters. If your
character is smart enough, he can control the gargoyle and to force it fight
on your side. (So it turns into a friendly character) But you can also fail
to control ... If this happens, the demon tries to get you and
everybody else. The possibility of succeeding depends from your character's
intelligence. Stupid zombies have no possibility in controlling the demons,
but Master Sorcerers succeed almost always. (Note: You DONT need to cast
ANY spells to possess the gargoyles. Just stand next to the gate)

	If there's many characters around the gate, the most intelligent
one may try the possession, no matter if he's a friend or a foe. The gates
have no allegiance; anybody can try to possess the creatures coming out
of it. 

	And there's more: Controlling a gate costs you 3 points of mana per
turn, which you must leave for your sorcerer before you end your turn. If you 
do not leave mana, your sorcerer loses control of the gate. Note that you can 
not possess gargoyles with the mana your sorcerer would regenerate.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE V8 "SpellData"

SUDDEN SUMMONING OF SLAVES
---------------------------
	Propably the most important spell in the whole game. Only the most
skilled magicians can cast this spell, and are able to create an endless
horde of minions. Needless to say, this spell is the most important in the
game.

	The spell opens another menu, where you can choose the monster you wish
to summon. When you point at it, you can read some information about the monster,
and see its mana price.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE SAVINGPOINTS "Saving Action Points"

	If you suspect possible attack against your monsters, you can leave unused
action points to them when you end your turn. The monsters will then 
automatically use these points to fight your enemies even if it is not your turn. 

	You can leave points to your monsters for two different purposes:
	
	
	1 - Close Combat 
	----------------
	
	If you leave points to a monster, who is holding weapons in its hands, it will
instantly attack any monster who comes within its reach. Also, when attacked
from behind, your monster will use the points you left for it to do counter
blows. It might even be able to kill the attacking foe. Because one attack
costs 10 action points, you need to leave at least 10 points to a monster to
allow fighting. Also, if the monster is attacked from behind, it will also need
4 points for turning around, that is, you should leave 14 points.

	You can also easily set up traps using this option. For example, you could
walk over a cupboard, and use the hide-icon. Then, leave many action points
to the hiding monster, and make sure, that its facing is to the direction where
the enemy might be coming from. Now, when the enemy walks into the adjanced
square, or, it comes inside your hiding monster's reach, the monster jumps from
the cupboard and immediately initiates close combat. Narrow corridors can also
be easily ambushed by one or more monsters.
	
	2 - Long Range Combat
	---------------------
	
	If you leave your monster armed with a bow and lots of action points, it will
immediately open fire upon enemies it sees. Since shooting costs 10 action points, you
must leave at leas 10 points behind. For example, if you leave 45 points to a monster 
with a bow, it can shoot 4 times at an enemy. The monster fires an arrow every time 
the enemy does an action and is still visible. Again example, let us assume that you 
have left 55 points to a bowman, and left him watching a corridor. Now, when your enemy
takes his turn, and walks into the corridor, his monster is greeted by a friendly arrow. 
Now, if your enemy immediately walks away from the corridor, so that your bowman does 
not see him, he could not fire at the enemy anymore, but would still have 45 points 
left. On the other hand, if the enemy would do something else in the corridor, anything
that costs action points, your bowman could shoot at it again. 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ARMORS "Armors"

	Armors are the easiest way to avoid massive amounts of damage. Wearing a plate
mail or a leather armor effectively decreases the damage you get during combat. The
major drawback of armors is their weight, a plate armor is not designed to those who
are not physically strong.

	Armors can only be weared by monsters who fit into them. A giant could not
possibly fit into a human-sized armor. Special sized armors are named accordingly,
for example 'shokan plate' or 'kaakki leather'. 

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE MAGICPROT "Magic Protection"

	Some monsters are magically protected. There are 6 different @{"levels of magic" link MAGIC},
which means, that there are also six levels of protection.

	If you attack a monster with a weapon, which has worse level of magic than
the protection, the weapon causes no damage at all. Example: You attack a skeleton
warrior with a normal broadsword. Since the skeleton is naturally protected by a
red level magic, and the broadsword is not magic at all, it can cause no damage.
Another example: You possess a silver bow, which is of red magic level. The bow has
the same level of magic with the protection, and works just fine. Also, if you had a
weapon, with a magic level of orange or better, it would also work just as well.

	Some natural weapons are also magical. For example, the bite of a hellhound
is of the green magic.

	Magic protection can also be achieved during the game. You might find a vial
of protection and drink it, which would give your character a +2 level bonus!
@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE LONGC "Long Range Combat"

	If you see enemies, that are too far for close combat, you can try to shoot
them with bows, breath fire on them, or throw daggers.

	If you want to shoot arrows, you need a bow in your hands. Click right mouse
on top of the bow, target the enemy, and fire. Bows have unlimited ammunition.

	Breathing fire is done by clicking on the 'breath' icon, and then targetting
the enemy. Some monsters can only use their breath-attack only once a turn, while some
may use it more often.

	Throwing items at your enemies is done by using the 'throw stuff' icon. The
damage you inflict depends of the weapon you use, your strength, and the weigth of the
item.

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE CLOSEC "Close Combat"

	When you see enemy monsters, you naturally want to mutilate/murder/massacre
them. The easiest way to do this is close combat. 

	To attack an enemy monster you need to walk into the same square it is in.
You also need 10 @{"action points" LINK APS } to do this. You should also have some
melee weapons ready in your hands, like swords or axes. If you do not have items in
your hands, your monster punches with that hand.

	Some monsters have natural weaponry. These weapons are used automatically in
combat, after the weapons in hands.

	If one of the fighters takes too much damage, and his health drops below zero,
that monster dies.

	If the enemy you attack has @{"saved action points" link SAVINGPOINTS} for close combat, the monster
will propably defend itself.

	@{"Close Combat Advanced" link ADVCLOSE}
@ENDNODE

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ADVCLOSE "Close Combat Advanced"

	Damage
	------
		
	The damage of one blow is calculated like this:
	
	The Base Damage Of The Weapon + Your Active Monster's Strength + A Random
	Number From 0 to 7 - The Macho Bonus Of The Enemy - The Armor Bonus Of The
	Enemy
	
	For Example, an one handed sword has a base damage of 10.
	You attack with a warrior, whose strength is 5.
	You get lucky and inflict full +7 random points of damage.
	Your enemy is a pathetic illusionist, with a lousy macho bonus of 1.
	The Illusionist is wearing a leather armor, with a protection of 3 points.
	
	A simple calculation :
	
	10 + 5 + 7 - 1 - 3 = 18 points damage.



	1-Handed weapons vs. 2-Handed weapons
  	-------------------------------------

	Let us assume, that you are attacking an illusionist with two one handed swords.
	Let us also assume, that the illusionist has no armor at all, and your random
	bonus for the blow is average, 4. Your strength is 5, and the base
	damage of the sword is 10. The illusionist has a macho bonus of 1.
	
	Damage: 10 + 5 + 4 - 1 = 18 points damage.
	
	Because you have two swords, you hit agan :
	
	Damage: 10 + 5 + 4 - 1 = 18 points damage.
	
	Summing these two up gives 36 points damage.

	Now, if you had a two handed sword, with a base damage of 27, and you again
	get the average random bonus of 4 :
	
	Damage: 24 + 5 + 4 - 1 = 32
	
	Conclusion : If you get average random bonuses, 1-handed weapons are better.
	But what if you get random bonuses of 0 ?
	
	Damage 2*(10+5+0-1) = 30 points with the two swords, and
	
	Damage 1*(24+5+0-1) = 29 points with the two handed sword

	And if the random bonus is 7 :
	
	2*(10+5+7-1) = 42 points with the two swords, and
	
	1*(24+5+7-1) = 35 points with the two handed sword.
	
	Conclusion : It seems, that two one-handed weapons inflict more damage than
	one two-handed weapon. However, If your enemy is a knight with a plate armor, 
	the situation is very different :
	
	A knight has a macho bonus of 4. The plate armor gives 12 points of protection.
	Let us assume, that you get average random bonuses of 4.
	
	Damage of the one-handed swords:
	
	2*(10+5+4-4-12)=6 points of damage.
	
	Damage of the two-handed sword:
	
	1*(24+5+4-4-12)=17 points of damage
	
	Conclusion: Two handed weapons are much better agains armors, than one-handed
	weapons. Again, if you get random bonuses of 0 :
	
	1-handed swords:
	
	2*(10+5+0-4-12)=-2 (no damage)

	2-handed sword:
	
	1*(24+5+0-4-12)=13 points of damage.
	
	And if you get maximum random bonus of 7 :  	

	1-handed swords:

	2*(10+5+7-4-12)=12 points of damage

	2-handed sword:

	1*(24+5+7-4-12)=20 points of damage
	
	Conclusion : Two handed weapons are indeed much effective against armored
	monsters! If you know what you are up against, you can try to select the
	most effective weaponry.

@NODE WHATSITLIKE "This kind of a game"

	If you have played Laser Squad or Lords of Chaos, you already know something
about Evil. In this game, you control a number or characters, which we will refer to as
'monsters'. The most important objective of the game is to root out all monsters not
controlled by you, the enemies. These enemies are of course, controlled by your friends,
or in some scenarios, the computer. This game is at its best when played by 2-3 people.
There are scenarios for 4 players, but they can last for days...

	The game enviroment is medieval, although there are exceptions. 
@ENDNODE

;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE REQUIREMENTS "Requirements"

	To play this game, you need an aga-amiga, with at least 2+2 megs of memory.
Audio equipment is also heavily recommended. The game uses lots of chip-memory, so
if you have trouble with loading this game, try quitting workbench or closing screens
you do not need.

	The game has been developed on an A4000/040, and we don't test it on other
Amigas. But anyway the game should work just fine on A1200 since we have not heard
complaints with that configuration :)

@NODE INSTALL "Installation"

	Installing Evil is quite simple. If you are reading this text, you have already
unpacked the lzx-archive. Now, the only thing you need to do is to edit the first line
of the 'start' file with your favourite text-editor. You need to give the correct
path for the assign-command. If you do not know where your gamefiles are, you should
read some beginner-manuals before attempting to play this game... Or, read about
the assign-command if you have trouble .. which you propably don't have.

If uoy dot'n knwo hwo to use eht keybroad dotn wrryo.

Anyway, after completing the task, Evil is can be launched from WB normally.

@NODE CONTROLS "Controls"
  	
	The game is played with both the mouse and the keyboard. Mouse is used to 
point icons or monsters, and clicking the buttons. The monsters are moved around the
map using the @{"arrow keys" link ARROWKEYS}.
  
	The Icons are used to do certain actions. Some @{"icons" link ICONS} have two 
actions, activated by the left or right mouse button.
  
	The Map-Window shows a small area of the map, monsters, items, portals etc.
Your active monster is marked with a white border. Holding right mousebutton down on
the map-window allows you to scroll it around. If you click left mousebutton on top
of your own monster, it gets activated. If you click on an enemy, you get some info
about that character. You can see its name, its face-picture, the armor it is wearing,
and the items it holds in its hands. You do NOT see what it has in its backpack! Neither
will you see if it is somehow magically altered, for example if it has drunk a 
protective potion or someting like it.
  
	The bottom of the game screen contains the @{"item-boxes" link ITEMBX}. These
 boxes are used to manipulate items.
@ENDNODE

@NODE ARROWKEYS "Arrow Keys"

	Arrow up    - Monster takes one step forward

@ENDNODE
@NODE ITEMBX "Item Manipulation"

	The game has 13 item boxes with different functions, that look something like 
	this:
	
	
	+---+---+       +---+---+---+---+---+---+       +---+---+   
     <- | 1 | 1 | ->    | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |       | 3 | 3 |        +---+
	+---+---+       +---+---+---+---+---+---+       +---+---+        | 4 |
	                                                | 3 | 3 |        +---+
	                                                +---+---+  


	 (1) GROUND-BOXES
	
	These two boxes are the 'ground-boxes'. If your monster is in a square, which
also contains items, they are shown here. If the items are hidden, they are not shown.
(or drawed on to the map) There are two blue arrows next to these two boxes. These
arrows are used to browse the items, if there are more than 2 items on the ground.
If you click left mousebutton on top of an item here, your active monster picks it up.
(assuming that it has enough action points) When you pick something up, the item
disappears from the ground-box, and the name of the item appears on the screen. The
item is now 'in the mouse pointer'. Now you can click on top of the backpack-boxes (2),
on top of the hand-boxes (3), or on top of the armor box (4). The picture of the item
now appears into the box you clicked. If you try to wear armors that do not fit, you
get an error-message, and the item stays in your mouse-pointer.
  
  	
	(2) BACKPACK-BOXES
  	
	These six boxes	represent your active monster's backpack. You can place items
into these boxes with the mouse. Later, when you need that certain item, you cat take
it from the backpack with the mouse, just click on the top of the item's image you wish
to manipulate. Now the image of the item disappears from your backpack, and the item
is in your mouse-pointer. You can then place it, for example, on the ground, or put it
in your hand. 
	Clicking right mousebutton here shows you the name of the item you point at.
  
  	
	(3) HAND-BOXES
  	
	These four boxes represent your active monster's hands. There are four boxes, 
because some monsters might have more arms than two. If the monster does not have 4
arms, there are red crosses drawn in the boxes it may not use. Some monsters may not
have arms at all, and have red crosses in all four boxes. Manipulating items here is
done exactly like with the backpack-boxes. However, the use of these boxes does not 
cost any action points.
	When you have an item in your hand, you can use it simply just pressing the
right mousebutton on top of the item. Most items can be used to do certain actions,
while some items can not be used in this way.
  
    
	(4) ARMOR-BOX
	
	This box represents your armor. If your active monster has no armor, this box 
contains a picture of a torso. If it has an armor, the image can be seen here. Wearing 
armor is simple, just pick up an armor from a ground box, and then click left mouse 
button over this box. Clicking right mouse button here shows you the name of the armor 
you are wearing.
  
 
	@{"Ethereal Items" link ETHITEMS}

@ENDNODE

;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ETHITEMS "Ethereal Items And Natural Appendages"

	Some monsters possess ethereal items, or natural special functions which are
shown in the place of the four hand-boxes. For example, a beholder has four spell 
casting eyes represented in the hand-boxes. Still, the beholder has no hands, and is
therefore unable to do certain actions. Also, these special items can not be moved into
other boxes. When you try to press left mousebutton on top of an ethereal item, it
does not disappear from the hand-box, but you will see the name of the item on the
screen. These 'ethereal' items also disappear when the monster is killed.

Icon number 0: Active monsters face image 						
-----------------------------------------

	This icon is actually a picture of your active monster (its face). This icon
is only used when controlling a rider and its mount. Clicking left mousebutton on this
icon changes your active monster between the rider or the mount. If your active monster
is not currently riding or used as a mount, this icon has no effect.


Icon number 1:Next / Previous monster
-------------------------------------
	
	Left Mousebutton:
	
	Activates next monster controlled by you. If you have only one monster alive,
	this icon has no effect. Good for checking if all the monsters have been used.
	
	Right Mousebutton:

	Does the same as the left button, but in opposite order.
	
Icon number 2:Birdmap
---------------------	

	This icon has only one function, the birdmap. It shows a much larger part of
the game map than the normal window, and also shows the locations of your troops and
the enemies you know of. Your active monster is represented by a white dot. Other
monsters controlled by you are represented as yellow dots. Enemies are red dots.
Birdmap can be scrolled with arrow keys.

Icon number 3: Mount / Dismount 
-------------------------------	

	Left Mousebutton:

	Ride a mount. If your active monster is in a same square with another monster
you control, it can try to ride it. To able to do this, the mount needs to be large 
enough for the rider, the rider needs to have hands, and the rider must be material.
(Ghosts and other non-material creatures can not ride) Note that you can easily 
swap between the rider and its mount by using the icon number 0 (Face image).
While riding your monsters mount must be active during moving.

	Right Mousebutton:
	
	Dismount. If your active monster is currently riding, this action allows it to 
dismount. If it is not riding, this icon has no effect. While dismounting rider must
be active (naturally). 

Icon number 4: Open / Close
---------------------------	

	This icon has only one function. Clicking left mb allows your monster to
open or close a door or a window directly in front of it.

Icon number 5: Search / Hide
----------------------------	

	Left Mousebutton:
	
	Search. Any hidden items in the same square with your active monster are
revealed. Chests, cupboards, graves, coffins etc. contain items which can be made
available by using this option. Also items concealed with @{"a spell" link O8} or @{"a shovel" link MINES} can
be found.

	Right Mousebutton:
	
	Hide. Your active monster is made invisible to the enemies, if it is currently
in such a square where it can hide. The size of the monster limits hiding. Non-material
and other non-solid monsters are commonly able to hide almost anywhere. Human sized
monsters can hide in bushes, under trapdoors etc. Giants and other large creatures
have major difficulties trying to find a suitable place for lurking. 

Icon number 6: Throw
--------------------

	Throw stuff. This function allows your active monster to throw an item, which
is currently 'storaged' in your mouse pointer. You can throw any items, most often
towards your foes. If your monster is not very strong, it might have difficulties
throwing heavy items.

Icon number 7: Center to active monster
---------------------------------------

	Center to your active monster. Good if you have scrolled the map somewhere,
or used the birdmap.

Icon number 8: Breath / Use natural close-attacks

	Left Mousebutton:

	With this icon you will be able to use your active monster's long ranged
weapons, which would otherwise be visible nowhere. This includes everything
between a dragon's breath of fire, and a snake's venomous spit.

	Right Mousebutton:
	
	Clicking right button here allows your monster to attack against
terrain with its natural weaponry. For example, with this a horse can
break windows with its hooves, and worms can eat doors. 


EndTurn-Icon:
-------------

	Clicking on this icon ends your turn. Time to let your friend take his.

Enemy-Marker:
-------------

	This marker appears when your active monster sees an enemy. Clicking
left mousebutton on this marker centers to the enemy. If there are several
enemies sighted, pressing left mousebutton several times cycles between the
spotted foes.

@ENDNODE

;----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE APS "Action Points"

	Your monsters can only take a limited amount of actions in a single turn. Some
monsters are quicker than others, and can do more in a turn than others. This is
represented by 'action points'. At the beginning of your turn, all of your monsters
should have full action points. Carrying lots of weight can cause your monster to lose
some of its action points immediately, depending of its strength.

	During your turn, your monsters can move around, use items, cast spells etc.
All this @{"costs" link APCOSTLIST} action points. For example, opening a door costs 4 action points, and
picking up an item costs 5 action points. Normal humans have usually about 70 action
points to use, but some slower monsters like zombies, have only 45. When your active
monster has used all of its action points, it can do no more actions in that turn. 
Also, if your active monster has less action points than the action it wishes to do
costs, it may not do it. For example, spellcasting costs 15 action points. If your
active monster has only 14 or less action points left, it may not cast spells, or do
anything that costs over 14 points.

@ENDNODE

@NODE HEALTH "Health Value"

	Your monsters' state of health can vary widely. At the start of the game, they
are generally in perfect condition, but when the battle goes on, they usually get
wounded or die. Some monsters can take much more damage than others. This ability to
withstand damage is represented by the health value. When your monster's health value
becomes negative, it dies. Health value can be increased by the use of @{"magic"link Y3}, or some
@{"healing items" link CONSUMABLES}. 

	Most of the monsters regenerate lost health every turn. For example, warriors
regenerate about 3 points of health each turn, but of course not beyond their maximum
health value. Some other monsters can regenerate much more than 3 points/turn, while
some monsters do not regenerate at all.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MANA "Mana Value"

	Many monsters are able to cast spells. Spells use magic energy, or 'mana'.
This number represents your monster's current power to cast spells. Some spells cost
more mana than others. Easy spells like 'magic missile o'massive mauling' cost only
about 5 points of mana, and the more complex spells like 'fireball of furious flaming'
cost 30 or more points of mana.

	Monsters get more mana in the beginning of each turn, the amount depends
from the @{"intelligence" link ATTRIBUTES} of the monster. For example, master sorcerers regenerate 10
points of mana each turn, while some other monsters might regenerate only 3 points
of mana in a turn.

	We are not responsible for possible damage caused by using this program; 
use it at your own risk. We take no responsibility if someone should view the 
characters in Evil as some kind of rolemodels and pick up a few bad habits.If 
anyone should be killed while using this program, we take no responsibility. 
If somebody goes nuts because of this game, we take no responsibility. If 
somebody actually plays this game, we are greatly surprised.

	People who play this game frequently should send us email. If nobody plays
Evil, we could just as easily drop it and start playing Quake and other stuff like
that. (Yes, we do have PCs with 3d accelerators and shit but we still don't have 
anything close to Evil :) .

@NODE SPREADING "Spreading"

	This game is not shareware. This game is nutware. Whatever that
means is left for you to find out.

	You can copy this package to anybody you want to, if the following conditions
	are met:
                  	
	(1) The package contains all the files
	(2) None of the files are altered
	(3) No money should be earned, only a reasonable price of the disk(s).
	(4) The receiver of the software appears to be sane.

@NODE FUTURE "Future"

	The next version, 1.3 or something, will have a better graphic interface.
That means, that the main-screen gfx have been redrawn. The game window will be
larger, and there is more space for the itemboxes and the text-box, too.

	The date of the 1.3 version is currently unknown.
	
	The next project after the 1.3 version is rumoured to be to start
developing the scenario-editor. It will be very simple at first, but might be
improved afterwards. 

	The map editor will propably be separate from the scenario-editor. That is
because the map editor is by now quite functional, and developing the scenario
editor on top of it does not seem to be a good idea.
