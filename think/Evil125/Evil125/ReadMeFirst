	EVIL 1.25

	Quick info to get you started...

	After you have unpacked the Evil-archive, and copied the contents into
your HD, edit the 'start'-file with a text-editor and write the path for the
game into the assign-line. (Quite simple)

	After this, the game can be started from WB normally. If the game does not
start, try to free chip-memory somehow. For example, reduce the color depth of your
WB. Or, you can start the game from cli by going into the Evil-directory, and writing
execute start.

	Note that the Evil-gamefile is quite long, and unpacked. If you have enough
memory to pack&unpack the gamefile, it is perfectly safe, and you should propably
do so to save some hd-space.
