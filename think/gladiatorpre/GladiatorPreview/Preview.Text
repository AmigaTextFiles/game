     This PREVIEW PACKAGE contains the following:

          File Name      Type           Project Icon Tool
          -------------  ----------     ---------------------
          Preview.Text   ASCII Text     More
          Preview.Hires  IFF ILBM       SYS:Utilities/Display
          Preview.Lace   IFF ILBM       SYS:Utilities/Display

     If  you  are  using  Workbench 2.0+ double clicking the IFF file icons
     will show the pictures.  The screen shots were made while  playing the
     game  in  HiRes (640x200 "Preview.HiRes") and Interlace HiRes (640x400
     "Preview.Lace").  The purpose of this PREVIEW PACKAGE is to allow  you
     to  get a better idea what the software is like before downloading it.
     This  saves  you  money (if you don't download) and it gives me a more
     accurate  idea  of  how many people actually like the software (versus
     liking  the  short  BBS  advertisment)  by  looking  at the software's
     download  count.   Other software distributers:  if you like this idea
     please follow this example.

     In General:

          Gladiator  is  a  strategy  game,  similar to a "chit" wargame or
          boardgame.   You  control  one  or  more characters (which can be
          magic  users  or  fighters) and the computer controls an opposing
          team of monsters.  Play continues until only one side remains.

     Software Requirements:

          Workbench 2.0 or higher is required.

     Hardware Requirements:

          Kickstart 1.3 or higher is required.
          1M or more of RAM is required
          (Gladiator uses about 135K chip RAM and 360K fast RAM).

     Tested Amigas:

          (1) Works on A500 with 1M chip, 7M fast RAM.
          (2) Works on A500 with ECS Denise, FFV II, 2M chip RAM.
          (3) Works on accelerated A500 (MegaMidget Racer 68030 with
              68882 math coprocessor), 2M chip and 4M fast RAM.

          All machines tested had Kickstart 1.3, Workbench 2.0,
          and a SCSI hard disk (GVP for #1, Xetec for #2 and #3).

     System Features:

       <> Options menu (save game, sound effects, speed, quit).
       <> Requester support (when quiting, saving or restoring the game,
                or error information if Gladiator cannot run).
       <> Multitasks (may be run along side other Workbench programs).
       <> Size gadget toggles between full screen and title bar.
       <> Automatically sizes to fit HiRes and interlace HiRes Workbench
          (larger screen sizes will result in an interlace HiRes sized
           Gladiator window).
       <> Hard drive installable.  Gladiator Amiga Version 1.0 takes
          approximately 500K of disk space (the archived file for
          downloading is about 200K).
       <> Fully functional (NOT A DEMO).
       <> Distributable (shareware).

     Game Features:

       <> Characters accumulate points awarded for success in battle
               to gain skills and equipment.
       <> Killed characters may be brought back to life (although
               a 20% penalty is applied to his or her points).
       <> Variety of character races to choose from:
               Mage, Elf, Human, Orc, Dwarf, Goblin
       <> Variety of monsters to slay:
               Needler, Amoeba, Fire Spirit, Phase Spider,
               Slayer, Imp, Behemoth, Evil Mage
       <> Magic users can create a variety of creatures:
               Giant Beetle, Wolf, Giant Scorpion, Troll,
               Gargoyle, Grizzly Bear
       <> Variety of terrain:
               Fire, Pit, Shadow, Wall, Exit, Caltrops, Altar of Life
       <> Variety of weapons, spells, and armor
               (too many to list)
       <> Font character graphics (see "Preview" pictures).
       <> Save and restore game.
       <> Sound effects.
       <> Adjustable message speeds (which are the same on all machines).
       <> High scores display.
       <> 49 page user's manual.

     User Interface:

          The  arena  map  or playfield is displayed from an overhead view.
          The arena map is made up of squares, each of which is the size of
          a  character  (or  a  monster, or an item of terrain).  A menu of
          text  items  is  displayed  beneath the arena map.  One letter of
          each  menu  item  is  highlighted,  indicating the key to type to
          select that menu item (see "Preview" pictures).  The menu area is
          also  used to display messages and roll dice.  Some mouse support
          is   provided  (such  as  selecting  a  bow  target).   The  game
          progresses  on  a  turn  by turn basis and does not require quick
          thinking (no arcade action, only strategy).

     Notes:

          Read  (or  at  least  peruse)  the  user's manual before playing.
          Finding  combinations  of  weapons,  skills,  and spells that are
          effective provides a challenging learning curve.

     Installation Information:

          If  you  choose  to  download  the  Gladiator game, the following
          information  will  be  helpful.   The Amiga Version 1.0 Gladiator
          game  package  is  named "Gladiator1.lha" and was compressed with
          "LhA V1.22"  by Stefan Boberg.   Unarchiving the file will result
          in  the creation of a subdirectory where you are located with the
          name  "Gladiator!".  All necessary files for Gladiator are in the
          "Gladiator!"   directory,   and  no  additional  installation  is
          required.   Gladiator  is  intended to be run from the Workbench,
          but  you may run it from CLI if you wish.  Go to the "Gladiator!"
          directory  and  double  click the "Gladiator" icon, or if you use
          the CLI, go there and enter "Gladiator".

     Background:

          Gladiator  is a pet program I started as a "lark" and it has been
          4  years and three hardware platforms in development.  My friends
          like the game, and I wanted to bring it to the Amiga (my personal
          favorite).   It  is  my  first  worthy Amiga project (can you say
          "gee,  now  that  I  spent all this money on an Amiga development
          system,  maybe  I  should  DO  something  with  it?").  Gladiator
          consists of about 1M of "C" language and it was compiled with the
          SAS/C compiler.

          I hope you enjoy the game!
