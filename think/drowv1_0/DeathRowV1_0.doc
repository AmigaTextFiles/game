    OBJECT:   Defeat your prison pals in a friendly game of puzzle
              solving.  To the victor goes the spoils.  To the loser
              goes the amperage. 

    This program has been tested on an Amiga 500 with one meg of ram,
    an Amiga 1200, and an Amiga 2000.  Hard Drive recommended but not
    required.  1 Meg chip.


    This program is SHAREWARE.  That means spread it around so I can
    become famous.  That also means if you like the game, you should
    register it by sending $15.00 U.S. dollars in check or money
    order (or whatever you think it is worth) to.....

    Startup

    Now double click the Death Row icon.  The starting screens can 
    be skipped by pressing any key.

    You will see a selection screen with buttons to select human and
    computer players.  The buttons will toggle between Amiga and 
    human.  If the button shows 'Amiga',you may also select the 
    intelligence of the computer player by cycling from easy, to 
    average, to genius.  When you are ready, press the 'Play' button.
    If any human players are selected, it will ask you if you are
    a returning champion.  Press 'y' or 'n' on the keyboard.  If you
    are returning, select your name from the list in the middle of the
    screen by highlighting it and pressing the left mouse button.
    If you are a new player.  Enter your name in the box provided, and
    press Return.

    Now the game will start.  When it is your turn, you have the option
    to spin the wheel or solve the puzzle.  After you spin, you may 
    select a letter with the mouse.  You must have at least $1000 in 
    the bank to choose a vowel.  Selecting an incorrect vowel will 
    subtract from your score, but consonants will not hurt you, 
    (Except for the minor jolt of electricity of course). 

    Puzzles may be solved using the keyboard or clicking on each letter 
    with the mouse (just fill in the missing letters).
