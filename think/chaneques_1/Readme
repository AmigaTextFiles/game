     INSTRUCTIONS   
     ============

Loading the Game
================

This program come in two  diskettes:  one named Chan an  another  named
Fases.  To  start,  insert  Chan  on  drive  DF0:  and Fases on DF1: if
available  (if  you  do  not  have an external unit,  then wait for the
program to ask you a couple of disk swaps). A standard workbench screen
will appear,  double click the Chan disk, and the Chaneques program. If
you  want  to  install  the  game  in  your  hard disk double click the
InstallHD icon.

Starting
========

Everything will be ready when you see a dancing spider on a wall. Use a
joystick connected to port 1 to move between options. Push the joystick
button  to  pick  a  choice.  'Begin'  to start the game from the first
level, 'Info'  to see information about the autors and the program, and
'Code' to key in a code  for a specific  level (this codes are given to
you  at  the  end  of  each  succesful  level).  The chaneques are also
controlled with the joystick.

And now?
========

The goal of the game  is to steal all the things you can find on screen
(TV's,  chocolates,  diskkettes,  books,...)  by pushing them through a
interdimensional  door  (commonly  known  as Chandra), but this must be
done before the rooster sings (this one sings by midday). Each chaneque
(whose name are Chanok, Chencho, and Chepo) has distinctive habilities.
