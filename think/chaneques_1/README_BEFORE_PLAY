Hello PD user.

In order to play this game you must:

1. Make sure that all files were descompresed in root directory
   of a floppy disk, and descompresed with full path.

2. Relabel disk 1 as CHAN,   (disk 2 must be relabel as FASES)

3. Make it bootable

4. Copy necesary system files fron your Workbench to CHAN disk:

   FILE TO COPY                   COPY TO:
   -----------------------        ------------
   sys:libs/diskfont.library      chan:libs
   sys:libs/icon.library          chan:libs
   sys:devs/ramdrive.device       chan:devs
   sys:devs/MountList.device      chan:devs
   sys:l/ram-handler              chan:l
   sys:c/wait                     chan:c
   sys:c/loadWB                   chan:c
   sys:c/iconx                    chan:c
   sys:c/cd                       chan:c
   sys:c/copy                     chan:c
   sys:c/echo                     chan:c
   sys:c/endcli                   chan:c
   sys:c/assign                   chan:c
   sys:c/more (or utilities/more) chan:c
   sys:c/run                      chan:c

5. Uncompress the chan_2.lha file to a disk called FASES


That's all. Now reset the machine an boot with CHAN disk.

ENJOY THIS GREAT GAME!
