*****************************************************************************

This program is at working beta stage. Please report bugs and feature requests
to the author (amithlondestek@gmail.com).

Features:
*********
- You can create/save/load/edit puzzle packs.
- Puzzle sizes from 5x5 upto 50x50 (sizes are always multiple of 5) as
  supported by the current version of AmiNonogram v1.0.

Publishing puzzles:
*******************
If you are going to publish puzzle packs please consider the following:
- AmiNonogram distinguishes puzzle packs by their file names. Please choose a
  unique and distinctive one.
- Always keep the ".non" file extension on your puzzle packs.
- Do not publish empty puzzle packs (duh)!
- Current version of puzzle pack files can contain up to 65536 puzzles per
  size. Never overflow this!
- Puzzle packs have 2 byte version information as: VERSION.RELEASE
  (ie: 1.23 means version 1, release 23). Both values are between 0 - 255.
- If you are going to re-release an updated version of a previously released
  puzzle pack, for better player experience:
  * Please do not remove puzzles. Just add new ones. If you really have to
    remove a puzzle from a pack for a reason, just edit it to something
    different.
  * Please do not re-order puzzles. It doesn't make sense, players will be
    introduced your puzzles randomly anyway.
  * Publish it with an incremented release number.
  * If you re-release a puzzle pack with an incremented version number or with
    a different file name AmiNonogram will treat it as a completely unsolved
    new puzzle pack. So take care of your version and release values before
    publishing.
- If you want to add ownership information to a puzzle pack you can use the
  file comment (do not forget to use option -a when archiving with lha).

Have fun!
