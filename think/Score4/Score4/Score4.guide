@node How2Start "Starting a Game"
    Before you can actually play the game, you need to select which binary
to use.  In the current release there are two included.  One is for 68000
users and the other is for 68020+ users.  If your Amiga has only a 68000 or
a 68010, you will need to use the "Score4.68000" binary.  If you have a
68020 or better, you should use the "Score4.68020" binary.

    The easiest way to start the game of Score4 is to just double-click on
the icon.  Once this has been done, a requester with four gadgets will be
presented.  Each of these gadgets corresponts to one of the following play
modes:

H vs H  - Human versus human
H vs C  - Human (player one) versus the computer (player two)
C vs H  - The computer (player one) versus human (player two)
C vs C  - The computer versus the computer

Score4 can also be run from the CLI.

@node How2Play "How to Play Score4"

    Score4 is a simple strategy game that plays much like the classic game
"Connect Four."  In this game, however, there is a twist.  Rather than
playing on a flat, two-dimensional board, Score4 is played on a
three-dimensional board.

    Players take turns selecting one of the 16 pegs to place a piece on.
Once a piece has been placed it drops to the lowest of the four potential
positions on the peg.  Once a peg has been filled with four pieces, it can
have no more pieces added to it.  A move is selected by clicking on one of
the 16 gadgets located below the game board in the Score4 window.  Once a
peg is full, its gadget will be ghosted to show that it is no longer
available.

    The game is over as soon as one of the players manges to get four of
their pieces in a row.  The six possible ways that this can happen are
depicted below.

@node How2Win "Tips and Tricks for Winning"
    The strategy involved in the game of Score4 is surprisingly complex.
There are a number of subtle issues surrounding the winning techniques of
this game that I will attempt to cover in this section.  Please keep in
mind, however, that I am by no means an expert at this game.  I have
actually only been playing it for about three weeks.

    There are two fundemental techniques that frequently lead to victory
that I call "traps" and "multiples."  These techniques are actually not
unlike "discovered check" and "forks" in chess.  If you are familiar with
these techniques, you will have a strong advantage in Score4.

@{b}Traps@{ub}

    A trap is perhaps the most dangerous construct in the whole game.  It
is also, however, one of the most difficult to set up.  The basic priciple
is that in order for a player to block a four in a row on the current turn,
he will set up another for the next turn.  For example, consider the trap
that the X player has set here:

X       |       |       |      
X |     | |     | |     |    
O X |   | | |   | | |   | | |  
X O | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
  X | |   | | |   | | |   | | |
    | |     | |     | |     | |
      X       |       |       |

In order for the O player to avoid defeat on the current turn, he must
block at position (1,0).  However, by doing so he sets the X player up for a
win on his next turn.

    Fortunatly the computer AI does not often set traps.  When it does so,
it is purly coincidental.  By the same token, the AI can usually prevent a
trap from being set.  The quickest that I have ever been able to set a trap
for the computer ended the game on round 16.

@{b}Multiples@{ub}

    The multiple, or multi-way, is another sure fire road to victory that
is very difficult to set up.  The priciple here is that by making one move
a player creates two unblocked three in a rows.  This creates a situation
where the other player would need to make two block with one move.  Clearly
a difficult situation.  Consider the following game board:

|       |       |       |      
| |     | |     | |     | |    
| | |   | | |   | | |   | | |  
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
  X | |   | | |   | | |   | | |
    X |     | |     | |     | |
      |       X       X       |

By moving to position (0,0), the X player will assure vicory on the next
round, assuming that the O player doesn't obtain victory first.  The
example situation is very unrealistic.  I would have to assume that a
player who would get into such a situation must be drunk.  There are,
however, very realistic situations where the multiple comes into play.  For
example, the following board shows the X player not only blocking the
foolish O player, but snatching victory right out of his hands:

|       |       |       |      
| |     | |     | |     X |    
| | |   | | |   | X |   O | |  
X | | | | | | | | O | | O | | |
  X | |   | X |   O | |   | | |
    | |     O |     | |     | |
      |       |       |       |

@{b}Other Hints@{ub}

    There are a couple of other techniques that I have noticed often lead
to victory.  The most obvious is the occupation of the corners.  I have
noticed while watching computer versus computer that the player who
occupies three or four of the lowest level corners wins nearly 90% of the
games.  The reason for this appears to simply be that there are more ways
to win with the use of the corners.

    Another issue is the selection of a good set of opening moves.  I have
found that it is very useful early on to use a set of moves that give a
good spread of the game board but that don't build any two or three in a
rows.  One open that I find works very well agains both humans and the
computer AI is the following:

|       |       |       |      
| |     | |     | |     | |    
| | |   | | |   | | |   | | |  
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
  | | |   | | |   | | |   | | |
    | |     | |     | |     X |
      |       |       X       |

At this point the selection of the next move depends totally on what the
other player has done with his first two moves.  However, the next move is
typically either (3,0), (0,3), or (1,2).  Often if I use (3,0) as my third
move, my fourth will be to either (0,0) or (3,3).  The general tactic is to
not build anything until a large number of things can be build with one
move.  The result is that the other player needs to use a lot of moves to
block a large number of potential victories.

    This section is quite probably both the most complete and the most
incomplete in all of the Score4 documentation.  I think that it will
provide a good start for developing winning techinques for this game.  As I
play this game more and hear from other who play, I am sure that this
section will continue to grow.

@node History "History of Score4"
    The concept-to-completion for Score4 is kind of interesting.  It all
started on August 3rd, 1995, when Steve Chapel (schapel@zonker.cs.ucsb.edu)
posted a challenge to comp.programming.contests detailing a simple game
played on a 4x4 grid of posts.  The basic idea was to implement a version
of this game, which he called "Score Four," that was unbeatable.  I thought
that the idea was sort of interesting, so I filed the article away.

    About a week after that, a friend of mine came to me asking to suggest
a simple project for him to write.  I immediately thought of Score4.  I
suggested that he write a simple two player version of the game, then
possibly implement AI for it.  At that time I decided that I should also
write a version of the game so that I would be able to offer real advise,
should he need it.

    I started writing the game that night, and in just over two hours I had
a fully functional ASCII graphics version of the two player game.  I spent
about thirty minutes playing the game against myself to make sure that all
of the routines were working correctly.  In that short time I came to a
startling realization:  this game is fun!

    With this in mind, I decided that I had to write AI so that I would
have someone to play the game against!  The AI took about eight hours to
write, and seems to work pretty well.  Once I had spent this much time on
it, I decided that I might just as well make a GUI and some documentation
for it and turn this simple project into some sort of a product.

    After all that, the game that you have before you exists.  It's not
perfect, but it is here!  The current version of the AI uses a simple
minimax algorith and a very simple heuristic.  The next version should have
a better heuristic and use Alpha-Beta pruning.  The GUI uses only
gadtools.library and intuition.library, and is totally font sensitive.  The program
was written using GCC 2.6.

    As you may have already noticed, there are two versions of this
program.  There is one for 68000's and one for 68020's.  The 68000 version
is included only for completeness.  Since it takes about 9 seconds to
generate a move on my A3000 25, I do not even want to think about how long
it would take on a stock A500.  I would, however, be interested in hear
about how long it take the AI to generate moves on various configurations.

Enjoy!
