  Vanilla Tetris v1.02 (C)1997 by Iain King


      This is @{"Shareware" LINK shareware}


  Why another version of Tetris?  Who knows.  I just wanted to see if I could
make one, and also because I couldn't find a standard Tetris game.  I've got
Tetris Pro, but it has silly power ups (though the music is cool).  So this
is my attempt.

   This Tetris is programmed in Blitz Basic 2, which was made by those cool
dudes at Acid software.  Wahey!

   This program was tested on an A1200, because surprisingly enough, thats
what I've got.  It should run on any Amiga at full speed.  It might not on a
500/500+/600, but I can't test it so tough.  It should run fine, just maybe
slower.  

   N.B. I haven't implemented any music, mainly because music in games is
usually really annoying, and if you want to listen to music, you stick your
Hi-Fi on.  If you want you can switch the sound fx off as well.  I've
integrated Tetris' sound control with your Television/Speakers.  Simply turn
the volume control on your respective device to 0 and the sound will stop
itself until you turn the volume back up.


   Feel free to send me your palette's/block designs - if they're any good
(lets face it - they'll be better then mine) I'll put them in the next
release.

   Controls.
   --------

      A joystick in port 1 (the joystick port) or the cursor keys may be
      used to control Tetris.

      In the menus <Fire> and <Return> activates.

      In game, <Fire>, <Up-Arrow> and <Right Shift> rotate the shape around
      Left/Right move shape left/right
      Down drops shape

@node play

   How to play?
   ------------
       After double clicking on tetris, a screen should open up at a menu,
showing you four options:


      Start
      -----

         Simple - starts the game


      Normal
      ------

         This is showing that the difficulty is set at 'normal'.
         Hitting it will cycle it through 'normal' 'hard' and 'very hard'
         difficulty settings.

         The difficulties work like this:

            'normal'       Go up a level every 20 lines
            'hard'         Go up a level every 10 lines
            'very hard'    Go up a level every 05 lines
            'impossible'   Go up a level every 01 line

         Level ranges from 1 to 50, where fifty is ludicrously fast (block
         goes down a row every 1/50th of a second)

         There is a seperate score table for each level.

      Colour
      ------

      Hitting this toggles it between 'colour' and 'black'.
      Switches the backdrop colour.  'colour' generally looks nicer, but
'black' offers higher contrast (and maybe a smaller headache from watching
the screen to long).


      Quit
      ----

      Saves high score table to current directory then quits


    N.B.  @{"BiTetris" LINK bitetris}  has a couple other menus

@endnode

@node tetris

   The game of Tetris
   ------------------

   Once you hit start you're into Tetris properly. I'll briefly sum up what
it's about for both of you who don't know.

   A randomly determined block appears at the top of the screen ( you can
see what the next block is in the view window to the top-left).  It will
start moving downward, and you will be able to guide it left and right and
rotate it. When the block reaches the bottom, or lands on top of another
block, it will sit there and another block will appear at the top of the
screen for you to control.  This goes on until the screen is filled at which
point its game over.  BUT WAIT!  The whole point is, that if you manage to
lay the blocks so that an entire row is filled (i.e. a horizontal row with
no gaps), it will disappear, and all the blocks above it will fall down into
the space.  So all you have to do is keep making lines to stay alive for as
long as possible.  Sounds simple don't it? :)

   A couple of hints:

       1) If your block won't rotate, it's probably because there is
          something next to it stopping it : move it away from any obstacles

       2) A block doesn't land the second it touches something below it - you
          can still slide it for a couple of moments.

       3) because of 2, if you've left an overhang, you can slide a block
          under it to fill the gap.

       4) The more lines you get at once, the more points you get for doing
          it, and there is a special bonus for completely clearing the
          screen.

@node bitetris

   The game of BiTetris
   --------------------

   BiTetris is the two-player equivelant of Tetris.  Both players play at
once on two seperate boards (one uses keys, other joystick), and no scores
 are recorded.  Instead, the winner is simply the person who does not die,
i.e. the one who lasts longest.  As soon as one person dies, the game stops.
 Of course, this isn't just abouut survival, oh no!  If you get more than
a single line (i.e. a double, triple or a tetris) then your opponent recieves
that many lines minus one.  i.e. if you get


   a double             he gets 1 line
   a triple             he gets 2 lines
   a tetris             he gets 3 lines

   He recieves these lines next time he puts down his block, and they appear
at the bottom of his board, forcing the blocks on the board upwards.  If any
block goes off the top of the board then the player dies.

   N.B.   If you were to get, say, two Tetris' before he put his block down,
then they *would* add up.  i.e. next time he put the block down he would get
six lines.  If you were lucky enough and quick enough you could kill him
*very* quickly (if you got something like 3 or 4 Tetris' in a row)



   Menus
   -----

   There are a few extra menus :


      get n
      -----

      This is basically how full the lines are that your opponent gets when
yu get doubles/triples/tetris'.  The number of blocks filled in in the line
will average out to this number.  ex:

      if set to 5 and you scored a tetris' then it might come out like this:


            |          |
            |#  # ## # |
            | ### #    |
            | # # ###  |
            \----------/

      whereas set to 9 it would be more likely to come out as this:


            |          |
            |#### ## ##|
            |###### ###|
            | #########|
            \----------/


         passover/no passover
         --------------------

      Toggles the restriction that stops lines you give your opponent being
full.  if 'no passover' is selected then the max number of blocks in a line
you give your opponent will be 9.  If 'passover' is selected then 10 blocks
in the line will be possible (i.e. the line could be full).  The reason this
is called passover is that if its on (i.e. 'passover' selected) and you got,
say, a tetris', and it filled up 2 of the lines your opponent recieved,
thenyou would get one back! (because he just got a double).  The lines
passed back over to you.

      With this on it's perfectly possible to kill yourself, especially if
'get' is set at 9 (which will fill lines approximately 35% of the time).


        swap scores
        -----------

      Swaps the number of wins per player around.  Handy if you want to
switch controls after a while (cramp or some system of 'fairness').  Both
players have to hit fire on this one.


@endnode

@node block

   The BlockDesign program
   -----------------------


   Not everyone's tastes are the same (mine vary according to what day it is),
so Tetris has an option that allows you to use a different set of blocks.
The different sets of blocks are stored in the 'blocks/' sub directory,
which should be in the same dir as the Tetris program.  BlockDesign should
also be in the same dir as the Tetris program.  When you click on it it will
pop up a file requester (in the blocks dir) asking you to select a blocks
file.  It should contain (to start with) something like:

      checked
      plain
      colour-square
      square
      torn
      marble
      stone
      gold

   These are the blocks supplied with Tetris

   Double clicking on one of these will copy it into the tetris.shapes file
in the Tetris program directory, selecting the block set.*
   If, in the blocks dir there is also a relevant palette file for the block
file you selected, this will also be copied to the Tetris program dir.  I.E.
if you select 'torn' and 'torn.pal' exists, then this will also be copied

   *.  If you want to have a smaller installation, simply delete the blocks
directory and the BlockDesign program, making sure you have a valid
tetris.shapes file in the tetris program directory (run Tetris - if it
works, you've got the file).

   The BlockDesign program is not a necessary file for tetris to work (see
bottom bit for a list of necessary files)

@endnode

@node grabber

   The Grabber program
   -------------------

   You may be thinking: Having the BlockDesign thingy is all very nice, but
all his blocks are shit, and you'd basically be right (I am *not* a very good
artist), but cheer up - you can draw your own blocks to use.

   In the Tetris program directory there should be a 'gfx' dir containing a
tetris.iff picture file.
   This is a template, and what you should use to draw your own blocks.
(It is actually the picture file that the 'plain' block set was grabbed off
of).

   To create your own blocks, simply do this:

   1)   Load up DPaint (or whatever you use), with a screen format of
320x256x16 colours.

         The colours work like this:

            0     Background
            1     Block Shadows
            2     Block Middle colour dark
            3     Block Middle colour light
            4     Block Highlight
            6     Menu Text
            7     Menu Shadow
            8     Menu Highlight

       10-14      Use as you want

          N.B. colours 2 & 3 can really be used for anything, but note that
 it is these colours that are dithered together in BiTetris to make the sent
 over lines.

         The palette on the tetris.iff file should give you an idea.
          More info on changing the @{"palette" LINK palette}

   2)   Load up the tetris.iff file.  You should see collection of 3d blocks.

   3)   Draw your designs.  You should keep the same shape as the ones
given, and its a good idea to keep the shapes with the 3d edges, as Tetris
has some in built 3d stuff, and will act like the blocks are 3d even if they
are not.  If you dont want 3d, then the only solution is to set the palette
for colours 1 & 4 to the same RGB, and use one of them as a 2d border round
the blocks.

      *DO NOT MOVE THE BLOCKS ABOUT*
      Grabber needs the blocks to be in the correct position.
      DO NOT MOVE THE BLOCKS - draw inside them.

      The easiest way to do this is to draw your design on the first block
of each set, then using brush and rotate functions, paste it over the rest.
It is possible to use the same brush for all the L shapes, ditto for the S
shapes, by using the mirror function.

      Once you've done that, switch to a reserve screen and load up the
gfx/borders.iff file.  This is all the outlines of the shapes.  Grab it as a
brush, switch back to your picture, and paste it over your shapes - instant
3D!

   N.B. Blitz can't handle iff's that have been saved with a stencil, so
don't.

   4)   Save your picture in the 'gfx' dir, as something like
              'myblocks.iff'

   5)   Run the Grabber program

   6)   The first requester should open out into the 'gfx' dir.
        In it select your picture file 'myblocks.iff'

   7)   In the second requester, it should automatically have opened into
        your 'blocks' directory.  If not then find your blocks dir, then
        type in a filename at the prompt : this will be what your block set
        is called.

   8)   Grabber should load your picture, scan for the blocks, then save
        them.  Once you hit the mouse, it will clear the screen, then
        reload them.  If they all appear OK on the screen it should have
        worked.  Hit the mouse again to exit.

         N.B. grabber will also save your pictures palette to the relevant
         palette file in the blocks dir.

   9)   Run BlockDesigner, and double click on you block set

  10)   Run Tetris and start a game - you should have your own little set
        off blocks. Aren't they nice?

  11)   If your blocks are nicer than mine (it wouldn't be hard would it?)
        then you can @{"send" LINK address} me your blocks.

@endnode

@node palette

       Changing the palette
       --------------------

   The colour info for Tetris is kept in the 'tetris.pal' file in the Tetris
program dir.  it looks like this:

         0     Background
         1     Block Shadows
         2     Block Middle colour dark
         3     Block Middle colour light
         4     Block Highlight
         5     White
         6     Menu Text
         7     Menu Shadow
         8     Menu Highlight
         9     Menu Text Highlight
         10    Null
         11    Null
         12    Null
         13    Null
         14    Null
         15    Menu Background Highlight

   You cannot set colours 5,9,15 as they are reset by the program.  You can
edit all the rest.  
   You can do his easily enough - just load the palette file into DPaint (or
whatever) and change the values, then save.

   There is a file: 'gfx/palette.iff' that displays a menu and a block - handy
for designing your palette.

   NOTE
   ----

   Some (all) of the blocks in the blocks dir have .pal palette files.
BlockDesign will copy these over onto tetris.pal as well as the actual shape
file.  Either delete the block.pal files, or change them instead of the
tetris.pal file, or keep a backup of your palette in the defaults directory.

    The recommended method is to edit the block.pal files, as each block set
  works best with a palette designed for it (if you used the 'plain' palette
  with the 'marble' blocks it would look *so* crap)

   If you manage to loose your blocks/palette, the default ones are in the
defaults directory - simply copy them across.

@node shareware

      Vanilla Tetris is Shareware.  If you play it a lot (which hopefully
lots of you will), you should send @{"me" LINK address} some money.  5 pounds sterling (8
dollars I think) sounds about right to me for the phase reversal that
resulted from writing this (I ended up awake/asleep in the wrong 12-hour
cycle, with the Flu).  You can send the money to the address below.
Please support Shareware, as some authors will stop writing cool stuff
if you don't.
(I won't, but thats no reason not to send me money)

  Do note that if I don't get very much money out of this, I won't release the
bug fixes and/or upgrades.

   Bugs
   ----

   There is a bug with the keyboard - it occasionally locks up.  I'm 99%
sure that this is Blitz's fault and not mine, so don't bother telling me
about this one.  If it severely annoys you then
      a) pretend its a random difficulty enhancer
      b) use the (eurch) joystick , or (in BiTetris)
      c) a leveller because the other player has to put up with the joystick

   I get really happy if people report bugs to me, so please do.
