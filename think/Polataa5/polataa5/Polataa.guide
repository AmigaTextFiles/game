You  play this game at your own risk! We don't take any responsability what so
ever!

I, Mopz, love breakout games. They're the most wonderful things ever invented.
This  version  is  not much different from any other, but I tried to make it a
bit  more  puzzlish than regular breakouts. The name Polataa, btw, was made up
by my good old friend Mikael "Nihao" Martinsson, and I think he did a good job
:)
   If you have something to say about this game, please send me an e-mail!

This  game  is now mailware. If you send me an e-mail, you get the keyfile for
free.  But  if you send me a snailmail, you've got to add a disc and money for
stamps; don't expect me to pay YOU for the game!

@node 3 "A jolly good story"

                            @{b}* A JOLLY GOOD STORY *@{UB}

The  atoms  on earth got pissed off, because the humans wouldn't stop cleaving
them  (a  way  of  extracting energy). So, those little round and jolly things
mutated into dangerous @{i}macho-macro-atoms@{ui} (mamas).
   The  atoms didn't realize tho' what a totaly stupid move that was; all of a
sudden  ANY  man  with a saw - or a hammer - could cleave the jolly things and
build nukeys.
   Your  mission, as an excellent world rescuer, is to dismutate all mamas. As
you  may  already  have  guessed,  the only way to do that is with a bat and a
ball.

The world is counting on you!

@node 5 "How to play"

                               @{b}* HOW TO PLAY *@{ub}

@{b}What to do:@{ub}
   Mamas  and other things are hidden inside bricks. To release hidden things,
you  must  therefor  break  bricks.  When all mamas on a level are dismutated,
you'll be transported to the next level.

@{b}Control:@{ub}
   Mouse up/down     - Move bats (one on each side of the screen) up/down
   <P>               - Pause 
   <Esc>             - Quit
   <F1>              - Next level
   Left mousebutton  - Unpause/Shoot
   Right mousebutton - Aim
   <SPACE>           - Tilt - good if the ball gets stuck...

@{b}Shoot:@{ub}
   The first thing you need to do when you're at a new level, is to shoot away
the  ball.  Until  you press left mousebutton you may move the ball up/down in
line  with  the  bat with right button. This way, you can aim pretty good. The
more centered on the bat the ball is, the lower will the shooting angle be.

@{b}Bricks:@{ub}
   A  normal  brick  is in a clean colour, while special bricks (often hidden)
look  like,  uhm, other things. You'll have to figure the symbols out for your
self;  I'll  only  tell  you  what  there is. You loose all your specials when
entering a new level.

Big bat    - Makes bat bigger.
 
Speed up   - Speed up for ball.

Speed down - Speed down for ball.

Gravity    - The  ball's  vertical  direction will constantly increase towards
             the 'ground'. Gravity disappears if you get Magnetic.           

Magnetic   - The  bat's  center  will  work  as  a  magnet verticaly. Magnetic
             disappears if you get Gravity.

Hard       - All bricks will take no more than one hit.

Ice        - Makes ball blue (purple if you've got Fire), so that you can kill
             ice-mamas.

Fire       - Makes  ball  red (purple if you've got Ice), so that you can kill
             fire-mamas.

Black hole - Won't be destroyed when you hit it. It moves the ball back to the
             bat.

Red lock   - Will only be destroyed if you've got Red key.

Green lock -                   -                  Green key. 

Blue lock  -                   -                  Blue key.

Red key    - With it you can destroy Red locks.

Green key  -            -            Green locks.

Blue key   -            -            Blue locks.

Score 50   - Gives ya 50 points.

Score 100  - Gives ya 50 points.

@{b}Mamas:@{ub}
   They all take two hits, but some of 'em demands special balls. Mamas starts
moving around when you find them. They can be a bit tricky to hit, but learn
how to aim, and it'll work fine :)

@node 6 "The full version"

                             @{b}* THE FULL VERSION *@{ub}

New  versions  will  be  spread out as they come. The keyfile you get when you
register  will  always  work  (I  hope...).  The  only  difference between the
registered and the unregistered version is that you can never play more than 8
levels in the unregistered. The keyfile, however, must @{b}NOT@{ub} be spread out!

@node 7 "History"

                                 @{b}* HISTORY *@{ub}

@{b}98-07-10:@{ub} Started working on P5

@{b}98-07-26:@{ub} Released v.00b

@{b}98-07-31:@{ub}  Sent  v.01 to CU Amiga Magazine (together with lots of other games,
for  their  disk).  Also uploaded it to Aminet, but without the CUAM exclusive
keyfile.  Better  bounces against bricks, one more ingame-tune, tilt-funktion,
keyfile-support.

@{b}98-10-25:@{ub} V.02. No improvements really. Just converted the music to MED-format
and  added some levels that had been sent to me by a few players. No plans for
further releases.
