 @{b}SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS@{ub}

   Requires Kickstart 2.0 or higher.

   Any Amiga from A500 to A4000.
      · If your machine has WB3.0+, the program asks the system
         for the video mode that most closely matches 640x480,
         64 colors (VGA Productivity).  This results multiscan
         if available, or Euro72, DblPAL, PAL hires-lace, etc...
         On ECS machines, this may even use your graphics card
         if made available to Intuition.
      · With WB2.x, or if 64 color hires mode is not available,
         a 16 color hires-lace screen is opened in the default
         mode that the computer was booted in (NTSC or PAL).

For full speed and visual effect, I highly recommend use on AGA machines.

 @{b}PROGRAM DESCRIPTION@{ub}

Slider is a puzzle similar to
those little number slide puzzles we have all played with at one
time or another. This version features a nice high res marble
background with embossed wood pieces. The size of the puzzle
is adjustable in width and height.

The object is to move the pieces as quickly as possible until they are
in numerical order. You move pieces by pointing to the piece you want 
to move, and pressing the left mouse button.  If  there is a blank space
in the row  or column of the piece you click on.

Click here to see the @{"archive contents." link "Archive Contents" 0}

 @{b}FEATURES@{ub}


·  Width and height are individually adjustable from 2 to 8 pieces.

·  Different graphics may be loaded in place of the default puzzle
   pieces. Standard IFF pictures may be used.

·  Sounds are in standard 8SVX format.

·  Best 5 times for the puzzle are shown.

·  The computer can solve the puzzle for you.

·  Sound allocation is system friendly. You can play  tunes  with  your
   favorite mod-player while playing Slider.

·  Enhanced graphics for AGA users or WB3.1 users with graphics cards.

·  Preferences are saved as icon tooltypes.

 @{b}INSTALLATION@{ub}

This archive decompresses into its own drawer.  Just copy or move the 
drawer and its icon into whatever directory you want to keep it in (simple).


 @{b}PROGRAM USAGE@{ub}

To run, just double-click its icon.  Slider will display a @{"scoreboard" link "Score Display" 0}, 
the puzzle, and some @{"gadgets" link "Gadgets" 0}.  Clicking on the SHUFFLE gadget 
will reset the clock to 0 and shuffle the puzzle pieces.  Just select 
with the mouse which piece you want to slide and that piece will move
(if it can).  The clock starts when the first piece is moved.  The clock
will stop when the puzzle is back in numerical order.  Your time and
number of moves will be recorded in the high scores display.

All gadgets on the main screen have @{"keyboard shortcuts" link "Keyboard" 0}.

When a puzzle is solved, the blank space is filled in with the last piece 
to show you the completed picture.

Slider may also be run from a shell.  Just type its path if its not in your
current directory and name.  Slider does not take any arguments from the 
command line.

 @{b}THE SCORE DISPLAY@{ub}

The large green display  is  the  time  elapsed  (accurate  to  1/10th
of a second) with  the  smaller  green numbers  being  the size of the
puzzle and the number of moves made.

The  red   displays   underneath   the   green   ones   indicate   the
last 5 quickest scores  for  solving  the  current puzzle.  This table
is cleared whenever  a  new size  puzzle  or  different   picture   is
selected.

A  character  is  displayed  to   the   left   of   the   moves   count
to indicate what mode  the game is in.  A "C" indicates the computer is
solving or has solved the puzzle.  A "P" indicates the game is  paused.

 @{b}MAIN SCREEN GADGETS@{ub}

There are 6 gadgets above the score display. Keyboard shortcuts are 
also shown. They are:

@{b}QUIT@{ub}:    @{b}Q@{ub}  - Quits the game.  (Imagine  that...  :)
   or <@{b}Esc@{ub}>

@{b}OPTIONS@{ub}: @{b}O@{ub}  - Opens the options window for  adjusting
              game  parameters. (See @{"THE OPTIONS WINDOW" link "Options Window" 0} page.)

@{b}PAUSE@{ub}:   @{b}P@{ub}  - Stops the clock until another piece is
              moved or PAUSE is clicked again.

@{b}SOLVE@{ub}:   @{b}S@{ub}  - Signals the computer to solve  the  puzzle
              for you! (Clicking it again will put the
              game in PAUSE mode so you can finish it.)
              Note that if the computer does not attempt
              to solve an incomplete puzzle, then the
              puzzle is unsolvable.

@{b}HELP@{ub}:    @{b}H@{ub}  - Display what the finished puzzle looks like for
  or <@{b}Help@{ub}>   2  seconds.  This is very helpful with pictures
              that don't have numbers.

@{b}SHUFFLE@{ub}:    - Shuffles the pieces around and resets the clock
  <@{b}spacebar@{ub}>  to 0.  The clock starts when you move your first
              piece. The larger the puzzle, the longer the
              shuffling takes.

@endnode

@node "Options Window" "Options Window"
 @{b}THE OPTIONS WINDOW@{ub}

This allows you to customize the puzzle. The gadget descriptions and
keyboard short cuts are:

@{b}PUZZLE SIZE@{ub}: <W>,<H>  - You can select any combination of width
and height (from 2 to 8) for the number of puzzle pieces.

@{b}VISIBLE SHUFFLE@{ub}: <V>  - When checked, you get to watch the pieces
get shuffled on the screen.  If not checked, the new new puzzle will
appear instantly when SHUFFLE is is pressed.

@{b}ALWAYS SOLVABLE@{ub}: <A>  - This determines what method  is  used  to
shuffle  the pieces. If checked, the computer will start with a solved
puzzle and then randomly move the pieces around. The number  of  moves
depends on the size of the puzzle.

When this is not checked, the computer will start with an empty puzzle
and drop pieces in random places in the puzzle.  This is very quick, 
but the resulting puzzle may not always be solvable.

@{b}QUICK SOLVE@{ub}: <Q>      - This selects  what  speed  the  @{"computer" link "The Brain" 0}
will solve a puzzle. When checked, it solves it as fast as it can (up to
60 moves/sec.) If left unchecked,  the  computer will solve the puzzle
no faster than 10 moves/second.

@{b}NUMBERS@{ub}: <N>          - When this is checked, the  program  will  add  a
number  to  each  piece indicating the order of the puzzle. This makes
solving pictures much more simple.

@{b}GRID LINES@{ub}: <G>       - Selecting this will cause slider to add shine
and  shadow  lines  to  the puzzle pieces to make each piece stand out
more.

@{b}FILENAME@{ub}: <F>         - The text gadget allows for entering the name of
an  IFF  picture  to  load  for  the puzzle pieces. The File requester
gadget is there to pop up an ASL file requester from  which  the  file
can   be   chosen.   (See   @{"Picture Restrictions"   link   "Picture Restrictions" 0}.)

@{b}TILETYPE@{ub}: <T>         - This MX gadget let's you specify what order the
pieces  should  be  shown  in. If the picture file chosen has numbered
pieces such as the default 'NumberedTiles_xx.iff" file, then 'Numbers'
should  be  selected.  If  the  file  is  just  a picture, then choose
'Picture'.

* When a  new  file  is  entered,  this  gadget  will  set  itself  to
'Numbered'  if  the  filename starts with the letters 'num'. Otherwise
'Picture' will be selected.

@{b}SAVE@{ub}: <S>   - This saves your options to Slider's icon as @{"ToolTypes"  link "ToolTypes" 0}.
If the Slider icon is missing, one will be created using the image of
your default tool icon.  These saved settings will still be there next
time you run Slider.

@{b}USE@{ub}: <U>    - This uses your current settings without saving them!

@{b}CANCEL@{ub}: <C> - This returns you to the puzzle, ignoring any new settings.

@endnode

@node "Keyboard" "Keyboard"
 @{b}THE KEYBOARD@{ub}

You  can  also  move  the  puzzle   pieces   by   using   the   cursor
keys or numeric keypad  keys.  This will move the piece that is on the
side of the blank space that you point to. (?)  For  example,  if  you
press UP,  the piece up above  the  blank  space  will  move. A little
confusing, but it really hurts to play this way. Just use the mouse, I
am not responsible for any hand injuries caused by anyone playing this
game with the keyboard.

Cursor key directions are reversable using the "KEYREVERSE=TRUE" 
@{"tooltype" link "ToolTypes" 0} in the Slider icon.

All the gadgets on the @{"main screen" link "Gadgets" 0} and in the @{"Options window" link "Options Window" 0}
have keyboard shortcuts.  These are usually the first letter in the
name of the gadget.

If   you   select   SOLVE,    the    computer    will    solve    each
piece in order until it reaches  the  bottom  two rows.  It  will then
solve the last two rows simultaneously  from   left   to   right.   If
the puzzle is unsolvable, then the computer will not even try to solve
one piece.  The fastest that computer  is  allowed  to  move  normally
is once every Intuitick (0.1 seconds). Because   the   window  doesn't
get every intuitick message,  and the computer   pauses   in   between
move sequences, it's time  will be slower than 10 moves a second. It's
still faster than I've seen anyone play this, so  I had no  desire  to
speed    it   up   until   I   was curious   at just   how   fast   it
would go. Selecting the Quick Solve gadget in the Options window  will
allow the computer   to   solve  the  puzzle  at  full  speed (limited
to about 30 moves/second.)

@endnode

@node "Picture Restrictions" "Picture Restriction"
 @{b}PICTURE RESTRICTIONS@{ub}

The  pictures  you  load  as  puzzle  pieces   must   have   no   more
than 32 colors (8-colors  ECS)  and  be at least 384x384 in size. They
must also be in a standard IFF ILBM form (which  is  what  most  Amiga
programs use).

I know it sounds like very few colors,  but  the  scheme  I  am  using
to keep 2 separate  palettes  on  one screen  requires each palette be
the same size. There  is  no  remapping  done  to  the  picture   file
being loaded. Still,  a lot can  be  done  with  these few colors. And
besides, Slider was never meant to be a picture viewer.

Any   attempt   to   load   a   file   that   does   not   meet    the
requirements will result in a requester telling you the size and depth
of the file you attempted to load, and the  size  and  depth  you  are
allowed.

For  those  who  feel  too  restricted  by  this,  see  the   SCRDEPTH

 @{b}TOOL TYPES@{ub}

For those who need to know everything, here are descriptions of the 
Tool Types in the Slider icon:

TILESWIDE=n       n = width of puzzle in number of pieces (4)

TILESHIGH=n       n = height of puzzle in number of pieces (4)

VIEWSHUFFLE=x     x = TRUE: Shuffle is visible (default)
                      FALSE: Shuffle is hidden

SOLVABLE=x        x = TRUE: Puzzles are always solvable (default)
                      FALSE: Puzzles may or may not be solvable

QUICKSOLVE=x      x = TRUE:  Computer solves puzzle as fast as possible
                      FALSE: Computer does <10 moves/sec (default) 

KEYREVERSE=x      x = TRUE:  Reverse direction of cursor keys/joystick
                      FALSE: Use default directions (default)

GRID=x            x = TRUE:  Add shine/shadow lines to puzzle pieces.
                      FALSE:  (default)

NUMBERS=x         x = TRUE:  Add text numbers to puzzle pieces.
                      FALSE   (default)

TILETYPE=x        x = NUMBERS  Place pieces in numerical order. (default)
                      PICTURE  Order pieces as a graphic window.

TILENAME=x        x = full path and filename to the picture to be loaded
                      for the puzzle pieces.  Do not use quotes, spaces are
                      ok.  Partial path names will be considered as being
                      relative to the directory that Slider is located in.
                      (default is graphics_aga/NumberedTiles_32.iff or
                      graphics_ecs/NumberedTiles_8.iff)

SCRMODE=x         x = a hexadecimal ModeID describing what screen mode to
                      open Slider in.  To force Slider to a 15kHz mode,
                      use 19004 for NTSC hires-lace (29004 PAL).
                      The screen must be at least 640x400 in size.
                      Default is 0 which instructs Slider to use the
                      mode that most closely matches a VGA productivity
                      screen.

SCRDEPTH=x        x = depth of game screen (4-8).  This will allow you
                      to load pictures with more colors.  Note that the
                      maximum number of colors in a loaded picture will
                      be half the number of colors on the screen.  The
                      default is 6 for AGA (4 for ECS) which gives
                      a fair number of colors on standard machines
                      while retaining fast speed.


Below this, if a tooltype reads "***DON'T EDIT THE FOLLOWING LINES!!***"
then all the remaining tooltypes that follow are a description of an icon
image for use under Nicola Salmoria's NewIcons system.

* If any of the Tooltypes are  set  to  unreasonble  values  (ie.  bad
screen  mode),  Slider  will  fall  back to the default value for that
option.

Just   hold   the   mouse   button   down    when    moving    pieces.
Your mouse button probably  won't last long if you click it once every
move. It's about 1000 moves to solve an 8x8 puzzle (I had  to  replace
my left mouse button before I realized I should put this feature in.)

If  you  get  stuck  on  one   piece,   press   SOLVE   to   see   how
the computer puts it  in,  then press SOLVE again to stop the computer
and finish the puzzle yourself. Read "@{"THE BRAIN" link "The Brain" 0}" section to see
what order the computer solves the puzzle in.

If  you  activate  another  window  to   check   on   something   else
running on your Amiga, Slider will pause the clock and wait for you to
you reactivate the Slider window.

Should Slider come up on a garbled screen, it's probably opening it in
a mode that you have a "monitors" file for that your monitor does not
support.  Either remove the offending monitor file from your "devs:monitors/"
directory or use the SCRMODE @{"tooltype" link "ToolTypes" 0} to force Slider to a specific
mode that your monitor does support.

@node "History" "History"
 @{b}HISTORY@{ub}

@{b}VERSION 2.0   11-Jan-96@{ub}
   ·  Made TileType selection automatic based on filename.  If the
      first 3 letters of the filename are "Num" then 'Numbers'
      will be selected, otherwise 'Picture' will be selected.
      The automatic setting can be manually overidden.
   ·  Added SCRMODE and SCRDEPTH tooltypes for those who want more.
   ·  When using 'Picture' tile type on a puzzle with a size smaller than
      8x8, the pieces closest to center of the picture are used.
   ·  Slight modification to display graphics.

@{b}VERSION 2.0 Beta   19-Dec-95@{ub}
   ·  Updated docs and translated them to AmigaGuide format.
   ·  Slider now sets its process name (used to be 'Background_Process').
   ·  Audio routines rewritten from scratch to be more system friendly. 
      Runs with as many channels it can get.  Behaves nicely with other
      audio device friendly programs like DeliTracker.
      Will run without audio if all channels stolen or not available.
   ·  Sound file separated into individual 8SVX files.
   ·  Palette  fade routine is now done with an interrupt for a real
      smooth fade.
   ·  Added to config window:
         ·  Filename & requester for loading custom tile graphics.
         ·  Tile graphics type - Tiles may be numbered, or a picture.
   ·  Due to requesters eating up graphics where title bar should be, 
      a real title bar was added.
   ·  Computer Solve no longer attempts to solve unsolvable puzzles.
   ·  Removed HighPriority option, added Quick Solve Option.
   ·  Added Config loader/saver (uses icon tooltypes)
   ·  Seperated Display & Tile graphic files. The AGA pictures are now
      32 colors each, and completely independant of each other.
      ECS pictures are only 8 though... (8+8 = 16).
   ·  Added Images to gadgets on main screen.
   ·  Score Table now indicates best times for that puzzle.
   ·  Added 'Lines' option to add shine and shadow lines to tiles.
   ·  Added 'Numbers' option to add numbers to tiles (nice for pictures).
   ·  The 'Blank' tile is now contained in display graphics to make its
      colors independent of the tiles picture.

@{b}Version 1.09   18-May-95@{ub}   (not released)
   ·  The palette of the mouse pointer is now read from the workbench 
      screen on AGA machines instead of being fixed to my colors. 
      (non-AGA machines didn't have this problem to begin with...).
      If you make your own Slider graphics, don't use colors 17, 18,
      or 19 because the palette for these 3 colors are now defined
      by the user's pointer prefs.
   ·  Changed fade routines to take advantage of AGA palette resolution.
   ·  Optimized loading routines to not use OpenFromLock() which failed
      if XFH was used.

@{b}Version 1.08   29-Apr-95@{ub}   (not released)
   ·  Bug report indicated that when Slider was opened on a screen with 
      overscan width settings > 640, Slider would PAUSE when selecting
      pieces on the far right (8x8 puzzle).  Yep, I didn't intend for
      Slider to open to the text overscan settings.  Although the rest
      of the code supports this, the backdrop window was opening to a
      fixed width (640).  Now the window opens to the same width as
      the screen.

@{b}Version 1.07   06-Apr-95@{ub}   (final public release before 2.00)
   ·  V1.06 proved not to work with ECS and WB3.1...  Screen setup 
         routine is now completely rewritten.  It checks GfxBase
         directly for chip set and default display mode.  With AGA
         chipset, Slider asks system for best mode available
         (64 colors).  With non-AGA chipset, Slider opens a hi-res
         lace screen in the mode the computer was booted in (NTSC or
         PAL).  Should work with all Amigas 500-4000, WB 2.0-3.1, 
         OCS/ECS/AGA Chips.

@{b}Version 1.06   31-Mar-95@{ub}
   ·  This time I really fixed the A3000 problem (at least with WB2.1)....
      Thanks go to Mike Nelson for testing and quick bug reporting!

@{b}Version 1.05   26-Mar-95@{ub}   (wish it was not released)
   ·  Thought I fixed problem when running on an A3000, but I made it 
      worse.  Seems OpenScreen() would open a Productivity screen in
      4 colors even though I specified 64!

@{b}Version 1.04   13-Jan-95@{ub}
   ·  Added Pause/Computer indicator (the P or C on the LED display).
   ·  Added ability to move more than one piece at a time.  Now if you 
      click on any piece that is in the same row or column as the empty
      spot, all the tiles in between will move.
   ·  Touched up AGA graphics to give more depth to LED display and to 
      smooth marble background.
   ·  Rewrote shuffle routine to be more thorough and efficient.
   ·  Added version number into config window titlebar.
   ·  Error messages now appear in requesters.

@{b}Version 1.03   29-Oct-94@{ub}   (not released)
   ·  Added internal loading routines for IFF files eliminating the 
      requirement for "iff.library".  This also eliminated any need
      for access to iff files after gamescreen is loaded.
   ·  Computer now stops trying when it cannot solve a puzzle.

@{b}Version 1.02   27-Oct-94@{ub}   (not released)
   ·  Added busy pointer/ghosted gadgets for when window was busy
      shuffling tiles or during Config mode so that multiple gadget
      hits (like on SHUFFLE) would have no effect.
   ·  Now recognizes earlier Kickstarts and alerts you if your not
      using at least WB 2.0

@{b}Version 1.01   30-Sep-94@{ub}   (not released)
   -  It is possible to flip screens, activating another window
      without releasing the mouse button (ala QMouse).  Slider
      would therefore not recieve the mouse SELECTUP message and
      let you move pieces even though you were no longer holding
      the button down.

@{b}Version 1.00   9/9/94@{ub}
   -  First public release.

If anyone out there would like to show off their icon handy  work  for

give you credit for it too!)

I would also appreciate any suggestions for sounds or graphics for the
game as well...

----- Under development:

@{b}CP-3 CONTROL PAD ADAPTER:@{ub}
   We have a working prototype of a device which allows TWO Sega Genesis
   controllers to be plugged into ONE Amiga game port.  Yes, that's two
   controllers in one port!  This leaves your mouse free for use while
   playing 2-player games.  This adapter also detects all the buttons on
   a "6-button" controlpad.  Not only can you read directions, but also
   A, B, C, Start, X, Y, Z, and Mode buttons (and from both controllers
   plugged into one port!  Our prototype has been tested and works on an
   Amiga 4000 and Amiga 500.  (Hardware and software by Randall Richards
   and myself).
