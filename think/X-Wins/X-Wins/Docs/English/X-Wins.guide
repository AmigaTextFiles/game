 X-Wins is s strategy game like "4-in-a-row".

 The goal of this game is to  become  4  (or  more) Stones in a row (verticaly, 
 horizontaly  or  digonaly). This happens while the opponents sets their stones 
 alternate in a x*y-sizing gamefield. You can set a stone by clicking in a free 
 field of your choise in the gamefield.

 If the field(s) under your clicked field are free too,  your  stone  will  fall
 down, because the stones in one vertical row are like a tower.

 For more information read the chapter @{" Gameplay " link "Gameplay" 0} of this documantation.

 @{u}How to play the Game?@{uu}
 @{ub}

 X-Wins is s strategy game like "4-in-a-row".

 When you start the program a window and  a requester appears. After closing the
 requester by clicking the "OK"-Button you see the @{" main-window " link "main-window" 0}.

 Now you can change the @{" prefenrences " link "prefs-window" 0} or begin to play.


 To make your turn (set a stone) just click in a free field  of  the  gamefield.
 Since you see the gamefield from the side-view and not from the top, your stone
 will fall down if possible. That means you build a tower in each coloumn.

 After you have made your turn it's your opponents turn.

 You have won the game when you have 4  (or  more)  stones in a row. That means 
 verticaly, horizontaly or digonaly. If neither you nor your opponent can build 
 that row, nobody wins.

 And now have fun!

/****************************************************************************/
/****************************************************************************/
@node "main-window" "Main-Window"

 @{u}The Main-Window@{uu}
 @{ub}

 At the top of this window you  will  see  a  status-line. This line informs you
 about the actual player and later about the winner of the game if exists.



 There are five buttons under the status-line:

 @{" New Game " link "BT New Game" 0} @{" Back " link "BT Back" 0} @{" Help " link "BT Help" 0} @{" Swap " link "BT Swap" 0} @{" Preferences... " link "BT Preferences" 0}



 Under these buttons you can see the gamefield which looks  like  a  grid.  Each
 field of this grid are a field where you can place a stone in the course of the
 game.

 To make your turn (set a stone) just click  in  a  free field of the gamefield.
 Since you see the gamefield from the side-view and not from the top, your stone
 will fall down if possible. That means you build a tower in each coloumn.

/****************************************************************************/
/****************************************************************************/

 Clicking at this button will take back your latest turn and then it's your turn
 again.  If  you are playing against the computer, the last turn of the computer
 will take back too, so it's your turn again.

 Clicking at this button will change in the help-mode. In this mode the computer
 will search for the best move he find for you.


 The result is ...

   ... a blinking field. That means this is the best turn from the view  of  the
   computer. (Not really always the best move you can do.)

   ... a requester wich informs you that you have no chanche to win  this  game.
   That  means that your next turn doesn't matter, because you will always loose
   later. (If you take back your last turn you will maybe change the situation.)

   ... a requester wich informs you that you will win this game if you see  your
   chanche now. After closing this requester you will see a blinking field. That
   means this is the best turn from the view of the computer.
   (You will certainly win this game some  time  if  conform  to  the  move  the
   computer found.)
