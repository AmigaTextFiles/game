New features of Version II:
---------------------------

1) If you look at the Options Menu, you can see two new items:
   a) Load Dragon:
      With this option, you can load a saved dragon. The
      input window will appear. Type in the filename of the
      saved dragon. If this file exists, China Challenge
      will load the dragon into memory and displays it on
      the screen.
   b) Save Dragon:
      With this option, you can save the current dragon on
      the screen to disk. After you activate "Save Dragon",
      the Workbenchscreen will appear with a small window on
      it. Just type the name of the Dragon's data file.
      The Playscreen comes up again and you can continue
      with another game.

2) In the first Version, you can only take back one move,
   but the wrong pair is mostly taken many moves before.
   In China Challenge II, you can take back every move you
   did without any restrictions.

3) China Challenge II now plays a little background music
   during the game. Enjoy it...

China Challenge is quite similar to the well known game Shanghai or
Mahjong. Target of China Challenge is, to remove all parts of the pile, the
so called Dragon, step by step. This dragon is composed out of 120
different pieces. You can always find four chips displaying the same
picture or chinese symbols. As the pile can't be removed indiscriminately,
there are certain rules allowing the removal of tiles.
First, you only can remove pairs of tiles wit the same image or picture on
its surfaces.
Second, the chips you want to take away must not have another piece to
their right or to their left. That means, both tiles have to be free and
without any "neighbor". If you already have played Shanghai, you surely
know the rules, because they are completely equal.

After loading and starting China Challenge, the screen gets black for a
short time and the first dragon appears. All 120 tiles have been shuffled
and placed onto the pile. Now you can select a piece by clicking on a tile
with the mouse pointer. If you have choosen a tile that was free, its
counterpart is shown in the left box. Now you can select a second tile. If
the second tile displays the same image or picture, it will be copied to
the box at the right border of the playscreen. Doubleclicking the second
icon means the removal of both tiles.
If you have taken away all chips from the dragon, you can continue with a
new shuffled one, perhaps with an increased difficulty level.

By using the pull down menus, you can select following functions:

About:  A small information window appears 
Quit:   Exit China Challenge, this means back to AmigaDos

New Game: Starts current game over and builts up a new shuffled dragon
Undo last move: Takes back the last move you did
Undo all moves: Rebuilts the same dragon a second time
Load Dragon: Loads a saved dragon from disk
Save Dragon: Saves the currently displayed dragon to disk
Play Music: Enables or disables the game music


                          Enjoy this game and not your pirate copies...
