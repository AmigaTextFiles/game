SHAREWARE:

This game is ShareWare, and it may freely be distributed as long
as it stays in it's original state. 
   If You want more than theese nine silky levels, you'd better
send us some cash! About £6 (or if possible 50 SEK) would be ni-
ce. The full game is to be out in late September - or early Octo-
ber.



THE GAME:

It's in the style of where BoxMan meats PacMan.
   As in PacMan, You must pick all pacs up, and as in BoxMan, You
will have to solve problems (Far more complicated than in BoxMan,
though!).
   There is a story to... but I can't remember it right now...
Maby some money would help (-;



THE PLAY-THING:

Controlling Jack is easy. Move Your joy in the wanted direction,
and he wont stop until he bumps into a wall, or You push the joy
in another sort of way.

SmallPacs - Eat em' all up.

BigPacs - If You eat one, You will be able to spit it out later
          pressing the firebutton. JackMan must be MOVING if You
          want him to do this.   The spitted bigpac can destroy a 
          piece of block.

Hearts - There is one on each level. When You have taken five of
         them, You will be presented to a bonuslevel.

Shoes - With theese, You can walk on moving floors.

Key - Will open a locked block for You.

GreyBlocks - Theese can be pushed around. If You push one into a
             teleporter, both will be erased.

LockedBlock - Will disappear if You push on it, and have got a 
              key.

Teleporter - Will move You to the nearest of the same kind. Can
             be destroyed by a greyblock.

MovingFloor - Will move You in the direction of it's arrow.

FlameThrower - Walk into them as often as possible... NOT!

Lava - Walk on it and die.



THE FULL GAME:

More levels
More music
Better graphics - hopefully(!)
