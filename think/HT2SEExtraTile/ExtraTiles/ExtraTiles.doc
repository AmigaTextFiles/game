PERSONAL NOTES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I have reproposed this utility after much years, only because I had a bit
of free time (and for the release of the REGISTERED version of "HIT TILES 2
SPECIAL EDITION" and "HIT PUZZLE"), so are present only small updates.


To use these set of tiles, just copy the files in the "TILES" drawer into
the "TILES" drawer of the installed game.


Who wants to create the own tiles, it's better that read the IffToTiles.doc
that is present in the "DOC" drawer of the game.

I'm searching musicians for simply projects (little games, music disk,
etc.). Concerns me every type of protracker modules. Each module used in
my projects, will have the author's name in the credits obviously, and for
those who want, their home/e-mail address and a short message.



Please send any comments, bugs, praise, postcards, letters (there are some
Japanese Amigians? If yes, please contact me :-) ) to the following address:
