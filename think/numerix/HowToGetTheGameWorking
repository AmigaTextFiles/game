Here is a game that has been around for a long time and is really sexy.

To Get The Game Working:

Make a blank disk called NUMERIX. ( what a surprise !! )

Unpack the NUMERIX.lha file to the disk.

Make a libs dir on the disk and copy the below libraries into it.

mathtrans.library      4280 ----rw-d Future    18:25:49 EXECUTABLE
amos.library          38488 ----rwed Future    18:25:44 EXECUTABLE
icon.library           5688 ----rw-d Future    18:25:50 EXECUTABLE
translator.library    10592 ----rwed Future    18:25:52 EXECUTABLE
mathieeedoubbas.libr   4688 ----rw-d Future    18:25:54 EXECUTABLE
diskfont.library       4964 ----rw-d Future    18:25:55 EXECUTABLE
mathieeedoubtrans.li  15728 ----rw-d Future    18:25:57 EXECUTABLE
medplayer.library     12608 ----rwed Future    18:25:48 EXECUTABLE

That should get the game working!!!

It's best to play this game from floppy. I think I did try to run it from my HD
but it crashed ;(

Instructions are included in the game.

Have Fun!!!!
