Version 1.3
Added modplayer.a written by Teijo Kinnunen and modified to be callable
by C program with arguments on the stack.  Also added original music
written using MED V3.20.  Added routine to set preferences for key repeat
speed to speed up game significantly & reset at game end.  Now requires
AmigaDOS 2.04 or better because of requester at game end.

Version 1.2
Things were dressed up somewhat. Looks much nicer.  Added demo mode.

Version 1.1
Skipped this one.

Version 1.0
The first one released to the public.

DIRECTIONS:

Use the 8, 4, 6, and 2 keys on the numeric keypad to move through
the maze shown on top. The 0 (zero) key will exit the program.

This simple game is the result of a couple of late nights of experimenting
with dual playfields on the Amiga. It has been tested on an A2000HD/P with
Workbench 2.04 and the Enhanced Chip Set (ECS). Let me know if you
experience problems.

The idea of this game is very simple. There are two mazes, one red and one
blue, shown on top of each other. The mazes are different every time and
different from each other. You start at the left end of both mazes and have
to get to the exits on the right end of both mazes. About every 40 moves or
so, using the magic of dual playfields, the top and bottom mazes are
swapped.
