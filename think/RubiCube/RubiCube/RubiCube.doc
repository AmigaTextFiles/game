        Requirements:   an Amiga/emulator (this should be obvious)
                        this program      (this should be obvious, too)
                        medplayer.library for the title song (a C64 tribute)

The game:

On the left hand side of the game screen there is the 3-dimensional view of
the magic cube. You can control it with the mouse, but this is no easy thing
to do. When you press and hold the right mouse button, you can rotate the
whole cube to the left, to the right, upward, downward or diagonally. But if
you release the button where you pressed it, the cube will turn by 180° on
the y-axis (an imaginary line going right through the cube from the top to
the bottom). Additionally, if you hold both buttons, the cube will spin
around the z-axis (that imaginary line breaking through your screen) while
moving the mouse. Then, too, the cube will turn upside down if you release
the buttons on the same spot you started. But now on to the real control:
You will want to rotate certain layers of the cube in order to regain
single-coloured sides. This is done by pointing on a subsquare of one of the
visible faces, pushing and holding the left mouse button, moving the pointer
towards another neighbouring square and releasing the button. However,
before you release it, you will be shown what action is to be executed by
the means of a symbol replacing the mouse pointer.

At the rightmost you can see 8 gadgets which have following functions:

        MISCHEN         With this function you order the computer to shuffle
                        the cube thoroughly for as long as 5 seconds.

        RÜCKSETZEN      Here you can reset the cube to his strived for
                        "clean" state without any efforts.

        SPIEL LADEN     It is possible to load a previously saved game along
                        with all its adjustments.

        SPIEL SICHERN   You may of course save the current position and
                        settings any time you like.

        SPIEL LÖSEN     If it's too difficult for you to solve the puzzle or
                        if you simply want to see how the computer
                        encounters the challenge, you may select this button
                        to have the Amiga find the solution. You can chose
                        whether it should stop between the stages to tell
                        you what's still wrong with the cube and to ask you
                        whether to continue or not. If you decided not to
                        interact, you may still abort the process by holding
                        one of the mouse buttons until the present stage is
                        finished. Then the upper and lower screen area will
                        immediately start to flash and you may release the
                        button.

        FARBPALETTE     If the colours don't match your flavour, it should
                        not be a problem to change them.

        DREHDAUER       With this function you can set the duration of any
                        spinning operation.

        BEENDEN         Finally you are enabled to quit the game by using
                        this button.

                                                Have a joyful puzzle :->
