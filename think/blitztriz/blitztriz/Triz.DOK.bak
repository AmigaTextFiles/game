Please forgive me for this mixed up DOK-File, but I converted it from the
GUIDE-File and was too lazy to make the changes. (However you should think
of updating your computersystem.)

     Yes, you are right. This game is another clone of Tetris, but  it
     has some features that makes it worth existing. Writing this game
     was just  an  exercise  in  programming  BlitzBasic,  but  I  was
     quite happy with the result, so that I decided to release it. The
     game should run on all Amigas.
     Now lets list up some features of Triz:

                  -fully Multitasking and `quitable` (IMPORTANT when used
                   on harddisks !!).
                  -super duper background gfx. (by me ;) )
                  -Saves a `TOP-HUNDRED` scoreboard.
                  -Shows your ranking during play.
                  -Nice but useless Histogramm.
                  -Shows your Score  (WOW, what a feature !!) ;)
                  -Nice Intro and super duper music. (be me ;) )
                  -Level Editor
                  -more blocks optionaly selectable
                  -uncrippled Shareware !!

     O.K. enough of that ! Why don`t you  have  a  look  by  yourselfs?

Why the Hell does a Game like Triz need an Editor ?? I don`t now ! But I
thought it would be nice, to be able to setup the levels according to the
players playingstrength.

O.K. To get to the Editor you have to press `e` while you are in the
Mainscreen (The Screen where the Scroller does its job). Then a window will
be opened with a lot of Buttons on it.



Installation should be very simple:
From the Workbench:
Take the Drawer `Blitztriz` and place it somewhere you want.
Copy `medplayer.library` found in `Blitztriz/libs` to LIBS:

Files needed:

----------------------------------

Triz
Triz.info

TrizIntro
TrizIntro.info

soft-aztec.med
TRIZ.med
TRIZ.levels
TRIZ.scores

Triz.Guide
Triz.Guide.info

(in LIBS:) medplayer.library
----------------------------------

This Game may only be spread if all this Files are copied !!

I don`t think that anyone doesn`t knows how to play TRIZ.

So here is a description of the messages displayed before each level:

                 NONEXT - The next upcoming Block won`t be shown
                 RANDOMBLOCKS - After droping a Block a 1x1 Bock will
                                apear somewhere on your playfield !!
                 REVERSE - All Joystick-actions are reversed
                 ROTATION - The Blocks will apear randomrotated.

     But there are some additional troubles: In each level the speed of
     gameplay will increase. In some levels there will be a few  blocks
     allready on the playfield. (according to the default Levels)

     Optionally you can choose EXTENDED blocks for harder gameplay by
     pressing `b` in the mainscreen. Pressing `n` will bring you
     back to NORMAL blocks.    (see Special Keys)


     Now the scores:
                        1 ROW =  100 POINTS
                        2 ROWS=  300 POINTS
                        3 ROWS= 1000 POINTS
                        4 ROWS= 3000 POINTS
                        5 ROWS= 6000 POINTS    (YES, it`s possible)

     If you pull your Joystick down to quickly drop a block, the  score
     will be counted up and when you get it to build all rows down  you
     will get 100.000 POINTS.

                            O.K. Now have Fun !!

In The Mainscreen (when you see the Scroller below):
        `ESC`        to exit the Game
        `e`        to enter the Editor
        `b`      to choose EXTENDED blocks
        `n`       to choose NORMAL blocks
        `m`       to toggle music on/off

        pulling the Joystick down will show the TOP-HUNDRED Scoreboard.

While playing:
        `p`        to pause  (press again or press Fire to unpause)
        `m`        to toggle music on/off
        `ESC`      to end Game

Flip the screen with the old `AmigaR+m` if you want to `multitask`.

Why Register when this an uncrippled Game ? Why cripple Shareware when
everyone registers ?

O.K. Software that is worth using is worth paying for. If you like this Game
you should pay for it. THANKS in advance !

The Registration fee is 20 DM
                        15 US-$
                         5 £
                        or more if you like

NO coins !!!!

If you send me a Disk and an stamped envelope for answer you will be
send the Complete Sourcecode (BlitzBasicII) of TRIZ including the

Send Disks and/or cash to me.




This Button EXITs the Editor. You are now in the Mainscreen.

This Button allows you to TEST your currently edited level. Scores that are
made in Testingmode are not archived in the TOP-HUNDRED Scoreboard. Press
`ESC` to exit Testmode and to return to the Editor.

With this Button you may load a `TRIZ.Levels` File.

This Button is to make your edited Levels saved. Saving a File named
`TRIZ.Levels` means that this file will be loaded on Startup.

This Button shows if all Joystickactions are Reversed or not.

This Button gives you the ability to restore the Default Levels.

This Button will clear the Playfield.

With this Button you select the Level you wish to edit.

With this Button you select how many Lines (up to 99) have to build to solve
the level.

This Button will add a level (up to 99).

This Button will delete the last Level.

This Button will edit the playingspeed. The current speed is shown above.
Remember that this value is the amount of waitingtime, meaning increasing
the Speedvalue will give less speed.

RND BLOCKS are Blocks wich will be displayed somewere on the screen during
play. This will add the player some trouble. The amount of Blocks is shown
above. This value means the amount of lines beeing used for displaying the
Blocks. Set this value to zero for no RND BLOCKS.

By pressing inside the Playfield you are able to set Blocks, which will be
displayed after a level began.



You can have a look at the Scoreboard by moving the Joystick down while you
are in the Mainscreen. Then you are able to scroll around moving the
Joystick up and down.
