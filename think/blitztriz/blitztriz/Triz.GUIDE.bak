@node "Editor" "Editor"
Why the Hell does a Game like Triz need an Editor ?? I don`t now ! But I
thought it would be nice, to be able to setup the levels according to the
players playingstrength.

O.K. To get to the Editor you have to press `e` while you are in the
Mainscreen (The Screen where the Scroller does its job). Then a window will
be opened with a lot of Buttons on it:

@{"EXIT" link "EXIT" 0}

  @{"TEST" link "TEST" 0}           @{"DEF" link "DEF" 0}
  @{"LOAD" link "LOAD" 0}           @{"CLR" link "CLR" 0}
  @{"SAVE" link "SAVE" 0}
  @{"SHOW NEXT   " link "SHOWNEXT" 0}        @{"LINES +" link "LINES" 0}
  @{"RND ROTATION" link "RNDROTATION" 0}        @{"LINES -" link "LINES" 0}
  @{"PLAY REVERSE" link "PLAYREVERSE" 0}        @{"LEVEL +" link "LEVEL" 0}          @{"SPEED +    " link "SPEED" 0}
                      @{"LEVEL -" link "LEVEL" 0}          @{"SPEED -    " link "SPEED" 0}
                      @{"ADDLAST" link "ADDLAST" 0}          @{"RNDBLOCKS +" link "RNDBLOCKS" 0}
                      @{"DELLAST" link "DELLAST" 0}          @{"RNDBLOCKS -" link "RNDBLOCKS" 0}

By pressing inside the Playfield you are able to set Blocks, which will be
displayed after a level began.

     Yes, you are right. This game is another clone of Tetris, but  it
     has some features that makes it worth existing. Writing this game
     was just  an  exercise  in  programming  BlitzBasic,  but  I  was
     quite happy with the result, so that I decided to release it. The
     game should run on all Amigas.
     Now lets list up some features of Triz:

                  -fully Multitasking and `quitable` (IMPORTANT when used
                   on harddisks !!).
                  -super duper background gfx. (by me ;) )
                  -Saves a `TOP-HUNDRED` scoreboard.
                  -Shows your ranking during play.
                  -Nice but useless Histogramm.
                  -Shows your Score  (WOW, what a feature !!) ;)
                  -Nice Intro and super duper music. (be me ;) )
                  -Level Editor
                  -more blocks optionaly selectable
                  -uncrippled !!

     O.K. enough of that ! Why don`t you  have  a  look  by  yourselfs?

@node "Gameplay" "Gameplay"
I don`t think that anyone doesn`t knows how to play TRIZ.

So here is a description of the messages displayed before each level:

                 NONEXT - The next upcoming Block won`t be shown
                 RANDOMBLOCKS - After droping a Block a 1x1 Bock will
                                apear somewhere on your playfield !!
                 REVERSE - All Joystick-actions are reversed
                 ROTATION - The Blocks will apear randomrotated.

     But there are some additional troubles: In each level the speed of
     gameplay will increase. In some levels there will be a few  blocks
     allready on the playfield. (according to the default Levels)

     Optionally you can choose EXTENDED blocks for harder gameplay by
     pressing `b` in the mainscreen. Pressing `n` will bring you
     back to NORMAL blocks.    (see @{"Special Keys" link "Keys" 0})


     Now the scores:
                        1 ROW =  100 POINTS
                        2 ROWS=  300 POINTS
                        3 ROWS= 1000 POINTS
                        4 ROWS= 3000 POINTS
                        5 ROWS= 6000 POINTS    (YES, it`s possible)

     If you pull your Joystick down to quickly drop a block, the  score
     will be counted up and when you get it to build all rows down  you
     will get 100.000 POINTS.

                            O.K. Now have Fun !!

@node "Keys" "Special Keys"
In The Mainscreen (when you see the Scroller below):
        `ESC`        to exit the Game
        `e`        to enter the Editor
        `b`      to choose EXTENDED blocks
        `n`       to choose NORMAL blocks
        `m`       to toggle music on/off

        pulling the Joystick down will show the @{"TOP-HUNDRED Scoreboard" link "Scoreboard" 0}.

While playing:
        `p`        to pause  (press again or press Fire to unpause)
        `m`        to toggle music on/off
        `ESC`      to end Game

Flip the screen with the old `AmigaR+m` if you want to `multitask`.

@node "Registering" "How to Register"
Why Register when this an uncrippled Game ? Why cripple Shareware when
everyone registers ?

                        or more if you like

NO coins !!!!
