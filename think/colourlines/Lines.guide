@node "Intro" "How this story began"

 One of my colleague (Edina Horváth) brought once a quite nice logical
game into our office. It was a russian program, written for IBM-PC
soapboxes under DOS. I found it very amusing, so I took it home. Under the
PC emulator it was @{fg shine}soooo@{fg text} slow! (Probably written in some kind of old Pascal
version...)
 I showed it to my girlfriend (who is not my girlfriend anymore, but this
text is not about us), and that was hardly a good idea at all... :) She
just LOVED that game, but it took about half an our while she played a
round. So I could leave my two women together for at least an hour in pair
alone. (My ex-girlfriend and my Amiga.) After a while I got rid of the situation,
and I looked for an Amiga clone for this game on Aminet. I found one, but it
was an altered version, did not behave similar in all rules, written in AMOS,
and after all I did not liked it very much. The other reason was: I got some new
ideas to be implemented.
 Let's start from scrach then... And I wrote it. There is a possibility to
play under the original rules, but extended rules give more pleasure I think.
 Now my ex-girfriend was still playing at least an hour, but now she could complete
4-6 games... She is unbeatable in the high scores... :)

@node "Installation" "Why this s**t does not want to work???"

 All you have to do to install is:

    @{fg shine}copy all files and subdirs to one directory!@{fg text}

 Quite easy, isn't it?

 At the first run it will ask for a screenmode through a normal screenmode
requester. It should be done only once, then the game saves the modeID
into the file @{fg shine}lines.cfg@{fg text}. If you want to reconfigure the screenmode, simply
delete the @{fg shine}lines.cfg@{fg text} file, and it will ask the modeID again.

@node "Usage" "Easy-to-use is always suspicious!"

 So, you have finally decided to read the docs, eh? :)

 The basic rules of the game

 Your playground is a square, divided into 81 pieces (9 rows by 9 columns).
Almost every round in the game 3 coloured ball appear randomly at free
places on this table. (You can look forward to the oncoming balls at the
right of the table.) Now, you can pick one of the balls on the table (left
mouse click), and choose an empty space, which one is not separated by other
balls (left mouse click). You can change your mind before moving the ball
into an other position you can simply pick an other ball by using the left
button again.
 Picked ball will be moved to the empty place, and if 5 or more exists in one
line from the same colour, the line disappears. When this happened, in the
next round no new balls are coming to the table. (So you can decrease the
number of the balls, if you are good enough...)
 After each disappeared ball you will get points, scoring is non linear, more
balls give you much more points. If random balls cause a line to be
disappeared, you won't get any points for it.
 Game ends when the table is full.

 The extended rules

 The high scores of the extended rules registered separately from each other,
new features help sometimes a lot, so much more scores can be achieved. It
would not be a fair play using the same Hall-Of-Fame.

 1. Joker ball

 If you choose this extended rule, you can apply for a joker ball at any time
in the game by left clicking to the black joker ball at the right from the
table. After picking the joker, you can place at any free sqaure on the table
by left clicking, and it can be used as any colour.
 At the start you have 3 joker balls, more joker can be earned by
disappearing at least 7 balls at the same time.

 2. Exchanging balls

 This extended rule let you exchanging any two balls instead of moving them.
Choose first ball by left clicking, then pick the other one by a right click.
The punishment: there piece of walls will appear on random places, those can
be moved, but will never vanish.

 To choose extended rules, click on the icons at the start screen. Crossed
icons mean that rule does not apply in the game.
 You can also turn off the music on the start screen, if it drove you crazy.

 Known bugs:

 Balls sometimes start "roaming" on the playground, but finally they
made it into the destination. This small bug is coming from my lazyness. I
had no intention at all writing a better routine for ball routing. Maybe
once...

 Music module playing is hardware banging yet, I have not enough knowledge
writing an other, system friendly player. If you know one, please let me
know!
