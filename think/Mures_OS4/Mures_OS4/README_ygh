Mures is a cross-platform clone of Sega's "Chu Chu Rocket" written using C. It
has been tested on Linux and Windows, but should work on other 32-bit
platforms.

Requirements
------------
SDL 1.2.0
SDL_image
SDL_net
SDL_ttf
OpenGL (optional)

How to build
------------
see INSTALL

How to play
-----------
Run

./mures

Game configuration is now handled by a menu system.
Passing the "--no3d" argument disables OpenGL output if it is compiled in.

Controls
--------
Press enter to start the game, press P to pause, and Q to quit. Print screen
saves a screenshot to the shot.bmp in the current directory.
Press escape to return to the menu from the middle of a game.
F1 restarts the current game. This is useful in puzzle mode.

Player 1: Use the mouse to target, and click and drag in the desired direction
to place an arrow. If a joystick is detected, it may also be used by player 1.

Player 2: Use the arrow keys to target, and the number keypad to place arrows.

Player 3: Use A,W,S,D to target and I,J,K,L to place arrows.

Multiplayer
------------
Multiplayer (multi-computer) support is currently experimental and only enjoy-
able over links without packet loss. To start a server, run the game and
select Server. Put in less than four players. The game will not start until it
fills up.

To run a client, use -c hostname, where hostname is the host name of the
server. Once the game fills up, the server will automatically start it, but if
you wish to play with less than four players, the person running the server
may press enter to start it.

If you're looking for others to play with, try #mures on irc.openprojects.net.
