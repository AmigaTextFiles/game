===============================================================================
                               Requirements
===============================================================================

In order to play this wonderful game you'll need at least the following:-

1Mb of free disk space (8Mb for DEV and ANM archives)
1.6Mb RAM ( 1.3Mb of free Chip RAM
             300K of free fast RAM )
KS 1.3
68000
OCS Chipset

However, these are rough estimates, so don't cry if it doesn't work!

PS. I'm guessing at the 68000, KS 1.3 and OCS bit.  AMOSPro SHOULDN'T need 
anything better, but I can't confirm that it works on those machines.

@title "The Introduction"
===============================================================================
                                Introduction.
===============================================================================

Story Line:

        All hell has broken loose in the alpha quadrant.  Much of the
federation has been destroyed.  Only a few starfleet ships remain... you
command one of them (a Galaxy Class).

        The Cardassians have expanded there borders due to there alliance
with the Dominion.  The Romulans have been looking for an excuse to attack
the federation for some time now, and the klingons just like a good fight!

        To add to your problems there have been two transwarp signatures
detected recently.  They are believed to be the Borg.

Playing The Game:

        The graphics of the game are designed around the Star Trek computer
displays featured on the TV series.  you start with an introduction screen
and are prompted to press any key to continue.

        After that, you enter your name, ships name, and registration

         e.g. Jean-Luc Picard
              USS Enterprise
              NCC-1701-D

        However, It's a good idea not to choose the Enterprise, because the
Enterprise 'E' is one of the other ships.

The following federation ships are also in the game:

        USS Lakota              USS Hood
        Excelsior Class         Excelsior Class
        NCC-42768               NCC-42296
        Capt. Benteen           Capt. Robert DeSoto

        USS Enterprise          USS Defiant
        Sovereign Class         Defiant Class
        NCC-1701-E              NX-74205
        Capt. Jean-Luc Picard   Lt. Cmdr. Worf

        USS Bozeman
        Soyuz Class
        NCC-1941
        Capt. Morgan Bateson (Frasier!!! "hello klingons... I'm listening...")

Enemy Ships:

        3x Klingon    K't'inga class
        3x Romulan    D'Deridex class
        3x Cardassian Galor Class

@title "What Currently Works And What Does The Future Hold?"
==============================================================================
                   What does work / doesn't work / may never work
==============================================================================

In previous versions this part was a couple of pages long, however, there
is only one thing missing from this release,

 The DeadBy pictures.  When you are killed by one of the enemies you are
                       pressented with a screen with a picture of that enemy, 
                       and a short description.  Currently only the Borg actually 
                       do this because I cannot get any screen grabs of other 
                       enemies.  To see what I'm talking about, get killed
                       by the borg :-)

What I plan to do in the future (but might not):

                Make the game harder. (Done. but I plan to have different
                                       levels of the game.)
                Reinforcements (enemy & federation)
                Cloaking for Klingons & Romulans (& the Defiant)
                Scenarios (Borg invasion, Federation invasion of Romulans,
                           user defined custom scenarios!) ---- Kinda Done.
                Two Player (serial/modem)

                Make the game more efficient (possibly a total re-write, if
                 so, I'd do it in C).  I am qualified to program in C but don't 
                 have any experience of using it on the Amiga.  If I did do
                 it, then it could multitask, use >15KHz screens and support 
                 AGA/CGX/P96. (sounds a lot better doesn't it?)

                Prefs: Which graphics set to use (Default/user created)
                       Same with the sound
                       also - replacement names for total scenarios
                              e.g. renaming klingons too Kasons (Voyager), ---- Kinda Done.
                                   renaming Federation to klingons so you can be
                                   a Klingon etc.

I would like to thank the following people for there help:-

        Nick Blundell - For his help with AMOS
        Jools Henn    - For grabbing Locutus with his VidiAmiga.
        Paul Disbrey  - For his vast knowledge of Star Trek and his new
                        intro screen which I have modified.
                        And his various imagine objects.
        My Dad        - For letting me use his A1200 until V0.95

        Ian David Britton - For his Star Trek animation which I used for
                            the base of the graphics.  Sorry, I didn't ask
                            permission, but I didn't have any way of 
                            contacting you.

        Trevor Morris - For his Galaxy class imagine object,
                        I didn't have the docks, but I did 
                        have the picture that came with it.

        Pietro Ghizzoni - For his updated AMOS.Library which fixed the
                          interlace problem!

Free registered versions are on their way to you all!

Could those people above, please get in touch with me, the objects have
been on my hard drive for so long with no readme's (I have a habit of
reading what I need to know and then deleting them).  Sorry.

I would also like to thank the makers of all the imagine objects that I
have used.  I don't know their names, because the objects have been on my
hard drive for a long time with no readme's.  If you think I have used one
of your objects please contact me, and I will include your name in future
documentation.

When you click on this, you will be asked if you wish to continue...

Presing "Engage" will seperate the two sections of the ship.  
THIS IS A ONE WAY PROCESS.  The screen will shake, then return to normal.

Once seperated, Main power and Torpedoes will be unavailable (because they 
are on the engineering hull, and you are all in the saucer).

Your systems will be in better condition... so, you should be able to get to a
Starbase.  Once there... you will get a new Engineering hull.

@title "The EPS Power Grid"
==============================================================================
                             Using The EPS Power Grid
==============================================================================

When first pressed, the EPS console will change to something like this:-

 __________________________  
|                          | 
|     Take Power From      |
|                          | 
|    Shields               | 
|    Phasers               | 
|    Warp Drive            | 
|    Main Power            | 
|    Reserve Power         | 
|                          | 
|__________________________| 

Selecting one of these will take you to the next part of the EPS console:-

 __________________________  
|                          | 
|     Put Power Into       |
|                          | 
|                          | 
|    Phasers               | 
|    Warp Drive            | 
|    Main Power            | 
|    Reserve Power         | 
|                          | 
|__________________________| 

This will look similar to the last one execpt that the system we are taking 
power from is not printed.  For the above sample I am taking power from 
the shields into the warp drive.  The EPS console will now change to this:-

 __________________________  
|                          | 
| Take Power From Shields  |

On clicking the goto box, the goto window will change and will tell you the

in tht sector it will be displayed below the x,y co-ordinates.

To change your sector, move the mouse over the desired sector on the map and 
press the left mouse button.  An "Engage" and a "Cancel" button will now appear.

Pressing the Engage button will them Warp you to that sector.

This takes you to the sector that the mouse is over,  if there was an enemy in
that sector then the chances are that he will be gone when you get there.

The main use for this is to GOTO a starbase.

|__________________________| 

Phasers can only fire half of there maximum power normally 300 units.

Phasers have a variable effect on the target.  If a phaser, hits you are garanteed
atleast half of the power will be useful maybe more)

  eg if I used 50 units then the hit would be between 25 and 50,
              100 units - between 50 and 100

  Geddit?

The variable effect is because of Shield frquencies of the enemy and that of your
phasers.

This sends away teams onto enemy ships.

This will allow you to learn Alien technology.  This will increase your 
weapons power against that enemy.  A percentage will be shown.

This also allows you to steal Power and torpedoes from that enemy.

Once an enemy shiop has been boarded, you will not be able to board it 
again in that turn.  If you attempt to board another races ship, you may 
not learn any more, but you will still be able to steal power/torpedoes.

The enemies sheilds must be below 100 for you to board them!

The technology boost will effect Shields and weapons.

  eg  We learn 10% effectiveness against that enemy.

      Our shields will now be 10% better against that enemy.

      And our Weapons will also be 10% better.

The technology learnt from one race, will not effect another.

|   Mains                  | 
|   Torpedoes         OK   | 
|__________________________| 

Each of these upgrades will require 600 units of power to install.  This
power must be in your RESERVE for the transfer to take place.  Here's what
each upgrade does:-

Shields   - increases the maximum amount for the shields from 300 too 600.
Warp Drv  - increases from 300 to 600.
Phasers   - increases from 300 to 600 maximum and from 150 too 300 for each
            blast.
            NOTE: Phasers only work in the registered version.
Mains     - upgrades the mains from 600 to 900
Torpedoes - upgrades from Photon to Quantum (50 to 75 respectively)
            (This is the most useful upgrade.)

If you do not have 600 units available in your reserve, then a COST TOO
MUCH sign will appear.

Once you've selected every thing you want, press the OK button to leave the

        Added new features to Guide and corrected mistakes (V1.1)
        Program is now a lot smaller (don't really know why, but what the hell!)

V0.92  Third public release                                             14/11/1998
        Added Borg picture to Analysis.
        Added Jem'Hadar picture to Analysis.
        Added StarBase Picture to Analysis.
        Added Federation ships to Analysis.
        Added simple Comms with the Klingons.
        Added upgrades to the Starbases.
        Follow now works will all Federation ships.
        Made the game more realistic and harder
         -Klingons now have about 275 shields
         -Romulans       = ~300
         -Cardassians    = ~300
         -Dominion       = ~375
         -Torpedoes only cause 50 units of damage (was 75), but can be
           upgraded to 75
         -USS Lakota     = ~300
         -USS Hood       = ~250
         -USS Enterprise = ~325
         -USS Defiant    = ~350
         -USS Bozeman    = ~180
         -Your shields start at 300 instead of 100!
         -Changed the repair function slightly.  Now costs twice as much
           to repair.  eg 10% damage needs 20 units of power to repair.
         -Only Damage and Main power regenerate when warp drive is used.
         -Changed attacks of the enemy   eg. Although the Romulans are
           stronger than the klingons, the klingon weapons can cause more 
           damage.
        Changed the Intro screen.  Paul made the original, but I modified
         it to fit a Galaxy class star ship into the top window.  you now
         have to press the continue button with the mouse (instead of pressing 
         any key).  ADDED BONUS - if you press the Schematics buttons, you'll 
         cycle between different views of the ship.
        Changed the way torpedoes work.  they now fire one at a time. and
         may miss (in previous versions, the torpedoes never missed).  Except 
         with the Borg.  You CANNOT miss the Borg (Good), but the Borg CANNOT 
         miss you (Bad).
        Now has a nice exploding sound if the enemy dies!
        Changed the name, ships name and reg. to enter CAPITALS only.  This
         makes it easier to read on an interlaced screen.
        Federation ships now re-generate after battles. (all ships do this,
         but only the enemy did in earlier versions).
        Corrected Borg speech.  "your culture will adapt to service us."
         should have ended with "ours". fixed.
        Added bleep-bleep sound to the engineering and ops functions.
        Added new feature/fixes etc. to Guide (now V1.2)
        Added BONUS!!! programs.

           the left mouse button down on the yellow bar at the top.
           And then move the screen up/down.  

V0.99  Internal Release                                                15/12/1998
        >>> -Star Trek- is now SHAREWARE <<<
        Fixed Other Dominion/Starbase bug.
        Fixed bug with restart.
        Fixed other bug with restart.
        Added two other Death Anims.
        Added Seperation pictures to the intro screen.

        Added Phaser info to Tactical Reports.
        Added Shield info to Tactical reports.
        Added Shield Failed warning to tactical reports.
        Increased Borg to ~3000 (makes the game a bit harder)
        Added SOVERIEGN picture to Analysis
        Changed EPS so that only the after damage value of all systems 
         can be used. (makes the game a little bit harder)
        Added Continue Button for Tactical/Comms etc.  You don't have 
         to press any key.
        Fixed Bug in shield info.  Would sometimes say -1 instead of 
         Shield Failed warning, but only with high damage eg 100%+. So 
         you'd die anyway.
        Fixed Bug with "Insufficiant Power for warp" warning, even when 
         you could go to warp.
        Deliberatly left in flashing button bug.  This happens on the
         Tactical Reports when the enemy misses.  I Don't quite know why 
         this happens but it looks good, so I'll leave it in!
        Corrected Bug which ment that enemies,starbases and federation
         ships would never be in grid 0,# , #,0 or 27,#
        Corrected slight bug with the lines of the Map
        Extended Map to 31x20 (0-30,0-19)
        Now Automatically sets and limits the mouse inside the grid when
         you use either Goto or Follow.
        Added Scenarios! You can now have upto 50 of each enemy, change
         enemy names and Federation ships etc.
        Fixed the countless bugs that the Scenarios caused. (and I MEAN 
                                                              countless)
        Added "MORE" button to Tactical Reports, because there could be
         hundreds of battles!
        Fixed Bug which stopped the Third Death Anim from working.
        Fixed Two bugs when the code was jumping out of range. eg. the
         For...Next were too far apart.  This caused the game to CRASH 
         from the Editor but worked fine when compiled. All I had to do 
         was move some of the code around.  This caused havoc when I added
         stuff to Engineering and the REGEN function.  Took about two days 
         to figure out!
        Replaced WireFrame Pictures with rendered ones.  Horribly dithered
         to fit into 16 colour screen, but they still look better.
        Fixed Bug with starbases which ment that you could ask for
         clearence from one starbase then warp to another and dock with it, 
         without asking it for clearence.  Don't know how long that ones
         been in there!
        I won't release the Game until I find some more objects.  Paul made
         the basic wireframes of most of the ships, but they don't render. (well...
         they do but they look crap!)
        Added new features/updated Guide (now V1.3)

V1.00  Public Release (First Aminet Release)                           21/01/1999
        Fixed countless tiny little bugs (too little and too many to mention)
        Added command line for scenario files (spent 2 hours chasing a bug,
                                               "=" instead of "<>")
        Found some semi-decent objects
        Reduced Borg to ~2200 (it was too hard)
        Added DeadBy pictures. These show who you were killed by, only 
         the Borg currently work. (a picture of Locutus)
        Extended the Scenarios (and fixed the bugs that they caused)
        Re-done graphics to use brighter colours.
        Seperated the program into different archives.  This way you don't
         have to download a 4.4Mb file.
        Last Minute Changes:-
         Added extra sounds (but had to cut them down, needed too much Chip RAM)
         Changed Stupidly Big Icon for one by Roman Patzner.
         Reduced Stack to 4K, can't remember why I set it so high)
         Fixed a bug with the comms system.

          To repair damage.
        Updated Guide (now V1.4)
        Added £20 prize for first person to complete the game! (It isn't that hard)

@title "Notes About the Start Script"
==============================================================================
                    The Start Script For NTSC Users
==============================================================================

This script was supplied by the very first person to register (John Wells).
It helps NTSC users to see the bottom of the PAL screen.  It uses Degrader 
(not included) by Chris Hames, to tell the Amiga that it's a PAL Amiga and 
not an NTSC one.

This should work fine if your TV is capable of Re-Syncing to the PAL mode.  
Most new TV's are auto NTSC/PAL switching.

I haven't been able to test it though.
