This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).

For further instruction just take a look at the ingame instructions
or visit the orignal website at http://changeling.ixionstudios.com/xlogical/

If you dont like the graphic of the game, there is an alternative
gfx package in the download area of the original website.
