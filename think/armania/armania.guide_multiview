@NODE Introduction "What this program I downloaded ?"

INTRODUCTION
   This program is a " one player " mind problem based on numbers.
It has not fantastic graphics or fabulous sound,but is  able  
to attract the player who  loves puzzles...The idea is not mine(in fact
I found a puzzle like this is a magazine).

@ENDNODE
@NODE Requirements "Requirements"

REQUIREMENTS
  In order to play Arithmomania you dont have to own special hardware.It'code
is simple:no special calls,no libraries no nothing(I like writing portable
programs..) Nevertheless,a fast computer would have quicker response because 
of the complicated calculation that the program does.I have already found
a more sophisticated and faster algorithm..so if you like it,wait for
the 2.0 version of this program.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Rules "Solo Rules"
RULES
What do I have to do?
Well,the rules of the game couldn't be easier.You are in front of a 5X5 
table with 9(maximum) or less empty squares.The other 16 squares are filled
with the signs / * % - or with U dead blocks.You must try to fill the empty 
spaces with the appopriate numbers so that the equations that there exit 
(next and above the table) to become true.See below:
eg
           1 - 8 + 9  = 2                                O - O + O =2  
           * U / U -                                     * U / U -
This       2 * 4 - 7  = 1    Should be produced from eg. O * O - O =1                      
           + U + U *                                     + U + U *       
           5 + 3 - 6  = 2                                O + O - O =2   
           
          =7  =5  =12                                    =7  =5 =12


               A                                             B
               
               
So A should be produced with a starting table similar to B(maybe with fewer
empty gaps which are represented by O)    
The calculatations go  normally from left to right ...

@NODE Description "Game Description"

In Arithmomania are available the following commands:


   @{"new " LINK new}
   @{" start   " LINK start}
   @{" show " LINK show}
   @{" easy  " LINK easy}
   @{" display " LINK display}
   @{" info   " LINK info}
   @{" check " LINK check}


@ENDNODE
@node info
Using the info command a list of the available command will be displayed
@endnode info

@node check
The check command will inform the player about how many gaps has filled
correctly.
@endnode check

@node easy "easy"
Easy is a very important command.Without using the easy command the
game is played with 9 empty gaps.When you write easy the program will
ask how many gaps to show to you.So if you write 3,the puzzle will
have 9-3=6 empty gaps and will be easier.

@endnode

@NODE new "new"
@TOC Description
The new command is the most important command.It is the starting point.
When it is selected the program will produce the new puzzle-table.
Due to complicated calculations it is quite slow..so be patient


@ENDNODE
@NODE start "start"
@TOC Description

Start playing

Just after the new table is created with the new command,you are ready
to start playing.If you choose start,you will see the table and a prompt
inviting you to fill some gaps.The command here is simple(an example is 
given within the program).For example if you want to fill the gap which
is in the 1 row and in the 3 column with the value 4,you should simply
write 1 3 4.
 If you want now to delete a value eg the previus value,you should write
1 3 0.
 Just after an acceptable value is inserted in an acceptable place(the program
is checking this stuff strictly),the new face of the table is automatically
presented.If you fill all the nine empty gaps(or the empty gaps that you
have set),then autocheck will be activated to inform you whether you are
right or wrong.
 If you write then command 9 9 9 then the program will inform you about
how many correct fills you got by that time.
 If you write 0 0 0 you exit the filling gaps procedure.
 If you return afterwards (without have seen the solution with show or have 
written new) then you can continue from the point you stoped.
 During this procedure a bar is informing you about what numbers are left
unused in the table.








@ENDNODE
@node show 'Show'
With the show command the solution to the puzzle is revealed..
But be careful,do not see the solution until you are definetely sure
that you want to..After the solution is shown ,you must load another
puzzle.
@endnode
@NODE Display "Display"
@TOC Description
This is a quite simple command.When you write display the current "stop"
of your filling procedure is printed on the screen.

the amiga computers in 1993.In dt I became an amiga lover.

@ENDNODE
@node future
In the future the program should be faster(that's sure) and maybe I'll use
some special amiga characteristics to fix its "look".
I plan also to make it keep hiscores based on time that took for solution or on
difficulty of the puzzle.
Tables of different sizes (eg 6*6) is also in plan.
 
@endnode future
@node email
This program is emailware.If you use it,even once,and have any comments
to make(even bad) or suggestions for its improvement please contact with me

I hope you will "pay" me soon ...
 
 thanks Giannis.
