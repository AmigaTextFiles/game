I. Introduction to "Psycho Path"

"Psycho Path" is a simple puzzle game, involving a player controlled ...
Errr ... Thing and lots of blocks, with the idea being to end up on the 
exit having removed all the blocks by stepping on them!

"Psycho Path" is based on an old C64 PD game which once appeared on
Commodore Format.  I can't remember who wrote it, nor can I check (My C64
died a long time ago), but if you're the one, let me know!

This demo version contains 15 levels, with a password system allowing you
to return to any level you reach at a later date plus an Easy, Medium and
Hard difficulty setting.

II. Requirements for playing "Psycho Path"

To play Psycho Path, you need an Amiga with at least 1 Meg.  Any Amiga
should do, A500/+/A600/A1200/A1500/A4000/CD32, although I've only
tested it on A600's and A1200's, both with accelerators and not.  A Hard
Drive is optional as Psycho Path can be installed there, although it runs
more than happily off floppy.  Oh, you'll need a joystick!

To copy Psycho Path, just copy the files

   Psycho_Path
   Psycho_Path.info
   Psycho_Path.DAT
   Psycho_Path.guide
   Psycho_Path.guide.info
   Psycho_Path.doc
   Psycho_Path.doc.info

to whatever place you want to put them, on floppy or hard drive, but all in
the same directory.  Simple as that!

IV. Playing Instructions for "Psycho Path"

When "Psycho Path" has loaded, you'll be presented with a little menu
(Including, Free Of Charge, Bob the Fish's first public appearance!) from
which you can start a game, change the difficulty level and quit out.

The little hands at the side can be moved using the up or down on the
joystick and an option chosen with FIRE.  To change the difficulty, cycle
through Easy, Medium and Hard by selecting the option.

By selecting "Start Game" you are taken to another menu allowing you to 
start a game afresh, or enter a password from a previous game.  Select an
option as before.  The "New Game" will take you to Level 1, whereas the
"Password" option will take you to a new screen, where by using left and
right on the joystick to choose a letter and FIRE to select it, you can
enter a password.  Use the symbol like that on your ENTER key to finish
typing and the back arrow to delete.  Also, you can directly type in the
word using the keyboard, BACKSPACE and ENTER.

The difficulty setting is either Easy, Medium and Hard.  The setting
determines how long you can sit on a block.  Easy allows you to sit around
for 2 secs, Medium for 0.8 secs and Hard for a mere 0.2s.

Now onto the interesting stuff - How to actually play!  By moving the little
purpley pink thing around using the joystick, you must remove all the yellow
blocks and end up on the exit.  Simple eh?  Well, not after a few levels! 
Plus, there are some blocks, characterised by moving stripes on them which
you MUST travel over twice!  It's as simple as that really!  All the grey
blocks you can sit on for as long as you want, and blocks marked with a T
are teleporters and by pressing FIRE on top of one will move you to another.
I think that's about all you need to know ... You get 30 points for each
block you go over and a free life every 5 levels!  

You can turn the music off by pressing 'm' at pretty much and point in the
game, and 'q' will allow you to quit from a game.

I know the graphics aren't great and the music's dodgy, but the game itself
is damned addictive, and that's good enough for me!

ever happen!!!), again, is allowed so long as I am told (Moreso so I can
buy the magazine than anything!).

VIII. Other Miscellaneous Stuff

"Psycho Path" was written on my trusty A1200, A Blizzard 1230/50, 2 Meg
Chip and 8 Meg fast using AMOSPro and the AMOSPro Compiler.  

The Scary Red Demon Software website has more of my programs availble for
download.  Point your browser at http://www.scaryred.demon.co.uk.

Some more of my projects ... All details are correct as of the start of
August 1997.  Get in touch for more details!

TERDS - A Random Dot Stereogram generator allowing you to control all
        aspects of generator.  An animation feature is available as soon as
        I get round to debugging it properly!  It has been released into
        PD as version 2.30 with the Save and Print options disabled.

        State:     Completely finished and functional (Well, except for the
                   animation :)
        Completed: 95%

Ickle Train - Control little trains and make them follow a timetable!  Is a
              lot more fun than it sounds, I promise you!  Needs a bit of
              work to make it clearer what the trains have to do, but
              essentially finished.

        State:     Playable, but a bit confusing to everyone but me it
                   seems!
        Completed: 80%

Countdown - The good old Channel 4 classic makes it to the Amiga.  Fully
            playable for two players, with the one player option to be 
            added.  Features a dictionary containing 20000 words and has
            all the rounds there including numbers and conundrum.  

        State:     Needs things like title screens to be releasable, but 
                   works fine at the moment.  Also, the dictionary needs
                   proper nouns taken out of it.
        Completed: 70%

Animal Warfare - This is going to be a Command and Conquer/Warcraft clone
                 which is going to be my first AGA only game, and
                 virtually the first thing I write in Blitz.  I've managed
                 to get the map scrolling (256 colour 13x13 map of 16x16
                 pixel blocks) into one frame on my A1200 with
                 accelerator/fast mem (I've not tested with anything else 
                 yet) but it should run at an acceptable speed on a normal
     A1200.  I need help with this, especially with the
                 graphics, so if you want to help, get in touch with me!

  State:     You can move round the map and move some men ... That's
                   it though!
  Completed: Virtually started :)
