Huh?? What?? Oh, yeah.. Americans... Well, I am from Norway, so too bad for
you if you manage to destry something with this, or your kids find your
porno pics and puzzles them. I put a load function in it and that's all.


* How to pay for this

The good news is, YOU DON'T! But I WOULD appreciate a card from your
hometown or similar (cardware :-D) If you dont bother to send me a card,
send me an EMail (with your favourite picture as attachment). That should't
be to hard, should it??

* Introduction

Have you ever started a major download from a BBS on a slow line? Or made a
large backup on school, and have to sit forever to restore it at home?
Yeah, me too. The only thing I could do was play Snake or ProTris. So, I
sat down one boring x-mas (1995) and made this little thingy. It probably
contains a lot of bugs, so when you find one, send me some mail and I will
try to fix it.


* Instructions

Well, it should be easy. First you load a picture (for the time being it HAS
to be 640 x 512, sorry (nah, not really. Use a monitor)) and you should be
able to see it while it loads. When it is done, it sets the colors right,
and when this is done, you might loose the menus. That is, they are still
there, but if the first 4 colors of the palette is very dark, or equal, you
won't be reading the menus so well. So learn the shortcuts. When you look
at the original picture, you can shuffle it (Amiga S). Now the picture
should be shuffled, with pieces the size you chose (128x128 is default).
You click on a piece, and it is copied to the small window, the piece in
thw small window is copied to the screen. And you keep clicking until you
have the picture (or think you have).Then you can check it (Amiga C). This
is a problem with the colors being bad, but the small one says you have
made it, and the large one says you are no way near. And that's that.


* Requirements

You need an Amiga of course. You also need the AGA chipset, because I open a
256 colors screen. You should also need some ram. I have 2 chip and 12 fast
and that is enough :-)


* Limitations

Hmm, I guess there are a few. Do not change the size after you shuffle the
picture. I haven't fixed that yet, so you would probably just fuck up
evertything. Also the pictures HAS to be 640x512. Use your favourite Image
processing tool to fix you faveourite pictures. And that should be that.
Hopefully it will also work on graphics cards. I open the screen in doublepal
mode, so if you can't open it, use a screen promotor.
