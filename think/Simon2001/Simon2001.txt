What is this?
This is one of the oldest game ideas there is, I don't know where it first
appeared. I did have it on the C64 but I know it's older than that!
The objective is to repeat a sequence of hi-lighted buttons accompanied
by sounds. Thereof the name: Simon (Simon Says).
This game have 100 levels but I doubt anyone will ever reach that...
At the C64 game a friend of mine reached near 70!!! - You'll see what that
means when you've played some - My record is about 19 or something!...

History:
This is/was an old AMOS routine that I wrote in 1991!!!
I added a nicer interface in 1997 (v2.0).
This version is sligthy polished up and recompiled for OS3.1 compatability.

Keys:
Use arrow-keys to repeat sequences.

Nature of the game:
1. The sequence is played faster by each level.

No Options.
Esc or CTRL-C Quits.

Mail me for bug reports, comments or suggestions.

Happy Playin'!
