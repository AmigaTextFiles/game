This programm was first seen under  Windows 3.0 tm . It had the name
Minesweeper and the only drawback it had, was: it was a MS-DOS program.
So this is the Amiga-version.

        Kickstart 1.2 or greater

Imagine you are the captain of a ship and you have to clear the sea from
mines. Instead of doing that in reality (only some people do that), you can
now play this game on your computer.


How to start the game:

    Shell:
 !    If you start Mineclearer from the shell, mind that you have to
 !    set the stack to size 12000 (type: "stack 12000"), otherwise
 !    the program may run out of stackspace and crash.

    Workbench:
      Just doubleclick the icon.


How to play the game:

    After starting the game you will see the game screen with an empty
    field in the middle of the screen. A number of mines (displayed
    on the lower left side of the screen (Mines left)) is hidden in
    this field.
    Your task is to mark all the hidden mines correctly. The time you
    will need is measured and used for a top-ten table.


    Things you will need to know to play:

    Left mousebutton:
        If you click with the left mousebutton in a field, it will be
        checked if you pointed out a mine. If this happened, the game is
        over. 
        Otherwise a number ranging from 1 to 8 will be displayed at that
        position. This number represents the number of mines adjacent to the
        field you clicked at. If the field has no adjacent mines, all
        connected fields, which have no adjacent mines, will be revealed. The
        fields, which are neighbors to that empty fields are displayed, too.

        For example:

        Field before you clicked:
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #

        Field after you clicked:
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  1  1  1  #  #  #
                #  1  .  1  3  #  #
                #  2  1  .  1  #  #
                #  F  1  .  1  #  #
                #  #  1  1  1  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #

        Another function of the left mousebutton: If you click at a number
        (denoting the numbers of mines in the vicinity), the fields, which
        are not visible yet will be pressed down, so you can see how many
        adjacent fields remain.


    Right mousebutton:
        The right mousebutton is used to set and remove flags. You use these
        flags to tell the computer where you think that mines are.
        A position, where a flag should be in the above gamefield, is denoted
        by a "F". At this position has to be a mine, because the upper right
        field shows that it has 1 (one) mine as neighbor and the only free
        field where a mine could be, is the field where the F is.

    Shift + left mousebutton:
        This is probably the most important thing with playing Mineclearer.
        When you are sure that you placed your last flag correctly, you can
        click with shift + left mousebutton on a field, where a number is
        displayed. The game will check if there is a mine where your flag is
        an then reveal all other neighbors of the field you clicked in
        unless they have not already numbers. If there was no mine at the
        position of the flag, that will be the end of the game.

        Example: 

        Before you click at position "a":
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  1  1  1  #  #  #
                #  1  .  1  3  #  #
                #  2  1  .  1  #  #
                #  F  1  .  1  #  #  Assume that there is a mine at "F"
                #  #  1a 1  1  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #

        You clicked at the position "a":
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  1  1  1  #  #  #
                #  1  .  1  3  #  #
                #  2  1  .  1  #  #
                #h F  1  .  1  #  #
                #g 1b 1a 1  1  #  #
                #f 1c .d 1e #  #  #

        The positions b-e have been revealed. Now you could click at "b" to
        reveal the fields f-h.

    Example with wrong set flag:
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #
                #  1  1  1  #  #  #
                #  1  .  1  3  #  #
                #  2  1  .  1  Fw #
                #  #  1  .  1a #  #
                #  #  1  1  1  #  #
                #  #  #  #  #  #  #

        At the position w is no mine, therefore the flag is wrong. If you now
        click at position a, the game will be over and the wrong set flag
        will be displayed.

    Amiga + H:
        This activates the helpmode. The line "Help: inactive" will change to
        the line "Help:   active" and vice versa. Help is activated by
        pressing the key "Help".

    Help:
        If you press Help, a red cross will be displayed at a position where
        no mine is. In the first part of the game this position will have no
        mines as neighbors and so you may get a pretty big field revealed,
        but later on you may get numbers as well (when the program ran out of
        empty fields).

        NOTE:
           -If help is on and you start a new game, a red cross will be
            displayed.
           -Every help you use will add 5 seconds to your game time.
           -You have 7 (seven) helps.
           -Help is only available when a game is running, otherwise the
            screen will blink.

    There are 4 modes to play: beginner, semiprofi, profi and custom. Each
    differ in field size and number of mines. With the 4th mode (custom-mode)
    you can create your own field. Just enter width and height of your field
    and the percent of mines it should contain.

    If you win a game in beginner-, semipro- or profi-mode, you may enter your
    name in the top-ten table, which will be saved when you quit the program
    (Sorry: there are no high-scores for custom-mode).

    Menustuff:
        The menus should be fairly self-explanatory.

        All items from the Project-menu are reachable via command-sequences
        (Amiga + command key). These shortcuts will only work if the mouse is
        NOT over the minefield because the right mousebutton is needed for
        setting and removing flags and therefore the menus are deactivated.


 !!! If all the above sounds confusing to you, play some games and you will
 !!! see, it is not that complicated.

 Additional note: the supplied score-list is real!

Things to do:

    - Sound
    - Bigger minefield (?)
    - What else ???

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version History:

   02.09.1991           Version 1.0c
        Remove some superfluous code => executable is now smaller.
        Wrote documentation. Ran it under Kickstart 2.0. Worked well.

   28.08.1991
        Added NTSC-support. Program should now run on any NTSC-Amiga.
        I still don't know if it runs on Kickstart 2.0 (but I don't see
        why it should not).
        Tuning again.

   15.08.1991
        Added final things like About-window. Optical work, tuning
   
   11.08.1991        Version 1.0b
        Removed codeline causing Guru (2h work, phew). Fixed text (German
        and English mixed).
        Optimizing code.
    
   Version 1.0
        Program runs with subtle gurus (sometimes).
