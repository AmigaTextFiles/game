This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).

For further information read the original README or take a look at the
original website at http://mures.sourceforge.net/

PS: If the Pegasos doesn't support 3D-HW you'll have to start the program
by typing in shell "Mures --no3d".

PPS: Type "Mures --help" in shell for additional parameters.
