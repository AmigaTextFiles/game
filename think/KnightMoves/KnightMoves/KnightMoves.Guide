@{b}Knight Moves v1.0@{ub}

A simple game based on the Knight in chess.

The objective of the game is simply to move your knight to every square on
the 8x8 board.

On the title screen, select either PLAY to start the game, OPTIONS for the options screen or QUIT to exit.

On the options screen, click on Music On to turn the music on or click on
Music Off to turn it off.  Click anywhere else to return to the title screen
without making a change.

When play is selected, the board is displayed and the Knight placed at a
random position on it.  Question marks show possible moves.  Click on a
question mark to move to that space.  A cross will mark the space you just
left and the space cannot be returned to.

The game is over when either no more moves are available or you have visited
every square on the board.

@NODE Bugs "Known Bugs"

Usual problems when running on NTSC screens in that the bottom of the screen gets cut off.  Until I can fix this by redoing the screens for NTSC I am reliably informed that the problem can be overcome by using AmigaToDoublePAL (By Nico Francois) and Degrader (By Chris Hames) with the parameters 50Hz 50HzSystem SurviveNoResets and NoEditOp.

@NODE History "History"

@{b}v1.0@{ub} : 04/01/98 - Initial version.
@{b}v1.1@{ub} : 21/06/98 - Added in-game QUIT option.
                         - Display number of successful moves on GAME OVER                            screen.
                         - Fixed a silly bug - counter was not being reset 
                           after each game so it was possible to visit more
                           than 64 squares!
@ENDNODE

@NODE Future "Future"
