This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).

For further instruction just take a look at the original Readme
or visit the original website at http://www.parallelrealities.co.uk/q.php


Note: The program normally looks for a picture called "license.jpg" at the
first start. Unfortunately I could not find this in the original source
package (maybe it is in one of the .rpm-files on the homepage).
Therefore I already copied a "config"-file into the distribution, which
prevents the looking for this "license.jpg" (normally this file will be
created after the first start automatically).


Note2: I had to change some levels as there have been marbles outside of
the visible range - meaning, that even if you managed to send all your
marbles into their respective home the level did not finish.
The original levels are still in the data-directory with the extension
"_org".
