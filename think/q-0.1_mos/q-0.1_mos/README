PLAYING

	Playing is simple. The object of the game is to move the balls into the correct colored
	squares. When the balls are moved they carry on moving in that direction until they either
	hit a wall or another ball.
	
	Select a ball with the left mouse button. When a ball is selected arrows for possible
	directions will be shown. Click on these arrows to move the ball in the desired direction.
	The level is cleared once you have moved all the balls into their correct homes. Balls
	cannot be retrieved once this is done, so be careful.


CONTROLS

	Left Mouse 	- Select ball / Move ball in arrow direction
	Escape 		- Access in game menu.
	F10 			- Toggle fullscreen mode

	
FEEDBACK

	There are only 10 levels. I'll be adding more in future and also adding the map editor. There
	are currently no options to play around with either, so this will be added too.
