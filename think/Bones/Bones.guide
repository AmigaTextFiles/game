Description:    1 player Dominoe game

Revision:       3.1

Instructions:
                The files:

                            "COMPONENTS"
                            "Bones.guide"
                            "Bones.brush"
                            "jingle001"
                            "sweepdown.iff"
                            "blacklight"
                            "light"

                MUST be in the current directory.
                Also, you MUST have a copy of Multiview in the current
                directory as well. If you prefer to use another AMIGAGUIDE
                viewer, just copy it to the directory that contains the
                above files and rename it to "Multiview".

                Dominoes (at least the way I was taught to play)
                Starts off by 4 players shuffling and dividing 28 dominoes
                (7 each). The dominoes range from DOUBLE BLANK - DOUBLE SIX.
                In the first round, the player with BIG SIX (the
                double six) starts. BIG SIX is now the "spinner". The next
                player, to the left, has to play a dominoe, with a six on it,
                to the north or south of the spinner. Now game play proceeds
                with players taking turns placing dominoes on the ends of the
                "star" trying to score (see @{"SCORING" LINK "scoring"}). You can't place
                dominoes to the east and west of the spinner until BOTH the
                north and the south sides have been played on. If you don't
                have a dominoe to play, you must skip a turn. If NO ONE has a
                play then the game is LOCKED (see @{"LOCKED" LINK "locked"}).
                Game play continues until a player hasn't any dominoes left.
                He is deemed the  winner, gets DOMINOE points (see @{"SCORING" LINK "scoring"})
                and get's to decide the spinner for the next round. After
                the first round, the spinner can be ANY double the winner
                chooses. If, at the beginning of a round, any player has at
                least 4 doubles, that player can opt not to play this hand.
                The dominoes are reshuffled and the process starts from the
                beginning.

LOCKED:    When no player can play on any side, the game is LOCKED.
           Each player adds up the total dots in their hand. The player
           with the lowest amount is the winner. They are awarded points,
           (see @{"SCORING" LINK "scoring"}), BUT DON'T GET TO CHOOSE A NEW SPINNER. Instead
           the dominoes are reshuffled and re-divied and the player with
           BIG SIX starts the new round.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "scoring" "SCORING"
@TOC "MAIN"
SCORING:        There are 4 ways to scoring playing BONES.

                I.  When placing a dominoe on one end of the "star", the
                    value of that end, is the number showing. If the dominoe
                    placed on the end is a double bone then the value is
                    is double the number. (i.e. double 3 placed on the north
                    side makes the north side equal to 6) If all the ends
                    add up to a number that is a multiple of 5 (i.e. 5, 10,
                    15, 20, 25, etc..) the player who placed the bone gets
                    that number added to his/her score. HOWEVER, the east and
                    west sides value are equal to 0 until they are played on.
                    And remember, you can't play on them until the north and
                    south sides have been played on first.
                    See @{"SAMPLES" LINK "samples"}.

               II.  When a player DOMINOES, all of the dots remaining in
                    the other players hands are added together and rounded up
                    or down, to the nearest multiple of 5. That number is
                    added to the WINNERS score.

              III.  When the game is @{"LOCKED" LINK "locked"}, as mentioned above, all players
                    add up the total dots in their hands. The player with the
                    lowest amount of dots gets the points. The amount of
                    points awarded is determined by adding up all of the OTHER
                    players dots and rounding up or down to the nearest
                    multiple of 5.

               IV.  Starting the round with BIG FIVE... 10 points awarded.

Samples:
               Sample 1:
               Let's say the north side has a two(2) showing, the
               south side has a double three(3), the east and the
               west sides have yet to be played on. If you have the
               "2 - 4" dominoe and place it on the NORTH side, then
               you score 10 points (4+6=10).

                            actual values           showing values

                                  4                       4

                              0       0                6      6

                                  6                       33


               Sample 2:
               Same scenerio except the east has five(5) showing
               and the west has a double blank. Naturally the
               player, who just played has scored 15 points.
               (4+5+6=15)

                          actual values           showing values

                                4                       4
                                                            0
                            5       0               5       0

                                6                       33

                Let's say you have the DOUBLE FIVE(5) and place
                it on the west side. Now you have just scored
                20 points. (4+10+6=20)

                          actual values           showing values

Game Play:

       KEYBOARD:
                At the "Choose Dominoe" point, where the dominoes are
                rotating on the left and right, you choose a dominoe by
                hitting a 1-7 key. If you hit a key and wish to change
                your mind, just hit another number. The dominoe you
                choose will become highlighted. Now, Confirm the choice
                by hitting the carrige return <CR> key. You choose where
                to play it by pressing N, S, E or W, afterwards hitting
                the <CR> key to confirm. The arrow, indicating your choice
                of direction, will blink. If you change your mind and want
                to change the dominoe you want to play, while the computer
                waits for a "where input", type "B" and you will be taken
                back to the "choose dominoe" point. If you want to quit,
                just get to the "choose dominoe" point and type "Q" or
                choose QUIT in the menu at any time.

          MOUSE:
                Game control via the mouse is pretty self explainatory.
                All of the indications are the same as in the KEYBOARD
                control explaination (above).........


                                JUST POINT AND CLICK.
