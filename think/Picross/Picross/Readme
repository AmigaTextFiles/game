 Welcome to Picross

 Picross is a puzzle game for your Amiga, it is basically a clone of the 
 Nintendo game "Mario's Picross" for the GameBoy handheld. There are a 
 few differences but the concept of the game is the same.

 For all of you who have never played Mario's Picross or any other 
 Picross (sometimes called Paint by Numbers or Griddler), the objective 
 is simple. On each level you're trying to draw a 15x15 pixels picture
 using numbers to guide you. More on how to play the game to come later.

 This is not a final release of the game. This version is more of a demo
 of what to come and to get it out sometime I decided to shamefully steal
 some levels from other Picross games out there:
 
 - Levels 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 are borrowed from Nintendo's 
   Mario's Picross
 - Levels 24 and 25 are borrowed from TylerK's Picross

 When the final release is done, there will not be any 'stolen' levels, 
 if you are interested in creating some levels for the game, please 
 contact me, E-Mail address can be found below.


 Requirements
 
 - Amiga computer or emulator
 - 1MB of RAM (will try and make the final version work with 512kB but
   we'll see about that, who has an Amiga with only 512kB now anyways?)
 - A Mouse (!)


 Installation

 - There is no installation script provided, just run the game from where
   you unpacked it.


 Some things that will (hopefully) be in the final version

 - Something happening when you complete all levels
 - More levels
 - Time on each level, and a highscore list
 - Maybe a penalty system like the one used in Mario's Picross, if you
   make a mistake the game will tell you this and correct it for you
   but you get a time penalty.
 - More graphics
 - Longer pieces of music


 Thanks to:

 - Patrik Axelsson (patrik) for some optimization help, now the game 
   should be fully playable on a 68000 machine!
 - Tobias Söderlund (Legerdemain) for some levels and suggestions.
