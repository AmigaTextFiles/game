|   OBJECT OF BEBOP 'N DROP   |
-------------------------------

BeBop 'N Drop has two modes of play:  Tournament and Practice.  You can
play both modes as a single player or as a two player team.   The object
of Practice mode is to pick a level your not very good at and get better
or to play a level you cannot normally reach or to just play your favorite
levels. The object of the Tournament mode is to play all 50/27 levels in
order and see the BeBop Bopper at the end.

Each level is mastered when you successfully create and drop the number of
horizontal rows noted on that game level or complete a row containing the
treasure piece, if one exists.  

--------------------
|   INSTALLATION   |
--------------------

STEP A. From Workbench, drag the "BB&D" drawer icon over to the desired 
        place on your floppy or hard disk.
  or:
        From CLI or a copy program copy the entire "BB&D" directory and
        the "BB&D.info" file to your floppy or hard disk.

STEP B. Double click on this new "BB&D" drawer icon. 

STEP C. Double click on the "BeBop Demo" icon to begin the demo.

NOTES:
     (1) The BeBop 'N Drop game uses the "iff.library" file in the "BB&D"
         directory to load its graphics files. If you would rather place
         this file in your systems LIBS: directory, the game will work
         fine in this configuration also.
     (2) If any error messages appear while starting the game and refer
         to a missing font(s), please install them onto your hard disk from
         your Workbench master disks. ( See Instructions Below ) 


*************************************************************************
  FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS ONLY IF THE GAME DOES NOT START PROPERLY !! 
*************************************************************************

     In order to run BeBop 'N Drop, it is necessary to have certain files 
installed on your system or boot disk. This boot disk can be either
a floppy or hard disk. These files are listed below:

  LIBS:DiskFont.Library
  FONTS:diamond.font, FONTS:diamond/12, FONTS:garnet.font, FONTS:garnet/9
  FONTS:topaz.font, FONTS:topaz/8
  
All files should be present if you originally copied the entire contents
of Workbench onto your hard disk or boot floppy.

NOTE:   Newer versions of Dos may not have the topaz/8 font on the 
-----   distribution disks as it is in ROM. 

   If you boot from a floppy or hard disk that does not have the above 
mentioned files, they can be copied from your original workbench disk
into the proper directories with any file copy utility.

--------------------------------------

 double-click on the "BeBop Demo" icon.  The title screen will appear.

|	MOVING THE PIECES            |
--------------------------------------

For one player:  You can use either the left side of the keyboard or the
 numeric keypad, whichever works best for you!  The chart below explains
 how the keys function.

For two player: Use the both the left and right side of the keyboard, and
 use the space bar to drop both pieces faster. The chart below explains
 how the keys function.  (Note:  The keyboard only accepts one key at a
 time, so you have to share time, or you will steal the other player's key
 stroke.)

--------------------------------------
|	THE OPTIONS SCREEN           |
--------------------------------------
	The options screen allows you to choose which mode of play you
 desire for BeBop 'N Drop.  You may select either a one player or two
 player game and when in a one player game you can select a starting level.
 Selecting level one will place you in the tournament mode, any other level
 will select the practice mode. 

--------------------------------------
|	USING THE OPTIONS SCREEN...  |
--------------------------------------

1. To select a level, use the left mouse button to click on the up or down
 arrow.  If you click and hold, the numbers will cycle faster.

2. To change from one to two player, use the left mouse button to click in
 the "Players" box.  It will toggle between one player and two player.

3. To play the selected game, click the left mouse button once in the
 "Main Screen box" and click "Start" to begin play.

NOTE:
-----

  In this demo version any of the 25 one-player and 12 two-player games
may be selected. However, if you select any level other than 1 which
begins tournament play, the game will be limited to dropping 3 rows
on that particular level.

------------------------------------------
|   DIFFERENT LEVELS ARE DIFFERENT !!!   |
------------------------------------------

 The game board shapes are different.  The piece sets are different.
 The special pieces and effects are different. Some levels contain treasure
 and others contain special pieces to help you on your way.  Some levels
 contain secrets, and some contain traps.  Some levels are fast--others
 aren't.  So, Go For it!

	And yes, the treasure pieces look different.  After all, if you are
 a poker player, extra chips are treasure, but if you are a car, a can of
 gasoline is treasure.

------------------------------
|   BEBOP PUZZLE OPERATION   |
------------------------------

	Some levels contain a puzzle.  Every time you drop two to four
 rows, you receive a few moments to work on the puzzle.  This will be
 indicated by a red flashing bar above the picture puzzle. If you drop more
 than two rows, you get more time.  The red bar will get smaller and
 smaller indicating your time is running out to work on the puzzle. 
 Use the mouse to solve the puzzle by pointing to the piece you want to
 move.  When you click the left button, that piece will move to the open
 spot (shown as a green square block).
	Finishing a puzzle alters the special effects, special pieces and
 Super Bonuses that are available for that level.  (Note, we don't promise
 a helpful change.)

-------------------------------------------
|	EDITOR IN DEMO VERSION !!!        |
-------------------------------------------

	The editor screen has been enabled in the demo version to show you
the control you have over piece design, sound assignments, board design,
special effects control, and more. 

	The only control you have is over the design of the current levels
pieces, should you pause the game and enter the editor (cheat...did someone
say cheat???). The instructions are as follows:

    1) Select the piece to edit by clicking on the piece number up/down
       arrows. Piece numbers # 1-14 may be selected.
                       
    2) Turn piece blocks off/on by pointing and clicking the left mouse
       button at the desired block location in the piece matrixes. 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   WARNING   !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	PLAYING WITH THE PIECE GRAPHICS COULD CAUSE BEBOP 'N DROP
TO OPERATE INCORRECTLY!!!!   ( DO NOT MAKE ANY INVISIBLE PIECES )

	A manual with be included with the final version providing detailed
guidelines to create your own or alter existing game levels.

-------------------------------------------
|	TROUBLE SHOOTING AND HINTS        |
-------------------------------------------

1. When a new board appears, you can hit the pause button and study it.

2. Watch carefully when a new piece appears and learn the different shapes
   it becomes in each rotation.

3. Play the diagonal keys.  Some levels cannot be beaten without them.

4. Two player pieces can be merged to form a new piece.  They must land
   simultaneously for this to work.

5. As you drop more and more rows, new piece shapes can appear.  Sometimes
   the new shapes makes it harder to solve the level.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Appendix A: Special Pieces (Some may not appear in demo version)  |
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	These fall randomly.  Each level uses different special pieces
 and has a different chance for each piece occurring.

Acid        - Eliminates a few acid-able pieces in its path.

Bomb        - This piece explodes as soon as it lands on anything.  It
              eliminates several pieces around it, often leaving an awkward
              hole.

Burning     - Eliminates a few burnable pieces in its path.

Filler      - Put this single square piece in a hole and the hole will be
              plugged.

Impregnable - These pieces are immune to burning. 

Mutate      - If the piece changes shape uncontrollably and looks bizarre
              as it falls, it is mutating.  You can never be sure just what
              shape this piece will be when it lands.  Once it obtains a
              useful shape, use the space bar to drop it quickly - before
              it changes again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  Appendix B: Special Effects (Some may not appear in demo version)  |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	These occur randomly and have a percent chance of being triggered
 when a level drops or when a new piece occurs. The percent and the special
 effect differ from level to level.

Air Raid        - Single square bombing pieces that randomly drop all over
                  the game board.

Fast            - You can control this piece, if you can keep up with it!

Filler          - You can control this single square piece.  If you place
                  it in a hole, the hole will be plugged. 

Fire Storm      - Single square burning pieces that randomly drop all over
                  the game board.

Invisible Piece - When this piece falls you can only see it by pressing a
                  movement or rotation key. 

Magnetic Walls  - The left or right wall changes.  Pieces are attracted to
                  this wall as they fall. Yes a piece can get stopped
                  diagonally!

Pile Driver     - You can control this long, tall piece.  It smushes any
                  border or playing piece it lands on. 

Vaccine         - This single square piece fills a 3x3 square section where
                  it lands. You control where it lands.

Virus           - This single square piece randomly erases a 3x3 square
                  section where it lands.  You control where it lands.

Laser Tank      - Drives across the screen and eliminates the row it drives
                  through.

Mad Bomber      - Walks across the screen and drops a bomb.  The bomb
                  eliminates surrounding pieces.

--------------------------------
|  Appendix C: Super Bonuses   |
--------------------------------

Super bonuses build up, on enabled levels, when you drop 3 or 4 rows
together. They are as follows:

Filler Pieces     - Use these single square pieces to fill in holes.

Vaccine           - See above.

Row Filler        - A single piece that you can control.  It fills and
                    drops the row in which it lands.

Pile Driver       - See above. 

Super Vaccine     - This single piece that you can control fills in a 5x5
                    block grid where it lands.

Column Filler     - A single piece that you can control.  It fills the
                    column that it lands in to the level of the highest
                    piece on the board.

Super Pile Driver - With this you get one Pile Driver per column on the game
                    board.  You cannot control these pieces.

Super Row Filler  - Several row fillers fall, you have no control over where
                    they land.  They fill and drop the rows in which they
                    land.
