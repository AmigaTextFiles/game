Information
~~~~~~~~~~~
I am not in any way resonsible  for loss of data, loss  of sanity, loss of
IQ and the possiblity of becoming adicted ;-)

Since this game is Shareware  the price for this  disk must not exceed the
cost for disk and postage.

This  document  must  be  distrubuted  along  with  the Tubes program. The
spreading  archive  must  not  include  *ANY*  mailbox   advertisments  or
additional texts.

Tubes and this document must not be altered in any way (excluding spelling
mistakes!) without written permission.

The full AMOS source code  is available when  sending a small donation ;-)
(Since now, I've not got anything for *all* my shareware games :-( ).

The Game
~~~~~~~~
This is yet another pipelining game, in which you simple must build a long
pipeline using randomly  chosen tube-parts. In  addition, there's a narrow
time limit and ofcourse most of the  tubes do not come in that order *you*
are actually  hopeing for. Erroneous placed  tubes can be destroyed  using
the right mousebutton but as  nothing is  free in life, this will cost you
5 seconds of your valuable remaining time.

When the time has run out or you've placed all the tubes, that were avail-
able in this level, the water begins to  flow. If you have set the tubes 0
correctly the water will  flow through a certain amount of pipes before it
runs out. According to the stage this amount be sufficient or not. If not,
the game is over.

Sometimes some  tubes are already  placed at the begin of the level. Using
these tiles will score you extra points (they count the same as loops).
However, if they aren't used, they are fixed to place and cannot be pushed
by the bulldozer.

After  each  completed  level, you can  grab a few more  points by kickin'
unused tubes from  the screen using a bulldozer. This  bulldozer can  only
push but  not pull tubes. Quit this section either with the  escape key or
the right mouse button. For this bonus-game, there's *NO* timelimit.

To grab another big pile of points, there are two more bonus games.

In the Shuffle part, the screen is totally filled with tubes, which can be
shifted to  the left or right  rowwise or up  or down  columnwise. It is a
very tricky thing, but if  you want to get a higher  score, why not try as
best as  you can? ;-) One warning: Watch  the whole screen when  shuffling
the tiles and check from time  to time, if your pipeline is ok, and please
keep track of the remaining time!

The other bonus game is a kind of 'Tetris' or better: Tubetris. Tube parts
are falling from top of the screen to the bottom. Move the falling tube to
the left or the right and try to build some funny pipelines. When the time
is over or all tubes have been used up, the water starts to flow from each
water container at the bottom of the screen.

The Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tubes can  be controlled  by  mouse, keyboard  or  joystick. Normally, you
should use a mouse for tubes. The keytable is explained below.

In  the normal game, you  can press the  left mousebutton to  place a pipe
onto the  playfield. The right mousebutton is  used to destroy tubes, that
have been set  there by mistake. Press  'P' to pause the game  or 'Esc' to
start the water flowing.

In the bulldozer  bonus game, you must first  place the bulldozer  at your
desired  place and  then  will get some  kind of  controle-arrows near the
bulldozer. Move the mouse to change the direction and press the left mouse
button to  steer the vehicle  in that direction. The section  will be exit
automatically, if  there  are  no  tube-parts  anymore  that  can be moved
around. In addition, you  can quit it by  hand using  either right  mouse-
button or the escape key.

The shuffle bonus game is  very easy to control: Move the mouse to left or
to the right to get the arrow into  the right place. Please remember, that
moving the mouse up or down  has *NO* effect. Press the  left mouse button
at the  desired place to  shift a whole row or column in the direction the
arrow is  facing or the right  mousebutton  for the other direction. Press
'P' to pause or escape to start the water.

In the Tubetris bonus game, move your mouse left or right to select target
row. Press the left mouse button or cursor down to speed up the falling of
a tile or if you don't like the  game, press the Escape key or right mouse
button to skip the Tubetris part.

Keyboard controls:
P      : Pause game
M      : Toggle music
S      : Toggle sound
Esc    : Start water
Space  : Place tube
Del    : Destroy tube
Amiga-A: Switch to workbench (warning: game continues!)

Use the Cursor-Keys to move the tubes around.

There is a  new feature  since Tubes V1.5. You  may save a game  screen to
disk  as an IFF-picture if  you want to  show your friends  what wild  and
wicked pipelines you have managed to build. To do this, press and hold the
Ctrl-Key when the water runs out from the end of a pipeline  until you get
an  information  line which  says, that  the  screen has  been  saved. The
picture will be saved "TubesRecord.iff" into the  directory you've started
the game from. For myself, I managed to get 100% once. Who doesn't believe
it, I can send him a picture of ;-).

Scoring
~~~~~~~
Normal game and shuffle game:
For each tube  the water runs through  you get 25 points. Loops (i.e. when
the water  crosses it's  path) score  additonally 100  points and  equal 4
normal tubes (that means the more loops you've got, the shorter a pipeline
can  be to  complete the  level). This is  the same  for preset  tubes you
didn't  set but  let  the water  flow  through. In  higher  levels, it  is
essential  to build loops to  finish the  level  successfully! If  you use
*EVERY* tube  in this  level you  will get a perfect bonus of 1000 points!
The remaining time is multipled by five and added to the score.

Bulldozer game:
This one is very simple. For each pipe  that is pushed from the screen you
will get 25 points.

Saving the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since V1.6 you  can save  your current  game  state (i.e only in  the main
game) by pressing the help  key. To avoid abuse  of this feature, the game
is then quitted  and you cannot play  on for ten minutes. When you restart
tubes, your  saved  game is  continued  immediately. Currently, it  is not
possible to save  in bonus  game, but you  will see this  feature in  near
future.

The Displays
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To the right of your screen you can see some displays. These show:
- The current level number
- Your score
- The remaining time
- The number of tubes of the current tube and the total amount of tubes in
  this level
- The next tile(s)

During  the flow of  the water  you also  get a display of  the percentage
you've currently  reached  and if it reaches  100 percent you've completed
the level.
