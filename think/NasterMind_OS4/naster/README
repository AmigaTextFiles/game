The objective of the game is to guess the secret code. you can do this by making a guess.
depending on your guess you will be told a couple of things. a white peg means that one of
your choices is the correct colour, just in the wrong spot. A black peg says that one of 
your choices is both the correct colour, and in the wrong spot. The location of the peg
has no corilation with the location of the correct choice.

click on the colours you want to guess put them in there locations and click make guess
you can also pick colous with the a s d f z x c and v key.
to close the program just press Esc
other then that it is pretty simple.
