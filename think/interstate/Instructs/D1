  I would like to acknowledge  
   the many Amiga owners who   
 have hung in there during the 
 bad times at Commodore.  Hang 
           in there!           
                               
      Greets to Panther!       
                               
   And thank you for adding    
   InterState:The Game into    
  your collection. Have Fun!
