InterState:The Game pits player
against computer in a cross    
country race of 5000 miles (5  
rounds of a 1000 miles each).  
During your driving, you must  
slow or stop your enemy, while 
fixing a dent, changing a tire,
or filling the gas tank on your
own car.                       
                               
After the computer sorts the   
108 playing cards, your pointer
will re-appear.  At that time  
you may make a move or choose  
a menu option (See MENU).  To  
do the former, you must first  
choose your move option.       
In the center of the screen are
two boxes marked PLAY and      
DISCARD.  Click in the one you 
wish to do.  The other will    
vanish highlighting the choice.
If you wish to change your     
mind, click in the alternate   
box.  It's word will reappear  
and the previously chosen will 
be gone.  The card to be played
or discarded can then be chosen
by clicking on one of the seven
cards in your hand (under the  
windshield).  If you discard,  
a garbage can smack will sound 
and the card will be placed in 
the discard pile (middle of    
center column).  If you play   
that card, the appropriate     
action will be taken.  If it is
not a legal move, a warning    
buzzer will sound and you must 
re-enter both the PLAY/DISCARD 
command and the card.          
                               
There are five rounds.  At the 
start of each, the cards are   
reshuffled and dealt.  A round 
ends when a player reaches 1000
miles in the distance odometer 
or no more cards remain.  This 
will be indicated when a card  
in your hand is not replaced   
with another card from the     
deck.  The winner will be      
decided after the fifth round. 
Good Luck!

  About:Author Information     
Hazards, like Nail In Tire,    
Syphon Fuel, & Fender Bender,  
can be played in defense only  
if your opponent has a Roll    
card in his Status slot and    
does not have the corresponding
Safety Card to protect him (See
CARD AMOUNTS). NOTE:Fender     
Bender will only shake screen  
if sound is turned on.         
                               
Speed Limit is a special hazard
in that the player may still   
travel, but only 25 or 50 miles
maximum per turn.  It does not 
effect the ROLL Status, however
it can only be played when the 
enemy's status is Roll.        
                               
Stop will stop your foe.  Play 
Roll/Green Light to restart.   
Repairs (Extra Tire, Fuel, &   
Fix Car) will repair their     
appropriate hazards.  A Roll   
card to continue is still a    
must unless you have a Green   
Light safety in your Safety    
row.  (See GREEN LIGHT)        
                               
End Speed Limit will lift the  
25-50 mile limit, played at any
time a Speed Limit is active.  
                               
Roll, although not really a    
repair, will cure the Stop     
invoked upon you.              
Safeties (Steel Tire, Spare    
Tank, and Driving Expert) will 
make you immune to their       
appropriate hazards.  They may 
be played at any turn, but try 
and save them.  To use them as 
a repair will cause a Point    
Bonus worth 200 points.        
The Green Light Safety will    
give you a permanent Roll card 
and immunity from Stop and     
Speed Limit hazards.  Using    
this safety to lift either will
result in a Point Bonus (200   
points).  May be played as a   
Roll card with all benefits    
intact, except a Point Bonus   
will not be granted upon using 
it if the Stop Status resulted 
from a Hazard.                 
The Point Bonus is a 200 point 
gain, given when a safety is   
used to repair a hazard. All   
effort should be made to keep  
the safety in your hand as long
as possible for maximum        
scoring.  (See CARD AMOUNTS to 
find out the proper card rela- 
tionships).                    
Mileage may be played anytime  
you have a ROLL Status, except 
75, 100, & 200 can only be used
when a speed limit is not in   
affect against you.  Also a    
player may only utilize two 200
mile cards in a single round.  
Wild cards may be played in    
place of any card, excluding a 
safety or 200 mile card.  When 
selected, a window will open   
with possible choices.  Click  
on the needed card.  To accept 
hit OKAY or to cancel your     
selection, click on FORGET IT! 
You will have a chance to then 
play your chosen card...       
Scores are as follows:         
  Mileage (Distance traveled)  
  Completed Trip      400 pts  
  Shut Out            500 pts  
  Safeties            100 each 
  Point Bonus         200 each 
Shut out is when your opponent 
shows 00000 mileage in it's    
distance counter at round's    
end.
