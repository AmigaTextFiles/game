   THE KEYS STILL HANGING,   
   IN THE IGNITION'S MAW!!   
       SLAMMING A DOOR       
     WON'T GET YOU FAR!!     
     ESPECIALLY IF IT IS     
     YOUR BRAND NEW CAR!     
   THE LIGHTS ARE PRETTY!!   
   RED, YELLOW AND GREEN!!

    A LONG WAY TO JOURNEY    
    EXHAUSTION, IT'S DEEP    
      BETTER NOT TRY IT

      GOT OUT OF HAND!!      
      WATCH THOSE EXITS      
         AT 60 PER!!         
    WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE    
      A GREAT CUSTOMER!      
     THE ROAD IS SLEEK!!     
    THE TURNS WERE SHARP!    
     THE DRIVER WOUND UP     
   WITH WINGS AND A HARP!!   
      SHE TOOK THE HILL      
       A WEE BIT FAST!       
    NOW BOTH GIRL AND CAR    
      ARE IN THE PAST!!      
      SCHOOL ZONE NEAR!      
       SLOW WAY DOWN!!       
    WOULD NOT WANT TO RUN    
     THAT POOR KID DOWN!     
     WE MAY NOT KNOW HOW     
      TO SPLIT AN ATOM!      
  BUT OUR FAITHFUL PATRONS?  
    JUST LET US AT THEM!!    
       ON THAT VEHICLE       
       ONE LIGHT I SEE       
    IS THAT A MOTORCYCLE?    
 OR JUST PRETENDING TO BE?!! 
   HE CHECKED THE GAS LINE   
        WITH A MATCH!        
  NOW IT IS NOT JUST A HOLE  
  THAT NEEDS TO BE PATCHED!  
         OUT OF GAS?         
        WHAT A SHAME!        
    BUT THEN ASK YOURSELF    
      WHO'S TO BLAME?!!      
      IT MATTERS LITTLE      
       HOW YOU DRIVE!!       
     THE IMPORTANT THING     
     IS TO ARRIVE ALIVE!     
        PRICES RISING        
     ACROSS THIS NATION!     
    GAS SURE DID NOT BEAT    
   THAT GROWING INFLATION!!  
     TO AVOID GETTING UP     
    IN CARE OF SOME NURSE    
     BETTER PUT THAT CAR     
     IN A QUICK REVERSE!     
   THAT BRAND NEW GAS LINE   
      IS OUT OF KILTER!      
 NO WONDER, WHEN YOU SKIMPED

      TRY AND LOVE YOUR      
       MOTHER-IN-LAW!!
