  ShisenSho is a Chinese mindgame. It will played with the same Stones
  as Mahjong, but with total other rules.

  To make the game interesting, I add some new rules.

    1.) Multiplier-Stones
        -----------------
        The Points would calculate with the Multiplier-Stones.
        With some Stones, this multipier can raise.

    2.) More Points by longer ways.
        ---------------------------
        Ever longer a way between a pair, all so much the points.
        This way is in related with the multipier.

  So you can influence the points, through clever solution.

    3.) Help
        ----
        You can, if you have helps left, blast Stones away.
        So it is much easyier, to solve a Level.
        But it is much profitable, to use no helps.

@node Right

  ShisenSho is FREEWARE

  Copying and distribution is free, as long as all archives
  are complete.

  It is however not permitted to make any changes to the programm
  or the other files.

@endnode


@node Sonstiges

  A few hints:


    AGA (PalHires 256 colors)
    Exchangeable background pics 
    Systemfriendly (with left Amiga + m you change to workbench)

  As ShisenSho runs in system, it is useful not to activate other
  programms in the background i.g. screenblanker.
  If you encouter problems, be sure to keep an eye on that matter.

  This can be, if you use a high Resolution Workbench with many
  Colours, and no Grafikcard.

  ShisenSho takes about 1,6 MB chipram. Take care about that.
  If you really encouter ramproblems, try to start the game, 
  without the startup-sequence.

@endnode

@node score

  Two things abaut Hall of Fame.

    1.) The first 14 places are normaly Entrys.
        Thats mean, the highest Score ist on the top...

        Place 15 is always the Player, hows Score is to low for
        hall of Fame.
        
        Thats mean, If the Score ist high enought, you will sort
        into the list.
        Otherwise you are on place 15, equal how much Points you have.

   2.)  The Score will be save, when ShisenSho leave. 
        When you make a Reset, the Score would not save.

        Also the Level and the Language would saved.
        So you must not always begin with Level one.
        But when you change the Directory of Backgroundpics,
        the Levelnumber is one agin.
       
        Use the End Button, please.

  Systemrequirements
  ------------------

  AGA-Amiga with 2 MB ChipRam, and some FastRam.

  I could not test the game on a naked 1200.
  (I know anybody how have such a compi..)
  Without FastRam, many things would not work, I think...

  The game has been testet on these computers:

    Amiga 1200 Original        68020 (14 MHZ) and  4 MB Fastram
    Amiga 1200 with  MTek      68030 (40 MHZ) and  4 MB Fastram
    Amiga 4000 with Cyberstorm 68040 (40 MHZ) and 16 MB Fastram
    Amiga 4000 with Cyberstorm 68060 (50 MHZ) and 64 MB Fastram
    Amiga 4000 with Apolle     68060 (50 MHZ) and 32 MB Fastram

@node Regeln

  And now the rules
  -----------------

  On the Gamearea are 126 Stones. Always 4 Stones have the same Symbol.
  This Stones you must put away with this rules:

  1.) You can remove 2 Stones with the same Symbol, when they can combound
      with three lines.
      The lines can only be horizontal and vertical.
      There can also be one ore two lines, but no more then 3 lines.

      The programm will search the shortest Way, himself.

  2.) There are 9 Stones only twice. They are a little darker.
      This are the multiplier Stones. If you put away a pair of this Stones,
      the multiplier raise 2.

  3.) You get more Points, if the Way between the Stones is long.

      The best tactic is therefore. First get the multiplier Stones,
      and find so long ways as possible.

  4.) If there is no move left, and you have one more helps, you can remove
      a Stone with this.
      Klick on Help. The Button will be aktive. When you will not remove
      a Stone, klick the Help Button again.
      Otherwise klick a Stone and he will remove. The secont Stone will
      remove by the Programm.
      You can remove only one Stone yourself.

      For each Help you don`t use, you got 50000 Points on Finish.

      Be sure, that realy no move ist left, when you use the Help-Button.

@endnode

@node automat

    Before you start, you must play with a little Slot-machine, to get
    some starting values.

    Here you can win ore loose following things.
    

      ---------------------------------------------- 
      |      Win            |      Symbol          |
      ----------------------------------------------
      |                     |                      |
      |   60000 Points      |   6 Coins            |
      |   Loose Helps       |   Grey Scull         |
      |   Win Help          |   Bomb               |
      |   Win 2 Mul         |   Brown X            |

      ----------------------------------------------

    If the Startbutton beginn to blink, the Slot-machine can be started.
    He will be faster and faster.

    Now you have two possibilitys:

      1.) You do nothing and wait on witch Symbol the machine will stop.

      2.) If the Stop-Button beginn to blink, you can stop the machine.
          Klick on the Stop-button.

    With a little good fortune and a some sence, you get the symbol of
    your choose.

    You have 5 changes. After each Round one Light will go out.

@node Auswahl

   Here you can change the Language from German to English.
   The Flag you klick, become a red border.

   On the Bottom left, there is a Disk. Here you can choose a Directory
   of Backgroundpics.

   You must only look for two things:
   1.) The Pics must have Pal-Hires Resolutions, and they can have no more
       than 128 colours.
   2.) The Pictures must have the name hp, and they must have ordered numbers.
       z.b hp1,hp2,hp3.....

       The Program search allways the next number. If there is no found the
       next number, you play level one again.  


   The Pictures can located anywhere, but I think it is better you copy
   the pictures into the ShisehSho Directory.
   There are alredy three Dirs with Pictures....hp/Set1-3.  

   The Pics must habe Pal-Hires Resolution. In the Drawer ShisenSho/tools
   you find a program to convert Iff-Pictures into the ShisenSho Format.

   Choose a picture. The Picture must named hp. The Converter beginn to
   work from the number, you have selectet. To convert the complete Drawer,
   select hp1.
   It converts so long, as a nuber will be found.


   If you change the Pic-Directory you beginn allways with Level one.
   You should play the complete Set, if you will see all Pictures.


   Sound intensity

   Push F9 and the music will be low. Push F10 for more sound volume.

              you collect 50000 Points.

   4.) Stop : Here you can stop the Game, when no move is left or you
              can`t finish the Level.
