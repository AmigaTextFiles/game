This `piece of art` was designed, rendered, painted and coded
by Oscar `TWYSTOR` Kohler. (what else ... :) 

Requirements:
-------------

This game needs at least an Amiga (pc`s are too slow), 68020,
AGA, 2 MB chip and 4 MB fast. It was timed and tested on an
68060, so i think there are some timing-problems on an 68020.  

Below memory-limits 1.65 MB Chip / 3.85 MB Fast the game will
not start up. In that case, close other programs and/or start 
up with no startup-sequence.
!!! Don`t install any IRQ`s (like musicplayer, screenblanker,
ripper ...) if you launch this game, because the systemkiller
freezes only the processes/tasks, but not the interrupts !!!

Install:
--------

Drag the icon to the directory you want ... ready ! The pro-
gram will search the path itself.

Setup:
------

Using the tooltypes of the monstermind-icon you can choose
some options like language and so on.
You must write the tooltype-entries exactly as the following
examples - with capslockletters and without any spaces !

LANGUAGE=ENGLISH ... print texts in english language
LANGUAGE=GERMAN ...  print texts in german language

INTRO=ON ...  play the game intro  
INTRO=OFF ... skip the intro

BRIEF=ON ...  show level briefings
BRIEF=OFF ... skip the briefings  

What`s this:
------------

This game is a master-mind-clone, and i think, everyone knows
the rules of master-mind  ... if not, there is a short manual
in the game included. ( -> press "HELP" in the main-menu ! )

I started this game 2 years ago, as an ingame-part of another
game ... then i stoped working on this part, because i hadn`t
enough time to complete it :(
After a long time, i redesigned it to a stand-alone game, ad-
ded some new parts, like monster-book, trashy story, ingames,
hall of fame ... and reduced the datafiles from 80 MB to this
more handy net-version.

Keep the tradition: This game is public domain ! - Have fun !

Highlights:
-----------

*) 99% 3D-free
*) 99% Vector-free
*) Highres
*) Old school coding :)
*) Monsterbook, includes all famous monsters - worldwide !
*) Nice ingames (I don`t remember how many :)
*) Gloomy design and gfx
*) Dark sounds and sfx
*) Systemkiller, without killing irq`s (I love it !)
*) No UAE protection

Lowlights:
----------

*) Book and story-texts only in german (no time ...)
*) Poorly ingame-speech
*) Trashy story (... but who cares :)
*) Systemkiller, without killing irq`s (somebody hate it :)
*) Some effects dont look so nice as i want :)
*) Slowly c2p routines
*) Ugly `hall of fame` / `credits` - font
*) ...
