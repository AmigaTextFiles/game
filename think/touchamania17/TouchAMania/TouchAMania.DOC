1.Disclaimer
------------
This  program and its accompanying files (see also:  distribution files) are NOT
public  domain.  We release them under the concept of FREEWARE.
You  are  allowed  and encouraged to copy it as often as you like as long as you
don't  charge  any money for it.  We'd like to explicitly express our permission
to  Fred  Fish  and  the  maintainers of Aminet to include this program on their
CD's.   But  we don't want any other public domain series to include this or any
other  product  of  <DITO  Soft>  in  their libraries.  This includes vendors of
public  domain programs (we consider this a contradiction in itself).  We'd like
to  encourage  everybody  to  make  this package publicly available in every non
profit form you could think of (BBS, AmiNet, Internet in general, ...).
A distribution MUST always include the complete archive (see also:  distribution
files).

3.So, what's this game about?
-----------------------------
TouchAMania  is a nice little game very much like the well known SENSO (at least
in  Germany  it  is known under this name), only better.  :^)
You simply have to remember a sequence of colors (out of 12(!) colors instead of
only  4 in the original SENSO) you are presented with and afterwards press those
color buttons in that order.  Each time you succeed the sequence is replayed and
a new color is added to the sequence.


4.Installation
--------------
Installation  is  simple,  because  TouchAMania  does not require any additional
files.   Simply  drag  its  icon into the desired drawer and you're ready to go.
You can, of course, copy the files 'TouchAMania' and 'TouchAMania.info' with any
other method you like.


6.How to play with this program
-------------------------------
The TouchAMania display consists of 12 colored fields on the  left  and  several
gadgets on the right which will be explained later.
After starting a new game, TouchAMania will flash one of those 12 colored fields
and  play  a sound (all in all 7 sounds are featured).  Your goal is to remember
the color and click on the appropriate fields (their number grows while playing)
with the left mousebutton in the correct order.
If  you  chose the correct order, TouchAMania will continue with the first field
and  one  additional field for every turn.  Otherwise you will hear the sound of
breaking glass as a sign for your failure and the game ends.

The gadgets:
------------

 EASY/FUN/HARD/MADNESS: This cycle-gadget allows you to select the difficulty
                        of the game. Where:
                         EASY means that the fields flash quite a long time and
                              there is as much time between flashing of two fields.
                         FUN is a little bit faster.
                         HARD is quite fast.
                         MADNESS guess what? :-)

 START: Starts a new game.

 LAST: Displays the last series of fields. Works only after finishing a game.
       It would be too easy if you could display the last series any time.

 LONGEST: Displays the longest series so far. Only one list is stored for all
          difficulty levels.

 QUIT: Leaves the game. You didn't expect anything else, did you? :-)

Well, that's it. Not to complicated but possibly quite addictive.


6.Ideas for the future of TouchAMania
-------------------------------------
Well,  nothing  yet.   It's  your turn to come up with something.  But remember:
It's free, so don't EXPECT me to do anything.  If your ideas make sense to me or
there's enough interest, I might come up with a new release.


7.How to contact the author
---------------------------
Well,  the  easiest way (at least for me) is by e-mail and therefore this is the
only way I'd like to offer any support.
So, e-mail me at: ths@uni-paderborn.de

Have fun!
