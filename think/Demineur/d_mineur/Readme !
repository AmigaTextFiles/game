you can choose the difficulty, the music, see the hiscores, etc ...
During the game, you discover a square by pressing the left button, you
put a flag or a ? with the rigth button. To play quickly, the two 
buttons function is usefull : for exemple, you've got a number 3 and 
you have already paste 3 flags around it, then press the two buttons 
on this number to discover the last 5 squares simultaneously.
When you quit, you can choose to save scores or not !

That's all, have a good time !
