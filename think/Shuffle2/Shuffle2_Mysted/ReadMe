1.Introduction
--------------
First sorry for my bad english, I'll try to write this piece of text
correctly.
Shuffle is a simple logical game. Main task for a player is to repair
shuffled picture. You only have to click on two different pieces and
they'll swap their positions. When you fix the picture, CPU will
tell you your score and you can get to the HALL OF FAME. Try to beat 
RAWEN (me)!!! :-)
 

2.Technical parameters
----------------------
Required:  AMIGA :-)))))) with AGA chipset
           about 2.0 MB OF MEMORY (depends on the lenght of music sample)
           AHI
          
This version is very simple and not-so-user-friendly. It's my first
serious program and I worked on it for only one week so it's not finished yet.
    
3.How to use it
---------------
The menu is very simple. It contains 4 chooses:
F1 Start a new game
F2 Change picture (picture, which will be shuffled)
F3 Change music (not a module, but a sample)
   (music samples are that files with "Mu_" in the name)
F4 Quit to AMIGA OS 

INGAME KEYZ:
------------
ESC - Leave the game.
F1  - New music sample.

4.Flexibility
-------------
If you have some nice pictures (640*480 - 256 colours) you can use them.
You can change samples too. They're not limited by size!
Sounds are saved in 8svx format. Music is played on 11100 Hz frequency, 
samples 'click' and 'shuffle' on 8200 Hz and speech on 21000 Hz.

5.BUGS
------
- When you have a problem with a sound, try to change AHI mode of 
  music unit (I have problems with 14bit FAST modes).
- I added small script which replace ahi.prefs in ENV:sys directory,
  music mode selected in this file is Paula:HiFi 14bit stereo++ calibrated.

6.Contacts
----------
Try it on e-mail: rawen@centrum.cz , but I don't check it regularly...

If you think that MysticArts (MTA) is a group, I can apease you,
there's only one member - me :-)
