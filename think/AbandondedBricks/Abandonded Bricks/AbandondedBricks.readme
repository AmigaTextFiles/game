Author:       Milan Babuskov
Uploader:     Ilkka Lehtoranta
Type:         game/think
Version:      1.12
Requires:     util/libs/powersdl.lha
Architecture: ppc-morphos

The goal of the game is to reach the highest possible score. Shapes fall from
the top of the screen. You can move them sideways and rotate them in order to
get the best fit when they reach the bottom. When you manage to complete a
horizontal line, it disappears. When screen is full the game is over.
The game speeds up whenever the lines are full. Therefore, it's better to fill
as many lines you can at once. That way you can reach higher levels with the
same speed.
