                                 **GENERAL HELP**                    //v1.2 //

Click on a Patience game to select it. Double click it to select //and //play
it. Next click on one of the Control buttons:

## Play ##          commences the selected game.
## Demonstration ## the computer plays a sample of the selected game and shows
                    comments upon what is happening. The demonstration may be
                    paused at any time by holding down the Space bar.
## Help ##          (or the Help key) displays this page.
## Rules ##         describes how the selected game is played.
## Quit ##          terminates the programme.

During a game some different Control buttons are displayed:
## Change Game ##   terminates the current game and shows the list of games.
## New Game ##      re-starts the current game optionally replaying it with
                    the same deck of cards, or a newly shuffled deck.
## Prompt ##        the computer suggests a move, but a win is not guaranteed!
## Stop ##          terminates the current game or demonstration.

Each Control button may alternatively be activated by pressing the key bearing
the underlined letter.

To move a card click on it, then click on the position to which you wish it to
be moved. If the card you have clicked can be moved to only one position it
may move automatically to that position before the second click. If you change
your mind about moving a card after you have clicked on it, click in any blank
area. A face-up card overlapped by another may be revealed by positioning the
mouse pointer over it and holding down the //right// mouse button.

If the packet of Stock cards becomes exhausted (and there are cards available
in a discard or Rubbish Heap) click once on the position of the Stock to
transfer the cards from the Rubbish Heap back into the Stock.

If you reach a position where winning is only a formality, the computer will
complete the game automatically where its rules describe it as `auto-finish'.
The computer will make other automatic moves during certain games; in the main
these will be Base Cards which you would need to move anyway. Press the `U'
key to undo or take back a faulty (or undesired computer-generated automatic)
move; this is not available for every situation.
