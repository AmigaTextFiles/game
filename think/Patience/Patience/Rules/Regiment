The aim of this Patience is to build four ascending Sequences following suit
on Ace Foundations, and four descending Sequences following suit on King
Foundations. (Double pack).

1 Deal face upwards two rows of eight cards each, leaving room between them
for a third row. The third row is dealt face upwards as eight packets of
eleven cards. The first two rows are the Depots; the middle row contains the
Stock Packets. The Foundations will be formed below the lower row of Depots.

2 One Ace and one King of each suit are taken, as Exposed in play, as Base
Cards to form Foundations. Cards from the Stock Packets and Depots are built
onto the Ace Foundations in ascending order, or the King Foundations in
descending order, following suit in either case.

3 If it is not possible to build upon Foundations then Depot and Stock cards
may be Packed onto other Depots, one at a time, in ascending or descending
Sequence and following suit. An ascending Sequence on a Depot may be changed
at any time into a descending Sequence - or vice versa.

4 A space occurs when all cards have been played from a particular Depot. This
space must immediately be filled by the top card of the nearest Stock Packet.
If a Stock Packet becomes exhausted its place should be filled by the top card
of an adjacent Stock Packet.
