                              **TOWER OF HANOI**

The aim of this Patience is to arrange the cards into a single column in
descending Sequence from the Ten. (Only nine cards of the same suit from the
Two to the Ten inclusive are used in this Patience).

1 Deal all the cards face upwards in three rows of three cards.

2 The cards are moved only according to the following rules:
  · One at a time;
  · From the foot of any column to the foot of another column, provided that
    the card immediately below which it is placed is higher in value; //or //
  · From the foot of any column to the top of a vacant column.

3 If played correctly, or for long enough, this Patience will work out every
time, and a column of nine cards will build down from the Ten to the Two.
