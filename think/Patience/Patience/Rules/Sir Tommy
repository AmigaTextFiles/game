                                **SIR TOMMY**

The aim of this Patience is to form four ascending Sequences from the Aces,
regardless of suit. (Single pack).

This may be called the original Patience, from which all others are derived.

1 Deal out the pack in four heaps, using the Aces as they turn up as Base
Cards for the Foundations, and building on them whenever possible from the
Stock or Depots without regard to suit.

2 There is no Rubbish Heap, no second deal, and no transference from one Depot
to another. As far as possible keep one heap for cards of high value and hope
that the Kings come out quickly.
