                             **FORTUNE'S FAVOUR**

The aim of this Patience is to form four ascending Sequences from the Aces,
following suit, upon the Foundations. (Single pack; auto-finish).

1 Deal out eight cards face up in two rows of six cards; these cards comprise
the Depots, and the Foundations will be formed above them.

2 Any exposed Ace - any Ace that becomes exposed during play - is a Base Card
and must be moved to one of the Foundations immediately. Similarly, any card
which can be built onto a Foundation in ascending sequence following suit
should be moved there from a Depot or Rubbish pile as soon as it becomes
Exposed.

3 When no more moves to a Foundation are possible, cards may be moved singly
from one Depot to another, or from the Rubbish pile to a Depot, provided that
the receiving Depot is either empty or its uppermost card is the same suit and
one higher in rank than the moved card.

4 When no more moves are available under step 3, deal the top card from the
Stock pile to the Rubbish Heap and repeat steps 2 and 3.

5 If the Stock becomes exhausted, and no further moves are possible, the game
is lost. No further deals are allowed.
