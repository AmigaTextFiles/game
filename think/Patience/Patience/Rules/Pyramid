                                 **PYRAMID**

The aim is to remove the Stock and display by twos, each combination counting
thirteen. (Single pack).

1 Lay out twenty-eight cards face up in the shape of a pyramid. Ie, one card
comprises the top row, two cards comprise the second row, with both cards
overlapping the bottom half of the first card, but not each other. Three cards
comprise the third row which similarly overlap the cards in the second row.
Continue laying overlapping rows of cards down to seven cards in row seven.
The remaining cards form the Stock Pile and are placed face up to one side.

2 Search the Exposed - non-overlapped - cards (initially only those in row
seven and the Stock Pile) for pairs of cards which add up to thirteen,
reckoning Queens as 12 and Jacks as 11. Any two that do total thirteen are
removed from the board. Kings make thirteen on their own and may be removed
when Exposed.

3 When no more pairs can be found, deal the top card from the Stock and place
it on one of the Discard piles. Repeat stage 2, but this time any Exposed
card on a Discard pile may be used as one of a pair totalling thirteen.

4 If the Stock Pile becomes exhausted, the two Discard piles may be shuffled
together and used again //once only //as the Stock Pile. If you have failed to
remove all the cards before the Stock Pile becomes exhausted a second time,
the game is lost.
