                             **SENIOR WRANGLER**

The aim of this Patience is to form eight ascending Sequences, at intervals of
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 respectively, not regarding suit. (Double pack).

1 Lay face up a row of eight cards of any suit from 2 to 9 inclusive; these
Index cards are never moved. Count out eight Packets of twelve cards, placing
a packet face up below each Index card. These are called the Board-Packets.

2 Find a card on a Board-Packet which is twice the value of an Index card. For
example, take a Four from its Board-Packet and lay it below the `Two' Index
card. When looking for a card which is twice the value of an Eight, or higher,
bring the imaginary `thirteen' rule into play: so the card which represents
twice Eight is a Three. (2 times 8 = 16 minus 13 = 3). These are the first
Foundation cards.

3 Since the first Foundation cards won't all come at once, build upon whatever
Foundations have already started. The Index card above each Board-Packet shows
the constant difference by which the Sequence in the Foundation below must be
built up. Eg, the first column's Sequence builds from the Four by twos (6,8,
10,Queen,Ace,3,5,7,9,Jack,King); the next column builds from the Six by threes
(6,9,Queen,2,5 etc).

4 Single cards may be moved from one Foundation to another, provided that the
correct Sequence is maintained in the `receiving' Foundation. Kings, however,
may not be moved in this way, since the addition of a King completes a
Foundation.

5 When no cards can be moved deal the first Board-Packet out onto the others,
beginning with the space from which it was taken. Upon further stoppages
similarly deal out the remaining Board-Packets. (Click twice on the Board-
Packet to do this). If the Patience succeeds, each Foundation will contain
twelve cards topped with a King and the Board-Packets will be empty.
