The aim is to discard the Stock by twos, leaving just the eight Aces upon the
Foundations. (Double pack).

1 Deal out the pack face up into a row of ten Packets. Below this will form
nine Depots, and below them will be the eight Foundations.

2 Discard pairs of Exposed cards which share the same value (except Aces) for
as long as possible. When blocked take any card (preferably high value) and
move it to any Depot. If building upon cards already in a Depot the card moved
must be of lower value than the Exposed card on the Depot. Repeat this step as
often as necessary to clear away the original Packets.

3 Only when the original Packets have been cleared away may building upon the
Foundations begin. If all has gone well eight of the Depots should be topped
with an Ace, and these can now be moved into their final positions in the
Foundations.

4 Resume discarding pairs of Exposed cards which share the same value (except
Aces) until only the Aces remain. If blocked at this stage cards may be
temporarily built upon the Aces, provided always that a card so moved is
higher in value than the Exposed card it covers on the Foundation.

5 No card may be transferred between the original ten Packets, nor from one
Depot to another, nor from one Foundation to another. Apart from discarding,
only one card is moved at a time. Building to Depots and temporary building to
Foundations is performed without regard to suit.
