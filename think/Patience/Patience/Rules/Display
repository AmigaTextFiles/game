                                 **DISPLAY**

The aim of this Patience is to form a row of thirteen cards in descending
sequence regardless of suit; and under each card of this sequence to form a
column of eight cards in ascending sequence regardless of suit. (Double pack).

1 Turn the pack face up and place the top card in the top left hand corner of
the board. This will be the leftmost card in the top row of the Display.

2 If the new top card of the Stock Pile is one lower than the rightmost card
of the top row, pack it to the immediate right of that card; if it is one
higher than the last card in any column, pack it below that card. Otherwise
move it to one of three Rubbish Heaps. The Exposed card of any Rubbish Heap
may be similarly packed to the Display. Continue packing cards one by one from
the Stock Pile and Rubbish Heaps to the Display according to these rules:
   A King follows an Ace when packing to a row;
   An Ace follows a King when packing to a column;
   Cards may be packed to rows and columns only when the card immediately
    before it in sequence is present;
   Each row may hold no more than 13 cards, each column no more than 8;
   Cards may not be moved once they have been added to the Display.

3 When the Stock Pile becomes exhausted the Rubbish Heaps may be used once
more, //but only one Rubbish Heap is then available.//

4 Success will result in all 104 cards being laid out in the Display.

5 Tips:
   Don't put many cards of the same denomination on one Rubbish Heap.
   Form the top row as quickly as you can.
   Pack to the columns as equally as you can.
