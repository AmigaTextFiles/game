The aim of this Patience is to form four ascending Sequences from the Aces,
following suit, upon the Foundations. (Single pack; auto-finish).

1 Deal seven cards, one at a time, from left to right; the first is laid face
up and the rest are laid face down. Ignoring the upturned card deal six more
cards, one at a time, from left to right, onto the first row; again the first
card dealt is face up, the rest are face down. Continue in this way until the
28th card is laid face up on the rightmost column. The cards now dealt form
seven vertical Depots.

2 Any Exposed Ace (and any Ace Exposed during play) is a Base Card and should
be moved to a Foundation. Any other Exposed card may be moved from a Depot or
the Rubbish Heap and placed on an Exposed card in another Depot in descending
Sequence of alternating colour. A Sequence of cards may be played bodily at
any time from one Depot to another, provided that the proper Sequence and
alternation of colour are preserved.

3 A vacancy can occur if a Depot has had all its cards removed; this can be
filled only by moving a King (or Sequence headed by a King) into it.

4 Repeat steps 2 and 3 as long as possible, turning face-up any card that
becomes uncovered. When no more cards can be moved deal one card off the Stock
Pile and place it face up on the Rubbish Heap. Repeat steps 2 and 3.

5 When the Stock becomes exhausted, turn over the Rubbish Heap and replace it
as the Stock. If the Stock has been replenished in this way without any card
having been played onto a Depot, cards should be played onto the Foundations
from Depots or the Rubbish Heap in ascending Sequence and following suit. When
no more moves can be made the game has failed.
