                                    **S**

The aim is to form thirteen ascending Sequences, each of eight cards
regardless of suit, upon thirteen Foundations, themselves a complete Sequence.
(Double pack).

1 Lay out a full Sequence without regard to suit in the shape of the letter S,
beginning with the 7 at the bottom tip and ending with a 6.

2 Build on these in ascending sequence, regardless of suit, so that if you
succeed you will have thirteen Packets of eight cards each, crowned by an Ace,
a Two, a 3 and so on to a King (which will appear at the upper tip of the S
shape). For the purpose of this patience the Ace counts both high and low, ie
it is built onto a King and is itself built onto by a Two.

3 Deal the cards from Stock, putting those that will not fit on two Rubbish
Heaps. There must be no shifting from one Packet to another, and care must be
taken not to overbuild, ie do not put more than eight cards on one Packet.
There is no second deal, so you should not block cards likely to be required
soon.
