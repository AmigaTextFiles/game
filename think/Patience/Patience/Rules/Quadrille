                                **QUADRILLE**

The aim of this Patience is to form eight ascending Sequences from the Aces
and Twos following suit, upon the Foundations. (Single pack).

1 Deal the pack onto a Rubbish Heap, placing as they turn up the Aces and
Twos side by side according to suit. These are the Foundations and they are
built upon following suit but in alternate numbers. Ie, the odd numbered cards
are built onto the Ace Foundations, and the even numbered cards are built onto
the Two Foundations. Success will leave each King with his Queen to the right.

2 The Rubbish Heap may be re-used twice.
