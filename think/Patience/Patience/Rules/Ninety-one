                                **NINETY-ONE**

The aim is to get the top cards of thirteen Packets to total ninety-one.
(Single pack).

1 Lay out the pack in thirteen Packets of four cards each, face upwards. Add
up the value of the top cards according to pips. For this purpose Ace counts
one, Jack as 11, Queen as 12 and King as 13.

2 Move the top cards, one at a time, from Packet to packet until the aim is
achieved and with every Packet still containing at least one card. The more
difficult of the two versions available requires each Packet to contain four
cards at the finish.

3 The Sequence Ace to King totals ninety one, but there are many more possible
combinations.
