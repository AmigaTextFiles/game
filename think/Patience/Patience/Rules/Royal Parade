                               **ROYAL PARADE**

The aim of this Patience is to produce a display or `Parade' of all twenty-
four Court cards; ie a row of eight Jacks, a row of eight Queens, and a row of
eight Kings. (Double pack, but with all Aces removed).

1 Deal face upwards three rows of eight cards each. These mark the positions
that the `Parade' cards should eventually occupy.

2 Examine the three rows to ascertain whether there are any Twos in the top
row, or Threes in the middle row, or Fours in the bottom row. If so, these
will be the only cards that can be used at present. They must be built upon
only as follows:

On a 2 put a 5, then an 8, and finally a Jack - all of the same suit.
On a 3 put a 6, then a 9, and finally a Queen - all of the same suit.
On a 4 put a 7, then a 10, and finally a King - all of the same suit.

3 If a space occurs in the top row it may be filled only by moving an Exposed
Two into it. Similarly if a space occurs in the middle row it may be filled
only by an Exposed Three, and in the bottom row only by an Exposed Four.

4 When all possible moves using the original twenty-four cards have been made,
eight cards are dealt out in a fourth row face up. These are the Depot cards.
Any Exposed Two, Three, or Four card on a Depot may be moved into a space in
the appropriate `Parade' row as described in rule 3. `Parade' and Depot cards
may continue to be used to build on other `Parade' cards, for as long as
possible.

5 When all possible moves have been made, deal another row of eight cards onto
the Depots and proceed as before. There is no second deal using cards in the
fourth row.
