                              **CHRISTMAS TREE**

The aim of this Patience is to form four ascending Sequences from the Aces,
following suit, upon the Foundations. (Single pack; auto-finish).

1 Lay out face down seventeen cards in five rows in the following manner: one
in the first row, three in the second row, five in the third row, seven in the
fourth row, and one in the fifth row. These Depots form the shape of a simple
Christmas Tree.

2 Deal the remaining pack onto a Rubbish Heap, placing the Aces to one side as
they turn up. These begin the Foundations and they are built upon following
suit as and when the appropriate cards turn up. As soon as a card is built
from the Rubbish Heap to a Foundation, any one of the cards on the Christmas
Tree may be turned face up and thereafter used for building onto Foundations
at the correct moment. Any card moved from the Christmas Tree to a Foundation
is immediately replaced by the top card from the Rubbish Heap (or Stock Pile
if exhausted); in either case the replacement card is laid face up upon the
Christmas Tree in the position which was occupied by the card it replaces.

3 The Rubbish Heap may be turned and dealt twice more.

4 If both the Stock Pile and the Rubbish Heap become exhausted, all the cards
upon the tree which remain face down are turned face up. If this happens the
game will be won.
