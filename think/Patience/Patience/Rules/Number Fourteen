                             **NUMBER FOURTEEN**

The aim is to discard the Stock by twos, each combination counting fourteen.
(Double pack).

1 Lay out twenty-five cards in five rows, face up.

2 Search the lay-out for couples of cards either in the same row or in the
same column which add up to fourteen, reckoning Kings as 13, Queens as 12 and
Jacks as 11. Any two that do total fourteen are removed to the Rubbish Heap.

3 When no more pairs can be found fill up the vacancies from the Stock and
repeat stage 2. If no pair can be found, two of the cards may switch places.
(Try to create two pairs of fourteen in this way).

4 Keep removing pairs of fourteen until every card has been removed.
