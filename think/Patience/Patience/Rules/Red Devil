The aim of this patience is to manoeuvre the four Aces to the top of the
Depots. (Single pack).

1 Deal out four cards in a row face up. These are the Base Cards of the four
Depots that will be formed. They occupy the positions into which the Aces must
be manoeuvred. In all subsequent deals four cards will be laid face up, one on
each Depot.

2 If there are two Exposed cards of the same suit then remove the one with the
lower value to the Rubbish Heap. Aces count high for this purpose. Repeat this
until all remaining Exposed cards belong to a different suit.

3 Deal four more cards face up from the Stock Pile, left to right, one to each
Depot. If an Ace is dealt onto a non-vacant Depot it may be moved immediately
from that Depot to any Depot which is then still vacant, if any. The next card
dealt takes its place on the first Depot so that four cards are still dealt
out, one to each Depot.

4 Repeat stage 2. If one of the Depots becomes vacant and an Ace becomes
exposed on any of the other Depots, the Ace may be moved into the vacant Depot
and stage 2 repeated, if possible, followed by stage 3.

5 Continue until either the Aces are in their target positions, when the game
is won, or the Stock becomes exhausted (with the Aces not in their target
positions) when the game is lost. The Rubbish Heap is not re-used.
