                               **FOUR SEASONS**

The aim of this Patience is to form four ascending Sequences, following suit,
upon the Foundations. (Single pack).

1 Deal out a row of three cards face up, then place two more cards face up
above and below the middle card of the first three to form a little cross.
These are the Depot cards. The Foundations will be built one to each side of
the single top card, and one to each side of the lowest card.

2 To start, place a card face up to the left of the top card; this is the Base
Card for its particular Foundation, and it determines the value of the Base
Cards upon which the other three Foundations will be built. Eg, if this first
Foundation card is a Four of Hearts, then the other Foundations will start
with Fours. Place the remaining pack face down to form the Stock.

3 Turn over the top Stock card. If possible, move cards from the Rubbish Heap
and Depots to the Foundations, commencing new Foundations with the designated
Base Cards as early as possible, or building upon existing ones in ascending
sequence and following suit. Once the King has been reached in a particular
Foundation the next card to be laid upon it will be an Ace of the same suit.

4 Next pack (as far as possible) any single card from the Rubbish Heap or a
Depot to another Depot in descending sequence regardless of suit. This creates
vacant Depots to receive cards from the Rubbish Heap. Repeat steps 3 and 4.

5 Once the Stock becomes exhausted the Rubbish pile may be turned over to form
the Stock once more. When no more cards can be moved, and the Rubbish Heap has
already been re-used, the game is lost.
