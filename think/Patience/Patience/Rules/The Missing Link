                             **THE MISSING LINK**

The aim of this Patience is to form four ascending Sequences from the Aces,
following suit, upon the Foundations. (Single pack).

1 Shuffle and cut the pack, then take one card from the middle and put it
aside face down without looking at it; this is the `Missing Link'. Lay out
another seven cards in a row face upward, and if an Ace occurs among them,
take it out and place it above the row, filling its vacancy from the pack.
Treat the other Aces similarly when they turn up.

2 Deal out the rest of the pack on the seven Depots in any way you like,
building, as opportunity occurs, on the Ace Foundations in ascending Sequence
and following suit. So far as possible, avoid packing high value cards onto
low value ones.

3 When all the pack has been dealt out turn up the `Missing Link', and if by
its aid you can complete the Ace Packets you have succeeded. There is no
second deal.
