The aim of this Patience is to form four ascending Sequences from the Aces,
following suit, upon the Foundations. (Single pack; auto-finish).

1 Deal out the entire pack face up in eight columns. The first four columns
will contain seven cards; the last four will contain six cards. These are the
Depots.

2 Any Exposed Ace (and any exposed during play) is a Base Card and should be
moved to a Foundation immediately. Any other Exposed card may be moved from a
Depot or the Temporary Holding area and placed on an Exposed card in another
Depot in descending sequence of alternating colour. If such a move is not
possible (or even if it is) any Exposed card from any Depot may be moved to
the Temporary Holding area, provided that no more than four cards are held
there at any time. A Sequence of cards may be moved between Depots provided
that moving them individually would be permissible under these rules.

3 A vacancy can occur if a Depot has had all its cards removed; this can be
filled by any Exposed card from a Depot, or from the Temporary Holding area.
The best card for this purpose is normally a King, or the highest available
alternative.

4 Repeat steps 2 and 3 as long as possible, taking every opportunity to build
upon the Foundations when a suitable card becomes Exposed.

5 When no more moves can be made between Depots, or from the Temporary Holding
area to a Depot (and there are no vacancies in the Temporary Holding area) the
game has failed.
