    Installation ?!?   What ?
   
    Copy the AGA Puzzle directory where you will. It's all :)

@NODE "Config" "Requirements"

    AGA Puzzle should work in all AGA Amiga.

    It uses much CHIP RAM (particularly if you're selecting a big picture with 
    many colours and a little numbre of pieces).  FAST RAM isn't usless (but,
    even in a simple A1200, if your workbench isn't too gourmand, AGA Puzzle
    should work). After the selection of the puzzle, AGA Puzzle verifies if
    your RAM is sufficient for this puzzle.

    Comment : if the picture is in low resolution (and/or have a little
    numbre of colours), AGA Puzzle takes much less CHIP RAM. See : @{"Options" LINK "Options"}.

    AGA Puzzle is my second program. You can also try my first game: VDT.
    On Aminet: game/2play
    AGA Puzzle is entirely writed in @{"Blitz Basic" LINK "Blitz"}. 

    Comments or counsel for AGA Puzzle are welcome. 

    As for me, I advise everybody to use the wonderful program @{"MCP" LINK "MCP"}.

    This is the end of my first guide. Enjoy yourselves !

@NODE "Mode d'emploi" "Some instructions"

    * To begin a game : first click on Load a picture. You can select a 
      IFF picture (no HAM). Just verif that the size of the picture
      isn't much too large for your screen.

    * After, you can adjust many @{"options" LINK "Options"}.

    * Click on Play.

    * Click on Begin.

    * During the game : press :
      - on 'space' to change screen,
      - on 'n' to turn the piece (if Turn on is selected),
      - on 'q' to return on Workbench (the game isn't lost).

    * If you have press on 'q' :
      - click on Continue to continue.
      - click on Save to save the game. AGA Puzzle makes a save file (ex. : 
        puzzle1) and a IFF file : puzzle1.IFF.
      - click on stop to stop the game. This puzzle is lost.

    * Lastly, to load a saved game, click on Load a game in the first window.

@NODE "Remarques" "Some comments"

    * You use AGA Puzzle at your own risk.

    * If you ever find a bug, please report them by sending @{"me" LINK "Auteur"} the
      following in as much detail as possible.
 
    * AGA Puzzle opens 2 screens for the puzzle. Also, you can lower these
      screens or turn back these screens.
      However I advisable to use 'q', because this gives more control.

    * There is no option to view the initial picture. You can (if your CHIP 
      RAM is enough) use your favorite viewer.

    * The number of 'Right piece' is an indication. AGA Puzzle verify if the
      puzzle is strictly reconstituted. In some case, you can't see the fault.
 
@ENDNODE


@NODE "Options" "Options"

    * High res.|Low res. allow you to open high or low resolution screens.
      It's useful to open a low resolution screen with a low resolution
      picture.

    * Reverse on|Reverse off. If you use Reverse on, AGA Puzzle can reverse
      pieces.

    * You can change the number of lines and the number of columns.
      The maximal number of pieces is 10000.
      For children, you can choose a low number of pieces. In this case, I 
      allow you to use a low resolution screen.

@NODE "Blitz" "Blitz Basic"

    For me, the Blitz Basic is an interesting programming language. It has 
    some lack, because it's a 'basic'. His big quality is the easy access to
    particularities of the Amiga.
