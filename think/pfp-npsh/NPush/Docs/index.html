<h1>nPush</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p style="width: 670px">nPush is a logic game similar to Sokoban and Boulder
Dash. You need to collect all the gold
on the level and reach the exit. To make it hard there are some rocks that
stand in your way, and you also have some dynamite to blast them away. Main
difference from Sokoban, KSokoban and similar games is that you can have
multiple player-controlled characters you can move on the screen.</p>

<p style="width: 670px">nPush is written in C++. The source code is freely
available under GPL license, version 2 or above. The code is very simple, so
if you're interested in working on your C++ skills on a simple project, please
feel free to join in.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p style="width: 670px">nPush is a terminal based application and uses nCurses
library for user
interface. Game internals are rather simple and written in such way that
implementing some nicer graphic UI (like using SDL for example) should not be
hard to do.</p>
