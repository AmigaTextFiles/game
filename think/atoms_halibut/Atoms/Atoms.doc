1. Biased opinion
-----------------

        Congratulations ! You now have in your possession one of THE best
Amiga PD games ever. At least, thats what we think.


2. Warning
----------

        There will be a lot of slagging of ST's in this document. Because
they are crap. And dead. Dead and crap. See that dead and crap thing ?
Thats an ST, that is.


3. What is Atoms anyway ?
-------------------------

        Atoms is a game for you Amiga. No doubt about that. Its one of
those "social games" that get better as more players join in. Its also one
of those games where you get to stomp on your best friends in the name of
friendly competetion. Sounds good eh?
                                           

4. History of Atoms
-------------------

        Atoms is an Amiga-ised version of an ST (@£&^$^!) PD game that we
found to be totally addictive, but lacking something in the presentation
department. Probably to something to do with the "hardware" it had to run
on...

        ST-Atoms was itself a version of a *very* old game called
"Critical Mass" that was around as a type-in listing for various 8-bits at
one time or other. I think there was even a Vic-20 version !

        We discovered ST-Atoms lurking on an unlabelled 3.5" floppy one night
while killing time playing with an ST (sorry, but we were ***bored***).
Imagine our surprise when we found an ST something that was actually halfway
decent ! Many a happy hour was passed playing this "Atoms" thing to death,
gleefully wiping each other out with a well placed left button click.

        But then a slight problem arose. The bloke (Mark) that owned the
ST was doing a degree and had to go away for a year. Working for BR he
claims... No-one else had an ST (at least, no-one we would speak to. I
mean - would *you* speak to an ST owner ?) so no-one could play Atoms.

        Bummer or what ?

        Then someone had a great idea - there were a fair few Amigas
about, so why not convert Atoms to this much superior platform ? Inspired
suggestion ! Keep the original addictive gameplay but add the nice graphics,
sampled sound and loads of options that the ST version lacked.

        And so it was that Halibut Software was born, with the sole
intention of recreating Atoms on the Amiga. I (Girv) was drafted in for
the complicated bits that no-one else could do, Dave and Judith drew the
new graphics and Cath/Gav assisted (ahem) in the best way they could. Gav
stayed out of the way, and Cath came up with the right RGB values for a
nice purple colour. Mark cleared off and worked for BR.

        The fruits of our labours are in your possession right now!


5. All very nice, but what do I do ?
------------------------------------

        First thing is to grab up to 5 friends to help you play. Atoms is
crap when played by yourself, mainly because there is no 1-player option!
What do you mean "I dont have that many friends"... ?

        Playing the game is easy. Winning is the difficult part. You win
by wiping out all the other players' atoms before they do it to you.

        Players take turns to place an atom of their colour on the playing
grid. Move the cursor using the mouse and place an atom by clicking the
left mouse button. You may only place an atom in an empty grid square or in
a square that already contains atoms of your colour.

        When too many atoms get together in a single square the fun
begins! When this happens the square will overload and the atoms contained 
therein will be blown outwards to the surrounding squares, possibly
overloading them and causing them to explode also! So you see, huge chain
reactions can be set up that go on for ages !

        When atoms a blasted into surrounding squares, any atoms in these
squares will change to the colour of the current player. This is how you
destroy other players - you cause explosions that fling your atoms into
their squares so converting their atoms into more of yours. A player with
no atoms is a dead player. Remember this.

        Corner squares explode when more than 1 atom is placed in them,
edge squares can hold 2 atoms before exploding and all other squares can
hold 3.

        Play continues until only one player is left. Said player is then
declared, surprise surprise (the unexpected hits you between the eyes),
the winner of that game.


6. Hmm. Anything else I should know ?
-------------------------------------

        There are loads of play options. Well, a few anyway...

        You can choose between an empty initial grid and a quickstart
option that gives players a random number of randomly placed atoms at the
start of each game. This was included because I thought it took too long
for a game to "get going" if the grid was empty.

        Indestructable squares: these appear as filled in squares. You may
not place atoms on them and any atoms that get blasted into them will be
lost. I dont like these very much - they cut down on chain reactions!

        Sound on/off is pretty self explanatory I think...

        There are also several game types: single, continual, fixed length
and "first to...":

        "Single" means just a single game. No shock there. "Continual" means
as many single games as you like (or can stomach), with a record kept of how
many games each player has won. "Fixed Length" is just like continual, except
that only a certain number of games is played. Final scores (number of games
won) are displayed after all games have been played. "First to..." is a 
series of single games that finishes when one player wins a certain number of
games.

        All these options (and more!) are controlled with standard Amiga
pull down menus. Read up on your Workbench manuals if you dont know what
these are or how to use them (!!!!). Clue: use the right mouse button...


7. Great! How do I start Atoms ?
--------------------------------

        Dead easy. This disk *should* autoboot and display a menu with an
option of loading Atoms. Failing that, double click on the Atoms icon from
workbench or type "Atoms" at a CLI/Shell prompt. Think you can handle that ?

        Atoms should work on just about ANY Amiga. It doesnt need huge
amounts of RAM, terabyte floptical drives, 88090 processors, 68887 maths
copros, Kickstart 8.24 etc. etc.

        What it *does* need is the file "AtomsData" to be in the same
directory as the main program. If the program cannot find this file it
will display a file requester and ask *you* to find it. This should not
happen. Ever. If it does, contact us at the address later on in this
document and we'll try to sort you out. No problem :)


8. Legal crap
-------------

        Not too much of this, you'll be pleased to hear !

        Atoms is public domain, but its program code, data and this
document are (c) copyright 1992 Halibut Software and may not be changed in
any way without our express permission. "Packing" or "archiving" Atoms
does not count as altering the files.

        Atoms may not be distributed commercially by itself or as part of
a larger package. Non-commercial distribution is most welcome, but we must
insist that the following rules are observed by any distributor:


        Rule 1
        ------
        The files "Atoms", "AtomsData" and "Atoms.doc" must be included
        unaltered with any distribution.

        Rule 2
        ------
        No money is paid for the distribution, except for "reasonable
        copying charges". We leave it to your conscience to decide whether
        to charge anything at all. Keep PD free sez me...

        Rule 3
        ------
        There is *NO* rule 3


        Apart from that, Atoms may be freely spread about the cosmos.
Bring a little happiness to everyone, whydontcha ?

EDIT 2017: All the legal is obsolete and is still here only for historical
preservation.
Atoms is now released under the MIT License 2017, see LICENSE.txt.

9. Notes for distributors
-------------------------

	You may distribute Atoms in any way you see fit, so long as the 
rules outlined in (8) are followed. This includes distribution on 
compilation disks, BBSs, FTP sites and so on. Anything really.

	A few snippets of info that may come in useful...

	Atoms should be started by executing the "Atoms" file from WB or
CLI/Shell. The file "AtomsData" is read by the program and should be in the
current directory when "Atoms" is executed. If the file is not found in the
current directory the logical ATOMS: and a subdirectory "atoms/" will be
searched for and, if found, the program will look there for "AtomsData".

	I suggest you distribute Atoms on a disk called "ATOMS". If you are
placing the game in a compilation, you should create a subdirectory off the
root directory called "Atoms", and place the files "Atoms" and "AtomsData"
in it.

	If you have any queries or problems please contact us at the address
given at the end of this document and we'll try to sort you out.

        And REMEMBER YOUR SSAE!!!!!!!!! Quite important, that part.

        I would be *especially* interested in anyone claiming to have come up
with a strategy for winning games of Atoms (could be useful for Atoms+...)


11. Credits, greetings and other stuff.
---------------------------------------
        
        Atoms was developed entirely on A500s using GFA-BASIC 3.51 (with
compiler) and DPaint III. Time between inital meeting and first playable
demo was about 2 days, thanx to a late night/early morning session by me
(Girv).

        Credits as follows:

        All code and docs, plus some
        graphic fiddling to convert
        between ideal and practical

        Nice, luvly, wonderful and
        generally good graphics         :       Judith Irwin

        Ideas, DPaint 3 (use of),
        another A500, all the graphics
        not done by Judith and 
        persuading me to buy an A500
        and not an STE                  :       David "Dave" Ewing

        RGB values for a nice purple    :       Catherine "C4D" Thompson

        I would also like to extend my personal thanx to the following
entities, without whom Atoms would not have been possible (or at least a lot
less fun/more difficult). So thanx-a-bundle to...

                                                so ST-Atoms would inspire
                                                us to make something great

        The Coca-Cola company           :       for caffiene laden drinks
