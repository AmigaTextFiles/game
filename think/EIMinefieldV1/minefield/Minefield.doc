Playing the Game
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
The  object  of  the  game  is simple, to discover all the hidden
mines  in  the  shortest  time possible. You are presented with a
minefield  with a known number of mines shown in the upperleft of
the  window.  The  timer  in the upper-right of the window starts
with your first action.

The game can be re-started any time by pressing the face.

To  reveal  a square, click the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON over any of the
unrevealed  squares.  This  will  lead  to  one of three possible
cases:
    
    1)  The  square  is  blank  and the computer performs a flood
        fill of all the surround blanks.

 or 2)  A  number in the range of 1 to 8 appears. This means that
        there  is  that  number  of  mines  to  be  found  in the
        surrounding eight squares.

 or 3)  A small cross appears and the screen flashes. The game is
        over.

By logical deduction (and sometimes with a bit of luck) mines can
be  located.  Refer to the next section and Minefield.pic. Once a
mine  has been found it can be marked by clicking the RIGHT MOUSE
BUTTON over the square ('X'). This will reduce the mines still to
be  found  by one. Clicking the left mouse button over any marked
square will have no effect.

If  you  have  any  doubts  over a square, a marked square can be
converted  to  a  question mark by again clicking the RIGHT MOUSE
BUTTON  over  the  square  ('?'). The number of mines still to be
found will remain the same, but the game can not be finished.

It  is  possible to mark too many mines. In this case, the number
of mines to be found will show a negative number. A square can be
cleared  from  a  marked  square  or  question mark by once again
clicking the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON over a marked square.

Once  all the mines have been found and correctly marked then the
game  has  been  successfully  completed.  Notice the face in the
upper-middle of the window now wears shades! If you are using the
preset  'Beginner',  'Intermediate'  or  'Expert'  games and have
completed  the game in record time, you will be prompted to enter
your name to be saved in the hi-score table.

A Quick Guide to Understanding the Rules
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
At  this  point  it  would  be useful to simultaneously read this
document  and  view  the supplied 'Minefield.pic' using WDisplay,
PPShow or DPaint etc.

Refer to:
Fig.  1  shows  the very simplest case of discovering a mine. All
the  squares marked with '1' denotes that there is one mine to be
found  in  the  adjacent  squares.  Therefore, the mine is in the
middle  and  can  be  marked (not on the picture) by clicking the
RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON over it.

Fig.  2  shows a very common situation. The marked mine was found
by looking at the square one to the right of it and down one. The
square directly beneath the marked square shows that there is '1'
mine  in  the  adjacent  squares.  But  considering that you have
already  found that mine, the square left of the marked square is
not  a mine and can be cleared by clicking LEFT MOUSE BUTTON over
that square. The revealed square will reveal at least '2' because
the  bottom  left  unrevealed  square  is a mine. But do not take
anybodys  word for it... A further definite mine is the top right
square.

Fig.  3  shows an 'island' of unrevealed squares. One can quickly
see  that  all  the  corner squares are mines. How many mines are
left?  There  are  several  approaches to determine the remaining
mine(s).  Probably  the  simplest  method  is  to start above the
pre-marked  top  left  square.  Here  there  are '2' mines in the
adjacent  squares.  Therefore,  the square next to top pre-marked
mine  has  to  be  a mine and can be marked. Now referring to the
square  below showing '3', all of these mines have been found and
thus  the  remaining adjacent unrevealed squares can be revealed.
If you continue to reveal the remaining unrevealed squares you'll
soon  come  to  the conclusion that there was only one additional
mine to be found excluding the corner squares.

Fig.  4  shows  no  corners, but the 3 mines can be easily found.
Watch out for this situation, it can be a life saver!

Menu and Game Options
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
NOTE:   The  hi-score  table only records the three fastest times
~~~~    from  the  'Beginner',  'Intermediate'  and 'Expert' game
        levels.

NOTE:   The  keyboard  short-cuts  can  only be accessed DURING a
~~~~    game  if  the  mouse is above the menu bar. At the END OF
        THE GAME, these short-cuts can be accessed normally.

Beginner        - 10 by 10 minefield with 10 mines (10%).
                  Hi-score option.

Intermediate    - 15 by 15 minefield with 35 mines (15%).
                  Hi-score option.

Expert          - 22 by 18 minefield with 80 mines (20%).
                  Hi-score option.

Suicidal        - Automatically   scales  the  minefield  to  the
                  largest  minefield that can be displayed on the
                  current   screen   mode  with  20%  mines.  For
                  Superhi-res-laced   screen   mode   this  takes
                  approximately 10 seconds to lay 500 mines.

WARNING: Be  careful  of this option! Although the program checks
~~~~~~~  for   memory   allocation  errors,  the  programmer  and
         Engineering  Ideas  can  not be held responsible for any
         reason. See Disclaimer.

Custom...       - Allow  a  custom minefield to be specified. The
                  program  has  a  limit of 100 rows but can have
                  unlimited columns (but not recommended!)

                  A  novel  feature  is  the  optional  countdown
                  timer.  Once enabled, the object is to find all
                  the  mines in the allocated time otherwise they
                  will self destruct!!!!!

Prefs...        - The  size  of  the  minefield  squares  can  be
                  altered    to    accommodate   various   screen
                  resolutions   including  Hi-res,  Hi-res-laced,
                  Super-hi-res and Super-hi-res-laced. Therefore,
                  no more squinting!!!!! I thank you.
                  :-)     :->     :-)     :->     :-)     :->

                  The   'save   enable'   option   once  selected
                  automatically  saves  the  hi-score  table  and
                  preferences   on   entering  a  name  into  the
                  hi-score  table.  The  program creates the file
                  's:minefield.prefs'.  This  option  informs the
                  user  which program is currently writing to the
                  disk.  Otherwise,  the  'Save' button has to be
                  manually selected.

Hall of Fame... - Show  the  hi-score table in all its glory. The
                  hi-score  can be reset by selecting the 'Reset'
                  button.

About...        - Credits/programmers  address.  Please read... A
                  donation  of  any  amount  would  be gratefully
                  accept.
