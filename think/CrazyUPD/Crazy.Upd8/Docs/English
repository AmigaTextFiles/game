  Crazy Eight's by Curt Esser        Version 2.9b                 4-99

   This is my Amiga version of the old card game of Crazy 8's.

   This is a two player version, you against the computer, and is fully
 Mouse-driven.  There are no keyboard commands included (Every AMIGA ever
 made came with a Mouse, didn't it?), although if somebody REALLY wants them,
 write me for the @{"source code" link "Also" 0} and put them in yourself -- 
 I had enough trouble getting this to work right with the mouse!

   Well, OK, there is ONE keyboard command - press "M" or "m" to toggle the
 music off/on.  This can only be done when it is your turn (pointer's finger
 is UP) and it will have no effect if you have turned Music off on the @{"Set Up" link "Options" 0}
 screen. 

   This program is @{"EmailWare" link "Contact" 0} - send me an email and tell me what you think.
 (Even if you don't like it - tell me why!)  Most of the enhancements are due
 to user feedback - thanks to all who wrote!

   Use it at your own risk  (I assume no responsibility for any damages blah,
 blah, blah). --- Hey, it's Free!

   The game is copyrighted to me, so don't distribute altered versions
 without my permission!

   You may distribute it as you wish, but this file must be included, and
 make sure you get all the files in the Data subdirectory, or it will surely
 crash!  Do not alter this text file, and if you make any changes to the
 program, please send me a copy before distributing it!



                                                Have fun!
                                                See ya next update!

+++++ IMPORTANT!!!!!

  If you already have a version of Crazy 8's that saves scores, and you
  want to keep them, please copy them over into the new v2.9 directory.
  The file is "c8.scores" and it is found in the main directory.

  PLEASE do NOT try to update your current Crazy 8's directory by
  copying the files from the new directory into the old one.

  Many of the files have been changed or re-named, and you're bound to
  have problems.  You have been warned!

  If you have added music modules, sample sets, or card pictures, just
  copy them all over into the same places in the new Crazy 8's directory.

  DON'T copy the "Card.Prefs" program - it is no longer needed, and it
  won't work with v2.9 anyway.

  If you have created your own Locale file, you will need to update it,
  since some new texts have been added.
@endnode

@node "Play" " What are we supposed to do again?"
 
 After the game loads up, you will see the button menu.  Just click on the
 top left button (looks like a card back) to start the game.

   The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards.  Each player is dealt
 5 cards and the next card is turned up to start the discard pile.

 ->   Although your cards are face up, the computer does not know what     <-
 ->   is in your hand!  (That was for my son, who thinks the computer is   <-
 ->   cheating if it wins.)                                                <-
 
   The object is to get rid of all your cards, while sticking your opponent
 with as many cards left  as you can. 

   In order to play a card, it must be either the same Suit as the card on
 top of the discard pile, or the same Rank.

   Eight's are "wild" and can be played on any card.  Also, when an Eight is
 played, you can select the Suit which must be played on it.

   For example, let's say the Nine of clubs is the top card.  You can  play
 any club on it, or any other Nine (thus changing the Suit), or any Eight (in
 this case you may select ANY suit).  

   If you don't have a card in your hand that can be played, you must pick up
 cards from the deck until you can play.  However, you are not REQUIRED to
 play any card in your hand, and you may pick up as many cards as you wish 
 before playing (until the entire deck is used!)

   Your turn is not over until you play a card on the discard pile. If the
 entire deck gets used, the discard pile will be shuffled and used again
 (except the top card)

   When one player gets rid of all their cards, the hand is over, and cards
 remaining in the other player's hand are scored.  The cards are scored at
 their face value (6 points for a 6, etc.), picture cards are scored at 10
 points each, Aces are 20, and eights are 50 points.  Try not to get stuck
 with  an Eight in your hand!  When either player goes over the @{"pre-set" link "Options" 0}
 number of game  points (Default is 200) the game is over.

   Please note that the game is scored in reverse - points are ADDED to your
 score for the cards you have left when the other player goes out, so the
 idea, like in golf, is to get the LOWEST score possible!

   If you would rather have the points added to the WINNER's total, you can
 change this on the @{"Set Up" link "Options" 0} screen.

 >  You can click either Left or Right Mouse buttons to play.

 >  To play a card, simply click it with the Mouse. 
 >  To draw a card, click on the deck.
 >  Your hand is automatically sorted for you at the end of your turn.
 >  Click on Sort if you wish to sort it before your turn ends.
      (It won't be sorted If it doesn't need it.)
 >  Click @{"MENU" link "Options" 0} (or press ESC) to bring up the game menu at any time.
 >  Press "M" to turn the @{"music" link "Options" 0} off/on (only works when it's your turn)
 >  Press "n" to switch the game to NTSC mode 
 >  Press "p" to switch to PAL
 >  Click HIDE to push the screen to the back - this also turns the music
    off till you come back.  You can also grab the very top of the screen
    and pull it down if you wish (does NOT turn music off)
 >  That's it!  Have fun!

@node "Philosophy" " How enlightening!"


 I believe that a game, computer or otherwise, should be FUN and I don't
 think a game should take itself too seriously so I have tried to put in 
 a lot of sound effects and also tried to give the computer opponent a bit
 of personality.

 I also have included many options to allow you to configure the game to you
 to configure the game to your own taste, and more are planned.

 I hope you enjoy my efforts, but if not please see @{"Trashcan Installation" link "Install" 0} 

 Thanks to all the people who have written me already (so far everybody liked
 it - or maybe the people who don't didn't bother to write!)  I DO read and

play a 2 the other player must pick up 2 cards, etc.)

Also coming soon will be enhanced graphics, and hopefully support for GFX
cards.
@endnode

@node "Options" " Have it YOUR way"

 Click on the Prefs icon before starting the game or between games to change
 the following game options:

 Player names - you may enter new names (up to 8 characters) for the human
 player and the computer opponent.

 Locale - you may select a different language for the game to use for the
 text messages.
 
 You can also switch the sound filter on or off depending on your taste.

 If you wish, you can also disable Music entirely.  If you select this and
 save the prefs, no music will be loaded the next time you play the game.

 Finally, you can set the game points and select if the points should be 
 added to the Winner's or the Loser's score.

 Select "Save" to save the current selections to a Prefs file for later use
 or "Use" to keep them in effect for this time only.

 (Yes, just like an applications Prefs editor - Why not?)

 ----------------- Other Options --------------------------------------

 You can also change these at any time, by clicking the "Menu" button or
 pressing the "ESC" key:

 > Score button to show the score table

 > Palette button to cycle through the available colour palettes.

 > Sample button (@{"looks like" system "SYS:utilities/Multiview btn.pic"} a speaker) to select a different
 set of @{"sound samples" link "samples" 0}.

 > Music button (@{"looks like" system "SYS:utilities/Multiview btn.pic"} a keyboard) to select a new module.

@node "Technical" " Hmmmmm  very interesting"
 The game requires at least v2.0 Workbench  (Does anybody still use 1.3?)

 You also MUST have Reqtools installed.  If for some reason you don't,
 you will find it on Aminet as well as many other places.

 Version 2.9 will NOT work with a GFX card, unless it has a pass-through
 for standard screen modes.  Sorry, I am working on GFX card support,
 but this is quite difficult to do without a GFX card of my own.

 For those interested, the original program was written on an A1000 with 512k
 chip and 2 megs of fast ram using Workbench 1.3.

 Ver 2.0 was done on an A2000 with 1meg chip and 4meg fast Workbench 3.1

 Ver 2.1 - 2.3 were done on an A2500 (A2000 w factory installed 68020) 1meg
 chip   8meg fast ram     Workbench 3.1

 Ver 2.4 was done on my new :)  A1400T  2 meg chip  4 meg fast  WB 3.1

 Ver 2.5 > were done on the A1400T with a 68030 x 50 Blizzard board,
   and 16M fast ram

 It has been reported to also run fine on the following:

 A500   Wb 2.04
 A2000/68040                                                                  
 A3000
 A3000
w/PicassoIV                                                                   
 A4000                                                                        
 A1200  Wb. 3.0
 CD32 w SX1
 PC with WinAUE and 3.1 ROM file
                                                             
 The game releases all the memory it uses, and will multi-task if you have
 enough memory.

 The med Module is one I found on a PD disk and unfortunately I don't know
 who wrote it.  If anybody does, please let me know.
@endnode

@node "Tools" " Wow - you used all that stuff?"
 These tools were used to create this game:

 Blitz Basic v2.1  (If you are interested in learning to program on the
                   Amiga, I suggest you try the demo version of Blitz that
                   is found on Aminet.  This is an excellent and flexible
                   language that combines elements of basic, c, and can even
                   be used for assembly language programming.)

 FNS Fonts         An add-on library for Blitz by Steve Matty of RWE
                   It allows the improved printing routines used since
                   ver 2.3 and also allows the fonts to be included in the
                   program  (Notice you didn't need to stuff more fonts into
                   your overloaded Fonts: drawer?) 

 DeluxePaint IV    For the graphics

 Brilliance        For the graphics

 PPaint 7.1        For the graphics and icons                             

 OctaMed v4        For editing the sound samples

 GadToolsBox       GUI tool for laying out GadTools windows

 GTBoxConv         Converts the GadToolsBox source to Blitz source

------------------------------------------------------------------------------















































 The most important resource, however, was the knowledge I gained from the 
 members of the Blitz-list. Without their tips and advice, I wouldn't have
 had a clue on how to do some of the things you'll find in the program.
@endnode

@node "Problems" " This &%!!$# game doesn't work!"
 If you experience any problems trying to run the game, try rebooting your
 machine.  Some programs do not release all the memory when they exit, and
 your memory may have become "Fragmented" if you have run several other
 programs first.

 If a Warm Reboot ([Ctrl] + [L Amiga] + [R Amiga] doesn't help, try doing a
 Cold Reboot - turn the computer off, wait about 1 minute, and turn it on.
 Some programs leave things in memory that even a Warm Reboot won't remove.

 
 If you don't have a lot of chip mem available (the program needs about 420k
 chip and 558k total to run with the included module) make sure you close any
 open windows first - you can even drag the game icon out onto the Workbench
 and close the game drawer window and "Put Away" any icons that have been
 "Left Out" on the workbench screen.  Now try running the game. If it works
 OK now, you can go to the Set Up screen and turn the Music option off. 
 Now hit the Save button.  The next time you play, the game won't load any 
 music, and will use about 60k less chip ram.

 

 If this doesn't help, @{"contact me" link "Contact" 0} and let me know 
 what happened.

 Please let me know what system you have, what Workbench, how much chip
 memory and fast memory were available just before trying to run the game,
 and what other programs or system patches were running at the same time.

 Oh, and if you tried to install the game by copying files between the
 new 2.9 directory and your old Crazy 8's directory - don't write, because
 I can't help.  You'll need to restore the 2.9 directory to it's original
 state, and read the @{"Installation" link "Install" 0} instructions!

@node "Suggestions" " Here's what you should have done..."
 Your comments, suggestions, and bug reports are always welcome.

 Most of the improvements that have been added to this program have been
 suggested by the users -- in fact, I probably would have never bothered to
 update the program at all if it hadn't been for the many emails I have
 recieved from the users of this program.

 If you have any sound samples you think would be appropriate for the game,
 please send them to me and I will try to include them (and you will recieve
 credit in the docs)
@endnode

@node "Help Me" " Yes, finally....."

 OK, I've finally added some of the features you asked for:

 * Multiple player Prefs!  You can set up and save as many Prefs files
   as you like.  Each file has it's own settings for:
   
  > Game Options  (Names, scoring, etc...)
  > Sound Samples
  > Card images
  > Colour Palette
  > Music Module
  > Locale file

  When you save a Prefs file, it will have an icon added to it and will
  be put into your main Crazy 8's drawer.  You can either double-click
  on this icon to start Crazy 8's with these settings, or pick one 
  from inside the game by pressing the Load button on the menu.

  The prefs files use the icon in the "Icons/" drawer that is named
  ".8's.info"  You can substitute any icon you like, using the same
  name.  Make sure it is a "Project" icon, with "Crazy.8's" as the
  Default Tool.  

  If you don't want your prefs files to have an icon, remove it from the
  Icons/ drawer, or re-name it.

  You can save the settings at any time, but you can only load them
  between games.

 * All game options are now available directly from inside the program.
  Just click on the Menu button (or press ESC)

  The @{"Menu buttons" system "SYS:utilities/multiview btn.pic"} are from left to right, top to bottom:
  
  Play/Continue  Start or continue the game
  Score          Show score table
  Palette        Cycle between palettes
  @{"Sounds" link "samples" 0}         Select a new sample set
  Music          Select a new music module
  Quit           Exit the game

  About          Shows version number and date
  Load           Load a Prefs file
  Options        Change game options, including locale
  @{"Cards" link "Cards" 0}          Select a new card set
  Screen         Switch between NTSC/PAL screen
  Save           Save all current settings 
  

 * I've included another module, in case you get tired of the original.
  But don't forget, you can use ANY 4 channel Med module(s) you like.

 * A few minor graphic "glitches" have been fixed.
@endnode

@node "bugs" "An undocumented feature???"

  Well, not really a bug I suppose, more of a nuisance:

  If you use a hotkey or middle mouse button to change to a different screen
  the program thinks it is still active, and will respond to your first
  mouseclick with the error sound.  Also, the music will continue to play.
  The only way to avoid this is to use the "Hide" button to leave the game
  screen.

  The solution to this would be simple, but I don't know how to tell which
  screen is at the front of the display.  (Not the active screen, the one
  which is currently in front whether it is active or not).  I would be very
  greatful if someone knows how to determine this.

  If you know how, please @{"write me" link "Contact" 0} and let me know.  I will send you a free
  registered copy of the game for your trouble...  Oh, wait -- the game is
  free anyway!   Would you settle for a nice email and credit in the next
  version?

 ordinary text files, and may be edited with any text editor.

 All lines starting with a ; are comments, and will not appear in the
 program.  You can change these as you wish.
 Simply change the other lines as necessary.  Some lines have a limit on the
 length of the text.  Please respect these limits, as the program will not
 use any longer lines than indicated.

 Also, the text file should be kept in the same format - do not add any blank
 lines or extra linefeeds. etc.
 
 All standard characters are available in the game's font, the same as found
 in the system's Topaz font.

 If your language requires different characters, please contact me.

 When your text is finished, save it in the locale drawer.
 
 If you create a new language file, I ask that you please send me a copy so I
 can include it with future releases.  You will be given proper credit.

 Also, if you wish to translate the Guide file to your language, this would
 be greatly appreciated. This is not necessary, I can still include your file
 with the game without it.

 
 Please do NOT include any bad language in your translation, this game is for
 use by children as well as adults!  And please report any version to me that
 you find any offensive language in!

 NOTE:  You can also use Crazy 8's locale feature to create your own sets of
 texts for the game.  Just edit the texts as above, then save them with a
 new name, like "English1" or "Simpsons.text" or whatever you like.
 Then start the game, go to the "Options" page, and select your new locale
 file.  Now save a Prefs file with a new name, and every time you play with
 that Prefs file, Crazy 8's will use your new locale text!

@node "Cards" "Using different card sets"
 To use a different card set:

Double click on the Card Pref icon, and select a card picture.



To make a new card set - edit one of the card pictures in the cards drawer in
any paint program.

NOTE:  DO NOT change the positions or sizes of the cards.

     DO NOT use colour 0  (the background) in the card pictures

     DO NOT change the size of the picture or screen - the program
         needs a 320 x 200 pic!

     It is recommended that you DO NOT Over-write the original pictures!
         Just save your card picture with a different name.

     DO NOT save your picture with a stencil left on - this will
         cause problems!  Just make sure stencils are turned off
         before saving your picture. 

     There is no point in changing the palette - the game uses
         it's own palettes anyway, the card picture's palette will
         be ignored. The pics are set to match the game's default 
         palette.

     There is no harm in adding things to the area surrounding the
         cards.  If you make a set you would like to be included in
         the distribution, feel free to add your signature or logo
         or anything else.  

       


Have fun, and if you come up with a nice set of cards, send 'em along!

@node "samples" "Sound sample sets"

 You can change samples sets from the game menu at any time.

 I have included two sets with the game, and you can find more
 on my website.

 But it is easy to create your own sets, if you like:

 Make a copy of one of the included sample sets  (the whole directory)
 Name it whatever you like.

 Now, copy in your new samples, using the SAME NAMES as the existing
 samples in the drawer.

 If there are any samples you don't want the game to play at all, just
 delete them.  In fact, you could create an empty drawer and select it
 as the sample set to have NO sounds heard during the game.

 If you have a sampler, you could even use your own voice in the game,
 or your friends, family, etc.

 Just make sure that all the samples are standard iff/8svx samples, and
 less than 128,000 bytes in size, or the game will refuse them.
