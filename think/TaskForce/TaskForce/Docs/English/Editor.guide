@NODE "Introduction" "What is this program for?"
This editor was written for use with the strategy game TaskForce. It
allows you to design your own maps and define individual mission
objectives.

While TaskForce itself with just a few pre-designed scenarios is rather
inflexible, this tool offers you everything you need to create an
almost infinite number of equally challenging and entertaining hours
of fun. Think I'm boasting? Well... erm... I guess you're right. Anyway,
if you still need to read the "What is this for?" section, you might as
well believe me ;-). Better go on to the real things...
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Requirements" "Requirements"
To run the TaskForce Mission Editor you need any Amiga model with at
least Kickstart 2.04.

reqtools.library V38 or higher must be installed on your system.
The library is included in this archive.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Installation" "Installation"
The editor will automatically be installed when you execute the
TaskForce installation script.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Design" "Create your own missions"
A word of warning before you begin: The editor is currently not what
I would call a truly user-friendly program. It was first only intended
as a developer tool to make mission creation easier for me. However, I
have now decided also to release the editor as well to allow other
people to design their own missions. As a result of this policy, some
routines are not really secure. Read this manual thoroughly before you
start messing around! This means, for example, that you have to care
for obsolete events when you delete a character. Illegal input will
usually not bring up error messages, but may cause unpredictable
behaviour (and will probably crash your system) when you try to run
the module with TaskForce. You should always know what you are doing!

Now, for those of you who haven't hidden in some safe place, yet,
here's the basic concept. Missions in TaskForce consist of six
different parts:

     1. @{"map" LINK "Map"}
     2. @{"characters" LINK "Characters"}
     3. @{"items" LINK "Items"}
     4. @{"events" LINK "Events"}
     5. @{"objectives" LINK "Objectives"}
     6. @{"miscellaneous" LINK "Misc"}

You can write the mission data to a file in an almost human-readable
format using @{I}Export Data@{UI} from the @{I}Project@{UI} menu. This file can be
read using any ASCII text editor. This way it is much easier to keep
track of the data and to debug a mission, should the need arise.

At the beginning you have to decide whether you want to create a
mission for one or two human players. According to this decision,
you have to design the map and define the goals for the teams.
As the @{"computer player" LINK "AI_FEATURES"} is currently not very smart, don't expect
him to press buttons, unlock doors, open crates etc. It will
completely ignore objectives like @{"Coord" LINK "MOBJ_COORD"} or @{"Download" LINK "MOBJ_DOWNLOAD"},
but some, like e.g. @{"Kill" LINK "MOBJ_KILL"}, of course still have their effects.

Human players may not control more than eight units at any time during
the game. This is especially important to remember when you are using
events of the types @{"Reinforcements" LINK "ACT_REINFORCEMENTS"} or @{"Change Alignment" LINK "ACT_ALIGNMENT"}.
For computer controlled players there are no such limitations.

Finally, you need to write a mission briefing so the players know
what they are expected to do. For some guidelines on how to do this
have a look at the briefing of one of the missions included in the
archive. These briefings should contain some basic information about
the mission, like difficulty, objectives, and possibly some kind of
background information or story.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Map" "How to edit the map"
The map created at the start of the editor has a size of 30 * 30
squares. If you want to change this, select @{I}New Map@{UI} from the
@{I}Project@{UI} menu. Width and height of a map may be anything from
20 to 80. The new map will be filled with the currently selected
block.

Pressing space will place the block that is currently selected in the
selection area at the bottom of the screen at the position of the
cursor. You can move the cursor around on the map display using the
number pad. Pressing '5' will activate paste mode. If you now move
the cursor the selected block will automatically be placed at your
current position. Pressing '5' again will deactivate paste mode.

You can select a different block using the cursor keys or by clicking
the left mouse button on the desired block.

To jump to a different location on the map, press 'g' and enter the
appropriate coordinates or click the left mouse button on the small
overview map at the lower right of the screen.

To assist you in your operations there are some drawing tools. By
pressing 'r' you can draw rectangles filled with the selected block.
'l' will help you draw lines. Using 'x' you can finally replace all
occurances of one block by the selected block. This is useful if you
suddenly decide to use moats instead of walls, for example.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Characters" "How to create life"
An important note: @{I}Human players may control a maximum of eight
units at any time.@{UI}

If you press 'c' on the map, you get to the character window.

Each character has some individual characteristics which are used to
determine how well he can do certain things.

If you create or edit a character, you are asked to enter the values
you want him to have.

* @{I}Name:@{UI} Call him what you like, but keep it short (max.19 characters).
    Here you can also set the unit's user ID. With the help of this ID
    tag you can group characters. It is currently used only in
    connection with the @{"Kill" LINK "MOBJ_KILL"} objective.

* @{I}Location:@{UI} Where will he start on the map. Note: If you intend to use
    a character as a @{"Reinforcement" LINK "ACT_REINFORCEMENTS"}, you needn't bother
    about this, but you must set Team to Reinforcement.

* @{I}Team:@{UI} For which team does he fight. @{I}Team 1@{UI} and @{I}Team 2@{UI} represent the
    according players. @{I}Team CPU@{UI} is a third team which will always
    be controlled by the @{"computer" LINK "AI_FEATURES"}. This team cannot have any objectives
    but it will automatically fight both of the first two teams. The
    difficulty setting for members of the CPU team is @{I}Advanced@{UI}.

    Units intended to be used with the @{"Reinforcements" LINK "ACT_REINFORCEMENTS"} event
    (and only those) must be assigned to @{I}Reinforcements@{UI}.
    @{I}Unaligned@{UI} units are controlled by noone. Such a character
    can be used either as a "dumb target" or in connection with a
    @{"Change Alignment" LINK "ACT_ALIGNMENT"} event.

* @{I}HP:@{UI} Hit points. The average value for the average human is about 25.

* @{I}AP:@{UI} Action points. Average value 8. Be careful when altering this
    value. Action points have a vast effect on the game and may
    easily unbalance it. Use wisely.

* @{I}Attributes:@{UI}
  * Strength: Defines how much a character can carry and how hard he
    can hit in close combat.
  * Firearms: Defines the character's marksmanship.
  * Close Combat: The better this value the more likely he is to score
    a hit in close combat.
  * Perception: At the moment only used in skill tests and guard mode.
    If the defender has got a higher perception rating than the
    attacker, the defender has the first shot.

* @{I}Features:@{UI} Here you can do some finetuning on the units you create.
  * Mobile: Mobile units are able to walk around. Given no other orders
    they will wander around randomly instead of playing dumb targets.
    (default)
  * Invisibility: The only means to possibly track down invisible
    units is a @{I}thermal scanner@{UI} (or pure luck). The computer player
    has no means to defend himself against invisible units.
  * IR Signature: Determines whether the unit will be detected by
    @{I}thermal scanners@{UI}. (default)
  * Regeneration: Regenerating units will regain one HP per turn if
    they have been wounded.
  * Android: Android type units cannot benefit from @{I}Medkits@{UI} and @{I}Steroids@{UI}.

* @{I}Talk:@{UI} This is the standard response of the unit if someone tries to
    talk to it. Can be changed during play by the @{"New Talk" LINK "ACT_NEW_TALK"} event.
    No selection will result in the message "There is no reply."
    Naturally, this only applies if the unit talked to is not
    unconscious.

* @{I}Image:@{UI} Should really be self-explanatory...

* @{I}Task:@{UI} Here you can give some basic @{"commands" LINK "AI_Commands"} to computer-controlled
    units. Units with no orders will move around randomly until they
    discover an enemy unit.

    A command of standard priority can be cancelled at any time if the
    computer believes to have a better idea, while high priority
    commands always take precedence over the commands issued by the
    computer. However, in some situations this may render the actions
    of the computer player somewhat ineffective.

After that you can put up to eight items in the character's inventory.
This process is exactly the same as in @{"item creation" LINK "Items"}, but you
only have to define type and charges. Keep in mind that the overall
weight of all items may not exceed Strength times 4. The editor takes
care of this, and notifies you when you reach this limit. The checkbox
behind each item marks whether this item can be dropped. This is
especially useful when you equip a computer unit with a nasty weapon,
e.g. a grenade launcher, but you don't want the player to get his
hands on it. By unckecking the box, the launcher will perish along
with the unit.

Pressing 'n' or the 'Next Unit' gadget during a game of TaskForce will
select the player's unit following the active one. Therefore you can
group certain units so that they are activated subsequently by
altering their position in the units list.

The menu item @{I}Unit Names@{UI} in the @{I}Edit@{UI} menu allows you to edit
the names of all units. This option is especially useful for
translators.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "AI_FEATURES" "Behind the enemy lines"
If you decide to create a mission yourself it may be important to know
what the computer player will or won't do, so you can better predict
his movements and steer them if neccessary.

At the moment the computer player isn't able to handle any events,
so the single player missions should be kept simple in layout and
internal structure. The only objectives that will have any effect
are @{"Kill" LINK "MOBJ_KILL"} and @{"Survive" LINK "MOBJ_SURVIVE"} objectives in so far, as the computer
will score the points if the condition is met. However, this does
not mean that it will "hunt" the target. Likewise it won't
especially protect a unit targeted by a Survive objective.
By issueing the corresponding @{"'Goto' command" LINK "AI_Commands"}, you can also use
the @{"Coords" LINK "MOBJ_COORDS"} objective.

The computer player should, for the reasons mentioned above, be used
as an obstacle for the human player to accomplish his own goals, rather
than as an intelligent foe with goals of his own.

Computer-controlled units will make use of firearms and short-ranged
weapons, but no throwing weapons. They will reload their guns in case
they are given spare ammo. If they don't carry the required ammo,
they will search their belongings for other, more lethal weapons
and equip them if possible. Of course, guns take precedence over
hand-to-hand weapons here.

CPU units will apply @{I}medkits@{UI} if they think they could need
them, but they won't even open locked doors if they carry the
appropriate key. They won't pick up any items lying around, either.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "AI_Commands" "Standard commands of the computer player"
Available commands are:

* @{I}Goto@{UI}: The unit will try to reach the destination. If it encounters
    any resistance on its way it will first try to eliminate the threat
    and afterwards resume its course.

* @{I}Goto (strict)@{UI}: This is similar to the Goto command, but the unit
    won't heed any other forces. It will simply ignore friend and foe
    and head straight for the destination. This is the only legal
    command for non-aligned units.

* @{I}Patrol@{UI}: The unit will go back and forth between two waypoints and
    attack enemy units.

* @{I}Sentry@{UI}: The unit won't move but attack all enemy forces in sight.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Items" "How to edit items"
If you press 'i' in the main window, the item window will pop up. It
contains a list of all items on the map that are not carried by a
character. Here you can add new items, edit or delete them.

When you select @{I}New@{UI} or @{I}Edit@{UI} the editor will prompt you for some
numbers. A list of possible values can be found at the @{"appendix" LINK "Appendix A"} of
this document.

Once you have created the item, you can only change its position on
the map, its charges, or delete it. Depending on the type of item you
chose you may not even be able to alter the charges. Again, see the
@{"appendix" LINK "Appendix A"} for more information.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Events" "How to create events"
Events are, as the name could have made you think, events that may or
may not occur in the course of a mission. All events must be operated
to trigger them. Examples include, for example, traps in crates which
are set off when the crate is opened.

Basically, the procedure to create and edit events ressembles the item
creation. The only difference are the parameters that have to be
entered. I can give you no general description here as the required
input differs from event to event. The exact values may be looked up
in the @{"events list" LINK "Appendix B"}.

To modify the order in which the events are processed you can move
them up or down in the list. The higher an event is positioned in the
list the higher its priority. New events are always added at the head
of the list.

For most events you can define @{"flags" LINK "Misc"} to restrict
their use.

Whenever you create a new event, it is automatically initialized to
some default values. Note however, that those values may still be
illegal (like placing reinforcements on top of walls) but should
prevent crashes with the main program.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Objectives" "How to define mission objectives"
By mission objectives you define how many points a player is awarded
for which actions. Once a player has gained 100 points, the mission is
considered complete. A player may also lose points, but the score will
never drop below -100 points.

Each mission objective is valid for only one of the players so it is
possible to define entirely different goals for the opposing teams.
A possible setup could command Team A to kill a bad guy, get his nasty
weapon and retreat to point X, while Team B has to free a hostage and
guide it safely back to point Y. Ideally, of course, the two plots
should intertwine somewhere, or the two parties might not even see
each other from a distance.

You can select a text for each objective that will be displayed in a
requester when the points are scored.

Similar to many @{"events" LINK "Events"} you can set @{"flags" LINK "Misc"} for objectives, too. However,
they are used in a different way. While event flags are used to
determine whether an event can be executed, the objective flags will
be set when the objective is fulfilled.

You always have to make sure that both players can achieve 100 points.
Otherwise they won't be able to win.

In most cases you should create an objective which ends the mission
when all members of one team are dead. Note that this is not neccessary
for the computer in a single player mission, as the mission is always
considered a failure when all the human player's units are killed.

The procedure to create mission objectives is similar to the creation
of events, and all important figures appear in the @{"objectives list" LINK "Appendix C"}.

It is important to note that the conditions for the completion of
mission objectives are always and only checked at the @{I}end of a turn@{UI}.

Whenever you create a new objective, it is automatically initialized
to some default values. Note however, that those values may still be
illegal but should nevertheless prevent crashes with the main program.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Misc" "Something for nothing..."

Select the @{I}Settings@{UI} item from the @{I}Edit@{UI} menu to alter the
following settings.

@{I}Number of Players@{UI}
This is the number of human players.

@{I}Flags@{UI}
For each mission TaskForce maintains a set of eight user-controlled
global flags which are used to enable or disable certain events.
Every time an event is operated the flags set for the event are
checked. If all enabled event flags are also set in the global mission
flags the event is executed as usual. If one or more of the requested
flags are not set the event is considered disabled.
Some events do not allow to set flags. They are always executed.

The initial state of the global flags can be adjusted in the editor.
During the course of a mission they can be manipulated using the
@{"Set Flag" LINK "ACT_SET_FLAG"} event or by reaching @{"objectives" LINK "Objectives"}.

@{I}Texts@{UI}
These are standard messages that will be displayed at the end of a
mission; one for the happy end and the other for defeat.

@{I}Turn Limit@{UI}
You can set a turn limit for your mission. In this case the action will
end at the end of the specified turn if it has not been completed then.

@NODE "ACT_ALIGNMENT" "Change Alignment"
This event makes it possible to assign characters to a different team
during a mission. This is not intended to switch mercenaries from
player 1 to player 2, but to give non-controlled characters a
controller. This way you can, for example, free a hostage and guide
it back safely.

@{I}Location@{UI} is the position of the event, not of the character. You
already have to set the unit's position when you create it.

@{I}Access@{UI} allows you to restrict this event to one team. Normally
all events can be activated by everyone. However, imagine Team 1 is to
free a hostage, while Team 2 tries to fend off the intruders (Team 1).
If a member of the second team now pulls the lever to open the
cell door, the hostage will instantly join Team 1, even though they
possibly don't even know of each other (at least not their positions).
If you restrict the event to Team 1, you can prevent this situation.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_CHANGE_TILE" "Change Tile"
Using @{I}Change Tile@{UI} you can replace any one block of the map by
another block of your choice.

This event allows you to create effects such as the revelation of a
secret passage when a lever is pulled, the destruction of the only
bridge across a river or you can trap a mercenary.

If the square to be changed is occupied by a unit and the new tile is
impassable (like a wall or water) the occupant will be killed. This
way it's possible to create trap doors or crush units between closing
doors.

Under @{I}Operation@{UI} you can select one of three possible
operating modes for this event.
1. The event does always work. Each time the event is activated the
   target square is altered again.
2. The event does always work, but each time the new block and the
   target block are swapped. That means, if you replaced water with
   a wall, the next activation will break down the wall and flood the
   square again.
3. The event works only n times.

@{I}You don't need to define an event of this type for doors and levers.
They are handled automatically.@{UI}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_EXPLOSION"  "Explosion"
This event lets you create instant fireworks at the touch of a button.

The standard value for explosion @{I}power@{UI} as used by Plastic
Explosives, for example, is 30.

The @{I}hot spot@{UI} is, of course, the square where the explosion
will be ignited.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_FIND_ITEM"  "Find Item"
With the help of this event you can make items available during a
mission. These items will not be placed on the map and remain
invisible until the event is activated. You can, for example, hide
something in a crate. The item will drop to the square the activating
character is standing on.

Some containers such as crates can be destroyed. In such a case all
events placed on the square are discarded. With @{I}Find Item@{UI} you
can decide on whether you want to destroy the item as well or create
it and drop it to the chosen location.

When the event is activated, the operating character must succeed in a
@{I}perception@{UI} test. If a random number between 1 and 11 exceeds
his Perception rating, he won't notice the item.
The modifier you can enter here is added to the random value. This
means that a modifier greater than 0 makes it more difficult to notice
the item, while a value smaller than 0 makes it easier. A modifier of
+10 makes it impossible even for the eagle's eyes while a modifier of
-10 guarantees success.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_GIVE_ORDERS"  "Give Orders"
This event will give new orders to a computer-controlled unit. Most of
the @{"basic commands" LINK "AI_Commands"} are available here.

The command priority affects whether the orders actually take effect.
@{I}High@{UI} and @{I}standard@{UI} priority commands are always issued, but
the latter can be changed again by the computer player. Orders of @{I}Low@{UI}
priority are only executed if the targeted unit is otherwise
unoccupied.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_LOCKED_DOOR"  "Lock Door"
This event allows you to lock doors, so that they can't be opened
normally. First there are three possibilities: The door could be jammed
completely, or you just need some kind of key to get through, or you
just want the computer player(s) to keep their hands away from it.
This way you can make sure that the human player(s) enter the location
first. After the door has been opened or closed once, the lock is
removed entirely.

If you choose to have a key, there are three more options.
1. The door can always be operated by someone who owns the appropriate
   key.
2. The key is only required for the very first use. After the door has
   been operated once, everybody may open or close it.
3. Even with the key the door can be opened or closed only once. After
   that it won't move any more.

There may be only one event of this type per block.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_MESSAGE"  "Message"
@{I}Message@{UI} offers you the possibility to include your own messages
in a mission.

To do this you have to create text file containing all messages you
want to include. This can be done using any ASCII editor.
The file must have the following structure:

<--- Start of example --->
# <- This marks a new message.
This is my first message.
# New message. This line is not interpreted. May be used for comments.
This is my second message.
This also belongs to my second message.
And this is the third line.
# Next separator = third message
Have a nice day!
<--- End of example --->

A single message must not be longer than 1000 characters including
newlines. If the message is to be displayed in the text box, it must
not be longer than 35 characters and may not contain newlines.
Lines to be displayed in a requester should be about 60 characters
at maximum. You can import 30000 bytes of text at most.

Separator lines (starting with #) must not be longer than 100
characters.

After you have created the text file you must import the messages to
the editor using the menu item @{I}Import texts@{UI} in the @{I}Project@{UI}
menu. Now the messages should be available.
Messages containing newlines will look a bit strange in the listviews
but will be displayed correctly in requesters.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_MOVE_TILE" "Move Tile"
Using @{I}Move Tile@{UI} you can realize things like rafts or moving
platforms. If the event is activated the specified square will move
horizontally or vertically until it has reached its destination.
Characters as well as items and events located on the same square will
be transported along. If the event is triggered a second time, the
platform will be moved back where it came from.

If you have two or more events controlling the same platform the block
to replace the platform image must be the same at the source and the
destination.

If you have set up only one such event you may use different blocks.

The destination square as well as the block that will replace the
platform image @{U}must@{UU} be of a type characters can't walk onto.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_NEW_TALK"  "New Talk"
In TaskForce units can talk to other units. As default setting you
will get the "There is no reply." message unless you specified
another text when creating the unit. This event allows you to
change the response during the course of a mission.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_PLAY_SOUND"  "Play Sound"
Playing a sound effect can be useful to illustrate that something has
happened. Suppose you have set up a terminal which will open or close
a door when operated. If you don't play a sound effect it is often
difficult to note whether the action had any effect. If you play the
door sound on operation the player will know he triggered something.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_REINFORCEMENTS"  "Reinforcements"
With @{I}Reinforcements@{UI} you can make additional forces available for
one of the teams .

If you want to use a character as a reinforcement, you must assign him
to the team @{I}Reinforcement@{UI} accordingly.

If the square you want the new unit to appear on is already occupied,
all adjacent squares will be checked in random order. If one of them
is passable the unit will be placed there. If no free square is found
the unit will be discarded!
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_REMOVE_EVENTS"  "Remove Events"
@{I}Remove Events@{UI} disables all or a certain type of events at the
specified location.

The target sqare @{B}must@{UB} be different from the event location.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_SCORE"  "Score"
@{I}Score@{UI} is a mixture between an event and an objective.
Objectives are rather restricted as victory conditions are only
checked for at the end of a turn. This event gives you the
opportunity to award points for certain operations. This could
be opening a door, using a teleporter or a computer, or talking
to another character.

The points are scored  when a unit of the requested team operates
the event.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_SET_FLAG"  "Set Flag"
This event sets and/or unsets the specified global @{"flags" LINK "Misc"}.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_TELEPORT"  "Teleport"
@{I}Teleport@{UI} allows you to transport units to any place on the map.

There may be problems if the destination square is already occupied,
because only one unit may be on a single square at the same time, so
you can decide on whether you want to cancel the transport in that
case, or if you want both units to swap their positions.

It is possible to remove units from game using this event. Do not set
this option if you are using the @{"Kill" LINK "MOBJ_KILL"} objective with group or
team targets! In this case all units removed from game will be marked
killed. There are no problems with single targets, though.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ACT_TIME_LIMIT"  "Set Time Limit"
By using @{I}Set Time Limit@{UI} you can manipulate or set up a time limit
during the course of a mission. It is recommended that you only use this
event in single player scenarios, as only the player who activates the
event is informed of the new time limit.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Appendix C" "The list of mission objectives"

@{JCENTER}@{"   Coords  " LINK "MOBJ_COORD"}
@{"  Download " LINK "MOBJ_DOWNLOAD"}
@{"   Escape  " LINK "MOBJ_ESCAPE"}
@{"  Get Item " LINK "MOBJ_GET_ITEM"}
@{"    Kill   " LINK "MOBJ_KILL"}
@{"   Repair  " LINK "MOBJ_REPAIR"}
@{"  Survival " LINK "MOBJ_SURVIVE"}
@{" Tile Type " LINK "MOBJ_TILE_TYPE"}@{JLEFT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE "MOBJ_COORD" "Coords"
Points for this objective are awarded when a character reaches the
required coordinates and ends his turn there.

Normally this goal applies to the entire team. If you want a specific
character to get to the denoted target square you must explicitly say
so.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "MOBJ_DOWNLOAD" "Download"
Points for this objective are awarded when a character uses a @{I}Data
Disk@{UI} on the specified computer terminal.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "MOBJ_ESCAPE" "Escape"
Points for this objective are awarded when the specified unit leaves
the map using a @{"teleporter" LINK "ACT_TELEPORT"}.

Alternately, you can specify a certain item type. In that case points
are scored if any unit of the team carries the specified item when it
leaves the map.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "MOBJ_GET_ITEM" "Get Item"
Points for this objective are awarded when the specified item is
brought to the specified coordinates. The item must be dropped to the
ground there to complete this goal and will be removed from the map
entirely. If you are requested to bring two charges of the required
item, and you drop three of them, only the requested charges are
removed.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "MOBJ_KILL" "Kill"
Points for this objective are awarded when the specified target is
eliminated. The target may be a @{I}single@{UI} unit, an entire @{I}team@{UI},
or a specially marked @{I}group@{UI}.

If you selected a group as a target, all members of this group must
have the same @{I}user ID@{UI}. They will be identified by this ID tag
so this is the only information needed by the event.

Do not use teams or groups as targets if you are also using
@{"teleporters" LINK "ACT_TELEPORT"} which allow units to leave the map!
In that case, escaped units would also be marked killed.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "MOBJ_REPAIR" "Repair"
Points for this objective are awarded when a unit applies a @{I}Toolkit@{UI}
to the specified "broken" object.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "MOBJ_SURVIVE" "Survival"
Points for this objective are awarded if the given character is still
alive on the specified turn.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "MOBJ_TILE_TYPE" "Tile Type"
Points for this objective are awarded when the specified map square
has changed to the required type. This could be a box that must be
destroyed, a door that must be opened, or a secret passage that must
be discovered.
