@{JCENTER}@{B}The Plot@{UB}@{JLEFT}

Believe it or not, it seems like the script authors of countless
horrible B-movies were right, after all. Yesterday evening we
received reports of a U.F.O. going down about fifty miles northeast
of our base. At first we didn't pay any attention to the calls of
several frightened citizens, but when there were finally more than
a hundred in less than an hour and some even reported that the
aliens had begun to slaughter the civilians we had to go out and
take a look at it.

The recon squad survived just about eight minutes after they had
arrived at the scene, but the recordings we got from their cameras
actually suggest that we're dealing with extraterrestrial lifeforms
here. And they don't seem to be particularly friendly.

Our task is to restore law and order around the landing site. We
have been authorized to use every means at our disposal to get rid
of the invaders. If possible recover some alien technology or
corpses, but don't hesitate to blow up the ship if you've got no
alternatives - but try to get any hostages out first. I'll rely
entirely on your professional assessment, gentlemen. Be careful.
We still don't know exactly who - or what - we are dealing with.
Don't disappoint me. Dismissed.
