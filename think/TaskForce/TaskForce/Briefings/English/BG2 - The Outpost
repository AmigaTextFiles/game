Difficulty: Moderate

@{JCENTER}@{B}Briefing@{UB}@{JLEFT}

Due to the success of the previous mission, our computer team has
decrypted enough Rebel transmissions to ascertain the location of a
Rebel resupply base in the Beta Gleny system.

You will be commanding a Marine strike force. Your force will be given
sealed suits and explosives and dropped near the station. Proceed to
the station and use the explosives to breach the hull.

Once you have boarded the station, your primary mission is to remove
the station Commander. Secondly, you are to eliminate the research
scientists who allowed the rebels to capture the station. Thirdly, you
are to destroy the ammunition stores and neutralize the station's
usefulness as a resupply point. Destruction of the entire station is
unacceptable - we need the station intact for future use as our own
base.

There are some functional escape pods located on the sunward side of
the station. At least one of your men must report back to Mission
Control when the objectives have been completed.
