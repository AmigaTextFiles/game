@{I}That was a good job.@{UI} Those were your first thoughts after you
had left the storehouse. But now, you were not so sure any more. You
had been assigned to the team only two days ago, and this was your
first real assault. And it was an important one! Only 24 hours ago
intelligence had reported that they had located the local headquarters
of the Syndicate, an organisation that had once been an associate of
your employer, but now tried to establish connections with rival
companies, because they did not agree to your employer's business
philosophy. Just because he blew up the R&D facility of one of his
rivals! Ridiculous.

But now they should pay for their arrogance. During the last half an
hour you had planted an impressive amount of explosives in the
storehouse which served as the Syndicate's headquarters. Everything
went as smoothly as expected... until you got out.

Then you got a call from the group south of the building: @{I}Beta,
have you seen Bragg? He must still be in there.@{UI} That was sort of bad
news. Your employer would not be very pleased if you had to tell him
you had lost one of his best mercenaries. It will probably be a more
comfortable fate to die right now than to face him that way. The only
alternative is to go in, find Bragg and get him out before the
building finally crumbles...

@{JCENTER}Find Sergeant Bragg and bring him out to the south
of the storehouse in less than 14 turns, alive.
Do not engage in time-consuming firefights!@{JLEFT}
