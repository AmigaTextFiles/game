One of the allies of the Syndicate allegedly discovered a substance
that can be used to develop some kind of plasma gun. As you can
imagine this situation is not tolerable. Such a weapon in the hands
of the enemy might cause some problems @{I}you@{UI} wouldn't want to
face.

Therefore the only solution is to prevent them from completing their
research. I've got the confidential information that the only
existing sample of this substance is currently stored in one of
the Syndicate's research facilities. Incredibly, it seems like the
formula can be found in the complex, too.

Your job will be to get into the research center, find the substance,
blow it up, and return the formula to the rendezvous next to the
sentry north of the building.

My sources claim that it's virtually impossible to reach the sample.

If everything else fails you can still find... @{I}<crackle>
