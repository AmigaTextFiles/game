a TaskForce scenario by Jens Granseuer@{JLEFT}


@{I}"Welcome to the Urban Combat finals of 2032. Millions of spectators at
their video screens and some two hundred right along the combat zone are
expecting a hot match between the Desperados and the Fallen Angels.
Both teams make their first appearance ever in the finals. The stats
indicate a slight advantage for the Desperados, but the Angels are
known to be especially devastating against seemingly stronger teams as
they have already proven on several occasions this season. Despite
their impressive record of eight victorious matches in a row, the odds
are 3:2 against them..."@{UI}

Urban Combat is a cross between football and a gunfight. Teams consist
of five players each, who are allowed to carry armour and certain
weapons like knives and even small firearms. Hidden somewhere in the
combat zone are two data disks. The aim of the game is to find one of
those - or possibly both, so that the opponent can't get his hands on
them - and upload the virus on it to the computer in the small booth
on the opposing team's turf while they are trying to do exactly the
same.

In this struggle no interference from outside of the combat zone is
allowed, but everything in the zone may be used in any way to reach
your aim and to prevent your opponent from reaching his.

All players carry implants that will be activated by the virus and
will turn their muscles offline, so to speak. The mechanism does not
work perfectly yet and some players have already suffered permanent
damage but hey, that's life!
