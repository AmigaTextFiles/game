@{JCENTER}@{B}Project: Pygmalion@{UB}
a TaskForce scenario by Jens Granseuer@{JLEFT}

Difficulty: Medium

@{JCENTER}@{B}The Plot@{UB}@{JLEFT}

The Syndicate is up to another threatening research project. This
time they have chosen to play God. They are trying to find a way
to merge the advantages of the human mind and technology to create
some kind of super soldier. Those @{I}Cybernatics@{UI} as the scientists
of the Syndicate call them would have the logic capabilities of
ordinary humans, but their body would be improved with some toys
to increase their strength and stamina as well as to improve their
vision, response time, shooting skills...

I suppose you have realized by now that it would be just slightly
inconvenient to let them finish their research. We can't take any
risk here, so you are going to make your way into their research
facility and upload a computer virus to their mainframe which will
devastate the system so that they can't reconstruct any of their
data.

After you have infected the computer system use the teleporter
they have somewhere in there to get out again. That's all.

Oh, I almost forgot, they already might have a prototype of these
@{I}Cybernatics@{UI} of theirs in action. If this happens to be true
you will of course disassemble that monster before you return,
right? Now get lost, I still have work to do...
