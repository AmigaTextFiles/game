@{JCENTER}@{B}Briefing@{UB}@{JLEFT}

The Beta Gleny Orbital Station has become a concern to our Joint Chiefs
of Staff. There are confirmed reports that Rebel forces are using this
station as a base for several scientific research projects. You have
been appointed to assemble a strike force to deal with the Rebels.

The station is in a very important tactical position, and must remain
intact. We can not spare the resources to build a new station in the
Beta Gleny system. Once captured, we will be using this base to stage
further attacks on nearby Rebel strongholds. We have decided on a small
strike force to reduce the chances of the Rebels self-destructing the
station as a response to threat.

Your primary mission is to open a communications channel from the main
control room and upload any encryption codes you find. If you can
accomplish this, we will be able to uncover the locations of the Rebel
supply caches elsewhere in the Beta Gleny system.

Your secondary mission is to confirm reports that the Rebels are
obtaining technology and assistance from outlaws of the Kroth Empire.
Two Kroth advisors will accompany your strike team. We would like to
take this opportunity to remind you of the tense relations between the
Terrans and the Kroth. Should the advisors be lost during the mission,
we stand a very good chance of being attacked by Kroth forces.
Succeeding in the mission and bringing both Advisors back will go a
long way towards cementing the treaty and proving our worthiness in
their eyes.

Should you discover any outlaw Kroth on board the station, eliminate
them. There can be no escapees. If you do find evidence of Kroth/Terran
scientific collaboration, you are to download any information you can
and erase it from their computer networks. Then proceed to eliminate
any scientists on board. We can not risk the Rebels acquiring Kroth
technology.

Additionally, you are to search out any prisoners of war. There are
unconfirmed rumours that several men from one of your old infantry
units are being held captive on board the station.

Your strike team and advisors will be ferried to the station in a Kroth
cloaked boarding vessel. You should have the element of surprise and be
able to infiltrate the station easily. Remember that the Kroth do not
leave any room for backing out of a fight - once the boarding grapples
close, they need to be cut loose. You will have to find an alternate
method of leaving the station if you cannot complete all of the
assigned missions.

As you know, every man is valuable. Bring your men back home. Equipment
is cheap, lives are not.

2 castes - Workers/Warriors and Thinkers.
Workers are large, slow and tough. Thinkers are small, fast and weak.
When workers are in Warrior mode, they prefer large destructive
weapons. The don't really care who or what they destroy, as long as
they can break things. Much like the Berserker race of Altair 9.
