@{JCENTER}@{B}The Plot@{UB}@{JLEFT}

The most significant invention of this century is surely the
teleporter. No other device has had such an impact on society
and few can offer comparable opportunities. The man who finally
constructed the very first functioning teleporter after many
years of devoted study, was @{I}Dr.J.Johnson@{UI}.

Three weeks ago Dr.Johnson has been kidnapped by a widely unknown
terrorist organisation. We suspect that their aim is to use the
scientist's knowledge for their illegal operations. I certainly
don't need to go into details. We have to take steps to eliminate
the threat that is implicated by that recent turn of events.

We have located the complex in which Dr.Johnson is held captive.
Your task is to break into the building, free him, and guide him
back to the rendezvous to the west where a helicopter will pick
you up. You also have to take care that all data about the
teleporter, which is probably stored somewhere in their computer
systems, is deleted before you get out.

Over and out.
