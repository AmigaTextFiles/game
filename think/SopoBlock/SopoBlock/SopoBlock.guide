@node what "What it is"


 [  What it is  ]


   SopoBlock is a fun, simple, addictive, cute and fast paced puzzler
   that concentrates around removing different coloured blocks from
   the playfield.
   (Ooh, a completely new and innovative idea.)

   Read the @{"feature-list" LINK feat}, @{"gameplay-info" LINK game} and @{"FAQ" LINK faqu} for more info.

   Check the homepage for screenshots and other cool stuff:

   hardware, software or to your head. Use it at your own risk.

@node feat "Features"


 [  Features  ]


    - Realtime 3d gfx (Warp3D/MiniGL)

    - 16bit stereo sound (AHI)

    - Versions for both 68k and WarpOS

    - Highscore-list

    - Joystick support

@endnode
@node requ "Requirements"


  [  Requirements ]


    - Amiga with at least 68040 (PPC is supported via WarpOS) or compatible

    - Working Warp3D installation

    - Working AHI installation

    - Lucyplay.library by Oliver Gantert (version 4.0 included)

    In theory it should run on AmigaOS4, but it needs Warp3D.
    Please @{"inform" LINK cont} me if it works!

    The game should also run on other compatible platforms/under emulation
    with right setup (MorphOS, WinUAE).


@endnode
@node opti "Options"


  [ Options / usage ]


   The game can be started from icon, they are just simple scripts, open
   them to editor to modify the screen/window size or other options.

   You can also start the SopoBlock from shell, there are two executables,
   SopoBlock68k and SopoBlockwos, both have same options:

   @{b}-joy@{ub}           Activates the joystick support.

   @{b}-forcejoy@{ub}      If the initialization of joystic fails, try this option.

   @{b}-width xxx@{ub}     Width of the screen or window. (default: 640)

   @{b}-height yyy@{ub}    Height of the screen or window. (default: 480)

   @{b}-vsync@{ub}         Turns on the vsync.

   @{b}-window@{ub}        Run SopoBlock in a window.

   @{b}-15bit@{ub}
   @{b}-16bit@{ub}         15bit or 16bit screendepth. (default: 15bit)

   @{b}-triple@{ub}
   @{b}-double@{ub}        Double or triple buffering. (default: triple)

   Start the game from the same directory where the "dada"-directory is located,
   also some stack could be necessary.

@node game "Gameplay"


  [ Gameplay ]


   You can choose to play with three, four of five colors.
   With three colors the game is faster, but it's easier to remove the
   blocks. With more colors it's harder to get rid of the blocks, but the
   game is little slower and you get more points from removing the blocks.

   Move that greenish thingy around the playfield and pick up different coloured
   blocks and put them down so that 4 or more blocks of the same color touch
   each other, so that they will disappear. More blocks you remove in a single drop,
   more points you get.

   When carrying a block, you can only move in squares that are empty.

   If you don't move block in a some time it will become darker. After it's
   completely black, you can't pick it up anymore or even move over it.
   There are two ways to revive blocks before they go completely black, by
   picking them up or making block beside them disappear to "wake them up".

   You can also pick up a bomb, that will explode right after you drop it.
   When bomb explodes it will explode all other bombs and destroy all blocks
   (also completely darkened ones) within it's range.

   The game ends when the are too many darkened blocks in the playfield.
   There is an indicator that tells when that happens. Right below the score
   display there is a meter, when it's full, it's game over, man.
   Remember that by removing the darkened blocks with bombs, the meter goes down.

   (That sounded far too confusing. Try to play the game, it's much simplier
   than you might think after reading that mumbojambo...)

   To control the bat use joystick or keyboard.

   @{b}Keys:@{ub}

    @{b}esc@{ub}     - quit
    @{b}g@{ub}       - takes a screengrab
           (goes to ram: and is named "screenshotN.ppm", where N goes from 0 to up)

    @{b}8,4,6,2@{ub} - directions
    @{b}5, space@{ub}- picks up / puts down a block
    (Also joystick and direction-keys work)

@node faqu "FAQ"


  [ FAQ ]


Q: Joystick does not work!
A: Tried the -joy -option?

Q: It still does not work!
A: Try with -forcejoy -option.

Q: The screen flickers!
A: Try the -vsync -option.

Q: Why does the game crash?
A: Make sure the Warp3D works. (Do other Warp3D/MiniGL-programs work?)
   Make sure there is enough gfx-mem free.
   Increasing stack might also help(?)

   There really can be hundreds of reasons.

Q: Why is it so slow on my machine?
A: Make sure the Warp3D works.
   Make sure there is enough gfx-mem free.

   In a smaller screen/window it also runs faster.
   (Note also that fullscreen is faster that window.)

   The 68k version is slow on my machine (68040/25) when there are many
   blocks at the playfield.

Q: The game is too fast! What should I do?
A: There aren't anymore anything like the -delay -option, that
   was on previous games, because the game should now have a
   "maximum" speed. But if the game really is unplayably fast
   try to enable the vsynch with -vsynch -option, and if that does
   not help, contact me.

Q: There is a bug, only one sample plays at the time!
A: That's not a bug, at the moment Lucyplay doesn't support more channels.
   Maybe I should use AHI directly in the future...

Q: Why the gfx/sfx is crap?
A: Don't complain, it's free!

Q: What's with the name again? "SopoBlock"!?
A: Well, it didn't give any hits on Google.
   (Once again, "sopo" if a Finnish word with some dots removed.)

Q: Seems that this game (too) could have been just easily done in 2d?
A: Umm, next question please.

Q: What about version for AmigaOS4?
A: If this runs properly emulated, there no need. But possible future projects
   should have also OS4 native version, after OS4 comes out to BPPC or if I
   get A1 someday.

Q: What took you so long with this game?
A: This game has been basically ready since summer 2004, only some gfx and sfx
   were missing, but I was too busy to finish it before now.
   And I had to left out some good ideas to get the game done at all.
   (Sigh, just think about it: s***load of different bonuses, proper levels,
   camera angles, 3d effects, option to use more complex gfx, animated backgrounds,
   simultaneous two (or more!) player game etc...)

Q: And where is that WightFight, that was supposed to be ready "soon",
   about a year ago? When is it coming out?
A: Ahem, maybe never. The code is outdated, messy and buggy. And the game
   needs much more work to be playable.

Q: So, what are you doing next?
A: So many wonderful ideas, so little time (and motivation).
   Maybe I'll finish that damn WightFight. But I think I'll go on with that
   other project, called "Metallurgy", or AlyBox2 or better version of
   SopoBlock or something...

   But don't hold your breath, it might take quite long before anything comes
   out.

Q: Wow, I surely like what you are doing, is there anything I can do to help?
A: What are you waiting for? Send that feedback! Or donation!

   There was not really much game testing, so maybe there are few.
