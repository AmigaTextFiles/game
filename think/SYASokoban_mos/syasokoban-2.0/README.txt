ABOUT
-----

Sokoban was invented in Japan and the original program was
written by Hiroyuki Imabayashi. It is copyright (c) 1982
Thinking Rabbit Inc. Japan.

"Sokoban" means "warehouse keeper" in Japanese; the goal
of the game is to push all the crates into the designated
crate positions.

The levels provided are not my own, they are assembled
from various sources. The default 90 levels are public
domain.

You can add more sets of levels in the data/sokoban/levels
folder. The file must have the .txt extension. See existing
sets of levels for examples.

Please do not contact me to assist with solving individual
levels.
