About:
======

Pentago is a two player turn based strategy game. The goal is to get
5 marbles in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line before your oppnent
does. In each move the player places a marble (either black or white) on
a 6x6 gameboard and rotates one of the four 3x3 sub-boards clockwise or
counter clockwise by 90 degrees. If all 36 field are occupied without
a line, the game is a draw.
