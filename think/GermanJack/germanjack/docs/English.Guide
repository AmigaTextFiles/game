                             @{b}  Hi Everybody !  @{ub}

 At first i wanna say sorry for my fucking english.  So  don`t  wonder  that
 something will be difficult to understand what i mean.
 It`s my first game written in AMOS Pro.

 This Game is SHAREWARE. See the Details under this Point !

 The Version 2.0 ist now under Construktion. Its with better Graphic (simply
 and  only  in  IFF-Format too) and more Samples for a better Comment during
 the Game. But it cost more Ram. Also I will create a MoneyCounter,  so  the
 Game will become more Fun.
 Thanks to Helmut Dorner for his Bugreport and his critical  Comments.  I`ve
 forgot  to  turn on the Option "Compile with Amos.Lib" in the Compilermenu,
 so all Dudes they don`t have this Lib, can`t play this Game. Sorry for all,
 they have load this Game and started it unsuccessful.

                                  The Game

 You know this Game under the Name Black Jack, but its only with  32  Cards.
 Thats  makes  it faster and its realy the german Way to play this Game. The
 missing Cards are from 2 to 6. You got only the Cards from 7  to  the  Ace.
 For People they never play it befor here the Rules:
 You must come very closed to the Amount of 21 Points. If you  or  the  Bank
 (thats the Computer) mean its enough and take no more Cards, then the other
 one must try to reach more Points (but not more then 21 !).
 But remember, if you take no more Cards you got no second Chance to reach
 21, because you have finished the Game on this Way.
 The Bank win, if the Points are the same (as example you  got  18  and  the
 Bank to). So you must get every Time more than the Bank.
 Points over 21 lose.
 There is only one Exception: When the Game starts and the first 2 Cards are
 2 Aces. Thats called Fire. The Person with Fire is the Winner.
 For one Card more press with the left Mousebutton on the Cardstuck.
 Do you wish no more Cards, then you press on "Ready !".
 If you wanne quit, then you must press the right Mousebutton and  klick  in
 the Menu the Button "Quit".
 And now how much Points is which Card.

                                 Known Bugs

 If You have only 2 MB and you start the Intro and the Intro wanne start the
 Mainprogram  and  also you have all the Datas in the Ram and not on Disk or
 HD, so you will get an "Out of Memory"-Error. Erase  the  Intro-File  named
 "Jack" and start the hidden File named "German_Jack". Now you can play.
 Sometimes the Bank will not take another Card and you win. Thats realy  not
 a big Bug, so i dont change it.
 Wright me, if you got Problems with your Amiga. I have wroght this Programm
 on  a A1200 (sometimes with a Speedercard and sometimes without, because it
 was damaged). There was no Problems.

                               Do it better !
               
 The Cards are very ugly and it was a problem for me to get  this  with  the
 right  Colours. The Cards are found in the Drawer CARDS. Its in the typical
 ABK-Format of AMOS.
 In the April of 1996 I will  put  a  Converter  (named  "IFF-ABK-Conv"),  a
 Cardset in IFF-Format and a new and sexy Cardset (for our young Friends) in
 the Aminet (Game/Think -its already done). I have  used  the  Converter  to
 make my first Cardset a little bit better. Its absolutely easy to work with
 him. For a new Set  you  need  only  my  IFF-Cardset  (it  comes  with  the
 Converter)  and a Paint-Program like DPaint ore PPaint. After your creative
 working you use the Converter and oops its ready ! Save the  Cards  in  the
 Drawer CARDS and after starting the Game, you can load the new Cardset with
 the Point "Load Cards" in the Menu.
 Remeber: The best Success is to create Cards with  simple  Grafik,  because
 the  Resolution  is  not  good.  I`m  not  a good Painter, so I`ve take the
 Scanner.
 Please upload your Cardset in the Aminet if you can, because I  wanne  have
 some  Fun with your Cardset to. Also send me a Letter or a eMail, because I
 wanna everytime new Cards and by the way I can register you,  if  you  want
 it.
 Put it to Game/Think in the Aminet. Then you don`t must pay your Share !

 Also I wanne wright a Jump`n Run and a Adventure like Lucas-Arts-Adventure.
 You  can  wright  me every Time your Ideas. I will wright your Names in the
