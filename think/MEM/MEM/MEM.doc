INTRODUCTION:
        In MEM, you're an FBI agent.  Your primary job is to identify
the characteristics of the "thief" from your memory.  Each "thief" has
4 facial features: eye brows, eyes, nose, and mouth.

PROGRAM FILES:

        * MEM          
        * MEM.doc      
        * MEM.info

        It is important to start MEM in the same directory every
time.  When MEM starts, it will read the file "hiscores.mem" from
the CURRENT DIRECTORY to get the High Score Table, if it exists.  When
MEM exits, it will update the High Score Table in the CURRENT DIRECTRORY.
So, if you want MEM to keep your high scores in the SAME High Score Table,
make sure that you consistently starts MEM in the same directory.


PLAYING THE GAME:
        When you start MEM, you'll see an "Introduction" screen.
Click the left mouse button to go to the "Level Selection" screen.

        In the "Level Selection" screen, there are three buttons.
One button with the up-down arrow lets you select the level that
you desire.  Click on that button with the left button, and while holding
down the button, drag the mouse up or down to select your level (The level
number increases as you move the mouse up and vice versa). Release
the mouse button when you're done.  There are 6 levels in the current
version (1.0) of MEM.  Each higher level gets progressively
harder.  In level 1-3, you only have to memorize the characteristics
of one "thief".  In level 4-6, there are two "thieves".  When you
finish selecting your level, click on the 'OK' button to continue. 

        You are now ready see the "thief".  Click on the left mouse
button when you're ready.  A "thief" (or "thieves" if you are in level
4-6)  appears and disappears in a few seconds or a fraction of a
second depending on the selected level.  Notice that each "thief"
has a number at the lower left corner.  Make sure that you
match the correct "thief".

        You are now in the "main" screen.  This is where you try to
match the "thief" or "thieves".  On the top right corner of the screen,
there are four up-down buttons which let you change the characteristics
of the "thief" (or "thieves") to match the one that you saw.  To change,
click on one of the four up-down buttons (and the corresponding part number
to the left turns white), and while holding down the mouse
button, drag the mouse up or down to find the correct "part".  Release
the mouse button when you think you have the match.

        If there are two "thieves" on the screen, click on the thief
that you want to change.

        When you think that you've matched all the parts, press the
'Done' button.  If you got them all right, you'll be shown the next
"thief" of which there are five in each level.  If you did not get
them all, you have another chance to match the remaining parts.
Notice that after you press the 'Done' button, the part that matched
turns the corresponding gadget OFF.  That is, that button is "ghosted" and
any clicking on that gadget will have no effect.  If you can not match the
remaining parts after the second try, the correct parts will be shown in
white color and flipped back and forth between your "incorrect" parts.
Press the 'Done' button again to continue.

        When you are done with the level and your score qualify
for the High Score Table, MEM will ask for your name (maximum 10
letters).  Enter your name and press enter.

        In the "Main" screen, there are three buttons at the lower
left corner.  The 'New Game' button does what it says.  Click on it
and select a new level. The 'About' button shows you the
"Introduction" screen with the High Score Table.  The 'Quit'
button...need I say more?

        The bottom right corner of the screen shows you some status
and information of the game.  The 'Try' box is right below the 'Done'
button.  There are two numbers in the 'Try' box separated by a colon.
The number on the left tells you the number of "thieves" that you've
tried to match.  The number on the right is your current try to match
the current thief (You're allowed two tries for each thief, and there
are five thieves in each level...got it?).  The 'Level' box
shows the current level.  The 'Score' box shows your current score.
The 'Top Score' box shows the current highest score.


COMPATIBILITY:
        It should work with all versions of AmigaDOS (OS 1.1 to 2.1).

BUGS:
        There shouldn't be any bugs in this game.  But, if you "catch"
any, please let me know.
