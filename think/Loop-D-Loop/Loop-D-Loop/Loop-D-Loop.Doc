**  First of all, this archive now contains the Loop-D-Loop executable. **


  Well what can I say, Loop-D-Loop is a Blitz Basic 2 game that you can
play on your Amiga.

  Want more info?  Well it's a puzzle type game where you build loops
from the pieces you are given.  You can move and rotate the pieces until
you're happy with their placement on the grid.
  You must place each piece on the game grid before your time bar runs out,
if it does you will lose one of your lives which are displayed next to
the red time bar.
  When you complete a loop it disappears from the grid and you are given
points depending on its size and the level you're playing.  Each time you
complete twenty loops you go up a level, where time runs out quicker,
the pieces you are given are more varied, and there are more obstacles
on the grid.
  To complete the game you must get to level ten.  It's a bit harder than
it sounds.  If you find the earlier levels too easy you can choose your
starting level from the title screen.

The in-game controls are as follows:

  Mouse         - move the current piece around.
  Left button   - places the piece on the grid.
  Right button  - rotates the current piece clock-wise.

  Esc           - exits current game.
  Del           - pauses the game.
  Help          - toggles preview mode on/off.


  I think that's about all you need to know except for the following:

  This game should work on AGA machines, but to make sure it might be best
to boot in original chip set mode, and turn the cache off - having the cache
on tends to screw up the sound and music.

  Loop-D-Loop is harddisk installable, just drag it's drawer to where-ever
you want it.  If you have to run it from the Shell make sure to cd to the
Loop-D-Loop directory.

  * IMPORTANT * - make sure the disk you're running the game from is not
write-protected or else Loop-D-Loop will most likely crash on exit.


  And Finally,

    Loop-D-Loop is public domain, therefore you can give it to anyone,
include it on any magazine cover disks (yeah, right), place it in plain
brown paper bags and drop them from very tall buildings, or alter it if
you feel the urge.  I only ask that this file is included with it, and that
mine and Ben's name remain in the program, and that if either of the songs
are used in anything that Ben Ellis gets credit for composing the song.

Don't expect me to fix any bugs in this game, I've got better things to do.;-)

However if you ask me really nicely I might consider it.  I don't think
there are many, but who knows.  By the way, if when you exit the game your
Workbench pointer remains blank, try moving the invisiable mouse pointer to the
upper right of the screen and pressing the Back/Front gadget, it should work.

That's all for now kiddies,
Bye for now.
