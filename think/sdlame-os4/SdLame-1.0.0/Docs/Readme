The Makefile is used to create binaries for two systems. On the one hand
for your normal system (e.g. x86 / unix) and on the other hand for a GP2X
from Gamepark Holdings with an ARM9 / Linux System :) The Binarys are by 
default compiled for:
sdlame.pc -> x86 - UNIX - DIRS and SDL are needed (make pc)
sdlame.gpe -> GP2X - DIRS and Firmware 2.0 (or higher) are needed (make gp2x)
