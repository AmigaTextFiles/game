CRYPT 1.0 DOCS
______________



INTRO
_____

First off, this program is now released to the public domain.

I don't know of any other programs that do this for the Amiga.

It is a program I've thought about writing for a couple of years and

I finally got around to it.



WHAT IS CRYPT
_____________

This program will hopefully make it easy for you to create and solve

cryptoquotes.  They are in newspapers, game books, etc.  For those of

you who don't know what a cryptoquote is, I'll try to explain it.

It is a message that has been encrypted and you must de-crypt it to 

read it.  It uses all 26 letters of the alphabet and scrambles them.

luckily, it is constant.  If you change one letter in the message, you

change all the letters like it.  For example, if all T's in the quote:

"This is a test" were changed to P's, the quote would read: "Phis is a PesP".


HOW DO I OPERATE CRYPT?
_______________________


1.  First thing you need to do is make the assignment for the cryptfiles.

	ASSIGN CRYPTFILES: DH0:CRYPT/CRYPTFILES

				^
				or whereever you put them.


2.  There are menu options for Loading and Saving.  Loading will load a 

    Saved or included cryptoquote.  Save will save the crypt in the form

    Show in all the little boxes, not in the TEXT gadget.


3.  MAKE CRYPT is a menu option which makes it very easy for you to create

    your own crypts.  First you type in the quote to the text gadget and 

    hit enter.  Now choose MAKE CRYPT from the menu bar and save it.  


4.  To actually solve a loaded crypt, you may click on the letter you wish

    to change and type the letter you wish it changed to and hit enter. This

    will update all letters that were the same as the one you clicked on.


5.  The TEXT gadget may also be used to enter a crypoquote from the newspaper
   
    or game mags that have crypts in them.  Once you solve the puzzle, you

    can use the MAKE CRYPT option and save it on disk for someone else to 
 
    solve later.


Sorry for the DOCS, I know they aren't written very well.


Have fun, and drop me some mail if like, don't like, ideas?
