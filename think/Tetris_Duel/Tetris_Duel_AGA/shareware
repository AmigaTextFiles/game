*** INTRODUCTION ***
  
Thanks for taking a look at TETRIS DUEL, we hope you enjoy playing it. If you 
choose to keep playing the game please remember that this game IS Shareware and
that a small payment is due. You can find details about Shareware in the section
called *** SHAREWARE *** (surprising huh?) below.

TETRIS DUEL runs on any AGA Amiga (That's the A1200 and A4000, plus the CD 32 -
but we haven't had a chance to test that yet). It will *NOT* work on older 
machines. I would recommend NTSC owners to boot in PAL mode, as this is a
PAL game, and requires either PAL or DblPAL in your Devs:Monitors draw.

We've all played Tetris, we all got a bit addicted - well here's another version
to while away the hours. TETRIS DUEL offers some new features...

	1. Two Player War action, collecting more than two lines
	   in one go, sends them to your oponent! And destroys their current piece!
	2. Special Pieces hidden in squares, when a line with a special in is 
	   cleared, you get that special.
	3. 6 Different special in non-registered version, more in the registered
	   version.
	4. Enhanced playability.

*** GETTING STARTED ***

TETRIS DUEL is completely compatible with AmigaDOS 3.x and Workbench 3. You may
run it from the Workbench by clicking on the TETRIS DUEL icon. After a short
pause the game will load and run.

If you are lucky enough to own a multiscan monitor TETRIS DUEL will run in the
DblPAl mode, otherwise it will run in lo-res PAL.

You can install TETRIS DUEL onto hard disk by creating a new drawer in the
appropriate partition (Amiga N in Workbench, Makedir [DRAWERNAME]) and then
copying *ALL* the files in this archive into it. 

*** INSTRUCTIONS ***

Well it really is just like teris with a load of extras! In a two player game
get more than two lines in one go and the go to the other player. The specials
are explained in the information screen in the game, read the scrolly message
for full instructions.

Configuring The Game: 

	Pressing C from the title screen lets you re-define the keys and set the
	game up, multisyncs are automatically detected, so don't worry. One
	thing that might need explaining is the sliders. To the left and right
	of each is the character that moves the slider in that direction! Just
	try it, you'll see!

Read the scroll text on the title screen for more info. More in the registered 
version ;)

*** SHAREWARE ***

Shareware is a scheme in which if you find a program useful, or just like using
it you pay a reasonable amount to the authors of the program. If you don't like
the program just delete the files and everyone is happy.

TETRIS DUEL *IS* Shareware. You are currently in possession of a review version
of the of TETRIS DUEL, this is a slightly cut down version of the program. If 
you choose to register we will send you the registered version. This offers :

	1. Extra Secret Special (A real goodie!)
	2. Memory Caching
	3. Full Music Score
	4. Multiple Game Backdrops
	5. Player Stats and highscores

You like the sound of that....? Okay, you need to send us
£10 Pounds Sterling and a blank floppy, if you would be so kind!

	An apology ...

We can only accept Pounds Sterling, the banks charge far too much to convert 
other currencies into Pounds ... Ask in your local bank for the availability of
Pounds.

*** BUGS ***

We have been playing TETRIS DUEL for some time and we think we have killed most
of the bugs that are out there. If you think you have found a bug in the program
try to isolate the cause of the problem and let us know, (a contact address is 
at the bottom of this document), we would hope to fix any bugs that we can in
future releases of the program.

We know of the following bugs :

1:	Sometimes a square will not be drawn completely - you will see small
 	areas of black inside the blocks. We think this problem is caused by
	Blitz BASIC's GetaShape function, and we would hope that a fixed version
	of the function will be produced by Acid Software. If not the ace
	high programmer will work out a way to get round it for registered 
	owners!

*** DETAILS ***

TETRIS DUEL was programmed by Nigel Hughes using Acid Software's Blitz BASIC 2,
the graphics were drawn by Mike Richards in Electronic Art's Deluxe Paint IV AGA
and converted into Blitz shapes format using Nigel Hughes' SHAPEZ program (now 
available on an anonymous ftp site near you!!! (blatant plug eh?))

*** WHAT THE HELL IS FUNDAMENTAL? ***

We're a pair of people who think the Amiga games market needs a damn good shake
up. We're commited to the AGA Amiga and hope to release a number of games in the
near future that show just what the machine can do.

Above all we are comitted to playability. If it can look good, that is brilliant
but we just want to have fun. I know that there ARE a lot of you who agree with us
so why not try...
