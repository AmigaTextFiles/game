                           How To Play The Sun
                           -------------------


 CONTROLS

 Controller left/right = rotate planets
 Controller fire = shoot star
 Space Bar = rest
 Escape = quit game
 Cntrl-C = exit to workbench

 (When player 2 is using the Keyboard then use cursors left/right and up)


 GAMEPLAY 1 - The Standard Game

 Imagine a SUN surrounded by 8 PLANETS. You can rotate them around their
 orbits using your controller.

 Each PLANET is represented by one of 8 icons or GLYPHS. The GLYPH of a
 planet is cycled by shooting a STAR at it.

 The GLYPHS are, in cycle order:

 HAND >  KIDS  >  CAT   > DOG > STAR > RABBIT > U.F.O. > EMU

 As this is going on the SUN is sinking. If it SETS its game over.

 In the top right corner is a TARGET GLYPH. When you hit a PLANET with
 the same GLYPH as this TARGET the following occurs:

 1. If ALL the PLANETS are the TARGET you've got a MATCH & the SUN rises
    to its original hieght.
 2. If only SOME are the TARGET the SUN rises a bit for each one the same.
 3. All the PLANETS with the TARGET GLYPH are now replaced with new random
    GLYPHS.

 SO your objective is this:

 Get as many MATCHES as you can and/or beat your high score while trying to
 stop the SUN from setting.

 What could be easier?

 HOWEVER

 * The PLANETS attack the SUN! If they touch it they drag it down towards
   SUNSET. Shooting them repels them (and also cycles the GLYPHS).
 * Every 8000 points the SPEED of the planets attack increases.

 ALSO

 Every now and again one of the PLANETS will flash and become animate.
 This is now a WILD GLYPH.

 The WILD GLYPH is similar to the TARGET. Hit the WILD GLYPH and ALL the
 PLANETS with the same GLYPH as it will change to a new SAME random GLYPH.

 The SUN DOES NOT rise and it will change the GLYPHS EVEN IF IT IS A TARGET.

 SCORING

 * You get 10 points for every PLANET hit.
 * When you hit a TARGET or a WILD GLYPH you get 20 points.
 * This is doubled for each extra like glyph, so you get 40 for two and 80
   for three up to 2560 for all eight the same.
 * You also get an extra 1000 points for each MATCH.


                                    ***


 GAMEPLAY 2 - The Bar Vault

 In this game the previous rules and scoring still apply.

 However, instead of seeing how many MATCHES you can get, you must try and
 get the SUN past the VAULT BAR.

 Hit the TARGET GLYPHS to make the SUN rise and meet the BAR without letting
 it SET.

 Reach the bar and the SPEED will increase.


                                   ***


 GAMEPLAY 3 - Bar Vault Battle

 As before, but TWO players participate.

 The players take alternate turns to hit their respective TARGET GLYPHS
 and reach the BAR.

 The first to reach the BAR wins a game (a light comes on with each game won).

 If the SUN sets on your go the other player wins a game.

 The first player to win FOUR games wins the match.

 * Its up to you whether to try to get to the bar or scupper your opponent
   by changing their GLYPHS.
 * Remember, the closer you get to the BAR, the shorter each players turn is.
 * The COMPUTER player doesn't care about winning, just so long as you loose.

                                   ***


                             - AND THATS IT -
