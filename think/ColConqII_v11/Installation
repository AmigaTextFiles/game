     Installation
     
     
     HARDDISK:
     1) Copy all the files in  one  directory  anywhere  on  your
     harddisk. In contrast  to  the  first  version,  it  is  not
     necessary to make any assignments for Colonial Conquest II.
     2) Copy the "game" font to your "fonts:" directory and  make
     sure you have the "diskfont" and the "mathtrans" library  in
     your "libs:" directory.
     3) Of course, you will not need  the  following  directories
     included in the CCII archive anymore: s, l, font, devs. Just
     delete them.
     4) Now you can start CCII by clicking on its icon.
     
     
     FLOPPY DISK:
     1) Copy all files on one disk, make a "C" directory and copy
     the following commands into it: "Run" and "Endcli"
     2) Make a "libs" directory and copy the "diskfont"  and  the
     "mathtrans" library into it.
     (The mentioned files can be found on your Workbench disk)
     3) Install the disk (type "install df0:" from  your  CLI  if
     the disk is in drive DF0:).
