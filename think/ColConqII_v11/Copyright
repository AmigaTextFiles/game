     COPYRIGHT
     
     
     I keep all rights on Colonial Conquest II. You  are  however
     allowed to copy it to other people as long as you  copy  all
     files (including this "Copyright"-file!) with it  and  don't
     ask more than a nominal fee of 4$  (or  it's  equivalent  in
     another currency) for the disk. Fred Fish, to whom this game
     was originally sent is EXCEPTED from  this  restriction  and
     may therefore  ask  more  money  for  the  copying  of  this
     program.
     Colonial Conquest II can be put  on  any  CD  PD-compilation
     provided the price of the whole CD is not more than  30$  or
     it's equivalent in another  currency.  The  only  exceptions
     from this rule are FRED FISH CDs and the AMINET CD.
     
     
     If you are managing another Public Domain  series,  you  are
     invited to take Colonial Conquest II on it too, but I  would
     be very grateful if you could inform me and send me  a  copy
     of the disk you have put Colonial  Conquest  II  on.  Please
     notice that you are bound to the above restrictions! If  you
     want to be excepted from them for some reason, you will have
     to ask a written permission from me!
     
     
     If you wish to translate the manual into  another  language,
     you should inform me first so that I could take it over into
     a future version of Colonial Conquest II.  You  are  however
     NOT allowed to sell Colonial Conquest II for more  than  the
     4$ mentioned above, even if you  have  written  a  200  page
     manual!!! (I write this because some people in Germany  have
     started to make money with PD by  writing  short  and  cheap
     manual-translations and selling the discs  at  prices  above
     $10!)
     
     
     Colonial Conquest II is giftware. I have hesitated for quite
     a long time to make it shareware, but as I am  the  kind  of
     guy who is too lazy to pay something for shareware  most  of
     the time (shame on me!) and because I don't like the feeling
     of being (morally) forced to pay for  something,  I  finally
     decided to ask for a donation (nice  word  for  payment,  as
     Dave Smith said before!) of 10 Sfr or 10 DM (7$, 5£ etc)  if
     you like the game and play it and therefore  would  like  to
     see it improved.
     Now, I really want to make clear that you  should  not  feel
     forced in any way! I would even say: If you  like  the  game
     but don't feel very rich, just write  me  a  letter  without
     money and I will be very happy anyway. The thing is that I'm
     currently making my Ph.D. (=underpaid, overworked guy!)  and
     therefore am not the kind of guy who sends  1000$-checks  to
     giftware programmers. (Though I wouldn't  prevent  you  from
     doing so, really!). By the way: don't send checks -  I  mean
     checks with small money amounts - as it usually  takes  more
     money to cash them in than they are amounted to!
     Of course, you will get a nice  letter  in  return  of  your
     money, saying thank you in 23 languages (and  a  little  bit
     more, of course!).
     I even would like to say a big THANK YOU here already to the
     incredible five or six persons (out of the 12'567  who  will
     play my game) who will make the effort to send me the money!
     Thank you, thank you, thank you...
     
     
     
     If you are writer of any magazine or fanclub-paper and  want
     to write about Colonial Conquest II,  please  feel  free  to
     contact me for questions. I would also be interested in  all
     forms of cooperation. (Release of the 2nd version on a  disk
     magazine, German version of Colonial Conquest and so on...)
     
     
     If you have programed a game too, I would also be interested
     in your work and experience with Public Domain!
     
     
     Send your comments, your wishes  for  a  2nd  release,  your
     bombs (if the program has crashed for cryptic reasons!)  and
     of  course  your   (unneeded,   unnecessary,   nonessential,
     superfluous) money to:
