 This cardset is @{bold "'Free-As-A-Bird-Ware'"}.  You don't need to send money, gifts
  or anything else (but if you really want to ...).  But I would be glad if
         you send @{"me" link "contact" 0} an e-mail or a postcard if you like this cardset.

@node requirements
@title "Requirements"

 For  this  cardset  -  due  to  its colour-depth (24bit) - a graphic board with
 CyberGraphX  is recommended (eg.  CyberVision64/3D, Picasso II, Retina, Piccolo
 etc.).

 Due  to  the  size  of  cards  also  a screen resolution of 800 x 600 is highly
 recommended  ...    in  other  words ...  i don't even know wether or not it is
 possible to play this cardset on a smaller screen (...  to lazy to test ...).

 I recommend a registered version of CyberGraphX since the unregistered  version
 doesn't support 24 bit screenmodes.

@node install
@title "How to install??"

 hand" 8-).  Otherwise wait for an installer script.

@node history
@title "History"


 @{bold "February 1995"}
 
 Initial release for Klondike Deluxe AGA (III) by REKO Productions.

 @{bold "1996"}
 
 Internal  conversion  for CyberPatience.  Never released.  CyberPatience seemed
 to  be  a  day  fly.  And so it was ...  sad but true.  No known version higher
 than v1.02.

 @{bold "March 1997"}
 
 Converted  to  the  'Soliton' cardset format, which luckily doesn't differ that
 much  to  the  Klondike  cardset  format (...  thanks Kai ...  it took about 10
 minutes).

@title "Credits"

 @{uline "ChaosPro - Martin Pfingstl:"}

 All  fractal-pictures  used in this cardset were rendered in 24Bit with the un-
 believable ChaosPro by Martin Pfingstl (...  what the hell is FractInt) back in
 1995.

 @{uline "ArtEffect (PicoPainter) - Alexander Pratsch (Haage & Partner GmbH):"}
 
 The  initial  cardset  was made totally in 24bit back in 1995 using PicoPainter
 and  adapted  to 'Soliton' in 1997 using - among other things (eg.  Photogenics
 2a) - ArtEffect v1.5X.

 I'm still waiting for release version 2.x of ArtEffect, which will hopefully be
 more useful.  Using PicoPainter on EGS back in 1995 seemed a lot more efficient
 to me.

 ...

 @{uline "Soliton - Kai Nickel:"}

 ...    thanks  a  lot, Kai, for this marvelous card game.  It's a real pleasure
 playing  'Soliton'  on  eg.    a  16bit  MUI screen and even on my 8bit 800x600
 workbench.

 It  would  be  great  to  have the ability of playing modules in the background
 and/or playing samples eg.  when turning or dropping cards.
 
 The  idea  of  having  several  configurations  available  by pressing eg.  the
 function keys wasn't that bad (...  Klondike AGA like).

 ...
