@node "INTRO" "Introduction"

Mental Blokz is a puzzle game where you have to push the diamonds through
the exit arrow. When moving, the whole row or column you are on moves to
and the blokz on the end scroll round to the other side. The best way to
see what I mean is to play it!

See @{"How to Play" Link "PLAY"}

@endnode

@node "INSTALL" "Installation"

Installation is done by copying the entire Blokz Drawer to anywhere on your
destination volume. If you don't already have Thinpaz font then you'll need
to copy it to FONTS: (it can be found in the blokz:fonts/ drawer).
Clicking on the Blokz icon from Workbench will automatically add the assign
if you don't wish to copy the font.

If you wish to start the game from the cli then you'll have to make an
assign first:

assign blokz: <path>

This is automatically taken care of when you double click on the icon so
there's no need to put the assign in your startup-sequence.

@Endnode

@node "REQUIREMENTS" "Requirements"

Blokz needs the following on your system:

	· diskfont.library
	· Thinpaz font
	· About 1 Mb

I think that's it. :)

@Node "PLAY" "How to Play"

Blokz is played on a grid of 10x10 squares or 'Blokz' :)
When you move, the whole row moves too and the blokz wrap around to the
other side of the board. To complete each level you have to push all the
diamonds through the exit arrow in the given time. Simple eh?
The time limit can sometimes be tight, but what's the point of a game if
it's too easy? ;)

@{"    Special Blokz    " SYSTEM "run >nil: multiview blokzhelp.iff"} <-Click here for picture.

Gold: Acts in the same way as diamonds (Can be pushed through exit arrow)
but they can't be pushed off the edge of the board (like ice). You need to
get all the gold in the exit to complete a level, too.

Ice: Cannot be pushed off the side of the board. (It gets in the way)

Lava (Red Blokz): Cannot be moved : Stops the whole row and column from
moving.

Mystery (Question mark): Aha! Push em through the exit for a bonus, penalty
or mystery effect :)

Extra Time (Clock): Adds a few seconds to your time left.

Extra Points(Cherries): Gives you score (Not essential to completion
of a level)

Diamonds->Gold: Changes all Diamonds to gold blokz.

Gold->Diamonds: Changes all gold blokz to diamonds.

Lava->Ice: Changes all Lava blokz into Ice.

Minus Score (Fish): Avoid pushing into exit (if you can).

One Way arrows: The whole row/column can only be pushed in one direction.
Can only move in the direction of the arrow.


Each level has its own level code so you can easily go back to the last
level you were on.

@{"    Controls:    " SYSTEM "run >nil: multiview screenhelp.iff"}

I recommend you use the keyboard to control the game but you can also use
joystick.

Keys:
	Q: Up            \
	A: Down          |
	O: Left          |- Generic Spectrum game keys :-)
	P: Right         |
	Space: Pause     /

On some levels (ones with one way arrows) you can get completely stuck :)
so you might need to use:
	Z: Try again.

Joystick:
	Push in any direction to move one space. You have to let go of
(centre) the joystick before you can move again. Or you can hold down fire
for continuous movement.

Pressing Space to pause the game will bring up the Blokz Command Shell :)
This is used to type in various useful functions to control the game.
Commands you can use (ie the non-cheating commands :) are:

QUIT - Lose all lives.
RESUME - Um, un-pause. Same as pressing space.
MUSIC - Turns off the Pause Music, in case you want to leave the computer
and you don't want it to drive you insane.
NOSFX - Turns the SFX off.
SFX - Turns the SFX on.
EDIT - @{"Edit the level" link "LEVED"} (In User-level Mode Only)

Quitting (Should you want to ;)
Press Ctrl-C anywhere, or go to QUIT in the main menu.

@node LEVED "Editing levels"

Controlling the level editor is quite simple.

Use the keys Q,A,O,P to move the editing box.
Use the arrow/cursor keys to move the silver arrow.
When the arrow is on the left. Press Up and Down arrows to cycle through
the available "Blokz". Press Space/Enter to place the block on the current
square.
When the arrow is on the right. Press Enter or Space on the time parameter
to change the amount of time available to complete the level. Use the left
and right arrow keys to increase or decrease the amount and press
Enter/Space when finished.
Pressing enter or space on the other parameter lets you choose from a menu
of options, use left or right arrows to cycle through them. Options are:
LOAD, SAVE : Self explanitory.
PLYR : Positions the levels player starting position on the current space
(hi-lited with the box)
INFO : Tells you which level you are editing.
Press Escape to exit this menu without doing anything.

Pressing Escape when no menu is activated quits the editor.
