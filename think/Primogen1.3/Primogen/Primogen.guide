Introduction
@{UB}@{UU}

Primogen is a tool to help players of the game @{"Jyhad" link Jyhad}.
Primogen  will  help  you  to  keep  track  of  your  favourite Crypts, but more
importanty Primogen will provide valuable statistical and analytical information
about your Crypt.

This  will  help  you  to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of your
crypt  and  thus  help  you to select a more appropriate library.  Primogen will
also  provide  immediate realtime feedback on the effect the addition or removal
of  any  vampires  have on your crypt.

Primogen is Shareware.  Please support the continued development of Primogen and
my bank account by @{"registering" link registering}.

If you do not play Jyhad then you should.

If  you  still  don't play Jyhad, well, then will probably not find this program
useful for anything.  Do feel free to try however.  :)

@NODE Jyhad " What is Jyhad?  "
@{B}@{U}
Overview of Jyhad - An excerpt from the Jyhad rules.  
@{UB}@{UU}

"Jyhad  is  a  collectable  trading card game requiring about 3 hours of playing
time.  In Jyhad two or more players take on the roles of ancient vampires, known
as Methuselahs, engaged in an age-old political battle.  So great and subtle are
the  Methuselahs  that  they are considered mere legend by the younger vampires.
These  younger  vampires think they are pursuing their own ends even as they are
being  used  by  one  Methuselah  to  undercut  the  power base of another.  The
Motivations  for  the  war between the Methuselahs are lost in the sands of dead
civilizations.   Perhaps  the Methuselahs are vying for world conquest.  Perhaps
they  work  under  the  influence of yet older vampires, believing as naively in
their autonomy as do the vampires they control."

Jyhad is based on White Wolf's game @{B}Vampire:The Masquerade.@{UB}

Jyhad is produced by Wizards of the Coast, and is a Trademark of Wizards of the
Coast and White Wolf.  Jyhad was designed by Richard Garfield.

This window contains a number of gadgets.  To be precise it contains 2
@{"listviews" link listview}, 14 button gadgets, a closewindow gadget and a depth gadget.

The closewindow gadget and depth gadget of course do what you would expect them
to do.  If you don't know what to expect them to do I suggest you read your
Amiga documentation, ask a friend or maybe just give it up right now.

An Amigaguide representation of the available gadgets is given below.  Click on

Overview
@{UB}@{UU}
The purpose of the main window is to allow you to select vampires from your
storage area and place them in your Crypt.  A statistical analysis of these
vampires will appear in the @{"Evaluation Window" link evalwindow}.

Vampires can be moved to your Crypt by pressing @{"->Crypt" link Crypt}.  The evaluation
window can be toggled on and off by pressing @{"Evaluate" link evaluate}.

These 2 buttons, you MUST understand in order to use Primogen.  Detailed
descriptions of all of the buttons are available by clicking above.

@ENDNODE

@NODE theCrypt "The Crypt"
@{B}@{U}
The Crypt (Main Window)
@{UB}@{UU}

This @{"Listview" link listview} is your crypt.  It contains all the vampires, you've moved into it
from the @{"Available Vampires" link availablevampires} Storage area with the @{"->Crypt" link Crypt} button.

You can remove vampires from the Crypt by pressing the @{"Remove" link remove} button on the main
window.  The most important button is the @{"Evaluate" link evaluate} button.  It will toggle on
and off the @{"Evaluate Window" link evalwindow} which gives you statistical information about your
crypt.

@ENDNODE
@NODE availablevampires "The Storage Area"
@{B}@{U}
The Storage Area (Main Window)
@{UB}@{UU}

This @{"Listview" link listview} is your Storage Area.  It contains all the available vampires
which can be added to your crypt. If you own any vampires which are not already
included in this listview you can add them in with the @{"Add" link VAdd} button.  It would be
appreciated (if you can) to contact the @{"author" link theauthor} and give him a description of the
missing vampires so that other users will not also need to add them in manually.

@ENDNODE
@Node Crypt " Adding to the Crypt"
@NEXT remove
@{B}@{U}
->Crypt Button (Main Window)
@{UB}@{UU}

This button allows you to add vampires to your @{"Crypt" link thecrypt}.  The
selected vampire in your @{"Storage Area" link availablevampires} will be added to your crypt.
It is legal to have @{"duplicate vampires" link dupvamp} in your crypt, but be careful as 
the current version of Primogen does not yet take into consideration this
tactics full effects.

@ENDNODE

@NODE dupvamp "Duplicate Vampires in the Crypt"
@{B}@{U}
Using Duplicate Vampires in The Crypt
@{UB}@{UU}

This tactis is strongly discouraged, and it should be warned that the currently
Primogen does not accuratly reflect the effects of duplicate vampires in your
crypt.

This tactic  will generally have the following effects.
    - loss of Crypt Speed
    - Increase in Control
    - Decreasing the purity of most disciplines while having minimal if any
      positive effect on the disciplines the duplicate vampires possess.

The only real reason for using this tactic is to increase the probability that
you will be able to get a certain vampire into play.  However there are
drawbacks.  You run the risk of drawing duplicate (and hence useless) vampires
from your crypt.  An additional risk is that if someone puts a vampire (that you
have duplicates of in your deck) into play, a significant portion of your crypt
will become contested.

Putting duplicates of the same vampire in your crypt is generally a bad tactic
and is strongly discouraged.

The current version of Primogen treats all vampires as unique so will give you
misleading results if you include duplicate vampires in your crypt.  A future
version of Primogen will take these considerations into mind.

  Gadget        Description
  ~~~~~~        ~~~~~~~~~~~
  Name          This string gadget allows the entry of a vampire's name.
                You click on this gadget and then type it in.

  Generation    This integer gadget allows the entry of the vampire's generation.

  Clan          This cycle gadget allows the entry of a vampire's clan.
                The default is Brujah.  To change this, click on the gadget
                repeatedly until it cycles over to the desired clan.

  Animalism
      ...       These cycle gadgets represent the status of the disciplines.
  Thaumaturgy   By default the vampire has a rating of 'None' in each discipline,
                however, by clicking on these gadgets, the status of any
                particular discipline can be cycled through the 3 available
                ratings 'None', 'Standard' and 'Superior'.

                For a description of how to tell what a standard or superior
                discipline is consult your @{"Jyhad" link jyhad} rules.


  Accept        This gadget indicates to Primogen you are satisfied with the
                changes you have made.  This window will close and you will be
                returned to the @{"Main Window" link mainwindow}.  If you were adding a
                new vampire it can now be found in your Storage Area.  If you
                were editing an old vampire, it will be be modified to represent
                the new information.

  Merits/Flaws  Pressing this button will open the @{"Merit/Flaw window" link mflawwindow}.

  Cancel        Pressing this button will close the Design/Edit window (losing
                all changes) and return you to the @{"Main Window" link mainwindow}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Mflawwindow " Merit/Flaw Window "
@{B}@{U}
The Merit/Flaw Window
@{UB}@{UU}

This window is used to modify a vampire's merits and flaws.  In Jyhad these are
given as the text of a vampire card.

It was necessary to come up with possible effects these special abilities would
have on the game, and this lead me to devise 8 different @{"strategies" link strategies} for winning
the game.  Every discipline and every special ability has an effect on these
strategies, making them easier or more difficult paths to victory.

As there is a finite number of permutations of disciplines, it was possible to
devise a simple algorithm  to calculate the disciplines' effect on the 8
strategies.  However there are theoretically an infinite number of different 
special abilities, and as such there is no deterministic way of calculating an
arbitrary special ability's effect.

This being the case, it has been left to the human user to determine the effect
any special ability might have on gameplay.

I have already entered each vampire that I own into the database, along with my
estimation of that vampire's special abilities' effects on the strategies.  Each
strategy has a rating from -2 to 5.

A rating of 0 is normal.  Negative ratings are refered to as flaws and positive
ratings are merits.  There are a few hard fast rules, I've devised which will
cover a great many vampires.  These are given in the description of the relevent
@{"strategy" link strategies}.

@ENDNODE


@Node STRATEgies " The Strategies"
@{B}@{U}
The Strategies
@{UB}@{UU}

The 8 Strategies along with any special rules follow:

@{B}@{U}
Offensive
@{UB}@{UU}
This deck is specialized in offensive combat, or at bleeding the opponent.  The
idea is to put as many of your opponents vampires into torpor as possible, by
multiple damage points or agravated damage, and then hit your opponents pool
with multiple bleeds.

Special abilities which give +1 to offensive include:
            - +1 hand damage
            - 2 hand damage
            - +1 Bleed
            - hand damage is treated as agravated
            - pay 1 blood to gain 1 maneuver

@{B}@{U}
Defensive
@{UB}@{UU}
This deck is strong in keeping its minions out of torpor.  Your opponent can't
bleed you if she spends all her efforts just hurting your minions.  Aggravated
damage doesn't scare you because it is easily soaked.  And when your opponent
does manage to bleed you, it doesn't matter because you've always got a card to
reduce bleed handy.

Special abilities include:
            - spend 1 blood to gain 1 dodge
            - change aggravated damage to normal
            - Don't need to tap to block vampires of 3rd gen or less (+2 bonus)

@{B}@{U}
Stealth
@{UB}@{UU}
This deck is strong at doing things without being blocked.  If you opponent
can't get you into a fight, then you dont need to be good at it.  However keep
in mind that occasionally you will need to block an opponent's minions, and
stealth is completely useless for this.

Special abilities include:
            - +1 stealth for any 1 type of action
            - +1 stealth for ALL actions (+2 stealth bonus)


@{B}@{U}
Detection
@{UB}@{UU}
This is the opposite of stealth.  It helps you to prevent your opponent from
taking actions which might otherwise go unblocked.  Detection abilities are
ALWAYS useful.  Many of the more fundamental actions a minion might take, take
place at +1 stealth.  If you can get a +1 intercept bonus, you could for example
block a hungry vampire from feeding (probably sending it into torpor in the
process).  Stop a political action before it starts.  A deck that is strong in
Combat and Detection is a frightening prospect indeed.

Special abilities include:
            - +1 intercept against any 1 type of action or minion.
            - +1 intercept for ALL actions (+2 detection bonus)

@{B}@{U}
Political
@{UB}@{UU}
A political deck should have many political action cards, and if possible
vampires with votes.  Political actions can be used effectively to achieve
almost any game effect.  They can allow you to exert more control over the game.

Special abilities include:
            - Primogen (+1 bonus)
            - Prince   (+2 bonus)
            - Justicar (+3 bonus)

@{B}@{U}
Speed
@{UB}@{UU}
A speed deck has many small vampires, and few large ones.  It relies on
overwhelming your opponent by the sheer number of minions you might throw at
him.
Special abilities include:
            - any ability to put blood on uncontrolled vampires.
            - any ability to increase the size of your hand
            - any ability to discard cards.

@{B}@{U}
Control
@{UB}@{UU}
A control deck is one which allows the methuselah alot of choices over what
happens in the game, and allows the methuselah to deny those choices to others.
A deck with a high control rating will tend to cause your opponent to lose
control of his deck and vice versa.

Special abilities include:
            - any vampires which can take an action which would be illegal
              otherwise. i.e. act out of turn, attack another minion, give blood
              to another controlled minion.
            - any power that help the controller to win contested cards.
            - any power which will deny another kind of vampire a certain kind
              of freedom. i.e.

Control powers are +1 when they only apply to a certain kind of vampire (based
on clan or generation typically).  They are usually +2 when they apply to
everyone.

@{B}@{U}
Knowledge
@{UB}@{UU}
A knowledge deck allows you to have more information, and thus make better
decisions when playing Jyhad.  Methuselahs with a high knowledge rating tend to
know everything, about everyone (at least as far as the game goes).

Special abilities include:
            - any that let you look at cards which you would not otherwise be
              allowed to look at.

    Quality:        A special weighted total which adds extra emphasis on very
                    high or very low ratings.  This is not an average.  But a
                    calculation of the general quality of disciplines in your
                    crypt.  A deck with many different disciplines will tend to
                    score low here.  A deck with only a few disciplines will
                    tend to score high.  This reflects the reality that a deck
                    which is very strong in a few disciplines has better 
                    chances of succeeding than a deck which is 'average' in 
                    many.  The same rule applies to strategy strengths.

    Strength:       A special weighted total strength of the strategies.  This
                    is not an average, but a calculated final strength which
                    should hold, provided you design your library while keeping
                    your strengths and weaknesses in mind.

                    Typically only choose cards which help your best strengths.
                    Trying to compensate for your crypts weaknesses in your
                    library will most likely result in a fruitless up-hill
                    battle.  The secret to winning at Jyhad is to face your
                    enemy on your own terms, using your best weapons.
                    The same rule applies to disciplines.


@{B}@{U}Strategy Strengths Chart@{UB}@{UU}

This chart shows the calculated strengths of each strategy type based on both
vampire special abilities and the particular strengths and qualities of
disciplines which affect those strategies.  Speed is mostly affected by the
average generation of the vampires in the crypt compared to the 'typical' crypt.

Each other strategy is affected by some combination of discipline and their 
respective quality ratings as well as other factors.  The exact algorithm used
is beyond the scope of this document (for now).

@{B}@{U}Discipline Strengths Chart@{UB}@{UU}

This chart shows the frequency of each discipline in your crypt.

The Weighted column shows a weighted frequency, which values Superior 
disciplines higher than standard disciplines.

The Standard column shows the number of vampires with the discipline at Standard
rating divided by the total number of vampires.

The Superior column shows the number of vampires with the discipline at superior
rating divided by the total number of vampires.

The Quality column shows a special calculated total, which takes into account
the generation of the individual vampires which possess the discipline in
question as well as such issues as Superior and Standard Frequencies, and
weights.  It is this column that gives you the most meaningful information on
the true strengths of the various disciplines in your deck.  In general practice
this is the ONLY column I look at when determining which disciplines to
emphasize in my library.

@{B}
             @{U}Jyhad: If You think its like Magic.  Think Again.@{UU}
                              by David Zvekic
@{UB}
Jyhad is without a doubt one of the most sophisticated tradable card games
on the market.  It requires both wit and careful planning in order to play
a strong and consistent game.

The Jyhad is an ancient and secret war, between the most ancient and
powerful of vampires, the methuselahs.  It is fought for reasons, that are
known only to the methuselahs, by soldiers who often do not even know that
they are all mere pawns, manipulated by these ancient vampires in the
Jyhad.

In the game Jyhad the players play the role of Methuselahs.  As you might
expect their out to win the Jyhad.

Many new players find it tempting to compare Jyhad to another game
'Magic:The Gathering' (henceforth referred to as MTG).  In doing so they
fall into a common trap.  They design an MTG deck using Jyhad cards.

In Jyhad, new cards are drawn from the library as fast as you can play
them, much unlike MTG where only a single new card is drawn each turn.  In
addition there are no killer card combinations in Jyhad.  Not often is a
Jyhad game played, where victory can easily be traced to a single card or 2
that turned the tides of battle.  Victory can only achieved through a
steady and relentless onslaught.  Drawing and playing many cards in a
single turn.  With that in mind, it is likewise very important to keep your
opponent on the defensive.

Here are some tips I have for those finding it difficult to play a strong
game.

Don't let your prey get the Edge.

If your prey has the Edge, he'll only become more and more powerful while
your blood pool diminishes.  Get it away from him.  Even when you know
he'll only take it back again, it is still better than letting him gain the
extra pool each turn.  If you're lucky he'll be succumb to the same
defeatist attitude, that you're only going to take the Edge back from him
and he'll let you keep it.  Keep lots of 'Computer Hacking' cards around.
These cards are one of the most useful in the game.  You spend them like
there's no tommorow, and they immedietly get replaced.  If only 1 in 5 go
unblocked thats 1 extra point of bleed that didn't cost you anything.

Don't save, discard!.

While in MTG, discarding is a scary thing, in Jyhad discarding is good for
you.  Discarding lets you replace your least useful card with something
that is probably better.  You should take advantage of your discard phase
the moment you have a card you don't see yourself being able to use within
the next turn or 2.  Likewise, don't be cheap with the extra bleed cards,
extra damage, or damage prevention cards.  Use them, even when your
vampires have plenty of blood left and you believe they can soak the
damage.  You'll get more, and if the card you draw to replace them with
isn't useful in this fight, it will be useful outside of combat.

Wake with Evening's Freshness

Put a few 'Wake with Evening's Freshness', or 'Rats Warning' cards in your
deck and use them.  Put many in fact.  If your predator believes that you
have these ready, he may think twice about assuming you can't defend
yourself.  Moreover if you have many of these, you might be able to take
the Edge knowing that you can still respond to bleeds attempts afterwards.
'Cat's Guidance' is also useful for keeping your blockers available.

Act with a Purpose.

Design your deck with a specific purpose and keep to it.  If your deck is
designed for high damage in combat, then stick to this.  Take only those
cards that let you put your enemies minion's into torpor.  Do not be
tempted to make a deck that can handle any situation.  If you keep in mind
that winning the game requires many turns of continual pressure, you will
see that it is not important to be able to deal with every kind of threat.
If your deck is poor politically, then put your opponents Primogen's and
Princes into torpor to balance the playing field.  Even better, be on your
prey's case so hard that he doesn't call a vote for fear of letting you
slip in a multi point bleed when he leaves too many minions tapped.

If your deck is a political deck, then vote your prey to death.  Commit
diablerie often and with vigour, as you can probably overturn any calls for
a blood hunt.  Don't miss the opportunity to take your opponents minions
right out of the game.  Use 'Political Backlash' to punish any that try to
call a Blood Hunt.  Keep in mind that you can't play Reaction cards during
your turn so this tactic only works if you diablerize during someone elses.
Amaranth is useful for this, as is any card that will let you intercept a
vampire trying to recover from torpor.

With a political deck you can also let people bleed you, and then get
revenge with 'Domain Challenge'.  Finally always remember that Political
Action cards can also be used as votes, and that you'll get replacements
soon enough so spend, spend, spend!

Try to concentrate on only a few disciplines.  This way you'll always be
able to play the cards you've got in your hand.  Also don't underestimate
'Master:Skill' cards.  They make a huge difference, in a well designed deck
with only a few disciplines.

Speed

In Jyhad your cards are typically replaced immedietly.  The consequence of
this is that you want to be able to use all of your cards as soon as you
draw them.  If a card isn't immedietly useful, discard it, and think twice
about even including it in your library in the future.

Another note on speed.  Cheap vampires, are better than expensive ones.  In
my crypt over 1/2 of my vampires are 2nd generation or LESS!  If you don't
have enough minions in play, then your entire game suffers.  Your deck
plays slower and you'll lose the Edge.  If most of your vampires are small
and cheap, you'll naturally work your way through your crypt and get at the
powerhouses soon enough.  With 'Master:Skill' cards your cheap vampires can
use the disciplines just as well as vampires that take several times more
blood to get into play.

Contested Cards.

Many people use contested cards the wrong way.  In a multiplayer game you
should almost never contest someone's card unless that methuselah is so low
on pool they will be forced to yield very soon.  If they don't yield, you
both waste blood while all the other players get stronger.  When you are
winning the game, it is a good time to contest cards.  If you are losing
the game you should seriously consider yielding as you are in no position
to throw away the blood pool.  If you aren't prepared to go the full
distance in a contest, then it's probably better to yield.

Avoid conflict.

In a multiplayer game, your predator is probably very leery of tapping all
of his vampires.  If it looks like he will be satisfied by gaining control
of the Edge, then he'll probably stop bleed attempts as soon as he gets the
Edge.  You may want to simply allow his first minion to bleed you, instead
of blocking it.  If you don't have the Edge, 1 pool is a small price to
pay, to save your minions from slaughter.

Winning is Everything

While some may say "the most important thing is to have fun." We all know
that the best way to have fun is to win!  Hopefully, these tips will help
you to formulate a stronger playing strategy, and win more games.  If you
happen to have fun along the way, well hey, fun is good too!

The History of Primogen
@{UB}@{UU}

1.3   July 5, 1995 -doh! I lost a couple of games. ;(
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      -slightly modified discipline-strategy algorithm again.
      -Fixed a bug that was adding a NULL character to the end of vampire
       names.  (this bug was not noticible anywhere, but it existed).
      -made the main window larger and other cosmetic improvements.
      -added 21 more vampires.

1.2   June 17 1995 -still going.  15 wins no losses. :)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      - made busypointer work for evaluation window.
      - Strategy Strengths now only tally those disciplines which are
        actually used (selected).
      - more vampires.
      - Fixed manual to work with amigaguide v40. (as best as I could).
      - Some more tweaking of the internal weighting of various disciplines
        towards strategy strengths.
      - About window now shows total vampires in storage.


1.1:  June 2 1995  -haven't lost a single game since writing Primogen!-
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      - Added support for Tool types and command line arguments.
      - Added Discipline Checkboxes to improve Total Quality rating system
        (these automatically scale for fontsize in OS 3.0 or higher)
      - Improved Font sensetivity of Evaluation Window.
      - Primogen uses user preferences busypointer (for OS 3.0+ only)
      - Adjusted default standard for deciding on what an 'old' vampire is
        and how much difference there is between the ages.
      - all known errors from 1.0 corrected.

1.0   May 26 1995  -Original Release!-
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.5   May 15 1995  -original CLI based version of primogen. called: VampEval-
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.0   Early May    -idea for this program dawned upon me-
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

@ENDNODE
@NODE ToolTypes "Primogen Tool Types
@{B}@{U}
Icon Tool Types
@{UB}@{UU}

A number of Tool types are supported by Primogen.  In all cases where there is a
tool type, an equivalent command line parameter is supported, and is described
along with the tool type below.  You can change the tool types by clicking on
the Primogen icon and selecting 'Information...' from the 'Icons' menu in
Workbench.  See your Workbench manuals.

The purpose of these tool types is to let you change the way primogen calculates
its Discipline Qualities.  The only reason to do this is if you disagree with
my subjective oppinion on the subject.


@{B}
SHIFT=#@{UB}

Usage:
 Where # is the Generation Shift Index.
 A low shift index (0-2) favours low generation vampires more while a high shift
 index (greater than 2) favours low generation vampires less.

 This works as follows.  When comparing vampires the shift index is always added
 as a constant.  If the Shift index where 0 then a 10th Generation vampire would
 be considered 10 times older than a 1st generation vampire.  If the shift index
 where 10 then a 10th Generation vampire would only appear to be slighty less
 than twice as old (as 10+10 = 20 and 1+10 = 11.  20 is slightly less than twice
 of 11).

 This value is used when calculating Discipline values, as a discipline is
 considered more valuable on a young vampire than on an old one.  Young vampires
 tend to get into play while old vampires cost so much blood that they often
 don't get used or take a long time to put out.

    CLI Usage:  Primogen -shift #

 Default Shift Index is 2.0.

@{B}
BASE=#@{UB}

Usage:
 Where # is the Base Blood Index.
 This indicates the Generation which you consider to be NORMAL.  Vampires are
 considered either 'young' or 'old' based on this Base Generation

    ClI Usage:  Primogen -base #

 Default Base Generation is 4.0. @{"Here" link basegenwhy} is why.

@{B}
WEIGHT=#@{UB}

Usage:
 Where # is the Superior/Standard weight Index.
 All superior rated disciplines are multiplied by this number, to determine
 their value while all standard disciplines are divided by this number.

 If you wanted to get perverse you could put a value less than 1 here and
 standard disciplines would be considered more valuable than superior.  If you
 wanted to be REALLY perverse you can put a value of 0 here.  (I don't suggest
 trying it.  I only mention it, as an illustration of something you should
 not do.)  If your system crashes consider that a "feature" of Primogen.

    CLI Usage: Primogen -weight #

 Default Superior/Standard Weight Index is 1.25

@{B}@{U}

    primogen -weight 1.25 -Base 4.5 -shift 2.0



@ENDNODE
@NODE basegenwhy " Why is 4th Generation so special?"
@{B}@{U}
Why is 4th Generation so Special?
@{UB}@{UU}

The reason for this is fairly straightforward.  I used to believe that 5.5
should be the base generation.  This number was fairly arbitrary, but I felt it
had some logic behind it as 1/2 the generations are less than 5.5 and 1/2 of
them are greater.  It seemed sensible.  However while walking home one day it
suddenly dawned upon me.

Every turn there are 4 transfers.  The largest vampire one could possibly bring
out in 1 turn is 4th gen.  And there you have my justification.  Any vampire
higher than 4th gen takes at least 2 turns to get into play, and will slow down
your deck.  Vampires of 4th gen are 'normal' (taking 1 turn) and vampires of
younger than 4th gen are 'fast' (allowing you to get multiple vampires into play
during the same turn).

@ENDNODE
@NODE checks "The checkboxes"
@{B}@{U}
What are these Check Boxes.
@{UB}@{UU}

The Check Marks are there for you to tell Primogen which disciplines you intend
to use.  Primogen then uses these disciplines to accurately calculate a Total
quality in the Totals Box.  As you build your crypt and play with the check
boxes you will soon see that making a cypt that is strong at more than 2 or 3
disciplines is difficult (if not impossible).

The Strategy Strengths are affected by which disciplines you put in your
crypt, as you will see the ratings are highest when you use many disciplines.
This is because any discipline you do not choose to use is considered to be
rated at 0 for the purpose of determining how it affects your strategy
strengths.  Obviously if you don't put any celerity cards in your library, your
effecting rating in celerity is 0 regardless how many vampires may have
celerity.

Don't fall into the trap of using too many disciplines to boot the total
strength rating.  Total quality is equaly important, and a wise player knows the
proper balance.

If you are only using version 2.x of the OS the checkboxes may look the wrong
size.  It's time to upgrade to 3.x or higher.  In version 2.x checkmark gadgets
are not scalable.
@ENDNODE
@NODE requirements "What do you need to use Primogen?"
@{B}@{U}
The Requirements
@{UB}@{UU}

Primogen requires an Amiga using version 2.0 or higher of the Operating System.

Primogen doesn't require an FPU although it does use floating point math and will 
exploit an FPU if there is one present.

If you are using version 3.x of Amigados Primogen looks nicer, and obeys the user
preferences better.

1.3 users are out of luck as I used Gadtools.library.  Time to upgrade!
