 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 By S. Raaijmakers in 1993      Release 1.0      E-mail:  stijnr@sci.kun.nl
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This program was made using:

	AMOS
	Deluxe Paint
	FED

 The Multris font is slightly based on \TeX's {\tt cmr} fonts.


WHAT IS THIS?

 This is `Multris', a Tetris-clone.  This is a pre-release version, but not
 just a pre-release version.  It has many options and looks nice. You don't
 have to read these docs to be able to play it.


CONTROL

		|Joystick		Keyboard		Keypad
 ---------------+-----------------------------------------------------
 Left		|Left			J			4  <
 Right		|Right			L			6  >
 Down		|Down						2  v
 Clockwise	|			I			8  ^
 C. Clockwise   |Button			K			5
 Drop		|			<Space>			0  Ins

 I didn't really spend much time on the joystick part, so it's rotten.


THIS IS THE *TH TETRIS-CLONE!

 It is indeed.  If you ask me, the perfect Tetris still does not exist. But
 this one comes close. In fact, the only thing the final version will lack,
 is good response to pressed keys.


WHAT CAN'T YOU DO?

 These  are the options you don't have in this version,  but will appear in
 the next version:
 o Save and load your configurations,  thus allowing you to design your own
   library of styles.
 o Assign your own keys to the available movements:  turn right, turn left,
   move right, move left, move down and drop.
 o Design your own block-styles (sprites used for the blocks) using an IFF-
   paint program like DPaint.
 o Optional music/sound/silence.
	
 These are the options you don't have  in  this  version  and  might  never
 appear in any future release:
 o Design your own block-sets.
 o Levels which allready have blocks in it (like the Arcade version).
 o See the next block.

MONEY

 I don't expect any money for this program at all.  It is Public Domain and
 not  Shareware.   Just play it a lot if you like it,  and let your friends
 play and copy it.

PROGRAMMERS

 If you're planning to make Tetris, please read the programmers-guide; it's
 almost impossible to write a good Tetris if you haven't given it plenty of
 thought.   This was my third version  (my first was on a CBM 64)  and it's
 finally pretty OK.


OTHER TETRIS CLONES

 These are some other Tetris clones:
 T-Triz (2.0) Great music and BIG blocks.  Unfortunately,  you tend to keep
	      your eyes on the lower left corner of the screen.   Are you a
	      Maestro?
 Tetron       Many options, especially in future versions. It's a bit slow,
	      but the arcade-type levels are real tough.
 Colors       Looks nice, plays nice and has poor sounds. It isn't really a
	      Tetris, it's a combination of Tetris and Othello.
 Zetris       Run's in a window on your Workbench screen.  Nothing special.
 Hextris      Tetris with six-sides blocks.   Takes a while to get used to,
	      but it's fun to play.
 Intereferon  A bit like Colors.  Looks nice,  sounds nice, plays nice, but
	      you won't get hooked to it.
 Tettrix      Awfull  control and bad sounds.   It does show the next three
	      blocks, though.
 Sizetris     Well, it might have been nice if it worked properly.


FUN

 Have fun with Multris!
