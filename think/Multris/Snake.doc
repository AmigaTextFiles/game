›0;32mQUICK GUIDE:

Game Objective	›31m Finish the last level, kill the other snakes or a combination
		of both.
		To finish a level, get all the blocks.

›32mKeys		›31m Move Snake 3 (the green one) with the cursor keys.
		Hit space (or a button) to get rid of messages on the screen.
		Move Snake 4 (the yellow one) with these key's: Ctrl = Up,
		Left Shift = Down, Left Alt = Left, Left Amiga = Right.
		Press escape to give all snakes 1 life.
		Amiga+A: to the workbench screen and back.
		Ctrl-C: stops the game at any time.

›32mSettings	›31m Speed can be entered in 2 decimals, for example: 2.51, 3.4, 0
		Move the mouse cursor with the mouse or a joystick in port 1.
		Pixels is the number of pixels your snake will grow after
		picking op a block. The number that's on the block multiplied
		by #pixels determines how much longer you'll get:

		(#pixels) × (number on block) = (growth of snake)

›32mScore		›31m Picking up a block gives you as many points as says the number
		on it.
		Dying means -10 points.

›32mMORE INFO:

›1;31mThe settings:

›0;32m... Snakes	›31m   The number of players. The rectangles around the names of the
		players indicates the current number of players.
		The maximum is 4 !
›32mSnake ...	›31m Enter the name of player ...
›32mSound on/off	›31m Obvious. There are 4 samples.
›32mSpeed ...	›31m See above. Speeds above 10 are for people with fast processors.
›32mStart level›31m¹	  This is nice for training.
›32mEnding level›31m¹	  The game has to end somewhere !
›32m... Blocks›31m²	  The number of blocks needed to finish a level.
›32m... Pixels›31m²	  See above.
›32m... Lives	›31m I don't mind trainers. The maximum is 2147483647. That should
		be enough anyway.
		If you consider dying takes you at least a second, you can
		loose 31536000 lives a year³, by playing snake every second of
		the year. So with 2147483647 lives, it would take you a little
		more than 68 years to loose ALL lives. I guess you could say
		infinite lives are possible.
		Only the first 16 lives will be displayed on screen, though.
›32mDefault	›31m This brings all the settings back to their defaults.
›32mKamikaze	›31m As well as Default, War of 3 and 2P Friendly, this brings the
		settings to a certain default, in which the game is nice to
		play.
		You can imagine that, with 31536000 lives, speed 20, one snake,
		2 blocks and 1 pixel, the game would get a little to easy.

¹ The starting level cannot exceed the ending level.
  If the levels start to get extremely repetative, "ending level" has exceded
  the number of levels I programmed.
² These relate to each other: the more blocks, the less pixels are possible,
  and visa versa. This is calculated with a formula derived from:

	x·(x+1)
	------- = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x
	   2

³ 31622400 in a leap-year.

›1;31mThe Game:

›0;32mMovement	›31m   Joystick in port 1 for the blue snake (snake 1).
		Joystick in port 0 for the red snake (snake 2).
		Cursor keys for the green snake (snake 3).
		You cannot make a 180° turn (200° in some country's).

›32mHow to die ?	›31m Crash into a wall or a snake (including yourself).

›32mEVEN MORE INFO:

›31mThe game "snakes" is a classic game, which is about just as old as Space
Invaders.

I made it using AMOS, but you might have figured that out, by now.
I used Technosound Turbo to grab the samples from other games (Thanks folks !).


Have fun with Snake,
