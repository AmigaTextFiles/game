This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).

For further instruction just ask the fish and/or visit the original website at

PS:
Don't forget that you also need the datafiles from
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fillets/fillets-ng-data-0.7.0.tar.gz?download
(beware 92 MBytes)
Unpack them and copy the contents of the "fillets-ng-data-0.7.0" directory to the
"data" directory.
