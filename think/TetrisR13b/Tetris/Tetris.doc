Tetris

- Version 1.3b by Ross Fuller



* Introduction
Welcome to Tetris! I wrote this version because most versions I'd seen
for the Amiga were not faithful to the original or were very sloppy with
their controls. It is a very easy program to use and enjoy. Have fun!


* Installation/Running
Installing and running Tetris is very easy. Simply copy the Tetris
directory wherever  you wish it to go and double click on the icon to
start. Note that Tetris looks for its High Score tables in the directory
it is started from.


* How to play
Start the game and give it a go. If you've never heard of Tetris before
(what planet have you been on?), have a look at the Help Screen for some
pointers.


* Hints
Experiment with how pieces can be rotated and moved. Like the original,
pieces can be moved just before being fixed into place when landing.
Also, rotating can be done in what looks like an unlikely position if
the end position is clear.


* Scoring
I won't give away the exact method of scoring. Suffice to say that more
points are scored for a block dropped from a great height or to a great
height, removing multiple lines at once is rewarded, and points are
scored for completing each level (and it gets faster). Note that the
high score files look like plain text, but if they are changed, a
checksum will cause Tetris to report a corrupt file.


* Controls
The mouse controls are obvious, but once familiar with the program, some
keyboard short-cuts will be more useful. These controls are as follows:

   Main menu:
         Enter             -  Start Game
         Help              -  Help
         M                 -  Music toggle
         F                 -  Sound FX toggle
         H                 -  High Scores
         Esc               -  Exit
         Up/Down Arrows    -  Change Start Depth

   Help Screen:
         Esc               -  Exit

   High Scores Screen:
         Up/Down Arrows    -  Change Depth
         Esc               -  Exit

   Play Screen:
         Left/Right Arrow  -  Move Left/Right
         Up Arrow          -  Rotate
         Down Arrow        -  Drop
         Space             -  Pause
         Esc               -  Abandon Game

* Files
Files in the Tetris directory:
   Tetris            -  Compiled Tetris game
   Tetris.info       -  Tetris icon (for 640x512/400 Workbench screens)
   TetrisHR.info     -  Tetris icon for use on normal HighRes 640x256/200
                        WB screens (copy over Tetris.info if needed)
   Tetris.Depth#?.HS -  High Score files (created when there are High
                        Scores to save). You can reset high scores by
                        deleting these files. I've included one HS file
                        with my current highest score. If anyone beats it,
                        please send me details (uuencode the HS file in an
                        email if possible).


* Compatibility
Tetris should run on any Amiga. It has been tested on: A500 (WB 2.0, PAL),
A4000/030 (WB 3.0, PAL & NTSC).


* History
Tetris is written in AMOS and compiled using the AMOS Pro Compiler.
Tetris is freeware.

v1.0  -  April 1992
      Bare bones version.

v1.1  -  April 1993
      Jazzed up version.

v1.2  -  January 1994
      Couple of minor bug fixes.

v1.3 &
v1.3a -  March 1994
      Checksum on HS Files + minor cosmetic changes.

v1.3b -  March 1994
      Workaround for strange Compiler bug which causes program to bomb
      on an A500.


* Future
Once AMOS Pro is available with AGA support, that will be the next
update. Also, any suggestions I receive may be included.


* Thanks
Thanks to Robert Cheeseman and Paul Farrington for suggestions and
playtesting. Thanks to Robert for the suggestion to call the program
'Tetross' but I thought that was just a BIT corny. Also, thanks to
whoever did one of the music modules I've used (Popcorn). I found it
on a Public Domain disk ages ago but haven't a clue where it originated.
