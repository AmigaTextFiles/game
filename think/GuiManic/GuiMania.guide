@node whatsthis

This program is simply a game.

To be more specific we can say that this game is a mathematical riddle,
or in other words a problem of logic.This means that you have to activate 
some brain cells of yours in order to solve it.During this procedure there 
will be a clock counting the time that has passed.So you must reach the 
solution as quicky as possible in order to see your name in the hiscore 
table.The presence of a hiscore list makes this program very interesting 
because you can check if you have become a better player and gives the 
chance for more than one players to find out who is really the best 
mathematical mind...

(I now regret it for adding this option because it's really annoying to
make game and finally find out that e.g your sister is a better player
than you ...  who programmed the whole thing!)

@node specialreq
  GUI-ARITHMOMANIA v2.0f uses the Amiga intuition and graphics libraries.
The narrator.device is also needed for the simple speech that is used
in the game(I have not included the narrator.device within the compressed
archive)
To say the truth I have not tested this game in another machine besides my
A1200 (with no expansions on),so I dont really know if there will be any
priblems in other systems,but I dont think so.
  The only problem that may occur is slow machines is the...speed problem.
While calculating the new puzzle in a A500 for example,I think that in some
cases this could take even half a minute...But that's not an important
problem of course (At least that's my opinion!)

@node rules
Rules of Arithmomania:

You are in front of a 5X5 table.This table has from 2 (min) to 9 (max)
empty gaps,12 spots with the four mathematical signs in them and 4 spots
that are not seen because they don't effect the game (dead spots).
Your target while playing is to fill this table with the numbers from
1 to 9 so that the calculations between the numbers  have the right
results (which are displayed either in the right side or below the 
table).Each number from 1 to 9 should be used only once.

NOTE that the calculations do not follow the FORMAL ORDER !!!
You must make your calculations from left to right(or downwards).
For example in this game 3 - 1 * 5 is not equal to -2 but to 10.

@endnode

@node newb
The new button:

At the beginning the only active button is the new button.

When pressed,the computer starts a number of calculations in order to produce
the new puzzle with which you are going to play.This procedure can take
some seconds so you must wait.

Just after the new puzzle is created,the @{"start" link "startb"} button
and the @{"easy" link "easyb"} button are activated.

The computer is now ready for you to play!

@endnode

@node easyb

The easy button:

After the new puzzle is created with @{"new" link "newb"} button,you can
immediately press the @{"start" link "startb"} and begin playing..
In this case you will play a game with 9 empty gaps (category 9),the most
difficult game.If you wanna make things a little (or a lot!) easier for
U ,before pressing START ,choose the EASY  button.

When the easy button is pressed,
a requester will appear with two buttons in it,informing you about how
many numbers will be revealed to U at the beginning of the game.
This value begins with 0,but if you press the right button it will be 
increased by one (the left decreases it this way).

For example if you want to have 7 empty gaps to fill,then you must reveal
9-7=2 and you will play a 7 category game.

Just after you make your choice you must close the "easy window".

NOTE:The easy button is deactivated when the game begins.You can press
The EASY button only just after NEW !

If you press START now,you will be able to play the game that you
have arranged!

@endnode

@node showb
The show button:

This is your choice when everything has gone wrong.By pressing this button
The solution to the puzzle will be shown to U.In this case it is considered
that you have lost the game and you get no score for it!

After the SHOW button is pressed,all the other buttons are deactivated and the
only thing U can do is restart by pressing the @{"new" link "newb"} button.



@endnode 

@node startb
The start button:

This is the button which actually starts the game.
By the time that this button is pressed the clock starts counting and you
must try to fill the gaps in the table,with the numbers you have pick
up from the other table below (the table with the numbers from 1 to 9 let's
say table-2).

Each time you pick up a number from table-2 to table,the gadget of this
number is at once deactivated.In order to use this number again you must
delete it from the table by using the DELETE button,or replace it with another
number of the table-2.

While playing a text-line in the bottom of the games'window is informing U 
about the time that has passed and the category (the difficulty) of the game.

Another thing you can do while playing is to press the @{"check" link "checkb"} button,
and you will be informed about the how many right choices you have.

There are four important buttons, 
placed at the upper right side of the game's window

                         These are:
                    The @{"orig" link "original"} button
                    The @{"mark" link "mark"} button
                    The @{"<<" link "lefti"} button
                    The @{">>" link "right"} button

These buttons can offer U a lot services while playing!

Finally,you can at any time press the @{"show" link "showb} button and
see the solution or even the @{"new" link "newb"} and let the computer
calculate a new puzzle !



@endnode

@node mark
When the MARK button is pressed the current position of the table is stored
in memory,and will be shown  again only when the @{"orig" link "original"} button
is pressed.


@endnode
@node original

When this button is pressed,the table will immediately return in the 
position which was when the @{"mark" link "mark"} button was pressed.

If the mark button is not pressed yet,then it will return in the starting
position.

@endnode


@node lefti

This button, when pressed,the previous position of the table will appear.
The ten previous positions are stored and can be shown again.
While going back,if you find a position that you think it's good to
continue from,and you fill a gap,then the positions stored which were
following this position,will be deleted and cannot be accesed with
the @{">>" link "right"} button.The previous positions still remain in
memory.


@endnode

@node right
In order to to something this button, the @{"<<" link "lefti"} button should
be pressed, at least once , first!

With >> button you can view the next positions,which are stored in memory.
@endnode

@node checkb
By pressing the CHECK button,you will be informed about how many right choices
you have.But it's not everything so simple.Each time you press CHECK your
category in decreased by one.So if you begin to play a 7 category game and
you press CHECK two times,your current category will be 5 and you gonna
have worse scores !

So have in mind that CHECK costs a category !

@endnode

@node hiscore
HISCORES!

Hiscores can be shown either by choosing the appropriate link from the menu,
or by pressing Amiga-S.

The names of the 20 better players are stored here with the time that took
them,the category of the game they played and the score they have made!

As you will soon find out,the difficulty of the game is rapidly increased
(or decreased..) from one category to another,so there are different score
limits for each category and the points given for the same time are
different for DIFFERENT categories. 

For example category 9,which is the most difficult,gives more points than
any other category,for the same time of solution!

Well, I know an archaeologist who is a fanatic C programmer..)

I started with computers at the age of 8,with an ATARI 600Xl (I still
seek for information about this machine ..proccessor,speed etc..if you
know something please email me!).12 years as a computer fanatic I have 
seen evolutions and revolutions in the computers area..and I am still
impressed by everything new about them...

I am also waiting for a biologist to say that computermania is in the
genes !

@node history
Well,this program has a very short history...
Before Gui-Arithmomania v2.0f there was in aminet the armania.lha file
which was same game but in ascii characters...

The ascii version was also compiled for unix and msdos machines.

I recieved several emails from people who asked me to make it GUI...
And so I did.

As a former PC-user ,I have  noticed the difference in quality between
the amiga and pc public domain programs.Do u know that what for us was
defacto from the beginning (GUI) for PCs is still rare ? 





@endnode

@node futuret

I think that this program is more than finished! (if you have a different 
opinion email me) so in the future the only things that will change are
the bugs! (hope not so many )

@endnode
@node buglist
I have tried hard to clear this program from all the bugs,but each
of you who has written even the most simple program knows that this is
practically almost impossible ! (This must be a curse!)

So,although I have not found a bug ,I am sure that there is a great
possibility for some to exist !

If you think you have found a bug,

please Email me at vassil@ikaros.edu.uch.gr



@endnode 

@node agreement

Please note that this program will be used at your own risk.
Altough it's enough tested and has proved to work,I dont accept  
responsibilities of any kind.

--------------------------------------------------------------

EMAILWARE!

This software if emailware.This means that I want you to sent me an email!
Why ? Because I like emails ! And because I demand to be paid and since time
is money,a mail that has cost you 1 minute would be a appropriate fee !
Many thanks to the people that have tested the previous version (armania 1.1)
and sent me their opinion!

I wait for you to contact me !


My email address is vassil@ikaros.edu.uch.gr
