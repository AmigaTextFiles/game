AntiMatter is a single-player strategy game in which the computer hides a
number of atoms in a chamber.  You must determine the locations of the atoms
by firing plasma rays into the chamber and observing where the rays (which
are influenced by the atoms) emerge.

=============================================================================

    1  AntiMatter Features - Features of this implementation.


Stereo sound
- Four-channel stereo sound follows the action!
- Conforms to the Amiga's "channel-locking" convention, allowing channels to
  be stolen by higher priority requests, and later returned to the original
  owner.

Animated Pointer
- 30fps animated pointer using a proprietary vertical-blank interrupt handler.
- Multiple instantiations of AntiMatter share the animating routine.

Configurable
- The player can choose how large a chamber to use (6x6 through 14x14)
  as well as how many atoms will be hidden (3 through 8).  (See "Starting
  AntiMatter".)

OS-sensitive
- Runs under AmigaOS 1.3, 2.x and 3.x and on all 680x0 processors.

Low memory usage
- Opens a lo-res screen and uses a "shading" pattern to extend the color
  palette.
- Chip RAM audio samples are shared for the various sound effects.

Well tested
- Developed using Enforcer and Mungwall.

    2  AntiMatter Instructions - How to play AntiMatter.


A new game is set up when Antimatter is first invoked.  Changing the
configuration of the board (see "Starting AntiMatter") will also set up a
new game, as will selecting "New game" from the "Project" menu.


The instructions are divided into the following sub-categories:

    2.1  Starting Antimatter

    2.2  Firing rays

    2.3  Ray travel

    2.4  Marking choices

    2.5  Scoring

    2.6  Menus

    2.7  Online Help

    2.8  Tips


=============================================================================

    2.1  Instructions - Starting Antimatter


Antimatter can be started from either the Workbench (by double-clicking on
the Antimatter icon) or from the shell.  Game preferences can be specified
from either interface.

--------------------------------------

    2.1a  Starting AntiMatter - Workbench


The number of atoms and size of the chamber can be set in AntiMatter's icon
(using "Information" from the Workbench) with "ATOMS=" and "SIZE=" tooltypes.
An additional ToolType parameter, "SOUNDPRI=" can be used to set the priority
of AntiMatter's sound effects.  If SOUNDPRI is set to the special value
"999", AntiMatter will not generate any sounds.

Valid numbers of atoms range from 3 to 8; chamber size from 6 (6x6) to 14
(14x14).

The default values for the tooltypes are as follows:

    ATOMS=4

    SIZE=8

    SOUNDPRI=127


--------------------------------------

    2.1b  Starting AntiMatter - Shell


The number of atoms and size of the chamber can be specified when starting
AntiMatter from the Command Line (Shell).  An additional argument can be used
to set the priority of AntiMatter's sound effects.  If SOUNDPRI is set to the
special value "999", AntiMatter will not generate any sounds.

Valid numbers of atoms range from 3 to 8; chamber size from 6 (6x6) to 14
(14x14).

The syntax of the command depends upon the version of the operating system
installed on your Amiga.


Newer versions of AmigaDOS (specifically, version 2.04 and later) use the
"ReadArgs" syntax:

    Antimatter ATOMS=4 SIZE=8 SOUNDPRI=127

Older versions use a Unix-style syntax:

    AntiMatter -a4 -s8 -p127


Both formats shown above illustrate the default AntiMatter values.


--------------------------------------

    2.1c  Starting AntiMatter - Sound Priority


AntiMatter allocates all four Amiga audio channels to create action-specific
stereo sound.  A priority level of 127 will prevent any other application
from stealing AntiMatter's audio channels.  Anything less than 127 (down to
-128) will allow applications with a higher audio priority to steal the
channels.  AntiMatter will attempt to reallocate stolen channels as soon as
they are freed.


=============================================================================

    2.2  Instructions - Firing Rays


Fire a ray by positioning the laser (cursor) at one of the chamber entrances
(the squares along the chamber edges) and clicking the left mouse button.

The entrance (and exit, if the ray ultimately exited the chamber) will then
be indicated with a colored marker (described in Ray travel) determined by
how the chamber's atoms influenced the ray.


=============================================================================

    2.3  Instructions - Ray travel


A ray will normally travel in a straight line (an Unimpeded flight, the ray
passes straight through the chamber) unless acted upon by one or more atoms.

There are two primary ways in which a ray can be effected by atoms:

Absorption - The ray is absorbed by an atom in the chamber.

Deflection - The ray is caused to veer 90° from a straight line.
             There are two special cases of Deflections known as Reflections.


Note that the influence of multiple atoms in the chamber can combine to yield
complex results.


--------------------------------------

    2.3a  Ray travel - Unimpeded flight


If there are no atoms directly in the ray's path, nor along the left or right
of the path, the ray will pass straight through the chamber, exiting on the
opposite side.

The entrance and exit locations will be indicated with like-color markers.


--------------------------------------

    2.3b  Ray travel - Absorption


If a ray is fired directly into an atom, it is absorbed, and does not exit
the chamber.

The square where the ray entered the chamber will be indicated with a black
marker.


--------------------------------------

    2.3c  Ray travel - Deflection


If a ray would pass immediately alongside an atom the ray will be deflected
away from the atom at a right angle to its original path.

If the ray would have passed the atom on the atom's right side, the ray is
deflected to the right.

If the ray would have passed on the atom's left side, it is deflected to the
left.


Note that the deflection occurs one square *before* the ray and the atom
would be next to each other.  The entrance and exit locations will be
indicated with like-color markers.


There are two important conditions that result in a special type of
deflection known as a Reflection.


......................................

    2.3d  Ray travel - Reflection


If the deflecting atom is alongside the square at which the ray would enter
the chamber, the ray is unable to be deflected, and is instead reflected
directly back out.

This reflection is indicated with a white marker at the attempted entrance
point.


A reflection also occurs if there are two atoms straddling the ray's path (ie
they are exactly one square apart and the ray is traveling down the path
between them).  The ray is deflected both right and left at the same time,
but cannot overcome either atom, and is instead reflected back along the path
from which it came.

The ray emerges from the same location it entered, and the reflection is
indicated with a white marker.


=============================================================================

    2.4  Instructions - Marking choices


As you fire rays into the chamber, and observe the results, you will start to
form an idea of where the hidden atoms are.

You can mark your suspected locations by positioning the cursor over the
desired location in the center grid of the chamber and clicking the left
mouse button, creating a white marker.

Clicking on the same location again will remove the marker.  While you may
place as many markers in the center grid of the chamber as you like, you will
not be able to score your guesses if you have more markers than there are
atoms hidden in the chamber.


=============================================================================

    2.5  Instructions - Scoring


During game play, you may place as many markers in the center grid of the
chamber as you like.  In order to calculate your score, however, you may have
no more markers than there are atoms hidden in the chamber.

Once you believe that you have correctly guessed the location of all the
atoms in the chamber, (as indicated by your white markers in the center
grid), choose the menu item "Guess/How did I do?".

If the "How did I do?" menu choice is ghosted (disabled), you have too many
markers on the center grid of the chamber.  Simply click on the unneeded
markers until you have as many (or fewer) markers as there are atoms hidden
in the chamber.

To calculate your score, the actual locations of the atoms will be displayed.
Atoms which you correctly guessed will be marked with a checkerboard marker,
atoms which you missed will be solid red, and atoms which you thought existed
but didn't are left in white.

Your score is calculated from the number of rays fired, and the number of
atoms correctly guessed.  The lower your score the better.


=============================================================================

    2.5a  Instructions - Score calculation


The formula used for calculating the score is:


    ( 5 * ( A - C ) ) + R


    where


    A is the number of atoms embedded in the chamber.

    C is the number of atoms correctly identified
      with markers in the center of the chamber.

    R is the number of ray markers along the edges
      of the chamber.


=============================================================================

    2.6  Instructions - Menus


    AntiMatter has three main menus:


    2.6a  Project menu

    2.6b  Prefs menu

    2.6c  Guess menu


--------------------------------------

    2.6a  Menus - Project Menu


The "Project/New Game" menu item (Keyboard shortcut "Right-Amiga N") will
begin a new game with the selected game parameters of chamber size and number
of atoms.

The "Project/About..." menu item ("Right-Amiga A") gives credit for the
original board game upon which AntiMatter is based.

The "Project/Quit" menu item ("Right-Amiga Q") will exit the game.


--------------------------------------

    2.6b  Menus - Prefs Menu


There are several menu selections that will help you tailor AntiMatter to
your desired level of difficulty.  The "Prefs/Atoms" and "Prefs/Size of
Chamber" menu items will allow you to set the number of atoms and the size of
the chamber.  The currently selected values are displayed in a "ghosted" or
dimmed manner.  As soon as you change one of these parameters, a new game
will be created using the new value(s).  You can choose from both the "Atoms"
and "Size of Box" menus without releasing the "menu" (right) mouse button in
between.  This is known as extended-selecting the items.

These preferences can also be specified when AntiMatter is invoked from
either the Workbench or Shell.


--------------------------------------

    2.6c  Menus - Guess Menu


The "Guess/Clear Markers" and "Guess/Set Markers" menu items (Keyboard
shortcuts "Right-Amiga C" and "Right-Amiga S", respectively) will allow you
to clear or set all the center grid markers at once.

The "Guess/How did I do?" menu item ("Right-Amiga T") will tally up your
score.  You will be unable to select this item if there are too many "guess"
markers on the center grid.


=============================================================================

    2.7  Instructions - Online Help


Pressing the "Help" key during game play will interrupt the action and call
up "AmigaGuide" to display this documentation.

AmigaGuide will be instructed to look in the same directory that AntiMatter
is located in for "AntiMatter.guide".

Should either AmigaGuide or the guide file not be found, AntiMatter will
attempt to call up "More" (actually Sys:Utilities/More) on
"AM:AntiMatter.doc".


=============================================================================

    2.8  Instructions - Tips


    2.8a  Preferences

    2.8b  Beginner games

    2.8c  Deflections

    2.8d  Impossibilities


--------------------------------------

    2.8a  Tips - Preferences


The default size of 8x8 and 4 atoms is a good starting point, but feel free
to make the chamber smaller or the atoms fewer when learning how the rays are
effected by the atoms.


--------------------------------------

    2.8b  Tips - Beginner Games


To help in understanding how rays are effected by the atoms, you may choose
to fire rays into all possible entrances, then select the "Guess/How did I
Do" menu to see the locations of the atoms, and then study the path of all
the rays.


--------------------------------------

    2.8c  Tips - Deflections


Keep in mind that Deflections occur one square before the ray would be
alongside an atom.


--------------------------------------

    2.8d  Tips - Impossibilities


There are configurations of atoms ("molecules") which cannot be completely
determined even if rays are fired into all chamber entrances.

The likelihood of such molecules increases with the number of atoms embedded
in the chamber.
