Description
===========

  BlockOut II is a (Direct3D/OpenGL) adaptation of the original BlockOut DOS 
  game edited by California Dreams in 1989. BlockOut II has the same features 
  than the original game with few graphic improvements. Score calculation is 
  also nearly similar to the original Game. BlockOut II has been designed by 
  an addicted player for addicted players.
  
  Have fun with BlockOut II...

How to compile the source (Windows) ?
=====================================

  - You need Microsoft VC++ 7 or VC++ 8
  - BlockOut II source can be donwloaded from sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/blockout
  - You need DirectX SDK 8.1 to compile. A recent release of the DirectX SDK will not work !
  - If you already have a recent DirectX SDK installed, just update your project path
    to the old DirectX SDK (present in the contrib directory)
  - Set all appropriate include and lib paths in the project properties
    (ImageLib , D3DTools and dxsdk8 if needed)
  - Set the working directory to the BlockOut project root
	

How to compile the source (Linux) ?
=====================================

  - You need opengl,sdl,sld_mixer devel package
  - Make the ImageLib library
  - Make blockout (in BlockOut_GL directory)
  
About Score Uploading
=====================

  To upload your high score to the online database, just go to the
  Score Details page and select Upload. You can enter a different
  name and a comment. Note that only score made with a release
  >=2.2 can be uploaded (Replay file needed).

About the Randomizer:
=====================

 The Blockout II random generator generates a sequence of all possible 
 pieces (depending on the pit dimension and block set) permuted randomly,
 as if they were drawn from a bag. Then it deals all pieces of the 
 sequence before generating another bag. It is not possible to get
 3 times the same piece. The random permuation is generated by a classic
 linear congruential generator.
