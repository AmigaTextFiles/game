                      SPOT IT (SPOT THE DIFFERENCE)

                     WRITTEN BY DEANO (AUGUST 1996)

Spot it is the computer version of the popular childrens game where you
have spot the differences between two identical pictures. From the options
screen select a picture from 1 to 9. From here you will see two pictures the
same. The one on the right is slightly different from the one on the left
because ten differences have been made. To play simply move the mouse
pointer over an area of the right picture which looks different to the same
area on the left picture and press the left mouse button. If you click on a
difference then you score an hit and 25 points. If you click on anything
else you will get a miss. You must score ten hits to win. If you get five
misses then you have lost. Once you find a difference a small box will
appear over the difference.

EXTRA INFO

Each time you choose a picture the computer will select from 11 sets of ten
differences for the selected picture meaning that everytime you select the
same picture you have choosen before...the differences will be different.

There is a cheat mode which will show all the differences in the current
picture. Its quite easy to find.

SPOT IT should run on all Amigas with at least 1 meg of memory.

I have also looking for some AMOS contacts. I have loads of Amiga stuff on
CD to swap so why not get in touch. Errm, SPOT IT is PD so please copy it to
your hearts content. Here are two of my other titles.

GIN RUMMY: There is a version knocking about by someone else but my version
is a lot easier to play.....PD

GRAFIX DEMO: A useable demo of probably the greatest art and animation tutor
going. The Full version is licenceware and availible from F1 Licenceware.

If you want any of these titles then please send me a blank disk and a
