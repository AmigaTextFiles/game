     Hi! Everybody know someyhing about the nuclear power and its danger.
We live in a world that could be destroyed by a new World War, but it can
also help giving a lot of energy, as much as you need. I think that it's
very important nowadays to have a lot of energy, so I agree with people
that want nuclear centrals in Europe, expecially in Italy where it is not
allowed.
     Thinking about its power I decided to make this game, "copied" from a
similar one by Hewlett for ST. I hope to have improved that one and make
a better game, but I think that you have to decide it.
     It is very easy to play: each player put in the table an atom and
adding them in the same place they will explode. In the corners they
explode when they are just 2, on the sides when they are 3 and elsewhere
when 4. You can start a non-stop reaction and so win....
     A tip? Don't put your atoms to close one another because you could
lose them all together, and use diagonals as much as possible.

              THANK YOU AND ENJOY YOURSELF!
           WINNERS DON'T USE DRUGS BUT URANIUM!

explosion, now the bug was corrected!
