DESCRIPTION
	IGNUChess offers an intuition driven interface  to  the  GNUChess  chess
	program, version 1.51. I know, this is an old one.
	There are a few  advantages, though:

	* IGNUChess is freely distributable. (Refer to "LEGAL STUFF" section).

	* Full  source  (SAS/C  6.51) is included.  Also the images of the chess
	  pieces are provided as an IFF ILBM file (Figuren.ilbm) for free use.

	* Needs only ~200K memory (+some chip mem for the graphic) and thus runs
	  on small machines (A500) without memory extension.

	* Special version optimized for 68020/30 included.

	* The  program  is  intended for NTSC Interlaced mode.  The graphics are
	  designed  to  minimize  noticable  flicker, so this might be the first
	  interlaced GUI most 1084 Monitor users like.

	

OPERATION
	Program start:

	Simply click  on  the  icon  labelled  IGNUChess.000  or  IGNUChess.030,
	according to your CPU.

***	There  is  a new tooltype "DISPLAYMODE".  Here you can enter any display
	identification  string you want to, e.g.  "MULTISCAN:Productivity" (case
	does  not  matter).   Run  the  preferences  program "ScreenMode" to see
	what's available.

	If  you  leave  out  this tooltype or enter an illegal string, IGNUChess
	will try to open an "NTSC:Highres Lace" screen.

	Note  to  old PAL Amiga users with OCS (old chip set):  You must enter a
	PAL display mode identifier, or else IGUChess won't run on your machine.

***	If the overscan settings for the selected screen mode are not sufficient
	to IGNUChess, the program will use autoscrolling.

	Select your preferred level of gameplay from the "Level" menu.   Default
	is 60 moves in 30 minutes.

	Moves are entered by clicking once on the piece of  choice.  The  square
	boundaries should start to blink.  Now click on the target square.  Your
	move will be executed if it was legal and GNUChess takes over it's turn.

BUGS & FEATURES
	Lots of.  Please report any Bugs you find to my EMail address and I will
	do  my  best  to correct them.  Note, I'm not a full time programmer and
	updates make take a while.
	Same applies to features you miss.

	Also note, I'm not responsible for GNUChess bugs (e.g.  the inability to
	make pawn promotions other than to queen).

FURTHER NOTES
	I'm  very interested in comparisons to other chess programs.  I you have
	access  to  other  (commercial)  chess  programs why dont't you set up a
	match and EMail me the record (commented or not)?
	If  you  send me a nice game record, played by you or by another program
	against IGNUChess, I will include it into my next distribution.

	If  you  feel  the  ability  to  create a nice icon for IGNUChess, don't
	hesitate, DO IT AND SEND IT TO ME!
	I will include all icons I get into the next distribution.

	The source uses a tabulator size of 4 characters.

FUTURE
	Depends on YOU.

HISTORY
	10.11.1993 Initial release

	11.02.1994 "DISPLAYMODE" tooltype added.

		   IGNUChess  is now a little bit more informative if something
		   goes wrong during initialization.

		   Compiled with SAS/C 6.51 now.

		   Removed  all  floating  point specific stuff, no FPU 68881/2
		   required for IGNUChess.030 any longer.
