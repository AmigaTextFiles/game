                      ==============================

The purpose of this program is to allow Colors to run, essentially.  Colors
needs to have the file "ColorsHi.abk" in order to run, and it must either be
the included file or a file made with this program.  If this program cannot
find the file in the current directory it will just flat out create one.  If it
DOES find the file, then you will be asked which high score charts you want to
erase.  If you accidently ran the program, just hit control-c or answer no to
all of the questions.  Once you kill the high scores, there is no going back
(unless you made a backup file).
