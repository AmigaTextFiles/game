How to Install the Game:
========================

For the game Double-Squares you need the font poster_ger in the FONT:
directory and the libraries diskfont.library and medplayer.library in the
LIBS: directory.
You can install the font and the medplayer.library with the Install_f&l 
script. It is assumed, that the diskfont.library is already in the LIBS: - 
directory.
To run DoubleSquares you also need the files: Decode, Decode.info, 
DS.encoded and DS_registered.info in the same directory and if you like
the Sound the snd-directory with the Soundfiles.
     


1 Player Game:
==============

When you start the game you see an empty 10x10 board on the right side. The
goal of the game is to set as many tiles on the board as possible. Each
tile consists of a inner and a outer square, which are all colored in one
of ten colors. Since there are 100 combinations, no two tiles are the same.
The order of the 100 tiles is random. You can see the next 5 tiles on the
lower left side of the screen. You can only place a tile on the board, if
there exists no other tile in the same row and column with the same inner
or outer color. All possible positions, where you can place your actual tile
are marked. If there is no possible position left, the game is over. The
game is also over if you exceed the time-limit, which is 10 seconds per
tile. For each tile you place on the board you will get 10 points and for
each complete row or column 100 points.
There are 4 gadgets on the screen, one to switch between 1 Player Game and
2 Player Game, one to show the Hi-Scores, one to start a new game and one to
terminate the game.

2 Player Game:
==============

There are the same tile-setting rules as in the 1 Player Game.
Alternately each player sets a tile on the board. The goal of the game is
to set the tiles so, that the other player can't set his next tile on the
board. Each player can see the 5 next tiles of him and his opponent. There
is no time limit in the 2 Player Mode.


Resetting the Hiscore:
======================

To reset the hiscore simply delete the hiscore-file double_squares.hiscore .
The program will generate a new empty one.


About the SHAREWARE: 
====================

I think the shareware-fee shold be as low as possible. So I don't wanna send
disks to you. On the other side, users who pay the fee should get a
acknowledgement for their behaviour (because 99% don't pay!). So I decided
to spread 2 versions on the disk: one, public accessable, with a requester,
which will remind you that this is SHAREWARE, and one without it, but encoded.
If you send me the SHAREWARE-fee, you will get the password for the decoding.
To decode the original program, start Decode and type in the code. You need
50 KBytes free space on that disk. After Decode has finished you can start
the original program DS_registered.
