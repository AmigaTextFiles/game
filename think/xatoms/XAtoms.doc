RULES:

     XAtoms  is  a  logical  game  for  two  players (for now?).  The
objective is to destroy all the enemy's atoms and save your own.  The
playground contains sixty-four fields, each containing a nucleus.  At
the  start,  there're  all  sixty-four nuclei neutral (they have grey
colour).   After  start  the first player can add one electron to any
atom.   Nucleus will have the same colour as the electrons around it.
Now  the  second player should draw.  He/she can add an electron only
to  sixty-three  atoms, because it isn't possible to add electrons to
enemy's  atoms  -  only  to  neutral or your atoms.  If the number of
electrons  around any atom reaches the number of adjoining atoms, the
atom  explodes and radiates out its electrons.  If all electrons from
the  atom are radiated out, it becomes neutral.  Atoms which received
electron(s)  by  this way, will change their colour to the electron's
one.   It's the only one legal way to gain enemy's atoms.  Of course,
there's  a  critical  number of electrons.  If you reach this amount,
never-ending  reaction  will start...  In this case, the program will
stop the reaction if one player loses all his atoms.


CONTROL:

     In  main  control mode  (it is indicated by light grey colour of
mouse  pointer)  you  can quit the program by pressing the ESC key or
start the game by the left mousebutton.

     Control in the game mode: 
           Abort the game by the ESC key
           Add one electron by the left mousebutton
           Change animation speed by pressing the right mouse button
                    

     Warning - you can control the game only if there isn't reaction
           running (no atoms currently exploding).


GRAPHICS:

     The  current  player  is indicated by a mouse picture drawn near
its  score  (score = number of his/her atoms).  If someone wins, this
picture will change to a smiling face.
