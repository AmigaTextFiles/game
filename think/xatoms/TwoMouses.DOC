   This small utility (its size is exactly 512 bytes) allows to control your
mouse pointer with two mouses (the second one is connected to the second game
port).  It's very useful for playing games controlled by two users with the
mouse (e.g. Exploding Atoms).

   TwoMouses can be freely redistributed without any restrictions (it may be
included in any kind of software including commercial one). It is generally
known as PUBLIC DOMAIN SOFTWARE.

   Known bugs: Eats a lot of CPU time when you're using the second mouse
