   Introduction
   ------------
  
   This is an early version of Jelly-Othelly. It has been released
   because it is so small and that way it can be squashed onto PD disks
   or Coverdisks.

   However, if you want the full version, this is what you'll get :-

   Music and more sound effects.
   Joystick as well as mouse controls.
   *Much* Tougher computer player.
   Different game 'Shapes' for shorter/longer games. 
   Best Scores saved to disk!  
   Best of 3 etc games.
   
   + Demo's of Sneech, Shroom Gammon, Peg-It, Piles'o'Tiles + anything NEW?

   If you want the Full version then please send a cheque or P/O
   for 3 Pounds & Stamped Addressed Envelope to:-

   If you live in The Netherlands then you can send a 10 Guilder note.
   It would be appreciated as I intend to visit your country again soon!!
   Anyone else in Europe can send their currency to the value of £5.  

   If you have Internet Access then I could possibly send you the full version
   via the net. If you want to contact me on the net about anything then look
   for me on IRC under the nickname 'shoecake'. I could send you the full
   game after recieving your cheque on IRC 'Weekends only'. Well get in touch
   any way you can.

   When you order your copy it would help me if you were to give me other
   details, like:-

   1. Amiga Set-Up, inc. Hard Drive? Memory, Workbench Version 1.3,3.0 etc.

   2. Where you got hold of this demo. If you got it off a mate then tell me
   that! You see I know exactly where I've sent the demo to so I'll be happy
   if you can tell me where it's traveled to! When a magazine uses one of my
   demo's I get loads of orders and I presume thats the reason. But after a
   few months I might get a new bunch of orders and I always wonder why? I
   know it will pop up in all sorts of places so let me know! 

   3. What your favorite games are (Commercial and Shareware).

   Anyone who registers will receive the Full Jelly-Othelly experience 
   as well as demos of all my other games including :-

       A Peg_It! demo             (includes all objects).
       Big demo of Shroom-Gammon! (Mad Backgammon game, Needs 1meg Chip).
       A Sneech Demo              (The Best Multi Player Worm Game Ever!!).
       A Piles'o'Tiles Demo       (Best Version of Shanghai/Dragon Tiles).
          
   If Jelly-Othelly is not up your street but you are still interested
   in seeing my other demos or you just want to play the new Peg_It demo
   or you missed the Sneech Demo or if you are interested in the
   Shroom-Gammon Demo (Needs over 800k of chip mem at the moment). 

   Send me a S.A.E and I'll send you all the other Demos I have......
  

   Jelly-Othelly Instructions.
   ---------------------------

   The object of the game is to turn as many of your opponents jellies into
   your jellies.

   Rule 1.

   You have to trap at least one of your opponents jellies between your new 
   jelly and one of your old jellies on a straight line without any gaps.

   That's it!

   During the game it is quite hard to tell who is winning so I have
   gone to great lengths to program a `Bazz-o-meter' (c)1994 Daisy Software
   the `Bazz-o-meter' will tell you roughly who is winning.
  
   The game ends when nobody can make a move. A final jelly count is made.

   Good-bye for now!
   -----------------

   I will be happy to hear your suggestions for new projects. I will be 
   writing some new games soon so if you let me know what kind of games 
   you like it will save me writing games no-one wants!
