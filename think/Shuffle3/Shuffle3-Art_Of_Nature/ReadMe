1.Introduction
--------------
First sorry for my bad english, I'll try to write this piece of text
correctly.
Shuffle is a simple logical game. Main task for a player is to repair
shuffled picture. You only have to click on two different pieces and
they'll swap their positions. When you fix the picture, CPU tells
you your score and you can get to the HALL OF FAME. Try to beat 
RAWEN (me)!!! :-)
 

2.Technical parameters
----------------------
Required:  AMIGA :-)))))) with AGA chipset
           about 1.5 MB OF MEMORY (depends on the lenght of atmospheric sample)
           AHI
          
This version is very simple and not-so-user-friendly.
    
3.How to use it
---------------
The menu is very simple. It contains 4 chooses:
F1 Start a new game
F2 Change picture (picture, which will be shuffled)
F3 Change atmosphere (not a module, but a sample)
F4 Quit to AMIGA OS 

INGAME KEYZ:
------------
ESC - Leave the game.
F1  - New atmospheric sample.

3.5 Pictures & Atmospheres
--------------------------
As you can see, pictures have suffix for choosing an atmosphere.
.fore(st), .lake, .moun(tains), .rive(r), .seas, .wind
If there's no suffix, the program takes fore.bkg atmosphere.
(If picture has not a right suffix, there can be problems, so use it, please)

4.Flexibility
-------------
If you have some nice pictures (640*480 - 256 colours) you can use them.
Of course you can use suffix for atmospheres.
You can make your own atmosphere too. Simply save it to atmospheres dir
and you can use new suffix (must have 4 characters).
F.ex. atmospheres/trop.bkg -> your own atmospheric sample
      pictures/eden.trop   -> your own picture calls your own sample

Frequency of an atmospheric sample is 11000 Hz !!!
There's no size limit.

5.BUGS
------
I can't find them.
