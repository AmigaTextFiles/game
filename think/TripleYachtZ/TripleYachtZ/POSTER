This is version 1.2 of Triple Yacht-Z, an implementation and variation
of the game Yacht.

Plays both Single (The standard game) and Triple Yacht-Z
A Seperate High Score list for the Single and Triple Versions
Preferences file for customized table-tops
And a match mode where up to 51 games can be played as a series
Matches can be saved and reloaded
Last command undo

This version fixes some bugs (some not so pretty ones) and adds a file requester
for saved and loaded matches, a color requester, an improved way to score
rolls, and a slightly improved undo function (not much though!).
