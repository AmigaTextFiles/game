Warning!!!  RockSlide has been found to be a highly addictive
            game of strategy and finger dexterity.  Don't 
            get mad at me if it causes you to miss work, get 
            fired, become disgruntled, and give your neighbor's
            cat a mohawk.

OBJECT:
     Assemble the falling rocks into horizontal or vertical 
patterns of three or more like colors.  If the rocks build up 
to lodge within the red & white striped area the game will end.

     You may use the cursor keys or the numeric keypad.

This program has been tested on an Amiga 500 with one meg of ram,
and an Amiga 1200.

This program is SHAREWARE.  That means spread it around so I can
become famous.  That also means if you like the game, you should
register it by sending $10.00 U.S. dollars in check or money
order (or whatever you think it is worth) to.....

Those who register will receive free major revisions to the game
that come in the future.  (If they are made of course).  They 
will also receive this college student's deepest appreciation.
