@node INTRODUCTION "Introduction"

    @{b}@{i}Euchre@{ui}@{ub} is a classic card game using a 24 card deck (9,10,J,Q,K,A of each suit). Also
utilizing trump, Euchre is similar in some aspects to Pinochle, and is also Y2K compliant!

    @{b}@{i}Euchre!@{ui}@{ub} the program marks my own personal foray into the world of Amiga programming. I offer
this program as SOMEWARE to the Amiga community. All I would like is SOME email telling me
what you think of it.

    Bug reports should be sent to the @{"author" link Author}. I ask that you be as specific as possible with
your reports, especially in describing the conditions leading up to the bug in question. All
contributors in this area will be duly recognized (see @{"History" link History})!

    Suggestion for the game are also accepted (eagerly) by the @{"author" link Author}. Before you send any, though,
look see if it is scheduled for @{"future" link ToDo} inclusion. Of course, you can still reiterate
(or refute!) any of my future plans!

@node INSTALLATION "Installation"

@{b}@{i}System Requirements@{ui}@{ub}

You need an Amiga running AmigaDOS 2.04 or better. Unless you have a stock A500 with only
512k, you should have plenty of memory.

You also need to have the font "XHelvetica" and size 11 available. It comes with the Magic Workbench
public release. It is a great looking font, if you don't have it, get it!!

@{b}@{u}@{i}AFS Users Note:@{ui}@{uu}@{ub} Please let me know if this works for you or not. I have had one report of trouble
from an AFS user, and I would like to hear from anyone else who uses that file system on whether
or not it works for them.

@node EUCHRERULES "Euchre Rules"
@{b}@{i}Overview@{ui}@{ub}

    This section presents the rules of the card game Euchre for the uninitiated. If you are
already familiar with the game, you can skip this section and go straight to @{"Game Play" link GamePlay}.

    Euchre is a card game for four players using a 24 card deck. This deck is composed of
the 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of each suit. This game involves the concept of "trump".
Trump, if you are unaware, is a suit which is named by a player and which is the most powerful
suit in that round of the game.

    Players play as two teams, with partners sitting across from each other. It is illegal
discuss the content of your hand with your partner, however.

@{b}@{i}Set Up@{ui}@{ub}

    Each player is dealt a five card hand. (Note: traditionally, Euchre hands are dealt in
"clumps" -- that is the dealer deals 3 cards to the player to his left, 2 to the player
opposite him, 3 to the player to his right, and 2 to himself; and then deals 2-3-2-3 around
the table to fill out the hand. After the cards are dealt, the remaining four cards are
placed on the table in the middle of all the players. The top card of the leftover cards is
played face up.

@{b}@{i}Trump@{ui}@{ub}

    Players will then begin the trump-determining process by examining their hand and
determining their strengths. The player to the left of the dealer begins this process.
If the card laying face up is the suit he wants to call trump he may tell the dealer to pick
up the card. The dealer must then pick up the top card, and discard any card of his choice.
If the first player doesn't feel that the suit in the top card is what he wants, he passes,
and the next player then has the opportunity to tell the dealer to pick up or pass. This
continues until either a player has called trump or the first player is up again. If everyone
passes on the face up card, the player to the dealer's left may then call any of the three
remaining suits or pass to the next player. If this round goes all the way to the dealer, and
he doesn't call anything, players toss in their cards and the deal passes to the left.
(There is a variant which forces the dealer to call trump when this happens.)

@{b}@{i}Play@{ui}@{ub}

    Play now begins by the player to the dealers left playing (called 'leading') a card of
his choice. Each of the other players (in turn) must then play a card in response. They
@{b}must@{ub} follow the suit which was led if they can, but if they cannot, then
they are free to play any other card in their hand. This is where trump comes into play.
If you play trump, and all other players play the suit that was led, you win! If you play
trump and someone else also plays trump, then the person who played the higher trump card wins.
The player playing the highest card wins, and then leads any card of his choice. (These rounds
are called 'tricks') If the team who called trump wins 3 of the 5 tricks, they win one point.
If they take all 5 tricks, they get 2 points. If the team who did @{b}not@{ub} call trump takes
3 or more tricks, they get 2 points. This is called a 'euchre.'

    If you think that you have an extremely strong hand, you can go alone and your partner
will sit this hand out. If you take all 5 tricks, you win 3 (some play 4) points. If you take
3 tricks, you only get one point, and if you get euchred, the other team gets 2 points.

    The first team to get 10 points wins. (You don't have to get exactly 10.)

@{b}@{i}Card Values@{ui}@{ub}

    This is where it gets a little interesting. The value of the cards increase from 9 to
Ace, except in the trump suit. The trump suit value is as follows:

    9, 10, Queen, King Ace, Jack, Jack.

    What!?! Two Jacks!?! Yes! The Jack from the suit of the same color as the trump suit is
considered to be of the trump suit for that hand. For example:

    If Spades are trump, the order of increasing card values is as follow:

        9 Spades, 10 Spades, Queen Spades, King Spades, Ace Spades, Jack @{b}Clubs@{ub}, Jack Spades.

    The order of increasing card values in clubs suit with spades as trump will be:

        9 clubs, 10 clubs, Queen clubs, King clubs, Ace clubs. (The jack is considered spade!)

This means that if spades are led, you have a jack of clubs and 4 hearts you must play the jack
of clubs.

    The jacks of the trump suit are know as the "bowers." In the above example, the jack of
clubs is called the "right bower" and the jack of spades is the "left bower."

@{b}@{i}Strategy@{ui}@{ub}

    I'm not going go on forever on this, I'll let you figure things out yourself. Here's a few
guidelines:

    -Always count on your partner to take one trick. (This will get you a point more often than
        it will get you euchred.)

    -Your trump won't get you euchred, your other stuff (know as "grey areas") will. The fewer
        different suits in your hand, the stronger it is.

    -Never trump your partners Ace- unless it's already been trumped or you have nothing else
        in your hand to play (or you "got a feeling..")

    -don't forget Jacks can be either of two suits! This is especially important when calling
        trump!

    -if you have nothing to lead, lead your worst card and hope your partner can do something
        good with it (known as a "handoff")

    -if you have the first lead in the game, don't lead trump (unless that's all you have)
        true, you will pull trump out of your opponents hands, but you will also pull it out
        of your partners hand

    -if your partner calls trump and you have high trump in your hand, use it as soon as
        possible ("Trump Early, Trump Hard")

@node GAMEPLAY "Game Play"


    To start, select "New Game" from the "Euchre!" menu. The computer will then deal each
player a five card hand. (The dealer is chosen randomly.) The dealer is the player who has
the face up card sitting in front of his hand. The first round of trump selection will then
begin. To have the dealer pick up the card, press the "Pick Up" gadget. If you really feel
good about your hand, you can go alone by clicking "Alone." This gadget is a toggle, so you
can change your mind if you want. The dealer will then pick up the card and discard one from
his hand. If you dealt, after pressing "Pick Up," click on the card you wish to discard, and
the face up card will take it's place in your hand.

    If everyone passes on the first round of trump selection, you may then pick any of the
remaining suits (if it gets to you!) by clicking on the appropriate gadget. Note that the
suit of the face up card is ghosted and cannot be selected. Once again, you can go alone by
clicking the appropriate gadget. The gadget is a toggle, so you can change your mind.

    Game play then starts with the player to the dealers left leading a card. If that is you,
just click on the card you wish to play. The card isn't actually played until you release the
mousebutton, so if you change your mind, just move the mouse off of the card and release. Then,
click on the card you do wish to play. (NOTE: Mouse clicks are buffered, so an errant click may
result in a card play which was not intended!)

    The winner of the first trick will lead the next, and so forth. You must follow suit, as will
the computer players.

    On the far right, you see the status section. This will tell you how many tricks each side has
taken at the top, the score at the bottom, the trump suit in the upper middle section, and who called
trump in the lower middle section.

    The game is played until one side gets ten points. To start a new game after that, just
Pick "New Game" again.

@node SETTINGS "Settings"


    From the settings editor, you can change the following things:

    Computer playing style: Either CONSERVATIVE, MODERATE, or RISKY.

        @{u}CONSERVATIVE@{uu}: won't call trump unless he has a very strong
                      hand. Leads high trump always, will always try
                      to take a trick unless he's last and his partner
                      has it.

                      Good for the Euchre beginner.

        @{u}MODERATE@{uu}:     doesn't need to have as strong of a hand when he
                      calls trump. Tends to lead high trump, but not as
                      a rule. Won't trump his partners Ace unless he has
                      to.

        @{u}RISKY@{uu}:        sometimes calls things that make you think the programmer
                      was on drugs. Tends to not lead trump, but will in the
                      later stages of a hand. Won't take it if his partner has
                      a decent shot at taking the trick.

    Each of the computer players can have their playing style set individually.

    Player 1 is to your left, Player 2 is your partner, and Player 3 is to your
    right.


    @{u}Loner Value@{uu}: loners can be either 3 or 4 points. I've played both ways, but
                 3 is my preference personally (and the default)

    @{u}End Early@{uu}:   if this is on, when  one side takes 3 tricks, and the other also takes
                 one, the hand will end. There is no point in going on, because it is
                 impossible to get more than one point in this situation.
                 Default is off.

    @{u}Play Speed@{uu}:  to give this game a nice pace, I have coded Delay() statements into it.
                 This will give you the opportunity to alter the delay times. Experiment
                 to find the speed you prefer.

    @{u}Save@{uu}:   Save the changes permanently. This will also cause the new settings to take
            effect immediately.

    @{u}Use@{uu}:    Use the new settings now, but don't save them to disk. The settings will revert
            to the previously saved ones the next time the program is started.

    @{u}Cancel@{uu}: No changes will be made to the current settings.

    These settings are stored in a file called Euchre.config. It is a text file, but don't
    mess with it. Use the settings editor from the menu. You have been warned!

@endnode

@node TODO "To Do"

On my "To Do" list...............

-check into possible problems with AFS

-improve menu handling

-clear buffer of errant mouse clicks so card plays are handled better

-loner calling for computer players

-sound effects

-use datatypes to show game images. not only will this allow for use of
    custom cards, it will also shrink the size of the executable as well
    as reducing the amount of chip mem used (this will change the OS requirement
    to OS 3.x)

-as I become aware of more variations of the game, I will incorporate them into the settings

        Known Variations:
        ----------------

        -screw the dealer
        -11 pt. game
        -the "benny"
        -if dealers partner has dealer pick up trump, he must go alone
        -oppose loners alone, 4pts for a Euchre on this!

=========================================================================================================

Assorted BS (Biographical Stuff -- not what you were thinking, potty mouth!! :)

    I started to learn C programming in April, 1996 using the Kernighan and Ritchie book.
Given my total lack of experience in programming at the time, I soon gave up on this book.
Then, I found "The New C Primer Plus" from the Waite Group, and found that to be an
excellent book for the rank novice. Everything is very well explained in plain language, and
the book follows a logical structure in starting from very basic concepts and increasing the
the complexity gradually enough so as not to be overwhelming. Yes, I liked this book!

    I have also relied heavily on the RKM's (I think I've worn out some of the pages in
the Libraries book from flipping back and forth!) to learn how to apply C to the Amiga.
I even have one of the few surviving copies of the Style Guide!

    About two thirds of the way through this project, I began reading "Code Complete" by Steve
McConnell. This book made quite a difference in my coding style! All of a sudden, my source code
is much more readable and lucid! Imagine, actually planning out how you write a program instead
of just typing it in........

    I am a high school band director and trumpet player, I play lead trumpet in a semi-pro
dance band. I am also a 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do and teach the art in the Buffalo
Tae Kwon Do Club.

    Part of the reason for the length of time this has taken to get released is the fact that
in New York state, you must have a Masters degree in a field related to your major field to
be permanently certified to teach. I just finished my degree in May '98. Prior to that, I spent
most of my free time in pursuit of that goal. Now that it is done, I have jumped back into the
development of Euchre!
