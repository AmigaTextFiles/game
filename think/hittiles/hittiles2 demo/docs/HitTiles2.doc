HIT TILES 2 is a game based on the wellknown oriental game called Shanghai. It
consists of 15 levels, each one featuring a screen made up of 120 tiles placed
in piles up to 4 high. In every screen there are 4 of each tile. The aim of the
game is to remove all of the tiles from the screen. The main and only rule you
have to keep in mind is this: You can only remove 2 equals tiles at a time ad
both must have an empty place on either the left or the right hand side.
