                  This program is Freeware !


New features of Version III:
----------------------------

This is an improved version of the game China Challenge. The original program
by Dirk Hoffmann lacked some features and disturbed the mutitasking heavily.
China Challenge III - short called CC3 - is a completly rewritten version of
the old program. CC2 was written in 'C' but CC3 had been written in assembler
for shortness.

Below all changes made since release 2:

 Fixed:	The busy wait loop for menu handling has been removed. Also the dircet
	hardware access to control the mouse events has been removed. Now the
	event handling belongs to commodores programming guidelines. It is
	totally multitasking friendly.

 Fixed:	The two-screen technique has been removed. CC3 uses an invisible screen
	for its graphic rendering. Then the blitter moves the whole date to the
	real screen.

 New:	The sound replay uses now the audio device instead of directly hitting
	the hardware. The sound file is NOT nessecary to play the game unlike
	in CC2. There exists a menu item 'Play Music' so you can switch the
	music on or off. If the sound stuff couldn't be initialized the item
	is anavailable. Music play can be controlled at startup see below.

 New:	The intro picture has been included in the program. When CC3 starts
	this picture will be displayed and all other initilization stuff
	follows. If you don't want this picture you can switch it off at
	startup see below.

 New:	CC3 supports two CLI and Workbench arguments to control the program
	at startup.

	 NOMUSIC - This argument disables the music. However CC3 tries to
		   initialize its audio stuff and to load the sample. If this
		   fails the music is disabled during the whole game play.
		   Otherwise only the sound output is disabled so you can
		   switch the music on later. By default the music is on.

	 NOINTRO - This argument disables the intro picture. By default you
		   will see this picture and all initialization stuff is done
		   at this time. This picture shall only show CC3 is alive
		   while loading the sample from a floppy disk. If you don't
		   want the picture suppress it with this argument.

	NOTE:	When started from workbench CC3 needs the 'icon.library' to
		examine the tooltypes. If the library couldn't be opened it
		will use its internal defaults. With the kick 1.2/1.3 icon
		library the equation sign '=' at the end of a tooltype is
		nessecary !!!

 New:	For loading and saving the filerequester of the arp.library is used
	now. So you need this library installed in libs: to use these option
	but this shouldn't cause any propblems I hope.
	Please note that the file structure of a saved game has changed. It is
	no longer an ascii file because the current game state is also saved.
	This was easier to do when saving an binary. Sorry about this.

 New:	The generation of a dragon is much improved. The new algorithm requires
	always only 120 random numbers instead of about 500 as the old one did.
	So it can be estimate that it is faster than before. The random number
	generator has also changed. Now CC3 uses the Tausworth algorithm for
	creating the random numbers. The full description of this algorithm can
	be found in:

		"A Comparision of the Correlation Behavior of Random Number
		 Generators for the IBM 360"
		Communication of the ACM 11/1968 page 641-644


I want to thank Dirk Hoffmann for the original program and Torsten "Stoffel"
Christophel for his suggestion to improve the dragon generation to make it
really random.

New features of Version II:
---------------------------

1) If you look at the Options Menu, you can see two new items:
   b) Load Dragon:
      With this option, you can load a saved dragon. The
      input window will appear. Type in the filename of the
      saved dragon. If this file exists, China Challenge
      will load the dragon into memory and displays it on
      the screen.
   b) Save Dragon:
      With this option, you can save the current dragon on
      the screen to disk. After you activate "Save Dragon",
      the Workbenchscreen will appear with a small window on
      it. Just type the name of the Dragon's data file.
      The Playscreen comes up again and you can continue
      with another game.

2) In the first Version, you can only take back one move,
   but the wrong pair is mostly taken many moves before.
   In China Challenge II, you can take back every move you
   did without any restrictions.

3) China Challenge II now plays a little background music
   during the game. Enjoy it...


About China Challenge

China Challenge is quite similar to the well known game Shanghai or
Mahjong. Target of China Challenge is, to remove all parts of the pile, the
so called Dragon, step by step. This dragon is composed out of 120
different pieces. You can always find four chips displaying the same
picture or chinese symbols. As the pile can't be removed indiscriminately,
there are certain rules allowing the removal of tiles.
First, you only can remove pairs of tiles wit the same image or picture on
its surfaces.
Second, the chips you want to take away must not have another piece to
their right or to their left. That means, both tiles have to be free and
without any "neighbor". If you already have played Shanghai, you surely
know the rules, because they are completely equal.

After loading and starting China Challenge, the screen gets black for a
short time and the first dragon appears. All 120 tiles have been shuffled
and placed onto the pile. Now you can select a piece by clicking on a tile
with the mouse pointer. If you have choosen a tile that was free, its
counterpart is shown in the left box. Now you can select a second tile. If
the second tile displays the same image or picture, it will be copied to
the box at the right border of the playscreen. Doubleclicking the second
icon means the removal of both tiles.
If you have taken away all chips from the dragon, you can continue with a
new shuffled one, perhaps with an increased difficulty level.

By using the pull down menus, you can select following functions:

About:  A small information window appears 
Quit:   Exit China Challenge, this means back to AmigaDos

New Game: Starts current game over and builts up a new shuffled dragon
Undo last move: Takes back the last move you did
Undo all moves: Rebuilts the same dragon a second time
Load Dragon: Loads a saved dragon from disk
Save Dragon: Saves the currently displayed dragon to disk
Play Music: Enables or disables the game music


                          Enjoy this game and not your pirate copies...
