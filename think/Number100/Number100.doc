 Introduction
--------------

    Number 100 is a simple guessing game, the idea is to guess the number
the computer is thinking, for added fun i've enclueded a Lowscore the idea
of the low score is to see who can guess the number in the lowest amount of
guess's, if your amount of guess's is less than the lowest score so far
you'll be asked to enter your name, and your the Lowest Lowscore :)

 Instructions
--------------

    After you've passed the title screen, help screen and the lowscore
screen the game begins. What you have to do is enter a number, and the
computer will then tell you weather the number you entered is lower or
higher than the number it's thinking. There is a lowscore to see who can
guess the answer in the lowest amount of guessing, if you do your score is
saved. The number is between 0 and 100.

 Installing
------------

    This game is very easy to install, all you have to do is copy Number100
into any draw and Lowscore into the S: directory you need the lowscore
otherwise the game won't work.

 Future
--------

    Already i have been playing around with new ideas and i haven't even
uploaded it yet, well my plans are to make it customized so you can pick
your own numbers between say 1 and 10 or 50 and 250 i am also thinking of
doing one that will take ages to complete like a range from 0 to 100000
and see how many goes it take's to do that :)

 Comments
----------

    This version is the very first release to anyone other than myself, so
please send comments, ideas and genral help, if you do you'll be put in the
credits and thanked gratefully.

 Tips
------
 
    It's best guessing 50 at the start then go up or down in 10's depending
on weather it's higher or lower than 50 then once you found it's between
say 70 & 80 do 75 thats the quickest way to find the number out.
    There is a hiscore and name editor which you can get from me if you
want to cheat. Just send an email, to Nicron and ask.
