Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

Put the executable and its icon somewhere. That's it.

~~~

To guess the hidden colour code (correct colours in the correct

How to play
~~~~~~~~~~~

Just in case there is someone on this planet who doesn't know how to
play this:

Choose a colour by selecting a colour gadget (the current colour will
be displayed). Put that colour in one or more of the locations
starting at the bottom row. When you have filled the four locations,
choose CHECK to mark your attempt. You then move up to the next row
and try other colours/locations.

A screen flash means none of your colours are present in the hidden
code.

A black marker means correct colour in correct location (you don't
know which, you must use your powers of deduction).

A white marker means correct colour in an incorrect location (again,
you don't know which).

The position of the markers (if any) has no bearing on correct or
incorrect colours.


Gadgets

CHECK = as above

NEW   = new game

QUIT  = duh!
