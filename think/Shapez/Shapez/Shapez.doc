Shapez V1.1 - by NC.Gamez
This is just another one of thoose stupid puzzlegames. Not as 
original as Tetris, but far more fun than school (-:



THE GAME CONCEPT:

You have got a row of blocks in the top left cornor of the sc-
reen. Select one of them, and paste it anywhere possible on the 
screen. It may be rotated with your right mousebutton.   The idea 
is to fill the empty parts of the area, and then enter next le-
vel.

AND... WHAT DOES ONE HAVE TO PAY?

ALOT!   Well, if You want the full levelset - not just ten levels 
as in this version - send us... Eh... £5 (or if possible 50 SEK).
   The new levels are not as pretty or as complex as the one You
have got now, which is to say that the game will become a bit
tougher!
   Send money and other gifts to:
   NC.Gamez, Stigbergsgatan 4, 312 40 Genevad, Sweden

THE BUNCH:

Programming by Marcus 'Mopz' Johansson - Amos
Graphics by Mopz - Personal Paint
Titlemusic by Göran 'Maze' Nilsson - Pro Tracker
