 Twister is very nice Rubik's Cube simulator using MUI.
 This is a beta version. The drawing algorithm is
 very slow, so only a 68020+fpu executable is included.
 It will be optimized a lot in the future and 68000
 version will be available. No solving algorithm is
 ready yet. This first version only simulates a
 2x2x2 up to 7x7x7 Rubik's cube.
 
 I plan to suport other 3D puzzles such as Skewb,
 Tetrahedron, Octahedron and MasterBall.
 So if anyone can give me some information
 (color setups, available moves, form) on these
 (or other) puzzles, please do. Don't bother telling
 me if you find any bugs, it's only a beta and I
 know there are many of them.
