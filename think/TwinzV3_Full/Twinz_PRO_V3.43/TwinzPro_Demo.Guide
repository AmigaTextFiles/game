                Welcome to the Twinz AmigaGuide file.

I hope that I have made this guide as simple as possible to follow. It
           is my first real attempt at creating such a doc.

Here are the options that you may be able to choose from, depending on
                       how nice the Amiga is :

                        About Extreme AMOS !!
                        ---------------------

    @{"Extreme AMOS" link "ABOUT_EA" 0} is a disk magazine that me and a friend set up a few months
ago. Since then, the friend has left the team due to technical reasons. EA
is a disk magazine which I hope to dedicate almost entirely to AMOS and AMOS
related matters. EA runs in accordance with Mushroom PD, my PD library, as
well as an AMOS section recently started on the internet by Paul Burkey.

    At the moment, there are 2 @{"Freeware" link "SHAREWARE" 0} version of EA out in the PD, and
these are available from me at the library by either sending me a cheque for
£1, or the equivalent in stamps, or you could send an SAE and 2 GOOD
formatted disks (I am sick of people sending me floppy disks with more
read/write errors than a politician in the conservative party !!) for each
@{"shareware" link "SHAREWARE" 0} issue you wish to receive.

    I am trying to put together a third, big @{"freeware" link "SHAREWARE" 0} issue, packed full of
extremely usefull AMOS articles, ranging from programming diaries, to hints
and tips, as well as source code.

    @{"Extreme AMOS" link "ABOUT_EA" 0} is designed to be of use to YOU, not us. Without  your
input, we cannot decide what we should and should not include  in future
issues. We need to know exactly what kind of things you would like to see in
the magazine, plus, if you want to, you can have a go  at writing your own
articles for inclusion immediately.

    All articles we receive will be included in the magazine, providing we
can fit them into somewhere on the disk. We are always looking for  new
article types to add, especially on the programming bits, as we are always
needing tutorials, as well as someone who is going to program a game, and is
going to release it along with it's source code, as  @{"FREEWARE" link "SHAREWARE" 0} or @{"SHAREWARE" link "SHAREWARE" 0},
as we need a programming diary to help out  those gamers who get stuck on
things like joystick operations. If you  think you can help us out, then why
not get in touch with me, telling  me about the game, and what kind of
tutorial you wish to do. Then,  you can begin working on your game, and send
me parts of the tutorial  each month, with example programs + files
required, so the reader  can build up the program as the editions pass.
Issue 3 is now available for you to own as freeware.

    Have you written a new game, and would like it reviewed? Send us a copy
of your game, along with several IFF screenshots of the gameplay, as for the
next issue, I intend to perfect my IFF/Text reader, so  screenshots can be
made available. Alternatively, why not send an IFF  screenshot to advertise
the game or utility you have written? Adverts  up to certain parameters are
FREE, so try and squeeze your piccy into either a 320x256 image, using no
more than 64 colours, or a 640x256 using no more than 16 colours. Any other
screen modes are a bit unsure, due to the amount of space they could take
up. If you want a larger ad included, then send me a few AMOS articles for
inclusion, or if you don't have any, then send a stamp or something.

    Do you really hate someones guts? Do you want to give someone a  very
special thank-you, or just to say hello? You can now do that  using our
messages service. Write out your advert as an ASCII file,  in the same style
as the messages in this edition. Then, send it  to me at @{"Mushroom PD" link "ABOUT_MPD" 0} for
inclusion in the next issue. This service,  along with the adverts service,
is restricted to people who have sent  articles in to me, unless you bribe
me with a second class stamp !!! The message can be to anyone else, of
course, and can contain any kind of language, providing it is not too vulgar
!!

    All letters recieved will be looked at, and replied to accordingly.  All
mail will be sent in the form of an ASCII file on a disk, so if  you have
any problems with this, then please say so in your letter.  Thank-you for
your time and patience. I hope that you enjoy reading  the rest of this
AmigaGuide. Cheers to Paul Burkey for Smoothguide.

                     Another great disk magazine
                    -----------------------------

    Another great AMOS related disk magazine to look out for is WAC  (it
stands for Whitby AMOS Club), and is run by a great friend of  mine, Paul
Gumsley.

    At the moment, the eighth issue is under construction, but there  are
several shareware versions available. WAC is also licenceware,  with
versions available from Saddletramps PD, as well as 5th dimension  PD. If
you do not have the address, then you can contact the man  directly. Include
a first class stamp, and he will be delighted to  send you a shareware
version. Please tell him your computer setup, and  tell him that Mushroom
sent you !! Here's that address :

                          Paul Gumsley (MPD)
                            5 Lockton Road
                                Whitby
                           North Yorkshire
                               YO21 3NB
                               ENGLAND

    WAC is a great read, and a few of my articles appear there as  well. I
highly reccomend it. The continuation of WAC is now dead, and only
back-issues are available from Paul.

@node "ABOUT_MPD" "About Mushroom PD"
                        What is Mushroom PD?
                       ----------------------

    Mushroom PD is a PD library dedicted entirely to AMOS. I set it up  in
February 1995, as I found it difficult to get hold of some good  AMOS source
code without having to pay lagre prices.

    The main intention of the library when set up, was to provide  people
with source code and programs, for as little cash as possible.  Disks from
the library cost from a pound, including P+P, and you do  not have to pay
20-odd pounds a year just to be a member, as  membership is FREE. The
library also has a disk credit system, which  means that for every disk that
you send me, then this credit goes up  by one. This enables you to 35p off a
disk, for the number of credits,  when it comes to ordering something from
the library. This is helpfull to you if you send a lot of disks in, as you
will be saving lots of money when it comes to ordering new stuff (if you
want to).

    Ordering things from the library has never been as simple to do.  If you
want source code, just state the section, and all contents  will be mailed
to you. If you want to order a Mushroom disk, you just  give the disk
number, and if you want to order a registered program, just state it's name
and a cheque covering the full asking price.

    The library is split up into several parts, the main two being  the
source code section, and the Mushroom Disk section.

    The source code section is split up into lots of different categorys, so
that the user has lots of choice when it comes down to acquiring new code.
Some of the code I receive is entered into the Extreme AMOS coverdisks. New
sections are being added to the library all the time, so let me know what
kind of programming routines you are looking for.

    The Mushroom disk section is for AMOS and AMOS-Related material, which
comes "As-Is" so to speak. This mainly consists of music demos at the
moment, providing purchasers with a whole array of music to use in their own
games. Each music demo comes with it's own program to play the modules.
There are also games and utilities in the library, covering lots of
different subjects. All of which have been written in AMOS. A lot of the
disks contain several utilities or games, which are listed in the Mushroom
disk list. @{"Extreme AMOS" link "ABOUT_EA" 0} has a system which allows you to read a review of
the latest Mushroom disks. Full lists are available from me at Mushroom PD.
How it works, is if I get sent loose programs, or there is a bit of room on
the end of a disk, then I stick the program on it to give the user a bit
more value for their money. All mushroom disks are @{"Shareware" link "SHAREWARE" 0} or @{"Freeware" link "SHAREWARE" 0},
and can be distributed over any means providing no more than one pound is
charged.

    Amiga Computing said that Mushroom PD claims to be the second  largest
AMOS-only PD library in the country. This, is not true at  the moment, and I
do not know where they got that comment from. I have  loads of AMOS stuff
which is still unsorted, but I daresay that  someone has more AMOS stuff
than me. It's nice to know they are  thinking of me, anyway !!

    If you have any AMOS programs lying around, or if you are a  programmer
yourself and want some of your games etc. to be distributed, then why not
send them to me. For every disk you send of code that I  do not have, you
can exchange it for something else in the library,  or you can add the no.
of disks to your disktotal, enabling 35p off  each order. Alternatively, you
can exchange your programs for stuff in the library that you don't already
have. Just state the Mushroom Disk number when ordering.

    All letters received will be replied to as soon as I can. I will  reply
to you as an ASCII file on disk, so if you have any problems  with this then
let me know in your letter. The address for Mushroom PD is on the @{"Register" link "REGISTER" 0}
screen. Thank-you for reading this piece of text.

@node "BONUSTILES" "Twinz Bonus Tiles"
                          Twinz Bonus Tiles
                          -----------------

    Whilst playing, you may select 2 bonus tiles, causing the computer to
randomly select a bonus to give to you. These are the choices available in
the Shareware version of Twinz :

                           Add 5,000 points
                         Deduct 5,000 points
                  Add up to double your current time
                 Deduct up to half your current time
                   Take you to the end of the level
                           Reset your score
                           Reset your time
                           Not do anything

           The full version boasts many new bonus options!

    The computer flashes across the screen the bonus it is going to use. If
the computer decides not to choose a bonus, then only the "BONUS PAIR" will
move up the screen. If you have any interesting  suggestions for new bonus
tiles, or any other part of the game, or  maybe an idea for a totally new
game, then why not write to me at  @{"Mushroom PD" link "ABOUT_MPD" 0}.

                         Programming credits
                        ---------------------

     Here is the bit where I get the opportunity to thank all the
      people who have helped me out in the making of this game.

  Firstly, I want to say a great big thanx to Paul Burkey, of Daisy
    software, for all his support in encouraging me to finish this second
demo. After I lost the source for the first version of Twinz, I didn't think
I could improve it much !! Thanks also for the use of the
 E-Mail number at @{"Mushroom PD" link "ABOUT_MPD" 0}, along with letting me use some of the tiles
from "Piles'O'Tiles". Read the second issue of @{"Extreme AMOS" link "ABOUT_EA" 0} for
 more information on acquiring this amazing game. A shareware version
                    is available from @{"Mushroom PD" link "ABOUT_MPD" 0}.

 Thanks also go out to my cat, Millie, who kept me alert, knicking my
                beef paste butties every 2 minutes.

                  Music in this demo was written by
                        Mahoney - Title music
                      Paul Burkey - Ingame music

     Sorry for the lack of lots of samples. I tried to make this
             demonstration version as small as possible.

  I would like to give a great big thank-you to all the people whos artwork
I have shredded up in order to produce some of the tiles. The full version's
list is in the demo, but the known graphic artists for
                        the demo version are :

                      Andrew "Mushroom" Kellett
                             Paul Burkey
                             Asa Margetts
                             Gary Hoyles
                              E.W. Clay

                                 BSM

 As with any game or utility, there are always playtesters. I have to hand
it out to these guys and gals, as they have played this game for
   hours, especially Sarah and Michelle. Here is the complete list:

                          Twinz Distribution
                          ------------------

    Because this game is @{"Shareware" link "SHAREWARE" 0}, it may be distributed amongst all
possible means of media transfer, providing no more than £1.50 is charged
for duplication costs. It is freely distributable across the internet, and
on CD compilation. It MUST be accompanied by ALL the needed files, including
this doc file.

    If the program is used on a CD compilation, I would be gratefull  if the
compiler notified me of this, plus, I wouldn't mind a free copy  if you have
some knocking around !!

    If this program finds it's way abroad, then I hope you can use it, as it
was programmed in PAL mode. Is there a program available which  allows PAL
stuff to work on NTSC ?

    If a PD library wishes to distribute this product via their  librarys,
then I would be gratefull if you notified me of the disk  number etc. This
is for my future reference, and you need not send me  anything else.

@node "INSTRUCTIONS" "Playing Twinz"
                            Playing Twinz
                            -------------

    The instructions for playing Twinz are extremely simple. Providing you
have the right set-up, you should have no problems. On the title screens and
menus, simply click the mouse on the option that you wish to select. If the
bar is selectable, then the option will be chosen. Note that Hard Drive
users can @{"install Twinz" link "REQUIRE" 0} on their hard disks with extreme simplicity.

    Selecting VIEW CREDITS will display all the @{"program credits" link "CREDITS" 0} on the
screen. These include who helped me write it etc. Pressing the mouse button
at any time will return you back to the title screen, as will letting the
credits run to the end.

    The same goes for the hiscores. The top 50 players are listed, starting
with the highest scorer first. The best level scores etc. are then listed,
and you can leave at any time by pressing the mouse button.

    When you click on the OPTIONS bar, you are presented with several
screens which allow you to control various aspects of the game you are
playing. In the shareware version, these are :

  *  You are able to the difficulty level of your game
  *  You can choose one of four boards (on the demo version)
  *  You can have either sound FX or music
  *  You can have tile turbo activated/de-activated

    Tile turbo is a small feature I decided to keep in the program as I was
developing it. In source mode, the tiles were very slow at drawing on the
screen, so I cut most of the loops out, and in the compiled version, decided
to leave it in, so gameplay can be more frantic !!!

    The challenge mode for Twinz is only aavilable in the @{"registered" link "REGISTER" 0}
@{"version" link "REGISTER" 0}. See the appropriate section for more information.

    When playing the game, you are presented with a screen of boxes. To
select a tile, simplay click the left mouse button in the box you wish to
"Turn over". Select a second box in the same manner. If the two tiles are
the same, then they will stay on the screen, and your Score and Time will be
increased. If the 2 tiles don't match up, then they will be turned back
over, ready for the next pair to be selected.

    The tile underneath do not change unless you have selected a Bonus tile.
See the appropriate section for more information.

    If the 2 tiles are both question marks, then you have selected a
@{"Bonus Pair" link "BONUSTILES" 0} of tiles. These range from zipping to the end of the level, to
re-arranging the board, or adding Time or Points to your current totals.

    In order to complete each level, you must pair off all the tiles. Note
that the Bonus Tiles need not be paired off in order for you to complete
each level. All points are added up, depending on the amount of Time that
you have left, and the skill of difficulty that you have selected.

    You then get the opportunity to take part in a bonus level, which ranges
from a complex layout of tiles on a grid, to an on-screen puzzle, such as a
picture sort. If you are in challenge mode, you can gain more time for
playing with, and in any other difficulty, you just get the points. You play
the bonus, until you either complete it, or you run out of time. You will
then return back to normal play.

    This gameplay carries on until you run out of time, or the computer ends
the number of games chosen. Pressing the QUIT button will reset your score,
eliminating you from getting your name in the High Score Table, so don't
think that you can play and quit out !!

  In-Game keys
  ------------

   P - Will pause the game, and bring up a small scroller giving a bit
       more information to the player on the Registered Version of
       Twinz. Pressing either the mouse button, or any key will return
       you back to playing mode without affecting your game.

   Q - Will quit the current game and return you to the title screen,
       resetting your score.

  All hiscores and level best scores are automatically saved to the disk
when they are changed, so make sure that the disk is write-enabled. Note
that on the demo version of Twinz, the saving of any hiscores is disabled,
so hurry and register while you can !!

                  ---------------------------------

    So, have you been enticed into supporting this @{"shareware" link "SHAREWARE" 0} programmer?
Great !! First, let me tell you a bit on what you get when you register:

 * You will get a cash amount knocked off the price of any other
   games of mine you register to. All registered users of my games are
   logged down, so there can be no cheating !!!

 * You will receive the latest @{"shareware" link "SHAREWARE" 0} version of @{"Extreme AMOS" link "ABOUT_EA" 0}, a
   disk magazine that I run, dedicated mainly to AMOS programmers,
   both begginer and expert, with a few articles that are non-AMOS.

 * Plus, any demos of current games and utilities that I am working
   on. These will differ depending on when you register.

    If you do not wish to receive any of the above extras (apart from the
price off) then please say so in your letter. If you don't have a printer,
then you can send your letter in ASCII format on a floppy disk, or
alternatively, you can E-Mail me, with any messages, letters, stuff, and
bugs that you have found in Twinz. If you just want a general chat about
AMOS, then get in touch with me, and I would be happy to help you out with
any problems, or join onto your AMOS contacts list. If you are interested in
writing articles for @{"Extreme" link "ABOUT_EA" 0} @{"AMOS" link "ABOUT_EA" 0}, then also get in touch with me at the

                            --------------------

    In order to play the game correctly, you will need the following
equipment :

                     An Amiga (Der?)
                     A copy of Twinz
                     1Mb minimum of memory
                     A mouse
                     A Hard Drive (Optional)

    In your LIBS: drawer, you will need the MATHTRANS.LIBRARY file. If you
wish to install Twinz to your hard drive, just copy the executable and the
DATA drawer to your games directory, or wherever you wish to place it, and
make sure the libraries needed are in the LIBS: drawer. The game should then
run when you double click on the executable.

Let me tell you a little story :

    'Bill and Ben are 2 friends, who both own an A600. Bill has lots of cash
and is always buying games from the top shelves, where as Ben is not so
rich. One day, Bill came round to Bens house for a good gaming session.
"Cor, this shoot-em-up is amazing!! Which shop did you get it from? I shall
have to go out and buy this!" said Bill. "The game is free" said Ben. "It's
a shareware game, so all you need to pay for is a blank disk". "Are you
serious?" asked Bill. Ben then explained the principles of PD and shareware,
and how Bill could save hundreds of pounds when it came to buying games'

    Shareware is a whole new concept of programmers work being flooded into
the computer market, by new and un-heard of programmers, plus it is
available for no more than the price of a blank disk. Shareware now allows
programmers to create their own work, and have someone from the public pay
them for an upgrade of their program.

    Unlike the Sega and Nintendo machines, not to mention the newer
consoles, you have to pay as much as 50 pounds for the one game, only to get
bored of it within one hour, or complete it, therefore wasting 50 pounds.
Shareware allows you to get hold of a whole variety of this software,
ranging from extremely simple games, to mega shoot-em-up space games, as
well as some really powerfull utilities for the Amiga, and because they are
shareware, you just have to pay for the disk.

    With a shareware game, the programmer may cut all the good bits out of
it in order to entice you, or he/she may have a message that keeps popping
up with the address to register to. All these different annoying messages
will be removed, and all possible options will be activated ready for your
usage.

    Then, after playing the games for a while, the programmer will have an
offer where you send him/her a small amount of cash, and in return he/she
will send you a much improved version of the game, as well as other programs
that he/she has released onto the shareware market. The cash asked for
ranges between about 2 and 10 pounds, and is much cheaper than buying a
brand new game, and more of a range is always available. Now with the
internet and CD coming into light, the number of Shareware programs has
rocketed.

    Not all programs are shareware. There are other kinds of ware, including
Freeware, where you receive the whole program, and need not send any money
off, Giftware, Where you send the author and PD and shareware titles you
have written, or have lying around, instead of sending any cash off. All of
these forms are distributable, and no charge can be made for the programs,
unless for the cost of the media it is transferred onto.

    Remember, that if you buy a disk full of shareware products, you don't
own the actual programs on the disk, and you must keep to the shareware
rules.

    So when you see a shareware offer, think of the programmer. If  he/she
gets lots of registered users, then they will release better  games and
utilities into PD, so, before you go and buy a new game from  the arndale,
check out some of the shareware software first !!

                               What is Twinz?
                               --------------

    Twinz is a game I wrote a while ago on the trusty old Speccy 128,  and
upgraded to the Amiga using AMOS. It is a simple pairs game in  which you
must clear the board of tiles by pairing them off.

    At the end of each round, you get the opportunity to gain score or
points in a bonus round, which consists of anything from another tile
layout, to an on-screen puzzle.

    Depending on the difficulty level you select, the greater points  you
will score the harder the level. There are 4 levels, Easy, Medium,  Hard,
and challenge mode. The first three play for points, where as in  the
challenge mode, you play for time, increasing your overall limit  which is
constantly ticking away. You start the next level with the  time you had
from the end of the last level.

@node "OTHERTITLES" "Other Titles Available"
                        Other titles available
                        ----------------------

Here are some of the other titles I have available to buy. If there is  a
@{"shareware" link "SHAREWARE" 0} version of the program available, it is highlighted with a symbol
(*).

Card filer V1.8 *  ---------------

    This little utility store all personal details of any person you wish to
enter in to it. It takes name/address/phone/fax as well as the  other usual
entries, and a large notepad section for creating notes on  the individual.
If you have a photograph, you can even load it into  the record and save it
along with the entry. This program costs £5, but is available for £3 to any
registered user of my programs.

Telephone directory V3.0 * ------------------------

    A small program which stores the name and numbers of any person or
company. The whole thing is done via a CLI window to make the most use  out
of it. The program searches for either a name or number, so if you  can only
remember one of them, you will still be able to view the  record. To
register this version will cost you 2 pounds.

Extreme AMOS Issues 1 + 2 + 3 (both @{"Freeware" link "SHAREWARE" 0}) -----------------------------

    Extreme AMOS is an AMOS disk magazine I write. So far, there have  been
2 freeware releases, and providing I can gather enough articles together, I
will release a third big issue. Each issue comes on 2  disks, crammed with
source code, tutorials etc. and is available from  me at Mushroom PD. See
the EA section for details on acquiring  versions, as well as getting
involved. Issue 3 is available from Aminet and my homepages, so why not get
a copy and have a look! Alternatively, send an SAE and 2 disks labelled
"Extreme AMOS 3" and I will be happy to send it to you.

    In the library, there are loads of disks available. At the moment,  I
have lots of different music demos available, each packed with music. I
also have games and utilities from a whole array of programmers,  including
Paul Burkey, Gary Hoyles, Asa Margetts, Andrew Campbell,  Andy Cashmore, and
loads of others.

combination of graphics and articles works, and I have had nothing but good
comments back from it. Unpack the archives to your HD, and double-click on
the icon to set everything running. Couldn't be easier!

    If you have any AMOS programs you would like to include in the library,
then mail them to me in UUxT form to mpd@mushy-pd.demon.co.uk and I will be
happy to include them into the library for you. Remember to include all your
documentation, and the programs which go to the Mushroom disks sections are
PD, so ensure you don't mind your programs being spread.
