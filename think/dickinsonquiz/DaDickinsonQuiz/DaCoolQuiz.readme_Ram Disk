---------------------------------------------

Introduction: 

It was on a cold, rainy evening....I had nothing special to do,
so I tried to create a little quiz game. After two hours of coding
and debugging I finally got the base engine ready and the only
thing I else needed to do was creating a text file with questions...

...pooh! 116 questions for now. My questions aren`t very well,
please make it better!! See below for instructions.....


Cardware:

This game is cardware. Send me a postcard from your country/town...
thanks! If you cannot get postcards from your town why not drop
me an email or snailmail?


Requirements:

- An Amiga (it SHOULD work on all Amigas within ECS Amigas)
- 500kb free Chip memory
- NewInstaller for Installation
- OS2.0++


Installation:

Why not use the provided NewInstaller script? You can get
NewInstaller on Aminet (util/wb/NewInstaller) if you haven`t
got it already


Usage:

Simply doubleclick this ugly Da Cool Quiz icon and get ready for
some brain-blowing action!! You can leave the game by entering "END"
as a answer....


Add/Create your own questions for dA c00l QUiZ:

If my 116 questions are getting on your nerves...why not
add other questions or create a new questions file? Okay,
here are the most important things you should attend:

1) A questions file is build up as the following:

   Question
   answer
   Question
   answer
   Ques...
   ans...and so on
 
   So if you divide all lines of the final file then
   with 2 - you will get an integer without a decimal
   point! If you get a decimal piunt your file is 
   invalid!!

2) The answer mustn`t contain capital letters. Da Cool
   Quiz needs this for turning the case sensitivity off.
   "Amiga" as a answer would be illegal. Enter "amiga"
   instead. Without the ""`s of coz!
 
3) Finally here an example for a questions file:
  
   --- snip ---
   Who`s the author of Da Cool Quiz?
   andreas falkenhahn
   Am I allowed to ask you this question?
   no
   How much is the fish? 
   5 dollars
   --- snap ---

Now run Da Cool Quiz from CLI or create a script with the
following command line: 1> coolquiz.exe <your questions file>
