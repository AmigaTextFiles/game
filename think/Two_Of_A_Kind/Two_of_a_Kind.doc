  ================  Two of a Kind (c) 1994 Matthew Goode  ================



Two of a Kind is a FREEWARE game,   All of the coding, most of the graphics, and the
sound FX are the creation of Matthew Goode.  Some of the fonts used are not
the work of Matthew Goode, someone else did them.


Introduction
------------

When I was younger (and that was not that long ago) me and my mum use to play
a game with cards in which you had to discover as many pairs as you could.
Two of a Kind is a remake of that game (and the PD varients that are
available).


The Game
--------

Two of a Kind is play with a mouse plugged in the normal port.  First decide
how many people are playing then click on the appropriate Start button.  Then
you must decide the difficulty of the game (either easy, normal, or hard)
After this you will be asked to enter your name(s).  Once that is done the
game grid should appear.  Moving the pointer over the yellow squares will
turn that square purple.  Push the Left Mouse Button to reveal what is behind
that particular square.  Repeat the procedure on another square, if the
pictures are the same they will remain in view and you score will increase
by 1.  It will still be your turn if you are playing a friend.  If the
pictures behind the squares are different they will cover up again, if it
is a two player game then it will become the other players turn.  Continue
this procedure until all the pictures are revealed.

Things to note are      - the pictures will not change places, what is
                          behind a square at the beginning of the game
                          will behind that square at the end of the game.
                          (Though the arrangement is different for each new
                          game).

                        - The current player's name will be highlighted at the
                          bottom of the screen.

                        - The time the game has taken so far is displayed on
                          the lower half of the screen (it's quite small.)

                        - The point of the two player game is to get a higher
                          score than you opponent.  The point of the one
                          player game is the complete the game is the least
                          time, or least number of moves.

Upon completion of the game the computer will give you some information on
how you play, and who is the winner.  If you achieve a low score, or time
in the one player game your name will be entered into the appropriate hall
of fame.  If you want to keep you name there then don't forget to save the
scores by exiting the program at some point (press Esc).

When a pair is found pictures the will darken to show that but you may like
them to go totally black, if you want this select blacken from the option
screen.  The option screen will also allow you to change the size of the
pointer.  To save your preferences (including the default names) just exit
the program (via the Title screen or with Esc).  If you want to exit the
program without saving anything the press F10.

The hall of fame is saved on you SYS: drive.

The difference between the Easy, Normal, and Hard games is the size of the
game grid.  The default sizes are as follows;

        Easy    4 across and 4 down
        Normal  6 across and 5 down
        Hard    9 across and 6 down

It is possible customise these settings by changing the Tool Types in the
programs icon.  To do this select the Two_of_a_Kind icon and the select the
'Information' option from, either the Workbench menu if you have a v1.3
computer or from the Icon menu if you have v2.0 +, then change the required
tooltype to you own liking.  For example, if you would like the grid size of
easy level to be 8 across and 2 down then you would change the following;

        Easy=44

        to,

        Easy=82

For more info on tooltypes read you manual.

There are separate highscore tables for each difficulty level.  To cycle
through the current highscores use the right mouse button on the title screen
or press 'e' for the easy highscores, 'n' for the normal highscores, and 'h'
for the hard highscores.


Extras
------

This game was written on a 6 meg A1200.  I used my Techno Sound sound sampler
to record the idiotic SFX (and yes it is me using a funny voice).  Software
used includes Devpac 2.14, Mega ED, Deluxe Paint IV, and Mega Map.

Please email to me with any suggestions.
