                                 Thats new !

 Better GFX - You can use a scanning Picture now better. But it  is  now  in
 the  Interlace-Mode.  I  have  try  it  with  the HAM-Mode, but it was more
 complicated then other  Modes.  So  I  will  code  my  next  Programs  with
 BlitzBasic  2.  BB2  got  a  Support  -  AMOS not. Also support BB2 the new
 GFX-Modes of AA-Amigas. What I want more?

 This Time You will play with Money. You can load and save it - and last not
 least  You  can  manipulate it. All You must do is to make a ASCII-File and
 save it under "My_Money.mny". Dont forget ".mny". Dont set more then 4300 $
 in  this File for one Player! The first Number ist for Player 1 (thats You)
 and the second Number is the Computer. Use ever 4 Rows!  I  mean  (1000  or
 0050  or  8456).  See the Example in the GermanJack-Path! You must put Your
 File also in the same Path, because when you use another Path, the  Program
 will  this  ones use as the actually Directory and it will not find all the
 other Files for running the Program again after the next End.

 Now You can create your new Cards absolut simple, because the Program  load
 the  Cards as IFF-Picture in the Ram. But You must register yourself to use
 this Option. Also the Program will find a manipulated Cardset, if  You  try
 to  change the original Cardset. So let register yourself. It is simple and
 cheap.

 The Program support now Multitasking. But the  only  Way  back  from  other
 Screens is to use the left Amiga-Key + A. This is an Relict of AMOS. Sorry,
 I dont understand that to.

                                  The Game

 You know this Game under the Name Black Jack, but its only with  32  Cards.
 Thats  makes  it faster and its realy the german Way to play this Game. The
 missing Cards are from 2 to 6. You got only the Cards from 7  to  the  Ace.
 Also the Points are different.
 For People they never play it befor here the Rules:
 You must come very closed to the Amount of 21 Points. If you  or  the  Bank
 (thats the Computer) mean its enough and take no more Cards, then the other
 one must try to reach more Points (but not more then 21 !).
 But remember, if you take no more Cards you got no second Chance to reach
 21, because you have finished the Game on this Way.
 The Bank win, if the Points are the same (as example you  got  18  and  the
 Bank to). So you must get every Time more than the Bank.
 Points over 21 lose.
 There is only one Exception: When the Game starts and the first 2 Cards are
 2 Aces. Thats called Fire. The Person with Fire is the Winner.
 For one Card more press with the left Mousebutton on the Cardstuck.
 Do you wish no more Cards, then you press on "Ready !".
 If you wanne quit, then you must press the right Mousebutton and  klick  in
 the Menu the Button "Quit".
 And now how much Points is which Card.

@node Bugs



                                 Known Bugs

 If You have only 2 MB and you start the Intro and the Intro wanne start the
 Mainprogram,  then  you will get an "Out of Memory"-Error. Start the hidden
 File named "GJack2". Always you must start  the  Game  from  a  Disc  or  a
 Harddisc. Now you can play.

 Sometimes the Bank will not take another Card and you win. Thats realy  not
 a big Bug, so I dont change it.

 Wright me, if you got Problems with your Amiga. I have wroght this Programm
 on  a A1200 (sometimes with a Speedercard and sometimes without, because it
 was damaged). There was no Problems.

 When 1 Player got less then 0 $ and You wanne play the Game again, then the
 Computer  wanne  start  it  again.  Sometimes  You  will  get a "Screen not
 open"-Error. This is wrong because the Screen is open, but  the  Game  will
 nevertheless  ending.  So  You  must start the Mainprogram "GJack2" manuell
 again. Thats all but angry.

 You think You got good Pictures for a Cardset or You are a a good Painter,
 then make your own Cardset. You dont must pay the Share, when you upload

 If you send me the Share of 10 US $ or 10 German Mark or when you put  your
 Cardset  for GJack V2.0 on the Aminet, then you will become the Instruction
 to create the Keyfile. Then its possibel to load new Cards.  Also  You  can
 rename  this  Cardset  to "AllCards.IFF" and the Game will load this as the
 default Cardset. In the Shareware-Version You cant do that.
