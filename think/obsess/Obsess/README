        Special thanks to: Lindsay Markus, Dave Owens, and Fred Werrell
                           for their ideas and friendship.
                      
            Obsess-O-Matic is a real-time puzzle game. The object
    is to fit the falling pieces together to form complete horizontal
    rows, which will then disappear off the bottom of the board. Once
    the pieces fill in and reach the top, the game is over.
            This Game is ShareWare...Please feel free to copy and give it
    to a friend or put it on any bulletin board. If you enjoy it, I would
    appreciate a donation very much. My address is:

  Below is an explanation for the piece/game controls used in Obsess-O-Matic:

    Puzzle Piece Controls:   4-LEFT         5-ROTATE    6-RIGHT 
                             1-LEFT & DOWN  2-DOWN      3-RIGHT & DOWN 
                                     SPACE BAR - FAST DROP
    Game Controls: 
      Level:           Raise/lower current play level - Max is 14, Min is 1
      Extra Pieces:    Enables/disables new pieces in addition to standard
                       set. Extra pieces start to appear at higher levels.

                       This also enables burning and exploding pieces which
                       start to appear at levels 3 and greater.

      Special Effects: enables/disables special game processing features
                       such as:

                                 1) Firestorm
                                 2) Air Raid
                                 3) Fast Piece Drop
                                 4) Filler Pieces
                                 5) Invisible Pieces

                       These special effects have a chance of appearing
                       if one or more rows are dropped off the bottom of
                       the screen.

      Show Next:       Shows next piece to appear on screen - lowers point scores
      Reset High Score: Clears the high score to 0 (also saved to disk)

    NOTE: DISK MUST BE WRITE ENABLED!...High Score is also saved when
                                        game is exited.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hints & Game Features:
     1) Diagonal keys 1 & 3 may be used to fit pieces in odd places.
     2) Dropping more than one row earns bonus points and a greater chance
        for special effects. 4 rows at once ALWAYS triggers an effect.
     3) Sounds in the sounds directory may be changed to your liking, but file
        size of each MUST NOT exceed 10K. The rotating sound should be short.
        All sounds are in standard IFF format.

SPECIAL NOTE:
        Please feel free to mail me your ideas for the improvement of this
    game or features that you would like added. Also, if you find any bugs
    I would appreciate hearing about them and I will fix them right away.
