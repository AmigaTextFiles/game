    This disk contains version 1.0 of the shareware game Obsess-O-Matic. 
Obsess-O-Matic is a real-time puzzle game. The object is to fit the 
falling pieces together to form complete horizontal rows, which will 
then disappear off the bottom of the board. Once the pieces fill in 
and reach the top, the game is over. Features such as burning, exploding, 
and invisible pieces enchance game play. Many additional features including 
a puzzle piece editor are available by sending a donation to the author. 
Please refer to the README file.
