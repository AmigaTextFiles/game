DEMON V1.01 DISTRIBUTION TERMS :
--------------------------------

This is the cut-down, shareware version of Demon. You may use it as
often as you like but are encouraged to support the programmer by
purchasing the full version for a small fee. You will also receive the
full, registered version of Klondike and extra card graphics and sound
effects for both programs.

You are also encouraged to distribute Demon V1.01 to as many Amiga
owners, PD libraries and electronic bulletin boards as possible. I'm not
fortunate enough to own a modem and so will be extremely grateful to
anyone willing to upload this version to a BBS for me.  

Demon V1.01 may be freely distributed as long as the following
conditions are met :


  o No-one may claim copyright to Demon other than the author.
  
  o No other games written by Peter Wiseman may be distributed on
    the same disk as Demon.
  
  o All of the following files must be included in their original
    form without deletions, or modifications of any kind :

    Demon V1.01
    Demon.prefs
    Demon.startup
    Designing Cards.doc
    Distribution.doc (this file)

The above files and their respective .infos take up around 335K of
disk space.

Additional graphics, sound samples, prefs and hi-scores files may be added
to the Card Faces, Card Symbols, Card Backs, Card Sets, Sound Effects,
Sound Prefs and Scores directories as disk space allows. However, none of
the above files may be deleted or altered to make room for these.

In order for the in-game Print function to work on the doc files, your
system disk should contain a "printer.device" file in the "devs/" drawer,
"Port Handler/" in the "l" drawer and a suitable printer device ("generic"
will do) in the "devs/printers/" drawer. I don't insist that these files
are present on the distribution disk though; only if space allows.


For variations to the above conditions, contact Peter Wiseman at :

30 Coronation Drive, Penketh, Warrington, Cheshire, WA5 2DD.
