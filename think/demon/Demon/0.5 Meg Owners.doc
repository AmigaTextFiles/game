                          ***************************

Oh dear, Oh dear ! In the good (bad ?) old days of the ZX Spectrum, BBC,
Dragon etc, 16K or even 32K memory was HUGE. Then computers of the calibre
of the mighty Amiga appeared with 512K and blew "normal" computers away.
Unfortunately, today in 1993, 512 kilobytes of memory for a multitasking
computer is a wee bit PUNY ! 

Demon is a greedy pig when it comes to memory, and in order to just get the
thing running, a number of memory grabbing features have to be scrapped. When
playing Demon with 512K, you won't be able to use 16 colour cards (those
marked with an asterisk*) and there will be severe limitations on the number
of sound samples you can load. 

It may be time to upgrade, matey ! A third party memory upgrade will only set
you back around £20, which isn't too much to ask. If you intend buying from
the "Big `C'" then you may find the picture to be slightly more woeful. Sorry
Commodore, your computers are the best but your peripherals are in, my humble
opinion, overpriced and trash.

If you are unfortunate enough to be using less than 1 meg then disconnect
any external drives you own as each additional drive grabs about 20K of
precious memory. Also quickly close all the workbench windows as the game is
loading and select "Low Memory Sounds" when you are informed that some sound
effects cannot be loaded due to low memory.
