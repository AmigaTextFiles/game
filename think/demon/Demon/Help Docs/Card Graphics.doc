You can select from a wide range of lovingly designed card graphics by
selecting the "Card Graphics" menu under "Preferences". A requester
will appear, with four graphics file gadgets grouped to the left,
named "Card Faces", "Card Symbols", "Card Backs" and "Card Sets". Each
of these four gadgets has its own definable file path which will be
searched for ILBM graphics files when selected. When you select one of
these gadgets, the "Path" text gadget will change and relevant
graphics files will be listed in the file requester underneath. You
can load one of these by clicking on the file name.

Card Faces files contain the graphics for the court cards (Queen etc)
Card Symbols contain the suit, numbers and letter graphics or various
countries.
Card Backs are the graphics for, surprise, surprise... the card backs.

You can select any combination of these three graphic types to create
a complete pack of cards. When you have selected a valid combination,
a sample card will be displayed at the bottom of the requester so you
can see what the cards will look like.

As an alternative to the above three file combinations, you can
select a full Card Set. These graphics files contain the designs for
each of the 52 cards and the card backs. This allows each card to have
an individual design, and the computer can create a full pack of cards
from a single card set file. Card sets can also be combined with card
backs, but not with faces or symbols files.

To make the possibilities clearer, here are the three distinct options
you can take when making your card graphics preferences :

    [1] Select Card Face, Card Symbol and Card Back graphics files.

    [2] Select a single Card Set.

or  [3] Select a Card Set and a Card Back (in that order).


When using a symbols file, you may also specify whether you want the
symbols to appear in all four corners or just the top left and bottom
right. This is achieved by clicking on the cycling gadget above the
Card Faces gadget.

Sixteen colours cards are denoted by an asterisk* following the file
name. In order to offer as many card graphics combinations as possible
the lower eight colours of graphics files all use the same palette to
prevent colour clashes. However, a little more freedom is allowed with
sixteen colour card backs and card sets. This allows more colourful
cards to be designed but reduces compatibility. Therefore, if you
select a sixteen colour card back and a sixteen colour card set (both
denoted with asterisks), the graphics will end up looking a mess due
to the files using different colour palettes. Unfortunately, you can
only use sixteen colours cards your Amiga has 1 meg of memory or more.

It's very simple to design your own card graphics with a program such
as Deluxe Paint. Read the ".doc" files on this disk for more
information.
