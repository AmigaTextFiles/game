Demon was written entirely in 68000 assembly using the best assembler
available, Devpac 3. The bind blowingly basic development machine used
was a standard, six year old A500, 0.5 meg chipmem, 2.5 meg fast,
v2.04 Kickstart, "Anorexic Agnus", "Not So Super Denise" chips and a
105meg GVP hard drive. In short, nothing particularly stunning.

Version 1.0

The first release of Demon was a cut down version with some of the
special features of V1.1 removed.


Version 1.01

A number of bugs fixed, including one which messed the cards up when
used on AGA machines.


Version 1.1

Full version that registered users receive when they send me the very
reasonable asking price of a crispy fiver.

Changes to V1.0 include :

  o New sound preferences files can be created, saved and deleted.
  o Hi-Scores selector enables you to create multiple hi-score tables
    for each player and select which ones are used by each of the
    game rules.
  o Easy to use hi-scores manager allows you to load two different
    hi-score tables, display them side by side and then select scores
    and names to be removed, copied or moved between tables. This
    enables you to group names and scores into different hi-score
    tables, any way you like.

Please note that you will receive extra card graphics, sound effects
and the latest, full version of Demon and Klondike when you register.
