To play Demon hold the right mouse button down and select "New Game"
from under the "Game" menu. Alternatively, you may simultaneously
press both the "N" key and the right Amiga key, found between the
spacebar and ALT.

The computer will then deal cards to The Demon, the first foundation
and four to the tableau. Make a mental note of the single foundation
card as this value card will be needed to start the other three
foundations and it's easy to forget during play. The timer now starts
and It's Show Time....

The game is controlled entirely with mouse movement and use of the
left mouse button. To move a card, position the pointer over it and
press the left mouse button. The pointer will be seen to grab the card
and then, while keeping the button pressed, you may drag it around the
screen to a new position. When the card is moved over a valid
position, the area will highlight in grey. If you then release the
mouse button, the card will jump to this new location. Note that you
don't have to waste time positioning the card neatly. It doesn't
matter if you have the tiniest corner or the whole card over the
destination position. As long as the area is highlighted, indicating
that the move is valid, the computer will move the card and arrange it
neatly when you release the mouse button. If you grab a card and then
decide you don't want to move it anywhere, simply drag it to an area
on the screen where it won't highlight any cards, and release the
button. It will then jump back to its original position.

You may move whole columns, or sections of columns (if the game rules
allow), by positioning the pointer over the highest card in the column
and dragging as described above. When spaces are created in the
tableau they will be filled automatically from The Demon. To save
time, you can send a card flying to the foundations by double clicking
on it rather than dragging. There is no score penalty for this, unlike
Klondike.

When you have made all moves possible from the tableau, you will want
to deal the next batch of three cards from the deck. To do this,
simply move the pointer over the face down deck and click the mouse
button once. When the pack has been exhausted, the computer will
decide whether the game has blocked and display a redeal sign for you
to click on if the game can continue. If no constructive moves can be
made and a subsequent redeal would also prove to be a waste of time,
then you will be informed that the game has blocked and the timer will
stop. You may then select "End Game" if you want to access some of the
disabled menu items, or "New Game" to start another game. In either
case, you will be prompted to type your name if you have attained a
high score.

If you manage to complete the game, you will be awarded a bonus based
on the time taken. During play, The value of this bonus is constantly
on display and will be seen to reduce with time. For more information
on how the bonus is scored select "Scoring" from the "Help" menu.

If you are still unsure about the game rules then the best way to
learn is to simply start a new game and get stuck in. The computer
won't let you cheat and you'll soon pick up the rules by dragging a
few cards around the screen and observing which cards are highlighted,
indicating valid moves.

Demon saves the best scores to your disk so make sure it isn't write
protected, but ONLY if you've made a backup copy first !

The game is best played with friends, trying to beat each others
scores. If you haven't got any then you have my sympathies. Maybe you
should drag yourself away from your computer and try making some ?

Have fun and enjoy the game .....
