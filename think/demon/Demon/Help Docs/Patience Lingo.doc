The following terms crop up frequently in Patience and will hopefully
enable you to understand some of the more confusing gibberish in my
playing instructions.


ALTERNATING COLOUR : Red on black, black on red, where red means
hearts or diamonds and black means clubs or spades.

AVAILABLE : An available card is one which, by the rules of the game,
may be taken and put somewhere else.

BUILD : The act of assembling cards into a sequence determined by the
rules of the game.

COLUMN : A line of cards extending vertically towards the player.

COME OUT : A game of patience is said to come out if it can be
completed by the normal rules of the game.

COURT CARD : The court cards consist of Jacks, Queens and Kings.

DECK : Officially, the deck is a complete pack of cards. However, I
define the deck in patience to consist of the remaining cards that
are not dealt to the layout at the start of play. The deck is held
face down and cards turned from it face up to form a wastepile, the
uppermost card of which is usually available for play.
FOUNDATION : A pile to which cards are played in a certain sequence in
order to complete the game.

PASS : When you have dealt all the cards from the deck, during play,
it is said to have been passed.

RANK : The identity of a card irrespective of its suit. There are ten
numerical ranks, from Ace to Ten and three court cards.

REDEAL : In some games there comes a point when no further play is
possible yet the game is still incomplete. If the rules allow, then
cards that have not been built, such as those dealt to a wastepile,
may be gathered together to form a new deck, and redealt.

RESERVE : Some games call for a number of cards to be dealt at the
start of play to what's known as reserve. Unlike the tableau, no
building takes place on the reserve. Usually, the top card of the
reserve is available for play.

ROW : A line of cards dealt from side to side, horizontally rather
than in a vertical column.

SEQUENCE : The normal "ascending sequence" is A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-
Jack-Queen-King. Some games call for cards to be built in descending
sequence from King down to Ace and others "wrap" around such as 9-10-
Jack-Queen-King-A-2-3-4 etc. Most patience games call for sequences
where the Ace is "low" (ie has the value one). However, the Ace is
high in a number of other card games, such as Poker, and sequences run
from 2 to Ace rather than from Ace to King.

SPACE : A card or column can sometimes be moved from the tableau
creating a "space". The rules may declare that the space may be
filled by another card, or a specific card.

TABLEAU : A number of cards are dealt at the start of play to form an
arrangement known as the tableau. Cards are built in sequence to the
tableau to form columns in order to eventually be played to the
foundations.

WASTEPILE : Cards that are turned from the deck and cannot be entered
into the layout are discarded to a wastepile. Some rules allow the
wastepile to be turned over and redealt when the deck has been used.
