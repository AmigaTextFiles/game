Help with unfamiliar terms in the following rules can be found under
the "Patience Lingo" menu.

This popular, single player, card patience game is better known in
America as Canfield. However, in England it is called Demon and as I
say "tom-ar-toe" rather than "tom-ay-doe", Demon it is. Anyway, all
the other computer versions I have seen are called Canfield.

The game is played with a single, standard pack of fifty two playing
cards. Thirteen cards are dealt to form a reserve, known as The Demon
with only the top card being visible. The next card is dealt face up,
to the right of The Demon, to start the first of four foundations.
During the game, as each other card of the same rank as this becomes
available, it is placed in line with the first to begin the remaining
foundations. Four cards are now dealt face up in a non-over-lapping
row to the right of The Demon and below the foundations to form the
tableau. The game then commences.

The object of the game is to build each foundation up in suit and
ascending sequence until it contains thirteen cards of the same suit,
wrapping at Q-K-A-2-3 if necessary. Cards are dealt from the deck to a
waste pile, in groups of three. The top, exposed card of this waste
pile is available to play, releasing the card below. All moves should
be made before turning the next group of three.

Single cards may be transferred to the foundations from the top of
the waste pile, from The Demon, or if exposed, from the bottom of a
tableau column. Cards may be built on the tableau in a descending
sequence and alternating colour (eg red Six on black Seven, black Ten
on red Jack). Tableau columns may also wrap 4-3-2-A-K-Q if the
alternating colour rule is followed. A whole column may be cleared out
by building on top of another, provided the join follows the same
rule. As soon as a tableau column is emptied, it must be filled with
the top card of The Demon releasing the card below. However, if there
are no cards left in The Demon, it may be filled with an exposed card
from the waste pile, but not necessarily immediately. 

When the deck has been exhausted, the waste pile is turned to form a
new one. Unlimited re-deals are allowed until the game either comes
out or blocks.

Demon is made slightly easier by the following game variations :

o Any number of cards in a tableau column can be moved to another,
  rather than being limited to only moving full columns.

o Ten cards may be dealt to The Demon at the start of the game
  instead of thirteen.
