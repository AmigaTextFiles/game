This version is SHAREWARE, date 28/8/95.

An important note from the programmer ......

WARNING !!! This game is seriously addictive. Do not let your wife,
girlfriend, family, friends, dog etc, play this game if you want
to use your Amiga ever again !

Demon is Shareware. This means that you get to try the game before
you decide to buy it. If you find out that you don't like this sort
of game then you haven't wasted any money. Sounds cool huh ? Well it
is, but only if you support the shareware system. You know what I'm
getting at don't you ? I'm talking cash. Shareware relies on users
like yourself to be honest and get that cheque/cash in the post to
the programmer as soon as possible if play this game regularly. This
will buy you the full version and the right to play with a guilt-free
conscience for ever.

I take great pride in my programming and am only interested in
producing the best. To make a polished product has taken a lot longer
than it would to churn out a sloppy one, but I hope you'll agree that
the extra time and effort has been worth it. Please show your
appreciation of this by sending this relatively small shareware fee
to me. I don't earn a fortune from shareware, and don't expect to, but
as long as I consider the income generated to be worth the free time
that I sacrifice to program this stuff, then I will continue to
program quality games such as this.

The registration fee is incredibly modest, at :

£5.00 for Great Britain
£7.50 for Rest of World

Please make foreign cheques payable in Pounds Sterling, or prefarably
send cash.

For this price you will receive the full version of Demon, extra card
graphics, sound effects and a bonus, free, full release version of my
other shareware game, "Klondike", arguably more addictive than Demon !

US Amiga Owners - Don't be afraid that a short stretch of water between
you fine country and our relatively tiny island will swallow, up your
hard earned cash. You would be amazed at how advanced England is these
days. We have McDonalds and everything, including a fast and reliable
air-mail service. Honestly, you'll feel like I live next door. 


My permanent address is :

Peter Wiseman,
30 Coronation Drive,
Penketh,
Warrington,
Cheshire,
WA5 2DD,
ENGLAND.

I will try to send your disk within 2 weeks, but please allow up to
4 weeks for delivery. I may be on holiday, ill, or just plain busy,
(remember, I do this in my spare time), so please don't think the
worst if your disk doesn't arrive the day after you've sent your cash.

Many thanks in advance, and hope you enjoy my game.

Pete Wiseman, 28/8/95
