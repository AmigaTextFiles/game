BRAIN V1.01
------------

Well, while writing my long-time project 'FIleCat V2.4' my assembler 'DevPac'
needs a very long time for assembling (reaching the time of one-line-c-
programs !) and I did not know what to do in the meantime.I had the idea
to play a game, but, it had to be a small game (I only have 1MB).The first
try was the PD-game 'othello', but the assembler was slowed very much when
the computer was thinking.So I needed a single-player game which is not
played against a computer.I took the PD-game 'Daleks', a nice game, but after
some plays I wanted to play something where you must think and not where your
success depends on luck.Some days later I read the test of the game 'Logo',
and I liked it very much.So why not programming a clone of it ??? And here is
the result, Brain V1.01...
The idea of the game is to rebuild a square of numbers ranging from 1-4.(By
the way, it is very difficult to explain this in English, so excuse my bad
English.) You can click on a free plot and the number '1' appears there.One
is added to the four neighbours (if there are any).If one is added to a '4',
it becomes a '1'.So the problem is to have at the end the same numbers on the
right as on the left.

The Gadgets:

     Undo     -   Cancel the last move.
     Retry    -   Try again the current level.Your field is cleared.
     New Game -   Create a new level.
     Iconify  -   Sleep-mode.The screen is closed and a small window on the
                  workbench-screen appears where the free memory is shown.
                  Just click on the closewindow-gadget or press the right
                  mouse-button on the window to continue playing.
     Quit     -   Quit

The Menu:

  Project:

     New Size  -   Play with a new size chosen with the x-size and y-size
                   menu.
     New Game  -   ---> Gadget
     New Try   -   ---> Gadget 'Retry'
     Iconify   -   ---> Gadget
     About...  -   Who wrote this game, who has the copyright ???
     Quit      -   Quit

  X-Size/Y-Size:

     Choose the size of the playfield from 2x2 to 8x8.

Enjoy this game (I do) !!!

CLUSTER is a legal programming formation mainly working on Amiga, coding
Freeware (and perhaps some commercial programs later).
CLUSTER was founded on January 1989 with the following members:
André Wichmann, Guido Wegener, Martin Rosenkranz, Martin Baumann, Philipp
Witkop, Stefan Kaspari, Stefan Lietzow and Giang Nguyen.
Then we reduced our members to the best and got a new programmer.
Now, on 26.05.1990, we have the following members:
André Wichmann          Coding
Guido Wegener           Coding
Martin Mohr             Coding
Martin Rosenkranz       Graphics
Philipp Witkop          Digitizing
