 It is the year 2217 and the world still has no Idea of how to safely dispose
 of Radioactive! waste!, Except to dump it into a 20 mile deep hole in a
 field, and then to cover it over with good old Mother Earth.

 Once done, you then activate your remote Driod from Base to lay over the
 field, some specialy treated concrete blocks, which reduce radiation leaking
 into the atmosphere.

 Once laid, It takes 24 hours for them to settle and absorb any excess
 radiation, making it safe for you to leave Base and cross over to the next
 field.

 However!

 While you where asleep, some vandal zyborgs! 8-> came in a started playing
 around with your Driod! and making a mess of all your good work.
 You awaken from your slumber and chase them off with your good old Mrk-IV
 quantum partical disruptor! (ZZap! ping!)

 Radiation is now reaching critical levels and you now have only a few
 zen pas left (minutes!) before you become completely radiated! and
 vapourise!

 As luck! would have it! you just about have enough materials to complete
 the task, which is to repair all gaps in the field and bring your Driod back
 to base.

 But! those Pestky!! zyborgs have re-programed your Driod, and now! instead
 of just filling in the gaps as it is suppose to, it now removes any other
 concrete blocks that are in its way! creating even more gaps in the field!

 Time is running short!, you are running low on fuel, and now! you discover!
 Reverse control is Busted!! (can it get any worse!)



 Keep away from red Danger zones!


 Pick up bonding material in orange containers.

 and...



                             GOOD LUCK!

 The Game may start off easy , but it does eventualy get tougher!
 you will NEVER! be presented with the same puzzle twice!
 As difficulty icreases, so does the size of the field.
 You start with a 6 x 6 field, growing to a max! of 10 x 10
 (If you manage to get that far! that is)

 With each level you only have a limited amount of moves,
 if you use up all your moves without solving the current level you
 loose a life, and will move onto the next level

 keep checking how many moves you have left on the score Board
 marked:-

 Moves: 24

 Score: 3256

  Time: 2645

 Although you do have a limited amount of moves which are usualy
 exact! with none to spare!
 there are times you may actualy use less, which is a bonus I suppose
 But this wont make the task any easier though.

 Use a Joystick to control your movements.

 Hitting R on the keyboard will restart the level, but time will remain the
 same.
 You can restart the level as many times as you wish, providing you have
 enough time left.

 Hitting S will Solve the level and you loose one of your 3 live's.

 If you can not solve the curren puzzle,
 Hitting Q will move you onto the next level and you also loose a life.

 BASE:

 Base is in the upper right hand corner as a blue marker
 you must find your way back to Base, while repairing the damage! along the
 way. (You will only be allowed in if! you have completed your task)

 QUIT:

 Hit the Esc key to quit Game.




 I have tried to make the game Simple but tough at the same time.
 I dont realy like senseless beat em ups except one on one games like
 Barbarian pallace (where you chop his head off!)
 Or one of my altime fave`s is Bubble Bobble, again in 2 player mode,
 Great fun! watching each others back, and then stealing the gems your
 Partner has worked hard for! (He he he...)

 Logic type games are more what I like, hence (c) MindField 1995.

 Then one of the Funniest games I ever seen.. was Buba and Stix
 It was so funny! I could`nt play. (a little bit of logic was there too)

 Anyway..

 If You like MindField and intend to keep it, please send 3 pounds
 To the address below.
 This certainly wont make me a millionare! but it will help towards
 future costs (if I am to continue writing software)
 Since any other useful utilities that may help me continue, even PD
 Costs money.

 If Shareware was not around and everthing was purely PD(free)
 and not Demo(Cut down versions) It probably would`nt matter.
 But to bring you this cost me money and will again in the future.
 So please register.
