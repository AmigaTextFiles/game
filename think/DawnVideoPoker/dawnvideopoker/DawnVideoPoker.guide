@node what "What is DawnVideoPoker?"

@{b}What is DawnVideoPoker?@{ub}

It's a Video Poker Machine Simulator, with standard poker @{"rules" link rules}, found
in many bars & casinos. It includes a @{"'Double or Nothing'" link double} subgame that
really makes VideoPoker the game it is.

There are also two features or sub-games; @{"ACES HIGH" link acehi} and @{"STAR GAME" link stargame} which
are not "VideoPoker standard" but inventions of mine that really spices up
the game (and maybe makes the win-% a little too high -- but they can be
turned off ;))

@{b}What's in it?@{ub}

* @{"Double feature" link double} (This is what VideoPoker is About!)
* @{"'ACES HIGH'" link acehi} Bonus feat. Collect all 4 ACES and QUADRUPLE profit. (V2.0)
* @{"'STAR GAME'" link stargame} Bonus feat. Earn 3 STARS and x10 profit. (V3.0)
* @{"Statistics" link stats}
* @{"HighScore List" link hiscore}
* @{"Virtual Cards" link virtcard} By time cards get worn & dirty.
* Sfx (V1.5)
* A Lot Of Love!

@node sysreq "System Requirements"

1. An AMIGA. (Runs better on A500/A2000 now...with more chip free)

2. DVP2 Doesn't support RTG so you might need scan-doubler, xtra
   monitor or respective hardware to display it.
   In fact i don't give a shit! It's YOU that's incompatible
   if you can't run it, NOT me!

3. Preferable PAL mode. There is a NTSC-dectection system that displays
   the screens in a little better positions. However the high-score screen
   will not be 100% visable in NTSC.

4. Basic knowledge of Poker.

5. Luck?...

@{b}About my new homepage and BoingWorld@{ub}

As you might have noticed; our Amiga news-site www.BoingWorld.com and with
it my homepage and mail has been down since 03 July 2001.

Although it`s our ambition to get BoingWorld back on line ASAP the wait
and absence of my mail, esp. considering i was receving feedback from
my shortly-before-BoingWorld-going-down released @{"BabeAnoid" link babe} demo --

@{b}Usage - How to play.@{ub}

When you first start DVP2 you will face the @{"Log-in" link login} promt.
This works both as a simple name entry and as @{"Prefs" link login} control.

Once you've entered your prefs (or cheats) and name, the game starts.

As default you are given $100 to play with.

The first thing you do is to decide how much to bet $1 to $5. $5 is
deafult. If you reach $150 you can bet $10.

Then press the 'DEAL' button. Five cards will be dealt.
The @{"Win/Hold lights" link winhold} will now indicate any winning combinations or in some
cases suggest wich cards to hold (green lights). If you are happy with this
choice; press RIGHT MOUSE-BUTTON to auto-select these cards, otherwise click
on the cards you wish to discard. Click on 'DEAL' once more and new cards
will be dealt to replace the ones you discarded. Now you either have a
winning hand according to the @{"Pay-off Rules" link rules}, or have lost your bet.
If you have won you have the choice to play the @{"Double game" link double}.

You will notice that all ACES in your final hands will be collected
at the left-side screen. This is a new bonus feature called @{"ACES HIGH" link acehi}.

Buttons:
* CASH OUT - Quit/Restart option screen:
                                       |
              CASH OUT - Quits, writes any high-scores.
              RESTART  - Log-In prompt. Deletes current game.
              CONTINUE - Resume current game.

@node tech "Technical"

@{b}Technical@{ub}

This is the 5th official release of DawnVideoPoker.

DVP2 is written 100% in AMOSpro. With CRAFT & AMCAF extensions and an
updated version of AMOS.library.

All graphics are 32-colour. (With a stupid palette design, sorry!)

The cards are generated at start-up. (Check the file 'gfx/make-cards')

@{"Advanced card-shading: (V2.0)" link shade} by splitting the effect in two parts and
replacing former button-delays etc. with the first (Calculation) half,
I managed to more than double the speed of the shade-render :-)

@{"About the Sound-system (V2.0)" link sfx}

The chess & poker principle:
This game is stripped of all fancy gizmos like intro screens and music.
I hope you, like me, want it to be as fast & smooth as possible.
But hey! If you really want it, i can join the world of stupid mega-game
coding and add a 25MB ray-traced intro animation of 52 flying cards, and
release the whole thing on CD instead!

@endnode

@node bugs "Bugs"

@{b}Bugs@{ub} (spontanously generated features)

A small bug in the suggestion routine: <-- FIXED!
ex. If you have 9,10,Kn,Q of spades and 10 of diamonds the suggestion
can indicate a straight chance using the 10 of diamonds instead of
the straight flush chance using the 10 of spades.

Not really a bug, but DVP2.0 could exit accessing some screens on low chip
setups. This version (3.0) uses less chip-mem and should work better.

There is a way to screw up the hi-score list: By using a cheat that gives
you a lot of money, then CashOut without playing any game...causing the
stats-screen generation to malfunction because there are no stats!
Who would ever do such a thing? If you now are of that bizarre nature that
you have to try this!?...use the command 'HI-RESET' to restore the hi-score
system when you are through playing around.

High-Score screen statistics freezing bug:
Sometimes the game can freeze/crash when viewing high-score statistics --
And i don`t know why! But i`ve added some small delays between screens
that at least so far have proven sucessfull.

@{"About Sound problems (Before V2.0)" link sfx}

If you however encounter something that looks like a bug; Please send
me a @{"Mail" link author} and describe the bug, the situation and your hardware/software
as detailed as possible, thank you.

@node double "Double game"

@{b}Double game@{ub}

When you win a hand you have a choice to bet your winnings at a
game of 'Double or Nothing'.

Press 'NO' collects your winnings. (No Double game)

Press 'YES' and five new cards will be dealt, the first face up,
is the computer's card and the one you must top. The other four are
face down and you must simply pick a card at chance. Aces are high.

If your card is HIGHER than the computer's you've just doubled your
winnings. You can then choose to play again or collect your money.
You can double for as long as you wish, or more likely, until you lose.

If your card is LOWER you lose your winnings. The other three cards
will be revealed. There is no guarantee of a winning card among the
four cards you are dealt -- But with +V3.0 there is a new feature called
the @{"'STAR GAME'" link stargame} that will award you a goldstar if you manage to pick
the HIGHEST card when losing, when you have three stars
the STAR GAME is activated.

If your cards are EQUAL you keep your money and get the choice
of playing again or collecting your money.

ex. You get a 'Three of a kind' with a $5 bet = $15
    Double once and win = $15 X 2 = $30
    Double a second time = $30 X 2 = $60

My personal record is 7 doubles at a FLUSH with a $5 bet.
$30 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = $3840.

@endnode

@node acehi "ACES HIGH"

@{b}ACES HIGH@{ub}

Bonus feature:
This is not a standard poker-variation but a thing i made up myself.
But i'm sure most of you will appreciate this addition.

All ACES in your final hands will be collected at the left-side
screen. When you have the four diffrent suit aces all winnings in
the NEXT game will be QUADRUPLED!

Every once in a great while you can get a conjunction of the STAR GAME
and ACES HIGH, in this instance the win-multiple will be 40!!!

Log-in commands:
   BASIC - Deactivates ACES HIGH and STAR GAME = Standard videopoker.
ACESHIGH - Reactivates ACES HIGH (not STAR GAME)

Ex. Bet $10 with ACES HIGH and get 'Three of a kind'. $10 x 4 x 3 = $120
    Then Double it Three Times: $120 x 2 x 2 x 2 = $960 (Easy, eh?)

@endnode

@node babe "BabeAnoid"

@{b}BabeAnoid@{ub}

A huge Breakout/Arkanoid clone i've been working on for more than 6 years.
The first official demo was released in July-2001 (Finally!)

- "Does the world really need another one of those?" you say.

Hmm...where should i start?
Let's say like this...the routine that handles the shadows from the blocks
on the background...took longer to write than the first version of DVP.
And that's just one of the effects you probably won't even think about!

So, What's in it?...

BabeAnoid is a 32-colour/ECS game written in AMOS and is aimed at a minimum
of 020 CPU and 2MB of FAST Ram, Hopefully it should be possible to play it
on 1MB CHIP by reducing settings in the preferences.

* +30 Diffrent Bonuses (Balls, Bats, Weapons, BonusLetters, Lemmings!..etc)
* 6 diffrent Balls (Normal, Plasma, Shield, Fly, Rubber & Spike)
* Bats: 5 Sizes, Help-bat, Gold-bat (That will survive one enemy hit)
* Blocks: Moveable, Walls, Multi-hit, Lamps, Invisible, Growing, Spawn etc...
* Weapons: Cannon and Laser (To use against enemies)
* Many Enemies: Tank, Invader, Morpher, Blocker and Enemy bat.
* 2 Teleporter sets, 2 hit-all-switches-to-open-gate sets.
* Fruit-bonuses to pickup, X-tra balls that gives more points for each save.
* Lemmings that can catch a ride with the ball(!) or be saved by the bat.
* Expandable ScoreBoard and Minimum-Batsize by using MegaBonus-system.
* Bonus-game by collecting letters B-O-N-U-S.

Roofs, One-way zones, Pinball-like slides, Speed-zones, Bumps, Magnets etc...
Background pics, Blocks cast shadows, Ball smoking when hot, Music + SFX,
Speech samples, +16 Tunes, Storable itmes/balls, Preferences,
Store: Buy & sell items , Help-On-Line system, Load/Save opt.,
Rescue probes, Glue/Aiming bat, Shrapnel from destroyed blocks, Twinkles,
Extra life at 10,20,40.000...points etc, Diffrent explosions and sounds to
diffrent blocks, A possible +63 Sprites/Bobs on screen...and more

Here's a list of my released @{"Games" link games}

@endnode

@node streaks "Streaks - display"

@{b}Streaks - display@{ub}

This refers to the meter on the right side of the main screen.

Every game you lose in a row will be displayed with a RED line,
and each consecutively won hand shown in GREEN.

This is the same info as found on the @{"STATS-screen" link stats}.

@endnode

@node winhnd "Winning hands - display"

@{b}Winning hands - display@{ub}

With the addition of the $10-bet a problem arose. There is not enough
room to add $10-pay-off numbers to the winning-board at the top-right main
screen. So there is no flashing rectangle indicating your winnings when
you bet $10.

In an attempt to compensate this i've added flashing lights to the left
of the board to graphicly indicate at least your 'Winning-hand' if not
the actuall pay-off.

@endnode

@node autosort "Auto-Sort"

@{b}Auto-Sort@{ub}

Cards/Hands now sorted by Card-value Left-to-Right.

Log-in commands:
NOSORT - Deactivates
  SORT - Reactivates

I first intended writing a routine to nicely sort and display your winning
hand. Soon realizing that would require an almost unique routine for each
winning-hand. That code would make out almost a THIRD of the entire game.
So i dropped it!

But, after a little more thinking i found that a simple sorting routine
by card-value left-to-right would look almost as good. And it can be used
both at first dealing and at the final hand.

Initally this will probably feel strange but after a while you don't want
to be without it, trust me!

@endnode

@node virtcard "Virtual Cards"

@{b}Virtual Cards@{ub}

By time the cards are getting torn, worn and dirt-stained. Idea by DeZENT.

Not really videopoker standard but a cool effect, i think.
Right now there is no way of turning this off or 'cleaning' the cards.

I have spent 10 hours in DVP2 improving the 'dirt-stains'...they now
look awesome in my humble opinion!

Hate it or love it!

pointer to the left side (until the light goes bright-yellow) and click
with the left mouse button.

WARNING! - This feature can cause the game to exit if low chip-mem.

@{b}Keeping old high-score list@{ub}

To keep your high-scores from a version of DVP older than 2.0 you must
@{i}copy the file 'gfx/hiscore' from the old version into the directory
'hiscores' of the new version.@{ui} Of course you will not get any
statistics-screengrabs as they were only implemented in V2.0. If you
made any entries on the hiscore-list earlier in V2.0; make sure you
reset the high-scores by writing 'HI-RESET' at the log-in, BEFORE you
copy your old high-score into V2.0.

To keep your high-score list from a V2.0 or later: Just replace the

Although if you experience any problems, try a clean boot and don't run

@node shade "Advanced card-shading"

@{b}Advanced card-shading@{ub}

As default the cards from a 'finished' game will be shaded by a simple
dithered image pasted onto them.

In V2.0 i have added a more advanced form of shading; a real time
pixel-by-pixel effect. If you have a 060 this feature is deafult.
Anything below 040 will probably be too slow for most users taste.

(I've tried to write a direct-memory access routine for this effect...but
it seems like the bit-wise operations in AMOS are incredibly slow!
Actually a ROR.B is slower than a standard divison '/' with a 060!)
Se @{"'Technical'" link tech} for more information.

Log-in commands:
  SHADE - Activates advanced card-shading.
NOSHADE - Deactivates

@node designcard "Design your own card(s)"

@{b}Design your own card(s)@{ub}

In V2.0 it is possible to change the top-image (A BoingBall by default)
to another one of five from the iff-file 'gfx/cards'.

Load the image 'gfx/cards' into your fav gfx-prog and take a look.
Note that the palette may not be changed and that the PURPLE COLOURS MAY
NOT BE USED as they are reserved for special-effects.

The size of the images are about 75 x 55 pixels. The palette is rather
limited for 'Photographic use' but anything in gray-shades will look great!

Log-in commands:
CARD1 - Activates image ONE in the file 'gfx/cards'.
CARD2 - Activates image TWO in the file 'gfx/cards'.
CARD3 - Activates image THREE in the file 'gfx/cards'.
CARD4 - Activates image FOUR in the file 'gfx/cards'.
CARD5 - Activates image FIVE in the file 'gfx/cards'.

@node winhold "Win/Hold lights"

@{b}Win/Hold lights@{ub}

Quick result/hold-suggestion display of your hand. Use Right mouse-button
to execute these card suggestions on the fly.

Placed on the frame above each card are two lamps; RED & GREEN.

RED: If the red lamp is lit; the card is part of a WINNING combination.

RED + GREEN: If both lamps are lit; you have a PERFECT hand that can not
be improved. (R.Flush,S.Flush,4Kind,FullHouse,Flush or Straight)

GREEN: These are suggestions of good cards to keep. The following
combinations will indicated:

* Double Straight chance. (ex. 4-5-6-7-Q. Q -> 3 or 8 = Straight)
* Flush chance - 4 cards in one suit.
* Low pair - Any pair bellow Jacks.
* Highest Jack+ card.

Single Straight chances are NOT indicated, except Kn-Q-K-A. As i think
the odds are to low (1/11.75)

Remember: Suggestions are just that, and not necessarily the best thing
to do in a certain situation!

Suggestion:               Odds:   Avg. pay-off on investment.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Double Straight chance -  1/3.1 - 1.29 *
Flush chance           -  1/5.2 - 1.15 *
Low Pair (3 of a kind) -  1/3.6 - 0.85 *
Low Pair (2 Pair)      -  1/2.3 - 0.85 *
Single Jack+ card      -  1/2.4 - 0.42 *

* Other winning results not included.

(Can't promise these numbers are correct...i failed math!
But if i'm right you will get almost 50% better pay-off from a 'Low pair'
than a 'Flush chance', when adding 3-of-a-kind & 2-pair outputs...
however a 'Flush chance' with some face-cards should even the odds..
Still, my suggestion routine will prioritate 'Flush-chances' over
'Low pairs'. "Bigger is better" or whatever you want to call it.)

'Win/Hold lamps' are incompatible with the @{"NOSORT" link login} option...but why you
would like to turn off the auto-sort is beyond me.

@node newz2.1 "What's new in 3.0"

@{b}What's new in 3.0@{ub}

       Added @{"'STAR GAME'" link stargame} - New bonus feature.

       Added @{"'Bank Roll'" link bankroll} - Win/Lose history now recorded for each account.

       Added & changed some @{statistics link stats} - winning hands now displayed as 1/x.

       Added card-gfx to display Double, AcesHigh, StarGame & AceStar games.

       Improved chip usage - DVP3.0 takes about 65Kb less chip-mem.

       Fixed a bug in the @{"suggestion" link winhold} routine. Read more about @{bugs link bugs}

       Fixed a bug in the highscore screen/input (character problem).

I heard from some A500/A2000 owners that the game would quit when they
accessed the high-score & statistic screens.

The only reason for that to happen would be low chip-mem, so i took another
look at the code & gfx and found some things that could be optimized.

DawnVideoPoker3,0 now takes about 65000 bytes LESS chip-mem and saves around
80000 bytes fast-mem from DVP2.0.

This should be enough to open the high-score & statistic screens, however
i'm not sure it's enough to view the @{"record-statistics" link statview} from the high-score
screen.

@node stargame "STAR GAME"

@{b}STAR GAME@{ub} (V3.0)

Bonus feature:
This is not a standard poker-variation but a thing i made up myself.
But i'm sure most of you will appreciate this addition.

If you play the Double-game, pick the highest card but still lose;
you are awarded a gold-star, indicated at the bottom-left screen.
When you have collected 3 stars the STAR GAME is activated, which means
that all winning in the NEXT game will be multiplied by 10!

Every once in a great while you can get a conjunction of the STAR GAME
and ACES HIGH, in this instance the win-multiple will be 40!!!

Log-in commands:
   BASIC - Deactivates STAR GAME and ACES HIGH = Standard videopoker.
STARGAME - Reactivates STAR GAME (Not ACES HIGH)

@node bankroll "BANK ROLL"

@{b}BANK ROLL@{ub} (V3.0)

When you log-in an account will be created in that name.

This account will keep track of your lifetime balance and is always shown
left of the cash display, also at log-in and on the statistics-screen.
The account is updated when you cash-out, lose or restart.

Note that this is ONLY a record of history, you borrow $100 from me every
time you play, so if you cash out the first time with $150 your bank-roll
would be +$50.

The system can handle up to 100 diffrent accounts, if you exceed this limit
any new accounts will NOT be created but everything else should work fine.

If you have reached the 100 limit or for any other reason, like a great
loss, would wish to clear the accounts there is an option that will
completely erase all records:

Log-in commands:
BANKZERO - Clear ALL bank-roll accounts.

The bank-roll was suggested by Glen A. Blair, Las Vegas. However i could
not meet his request to resume a game with the current bank-roll as ACTIVE
funds, for three reasons:
1. This is a VideoPoker-machine simulator, cashing-out means cashing-OUT.
2. You can't play with NEGATIVE funds, just recording profit would be wrong.
3. A big profit-account would mess up the high-score table, as you would be
   entered every time you play.
