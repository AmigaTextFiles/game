I'll accept checks of ANY size in ANY denomination from ANYWHERE!


This file explains the use of those programs not discussed in the manual.

FastMARS, FastMARS88, SmallMARS, and SmallMARS88 are all invoked the same 
way and each is accessible only from the CLI.  Each program is the same 
as MARS, except there are no graphics or debugging.  FastMARS and 
FastMARS88 have vitually unlimited memory sizes (from as small as you 
like, to as large as your memory will allow).  SmallMARS and SmallMARS88 
have upper limits of memory at 64K and are actually faster than FastMARS
and FastMARS88.  FastMARS and SmallMARS are ICWS'86, FastMARS88 and 
SmallMARS88 are ICWS'88 (surprise!).

To invoke any of these programs, type:

<program name> <player 1> <player 2> <memory size> <start 1> <start2>
   <maximum cycles> <maximum tasks>

Only the first three elements are essential.  The defaults for the 
remainder are 8000, 0, 4000, 80000, and 64, respectively.


TMARS is a tournament version of MARS available for running ICWS'88 
tournaments.  You simply need to have a file with all of the contestants 
listed, one on each line.  An example file, 1988.tm, is included.

Each contestant will battle every other contestant twice, once as player
one and once as player two.  In addition, each contestant will battle
itself once.  Afterward, TMARS prints out each contestant followed by the 
number of wins, losses, and ties.

To invoke TMARS, type:

TMARS <player list filename> <memory size> <start 1> <start 2>
   <maximum cycles> <maximum tasks>

Only the player list filename is essential.  Defaults for the remainder 
are the same as above.  If you wish to keep a record of the tournament, 
simply redirect the output of TMARS to a file.  An example would be

TMARS >1988.results 1988.tm

WARNING!  If you enter the above command you will need ample time (an hour
or more).  After all, the above command executes two hundred eighty-nine
battles.  That is potentially more than twenty-three million cycles.
