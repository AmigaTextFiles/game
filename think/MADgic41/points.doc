       "Points" -- a public domain ditty by Scott Maxwell
       23 March 1992



       "Points" is a little program designed for use with Mark Durham's
excellent Amiga Core War game, "MADgic Core 4.0." MADgic Core's associated 
tournament manager program produces its output in terms of how many 
battles a core warrior won, lost, or tied. While this information is 
useful, I wanted to be able to come up with a single number for comparing 
the programs. And so ... Points was born!

       To use Points, first redirect the tournament manager's output to a 
file. E.g., type

               TMARS >outfile tournament_file.tm

       Invoke Points on the output file by typing

               Points outfile

       You may redirect Points's output to a file, if you like.

       By default, Points assigns 3 points for a win, 1 for a tie, and 0 
for a loss (I understand those values are fairly standard). However, you
may choose different "weights," including non-integer values. See the usage
text (by typing "Points" with no arguments) for more details.

       I release Points into the public domain with the following caveat: 
I hacked it together in a couple of hours, so don't expect it to be 
pretty. Also, I'm *not* responsible for bugs or anything else that might 
come of your choosing to use this program, including but not limited to
fires, locust plagues, and the heat death of the universe.

       If you use Points, I'd appreciate your dropping me a note at 
CSMAXWEL@ECUVM1.BITNET or Scott.Maxwell@bbs.oit.unc.edu. Pretend you like 
it.

       The source is included (I used SAS/C 5.10b, but I imagine it's 
highly portable). I don't know why the executable is so fat; 
floating-point math, I guess.

       Enjoy.
