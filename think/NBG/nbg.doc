N.B.G. - DEMO VERSION - DOCUMENTATION - 24/03/96

The game is fairly straightforward to play once you know
what you're doing, and as you are reading the doc, I assume
you don't know how to play it, so I'll explain:

The object of the game is to collect the jewels with the
ball, you cannot control the ball directly though - only
indirectly by placing barriers in its path. The ball always
travels at right angles ie. horizontally or vertically and
the barriers are at 45 degrees, for example, if the ball is
travelling upwards and you placed a "/" barrier in front of
it, it would change to travelling right. The easiest way to
get the hang of it is to have a go, so load the game, click
on "Start Game", "Continue" past the pre-level screen and
start placing barriers in front of the ball.

There are also numerous other blocks to get in your way, to
list what they all do would take far to long, so if you see
a block whose purpose isn't obvious, try sending the ball
into it and see what happens!

There are two versions of the demo: The economy version is
for quick distribution as it is a very small file, but does
not have an intro or any sound effects. The proper demo
should be available on most bulletin boards etc. If you 
find a BBS that hasn't got it - then please upload it! 

ADDITIONAL:

A couple of features on the prefs screen that may not be
obvious are: "Ext. Music"- enables an external music mod.
To use, either run a mod player before the game, or iconify
the game and load one then. It works with most mod players
(OctaMEDPlayer/PlayMOD etc.) but is unlikley to work with
any BIG mod player (that plays out of fastmem).

Also the "AGA Multiscan" button - DON'T select this unless
you have a multiscan monitor (eg. Microvitec 1438), it
enables a scan-doubled 31kHz screenmode (similar to VGA on
a peecee) which will just roll uncontrolably on a normal
video monitor. (The button will be ghosted unless you have
an AGA Amiga (A1200/A4000) anyway). And by the way the PAL/
NTSC buttons - if one of the modes rolls when viewed on
your TV try twiddling the V-Hold on the back (of the TV!).

The PAL/NTSC and Audio Filter buttons will not work on VERY
old Amigas (Pre 1988ish) Don't blame me, the hardware just
isn't there, anyway you should upgrade!

KNOWN BUGS:

Only the one (I hope!), If you have a multiscan Workbench,
ie. not PAL or NTSC, when returning to it from playing the
game it may be slightly different to when you left it, 
probably slightly narrower, simply pushing your screen-
blanker hot-key usually fixes this. NB: This will only
affect you if you have a multiscan Workbench! It should
be fixed by the time you register the game anyway.
