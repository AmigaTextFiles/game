@node 2 "What to Do"


--=[ @{b}What to Do@{ub} ]=--------------------------------------------------

The  theory  is  actually quite easy. You've got four areas, more or
less  filled  with  random  colored  shapes. Each area can carry 4x4
shapes.  The midle area (X) is empty, except for your litle 'Moper'.
      ____       The Moper can only move around in its centred area.
     |    |      By  pressing  fire/space while pointing to a shape, 
     |    |      the shape will be sucked into the Moper. This shape
     |    |      may  then  be pushed into any other area, also with
 ____|    |____  fire/space, if there's room left.
|     XXXX     |    The  idea  is  to  sort  all  shapes by color in
|     XXXX     | vertical  or horizontal rows and to waste (actually
|     XXXX     | "destroy")  as  few  of them as possible. There are
|____ XXXX ____| some things that need to be remembed!
     |    |
     |    |      * If  you  place  a  shape  in front of a different
     |    |      colored  shape, both of them will be destroyed. You
     |____|      will  probably HAVE to do this some times per level
in order to gain work-space.

* If you try to push a shape into a full row, the carried shape will
change  place  with the closest shape in the row. Note that no shape
will be wasted when you do this!

* Every  now and then, a random shape can, all by itself, convert to
another  color,  which  can  damage  a  homogen  row (but not a FULL
homogen row).

      ____       * The  level won't be finished until all colums are
     |YBBP|      homogen.  They don't have to be full; in fact, they
     |YB P|      can even be empty (it's just a matter of score...).
     |YB P|

@{b}Thing:         Added to score:          Note:@{ub}

Shape left     + 1
Homogen row    + 4
Full row       + 16 + level             Above score still included
Wasted shape   - 4                      -

@node 4 "Options"


--=[ @{b}Options@{ub} ]=-----------------------------------------------------

After  the  flashy title-screen, (somehow I fancy things that flash)
you can make some choises before starting or exiting the game. Press
joy/key  up/down  for  moving  around in the menu. Use left/right to
change option, and fire/space to select something.

@{b}Option:               Function:@{ub}

Level     1/2/3/4/5   A  lower choise gives you more work-space from
                      start.  The higher choise, the more often will
                      the computer mess up your rows. 
Music Vol 0/1/2/3/4   0 represents no music at all.
Start Game            Use this cutie to start game!
Hiscore               View top scores.
Quit                  Hmm...  maybe  I should have disabled this one
                      in the unregisterd version.

@node 5 "Sort of Ware"


--=[ @{b}Sort of Ware@{ub} ]=------------------------------------------------

The creation of this game didn't steal much of my time. I'm not even
sure  if  it's  any @{b}fun@{ub} to play. I like it myself, because I care to
sort things up. Uhm... but let's just say it's @{b}mailware@{ub}. Yes, if you
like  it,  you  'must' send me a card or an e-mail. If you've got an
e-mail-adress  you'll  then  receive... uh... let's see... a version
that  can  @{b}save  the  hiscore@{ub}  (so that you don't have to write your
scores down on paper)! Okay?

@{b}BUT,  I've  got  some  plans  for  making  an  enhanced version with
twoplayer-mode  etc.  I  won't  make  it  if no one wants it, so you
better  write  me an e-mail if you think it should be made. This new
version will most likely become shareware.@{ub}

--=[ @{b}Distribution@{ub} ]=------------------------------------------------

This game may freely be distributed, but you are not allowed to make
too  much  @{b}money@{ub}  on  it without telling me how the heck you managed
to  do  so!  When  distributed/copied/eaten,  no files may be added,
removed or changed.
   If  you  make  a  @{b}review@{ub} of "Moped" in a magazine, I would really
care  to  know about it (but you don't HAVE to notify me, ofcourse).
If  you  plan to put it on a @{b}coverdisk@{ub}, you certainly have to ask me
first, or I'll be really upset (for atleast two minutes!).

--=[ @{b}Story@{ub} ]=-------------------------------------------------------

It all started a long long, really long time ago. A rich man, also a
professor,  bought  a new pair of socks. He actually enjoyed his old
pair,  but  said: "What the heck!" Anyway, this man obviously... Bla
bla  bla  bla...  with  flashing lights... Bla bla bla... a horrible
hedache  because  of  those blue, circular things... Bla bla bla bla
bla  bla  bla...  Then  he said to the much taller man: "And that my
friend, is how we know that a rabbit can't wear glasses!"

... It's a Tetris-style game.
