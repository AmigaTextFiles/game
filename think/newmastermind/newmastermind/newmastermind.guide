@node Requirements "System Requirements"

NewMasterMind will run on any Amiga computer with version 2.0 or
higher of the OS (or at least I hope it will).  If you have version
2.1 or higher NewMasterMind will try to use the language you have
selected through Preferences (or with a @{"startup argument" link Tooltypes}).  To get the
most out of NewMasterMind (i.e. colored bricks) you need AmigaOS 3.0
or higher.

@endnode


@node Installation "Installation"

To install NewMasterMind from scratch or to update an old version just
run the installation script.

@endnode

@node Troubleshooting "Troubleshooting"

If you get the message "Screen is too small!" when you run
NewMasterMind, you are either using a too big screen font or you're
trying to run NewMasterMind on a too small public screen.
NewMasterMind is guaranteed to open on a 640 x 200 screen with a
screen font of reasonable size.  If you get a message about opening
libraries make sure you've got at least version 37 of the system
libraries.  Any other messages are probably due to lack of memory.
They're not likely to show up.

@node Game "The Game"

The purpose is to guess the hidden combination (generated either by
the computer or by a human opponent).  When you have made a guess,
your guess is compared with the hidden combination and black or white
bricks appears in the small holes according to how good your guess
was.  Each black brick indicates that one of the bricks in your guess
is in the correct position.  Each white brick indicates that one of
the bricks in your guess has the right color, but is in the wrong
position.  If the correction method for children is active each small
hole represents a big hole (see below).

   1 3
   2 4

    1
    
    2
    
    3
    
    4

If the correction method for adults is active there is no relationship
between the small holes and the big holes.  When you make the correct
guess you get four black bricks and the hidden combination will be
shown.  If you don't find out what the hidden combination looks like
in ten turns you loose, and the hidden combination will be shown
anyway.

@endnode


@node Gadgets "The Gadgets"

Select a brick to place on the board by pressing on it with the left
mouse button.  Move the mouse to where you want the brick to be
placed, and press the left mouse button again.  Press the right mouse
button to remove a placed brick.

Press the OK gadget when you are satisfied with your guess.

@node Acknowledgments "Acknowledgments"

I would like to thank Kennet Fribert for the Danish translation and
for some great suggestions on improving the game.

I dedicate this program to my computer teacher at Tensta senior high
school Maria Flodkvist.  During her lessons I developed a PC version
of this game.  Three years later I finally made this Amiga version.
An earlier version of this game was written in AmigaBasic already in
1990.

Special thanks go to Jesper Graetsch (a friend from my first year at
senior high school, who came with some suggestions on how to improve
the game) and Torbjörn "saltis" Magnusson (who was the first to
introduce me to the game).

@node Address "Contacting the Author"

Since the source code has been made public, you can fix bugs or make
improvements yourself.  Of course, if you do so I still would like to
know about it.

@node Localization "Localization"

NewMasterMind is localized, so if you have v2.1 or higher of the OS
NewMasterMind will try to use the language you have set in
Preferences.  If there is no catalog for your language, English will
be used as default.

Since I'm not very good at languages I've only written one additional
catalog (the Swedish one).  However I've included some files so that
you easily can make NewMasterMind support your language too.

Translate the strings in template.ct and save it as <language>.ct.
Then send that file to me so that I can include it in my package.
NOTE!  The first two characters in menu items are used for menu
shortcuts.  The first one is the shortcut (space means no shortcut)
and the second is always a null-byte. Make sure you don't use the same
character as shortcut for different items in the same Menu!
