RED DWARF TRIVIA QUIZ V6:
=========================

Good, now that the boring stuff is out of the way. 

The Red Dwarf Trivia Quiz v6 was created because I am nuts about Red Dwarf
and I wanted to see who else was. In this version, there are 50 quite easy
questions about Red Dwarf. It's the basics.

The game itself is simple to play. You start by selecting PLAY, then the
first question is displayed. You select your answer from the 4 possible
answers shown and the computer tells you if you are right or wrong.

And that's it.
