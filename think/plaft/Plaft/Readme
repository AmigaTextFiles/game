INTRODUCTION
	PLAFT is a great Columns game for the Amiga which I was
	meant to release ages ago.  It is still in it's	Alpha / 
	Beta stage.  It may NOT run on AGA amigas without using 
	KillAGA.  This will be fixed in the next version VERY 
	soon.  AGA users please try and get KillAGA, as you can
	then enjoy my game! =)

REQUIREMENTS
	- Amiga with at least 1 Meg. of RAM.
	- Lots of spare time to try and beat the high score.

INSTALLATION & RUNNING
	- Just unarchive the files to where you want to keep them.
	- Then go to the Workbench and click on the "Click Me 4 
	  Fonts" icon.  This will install "Abuse.font" to your FONTS: 
	  directory.
	- Simply click on the smiley face to play!

THE GAME
	Use your controls to sort the falling blobs in to lines
	of at least three of the same colour in any direction.  
	These lines will be destroyed letting others fall down.
	
	Try and get CHAIN-REACTIONs!  Also, watch for the
	SPECIAL blocks.  You'll find out what they do when you 
	get them!

	You will advance levels after gaining certain amounts
	of lines.

	(Note: The F1-F4 bit at the bottom of the playing screen 
	isn't included yet.)
