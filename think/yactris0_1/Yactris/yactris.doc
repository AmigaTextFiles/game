Yactris



I.  Introduction



The name Yactris was coined to mean "Yet Another Clone TRIS."
I'd been having the experience too many times where I start to
download a file, get bored, and have to go over to my neighbors' and
play Tetris clones on his I*M because I had no truly multitasking
games for my Amiga.  From this experience, the concept of Yactris was
born.

Yactris is a bare bones Tetris clones.	It doesn't have a lot of
colors or background graphics for a simple reason.  The Yactris window
can be opened on any public screen, and uses the pen definitions of
that screen to determine how it draws the shapes.  This means that you
can begin a download using, say, Term.	Open Yactris on the Term
screen, and play a game while you're waiting for your download to
finish.

Yactris is entirely system friendly.  It steals nothing, checks
everything, and at the very least will exit cleanly on a system error.
It multitasks execellently, and with almost no sluggishness.  It is,
IMHO, a good example of how Amiga games should be coded in order to be
system friendly.

Enjoy Yactris.



II.  System Requirements.



Yactris should run on any Amiga with OS v2.04 and above.  It has
been tested on Amiga 3000s running v2.04 and v2.1 without difficulty,
and I can foresee no reason why it should not work with other
hardware.



III.  Starting Yactris



Yactris can be executed from either Workbench or the CLI.  Simply
double-click the icon or type YacTris once you have opened its
directory to begin.  Yactris will take several command line arguments
or tooltypes.  They are:



    STARTLEVEL=n
	Begin play at Level n.	(Default 0)

    LINESTOINC=n
	Increase the level one after each n lines are removed.
	(Default 10)

    PUBSCREEN=scr
	Open Yactris on the Public Screen named scr. (If the option
	is omitted or scr does not exist, Yactris opens on the default
	public screen.)

    STARTX=n
    STARTY=n
	Open the YacTris window at the given position.


IV.  Playing YacTris


When you first begin Yactris, you will see one window which
contains the play area, a box displaying the next piece to fall, and
an area displaying the score, number of lines cleared, and current
level.	If you don't know what the object of Tetris is, go find a 6-
year-old to tell you.

To start the game, select Start from the Game menu.  Pieces will
begin falling.	Pieces are controlled with the numeric keypad:	'4'
moves a piece left, '6' moves it right, '5' rotates it, and '2' drops
it a line.  Simply hold '2' down to drop a piece to the bottom of the
playfield.

If you wish to pause Yactris, either select Halt from the Game
menu or activate another window.  Reset in the Game menu will clear
the play area and the scores.

If you're a purist who doesn't like to know what's coming next,
you can toggle the display of the next piece under the Settings menu.
If don't believe me when I say that piece selection is totally random,
toggle on Piece Count Display (again under Settings) and see for
yourself.

You can check out the About menu item under Game, but I don't
know why you'd want to.  And Quit is self expanatory.

Last, but not least, if you want to move Yactris to another
screen, select New Public Screen from the Settings menu.  This will
bring up a requester window which will allow you to choose a new
public screen.	Yactris will then move to that screen, pause play, and
wait.

Please Note:  Yactris will WORK on all Public Screens, but it
will not necessarily look good.  How good Yactris looks depends
entirely on how well whatever program it was that opened the public
screen chose its pen values.  Prowrite makes Yactris look extremely
ugly, and two-color screens aren't that great, either.



V.  Scoring



Yactris's scoring system is biased toward those of us who play
suicidally, piling things up and preying for a line.  For every piece
dropped, the player receives one point.  If a single drop clears one
line, the player receives ten points.  Two lines cleared yields 100,
while three gives 1000.  If you can clear four lines at one (a
Tetris), you receive a whopping 10000 points.

The number of lines cleared is also recorded, for those who take
a more meticulous and foresightful approach to Yactris.



VI.  Distribution notes



Yactris is freeware.  It can be freely redistributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License, version 1 or later.  A copy
of the GNU GPL should have been included with this distribution.  If
not, a copy can be obtained by writing to the Free Software
Foundation, 675 Mass Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

You don't have to send anything to anyone if you use Yactris
(although I'm not so stupid that I didn't include my address :] ).



VII.  Programmers' notes

Under the terms of the GNU GPL you are allowed to modify Yactris
so long as credit is given where credit is due.  In order to keep this
program from becoming a total kludge, I'd like to ask a few favors.

The easiest way to modify Yactris is by sending a suggestion to
me and letting me do it.  If you must modify Yactris yourself, please
send a copy to me.  In addition, do not change the number of the
version you modified, simply postpend it with a modification version
number and your initials.  For example, if Paul Strong were to modify
v0.0 he would number 0.0.1PS.  If Sam Boothe were to modify that, the
version would become 0.0.1PS.1SB.  I'm hoping that the mess won't get
that bad, but this method should allow easier tracing of the program's
evolution.  The easiest way is still sending suggestions to me.  I'll
be sure to give all suggestions full consideration, and give the
people who made suggestions that were implemented credit in the
distribution.

Yactris was programmed on Matt Dillon's DICE compiler, about
which I have only a few gripes, all of which should be fixed as soon
as I get my hands on the soon-to-be-released new version.  I also used
Fred Fish's public domain DBUG package.  Since Fred has abandoned the
copyright on DBUG, I'm including my DICE-modified dbug.c and dbug.h
source with the distribution.  The entire DBUG package can be found on
Fish Disk 232.



VIII.  To do



o	Add a player routine that will optionally play selected mods
	during a game.

o	Option to iconify in the middle of a game.

o	Localize, if I can ever get 3.0 stuff :(.
