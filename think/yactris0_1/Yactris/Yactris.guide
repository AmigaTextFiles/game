@NODE INTRO "Introduction and Purpose"

Introduction and Purpose

The name Yactris was coined to mean "Yet Another Clone TRIS."
I'd been having the experience too many times where I start to
download a file, get bored, and have to go over to my neighbors' and
play Tetris clones on his I*M because I had no truly multitasking
games for my Amiga.  From this experience, the concept of Yactris was
born.

Yactris is a bare bones Tetris clones.	It doesn't have a lot of
colors or background graphics for a simple reason.  The Yactris window
can be opened on any public screen, and uses the pen definitions of
that screen to determine how it draws the shapes.  This means that you
can begin a download using, say, Term.	Open Yactris on the Term
screen, and play a game while you're waiting for your download to
finish.

Yactris is entirely system friendly.  It steals nothing, checks
everything, and at the very least will exit cleanly on a system error.
It multitasks execellently, and with almost no sluggishness.  It is,
IMHO, a good example of how Amiga games should be coded in order to be
system friendly.

Enjoy Yactris.

@ENDNODE

@NODE SYSREQ "System Requirements"

System Requirements

Yactris should run on any Amiga with OS v2.04 and above.  It has
been tested on Amiga 3000s running v2.04 and v2.1 without difficulty,
and I can foresee no reason why it should not work with other
hardware.

@ENDNODE

@NODE STARTUP "Starting Yactris"

Starting Yactris

Yactris can be executed from either Workbench or the CLI.  Simply
double-click the icon or type YacTris once you have opened its
directory to begin.  Yactris will take several command line arguments
or tooltypes.  They are:



    @{"STARTLEVEL" LINK REFS 37}=n
	Begin play at Level n.	(Default 0)

    @{"LINESTOINC" LINK REFS 37}=n
	Increase the level one after each n lines are removed.
	(Default 10)

    @{"PUBSCREEN" LINK REFS 37}=scr
	Open Yactris on the Public Screen named scr. (If the option
	is omitted or scr does not exist, Yactris opens on the default
	public screen.)

    @{"STARTX" LINK REFS 37}=n
    @{"STARTY" LINK REFS 37}=n
	Open the YacTris window at the given position.

@ENDNODE

@NODE PLAY "Playing Yactris"

Playing Yactris

When you first begin Yactris, you will see one window which
contains the play area, a box displaying the next piece to fall, and
an area displaying the score, number of lines cleared, and current
level.	If you don't know what the object of Tetris is, go find a 6-
year-old to tell you.

To start the game, select Start from the Game menu.  Pieces will
begin falling.	Pieces are controlled with the numeric keypad:	@{"'4'" LINK REFS}
moves a piece left, @{"'6'" LINK REFS} moves it right, @{"'5'" LINK REFS} rotates it, and @{"'2'" LINK REFS} drops
it a line.  Simply hold @{"'2'" LINK REFS} down to drop a piece to the bottom of the
playfield.

If you wish to pause Yactris, either select @{"Halt" LINK REFS 9} from the Game
menu or activate another window.  @{"Reset" LINK REFS 9} in the Game menu will clear
the play area and the scores.

If you're a purist who doesn't like to know what's coming next,
you can toggle the @{"Show Next" LINK REFS 9} item under the Settings menu.
If don't believe me when I say that piece selection is totally random,
toggle on @{"Show Piece Count" LINK REFS 9} (again under Settings) and see for
yourself.

You can check out the @{"About" LINK REFS 9} menu item under Game, but I don't
know why you'd want to.  And @{"Quit" LINK REFS 9} is self expanatory.

Last, but not least, if you want to move Yactris to another
screen, select @{"New Screen..." LINK REFS 9} from the Settings menu.  This will
bring up a requester window which will allow you to choose a new
public screen.	Yactris will then move to that screen, pause play, and
wait.

Please Note:  Yactris will WORK on all Public Screens, but it
will not necessarily look good.  How good Yactris looks depends
entirely on how well whatever program it was that opened the public
screen chose its pen values.  Prowrite makes Yactris look extremely
ugly, and two-color screens aren't that great, either.

@ENDNODE

@NODE SCORING "Scoring"

Scoring

Yactris's scoring system is biased toward those of us who play
suicidally, piling things up and preying for a line.  For every piece
dropped, the player receives one point.  If a single drop clears one
line, the player receives ten points.  Two lines cleared yields 100,
while three gives 1000.  If you can clear four lines at one (a
Tetris), you receive a whopping 10000 points.

The number of lines cleared is also recorded, for those who take
a more meticulous and foresightful approach to Yactris.

@ENDNODE

@NODE FREEWARE "FreeWare Notes"

Freeware Notes

Yactris is freeware.  It can be freely redistributed under the
terms of the @{"GNU General Public License" LINK GPL}, version 1 or later.  A copy
of the GNU GPL should have been included with this distribution.  If
not, a copy can be obtained by writing to the Free Software
Foundation, 675 Mass Ave., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

You don't have to send anything to anyone if you use Yactris
(although I'm not so stupid that I didn't include my address :] ).

@ENDNODE

@NODE PRGNOTES "Programmers' Notes"

Programmers' Notes

Under the terms of the @{"GNU GPL" LINK GPL} you are allowed to modify Yactris
so long as credit is given where credit is due.  In order to keep this
program from becoming a total kludge, I'd like to ask a few favors.

The easiest way to modify Yactris is by sending a suggestion to
me and letting me do it.  If you must modify Yactris yourself, please
send a copy to me.  In addition, do not change the number of the
version you modified, simply postpend it with a modification version
number and your initials.  For example, if Paul Strong were to modify
v0.0 he would number 0.0.1PS.  If Sam Boothe were to modify that, the
version would become 0.0.1PS.1SB.  I'm hoping that the mess won't get
that bad, but this method should allow easier tracing of the program's
evolution.  The easiest way is still sending suggestions to me.  I'll
be sure to give all suggestions full consideration, and give the
people who made suggestions that were implemented credit in the
distribution.

Yactris was programmed on Matt Dillon's DICE compiler, about
which I have only a few gripes, all of which should be fixed as soon
as I get my hands on the soon-to-be-released new version.  I also used
Fred Fish's public domain DBUG package.  Since Fred has abandoned the
copyright on DBUG, I'm including my DICE-modified dbug.c and dbug.h
source with the distribution.  The entire DBUG package can be found on
Fish Disk 232.

		     Version 1, February 1989

 Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
		    675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.	The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.	Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph
1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either
    with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except
    that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all
    third parties, at your option).

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
    run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
    in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General
    Public License.

    d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
    copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
    exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other work under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge
    for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.	(This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable file, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special
exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard
libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable
file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that
accompany that operating system.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License.
Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use
the Program under this License.  However, parties who have received
copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

  5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based
on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so,
and all its terms and conditions.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these
terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

  7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.	If the Program
specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.	For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy	<name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!
