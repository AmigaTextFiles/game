      Yet Another Clone T R I S


Yep.  Just when you thought you saw the
last Tetris clone for the Amiga (much
less any other computer), Yet Another
CloneTRIS is released.

Of course, such an audacious move must
be accompanied by an appropriate "catch."
Well, it's a pretty great catch.  YACTris
is programmed in COMPLETE adherence to
the 2.04 User Interface Style Guidelines
(what a concept).  BUT THAT'S NOT ALL!

YACTris can be opened on ANY PUBLIC
SCREEN.  Wow!  So when you're downloading
with TERM (blatant endorsement) you can
play Tetris.

It also has an innovative PIECE COUNTER.
"WHY?" you exclaim.  It's to prove that
piece slection routines are totally
random and that CHAOS, not the progr-
ammer, is out to get you.

AND IT'S RELEASED UNDER THE GNU GENERAL
PUBLIC LICENSE.  (Freeware.. Yea!)

Truly, I have not seen a better Tetris
clone.	Tetris will never be the same.
And, if you badger the author (or send
BLOADS of money) he might add the
following updates:

	ICONIFY
	HEAD-to-HEAD
	AI Routine (so you can play your
		    Amiga head-to-head)
	Music (by me!)

Download this.	Love it.  Lust after it.
Enjoy YACtris on any public screen.

P.S.  And now, YacTris is even more
system friendly, using EasyRequests and
DispInfos.  And a couple more TooTypes,
too!
