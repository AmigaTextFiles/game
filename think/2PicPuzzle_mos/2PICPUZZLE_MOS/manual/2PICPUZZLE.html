<B><U>WHAT IS IT ?</U><BR></B><BR>

2PICPUZZLE is a very simple puzzle game with just only one small difference : you have to complete TWO pictures instead of only one :-)<BR><BR>

<B><U>HOW TO PLAY ?</U><BR></B><BR>

It's really simple. Just choose two pics of some nice Amiga games, e.g. these two :<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="2PICPUZZLE_soubory/GRAB1.JPG" <BR><BR>
 
<P>And each of those two pics will be cut to 20 pieces and mixed TOGETHER like this :</P><BR>

<P>Your task is clear : put them both together !</P><BR><BR>

 

<B><U><P>MOVING TILES</P></U><BR></B>

If you want to move any tile, just click on it with left mouse button. The selected tile will be highlighted by a checkmark like this :<BR><BR>

<P>Then click on another tile and those two tiles will swap their positions and so you should do until both pictures are complete !</P><BR>

It doesn't matter if you complete a picture in left or right window so it can be like this :<BR><BR>

Or like this : <BR><BR>

<B><U><P>YOUR OWN PICTURES IN THE GAME</P></U><BR></B>

<P>Well, you may not like my set of Amiga games pictures but don't be sad : you can very easily put pictures of your own Amiga (or even not Amiga :-) ) games in 2PICPUZZLE ! In the "pix" drawer there are "pix01", "pix02" etc... "pix01" is Superfrog so If you want to have for example Dungeon Master, get a screenshot from it, rename it to "pix01" and copy it to "pix" drawer instead of original "pix01" file and Dungeon Master is now in the game ! :-) Your picture should be exactly 320x256. You can even use pictures larger than 320x256 but only 320x256 part of it will be used and it will be incomplete :-)</P><BR>

<P>Please také note that picture format should be iff, jpg, png or gif , if you use a format that is not supported, you get an error mesage and the game won't start :-)</P><BR>

 

<P>Have fun :-) Petr "pecaN" Kaderka 2016</P><BR>
