WHAT IS THIS THING?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
IFF TO TILES is a small tool that is able to convert tiles drew with paint
programs to special type of files. So, you can load these files with HIT
TILES 2 SPECIAL EDITION. To draw the tiles, I advice to utilize the file
EMPTY_ECS.pic or EMPTY_AGA.pic in directory "TilesPics". For the drawing
of the tiles you can respect the following rules: you can use all the
32/256 colours, without limitations, but remember the colours 29, 30 and 31
are for the pointer (so, chose colours that have a good contrast with the
tiles). NOTE, on ECS machines you can convert only ECS (32 colorus)
pictures. The ECS tiles format is identical at the old format used in HIT
TILES 2, so you can use the old tiles even in HIT TILES 2 SPECIAL EDITION
(and vice versa).
