PREFACE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Well, now my old games ("HIT PUZZLE" and "HIT TILES 2 SPECIAL EDITION") are
freeware. Why? Mhhh, first, unfortunately I haven't much time to use our
lovely Amiga. Second, I don't like the road that has taken our Amiga (Amiga
OS 3.5, why???). Third, I have stayed alone now here, in fact, I and my
friends (Amigians) have become old and few of us have yet the Amiga (was
beautiful stay all together at home of one of us and see demos...), so it's
more difficult to find someone that help me (how find someone that use still
the ProTracker to make music, is quite impossible...). Maybe it's right so,
maybe it's a bit sad, even if, maybe we need to be satisfied of nice things
until they last. Anyway, in every case, Amiga rulez!

WHAT IS THIS THING?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HIT TILES 2 SPECIAL EDITION is a game based on the well-known oriental game
called Shanghai. It consists of 15 levels, each one featuring a screen made
up of 120 tiles placed in piles up to 4 high. In every screen there are 4 of
each tile. The aim of the game is to remove all of the tiles from the screen.
The main and only rule you have to keep in mind is this: You can only remove
2 equals tiles at a time ad both must have an empty place on either the left
or the right hand side.

I'm searching musicians for simply projects (little games, music disk, etc.).
Concerns me every type of protracker modules. Each module used in my
projects, will have the author's name in the credits obviously, and for those
who want, their home/e-mail address and a short message.

Are there some Japanese Amigians? If yes, please contact me :-)
