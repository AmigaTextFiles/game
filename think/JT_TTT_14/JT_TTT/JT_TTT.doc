    TTT_NTSC            for IconX


2)  Installation


    Copy this drawer to a place of your harddisk or a disk.

    That's it.



3)  The game


    Your goal is to get a line, horizontal, vertical or diagonal with your
    symbol on a field 3x3.

    If you use a PAL-Amiga and don't like the fullscreen display, you can
    run TTT_NTSC (Screen is only 200 lines high).


    The menu:

    Start       Start one game

    Stop        Stop the current game

    Players     Choose 1 or 2 player mode

    Names       Type in your name

    Quit        ???


4)  Bugs


    - Names-Requester sometimes hangs...

    - Default Font should be set to "topaz 8".


    If you find more, let me know.
