Secrecy is a FileShare 2-4 player strategy/tactics game.

FileShare, means that all players share the same 'savefile'.
Each player take turns buying and/or moving units,
and just sends the gamefile to the next player.


These are the units:

1.Rock
2.Paper
3.Scissors

As you might see,
it has features based on the famous Rock-Paper-Scissors hand game.

A Rock unit can kill a Scissors unit.
A Paper unit can kill a Rock unit.
A Scissors unit can kill a Paper unit.


The title reflects an additional feature
that make it possible to trick your enemies.

When you buy a unit,
you can select how far it can move each round.
The unit will cost more, the more moves you select.
Much more...

The cool thing, is that the other players
have no idea how many moves you select for your units,
and doesnt know how much money you have either,
so that they cant assume anything.

A unit's movepoints will be revealed if you use them
at any time, it will then be known to all players
that it can move that far, forever, untill it is killed.

One way to take advantage of this
is to pretend that you have only bought a slow unit
by moving slowly each round,
when infact you have bought the fastest.
And then when the opportunity arise,
you jump at the enemy.


The aim of the game
is to get one of your units
on the base of any of the other players.
That player will then lose,
and wont be able to buy or move units anymore.

The player that 'freeze' an other player
receives a money bonus of 5$ for every unit that enemy player has,
so freezing a powerfull enemy pays off.

Each player will start with 50$,
and get 1$ for every moneypoint they have occupied with a unit.




The arena editor is very easy to use:
Just hold down any of those keys
you see in the menu,
and draw with your mousepointer.

Each arena should have:
-Atleast 2 bases with one being purple.
-normal blocks to move on.
-some moneypoints placed fairly around.

The game will know that a created arena is for 2 players
if there are only 2 different bases.
likewise for 3 and 4.




Q:
I cant move my units after I buy them.

A:
I calculated that if one could move them right after buying,
then a player could always manage to defend his base,
without problems, and so it wouldnt be as fun.
Solution: Move them in your next turn.

Secrecy multitasks and does not play any sounds
so that you can listen to music and/or do other things
while waiting for the other players.



If there are numbered gamefiles in the used dir,
like this:

SGF
SGF.2
SGF.3
SGF.4

Then the SGF.4 is loaded
and also saved to.
