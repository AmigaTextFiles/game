"Ye Olde Pong" is a clone of the Pong game that was released on the
Atari 2600 platform during the early 80's. The purpose of this program
is primarily to familiarize the authors with working with outside
libraries, but the SDL library in particular. As was mentioned before,
this program is based on SDL and is very simple in nature.
