                    A Game Of Strategy And Skill


About the Program;

    Mined Out V1.0 is a remake of the equal named BASIC program from
    Ian Andrews for the Sinclair Spektrum (The best computer ever
    but only the AMIGA makes it possible).
    Mined Out V1.0 is a strategy game, like Mine from Thomas Ansorge
    (Fish #725) or AMines from Manfred Huesmann (Fish #707).
    I have written this to get familiar with the C language.
    Like Mine this has also the possibility of variabel play field
    sizes. The difference is that you have not to find all the mines
    laying around. You have to find a way from the bottom to the top
    to escape the Computer Enemy.


The Story:

    Well. You are in the desert, after escaping the prisoners camp north
    of Kuwait. South of you is the camp and the freedom lies north of you.
    Before you lies the deadly mine field.
    It's amazing but you have a mine detector.
    This shows how many mines are in your surrounding (left, right, up
    and below of you) but not where. So you decide to move also only in
    these directions.
    If you are a lucky one you will find dynamite. With that you
    can remove the mines.
    After a while the notice your absence and send someone to catch you...


Loading Mined Out V1.0:

    After loading, by clicking it's icon twice, the program tries to open a window
    as large as possible. It's no matter if you have a HIRES or a SuperHIRES
    or interlaced workbench. If you have, for example, a workbench with
    650 x 235 pixels you will not be able to move this window.
    In this case you should change the workbench size by a few pixels or
    load this from the CLI with

        Mined_Out [Columns Rows]

    The least size for Columns is 23 and the largest 100.
    For Rows 15 respectively 80.
    To use, for example, Mined_Out 100 80 you have to need a workbench
    with 1610 x 675 pixels. In this case you (probabily) cannot see the
    signal of the mine detector, but you can still listen to it. After
    pressing the key `s' the mine detector will warn you again.
    If desired I can make a window (which you can drag around) with the
    mine detection signal in it.


Hardware:

    This works best with OS 2.0. To use under Kickstart you should
    change the colors.

Mined Out V1.0 Window:

    You should always look at the window title.
      If you trying, for example, to move over the window you will get
      here a message.
    Top left stands the name of the program.
    Under that you see the display of the mine detector.
      If this is in Inverse Video than you are in danger to run into
      a mine. Try to move around. Every move the display will change
      and you get also an acustic warning.
      The bottom line is always free of mines.
    Score:
      For every row you get Level * 100 points, minus 1 point for
      every move. By reaching the top row you get
      (Level - 1) * 1000 points.
      To reach freedom you have to move one step further or I assume
      you want to get back.
    Moves:
      Keep them low.
    Dynamit:
      With that you can remove mines and ... yourself.
    Mines:
      So many errors to make and no help in sight.
      But wait , ... , have I seen , ... , no , ... , yes , ... , YES , ... ,
      can it be the possibility , ... , I have seen P... , ... , Aaarrrghhhh ,
      I have forgotten his name.
    Time:
      Have you set your system time?


Steering:

    You can move your figure in four directions (left, right, up and
    dorn) with the arrow keys, numeric key pad (4, 6, 8 and 2) or with
    the keys l, r, u and d (Hello AMIGA 600 users).
    The bottom row is always free of mines, but there is no way back
    to the prisoner's camp.


Dynamite:

    If you have this, you only need to press one of the SHIFT or
    ALT keys in combination with one of the steering keys to lay
    dynamite in this direction and fire it.
    You know (by experience?) that dynamite can be deadly.
    So move at least three squares away. After your fourth move it will
    explode.
    If dynamite can remove mines and probably you why not someone else?


Menu:

    Level:
      There are 6 different levels:

         Level:               Mines            Enemy appears after your

         - Novice             every 7   field     10 move
         - Easy               every 6   field     15 move
         - Professional       every 5   field     30 move
         - Clairvoyant        every 4   field     50 move
         - Sure Death         every 3   field    100 move + 1 dynamite
         - I Feel Like God    every 2.5 field    150 move + 1 dynamite

      Any modification will only take place after choosing End Game.
      In Novice and Easy there will be no dynamite to find.

    Cookies:
      With that you can switch the Fortune Cookies on and off.

    Action Replay:
      After reaching freedom you can see how well you have played
      Mined Out V1.0. Or if you have failed you can see how you can
      make it better ... in your next life.

    Show Highscores:
      This shows the highscore list from the level you have choosed
      under Level.

    About:
      My address.

    End Game:
      You will doing suicide, really ?

    Quit:
      I know, this game makes you addicted, but that is not my fault.
      You should choose this after playing two hours, or in the next
      version this will be done automatically.


Music:

    Mined Out V1.0 uses a simple Beep routine, like the Beep
    from the good old Sinclair Spectrum.
    In data/Music.dat are a sequence of frequencies and their duration.
    You can change them and send me better music if you like.


Fortune Cookies:

    I have taken the fortune cookies from the program Cookie by
    Richard P.Stevens from the Fish #65. I have written my own
    routine to load them and included the C-Source for that.
    Please note the copyright.
    For german speaking people I have also included Manta_Witze.
    You can use them after renaming them to Cookie.dat.
    (Manta is a german car and Witze are jokes about the drivers)
    I have taken this from the Franz PD #122 done by Gerald Zorn.
    If you are low on memory you can remove Cookie.dat from the
    search path. This will save about 40 KBytes (Disk and RAM).

    To use the C-Source you have to write something like:

#include <everything>

BOOL  Test_Modus = ...
UWORD WBenchScreen_Width = 640,
      WBenchScreen_Width = 200;
struct TextFont ...

main()
{
  Load_Cookies();
  while (TRUE)
  {
    Print_Cookie();        /* Every minute a fortune cookie */
    Delay(50*60);
  }
}


Thanks must go to:

   Leo L.Schwab for his program Tilt. This has shown me how to get
   the pixels of the workbench screen.
   Hartmut Göbel for his AmokEd.
   Matthew Dillon (and Stefan Becker) has already received
   my 85 thanks (Or was it 85,--DM).
   Albert-Jan Brouwer, Peter Struijk, Paul van der Valk and
   Erwin Zwart for the Imploder.
   Stefan Becker for his Toolmanager.
