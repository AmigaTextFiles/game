         Anders Bjerin produced this excellent package, from which I
         have learnt an immense amount.It is not for the learner who
         wishes to learn C but for the experienced programmer who
         wishes to learn more Amiga specific coding.

         The @{"Sound" LINK SOUND} in this package uses his excellent package

                    EASYSOUND


        Thanks to Anders,I personally would like to see un updated
        version for the new Workbenchs.
