@NODE Rules "Rules"

 @{b}@{u}Game rules@{ub}@{uu}

 Each player has draughts in different color. When moving one
 field, number of draughts increases, moving two fields makes
 the draught jump to the selected field. You can't move two
 fields in horizontal and vertical in one time (for example
 two right and two down), but you can move for example two fields
 right and one down.

 If near the field on which the move has been done there are some
 opponents' draughts, they change their color to color of player
 making the move. Game ends when there are no empty fields left
 or if only one player can make next move (player which can't make
 move when it's his turn, falls out of the game). Player which
 has the largest number of draughts or stays longest in game, wins.
