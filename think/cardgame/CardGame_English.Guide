		      	 	CARDGAME
				+-+-+-+-

	  As its name tell it, this game is a cardgame, relatively 
	not well known.
	
	The base system is to announce the number of pleats you think
	you'll can do with yours cards, and to do anything to realise
	it...

@node install "Installation"

	
	That's very simple:

	In the disk, there are some files and directories :

	- Create a folder (Ex:CardGame) in your game directory,
	  and copy all the files in this new dir.

	- Copy the content of each directory of the disk in the
	  corresponding one in your HD, for each file who doesn't
	  exists yet. (BUT NOT THE S DIRECTORY)	

	Note: As the disk is about to be full, we couldn't put
	      all the required utilities as multiview or more, but
     	      you normally have them in your Sys:Utilities/ folder.
	      	
					Finished !

   Notes from the Coder, E.L :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

	I just want to give you some little precisions concerning the
	game: 
	The cards' rotation isn't precalculated, and the computer
	is playing as any other player (He doesn't "see" the player 
	cards !)...

	The counted time is increased only during the reflexions phases.
	(Choice of number of pleats, choice of playing a card).


   Notes from the Graphist G.L :

  Cherche codeur volontaire et courageux pour gestion de 400 vues d'un
petit mec.
  Plus sérieusement , cherche contacts cools et motivés (Codeurs , 
graphistes , musiciens ) pour développer de nouveaux produits .
Malgré les protestations du codeur, les amateurs sont aussi les
bienvenus ( surtout les nanas comme le souffle le codeur ).

	- Greetings, load of fonts.

	- Menu, Start of the music "Melodance"
	
		Game ........ : Start the game
		Briefing .... : Explications concerning the rules
		Dos cartes .. : Choice of the cards back
		Hall Of Fames : Best players (Automatically saved in S:)
		Quitter ..... : Quit...


	- Game screen

	The computer is situated on the upper of the screen, and
	the human player is on the bottom.
	Each player has three numbers :

	  * On the left, the number of pleats you must do to win. 
	    Yellow: You must do some pleats.
	    Blue  : You musn't do any more pleat.
	    Red   : You have made too mutch pleats.

	  * On the right :  E (+F)

		 E: Number of points.
		   (We doesn't care of the actual deal)
		 F: Change of the score since the previous deal.
	Exemple : 60 (-6) means that we just loose 6 points
		  and that we actually have 60 points.


	The choose of the card to play is made with the arrows on the
	keyboard, and Return or up arrow validates.

	You can press 'ESCape' pratically when you want during the game,
	to get back to the menu.
