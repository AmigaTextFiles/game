-Need diskfont library, Run and KjetlisII/Kjetlis2MusicPlayer to work.
-Can be spread legally without this doc file as long as you dont sell it.
-Wont work with 0.5 meg machines. send three disks to me to get Kjetlis I.
 It is the same game, but bad graphics, music and animations.
-Haven't tested it on other machines than myself. An A500, 2 meg, 1.3,
 but there is no hacks.
-The music is a remix of an old modules made for the gathering 1992,
 called "The-song-without-2".
-Reed the scrolltext.
-No known bugs.
-I dont think I am a member of Gothic Harlot any more, but I was too
