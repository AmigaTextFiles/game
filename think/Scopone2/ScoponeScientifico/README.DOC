        Scopone Scientifico by Francesco Doro (fdoro@gpnet.it)

  This is a very popular italian card game (very popular in Italy of
course) and it's my favourite card game.  I think I wrote this Amiga
version four or five years ago but it has never been published and AFAIK
there are no other Amiga versions of this game so here it is.

  Don't expect great graphics or programming, probably this was my first
attempt to write something for Amiga.  Try it only if you are really
interested in this card game and you want to play it with Amiga at all
cost.  Probably only italian people may want to try it.

  This is a four players card game; you are one of these, the others are
virtual.  In this archive you don't find docs about the rules of the game
so you must already know them.

  The game uses italian language.

  It has been developed under OS 1.3 but I've found it can work well on any
Amiga and O.S.  version.  On A4000/040 sometimes it crashes at the start
but usually disabling fast mem can fix it.

*** CHANGES IN V2:

- Now Scopone Scientifico has a beautiful set of italian cards, thanks to
Giuseppe Mammano.

- Cards' bitmaps are loaded from an external iff file; you can draw your
personal card set.  The old (and ugly) french set is still in the archive
for those who are accustomed to play Scopone with it.

- Double-click plays card.
