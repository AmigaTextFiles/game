 Introduction
--------------

    Number 100 is a simple guessing game, the idea is to guess the number
the computer is thinking, for added fun i've enclueded a Lowscore the idea
of the low score is to see who can guess the number in the lowest amount of
guess's, if your amount of guess's is less than the lowest score so far
you'll be asked to enter your name, and your the Lowest Lowscore :) In this
version (1.0) you can now customize your own numbers. NEW in this version
(1.5) you can have a very hard and challenging level, you can also install
in to your HD.

 Instructions
--------------

    After you've passed the title screen, help screen and the lowscore
screen you then need to pick which game you want to play, you can pick from
either Small Game numbers 0 to 100, Big game 0 - 10000 or you can have a 
customized game where you enter what number it goes up to, the option are
explained below.

Small Game 0 - 100

What you have to do is enter a number, and the computer will then tell you 
weather the number you entered is lower or higher than the number it's thinking.
There is a lowscore to see who can guess the answer in the lowest amount of 
guessing, if you do your score is saved. The number is between 0 and 100.

Big Game 0 - 10000

This is very like the small game, the thing about this is that it's alot
harder and takes more time to complete, have fun!

Custom Game

When you start this game it will say Enter a number, this is the number you
want the randoming to go UP to, enter any number, then press return, the
game has now started, you now have to guess the number between 0 and the
number you typed in. NOTE : The lowscore is NOT for the custom game only
for the Small 0 to 100 game.
