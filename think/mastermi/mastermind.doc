0. System requirements

As far as I've been able to check, there shouldn't be any problem to run
MasterMind on any Amiga. Somebody told me he could not hear any sound,
but he has some weird EGS-card in his A3000 I believe. The game runs on
KS 1.x/2.x/3.x.

1. HOW TO PLAY MASTERMIND

Start the game from CLI or WorkBench. A new screen appears from which
you can choose the colours by clicking on the colour gadgets. These
can be found on the right in the middle of the screen. When you click,
the chosen colour appears on the playfield. Choose 4 colours and click
on [43m[32mOk[0m. Now black and or white boxes appear and they tell you if
any colour is good (black) or half good (white). Good means right colour on
the right place and half good means right colour only wrong place.


2. QUIT (Why do you want to???) / NewGame

You can Quit or start a New game at almost any time. Also you can start or
stop the music at any time by clicking on the Music Off / Music on gadget!!!
Amazing isn't it. The Undo button can be clicked on while 'thinking' or when
you pressed a wrong colour. The last entered colour will be removed. You can
also use the position cursor.


3. 6 / 8 COLOURS

If you want to, you can also choose the "8 Colours" gadget. Now you can make
a choice out of 8 colours, or 6 if you click again.


4. MUSIC


There's also music in the game. I can imagine you don't like the music so
there is a gadget to turn it off (or on again if you want your nasty little
brother to leave you alone).


5. TIMER

A feature added in V1.4 is the timer. With the timer button you can select the
maximum thinking time between two attempts. If 0, then you may think for ever..
The maximum time you may enter is 99. Click inside the red box and use the
keyboard to enter the numbers. Then press "Ok" if you are satisfied or "No"
if you think the old timelimit was ok.
In game if you do not think fast enough, the yellow arrow will jump to the
next line, so be carefull choosing the timelimit. A brown cross also appears
to tell you this attempt is invalid. Needles to mention that it is stupid to
choose 1 second as the timelimit. The timer will not work in conjuction with
the THINK button.
From now on, you can see how much time is left to think.
The default think time is 20 seconds.


6. THINK  (new in V1.5)

If you click "THINK" then the computer will think 5 attempts for you in 6
colour mode or 6 attempts in 8 colour mode. It is your turn after the
computer has finished thinking and the yellow arrow point to the next empty
field. Sometimes it's impossible to get to a solution, as the computer is
not smart. (And I am a lazy/lousy programmer, as you already guessed)
I can tell you it's my favorite option.


7. New way to place the colours: the position cursor

Since V1.6 you can enter the colours in any order you want. Next to the old way
you can click on a position gadget now to tell the Amiga where you want the
colour to be placed. The position cursor shows where the next chosen colour
will be placed. Click on one of the black fields to change the place. Choose
then the desired colour and, how strange, it will be placed there! After
clicking a colour the position will jump to the next EMPTY field. If you want
to change an already choosen colour, just click on the corresponding position.
If all fields are full, the cursor will only jump to the next position.
A usefull situation is when you only want to change colour one as an example,
if you already had choosen all other colours. Now you don't have to delete
them all to replace only the first.


8. UNDO

When you click the undo button, the last entered colour will disappear.
If you click the position cursor, and then undo, the current position will
be cleared. Maybe UNDO is a bit obsolete since the position cursor, but I
think it's harmless.


9. SCREEN TO BACK

If you click on the screen at the top somewhere, the screen will "dissappear"
to the back so you can use the WorkBench for example.


10. CHEAT

It is possible to cheat! Huh??? In a game like this? Yes, you can get the
solution in one way, I added this "feature" for developing purposes actually
(for checking etc) but feel free to click around! There are some hidden,
well, jokes.


11. THANKS / ECT

I hope the game is bug free, if any bug found, send e-mail to the address 
below.

Thanks to the following people:

- Anders Bjerin for the excellent ACM (Amiga C Manual) for the
  numerous tips how to program the mighty Amiga!
- Teijo Kinnunen for his excellent Octamed and the playing routines.
- Eric ter Beek for testing and graphical advice.
- Edo Nijmeijer for testing Mastermind on his accellerated A1200 and giving
  a usefull suggestion (Almost impossible ;-))
  Actually he suggested more! Amazing!
- John A. Scott for putting MasterMind on aminet!
- Sorry that I ripped things from Kick-Off. I am just worlds biggest fan of
  this incredible game!!! Thanks DINO DINI!

Have Fun!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in this version (V1.6):

- Added the position cursor, and changed some related stuff.
- You can see now how much time is left for thinking.
- A new gag added, which happens when clicking "somewhere" with the mouse
  but it does also occur at random. What it is? It has something to do with
  the little Kick Off players ...
- Another thing changed with a Kick Off player
- Changed the music. The music isn't really a Computer and/or MasterMind think
  music, but I really do not like House and related "music". I actually prefer
  Death metal like Napalm Death, but the new music isn't metal.
- Linked all external files into one MasterMind executable. No longer need for
  octaplayer.library. One advantage is that loading from floppy is faster now.
- Default think time increased to 20 seconds, as 15 seconds was even too short
  for me ...
- If you really cannot find the solution, notice what happens! (Try it)
- Bug fix, only cannot remember what it was. Anyway, it was difficult to find
  the fault. Oh yeah, I remember. Sometimes the "Ok" button didn't work.
  This "sometimes" made it very hard to recreate the situations when "Ok"
  failed to work.
- Hopefully improved the think option. It had a stupid error which I will not
  mention here, I am to embarrassed... and it seems to work alright now!
- Changed the guru message. I got a complaint from a former Commodore Amiga
  Technical Support Engineer about multisync monitor behaviour when using the
  alert message. Hope he is satisfied now!
- Changed the Mastermind Logo.
