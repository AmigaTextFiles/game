@node 3 "The game"

The aim of this game is to get four stones of your colour (white) in a row.
Rows can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
The player and the computer alternately put a stone on the board. There is
gravity, so when you enter a stone into a certain column, it will 'fall down'
onto the lowest free place.
