There are several variations on the rules.

Every player has six bins, and one collector bin.
There are some "stones" in every bin.
The player select a bin, and pick up all of stones from it. Moving counterclockwise, put one "stone" into every bins.

Example:
                      Start:

                      3  3  3  3  3  3
                   0                    0  <- own collector bin
                      3  3  3  3  3  3     ---> moving direction
                                     ^
                      Moving:

                      3  3  3  3  4  4
                   0                    1 <- winnings
                      3  3  3  3  3  0

If your last stone lands in an empty bin, it is added to your total, and any stones in the opposite bin are added as well. It is called "robbery".
It is called "robbery".

                      Start:

                      1  4  0  3  2  3
                   0                    0
                      2  2  3  1  6  0
                                  ^
                      Moving:
                            |--------------- last stone
                      1  4  1  4  3  4
                   0                    1 <- winnings
                      2  2  3  1  0  1

                      Robbery:
                            *
                      1  4  0  4  3  4
                   0                    5 <- winnings
                      2  2  0  1  0  1
                            *

If your last stone lands in your collector bin, you have another turn (just once!).

The game is over:
If a player can't move (left with no stones in his row), or a player has more the half of stones in his collector bin.
The winner is the player with the highest number of stones in their collector bin.
