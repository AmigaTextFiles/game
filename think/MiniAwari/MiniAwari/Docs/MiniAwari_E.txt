Awari is an ancient African board game, believed to be over 3500 years old. The game is known by many different names, including "Wari", "Awale", "Oware", and "Ayo". There are several variations on the rules.
There are many variants of the game, from the number of stones in each bin at the start of the game through to how each of the stones is actually won.
The objective of the game is to move your stones from the bins at the bottom of the window into your collector bin on the right hand side.

How to play the game!

The game always moves counterclockwise. Start by selecting a bin of stones from the bottom row.
After you have made your selection, each bin increases by 1 counterclockwise, until all the stones you picked up have been used.
If your stone lands in your collector bin, your score increases by 1.
If your last stone lands in your collector bin, you have another turn (just once!).
If your last stone lands in an empty bin, it is added to your total, and any stones in the opposite bin are added as well. It is called "robbery".
The game is over:
If a player can't move (left with no stones in his row), or a player has more the half of stones in his collector bin.
The winner is the player with the highest number of stones in their collector bin.
