   This editor was written by Mopz, using "AMOS the Creator" (it rules!).
It  may  only  be  distributed via the original Bloog-archive. The levels
created  with  BLEd  may be distributed if you also send them to me, Mopz
(marjoh@algonet.se).
    I  am  at  this  moment (98-03-31 at 15:38) very interested in levels
that  could  be  included  in the full version, because I'm very short on
time  for  doing  all  of  'em myself. So if you've got a tricky mind and
if you work for nothing (but your name in the game) just get in touch :-)


L e v e l s
   You  can  change  and add levels just as you want to, but they must be
presented  in  the  directory "levels". Level one must be named "01.map",
level two "02.map", level three "03.map"... level nintynine "99.map".

LOAD    L           Load a level.

SAVE    S           Save  a level. After entering the filename, you'll be
                    asked  for  two  values. "Keys" is the amount of keys
                    needed  to finish level. "Timebonus" is the timelimit
                    (in  seconds)  for getting extra score when the level
                    is finished. Keys may NEVER have a value greater than
                    6!
