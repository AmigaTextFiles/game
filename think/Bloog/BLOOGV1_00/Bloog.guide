I  - Mopz - made this game just for fun. I was so incredibly tired of the
'big'  projects  (Groundwars,  FaYoh),  and  thought  i  needed to create
something smaller, simplier.

Created using:
   @{b}Blitz Basic@{ub}       - Acid Software
   @{b}AMOS@{ub}              - Mandarin Software
   @{b}Personal Paint@{ub}    - Cloanto

@{u}M a i l w a r e@{uu}
   Everytime  I see a nice game, I send the author an e-mail about it and
give  him/her my opinion. But in order to pay for the game, it has really
got  to be good. This game isn't good enough to be payed for, and that is
why I decided to make it mailware. If you like it, and would care for the
full  version, just send me an e- or snailmail. If you send snail, you've
got to include a disk and money for stamps.
   If  you  wish to include this game on a magazine's coverdisk, you have
got to do the very same thing.

These are the limitations:
   No intro
   No outro (played when last level is completed at any levelset)
   You can't save hiscore
   The game doesn't accept more than 10 levels (99 in full)
   Only one piece of ingame-music (4 or more in full)

Due  to  horrible  schoolwork etc, the full game won't be available until
beginning  of  May '98. But sendning me mail NOW, will bring you the game
as soon as it's available.

@{u}S t o r y@{uu}
   Bloog  was  out  doing his morningwalk, when he all of a sudden caught
sight  of  a  tower,  almost touching the clouds with its peek. He walked
towards  the  building  and  noticed  a sign, saying: "This is a deserted
Maze.  Do  NOT  enter!" Bloog, whose brain wasn't more evolved than a PC,
wrecked the sign and opened the tower's door. He stepped in, and the door
slammed behind him. He was locked inside.
   You  monitor Bloog and has got to help him through a shitload of maze-
floors  to  get  to  the top - from where Bloog can easily jump down (200
feet or so) to the ground outside...

That  Bloog  is a green blob with big eyes 'n' feet, a mouth and no arms,
has  got  absolutely  nothing to do with @{b}FaYoh@{ub} - another green blob. It's
just the author of the game who's got lousy imagination!

@node 7 "What to do"


@{u}W h a t  t o  do@{uu}
   The aim of a level is to find a set of keys. Sometimes, keys can be on
the  floor  when  you  enter a level. Most keys though, are hidden inside
colored  blocks.  If you smack two blocks together, and if they're of the
same  color, both blocks will disappear and a key will pop up. But if the
blocks  are  different colored, the one being hit will be destroyed while
the  otherone remains intact. Blocks can ofcourse be painted with another
color - read more about it in the chapter 'Special objects'.
   The first levels introduce you to the basic objects one at a time, but
after  that,  things  get  far  more complicated than you could ever have
thought was possible ;-)

@{u}C o n t r o l@{uu}
   You  can  control  the  Bloog-creature  with  a joystick or a keyboard
(read the chapter 'Options'!). If with a keyboard, FIRE is represented by
the SPACE-key and directions by the cursorkeys.

@{b}LEFT@{ub}    - Walk or push a block left.

@{b}RIGHT@{ub}   - Walk or push a block right.

@{b}UP@{ub}      - Walk or push a block up

@{b}DOWN@{ub}    - Walk or push a block down.

@{b}FIRE@{ub}    - Use  a  teleport-heart  (read  the chapter 'Special objects'!).
Bloog will travel in his face-direction untill he hits a wall.

@{b}ESC-key@{ub} - Restart level.

@{b}Q-key@{ub}   - Exit to title

@{u}S p e c i a l  o b j e c t s@{uu}
   There's  a  shitload  of things to pick up, and to be afraid of. Learn
how everything works through the first levels!

@{b}Star@{ub}           - With one of these, you can walk on leathal lava. Bloog's
shoes get blue.

@{b}Heart@{ub}          - You  can  only  carry  one at a time. It's a teleporter-
heart,  used  to move in one direction. The only thing that can stop your
travel  is  a  normal wall. It's perfect when you wish to pass a field of
spikes or lava.

@{b}Blue diamond@{ub}   - 5 points.

@{b}Red diamond@{ub}    - 10 points.

@{b}Yellow diamond@{ub} - 50 points.

@{b}Key@{ub}            - Collect a certain amount, displayed on the scoreline, to
finish a level.

@{b}Lava@{ub}           - Very  dangerous,  but can be walked on after consuming a
star.

@{b}Spikes@{ub}         - Worse than lava! You can't touch 'em at all.

@{b}Arrows@{ub}         - A floortile with an arrow moving left/right/up/down. You
can  only  step  on  'em  from  the arrow's direction, and then you'll be
transported in the same direction.

@{b}Blocks@{ub}         - Theese  blocks  can  be  pushed  around. There are three
different colors - yellow(Y), red(R), blue(B). If you push Y into another
Y,  both  blocks  will be destroyed and there'll be a key for you to pick
up.  If you push Y into an R or a B, R or B will be destroyed, but Y will
stay solid.

@{b}Squares@{ub}        - The  ink-squares  wear the same colors as the blocks. If
you  place a block on a square, the square will disappear while the block
gets its color.
