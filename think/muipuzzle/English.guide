@NODE readme "README"

Perhaps you've been wondering why I've chosen such a stupid name. It's my
answers to these (IMHO) idiots who've started this 'MUI Replacement Project'
stuff on usenet. (Flames to /dev/null or >NIL:)

@ENDNODE
@NODE allgemeines "About"

MUI Puzzle was written for only one reason. I've been sitting in my room,
I've watched TV (STTNG) and suddenly I was tired of doing absolutely
nothing at all. That's the result of only 2 hours. One reason for this
game is to show all of you how easy MUI programming is. Have Fun.
@ENDNODE
@NODE kopieren "Distribution"

MUI Puzzle is Mailware. You may copy it to all of your friends, but it
would be kind if you'd send me a postcard or a letter or even a EMail if
you like this game.

Public Domain series:

Permission is granted for Fred Fish and SaarAg. All other series may use
this program as long as they don't charge more then 5 US-$ or 6 DM for a
single disk. It would be nice too if they'd send me a short note.

Mailboxes, etc:

I'm going to spread this game via Aminet. But other Mailboxen may use it
too.

Magazines:

You may put it on your coverdisks. But it would be kind if you'd send me a
note and if you'd send me the magazine for my collection :c)

Rights:

The copyright of this program is mine. But I can't take any responsibility
for possible damages made by this game. This archive may only be distributed
in original state.

Important:

Persons who support violence against foreigners aren't allowed to use this
game.

@NODE steuerung "Steering"

It's simple. Click on the tiles or use the cursor keys to select a tile
and the return key to press this tile. Use Shift+Cursor to jump to the
end of the line/column.
@ENDNODE
@NODE system "Hardware"

    Simply take an Amiga with at least Kickstart 2.0 :c)
    Further on you'll need @{"MUI" link mui} 2.0

    Hint:
    =====

    If you're no registered MUI User by now, simply pay your fee to @{"Stefan" link mui}
    and you'll receive your own Keyfile pretty soon and you'll support the
    development of such packages.
@ENDNODE
