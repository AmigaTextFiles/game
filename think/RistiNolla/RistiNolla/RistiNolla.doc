06.Sept.1987 in Finland

  This is my first version of RistiNolla game. RistiNolla is name of this
game in Finnish and means something like CrossZero. This game is also called
as Go-Moku (what a name).
  Current version (1.0) is compiled with Lattice 3.3. Despite Lattice's lazy
code this program makes its decisions immediately and is only 24k long. That
is pretty short for graphics Artifical Intelligence -program made in C. This
version should be fully debugged in order to keep your interest in playing
instead of waiting for Guru's next appearance.
  This program is shareware and anyone finding this program useful will be
expected (and hoped) to send a nice postcard about his/her country to me.
Voluntary $10 will be received warmly. If you send me ten bucks I will send
you the new version (when it is ready) plus a disk. Cheap is it?

  For anybody wanting to know how this program works and why it is so damned
good I can tell that it is my own algorithm and I haven't even looked at
anyone else's code that plays Go-Moku or Tic-Tac-Toe because I thought it
could only mess up my own strategy.
  I am going to start studying PROLOG at the local University of Technology
and construct this algorithm in PROLOG in the near future. Before that I will
make this C version to think ahead in order to make it perfect Master. I have
already started to add new features and logic to it and it will be complete
before winter -87.
  If you happen to find out anything useful for me, please let me know and I
can send you free copy of the new version.
Thank you for reading this introduction and thank you Mr. Fish for
distributing Amiga software and knowledge.
