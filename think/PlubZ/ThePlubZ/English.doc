  Dear diary..

Usually, I don't do this diary stuff, but now I just HAVE to! My Dagmar
Schwarzbads-diary starts now!
 At last! At last it has happened! We have made contact. I never thought
it would happend. Think about it; just a couple of weaks ago, my life was
dedicated to my stamp-colection. But that doesn't feel important anymore.
It is NOTHING compared to PlubZ.
 It has gone two hours since they arived! A saw on the news that an un-
known lifeform had made contact. Halleluja! Some people may be afraid,
but I'm not. I am glad! But they seam to be so many, floating on the sky.
But the best part is, that the aliens have sent us a message. "PlubZ" it
read; that was what they sad on the new, anyway, so it must be true.
 Damn, how exciting this is!

 That means "Dear Diary" in the PlubZ language, I think!
I'm sorry not for writing as often as I should, but there is just so much
going around! I thought I would be able to write once every weak about
the aliens. Or maby I should say "the alien". PlubZ seams to be made of
thousands minor creatures, but there is only one mind; they are all the
same "person"!   They can't be destroyed either; if You pop one of, an-
other one pops up. The whole sky is filled of'em. It's a pretty nice
sight though... all thoose flashing colours! But I miss the clouds!
 There hasn't been any kulture-exchangement as I had hoped. As the PlubZ
did not respond our calls, a TV-show started; "PlubZ or NOT". I wich I
could take action part of it; ofcource I HAVE sent an aplication, but I
will most probably not be picked up.

 I have been picked up! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!
"PlubZ or NOT"... I am about to be a TV-star!!! All I have to do - in TV
- is to destroy as many PlubZ-parts as possible in front of the whole na-
tion. I'm gona be rich! 
 There was a manual in the letter I got. I have put it right here in my
diary:

 In "PlubZ or NOT", your mission is to destroy as many PlubZ as possible.
If two PlubZ-parts with the same colour lies on the bottom row of the
arena, they will pop off through the nossu-level-magneticfield; they'll
be exterminated!
 With your ojke-board, you can drag a PlubZ-part out of a row, and put it
in in another row. By using your ojke, you have the ability to destroyd
loads of PlubZ-parts in one single move; just put them together by their
colours.
 But as soon as a part has been dragged out, another one will fill the
empty space up... It MAY seam pretty hopeless, but if you make many suc-
cessfull moves, the whole PlubZ will move one step up, and when it rea-
ches the top, it'll be destroyed completely! But if you do to many dumb
moves, the ground will move one step up; it's a tv-show, and there must
be SOMETHING exciting! You loose when your ojke-board pops between the
ground and the PlubZ.

 You controll the ojke with a joy. Place it under a PlubZ-part and press
fire to pick drag it out. Do the same to put it back. By thinking a bit,
you can exterminate MANY PlubZ in a move; and that will ofcource bring
you great bonus-scores! A "wow"-move will actually move PlubZ one step
up at once!
 As soon as the game has started, you'll understand!
