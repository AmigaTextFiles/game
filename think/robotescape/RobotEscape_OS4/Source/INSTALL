On *nix:

  Obtain SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, and SDL_ttf. Type "./build" in this
directory. Do the following as root:

  mkdir /usr/share/games/robot
  cp *.wav *.png *.ttf *.IT /usr/share/games/robot
  cp robot /usr/games
  cp robot.6 /usr/share/man/man6

  You can modify the directories used if you want. "/usr/share/games/" is
referenced in robot.h, so edit that file and rebuild.

On Win32:

  To compile, get MinGW, MSYS, SDL, SDL_mixer, SDL_image, and SDL_ttf. Edit
the build script (file "build") and add the options -liberty and -mwindows
to the last line of it, then run it from MSYS by typing "./build".

  To use the compiled program, just install the required libraries (SDL,
SDL_mixer, SDL_image, and SDL_ttf) and run it.
