@node Freeware
  WB-Pairs is @{b}freeware@{ub}.

    This means everybody is allowed to copy WB-Pairs but it's strictly
  forbidden to manipulate one of the files or to remove a file from the
  package. You are allowed to include your high- and speed-score file.

  You use WB-Pairs on your own risk!

@node Rules
  @{b}Rules@{ub}

  The idea is easy:
  1. You have to find a pair of blocks.
  2. Try (in your mind) to draw a line with 90 degree angles from one
     block to the other.
  3. If this line has zero, one or two angles, both blocks will disappear.

    If there is no block left, you completed the level and a new one is
  created. To have a real challenge the available time is reduces by 5
  seconds every time you have completed a level. You start with 280
  seconds.

    The program detects illegal moves itself and does not accept them.
  With the left mouse button you select a block and with the right one
  you can deselect it. Use <Esc> to return to the main menu.

    The game is paused if you activate a different window. In pause mode
  Pairs needs nearly no cpu time - very multitasking friendly.

  In the menu you can also leave the game by pressing <Esc>.

    Where are they? Hit them, bash them, kick them!!!
  How do you mean "in my program"? - Oh, that kind of bugs! If you really
  should find a bug in WB-Pairs, feel free to send me a report about what
  happend under which circumstances.

    If you email your problem report to me, you will get an anwser within

@node History
  @{b}History:@{ub}

  v1.0  (Dec 1996):
        * First working version


  v1.1  (Mar 1997):
        * First public release

        * included High- & SpeedScore

        * Now with the colorfont I stealt elsewhere (thanks a lot, I think
          it was in a MWB-Icons release)

        * when game is paused, the Playfield will be erased

@node Future
  @{b}For the future@{ub}

    I don't know what much is to do. The mainly different to Pairs (TM;-) is,
  that you can't see the lines between the erased blocks and that you can't
  choose wich mode that you want to play (novice, professional).

    At first I think, like others told me, the connection-line isn't so 'good',
  cause it takes time and you will be a little bit confused by clicking, when
  there are still 4, 6 or maybe 8 blocks out, wich must be erased, hmmm. I
  think that it is a strategic element of the orginal Pairs, maybe I'll do it.

    Cycling between the modes is no problem (next version), but I will distri-
  bute this stuff @{b}today@{ub}.

    Also important is a universal blockset (you can load which @{b}YOU@{ub} want) and
  so I have to implement also a ReMap-Function (datatypes do it for me). But
  there are problems with the CharSet. It must be (nearly) the halve height of
  one Image. Should the User always include a Charset with his Images and
  shall I ignore it, if the Y-Size isn't correct? How I will know, where every
  Char ends; a 'W' will be longer than an 'I'?
@endnode
@node Thanx
  @{b}Special thanks@{ub} goes to:

  · Udo Stark          a friend, programming with me several projects -
                       all are not out, but we learned much and there
                       is a chance that some will be in future out to
                       spread (see other projects)

  · Tobias Lenz        for the Idea of PairsAGA and parts of his guide
                       (if you have an AGA-AMIGA look out for his great
                       Pairs in game/think)

  · Stefan Becker      for the all-one-must-have ToolManager (3.0 is out!!!)

  · Martin Huttenloher for the nice looking MagicWB, a way to have a pro-
                       fessional Look like on Workstations with less then
                       16 colors (hey, NewIcons might be fine, but more then
                       8 colors will slow down non AGAs extremly)

  · all other fine PD-, Shareware-, Prof-Software & Hardware Designer yet
    on AMIGA do their job good; in looking forward...

@node Projects
  I also do other @{b}stuff@{ub}

    I study informatik at the TFH Berlin and I'm in the last Semester, that
  means, that I'll make my such speaken 'Diplom' - the final test of my study.
  Seriosly that means, that I have till not @{b}so much@{ub} time to say: 'You have a
  problem, ok - I'll fix it.'

  Some of my projects:

  * @{i}Minen:@{ui}
      An implementation of Minesweeper for our AMIGA. It's fontsensitive
    and uses GadTolls-Gadgets for the user-interface. Soon on the AmiNET
    it will have HighScore, Savestart (you can't click on a mine at first),
    and a userconfigurable size. Look out...

  * @{i}Risiko:@{ui}
      Still a game, that I love. But, I can't implement the gameplay. Yet you
    have a realy nice GUI (also MWB, but that can be changed via datatype),
    if I'll work on it you also can play to win all the world, but missions
    (42 countries means 2^42 ways to win - every step)? Thats my problem.
    If @{b}YOU@{ub} can help me, write a message what I can do, or I send you my
    sourcecode, that you can improve it, if you can...

  *   there are two big projects, wich I make with @{b}Udo Stark@{ub}:

      @{i}MagicLayout@{ui} is a drafting program like CorelDraw or DrawStudio. It hasn't
    so much features, but it's simular with ArtExpression (not all;-). A nice
    GUI like QuarkXPress makes it simply to use.
    There is just implemented:
    · basic operations: line, ellipse, box, spline (self programmed, faster than
      in the AMIGAMagazin, over 40.000 per second), text (Compugrahic)
    · reference objects (referenced to an object, can have other size, position,
      later angle, but memory depends are very low)
    · scale (0.xx ti over 100000 percent)
    · groups, line style, fill color, fill muster
    Still to do:
    · line width (rp linewidth don't works)
    · rotate (just an matrix to operate)
    · color (not the problem? Just an attribute - but how convert 24bit or
      pantone® to the sreen depth)
    · Printing (how?, a bitmap can be so big; the chipmem is so little!)

    We maked it to finalize our basic-study (the 4th semester).

      @{i}proART@{ui} is a program for owners of little shops to make dealing with
    bikes easier. (you can make it for all thinks possible.)
    There is just implemented:
    · list of users, articles (in your shop, in the world via extern lists),
      firms, byers
    · savety protection for multi-user work
    · my sweatest GUI I evermade
    Still to do:
    · Sale and Bye

    We maked it in our practice-time (the 5th semester)


      Both progs are not finished. But there are copyright by DreamTeam©
    Lot of work goes into it. There is a potential to make it great.
    If Udo and I will end our study (still in that semester) we have to
    think about our future, hey Udo - let's make it.

  * NoName, I tell it @{i}Diplom@{ui}

      You know what I mean - thats my final project now. It's just an image-
    manipulation prog. When I finished it, you will be able to create carri-
    catures automaticly. A picture can be load, it will be digatilized and
    compared with a mainstream picture of a head produced with hundreds of
    heads and than it will be wraped. If you have a greater nouse than
    other - it will become greater, little eyes becomes litteler and so on.
      In this state it's just like many other image processors: you can load
    any picture which datatype you have, it will be automaticly greyscaled
    (sorry, but this is that what I need). After that you can manipulate
    it in several ways like contrast (also automaticly), binarisation
    (with shading), crack-code for image-work (is it a circle, a tool, a
    char or what - a eye!!!), filters intern (gauss [fast, per Pixel 4
    additions, one division!!!], median, sigma, laplace, maximum) and ex-
    tern 3*3 or 5*5 filters. You can now work with it. Every picture is
    in a window, intern 8bit, extern depending of your screen depth, ma-
    nipulating tools have previews, wich can be moved (like PhotoShop) and
    so on. If you are interested...
