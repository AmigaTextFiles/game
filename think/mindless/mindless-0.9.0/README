Mindless:

This is a simple "MasterMind" like game which you can play
in human vs. human, human vs. computer or computer vs. 
computer mode. The goal of the game is to crack a secret code 
consisting of four balls which can each be one of eight colors.
The players takes turn guess (or do it simultaneously) and the 
first one to guess his/her code has won. If both players takes the
same number of turns to get the code correct then both has won.

For your help when guess you will for each (incorrect) answer see a
combination of one or more black tokens and one or more white tokens
on the right side of your last answer. Each black token means that one
of your balls is both of the correct color and location, but you don't 
know which one, and each white token means that one of your balls is of
the correct color but wrong location.

If you like this game and thinks it should be improved somehow, don't 
hesitate to contact me at the adress below. You can also look at the homepage

available.
