Freecell is an implementation for the Amiga of the card game Freecell as
found on various Windows implementations. The basic purpose of the game is
to move cards from those at the bottom to the top right area in four piles
for the four suit starting with the Ace. In order to acheive this you can
make use of the top left area of free cells to put cards into and also
arrange cards on top of each other, as in traditional patience.

The user interface is fairly straight forward, just click on the card to
move and then click on the position it is to be moved to. The screen will
flash if you try to make an illegal move.

This is a beta release, I think the main gameplay is OK but there are still
several things that need sorting out, see the TODO file for a list of
things I intend to get round to.

The program has been written to be as system legal and portable as possible
and has been tested on a combination of machines including 68000/WB1.3 ECS,
68020/WB3.1/AGA, 68040/WB2.0/ECS, 68040/WB3.1/ECS. Please let me know if
you find any problems or even if you like it and don't find a problem via
email to the address below.

Currently this is binary only. I MIGHT release the source code once I've
tidied it up a bit and sorted out some of the more important features. If
anyone is interested it is written in C using SAS 6.51.

The program is Copyright © Adam A. Baker 1996. It may be freely distributed
for non-commercial purposes and may be included in the Fred Fish and Aminet
