                             Hexis V1.0

The object of the game is to fill the wedge shaped rows to let them
dissapear. Use the joystick button to rotate the tiles and left and right to
move them. Press down to let them fall.
The colored bars show you how many tiles of each kind you got.

In versus mode one row will enlage your container by one row. If the
container has already reached full size, your opponents container will shrink.
Two rows will enlarge your container by one row and shrink your opponents
container by one row.
Three rows will enlarge your container by one row and shrink your opponents
container by two rows.
Four rows will accelerate your opponents tiles by one level. If the tiles
have already reached level 10, your container will be enlaged by one row and
your opponents container will be shrinked by three rows.
