                          Introduction
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

I have a boardgame called Mastermind. It's a really nice game 
and I like playing it! The only problem is that it requires a 
buddy :( Wouldn't it be nice if you could play alone... I 
thought. So I converted the game on to my dear Amiga! It's 
certenly not the first Mastermind clone around , but i think 
it's one of the best. Features are nice graphics, 
highscoresave and great gameplay. I hope you enjoy it!

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                          Requirements
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Well, an Amiga I guess :) Harddrive recomended (not tested 
without...)


It has been tested and proven to work on these computers:

Amiga1200 68020/14MHz, 2+4MB Ram, 500MB HD   <- My computer
Amiga1200 68030/50MHz, 2+16MB Ram, 850MB HD
Amiga1200 68020/28MHz, 2+4MB Ram, 120MB HD
Amiga4000 68040/25MHz, 2+16MB Ram, Lotsa HD :)
Amiga2000 68000, NTSC <- Now works on NTSC too!

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                           Installing
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

Just copy the file Mastermind and its icon to whereever you 
like, thats all!

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                            The rules
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

The aim of the game is to figure out the secret code the 
computer has hidden on the top of the screen. The code concists 
of four marbles. Each marble has a colour. You may use the same 
colour many times. Drag a marble using the mouse and place it on
the board. When all four are in place "Hit Me!" is lit up. Press 
it (or space, or second mouse button) and you will see 0-4 small 
marbles on the left of the board. These indicte how well you did 
guess. A black small marble tells you that one of the marbles is 
in the right colour in the right place. A white marble means that 
you have a marble that is in the right colour, but in the wrong 
place! The position of the small marbles has got nothing to do 
with the position of the coloured marbles. By studing the small 
marbles you can draw conclusions about the secret code, and 
finally solve it. You have ten tries. If you solve the code you 
will be asked to enter you name, and then the highscore table is 
displayed. There you will see the top five results. The time 
spent on solving teh puzzle is what the highscore is built on, 
but you can also see how many tries you had! If you would like to 
see the highscore table without solving the puzzle, then click on 
"About" (or press the help-key).

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                       NTSC users read this!
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

The game was designed for PAL Amigas. After getting some complains
from NTSC user I reprogrammed the game to work on NTSC Amigas too!
If you have an NTSC Amiga, then you may scroll the screen up and
down usign the mouse or the arrow keys. This is not a perfect
NTSC fix, but it works! I appologise to all NTSC users: SORRY!
I myself have a PAL Amiga, and can thus not fully test NTSC modes.

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
              Is this a comercial software or what?
