This drawer contains only the main modules of ishid-o-matic.  They use some
other  modules,  like  a  support-module  for the medplayer.library and for
ILBM-pictures.
If  you  want  them,  you can send me a self-addressed stamped envelope, an
empty  disk,  and a letter to tell me which modules you want, and I'll copy
them on your disk and send them back to you.

My address: Robert Brandner
