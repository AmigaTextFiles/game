@totaloutro_begin			; @worlds - finished orig. levels
Congratulations !!!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A great deal of intelligence, logic,
and patience is needed to finish
all the original Pacomix2 levels.

You have just done it !!!

You have proven that no logical
problem is tricky enough
to threaten you.

There are not many people like you
out there.
Your name will come into history
some day !!!

@begin

Pacomix2 - Ultimate logical game. You have to collect all items to get to the
next level ...


Control:
~~~~~~~~
In menu: enter, right arrow, joy right = choose an item / next page
	 esc = escape
	 left arrow, joy left = next page / esc
	 joy/arrows up/down, F-keys = direct choose item

In game: arrows/joy - moving
	 F3/L - load position
	 F4/I/Help - this info
	 F5/S - save the current position
	 F6/C - choose another world
	 R/JoyButton - retry
	 M - music on/off
	 Esc/(JoyLeft+Button) - esc
	 NumPlus/NumMinus - browse already finished levels

Editing names:
	 Backspace - delete the last characters
	 Del - delete the whole name
	 Esc, left arrow - esc
@next
Toolstypes (for game & editor icons):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Game icon:   LANGUAGE = <name_of_locale_file>
	     NOINTRO - skip game intro (switch)
	     DBLPAL  - run inDBLPAL mode (switch)
 
Editor icon: DBLPAL  - run in DBLPAL mode (switch)


Editor control:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is possible to create your own, custom, levels. You can enter them via
the F2 key in main menu. When you are in the editor, press the Help key
to see a detailed editor control guide, and the Tab key to get more info
on levels and the creation.


Level sharing & future plans:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you think that your custom levels are good to be shared with other
users, upload them to the Aminet into game/data directory or to the
ftp://norek.skm.vutbr.cz into the /incoming directory. Name the file
p2_*.lha with a description "Pacomix2 levels by **". * and ** are
specifiers.

If we get enough quality levels, Artie has promised to create some new
graphics for Pacomix2 Special Edition. If you like Pacomix2, make up
new levels and there will be a sequel to the game.
