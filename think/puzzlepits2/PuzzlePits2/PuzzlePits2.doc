    The program PuzzlePits 2, all supporting files, and these instructions
    are Copyright 1992 Abe Pralle, All Rights Reserved.  Version 1.2 is
    complete and freely distributable, but it is shareware.  If you like it,
    please send the author a small fee ($5) as described in the
    "Registering" section on line 625.


----Quick Start (for experienced game players)----------------------------

    Click on GAME after startup.
    Click LEFT mouse button to walk single step.
    Click RIGHT mouse button to walk automatically to the destination.
    Move barrels and boxes by pushing against them for a few moments.
    Push barrels over all blue floor tiles to complete the level.

    You will need to copy the following files to your own directories:

    Files needed in LIBS:  (found in PuzzlePits2/LIBS/)
        Amos.library
        Diskfont.library

    Files needed in FONTS:  (found in PuzzlePits2/FONTS/)
        PPits2.font
        PPits2  (directory and contents)

----Hardware Requirements-------------------------------------------------

    PuzzlePits 2 should run on any Amiga.  It has been tested on a 512k
    A500 (v1.3) and a stock A1200.  However, to run on a 512k machine you
    will need to deactivate any external drives, and there will be no sound
    and not as much character animation.  1 Meg of ram is recommended.

    Ensure that the contents of your LIBS: and FONTS: directories contain
    all the files from the LIBS and FONTS directories of PuzzlePits2.

    To start the game double-click on the program icon or set the current
    directory to the PuzzlePits2 directory from the CLI and type
    PuzzlePits2.


----Startup---------------------------------------------------------------

    When the game loads you will see the TITLE SCREEN shorty followed by
    the MAIN SCREEN.  Here you can do five things:

    * CHANGE THE CURRENT LEVEL by clicking on the current level text shown
      at the bottom of the screen or typing "n" (for name).  You will first
      be asked to choose the series name.  Since version 1.2 only comes with
      the series "Pit", that will be the only series you can initially use.
      Next select the level number, which can range from 0 to 99 (though the
      game comes with only levels 1 to 30).

    * VIEW THE INTRODUCTION by clicking on "INTRO" or typing "i".
      This is a background story with pictures.  Computer Gaming World
      thought it was contrived, and it is in a way, but I like it.

    * PLAY THE GAME by clicking on "GAME" or typing "g".  You will begin
      on the CURRENT LEVEL.


    * EDIT LEVELS by clicking on "EDIT" or typing "e".  You will be
      presented with the editor screen, and the editor will attempt
      to load the CURRENT LEVEL.  The edited level will be blank if the
      CURRENT LEVEL does not exist.

    * QUIT the game by clicking on the STOP SIGN or by typing "q".


----Control Setup---------------------------------------------------------

    During the main game you may either use the mouse or the keyboard.
    Mouse controls are explained first, followed by keyboard controls.

    WALKING
    -------
    When using the mouse, move the pointer around the guy onscreen until
    the arrow points in the direction you wish him to move.  Then press the
    left mouse button.

    PATHFINDING
    -----------
    Right-click over a terrain tile, and the guy will try to walk there
    automatically avoiding obstacles.

    WAITING
    -------
    If the pointer is shaped like a dot, and thus directly over the guy,
    pressing the left mouse button will cause you to wait where you are for
    a turn.

    PICKING UP AND USING ITEMS
    --------------------------
    If you move over an item such as a gem or a key you will automatically
    pick it up, and it will appear on the sidebar on the right side of the
    screen.  Then you may left click on the item to use it. Click on it
    again to stop using it (if necessary).  Each item's correct use is up
    to you to determine.

    MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS
    ----------------------
    The three icons at the top of the game screen do the following:
      EYE       - Lets you scan the play area without physically moving
                  the guy.  Click on the icon again to stop scanning.
                  Note:  You cannot move the eye symbol over empty space.

      "RESTART" - Lets you reset the level whenever you screw up.

      "STOP"    - Quits the level completely and returns you to the main
                  screen.

    KEYBOARD EQUIVALENTS
    --------------------
    The keyboard equivalents are as follows:

    ARROW KEYS      -       Move the guy around.
    RETURN          -       Wait a turn, exit from a text message.
    NUMERIC KEYPAD -        Activates items (keys are arranged as follows)
                 ( = Look        ) = Restart    / = Quit
                                                9 = Use Yellow Gem
                 4 = Use Red Gem 5 = Green Gem  6 = Blue Gem
                 1 = Use Red Key 2 = Green Key  3 = Blue Key

    In addition, the 's' key may be used to turn the sound off and on, and
    the 'm' key may be used to turn the music on and off.

    When the game first starts the 'i' key takes you to the intro, g =
    game, e = edit, n = name change (level path + name), and q = quit
    program.

----How to Play-----------------------------------------------------------

    First of all, a basic description of the different things in the game
    is in order.

    FLOOR - Grey octagons.  You stand on them.
    FLOOR PLATES - Octagons outlined in blue.  If these exist on a level,
      you must push a barrel over each one to finish the level.
    SWITCHES - These are square plates on the floor activated by pressure.
      Among other things, they can cause items and walls to appear and
      disappear.
    LOCKED SWITCHES - Switches that are outlined in the color of the key
      needed to unlock them.
    WATER - Impassable.
    ARROWS - These are drawn on the floor, and they move any inanimate
      object that is resting on them in the direction that they point.
    GEMS - Red, green, blue, and yellow - you automatically pick these up,
      and you can use them to do different things.
    KEYS - After picking them up, you can unlock LOCKED SWITCHES with them.
    BARRELS - Normally brown, they turn blue when they're over a FLOOR
      PLATE.
    BOXES - Square and pushable, they do not count towards solving the
      level if they are pushed over a FLOOR PLATE.  But they have other
      uses...
    WALLS - Thick and impenetrable.
    SIGNS - Walls with writing on them. Bump into them to see what they say.
    PILLARS - Just a fancy wall.

    GOAL OF EACH LEVEL AND PLAY MECHANICS
    -------------------------------------
    For the first twenty levels, your main concern will be pushing a barrel
    over every floor plate.  You can only push; you cannot pull except by
    using gems that you may find.  You can only push a barrel or a box, and
    only then if the space where you are pushing it to is empty.

    To unlock a LOCKED SWITCH, obtain a key of the appropriate color, stand
    over the switch, and use the key by clicking on it.  The key will then
    be removed from your possession.

    The four colors of magic gems do different things.  It is up to you to
    discover exactly when and how to use them!

    COMPLETING A LEVEL
    ------------------
    When you complete a level you will be given the time it took you.
    Occasionally you will receive a password that will allow you to edit the
    level.  Most levels do not require a password to edit.


----The Level Editor------------------------------------------------------

    THE SETUP
    ---------
    Each level can be up to 21 by 21 squares wide.  Each square can have
    something on the bottom (floor) and something on the top (like walls or
    barrels).  You can only see part of the level you are editing at any one
    time.  The green rectangle at the top left of the sidebar shows your
    viewing window relative to the whole level.  You can change the area you
    are viewing by dragging the green rectangle around.

    In the upper right of the sidebar are six buttons.  The arrows move or
    translate the level from side to side and up and down, with wraparound.
    Your actual view is not changing - the level itself is.  CLEAR ALL and
    CLEAR TOP are two different ways of clearing the level.

    There are four buttons marked LOAD, SAVE, DELete, and QUIT.  The first
    three use the current path and name of the level (shown at the bottom of
    the screen).  Don't load "levels/Pit12", change the name to
    "levels/Pit14", and expect Pit12 to be deleted from disk when you click
    on DEL.  QUIT exits from the level editor to the main menu.  It does not
    automatically save the level upon exiting.  If you click on SAVE a
    requestor will appear, asking you to create the password for your level.
    A person who does not know the password will not be able to edit the
    level.  The password for a level is given to you when you complete the
    level.  You do not have to create a password; if you do not wish to,
    just press return at the requestor.  This feature is only to preserve
    the challenge of a level.

    At the bottom of the screen are two lines of text.  The first is the
    name of the level, as it appears on disk.  The default level name is
    "levels/Pit", but you can start your own series of levels using whatever
    name you wish.  To change the level that you are editing, click on the
    current level name.  First you will be given a chance to change the
    series and then you can change the level number.

    The lower line of text is the title of the level.  This usually has no
    significance in the game.  It can be used to give a general idea of what
    the level is about (i.e. Starting Out, Warehouse) or give a hint on how
    to solve it.  Click on the title to edit it.

    EDITING
    -------
    On the lower right hand side of the screen is a group of tiles that
    you will use to make your levels.  Left click on a tile to select it for
    drawing.  With the ARROWS, GEMS, KEYS, and PLATES you can get different
    directions or colors by multiple clicks.  Left-clicking on the main
    editor screen will set your selected tile in that position.
    Right-clicking will erase whatever tile is below the pointer.  There are
    a few limitations dictated by the rules of the game.  For instance, you
    cannot place a barrel over thin air.  There are two levels of objects in
    PuzzlePits 2.  The lower level includes everything you stand on,
    including gems.  The upper level includes walls, pillars, barrels,
    boxes, and the guy.  Placing an upper level piece over a lower level
    piece will not erase the lower level piece. For example, draw a row of
    gems.  Now draw a wall piece over each one.  If you then right-click to
    delete a wall, the gem will be revealed underneath it.

    Without going into programmable switches, there is only one way to solve
    each level.  That is to push a barrel over each pressure plate.  You
    don't need to do anything special in the editor to allow the level to be
    solved in this fashion; just create as many barrels as there are blue
    pressure plates.

    SWITCHES
    --------
    There are plenty of design options given by just the basic stuff,
    as shown in the first twenty levels.  But sometimes you may wish for
    something more.  This is where the programmable SWITCHES come in.  A
    special programming language is part of PuzzlePits 2.

    The best way to learn how to program your own switches is to look at
    at the code for the switches in the premade levels.  To get into the
    switch editing mode, right-click on the drawing tiles.  Then left click
    on the editing screen to edit or create a switch, or right click to
    delete an existing switch.

    When editing a switch program, put all program statements one after
    another, separated by a colon (:).  Press return when finished.
    Pressing F10 will restore the code for the last switch that was edited.
    Say you enter the following line:

     TEXT{Hello.}

    When you left click on the switch location again, you will see a blank
    screen because you forgot to put a pound sign in.  Simply press F10 to
    get "TEXT{Hello.}" back and insert the pound sign.

    Every command in this language ends with a pound sign (#).  Different
    commands are separated with colons.  There are thirty six different
    registers, RA to RZ and R0 to R9, that are available to be used during
    programming.  An overview/summary of commands is below, followed by more
    detailed explanations.

    COMMAND SUMMARY
    ---------------
    I, X1, X2, Y1 and Y2 can be any number from 0 to 200 or a register.
    Rx can be any register.

    ON#               - Commands following this are only performed when the
                        switch is activated (weight applied).
    OFF#              - Commands following this are only performed when the
                        switch is deactivated (weight removed).
    MAP#X1,Y1,I       - Changes the level at position (X1,Y1) to tile I.
                        Multiple changes can be separated with semicolons.
    APPEAR#X1,Y1,I    - Same as MAP#, except changes "dissolve" in.
    TPORT#X1,Y1=X2,Y2 - (Teleport) Swaps anything above ground (barrels,
                         guy) at (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2)
    LET#Rx=X1         - Assigns a value to a register.
    ADD#Rx,X1         - Adds a number or register to register Rx.
    SUB#Rx,X1         - Subtracts a number or register from register Rx.
                        Since only positive numbers from 0 to 200 can be
                        entered, this is necessary for subtraction.
    TEXT#{message}    - Displays the message inside curly brackets.
    INPUT#{message}   - Displays message then gets player input.
    IF#X1[<,>,=,!]X2  - Proceeds with program only if comparison is true.
    IF$#{answer}      - Compares the text from INPUT# to text inside curly
                        brackets, and proceeds with program only if they
                        are equal.
    ELSE#             - When an IF comparison is not true then the program
                        will jump to the code after the ELSE#, if there IS
                        an ELSE#.
    ENDIF#            - There must be one of these for each IF# and IF$# -
                        if the IF is not true and there is no ELSE, the
                        program jumps to the command after the ENDIF#.
    SHAVE#X1          - This reduces the last input text to a maximum length
                        of X1.
    SILENT#           - Prevents the switch from making the usual sound when
                        it is activated.
    END#              - Ends the level.
    POP#              - Prevents the rest of the switch program from being
                        evaluated and exits the switch program.
    PIC#{picture}     - Displays a 32 color IFF picture.

    Some of the registers have special uses.  These are:

    R0  - Holds X position of guy (1 - 21).
    R1  - Holds Y position of guy (1 - 21).
    R2  - Amount of Red Gems you have.
    R3  - # of Green Gems.
    R4  - # of Blue Gems.
    R5  - # of Yellow Gems.
    R6  - # of Red Keys.
    R7  - # of Green Keys.
    R8  - # of Blue Keys.
    R9  - Numeric value of last INPUT#{}.

    RO  - The number of the tile that is above ground (over) at (RX,RY).
    RU  - The tile that is at ground level (under) at (RX,RY).
    RX  - The X (horizontal) position of the switch each time the program
          is run.  RX may be changed within the program to give a different
          RO & RU for the duration of the program.
    RY  - Same as RX, but in the vertical.



    Now for the detailed descriptions:

    NOTE:  Only the SWITCH and SIGN tiles will cause the program to check
           for and run a switch program.  If you program a switch over a
           regular floor tile, nothing will happen when you walk over it.
           However, the switch program still exists at that location.  If
           another switch changes the floor at that location to become
           a switch, the program will become active.

    ON#
        If you want a switch to do a certain thing only when it is
    activated, put ON# in front of that part of the program.  The program
    will run until it finds another ON# or OFF#.  If there is no ON#, then
    the program will start at the beginning when the switch is activated.
    You do not need an ON# or an OFF# in the program for a sign (the wall
    with writing on it).  Only the first ON# in a program will be evaluated.

    Example:  ON#:ADD#R2,1     - When the switch is activated it gives you
              one more red gem.  It does nothing when deactivated.

              ADD#R7,1:OFF#:SUB#R8,1     - When the switch is activated
              you get another green key (because there is no on#, the
              program is executed from the beginning).  When it is
              deactivated, you lose a blue key.

    OFF#
        The opposite of ON#.

    Example:  ON#:MAP#5,5,199:OFF#:MAP#5,5,100      - When activated,
              the floor at location 5,5 is erased.  When deactivated,
              a regular FLOOR tile is put at location 5,5.

    MAP#X1,Y1,I
    MAP#X1,Y1,I1;X2,Y2,I2;X3,Y3,I3
    APPEAR#X1,Y1,I

        These two commands both have the same effect, though APPEAR# is
    more visually interesting.  The end result for both is to change the
    level at location X1,Y1 to tile I.  The table of tiles is listed below.
    The UNDER tiles only replace the ground level things, and the OVER tiles
    only replace the above ground things.  You can separate multiple
    change locations/values with semicolons.
        There is a shortcut you can use rather than messing with all of the
    numbers.  When you are editing a switch program, type MAP#* or APPEAR#*
    and continue with editing.  When you press return you will be able
    to draw in all of the changes for that command.  This is also handy for
    finding out the number of a tile without having to resort to the
    following table.

        TABLE OF TILES
        --------------
        *misc*

        0...............Clears everything at X1,Y1
        99..............Clears the OVER portion of X1,Y1 (walls, barrels)
        199.............Clears only the ground at X1,Y1 (floor,keys,gems)

        *UNDER*

        100.............Regular floor
        102 - 105.......Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow gems
        106 - 108.......Red, Green, and Blue keys
        109 - 112.......Up, Right, Down, and Left conveyer arrows
        113.............Box in water
        114.............Blue pressure plate
        115.............Regular switch
        116 - 118.......Red, Green, and Blue locked switches
        119.............Water

        *OVER*

        1...............Regular wall
        2...............Sign wall
        10..............Pillar
        50..............Box
        51..............Blue barrel
        52..............Regular barrel
        53..............Barrel in water
        150.............The Guy (Kevin).  Use this value only for
                        comparison; you cannot change a location to this
                        value.

        Examples:
                        MAP#5,3,50      - Puts a box at location (5,3)
                        ON#:APPEAR#*:OFF#:APPEAR#*      - Allows you to
                            edit what changes will be made when you step
                            on the switch and when you step off it.

        NOTE:   If you are using the * command (MAP#*), only the unique
                changes will be remembered.  Thus if you want a barrel to
                be placed at (5,5) then you should make sure that there is
                not one there before you edit the switch program.

    TPORT#X1,Y1=X2,Y2
    (Teleport)
            This swaps the above-ground objects at locations X1,Y1 and
    X2,Y2.

    Examples:   TPORT#R0,R1=5,5     - Teleports the guy to (5,5).  If there
               was anything at (5,5), it is moved to the guy's old location.

                MAP#3,3,99:TPORT#RX,RY=3,3      - This is a one way
               teleport.  First anything above ground at (3,3) is cleared,
               and then whatever was on the switch that activated the
               program is teleported to (3,3).

    LET#Rx=X1

        This assigns a register a value.  When you start or restart a level,
    the registers are cleared except R0-R9 and RO-RZ, so you don't need to
    initialize any of the RA-RN registers to zero.  Don't assign any values
    to RO or RU, since these registers may change from moment to moment.

    Examples:   LET#R2=3    - Gives you 3 red gems, regardless of how many
               you had before.
                LET#RA=5:LET#RB=6:TPORT#R0,R1=RA,RB     - Teleports the guy
               to location (5,6)
                LET#RX=1:LET#RY=1   - RO and RU now hold values of the tiles
               at location (1,1)


    ADD#Rx,X1

        This adds a number or a register to a register.
    NOTE:  No numbers greater than 200 or less than 0 can be used by the
    program.

    Examples:   LET#RA=2:ADD#R3,RA      - This gives you two more green
               gems.  However, a simpler method would be to ADD#R3,2.

    SUB#Rx,X1

        The reverse of ADD#, this subtracts the number or register X1 from
    register Rx.

    TEXT#{MESSAGE}

        This prints out the text between the two curly brackets.
    NOTE:  You can embed "&Rx" to print out the contents of any register.
           You can also cause a carriage return to be printed by placing
           an "at" sign (@) within the message.

    Examples:   TEXT#{The ghost said "Boo!"}
                TEXT#{The location of the guy is&R0,&R1.}
                TEXT#{first line@second line}

    INPUT#{MESSAGE}

        This prints a message and waits for user input.  The input is stored
    both as a string for use with the IF$ command and as a number in R9.

    Examples:   INPUT#{Teleport where horizontally(1-21)?}:LET#RA=R9:
                 INPUT#{Teleport where vertically(1-21)?}:TPORT#R0,R1=RA,R9

                INPUT#{What is the answer?}

    IF#X1{<,>,=,!}X2

        Compares X1 with X2.  If the result is true then the program
    proceeds.  If it is false the program skips to an ELSE# or and ENDIF#,
    whichever comes first.  Only one comparison sign is allowed.  If you
    wish to check if X1 is not equal to X2, use a exclamation point (!) for
    the comparison operator.  You do not have to have an ELSE#, but you do
    need an ENDIF#.

    Examples:   INPUT#{What is 3+4?}:IF#R9=7:TEXT#{Right!}:ELSE#:
                TEXT#{Wrong!}:ENDIF#

                INPUT#{What ISN'T 3+4?}:IF#R9!7:TEXT#{Right!}:ELSE#:
                TEXT#{Wrong!}:ENDIF#

    IF$#{ANSWER}

        Behaves just like the regular IF#, except that the comparison is
    done between the last string to be input and ANSWER.  It uses regular
    ELSE# and ENDIF# statements.  Use upper case letters for the comparison,
    since all player input is converted into upper case.

    Examples:   INPUT#{What sat down beside Little Miss Muffet?}:
                IF$#{SPIDER}:TEXT#{Right!}:ELSE#:TEXT#{Wrong!}:ENDIF#

    SHAVE#X1

        This reduces the last text string input to a length of X1.  This
    is useful for getting rid of suffixes.

    Examples:   INPUT#{What comes after daytime?}:SHAVE#5:IF$#{NIGHT}:
                TEXT#{Right!}:ENDIF#    - the player will get the answer
                                        right whether he enters NIGHT or
                                        NIGHTTIME

    SILENT#

        This prevents a switch from making the usual sound.  It comes in
    handy when you don't want the player to know that a switch is being
    activated offscreen.

    END#

        Ends the level, even if barrels aren't covering all of the pressure
    plates.

    Examples:   INPUT#{Quit the level?}:SHAVE#1:IF$#{Y}:END#:ENDIF#

    POP#

        This exits from the switch program without evaluating the rest
    of it.

    Examples:   INPUT#{Quit the level?}:SHAVE#1:IF$#{N}:POP#:ENDIF#:END#
                - This is an alternate way to do the example listed for
                  END#

    PIC#{NAME}

        This displays a 32 color IFF picture.  Its name and path should
    be included in the curly brackets.

    Examples:   PIC#{iff/win.iff}
                PIC#{PuzzlePits2:PuzzlePits2/iff/win.iff}


----Miscellaneous---------------------------------------------------------

    By default, the current level is set to "levels/Pit" when you load the
    game.  You can change this by changing the current level (by clicking on
    it) and then hitting the "w" key (write) to save the new default level.
    For example, you could have the default levels directory be
    "games:mylevels/MyPits".

    In this version you are limited to 100 switch programs and about
    10k of storage space.  This should be enough for all but the largest
    projects.  If you're editing a switch and the program suddenly quits on
    you, it has probably run out of memory.  I doubt this will ever happen.

    Any gems or keys that you have left when a level ends will be carried
    with you to the next level.  When you reset a level, the number of gems
    and keys that you started the level with will be restored, so do not be
    afraid to experiment.  If you STOP the game, and then restart, the
    number of keys and gems will be reset to zero.

    I have attempted to avoid puzzles which have a solution that is only
    obvious to me.  Every level included is solvable, with a little patience
    and ingenuity.  Don't discount the level names as sources of clues,
    either.

    You shouldn't have to worry about the game crashing if you edit a switch
    program incorrectly.  If there is an error, the worst that will happen
    is that the program for that switch will be blank.  I recommend that you
    make a habit of clicking on a switch again after you just edited it.
    If the program that appears isn't complete, just press F10 and find your
    error.


----Registering------------------------------------------------------------

    I wrote this game on my own time.  It involved a lot of work.  I would
    like to continue to support the shareware concept by programming more
    cool games.  I can only do that with your support.

    If you like this game, please register with me by sending me $5 U.S.
    equivalent, your name, and your address (including your email address if
    you have one).  And if you don't pay, please don't play.

    There's a whole lot of levels that can be made with the editor, and I'd
    like to see people making them.  I hereby give my permission for any
    level created with the PuzzlePits 2 level editor to be distributed
    however the creator of the level sees fit.  To aid in this process you
    can send your levels to me via USPS or uuencoded mail and I will
    periodically post a new archive file (containing nothing but levels) to
    the Aminet.

    The below address should be good for several years to come, except for
    the email address which will probably expire at the beginning of May,
    1995 (hopefully I'll make a new one known).  I will be happy to answer
    any questions or take a look at any problems - provided you've
    registered, of course.

    Thanks for reading this, and enjoy the game!

----Author's Note (unessential reading, contains some rambling)------------

    Some of you may be wondering about the "2" part of PuzzlePits 2.  It
    sounds a lot like a sequel; perhaps to PuzzlePits?  But you say you
    never heard of plain PuzzlePits?  It is a slightly odd situation, but
    allow me to explain.

    In the fall of '91 and the spring of '92 I wrote the game called
    PuzzlePits.  It was similar to this game, but it wasn't as nice looking
    and it didn't have the switches or the programming language.  Then, in
    the summer of '92, I sent off a demo of it to a couple of public domain
    distributors.  While I was waiting to hear something about it, my master
    program disk went bad - the program along with it.  I was dismayed and
    really really pi- well, I was dismayed to discover that my backup on the
    same disk was unreadable, and the only other backup I had was ancient.
    Suddenly my fantasies of lots of people sending me money was twisted
    into a hideous nightmare.  What followed then has to be one of the most
    intense, most stressful programming sessions anyone has ever undertaken.
    In under 7 days I created and completed this program, PuzzlePits 2,
    almost from scratch (I salvaged some of the old graphics).  While I was
    at it, I added many different features and rethought the layout of the
    screen.

    As it turns out, I needn't have hurried.  I still haven't heard anything
    about the original PuzzlePits demo I sent out, and I truly believe that
    for some reason it was never distributed to anyone.  But just in case
    there is a demo floating around out there, I named this game "2" so that
    people would know that it's better than the game shown in the demo.

    Well, almost exactly 1 year ago the November, 1993 issue of Computer
    Gaming World came out, along with a mostly favorable review of
    PuzzlePits 2.  Shortly thereafter I uploaded a one level demo of the
    game to Aminet.  "Well great," I thought with naieve idealism, "Payback
    time!"

    In one year I have made exactly $0.00 from sales.  Why the low figure?
    I attribute it mainly to lack of publicity.  Looking back, I should
    have sent the demo to every major PD distributer around.  I could still
    do that, of course, but I am rapidly approaching a major turning point
    in my life (college graduation), and I won't have the time to actively
    support (ie copy disks) and promote this game.  That is why I am
    releasing this freely distributed, uncrippled version.  Still, if
    there's enough favorable response I will certainly consider creating
    "PuzzlePits 3" or something similar.

    Well, I hope this go-round will show that the Amiga shareware market
    is worthwhile.  Pleasant gaming.
