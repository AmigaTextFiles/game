The Counter                               Copyright 1995 by Peter Händel

The Counter is a Freeware game. It may be freely copied as no money is
charged for it. Modification of the program, of the accompanying text or
the icons is forbidden. The author keeps the full copyright. Commercial
usage (e. g. on a cover disc etc.) only if permitted by the author. The
author cannot be made responsible for noncorrect work with certain
computer configurations or damage caused by using this software. The
allowed selling price raised by German PD-distributors is up to 5 DM per
disc. This includes that the sold disc must be filled nearly up to 100 per
cent. 4 or 5 DM for a 30 per cent filled disc containing this game is
really an extortionate price and should not be supported. There are enough
reliable PD-distributors with fair pricing. The buyer should realize that
the 5 DM per disc normally go to the distributor - the author of the
program does not see any money.

The game
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea behind Counter is to remove all numeric blocks from the field by
clicking them with the mouse. There is no limit in time or number of
tries. Having started Counter you enter the title screen. On the left you
might see saved games and on the right we have the highscore. In order to
start a new game select an entry on the left with the left mouse button.
You may enter a name by moving the mouse to the left and to the right.
When the first letter is chosen hit the left button again to proceed with
the second letter. Another click on the left button starts the game.
Whenever you quit the game or finish a level the current score and level
are saved automatically (make sure to unprotect the disc). When you want
to load a saved game select the particular entry in the title screen with
the right mouse button. You can then continue to play the level which you
were at when you left the game last.

The rules are quite simple. The first block marks the beginning position
and is of yellow colour. Supposing it shows a 5 you can move 5 steps and
select the next block. Each time you select a block the previous one
disappears and your score is increased. Note that there cannot be stones
between the two blocks and only 90 degree turns are possible. When you
have removed all blocks from the field the next level will be loaded. In
case you make a mistake so that some of the blocks cannot be removed any
more the level must be restarted ("New"). In order to show you if a move
is possible a small LED is installed in the bottom right corner. If you
move the mousecursor over a block which can be removed the LED shows green
light (i. e. the move is o.k.). If the block cannot be removed the LED is
red.

In addition to the normal numeric blocks there are two variations. First,
a block showing a question mark. The number of the block will be shown to
you just when you jump to this block. Second, a star represents a joker.
When you select this block the player may move to any block he/she likes.

The editor
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Counter comes along with an editor which allows you to create your own
levels. It is possible to create additional levels or to overwrite
existing ones with others. The number of levels is limited to 200. As the
game already comes with 100 levels (1-100) the user should use the levels
101 to 200 for own stages. The usage of the editor is very simple. Select
the levelnumber by clicking the +/- gadgets with the left mouse button. A
click with the right button increases/decreases the levelnumber by 10.
"Load" reads the selected level from the disc. "Save" writes the level to
the disc. "Clear" clears the whole playfield which is necessary for the
creation of a new level. Afterwards click on the playfield with the left
button to place new blocks. When you place the second block the first one
will be automatically given the correct number. If the distance is
10 steps or more the previous block will be given a star. That means that
the player may jump as far as he/she wants. Such fields should not be used
in large amounts because they would make the level very easy. By the way,
you always have to place one additional block (at the tail) as the last
block in the game will not be used as a jump. When you have created a
trail you can still add special blocks. Select these by clicking on them
with the left mouse button and place them on the playfield by clicking
with the right button. The star and the question mark can only be put on
numeric blocks. The stone can only be put in places where it would not
interrupt the numeric trail.
