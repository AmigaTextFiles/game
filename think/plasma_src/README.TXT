This is the source code for Plasma Bubble.  It was
written using GFA Basic, and compiled with the GFA
Basic compiler.  I do not have the compile options
file available, although it could be recreated with
care.

GFA Basic is a commercial program, and you would need
a new version of it to recompile Plasma Bubble for a new
platform or processor. GFA still exist and make a version 
of this Basic for Windows, you can find out about it at:

The Plasma Bubble home page is at:

You can find Plasma Bubble in runnable binary form on
Aminet in the game/think/ directory.
