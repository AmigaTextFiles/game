@Node "About the playing routine"

   The computer player is based on a algorithm made by
   @{" Magnus " Link "Magnus" } Enarsson (me). The routine is very optimized to
   be fast, but it doesn't play that well. I have some ideas
   of how to make it very hard to beat but I keep them to
   further releases (if any). Still Luffar is good enough
   to entertain most people.
   Mail me and let me know what YOU think.

@Node "Requirements and Installation"

   You must have version 2.04 or better of the Amiga operating
   system to run Luffar 2.0. If you try anyway you will be told
   once more. Luffar 1.0 on Fred Fish disk #863 will run with
   older versions of the operating system. But keep in mind
   that Luffar 2.0 is more than twice as good. :-)

   To install Luffar on a hard disk drive, just drag the icon.
   It's all there in one file.
   If you want to start Luffar 2.0 from CLI it will work just
   fine but you lose the power of @{" tooltypes " Link "Luffar ToolTypes" } and will be running
   with the defaults.

   If you open Luffar on a hires/interlaced screen it will rescale
   so it remains square. To override that set the tooltype
   @{ " INTERLACE_SCALE " Link "INTERLACE_SCALE" } to 'FALSE'.

@Node "The game of noughts and crosses"

   Noughts and crosses is easy to learn and the rules are
   simple, but it is still hard to become a good player.

   There are two players where one has the x-symbol and the
   other has the o-symbol. The players place their symbols
   every other time in a empty box. The board contains 15*15
   boxes and the x-symbol will always begin in the middle box.
   To win you must place five of your symbols in an unbroken
   row vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

   There are two special rules that are optional:

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Only win on five (Default).
   This rule means that the winning line should be exactly
   five of one kind.
   Six in a row counts as nothing.

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Russian opening (Default)
   This is a rule to decrease the benefit of beginning.
   It means that the second cross must have two boxes
   between itself and the beginning cross in the middle.

   These two options can be set in the @{" settings menu " Link "Settings menu" }.

   The name Luffar origins from the Swedish name "Luffarschack" which 
   means "Chess for the vagabonds".

@Node "Project menu"

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} About...
   Brings up a requester that tells about me and the program.
   The Luffar window will sleep when the About window is open.
   No action can be done until the About window is gone.

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Quit
   Shortcut: <Right Amiga> Q
   Quits the program without asking.
   You can also use the close gadget in the upper left
   corner of the @{" Luffar window " Link "Luffar Window" }.

@EndNode



@Node "Settings menu"

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Auto restart
   Shortcut: <Right Amiga> R. Default checked.
   Toggles the auto restart option.
   If checked you can restart the game by clicking in the @{" board " Link "Board" }
   when the game is over.
   The computer player isn't affected other than in one player
   mode when the computer player will toggle to play the other
   symbols. Just try it and you will understand (@{" Martin Rebas " Link "Martin Rebas" } didn't).

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Russian opening
   Shortcut: <Right Amiga> O. Default checked.
   If checked the computer will play with russian opening.
   You may still play with or without russian opening.
   Russian opening is a rule to decrease the benefit of beginning.
   It means that the second cross must have two boxes
   between itself and the first cross in the middle.
   If you don't understand this, just observe the computer playing.

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Only win on five
   Shortcut: <Right Amiga> F. Default checked.
   If checked only five in a row will be counted as a winning row.
   Six in a row will be ignored.
   Luffar will restart the game when selected to avoid forbidden
   states.

   The defaults can be changed with @{" Luffar ToolTypes " Link "Luffar ToolTypes" }.

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Jag har så mycket nyckelpigor i fickan att jag knappt kan bärga mig!
 - @{" Martin Rebas " Link "Martin Rebas" }

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Einstein argued that there must be simplified explanations of nature,
   because God is not capricious or arbitrary. No such faith comforts
   the software engineer.
 - Fred Brooks, Jr.

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} I believe that part of what propels science is the thirst for wonder. 
   It's a very powerful emotion. All children feel it. In a first grade
   classroom everybody feels it; in a twelfth grade classroom almost
   nobody feels it, or at least acknowledges it. Something happens
   between first and twelfth grade, and it's not just puberty. Not only
   do the schools and the media not teach much skepticism, there is also
   little encouragement of this stirring sense of wonder. Science and
   pseudoscience both arouse that feeling. Poor popularizations of science
   establish an ecological niche for pseudoscience.
 - Carl Sagan, The Burden Of Skepticism, The Skeptical Inquirer, Vol. 12,
   Fall 1987

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} This planet has -- or rather had -- a problem, which was this: most of
   the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many
   solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were
   largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper,
   which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of
   paper that were unhappy.

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} You can observe a lot just by watching.
 - Yogi Berra (sic!)

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} You see but you do not observe.
 - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in "The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"

 @{fg highlight}o@{fg text} Albert Einstein, when asked to describe radio, replied: "You see,
   wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his
   tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you
   understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send
   signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that
   there is no cat."
