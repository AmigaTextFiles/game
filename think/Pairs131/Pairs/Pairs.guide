@node Freeware

Pairs is freeware. This means everybody is allowed to copy Pairs but it is
strictly forbidden to manipulate one of the files or to remove a file from
the package. You are allowed to include your highscore file.

You use Pairs on your own risk!

Although Pairs is freeware, I would appreciate a small donation and you
would support Pairs Amiga development. Otherwise this (version 1.31) might
be the final update for Pairs Amiga.

If you want to include Pairs in a package (e.g. a Freeware CD) you MUST
contact me first (e-mail!) and tell me
	- the name of the package.
	- the price.
	- the name of the company who sells it.

It is allowed to include Pairs in the Aminet CD series, the Aminet Set,
the Amiga Games CD and the ACP&TCP CD.

@node Rules

The idea is easy:
 1. You have to find a pair of blocks.
 2. Try (in your mind) to draw a line with 90 degree angles from one
    block to the other.
 3. If this line has zero, one or two angles, both blocks will disappear.

If there is no block left, you completed the level and a new one is
created. To have a real challenge the available time is reduces by 5
seconds every time you have completed a level.
You start with 280 seconds in novice mode and 200 seconds as pro.

The "connection line" needs more time for a longer distance, so find the
nearest pairs.

You do not have to wait for the "connection line", your mouse clicks are
stored in memory.

The program detects illegal moves itself and does not accept them.
With the left mouse button you select a block and with the right one
you can deselect it. Use <Esc> to return to the main menu or press <p>
to pause the game. The game also is paused if you activate a different
window e.g. on the Workbench. In pause mode Pairs needs nearly no cpu
time - very multitasking friendly.

In the menu you can also leave the game by pressing <Esc>.

@node ToolTypes

Supported ToolTypes are:

BLOCK_SET=<name of a block set file>
	This ToolType is necessary to run Pairs. Pairs includes a directory
	"Blocks" with a "Default.PBS" file in it. If you do not have other
	block sets you must set BLOCK_SET=Blocks/Default.PBS. You can also
	load different block sets in the main menu of Pairs, but it is faster
	to load your favourite block set automatically everytime you start Pairs.

DEF_DIFF=<default difficulty level>
	The only valid parameter is PRO, otherwise the difficulty level is
	set to novice. You can also change this within the game.

SCR_MODE=<screen mode>
	The parameters DblPAL and DblNTSC are allowed, to run Pairs in this
	screen mode, otherwise Pairs uses Multiscan:Productivity.
@endnode
@node IFFtoBlock

Usage (CLI only):
	IFF2Block <IFF file name> <Block set file name>

Example: IFF2Block df0:my_picture.iff dh1:Pairs/Blocks/MyOwnBlocks.PBS


IFF file name: The name of a picture file in IFF format (e.g. with DPaint).
	Note that the width of the picture must be 640 pixels and the depth must
	be 7 planes (=128 colors).
	The picture should contain 24 different blocks with a size of 32*32
	ordered in this way:
	(top left corner)
	 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
	21 22 23 24

Block set file name: The name of the block set file IFF2Block will create.
	Pairs is searching its block sets in the directory "Blocks" with the
	suffix ".PBS" (=Pairs Block Set).


Feel free to upload your created block sets to Aminet. To make it easier to
search for block sets put a "PBS" in the name or in the "Short" line of the
.readme file.


IFF2Block displays the picture while generating the block set. If there is
something wrong with the picture or the colors, you should check the picture
file for a saved "stencil mask". If all fails, you could e-mail your picture
file to me (MIME (not uuEncode!), please) and maybe I can help you.
@endnode
@node MergeHighscores

Usage (CLI only):
	MergeHighscores <score file name1> <score file name2> <new score file name>

Example: MergeHighscores dh0:pairs/my_score df0:friend_score ram:new_table


score file name 1 and 2: The names of existing highscore files (default is
	"Pairs_highscores").

new score file name: The name of the new highscore file MergeHighscores will
	create. To use this new merged highscore table, you have to copy it to your
	Pairs directory an rename it to "Pairs_highscores".


If MergeHighscores detects similar entrys in both highscores, it uses this
entry only one time. Merging a highscore to itselfs will create a copy of
the highscore.

MergeHighscores is usefull for groups of Pairs players. Everybody is playing
on his/her computer with an own highscore file. After a period of time there
is only one name left in the highscore and it is no longer a challange.
So, copy your highscore file to disk, visit your friends and merge all the
highscores together using MergeHighscores and copy it back to your Pairs
directory.

@node Bugs

Bugs? Where are they? Hit them, bash them, kick them!!!
How do you mean "in my program"? - Oh, that kind of bugs! If you really
should find a bug in Pairs, feel free to send me a report about what happend
under which circumstances.

If you email your problem report to me, you will get an anwser within two
weeks and maybe a corrected version of Pairs (who knows).

Remember that Pairs needs AGA chipset, OS 3.0, MC68EC020 or higher and
the screen mode Multiscan:Productivity, DblPAL or DblNTSC.
The name of the main program must be "Pairs" and it must have an icon file
"Pairs.info", or it cannot find the ToolTypes.

@node Projects

If you like this game and if you believe in my programming skills, you
can download all my games from Aminet or on the DIGITAL Nightmares homepage
http://www.Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.de/~miha (mainly PC stuff).
The PC version of Pairs with a fantastic explode effect is also available
on the DN homepage.


Other Amiga games are (all AGA only):
 AmiCross (game/think) - a logic puzzle game (german)
 BOOM (game/2play) - BomberMan/DynaBlaster clone

...and maybe more will follow.


You are a graphic artist? You want to create graphics for games? You have
some free time?
If you can answer this three questions with a loud "YES", then it is time
for you to contact me (email prefered). Send some samples of your work in
IFF, GIF, JPEG (high quality) or PCX format.
