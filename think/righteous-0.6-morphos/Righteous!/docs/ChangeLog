Added time attack mode
The "menu" is now an actual menu
Changed movement behavior from repeating to singular, however, holding either of the control or alt keys will re-enable the original behavior

Version 0.5 (6/23/06)
===========
Added sprite 'explosion' effects
Extended the splash screen to a basic title/menu screen
Added a "CPU demo" mode (note: this is just for fun, right now the A.I. is less than intelligent but this will be changed later)

Fixed a few other issues :)
