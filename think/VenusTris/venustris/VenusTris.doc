I had just saw the file "War Games" when I decided to make this program: do
you remember the final part, when the computer is looking for the codes of
the missle and,playing tris, understands that there cannot be a winner?
It's incredible, exciting... The computer thinks, and it understands what
men haven't understood for centuries: the war isn't the final solution
because there is never a true winner.

Ok, but let me say something about the program itself: I made it to see how I
could code artificial intelligence: and I think I made a very good work: I
played over 1.000 games against the computer and I have never won! And
better, the comouter played about 10.000 against itself and the score was
always 0-0.

Playing the game is very easy and you can choose 3 different ways: human vs
human, human vs computer and computer vs computer.
Click the Esc key to quit the game or to finish a game before the real end
(...but do not use it to cheat!!).


That's all and I don't think I have to add anything else: enjoy it!!!

Aminet CD 11. If you know him or if you're the author, please contact me.
