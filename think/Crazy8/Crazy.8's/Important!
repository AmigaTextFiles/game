NOTE:

This version of Crazy 8's can use 256 colour card sets, as well
as the old 8 colour card sets if you have an AGA machine.

It will still work on ECS systems too, but you won't be able
to use the 256 colour card sets.

When designing your own 256 colour card sets, remember that
you must use the supplied palette.  Also, note that the
first 8 colours will be changed when the player switches
palettes during the game.  The other colours will not
change.  DO NOT REMOVE the small coloured box at the lower
right of the 256 colour card pictures - the game uses this
as an ID indicator!
