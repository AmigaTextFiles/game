     Cosmic  Battles  is  a  tactical  combat  simulator  based  on  the game
Cosmic Balance©.  In the game, you design ships and send them into combat.

     There  are  two  distinct  parts  to  the  game.   The design lab, where
you build  your  technological  wonders; and the battle zone, where you watch
those wonders burn in space.

     I  have  included  some  designs  with the game.  You can edit them, but
you can  not save them.  They are "locked" designs.  The designs are from the
six included scenarios in the game.

     As   I  mentioned  above,  there  are  six  included  scenarios  in  the
game. These  are  Escape;  Sector  12; Classic, which is the classic scenario
from Cosmic  Balance©  between  the  Enterprise and Reliant; Gamma Encounter,
which  is a  new  scenario  involving  Star  Trek®  ships; The Coal Sack; and
Escort.   If the references to Star Trek® begin to give anyone ideas of suing
me,  then  warn me first so I may strike the references from this game.  I am
not in the business of being sued.

	"If regulations are not clear and orders not thoroughly explained, it is
the commander's fault.  But when they have been made clear, and are not
carried out in accordance with military law, it is a crime on the part of the
officers."

Installation:

      Installation  is  easy.   Copy  all  the  files  to  wherever  you want
them. You  do  not  have to install on a hard drive, but you will probably be
sorry  if you  don't.   You  will  need  to  copy  the  CB font to the FONTS:
directory.   If  I can find a way to avoid having to do this, then I will put
it in a later version.  That way, you can easily install and uninstall Cosmic
Battles and not wonder where the devil that CB.font came from.

   Once  the  game  is  installed  and  you've  cleared  up most of your chip
ram, your  ready  to  go.   Click on the Cosmic Icon and the game will begin.
If Cosmic  Battles  finds  a  problem with moving in, a requester will appear
to tell you what went wrong and then the program will clean up itself as best
it can.

Beginning the game:

     Once  the  game  has  started,  you  will  be  presented  with the title
screen. In  the  center  of  the  screen are your choices.  You can go to the
ShipYard, where  you  construct  your  new  ships;  you can Refit an old ship
design;  you can pick one of the built in scenarios to play; or you can quit.
You  may  also select  one  or  two  player mode.  Clicking on the One Player
button  for a second time will turn it red.  In this way you can choose which
side you will control once the game starts.

     There   are   two   choices   in   the   scenario   box   that   require
further explanation.   These  are External and Custom.  The External selector
is  for expansion  sets  of  more  scenarios.  None exist at the time of this
writing. Custom  is not a complete scenario designer, it is a method of using
your ships  in  a  scenario.   When  Custom  is  selected,  you must tell the
computer what  ships you wish to use for each side.  Then the game will begin
as usual.

   Escape:

Player One:

   Nothing   to  report  today.   You  turn  your  small  fighter  to  return
home. While  you  stare  out  into  cold space, thoughts of a warm supper and
some relaxation come to mind.  Suddenly the proximity alarm blares.

   "Unknown vessel detected to starboard.", the computer reports.

   "Scanning     vessel.      Ship     size:     5.     Dreadnought    class.
Disposition: Hostile."

   So  much  for  that  relaxation.   There  is  no way you can stand against
a dreadnought  alone.   Your  only  hope  is  to  get  back  to  base, report
the incident and get help.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player Two:

   What a silly idea.  What is command thinking?

   Your   orders  are  to  warp  deep  into  alliance  space  and  attack  an
alliance colony.  You are to do so alone.  Once the colony is secured you are
to hold it until more ships arrive.

   Rediculous.   That  deep  into  alliance  space,  you are surely to be met
by greater  force  than  even  a  dreadnought  can  withstand.   However, you
have your orders.

   "Coming out of warp space, commander!"

   "Shields up.  Battle ready status.  Any contacts to report?"

   "No sir.  Wait, one.  It's a small two man attack craft."

   "Is that all?  Just the one small ship?"

   Maybe command knew what it was doing after all.

   "Move to attack."

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Victory Conditions:

   Player  one  is  in  a  size  1  vessel.   To win the scenario, the vessel
must exit the right side of the battle field or destroy the dreadnought.

   Player   two  is  in  command  of  a  size  5  dreadnought.   Destroy  the
attack craft and the battle is yours.

Sector 12:

Player One:

   CAPTAIN'S LOG:

   We  were  sent  out  to  investigate  pirate  activity  on  the upspin rim
of space.   It  has  been  two days without any contacts.  I have allowed the
ship's engineer  to  power down the shields in order to repair an overheating
problem in the emitter coils.

   "Captain, contacts to fore and aft."

   "How many, Ensign?"

   "Three,  four...   six.   Six  contacts  of  sizes  two  and  three.  They
are pirate vessels.  At least one may be armed with disruptors."

   Jehosaphat.   Six  ships,  one  of  them  may have disruptors, and we have
no shields.

   "Engineer, I need those shields back now!"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player Two:

   Hovering  in  witch  space  is  an  old tactic.  The alliance has sent out
one dreadnought  class  ship  to  catch  us.   We  will  just  wait  here for
our opportunity.

   "Commander,  their  shields  have  been  down  for  some  time now.  Shall
we attack?"

   The   alliance   vessel   lowered   their  shields  almost  6  hours  ago.
They wouldn't  do  that  in  potentially dangerous territory unless something
was wrong.

   "Make the jump into normal space.  We attack."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Victory Conditions:

   Player   one  is  in  a  size  5  dreadnaught.   You  begin  the  scenario
with shields  powered  down.  You must destroy the pirate vessels in order to
win.

   Player  two  is  in  command  of  six  vessels.   Four of size two, two of
size three.  You must destroy the dreadnought in order to win.

Victory Conditions:

   Player  one  is  in  command  of  the  Enterprise.   It  will  start  in a
random location  in  the battle field.  You must destroy the Reliant in order

Gamma Encounter:

   This  scenario  is  inspired by the television show, Deep Space Nine®.  It
is from the first episode in which we see the J'em Hadaar.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Victory Conditions:

   Player  one  is  in  command  of  one  size  four  ship, the Oddessey; and
three size  two  ships,  Run  Abouts.  One of the Run Abouts is damaged.  You
must escape  off  the  left  side  of  the battle field with the Oddessey and
the damaged Run About.  It will not be easy.

   Player  two  is  in  command  of  seven  J'em Hadaar vessels.  Four are in
close range   to   the   damaged   Run  About.   You  must  destroy  all  the
Federation intruders to win.  The vessels are all size 3.

Escort:

Player one:

   You  are  on  the  last  leg  of your journey.  The three cargo transports
have made  it  this  far  without  any  problems.   Now  you have entered the
Katan nebula,  a  favorite  ambush site for pirates.  As expected, as soon as
you enter the nebula, your scope shows several pirate vessels approaching.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Player two:

   The  transport  group  must  come  through  the  Katan nebula, there is no
other way.   You  have  readied  a  rabble of pirates from your local sect to
ambush   the group.   Knowing  that  the  nebula  will  hamper  the  Escorts'
electronics, this should be an easy raid.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Victory Conditions:

   Player  one  is  in  command  of  three escort ships and three transports.
You must  get  the transports to the bottom edge of the battle field in order
to win.

   Player  two  is  in  command  of  five  pirate  vessels.  You must prevent
the transports from reaching the bottom edge of the battle field.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment note:

      This   scenario  takes  place  in  a  nebula.   Shields  will  be  less
effective at deflecting damage.  The map scanner can only identify targets up
to half normal range.

Victory Conditions:

   Player  one  is  in  command  of  the  MacArthur and Sinbad.  You must get
the Sinbad  off  the  right  side  of  the battle field or stop all the motie
ships from exiting the left side of the battle field.

   Player  two  is  in  command  of  four  motie ships of varying sizes.  You
must get  any  or  all  of the ships off the left side of the battle field to
win.

Ship Design 101:

   If  you  chose ShipYard from the title screen, you will be asked to select
a hull  size  and  a  technology  level.   These  attributes  will effect how
much space  your  ship  has  , how fast it may accelerate, how much damage it
can take,  how  effective  it's  weapons  are  and  so  on.   In places where
techlevel and  size may effect your decisions, they will b e noted.  For now,
the  bigger the  ship,  the  more  massive  it is.  The higher its technology
level,  the  more effective it's systems and the more space some of them will
take up.

   A  good  ship  design  depends  on  what you want from it.  You may design
a 'jack-of-all-trades  '  sort  of  ship,  but  this  will  not be as good as
a specially-designed,  side  firing  transport  escort.   On  the other hand,
the side  firing  escort  is  more  vulnerable  to  front  and  rear attacks.
This brings  to  mind  a  few  things  to remember.  Know your enemy and know
yourself. Match strength against weakness and defend your vulnerabilities.

   The  design  panel  is  broken  up  into  two  parts.  On the left side of
the screen   is   an  information  panel.   It  contains  constantly  updated
information on  your current ship design.  On the right side of the screen is
the  current design  aspect  you  are  working  on.   There  are three design
aspects.   The  first one  you see is the equipment panel.  The other two are
weapons and shields.

   First   we  will  discuss  the  design  panel.   At  the  top,  under  the
design name,  is  a  box  containing  information on the amount of hull space
left,  crew efficiency,  ship's mass, its maximum speed and acceleration.  In
addition, the box displays power output and rack space.

   Below  this  box  are  two  large  gadgets.   The one with the disk is for
saving the  current  design,  the one with the door is for leaving the design
facility. Beside  these  two  large  gadgets are three gold bordered gadgets.
These  are used  to change to the other design aspect panels.  The top one is
for entering  the  equipment  panel.  The gadget depicting a clenched fist is
for the  weapons  panel,  while the third one, enblazoned with the image of a
green shield, is for the shield panel.

Equipment Panel

   The  panel  shows  the  number of each of several systems your ship design
may have.   Each  is described below.  In addition, the box at the lower part
of the   design   panel   contains   a  brief  description  of  each  device.
Clicking anywhere  within the borders of a particular piece of equipment will
change the description to that of the requested device.

      WARP DRIVES:
         Warp  drives  will  allow  you  to  escape  a  battle  scene  during
the combat  phase.   Escaping  from  a  battle  will only allow you to keep a
certain number  of  victory points since losing your ship altogether will add
nothing to  your  score.   A  ship without warp drives may be towed by a ship
with warp drives in order to allow it to escape.

         Space Required:  One @{"Tech Sector" alink "TechSectors" 0}

      CARGOBAYS:
         Cargo  bays  are  for  carrying  supplies.   Their  only use in this
game is  to  make  a  ship  more  realistic  or  to  use  up some space for a
special design.

         Space Required:  One Tech Sector

      FIGHTERBAYS:
         Fighter   bays   are   launch   bays   for  fighter  groups.   These
fighter groups  act as a guided weapon and will continue to attack the target
vessel until  either  the group or the target is destroyed.  Fighters have no
range limit.

         Space Required:  Two @{"Tech Sector" link "TechSectors" 0}s

      HULL:
         Each  ship  must  have  a  minimum  hull  space.   This  is for crew
quarters and  workspace.   Increasing  the  hull space will increase the crew
efficiency and  thus  the  general  efficiency of your ship.  Additional hull
spaces  are also  required  for marines.  Each marine requires one hull space
for living quarters.

         The minimum requirements are listed in the following table:

           Ship Size       Min Hull Space

               1                 1
               2                 2
               3                 5
               4                10
               5                20

         An  increased  efficiency  will  increase  the  range  and damage of
beamed weapons  since  your  crew will target them more accurately.  Also, an
increased efficiency  will  transfer  to  your  marines and will help them to
fight  off or to overtake another vessel.  To increase the efficiency to two,
add  one  half times  more than the minimum required hull space.  To increase
the efficiency to three, add twice the minimum amount of hull space.

         Space Required:  One Sector

      RACKS:
         Racks   hold   the   targeting   and   launch  hardware  for  guided
missiles. Each  rack will hold either four light seekers or two heavy seekers
or a combination of the two.  Each rack will give your ship four rack spaces.
A light  seeker  will  take  up one rack space, while a heavy seeker requires
two rack spaces.

         Space Required:  Two Sectors

      LIGHT SEEKERS:
         Each  light  seeker  requires  one  rack  space.  A light seekers is
a missile  that  homes  in  on  the  subspace  emmisions  of a target vessel.
Light seekers are effective against enemy shielding.

         Space Required:  One Rack Space

      HEAVY SEEKERS:
         A   heavy   seeker  is  similar  to  a  light  seekers  but  it  has
greater damage capability and a shorter range.

         Space Required:  Two Rack Spaces

      ENGINES:
         Engine   generate   power   for   your  ships  systems  and  drives.
Each engine  installed  will  output  eight  power  units.   The power output
from engines  is  the  amount  of  power available to you during each turn of
the combat phase.  You do not want to under power your creations.

         Space Required:  Two Sectors

      DRIVES:
         Drives  propel  your  ship.   The  amount  of acceleration and speed
each drive will give your ship depends on the ship's mass.

         Space Required:  Four Sectors

      TRANSPORTERS:
         Transporters   are   used   for   transporting  marines  to  another
vessel. This  is  the way in which you may have marines board an enemy vessel
to  take it  over  or  a  friendly  vessel  in order to help defend it.  Each
transporter can transport up to two marines at a time.

         Space Required:  One Sector

      TRACTOR BEAMS:
         The   tractor  beams  are  used  for  towing  crippled  vessels  out
of danger.   Their  only  use  in  the  game is to warp crippled ships out of
the combat arena and thus save some victory points.

         Space Required:  Four Sectors

      ARMOR:
         These   are  extremely  hard  metal  plates  capable  of  deflecting
enemy fire.   A section of armor will absorb all damage from an enemy attack.
Only a  plasma  torpedo  can  destroy a section of armor.  This does not mean
that an armored ship can not be damaged by normal weapons.  The armor plating
will only absorb damage if it is hit.

         Space Required:  One Sector

      MARINES:
         Marines    will   help   defend   a   ship   if   it   is   boarded.
Additionally, they may be transported to another ship to either defend it (if
it is friendly) or to overtake the crew (if it is an enemy).

         Space Required:  One Hull Space (in addition to minimum)

      BELTS:
         Belts    are    electromagnetic   generators   and   point   defense
weapons capable  of  destroying launched weapons.  Belts remain charged until
used,  at which  point  they may be charged again.  Each belt has a chance to
shoot down a fighter or a seeker as well as reducing the strength of a plasma
torpedo.

         Space Required:  One Sector


The Weapons panel:

   Each  ship  may have up to twelve weapons installed.  Each weapon may have
a firing  arc  in  any  combination  of eight firing arcs.  No one firing arc
may contain  more  than a certain number of weapons (dependant on ship size).
The firing  arcs  correspond  to the octants of the complete circle (each arc
has a 45 degree range).

   Below  is  a  chart  matching  arc  with  its  relation to the ship.  Arcs
are also used in shield naming.  The arrow indicates the front of the ship.

            8    1
          7   /\   2
          6   --   3
            5    4

   The  arc  correspond  to  the  small  lights  around  the grey triangle in
each weapon block.  If the light is green, that arc is selected if it is red,
then the weapon is not installed in the arc.

   In  order  to  select  a  weapon  for  a  ship, click on the left or right
arrows below  the weapon's name.  The computer will change the weapon type to
the next  weapon  for  which  you  have  room.  In order to select which arcs
to install  a weapon on, either click on the arc light to toggle installation
or click on the corresponding numbered button at the bottom of the panel.

   The   help  box  in  the  design  panel  will  display  information  about
the current weapon type.

   The computer will skip some weapons if you do not have the room to install
them.   Also,  a  weapon  arc  may not light up if it will exceed the maximum
weapons per arc as given in the following chart:

      Ship Size           Maximum Weapons per Arc

          1                         2
          2                         4
          3                         6
          4                         8
          5                        10

   Each  weapon  requires  a  minimum  amount  of space for the targeting and
power converting   hardware.    Each   additional   arc  added  to  a  weapon
requires additional  space.   Space  required  is  given in two numbers.  For
example:   1/2 ,  3/16  means that the first arc will require one half sector
while  any additional  arcs  will  require  3/16ths  sectors each.  The space
remaining slot on the design panel will only show integer values.

   The  damage  values  are  given  as  a number and a typical range ( damage
@ range)  followed  by  a  note.   If  a d follows the damage value, then the
weapon will drain additional points from the enemy shielding.  The damage and
range values  are  for  an  average ship design.  The actual points will vary
depending on   distance   fired,   crew  efficiency,  ecm/eccm  conflict  and
technology  level. Refer  to  figure  3.1  for a chart of the damage to range
ratios.  (figure 3.1 is an ILBM file included with the docs).

Weapons descriptions:

   LIGHT PHASER:
      A  high  energy  beam  weapon  which  melts through the outer skin of a
enemy ship.

      Damage:         10 @ 15
      Space Required:  1/2 , 3/16

   HEAVY PHASER:
      A larger, more damaging version of the light phaser.

      Damage:         14 @ 20
      Space Required: 1  , 3/8

   SIEGE PHASER:
      Siege   phasers   are   the   most  damaging  class  of  phaser.   They
were designed for destroying fortress starbases along contested boundaries.

      Damage:         20 @ 30
      Space Required: 2  , 3/4

   PHOTON TORPEDO:
      This  isn't  a  real  torpedo  in  the  sense  of  a  launched  weapon.
Instead, it  is  a  beam  weapon  that  fires multiphasic (varying frequency)
pulses thus overtaxing an enemies shields.

      Damage:         14d @ 20
      Space Required: 2   , 3/4

   DISRUPTOR:
      The  disruptor  is  slow  charging,  but  has  the longest range of any
beam weapon.   It  is  less  accurate  than the other beam weapons and can be
evaded by a fast moving ship.

      Damage:         12+TechLevel @ 100  (effected by speed of target)
      Space Required:  2   , 3/4

   PLASMA TORPEDO:
      The  plasma  torpedo  generator  has  one launch emitter and always has
a 360  degree  firing  arc.   The  weapon  requires  three rounds of charging
before the  torpedo  is  ready to fire.  Once it is fired, it will home in to
the target  vessel  releasing extreme amounts of energy.  A plasma torpedo is
the only weapon that can destroy armor.

      Damage:         60 @ 32   (looses power at longer ranges)
      Space Requried: 15 ,  0  (all  arcs  available  to  each  plasma
                                emitter installed)


Shields:

   Shields  are  not  required,  but  are  a  nice  thing  to  have  on  your
ship. Shields  are assigned to arcs.  As with weapon firing arcs, shield arcs
cover a  45  degree  section  of  your  ship.  The circle on the shield panel
for building shield power on your ship's design.

   Each  shield  strength  requires  eight  shield  batteries.   Each  shield
battery requires  1/64  space.   The  number  displayed  is the actual shield
strength  for a  given arc.  For example, a value of eight in the area of arc
one means that shield arc one has a maximum shield strength of eight.

   To  change  the  value  of  a  shield  arc, click on the lighted box below
the arc  you  wish  to  alter.   Clicking  the  up  or down arrow next to the
shield control will increase or decrease the shield strength by one.

When you are done:

   When  your  done  making  a  ship design, you can save it or scrap it.  If
you click on the exit gadget without saving your design, it will be scrapped.

   To  save  your  design,  click  on  the  large gadget depicting a disk and
a blueprint.   You  will  be  presented  with  a  file requester to save your
design with.   The  requester  will  only show directories and file which are
ship designs.   Do  not panic if your word processing program does not appear
on  the file  list, it does not show up because it is not a ship design.  The
name you give for the file will become the ship's design name.

    Two  things  happen  when  you  save  a  ship  design.   If  enough space
remains on  your  ship,  the  computer  will  add more shielding.  If all the
shield  arcs are  full,  the  computer  will add layers of armor.  The second
thing  that  will happen  is that the computer will weed out the empty weapon
blocks.  If you have some empty weapon blocks between full weapon blocks, the
computer will move the full weapons up.  This does not effect the functioning
of the weapons, it simply keeps things neat.

     You may leave the design lab by clicking the exit gadget.

   "Now an army may be likened to water, for as flowing water avoids
the heights and has tens to the lowlands, so an army avoids strength and
strikes weakness."

      Note:    if   anyone   has  any  ideas  of  suing  me  for  using  Star
Trek® "things"  in  this  game,  let  me  know  and I will immediately remove
all references.  I am not using these "things" as a selling point.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Combat

   This  is  the  normal  playing  mode  of  the  game.   Once  you  select a
scenario or saved game, the game will begin.

   First,  the  screen  will  notify  you  of which player's turn it is.  The
other player  should  leave the room, but it isn't required.  Any keypress or
button click will bring the player to the ship command area.

   The  screen  will  have  a  red  palette  if the ship currently under your
control is nearly destroyed.

   There  are  four  command  screens.   Even  though  they  cover  different
aspects of the ship, they all share some characteristics.

   One  of  these  characteristics  is  the  gold  bordered  gadgets.   Every
screen will  have  these six gadgets on them somewhere.  These are used to go
to the varios games screens.


                         -------------------     
                         |  A  |  B  |  C  |     
                         |     |     |     |     
                         -------------------     
                         |  D  |  E  |  F  |     
                         |     |     |     |     
                         -------------------

A - depicts CRS and a rainbow line.  Go to Navigation console.
B - depicts a clenched fist.  Go to Weapons console.
C - depicts a white cross on blue. End this turn of commands.
D - depicts blue graph with DCON.  Go to Damage Control console.
E - depicts green shield.  Go to Shield console.
F - depicts floppy disk.  Save game and possibly quit.

   Another  common  characteristic  is  the  tabs  at the top of each screen.
These are used to select among your ships to command.  Simply click on one of
the tabs and that ship will be ready to recieve your instructions.

The Map

   Two control screens contain the map.  The map controls are described here.

   The   top  portion  of  the  map  is  the  actual  visual  display.   Your
current ship  is  portrayed  by  a  blue square, usually in the center of the
display.   The map  may  contain  several  other symbols each of which have a
different meaning. Below is a legend.

   Blue square  - Current vessel.
   Green square - Friendly vessel.
   Red square   - Enemy vessel.
   Yellow X     - unknown or out of zoom range.
   White circle - Plasma torpedo.
   Blue circle  - Heavy seeker.
   Red circle   - Light seeker.
   Grey hash    - fighter group.
   4 Brown dots - asteroid.

   The  map  display  also  serves  as  a target plotter.  If a red square is
on the  current  display,  you may click on it to make it the current target.
It's information  will  be  displayed below the map in the target information
block.

   The  map  console  is  very  full  of  information.   In  addition  to the
display and  information, there are several buttons for handling predictions.
There are also the gold bordered screen gadgets.

   Two  of  the  additional  tools  on  the  map  are ovoid gadgets depicting
a magnifying  glass.   These  are  used  to  zoom in and out as labeled.  The
map will  only  go  out  to  a  zoom  factor  of  5.   Each  zoom  factor  is
approximately 2 times the area of its previous fact

   Next  to  the  magnifying  glass  is another number.  Beside which are two
gold gadgets.  A plus and a minus.  These are used to predict the location of
the objects  on  the  display  during a given turn segment.  You can click on
these gadgets to get an idea of w

   The  current  power  readout  is  also  on  the map console.  It is simply
a measure of available power for this turn.

Navigation Console

   The   navigation   console   consists   of   the   scanner   map   and   a
navigational array.  The map has already been described.

   On  the  navigation  console  you  will  find  two  lists  of  16 numbers.
These are your current ships course and speed for the 16 segments of the next
turn. You  will also notice a dark area with a small green anchor next to one
of the rows of the lists.  This

   Connected   to  the  lists  of  numbers  is  a  box  containing  a  circle
within which are some blue buttons and a number.  These four buttons are used
to change   the  course  of  your  ship.   They  correspond  to  the  compass
directions.

         0
     315 o 45
       \ | /
 270 o- xxx -o 90
       / | \
     225 o 135
        180

        The   red   arrows  are  also  buttons,  which  correspond  to  their
respective compass directions.

   By  clicking  these  buttons,  you can change the number in the box toward
the value  the  blue  button represents.  If you double click the button, the
value will  immediately  become  the  button's  representational  value.  The
number between  the  blue  buttons  is  the  current  desired  course change.
Clicking on it will activate the course change.

   You   may  not  be  able  to  move  to  the  desired  value  in  the  time
allowed during  the next turn.  It depends on your speed, available power and
number of functioning drives.

   The  course  change  will  begin  at  the  segment  immediately  following
the green  anchor.   So  if  you  wish to start a course change at segment 8,
you would  click  in  the  space next to the 7th row of the course list.  The
green anchor will move to that spot.

   Above  the  course  changer  are  pictures  of  a  turtle  and  a  rabbit.
The number  beside  each  represents  the minimum and maximum speed your ship
can attain  in  this  turn.  The rectangle with the purple spot in it is used
to change  the  speed.   Clicking  on  it  near the rabbit will increase your
speed while clicking near the turtle will decrease it.

   Also,  you  can  engage  the  warp drive from the navigation screen.  This
is only  possible  if  you  have  some  warp drives remaining and it is after
turn number  10.   Engaging the warp drive will cause your ship to escape the
battle scene, but not necessarily win the scenario.

   Lastly,  the  navigation  screen  contains  a  nameplate  for  your  ship.
It serves no practical purpose.

Weapons Console

   The  weapons  console  contains  the  map  console.   The  map has already
been described.

   On  the  left  of  the  screen is a bank of weapons your ship has.  Blocks
that are  shaded  are  damaged weapons, these are unavailable to you.  Blocks
that contain  the  EI  logo  are empty weapon blocks, they represent no loss.
Finally, there will be blocks containing information.

        ------Weapon Name------

    Arcs  Charge      F   C   D
          Status  target information

        -----------------------

   The  arc  circle  displays  the  available  arcs  the  weapon can fire in.
The triangle  represents your ship.  Green lights indicate a go status, while
red ones are not in the firing arc.

   The  charge  status  indicates the readiness of the current weapon.  If it
is a  green  light,  you may fire it in this turn.  Some weapons require more
than one  charge  before  they  can  be  fired.   In  these  cases the charge
status indicates how many charges rema

   A  weapon  can  only  be  charged  once  per  turn.  This is done with the
C button.   A  weapon  will not hold its charge for more than one turn, so if
you do  not  fire it when it is ready, you will lose the charge.  In the case
of plasma and disruptors, the charge

         Weapon        Power

   Light Phaser        1 unit
   Heavy Phaser        1 unit
   Siege Phaser        2 units
   Photon              5 units
   Disruptors          2 units for 2 turns (4 units in all)
   Plasma              5 units for 3 turns (15 units in all)


   If  you  have  charged  a  weapon  and  decide  you  do  not want it to be
charged, you  may drain the weapon.  This is done with the D button.  In this
case, any power put into the weapon during this turn will be taken back out.

   Finally,  you  can  fire  you  weapon.   you  may  only  fire  a weapon if
its status  is  green  and  you have a target aquired on the map.  An aquired
target need  not  be  showing.  The aquired target is the one which the map's
target information block is displaying.

   The  target  information  will  help  you  decide  what  and when to fire.
It displays  the  range  of  the  target  at  the  beginning of the turn.  It
also contains  a display called Arc.  The two numbers are the target's shield
arc facing your current ship and the c

Damage Control Console

   This  screen  displays  information  on  the  amound of damage your vessel
has sustained.   It  also  shows the number of crew members, drives, engines,
cargo holds  and  missile  racks  remaining.  Most important of these are the
three boxes labeled damage, extra and crit.

   Damage  is  the  percentage  of  damaged  space  your  ship  has sustained
thus far.  The larger this number is, the more extraordinary damage your ship
will recieve.

   Extra   represents   the   amount   of   extraordinary  damage  your  ship
has recieved.   Extraordinary  damage  is  caused  through  the  loss of crew
members, marines or jammer/sensor equipment on board.  The more extraordinary
damage you recieve, the higher your chance to recieve Critical damage.

   Crit   represents   the   number   of   critical   points  your  ship  has
remaining. When this reaces 0, your ship is destroyed.

Shield Console

   The  shield  console  is  used  to  charge  jammers and belts.  It is also
used to  order  the transport of marines and towing of vessels.  In addition,
it is used to manipulate shields.

   Ecm   and   Eccm   are   similar   devices.    Ecm  will  jam  an  enemies
targeting capability,  making it less accurate.  Eccm is a jammer jammer.  It
will counteract  the  enemy's  Ecm,  possibly neutralizing it.  Charging your
Eccm can mean the prevention of damage.

   Belts   can   also   be  charged  here.   Ecm,  Eccm  and  belts  are  all
manipulated in the same way.  The left arrow will decrease a charge while the
right arrow will increase it.  Belts will remain charged until they are used,
Ecm and Eccm must be charged each turn

   Clicking  the  tractor  beams  will  pop  up  a  list  of  vessels  in tow
and vessels  available  for  towing.   The  number  on the display represents
the number of remaining, functioning, tractor beams.  The column of red names
are those  ships on the current vessel's tow list.  When a ship escapes using
warp drives,  any  vessels  in tow will go with it.  A ship may tow one other
ship for  every  functioning  tractor beam it has.  A ship may only be on one
tow list  at a time.  Clicking the yellow checkered gadget will close the tow
list display.

   The  transporter  is  operated  with  the left and right arrows.  To order
the transport of marines, you must click the right arrow.  This will increase
the number of marines to transport.  The current target, displayed at the top
of the  screen,  will  be  the  transport target.  If the target is friendly,
these marines  will  join  those  of  the target vessel.  If the target is an
enemy vessel,  they  will  attempt  to  overtake the crew.  Weapons fire does
not discriminate   between   enemy  and  friendly  marines.   Firing  upon  a
boarded vessel may result in the death of some of the boarding party.

   The   circle   occupying   the   left   portion  of  the  screen  contains
shield information.   Each  number  represents the current charge of a shield
arc  as well  as  the  number  of uncharged batteries.  Batteries will become
discharged from  absorbing  weapons  fire.   The number on top represents the
current  shield charge  while the number on the bottom of each box represents
uncharged batteries.  To manipulate a shield arc, click on its display box, a
requester will appear.

   ____________
   |   xxx    |
   |          |
   |        n |
   |   mode   |
   |          |
   |        t |
   |          |
   |      yyy |
   |          |
   | ok cancel|
   ------------

   xxx represents the maximum number of power units available for the
current mode.
   n is the shield arc which you are manipulating.
   mode is one of three types - charge, drain or transfer.
   t is only important during a shield transfer.  It is the arc you wish
to transfer power from.
   yyy is the number of energy units you wish to apply to the current mode.
   ok and cancel are self explanatory.

   There are three modes of operation - charge, drain and transfer.

   Charge  means  that  you  want to charge yyy batteries of the current arc.
The maximum  represents  the number of batteries left to charge or the number
of power units available to charge them with.  Whichever is smaller.

   Drain  is  useful  if  you  need  emergency  power.   It  is  inefficient,
the maximum  represents  the  number of charged batteries.  yyy is the number
of batteries you wish to drain.  The amount of power you recieve will only be
1 in  every  four  units.   So  if  you  drain  16  batteries  you will get 4
power units.

   Transfer  is  a  more  effiecient  way  to  charge another shield arc with
power from  the  current shield arc.  It is not a 1:1 ratio, but it is better
than draining  then  charging.   The power transfered will be half the number
of batteries you drain.  The number at the top of the requester is the actual
maximum  number  of  batteries  you  can  charge with power from the selected
shield arc.  So if you transfer 16 units from shield arc 4, shield arc 4 will
be drained by 32 units.

   Ok to make it so, cancel to change your mind.

Done

   When   you   are  done  entering  orders  for  this  turn,  click  on  the
gold bordered  gadget  with the white cross.  This will allow the next player
to enter  commands.   When  the  second  player is finished, the battle phase
begins.

victory by seizing opportunity without hesitation.  If strict, his troops are

   At  the  beginning  of  each  battle  phase,  you will be asked which ship
to center  the  action  on.   After  selecting  a  ship,  the  next  turn  of
battle begins.

   The  battle  screen  contains  few  controls.   There  are  two magnifiers
for zooming  in  and  out,  a pause button and a display of the center ship's
name.

   You  may  zoom  in  and  out  at  any time during the game, paused or not.
After all  16  segments are over, the display will stop and a new button will
appear. Press  this  continue  button  to  go  to  the next round of entering
commands.   You may  also  use  this time to study the situation.  Pausing is
disabled at this point, since it is pointless.

   The  winner is the player who meets the requirements of a scenario such as
removing ships from the battle area or destroying all enemy vessels.  If both
players meet their respective requirements, the game is declared a draw.

   The  scores  are dependent on the amount of ship each player has remaining

   Many  years  ago, I played a game called Cosmic Balance.  I found it to be
an interesting  and  fun  but  I've only seen it on the 8 bit machines.  When
I bought  my  Amiga  2000  in  1990,  I  decided  to  write a version for the
new generation of 16 and 32 bit machines.

The  first  incarnation  worked,  it had sound effects and some graphics.  It
only worked on my machine, though.  I never figured out why.  The project got
packed up and promptly lost.  Meanwhile I continued to study for my Bachelors
Degree.   Near the  end of my studies, I found that others were interested in
this  game.   So, I took up the keyboard again and set out to create a second
incarnation.   This one  I  had  up  to  an  early  alpha-beta stage.  It was
playable  to a point and I even distributed to several people spread over the
US.   Alas,  finals  and studies came up and the second try at Cosmic Battles
had a bug in it I just could not chase down.

   Now,  I  have  graduated.   While  looking  for a job during the summer, I
found that  I  had much spare time on my hands.  Time enough to finish my art
work. So, Cosmic Battles 2.00 project began.  This time, there were no stops.
I would  not  settle  for  anything  less  than  perfection.   I also decided
to implement my variations on the theme.  So, I began work.

   Responses  from  the  second  version (that first one had no version since
it really  didn't go anywhere), of Cosmic Battles helped in my redesigning of
the interface.   My  practice and study of art work in other games has helped
me  in creating  the  art  work  in  Cosmic.   My  friend,  also  owner  of a
professional sound  studio,  helped  me to find and create sound effects.  My
new  030/33Mhz accelerator  made  the  wait  time  on ray trace rendering and
compile  time livable.  The title screen of Cosmic Battles v1.00 took 8 days.
Now, it takes less than an hour.  All of these ingredients have come together
