@NODE INTRODUCTION "Introduction"
This is yet another MineSweeper clone for Amiga. The reason why it's made
is simply because I wanted to do my own and try to make it atleast just a
little bit better than the other versions I've seen.

The reason of the strange name is because the swedish army has a
"minesweeper" called Glufs-Glufs. That's why! :-)

@ENDNODE

@NODE INSTALLATION "Installation"
Simply copy the GlufsMines directory where you want it, no assign's or
anything else needed. The game will create a highscore file in the
startup-path called Glufs.scores.

@NODE FILES "Files"
The complete archive contains the following files:

@NODE SYSTEM "System requirements"
The game is only tested on an A1200, 28MHz, OS3.0, 4Mb FAST RAM but it
should work on any Amiga with atleast OS2.0.

@ENDNODE

@NODE GAME "Game"
The goal of the game is to find all mines on the minefield.

Use left mousebutton to reveal a square. Use right mousebutton to mark a
square with a flag, if you press the right mousebutton on an already
marked square the flag will be removed.

The numbers printed in the revealed squares tell you how many neighbour
squares that contains mines.


To start playing a game, choose New game in the menu.

You may choose different levels in the menu. In the custom level you may
choose your own size of the minefield, change the size by altering the
size of the whole window using the size-gadget in the lower right corner.
Highscore is disabled in the custom level.
