     Hello world. This is Amiga hextris, a unique version of "Tetris" based
on hexoganal pieces. Please note version 1.0 of Amiga Hextris is copyright

     I think that pretty much sums up the legal stuff. 'nuff said. 
     On to the important details.

Welcome to the world of hextris...

WHY DID I DO IT:

     I originally saw this program on a Sun terminal running under the 
X-Windows environment. I liked what I saw and wanted the game on my Amiga 
2000. I had never done any 'real' programs on the Amiga yet and this seemed
as good an excuse as any to learn. So, after a lot of work (and many visits 
from the Guru meister) here it is. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as 
I have.

WHAT IT IS:

     Hextris is a variation on the 'Tetris' theme. As you all know Tetris
is a game where geometric shapes drop into a well. The pieces stack up until
the well is full. The stack can be shortened if a horizontal line is 
completed. The game pieces are based on rectangles and each piece has
four rotations.
     What's the twist, you ask? Hextris has the same gameplay as tetris, but
the game pieces are based on hexagons. Therefore each piece has six rotations
instead of four. Which makes for a unique challenge (hey, I enjoyed it).

INSTALLATION:

     After unarchiving you should have these files:

     hextris        - The executable.
     hextris.info   - The icon.
     hextris.scores - The high score file.
     readme         - readme.
     ppmore         - You had to readme with something.
     .info          - One of those Amiga things.
     source         - Sorry no source yet, maybe later...

     Before running the program you should tell the system where you want
the high score file to reside. The program attempts to read the high score 
file from HEXTRIS:
     To define HEXTRIS: , at the cli type 'assign HEXTRIS: df0:' or whatever/
where ever you feel is appropriate. You can also name the disk that the 
program resides on as hextris. Where ever you define HEXTRIS: is where the 
high score file will be written! If you do not define HEXTRIS: , NO SCORE 
WILL BE WRITTEN.

PLAYING THE GAME:

     The game may be run from the cli or from the icon. After the game is
run you should see the highscores and some helpful info to the right. The
helpful info to the right tells you what keys to press to play. I think you
can figure out the rest...

THE FUTURE:

     According to the original X-Windows readme:

	Hextris has been ported to X, and the Andrew Window Manager.
The ports to mac and pc are under way. Hextris has been compiled for
these system types: IBM RT, VAXstation 3100, DECstation 3100,
SPARCstation 1, Sun 3/35, and macintosh running mach unix.

     I don't know about any other versions other than my version for the
Amiga and the X-Windows version.

     I don't know what else can be done to this game. I would like to add
some sound (ala The T). You know, some beeping and flashing or something.
Although it's not really necessary, it sure wouldn't hurt. Perhaps some
form of two player version? Both players using the keyboard at the same time
(ala the arcade Tetris).

     If you have any suggestions please let me know. I'll certainly listen
to them, but who knows if I'll find the time to act upon them.

THE THANKS:

     Of course someone should be thanked or this space would be empty...

Thanks to David Markley for his original version of hextris. I tried to
send you email about my port, but never got a response. Hmmmmm.... Are you
out there David?
Thanks to Tadd Jensen for his playtesting, suggestions, and use of his Amiga
3000 (you scum) for testing under a 2.04 OS. (I still have the lowly 1.3).
Thanks to Sheryl, you know who you are.
Thanks to Fred, Fred Fish that is.
Thanks to the MCCC, Metroplex Commodore Computer Club, for supporting the 
Amiga and its users.
Thanks to YOU, for reading all this crap. Why aren't you playing hextris?
