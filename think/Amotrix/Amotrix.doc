Amotrix V1.1. Date: 30-Mar-97.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quick Note
~~~~~~~~~~
This game was originally written around 1992. I just recompiled it using my
AMCAF  Extension  and changed some music and sound routines and a few other
things. There are still the same old bugs in it like in 1992,  but  now  it
works  on every Amiga. I also added the possibility of using any ProTracker
module as ingame music.

The Game
~~~~~~~~
This is another Tetris variation with some more ideas. First there is a new
object:  a  drop  which  fills  five  free  fields in the playfield using a
special algorithm.

Then there is an energy bar, which you can increase by  pulling  the  stick
down and decrement by pressing the joystick up. What does this mean? If you
press your joystick down, the falling speed of the object will is increased
and  fill  the energy bar. If you have enough energy left, you can stop the
object by pushing the joy up. This can be very useful in higher levels.

Finally, if you get a line in the two player  mode  the  opponent  loses  a
field  (wicked,  isn't  it?).

In the main menu you can choose from three different  sets  of  objects  by
simply  pressing  a key from 1 to 3. The first on is the normal and easiest
set. The second I think is the most difficult one. The third  set  is  just
medium, not too hard.

Now quick instructions of the game: You have to stack the  objects  falling
from  the top so that you get a whole horizontal line. This line disappears
and the lines above fall down. You  can  rotate  most  of  the  objects  by
pressing the fire button. After a number of lines you've destintegrated you
will get to the next level which will be more difficult. At the  top  there
is  the  number  of  lines  left.  Then there is a box which shows the next
object that will follow. Remember: The more lines you make at  a  time  the
more  score you'll get. To be exact:

1 Line   150 Points
2 Lines  600 Points
3 Lines 1350 Points
4 Lines 2400 Points
5 Lines 3750 Points

Note: If you find the game too fast press H as this will halve the speed of
the game, but this will also halve the points you get. Press P to pause the
game. You can't make a break when somebody has to enter  his  name  at  the
Hiscores.  If  you  press  ESCape  once you'll be Game Over, and then press
again you will get back to the menu.

The Controls

Further Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Amotrix examines the PROGDIR: drawer by default to find some ingame musics.
To  recognise a module, Amotrix searches for 'mod.' at the beginning of the
filename. Only one module is provided, but you can place up to 30 different
module in this drawer. If you already have a large module directory on your
harddisk, you may want to use the MODDIR=<modulesdrawer> ToolType instead.
