@node Introduzione "Introduction"

Welcome to Quid?...

First of all thanks for coming into contact with QUID? !

               @{b}What's "QUID?" ?@{ub}

Quid? is a simple, multiple answers quizgame based on images.

Quid? characteristics are:

  It runs in complete multitasking with Operative System.

  It can be run from @{"WorkBench" link controllo} or from @{"Shell" link controllo}.

  256 colour screens in HIRES LACED 640x512 mode or @{"VGA:Productivity" Link controllo} 640x480
   NOT LACED !

  The possibility to handle up to 100 @{"levels" Link livelli} of 12 questions each.

  The possibility to create custom levels through an intuitive, suited to the end program @{"(QuEd?)" Link QuEd}.

  Images handling through DataTypes (and the possibility to use different
   graphic formats from IFF, such as GIF or PNG which are more compact and
   as much fast to handle).

  The use of less than 500k of chip memory.

  English and italian localization (even if questions can actually be written in any language
   that makes use of the ASCII Characters Set).

  The easiness to @{"control" link controllo} through the use of mouse or keyboard.

  Simple and intuitive interface.

  99% of graphics in 256 colours.

@endnode

@node Specifiche "System requirements"

                @{b}SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS@{ub}

 Quid? makes use of Datatypes and you need at least @{b}OS version 3.0 @{ub}
  to run it.

 Quid? operates on 256 color screens and therefore requires an Amiga
  provided with @{b}AGA chipset @{ub}.

 Quid? preferably requires an @{b}HardDisk@{ub}, even if it would be possible
  to run it on floppies. Actually this possibility is not yet implemented, but
  it will be if anyone asks me for.

      @{B}ATTENTION !!!@{uB}

Due to reasons of space, all quiz images are in PNG format; it is therefore
required a proper datatype in order to load them.
Datatypes that fit for this purpose are to be found easily in most PD archives.
In alternative, it is always possible to re-convert images into IFF format, paying
attention to keep the original dimensions (263x162) and related palette.

@node installazione "How to install Quid?"

              @{b}INSTALLATION@{ub}

  The @{b}installation@{ub} of Quid? is extremely easy and should be carried
  out automatically, thanks to the script (included in the package) which can be
  run using the Amiga installer.
  The installation provides :

   Creation of a new directory called "Quid".
   Decompression of LHA archives into the above
    mentioned directory.

       @{b}CONTENT OF LHA ARCHIVES:@{ub}

QUID (DIR)

  Quid.info
  QuEd
  QuEd.info
  Quid.Guide
  Quid.Guide.info

        IMG12.GFX
        QUESTIONS

      LEVEL01   (DIR)
         ...

      LEVEL02   (DIR)
         ...


Just in case the installer doesn't work properly, please
follow these steps manually...

  Create a new directory called "QUID";
  Copy into the above mentioned directory the following files:
          data.lha
          levels01.lha
          levels02.lha
          Quid.guide
  Unarchive the lha files typing in (from shell):
             lhex x data.lha
             lhex x levels01.lha
             lhex x levels02.lha

An LHA version (lhex) has been included in the package.

The program doesn't need any other assignment.
To run Quid? have a look at @{"Control" link controllo}!

@node gioco "The game..."

      @{b}QUID? Description of the game.@{ub}

    The goal of this game is to answer correctly and as quickly
    as possible the questions you'll be asked.
    You may choose among 3 difficulties for the game (skill level)
    which meet with different scores for each correct answer.
    The game breaks down into various @{"levels" Link livelli}.
    As you gradually proceed with questions, the time you have
    to read and answer them decreases. When time on your hands
    is up, you loose one of the four initial lives, whereas if
    you answer correctly the remaining time will be added to your
    score as a BONUS.
    The quizzes you must answer are based on an image, which is
    linked up with a small description and a brief question
    followed by three possible answers.
    The game ends when you answer at least 4 questions the wrong
    way or in case you finish all levels.

@endnode

@node livelli "Levels..."

                       @{b}LEVELS@{ub}

    All the game is divided into more levels. To get through a level
    you must answer correctly all the @{b}12@{ub}questions of the
    level itself. Quid? can handle up to 100 levels.
    In the main archive of Quid? there are only 5 levels which are
    to be found in the directory "LEVELS", each one composed by a
    sub-directory called LEVELxx, where xx states for a number
    between 00 and 99. Through the use of @{"QuED?" link Qued} it
    is also possible to create new levels.

@endnode

@node controllo  "control"

             @{b}HOW TO RUN  Quid?...

    please type @{b}quid VGA@{ub}.

    @{b}...from WorkBench:@{ub} double-click the Quid's icon. If
    you intend to use a VGA productivity screen (640x480 NOT interlaced)
    then type into the Icon's ToolTypes the following row:
    @{b}SCREEN=VGA@{ub} and then save.

  '2'                  ANSWER "2"
  '3'                  ANSWER "3"

When Quid? asks for a key to be pressed, you can press any key.

@node QuEd "QuEd? The editor of Quid? "

        @{b}CREATE A NEW LEVEL@{ub}

Quid? offers you an editor to create new levels and this
is a very simple operation...

  Make a new directory inside "LEVELS" and call it "LEVELxx"
   where xx represents the number of level you're creating. That
   number has not to be strictly consecutive to the present ones.

  Then copy in the new directory the 12 images of the new level.
   These images must be called IMGxx.GFX where xx states for a
   number in the range 01-12. The images must keep the size
   @{b}263x162@{ub} and respect the 256-color palette which is
   included in the package and called TEMPLATE.IFF. It should
   be noted that images don't necessarily need to be kept in
   IFF/ILBM format, since they're all loaded through datatypes, but
   must absolutely have the GFX extension.

  Run QuEd? and edit the new file called QUESTIONS that has to
   be saved in the new level's directory you've just created.

QuEd? is rather intuitive. Every image comes up with 3 multiple-answer
questions, one for each difficulty. Every single question is composed
of 5 fields:

   Description field.
   Description/Question field.
   Answer field #1.
   Answer field #2.
   Answer field #3.

...the meaning of such fields is obvious. The correct answer for the
question will be selected among the three MX gadgets... -1- if the correct
answer is the first, -2- if it's the second, -3- if it's the third one.

Quid? recognizes the new levels on its own.
