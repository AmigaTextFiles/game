C4 is yet another version of the original connect 4 game.  The game
involves each player taking turns droping a colored peg into the grid.
To win the game, the player must have 4 pegs in the row: 
horizontal, vertical or diagonlly.   A tie is consider when the grid
is full and no winners.  The game allows one or two players.  However,
in one player mode, the computer can be easily be beating, this is
due to the coding of the computer playability.  


Getting Started
---------------

C4 requires aleast 512K chip memory and any version of the ROM would
work, but have not tested on WB2.0 since I took it out of my machine
(go figure!! eh??) ... and a joystick in port2.


You can start C4 in CLI by simply typing C4 and enter at command prompt.
And for workbench users, simply double click the C4 icon.

SORRY BUT C4 WILL NOT MULTITASK.  IF YOU PRESS LEFT-AMIGA-N TO SWITCH
TASKS AND PRESS LEFT-AMIGA-M TO GET BACK TO C4, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO SINCE C4 DO NOT HAVE ITS OWN SCREEN.  TO END THE C4 SIMPLY HOLD DOWN
ON THE JOYSTICK AND PRESS FIRE BUTTON.


Let's Go
--------

C4 consists of a grid and menus on the right side.  When is your turn
you will see your colored peg on top of the grid, use the joystick
left and right to move your peg back and forth and press the fire
button on the desired place.  Player use the same joystick, so players
must alternate.

To activate the menus, hold the joystick up and press the fire button.
You will see the first menu hilighted.  Pressing the joystick down will
cycle through all the menus.  To select a menu, press the fire button.


Menus
-----

Player 1  -- puts the game in one player mode, you and the computer.

Player 2  -- puts the game in two player mode, two humans.

New Game  -- restart a new game.

Quit      -- quit game and return to environment.

About     -- Help screen.


To end the game while playing, simply hold the joystick down and press
the fire button.
