@node faq
@title "Frequently asked questions"

 @{bold "Frequently asked questions:"}

 @{bold "Q: Why is the puzzle not black & white?"}
 A: ACD uses the first four colours from the workbench palette.
    (Gray, Black, White, Blue)
    With the tooltype BLACK=1 you can choose another pen for the black colour.
    With the tooltype WHITE=2 you can choose another pen for the white colour. 

 @{bold "Q: Is it possible to change the size of the game window?"}
 A: With the tooltypes WINWIDTH & WINHEIGHT you can set the max window size.
    As default the max window size is the same as the size of your Workbench screen.
