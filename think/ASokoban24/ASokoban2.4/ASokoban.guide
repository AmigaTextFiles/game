@{b}Wellcome to ASokoban!@{ub}

This is an implementation of the UNIX game Sokoban for the Amiga. It has the
original 90 levels of the UNIX game, which means that if you already have
played the original game, you will find ASokoban's stages familiar).

@node Acknowledgements "Acknowledgements"

Many people have shared their feelings about ASokoban with me, but there are a
few who's ideas, comments and work have helped me a lot in improving this
game. These people include Ivo Kroone, Fredrik Hällgren, Piotr Grygiel, Lars
Christian Schreiner, Uwe Röhm, Kenneth Fribert, Jouni Jääskeläinen and Niels
Knoop.

I hope that you will always let me know your feelings about my products. It's
through such communication that the progress of Amiga freeware continues to be
accomplished.

Last but not least I would like to thank Panagiotis Cristias for letting me
take over this project. Without his original work ASokoban wouldn't have been
what it is today.

@node Installation "Installation"

To install ASokoban from scratch or to update an old version just run the
installation script. (The script requires Commodore's Installer to run. If you
don't have it, it can be found on aminet).

If you update from versions prior to 2.0 your old highscore file will
automatically be converted to a new highscore file.

If you choose to install the MagicWB style icons without having MagicWB
installed you can still get them look nice. For this purpose you need at least
an 8 color WB and you will have to load the correct color palette into the
Palette Preferences. The palette can be found in the misc dir (one for 2.x and
one for 3.x).

@endnode


@node Requirements "System Requirements"

ASokoban will run on any Amiga computer with version 2.0 or higher of the OS
(or at least I hope it will).

If you have version 2.1 or higher ASokoban will try to use the @{"language" link Localization} you
have selected through Preferences.

@endnode


@node Troubleshooting "Troubleshooting"

If you get the message "Screen is too small!" when you run ASokoban, you are
either using a too big screen font or you're trying to run ASokoban on a too
small public screen. ASokoban is guaranteed to open on a 640 x 200 screen with
a screen font of resonable size.

When there are no public screens open you will get the message "Couldn't lock
public screen!".

If you get a message about opening libraries make sure you've got at least
version 37 of the system libraries.

Any other messages are probably due to lack of memory. They're not likely to
show up.

@node Game "The Game"

Sokoban is Japanese for Warehouse keeper. In ASokoban you control a strange
pair of eyes through the maze (warehouse) of each level. The purpose is to
push all the money packets into the safe, which is the colored area of the
maze. You can ONLY push the packets - you can't pull them, pick them up or
in any other way manipulate them. Once all money packets are in the safe you
proceed to the next level. There is no time limit (you can sit all day trying
to solve a level). If you have already solved a level you can try to solve it
again - this time with less moves and pushes (there is a highscore entry for
every level). 

The eyes are moved either by the cursor keys or by the mouse. To move the eyes
with the mouse press and hold the left mouse button. The eyes will then follow
the mouse pointer. The right mouse button is equivalent to Undo and the middle
mouse button can be used to Backup/Restore a game.

@endnode


@node Gadgets "The Gadgets"

The following gadgets surrounds the playfiled:

   New         - Starts a new game at the current level (useful when you get
                 stuck).
   Undo        - Undos the last push (not the last move!).
   Set Level   - Lets you choose the level to play. Actually, it works only
                 backwards, giving you the chance to replay previous levels.
   High Scores - Displays the high score list.
   About       - Shows info about program (i.e. version number and author).
   Backup      - "Saves" temporarily your position (before a risky step).
   Restore     - Restores the previously "saved" position.
   Name        - Pops up a file requester to select the name of the file where
                 you want to save your position for later. Note that your
                 level position will also be saved in this file, allowing you
                 to continue the next time from the current level. By default,
                 the name of the file is "ASokoban.data" (when you change it,
                 it will be saved in the @{"tooltypes" link Tooltypes} array of the program icon).
                 This name is displayed in the string gadget on the right of
                 the name gadget. The file name can also be changed by writing
                 directly in the string gadget.
   Load        - Loads the data file.
   Save        - Saves the data file (happens automatically on exit).
   
Extra information is displayed on the right of the playfield. This is the
level, the total number of money packets of the level, the number of saved
money packets and the total number of moves and pushes of the eyes.

To quit ASokoban press the closegadget of the window or press 'q' on the
keyboard.

@endnode


@node Tooltypes "Tooltypes"

The following tooltypes are recognized by ASokoban:

@{b}PUBSCREEN@{ub}=<name of public screen>
Use this to open the window on other public screens than the default one (if
there is no public screen with the given name, the program will try to open
its window on the default public screen).

@{b}DATAFILE@{ub}=<name of datafile>
Name of data file where you have saved your position.

@node History "Version History"

(v1.0a - v1.1c by Panagiotis Christias)
1.0a    : First stable version. Distributed among my friends only for beta
          testing.

1.0b    : First official release.

1.1     : Compiled with SAS C 6.1 using Reqtools.library 2.1. Undo bug fixed
          (found it myself!). Now ASokoban saves its position  automatically
          on exit ( reported by Kriton Kyrimis ) . Level 15  bug fixed , now
          ASokoban  counts as saved  packets which are  in the safe from the
          beginning of a level (like level 15 ) . First reported by  Carsten
          Steger . When  loading a datafile  maxlevel won't decrease if max-
          level of datafile is smaller than  current maxlevel . Suggested by
          Sebastian Delmont.

1.1c    : ASokoban used to have some problems  when finishing a level  using 
          the mouse . Bug is fixed , now  ASokoban  does not  lose any IDCMP 
          message ( reported by Markus Torpvret) .  This version of ASokoban
          supports any  kind ( and size ) of font  for the titlebar .  First
          reported by Terence Russell and Ives Aerts ( still Asokoban is not
          font sensitive, sorry...).

(Project taken over by Lorens Younes)
v2.0 (95-02-08) ASokoban is now fontsensitive (falls back to topaz 8 if the
                graphics won't fit with the user prefered fonts).
                Support for locale.library added.
                Gadgets are now disabled when they have no function.
                PUBSCREEN and DATAFILE tooltypes added.
                New highscore list (one high score for each level instead of
                an overall top ten).
                Documentation in AmigaGuide format.
                Installation script for Commodore's Installer.
                ReqTools.library no longer used for requesters
                (asl filerequester used instead).
v2.1 (95-02-25) ASokoban will no longer crash you system if the number of
                moves exceed 9999 (reported by Jouni Jääskeläinen).
                Zoom gadget (re)added on Panagiotis Christias' "demand" ;-)
v2.2 (95-03-01) Now ASokoban correctly handles translated gadget labels
                without an undersore (reported by Uwe Röhm).
v2.3 (95-05-27) Undo no longer causes system failure under AmigaOS 2.x (first
                reported by Fredrik Hällgren who also solved the problem for
                me).
                Five more levels included from xsokoban.
v2.4 (95-06-05) Bug that caused some strange text to appear over the name
                gadget fixed (reported by Niels Knoop).

@node Future "Plans for the Future"

Write more @{"catalogs" link Localization} (if you help me).
Add "online-help".
Write level editor.
Scalable graphics (requested by Niels Knoop).
More colorful graphics.
Smarter mouse control.

@endnode


@node Localization "Localization"

ASokoban is localized, so if you have v2.1 or higher of the OS ASokoban will
try to use the language you have set in Preferences. If there is no catalog
for your language, English will be used as default.

Since I'm not very good at languages I've only written one additional catalog
(the Swedish one). However I've included some files so that you easily can
make ASokoban support your language too. Read Catalogs/Instructions for more
information.
