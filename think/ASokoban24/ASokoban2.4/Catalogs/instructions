How to write new catalogs
-------------------------
Translate the strings in template.ct and save it as <language>.ct. Then send
that file to me so that I can include it in my package.
NOTE_1! The first two characters in menuitems are used for menu shortcuts.
The first one is the shortcut (space means no shortcut) and the second is
always a nullbyte. Make sure you don't use the same character as shortcut
for different items in the same Menu!
NOTE_2! Gadget labels for gadgets with keyboard shortcuts look different from
gadget labels for gadgets without keyboard shortcuts. The difference is the
underscore ('_') placed before the character ment to be the shortcut for that
gadget. Be aware when placing the '_' in your translated gadget labels so that
you DON'T USE THE SAME SHORTCUT TWICE.

You may include a line in MSG_ABOUT_REQMSG saying who the translation was made
by. It should look like this:
;
MSG_ABOUT_REQMSG
%s v%s\nBy %s %s\nCopyright © %s %s\nCopyright © %s %s\nTranslated to English \
by Lorens Younes
;
and in a Swedish translation it would look like this:
;
MSG_ABOUT_REQMSG
%s v%s\nAv %s %s\nCopyright © %s %s\nCopyright © %s %s\n÷versatt till svenska \
