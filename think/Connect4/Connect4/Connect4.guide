@{b}About Connect 4@{ub}

Connect 4 is a brand new version of this classic game for your desktop. It features
a MUI interface, a Player Address Book to store names and player types, a handy
turn indicator and the best graphics in any game of the same genre I've been able
to find on Aminet.

See the section "Usage" to find out how to play!

MUI 3.8 and Lamp.mcc

@{b}Beginning a game@{ub}

When you first load the game, you'll be presented with a New Game window. You
can type a name straight into the text gadgets, or click on the icons to the right
to bring up your Player Address Book entries, where a double click will copy that
name into the text gadget for Player 1 or Player 2, respectively.

To play, hit the Start button!

NOTE: When you want to play another game, you can bring this window up again
      by selecting the "New Game" option from the Project menu.


@{b}Playing the game@{ub}

Each player can use the mouse to click on the column in which they wish to place
their counter. During play, you will notice that the small light next to each
player's name is lit when it is their turn to place a counter - this is a handy
reminder if you get distracted mid-game!

Play continues (in case you hadn't guessed yet! ;) until either player manages to
complete a row of four counters in their own colour, thereby winning the game. In
the event that the entire board becomes full, and no line of four counters exists
for either player, the game is declared a tie, and you'll just have to try harder
to beat your opponent next time! :)


@{b}Creating new players@{ub}

Choosing the "Connect 4" item from the Settings menu will bring up the settings
window for Connect 4, the first page of which allows you to manage the contents of
your Player Address Book. Here you can add or delete a player entry, or clear the
whole list and start again.

To create a new player entry, hit the Add button. This will bring up a window
allowing you to enter the new player's name, type and, if necessary, any extra
details required by Connect 4 for the particular type of player you create.

The three player types available are:

   Local        Anyone sitting at the computer and using the mouse to play the
                game, and requires no further details. Create a player of this
                type to store your name so that you don't have to type it in each
                time you play. 

   Remote       Anyone you want to reach over a TCP/IP connection, with their IP
                address in the extra details box to the right of the player type
                selector.
                @{B}NB@{ub} Although you can create players of this type, network
                   play is still in development.

   Computer     A computer player, with the desired skill level in the extra
                details box to the right of the player type selector.
                Currently supported skill level range is 1 - 2.

And finally, use the "Save as default" option in the Settings menu to save your
player details.

Connect 4 was developed using nothing but patience, pizza and the excellent
C compiler VBCC v0.7 by Volker Barthelmann. If you find any bugs or have any
suggestions for Connect 4 please contact me.


@{b}So who drew that funky icon?@{ub}

Connect 4's extremely funky icon was drawn by Pete Ross, a self confessed
addict from the moment the first version of the game hit Aminet, and now
the official Connect 4 beta tester. His contribution to the project has
been invaluable. Cheers Pete! :)

v0.5    - changes to button layout throughout GUI
        - changed code to use SDI_compiler.h so that Connect 4 can
          now be compiled using any compiler, not just vbcc
        - fixed a small problem where Connect 4 would try to use the
          game icon when in an iconified state, even if no such icon
          was found
        - improved speed of graphics remapping
        - better looking gameboard graphic
        - improved speed when clearing pieces for a new game on chunky
          displays (P96 and CGFX)
        - computer player at level 2 is now more careful than before
        - safer loading of preferences file
        - reduced code size for address book handling

        - added the source for the windows, which was accidentally
          missing from the previous release

        - changed the Player Address Book to accommodate computer and
          network players more clearly

        - when a game was complete (won or drawn) the LED on the main
          board wasn't lit for the last person to place a piece in the
          gameboard: fixed
        - added a computer player
        - changed $VER string so that version number appears
          without having to use the "full" switch with the
          version command
        - name fields no longer left blank: will automatically
          substitute in the name(s) "Player 1" and "Player 2"
          instead
        - Changed the winner's window to indicate which colour
          counters the winner was using, as well as their name

          incorporated into executable

v0.2    - erm... plays Connect 4 now! ;)

v0.1    - internal, first version. Loads a picture of a Connect 4
          board, but that's as good as it gets at the moment!
