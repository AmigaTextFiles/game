   IMPORTANT NOTICE - Owners of 1 Mb Amigas:


      For Spelltris, the recommended minimum
   configuration is 1 Mb CHIP memory, and at
   least an extra 0.5 Mb of either CHIP or
   FAST memory.  With this amount, you can
   run the game from Workbench without any
   hassle.


      The game will also run without too much
   trouble on machines with just 1 Mb CHIP memory,
   but it must be booted from floppy and run
   without Workbench.  Depending on the size
   of music files etc., it might eventually run
   out of memory, normally when accessing the
   "Info" screens.  Treat it gently.


      With 0.5 Mb CHIP and 0.5 Mb FAST, you
   could have problems.  Again you must boot
   from floppy.  IF YOU ACCESS THE "INFO" 
   SCREENS, A CRASH IS VERY LIKELY.  However
   you should still be able to play the game,
   and select all the options as normal.  Maybe
   if you leave out the music, you will be able
   to access the info.


      Those with more than 1 Mb of memory can
   use a packer such as Imploder to shrink
   their personal copies, which will also
   make them load faster from floppy (and
   leave space for more music).  You can also
   multitask Spelltris, but don't try it
   unless you are well supplied with memory.


   
   GENERAL INFORMATION:


      To load Spelltris from Workbench, just
   double click on its icon (I'm talking to
   1.5 Mb owners now).  Make sure you have
   access to the following libraries (in your
   LIBS: drawer):

             "mathtrans.library"
             "translator.library"

      Also the "narrator.device" must be present
   in your DEVS: drawer.

      No special fonts are used.


      Spelltris should have a Music drawer
   (directory) containing Med modules,
   which it will load at the start of the
   game.  This must be a sub-directory of
   the drawer in which Spelltris and its
   associated files are kept.  Due to the 
   fact that I can't pack the game (it makes
   it harder to run in 1 Mb), the contents
   of this directory will be scanty in the
   distributed version.  But you can add
   modules (from magazine coverdisks etc.)
   to it.


      If you want, you can delete/rename
   this drawer and assign MEDMUSIC: to any
   drawer or volume you like.  I intend to
   support this assign in future products.
   If you are a programmer, you may wish
   to do the same, where this approach to
   in-game music is suitable.  The idea is
   that the user can have a large drawer of
   favourite tunes on hard disk.  The assign
   is purely optional, but if you don't 
   have it you should have a "Music" drawer
   (it can be empty if you like) - otherwise
   the program will pop up a volume requester.
  
 
      You can get any other info you need
   from the on-line help system (just click
   on "Info" when the game loads) ... but
   see note for 1 Mb owners.


      If you can't read the info, here is a
   summary:


   CONTROLS: Mouse recommended.
  
   MOUSE: Left button  =  Drop block (instantly)
          Right button =  Pause game
          Both buttons =  Quit
          Move Left/Right or Up/Down as appropriate
 
   JOYSTICK: Fire = Drop block
             P    = Pause
             ESC  = Quit
             Directional movement as appropriate
               Pull joystick down to hasten fall
             of block without losing all control
  
   KEYBOARD: SPACE = Drop block
             Pause and Quit as for joystick
             Use cursor keys for directional movement
               (as for joystick)


      The intro screen shows many gadgets,
   most of which should be self-explanatory.
   Choose direction of gravity, and board
   width.  Easy or Hard game means words
   must have either 3 or 4 (or more) letters
   respectively.  A "Hard" game  is more fun
   for better players, because 3-letter words
   frequently appear by accident in the "Easy"
   game , and often prevent you from making
   long words.


       You can choose a starting level from
   1 to 9 which controls the speed at which
   blocks fall.  As you might expect, the
   level increases with time.  If you start
   at a high level, it doesn't increase until
   it would be time for it to pass that level
   if you started at level 1.  So you can
   increase your score by starting at the 
   highest level you can play easily.


      The harder the game, the more you score
   (the score also depends on word length and
   letter content).  In general, similar total
   scores should be possible for most Width and
   Hard/Easy settings, because when the setup is 
   easier you can make better words.  40000 and 
   upwards is a good score.


      WORDS: The dictionary contains 25000
   words, no proper nouns or acronyms.
   With longer words, derivatives such as
   plural or past tense may not be accepted.
   I've been fairly liberal with slang and 
   abbreviations.  A few words were removed
   to avoid causing offence, although the
   scatologically-inclined will still find
   plenty of scope!
 
   
       Spelltris is a good way to increase
   your word power - have a decent dictionary
   standing by and check out any words that
   you and the computer disagree on!
