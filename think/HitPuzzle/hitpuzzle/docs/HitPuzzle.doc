LIMITATIONS WITHOUT THE REGISTERED KEY
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Nothing high-score saving. (Ehmmm... I'm been too good perhaps...)



WHAT IS THIS THING?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
HIT PUZZLE is an original game think  with pleasant and strange characters,
where  you  can  deal  with  yourself in a high-score hunt or a friend in a
challenge to last point.


- One player mode -

In  every  screen,  you  must  join  at least three balls of same colour to
complete  a  line,  you  can  join  the  balls  in  horizontal, vertical or
diagonal.   When  you  have completed all the lines to do, you skip to next
level.  If you exceed with a ball the danger line, the game ends.  Warning,
in  the  long run, the sea level will raise the balls and if a ball exceeds
the  danger  line,  the  game ends.  In some levels, there are Jolly balls,
that can be used to join two or more balls of same colour.


- Two player mode -

Just  wins  who has more points after one or three rounds.  There isn't the
raise  of  the  sea level but you have only few seconds to launch the ball.
Warning,  if  a player (deliberately or not) with a ball exceeds the danger
line, will lose the round/match.


- Score -

Three horizontal balls =  10 points
Three vertical balls   =  50 points
Three diagonal balls   = 100 points

The  score  doubles to each ball added.  Examples:  Four vertical balls are
100 points, five diagonal balls are 300 points, etc.

HIT PUZZLE' HISTORY
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    1.0    Date: 05/05/1997

           First version

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    1.1    Date: 15/05/1997

           Added some sfx

           In version 1.0 in two player mode, the score of three horizontal
           balls of the second player was of 60 points instead of 50 points

           DiskFont.library is not necessary now

           Other small updates

           With the registered key, now the game save the high-score

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    1.2    Date: 19/06/1997

           The level 10 has been fixed

           Updated the "balls explosion" without the consume of too memory

           Other small updates

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    1.3    Date: 02/07/1997

           Pause mode fixed

    1.4    Date: 29/07/1997

           Sometime after played to "two player mode", in the "one player
           mode" there wasn't the updating of the score

           Changed and added some levels

    1.5    Date: 04/12/1997

           Added a small program "HighScoreConverter" that converts the
           high-score files of the old HIT PUZZLE versions (for v1.4 or
           previous versions). Now the high-score file is 272 bytes in
           length in comparison with the 296 bytes of the old high-score
           file. Required the ReqTools.library

           Changed the look of the Jolly ball (I think that it's much
           better now)

           No strange noises in the last part of the main menu music
           (Musicians remember do not use empty samples into your music
           modules!)

           No flicker of the balls in the main menu that sometime happened
           on Amiga 500

           Other small updates

    1.6    Date: 20/02/1998

           Fixed the request of FAST memory (before, the request of FAST
           was higher than necessary)

           Other small updates

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
