                                  ¯¯¯¯¯¯
I  want  thank  the  cool  guys that have sent me their modules, but if you
don't  send  me  even  your  home  addresses I can't send you my reply that
contains even the registered version of the game in question.

                            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I'm  searching  musicians  for  simply  projects (little games, music disk,
etc.).   Concerns  me every type of ProTracker modules. Each module used in
my  projects,  will  have  the  author's name in the credits obviously, the
registered  version  of  the game in question and for those who want, their
home/e-mail address and a short message.

                        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Even though the game is already published, if you want, you can send me set
of  tiles  for  the  future  versions  of  the game, the best tiles will be
included in the game.
