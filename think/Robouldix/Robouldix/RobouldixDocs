                              Introduction

This  is the demo version of our payware game, which goes by the name of
Robouldix.   If  you  do  like the game and would like the full version,
please refer to the section "How to register."

We  have  put in a substantial amount of time in creating this game, and
have  done  our  best to make it as good as possible.  As far as we know
there is no game based on Boulder Dash that is as advanced as ours.

Some facts about the game:

The game uses 32 colour graphics.

The game senses and adepts to PAL and NTSC.

The screen is updated fifty times per second (or sixty if you are a NTSC
user)

There are over 500 different objects in the game.  Where we use the word
"object"  to refer to almost anything in the game.  That is a monster is
an  object,  and  so is a wall, a diamond, a door, or whatever.  A great
many of these object have several animation frames.

The game contains about 150K graphics and about 150K music data.

                                  ===

                              Requirements

This  game  needs  at  least one megabyte of memory.  Other than that it
should work on all Amiga configurations.

You  may  start  the game from either CLI or Workbench.  Or you may just
unpack the archive to an empty, installed disk and boot from it.

If  the  game does not start up correctly try to free up more memory for
it.   Memory  can be pretty tight on a bog standard one meg machine.  If
nothing  else work, put the game on a floppy disk an boot start it, this
should give more than enough memory.

It is possible to install and run the game from your harddisk.

We  have  tested it on A500, A600, A1000, A2000, A3000 and A4000 without
any  problems.  The various machines we have tested the game on have had
a  wide variety of different add ons.  So it ought to work on just about
any Amiga configuration you may have.  If it does not work on your Amiga
please refer to the section "How to report a bug."


                                  ===

                         How to play the game.

Most  likely  you have already tried the game, since few read the manual
first.  But here are some explanations of differents things.

First of all lets go over the controls.

The joystick:

Up, down, left and right does what you would expect :-)

The button have a couple of uses:

If  you press the button and pull the joystick in a direction one of two
things will happen.

1) If the object you "point" Rob (the main character) at is a solid, non
takeable object, then Rob will try to push the object away from him.  If
the object is pushable, and not to heavy it will be moved.  This is also
the way you operate certain things, such as switches.

2)  If  the  object is something that Rob may pick up it will disappear.
And if it is not just a valuable it will appear in Robs inventory.

If  you  hold  down  the button without pulling in a direction and arrow
will  start  to  flash  on the scoreboard.  It will move about the three
icons  that  are  located on the left of the scoreboard.  If you release
the  button  while  the  arrow  is  over the first icon you will trigger
whatever  object  you have choosen as the "Fast choice" in the inventory
meny.  The same thing happens for the second icon, only that you trigger
the  "Second choice" from the inventory.  If you release the button over
the "i" icon you will enter the inventory.

The keyboard:

M & S
Displays an option screen for the SFX and music.  You may select; "Music
&  SFX"  if you want both music and soundeffects.  And "Music", "SFX" or
"Silcence"  if  you  prefer  to hear only one type of sounds, or none at
all.

P
Pauses until you press your joystick button.

Left shift
Brings up the inventory menu.

Left alt
Triggers  whatever object you have choosen in the "Fast choice" from the
inventory

Left Amiga
Triggers  whatever  object  you have choosen in the "Second choice" from
the inventory

Esc.
Brings  up an option menu, where you may; "Restart level" which lets you
start  over  a  level if you are having difficulties.  "Visit DOS" which
pauses the game and returns you to the workbench screen where you may go
about  your  business  as usual, and once you want to return to the game
you  just  click  on  the close gadget of the window that says "Close to
play Robouldix." Or you may choose "Exit to intro" which brings you back
to  the  intro  screen, where you may select another level to play.  And
last  but  not least, you may choose "Change Level" which enables you to
skip to any of the six levels that are included in the demo version.

The  main  object of the game is to collect enough valuables to open the
exit  so that you may proceed to the next level.  Only certain valuables
counts  towards  the opening of the exit, and certain of these are worth
more  or  less  exitpoints.   The number of exitspoints that you need to
collect before finish the current level is displayed in the counter left
of the ":D" on the scoreboard.  Certain exits may open or close on other
occations.  And there exists hidden exits which leads to bonus levels.

For  each  level  you  have  a  certain  amount  of  time to collect the
valuables  and  get  to the exit.  The time is displayed to the right of
the  "T:"  on  the  scoreboard.  Note that the timer counts at different
speeds on different levels.

                                  ===

   Hints and descriptions about some of the things you will encounter

Since  this is in many ways a game of exploration we will not reveal the
purpose  of  every  object  you  may  encounter.  But we will tell you a
little bit about a few of them...

The   different  diamonds  you  find  will  give  different  scores  and
exitpoints.   The basic blue diamond give five points towards your score
and  decreses  the exitpoint counter with one.  Diamonds of other colors
give more or less points.

The switch on level one manipulates the direction of the yellow arrow in
the  wall  below  the  skulls.   The  arrow  in  itself is a directional
doorway.

On  level one the exit is obstructed by a box with green bars in it.  To
remove  this  you need to lure monsters into it.  Once two monsters have
entered the box it will explode.

There  are  two  hidden  blue diamonds on the first level.  There may be
more on other levels...

Pushing  the  right  object  on  level  three  will give you a shower of
diamonds.

There  is  a exit to a secret level on level three.  There is another on
level four.

                                  ===

                 What is missing in this demo version?

Several  features  are  deliberatly  removed  from  the  demo version to
encourage  you to register, and recived the real version.  The following
is  a  list  over  extras  that  may  be found in the real version (some
features might not make it in to the final version.)

The two player option is removed.

You will get save:able highscore.  Overall and for each level.

Support  for  multibutton  joysticks and the ability to use the keyboard
instead of a joystick.

The real version features about 200 levels, many more monsters, weapons,
treasures, bonuses.

This  demo  version  utilizes  about  40  different objects in the game,
whereas the real version features about 500 objects!

The  graphics and sound effects are being redone right now, so they will
be even better in the final version.

Well, basically you get *lots* of extras if you do register the game.

If there is a sufficent level of interest (read:  if we get enough money
:-)  there  will  be  an  AGA  version,  a  level  editor,  and  further
enhancements (that may or may not cost extra.)

                                  ===

                          How to report a bug.

If you find a fault in the game, then *do* report it to us as quickly as
possible so that we will be able to fix the error.  Try to write down as
much  as  possible about how the bug manifested it self and what you did
to  get  it to appear.  Try to include a description of your system, for
example what sort of processor you have.  And any other information that
you  think  might  prove  beneficial  to us when we shall track down the
error.

If  there is a fault while the game starts up or when it tries to load a
new level startup the game with a "debug" argument, ie "Robouldix Debug"
(this only works from CLI).  You will then get some numbers on the score
board.  Include which number that the last displayed when you report the
bug.

Finally  send  all  that information to us using one of the options from
the "How to get in touch with the authors" section.

                                  ===

                            How to register.

Bugreports   and  wishlist  for  further  features  are  quite  welcome.
Especially if they are accompanied by a registration fee :-)

If you do register, please consider including a brief outline about what
sort  of  a Amiga system you use, and tell us what you liked or disliked
about the game.  This is ofcourse not necessary, but might be of use for
us in the future.

                                  ===

If you live in Scandinavia use the following information to register:

Either  send  us 190skr (swedish crowns), or whatever that amounts to in
you  local  currency  in  an registered letter.  Transfer 200skr to this
postal giro number 637 73 78-2 with the following address;

  Patrik Grip-Jansson
  Bygården, Slöta
  521 97 Vartofta

(The extra 10skr is to cover our expenses for the transfer.)

                                  ===

If  you  live  elsewhere  in  the  world.   The  easiest  and  the  most
inexpensive  way  for  both  parts  is  if you send cash in a registered
letter.   If  you  use  this  method of payment, the registration fee is
US$27 (see the following list for a few other currencies.)

If  you  prefer  to send an international cheque you have to add US$8 to
the  registration  fee (yes, it is that expensive for us to cash foreign
cheques!) If you find any other way to send us the registration fee make
sure  that:   A) We can actually collect the money (for example personal
cheques  from  USA is of little or no use to us) and B) that you inquire
how much it will cost us to collect the cash, and add that amount on top
of the registration fee.

All  around a registered letter with the fee included in bills should be
the safest, cheapest and best way to register.

The  registration  fee in a couple of other currencies is as follows (if
you  want  to send the fee in an other currency make sure that it is the
equivalent of about 215skr (swedish crowns))

 DM                   45
 Francs              160
 Brittish Pounds      18

User groups can contact us for a better price if you get several members
to register at the same time.

                                  ===

Please  note  that  we  will not be sending out the full versions of the
game  until  after  14th of August 1993.  This is to ensure that we have
had the time to fix any bugs that are reported in this demo version, and
so that we have time to add features that might be requested.

However,  all  persons that pay a registration fee before that date will
recieve 20 extra levels as a special bonus!

After  the  release  date  we  should  ship the game within a week after
recieving your registration fee.

And  please...   If  you are offered a pirated version of the full game,
refuse  to accept it and register so that you get your own version.  The
future  of  the  Amiga is up to us, the users.  If we do not pay for our
programs  no  one  will  make  any in the future.  If you do like a game
there  is  no  excuse what so ever for playing a pirated version of that
game!
