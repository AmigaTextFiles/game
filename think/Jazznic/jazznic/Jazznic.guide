@NODE "CHEAT" "Cheating"

 C·H·E·A·T·I·N·G

There are 2 cheats in Jazznic,..

You dont SERIOUSLY think I`m going to tell you them do you?
But I will tell you they can only be done whilst the game

Enjoy searching :)

@NODE "PLAY" "Playing Jazznic"

 H·O·W··T·O··P·L·A·Y··J·A·Z·Z·N·I·C
------------------------------------

Once you have got it running, it`s pretty simple.

The aim of the game is to remove all the blocks by pairing
them with their counterparts.
You do this by moving them around the display.
You control the pointer with the joystick and grab the blocks
with the fire button. (Fire button over blocks selects and
deselects them.)
To get rid of the blocks, you must make all blocks of the
type touch each other. Remember that if there are 3 of one type
and you join 2 together, you will fail. As you have one brick
left and are unable to remove it. So be carful

The laws of gravity apply on the blocks, and they WILL fall
off ledges, if they didn`t, the game would be piss :).

You also have a time limit to complete each stage in..
So you can`t sit there thinking every move out.


 P·A·S·S·W·O·R·D·S
-------------------

Passwords are obtained evertime you complete a stage.
They are 5 blocks. And can be entered on the password screen.
Accessed from the title screen.



Enjoy playing.
