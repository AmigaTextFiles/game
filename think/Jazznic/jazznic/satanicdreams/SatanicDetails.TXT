Satanic Dreams was setup with the intent to bring high quality 
software(whatever it may be) to the Amiga and the PC.

The way we indend it to work is that you are part of a TEAM, and
should subscribe to the mailing list (see: "MailingList.TXT").
The list will keep you in-touch with all other members of
Satanic Dreams.

From the mailing list you can outline any ideas and projects that
you wish to work on and find out if any other members are
interested in developing it with you.

Of course all projects can then be released under the Satanic
Dreams name (one which we hope will be known widly in the future).
As whatever "WARE"(SHAREWARE, FREEWARE, COMMERCIAL) as the Author(s)
see fit. By doing this, your work can be uploaded to the Satanic
Dreams web-site, and to the AmiNet for you!. And we will try to
advertise your projects as much as possible!

We are interested in ANY skills, writers for disk-mag articles,
disk-mag`s, 2D Graphics for demos/intros/slideshows/games, 3D Graphics
for games/logos/others, programmers in different languages 
IE, Blitz/C/C++/Asm/Amos/AmigaE,.etc.,Musicians to compose SoundTracker/
OctaMED/MIDI/DigiBooster Modules, web site designers/HTML knowledge
+ ANYTHING else! If you want to find Playtesters/Beta-Testers/Critics
or you just want to chat, this is the place.

Of course you have NO commitment to Satanic Dreams, and can 
unsubscribe whenever you want!

So if you are interested complete the form ("Signup.txt") and
send it to: signup@satanicdreams.freeserve.co.uk.
And you will receive the Members pack containing all other details.

Founders: Loki & HawkEye.
