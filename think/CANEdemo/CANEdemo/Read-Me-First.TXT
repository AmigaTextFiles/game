     I hope you'll have understanding for my (probably) lousy english!



                            ...::: About :::...

This is a mix of the gravity- and puzzle-series; it's CANE! You controll a
little spacecraft, with wich you are ment to pick up cargo and dudes, and
take'em to the teleporters.   There are loads of stuff - other than the car-
go - to pick up or be afraid of; you'll see!
   The game was created using Blitz Basic 2.1 from Acid Software, Personal
Paint 4.0 from Cloanto, and Pro.Tracker 3.61 from... ehr?.. have to check
that one out \:   And we thank them with all parts of our pumpin' hearts!
   We are, by the way, NOT responsable for the damages that this program
could (but most probably wouldn't) cause your system!   

                          ...::: Shareware :::...

Yapp, this game is shareware, and you may spread-the-shit out of it! But we
would r e a l y  like some response on this one; all our previously released
games have been totaly ignored );   So if you have something to say about 
it, DO IT! But what we like more than anything else is... MONEY!!!   Money
will OFCOURCE give you the full game when it comes (end of April I think!).

          ...::: A short version of the story-sort-of-thing :::...

A long long time ago - in the 21 century - man started using other planets
for some notsowellplaned purposes. Mars, for example, became a great nuke-
garbagecan. Pluto, on the other hand, was a place were you could put nasty
"wobbas" in huge, icy fortresses.   
   Anyway... now - in more civilised times - some ships has been send out to 
clear the shit of the planets, and you have been assigned to the cargo pick-
upteam - C.A.N.E..   That's about it!

                           ...::: Controll :::...

A quick explenation of the joy:
         Up         -> increase speed in current direction
         Left/Right -> rotate ship
         Down       -> totaly drop any cargo carried
         Fire       -> use a pickedup item (shown in a little box)

Picking cargo up...
   Your ship must have its "nose" pointing up, then fly just above the cargo
and it will be grabbed with a robotarm. The cargo will then follow you, but
if the range between your ship and the cargo gets to high, or if fly to
fast, it'll be dropped. Dropping a dude could lead you to some splatt-prob-
lems..!   Take the cargo to the teleporter (where you started), and it will
be teleported to your mothership.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
   The amount of cargos that has to be picked up is displayd on the score-
line, but that is not the whole truth... Dudes are treated just as cargos,
but ALL of the dudes MUST be picked up. So if you are to pick up five cargos
and there are three dudes and three cargos on level, you must leave (or use
- if possible) one of the cargos; NOT one of the dudes!   This is very im-
portant to keep in mind!

Using items...
   Some items - such as antigravity, diving, fuel et.c - will be activated 
at the very moment you pick'em up. Other stuff - bombs et.c - you'll have to
use your firebutton to activate. B.t.w., bombs can only destroy UNNATURAL ma-
terial; you can't blow mountains of, only shit build by man.

                        ...::: A helping hand :::...

Avoid touching sticky/boogy things, such as the roofs under water, nets et.c

Don't pick things up the very moment you see'em. Rather wait until they come
handy.

Magnets and other boogies can be blown off (but you needn't in this demo!).

The nuclear-cargo is explosive, and will make a great piece of hole if you
drop it. Unlike the bomb, it will explode even if it lands on material of
nature.

You must only pick as many cargos up that is mentioned on the scoreline.



                        ...::: The full game :::...

The full game will contain loads of new and improved shit! There'll be a
whole bunch of fancy levels, many worlds (not only Mars and AliensLair),
more muzac ("music" that is) and much much (do you now how stupid that word
sounds in pure swedish? - muusch) more!   There are some plans of creating
a twoplayer-mode as in GravityForce. If that is, there'll CERTAINLY be a
posibillity of including your own levels (ILBM-pictures with an extra data-
file). We are working on it [-8   But probably, instead of including the 
two player option, we'll create a pure gravity-game in a close future. 
There are allmost NO options included at the titlescreen, but there will be! 
At the moment, you can only do some sound changes. An intro will also be
added!

The one and ONLY way of knowing more about the game is to call our BBS on
(+46)0430-70573. P L E A S E  call and tell us what the hell you think of
this game; is it worth continue developing? et.c..   The SECOND and only way
of getting in touch with us is to send an e-mail to me (Mopz).
