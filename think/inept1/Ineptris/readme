The making of Ineptris has been great fun, but also a real pain in the ass sometimes.
We hope you like what we made.

Feature list:
- 3D rendered graphics in hires 256 colors.
- High quality sound f/x...hmmm
- The special >INEPT MODE< that gives the game it's atmosphere.
- No multitasking.
- A great AGA tetris.
