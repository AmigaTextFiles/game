Somewhere in Aug '95
V 0.5: - Initial Release

Somewhere in Aug '95 + 1
V 0.6: - Put Graphics in Chipmem so it will run without Graphics Card (oops!)

31.8.95
V 0.7: - Fixed WindowMinSize
       - Filerequester now saves last directory
       - Impemented original card's Background Logo
       - an fclose() was missing in read_file (UNIX seems not to care about
         that, but AmigaOS does!) Now you can save in files you read 
         before.
3.9.95
V 0.8: - Filerequester now saves last filename+pattern, too ;-)
       - Added famous Icon by Steeler (thanks, man!)
