TECHNOBAN 4.07 Notes 
--------------------

In this package TECHNOBAN is executed via XIcon, but it HAS Workbench-Startup
code. The only reason for using a batchfile here was the need of assigning 
FONTS: to the TECHNOBAN fonts dir. Another reason is that TECHNOBAN seeks 
alll files in current dir, so TECHNOBAN cannot find his files if placed in
subdirectory. The assign of a diskname to TECHNOBAN`s dir will avoid that.

If you make a self-running disk with all files in the rootdir you do not
need that batchfile. 

Here some of the great features of TECHNOBAN:
-4 world with 10 levels each
-new graphics and sounds every world
-32 colors
-5 stereo sounds
-ability to take back a 65535 moves (right mousebutton!)
-smooth animation
-works even under 1.2 on 512k-machines
-integrated editor
-a code for each level

If you have any comments, suggestions or new levels or you simply want to
