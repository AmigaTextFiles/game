             The object of Tangram Master is to fill in the outlined
             pictures with the seven puzzle pieces you are allowed to
             use. You will have two large triangles, one medium
             triangle, two small triangles, one square and one
             parallelogram. To look at the pieces and their rotations
             click on the SelectOmatic's buttons. When you are ready
             to use a piece move the pointer over to the outlined
             picture. When you have the piece where you want to place
             it click the left mouse button.
             If you think you have made a mistake you can put the
             piece back by clicking on it with the left mouse button.
             Once you select another piece all previous moves are
             final and can not be changed. Sometimes part of a shape
             may be left across a line when you put a piece back.
             If this happens click the right button to clean things
             up. Only the left button can put a piece back so only
             use the right button for clean up!
