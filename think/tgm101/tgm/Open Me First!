               * Tangram Master is SHAREWARE so if you have fun
                 playing the game please send $10.00 US Funds to
                 receive Tangram Master Volume Two which contains
                 all new puzzles.
             
                 Tangram Master requires at least 1 meg total
                 memory. (This does not mean 1 meg chip ram!)
                 2.0 or higher is required. 3.0 is best!
                 I would like to know if it works with 3.1. 
                  
                ***************************************************
                 
                 Drag the Tangram Master drawer on to a blank
                 formatted disk. The disk needs to be in drive DF0
                 for the installer to work.
                 Once you have installed the fonts and libraries on
                 your Workbench it shouldn't matter where the game
                 is played from.
