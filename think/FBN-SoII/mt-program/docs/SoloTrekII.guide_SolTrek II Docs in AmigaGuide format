                                Introduction

The situation is becoming desperate.  The Dominion threat that precipitated
the Klingon Empire breaking the treaty with the Federation has continued to
put a strain on diplomatic relations.

The Maquis' theft of the industrial replicators resulted in yet another
splinter in the fragile peace.  Ferengi opportunists have been quick to
take advantage of any seeming weakness.

Three days ago, the Romulan empire crossed the Neutral Zone and proceeded
to attack any ship that came within weapons range.  At almost the same
time, several Borg vessels appeared in the Alpha quadrant.

The galaxy is now aflame with war.  The Federation, Klingons, Romulans,
Ferengi and Cardassians have quickly drawn lines and begun defending their
`territorial rights'.

That is how the galaxy stands when your ship is commissioned.  Your mission
is simple: Map the entire galaxy.  Why?  Because we told you to.

                            Hard Drive Installation

FBN has made an install script that uses the Commodore Installer program.
Just run the install program and follow the onscreen instructions.  The
necessary libraries and fonts will be installed and the program copied.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "StartUp"
@NEXT "Solo"
@PREV "HD Install"
@TOC "Main"

                                   StartUp

If you are playing from floppy, just put the "MT-Program" disk into your
boot drive and reboot.

If you are playing from hard drive, double click on the "SoloTrekII" icon.

Once the program has loaded, it will check your system memory.  You will
need at least 1Meg CHIP and 1Meg FAST to play the game.  If you have less
than 1Meg CHIP free when the game loads, it will close Workbench and you
will be unable to Iconify the program.  (Sorry, but jamming this much sound
and graphics into an ECS machine really stretches the Amiga's limits.)

Next, you will be presented with a scroller containing information about
the program.

The following screen will test your system for various items, including
CPU, memory, chipset, etc.

After that, the sound and graphics will be loaded.  If you have enough CHIP
memory, you will get the + symbol after your sound and graphics notices.
The + indicates that the program is using the large files.  This means
better sound effects and some animation.

The screen is divided into four sections (more on that later).  For right
now, you are only concerned with the lower right corner.  It is a window
surrounded by seven buttons.  They are (clockwise from lower left):

T        - This button is not active until a game mode has been selected.
G        - Until a game mode has been selected, this button is inactive.
CLOSE    - This button ends the game immediately.
HAIL     - Shaded out in SoloTrek II.
ICONIFY  - If you have enough CHIP memory, this button will flip to the
           Workbench screen.  To return to SoloTrek II, close the ModemTrek
           label.
COMPUTER - Pressing this button will begin a SOLO game
PHONE    - Shaded out in SoloTrek II.

A Comm window will open to allow you to enter some information.  You will
be asked for your name, your ship's name, your race and the level of
difficulty to be used.  Then the game begins.

As mentioned above, the main screen is divided into four sections.
Proceeding from the top left, in a clockwise fashion, they are:
Systems, Viewscreen, Data Terminal, Controls.

@NEXT "Viewscreen"
@PREV "Control"
@TOC "Main"

                                    System

This section consists of four main elements.  The five buttons on the left
control the status of your five main systems: Shields, Impulse Engines,
Warp Drive, Phasers, Photon Torpedos.  They are toggle switches.  Green
indicates active, red indicates inactive.

To the right of the buttons are five gauges.  Each system can hold a
maximum of 1000.  These bars indicate, through size and colour, how much
energy is in each system.

To the right of the bars is a large window.  It is your Sector Analyzer.
It will show: planets, asteroids, comets, nebulae, starbases.  This display
will not change if you switch to Tactical display.

Below the Sector Analyzer is a small status light.  It will light up while
repairs are being done.

@NEXT "Terminal"
@PREV "System"
@TOC "Main"

                                  Viewscreen

There are no buttons associated with the Viewscreen.  It will show either
the same information as the Sector Analyzer (General Mode) or ships in the
sector (Tactical Mode).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Terminal"
@NEXT "Controls"
@PREV "Viewscreen"
@TOC "Main"

                                Data Terminal

The Data Terminal gives you information on the sector you are in, enemy
ships, special locations and other data.  The T button switches the Data
Terminal and Viewscreen to Tactical Mode.  The G button switches the Data
Terminal and Viewscreen to General Mode.

The Close button ends the game immediately (unless you are currently
LINKed) without saving your score.

The HAIL button (inactive in a SOLO game) will open a Hail window to the
remote player.  ESC closes the Hail window.

The Iconify button (inactive if Workbench has been closed) will pause the
program and return you to Workbench.  A Label with a Close button and a
Depth button will appear at the top of the Workbench.  To return to
ModemTrek, close the Label.

The COMPUTER button will display how many sectors you have mapped and your
score.

The PHONE button is inactive during game play.

                                   Controls

Most of your mouse work will be in this section of the screen.  Across the
top of this section are nine buttons.

Power - This button will bring up a Comm screen to let you transfer energy
from one section to another.  ESC will exit without doing anything.

Asteroids - This button will attempt to tap energy from asteroids (if there
are any in the sector).

Comet - Attempt to capture a comet for energy.  It will only operate if
there is a comet in the sector.

Nebula - If there is a nebula in the sector, the ship will attempt to sweep
the nebula for energy.

Planet - If there is a planet in the sector, this will attempt to assemble
an away team and beam down.  If the planet is your Homeworld, any repairs
needed will be completed and you will be offered energy from a pool on the
planet.

Starbase - You will dock with a Starbase (if any) and be offered several
options.  If your Engineer is not up to Captain level, you will be offered
a chance to train him.  Here you can also gain crew, torpedos and energy.
If any systems need repairs, you may be offered free repairs.

Repair - If a system needs repairs, clicking this button will open a Comm
screen for you to select what to repair.  If your Repair Status light is
lit, clicking this button will continue repairs.

Stop Repairs - If a more important system is damaged, you can cancel any
current repairs to allow you to specify a new system to repair.

Repair Status - This button will tell you how long until repairs are
completed.

At the top right of this section is the Navigation Cluster.  The arrows
move (impulse) one sector in the indicated direction.  The Warp Symbol will
allow you to warp directly to any sector.

Below the top row of buttons, at the left, is the Weapons Cluster.  Here
you may turn on or off Red Alert.  You may also fire Phasers.  The Photon
button with Question Marks (the left one) will allow you to configure a
torpedo.  The right Photon button will fire a torpedo at the current yield.

Below the Weapons Cluster is a row of nine indicator lights.  If the light
is green, the system is fine.  If the light is red, the system must be
repaired.  The lights are:

B - Power indicator bars
T - Data Terminal
A - Sector Analyzer
V - Viewscreen
E - Engines (both Impulse AND Warp)
W - Weapons (both Phasers AND Photons)
S - Shields
P - Main Power (needed for most functions)
L - Life Support (without it, your crew starts dying)

The lower right of the section contains your race insignia.  If your race
has cloaking ability, this button activates it.

The DESTRUCT button activates self destruct.  You may abort self destruct
by pressing a key before the countdown runs out.

The REPAIR box indicates the level of expertise of your Engineer.  The
higher his level, the faster he can effect repairs.

The CREW box is the number of crew on board your vessel.

The PHOTONS box is the total number of photon torpedos on board.

                        C. Edward Stewart Notes

SoloTrek II represents about eight months of work (on and off).  I learned a
lot while making it.  From the time you could first fly around the galaxy,
people have been playing it.  As systems were developed, the game got more
and more addictive.  Some days, I'd get very little programming done
because people were on my computer, playing SoloTrek II.

It's been a long, hard struggle to get this beast out of my computer and
into yours.  I hope you get as much enjoyment out of it as I do.

And let me know if you ever beat level six.
