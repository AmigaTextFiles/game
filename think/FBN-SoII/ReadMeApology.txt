Due to the administration at AmiNet, this archive is in LHA format.
Now, you and I both know that this means a lot of extra work for you, the
user.  I apologize for the extra work this is causing
you.

To get the game to work, you will have to make the two disks yourself.

Disk One (MT-Program) is contained in the MT-Program drawer.  Copy all the
files from the drawer onto a disk.  Rename the disk MT-Program and install
it (make it bootable).

Disk Two (MT-Data) is contained in the MT-Data drawer.  Copy all the files
from the drawer to a second blank, formatted disk.  Rename the disk
MT-Data.  It does not need to be installed.

If you are going to run the game from floppy, you are done.  If you are
going to run the game from your hard drive, put in MT-Program and double
click on the Install program.
