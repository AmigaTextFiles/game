	First, the ususal suspects...

INTERFERON
	... is a game, basically a variation on Tetris, but you must match
	up colors to destroy the "bugs" on the screen.  It uses 16 colors
	and has sounds, but is still pretty fast (at least for me).  All this
	in a mere 88K, plus or minus 200K of chip.  The price for all this?
	
		$0.  

	The reason it is so cheap (and really, you can't get must cheaper!) is
	that Interferon is "CardWare", or "QSLWare".  The way this works is
	that if you found Interferon interesting or entertaining, just send
	me a postcard of your city or whatever amuses you.  I would enjoy
	seeing how far a program can spread around the country rather just
	getting a check from those few who would pay for a game.


INSTALLATION
	Nothing special.  Use the CLI or WorkBench to copy things where you
	want them.


	Enjoy!
