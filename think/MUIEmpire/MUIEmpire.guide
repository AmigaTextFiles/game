Hello, Welcome to a new galactic conquest game for the Amiga line of
computers.

You must have @{"MUI" link "MUI" 0} installed, either the registered version or the PD version
>2.3. The version of MUIMaster.library should be atleast 10.33. It may work
with a earlier @{"MUI" link "MUI" 0} version but I haven't tested it. Also you need OS2.04 or
greater. You need to have that even to run @{"MUI" link "MUI" 0}.

This is really a GAMA version of the program. I have to warn you not to run
any other program while running this program due to its early stage of
developement. You should need tons of memory for this program, if you can't
run it, then tell me how much memory you have. The smallest memory I have run
it in is 6MB (I don't have access to a machine with less memory). One person
is running the game without a hard drive.

You are a new leader on your planet and you have just finished putting your
planet under your rule and killing off any potential rivals. You have started
looking towards other planets and you see how weak they are. Your mission is
to build the greatest empire ever known. You will crush all enemys and tax
them too death to fund your conquest effort. You will be up against other so
called aggressors that you will need to crush. You can build all the fleets
that you can afford. You can even design your own ships if the predesigned
ships don't suit you. Don't forget to fuel your fleets before you send them
off and give them troops to help in the land combat. Space mines will slow
your enemies down if they are properly postioned.
@endnode

@node "HISTORY_1" "History"
 DATE: 6/1/95
 BUG-fixed tax bug where it was not updated if it was the first thing done.
 BUG-lockup bug during computer movement, but there is still another one

 present.
 BUG-add some error checking to make sure tags have valid addresses.
 ADDED-map is moved to show current planet.
 ADDED-edited the amigaguide file.
 ADDED-working on Envoy version, should be released soon once the services
 library is finished.

 DATE: 5/20/95
 ADDED- IceBBS version.
 BUG-fixed memory deallocation bug.
 BUG-fixed computer fleets joining bug
 BUG-many numerous small bugs fixed


 DATE: 3/17/95
 BUG-fixed many bugs included the newfleet bug when you selected the entire
 fleet.

 ADDED-automatic trading. You can now set a fleet to trade between two
 planets. You just pick the item it should buy at each planet and the amount
 of items to buy. This is a max limit, if the fleet does not have enough
 credits then it will only buy how many credits worth that are available.
 Computer players also have automatic trading. They will be generator income
 from this as soon as they have two planets. The fleetlist display will
update
 showing that the course is set, you will not need to fuel or plot the course
 for the fleet. All trades will be noted in the player's message window. A
 fleet will not move if not enough fuel is available.

 ADDED-Enhanced and fixed several bugs in the computer AI. The computer is
 smarter and faster. They don't get any special advantages over the players.
 They play by the same rules.

 CHANGED- Max movement is now 10 sectors per turn.
 CHANGED- initial credits for player (including computer) is 1100 (a 1000
more
 than normal planets.
 CHANGED- fuel production is now 100 units per turn for players.
 CHANGED- items that can be bought are limited by the tech of the planet.
 Better check to see if an item can be bought from a planet before assigning
 that item to a fleet that is set for automatic trading.

 DATE: 2/22/95
 BUG-fixed bug when computer planets tried to puchase troops or space mines.

 BUG-fixed bug that creeped into combat. When multiple fleets were in the
 same sector, multiple attacks were not accumulated. They are now.

 DATE: 2/16/95
 ADDED: You can now send messages to multiple players by just secting them.

 DATE: 12/11/94

 ADDED-HyperTransfers. Allows the transfer of cargo to any sector. Buy the
 hyper gate and leave it on the planet surface. It will then transfer power
 to the sector and from their you can transfer items to any other sector. It
 takes too much power to actually transfer ships at this point. Also since
 the power is so great, in will only work from a sector with a planet, but it
 will send items to any sector.

 BUG-fixed the tech bug where it wouldn't let you buy high tech items until
 the following turn.

 BUG-fixed a wild pointer bug when creating a new fleet when the old fleet
 had a course plotted and was eliminated.

 DATE: 12/10/94

 ADDED-the ability to change the ship class names. There is still a bug in
 this that it display a wierd character of ships loaded from a file.
 Harmless.

 ADDED-the ability to join fleets in the same sector. Use the fleet page and
 select all the fleets in the same sector and hit the join button. Bug, the
 sector page is not updated if you are joinging ships in the same sector as
 the sector page is showing.

 ADDED-you can now select the fleet to view from the fleet page.

 ADDED-position is kept on the purchasing list when switching planets.

 BUGS-several and still more on the list.

 DATE: 11/30/94

 ADDED-changed the tax rate and population growth. Both should be faster now.

 BUG-introduced a bug into the save/load game routines when I added more
 messages output a few versions agao. Fixed but there are still plenty of
 bugs present, for instances if you try to load a game several times. This 
 is most likely when the game is releasing memory from the old game and

 aquiring new memory for the loaded game.

 BUG-computer planets were not allowed to collect taxes. Now they can.

 BUG-computer planets purchase of troops was missed up. Should be fixed.

 BUG-computer planets raising their own tech could drive their credits
 negative. Now fixed.

 ADDED-fleets are only joined when trying to take over a planet instead over
 joining all fleets orbiting every planet.

 DATE: 11/28/94

 BUG-fixed the refinery problem. It was a define file was not updated for all
 the object files. Also refienry and techs cost was not subtracted and that
 is corrected. Also technology is the limit for a planet.

 ADDED-fuel fleet button. It transfers the fuel needed to make the trip to
 the current planet. You can hit the button twice if you want fuel for a
 round trip. It will notify you if you don't have the fuel needed for the
 trip.

 BUG-fixed divide by zero bug when tax rate was set to 0.

 BUG-fixed the lack of updating the fuel needed when switching fleets.


 DATE: 11/22/94

 BUG-enforcer hit when a computer planet was taken over by a player. fixed

 BUG-clear message button cleared all players messages. fixed


 NEW-computer AI. Right now there are five different computer defensive
 strategies.

 1) no defense = cash cow

 2) troop defense = all the money is spent on troops

 3) fighter defense = all the money is spent on fighters.

 4) general defense = money is spent on all ship types and troops

 5) Mine Defense = planet buys mines instead of ships. I have not done
 offensive strategies yet. I will have things like revengeful planets.

 Planet will buy ships only if their tech is high enough. They can increase
 their tech to buy the ships.

 Their was a bug in the former routine that limited planets in purchasing
 only fighters. They should have been able to buy dreadnoughts if their tech
 allowed, now it is fixed.

 -fixed the bug that allowed you to buy ships or items after purchase of an
 item or ship even if you didn't have enough money.


 DATE: 11/21/94

 -changing code to allow for network and BBS play

 -added save/load game feature

 -fixed when hitting in the background of the map, it changed the planet
 display

 -fixed when you select partial fleet for the first time, it only gave you
 one ship.

 -made more space between planets. Allows easier reading of planet names.

 -added more feedback in the message window. It will print the turn, how many
 ships the eneymy lost and how many ships you lost. It will also show how
 many troops the enemy lost.

 -cleaned up the code for the fleet to fleet battles.

 BUGS currently known. -found a few bugs and still some current bugs. Map not
 updated after name change. You can still purchase items for more money than
 you have, when you purchase a ship. I have to check into the troop battles.
 It may not be too fair.

 DATE: 10/31/94

 -fixed a bug I introduced in yesterdays version.

 -added refineries to the purchase list. This will increase the fuel
 production of the planet.



 DATE: 10/30/94

 -finshed the code for sending other players messages

 -fixed enforcer hit in galaxy map

 -change the gui a little


 DATE: 10/24/94

 -fixed a major memory bug (With the help of Harald Fricke). In the maintain
 fleet function.

 -added the ability to load in extra predefined ships that are available to
 all players. Read the purchase information with the appropiate button.

 -added the send message to other players but not activated yet. I am still
 not sure about the GUI part of it.



 DATE: 10/21/94

 -fixed a pointer bug with ship types. Should allow some people to run the
  program.

 -really fixed some bugs that I created in the last version.

 -transfer item bug should be killed now. It is really error checked now.

 -troop losses will be reported correctly.

 Known BUGS -still need to fix a bug in the new fleet where the first time
 you hit it one ship is transfered.

 -for some reason the main planet list deselects owned planets if the list
 cursor is placed on top of it.


 DATE: 10/19/94

 -Still cleaning up the code, and killing little bugs.

 -Now should be able to use the tab key to cycle through most of the gadgets.

 -You will now get a message about troop losses in battles for planets.

 -Still working on save/load code.

 DATE: 10/12/94

 -just a a code change. The program is crashing on someone at the start of
 the game and this will help me solve his problem. Therefor not a useful
 update for the rest of you.



 DATE: 10/12/94

 -Added the ability to improve a planets technology. Just purchase technology
 from the purchase window. You need a high technology to puchase certain ship
 types.

 -simplied the code for transfering goods between planets,sectors, and fleets


 DATE: 10/11/94

 -fixed transfer too much bug?

 -computer planets can only buy ships depending upon the worlds technology.
 Although all planets can buy fighters.

 -I need to know how the program is working with its current values. Too much
 fuel? Too little or too much credits? The planets too tuff? etc. How is the
 interface?

 -Right now technology limits what ships you can buy on planets. I will
 eventually let planets tech be increased.

 -really fixed copying planet lock bug. It occured when items where placed
 into sectors that were not mines.

 -still working on the save/load feature. It is complicated because of the
 variable data structures.


 DATE: 10/10/94

 -may have squelched the copy planet lock up bug

 -reduced the starting fleets to allow players to conquer other planets


 DATE: 10/7/94  

 -found some code that returned memory to the system that it never obtained

 -currently working on save/load game


 DATE: 10/6/94

 -Now able to delete players in the configuration window.

 -Worked on the map, now able to see friendly or enemy fleets when
  appropiate. The graphics will get better when I get the graphics
  from the artist.


 DATE 10/3/94

 Hello, Beta Testers:

 You must have MUI installed, either the registered version or the PD version
 >2.2. It may work with earlier MUI version but I haven't tested it. Also you
 need OS2.04 or greater. You need to have that even to run MUI.

 This is really a GAMA version of the program. I have to warn you not to run
 any other program while running this program due to its early stage of
 developement. You should need tons of memory for this program, if you can't
 run it, then tell me how much memory you have. The smallest memory I have
 run it in is 6MB (I don't have access to a machine with less memory). You
 need also at least two players for the game, or one player playing two game
 players. I haven't checked for only one player yet. One will be able to play
 the game by himself when the game matures. You can have as many players as
 you want and as many planets as you like but if it fails tell me how many
 players/planets you had and the memory it was running in.


 FIXED:

 1) reset movement between turns (fleets would only move until their movement
 ran out ;) oops. 

 2) should deallocate all memory upon quiting.

 3) Selecting planet in the main list would change the from gadget in the
 movement window, corrected. 

 4) planets will rearm themselves, buy troops first then ships.

 5) planets will revolt if too much taxes and not enough troops present.
    Any fleets present will become owned by the planet.
     6) Fixed overloading the cargo of fleets.

 7) other minor fixes, the game should be semiplayable now.

@node "CONFIGURATION" "Configuration  Window"
  The number of planets that will be used in the game is set here. The The
number of planets chosen is only limited by the amount of memory your system
has. The more players you have will increase the amount of memory the planets
will require. The number of players are also added or removed in this window.
You can also load a saved game at this point.

This window is only available when the game is first loaded. This window is
not seen by the IceBBS version or the Envoy Version.
@endnode

@node "EMPIREWINDOW" "Empire Control Window"


The empire control window is the main window of the program. It is where you
will control your empire and defeat other empires. This is where you can get
@{"planet" link "PLANETPAGE" 0}, @{"sector" link "SECTORPAGE" 0}, @{"fleet" link "FLEETPAGE" 0}, @{"player" link "PLAYERPAGE" 0} information on the various pages.
@endnode

@node "MAPWINDOW" "Empire Map     Window"


This window shows the current galaxy map with the planets including the names
you know them as. Other players will know them by different names. To select
information about a sector or planet just click on that sector. In the
@{"MainWindow" link "EMPIREWINDOW" 0}, you can look at the @{"planet page" link "PLANETPAGE" 0} for planet information or the
@{"sector page" link "SECTORPAGE" 0} for fleet information.

Now you should be able to see friendly, foreign, or objects in a sector. A
mark in the upper left corner of a sector represents friendly fleets. A mark
in the lower left corner represents enemy fleets.  A mark in the upper right
corner of a sector represents objects in the sector. These objects may be
mines and you should be carefull. You will only get information if you either
have a fleet or own a planet in that sector otherwise you will not see
anything.

Planets with blue in them represent planets that you own. Planets with grey
represent are either owned by no one or are unknown. Planets with black are
owned by the enemy.
@endnode

@node "FLEETWINDOW" "Fleet Control  Window"




This is where you can control all your fleets. A fleet will be shown in the
window broken down into individual ship types. You can cycle through your
fleets by hitting the <next fleet> or <last fleet> buttons. 



@{b}FREIGHT:@{ub} If you want to add freight to a fleet hit the <freight> button. It
will allow you to move items to the fleet from the sector and back to the
sector. Don't forget to add fuel to the fleet or it will not be able to move.

@{b}FUEL FLEET:@{ub} There is now a button that will automatically fuel the fleet to
the destination shown. If you hit it twice, then it will load enough fuel for
a round trip. It will tell you if you don't have enough space on the fleet or
that there is not enough fuel for the journey.

@{b}COURSE:@{ub} You can either plot a course manually or have the computer plot you a
course. The computer will plot a straight line to the sector. You can either
select the planet in the list or dial in the sector with the sliders. Now you
can hit the button <plot course> and the computer will plot you a course. You
can also manually plot a course user the mouse or the keypad. This will allow
you greater control of where you fleet is moving to. The <clear course> button
will eliminate a course plotted out and allow you to plot a new course. A
plotted course will not actually allow the fleet to move without fuel.

@{b}AUTOMATIC TRADE:@{ub} You can now have fleets setup for trading. All you have to do
is pick what item to buy at one planet and what item to buy at the second
planet. Also you may pick the limit to the number of items to buy at either
planet. You then hit the <apply trade> button to give the orders to the fleet.
The fuel will be automatically loaded to make the journey to the planet. Then
the fleet will automatically buy the item up to the limit you set or when
credits run out or when cargo space runs out. Once it gets to the opposite
planet, the fleet will sell the item and buy the second item and go back.
Rememeber, you should try to buy low and sell high also check to make sure
that item is available on the planet. Not all items are available due to
technology limitations of the planet. Once a fleet is setup for trade, its
display will be updated in the fleet page in the main window to indicate the
next planet. Don't worry that the range is still zero because fuel has not
been loaded yet. Also you will get messages in the message window about any
transactions that may have occurred. A fleet will not move if there is not
enough fuel on the planet for the journey.

@{b}SELL SHIP:@{ub} You may now sell ships. You can select one or several for selling.
The credits for the sale will end up in the sector. You may only sell ships on
planets you own.

@{b}NEW FLEET:@{ub} You can separate a fleet in this window. Using the mouse, you can
highlight the ships you want in the new fleet. Hit the <new fleet> button to
shift them into a newly created fleet. This is useful if you want to send
ships to multiple locations. At the end of a turn all fleets located at
planets are combined into one fleet. Fleets currently on route through a
sector will not be combined with fleets in the same sector. Therefor if you
want to combine fleets, you will need to send them to the same planet. Having
mulitple fleets in the same sector will not harm you, they will fight as if
one fleet. @endnode
@endnode

@node "PURCHASINGWINDOW" "Purchasing     Window"


This is the window where you can buy all the items to run your empire. Most of
the items are available are just used for trade. Remember, always buy low and
sell high. Right now the prices are different for each planet and they remain
static. I will eventually have random price fuctuations incorporated into the
game. But there are also special items that can be bought and used for a
specific purpose.


    @{b}Premade Ships:@{ub} There are six default ship classes available for purchase
to every empire. You can design your own custom ship class by selecting the
Design Ship button. You can also create a text file named "MUIEmpire.ships".
Put this file into the same directory where MUIEmpire is located. The format
of the file is as follows:

                Name of class <- limited to 25 characters
                attack        <- range from 1 to 100
                defense       <- range from 1 to 100
                speed         <- range from 1 to 100
                cargo         <- range from 1 to 10
                fuel          <= range from 10 to 1

                two example ships:
                Super Destroyer
                100
                30
                20
                10
                5
                Super Dreadnought
                100
                100
                20
                50
                5

    These premade ships are available to all human players. It just gives the
players a greater choice of ships in the beginning of the game. Unlike custom
ships, the players do not have to pay for the design of these ships.

    @{b}Space Mines:@{ub} space mines are very dangerous and to be used with caution.
They come in four sizes and cost differently for each planet. A class II mine
has enough power to eliminate a dreadnought. A class IV mine has the power to
eliminate any type of ship that can be currently designed. They way mines work
is the following. First you must buy the mine. It will then be in your
planet's inventory. As long as the mine is in the planet's inventory, it is
harmless. To activate a mine, you transfer it to a sector. The following round
the mine will be activated and will explode on any passing fleet. Normally,
within the same turn as buying the mine, you would transfer it to a fleet. The
fleet then can transport it to a sector where it can be dropped off and
activated. One mine will explode on one randomly chosen ship. The mine will be
destroyed and the ship will only be destroyed if the mine is strong enough.
You can put any number and class of mines in the same sector. It is basically
one miner/ship. Either all the mines are eliminated or the ships are
eliminated. The mines will explode on friendly fleets so be carefull.

    @{b}Troops:@{ub} right now there is only one class of troops. They are used to
defend your planet from any ground based attacks. They are also used to mount
a ground based assault on an enemy planet. The more troops you have versus
your opponent, the better your chance is to win. To defend your planet with
troops, just leave them in your planets inventory.
    Fleets can also carry troops to enemy planets.

    @{b}Technology:@{ub} Right now all player planets start with a technology of 50 out
of 100. The planets technology limits what kind of ship can be built on a
planet. A technology of 50 will allow you to build the basic ship classes. If
you design a ship that requires a technolgy greater then 50, then you must
invest in the planets technology which can be bought in the purchase window.
Ship technology is based on the attack or defensive capabilities of a ship,
and which ever is greater. A ship with an attack of 75 and a defense of 25
would need a technology of 75 to be built. A ship with a defensive capability
of 80 and an attack of 40 would need a technology of 80 to be built.

    @{b}Offensive and Defensive enhancements to fleets:@{ub} Ships have a natural
defense consisting of armor but you can increase the defense by adding shield
generators to a fleets cargo. For example, 20 points of shield energy will add
2 points additional defensive points to 10 ships or 5 points to 4 ships. You
can also buy high energy lasers or various torpedoes to help the offensive
capability of the fleets. These items are never lost but can recovered from a
destroyed fleet.

    @{b}Refineries:@{ub} Buying refineries will increase the fuel production for each
planet. Fleets need fuel to move from sector to sector.

    @{b}Hyper Gate:@{ub} This is a new and improved way to transfer cargo around the
galaxy. You add it to your planets inventory and it will enable you to send
items to any sector in the galaxy without consideration for fuel. You can not
send ships this way but you can send mines and have them activated.
@endnode

@node "INVENTORYWINDOW" "Inventory      Window"



The planets inventory window is where things are stored after just being
bought. This is also the window where you are able to sell items back to the
planet for maybe a profit. You will also would want to station troops here to
defend your planet from a land base invasion. You are also able to put items
into orbit around your planet by transfering items to the sector. Once in the
sector, the items could become activated or picked up by a fleet in the
sector, whether friendly or foreign.
@endnode

@node "PLANETPAGE" "planet page"




Towards the left of the window you will find a galaxy map. To see all the
planets that you control you can hit the buttons <Next Planet> or <Last
Planet> to move to the next owned planet. The planet information display will
be highlighted to show information about the current planet.

The planet information display will show the planets name as you currently
know it. Each player will know the planets by a completely different name. You
may change this name at anytime if you so desired. The information below the
planets name will be only current with the last time you visited the planet.
It will show nothing if you have never been to the planet or it will show what
empire currently owns the planet, what is the population and technology of the
planet and what is the tax rate for that planet. 

You can set different tax rates for each planet you own. Tax rates between 20
to 30 is safe for any planet. The population will still increase and a chance
of a planet revolting will be low. Tax rates above 40 will most likely cause a
decrease in population due to the people having to pay taxes rather then spend
the money on new families. Tax rates above 60 could lead to a planet
revolting. If a planet revolts, you will lose ownership of that planet and
ownership of any surrounding fleets. You will ofcourse have to fight the fleet
that just revolted inorder to regain the planet. To stifle a planet from
revolting under high taxes, you may put troops on the planet. The more troops,
the less likely that the planet will revolt.

The planets technology only has bearing on what ships can be built on the
planet. A technolgy of 50 will allow planets to make the basic ship classes
provided with the game. All the player's planets start off with a technology
of 50. Computer planets technology is random and affects what ships they can
buy also. The computer planets will be trying to improve their technology if
it fits their strategy.

The planet's population shows how many people are on the planet. More people
will mean more taxes. Player's planets start off with a population of 1000.
each 1 in population means 10,000 people. When troops are bought, they are
taken from the current population which reduces its tax base.

@node "SECTORPAGE" "sector page"





This page on the empire window is where you can get fleet information in a
sector. You will only get information if you have a fleet or planet in the
current sector. You can either click on a sector in the map or dial in the
sector using the sliders. If you click on a fleet in the listview, it will
show you the makeup of the fleet. This is where you can find out if an
opposing player has built custom ships. The name of the custom ship will be
displayed but you will not find any information about that ship. After all, it
is a empire's secret. The window will also show the overall combat strength of
the fleet including offensive and defensive capabilities. But this combat
stength will not reflect any added offensive and deffensive equipment that the
fleet has like plasma torpedoes.
@endnode

@node "FLEETPAGE" "Document_4"




This window shows all your current fleets and where they are located. It shows
their cargo capacity, offensive abilities, defense abilities and the fleets
range if it has fuel on board and where it they are moving too. You can join
individual fleets if they are in the same sector. Fleets are automatically
combined only when a fleet is attacking a planet.
@endnode

@node "PLAYERPAGE" "Document_5"





This is where you can see messages about the previous game turn and how
successful you were. It will list lost ships and planets and conquered
planets. It will also mention any ships destroyed by mines or survived a mine
hit.

You can also change your empire's name in this window. This is the name that
the rest of the players will know you as. You can change this name at anytime
and any number of times. This will most likley confuse other players.

What is also in this window is the ability to send other players messages. For
example, "I didn't like you taking my defenseless planet and I will wipe out
all your fleets now!". You also have the option of clearing the game messages
from the system, otherwise the messages will be saved from turn to turn.

@node "GAMEPLAY" "How to play the game"
To Play the Game:

Long time ago, before amigas and most of the present day computers, I sat down
to a game called Galactic Conquest on the TRS-80. It was a single person game
that allowed you to conquer other planets and fly aroung the galaxy with a
star trek theme. It was simple but cool. I though there should be something
like this for the amiga. A year ago I learned C and I thought I had the tools
to really make a great galaxy game. I didn't want to put limits such as galaxy
size and player number and ship types and I wanted also to include trade. I
created a basis for a game that should be the end all of galaxy games. It will
eventually include network and BBS play and you could even email the save
turns and play by mail if you would like. There won't be just one version of
this game but a continuing evolving process that will make it unbeatable. This
is the reason I have made this game. It would have been alot easier if I had
just said only 4 players and 26 planets but I wanted to go beyond that.
Anyway, how to play the game is below.


You will start out on a single planet with the ambition to conquer the
universe. You think your race and culture is better then anyone elses and you
plan to dominate them. Your planet is identical to the other players planets.
But they are just stupid and don't have the ambition to conquer a galaxy. You
want to snuff their existance and rule the galaxy.

You must raise income to build a planet conquering fleet. There are two ways
to do this. One is through taxation. But be carefull, if you tax too much, you
will cause a population decrease because people can no longer afford to have
children. And if your taxes are really high, you take the chance that the
planet may revolt against your imperialistic ways and take command of any
fleets in orbit around the planet. The second way is through trade. You should
try to buy low and sell high or you aren't going to go far in the galaxy
conquering business. Right now you can only trade between planets you own. You
will need to send fleets over to planets to conquer them so you can have free
trade. Don't forget to add fuel for the journey and you will need troops to
actually take the planet. You might also consider laying mines around your
planet to prevent other empires having a desire on your planets. Don't forget,
instead of using the five basic ship types, you can design your own ships. The
opposing player will have no idea what he is up against.

@node "IceBBS" "IceBBS"


To the sysop:

This game is beta. I am doing my best to kill all the bugs but you still must
realize it is beta.

To start the game you must set two tool types in the MainEmpireServer icon:

Mandatory tooltypes:

 Game=(Set to the saved game created by MUIEmpire)
 Time=(Set to the time inbetween turns)

Optional tooltypes:

 MaxPlayer=(Set to the maximum number of players allowed)

Game is the samed game that you are using. Thus should be set up by running
MUIEmpire, add the players and number of planets. This is the only point that
you can add players or planets. Keep the players names written down because
you must give these to the players for logging in. Once into the first turn
you can save the game under the name you want. There will be more than one
file created. A file is created for each player. But when you set the game=
tooltype, set it to the main file name without the extension.

Time is the amount of time between turns in minutes. The computer will then
force a turn. You should give enough time to allow the players to enter their
turns. You may want to play one turn per day and therefor you can set it to
the number of minutes in a day (1440). If you want to do the turns yourself,
currently there is not way to stop the computer from doing turns but you can
set it to a very high value to avoid the computer from doing a turn.

The MaxPlayer tooltype will now allow the game to automatically add players
until this number is reached. Then no more players can be added. This is
allows the sysop to limit the game size.


Once the MainEmpireServer is running it will accept several inputs into its
window:

 CTRL-C: quits the game
 CTRL-E: forces a turn resolution 
 CTRL-F: forces a save game.

Once you decide on a quit you will also need to do a CTRL-\ to close the
window since I eliminated the close window gadget.

And that is all you have to do. Eventually you will be able to run multiple
games on the same BBS but you should only run one at a time at this point.
@endnode

@node "LOGIN" "LOGIN"

    This is the login window for the IceBBS version and Envoy version of
MUIEmpire. The standalone MUIEmpire does not use this window.

    Put your player name in the Player String Gadget. Don't put your Empire
name but the name set up by the game maintainer.

    Put your password into the Password String Gadget. If your are logging
into the game for the first time, then this is where you set your password.
Don't forget it because you will then need to contact the game maintainer for
your password.

    The Game String Gadget plays no role at this point but in the future it
will allow the playing of multiple games on one system. You can leave this
blamk.

    The Envoy version allows setting of tool types to automatically set these
gadgets. It accepts the following tool types: name,game,password,host.

 name=[Insert your player name]
 password=[Insert your password]
 game=[Insert your game]
 host=[Insert the host of the game on your network]

The IceBBS version currently doesn't support this but may in the future.

@node "ENVOY" "Envoy"


Welcome to the Envoy version of MUIEmpire. This is a beta version just like
the rest of the game. You must do several things to play this game on an Envoy
Network.

  1) Choose which computer to run the MainEmpireServer.
  2) Make an Assign to Empire: 
  3) Put EnvoyEmpireServer in this drawer. 
  4) Add MUIEmpire.service to the Envoy Services.
  5) Set up a MUIEmpire saved game.


MainEmpireServer

    You @{b}must@{ub} set the two tool types,
    time=
    game=

    Time is the time inbetween turns. And the game is the saved game file
previously setup with MUIEmpire, check @{"IceBBS" link "IceBBS" 0} for more information on this.
This program @{b}must@{ub} be running before any connections. You can put this into
your wbstartup drawer with the proper tool types set.

     
     Install the MUIEmpire.service library into your envoy services. This is
only needed on the computer acting as a server. Also make an Assign Empire: to
the directory where you are going to have the EnvoyEmpireServer program. The
EnvoyEmpireClient program has several tool types. It has name=,game=,host= and
password=. Just set these and it will automatically fill in the string
gadgets. You must have the host= tooltype set. Now all you do is run the
client program and you are ready to play.
