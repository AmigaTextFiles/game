TetrisPro V1.5 (first update after 21 years!):

This game is written and compiled with AMOSPro2.00.
It is a homage to a well known Tetris game
for our beloved Amiga with some new features.
While playing, you will notice some nice pictures
(look for the first pictures...it`s me in 1998 and now!).

If you like this game and would like to show me your appreciation for
the development, then send me some Bitcoins! :)
