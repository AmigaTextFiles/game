@node Sprache

 If you like to play the game in english, then change 
 the tooltypes from "deutsch" to "english". Please dont 
 use the quotation mark.

 It shall be the last line, otherwise it does not work!

 Dont change the name of the programme, otherwise it want
 work proberly.

 If there is no tooltype, the language is german.

@endnode

@node Right

  Mahjong is FREEWARE

  Copying and distribution is free, as long as all archives
  are complete.

  It is however not permitted to make any changes to the programm
  or the other files.

@endnode


@node Sonstiges

  A few hints:


    AGA (PalHires 256 colors)
    20 differente background pics 
    10 differente musicmodules
    Systemfriendly (with left Amiga + m you change to workbench)

  As Mahjong runs in system, it is useful not to activate other
  programms in the background i.g. screenblanker.
  If you encouter problems, be sure to keep an eye on that matter.

  This can be, if you use a high Resolution Workbench with many
  Colours, and no Grafikcard.

  Mahjong takes about 1,6 MB chipram. Take care about that.
  If you really encouter ramproblems, try to start the game, 
  without the startup-sequence.

@node Install

    game, where ever you want. There is no assings needet.

    You even can play it from CD, but the highscores cannot saved.

@endnode


@node Regeln

  The game is better known under the name Shanghai.

  In this version are 20 different Boards, which are generatet from
  different tiles.
  These is called a dragon.

  Dragon 1 -  5 and 11 - 15 has four Stones of the same kind.
  Dragon 6 - 10 and 16 - 20 has six Stones of the same kind.

  You should now try to take all the Stones off, tiles by tiles.
  The rules are as following:

         1.) The stones must have the same symbol.

         2.) The stones must be free on one side. If the stone
             is surroundet by other stones, in the same hight, cannot removed.

         3.) These rules work in the horizont angel only.
             If a stone is upwards / downwards free, cannot removed.
  
  If a stone is removable, you can mark him, with a mouseklick.
  He becomes a X-cross. A second stone has to be found, exactly the same pic.
  Mark him too. With the left mousebutton you take them off, with the right
  mousebutton you can remove your marked. 

  The target is to remove all the stones, in a short period of time. The
  time is importend, and say the rank in the Hall of Fame.

  You can play with non timelimit. To get in the highscore, you have
  to get all the stones off.

  Each Dragon has its own highscore.

  If you have a move done, thats it. No undo :-)

  However, you can get exactly the same board again and again, till
  you find a solution or not.

@node Auswahl

     Here you chose your Dragons. On the left side (Dragon 1-5, left mouse,
     with the right mouse 11-15) you find all your Dragons with 
     four tiles.
     On the right side (Dragon 6-10 or 16- 20) with six tiles. This Dragons
     have more Stones, but it is not more difficult, becouse there are
     more tiles, with the same symbol.

     You can chose your Dragan with the left or the right mousebutton, 
     but whit different results. Each board has his own background pic.      

     With the Start-button you beginn the game :-)

     With the highscore-Button the Hall of Fame will be listet.
     With the left mouse, you change from one board to the other.     

@endnode

@node Spiel

      Three points are importent here.

      1.) As long as the computer doesnt give you a message, everything
          is fine. If its impossible to play further, you will get a 
          message, to tell you. It is not funny, to search and just find 
          out after minutes, that the game is over. 

      2.) There are two buttons, where you can stop the game. They are 
          indenticel. There is a requester which ask you, if you want 
          to play again (exactly the same Dragon again). If you selected
          NO you come back to the selection Screen.
          When you now select the same Dragon, the Stones was mixed new.

          If you went on STOP, and you want to go back, just push the
          rightmouse button or ESC. You can continue.          


      3.) To dissable the music, can stop it with F1. F2 will start the
          music.
