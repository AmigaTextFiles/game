 If you like to use the progy in english, then change 
 the tooltypes from "deutsch" to "english". Please dont 
 use the quotation mark.

 It shall be the last line, otherwise it does not work!

 Dont change the name of the programme, otherwise it want
 work proberly.

 If there is no tooltype, the language is german.

@node Right


  DragonEd is FREEWARE

  Copying and distribution is free, as long as all archives
  are complete.

  It is however not permitted to make any changes to the programm
  or the other files.


@endnode

@node Install

    If you woant save the Dragons, the volume must be writeabel.
    (A CD-Rom isn`t writeabel.)

    Also, copy the MahJong Drawer on your Harddisk.

@endnode

@node Olala

    Here you can replace every board. Its the place to make your
    own boards.:-) 

    There is a certian amount of tiles, which have to be used. You 
    have to use them all. 

    If you save your own board, the highscore will be deletet and a
    newone will be created. 

    You dont have to fear, that you do something wrong, in the worst
    case, the given board will be used as default.

    If anybody makes real good boards, dont hesitat to send them to
    me :-)
    Crunch the Dragon-drawer with lha and send them to me.

    If someone wants more then 20 boards, then just rename the drawer
    "Dragons". So you can define as many Dragons as you like. Sure you 
    have to create a drawer with the name "Dragons" and the boards
    inside.

    If you create the boards with DragonEd, a new drawer will be createt
    by the prg. 

    The boards will always be loadet from the drawer "Dragons", so make 
    sure, that this one is exists, and not empty, otherwise the default
    boards are loaded. 

@endnode


@node laden

   Simply press one of the 20 buttons, and the board will be loaded.
   If this is not possible, the default board will be loaded.
 
   When you start the Editor, board 1 is default.

@endnode
 
@node name

   As soon as you have a good board created, dont miss to give a 
   cool name to it, as long as 10 characters. Is also possibel this 
   way to rename a board. Start Dragon, rename, save... thats it.

@endnode

@node malen

   Thats the place to create your veryown boards :-)

   It is very simple, not much to do. On the right side you choose 
   one - four Stones to paint. 

   On the top you see how many tiles you have used already. Over the 
   painting Area you can see, how many tiles the Dragon have.
   If all Stones are used, no tile can be placed this time.

   If you  undo your paintings, you will get the tiles back. Clear?

   On the topright you will see, what the board will look like, This 
   way it is quite ease to see what´s going on. 

   With the grey button you can remove the tiles (also with the right
   mouse button).

   It is only possibel to save, if all of the tiles are used.

@endnode

@node clear

   With the clear button you clear the paintig Area complete.
   So you can create a total new Board.

@endnode

@node default

   This button load the default board.
   So you can produce the original condition.

@endnode

@node save

  If you are happy with the painting, the save here, dont miss to give
  a new name.
 
  The old highscore will be lost. 
 
@endnode


@node ende

  This button is useless, I dident find out what it is good for. 
  Anyhow, as soon as I find out, I will update the Guide. 

  Probably in one of the next Updates.
