********************
I.   Requirements
********************
LTris runs in X and uses SDL (any version though >= 1.1.4
is recommended) and SDL_mixer (optional for sound). Both libraries
can be found at http://libsdl.org. 

********************
II.  Installation
********************
Enter your favorite shell and type in the following stuff (in the
directory you extracted the LTris source)
> ./configure [--disable-sound] [--disable-install] 
              [--localstatedir=HIDIR]
    --disable-sound:       no sound
    --with-buffer-size:    modify audio buffer size (set this value
                           to 2048 if you encounter any sound delays)
    --disable-install:     no installation; play from source directory
    --localstatedir:       install global highscores to this directory
                           REPLACES --with-highscore-path TO COMPLY 
                           WITH AUTOCONF; THE DEFAULT LOCATION NOW 
                           DEPENDS ON YOUR DISTRIBUTION: PREVIOUSLY 
                           IT WAS /var/lib/games. USE
			   --localstatedir=/var/lib/games
			   FOR EXISTING HIGHSCORES.
> make
> su (become root)
> make install (if install wasn't disabled)
> exit (become user again)
> ltris (run game)

********************
III. Troubleshooting
********************
If you have SDL_mixer installed but configure tells you that it can't 
find it, remember that you have to install the development package
for compiling!
---
If you can't compile because LTris' timestamps are slightly in 
the future run 'touchall' (found in the configure directory).
---
If the SDL sound seems to be out of sync first try
to modify the audio buffer by using configure option 
--with-buffer-size (set to 2048). If this fails set
SDL_AUDIODRIVER to dma (export SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dma).
