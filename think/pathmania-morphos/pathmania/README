PathMania for Ludum Dare, december 2005 (Theme: Growth)

- About -

Arrows keys: Move
R: Restart level (doesn't work with random levels, sorry)
ESC: Escape

Unfortunately there are only four levels due to lack of time.

The game is fully playable, although it's not finished.  There should 
have been a lot more objects to interact with (powerups, bombs, etc), 
and more tile types that restrict or add movement rules (clockwise-turn 
only, etc), even more game types. Also lacking are animations, smoother 
movement, more game modes, etc.

The editor can load and save levels from/to the file "custom.level".  
You can also play custom levels from the editor (press P).

- License -

If you want to use any of this, send me an email. I haven't decided on 
a license yet, but it probably won't be a problem if you just ask first =)

- Future -

I will continue working on this game, although probably at a slower pace ;)
