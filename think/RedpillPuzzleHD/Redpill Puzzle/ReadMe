Redpill Puzzle Instructions:

-Blue Jewel: You control this jewel.
-Purple and Green Jewel: Bump these jewels to the exit and continue to the    next level. 
-Red Jewel: Its only purpose is to stand in your way! This jewel cannot be    putted so get rid of it however you can.
-It takes 2 or 3 bumps per jewel to solve the puzzle.

-If you touch any jewel that is against a wall, from a 90 degree angle, the   level will restart.
