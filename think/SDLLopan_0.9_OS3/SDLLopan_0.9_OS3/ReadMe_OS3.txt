This is a quick compile for OS3 of the SDL puzzle game 'Lopan' 
by author Dave Ashley.

Lopan URL: http://www.xdr.com/dash/sdllopan.html

Within the game, <ESCAPE> exits, and <RETURN> reshuffles the board.
The arrow keys work as undo/redo.

F1 switches the tilesets.
F2 switches the background.

All original source is in the src folder together with the original makefile,
named Makefile.orig. 

Lopan is released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, please read the
file 'GNU.txt' for more info. 

To compile the game for OS3, make sure you have your SDL environment setup 
properly and use the Makefile to compile (type 'make' in the src folder). 

HISTORY

v0.9 August 22nd 2008: Compiled for OS3 by Artur Jarosik.  
		    One issue (so far): exit the game pressing <ESC>.
	            If you click on the upper left button the game
		    might hang (it shouldn't but has done so once or
		    twice).
