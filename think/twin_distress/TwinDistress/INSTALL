Requirements for building Twin Distress:

SDL (required)
SDL_image (required)
SDL_mixer with Ogg Vorbis (optional for the sound & music)

When building the game, there are a few options you can change in the Makefile.
ONLY CHANGE THESE OPTIONS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

The default locations for the files used in the game are:

/usr/local/share/games/twind - for the image, sound & music files (DATA_PREFIX)
/usr/local/bin - for the twind program itself (BIN_PREFIX)
/var/lib/games/twind/twind.hscr - highscore file (HIGH_SCORE_PREFIX)
$HOME/.twind.opts - options remembered by the game (name, volume controls, etc)

If you don't have the privileges to install the game as root, comment out the
DATA_PREFIX & HIGH_SCORE_PREFIX using the # symbol. When the game is built
without these options, it will run from the directory you've built it in.

To build the game:

make

To install the program (when you have privileges as root):

make install

An icon for your KDE/GNOME desktop is located (by default) in the
/usr/local/share/games/twind/graphics/ directory called twind.png

If you don't have SDL_mixer installed on your system:

make noaudio

Please note that if your SDL_mixer isn't built with Ogg Vorbis support, you can
still build the game with the standard make command. Sounds used during the
game only require SDL_mixer. Music requires Ogg Vorbis support as well.

To uninstall the program (as root):

make uninstall

To remove the compiled program & object code:

make clean

If you don't have the libpng library on your system, download the latest
bmp-graphics archive file & extract it into your twind source directory. The
included Makefile is the same as above, except it enables the bmp graphics
support.

For your information, I have built this version using the following libraries
with Slackware 9.1:

SDL - 1.2.6
SDL_image - 1.2.3
SDL_mixer - 1.2.5
Ogg Vorbis: libao - 0.8.3
            libogg - 1.0
            libvorbis - 1.0
