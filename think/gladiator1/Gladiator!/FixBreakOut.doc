To  reset  the "break out" count on a character and allow him to once again
be present in the high scores, do the following:

(1) Load the character.
(2) Show the character's stats and press control-Z at the prompt "<more>".
    The message "Password:" should be shown.
(3) Type in "We're on a mission from Elvis!" (without the quotes).
    The message "I'm impressed!" should be shown.
(4) Show the character's stats and verify that the "B#"
    in the right margin is gone.
(5) Select "Character Done".

     th'th'that's all folks.
