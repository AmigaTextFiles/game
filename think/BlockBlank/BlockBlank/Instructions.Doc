GAME PLAY

How To Complete A Puzzle

Block Blank is a puzzle game, the puzzles are made up of different 
coloured and patterned tiles.  You will need to match these tiles together 
in order to complete each puzzle.

However a trained eye is needed to know which tiles will match together 
and in which order to match them.    The idea is to match the same 
coloured sides together.  If for example you had a tile which had an all 
blue top (we will call this tile 'A') and another tile that had an all blue 
bottom (tile 'B') then by dropping tile 'B' on top of tile 'A' you would cause 
these tiles to match together and disappear off the screen. Once you 
have matched all the tiles together and have no more tiles remaining on 
the screen the puzzle will be completed.

Matching tiles is best explained by watching the In Game Demo and 
Instructions (see below) after reading this documentation.  This way you 
will also see the various types of tiles that are available which can't be 
documented in a text file.

The order that the tiles are matched is also quite important, You need to 
make sure that you will NOT have any tiles left-over that can't be 
matched together.  If you do have tile/s remaining then you will have to 
use a retry.  This will allow you to restart the stage.  Please read the 
USING A RETRY section of this document.


IN GAME DEMO AND INSTRUCTIONS
-===========================-

To see the In game Instructions you will of course need to load the 
game.  By staying at the title screen and not pressing the fire button for a 
while, the demo should start.


MOVING THE TILES
-==============-

You control the game by plugging a joystick into the joystick port in your 
Amiga (the normal joystick port.)

When playing the game you will be presented with a cursor that you can 
move Left, Right, Up or Down using the joystick.  To move a tile simply 
place the cursor over it, hold down the Fire button and push the joystick 
left or right respectively.

You will soon find that the tiles can only be moved left or right.  To 
understand why, you must try and imagine that the tiles are stacked on 
top of each other and by moving a tile off the edge of another tile will 
cause the tile to fall down.  Tiles cannot be moved up because this will 
be against the laws of gravity (and Newton will have a hard job 
explaining it).  Any tile without something under it will simply fall down.

Undo Move feature

If you move a tile and decide that its a bad move, providing you have not 
let your finger off the Fire button you will be able to place the tile back to 
where it was.  In other words, tiles will not fall or match together until you 
let your finger off the Fire button.  Since tiles will not match together 
while the fire button is held down you can use this to slide over tiles that 
would normally match.  However, this is provided that you have not 
dropped the tile over the edge, you can't stop tiles from dropping!


SPECIAL SLIDING BLOCKS
-====================-

You may notice on some levels tiles with arrows on them.  Depending on 
which way the arrows are pointing will depend on the direction you can 
move these blocks.  You will be able to move some blocks Up or Down 
and others Left or Right.  The idea is to use these blocks to move 
various tiles or stacks of tiles in the various directions to help complete 
certain puzzles.


USING A RETRY
-===========-

If you get stuck and find yourself in a situation where you can't 
possibly complete the puzzle because you may not be able to match the 
remaining tile/s.  Then you can use a Retry to start the puzzle again.  
However, Retries are limited.  When you start the game you will begin 
with 3 Retries.  Every time you use a Retry, the number of Retries 
remaining will go down until you have no Retries left, in which case it will 
be GAME OVER!  You lose.

However, you can gain an extra Retry after every 5000 points.  Though, 
you will need to finish the puzzle to gain the Retry.

To use a Retry press the Spacebar.


MATCHING MULTIPLE TILES TOGETHER
-==============================-

You may realise that when matching tiles it is possible to match more the 
just the two at once.  You will get extra points for matching more than 
two tiles together.  The scoring goes:

                   2 Tiles        = 100 pts
                   3 Tiles        = 300 pts
                   4 Tiles & more = 500 pts

Be sure when matching multiple tiles together that you can still complete 
the puzzle.  You may find however that the only way to complete the 
puzzle is to match more than 2 tiles together.  For example if you had 
and odd number of tiles on the screen.


TIMER
-===-

You must complete most puzzles within the given time.  The easier 
puzzles are normally not timed and you can take as long as you like to 
complete them.  However the more difficult levels are timed.  If you fail to 
complete a puzzle in time then you will automatically use a Retry.  If you 
have no Retries remaining then the game will be over.  (Read the USING 
A RETRY section of this document.)


SCORING AND TIME BONUSES
-======================-

The scoring during game play is taken on the number of tiles you 
manage to match together at once.  See the MATCHING MULTIPLE 
TILES TOGETHER section.  However you are also given a time bonus if 
the game is timed.  10 Points are given for each second left on the clock 
after the puzzle is completed.  In other words the quicker you do the 
puzzle the more points you get.


SAVING YOUR GAME POSITION
-=======================-

After you completed a puzzle you are given the chance to save your 
game or to initialise a save game disk.  You cannot save a game until a 
save game disk has been created.  To create a save game disk, you will 
need at the ready a blank Amiga formatted disk.  Select Initialise Data 
Disk from the Puzzle Completed menu.  You will be prompted to insert 
your formatted disk.  Initialising a save game disk over a game disk 
initialised before within Block Blank will completely ERASE the game 
positions previously saved on it.  Ensure your save game disk is write 
enabled when initialising or saving game positions onto it.

Once you have an initialised save game disk you will be prompted with 
the save game screen.  You can save up to 9 different game positions 
on one save game disk.  These game positions can be on different 
levels, areas and puzzles.

Choose any position in the list by pushing forward or pulling back on the 
Joystick.  Press the Fire button to select a row.  A cursor will appear 
allowing you to type your name.  Press Return after entering your name 
to save your position.  Selecting a previously saved position will be over 
written with your current game position.

If you had already initialised a save game disk you only need to select 
the Save Game Position option from the Puzzle Completed menu.  Press 
the ESC key at any point to abort the save game procedure and return to 
the game.


STARTING A NEW GAME
-=================-

To start a game, press Fire at the title screen.  You will be given the 
choice on which level of difficulty to start on.

Level 1 - Nice and Easy
Level 2 - A little Tricky
Level 3 - Dam Difficult
Level 4 - Well Hard

Push the joystick forward or backwards to move the white selector bar 
over the various different levels of play and press the Fire button to start.

If you wish to Restore a saved game then move the selector bar over the 
RESTORE A SAVED GAME option and press the Fire button.


RESTORING YOUR GAME POSITION
-==========================-

After selecting RESTORE A SAVED GAME from the Start Game menu 
you will be prompted to insert your save game disk.  Select the game 
position you wish to restore by pushing the joystick forward or backwards 
to highlight the appropriate game position you wish to restore and press 
the Fire button to start play.

Press the ESC key at any point to abort the restore game procedure and 
return to the Start Game menu.
