   MJCON is a small utility that converts an IFF picture into a Ma Jong
data file which you can use as an alternate tile set when playing
Ma Jong Jr.

For WB2.x users
---------------

  To use MJCON simply click the MJCON icon if you are in WBench 2.0.  A
file requester will show up.  Select the directory that your IFF picture(s)
are located.  Select the file or multiple tiles and convert.  When
selecting multiple IFF files, click the Convert command to convert all
selected files, or just double click the single file to convert.

To quit MJCON select Cancel or the CloseWindow.

For WB1.x users
---------------

  MJCON will only work in CLI under WB1.x.  The command is:
  
  MJCON IFFfile outfile
  
  IFFfile is the IFF picture file you want to convert.
  outfile is the output file after convertion.


Note:  MJCON use the original IFF file name and adds the extension
      '.tiles' to the end of the file.  All Ma Jong tile files should
      move to the MJJR/Tiles directory.
