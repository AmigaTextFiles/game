The game
--------

  This is a very classic minehunter game.
If you don't know how to play, here it is:
The game is mouse controlled only.
The aim of the game is to find and identify mines in a randomly filled field.
Left mouse button over a hidden box: shows it, and more if possible.
Right mouse button over a hidden box: puts a flag on it, that means you think 
there is a mine under. The flag can be removed the same way.
A number in a box indicates how many mines there are around it (max:8)
The game is finished when you have found and marked every mines, or when
you have blown up on a mine. (quite simple, isn't it ? :)


Screen setup
------------

  It is given as a parameter to the program. The default value is Pal, but if your monitor
does support this resolution, you can choose DblPal
To change this parameter, just edit the file named "MineHunt"
