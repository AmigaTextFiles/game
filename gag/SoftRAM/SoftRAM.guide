@Node Kurz "SoftRAM: 1. Short description"

SoftRAM is able to increase your RAM space by simply  compressing  all
currently   unused   memory   spaces.  A  brand  new  state-of-the-art
compressing algorithm provides high compression rates, though it is as
fast as lightning!

Since a very special memory mapping algorithm is  used,  SoftRAM  also
works on Amiga's without MMU!

A RAM doubler came first out on  Macintosh,  quickly  followed  by  PC
implementations. Now, even Amiga users have the privilege to use a RAM
doubler!

@Node Install "SoftRAM: 3. Installation and Program Start"

AmigaOS 2.04 is required to use this  program.  There  is  no  special
processor required, but you should have some RAM in your machine!

Simply copy the "SoftRAM" file into your C: drawer.  If  you  want  to
double your RAM space, open a new Shell and type "SoftRAM".

SoftRAM requires some seconds to check the system and compress the RAM
blocks  that  are already allocated. After that, SoftRAM tells you the
current compression rate.

You can stop SoftRAM by pressing <CTRL>-<C>. It  tries  to  decompress
all compressed RAM blocks.

@Node FAQ "SoftRAM: A.1. FAQ"

· Suddenly, I have more than 2 MByte of chip RAM available.

        This is right! SoftRAM even compresses  your  chip  RAM,  e.g.
        unused screens.


· Is it possible that SoftRAM only fakes memory display?

        NOOOOOO! I'd never do THAT!!! SoftRAM works perfectly the same
        way  as  a  well  known  PC  RAM  doubler. And this one works,
        doesn't it?


· Why isn't there such an attractive  window with many colorful gauges
  and displays with nice numbers that no one understand?

        Well, currently I am to lazy to fake - errrr - make a  window,
        too... Perhaps I'll do if I get some great gifts.


· What's the weather like in Germany?

        Currently it's raining... I hope summer  returns  as  soon  as
        possible!

@Node Improve "SoftRAM: A.2. Improvements"

I plan the following improvements for my next release:

· Resources control
· Some beautiful gauges
· Get even more gifts from stupid users...
