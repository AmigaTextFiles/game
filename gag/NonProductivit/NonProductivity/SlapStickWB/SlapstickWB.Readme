                                 -----------

This program simulates those old movies from back in the thirties.

How does it actually work ?

- Start 'Slapstick' from your workbench or CLI.
- You can quit slapstick with the closegadget of the window.

I wish you many happy hours with this useless programm. Have a nice day {:=).

Valkyr 1994, for programs that do not suck in any way !!
