This is the earthquake simulator. You can even alter the scale yourself !!!

How does it actually work ?

- Start 'Quake' from your workbench or CLI.
- You can quit Quake with the closegadget of the window.

I wish you many happy hours with this useless programm. Have a nice day {:=).

Valkyr 1994, for programs that do not suck in any way !!
