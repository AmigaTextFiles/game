        Keybiz is a program meant to change your working environment.

  Government research indicates that the creativity index and lucidity

  factors of journalists, writers, and scribes in general showed remarkable

  improvements when Keybiz is running on their Amigas. When installed in

  a multi-Amiga office, managers report dramatic increases in productivity

  levels yet workers insist that their output has not changed. Further, all

  report that they have developed a certain fondness or attachment to

  their Amigas and claim that their Amiga is friendlier than ever before

  when Keybiz is active. This fondness or friendliness is most frequently

  reported by more senior office workers who yearn for "the good ole days"

  and frown upon technological advances. Some of these workers even claim

  substantial reduction in stress levels at work because of Keybiz. I hope

  that you will enjoy working with Keybiz and will tell your friends about

  its virtues.
