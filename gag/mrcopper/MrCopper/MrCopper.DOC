This program works on Workbench 1.3, 2.04 and 3.0.

    MrCopper Version 3.0
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A little program which puts nice copper bars on the current screen
(i.e. Workbench), there are two ways to use it :

1 >>> Click on its icon and a window will appear with 13 buttons like :

      [ << ] [ >> ] [ Exit ] [R] [G] [B] [xxx] [   ]
       (1)    (2)    (3)        (7)       (8)  [Go!]
                      [   ]
      [ << ] [ >> ] [ About] [R] [G] [B] [xxx] [   ]
       (4)    (5)    (6)        (9)       (10)  (11)

  1 and 2 ; Allow you to cycle through the preset colour sets.
            The number on the left of button (1) is the current set.

  3 ; Exits the program and leaves the current copper pattern on the screen

  4 and 5 ; Change the colour to accept the copper bars (0-3) 0=background
            The number on the left of colour 4 is the current colour.

  6 ; So you don't forget who wrote it. ;-)

2 >>> From the CLI

      If you type < mrcopper3.0 > then it will load the save as above

      but

      You can execute it with the following parameters :

      mrcopper3.0 [colourset]:[register]

      where :

      'colourset' is the pattern number 00-25

         00 ; White -> Purple
         01 ; White -> Yellow
         02 ; White -> Yellow (With Greys Bits!)
         03 ; Blue -> Yellow
         04 ; Blue -> Purple
         05 ; Yellow -> Purple
         06 ; Yellow -> Blue
         07 ; Yellow -> Green
         08 ; Red -> Blue
         09 ; Red -> White
         10 ; Red -> Cyan
         11 ; Red -> Yellow
         12 ; Red -> Purple
         13 ; Purple -> Green
         14 ; Green -> White
         15 ; Green -> Purple
         16 ; Green -> Red
         17 ; Green -> Yellow
         18 ; Pink -> L. Green
         19 ; Blue -> L. Yellow
         20 ; Horizontal Grey Bars
         21 ; Horizontal Yellow Bars
         22 ; Horizontal Red Bars
         23 ; Horizontal Purple Bars
         24 ; Horizontal Green Bars
         25 ; Horizontal Grey, Yellow, Red, Purple And Green Bars

      'register' is the register to accept the copper bars 0-7.

  so to give the background a yellow - green fade :

        mrcopper3.0 10:0

  or to give a black - red fade on the window border (colour 3)

        mrcopper3.0 07:3

   OR New For Version 3...

      mrcopper3.0 [top]:[bot]:[register]

With the given parameters MrCopper will graduate the Workbench from the
top colour (top) through to the bottom colour (bot) in the selected colour
register, 0 being the background, the rest being various parts of the
Workbench screen/windows.

'top' and 'bot' must be in the form RGB, where R is the Red component, G is
the Green component and B is the Blue component. 

FFF - White,  FF0 - Yellow, F80 - Orange, F88 - Pink, F0F - Purple...

So to graduate the Workbench from Purple to Black :

   MrCopper3.0 F0F:000:0

Orange to Light Green :

   MrCopper3.0 F80:8F8:0

(Unfortunatley the shading will be quite coarse (depending on the chosen
colours) as it is limited to 4-bits per component, as AGA 8-bits per
component aren't strictly system legal :( )
