                               By Adam Dawes


A while ago I saw a program that put a little MTV logo in the corner of the
screen. But the text and everything went in FRONT of the logo - a bit crap
methinks.

So this MTV logo goes in front of the CLI screen etc. And it animates too!
It looks quite good when you are using software with no screen handle -
like comms software.

It is completely auto-multitasking, just put the filename in your
startup-sequence.

NOTE: I accept NO RESPONSIBILITY for computer failure or any loss of data
resulting directly or indirectly from using this program. It is used
entirely at the owners risk, and not mine. The file may be distributed
completely free of charge as long as this text file is included.

Enjoy and look out for the 'creepycrawlies' coming soon!!
