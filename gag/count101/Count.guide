  BriefInfo
  ~~~~~~~~~

  'Count' is a small utility, which will be count number of restarts
  of your system. It's all. Really! :-) You can init it for example
  1.1.199x and for example 31.12.199x you can see the result. It's
  funny!

  Usage:

   o Count <opt>

     where <opt> is:

         init   ...  create S:count.file a init counter to zero
         info   ...  informations for you

   o Countf

     Add it to your S:Startup-sequence or S:User-startup. It will
     increase counter.
