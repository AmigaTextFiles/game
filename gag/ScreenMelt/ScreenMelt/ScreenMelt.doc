  Quick ScreenMelt docs

 ScreenMelt takes two parameters.  Workbench screen width
and workbench screem height.  For example, for my Workbench
screen, which is 832*628, I would type in...

 <Path of ScreenMelt> <Workbench width> <Workbench height>
 C:ScreenMelt 832 628

 This program will then melt the Workbench screen according
to the size you specify.

 This program is restricted in no way, and drinks CPU time.
 Therefore, don't use it unless you are about to reboot, or
 something.  That's all it's meant to be.  An emulator of a
 Workbench screen during a nuclear meltdown.  It really does
 emulate it very well.  I doubt Workbench would manage to
 keep running in the real thing either!

  You can quit the program using a joystick or other device
 plugged into port 1 (Joystick port).  Just press a button
 or something.  The screen may still be corrupted a bit
 when you quit it.  I haven't bothered to write any code in
 to restore the screen, although it's easy enough to do.

  I have included the source, and you can do whatever you
 want with it. :)

  Chat to me about how you couln't do without this program,
 or how it totally sux, and is devoid of all sensibility.
