@node whatitis "What is it..."
It is a simply a test to find out how Gothic you are. Of course, you
don't care how goth you are *for yourself* but you might get some red
neck demanding some sort of proof. You can then just stare them straight
in the eye and calmly tell them your score. Alternatively you can
hospitalise them in a really messy way.

@node why "Why..."
I was bored. Nothing on TV, no email, no decent music, so I wrote this.
I'm like that.

@node usinggothtest "How to use it..."
Just double click on the program icon, then choose the answer you desire 
(or the one that looks right).

You can quit before the end but only between each section. You will be 
given a score on quitting or on completion of the test.

I can always ignore you.

@node gothware "Shareware..."
Nope, its GOTHWARE. If you use this and like it I suggest you send me
something Gothic ie black. Anything, anything at all, just make sure its
black. In return you will be put on my mailing list and will be sent the
latest version of GothTest as well as any other GOTHWARE that I have
written, such as TTR and Gothic Tag.

I can be contacted at any of the following addresses :-
