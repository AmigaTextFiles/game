Window Washer.

An 'essential' maintenance utility. :-)
It's old but fully system friendly..
Tested on A1200, A500, A1500.  No noticeable problems....

No Noticeable Use either... but what do you want?

If you're to stingy to pay the postage email to D.J.Butcher@ncl.ac.uk
will be re-directed to the author. Probably.
