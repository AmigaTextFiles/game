/*
	CloseMe - a display hack by Charlie Gibbs

	This version was compiled on April 13, 1988.

	This program started out as a simple exercise in using
	Intuition's facilities, but I decided that if I'm going to
	learn about Intuition, I might as well have fun doing it.

	Special thanks goes to Larry Phillips for providing the basic
	idea, and to Leo Schwab for inspiring me to such perversions.

	This program opens up a screen of its own unless you run it
	from the CLI with a -w switch on the command line.  For some
	reason, it bogs down horribly when running on the Workbench
	screen, and steals some memory that it never gives back,
	although it behaves itself when run in a screen of its own.
	If anyone can tell me why it does this, I'd really appreciate it.
