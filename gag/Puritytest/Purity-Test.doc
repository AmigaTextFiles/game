Quick Docs:


Okay, real simple.  This small program was given to me by a friend (Thanks
Samantha) after she made me do it...

I figured that the Amiga community was missing out on something pretty
amusing by not having this, so I sat down and quickly punched out this
version.

It was written in about 6 hours in Blitz Basic 2, with stack of damn
checking, coz I seem to write pretty buggy code.  It seems to work fully at
the moment.

It should run on all machines from the crappy old 1.3 A500's to the
A1200/A4000, including all processors.

Scoring at the moment needs to be adjusted.  No I will not tell you how I
calculate the scores, it's pretty damn basic at the moment, and really needs
to be looked at.

Yes, you can lose points too.  The main thing is that this is meant to test
how "Impure" you are...  So if you do things like go to church, well you
can't expect to get points for this, now can you ??

Being caught for a crime and then not being convicted is just plain stupid,
so you will lose BIG points for that too...  At the moment...


BUGS:
~~~~~

Unfortunately there are still some bugs in the program.

As I have mentioned, the point scoring system needs a bit of work.

There are probably some spelling mistakes there some where, it was a rush
job.

The text files need cleaning up.

The actual SCORE is not shown, this is the biggest pain in the arse !!!


FUTURE:
~~~~~~~

Okay, what next !?

Get all the bugs fixed.

Clean the source up A LOT.

Mebbe convert to assembler, but as a cli only program !


HISTORY:
~~~~~~~~

V1.0 underwent NUMEROUS changes, but I didn't feel like making heaps of
different versions of sources, so I just saved over the same one each time.

V1.0 was made on the 10/01/1998.
