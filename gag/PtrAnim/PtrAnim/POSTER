[appreantly the original got munched someplace.  Let's try again.  ..Bob]

As the name implies, the pointer animator animates the Workbench
pointer.  It does this by substituting its own pointer for the default
pointer and then rapidly changing the pointer image to cause the
illusion of motion.  The image sequences used are stored in standard
IFF ILBM files.  This allows you to easily edit predefined animations
and create your own pointer animations.  In addition to the normal
three color pointer, the pointer animator also supports a fifteen
color pointer.

[No source.  Join part1 and part2, then uudecode the result.  ..Bob]
