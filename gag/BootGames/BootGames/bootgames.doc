	BOOTOUT V5.X (C)1990  AND  SQUASH V4.3 (C)1990 PAUL HAYTER
       ============================================================

	  Bootout and Squash are two tiny games which fit into the
	bootblocks of your bootdisk. BootOut is a breakout type game
	and Squash is a Squash type game (remember the old TV games with
	paddles and a choice of four games). Both are pretty simplistic,
	though Squash was written a long time ago (when I knew nothing
	about programming) and BootOut was written more recently which
	accounts for its different look.

	  Both BootGames are FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE.That is ,you can copy
	(or install) them as much as you like, as long as they are not
	used for commercial purposes (Who would want to?).

	SQUASH
	======

	  The object of the game is to keep the ball bouncing in the
	area bounded by the white walls. Everytime you hit the ball you
	get 1 point. After every 5 points you get, the ball speeds up
	making it harder. If you miss the ball, the score is reset to
	zero, and you start again. If you want to continue booting
	your computer then hit any key.

	BOOTOUT
	=======

	  The object of the game is to remove all the red bricks from the
	wall taking up the top half of the screen. You do this by moving
	the bat (at the bottom) to hit the ball such that the ball
	continues bouncing around the screen, hopefully hitting bricks.
	Each brick removed earns you 10 points.

	  If a ball passes below the bat, you lose one ball. This is
	shown by the version number at the top of the screen. It starts
	at V5.5, and goes to V5.4 when you lose one ball, then to V5.3
	etc. If you go through all 5 balls, the score is reset, and you
	start again
	
	  NOTE: If you hit the ball with the corner of your bat, the
	ball gets deflected at a different angle.

	  If you want to continue booting your Amiga hit the menu button.

	INSTALLING
	==========

	  There are two programs in this directory specifically for
	installing Squash and Bootout (called InstallSquash and
	InstallBootout). When either is run you get presented with a
	requester prompting you to either INSTALL DF0: or CANCEL. If
	you choose the install option, make sure you have the disk you
	want installed in DF0:. Choosing CANCEL takes you back to the
	CLI or WorkBench.
