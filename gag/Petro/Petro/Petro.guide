  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Petro@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  Oh,dear.

  I got really bored,and happened to find a sample of Petro
  saying his name on a CUCD...things just got out of hand,and
  this is the result.

  For any new Amiga users (!) or anyone who's been living deep
  underground/out in space,Petro Tyschtschenko is the president
  of Amiga International,the marketing operation in Germany of
  the whole Amiga,er,"industry" (Amiga Inc in the USA is the R&D
  section of Amiga).Petro kept the Amiga alive during the long
  years without funding or commercial support,and finally the
  Amiga is being redeveloped with funding from massive PC makers,
  Gateway (formerly Gateway 2000).

  Although it's only a little throwaway program,it's also a
  sign of respect for Petro,for all his hard work during the
  long years of nothing happening,Amiga-wise.And anybody who can
  still sell thousands of out-of-date Amiga 1200s has to be a
  brilliant salesman!

  His hard work and patience looks set to be rewarded in the next
  couple of years :)

  UPDATE : Not too sure about the goings-on with Mick Tinker...

  Petro was programmed in Blitz,and should work on any WB2.0+
  system.

  This program comes with source code and is Public Domain (though
  I suppose the sound is (c) CU Amiga or (c) Amiga International.
  Or even (c) Petro Tyschtschenko ;)

  Blitz users who find that any of the commands don't tokenise,try
  load the ascii version to see what they are,then go buy one of the
  Blitz updates (Ultimate Blitz or Blitz Support Suite)...

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Instructions@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  Just click on the Petro icon to start.

    @{i}You can do lots of interesting things @{ui}:

  * Click on the "Talk to me!" button to have Petro speak to you.

  * Access the About menu for some information.

  * Use the Snapshot menu to snapshot the window's position.

  * Change the title via the TITLE tooltype.

  * Change the (@{u}short@{uu}) gadget text via the GADGET_TEXT tooltype.

  * If you have a weird border width,you can adjust the horizontal
    position of the image by altering the OFFSET tooltype,but it
    shouldn't be needed.

  * Quit.

  * Er,that's it.

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Configuration@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  The program by default looks for its sound and graphics files in
  the Snd+Gfx drawer supplied,but @{fg shine}if (for some reason) you want to run
  Petro from the WBStartup drawer@{fg text},you can specify the location of these
  files in the tooltypes (PETRO_GFX=path:drawer/petro_gfx.iff) and
  (PETRO_SND=path:drawer/petro_snd.iff).You can also use your own files,but
  don't be surprised if they screw up (especially the sound file ;)

  If you use your own image,make sure you only use the standard first four
  colours of the Workbench,as I haven't added remapping code...

  @{i}There are alternative size images available @{ui}:

  For @{b}non-laced WB users@{ub},you can specify "petro_gfx.iff" or
  "petro_sml_gfx.iff" for normal and small versions respectively.

  @{b}Hi-res laced WB or gfx card users@{ub} may wish to use the
  "laced_petro_lge_gfx.iff" or "laced_petro_sml_gfx.iff" image files
  supplied.

  Just specify one of these files in the PETRO_GFX tooltype.

  That's it :)

  @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}Alright,who wasted their time with this?!@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back}

  It was me,James L Boyd :)

  I'm at @{i}jamesboyd@all-hail.freeserve.co.uk @{ui}

  I may as well plug BeatBox 2,the amazing shareware music
  program for stupid people who can't figure out trackers (like me).

  That's @{b}@{fg shine}@{bg fill}BeatBox 2@{ub}@{fg text}@{bg back},available for free from Aminet :)
