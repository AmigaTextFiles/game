	Here is a wee program I did yesterday.  It's a display hack, and in
tradition of such things, I won't tell you what it does.  Just feed it an 
ILBM and wait about three minutes.  I use the picture of Opus, cuz it's faster.
Don't ask for the source; it would be too embarassing to let it see the light 
of day. Type `smush ?' for instructions (or `smush \?' if you use Matt's shell).
