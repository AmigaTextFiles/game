I. What is this?
ииииииииииииииии
  Hallo and a warm welcome to this little piece of memory optimization. This
small command allows you to literally multiply your RAM.


II. What kind of Computer do I need?
ииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии
  First of all you need an Amiga Computer. If this Amiga at least has OS2.0
you are one of the lucky few that can use this very useful tool.


II. But how do I use it?
ииииииииииииииииииииииии
  MemExplosion (F=Factor/N)

  "Factor" is an optional option (hm?) that allows you to specify by which
factor your memory should be increased. The default is 11.


III. And how does it work?
ииииииииииииииииииииииииии
  Memory Explosion of course does NOT really increase your memory as this
just is not possible (If you really thought it was, you should sell your
Amiga and buy a PC with Windows95, as you are the ideal customer for 
Bill Gates' selling machinery, I guess...).
  This little tool just patches the exec.library function "AvailMem()" and
multiplies all values given back by that function with a given factor. So
just the memory shown in your workbench title increases and all your 
applications use a multiple of the memory they used before (Yep, just the
Windows-flavour brought to your Amiga!).


IV. But why do I need this S*** anyway?
иииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии
  Well if you are one of the typical profile-neurotic Amiga-Users, this is
for you. Didn't you ever dream of 1Gb of Chipmem? And didn't you ever want
to win the "mine is bigger than yours"-race this easy?
  Use and enjoy...


V. Am I allowed to copy this?
иииииииииииииииииииииииииииии
  In my godlike kindness I decided to offer this great program as a gift
to the whole community of Amiga users. So you are allowed to copy it as 
often as you want or put it on all CD's you ever wanted to put it on.
  You are even allowed to put it on one disk an sell it for $9.99 or
anything like that. (Hi Mallander Software! :)
  I'd only appreciate it if you sent me a little Email if you liked this
