Very Short:
===========

	This changes the Window Title of any Workbench-Task
	related window. The ZOOM, CLOSE, DEPTH and DRAGBAR
	will be changed to look like in a well known, ehrm,
	"operating system".

Introduction:
=============

	We all like the amiga and say "f*cksh*t!" to any PC
	running with W!ndows, W!ndows95, ... and so on.
	
	But PC-people are (mainly) stupid and don't know anything
	about operating systems in detail; they just know them
	by NAME or by VIEW - you can't discuss with them about
	message passing, the differences between a thread and a
	task and a process, ... and so on.
	
	Well, renaming "Workbench" into "W!ndows" is not very intelligent,
	but changing some attributes of its look does a lot.
	
	And finally this is such a hack. Yes, its a hack because
	you can't do this without patching system functions.

Installation:
=============

	Very simple. Copy the contents of this directory to your
	harddrive (make a drawer, copy all files into it and that's it).
	Let's say you have copied all files to SYS:stuff/wb95 !
	
	Add these line to your S:user-startup
	
	;BEGIN WIN.INI
	assign WB95: SYS:stuff/wb95       ; not really needed; just shorter
	run <>NIL: WB95:WB95 WB95:open.br WB95:close.br ... <more options>
	;END WIN.INI

	For <more options> see the next chapter.

Options:
========

	IMG1,IMG2,IMG3,IMG4,FONTNAME/K,FONTSIZE/N/K,FONTSTYLE/N/K,PATCHDOPUS/S

	IMG? are the names of datatype-loadable pictures.

	suggested usage (with the supplied images)
	
				Standard		More Cool
	
	IMG1			open.br		amiga.br
	IMG2			close.br		sleep.br
	IMG3			dopus.br		-
	IMG4			config.br		-

	((PLEASE SEND ME BRUSHES !! I'm not an artist... ;-))
	
	FONTNAME
		is the name of an alternate font.
	
		example: "helvetica.font". default is "helvetica.font"
	
	FONTSIZE
		is the y-size of the font.

		example: 13. default is 13
	
	FONTSTYLE
		is a bitpacked fontstyle mask.
		1	underline
		2	bold
		4	italics

		example: 3. (this is bold AND underline). default is 2 (!)

	PATCHDOPUS
		this allows you to use this patch also with DOPUS 5.x
		(this means it will patch dopus to look like W95, not
		 that it doesn't work if you have dopus 5.x and this
		 option not installed!)

	CENTERTITLE
		not yet; will center the window title

Notes:
======

-	Only the Windows of the Workbench task will be changed

-	I group ALWAYS all possibilities of DRAG, ZOOM, DEPTH and CLOSE
	into two main groups: the one with all gadgets enabled and the
	other case. this means: EACH PATCHED WINDOW WILL HAVE A CLOSEGADGET,
	THAT DOESN'T WORK IF THE WINDOW ORIGINALLY HASN'T A CLOSEGADGET.
	
	Am I stupid ? Yes. But it was more easy to realize it in this matter,
	and I have never seen a W!ndows95 application window without one.
	
	This means you have either a Dragbar AND a Closegadget, or the full
	known triple at the right corner.

-	You can specify any font you like, but the supplied images won't be
	scaled (the gadgets will adapt to the font's size plus 4) !
	You will have to draw/scale new ones (scaling is easy but looks bad)

-	The CLOSEGADGET works like expected: one click and close. as mentioned
	above: each window will have one, but if the window hasn't one before,
	it won't react to it (try Workbench-Menu: Execute Command)

-	The ZOOMGADGET works like expected.

-	The ICONIFYGADGET is a DEPTHGADGET. It is hard to iconify windows
	"system friendly", but if you are the one who has developed
	"IconifyGadget" -> contact me if you want. On a real W!ndows95
	the window should hide and appear in the taskbar...

-	DRIPens are used

-	The images were loaded and remapped by the datatypes.library.
	This means you can use any format/colordepth and so on.

Bugs and Problems:
==================

-	after a Screenmode change all images were remapped wrong.
	I don't know why! Please take a look at RemapDrawer() and
	tell my why this happens!

-	If you want to use this hack together with Dopus 5.x, you
	must, repeat, MUST use Dopus ON THE WORKBENCH SCREEN.

-	some beta testers have reported that it doesn't work with
	their version of directoy opus. well, I don't know why;
	the only reason could be that they maybe use a pirated
	version of dopus ?

-	reqtools.library is badly programmed, because it seems to
	calculate the uppermost position with TextFont.tf_YSize
	and NOT with Window.BorderTop!!!! Don't know how to fix it.

-	The right border slider of Workbench windows is positioned
	wrong, but you won't notice that because WB95 knows about it
	and corrects the position ;-) hacky hacky

-	The ZOOMGADGET has TWO states like it has under W!ndows95,
	but unfortunately it isn't updated correctly (you have to
	inactivate/activate the window first)

-	The HIT BOX of the gadgets is some pixels to big, I should fix
	this but not now. (look in the source to get confused ;-)

-	On Amiga 4000/030 STANDARD it sometimes takes 30 seconds to
	start, this is really strange!!! Seems to be datatypes.lib and
	the image loading and remapping.

-	the source was not maintained during development. absolute
	references were used and layout is done using weird formulas.
	a complete rewrite is the only solution -

-	the windowtitle of all patched windows is set to NULL. this
	had to be done because otherwise Intuition would render the
	title over our newly drawn titlebar.
	
	problem: all intuition peekers won't get the title of patched
	windows.

====================
	NEEDED
		CPU = 68000
		OS  = AmigaOS 3.0
		GFX = ECS
		RAM = 2MB

	SUGGESTED
		CPU = 68040
		OS  = AmigaOS 3.1
		GFX = CyberGraphics
		RAM = 16MB

	Note: this list is two weeks old, several changes to the
	source were made - all information here could be incorrect now.
