A weird hack comparable to sysihack/urouhack, but this
is completely different. It replaces the CLOSEGADGET,
ZOOMGADGET and DEPTHGADGET to look like the ones used
in Bill's OS, enlarges the Windowtitle, let the user
specify a different font for it, a other softstyle
and a couple of images in the left corner!

This is brainware!

Really, if you are using this hack for more than one day,
you have to send me your brain (...because you won't need
it anymore then ;-) - or an english course book ... :-(
