Alternative Food Icons

These were kindly supplied by Curt Esser.

If you want to use these icons,you'll have to copy them over.
The food drawer icons are attached to sound samples,so don't
just delete them all from the Workbench!

You'll have to delete the original icons (probably from the
shell - ... Delete [path]/Food/#?.info ... should do it.Then you'll
have to copy all of the icons you need over.Or you could use
Iconian,PPaint or similar programs.

See ya!
