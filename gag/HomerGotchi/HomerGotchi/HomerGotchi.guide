   Introduction
   ------------

 [ Updated 15 February 1999 - remap progress bar, menus and proper
 font-sensitivity, plus a few little bug-fixes. ]

 HomerGotchi is just what you think.Except he only eats
 things....

 Well,who'd want to clean up after Homer?

 He uses some samples from the other Homer archive by
 David Swazbrook on Aminet and a couple from off of the
 web (and,no,I won't tell you where,as it's one of the 
 few left!)

 Just leave him running on your Workbench until he mumbles
 (don't know if he'll work on gfx cards - probably not,but let
  me know if he does :) ...

@node "Requirements" "Requirements"


   Requirements (Installation's at the bottom!)
   --------------------------------------------

 You'll need -

 1) An Amiga.

    HomerGotchi was written on an A1200/030 and although he
    has some alternative routines for OCS/ECS Amigas,this
    hasn't been tested.

 2) NewIcons.Or you're wasting your time (unless you can be 
    bothered to draw some ordinary icons...).The icons which
    you feed Homer are NewIcons,and I only made a cursory
    effort at converting them to 4 colour (and screwed that up).
    [*Update* - Curt Esser's just supplied a load of alternative
    icons,including MagicWB icons.Have fun changing them all over!
    Thanks @{i}again@{ui},Curt!]

 3) Reqtools.library.
    
 4) I recommend plenty of colours on your Workbench screen,as 
    Homer doesn't seem to come out looking too well on lower 
    screen depths (best on 256 colour).
 
 5) If you really want to delete any unnecessary stuff,
    here's what the program MUST have (it doesn't do any 
    error-checking for these) :

    HomerGotchi
    HomerGotchi.info (strongly recommended,anyway)
    The entire contents of the "Food" drawer
    The entire contents of the "Comments" drawer

    See @{"WARNING." link "Bugs" 0}

    Everything else can be deleted if required.

 6) Blitz Programmers - the source is in the archive (in ASCII
    format, as all Blitz source should be to work on others' setups!).

    The files needed to compile are in there too - saveshapes is a Blitz
    Shapes file (ie multiple shapes - just do LoadShapes and save them
    separately if you want to modify them, then do SaveShapes when you're
    done), and homerspalette is, er, Homer's palette, which is what the
    shapes use to start off, before the Workbench remapping happens...

    Anyway, as long as you compile it from the main drawer, using the
    very short instructions in the source, it'll be OK :)
    
   Installation
   ------------

 Drag the HomerGotchi directory somewhere.That's it.
 (You can change things,but the food and comments drawers@{i} must @{ui}be
 in the same drawer as the HomerGotchi program)

 See above for what you don't need...

@node "Usage" "Usage"



   Usage
   -----

 FOR IMPATIENT PEOPLE:

 The stuff on what you have to do is at the bottom of
 this page,under "HomerGotchi".

 For the rest:

 Double-click the HomerGotchi icon (note that there are
 alternatives in the AlternativeIcons drawer (surprise).

 On the subject of icons,it's recommended that you don't
 delete/rename the HomerGotchi icon,as the tooltypes are read 
 from here.

   ToolTypes
   ---------

 These have an effect on the running of HomerGotchi - they're all
 set by the program on ending, so no need to touch them :

 FACING=LEFT/RIGHT - Faces Homer's head to the left or right.

 TOP=0             - The X position of the window.

 LEFT=0            - The Y position of the window.

   HomerGotchi
   -----------

 When you open the HomerGotchi drawer,you'll see a drawer named "Food".
 This contains the stuff which you feed to Homer.

 WARNING - only feed him what he asks for,or he won't be happy!

 The number in his title-bar is his satisfaction,from 0-100.

 Don't let it drop to zero!

 Just carry on with your normal Amiga usage intil you hear Homer
 drooling about a particular item of food.

 Then you just drag the icon into his window!

 You'll know if he's happy!

 Finally,while you're here,I recommend that you @{b}quit HomerGotchi@{ub}
 @{b}@{i}before @{ui}you reboot@{ub},in case Homer tries to access a sample while you're
 doing the "3 key salute"...

 That's all...

   Credits
   -------

 HomerGotchi was written by James L Boyd in Blitz Basic
 over two days (17/18 January,1998).This damn guide took
 about a week! UPDATED 15 February 1999!

 The remapping routine was supplied by Curt Esser (thanks!).

 Thanks also to everyone on the Blitz-list.

   Bugs
   ----

    WARNING!!!!
    -----------

 Not a bug,but an "unimplemented feature" ;)

 If you delete any of the sound files while the program is running,
 (ie. @{i}any of @{ui}the contents of the "@{b}Food@{ub}" and "@{b}Comments@{ub}" drawers),he @{b}@{i}@{u}WILL@{uu} @{ub}@{ui}
 crash spectacularly! The program just checks for the existence
 of the samples at the start.And if you delete any half-way through
 you're stupid anyway ;)  [*Update* My brother did exactly this on his
 first try.The twat.]

   The Bugs :)

 1) When you open or resize a window while Homer's speaking,
    the sound may come out garbled (like buzzing).Don't worry
    about it - it does no harm!
 
 2) Can't think of any really :)

 HomerGotchi has proven to be pretty stable :)
