	Here is a repost of Munching Squares for the Amiga.  Now it does
more interesting things.  'ms2' takes a single argument, which is any
unsigned 16-bit integer.  This is the 'seed' value.

	Interesting seed values include 1, 2, 257, 4369, 4681, 32769, 32784,
5643.  Try odd numbers near powers of two.

	I would have made it more "user-friendly", but in the process of
fiddling with a new algorithm, I found a simply gorgeous new basis for a
true display hack.  Coming soon to a node near you....

	Hope you like the new version.
