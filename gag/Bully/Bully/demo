; modified 15-Nov-87 by fnf to give more time for everything to start
; on a non-FACC system.  Also, I could not get fields to run properly.
;
; first, start the boing demo
echo "Running boing..."
run boing
wait 10
; and have the user start the animation part of it (sigh)
echo "I just started the boing demo. Please change to it's"
echo "screen, click near the ball to start it, and then"
echo "change back to the workbench screen. I recommend"
echo "Amiga-M and Amiga-N to change screens."
echo
wait 20
; start the three easy demos
echo "Running zippy..."
run display >nil: zippy
wait 10
echo "Running fields..."
run wbrun >nil: fields
wait 10
; putting newboxes out of the way
placewindow Box 0/0 newboxes
wait 10
; now, put the fields window out of the way
placewindow Fields 0/0
; finally, start the screens in motion
; bully
