	This is just a stupid gag program that does absolutely nothing
	except maybe humour you for 10 seconds. Use it and abuse it, but
	do pass it on.
	
	
	This was originally a text file my brother found on a newsgroup
	and I thought that it was crying out for a little touch up.
	
	This was written using Blitz, and just goes to show what a sad
	programmer I am.
	
	No offense to anyone who believes, and if HE'S reading then errm
	sorry boss.

	AND IF THE AMIGA DOESN'T BOUNCE BACK TO THE TOP OF THE PILE THEN
	I'M GOING TO SPIT MY DUMMY OUT.
	
	AMEN...!!
