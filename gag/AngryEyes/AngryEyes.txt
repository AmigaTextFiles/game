This is a little sprite demo, maybe the only interesting thing about
it is its capabilty to display many sprites at an acceptable
frame rate.

You need the following to run it:
- MC68020+
- a gfx board with a 256 colour chunky mode, resolution like 320x200
  is ok for ZII machines, ZIII may try higher
- OS 3.0+
- some fast ram

It should also run on AGA, but as it uses OS-WritePixelArry8, it
will run very slow. Also, it does not use "real" double buffering,
because I had no idea how to implement it on various systems (Picasso96,
CyberGfx etc.). So it will look very ugly on AGA (untested).

Usage is simple. Start it, chose a screen mode like 320x200x256,
and click the start/stop button. You can adjust the number of
"p-objects" with the cycle gadget, but the new value will only
be used after restarting. You may think of this number as their
average sales per day in 1997, so set it high (will release a
new version for 1998 with numbers at least 10 times higher :)
Quit quits ...

Why does it exist? Well, I planned on doing something like a
c&c clone (= lots of small moving objects, but it will  never get
finished ... as usual) and I thought the most important thing would
be a fast sprite-engine (now I know better ...). As I wanted it to support
256 colors, I could not try it with my ECS-Amiga, so I had to use my
gfx-board. Bad luck, it is an old Domino/ET4000 with no blitter, so I
made a sprite engine which uses fast ram for building a chunky
buffer. This demo is not totally optimized for speed, the random number
generator uses real math, and so does the procedure which is responsible
for the eyes. Also sound is somewhat broken, using datatypes for loading
and playing samples makes this supereasy but does not give needed
control.
It does only run on 68020+, because it uses unaligned word/longword moves,
I heard there exist some broken turbo boards that do not support this,
guess it will not run on such machines.

It would be nice if you could send me the fps results from your
supercool 68060 ZIII (or whatever) machine, they should look like:
(example results from my machine)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
CPU: 68030/25
FastMem: 6,5MB
GfxBoard: Domino in ZII-bus
GfxSystem: Picasso96
41fps on 320x200, 10 sprites,
10fps on 320x200, 1000 sprites,
7fps on 640x480, 10 sprites
5fps on 640x480, 1000 sprites
--------------------------------------------------------------------

And yes, aeh no, this is not coded in asm but in M2 (with a few
procedures written in "Pixel", but they get compiled by some
M2-procdures, so still no source asm, hm, ok I found 8 lines
of inline asm... :)
Check out dev/m2/Cyclone#? if you want to see a nice&fast
compiler!

P.S.: No © on this one, but do nothing with it that you would not do
with your mother ...


P.P.S.: Appended below you will find an extract out of my first
try to do a "Helmut K." emulator for the Amiga. The most important
part, the "phrase generator", was done in two weeks. It works
already so good, that two out of three members of the UDC could not
decide whether it was really him or not!
