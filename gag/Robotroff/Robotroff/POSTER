	This is BIG.  A lot bigger than I had originally anticipated or
desired.  Nevertheless, people seem to like it, and I finally "finished" it.
It's my latest display hack.

	It's called "Robotroff".

	By the way, when is someone going to notice all this code I've been
writing and offer me a job?  I can write serious programs too, you know.
While I do enjoy writing this stuff, I'd enjoy it even more if someone were
paying me for it.

	Anyway, I think you'll like this one.  Hope you haven't thrown away
your Manx 3.20a compiler yet.
