@node intro "Introduction"
Window Walker is a program for all of you who love having small men walking
on your Workbench. There are some old programs with this theme around, but
this one stands out in the meaning that it works (theoretically) on any
screen resolution you're throwing at it. Different screen depths shouldn't
be a problem either. Note though that some weird flickering and speed loss
could appear on some systems. Please leave a bug report if you experience
this. CyberGFX SHOULD be treated more nicely now, but a report on that
would be nice.

If you don't want to control the little man, known among my friends as the
"sluring" by the way, there is a mode available where he walks on his own
and tries to jump to another window if he reaches an edge.

Window Walker is giftware. If you find it so amazing you can barely speak,
I would appreciate if you could send me some nice gift like an encouraging
e-mail, a postcard or a B603e board :-D

@node usage "Usage"
Window Walker can be started from WB or CLI.

CLI arguments: AUTO/S,NOWINDOW/S

AUTO:     Start the program in autowalking mode.
NOWINDOW: Don't open the control window.

These options can also be given as tooltypes from WB.

To control the man you need the window opened by the program. Have that
window active and use the cursor keys as follows:

      LEFT - go left
     RIGHT - go right
        UP - jump
 LEFT+JUMP - jump left
RIGHT+JUMP - jump right
     SPACE - toggle autowalk

The program terminates if the window is closed or the man falls down.

@node history "History"
Version 1.12 (970603)
Oops, I used a function that CyberGFX doesn't support. No more though.

Version 1.1  (970509)
Killed the "ghost".
I read the CyberGFX docs more carefully and set up the code accordingly.
More adaptable to different font sizes and background window positionings.
Possible to toggle between autowalk and user control.
Possible to start more than once a time. Beware though! It does NOT treat
the WB background very kindly...on my setup.
New option: NOWINDOW.

Version 1.06 (970420)
Fixed guru on 68000.
Reduced size of the executable.

Version 1.05 (970417)

Fixed bug with multiple backdrop windows.
Fixed some typos in the guide.

Version 1.0  (970413)
First public release
@endnode

@node bugs "Bugs"

On some configurations, flickering and speed loss could occur.
Let me know if that's the case with your setup!

If the character starts behind a window, corrupt graphics show in the
background until you move a window over it.
