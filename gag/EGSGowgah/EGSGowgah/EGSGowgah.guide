@node Purpose
This program is essential for every EGS user. Why ? Don't ask.
@endnode


@node Installation
Create a EGSGowgah.key file in L: with an RSA enrypted password,
install EGS V8.3b (beta), configure for a 5-monitor-system, make
space for 3 swap partitions of 64 MB each, install networking
software, 3 DTP programs, 24 MB of RAM, and poke around in the
potgo.resource until...ok, actually just start this beast.

A true color EGS default screen is recommended.

@node Usage

Are you kidding ?

Ok, it is possible to quit this program, drag around the window
and move it to the front/back. That should suffice for you, eh ?

@node q_and_a

Question: What does this strange name mean ?

Answer:   :-)


Question: Is this a serious program ?

Answer:   Yeah, certainly. Just tell your friends it's a great
          true-color real-time system activity monitor. If they
          believe you, it probably IS a serious program (or,
          alternatively, your friends have serious problems).

@node bugs

This program could be a member of the S.U.C.K.S. line of
excellent software products, but unfortunately I think
it's still too useful for that.
