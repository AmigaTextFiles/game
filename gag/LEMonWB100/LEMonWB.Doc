OVERVIEW:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Who압 not missing the little walking people with the green hair.
Right, I mean the Lemmings. Here they go again! Not in their own world
but on your workbench.
This Lemmings can walk, climb and certainly fall. They all got a
parachute, so they can survive any fall.
They are only running upon windows - in other objects like icons etc.
they aren앖 interested.
If a lemming has reached the right lower corner of the workbench, it
is saved and disappears.
If a falling lemming can앖 reach firm ground, it falls out of the
screen and is dead.


THE PROGRAM
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: LEMonWB [waitmin waitmax][lemwaitmin lemwaitmax][lemmings] | [?]

Waitmin, waitmax:
    The first Lemming is not immediatly falling, but it압 waiting
    a random time between "waitmin" and "waitmax" seconds.
    Default is [0 0].

Lemwaitmin, lemwaitmax:
    With this function you can adjust the frequence of the lemming압
    appearence. Again a random time is lying between "lemwaitmin"
    and "lemwaitmax" seconds. Default is [20 30]

Lemmings:
    Who thinks 5 lemmings to be too much can reduce their number.
    Default is 5 lemmings.

A call with "?" as parameter will give a short description.
A call from workbench trough icon is not supported yet. But you can
use it with "IconX" and a batch-file.


HARDWARE-REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEMonWB should run on all Amigas with kickstart version equal or
higher 1.3. I had not chance to test this program on computers
with the new ECS-chips - so there may bee problems.
With 1 lemming the program needs about 10% of Amiga압 power, with
all 5 lemmings about 20% (A500/A2000).
The program is crunched with the Imploder to save space on your
disk. It comprises now only about 25% of the origin size.
But you can use it like a normal program because it압 decrunching
itself on runtime. Then you need about 80KBytes of memory.


FUTURE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Support ECS-resolutions.
 - Sound. (Oh-No!!!)
 - A "finish reached"-animation.


HISTORY:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
V1.00:  Interlace-Mode ist supported.
V0.99:  First and last beta-version.
