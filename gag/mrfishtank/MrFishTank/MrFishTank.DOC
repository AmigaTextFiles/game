   MrFishTank v2.0
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Workbench fishtank simulator.

A new version (although I doubt VERY much whether you've seen any of the
other versions) which multi-tasks correctly!

Use the numeric keys to change the fishies colours (NOT keypad).

Press ESCAPE when the MrFishTank window is highlighted to exit.

 Send anything you like to me at:
