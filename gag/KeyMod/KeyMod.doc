   KeyMod,  its documentation and the ss.library are Copyright (c) Martin Mares,

   This  archive  can  be  freely  redistributed as long as all of its files are
included   in   their   original   form  without  any  additions,  deletions  or
modifications  (excluding addition of other README-style files and icons) and no
more  than a nominal fee is charged for its distribution.  All copyright notices
in  the  programs and accompanying documentation files must remain intact.  It's
especially  forbidden  to add various '.displayme' files and BBS advertisements.
This style of distribution is generally known as FREEWARE.

   Source  text of this program is included in the distribution.  You can freely
improve  it.   If  you  want  to  distribute your improved version, there're two
possibilities:   (1)  Send  your  improvements  to  me  (the best form is a diff
output)  and  I'll include them in the next release.  (2) Distribute them alone.
In  this  case, you must mention the name of original author, change the name of
the  product  (not  only  by  increasing  the  version),  and  obey  all  of the
distribution rules mentioned above.

   This  software  is  provided  "AS  IS"  without  warranty of any kind, either
expressed  or  implied.   The author is not responsible for any damage caused by
it.


Introduction
============

   This small commodity monitors the keyboard input and adds misspellings to it.
This process is somewhat random, controlled by magic number entered as an
optional parameter (the default value is 23333 -- use other values and see what
does it affect the modification rate). The probability of misspelling increases
rapidly with typing speed simulating real misspellings.

   The author doesn't guarantee quality of generated misspellings. It's even
possible that the misspelling caused by this program reverses some caused by
you (thus it helps you!). The only supported type is now the substitution of
pressed key by some key on the left or on the right from it.

   The program can be stopped by sending a CTRL-C to it or by killing it from
the Commodities Exchange utility.


Requirements
============

   - ss.library 5.1 or newer (downloadable from the AmiNet)

   - Kickstart and Workbench 2.04 or newer
