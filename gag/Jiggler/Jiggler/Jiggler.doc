Jiggler  (Lee Kindness)
=======================

 Jiggler is a useless Workbench hack, it makes all the windows move toward
the mouse pointer. It installs itself as a commodity, so exchange can be
used to control it (enable/disable/kill). The following Workbench tool types
are supported:

	DELAY=<n> : Number of seconds between each movement of the windows. 
	  (def: 2)
	OFFSET=<n> : How many pixels the windows are moved each time. 
	  (def: 1)
	CX_POPKEY=<hot key> : This key combination will en/disable jiggler 
	  (def: rawkey control alt j)
	PRIORITY=<n> : The task priority Jiggler.
	  (def: -21)
	CX_PRIORITY=<n> : The priority of Jiggler in the commodities network.
	  (def: 0)
	  
These arguments can also be used if jiggler is started from the shell, using
the following template:

     DELAY/K/N,OFFSET/K/N,PRIORITY/K/N,CX_PRIORITY/K/N,CX_POPKEY/K
