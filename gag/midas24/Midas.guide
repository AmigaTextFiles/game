What can I do with MIDAS                               
@{b}________________________@{ub}

With  MIDAS  you  can impress your friends or all
people  who are simple minded.  You can make them
believe that MIDAS has the intelligence to answer
every question they ask.

@node HOWUSE "How can I use it?"
How can I use it?
@{b}_________________@{ub}

The  trick  is,  that  MIDAS  doesn't  answer any
questions. YOU answer the questions.
                     
At  first  start  MIDAS and wait for the "MIDAS>"
after  the  fake  loading.   Now  you type in the
answer  of  the  question  and end it with a "-".
Take care to make no mistakes and that the answer
is not longer than the  random introduction texts 
from  the  @{"MIDAS.dat-file" link CONFIG}.  
If you finished the answer with the "-".  You can
input  any  mess  until the ":" appears.  At that
point  you  have  to  enter  the  question of the
answer   you   already  typed  in.   Finish  your
question with the CR and MIDAS will print out the
RIGHT answer after some faked thinking.  Now your
friends will go "Wooow!" and will ask themselves:
"How   bizarre!".   You  can  ask  MIDAS  only  4
questions,  then  you can quit it with a click on
the close gadget.

Are there any special features?
@{b}_______________________________@{ub}

If  you  wanna  confuse your guests totally it is
useful  that not all questions can be answered by
MIDAS.   If  you  want  to  get  an Error on your
screen, from the @{"MIDAS.dat-file" link CONFIG}, you must enter
a  "<"  in  the answer string.  This is also very
useful  when  you  have made a mistake.  Warning:
If  MIDAS prints the Error "Token not found!" you
have forgot to type in a "<" or a "-".

@node STORY "The Story" 
The story
@{b}_________@{ub}

The  whole  program  is  VERY inspired by ZEUS, a
program  by  an  russian freak (hahaha!).  I just
improved  the  features  that I missed in ZEUS in
this  program.  My name is Sharp.  Patrick Sharp.
I  am  student at the Technical Science School of
Oaklahoma City/USA.  Sorry I don't own a Internet
account,  so  be  patient  and  wait  for further
releases of MIDAS.

                                    

                          November 1996, P.Sharp.

@node CONFIG "The MIDAS.dat-file"
How to make MIDAS my own slave
@{b}______________________________@{ub}

The  idea  of  MIDAS  is  that  you  type  in the
question while MIDAS prints an introduction.  You
are  able  to  edit  these  texts.   And its also
possible to edit the errors which appear when you
type in an "<" in your answer.  Just feel free to
grab  your  favourite text- editor, e.g CygnusED,
and  load the MIDAS.dat-file, that needs to be in
the  same  directory as MIDAS.  At first you will
find  three  introductions  and  after  a CR-line
three errors.  You can edit this file as often as
you want it.  But keep the following rules:

 Please answer me this Question:  \
 What about this , MIDAS:          > Introductions
 Can you please response this:    /
                                  > free CR-Line
 No way today!                    \
 More precise, please!             > Errors
 Unable to find match             /
                                  > End of file

Dont for get to end every line with the Returnkey
directly after the text.
