   Ndebt is a small program that will shock your sensibilities:  Ndebt
   opens a small window on your Workbench screen and each second displays
   a large number -- the current US national debt.

   Ndebt is public domain and may be freely distributed.

   You may start Ndebt from CLI, or from Workbench by clicking its icon.
   From CLI there is no need to "RUN Ndebt"; it will detach itself.

   You can drag and depth-arrange the window or click its go-away gadget.
   Of course the national debt won't go away, just the program.
  
   You'll be surprised how much the national debt grows each second.  This
   program is intended to be an educational and entertaining one.

   The national debt is projected from data taken from the Survey of
   Current Business c. January, 1989.  A straight line fit is fairly
   accurate and is what Ndebt uses to predict the national debt.
