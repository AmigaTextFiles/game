@node Introduction

@{u}Welcome to the wonderfull world of SUCKS!@{uu}

@{b}STAY COOL OR STAY AWAY!@{ub}


Please read this documentation carefully, otherwise this program may SUCKS!

MagicLocker is a small shell-tool which can be used for securing a directory
or device.
What does securing mean? This means, that nobody can use, abuse or delete
the files after they have been locked with MagicLocker!

If you don't want to secure something (only whimps do this...)
you should use "Dont" (also a nice SUCKS-program) for this.


MagicLocker was successfully tested with the following configurations:

   · A500/000, OS 1.3, 0.5 chip, 4 fast missing, HD missing
   · A500+/010, OS 2.0, 1 chip, 2 fast, 52M HD
   · A600/000, OS 2.1, 2 chip, 4 fast, 1.2G HD, 12 Diskdrives
   · A1000/000, OS 1.1, 1 chip, 3.512 fast, 111M HD
   · A1000/010, OS 1.3, 0.5 chip, 0 fast, 111M HD, CD-Rom, Streamer
   · A1200/020, OS 3.0, 2 chip, 12 fast, crashed HD, 4 Joysticks
   · A1200/040, OS 3.1, 2 chip, 0 fast, 20M HD, CD-Rom
   · A2000/030, OS 2.1, 1 chip, 4 fast, 1.2G HD
   · A3000/030, OS 3.1, 2 chip, 8 fast, 999M HD, 10 CD-Roms, 16G Streamer
   · A3000/030, OS 3.1, 2 chip, 16 fast, 540M HD, 2 CD-Roms
   · A4000/030, OS 3.0, 2 chip, 0 fast, 100M HD, Laserplayer 
   · A4000/040, OS 3.1, 2 chip, 128 fast, 2x9G HD, 5 CD-Roms
   · A5000/060, OS 4.0ß, 16 chip, 256 fast, 740G HD, 2.4G MO-Drive


Problems may occur on the following configurations:

   · A1000/000, OS 1.0, 0 chip, 0 fast, 0M HD, no Diskdrive
   · 486DX2-66, DOS3.3, 64MB memory   (MagicLocker needs more memory...!)
   · Pentium, OS/2, 16MB memory   (MagicLocker needs more power...!)




And this is what Beavis and Butthead say about MagicLocker...

@node Usage


@{u}Usage:@{uu} MagicLocker <@{" dir " Link dir}> @{" lock " Link lock}|@{" unlock " Link unlock}


If you supply no option to MagicLocker, it will use the lock-switch as default.

@endnode

@node dir
@prev Usage

DIR

MagicLocker needs this argument for any operation.

You need to supply a device- or directory-name with the files that 
should be secured.
For example, "sys:" or "sys:wbstartup".


@endnode

@node lock
@prev Usage

LOCK

This switch indicates, that the files in the supplied directory should be
locked.


@{u}Examples:@{uu} "MagicLocker sys: lock" will secure your complete System-partition
         
          "MagicLocker sys:wbstartup lock" will secure your wbstartup-drawer

@endnode

@node unlock
@prev Usage

UNLOCK

This switch tells MagicLocker to unlock all the files in the supplied 
directory or device.


@{u}Example:@{uu} "MagicLocker sys:wbstartup unlock"

@{u}Program history:@{uu}


@{b}Version 1.0 (11.11.94):@{ub}

   · --- Initial SUCKS-release ---


(Versions 0.1 - 0.111 were only released to my betatesters.)

@endnode
@node Future


@{b}I have lot of plans for future versions of MagicLocker:@{ub}

   · adding an AppIcon
     (I don't know what it should do, but AppIcons are cool...)

   · adding an ARexx port, 
     so that you can write lots of sucking ARexx-scripts for MagicLocker...

   · adding a global-lock function, for completely locking your system

   · TCP/IP-support, for remotely locking files

   · implementing a commodity-interface with a nice GUI, lots of windows,
     listviews, gadgets and buttons...

   · implementing some nice patches into MagicLocker, because patches SUCK!

   · adding an unlock function for CD-Rom-files,
     so that you can gain some diskspace on the CD...
     (Currently I have no idea, how I should do it, but it WILL be done
      in the future, because SUCKS RULEZ!)

   · adding locale-support with hundreds of different languages for 
     global sucking...

   · rewrite it for use under NetBSD (for all those NetBSD-freaks...)

   · raising the shareware-fee...  hehe... this will really SUCK!!!


The next version will not be 1.1, but 2.0, because MAJOR releases cost you
more money...  :-)

@node Registration

Since version 1.0 of MagicLocker has been finished, it is a product with
the SUCKS quality brand.

The advantages, which grow out of this are well known...  >;-)


Before you register, you have the opportunity to test MagicLocker in great
detail. However, the unregistered version may SUCKS, because it is
totally crippled.

In spite of all this restrictions it should be possible to see if 
MagicLocker is what you expect (Trust me, IT IS! :-).
The evaluation version expires on 11.11.2011 at 11:11:11.

When registering you'll get your personal SUCKS-keyfile for MagicLocker
which unlocks all crippled features... but maybe not all new features
that I will implement in future releases of MagicLocker!

Especially for MAJOR updates a NEW keyfile is needed, but this will cost
you additional money!


If you like even the unregisterd version of MagicLocker you MUST contribute
another piece of SUCKWARE!


Send your money to any SUCKS-registration-sides or directly to the @{"Author" Link Address}.
