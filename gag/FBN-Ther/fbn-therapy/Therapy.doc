Therapy is a little test of some programming techniques.

Make sure you copy the translator.library to your Libs: directory and
the narrator.device to your Devs: directory.

*DO NOT* use the old translator.library and narrator.device from the
1.3 system.  These are new files with more functions added.  They still
work the same, but there are a few new tricks.  If you don't use these
files, the doc won't talk.

To ensure proper running, make sure the FBN.16.hri, Therapy.8.hr, and
Therapy files are in the same directory.

If you like the program, or if you hate it, drop me a line and let me know.
