  But first, lemme ask ya one little question...


  Is Paul dead?


  You be the judge.


  I suppose it was just a happy coincidence that a few months before his

death they held a "Paul Look-Alike" contest.  Was the Paul from that time

forward merely an imposter??

  Is Paul dead?

  There were many clues.


  28 IF.

  That's how old he would have been IF he had lived.

  That was the license plate number of the Volkswagen in the background on

the cover of Abbey Road.

  28 IF.


  On the same cover, John leads the way dressed in white, the symbol of the

church, Ringo follows in black, the undertaker.  Paul is next, barefoot, as

is the custom to bury their dead in the East (you remember, the Beatles had

been heavy into the Eastern ways for a few years then..), and George trails

behind, dressed in jeans and a workshirt...the grave digger.

  Coincidence?

  You be the judge.


  In Magical Mystery Tour, all the other Beatles have red roses in their

  lapels, Paul has a black one, the Eastern symbol for the deceased.  

  Again, you be the judge.


  And there were many other clues as well.

  Including audio ones.


  Supposedly, one part of "Revolution #9", the last cut on The Beatles'

  White album, played backwards and cleaned up a bit, sounds like the car

  crash that apparently claimed his life.


  I wouldn't know.


  But also from that song, the voice that says "number nine...number nine..",

  played backwards, sounds like he's saying "Turn me on, dead man...turn me

  on, dead man..."    


  Yes, it's...Satanic Music!!!


  Once again, you be the judge.



  So here's the voice saying "number nine...", forwards and backwards, as

  well as your own Special BenchMaster Bonus Treat...


  The very, and I mean VERY last few seconds of "Strawberry Fields Forever",

  where the voice says  ".....  I  .....  buried  .....  Paul  ....."


  No collection is complete without them!
