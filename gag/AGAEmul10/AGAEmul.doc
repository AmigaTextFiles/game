What is AGAEmul, by the way?

 Well, what can I say... It emulates the AGA-chipset in a very smart way...
By patching some strategic adresses in your GFX-system, you will be able to run
several AGA-games and softwares, like DPaint v5.0...

 Now, since this emulates the AGA-chipset, it isn't of course very fast... But you
will soon notice that it's fast enough for DPaint-kinda-software...

 I haven't got time to write a proper technical documentation on this piece of 
software, but you will understand the usage real soon...

 You start the program with AGAEmul and the Kickstartnumber... so if you have
Kickstart v1.3, you just write AGAEmul 1.3 and so on...

 There are some online messages to guide you through this emulation...



GOOD LUCK on your new AGA-CHIPSET...
