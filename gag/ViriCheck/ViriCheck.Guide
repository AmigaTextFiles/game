 @{b}What this is :@{ub}

     Firstly this IS NOT a real virus checker it is a joke program to get someone you hate 
 or want to scare. This program is best used on Amiga newbies as there are some giveaways 
 that an expert Amiga user would notice like when it checks the Clock for Viruses.

     I wrote this program to scare a mate of mine into thinking his processor has viruses 
 on :) hehehe so it's useful if you want to scare someone. I hope you like this program. 
 This program is harmless and all it does is say that the processor has 368 viri on and 
 then crashes out the computer but just take note of the Legal Stuff as I CAN NOT be held 
 responsible if this really does damage your computer.

     Please, please, please upload this anywhere or put it in any Amiga collection. If
 a magazine wants to inclued this on their cover Cd/Disk then please get in touch first.
 If you would like to put this on compilation disks or CDs then that is fine, DO NOT make
 any money from this except charge of copying.
