Program:   Muncho
By:        Andrew Werth

"Muncho" is a cute little program which plays a digitized sample when
you insert or remove a disk from your disk drive.  Upon insertion of a
disk into any Amiga drive, you hear "GULP."  When you take the disk out
of the drive, the computer responds appropriately with "YUCK!"

To start the program, you will probably want to type "RUN MUNCHO".  If
at any time you want to terminate the program, click on the close box
of the small muncho window.  (I had a little problem in deallocating
memory, so you will lose a couple of 'k' if you do close the program.)

The digitized samples which you hear when you run the program are found
in the files "Diskin.snd" and "Diskout.snd".  You may replace these
files with any digitized sample file.  The file must be saved in the
DUMP format, not IFF, and should be recorded at a frequency of about
10,000 samples/sec (standard Perfect Sound dump).

(Er, those GULP and YUCK noises you hear are me, if you have a digitizer,
you can make them more interesting   :-)

Have fun.
