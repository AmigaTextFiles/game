SpleenWort 1.0 by Christoph Borst (mohawk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)   Nov 8, 1992

This is a hack that generates a fractal (IFS) fern on your WorkBench screen.

There are two versions; one that uses FFP functions for calculations,
and one that requires a 68881 or 68882 fp coprocessor.

The fern *should* automatically generate at the appropriate size
for the WorkBench screen from which it is loaded.

The fern will ONLY be drawn on the background color (0) of your WorkBench,
so certain WBpatterns may prevent it from being seen.

In the upper left, a title bar appears; click the close gadget to quit.

bye        -:)
