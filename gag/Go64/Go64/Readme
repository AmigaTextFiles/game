Designing  a "fully-compatible" Commodore-64-Emulator seems to  be the
'in thing' these days - so I made my Aztec 3.4a work for you. And now,
after endless hours of developing, I'm proud to present...


                    THE COMMODORE 64 EMULATOR


Have you ever seen a transformer that takes less than 5 KB (!) to make
you happy? Well, here  it is! It's all done in C, which  will make  it 
easy to add routines (if any!).

But...to tell the truth...well...it's not a real transformer at all...
it's just another screen hack. But I think it's enough to make  a wolf 
whistle...
