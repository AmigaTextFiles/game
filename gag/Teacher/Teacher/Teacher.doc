Teacher

A hack

by Jonathan Potter, March 1989

Teacher is a short, simple hack. Please, run it before looking at the source,
so you don't spoil any surprises that it may entail.
Also, be warned, that Teacher may, occasionally GURU.. I can see no way of
fixing this, so it's best if there are no other prominent tasks running;
also, there should be no non-dos disks in any of the drives.

Jon.
