DEMOlition - A display hack inspired by a  demo  seen  on  a  BBC
	     micro a long time ago.

The program is best run with a few windows open on the  workbench
screen.  To  stop  it, bring the workbench screen to the front by
typing A-N or by dragging DEMOlition's screen from the title bar,
and click the mouse on DEMOlition's close gadget.

This demo just screams (pardon the pun)  for  sound.  After  some
initial  attempts  (and lots of Guru meditations), I decided that
it would be best to post the code without sound,  and  hope  that
some Amiga guru (the nice kind) will take a liking to the program
and add the sound him/herelf.

The program compiles successfully with Manx 16 bits. I've no idea
what it does with Lattice.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:
I used Stephen Coy's "Melt" demo as a template, to make a copy of
the Workbench screen and handle the close gadget. Only the action
code is different. Stephen placed no restriction on the usage  of
his  code,  so  it  is  only  fair  that  I  should not place any
restrictions in mine. Use, abuse, modify or mutilate  it  as  you
see fit.

Enjoy!
