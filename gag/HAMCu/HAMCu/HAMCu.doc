Ever been bored by the standard 4 colour workbench? The boring 8 colour
workbench? Worry no more, 'cause now you can wb in HAM!

Actually the title and description are a bit misleading; firstly this
program has nothing to do with HAM mode, and secondly, it's not really a
4096 colour workbench.

All HAMCu does it install a custom copper list for the current active view
(usually workbench) that contains all the colours from 0x000 to 0xfff..
a neat effect, and a good easy way to show off the colour capabilities of
the Amiga.

HAMCu installs a message port, that it looks for before running, so
running it actually toggles; ie, run it once to turn on HAMCu, and again
to turn it off (although sometimes this doesn't work; dunno why, but you
just have to keep running it until it does).

HAMCu doesn't look as good on ntsc (200 line) systems; it still works,
just messes up at the bottom. It's better to have it mess up at the
bottom, instead of all the way through, which it would if I made it work
on 200 lines. 224x256 (the constraints of a copper list) is an even
multiple of 4096, 224x200 isn't...

I would not try dragging or depth arranging screens while this is running;
not bad, just sloooooooow!

Anyway, enjoy your multi-multicoloured workbench!

Jon.
