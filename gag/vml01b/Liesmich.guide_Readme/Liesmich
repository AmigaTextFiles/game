@node ueber "About the VML Programm"

This is the first Version of my little "just 4 fun" lifeform project,
it shows 3 different colored lifeforms and 3 flashing eaters witch are
eating the slime of the colored ones.

For now - it is just a Joke but in the next Versions it will be more
intelligent with the following adds:

- More Lifeforms
- Move Saving in SYS:T to a File that every Lifeform can read, understand
  and learn to move better from this public walk file.
- When two different Species meet, one of them kill the other and gets one
  or two babies.
- When two same Species meet, they will bring u a new colored lifeform, with
  other new intelligent levels.
- little talk tool that lets communicate two lifeforms, or one lifeform with
  the user.
- and many more (i have many funny ideas)
