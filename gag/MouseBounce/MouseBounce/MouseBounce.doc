MouseBounce

a game/hack

By Jonathan Potter, April 1989

MouseBounce is a short (3k) hack/game that makes your mouse pointer bounce
around the screen. The idea is to close the MouseBounce window and exit the
game.. easy you think? Not so (I've only done it once).
To make things worse, every time you click the mouse button, the pointer
speeds up..
After 20 clicks, it exits anyway, because by then it is going too fast to
do anything..
