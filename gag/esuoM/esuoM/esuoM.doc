                   esuoM - Backwards Mouse!

INTRODUCTION

This program is a simple little screen hack.  When installed, it causes
the mouse pointer to move in the opposite direction of the mouse.  When
you move the mouse to the right, the pointer goes to the left;  when
you move the mouse forward, the pointer goes down, etc.  If you want to
get really confused, install and remove the program several times just
as you are getting used to it!

The program installs in input handler which intercepts any mouse movements
and reverses them before sending them on to other applications.  This is
a standard Amiga method of modifying the input stream, so it should work
well with most other applications running.  (I did notice an interesting
and unexpected interaction with ROBOTROFF - you should try it!)

This program was compiled with Lattice C 4.01.  It must be compiled with
the -y option, which makes the interrupt handler routine load the pointer
to the data segment into A4.  The program will crash if this option is not
specified.
 
INSTALLATION

This program can be run either from the CLI or the Workbench.  From the
CLI type:

    run esuoM

From the Workbench, just double click on the esuoM icon.  The program
will then install itself and start messing with your mouse and your mind.

REMOVAL

To remove the program, simply (?) click on the close gadget on the little
esuoM window.  The program will then remove itself, and your mouse will
be normal again.
