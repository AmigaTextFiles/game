@node "how" "HOW TO QUIT TVAP"

 To quit TVAP, simply start the program again. By CLI or WB doesn't matter.
Or delete the file "T:TVAP.tmp"!

@node "intro" "Introduction to TVAP"

  I wanted to do something half-mean-funny to my friend. I downloaded
 some gag-programs from BBS:s and AmiNet. Some of them were pretty good and
 I was quite pleased with them. However none of them did exactly what I
 wanted them to. So, I decided to write one myself.
 That way I now have a program that I know doesn't do any bad stuff (like
 formatting the HD) to my computer (or my poor friend's).

 The program doesn't slow down your computer noticeably and can be exited.
@endnode

@node "req" "Requirements for TVAP"

 TVAP @{u}should@{uu} work on any computer. But it requires the assign "T:" and
problably a lot of patience (if you set the @{"seed" link "use" 5} low)!

Please note that to be able to use the requester-gag (K) you have to have OS
2.0 or higher. TVAP will auto-detect which OS you are running and disable this
gag if run on OS 1.x
@endnode

@node "use" "Usage of TVAP"

 TVAP can be started both from CLI and Workbench. CLI is recommended since
any possible error messages won't be displayed when runnig from WB. To start
TVAP simply doubleclick on it's icon in WB or type it's name in CLI.
 An argument containing a number between 5 and 10000 can be passed. The
bigger number, the smaller chance for something happening every second. If
no argument is passed, this number will default to 50.

 To easier illustrate how TVAP works, take a look at this 'flowchart':
 
 
                           TVAP is started
                                  |
            Checks if it is already running, if so; it quits
                                  |
     Generates a random number between 0 and the number passed as an
     SEED=argument, if no argument was passed a number between 0 and 50 is
                              generated
                                  |
     If the number was smaller than 10 then a random gag is performed,
                      otherwise nothing happens
                                  |
       Waits 1 second (so that too many gags won't follow in a row)
                                  |
                        Generates a random number ...
                        
  
 So by increasing the number passed as argument, the chances for something
happning decrease. Of course the opposite apply.

To @{b}quit@{ub} TVAP, simply start the program again!
@endnode

@node "cfg" "Configuration of TVAP"

 TVAP is configured by the arguments or tooltypes passed to the program.
They are both quite similair but since the tooltypes can be saved they can
sometimes be more flexible.
Also, the requester can not be configured from CLI.

 The tooltypes are ignored when TVAP is started from CLI and vice versa.

  @{b}CLI Arguments@{ub}

 The following CLI-arguments are available:

?      -Shows which arguments that are available.
S=     -Sets the seed used by the program.
B      -Turns off the moving mouse-pointer.
C      -Turns off the single click of the left mouse button.
D      -Turns off the short holding-down of the left mouse button.
E      -Turns off the double click of the left mouse button.
F      -Turns off the press of the left mousebutton.
G      -Turns off the release of the left mousebutton.
H      -Turns off the scary face and sound.
I      -Turns off the text typing gag.
J      -Turns off the display-beep gag.
K      -Turns off the requester gag.
T=     -Sets the text used by the text typing gag.
         This text may NOT contain any spaces.
         By default this is "TVAP".
V      -Shows which gags that are activated
N      -Forces TVAP not to quit this time. Good to use in conjuntion with the
         "V"-command.

 Example:
"TVAP SEED=250 H TEXT=Annoying?"
 This sets the seed to 250, turns off the scary face and makes TVAP type
"Annoying?" when the text typing gag is used.

  @{b}Tooltypes@{ub}

 The tooltypes are the same as the CLI-arguments with the following
exceptions:

"?", "V" and "N" are NOT included as tooltypes.
"S=" is replaced by "SEED=".
"T=" is replaced by "TEXT=".
"RTITLE=" is used to set the requester title. If not provided it will default
 to " TVAP Request"
"RTEXT=" is used to sed the requester body text. Lines can be separated with a
 "|"-character. If not provided it will default to
 "Operation not completed.|Please choose:"
"RBUTTON=" is used to set the requester button(s). To incluse more than one
 button, separate them with a "|"-character. If not provided it will default to
 "Increase sin-factor|Substract Y-variable"

@endnode

@node "ggs" "Gags available"

 TVAP can at the moment perform these gags (Control-character for gag within
brackets):

 Moving mousepointer (B)   - The mousepointer is moved to a randomly selected
                             position on the screen.
 Single click (C)          - The left mouse button is clicked once
 Short holding-down (D)    - The left mouse button is held down a short while
 Double-click (E)          - The left mouse button is clicked twice
 Mouse-press (F)           - The left mouse button is pushed and held down
 Mouse release (G)         - The left mouse button is released (after F)
 Scary face (H)            - Flashes a scary (?) face and a dog barking is
                             heard at the same time
 Text-typing (I)           - Types a short text into the currently used window
 Display-Beep (H)          - The WB-screen flashes as configured in WB-Prefs
 Requester (I)             - Calls up a requester to fool the user into
                             thinking that something is wrong

@node "his" "History of TVAP"

  History of TVAP - The Very Annoying Program.
 
 @{b}v1.0@{ub}
  First release.
 
 @{b}v1.1@{ub}
  Added scary face and sound. Picture made by @{"me" link "aut" 0} and sound found on an old
 HD, author unknown.
  Changed default @{"seed" link "use" 5} to 50.
  Optimized code by removing some extranous lines.
  Changed the mouse-moving routine [to the better?].
  Changed the hold down and let go of the right mousebutton routine into
 two separate events. This way; the mousebutton COULD be held forever
 (unless the user clicks the button).

 @{b}v1.2@{ub}
  Added the text-typing gag.
  Added tooltypes.
  More complex arguments possible.
  Possible to turn off certain gags.
  Built in help added.
  Rewrote some functions (optimized the program..).
  There was something more but I've forgotten what it was...

 @{b}v1.3@{ub}
  Tooltypes finally works
  Displaybeep gag added
  Requester gag added
  Noquit-argument added
  Evaluate-argument added
  CLI-arguments now work 100% (I hope :-) )
  CLI-arguments now override tooltypes
  Some system texts have been changed

@endnode

@node "fut" "Future versions of TVAP"

  Future versions of TVAP will hopefully include this:
  
 -Even more gags (such as moving windows)
 -More flexible checking if TVAP is already running
 
 
  Of course, @{"I" link "aut" 0} do more than happily recive more suggestions!
@endnode

@node "aut" "Author of TVAP"

  This program was written by Gustav "Gosweede" Gnosspelius 1997-1998.
 I (Gustav Gnosspelius) take no responsibility for any damage TVAP may cause
you or your computer. (It won't hopefully).

 You may contact me by email at @{b}gosweede@lindesign.se@{ub}. Please send me
all kind of suggestions concerning TVAP and of course also criticism.
If you discover a bug; PLEASE TELL ME!

 I would be very happy if someone send me a new icon to use for TVAP. Also, any
users of OS 1.x and 3.1 are welcome to tell me how TVAP runs on their machines.
Please contact me.

 Finally, I'd like to excuse for messy layout of the guide, layout isn't my
greatest talent. 


 Greetings goes to:
 @{i}LotuZ@{ui} (Will there be a Hype'99?)
 @{i}Mopz@{ui}  (What's _really_ going on?)
 @{i}!Lairfight!@{ui} (Haven't heard much from you lately?)
 @{i}Mr.Psycho@{ui} (How about som e schoolwork?)
 @{i}Dew_Led@{ui} (Where are you)
 @{i}All the nice people on Blitz-list@{ui} (You always have an answer..)
 And to the ones I forgot.
 
 
 
  TVAP was made in Blitz Basic 2.1 in 1998.
  The scary (?) picture was made in PPaint (Thank you AF).
