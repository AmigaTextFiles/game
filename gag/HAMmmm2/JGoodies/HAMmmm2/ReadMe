HAMmmm2   by Phil Burk

HAMmmm2 is in the public domain and may be freely redistributed.

HAMmmm2 is an updated version of HAMmmm. It adds two new graphic
drawing modes, "boxes" and "star".  It also changes
the intervals in the chord, and has updated addresses.

HAMmmm displays lines, or boxes, whose end points are bouncing around
the screen.  The screen is a double buffered HAM screen.
The top is painted with the HAM color "set red to zero".
The bottom is "set blue to zero".

The y positions of the points are continuously copied
into an audio waveform that is played on all four
channels.  The pitch of a just intoned chord is derived
from the average x position of these points.

This demo grew out of a short piece written for the
recent Harmonic Convergence.  I played a four part
celestial sounding chord using the Amiga local sound,
and put a blank formatted disk in drive 1.  My hope
was that when the galactic intelligence beamed it's
message to Earth that I would capture it directly
on disk and not have to type it in.  :-)

This Demo was written using JForth.  JForth was
written by Mike Haas, Brian Donovan and myself.
The sound portion used the local sound toolbox
from HMSL which I wrote with Larry Polansky
and David Rosenboom from the Mills College Center
for Contemporary Music.  You can compile HAMmmm,
without sound, using just JForth.  If you have
HMSL you can compile on top of that to get sound.

If you would like to compile HAMmmm, start either JForth
or HMSL as you are accustomed, CD to the HAMmmm directory,
then:

    INCLUDE LOAD_MMM
