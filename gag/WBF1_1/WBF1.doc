Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
           This is the new updated version of Workbench Formula One, the
basic idea of it is it opens up a WB window and a little Formula One car
zooms along it until it reaches the other side, thats it. This is only
a small WBHack type of program and only took me about 30 minutes to whip
up, that was mostly down to plotting where the cars next movement would
be.

What it does
~~~~~~~~~~~~
           All it does is brings up a WB window and a little Formula One
car goes shooting across a road below it.

Why???
~~~~~~
1. I was bored!!!
2. Someone else has made one called WBCar and I thought i'd make a better
   version.

How to get it working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          Just double click on the icon and the program will do the rest
itself. After the little animation has finished the program will quit
automaticly.

Thanks
~~~~~~
          Thanks goes to Paolo Cattani because the Formula One car in the
icon was ripped from the icon from his amazing racing game, Alien Formula
One. Hope he doesn't mind! Also thanks to Ian Hewitt who saw the very
first version and saying 'Wow'.

Future
