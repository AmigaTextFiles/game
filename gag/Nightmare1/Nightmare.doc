	NIGHTMARE   V1.0 -  1990 Patrick Evans
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is V1.0 of NightMare, a handy little program that uses "shock"
techniques to scare people.  This is a fun one to watch while someone else
is using your computer, as they will jump five feet out of their seat, and
make sure the volume is jammed waaaaay up!

	In the case you have heart trouble, you might as well know what the
program does.  Every five minutes, a picture of a skull is flashed for four
fifths of a second, along with a nice loud echoing scream.  The program
does not interupt any normal activities of the computer, except for a
momentary pull of the viewport, then back again.  The detach code was used
in this program, so that it can be run from CLI, or an execute, and start
itself as an independant task...  so your window will close no problem..
try sticking it in your startup-sequence!

	If someone has a V2.0 machine, I would appreciate you trying this
program out and tell me if it still works!  It should, as I didn't cut any
corners.....

	I place this program in Public Domain to be seen and used by everyone.
If you wish to have the source code to play with, to ask any questions, or
to make a donation (any would be appreciated!);

Go ahead and spread it!

Note:

Nightmare was posted to AmiNet by Joe Rothman of Mr. Hardware Computers.

I added this note, decrunched the executable so it would still run on a
68040 or better, and cleaned up the icon a little.

This program even works under AmigaDos 3.1 and it can be placed in the
WBStartup drawer.  This is just one of many older Amiga files, available on
A.M.U.G. BBS 516-234-6046, which still work so many years after they were
written.  Lots of our files are not available anywhere else.  A.M.U.G. is
one of the oldest continously running Amiga only BBS's in the world.

A.M.U.G. has been on-line since March 10th 1986.

A.M.U.G. is also the home of Mr. Hardware Computers your 100% Amiga dealer.
