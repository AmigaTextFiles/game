1. Introduction 
--------------- 
 
1.1 What is Mindwarp 3? 
 
Mindwarp 3 is a small program that creates colorful pictures. 
It was similar to mindwarp or syn2x on PC, but it will become 
larger and there are many features planned. 
 
1.2 Requirements 
 
- An Amiga computer with at least 68030. 
- Kickstart 3.0 (Not tested on 2.1) 
- MUI 
- GTI 16V
 
AGA or a graphics card is recommended. 
 
DON'T argue about MUI, if your computer is too slow for MUI, it's  
also too slow for mindwarp. 
 
The program is written using system routines, no hardware-bashing, 
it should work on almost every system. 
 
2. Installation 
 
Just copy the program and it's icon to the location you want. 
Use some 640x480 like screenmode!
 
3. Settings 
 
4. To-Do-List 
 
Planned features: 
 
- different color options for palette and newcolor function 
- presets for options 
- audio-support  
- new draw routines (i.e. plasma, fractals) 
- complete documentation :)

Use this program at your own risk! While testing, the program was 
quite stable, but don't blame me for any loss of data you suffered
