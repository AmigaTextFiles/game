WHAT IT DOES
------------
    Nothing usefull, but harmless.

    Use the sources as an example of different trics that can be
    done with intuition pointer and input device.


HOW IT WORKS
------------
    With some scotch, I suppose..


HOW TO USE IT
-------------
    Double-click to it's icon.



TO COMPILE
----------
    You MUST use Lattice C (3.10 or 3.03) to compile DrunkenMouse.
    I'm reasonably confident that it will NOT compile correctly with Manx C.

    The steps are:

        For all .c files:

           LC1 -ccws -oram: <file>
           LC2 -v -oRAM: ram:<file>
           copy ram:<file>.o to <file>.o


        Assembly handlerinterface.asm


        Link them all:

        BLINK with link
        (link file included)
