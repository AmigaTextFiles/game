    Twiddler 1.00

----------------------

    Are you one of those kinds of people who fidget a lot?  When you talk on
the phone, are you constantly bending paper clips, stretching rubber bands, 
or playing with the phone cord?

    I made Twiddler for you!
	
    A big part of my current job involves doing technical support, so I'm
on the phone for much of the day.  I was always scribbling, or playing with
little bits of paper, or rubber bands.  In my spare time, I wrote Twiddler
so I can twiddle without the mess!

    Twiddler offers multiple scribble/twiddle tools, and can be controlled
one-handed with the mouse.  Just hold the left or right mouse button and
drag the mouse to draw using the current tool, or click both mouse buttons
simultaneously to switch to the next tool.  Some tools behave differently
when you use them with the right mouse button instead of the left.

    (Okay, okay, there is ONE keyboard command -- ESC clears the window.)

    WARNING: Twiddler is addictive, and can distract you from what you're
supposed to be working on.

    Now go Twiddle.
	
	
	
Program info:

    This program is EMAIL-WARE!  If you use it, and like it, send me email
at stevenf@europa.com, and tell me what you SHOULD have been doing while
you were busy playing with Twiddler.  :)  Same address applies for bug
reports (bugs?  what bugs?) or suggestions.

    Otherwise, the program is freely-distributable, and permission is
explicitly given to Fred Fish to include this program in his library, 
should he deem it worthy.  :)

    Written in SAS/C on an A2000/040 (2.04 ROM)
    Enforcer/MungWall tested
	
Author info:

    Twiddler was written by Steven Frank.  I'm perhaps more well-known 
for my commercial terminal program "Termite".  :)

    I also made the icons for Twiddler, but don't ask me how they're
relevant to the program in any way.
