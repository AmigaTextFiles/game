When  I was playing with the input.device strange and "diabolic" ideas
crossed  my  mind.   In  the  spirit  of  display hacks "Mischief" was
created.  It is the ideal tool to scare beginners from using the Amiga
("There's a ghost in the machine!").  I don't want to tell you what it
does, consult the program source code if you really want to know about
it.   But  be  sure  that  none  of  the  actions "Mischief" makes are
destructive.   Still  you  have  to  be  careful with windows you drag
around.  If anything begins to act strange, drop the window as soon as
you can.
