What's Eye:
   it's  an  Amiga implementation of the famous XEye that you can see on every
   X-Window  terminal  or  Mac.   Just run it and a couple of eyes will follow
   your mouse pointer from the screen.

Usage from the CLI:
   just type "Eye" to run it with default parameters or specify any of these
   qualifiers to change something:

      X:  coordinate of the left edge of the window;
      Y:  coordinate of the top edge of the window;
      Width:  width of the window;
      Height:  height of the window;
      PupilRay:  size of the pupils (as percentage of the whole eyes);
      Strabism:  percentage of strabism;
      PupilColor:  color of the pupils;
      ScleroticColor:  color of the sclerotic;
      MakeUpColor:  color of the eyes' border;
      BgColor:  background color;
      TaskPri:  Eye's task priority;
      PubScreen:  name of the public screen where to open the window (it's case
                  sensitive).

   By default Eye assumes the following parameters:

   Eye X=150 Y=0 Width=59 Height=34 Strabism=0 PupilRay=45 PupilColor=1
       ScleroticColor=2 MakeUpColor=1 DefaultBg=0 TaskPri=0 PubScreen=Workbench

   (on hires non-laced screens its default size is Width=63 Height=26)

   Type "Eye help" to get a help message.

Usage from the Workbench:
   double  click  on  the  icon.  If you want to modify some parameters, click
   once on the icon and select Icons/Information from the Workbench menu, then
   edit  the  tool  types.   The  available  tool  types  are  the same as the
   parameters from the shell (as well as the default values).

   An example set of tool types is:
      X=50
      Y=50
      Width=200
      Height=100
      PubScreen=Workbench

Interactive features:
   Whenever  the  Eye's window is selected, clicking the menu button pops up a
   requester  with some informations about this program.  Moreover clicking on
   the  eyes  or inserting/removing disks makes the pupils rotate and the tiny
   gadget  near the bottom right corner of the window behaves exactly like the
   usual size gadget.

Requirements:
   Eye  only  requires you to have an Amiga with at least kickstart version 36
   and  a  little free memory (less than 17 kbytes with the default size, plus
   an eventual 3.5 kbytes for the math libraries).
   If you have too little memory for Eye to allocate its bitmaps, it will just
   quit.   This may happen even when you resize it and not only when you first
   start it, anyway you will be warned with a requester if it's possible.

Bugs:
   DON'T  CHANGE  THE HUNK STRUCTURE!!!  The manipulations of the SegList made
   to  let  this program run as a background process need the first hunk to be
   EXACTLY  as  it is!  This program can be unharmfully compressed but without
   hunk merging.
