  Darn!  There it is again, the upside-down pic.  You're sitting around with

the family, showing slides from your camping trip, here's the picture of that

beautiful lake...and it's upside-down!  "Aw-w, Dad, you screwed up AGAIN!",

that brat son of yours shouts from the couch.  Well, don't give it a minute's

thought, it happens to everybody.


  Including those watching your computer slide show.


  These pics are for a slideshow program that includes a feature to turn on

the color cycling.  Load them up in the middle of your show, and listen to

the audience laugh as you groan out loud, "Dang!  That ALWAYS happens!!"

  That's Waterfall1.




  Then comes Waterfall2, and danged if something STILL doesn't look right!


  Then you get it right with Waterfall3, to everyone's applause. 

  (and relief)

  Enjoy!
