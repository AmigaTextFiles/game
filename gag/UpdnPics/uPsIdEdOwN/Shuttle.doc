  You know how one slide always gets put in upside down?  Seems to happen

everywhere:  Military briefing at the Pentagon, at the Elk's Club, in the

home...  Well, here's a computer version of the ol' Shuttle.


  When the first pic's displayed, say "Darn!  One got in upside-down..",

maybe hit a few fake keys, then show the second one, saying "There!".


  The joke is that obviously there IS no "up" or "down" in space...but

everybody else will think they're just slow for not having noticed the

upside-down pic as quickly as you did. ;)








Enjoy!
