This is what you have been waiting for...
Attention - program works only with kickstart >2.04!!!

Just start Sheep from CLI or doubble-click the Icon from the WB.
There are no parameters or tooltypes... and then....enjoy....

Oh, sorry, i forgot, there are a few gadgets...

   -I-   this is a little info-screen...
   -3-   this is the default speed. by pressing this gad, the speed
         changes from 1,2,3 or 4 (1 is the fastest)
   -S-   Toggle the Sound On/Off ... allowing the sheeps to scream.
   -B-   This button displays the "Hi-Scores", which will be saved
         every time the window is closed. Also the Speed, the windows's
         position and the Sound will be remembered.

Since Version V1.2, the Window is Font-sensitiv. So the WindowBar can
be sometimes big on some screens. I use an 8 pixel font, so I don't use
this feature. The gads in the windows still have the old topaz 8, and
I don't think, this will be changed...

The counter will count the sheeps until 999999. (dangerous - not tested) B)
Also, on Interlace-screens, this programm won't look like I wanted... but
I do not interlace my eyes, so there won't be support for it.

V1.0 - Initial Release

V1.2 - Window is now font-sensitiv.
     - 'High-Score' added.

V1.4 - Sound (-option) added
     - Pause removed - use Info instead
     - Shooting up the sheep may be in there B)
     - Source removed from distribution-archive
       Contact me for getting this hot source !

To do for V1.5:

- arexx-port ? any need of this B))
- other animals ? - i'm not a good painter...sorry
- support for KS1.3 - nope

Ah, I forgot to say. The use of this program is at your OWN RISK !
I'm not interested in any bug reports...but I think, there are not much
bugs in it B)

So, if you wanna contact me, you can call our chat-system... the
telebim-nummer is in the program, just press the -I-Button...
Hope I see you in chat soon...

At last, some greetings to:

Spacie, Crissa, Uncle, Ramirez, Aro, Gandalf, Fips, Max, Triac, Ente, Vossy,
Marsipulami, Wolverine, Sidewinder, Atlan, Elec, Dodo, Outline, Riffer
and all guys who use my programs...

Ciao - Paccy
