	SWISH -  1990 - Patrick Evans
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Swish is a small, simple screen hack that pushes the screen around
using the view port, and simulates a floating motion.  This is extremely
annoying!  You shouldn't have much trouble clicking the kill gadget once
the program has begun...

	I place this program in Public Domain to be seen and used by everyone,
but retain all copyrights to the ideas and program.  If you wish to have
the source code to play with, to make a donation, or to ask any questions,

Go ahead and spread it!
