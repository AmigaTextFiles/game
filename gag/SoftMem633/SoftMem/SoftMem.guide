Introduction
************

   Have you ever felt the need for more RAM for your Amiga in order to
run big applications? Do you agree that RAM is overprized? If you you
can answer both questions with "Yes" then SoftMem, a revolutionary
product for the Amiga computer, is just the right thing for you.

   Instead of having to buy new RAM modules, you can simply run SoftMem
which will compress your memory using some very sophisticated
compression algorithms which offer an excellent compression factor and
are still blazingly fast. SoftMem will automatically adjust the
compression parameters in order to make enough room to *double* your
memory!

   In addition to memory enlargement SoftMem also reduces system load
by rescheduling the running tasks. This is made possible by some
patches to exec.library.

   Your course that much functionality has its price. Several years of
development time have been used to create SoftMem (See @{"History" Link "HIS"}, for
details) and it has grown to quite a large program (version 6.33 has a
size of 42KB!), a good prove for the many fantastic features it offers.

   SoftMem is dareware. How dare you use it without paying??? For a
mere US$33 a full registered version of SoftMem can be yours! Special
offers for the UK and Germany are also available for UKP60 and DM170.
See @{"Support" Link "SUP"}, for my address if you decide to register (how dare you not
register?!).

   In this evaluation version the preferences saving is disabled and no
command line interface is available. That means you'll always have to
set your preferences every time you start SoftMem.

Installation
************

   The installation of this evaluation version is very simple. All you
have to do is install the supplied version of `triton.library' which is
used for the GUI.

Usage
*****

   Of course SoftMem is very flexible and thus offers some
user-configurable settings:

   * FastMem

     If checked your FastMem will be doubled.

   * ChipMem

     If checked your ChipMem will be doubled.

   * Reschedule

     If checked the task rescheduling will be activated, reducing the
     overall system load. An estimation for the current and the new
     load is given.

   * Kiske

     Lets you specify the desired amount of Kiskometer hits.  (For
     advanced users only!)

   After setting your preferences click `Install' in order to install
SoftMem.

History
*******

   *Note:* Versions before 6.28 have been left out.

   * 6.27

     Optimized the code. Had to do it all on my own. That crap
     assembler must be broken! Well, now it's working better anyway.
     Nothing can beat 100% assembler coding!

   * 6.28

     Just felt like bumping the revision.

   * 6.29

     Changed the patch installation routine. Now only one Enforcer hit
     is thrown instead of 13 ones as in earlier versions. Well, who
     cares about Enforcer hits anyway...

   * 6.30

     Changed the protection scheme of the registered version so that it
     will also run on the new A1200s. (Darn, why did they have to use
     different disk drives???)

   * 6.31

     Just felt like bumping the revision.

   * 6.32

     Fixed a bug in the code for calculating the stack size.

   * 6.33

     Evaluation release.
