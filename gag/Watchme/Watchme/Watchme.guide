@NODE "introduction" "Introduction - What is Watchme"

	Watchme is another so-called "pointereyes" program, i.e. two eyes
        in a window that always look at your mouse pointer.

	The reason I wrote Watchme was that I couldn't find any good program
	of this type on Aminet. They either looked bad or were awfully slow
	or both.

	Features:
	---------

	-No dirty hack, 100% system compatible, uses system routines only
	-100% multitasking friendly
	-simple, but looks nice
	-fast(!)
	-Versions for several types of CPUs:
	 Watchme_000:    For AMIGAs with a 68000 / 68010
	 Watchme_020:    For AMIGAs with a 68020 / 68030
	 Watchme_020FPU: For AMIGAs with a 68020+FPU / 68030+FPU
	 Watchme_040FPU: For AMIGAs with a 68040+FPU
	 Watchme_060FPU: For AMIGAs with a 68060+FPU
	-configurable via many @{" options " LINK "usage"}: size, lens size, pubscreen,...
	-uses @{" screennotify.library " LINK requirements} copyright (C) 1995 Stefan Becker, so no
	 problems when changing the screen mode (WB)
	-Adapts to the screen mode: no elliptical eyes when switching e.g.
	 from Highres interlace to Highres or vice versa
	-Works fine with CGFX (I was told so)

@NODE "requirements" "Requirements - What do you need"

	Requirements:
	-------------

	-An AMIGA :)
	-OS 2.04+
	-Fastmem (Watchme also works on systems with Chipram only, but
	 because Chipram is very slow you won't be happy with the graphics
	 output!)
	-screennotify.library (Aminet: util/libs/ScreenNotify10.lha)

@NODE "install" "Installation - Where to copy the files"

	1. Watchme requires screennotify.library (C) 1995 Stefan Becker.
	   If you don't have it already installed you can get it from
	   Aminet:util/libs/ScreenNotify10.lha. Copy it to your LIBS:
	   directory.

	2. Choose the right version of Watchme that suits your configuration:

	   Watchme_000:		for AMIGAs with a 68000 / 68010
	   Watchme_020:		for AMIGAs with a 68020 / 68030
	   Watchme_020FPU	for AMIGAs with a 68020+FPU / 68030+FPU
	   Watchme_040FPU	for AMIGAs with a 68040+FPU
	   Watchme_060FPU	for AMIGAs with a 68060+FPU

	   Copy it to wherever you like (Icon/NewIcon optionally).

@NODE "usage" "Usage - Options"

	Watchme can be configured via severals options.

	@{" Tooltypes       " LINK tooltypes}	from Workbench
	@{" Shell arguments " LINK shell}	from Shell

	@{b}NOTE:@{ub}	Options given via Tooltypes are set @{u}BEFORE@{uu} options
		from Shell!

		This means:
		-if a boolean option is set via Tooltype this option is
		 activated, although it is not given in the shell command!
		-an option given in the shell command overwrites the setting
		 specified via Tooltype!

				Examples:
				---------

				X=10
				XPOS=100


	@{b}Y, YPOS:@{ub}		Sets the window's y-position. Defaults to -1

@NODE "limits" "Limitations - What does not work"

	-There is no limit to the SIZE. But if you set it too high, filling
	 the eyes won't work any more. This will happend with a SIZE of about
	 200 which results in a window of about 950x250 pixels on a
	 PAL:Superhighres Interlace screen! Is there really anybody who wants
	 that big eyes?! :)

	-The higher LS, LENSSIZE is set, the more the lenses look like
	 squares. This is because I draw them like this:

	 1. intuition.library/RectFill():

	    XXXXXX
	    XXXXXX
	    XXXXXX
	    XXXXXX

	2. Then I "clean" the corner points:

	     XXXX
	    XXXXXX
	    XXXXXX
	     XXXX

	 As you see, this is not a problem with small lens sizes, only if
	 they are too high. The same as above: Does really anybody want
	 50x50 pixels lenses?! :)

@NODE "history" "History - Version history"

	v1.0 (9.6.99)
	-------------

	-first version, released to Aminet

	v1.1 (13.6.99)
	--------------

	-fixed reading from an uninitialized variable which caused an
	 Enforcer hit. Many thanks to Luca 'Hexaae' Longone for his
	 SegTracker trace listing!

	-some tooltype abbreviations did not work. Fixed.

	-some changes in the eyes' drawing routine

	-decreased minimum size of window and minimum size of lens if running
	 on an 1:1 aspect ratio screen. Looks better now.

	-new tooltype: NT=NOTITLE/S to switch off the window title

	-added NewIcon by Luca 'Hexaae' Longone. Thanks!
