What is ThreeQuidWare?
======================

Put simply, ThreeQuidWare is a system where you pay the author Three pounds
because he was kind enough to write this program for you.
The address to write to is contained in the actual game, along with lots of
other boring texts. Why should you send me three quid? Because you won't see
any more games/utilities released as ThreeQuidWare unless I get a reasonable
response from you lot, I'm planning much better games in the future including
AGA specific ones, and a much wider variety of styles.
In return for your money I will send you a codesheet, and some cheats for
this game.

Why did you write this game?
============================

I am (still) unemployed, and was bored. Also, I wanted to try some new
routines out and this seemed the best way to do it. Read the texts in the
actual game for more info.

Using Fatal Mission 2.
======================

Right. FM2 uses AmigaDOS to load things. This should mean that:
A) YOU SHOULD NOT MUCK ABOUT WITH THE KEYBOARD/MOUSE WHILE IT IS LOADING!!!
   Because the workbench/CLI is still active underneath the FM2 screen,
   I have opened a big 'catch' window to catch key presses and this seems
   to be 100% effective at catching loose key presses.
   DO NOT try to multitask other programs as this will probably crash
   the machine.
B) You should be able to run the game DIRECTLY from any standard Amiga
   device including: Hard Drive, CD-ROM (Inc. CDTV - CD32), floppy disk,
   smart card, ram disk and lots of others that haven't been invented yet.
The game can be played entirely with joystick, keyboard, or a mixture of
both. I recommend resetting after using FM2 as it is rather untidy, but
the only program I found not to work after using FM2 is OctaMED.
If you are worried about playing FM2 from hard drive, disable it and use the
floppy, but I'd just like to say this:
The game only READS from disk, so should NEVER corrupt it.
FULL error checking is done while loading.
Only OS legal code is used while loading.
I've been quite happily playing the game on my Rochard52 and never had a
single error, even when writing the game, but please bear in mind I cannot
be held responsible if anything does go wrong.
Always keep a backup, regardless what programs you are using.
Drag the whole Fatal Mission 2 drawer to the destination device to Install.
WorkBench: Double click on the games icon to start.
CLI/Shell: 'cd' to the directory with Fatal Mission 2 in, i.e:
           cd df0:FatalMission2, then type: FatalMission2.
Boot:      Reset your Amiga with an appropriate startup-sequence.

Epilogue

There is absolutely no point having an epilogue, unlike The Invaders.
