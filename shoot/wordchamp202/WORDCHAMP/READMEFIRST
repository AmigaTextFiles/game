WORD CHAMP 2.02

This is a shareware version of WORD CHAMP 2. It is almost the full
version, except that it finishes after level 4. If you like to play
the game and want to see how it continues, please 

PAY THE SHAREWARE FEE of US$ 10 (or DM 15 or Fim 40).

When you do this, you don't only get the full version, but also every
upgrade I make during the following years for FREE (you must send an
empty disk if you don't have an email address where I can mail the
upgrades). I will mail some other shareware products of mine (like 3D
objects) to the net, and registered users of WORD CHAMP will get these
cheaper (or free) than others.

Here's what you do:

1. Send me US$ 10 (US dollars), DM 15 (German marks) or Fim 40
   (Finnish marks) in cash (address below)

2. Send an EuroCheque of 40 Fim payable to Martin Keitel

or

3. Contact me via email to suggest a better method of payment (for
   example I can give you my account number or possibly you can
   even pay with 'digicash' through the net).


I hope you enjoy WORD CHAMP! If you have any suggestions for improvement
(I have thought of making a two player version, but I need some encoura-
gement) or have some constructive comments, please feel free to contact
me.
Also look out for Imagine objects and graphic utilities I'll be sending
to the net.

the necessary files will be located under a drawer called WORDCHAMP. Run

What's new in 2.02?

I have reduced the memory consumption. I tested with 504 k chip and 540 k
fast and it worked. So, it just MIGHT work with half meg chip Amiga 500's
if installed and run from floppy... but I don't have a chance to try it
right now. If anybody does... let me know!
