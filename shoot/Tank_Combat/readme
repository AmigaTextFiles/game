Important: - Tank Combat requires the cutout.19 font to run.
If you already have this in your fonts: drawer, then fine. 
If not, you should execute "Install_Font", or click on its icon. 
Tank Combat also makes use of the diskfont.library - this is included  
on your Workbench disk, nbut you should take note if you're trying to put  
this on a compilation or self-booting disk. OK?  
 
Oh yeah, you *must* be running in PAL to play Tank Combat, or the screen
display will corrupt.
