  
        Welcome to Tank Combat

        an RGBSoft Production   

      ------------------------

This program is freely distributable, but the copyright remains with
me (Tim Franklin aka Belgarion) at all times.  Spread the disk, but
don't mess eith the code.

Installation
------------
If you've read the README file, you'll know about installing the cutout
font which Tank Combat requires. If not, go and read that file now.
Other than that, boot up you Workbench, then click on Tank_Combat and
away you go.  And yes, it is hard-drive installable :-) Just copy 
"Tank_Combat" , "Tank_Combat.info" to wherever you like, and install
the font in "fonts:" on your hard-drive.

Instructions
------------
Tank Combat is based on the excellent "Combat" game for that old At*ri
VCS, only tarted up a bit and with different gameplay variations.
Player one controls the tank via a joystick in the joystick port, player
two controls the jeep via a joystick in the mouse port.
It's really just a case of up, down, left, right and fire.
The first one to get 9 kills wins, and gets a score based on how quickly
they won, the level and the other player's kills (the lower the better.)
Player 1 can select the level on the options screen by moving the
joystick left and right - all of the options are pretty easy to understand.
That's about it - what more do you need to know ? Just go kill each other
and have fun.

Bug reports
-----------
I've tested this code pretty well, and so have some other people.  
However, you use Tank Combat entirely at your own risk - any loss or 
damage is *your* responsability, not mine.  
If you find any bugs, or you'd like to make any suggestions for 
improvements, or you'd just like to say ta for such a luverly game :-) 
you can contact me sometimes via e-mail as tjf@ukc.ac.uk 
or by snail-mail:
