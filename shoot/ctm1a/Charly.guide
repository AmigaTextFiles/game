     My name is Emilio Perez,I am 20 years old and have been an AMIGA user
     since I was 12.I live in Montevideo,which is the capital of Uruguay,
     a small country in South America.
     I am nor a programmer,neither a musician-just an avid gamesplayer since
     I was 8 years old.I have always dreamed of doing my own game.Then,in
     early 1998 I found this little gem on Internet: "Backbone",by Alastair
     Murray.I was instantly hooked...
     I started way back in my summer holidays in 1998.I was annoyed with
     the lack of a decent platformer on Aminet.I seem to recall some
     okay-ish ones,but the programmers had made them shareware,and asked
     ridiculous fees for the full game.
     The only platformer which I actually loved then was "Alien Fish
     Finger",by David Cusick- one of the few games worth registering on
     Aminet.
     As time passed,though,some good platformers were released,and that
     includes the excellent "Wiz 2",by Steve Eaborn.Anyway,I feel that
     "Charly The Merc" stands on his own:

     This game is a side-viewed platformer featuring 5 standard weapons,
     a secret one and some mission-especific weapons.
     It spans over 3 worlds,each made of various sub-levels.Each world
     is completely different from each other,both in terms of GFX,enemies,
     and even playability.

     I understand that some GFX may look a bit patchy.This is particularly
     true of the Desert levels,which were the first ones I worked on.
     However,as I became more proficient with paint packages,I managed to
     achieve better results.And even some of the desert GFX aren't that
     bad (have a look at mission 1-4,for once).The thing is that the
     later levels feature MUCH better GFX that the first ones.The fact that
     I haven't got a monitor but a TV didn't help a lot,either.

     Besides Backbone,the other software used was Deluxe Paint 4 AGA to
     draw the GFX,and GFXCON to convert the pics you can see at the
     ending from 256 colours to 32.

     Incidentally,when I completed this game I wanted to submit it via
     e-mail to Amiga Format's reader games.I contacted them not one but two
     times-and they never replied!I would like to know what happened...

     Please note that this game features scenes of graphical violence and
     gore that might not be suitable for young children,or even too
     serious people.You have been warned!


    
     "Do your best,then leave the results to me and don't worry-be happy"

     1-Pistol

       It is the weapon you start each mission with.
       Besides the machine gun and the secret weapon,it is the only weapon
       which can be shot while jumping.

       RANGE: medium
       POWER: medium
       RELOAD TIME:medium

     2-Machine gun

       Fast and flexible.As well as the pistol and the secret weapon,it can
       be shot in mid-air.It is slighty less powerful than the pistol,but
       it more than makes up with is fast fire rate.

       RANGE:short
       POWER:low
       RELOAD TIME:low

     3-Shotgun

       One of Charly's personal favourites,the shotgun is 3 times more
       powerful than the pistol.It's slighty sluggish between shoots.

       RANGE:medium-long
       POWER:medium-high
       RELOAD TIME:medium-high

     4-Missile Launcher

       A devastating weapon,it's only drawback being the high reload time.

       RANGE:long
       POWER:high
       RELOAD TIME:high

     5-Flame-thrower:

       Charly's other fave weapon.It is the only weapon in the whole game
       that can be shoot whilst walking.A bit bulky,though.

       RANGE:medium
       POWER:high
       RELOAD TIME:very low

     6-Secret Weapon:

       The most powerful weapon in the game.It is usually very well hidden.
       Can be shoot while jumping,too.

       RANGE:long
       POWER:very high
       RELOAD TIME:medium


     Bear in mind that when you are wielding a weapon,you lose energy if an
     enemy touches it.On the other hand,big weapons can be used to collect
     items while jumping,by touching them (especially the flame-thrower).
     Note that in Mission 3,you'll come across two special weapons,which fit
     in well with the theme of the level...

                             @{b}@{u} PLAYING THE GAME @{ub}@{uu}



     The game is your standard platformer kinda thing.Use a joystick
     in port 2 to move Charly around,and the fire button to fire the
     relevant weapon.
     Notice that only some weapons can be shot while jumping,and other
     while walking (see @{"Weapons" link "weapons"}).

     At any time press ESC to lose a life,P to pause/unpause and CTRL + C
     to quit and return to WB.You can also control Charly with the cursor
     keys,and shoot with right shift.
     Other key that you will have to use is SPACE.Presssed while in front
     of a warning sign,it will reveal clues,etc.Also,there is a level in
     which you use SPACE to go through doors.

     At the start of each mission,your boss (Mac Halpin) will explain to
     you what's going on.Then,before each level you will be told:

     1-THE LEVEL NAME:this is often quite irrelevant,and consists of the
       OASIS or THE WHO songs that I like,or was listening to while
       drawing that picture.

     2-OBJECTIVES:This is very important,since it is what you have to do
       in order to complete the level.Mostly,you have to reach the exit
       area (you'll be told where it is-usually at the far left of the
       level),but sometimes you are also required to kill all enemy within
       the level.In this case,if you arrive at the exit area and there are
       still baddies alive you won't be moved to the next level,until you
       have killed the remaining enemies.

     3-NOTES:some comments on the level background,etc

    You can skip lots of levels,but you have to find how first! ; )
    Look out for warning signs that tell you how to do it,or give clues
    about it!

    At the end of mission 2,you are told how to start the game at mission
    3.

    Now,something that you must understand is that secret rooms are a vital
    part of the game.You WILL NOT make it to the end if you don't find a
    couple of hidden extra lives.

    The secrets rooms are are usually behind walls that seem to be
    solid,when in fact they can be walked over,there are blocks which are
    actually ladders...I have said enough!!

     Well,I haven't really tested Charly on lots of different machines.

     It does work on A1200 2Mb Ram (the standard one,y'know).But I think
     that sooner or later you'll get an "out of memory" window!!And at any
     rate,in such a machine,the game is usually slow-paced,and there are
     places where it really crawls along!


     The recommended setting is A1200 with a 030 board and 4 MB ram.

     I have a 1200 030/40 and 16 MB ram.

     In theory,it should work on any amiga as long as you have enough memory
     and a HD,but I think that on a 500 or 600 it will barely run.

       Backbone is a great program,but it is not really suited for
       such a big project.The game is incredibly chip-memory hungry.
       That means that during play,the game might freeze.I said MIGHT.
       I know for sure that if you play the game WITHOUT reading any warning
       signs,it is much less likely to lock up.
       So,my advice is to read the warning signs only the first time
       around.

       Even though the game multitasks,and returns to WB (by pressing
       CTRL+C),you are strongly adviced to play it without running any
       background programs (IE booting without startup-sequence and
       executing it from here).

       If you want to be picky,you can point out that sometimes the
       animation of Charly shooting the shotgun is not 100 % accurate,but
       there was no way in which I could have done it better.Sorry!

       Oh,I am sure that there must be some spelling mistakes.My native
       language is Spanish,remember.So please let me know if you find any!

                           @{b}@{u} SOME TIPS @{ub}@{uu}


       1-Read carefully what you are supposed to do before each mission
         begins.You usually don't have to kill everything.That means that
         there is no point chasing someone if you are not required to kill
         all enemy,and not to mention if you are wielding a pistol or
         other small weapon.

       2-It is often impossible to kill an enemy the first time he charges
         at you.The best thing to do is shoot him two or three times,then
         jump over him,and when you land quickly turn around and shoot
         him from behind.This depends on the weapon you are wielding,too.
         For example,the tuaregs can be killed in one go with the pistol
         the first time around if you hold down FIRE as soon as you spot
         them running towards you.They will kick the bucket just in
         front of you.
         The snakes that are found in the desert levels can be killed by
         jumping over them,too.
         Oh,and be careful-later on enemy use to follow you around,rather
         than roam from right to left!

       3-Enemy that shoots at you WILL NOT hurt you if you touch him-only his
         bullets will.This is VERY important.

       4-It does not pay to be fancy.

    Well,there are lots of people who deserve a mention here.
    First of all,I wanna thank my family,especially my older brother
    (Higinio) who tested the game and was really helpful.

    I want to say hello to all our AMIGA community here in
    Uruguay,particularly Maxi,Aldo,Sebastian "Soviet" and Ricardo.

    Golden regards to all the great Aminet authors like Steve Eaborn (the
    guy who programmed Wiz 1 & 2),the swedish guys who made "Wally The
    Worm 1 & 2 ",Crazy 8' programmer (Curt),Anonym Soft,and lots of
    other talented folks who put their games for free.
 
    Normally,I would have also said thanks to Edgard Martin Vidgal,who
    programmed what I think is the best Shoot'em-up EVER:Deluxe Galaga.
    Unfortunately,he is going to port it to the PC!!ARRGGHHHH!!!!
    This is the cheapest thing anyone has ever done!!!

    Mega-thanks go out to Alastair Murray,for making this possible.

    Inspirational thanks go to:

             * Captain Commando (that's were the "Charly Profile" came
               from)

             * Ghosts'n'Goblins (just you play the second world and see!)

             * Street Fighter (he,he)

             * Yo!Joe! (look at Mission 3 in my game,and think of one
               of the worlds of the former)

    I suppose I pinched things from all my favourite AMIGA games.They
    are the Turrican trilogy,Operation Thunderbolt,Slamtilt,Out Run Europa,
    Disposable Hero,Deluxe Galaga,Wings,UFO,Wing Commander,Hexagons and
    virtually all the games CORE did.

    While programming,I listened to:

     OASIS:(What's The Story)Morning Glory?,Definitely Maybe,Be Here Now,
     The Masterplan and a bootleg with all the songs that did not made it
     to The Masterplan ; )

     THE WHO:Who's Next,Quadrophenia,My Generatiom-The Very Best and Live

    Actually,On The Dole Software is just a one man team: Emilio Perez.

    However,I want people to help me in the future,doing stuff like gfx

    and sfx.I'm especially interested in both good graphicians and

    musicians,to do Charly The Merc Episode II,and another project I have

    in mind,which is a side viewed platformer,where you take control of

    a kind of cyborg,and the game is ambiented in a Chaos Engine

    style scenario (IE kind of new-gothic).

    For more info on this last one,please e-mail me and we'll see if we can

    do it together.I want to do it before CTM II.

    So,if you think that you can do something good,then please don't

    hesitate to send me a sample of your work.You don't have to be able

    to do amazing things-I just want people who are "mad for it",and are

    Charly The Merc is giftware so if you like this game you have to

    send me either:


    1-An e-nail.Tell me where are you from,where did you get the game

    from,and what do you think of it.Please be honest!If you think it

    stinks,then please let me know WHY,so I can make things better

    in the future.


    2-Money.The registration fee is 5 US$.Of course,you can send

    more! : )

    Frankly,I would really appreciate if you could send me 5 US$.It is

    not much for you,but for me it is A LOT,especially because I live

    in South America.Just take in account the effort than went into this

    game!!

    Rather than uploading just a bit of it on Aminet,I decided to put the

    full thing,and let you make your mind whether or not is worth

    registering.


    3-A gift.I am a big fan of the folowing groups:Oasis and The Who.

    If you have more money than sense,give me something

    hard to find like boots,singles...whatever!

    If you have any Amiga magazines that you no longer want,well,that

    would be a top gift too.I'm a collector,and my fave Amiga mags are

    "The One" and "Amiga Action".

    Books in English are welcome,as well.My favourite author is Joseph

    Conrad.



    ANY of the above would be welcome with open arms!

@EndNode


                    Look...A secret bit on the docs!WOW!

                        Has anybody done this before?


   Here you have a small guide to the game...

   The pistol,machine gun and shotgun are the weapons you'll see most often.
   The shotgun is the pick of this bunch.Then you have the "big" weapons:
   the launcher,the flamer and the special weapon.The launcher can be found
   in most levels-always pick it up.The flamer is usually hidden,as is the
   Special Weapon,which is the best weapon in the game.
   In mission 3 you pick up a sword and shurikens.The sword is the worst
   weapon in the game.Only pick it up to get used to it,since the boss
   on this mission involves a sword duel.The shuriken is the
   second best weapon in the game.To get it,you have to kill the special
   brown ninja that faces you at the end of levels 2 and 3.

   Remember,the key to success is not to run like mad around the levels-
   always go carefully,and when and enemy charges towards you,jump over
   him (if you have a small weapon) or quickly shoot him,if you have a
   big weapon (IE launcher).

   You WON'T make it to the end if you don't find any hidden extra lives.
   Not only you get the lives-they are usually in company of a big weapon.

   Mission 1:It is made of 6 levels.Levels 1 and 2 can be skipped.Look out
   for clouds which are solid and can therefore be walked over.
   Level 5 has got a shortcut,which is revealed to you during mission 2
   level 1.
   On level 6,it may be worth picking up the pistol at the start,since it
   can be shot while jumping,and that would definitely be helpful.

   Mission 2:It is made of 5 levels.Levels 2 and 3 can be skipped.

   Mission 3:Made of 5 levels.Only level 1 can be skipped.This is when the
   game starts getting harder.

   Mission 4:Made of 4 sections.7 levels in total.Levels 1 and 2 can be
   skipped.This is very hard-make sure you have a fair amount of lives.
   Many can be found during this mission,though.At the end of the first
   level you can pick a life and a launcher,which would prove vital.
   Section 2 is full of doors.Personally speaking,I would take the first
   one.There is a flamer besides the second one.
   Section 3 greets you with the most dangerous enemy of the whole game,
   besides the crusher.It is a flying homer armed with a laser,and it is
   very tough.It takes 4 shotgun bursts to kick the bucket.It may be a
   good idea not to face it unless you have one of the "big" weapons.
   Section 4 is a big melee.Try to pick the enemies one by one.Usually,
   if you run away they'll follow you and you'll end up in further trouble.
   The final boss of the game is not as hard as it seems.First of all,
   get the launcher (top left of the level) or the flamer (left,near the
   starting point).If you have 6 or more lives,simply stand besides it and
   hold down the fire button.Don't worry about the guardian's shoots as
   they only take one energy point away.Try to dodge the boss itself shoots,
   that take a lot more.Whatever you do,be careful not to touch the boss,
   since you will automatically lose a life.


   Oh,and if you thought this was an excellent game,just you wait and see the
   sequel...THAT would be excellent.This is just very good,in my personal
   opinion,though is a very important step forward for me.

   Thanks for everything.
