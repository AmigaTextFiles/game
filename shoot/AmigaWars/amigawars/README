Amiga Wars is a simple, mouse-controlled shoot'em up.  Full
instructions are provided in the game.

Note: (1) You can use BOTH mouse buttons when firing lasers.
      (2) Press ESC at the title screen to quit the game.

Installing on Hard Drive
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Just copy all of the files into a directory of your choice.
Double click on the icon to begin, or type "AmigaWars" from
CLI.

Running AmigaWars from a floppy disk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Copy all of the files onto a floppy
- Make a "Libs" directory and copy the diskfont.library into it
- Install the floppy
- You're ready to go!

(I think older Amiga's will require the Run command in the C dir)
