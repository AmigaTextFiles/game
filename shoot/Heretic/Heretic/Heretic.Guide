@NODE "Parameters" "Parameters to be used in Heretic"

 @{FG SHINE}@{U}Parameters to be used in Heretic@{UU}:@{FG TEXT}

    @{B}asl           @{UB} Use asl requester to select screen mode. Default is
                    PAL|LORES or 320x200 cgx mode.
		    starting from v0.7 asl should be used to get bigger resolution 
		    than 320x200. In hicolor mode, you should select 15 depth
		    screen mode (filter hook has been removed)

    @{B}nodoublebuffer@{UB} Turns off double buffering.

    @{B}window        @{UB} Display results in window on workbench screen. Workbench
                    must have at least 15 bit depth. Doublebuffering does not
                    work on window. Works also on AGA, but is slow as hell.

    @{B}directcgx     @{UB} Use fast copy routines instead of writepixelarray. Does
                    not work with window mode. Works only on cybergraphics.

    @{B}lbhack        @{UB} Should be used like this: -lbhack x, where x 
		    is number of frames to render in one combination of LockBitMap
		    and UnlockBitMap.This should make the game faster (aspecially
		    on PPC, due to huge amount of context switches). By default x is
		    1 (every frame bitmap is locked and unlocked). Try different
		    values here, I bet something like 15 will be best choice.
		    This is a hack (bitmap should not be locked for a long time)
		    so use on your own risk. Number of frames to skip should be
		    >= 1. Should be used together with -directcgx. works only
              on cybergraphics.

    @{B}fps           @{UB} Shows online fps counter.

    @{B}mouse         @{UB} Turns mouse on.

    @{B}music         @{UB} Enables music.

    @{B}nosfx         @{UB} Disables sound fx effects.

    @{B}nosound       @{UB} Disables music and sfx (no sound at all).

    @{B}hicolor       @{UB} Enables hicolor rendering.

    @{B}bilinear      @{UB} Enables bilinear filtering in hicolor mode.
                    Take a look at bilinear.iff, to see the difference.

    @{B}joy           @{UB} Enables joystick support.

    @{B}ham6          @{UB} Sets display in hicolor on AGA to ham6.

    @{B}ham8          @{UB} Sets display in hicolor on AGA to ham8. Default is ham6.

    @{B}lowdetail     @{UB} Turns on low detail floor and ceiling rendering.
		    Low detail can be also switched on/off with
		    'l' key during game.

    @{B}scaledgui     @{UB} Enables GUI scaling routines. Otherwise all GUI elements
			(menus and texts) will be just copied to screen.
			Can be also turned on/off during game with 's' key.

    @{B}bus           @{UB} Sets bus clock. Should be used with care. If Heretic
		    runs too fast, you can use this switch. After heretic starts,
		    It prints actual bus clock. This value should be beetwen 50-70 Mhz.
		    If it is really low (like 30Mhz or lower) type -bus 60000000 to get
		    60Mhz bus clock. Try different values here (but with care!!!).
		    Only available in PPC version.

    @{B}c2p           @{UB} Should be used with name of external c2p module:
                    -c2p c2p/c2p_noe for example. With this feature,it is possible to add
                    c2p modules for differents cpus, and also to play heretic in higher
                    resolution than 320x200. (Now only 320x200 c2p module exist (by noe))
		    (This is only available in 68k version on AGA).
		    By defaut, heretic open c2p/c2p_noe module.

    @{B}screenmode    @{UB}Allow user to specify screen mode. This must be a number
		    (for PAL_LORES it is 135168 for example)

    @{B}wad	       @{UB}Allow user to specify heretic wad file.
		    Like this: -wad cd0:files/heretic.wad

    @{B}instrfile     @{UB}Allw to specify path and file name of MIDI_Instruments
                    file. Like this: -instrfile dh3:adoom/MIDI_Instruments

@NODE "History" "History of Heretic"

 @{FG SHINE}@{U}History of Heretic@{UU}:@{FG TEXT}

new in v1.1
        - I think I have finally fixed the bug that caused crash on
          exit with directcgx enabled. But who knows?
        - Added -instrfile switch. Can be used to specify MIDI_Instruments
          file. Optimized hereticsound.library a bit. Bumped version 
          to 38.1
        - Fixed a lot of enforcer hits. Now it should be stable,
          also in WOS version. I think I should be more carefully
          when I will try to optimize something next time ;)
        - fixed hicolor routines in doublebuffered mode. Worked
          wrong on cgfx.
        - fixed fps counter drawing in hicolor, on cgfx display.

new in v1.0
	- New feature: jumping! Jump with ENTER key.
	- fixed windowed mode on cgfx. 
	- fixed directcgx routines. (It rocks on BVision;)
	- fixed bug that caused crash in PPC version.
	- added -screenmode switch. See  @{"Parameters" LINK "Parameters"} 
	- added -wad switch. Someone asked for it. It can be used to
	  specify wad file (ie -wad heretic1.wad).
	- fixed bug which caused crash on exit with -directcgx switched
	  on. I am not sure about that, so someone please verify this.
	  (It works for me).
	

new in v0.999(9)
	- PPC version is much faster now. Please refer to
	  @{"Speed" LINK "Speed"} 
	- Close Gadget now works in window mode. Of course it 
	  quits the game ;)
	- Added Amiga Menus. Just press Right Mouse button and see
	  what will happen. Works only in Window mode so far.
	  Maybe I will add this feature also to screen version of
	  Heretic. Treat this as an experiment. For example
	  Load, Save and New game does not work. Other menus
	  may work or not.
	- Fixed HAM6 routine in 68k version.
	- Added support for ToolTypes (at least ;) all tool types
	  available are listed @{"Here" LINK "ToolTypes"} 
	- New bilinear filtering functions on PPC side.
	  Written by Noe, fast as hell.
	- New transparency code in hicolor (PPC) faster, better.
	- Fixed all 15Bit routines to work in 15bit ;)
	  Some of them (like transparency code) was working
	  still in 8 Bit mode.
	- Cleaned the code. Found a lot of code, that was not
	  needed. Removed. Runs Faster.
	- At least fixed the 'Exit-Hang-Bug' in WOS version.
	- Added couple of inline assembly functions in WOS version.
	- Added couple of asm optimized functions in 68k version.

new in v0.951 (has not been released - I had no time)
	- New Venus Art Customers Service started. We now supports
	  both ppc kernels. We also have hope, other people will do 
	  the same thing. 
	 * Now you aren't terrorised by PowerUP/WarpOS advocacy. 
	 * Now you have choice !!!
	- Added HereticWOS executable. Use on your own risk.
	  It has not been tested. A lot of things may not work.
	  If it crashes - don't blame me. vbcc is not the best
	  compiler on world, for sure.
	- Fixed Map rendering in hi-resolution.
	- Fixed display routines.
	- title and intermissions songs works (I forgot about that - it is
	  available from v 0.89 I think)	

new in v0.935
	- Probably introduced a lot of new bugs in cgfx display
	  routines (dunno if this version is working or cgfx or not)
	  Maybe it will be fixed, maybe not - who knows?
	- Fixed framerate calculations in -playdemo & -timedemo1
	- removed -turbo switch. It was only needed to simulate 'very fast'
	  game, reported by some people. Now -bus fixes this bugs, so there is
	  no need to keep -turbo. However, it can be simulated on PPC,
	  with -bus switch and very low bus_clock value.
	- added couple of asm-optimized functions in 68k version.
	- Removed sound precacheing. 'Eated' lot of memory (some people don't
	  have 64Mb ,like I do ;) and caused some problems. Actually it has
	  been removed already in v0.89, but I forgot to mention.
	- renamed DoomSound.library to HereticSound.library. It is not compatible
	  with doomsound.library.
	- Added new c2p module (c2p_highres) which can be used on AGA to
	  get higher resolution. It is damn slow anyway.
	- fixed high reslution. Weapon is now rendered correctly
	  as well as all texts and graphics elements.
	- added -scaledgui switch. See @{"Parameters" LINK "Parameters"}.
	- renamed config file to va_heretic.cfg (No more problems with
	  other ports).
	

new in v0.89
	- fixed almost all routines, to use any resolution.
	  However, there still may be some places, where heretic will
	  show big mess in higher resolution than 320x200.
	- new DoomSound.library. Rewritten by NOE. It has better mixing routines.
	  Version has been bumped to 38. Heretic NEEDS this version of library to run
	  with sound.
	- Stereo panning works!
	- Sound volume is now much higher.
	- Grid in automap has been activated. See @{"Keys" LINK "Keys"} 
	- New faster HAM6 c2p (PPC).
	- Timedemo bugs fixed. Now -timedemo switch works perfectly.
	- Fixed this ugly two little sprites on status bar in hicolor mode.
	- New faster timing routines in 68k version.
	- fixed HereticLauncher, to allow using ':' and other chars in
	  'Other Options' gadget.
	- fixed joystick support.
	- added support for external c2p modules (68k). See @{"Plugins" LINK "Plugins"} 
          added -c2p switch See @{"Parameters" LINK "Parameters"}.
	- added two IconSets. See @{"Thanks" LINK "Thanks"}, to see who made it.
	- screenshoting now works also in 256 colour mode. However, pictures
	  are saved as 24bit IFF.
	- Fixed sky wraping bug in high resolution.

new in v0.8
	- new, faster rendering routines in 68k version.
	- new timing routines. This code was taken from ADoom PPC, with some
	  additional optimizations. Added -bus switch. See @{"Parameters" LINK "Parameters"} 
	  for more info.

new in v0.7
	- mouse support has been changed. Now it works like this:
	  left/right mouse movements turns player left/right
	  left mouse button is used to fire.
	  right mouse button is used to move player forward.
	  middle mouse button (if you got one) is used for opening/closing
	  doors, and stuff like that.
	  forward/backward mouse movement moves player forward/backward.

	- added -lbhack switch. It is used to speed up rendering
	  in directcgx mode. See @{"Parameters" LINK "Parameters"}
	  for more info.
	- High resolution. There is a lot of limitations:
	  - It does not work on AGA in 68k version
	  - It does not work on AGA in hicolor (on both PPC and 68k)
	  - A lot of things will probably look weird, I am working on that.
	  - It actually can be only used in full screen game, A lot of
	    code still need to be patched.
	- Fixed hicolor in cgfx.
	- added -lowdetail switch, lowdetailed  are only floor and ceiling.
	  Can be changed during game with 'l' key.
	  This speeds game a bit (aspecially on 68k). Does not work in hicolor
	  mode.
	- added @{"Heretic Launcher" LINK "HLauncher"}, for easy access to all 
	  switches and options.
	- added -turbo options. Some people reported, that this game runs too
	  fast on their computers. Now I know why - but I don't know how
	  to fix it ;( If you dare, try to finish 1st level, in nightmare 
	  + turbo mode ;)
new in v0.6
	- Jacek Cybularczyk (Noe) joined to the team ;)
	- I screwed a lot of things in v0.5. Sorrry for that.
	- added -hicolor (enables 15bit rendering) and -bilinear
	  (enables bilinear filtering in hicolor) switches.
	  Bilinear filtering can be switched on/off during the game
	  with F5 key.
	  Bilinear filtering works only  on walls,floors and ceilings.
	  Sprites are filtered only vertically.
	- Added -ham6 and -ham8 switches. ham6 is default for aga.
	- at least fixed sound routines. It works ok now (at least
	  on my machine ;)
	- Fixed AGA Window mode.
	- Hicolor rendering on cgfx has not been tested. 
	  So it may not work.
	- Added joy suppport. My joystick is broken,so I don't know
	  if it works.
	- Added code to make screenshots. Only in hicolor so far.

new in v0.5
	- Fixed some bugs in sound replay routines.
	- All sounds are now precached at start.
	- Heretic now works in window also on AGA. This feature is very 
	  buggy at the moment.

new in v0.4
	- Sound. I have used doomsound.library which was used in 
	  ADoom PPC. This library was created by Joseph Fenton.
	  All I have made was pragma file with proper libcall's
	  for 68k version of Heretic.
	  This also allow to use music (you will need MIDI_Instruments
	  from ADoom to hear music). 
	  Three new switches:
	    -music enables music
	    -nosfx disables sound fx
	    -nosound disables all sound (music and sfx)

	- Fixed all (as always only hopefully ;) bugs in cgfx display
	  routines.

	- There is no need to use -asl switch on cgfx anymore.Heretic
	  will try to find best screen mode automagically.

	- Heretic now automagically pauses, if heretic screen or window
	  has been deactivated.

	- Added mousewheel support. Mousewheel simulates look up
	  and look down keys.

New in v0.3:
	- Added code to darken display, if menu is active.
	- all keyboard bugs has been fixed. See keys.txt
	  for available keys.
	- some minor speedup made to 68k version, and also for
	  PPC.
	- hopefully fixed all bugs with cgfx.
	- Sound and network does not work at the moment.

@NODE "HLauncher" "Heretic Launcher"

 @{FG SHINE}@{U}Heretic Launcher v0.1.@{UU}:@{FG TEXT}
  Starting from version 0.7, Heretic Launcher is distributed together
  with Heretic. It requires MUI, and gaves you easy access to all
  heretic options. I don't think I should explain all the options,
  but some things are important:
	- The "other options" string gadget in misc section, can be used
	  to specify any options from original game (like -playdemo demo1)
	- If you want HereticLauncher to remember your settings, use Save
	  button before quit.
	- Load button does not work ;)

 Preferences are saved in hereticlauncher.cfg file.
 Heretic Launcher can be used for both 68k and PPC version.
 Not all of the switches I've added to heretic are available from 
 Heretic Launcher, that is why "other options' gadget exist ;)

 @{FG SHINE}@{U}External Heretic Modules.@{UU}:@{FG TEXT}
  Right now, only external modules are c2p functions.
  see c2p/c2p_skeleton.s how to write c2p module.
  You will find there c2p_noe.s (which were written by NOE,
  and rewritten by me (ELF))
  I hope some skilled c2p-writters will write fast c2p replacements 
  for heretic ;) If you don't want to share your sources - no problem, 
  executable is all I need.

  NOTE:
    c2p module idea is taken from DoomAttack. But only idea ;)
    Of course it looks similiar, aspecially c2p module layout,
    but it was not stolen ;) (exepts idea of course ;).

@NODE "WOS" "WarpOS Version"

 @{FG SHINE}@{U}Warp OS version of Heretic.@{UU}:@{FG TEXT}

  This release contains also a WarpOS version of Heretic. It has been
compiled with vbcc. It is slower than PowerUP vrsion due to:
	- worse compiler (PowerUP version has been compiled with
	  egcs and sasc.
	- It seems that context switches are not as fast in WarpOS
	  as some people claims. For example the palette fadeings
	  freezes the game. The same is with disk access routines.
	  And both of them are using 68k processor.
