    While exploring a large maze of underground tunnels in the state of
        Nevada, USA. You emerge near the entrance to a 'TOP SECRET'        
     Military installation. Cautiously, you decide to sneak around and
        explore the area. While nearing a large building, gun shots, 
        screams and other sounds are heard. Around the corner of the 
    building, a man comes stumbling towards you, and falls at your feet.
    The man appears badly injured, but he manages to tell you a horrible
    story....

            'Inside the large building a group of scientist's and
             I, have been working on a project called 'CY-CLONE'.
             'CY-CLONE', involved taking DNA from some soldiers
             and combining it with a Super Computers artifical
             intelligence. 
             Then using an altered radioactive isotope, along with
             cloning, we were able to create a race of beings called
             Cyborgs.
             The purpose of our project, was to create a race of 
             warriors for a possible future engagement between 
             humans and an extraterrestial race.
             Unfortunately, the Super Computer used to give the 
             Cyborgs, their artificial intelligence, was infected
             with a virus. The virus caused the Cyborgs to change,
             they soon regarded anyone or anything other than
             themselves, as extraterrestials.
              
             Every human inside is dead, and I am slowly dying...
            
             You must stop the Cyborgs! If they are not stopped
             they will soon start cloning themselves and take over
             the world.

             Follow me....

            
    
    Limping badly, the scientist manages to take you inside the lower
    level of the installation, to the main 'CY-CLONE Cloning Chamber'.
        As you enter a room a massive door slams shut behind you, 
    separating you from the scientist. You stand patiently on a gold
        colored platform. Suddenly, a strange beam of green light 
    envelops you. Your body feels like it's on fire. The pain grows
    more and more intense, then you hear the scientist talking to you
    over an intercom....


             'In a couple minutes you will faint, when you 
              become conscious again, you will be a Cyborg.
              There will be three of you! If all three of 
               yourselves are killed, the world is doomed. 
              If you destroy most of the Cyborgs and make    
             it through all six levels of the installation,
             the computer will change you back into a human           
             again.

             Good Luck!

            Oh yea... You will be armed with a phase-gun, it's
            good for three blasts, then you will have to locate
                another one. I don't think you will have any 
               problem finding another weapon when you need it, 
            just keep a look-out.
            Now let me tell you about the levels and the Cyborgs
            on each...

           
            
            LEVEL 1:
            --------
              This level contains the blue dummies, as we called
              them. They have no intelligence as of yet!
              Back and forth they go on a mindless quest of
              nothingness...
              These blue dummies reside on every level of the
              installation, along with the Cyborgs below...
              
            LEVEL 2:
            --------
              Here is where something strange has happened, the
              Cyborgs have created a Red warrior, we never did
              figure out what his purpose was, is he just 
              another dummy or is there more to him than meets
              the eye...Beware!
               
            LEVEL 3:
            --------
              Caution must be used here! The Cyborgs have nade
              their first armed warrior, this Dark Blue terror
              is on a rampage of destruction.

            LEVEL 4:
            --------
              This level contains a White Cyborg, but in this
              case, white doesn't represent good. This warrior
              has been given a small amount of artificial
              intelligence, he will try to track you down while
              firing a blast of phase energy at you.
              Even worse he is equipped with a energy absorbing
              shield. It will take one blast of your Phase-gun
              to neutralize the shield before he is vunerable.

            LEVEL 5:
            --------
              The Golden Boy lives here! That's what we use to
              call him. Beware, he's no boy.. This terror has 
              an even stronger shield then the White Cyborg.
              It will take two blasts of your Phase-gun to
              neutralize the shield before he is vunerable.
              Watch out, he is even more smarter and aggressive
              than the White Cyborg.
           
            LEVEL 6:
            --------
              This is Terror! The Golden Cyborgs have created
              a new warrior. He is fast, and glides along
              silently. It is unknown if he has a weapon,
              but one thing we know for sure is he has an
              intelligence greater than any other Cyborg.
              He has the shield power of the golden cyborgs
              plus one feature no other Cyborg has.
              He is invisible.....
             
      ---------------------------------------------------------------

                      ***>>>  HOW TO PLAY  <<***
                      
  When you arrive on a level, you are the green cyborg. Immediately move
  to a partial safe area. What is a partial safe area, you ask? Any place
  away from the corners of the screen. In the corners you will see flashing
  spots of energy, these are Cyborg teleport pods, where you see a pod, a
  Cyborg will soon appear.
  Use a joystick to move your Cyborg...
  Pressing the fire button shoots a blast from your Phase-gun in the
  direction you are facing, unless your out of ammo, in this case locate
  and pick up another gun, by touching it.
  At the top of the screen is the 'SCORE:' the score increases by 
  destroying Cyborgs. Cyborgs have different point or score values, so you
  can clear a level faster by destroying the cyborgs that are worth more.
  Of course the Cyborgs that are worth more, are also the most dangerous.
  LIVES: is the number of Cyborgs or lives you have remaining, if it says
  2, that means one in reserve and the one your now controlling, etc..

  Here are the score-points needed to complete each level and the score-
  points that the different colored Cyborgs are worth:
      
      LEVEL 1: Blue Dummies 100
               3000 points needed to advance ot level 2
       
      LEVEL 2: Red Dummies 300
               6000 points needed to advance to level 3

      LEVEL 3: Dark Blue 300
               12000 points needed to advance to level 4

      LEVEL 4: White 400
               19000 points needed to advance to level 5
       
      LEVEL 5: Golden 400
               29000 points needed to advance to level 6

      LEVEL 6: Invisible 600
               39000 points needed to win the game...

                             - TECHNICAL-

          This game was written on my AMIGA 1200 68020 system,
          which has 2 megs of chip ram, and 8 megs of fast ram.

          It can be played on an AMIGA 500-600 system, but is
          about 3 times slower. How do I know this? Because I
            have an AMIGA 600 with 2 megs of chip ram only.

            
        It is written in AMOS. The only amal code is the routine
        to control the player and his weapon blast. The enemy 
        Cyborgs and their weapon blasts, etc. are all in regular
        or non-amal code. This uses all native 'AMOS THE CREATOR'
        commands, no extensions such as TOME, etc. 
        Everything is BOBS no sprites are used...
        It was created in two months, working at a calm pace...
