                                                                  {>SHAREWARE INFORMATION<                                                                         This is a three level {ShareWare} demo of         StarWoids. The idea of {ShareWare} is that it        allows you try out the game before you buy it.                                                               We encourage you to spend a couple of weeks       playing this demo. Then at the end of that time,     you can decide if you wish To pay the small fee      which entitles you to get the {FULL} version.                                                                Registration fees are as follows:                                                                       {* Australia   -   20 Australian dollars             {* UK          -   10 English pounds                 {  America     -   15 American dollars               {  Germany     -   23 German ....                    {  Finland     -   76 Finnish ....                                                                          When registering, you {MUST} send the money as    an 'Internation Cheque' in either Australian         dollars or English pounds.                                                                                   The above amounts for America, Germany and        Finland are purely for comparison because the        international exchange rates are constantly          changing. Your Bank should calculate the amount      from the marked '*' amounts above, based on the      exchange rates at the time.                                                                                  To entice you into registering, the full          version of StarWoids will contain many extra         features, along with many more levels. Here's a      list of proposed features:                                                                                 {o   A large number of levels.                       {o   Big raytraced intro/outro animations.           {o   Raytraced intro scenes (both HAM6 & HAM8).      {o   A working hi-score table (saveable to disk).    {o   Many more characters and craft.                 {o   A lot more music and Sound.                     {o   More Weapon powerups.                           {o   Possible AGA version if demand is great.        {o   Proximity mines, enemy shields etc.                                                                    The full version of StarWoids is not yet          complete, so any of the above are subject to         change (just as anything could be included). We      are keen To hear any coments and suggestions for     inclusion in the full release, so feel free to       include ideas with your registration fee.
