                                                                     {>ABOUT STARWOIDS<                                                                         Welcome To the StarWoids demo release.                                                                       The project originated in November93 from         the Amiga Format Blitz Basic 2 competition. We       didn't really expect to actually have it finished    in time for the comp, but AF's one month extention   allowed us To enter (although still only just).                                                              With StarWoids, we wanted to produce something    that would be fully playable on all Amiga systems    (with at least 1 meg of ram), so early in the        project we decided To use just 8 Colour graphics     (dual playfield). A lot of our original aims for     StarWoids proved too much For the A500, but they     might appear in a tweaked AGA version (still a       long time off).                                                                                              The three level demo has taken around eight       months of work. We now face another few months       (that would be late September/October 1994) of       work before the full version is complete. At this    point we will send it to everyone who has sent us    the registration fee.                                                                                        Was it all worth it? Well, it's hard to say       really. We didn't win the AF competition (argh),     so our original aim wasn't achieved. I guess we      have to see how many people register before          deciding :-).                                                                                                In the progress of creating StarWoids, Martin     bought the full version of Blitz2, Rowan bought      Brilliance, and Rob bought the StarWars CD set       for samples. Not to mention that we all bought       A1200's.                                                                                                                                                                  {-About The Game Itself-                                                                          The design of StarWoids is based on several       old classic games. The arcade game, %Asteroids%,     the Commodore 64 cheapo, %Thrust%, and %Oids% on     the AtariST are the main sources of ideas, but       our real aim was To produce something better than    all three. Did we achieve that?                                                                              For the gfx theme, we had many possibilities.     Our reasons for choosing Star Wars are numerous.     Firstly, we are all big fans of the movies, so       basing our game on Star Wars gave us that extra      bit of enthusiasm. The news of a new trilogy was     also a big deciding factor.                                                                                  Then there is the fact that the Amiga has,        sadly, missed out on all the recent Star Wars        games. The consoles had their rather nifty %Super    Star Wars%, and the PCs had their atmospheric        %X-wing% series - but the Amiga has missed both.                                                             It wouldn't be too much work to remove the        StarWars theme, but we sincerely hope that we        won't need to.                                                                                                                                                             {-About The Authors-                                                                             {Martin Kift} is a chemical engineer currently    working for a small UK based software consultancy    firm, and specialises in developing Microsoft        Windows applications (yes I know Windows sucks,      you should try writing for it!! 8^).
