To land the       X-wing, the nose must be facing directly upwards.    Heavy landings will result in a crash, so take it    easy.                                                                                                        Some parts of the landscape are interactive.      If you find yourself in a position with no           possible solution, try experimenting with the        landscape around you.                                                                                        Shooting certain items in the game will mean      a loss of points, plus the loss of a life. The       Rebel Shield generator on level two is an example    of this.                                                                                                     The various missions for each level vary          quite considerably. Read the information between     every level very carefully, as they are your only    source of clues.                                                                                                                                               {Special Items:                                                                                              Once collected, R2-D2 can open impenatrable       access doors. Simply land the X-wing close to a      door, and R2-D2 will automatically open it.                                                                  Imperial prisons can contain either Rebel         soldiers, or an explosives expert.                                                                           Rescuing a rebel pilot awards you one extra       life, and killing one results in the loss of         points. Killing the explosives expert will mean      that you must begin the level again plus the loss    of one life.                                                                                                 The explosives man is Used To destroy key         Imperial installations. Simply land close To the     base, and he will automatically perform his task.                                                                                                                             {-The Status Panel-                                                                         Far Left (Red)      - Timer (selected levels).
