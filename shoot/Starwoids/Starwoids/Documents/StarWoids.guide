@node INSTALL "Quick Installation"

    StarWoids can be run from both floppy and harddrive (plus even ram: if you
have enough). Installation is quite easy, and there's several ways to do it.

Installation to Floppy
======================

    Unpacking the DMS files to two disks is all that needs to be done. The
disks should be called "StarWoids1" and "StarWoids2", but DMS handles that
for you.

    Once unarchived (which you must have done already to be reading this 8^),
the game is ready to play. The game supports all external drives, but if you
only have the internal drive, it will prompt you when it needs the other disk.

Installation to Harddrive
=========================

    You will need around 1.4 meg of free space on you harddrive.

Installer
---------

    An installation script is provided to install StarWoids onto your harddisk.
This script uses the standard Commodore Installer utility, and is quite easy
to use. This script will also automatically add (after prompting you) two
necessary assigns to your user-startup (or startup-sequence) file. 

    Once you install StarWoids onto your harddisk, you must reset your amiga
to initialise the assignments. It is *very* important that you remove the
StarWoids floppy disks before resetting, since the device names for these
floppy disks will conflict with the assigns added to your user-startup file.

Manually
--------

    If you have any problems with the installer, you can install it by hand.
Start by creating a "StarWoids" directory on your harddisk, then copy all the
files from both StarWoids disks into this directory. Be careful to maintain
the directory structures. Finally, you will need to add these two assigns
manually to your user-startup (or starup-sequence):

   assign StarWoids1:  <your directory>
   assign StarWoids2:  <your directory>

Remember to reboot your amiga to initialise these assigns. If you don't wish
to alter either of the "startup" files, you could enter the assigns manually
via CLI or SHELL before playing the game.

@node RULES "Rules and Features"

    StarWoids was designed to be a bit more thought reliant than the usual
shoot em up. We've tried to include a puzzle element into the level designs,
but subtle enough so that it doesn't distract from the blasting element.

    The following is a list of important rules and features.

General Items
=============

    > Landing the craft is necessary for picking up people from the planets
      surface. To land the X-wing, the nose must be facing directly upwards.
      Heavy landings will result in a crash, so take it easy. 

    > Some parts of the landscape are interactive. If you find yourself in
      a position with no possible solution, try experimenting with the
      landscape around you.

    > Shooting certain items in the game will mean a loss of points, plus
      the loss of a life (or two). The Rebel shield generator on level two
      is an example of this, so don't shoot it.

    > The various missions for each level vary quite considerably. Read the
      information between every level very carefully, as they are your only
      source of clues.


Special Items
=============

    > Once collected, R2-D2 can open impenetrable access doors. Simply land
      the X-wing close to a door, and R2-D2 will automatically open it.

    > Imperial prisons can contain either Rebel soldiers, or an explosives
      expert (who isn't featured in the demo). Rescuing a rebel pilot awards
      you one extra life, and killing one results in the loss of points.
      Killing the explosives expert will mean that you must begin the level
      again plus the loss of one life.

    > The explosives man is used to destroy key Imperial installations.
      Simply land close to the base, and he will automatically perform his
      task.

    > NovaBombs can be used to destroy several ground targets in one large
      explosion. Use them carefully though, since you are limited to just 5
      in this demo.


Final help
==========

    This demo version of StarWoids has a very high difficulty level. This is
just to keep you playing it a bit longer O:). Note that there -is- a decent
reward should you manage to complete all 3 levels.

@node TOOLTYPES "Music and TOOLTYPES"

StarWoids keeps some of its settings inside the games Workbench icon. This is
done with the use of TOOLTYPES (The Amiga's standard way of passing parameters
to a Workbench program).

To view StarWoids' TOOLTYPES, do a SINGLE-click on the StarWoids game icon,
then select "Info" or "Information" from the Workbench menus.  If you're
confused about how to edit them, check your Amiga's manual.

Here are the "Boolean" TOOLTYPES that StarWoids currently uses:

MUSIC=1 or MUSIC=0.  
    This turns on/off both the title music and the mid-level music. Not only
    does turning off music stop music from playing, but it also prevents the
    mods from being loaded into memory. This can be useful when running
    StarWoids on machines will a small amount of chip memory.

ANIMS=1 or ANIMS=0
    This turns on/off the title animation. Memory should not be a problem
    with the animation, but you can turn it off to shorten loading time.

    Turning off the music and animation will drastically reduce loading times.
This isn't so much of a problem from harddrive, but from floppy the results
are quite substantial.

StarWoids Icon
==============

    The icon which accompanies the game is designed for 2.xx or 3.0x
systems. If you use 1.3 roms, you can use the extra icon found in the
/documents directory.

@node HOTTIPS "Hints and Tips"

Hints and Tips
==============

    > Level1 is a very open level. This should allow you to practice skills
      needed on later levels. Practice on this level is essential, because the
      later levels are very hard 8^).

    > The majority of the enemy have distinct reloading times, plus an element
      of randomness in their firing. Learn to take advantage of this.

    > There is no need to shoot every base 

    > All of the important enemies are shown on the title screens. Wait for
      the title screens to cycle, and look at the different enemies and
      appearances carefully.

    > Tie-fighters are reset when you lose a life, so don't rest on your
      laurels when you destroy one!

    > Conserve your novabombs. You are limited to just 5 in this demo.

@node HISTORY "History"

Releases
========

Demo v1.00    7/7/94 - three level demo released
Demo v1.01    9/7/94 - Several bug fixes


History
=======

    The project originated in November93 from the AmigaFormat Blitz Basic 2
competition. We didn't really expect to actually have it finished in time for
the comp, but AF's one month extention allowed us to enter (although still
only just).

    The three level demo has taken around eight months of work. We now face
another few months (that would be late September/October 1994) of work before
the full version is complete. At this point we will send it to everyone who
has sent us the registration fee.

    Was it all worth it? Well, it's hard to say really. We didn't win the AF
competition (argh), so our original aim wasn't achieved. I guess we have to
see how many people register before deciding 8^).

    In the progress of creating StarWoids, Martin bought the full version of
Blitz 2, Rowan bought Brilliance, and Rob bought the StarWars CD set for
samples. Not to mention that we all bought A1200's.

About the Design
================

    The design of StarWoids is based on several old classic games. The arcade
game, "Asteroids", the Commodore 64 cheapo, "Thrust", and "Oids" on the Atari
ST are the main sources of ideas, but our real aim was to produce something
better than all three. Did we achieve that?

    For the game theme, we had many possibilities. We chose Star Wars for
several reasons. Firstly, we are all big fans of the movies, so basing our
game on Star Wars gave us that extra bit of enthusiasm. The news of a new
trilogy was also a big deciding factor.

    Then there is the fact that the Amiga has, sadly, missed out on all the
recent Star Wars games. The consoles had their rather nifty "Super Star Wars",
and the PCs had their atmospheric "X-wing" series - but the Amiga has missed
out on both. Why!

    It wouldn't be too much work to remove the StarWars theme, but we
sincerely hope that we won't need to.

@endnode


@node BUGS "Bugs and Problems"

Bugs
====

    StarWoids has several bugs, the majority of which are caused by Blitz.
    None are detrimental to the game, but they will be sorted out for the
    registered version! Here they are:

    > The Med music player doesn't play the modules very well. The mods
      were originally written in ProTracker (CIA) format, but Blitz doesn't
      support that. This WILL be fixed (because the ProTracker versions
      sound great), so the full version will have ProTracker mods rather
      than the existing Med ones.

    > The sound may be corrupted if you have an accelerator. This is an
      unfortunate blitz problem, and a solution wasn't available at the
      time of releasing the demo. The release version will not suffer
      from this problem, however, since we understand it is being
      tackled by the Blitz developers at this moment.

      We have discovered that this problem is caused by processor caches,
      and therefore a temporary fix is to disable instruction/data caches,
      either at bootup, or using one of many software utilities. If you
      suffer from this problem, we suggest you at least try disabling
      your caches once, so you can hear how nice StarWoids sounds 8)

      Note that this sound corruption does not affect the music, only
      the sound effects. Also, sound corruption is the only way in
      which StarWoids is incompatible with advanced processors, it is
      well behaved and system friendly in all other aspects.

    > The fading of some pictures is not 100% correct. A small thing.


Problems
========

    The limitations of Blitz 2 and ECS Amigas produced some minor design
    problems. These may or may not be fixed in the full release, depending
    on whether we find a solution. Here they are:

    > It's hard to distinguish between Rebel pilots and Stormtroopers in
      the game. This is due to a lack of colours, and their small size.
      Just treat this as part of the challenge :).

    > We aimed to make the game playable on 512k chip memory machines. The
      game uses quite a large ammount of both graphics and sound, so it is
      very close to this limit. If you find that you have memory problems,
      try altering the TOOLTYPES settings to disable the animations, music,
      or both. The program may disable the title mod itself if it cannot
      find enough chip memory.

    > The graphics use "dual playfield" mode, so they are very limited
      in colours. The ground uses 7 colours, the baddies use another 7,
      plus the odd sprite can use a few more. This can only be enhanced
      if we do an AGA version.

    > If you are running the game on a 68000 based machine, you will find
      that bullets occationally disappear. This only happens on level two
      when there is a lot of objects on (or near) screen, and is a result
      of the processor being overworked.

@node SHAREWARE "Shareware Info"

ShareWare Information for StarWoids
===================================

This is a three level ShareWare demo of StarWoids. The idea of ShareWare 
is that it allows you try out the game before you buy it.

We encourage you to spend a couple of weeks playing this demo. Then at 
the end of that time, you can decide whether you want to pay the small
fee which allows you to get the full version.

    Registration fees are as follows:                      

      * Australia   -   20 Australian dollars
      * UK          -   10 English pounds
        America     -   15 American dollars
        Germany     -   23 German deutsch marks
        Finland     -   76 Finnish marks

    When registering, you MUST send the money as an 'International Cheque' in
either 'Australian dollars' or 'English pounds'.

    The above amounts for America, Germany and Finland are purely for
comparison because the international exchange rates are constantly changing.
Your bank should calculate the amount from the marked '*' values above,
based on the exchange rates at the time.
    
    To entice you into registering, the full version of StarWoids will contain
many extra features, along with many more levels. Here's a list of proposed
features:

        o   A large number of levels.
        o   Big raytraced intro and outro animations.
        o   Raytraced intro scenes (possibly both HAM6 & HAM8).
        o   A working hi-score table (saveable to disk).
        o   Many more characters and craft.
        o   A lot more music and sound.
        o   More weapon powerups.
        o   Possible AGA version if demand is great.
        o   Proximity mines, enemy shields etc.
        o   Maximum use of FASTMEM to cache graphics/sound etc.
        o   Bascially it will kick ass.

    The full version of StarWoids is not yet complete (as of the 8th July
1994), so any of the above are subject to change (just as anything could be
included). We are keen to hear any comments and suggestions for inclusion in
the full release, so feel free to include ideas with your registration fee.

    To register, all you need to do is send the registration fee and the
registration form to either of these address (the choice is yours):

            Martin Kift             Rowan Crawford
            23 Davis Street         Flynns Creek Upper
            Plasmarl                Via Traralgon 3844
            Swansea. SA2 8PP        Victoria
            S.Wales, UK             Australia

    Your registered version with have your name on the title screen stating
that it is registered to you. As protection for us, each registered copy
will also have that persons name and registration number embeded into the
program in several places. This will allow us to easily track down anyone
who spreads the full version around (so don't do it). Please keep in mind
how much work we have put into this product.
                        
Message To PD Libraries
=======================

    This product is FreeWare, however you are free to distribute this program
for the usual cost of a disk and the copying fee. You may NOT distribute the
registered version under any circumstances.

    The demo may be distributed in either DMS or unpacked form (this applies
to Fred Fish too), so long as ALL files are present, and nothing is added or
changed. CD distribution is also allowed, but only as two DMS files, and we
must receive a free CD each (ie. one disk each for Martin, Rowan and Rob).


    Please register :-)

@node SYSTEM "System Requirements" 

Memory
======

    StarWoids should work on all Amigas with at least 1 meg of memory.
    However, a machine running with only 512k of chip memory may not work
    with all features turned on.

    See @{" Music and TOOLTYPES " link TOOLTYPES} for more information.

Speed
=====

    Machines with fast processors will have a much smoother game, although
    it is still playable on 68000 based machines. Fast ram is recommended
    on all machines to maximum game speed and smoothness.

    See @{" Bugs and Problems " link BUGS} for more information.
