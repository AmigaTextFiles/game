/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X What is  Divumex? X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\

This  is  a  preview  of  a  game  I  am being developing.  It's a vertical
shoot'em up, designed as a tribute to Xevious, a game produced by Namco and
Atari in the early 80s.

Being this a preview, there are many things missing that will be introduced
once finished.  Many other improvements will be done (alien behaviour, ship
movement,  sound  effects  and so on).  Thus don't think the game looks too
primitive!



X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\ DISCLAIMER X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X\X

In  my  full  consciousness  I ensure this game to be a whole production of
mine.   It  has been redesigned from scratch.  I do not own anything coming
from  the  original  coinop  besides a couple of photos.  The demo you have
just downloaded tries to be as similar as possible to the original game but
there are also many differences (graphics, alien movement) that will remain
in the final version too, mainly because this is a *tribute*, and in no way
it will be any kind of porting.

Moreover,  I  didn't  develop  this game for money.  Actually it is totally
freeware and you're free to do whatever you like, apart from modify or hide
the  author  name, or distribute without the document files as a commercial
product,  in  any  support  (disks, cds), Urban Mueller's AmiNet collection
being the only exception.

To demonstrate that this is *not* a copy from the coin-op, i'm ready to put
at anyone's disposal all Divumex sources and graphic screens.

Finally,  I  won't  be  held  responsible  for  any  damage occurred by the
[mis]use of this program.  Anyway it has been tested very carefully by many
people with different machines, and no problems have been found.

I  would be really glad if anyone who have tried Divumex sends me comments,
bugreports, or suggestions!



/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\ Compatability /X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\

This game requires Kick 2.0 at least. It has been successfully tested on
the following machines:

Amiga 1200 base
Amiga 1200 w/ fast ram
Amiga 3000
Amiga 4000

As  said before, it worked well but this does not implies that this program
is free of bugs!

The  game  should  work  on  68k  based  machines  too,  there shouldn't be
compatability troubles; anyway it might be slower at times.

I  couldn't  test  it  on any graphics card and I fear it won't work there.
Anyway I'd really thank anybody who can do it for me.

I  used Enforcer (by Michael Sinz) to check for suspicious memory accesses,
and none did happen.

In  case  of trouble, I'd really appreciate a rather exhaustive description
in  E-Mail  (or  fidonet  netmail).   A  message saying just "hey, it won't
work!" would be rather useless ;)



\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\ Warning \X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\

Divumex  may  be  installed  on  your  hard  disk.  Just note that it fully
disables  the  multitasking,  so  be  careful  there  isn't any disk/serial
accesses while you run the program!



\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\ Game Rules X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X/

Fly.  Shoot.  Kill the aliens.  That's all.  :)

You  have  two  weapons:  air-to-air torpedoes and air-to-ground bombs.  At
every  click  of  the  jostick button, the ship will shoot one of both, the
former going upward, the latter ending on the cross-target drawn above your
ship.

You can kill more than one ground target with a single shot, just target in
the middle.  Up to 4 objects can be hit!

When the blue cross target flies over a fireable object, it turns red.

After  you've  been  shot, the game ends.  This is a demo version; i'll add
more lives further on!

At any time you can quit the game by clicking the left mouse button.



\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X Tecnichal Notes X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\

This  game has been written in 100% assembly, and by now it's made of 9,000
source lines.

The  intro  screen has been designed by me, realized with a RayTracer, then
cutted to 32 colours.

Maps  and  object  trajectors have been realized with a stand-alone program
made just for that purpose :)
