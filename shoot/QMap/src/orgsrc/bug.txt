QMAP: Quake level viewer
Copyright 1997 Sean Barrett

Unless a bug is really heinous, I probably won't fix it.
Bugs of the form "This doesn't run on my machine, and I
know a two line fix to make it work" I'm interested in.
Bugs like those listed below (pure algorithmic bugs) I'm
interested in as well.

I do not intend to merge back in ported versions of QMAP;
the source is small enough (and unlikely to undergo
further revision) that such distributions can stand alone.

To find the current bug contact email address, check
the distribution site, which is currently:

Known bugs:

  For running levels:

     e1m4.bsp, under the water there's lots of incorrectly
     lit textures--even on axially aligned surfaces.  what's
     up with that?
