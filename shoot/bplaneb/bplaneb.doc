1.0 Introduction

    Biplane Blitz is an arcade game for those with a nostalgia for
 the blocky graphics and garish colors of the 8 bit computers.
 It features dual playfields with double scrolling. 
 
    The game has been tested on an A1000, A500, and 16MZ A3000 using
 both OS1.3 and OS2.1. Although it runs smoother on the A3000,
 it works fine on the slower machines.

2.0 Controls 

  The plane is controlled with the joystick. Like a lot of the old
 WW1 biplanes, pushing forward on the joystick causes the plane to
 rise. The firebutton controls the machine gun. Pulling back on the joystick
 while holding the firebutton down will release a bomb. If
 you prefer, the controls can be reversed by pulling back on the
 joystick while the music is playing during the opening title screen.
 Clicking the left mouse button while the plane is in the air will pause the
 game. Clicking the mouse again will start it. The game can be exited by
 clicking the left mouse button while the plane is sitting on the runway,
 but hasn't started to move.

  The game can be started from the CLI or by clicking on its' icon.
 Holding down the j/s firebutton while the music is playing will start
 the game, or it will start its' self after the music finishes.
 The plane can be made to start its' takeoff by pushing the j/s
 firebutton again. You have to reach 60 MPH before you can takeoff.
 Other planes can be shot at with your machine gun, but you must
 be at the same altitude. If the other plane is higher, a up arrow
 will appear in the upper left hand corner of the screen. If it
 is below you, it will point down. When you are at the same altitute,
 a "C" will appear (C for collision course). You can also bomb
 targets (no straffing in this version). The red targets are worth
 twice the blue targets.

  A "F" will appear in the upper right corner of the screen when
 your fuel runs low. I suggest you land as soon as the landing strip appears.
 If you crash, you can restart the game by holding down the j/s firebutton.
  
3.0 Object

  The main objective of the game is to destroy your foes symbol of
 his air superiority. But before you can fly this final mission,
 you must prove yourself by flying increasingly difficult missions.
 Only when you have gained enough points will you be allowed to
 fly the next mission in succession. When you have proved yourself
 worthy, you fly the final mission.

4.0 Note

  You should disable your screen saver (if it doesn't detect j/s movement).
They have an annoying habit of blanking your screen at a critical time.
