@node Description

 A Description of the Game, Target_Shoot.
 ----------------------------------------

        This was the first shoot'em up game I wrote.  This game uses the
 Magic_Forest.iff picture and the MFSprites.abk from the Amos1.3 data
 disk.  Both have been slightly altered.  The game was inspired from the
 game 'Bounce' by Aaron Fothergill, but instead of catching Apples, you
 shoot anything that moves.

        Target_Shoot is very easy to play, the Rules are written right on
 the Screen.  when you are ready to Start, just Click Left Mouse Button,
 You have 60 seconds to shoot as many items as you can.  To play again,
 CLMB twice, first to reset the screen and then to restart the game.  To
 End the game Click the Right Mouse Button.  The one with the greater
 amount of hits is the winner.  You'll have to be swift to get the bird,
 (no bun intended).

        That's about it, this game was written for an Amos Club 10 Liner
 competition, but never sent in.  Have fun!

 drawings, so must take full blame for any Bugs that are in it.  The
 game is Giftware, if your child likes to play it, why not send me a card.
