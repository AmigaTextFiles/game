About:

	This is a MorphOS version of Descent:Freespace 2.
	It's based on Icculus port done by Taylor Richards
	(http://icculus.org/freespace2/)

Requirements:

	MorphOS 1.4.x
	3D Drivers
	powersdl.library by Ilkka Lehtoranta

	256MB of RAM should be enough, but i don't guarantee
	that everything will work fine with that amount.

	Radeon card is strongly recomended.
   
Notes:

	There might be some small gfx glitches (especialy in nebula).
	Network game is not available in this version.
	Mods were not tested.

Important!!!11:

	Because of unknown problem with SDL (i think it's SDL at least)
	some key shortuts may not work correctly. If You find such key
	or combinations of keys then simply redefine it to something
	else in settings (F2). You will have to do it during training
	missions.

Installation:

	You will need 3CD version to install it with provided install
	script. It was tested with English and Polish versions.
	Copy files from this archive to directory where you want
	the game to be installed and start Install script.
