*** 2000-Jun-15 cyclone-0.2.11

- new bullet images
- added right-ctrl and right-shift as alternate firing
  keys.
- updated most of the sprite images and the intro,
  I'm playing with materials in blender.
- changed loading and ready images to alpha blended.
  they look much better now.

*** 2000-Jun-13 cyclone-0.2.10

- switched the code to use png's instead of bmp's.
- removed net code for win32 cross compile
- add misc SDL libs on the front of the lib path (for win32)
- fixed configure to check for SDL before SDL_mixer.
- added net subdirectory containing a client and server
  for cyclone. This code will need to be ported to
  other platforms, and integrated with the main cyclone 
  app.
- apparently, under windows you need to deal with events 
  before showing the window will work. Now the intro
  screen has the init code inside the event loop.
- oops. the radar was accidentally mirrored. fixed.

*** 2000-Jun-09 cyclone-0.2.9

- move image/sound loading into the intro, and display "loading"
  message.
- added screenshot key. "S"
- fixed a bug in the collision check.
- recentered the image of the player ship. it was a little off.
- the drones now wander aimlessly when they are not close to the
  player.
- vast improvement on the radar drawing speed. This added
  several points to the frame rate. Thanks to Sam Langinga for 
  pointing out how bad the old code was!

*** 2000-Jun-08 cyclone-0.2.8

- reduced the turn rate for kamikaze drones. the 
  game is now a litte easier, so I really need to
  add the new enemy type.
- updated the README to reflect the fact that you need
  to run "make install" before the game will work now.
- moved some functions that are called VERY frequently
  into the header file as inlines.
- added impact sounds for enemy ships colliding with player
- only create shrapnel when colliding, if enemies are shot,
  the explode. (need to add a visual explosion effect)
- removed surface leak in initialization code.
- enable RLEACCEL for numbers.
- minor code cleanups
- updated some sound effects
- improved the drone sprites. updated the intro screen.
- added "effects". the first one is shrapnel when a drone explodes.
- fixed bug: if you quit or die while playing, then start
  a new game, it adds 200 enemies, rather than setting
  the total to 200.

*** 2000-Jun-06 cyclone-0.2.7

- changed to use the compiled-in DATAPATH.
- default to fullscreen double buffered.
- build RPMs now.
- made the radar blips bigger.

*** 2000-Jun-05 cyclone-0.2.6

- fixed a bug in the sound code that was causing an Illegal
  Operation in windows98 when the game exits.

*** 2000-Jun-04 cyclone-0.2.5

- added cheesy sound effects
- several internal code cleanups
- the default enemy is now a kamikaze drone. when it gets within
  300 pixels of the player, it turns toward the ship.
- reduced the enemy count since the kamikaze thing makes it MUCH
  harder
- increased the range of the radar
- fixed display of ship health (it was only going 1/2 way up)

*** 2000-Jun-02 cyclone-0.2.4

- added an intro screen
- when the player loses all ships, the game goes back to the intro
- added a radar
- moved object functions into a seperate ObjectType structure.
- added a damage system. by default objects have 100 hitpoints.
  bullets to damage that is exponentially less as they get older.
  missiles to constant damage.
- added a number of reserve ships for the player. They aren't used
  yet, but are show on the screen.
- gave the ship 500 hitpoints, and when it is killed it
  decrements the reserve ship count.
- display the ship health on-screen
- hide the mouse cursor
- added missing acinclude.m4
- removed AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL since it's not used (yet)

*** 2000-Jun-01 cyclone-0.2.3
