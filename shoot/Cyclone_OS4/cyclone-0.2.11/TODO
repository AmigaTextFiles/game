Things I have to do NOW:

- user interface
- add a pause key
- add a new enemy which shoots at the player
- fix clipping at the top and left edges, so Xark will be happy.
- for slow machines with low frame rates the bullets can
  go right through an enemy
- better sounds
- ship immune for a few seconds when you first become visible.
- command line arg for no sound
- command line arg for data path
- make "levels" that get progressively harder
- bullet impact sound
- distinct missile sounds (impact, explosion, etc)
- joystick support

Cool ideas to add:

- powerups: 
  - health
  - stronger firepower
  - rapid fire missiles
  - heat seeking missiles
  - shields
  - galaga style dual ship
- background tiling - map editor
- moving obstacles (asteroids in space)
- black hole
- gun overheat
- death blossom
- multiple missile rack
- debris
- drop mines (proximity, or timed), chain reaction
- self aiming gun
- rear gun
- slave mode: capture enemy ships and they fly in formation
  with you. change formations with keys.
- energy suck weapon
- magnetic mines - long distance. speed related to distance
- small drones link to form bigger drones
- different enemies join to combine features
- fireball weapon - longer lifetime, faster than the ship, but
  with a larger turning radius. impact does not destroy it, it
  just keeps going and causing damage.

Grandiose Plans:

- multiplayer (32?) (client/server?)
- loadable modules with new enemies and weapons/powerups
- a nice mpeg intro movie
- shadows
- bank ship as it turns.
- cloaking
- decoy ship (hologram)
- pixel-precise collision check using a monochrome collision mask, 
  restrict to 32 pixel wide sprites.

Milestones:

0.3 multiple levels
0.4 powerups
0.5 multiplayer
1.0 polishing
