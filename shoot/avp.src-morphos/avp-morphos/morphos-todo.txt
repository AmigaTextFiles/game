Bugs:
	* Make savegames work.

	* AHI shutdown issue

	* buttons for opening doors do not work 
		* ObjectID should never be byteswapped (md5_buffer should though)

	* Crash : seems gfx related
		* gluBuild2DMipmaps in TinyGL seem unstable or I am using it wrong.
		  Problem seem to be gone now that I am using my own code to generate mipmaps.

	- Flickering background on loading screens



Compatability:
	* Proper Morphos/AmigaOS name and version string embedded in the exe

	* byteswapping macros should only be doing something when building for PPC targets (in case you would want to build this on x86)

	* Make sure that it works with both the old "Gold Edition" and the latest "Classic2000" from Steam.

	* Test if it works works with "Aliens vs Predator Classic Redux" hi-res mod
		* IT LOOKS F*CKING AWESOME!
		- look into fixing the crash when using modded avp_huds/marweap.rif (it crashes PC version of GoldEd as well)
			(marine hud is messed up without loading this rif file so it needs a fix or a mod of the mod)
			(texturesize limit is useful when running this mod, especially for gfx cards with little VRAM)

	* Texture rescaling (useful for AvP Redux mod, original game is max 256x256 anyways)
		- expose to graphics options menu
		- honor texture size limitation of gfxcard

	- Make it build and run on AmigaOS4
		- need to buy an AmigaOS4 computer - Sam440/460 with Radeon 9200?
	
	- Networked play need complete implementation. Prefferably compatible with Classic 2000 version.
	
	

Performance:
	* Double check that culling is properly working and not still disabled from earlier debugging.
	
	* Disable software clipping of partially-inside triangles, it is likely to be faster to just render them as-is.

	* Generate and use mipmaps

	* Support creating 16bit texture instead of always converting to 32bit
		- Add a "medium" setting for 16bit + 32bit alpha textures
	
	- Add performance timers and a simple profiler to find bottlenecks
	
	- Optimize OpenGL renderer in general

	

Polish:

	* Better message when missing data files
		* Option to install game data files from any location
		- Add a nice picture on the first installation message window
		- Option to rip Audio CD2 to .ogg or .bnk audio files

	* get rid of logfile spamming

	* Add "sourcepackage" target to Makefile

	* Create Aminet readme files

	* Make sure the command shell never shows up when running the game from Workbench

	* auto grab mouse on startup 

	* remove annoying keyboard debounce delay when operating the audio volume sliders in menus
	
	* modernize inputs
		* make default keybindings similar to modern shooters
		- add reload-ammo action and keybind for Marine
		
	* FMV playback
		* build and link the game with libavcodec from ffmpeg
		* streamline build rules to make libs that only include what avp needs for playing bink, smacker and ogg.
		* get rid of log output from libav
		* implement out-of-game fmv sequences (cutscenes+menu background)
			* video
			* audio
		* implement ingame videoscreen fmv sequences
			* video
			* audio

	* Music playback
		* Classic2000 - bink audio playback
		* Add menu+profile option to disable music
		* Music volume controllable from menu option
		* Test that it works ok without the music files
		- Gold Edition - ogg vorbis playback
			- installer should be able to rip the music from AudioCD2

	- Graphics:
		* Remake video settings menu
			* Add Texture quality option (32/16bpp)
			* Add Mipmap option
			* Add Fullscreen/windowed option
		- Enumerate video modes instead of hardcoded list
		- save resolution as width/height instead of an index to the resolution list
		- properly support widescreen resolutions (horizontal FOV change - beware the clipper)
		- get rid of frontend software rasterizer and replace with OpenGL.
			(frontend would no longer be locked to 640x480x16bpp)
			(gets rid of unprofessional looking mode-switch between frontend and game)
			(a good compromise would be to let the frontend just draw to an opengl texture)

	- Adjust ingame credits on loadtime to add linux+aros+openal+morphos etc. credits.

	- Get rid of SDL dependencies, it is only used for window/input/menu drawing
		- window/input message loop -> native
		- menu drawing -> rasterize to opengl texture

	- MUI launcher for changing settings ahead of time
