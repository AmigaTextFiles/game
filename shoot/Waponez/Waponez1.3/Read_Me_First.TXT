wHY rELEASE tHE fULL vERSION aS fREEWARE?..

   This game, Waponez, was one of the first games made by NC.Gamez. I
was very proud of it a year ago (when it was released as shareware).
But today I think it stinks! And as no one has payed the fee, I've
decided to release the full version as freeware!
   So don't care about the 'this game may not be spread out' texts.
You may spread 'n' play this game as much as you want! There are five
huge, tough levels for ya' to fly shoot your way through (if you can
live with the slow gameplay that is!).



rESPONSE...

   If you like the game, send me an e-mail! But DO NOT think that
this is the quality of NC.Gamez' currently released games! I'm fully
aware of how much this game sucks!
