AirAce2 is a game designed by Robert Grace of Kansas City, Missouri, USA
 using Accolade's wonderful Shoot'Em Up Construction Kit.
 Thanks go to Richard Turner of Independence, Missouri for his inspiration
 and ideas. They added greatly to the enjoyment of playing (and making!)
 AirAce2.

AirAce2 was designed in 3 months (Nov'89-Jan'90) with finishing touches
 added in Sept'90.
