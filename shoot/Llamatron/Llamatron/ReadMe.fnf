This material was submitted to me on disk by Andries Munnik, who received
it directly from Jeff Minter with a request to pass a copy on for inclusion
in the library.  Thanks Andries and Jeff!

I added a couple of icons to allow execution from the WorkBench via Xicon,
added a file for the README, and packed everything up in an lharc archive
with an appropriate script to make a separate game play disk.
