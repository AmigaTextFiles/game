1.0 Introduction-------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 System requirements
-----------------------

An AGA Amiga with 4Mb fast RAM. 030 or better recommended.

1.2 Specifications
------------------

The Cold Blood 3D system is designed for creating 3D shoot-em-up games. It 
features:

 - 1*1 resolution using fast c2p
 - floor and ceiling texture mapping
 - variable floor and ceiling height
 - non-orthoganal walls
 - sprite-based enemies and objects
 - advanced lighting effects (moving light sources, smoke and halo effects)

A single easy to use editor is provided for creating new levels and editing
game parameters.

1.3 Playing the demo levels
---------------------------

To play any level just click on the icon. When the level is finished it may
link to another one.

Game controls:

  m  -  mouse
  k  -  keys
  v  -  vertical mouse options (locked/normal/reverse)

  mouse mode:

    move mouse to look
    cursor keys to move

    left mouse   -  shoot
    right mouse  -  operate

  keys mode:

    left/right cursor to turn
    up/down cursor to move
    right amiga to force sidestep

    right alt  -  shoot
    space      -  operate

  general:

    keypad 1  -  look down
    keypad 7  -  look up
    keypad 4  -  re-centre
    shift     -  run
    keypad 0  -  jump
    keypad .  -  crouch
    t         -  torch
    s         -  gun sight (in four different flavours)
    1-9       -  change weapon 
    
  screen mode:

    keypad +  -  increase screen size
    keypad -  -  reduce screen size
    keypad (  -  vertical resolution
    keypad )  -  horizontal resolution
    Enter     -  toggle full/quarter screen
 
Playing hints:

There are two ways to play this: either go through the level stealthily
using the silenced pistol, shooting out lights and drawing the enemies
into traps, or just wade in with the assault rifle and send them all
straight to hell. In practice you need to do a bit of both.
You must remember that the enemies can both see and hear you. You can
creep up behind one if you move very slowly, otherwise he will hear your
footsteps. Use the assault rifle and enemies from all around will
converge on your position. They are smart enough to plan a route to get
to you even from the other end of the level (though they probably wouldn't
hear you from that distance). They can hear other enemies firing on you
as well as explosions, doors opening, lights breaking and in fact any 
other sound that you can hear in the game.
Shooting out the lights has two effects. First of all the enemies can't
see very well in the dark - you can go undetected more easily. Also, their
shots lose accuracy as the light level goes down. Be careful with the 
torch, it makes it easy for the enemies to see you. They can also see the
torch light even if they are not looking in your direction.
Catching enemies in chain reaction barrel explosions is a very satisfying
way to kill them, although difficult to do. Don't stand by a barrel
yourself during a gunfight: the enemies' shots can set them off too (and
they can shoot each other, which can be helpful when you're being 
attacked from two directions at once).
Use the gunsight for better targeting and the vertical mouse option for
a faster response to attacks from above and below. Use a good stereo
system or headphones, then you can hear where sounds are coming from.

3.0 Designing Graphics-------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Graphic types
-----------------

There are two kinds of graphic files, textures and objects. Objects are
drawn flat and scaled. Enemies, barrels and lights are all objects. So are
the player's guns. There are four drawing modes for objects: colour,
brighten, darken and tint. Colour is the standard mode. Brighten can be seen
in gun barrel flashes and could be used for halos around bright lights.
Darken could be used for smoke effects. Tint changes the colour of pixels
without changing their brightness. It could be used for transparent liquid
containers and possibly explosions or fire. Different modes can also be
superimposed, e.g. a colour object with tint applied to it. Textures have
only the colour drawing mode.

3.2 Palette conventions
-----------------------

For colour mode graphics, the standard palette (palette.iff) should be used.
The palette is divided into two parts. The first 32 colours are deemed
'bright'. Bright colours are not affected by lighting effects. Hence sparks,
explosions and lights are drawn in these colours. The rest of the palette
contains seven 32 colour ranges. Anything drawn with these colours is
subject to lighting effects. Colour zero is transparent for objects but not
for textures.

Brighten and darken modes use only the first 32 colours. Colour zero means
no effect. Colour 1 means Brighten/darken by one shade, and so on.

Tint mode uses only the first colour of each of the seven ranges. Tinted 
pixels will be transported directly across into the corresponding range,
without changing brightness.

Because it is possible to include some of the first 32 colours by mistake
when using certain drawing tools in art packages, it is useful to work
with the palette remap.iff and add bright colours later.

3.3 Texture graphics
--------------------

Wall textures must be 128 pixels wide and a power of 2 pixels high, e.g.

  128*16
  128*64
  128*128
  128*256

They should be placed at the top left corner of an iff picture.

If a texture is shorter than the wall it is placed on, it will be tiled.
If this is the case, it will be necessary for the top and bottom to match.

Floor textures must be 128*128 pixels in size. It is important for them to
tile properly.

3.4 Object graphics
-------------------

Objects can be any size. An important hint when drawing objects is to keep
in mind the angle that they will be seen from. Anything that is normally 
below the player's viewpoint should be drawn slightly from above. However,
the player can move and look up and down, so don't overdo the angle. Keep
things almost level, to minimise the distortion when the object is seen
from a different angle.

3.5 Characters
--------------

There are currently two types of character: walkers and floaters. The main
difference is the number of animation frames.

Walkers require the following frames:

  standing
  walking (4)
  hit by player
  attacks player
  fall over (7)
  dead

All frames except the dying animation are needed in eight directions, making
64 frames in total.

Floaters only need:

  floating
  hit by player
  attacks player
  dead

Again in eight directions, except for the dead frame.

The size of individual frames is not important, just keep the handle in the
same relative position in each frame.
