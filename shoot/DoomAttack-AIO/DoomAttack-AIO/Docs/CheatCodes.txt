To use a cheat code, just type the code while playing (can also be done while
in automap mode). After entering the last letter, a message of acknowledgment
will appear on top of the screen. The status bar, face, and in-game view may
also change, depending on the effects of the code.

Except from idclev & iddt, cheats are disabled on the "Nightmare!" skill level.
Cheat codes may be different on non-QWERTY keyboards. For example, in France,
idkfa may be idkfq, because of the AZERTY keyboard layout commonly used there.

             in Doom and The Ultimate Doom (see above for the equivalent
             idclip for Doom II).
