		  COMMANDO RAID INSTRUCTIONS AND INFO			

INTRODUCTION
  The year is 2067.  The President of the United States has been kidnapped by 
terrorists, and is now being held for ransom.  The US government has decided
that rather than paying the ransom for the president, it will send a single
special forces team to rescue him, thus saving them a great deal of money.

  You are part of the commando team that has been ordered to rescue the
president.  Your team will fly to the terrorist's base in a helicopter,
descend into the base, and attempt to rescue the president.

  The terrorist base is actually a giant cave dug several miles deep into
the ground.  You will have to travel through four caverns to reach the place
where the President is being held.

  The terrorists will unfortunately be aware of your presence, and will have
resistance forces waiting for you.  Additionally, due to the heavy demands
made upon your helicopter for the descent, fuel will be consumed very
quickly.  You will have to refuel often by shooting or bombing the fuel tanks
strewn throughout the base.

CONTROLS
  You control your helicopter with a joystick in port 1.  Move the joystick
to move the helicopter in all eight directions.  Pressing fire will shoot
a laser horizontally, and pressing fire and down at the same time will drop a
bomb.

  Press P at any time to pause.
  Press ESC at any time to quit.

INFO
  This is my first game written in Blitz Basic 2!  If you have seen my
other game, Bucktooth Bob, you'll probably say it's a big improvement...
I really like BB2 and I think it's a much better language than AMOS, I
reccommend it very highly.
  This game represents a lot of hard (but fun) work for me.  If you feel
generous, please consider sending me a donation.  Also, the entire Blitz Basic
2 source code is available, on-disk, for $7.  In any case, please contact
me if you have any comments, suggestions, etc.
  My email address (at least until July of 1994) is: wn22@cmu.edu

MISCELLANEOUS
  If you happen to see my high school senior picture floating around
somewhere in the game, don't be alarmed.  I don't really look like that.
First of all I'm older than I was then, and secondly, the image itself
has been totally butchered by being scanned, converted from GIF to IFF,
resized, having the color removed from it, etc, etc...  On the positive
side, I managed to edit the picture a bit so my hair looks better.  Thanks
to Mitch Franzos for scanning the original.
  Also, there's a secret code in the game.  If you email me, I'll tell it
to you (if you're THAT stuck in the game, which I doubt anyone with an
experienced joystick hand would be).

OTHER STUFF
  If you liked this game you might like Bucktooth Bob, although it's not as
good, it's kind of funny.  I got a lot of email messages saying that it lacked
anything resembling gameplay though, and I really tried to make up for that
with Commando Raid.
  I'm looking for some people who are interested in game development to maybe
form a group with me.  As you can probably tell, I'm not the world's
greatest musician, artist, animator, or game designer -- but I'm a pretty good
programmer.  Any artists or musicians or people with game ideas out there can
get in touch with me via my email address.
  Finally, if anyone wants to put this game in a disk magazine, please contact
me, as I'd love it if that happened.  Please distribute the game freely, and
shareware distributors should not charge anything for it except a small
fee for the disk, etc.

COMMANDO RAID 2?!
  Well....MAYBE.  If I get enough people saying they liked the game, I
might consider writing a sequel and distributing it for a small fee to 
interested people.  But unless there's a demand, I probably won't.
Future projects I have in mind include a role-playing game based on a 
unique system I developed, and maybe a sequel to my (very) old game for
the IBM, Niterun.  I had actually written a big version of Niterun 2
using AMOS only to discover that AMOS was too slow to handle the whole
thing, but I think I'd have better luck with Blitz.

  I hope you like the game!
