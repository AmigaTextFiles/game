@node Vic "Victim Generator."

The REVENGE distribution also includes a separate program that
allows you to create and edit your own victims for use in the
game, this program is Vic-Gen.


Would you like to @{"run Vic-Gen now?" system "Vic-Gen" 0}


It's very easy to use and fairly self explanatory, but here are
the instructions anyhow.


@{b}The top LOAD button:@{ub}

This button brings up a file requester which list all the heads
available in the "Heads" drawer. Select a head and load it in.

Take a look at @{"making your own heads" link "Headz" 0}


@{b}The bottom LOAD button:@{ub}

This button brings up a file requester which list all the samples
available in the "DeathFX" drawer. You can select one of these
samples or use the file requester to select other samples from
anywhere else. The samples should be in standard 8SVX IFF format
to be usable, this is checked by the program.
The selected sample is played when the victim is killed.


@{b}The SAVE button:@{ub}

This button is used to save your finished victim to the "Victims"
drawer for use in REVENGE.
A prefs file is also saved along with the victim.
Each victim + prefs file takes up 5k of disk space.
When a victim is saved a check is made to see if it's sample is
in the "DeathFX" drawer, if it isn't, the program will copy it
there for you (that's nice of it).


@{b}The SPEECH BUBBLE:@{ub}

Click on the speech bubble to hear the sample.


@{b}The SLIDER:@{ub}

This slider changes the replay period of the sample. The actual
pitch depends entirely on the replay period of the sample when
it was saved. The middle of the slider is the default period of
the sample. Move the slider up to playback higher and down to
playback lower.
The sample period is displayed in a text box.
(the lower the number, the higher the pitch)


@{b}The 3 ROWS OF COLOURED BOXES:@{ub}

Top row:    Selects the shirt colour of the victim.
            (saved as part of victim)

Bottom row: Selects the pants colour of the victim.
            (saved as part of victim)

Middle row: See how the victim looks in front of different
            coloured backgrounds.
            (purely cosmetic - not saved).


@{b}The QUIT button:@{ub}

hmmmm......



@{b}STUFF TO REMEMBER:@{ub}

* Vic-Gen loads HEADS and saves VICTIMS
  To change an existing victim, reload its head, alter the
  settings, and save it again.

* Samples should be SHORT, SHARP and LOUD! Long samples could
  be used but they are more likely to be chopped off in mid-
  play by other samples in the game. As a rule the samples
  should be around 10k in size or less. Shorter samples also
  use less chip mem.

  
@endnode



@node Headz "Making your own heads."

Take a look in the "Xtras" drawer, this contains two .IFF pics
with the default heads and empty boxes plus a few guidelines
and the palette information for your own use.

    Show me the @{" default heads " system "Xtras/showiff Xtras/Heads.iff" 0}

    Show me the @{"  empty boxes  " system "Xtras/showiff Xtras/Empties.iff" 0}

These pics are stored as 320x256 .IFF's in 16 colours.

They are named "Heads.iff" and "Empties.iff".

You can load them into your favourite art package for reference
when drawing your own heads. The palette in these pictures is
pre-set and can't be changed.

You only have to draw a head in four positions - forwards, left,
backwards and right.

The heads you design must be cut out (along the dotted lines)
as standard "brushes" and saved to the "Heads" drawer for use
by Vic-Gen (each brush should be 62x15 pixels in size).

All that remains to be done then is start up Vic-Gen, load in
your new head, choose the body colours and sound effect and
save it as a new victim for use in REVENGE (and then kill it
as frequently as you like :-)


@{b}I WANT YOUR HEADS@{ub}

I want to get together a huge collection of heads for inclusion
in the next release of REVENGE.

Please see @{" Send Me Your Heads " link "Headz2" 0} for info.

@endnode

@node Headz2 "Send me your heads."

As "payment" for getting this game for free you are requested
to send in some heads (even one will do) that you design for
inclusion in the next release of REVENGE.

The best ones will have their own "author named" drawer within
the distribution. Hey, you'll be famous!


@{b}FOUR WAYS TO SEND IN YOUR HEADS@{ub}


1> Direct to me via e-mail (the fastest way)

   to:    simon@gadge.u-net.com


2> Upload them to Aminet (probably to the Games/Data section)
   
   Just a few words about naming conventions :-)

   If you just include HEADS in the archive you can name the
   archive  
               RevHed_something.lha

   Or if you include HEADS/VICTIMS/SAMPLES you can name the
   archive
               RevAll_something.lha

   Replace the (something) with some text unique to your archive
   e.g.
               RevHed_Batman.lha
   or          RevAll_Batman.lha   for instance :-)

   This will keep the archives together in the Aminet listings
   and also enable them to be found easily when searched for.


3> Direct to me on disk via post

   to:    Simon Hitchen
          33 Bodmin Road
          Middleton
          LEEDS
          LS10 4PL
          England


4> Send them in to Amiga Format as CD contributions
   and I'll get them from there.


Use all four methods if you wish (then I'll definitely receive
them) but at least use one of them.

@endnode

@node Wep "Weapons."

Weapons can be selected at any time during play with the F-keys.

There are basically two types of weapon: Front firing
                                     and Top firing

Front firing weapons should be aimed anywhere on (or near) the
selected victim.

Top firing weapons should be aimed at (or near to) the feet of
the selected victim.

All weapons have "Kill Zones" and "Maim Zones". A good shot will
kill instantly and a close shot will injure victims, causing them
to limp and bleed for a while until they recover.

New "Smart" weapons - the bullets home in on the gun sights.

Most weapons are fired with the left mouse button but there is
one exception to this (see F10 - AIR STRIKE for info)


@{fg shine}F1  - SHOTGUN@{fg text}
  > Front firing
  > Instant hit
  > Good blast area

@{fg shine}F2  - ARNIE-GUN@{fg text}
  > Front firing
  > Instant hit
  > Rapid fire rate

@{fg shine}F3  - PHOTON TORPEDO@{fg text}
  > Top firing
  > Smart weapon
  > Boldly kills where no weapon has killed before

@{fg shine}F4  - PULSE LASER@{fg text}

@endnode



@node MM "Maximum Mayhem."

The original "Kill Everything As Fast As Possible" game mode
as used in the first Armchair Assassin game.

When using this mode your high scores are placed on high score
tables 1 - 5 (depending on the victim speed setting).

@endnode



@node SS "Sequential Slaughter."

The new "Kill Everything, But In Strict Sequence" game mode.

In this mode you can only kill the victim that is indicated
with a flashing light above its head.

Any of the others that get in the way of stray bullets can
be injured as normal but they can't be killed, sure you can
blast them to pieces just for fun but their heads will soon
regenerate a new body and off they go again, fighting fit.

When using this mode your high scores are placed on high score
tables 6 - 10 (depending on the victim speed setting).

@endnode



@node Play "Fun Time."

When all the victims have been killed the timer stops but the
game doesn't end there and then, instead it goes into the new
"fun time" mode.

In this mode you can blast away at the heads for as long as
you want, perhaps testing weapons or just blasting away at
the "not-quite-dead-heads" without further time penalties and
without your shots being counted towards the kill ratio of
the current game.

Fun time mode can be ended as normal with the "Q" key.

@endnode



@node Mod "Music Mods."

In the main game drawer there is a drawer named "Music".

You can copy your own music modules into this drawer if you
want to have music on the start screen or high score tables.

You can include 2 different modules.


VERY IMPORTANT STUFF ABOUT THE MUSIC

* Music modules must be in PROTRACKER compatable format
  (sorry no meds yet, maybe in future)

* They must not be PACKED in any way

* They must be renamed as  @{fg shine}start.mod@{fg text}
                   and/or  @{fg shine}high.mod@{fg text}

* Try to use mods that aren't too massive as they do use up
  valuable chip memory. Mods that are too big to fit in the
  available chip mem will not be loaded (check available
  memory by pressing the space bar on the options screen).


There is a high.mod included in the distribution, it's just
a little (only 30k) tune I found on an early magazine
coverdisk CD.
The original name of the module was "MOD.swing the pub" but
I could find no docs for it so I can't credit the author
in my docs (sigh).

@endnode



@node dna "Alien DNA experiment."

Use your very own alien invader to perform weird genetic
experiments on the hapless victims.

You have at your disposal a state-of-the-art alien medical
research and humanoid DNA experiment craft. It's just a
shame that the pilot is only a learner.

This means that the DNA experiments are not a total success
and the results are a bit unpredictable.

What tends to happen is either the DNA wears off after a
while and the victim recovers his former shape or the DNA
becomes unstable and the victim dies.

The best feature of this weapon is that the DNA infection
can be passed on to other victims by touch and can spread
itself around like the plague. This can do wonders for the
kill-ratio as one shot could kill lots of victims.

One drawback of this weapon is that when the victims are
infected with alien DNA they become immune to all other
puny earth weapons until it wears off.

When a victim is infected a green blob appears on his
mug shot at the bottom of the screen, you can quickly see
the extent of the infection in this panel.

@endnode



@node fire "Fireball."

This weapon is a bit like the Alien DNA Experiment in that
when a victim is hit by a fireball he bursts into flame
himself and frantically runs around at increased speeds to
try and put the flames out.

If he bumps into another victim he may also set that victim
on fire and so the flames can spread.

The result of being set on fire can have two outcomes, if
the victim runs fast enough he may be able to put out the
flames and make a full recovery, or, he may die.

Like the DNA, when a victim is on fire he can't be killed
by any other weapon (that would be far too cruel).

When a victim is on fire an orange blob appears on his
mug shot at the bottom of the screen, you can quickly see
how far the fire has spread in this panel.

@endnode



@node air "Air strike."

Probably the biggest air strike in the world.


How to use this meaty weapon....

a) Select it with F10 (of course)

b) Place the first "laser guide pad" with the LEFT MOUSE button

c) Place the second "laser guide pad" with the RIGHT MOUSE button

d) Sit back and wait for the BOMBS THE SIZE OF HOUSES and the
   EXPLOSIONS THE SIZE OF SMALL TOWNS to arrive.

e) Go back to "step b" and repeat as required

@endnode



@node Require "Requirements."

An AGA Amiga (versions for PAL & NTSC displays)

Fast mem preferred but not essential

Accelerator preferred but not essential

A volume control (turned up)

@endnode


@node Install "Installation."

No installation required.

Just copy the entire game drawer anywhere you like.

REVENGE doesn't require any assigns to be made and it
doesn't spread files all over your system.

@endnode


@node Gameplay "Gameplay."

On the start screen press any key or the left mouse button
to continue.

On the options screen, use the four "ARROW KEYS" and the
"RETURN" key to select and change the game options, these
are as follows:

@{fg shine}VICTIM SPEED@{fg text}
  > How fast the little devils leg it.
  > Ranges from 1 (slowest) to 5 (fastest).
  > Change with left/right arrow keys.

@{fg shine}GAME MODE@{fg text}
  > The type of game you want to play.
  > Can be either @{"Maximum Mayhem" link "MM" 0} or @{"Sequential Slaughter" link "SS" 0}.
  > Change with left/right arrow keys.

@{fg shine}CHAT TIME@{fg text}
  > How long the victims stop for a natter with each other
    to decide their next move. If they like each other they
    may go for a walk together or if they hate each other
    they may leave in opposite directions.
  > This can range from 1 (shortest chat) to 8 (longest).
    The length of time spent chatting will be beneficial
    for some weapons but detrimental for others depending
    on the setting (but you can only find this out by
    playing the game - so it's up to you).
  > Change with left/right arrow keys.

@{fg shine}GROUND TYPE@{fg text}
  > Which background is used in the game.
  > 8 backgrounds available or it can also be set to
    pick a background at random for each game.
  > Change with left/right arrow keys.

@{fg shine}EDIT VICTIMS@{fg text}
  > Choose which victims (and how many) you want to wipe
    from the face of the earth.
  > Press return to select.
  > Tell me more about @{"editing victims" link "EDITVIC" 0}.

@{fg shine}SAVE OPTIONS@{fg text}
  > Saves all the game options and your chosen victim prefs
    as default options. These are read in and used each time
    the game is run.
  > Allows you to have your preferred options already
    set up and raring to go at start-up.
  > Press return to save options.

@{fg shine}START@{fg text}
  > Press return to start the game (the best bit).
  > On the game screen press LEFT MOUSE to continue.
  > The timer starts when the victims have fled.
  > Weapons can now be selected with F1-F10.
  > Victims can now be obliterated (yes)!
  > During play you can abort the game by pressing "Q"
  > When all victims are dead and the game is in
    "Fun Time" mode, press "Q" to exit to the high score
    tables.
  > On the high score tables press any key or left mouse
    to get back to the start screen.

@{fg shine}QUIT TO DOS@{fg text}
  > "Does exactly what it says on the tin".
    (but it does ask you to confirm it first).
  > Press return to quit.

@{fg shine}MUSIC VOLUME@{fg text}
  > This option only appears if you have a start.mod
    loaded.
  > Press F1 to F8 to change the music volume.


@{b}A USEFUL FEATURE@{ub}

On the options screen you can press the space bar to
toggle information about how much memory is available
on your machine at present. This can be very useful in
deciding the size of music mods or sound FX that could
be used (these require chip mem).


@{b}IMPORTANT - FILES WHICH MUST EXIST@{ub}

The following files in this distribution MUST NOT be
deleted because they are used as default files by the
game if other files can't be found.

Victims/Bill-Grates.vic      (default victim)
Victims/Bill-Grates.prefs    (his prefs)
DeathFX/Death1 (2..3..to..8) (default sound FX)
Heads/Bill-Grates            (default head)

@endnode



@node EDITVIC "The EDIT VICTIMS page."

Select which victim slot you want to edit with the up/down
arrow keys.

Change the amount of your selected victim with the
left/right arrow keys (min 0 - max 60 depending on how
many other victims are also selected).

Press return to replace the selected victim with another
from the list of available victims.
  > Use the arrow keys to choose a new victim
  > Press return to use this new victim in the game

Select "DONE" to return to the options screen.


@{b}MORE STUFF ABOUT VICTIMS@{ub}

The total number of victims selected affects how fast
the timer runs in the game (time IS relative). This makes
games fair when comparing scores between games with
different numbers of victims.

How fast your machine is makes a difference to how many
victims you can select and still keep everything running
at full speed.

The scrolling will ALWAYS be at the correct speed and so
will the timer (these are run on interrupts).

Only the victims and your weapons will slow down if too
many victims are selected (which is a disadvantage 'cos
the timer wont slow down)

@{b}So....how many victims can I run at full speed?@{ub}

  Comparisons on different machine setups: (PAL version)

  A1200 14mhz 020 - Chip mem only - 26 victims  :-(

  A1200 14mhz 020 - Fast+Chip     - 48 victims  :-)

  A1200 28mhz 020 - Fast+Chip     - 60 victims  :-))

  A1200 50mhz 030 - Fast+Chip     - 60 victims  :-))

  A1200 25mhz 040 - Fast+chip     - 60 victims  :-))

Conclusion.....At least get some fast mem!


@{b}HOW TO FIND OUT@{ub} if it's all running at full speed.

  > Start a game
  > Select weapon F2 (Arnie Gun)
  > Fire continually at bare ground
  > If the sound stops and starts you are running too
    many victims (the sample is timed to loop and play
    as a continuous sound if the game loop is running
    at full speed). You should try again with a few
    less victims.
  > If the sound loops smoothly you can try again with
    a few more victims (up to the maximum of 60)


I would like to hear about how many victims can be run
on different machine/processor/memory set-ups at full
speed as possible so the info can be included in future
releases of REVENGE (more info on NTSC version needed).

        @{"Contacting me via e-mail" link "email" 0}


@{b}A FURTHER NOTE@{ub}

You can of course run the game with too many victims if
you want and if you're prepared to put up with:
> Some sound samples being slightly mis-timed...
> Victims which speed up after some are killed...
> Ditto for weapons...

As mentioned earlier, the screen scrolling will always
run at full speed and this makes the game look OK even
if too many victims are used.

@node Bugs "No Bugs."

None known at the time of this release (Dec 98).
* PAL  V1.20
* NTSC V1.10


NOT BUGS - (Just things that could look like bugs).


1) The music mods I put in will not play! Why?

Check these:
  > Are they renamed correctly?
  > Are they in the right (protracker) format?
  > Are they too big to load?
  > Are they packed?
  > Are they mods at all?
  > Are they in the Music drawer?


2) Why doesn't REVENGE run on my Amiga?

  > Is your Amiga AGA?
  > Do you have enough memory available? REVENGE requires

    On a Chip only Amiga:   1,260,000 bytes (1,230k) chip

    On a Fast + Chip Amiga:   890,000 bytes (870k)   chip
                           +  670,000 bytes (655k)   fast
                           =1,560,000 bytes (1,525k) total

    available at run time.


3) If the Victim Generator is run from the Ram Disk (just after
    unpacking the archive maybe?) you will be unable to save data 
    as the program checks the disk it is run from to see if it has 
    enough free space available for the data (the Ram Disk reports 
    100% full). 
   Of course, this shouldn't be a problem seeing as you are all
    going to have this cool game permanently installed! :-)))
   
    (reported by Gerard Sweeney)


4) Vic-Gen seemed to have a minor bug which could corrupt the
    colours in the heads after loading. This should now be fixed.

    (reported by Peter Mattsson)



If you do have a genuine bug to report then please e-mail
the details to:

        simon@gadge.u-net.com

Please try to include as much info as possible
including: Amiga model, memory available, Workbench used
           extra hardware inc ram/accelerator boards etc.

         they were loaded in. (Seen by me once only, but also
         reported by another user - see "Bugs")

         Vic-Gen now runs on 320x200 screen (so there needs
         to be only one version for PAL & NTSC) 

         Visit:  http://www.gadge.u-net.com - Lots of extra
                                 heads/victims to download.


@{b}V1.02@{ub}  - Minor update to the guide (again)

         New e-mail address to send heads to.

         Revenge page on the Gadge Software website online.

@{b}V1.01@{ub}  - Minor update to the guide

         New e-mail address to send heads to.

         COMING SOON - Revenge website to be created!
         This will contain latest updates and new heads, victims
         and DeathFX samples for use in the game.
         Watch this space for more info :-))


@{b}V1.00@{ub}  - First public release of REVENGE AGA

         Based on T.V.Chubbies(tm) Armchair Assassin AGA
         (also by me)

         Total rewrite with loads of new features added,
         most of which were suggested or requested by users
         via e-mail (it really does pay to encourage software
         authors after all! - cheers peeps)

@node Future "The Future."

Gather together loads of new heads (hopefully from users) for
the next release of REVENGE.
(Go on! Get yer paint programs out!)

Maybe make a new "enhanced" victim generator with a choice of
new bodies and legs instead of the standard one.

Include some more music mods with the distribution (maybe
someone would like to send me some of their own work to be
included and credited in the distribution?). In protracker
format if possible, but I may add code to play meds as well.

Probably put it more backgrounds.

Ditto with more DeathFX samples.

You could also include info on your Amiga setup so I can get
an idea about which hardware configurations REVENGE works on
(or not).

Also I would like to know where you obtained this copy of
REVENGE so I can find out the best distribution method for
future releases.
