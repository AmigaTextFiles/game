@Node Intro "Scrotax - the Second Introduction"
                               Introduction
                               ============

Two years ago, a legend was born!  And then there was Scrotax!  Possibly
the first game written by me that wasn't Pong!  (Possibly still the only
game written by me that isn't Pong).  It had something not seen very often
in the history of the universe - originality!  It was s***e, but it was
original *h*t*, so that was OK then.  The graphics were crude, the
animation poor, the gameplay addictive, but dodgy!

And now it's Scrotax 2...

Scrotax 2 is a complete re-write of Scrotax.  The code is almost 100% new -
particularly the main game routine has been transformed from dodgy AMAL
routines to possibly even more dodgy slightly hand-made routines, but with
added flexibility and more structure!

This means that updating things is much easier, but it also means I can do
things that I couldn't do before such as add new power-ups, new enemy craft
and, most importantly, re-write that really suspicious bonus game after
level 5!

The other reason I have started again is this nagging feeling that it may
prove not to be as much fun as the original Scrotax.  The graphics and
sound have been improved a little, the game now lasts a fair bit longer (so
is possibly a little more accessible and less frustrating), there will be
more hidden bits and bonus games plus lots of interesting things, but I'm
not sure if the thing that made Scrotax so "not terrible" was the fact that
some games would last from about 2 seconds up to about 3 minutes
(maximum!!) so that it became very addictive with always time for one last
go!  It was quite difficult and quirky, but it could become difficult to
stop playing...

However, this one transforms Scrotax into the mainstream a little more.  It
needed to be written if it was going to run at roughly the same speed on
every machine (although perhaps a little jerky and crap on slower ones).
Before you had to use the even dodgier slow-down routine!  Incidentally, it
is being tested on a standard A1200 with no fancy bits (except hard drive),
so anything equal or better than that will have absolutely no problems!

Anyway, here it is!  @{" Click here for a list of new features! " Link History}

Anyway, enjoy hours of guilt-free playing (as it is not Shareware,
Giftware, Rubberware, Ghandiware or anything... it is, in fact,
Share-Your-Ware, a new concept in sharing your... erm... ware...)

@Node StartUp "Starting Scrotax"
I have tried to make Scrotax 2 as easy to run as possible.  You hardly need
instructions, but they are below anyway!  {" Click Here! "Link Bugs} if you
run into any problems getting the thing to work.

                               Installation
                               ============

Scrotax comes with two files:

SCROTAX2           : The game
SCROTAX2.GUIDE     : This guide
DEFAULT.DATA       : A data file the game runs without but is better if
                     it's there!
S/STARTUP-SEQUENCE : Only needed for disk users!

If you distribute the game, it is vital that you include BOTH files SCROTAX2
and SCROTAX2.GUIDE with it, otherwise you are infringing copyright
(probably...)

When it loads it will create a data file SCROTAX2.DATA containing the high
scores and everything (providing you save).


                            Floppy Installation
                            ===================

1. Format a disk, naming it DES
2. Copy all files mentioned above into it (ensuring STARTUP-SEQUENCE) is in
   directory S.
3. Go to a CLI prompt and type INSTALL DF0: 
   Please note that this presumes that the file INSTALL is present (it is
   not included here, but is on every Workbench disk ever).  It also
   presumes the disk is in DF0:
   You don't need INSTALL on your disk, just to be able to run it!
4. Insert disk into the internal drive and reset the computer!  The game
   will now load!  (I hope...)


                          Hard Drive Installation
                          =======================

1. Copy the entire SCROTAX directory anywhere on your hard drive (along
   with all the files present inside)
2. Delete S/STARTUP-SEQUENCE (unless you want it, it makes no difference)
3. Double click on the SCROTAX2 icon.
4. Mind you, you've probably done this if you're reading this guide.

Please note that the program looks for an assign called DES: and, if it is
not found, it will assign it to the currently open window (in workbench) or
just the current directory (if in CLI).  Therefore, you will know why you
have an extra assign at the end of it.  Also, if you run it, then move it
to a different directory, it will not re-assign it, so it will keep saving
all data into the old directory!

Basically, if you move the program, you should type this into CLI first:

ASSIGN DES: REMOVE

                                Running It
                                ==========

Simply double click it's icon!  Bit obvious really.  Alternatively, enter
SCROTAX2 at the CLI prompt.

Now, sit back and enjoy the hugely entertaining, technically amazing
(plrth!) introduction sequence!  Or press FIRE to skip it.

You will then be brought to @{" the Main Menu " Link Menewe}

Hoorah!

                           Scrotax II Main Menu
                           ====================

Very simple.  Use the joystick up/down and fire.

Select PLAY SCROTAX to @{" Play Scrotax " Link Play}

Select HIDDEN OPTIONS for an @{" Options Menu " Link Options} (the term "hidden" arose from
Scrotax v1)

Select EXIT GAME to exit the game via a requester asking you whether you
want to save and quit, just quit or not quit at all.

Alternatively... don't touch that joystick and wait for lots of interesting
bits!

@Node Play "How to Play with Scrotax..."
                                SCROTAX II
                                ==========

Not difficult.  Go left, go right.  And shoot.  You can shoot, don't
forget.

Firstly, something IMPORTANT!!  Read the WEIRD BITS/BONUS GAMES (button at
the bottom of this text bit).  If you don't something ODD may happen and
you will panic and not know what to do.  And panic.

OK, well... you control a red ball that constantly bounces up and down.
This is not just any red ball, however, because you can shoot.  Not only
that but you are Earth's last defence against the triangular nondescript
aliens and the traditionally green wibbly ones.

Well, to be quite honest, they aren't REALLY trying to take over the world,
they're just trying to get from the right hand side of the screen to the
left hand side of the screen without you shooting them.  Every time they
fly past you get a SURVIVAL POINT (ie one point), every time you shoot them
you get MORE THAN ONE POINT!  However, if you shoot more than one with the
same bullet you get a BONUS as well!

TWO AT ONCE  : Shoot two aliens in the same shot to get a 20 point bonus
THREE        :  40 points
FOUR         :  80 points
FIVE or MORE : 100 points

Getting these bonusses causes a small block with the amount of points its
worth on it.  Collecting the block gets the points!

After a while the level will end, and you will get a 100 point bonus (if
you can collect it!).  You might also receive some other bonusses here
depending on your performance.  I will leave these for you to discover,
except one!

The pacifist bonus!  If you do not shoot for an entire level you will get a
HUGE bonus (the higher the level, the higher the bonus).  Mind you, not
shooting does make things a little TRICKY!

So, what else?  Well, different enemies have different attack patterns and
are worth various amounts of points.  Different levels either introduce new
alien forms, new aliens (ie more at once) or makes them faster!  The last
level is just a continuous barrage of aliens at the fastest, hardest speed
until you die.  Ha ha.

So, if the game goes on forever, what is the point?  Well, the point is to
get a huge score and go top of the high score table!  Also note that there
are lots of hidden bits, so the more you play, the more you discover!  Try
varying your tactics or playing pathetically and see what happens!

Also note that there are various bonus games that occur occasionally for
various reasons.  Also, there are some WEIRD BITS - ie unusual levels!

At the end of the level, you are presented with some statistics relating to
your performance (unless you've turned them OFF!)

@Node Enemy "KILL THEM SCUMBAGS!
                     IDENTIFYING THE SCUM OF THE EARTH
                     =================================

NUMBER 1 (10 Points)
========

He's triangular, he's blue, he's a bit of a bugger, he's the blue triangle!
He can be found on every level, and just moves in an ordinary manner.

NUMBER 2 (10 Points)
========

It's yellow, it's a number two, it's the yellow number two!  There's only
one yellow alien, and it's like, hey! wow! a space ship!  Great news!
Well, anyway, it's just the same as the blue triangle but provides a bit of
graphical variation.  What do you want from me anyway?  Blood!?  Anyway, it
comes on from level 2 onwards.

NUMBER 3 (12 Points)
========

It's green, it looks like it's come from your nose, it's the slimey green
alien!  This ones goes up and down a bit as well as just right to left!
You'll get this one from level... erm... 4 or something...

NUMBER 4 (14 Points)
========

It's big, it's blue, it's number 4!  It's the big blue ship that doesn't
come on until level... oh, I don't know!  Quite late on anyway.  About
level 10 at least.  Anyway, it goes up and down but a bit quicker than
number 3.

NUMBER 5
========

OK, there isn't a number five.  OK, there isn't one with a hugely
spectacular flight pattern, but hey, what do you want from me?  Severed
limbs?!  Anyway, I don't want to over-complicate the game.  The first
Scrotax had just one type of craft (available in five different colours).
This one has 4, all differently animated (but all roughly the same except
number 3) and just as unoriginal ones.

To enter your name on the high score table, just select the letter with

                                  =======

Selecting many of these options will bring up a new menu or some
information.


BOUNCE SPEED
============

From here, you can select how fast you bounce up/down, although I'm not
sure why you'd want to!

Please note, this menu is slightly different depending which gravity
setting (realish or none) is being used.


<- BONUS EDITOR
===============

From here you can turn on/off various bonusses.  Some may annoy you, so you
might want to get rid of them once you've seen them once.  In fact, some
have been added just to annoy you.

INVINCIBALL, ROLLIBALL and JUMPY BIT are the @{" Bonus Games " Link BonusGames}

HYSTERICAL is a bit pathetic at the moment, but I will cobble together
something similar (but better (I hope)) to Scrotax v1.00 for the next
release.

SCORES are the bonusses triggered by specific scores.

USELESS is the bonus for when you do really badly in the game (although,
this will be improved sometime in the future)


<- HIGH SCORES
==============

From here you can LOAD the currently saved high scores, SAVE them (ie same
as SAVE on the proper Options menu) or CLEAR them.  You can also LOAD FROM
a different file or SAVE TO a different file.


STATISTICS
==========

After each game a set of statistics relating to your performance is
displayed (unless you HIDE them from this menu!)


START LEVEL
===========

Not much reason why you'd want to change the starting level, but if you do,
here's how to do it!


ENTER CODE
==========

Only for people who know codes to enter, really.  And I'm not telling you
any.  Oh, alright then, just a couple - but no good ones!  Try PHWOAR to
look at the graphics and TRANSMISSION to hear all the samples.  I'm not
telling you any others.  Cos they're cheating ones.


GRAVITY
=======

From here you can turn gravity from NO GRAVITY (ie old Scrotax v2.00 and
below setting) to realish.  Note, this option determines the bounce speed
menu.  If you change the bounce speed, it has no effect if you then go and
use a different gravity!  Thanks to Ben Wyatt for the gravity effect!


BOUNCE SOUND
============

If you really want the ball to fart when it hits the ground and squashes,
select FARTY BOUNCE.  If you, like me, prefer it silent, select QUIET
BOUNCE.


SAVE
====

Saves the current setup and the high scores to the default file.


PREVIOUS MENU
=============

Goes to the previous menu.  Ie the main menu.

  v2.00 library!
* Small bug when you quit (hardly noticeable)
* Another miniscule animation bug fixed when changing gravity from normal
  to reverse (and vice versa)
* Oh, I don't believe it!  There was such a STUPID bug which crept in at

  options menu, it crashed!  Damn it!  Corrected now, of course.


                      Version 2.00 (as if you care..)

Scrotax 2 is "Share-Your-Ware" a brand new concept by me.  Basically, if
you like this, you will fall into one of two categories:

1) SOMEONE WHO HAS WRITTEN SOME SHAREWARE

As an appreciative gift, you should email me the registered version of your
program.  I am poor, but I am not asking for any money.  At the same time I
cannot afford to spend money on computer programs, so all donations are
gratefully received!  After all, I've got a mortgage...

Incidentally, please note that, as well as not paying for Shareware, I do not
use Shareware programs after the evaluation period (if applicable) nor do I
get the benefits of the full, nicer program.  So, it's not just me being a
b!!!!!d, I do lose out too!  People try to make out that if you don't pay
for Shareware, the end of the Amiga is nigh, but I think what separates the
Amiga from the PC is that, at the end of the day, money isn't important.
It's a fun machine and not just a commercialist piece of crap that everyone
use and Micros*ft exploit.  Thanks.

(If you feel that the above is cheeky, feel free to fudge yourself into
group 2)

(Erm... the first paragraph, not the second one.  The second one may make
you want to vomit, but I don't think it's cheeky)


2) EVERYONE ELSE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD

If you have written anything interesting that's not on Aminet, please send
me that.  But, whatever the case, please send me a message with COMMENTS
and if you like it, please say so.  I haven't got a very big ego, but I
would quite like one (donations welcome).

Sending me vast quantities of cash, gifts or anything else is not
necessary!  So, enjoy the game and don't feel guilty!  However, if you DO
want to send me some money, gifts, cigarettes and/or alcohol, then please
feel free.

@Node Updates "The Search for the Dice Man"
                             OBTAINING UPDATES
                             =================

Updates will be posted to Aminet (in game/shoot) and to my Web page
(http://www.catalog.com/buttle/semprini/).  There are several updates
planned.  If you wish to be informed of when they are released, just send
me an email (semprini@enterprise.net) and I will add you to the Scrotax
mailing list.

When anything new happens you will be mailed with a brief list of the most
important additions to Scrotax and where you can get the update from.


                        THINGS I'M NOT GOING TO ADD (so don't ask me to)
                        ===========================

* A parallex starfield.  Yeah, this would be good, but tough.  Never been
  good at them and it'd slow it down written in Amos.
* The joke parallex starfield from Scrotax v1.1.  Yeah, this was brilliant
  and hysterical (download Scrotax1.17 if you don't believe me) but I just
  can't be bothered.  Using enough bobs as it is thanks.
* Wigs.  No, the characters cannot wear wigs.  Not even the ball, even if
  he is bald.


                            UPDATES COMING SOON (when/if I can be a!!ed)
                            ===================

* The Hysterical Bonus!
* A Real crapness bonus
* A really crap two player mode like in Scrotax 1.  I don't know whether I
  can be bothered, it wasn't very good.
* Keyboard mode (I intended to have this like in Scrotax 1, but just
  couldn't be bothered)
* Level Editor.  Not a brilliant one, just plain simple storing the few
  basics of each level.
* More Short demos (ie telling you how to play the game)
* When you die, if you get an After-Life bonus, it looks like the bonus
  kills you.  I really must fix this one, I've been avoiding it for ages.

@Node Bugs "Having problems!?"
                                 Problems
                                 ========

Hopefully, you should have no problems with Scrotax 2, but if anyone emails
me with anything I will put it in this node (especially if we find the
problem) in case anyone experiences a similar problem!  If you have fixed
any bugs listed here, just let me know!

Incidentally, as the version numbers go up, bugs get solved (obviously), so
{" click here " Link History} to see if the bug has already been fixed!


1. "When I try to load up Scrotax 2 I get a SOFTWARE ERROR."

Well if you get that with version 2.01 I will be very upset, but please do
let me know!  I didn't compile the game correctly to start with, which is
the reason for this.


<That's it, so far!  Let's hope we don't get any more!>

If you do get a bug or something odd that you think is too odd even for
Scrotax, then please email me immediately!  If you can, also please make a
note of what you were doing exactly when the bug happened!

@Node Power "Power-Ups!"
                                Power-Ups!
                                ==========

Power-ups come in TWO forms - either SPEED-UP power-ups or WEAPON UPGRADES!
Power-ups appear at set times during set levels and will take one of two
forms.  Shooting the power-up toggles it between SPEED-UP and WEAPON!  If
you've got all the power-ups then you get a score bonus instead.

Please note, the ASCII drawings are crap, so if they don't look much like
the graphics, don't worry - just work it out for yourself!

The YELLOW one  \\    : Speed-Up
                 O

The BLUE one   O/\    : Weapon-Upgrade
               o||

LIGHT BLUE      |     : Score Bonus
                .


When you collect a power-up, it appears at the top of your status panel,
depending on what you have got!

The left three squares are for the speed-ups and relate to speed up stages
1, 2 and 3 (each one faster than the previous).

The rest are either weapon upgades or unused!  Each time you pick one up,
you get something new, in the following order:

SILLY BULLETS  O   : Bigger bullets - easier to hit things!
               o

TWO BULLETS  /-\   : Gives you 2 bullets instead of one!
             \-/

SWERVE v1     _|   : (picture of a joystick)
             /_|     Lets you move the bullets UP and DOWN using the
                     joystick to swerve up/down to catch more enemies!

SWERVE v2   `.`_|  : Similar to above, but the swerve is more effective!
              /_|

@Node BonusGames "Games that are bonusses"
                                   BONUS
                                   =====

For various reasons (for you to discover) you may be presented with a bonus
game or a weird level!  These take several forms:

1) JUMPY THING - SCROTAX v1.1's BONUS GAME LIVES!

         |       |
     2   |       |                      1 - You (the ball)
 1   |   |   |   |   |    3             2 - Walls to avoid
 ()  |       |       |   .O.            3 - Huge Bonuses!
 ----|-------|-------|---oOo-----           (unintentially phallic, just
                                            bad ASCII)

Guide your ball at 1 over the first wall, under the second, over the third
and under the fourth in a bid to win buried treasure (well bonusses and
things anyway).  Do all this in a time limit or not at all.  


2) REVERSE GRAVITY

---------------------------------------
   /\
   ||
   \/                /|<
   _                 \|<
  (_)    

                        /|<
                        \|<

---------------------------------------

Not quite necessary having a diagram for this one really, but basically all
that happens is for a level you're bouncing on the ceiling instead of the
floor!  Just to disorientate you really.  Ho ho.


3) BOUNCES OFF

---------------------------------------
   /\                  /|<
   ||                  \|<
   \/
   _
  (_)
   
  /\
  ||      /|<
  \/      \|<
--------------------------------------

Again, the diagram is a little redundant.  Basically, what this means is
that you can move UP and DOWN with the joystick (instead of bouncing).  It
also means the aliens have got a larger area to roam.  It still makes it
quite easy, so this is a bit of a bonus round really!


4) ROLLIBALL
--------------------------------------
   ---- 1     __     -------2   __        1 : 10 Point Bonus
   |10|      /  \    |BONUS|   /  \       2 : Random 0-20 Point Bonous
   ---- _    \__/3   -------   \  /       3 : Nasty Big Rock
       / \                      \/4       4 : Nasty Pointy Thing
       \_/5                               5 : Nasty Small Rock
    _
   (_)6                                   6 : You!
---------------------------------------

This poor diagram illustrates another bonus level.  Barred from shooting,
you can simply roll left and right along the screen dodging and collecting
the bonusses that fall.  You lose if you get hit by the blue things that
drop from the ceiling (the nasty big, small and pointy rocks).  You get
points for collecting the small 10 point bonusses and the red blocks with
BONUS written on them (as above).


5) INVINCIBALL

I can't be buggered to describe this one.  Again, firing is disabled
because for this brief bonus game you must BARGE your way through the
enemies!  You score usual points for each one killed, but a nice bonus if
you get the lot of them!  Remember, when it stops you die if you touch the
enemy!!

6) SCORE BONUSSES

Certain special scores trigger SCORE bonusses!  These are just (seemingly)
random objects flying across the screen.  Pick them up for points!

7) COMING SOON 

The HYSTERICAL BONUS from Scrotax Version 1!
And... THE CRAP BONUS - from Scrotax Version 1!

8) SECRETS!

Well, if you can find the secret game, you'll be disappointed because it's
very crap.

@Node About "Yeah as if my confidence isn't big enough as it is"
                              About Semprini
                              ==============

I am 20 years old and am living in sin on the Isle of Man, a boring little
island somewhere vaguely between England and Ireland.  Although I neither
like Star Trek nor try-hard music, I do own and use computers.

I have been programming in Amos for ooh about 4 or 5 years now probably,
although you wouldn't have guessed it from this, would you?  I am actually
more interested in writing and am hoping to get my first novel published in
the next couple of years (although this requires me to suddenly develop a
talent for writing, so perhaps not).

Right, well, I do not know what to say now, so I will tell you a few crap
things in, like, well, a list...

TAKE THAT, BOYZONE and all the rest of them (they are all the same)
THE ISLE OF MAN
OKELL'S ALES (in particular their disgusting and rather offensive bitter)

You can include ISLE OF MAN GUINNESS in that list if you like, although
DUBLIN GUINNESS is the undoubtedly the best drink in the world.


Well, that's enough of that.  Well, just to be current, the song of the
year so far is, without a doubt, Alright by Supergrass although Find the
Answer Within by the Boo Radleys is rather good as well.  Having said that,
there has been a lot of good music this year, one of the reasons I am so
desperate to return to England, my home country which I left about a year
and a half ago.

I just hope I can afford to pay the airfare and the extravagent entrance
fee for Glastonbury next year.  Well, you can tell that I am both home sick
and incredibly bored (and rather unwilling to continue writing anything to
Scrotax just at this second).

Incidentally, ignore anyone who says smoking and drinking is bad for you.
Firstly, being suicidally bored is bad for you and secondly, if you ever
see a wasp (quite likely I suppose) and you haven't got a fag (English
slang for a ciggy), if you make a move or if you are living with someone
named Clara, you will probably get stung.

Ouch.

Well, if you are smoking, you can save yourself huge amounts of pain.
Wasps don't like smoke or heat.  So they s*d off!  Hurrah!

                                   =====

Actually, this is the first program I have ever released!  You'd never
guess, huh?  Apart from this, I have written about 10,000 versions of Pong
(because it's so easy and I honestly could not think of anything else).
The only other thing I've written that's been decent is SEMPAINT 2 which is
an Amos Professional accessory that allows you to edit Packed Picture
memory banks very quickly and easily.  It's got loads of options including
the ability to use your own programmable routines!

It's not perfect, but it's not useless, and the presentation is (I think)
quite good.  Let me know if you'd like a copy (providing you email me
something too!)

Hoho...

Also available is a NAME EDITOR for use with this very program!  It allows
you to edit those happy, fun filled names that appear on the high score
table if you leave the name blank.  Again, if you'd like this (!!) then
please let me know.
