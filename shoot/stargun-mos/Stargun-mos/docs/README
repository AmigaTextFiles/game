Stargun
(c) Alberto García Serrano <albgarse@users.sourceforge.net>

Stargun is a shooter style game made in C++ and using SDL library. This file 
describes the way to use or copile the game. If you are using the Windows version, 
go to "Windows version". If using Linux, go to "Linux version".


WINDOWS VERSION

You can get Stargun like a binary package or the source code package. If you are 
using the binaries (if you only want to play, this is your way), simply execute stargun
and enjoy. Otherwise, if you are "playing" with the sources, you need a C++ compiler
(i use VC++, but Borland C++ or DevC++ may work).
This package only include the sources of stargun, so if you want compile it, you 
need to have SDL (www.libsdl.org) working on your system and copy the files DSL.lib 
and SDLmain.lib on the directory where the sources are (or in the default location for libs).
If you use VC++ simply open the stargun.dsw file.
After compiling, Stargun looks for the directories 'pics', 'levels' and 'sounds', so copy them 
into the location of the executable.


LINUX VERSION

If you get the binaries, you only have to execute the program. Simply use: 

./stargun 

and enjoy.
Compiling Stargun is very simple (if your system has gcc, and SDL is working).

type:
	./configure
    	make
Now the the game is compiled at directory src/ to run it type:
    	/src/stargun or ./stargun (if you are inside the directory src/)

happy playing!
