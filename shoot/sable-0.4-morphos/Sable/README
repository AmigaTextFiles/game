SABLE
Copyright (C) 2003 Michael C. Martin

The Goal
--------
Survive as long as you can!  Destroy as much as you can!

Running the game (Windows)
--------------------------

Simply execute "sable".  The executable must be in the same directory
as the "textures" subdirectory.  (This is where it usually is, but
make sure your working directories are set properly.)

Compiling and running the game (Linux)
--------------------------------------

make && make install should work.  To edit the installation
directories, edit the Makefile.

If you do not have root access, running ./sable from the Sable root
directory should work as well.

If you have problems compiling, see the "Compiling" section at the end
of this document.

Configuring the game
--------------------

The game defaults to a 640x480 window, with no gamma correction.  To
modify these, you may pass in command line arguments:

sable -r 1024x768 -f -g 1.2

This sets the resolution to 1024x768 (-r 1024x768), fullscreen (-f),
with a gamma correction of 1.2 (-g 1.2).  All arguments are optional.

Controls
--------

In game:

Arrow keys (or numeric keypad): Move
Space, Enter, Shift, Alt, or Control: Fire (hold down for autofire)
R:       Toggle Pylon Radar
P:       Pause

In menus:

Arrow keys (or numeric keypad): Move
Enter: Select

Joysticks will be automatically set up if present.

Compiling
---------

The following libraries are required:

SDL 1.2 (tested on 1.2.6)
http://www.libsdl.org/

SDL_image 1.2 (tested on 1.2.3)
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/

SDL_mixer 1.2 (tested on 1.2.5)
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

OpenGL 1.2
http://www.opengl.org/

Later versions of these libraries should all work as well.

The supplied Makefile should work fine under Linux.  Under BSD, you
may need to change the name of the "sdl-config" utility.
