Version 0.4:

	Made pylons become transparent after the player passes them.
	
	Removed the pointless camera angle controls; improved geometry
	culling as a result
	
	Added a custom random-number generator for targets (such as Win32)
	that lack random() and srandom().
	
	Added "install" and "uninstall" targets for system-wide installs
	on Unix.
	
	New graphics for title and Game-Over screen.

	Fixed pylon scoring.

	Completely internalized VControl.
	
	Fixed an occasional divide-by-zero in Explosion::Explosion, from
	dacut

	Fixed an off-by-one error in cross_accum which crashed some
	video cards, from dacut

	Terminates cleanly if texture data cannot be found

	"make" at the top level is now a phony target, so the executable
	remains properly replaced
