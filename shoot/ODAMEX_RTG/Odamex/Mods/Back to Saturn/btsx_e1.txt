Description             : Get Out Of My Stations is the first episode of
                          Back to Saturn X, a three-episode partial
                          conversion for Doom II.

                          Back to Saturn X is fully compatible with
                          Doom2.exe and Chocolate Doom. It has also been
                          tested with Eternity Engine, PrBoom-Plus,
                          ZDoom, GZDoom, and Risen3D.

                          ZDoom/GZDoom users should make sure to use r3935
                          or newer (Nov 2, 2012 or more recent) in order to
                          avoid rendering glitches.

The Story So Far        : The tether has been severed. A chain to the moon
                          lies crumpled in a strewn array of blank screens
                          and static. The Saturn X Research Station falls
                          silent for the first time in three decades. Alarms
                          ring out as the crisis escalates, and soon, Union
                          Aerospace knows it can no longer ignore the
                          deafening silence left in its wake.

                          Time progresses. Three weeks. I arrive, and the
                          director frowns as the briefing begins. When she
                          speaks, the flag unfurls and the heavens split in
                          half: They will send me to investigate. I'm to be
                          sent on a blatant doom trip, a three-year journey
                          from which there will be no return.

                          My fate is irrelevant. Spit me out from your cosmos,
                          seal me into a portable mortuary, and ship me away.
                          As this reluctant journey begins, my goal is clear:
                          arrive, assess, evacuate. The nightmare I had hoped
                          would never arrive has become my sole purpose. I
                          disembark, waking up the stars as my vision begins
                          to blur...

                          ...

                          Awakening from cryo-sleep, the icy breeze is
                          shattered and a sense of deja vu grips me in this
                          solitary land. Although I am a newcomer to the
                          stage, I can't help but find a sense of familiarity
                          in this "lone space marine on the eerie rock" act.
                          For my final performance, I have come back.

                          Back to Saturn X.

                          us a report so we can look into the problem and fix

May Not Run With...     : Back to Saturn X has not been tested with gameplay
                          mods, and we make no guarantees that it will work
                          as intended with one. The maps have been carefully
                          balanced for exciting gameplay with Doom's standard
                          monster and weapon behavior: if you're playing with
                          mods and run into issues, well... stop doing that.
