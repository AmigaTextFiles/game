.description
A tiny game for 2-5 players who fight against each other.
It is similar to the commercial Dynablaster or Bomberman,
except a 1-player mode is not available.  On the other hand,
there are a great number of extras.  To win the game, one
player has to disintegrate all other players by exploding
bombs.
