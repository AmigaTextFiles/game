DynamiteWarriors is a multiplayer game with up to five player.
If a four-player-adapter is connected, up to four player are able
to play with joysticks. To win the game, a player has to desintegrate
all other players using explosions of bombs planted. DynamiteWarriors
is thought to be a multiplayer game, so it makes not much sense to play
it alone.

You can start the game from the Workbench or the Shell.
On older computers (Kickstart 1.2 and 1.3) the computer sometimes
load the program into (needed) chipmem. Then you should start
FastMemFirst before loading.
If the Requester "Not Enough Memory" occurs, then you should reboot
and break booting immediatly after the Shell appears. Then enough Memory
(Chipmem) should be available and you can start the game from the Shell.
If the music is not ok, then try also the above.
The game was programmed and tested on an A500. Because of that, it runs
too fast on computers like the A1200. So you can give a value of delay
to slow down the game. By starting from the Shell you can add a value
as argument giving this delay. A A1200 should use values about 1-2. If
no value is given, 0 (no delay) is the standard value.
Example : "DynamiteWarriors 1"

After starting the game all possible Characters run into the screen. Then
the main menu appears. This action can be shortend by pressing any key.
This key can also choose immediately a menu item of the main menu.

The game starts by pressing the key "S" in the main menu.

To quit the program the key "Q" has to be used.

The key "I" displays informations about the programm (e.g. if it is
a registrated version or not and the persons that helped making this
game)

To change the keymap for one (keyboard) player, the key "A" is needed.
Then the player characted has to be choosen by pressing one of the
function keys F1-F5. Further the program asks the keys for e.g. moving,
plant bombs, etc. In the case that an other player owns one of the
choosen keys, nothing will happen. If the old keymap is alright, the
<ESC> key jumps to the next action.

The key "C" switches to a sub menu, where some start options can be
changed. The first option can change the number of obstactles in the
labyrinth. These obstacles can't be bombed away and blocks the players
way. The next parameter changes the number of bombs available
and then the range of the explosions of all bombs at the beginning.
The next option switches the monsters off and on. There are two diffrent
types of monsters : a slime-like green mass, that moves all directions
randomly and rolling Bombs that explodes after a short time or after
been hit by a explosion. These slime monsters can kill the players and can
only be removed by the hot flames of explosions.
The next options make the explosions fast or slow again. The fast mode
is for the more experienced players.
You can also choose graphical backgrounds in the game. There are four
different graphics available : Brick, Funghi, Hall and Forest. Random
will randomly select one of these backgrounds.
In this version of the game, you can choose between three pieces of
music playing during the game : Raccons, Crazy and Gowe. But you can
also have no Sounds at all by selecting "None" and digitised effects
by selecting "Sound".
The game ends if all but one player are dead or until the time limit
is reached. The time limit can be put to 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes. By
selecting "End" there will be no time limit.
The last parameter toggles between colored explosions and normal (red)
explosions. In the colored explosions mode, every bomb will explode in
the colors of the character. So it will be clear, who had killed
yourself. So you can take revenge (Sorry, only in your next life!).
If you choose Duds, then bombs could happend not to explode sometimes.
By pressing the <ESC> key the main menu will apear again.

The kind of controlling the player can be changed in the main menu by
selecting the player by pressing the respective function key F1-F5.
If no kind of controlling is displayed, the character won't be drawn up.
If there is a monitor with a face is displayed, the computer plays this
character. This computerplayer is not very intelligent, he only tries
to survive and randomly plant bombs. But they also often blow off
themselves. If you only install computer players, you can watch the
game very calmly and know afterwards what you have to expect.

After the game has started, four characters stand in a edge of the
playfield and one in the middle. The playfield consists of hard, bomb
proofed material and of lose material, that can be bombed away.
If a player has planted a bomb, he should leave the horizontal and vertical
direction, where the explosion extend itself.
Under some ruins of walls sometimes appear monster or different extras :

Symbol of bomb - The player is able to plant one bomb more, while the last
                 ones aren't exploded yet.

Symbol of circles - The range of all bombs increases.

Symbol of joystick - Changes the left-right-controll of all opponents.

Symbol of double arrow right - The own player runs faster a shorttime.

Symbol of double arrow left - All opponents get slower a shorttime.

Symbol of shield - Creates a shield, making the player insensitive against
                   fire and monster a shorttime.

Symbol of crossed bomb - All opponents are not able to plant a bomb
                         a shorttime.

Symbol of skull - Kills the player immediately.

Symbol of question mark - causes one of the upper extras (also dead!)

Symbol of nothing - All opponents are not able to get extras a shorttime

Symbol of colored wheel - Teleporter

Symbol of five red points - Beserker Extra, the player is able to plant
                            five bombs at a time



The game is finished if all players except for one (or none) are dead
or if the time limit is reached.

By pressing the <ESC> key three times at any time (not in pause mode).

Locking the <CAPS LOCK> key will pause the game and releasing it will
continue the game.
