@node 1 "What is Shareware ?"

    Shareware  is  a way of getting good software in a cheap way.
    You get hold of the software for almost nothing, and can test
    it  for  a  while  before  deciding  if  you  want to pay the
    programmer  for  his/her hard work.  And remember that if you
    don't  pay  and nobody else do pay than it's pretty sure that
    the  programmer  will  NOT  make any more shareware software.
    And  that  will  in  the  end  lead  to  no software for your
    machine!!!!  So, please pay the author of the software.

    NOTE!  This program is in fact shareware!

@endnode
@node 2 "If you like this piece of software !"

    If  you  use  this software and you like it, than I (Edgar M.
    Vigdal)  would  be eternal grateful to you, if you send me 15
    US  Dollar,  £5,  20DM,  50  NOK  or  any amount you like, as
    payment  for  the  game.   If  you  would like 1 year of free
    update  (at  least  2  update  (If  I get any bug rapport, or
    suggestions for improvement)), than send me $25, £15, 40DM or
    150 NOK or more if like to.... ;-)

    If  you  also  want the latest version of Deluxe PacMan, than
    add $10, £5 or 50 NOK and an extra disk.

    If  you  become  a registered user and send me a disk, I will
    send  you  a  super  version  with  more  levels,  more sound
    effects,  speech  and  other  improvements.   (maybe  an  AGA
    version?!)

    **********
    * PLEASE *
    **********
    Send me a disk for the reply, as I can not afford the disks!
    Please  add an extra disk for Deluxe PacMan, if you want that
    one  too,  or  if  you  want the next game.  The game has now
    grown too big and I can no longer fit both games on one disk!

    ********
    * NOTE *
    ********
    If  you  only  pay  the  shareware fee ($15,£5) AND you get a
    later  version  from  a PD-dealer/BBS or some where else, you
    should  think  of that version as an update from me!  (If you
    send a disk then you should get a new version from me!  (When
    I have made a new version!!))

    ************
    * INTERNET *
    ************
    If  you have internet access and an email address and you are
    able to receive messages that are some 500 kilobytes big, you
    can get updates through the internet!!  This is the very best
    and  fastest  method  to  get  the  new  updates and extended
    versions  and  extra files!  So get yourself a good email-box
    and you will receive the version in a couple of hours after I
    have your shareware fee!!!!

    postal orders are totally rubbish here in Norway. Eg. British
    Postal Orders. DO NOT USE THIS TO PAY ME!!!!

    Please  do  not use cheques if you can, because I have to pay
    SO MUCH in exchange fee!!!  (30-50%)(It's sick!!) :(((

    Please  make  sure that your full name, address, postal code,

@node 2.4 "To Magazines!"

    If  you  want  to  use this game on your coverdisk or you are
    reviewing  the  game,  then  please  send  me  a  copy of the
    magazine/review.  If you want to pay me, I will not say no to

    really  like  a  copy  of  the  disk!   And  make  use of the
    GALAGA.MUSIC  file!   This file could be filled with names of

@node 3 "About Deluxe Galaga"

    Deluxe  Galaga  is  based  on  the game StarBattle on the old
    VIC20.   That was one excellent game, that I had a lot of fun
    with.   It's  also  some  features  from the games Galaga and
    Galaxions.   I played Galaga on an arcade machine, but it was
    so  long  ago  that  I have forgotten how it looked like.  My
    version of Galaga (or StarBattle) is a simple (?) shoot'em up
    game  with  good  game  play, but not so much fancy graphics.
    Many  of todays game have lots and lots of graphics, but when
    it  comes  to game play they really sucks.  They have manuals
    covering  hundreds  of  pages, and you need hours and days to
    get  into  the  game.   What  I  want  from  a  game  is some
    relaxation  for a couple of minutes, and then be able to quit
    the game and do some more work.  And not to mark the calender
    for when I want to play the 60MB hi-tech game!

@node 4 "Your Mission"

    You  are  in control of a small starfighter, and your mission
    is  to  protect  the  earth  from  alien attackers.  When you
    start,  your  ship  have  limited  supply  of bullets and are
    moving  a  bit  to  slow,  but by shooting the aliens you can
    collect  the  falling  bonuses  and get all sorts of weapons,
    extra speed and a lot of other goodies!

    When  you  are hit, some of the weapon power is lost and also
    speed  and  any  bonus  time you have collected.  This los is
    bigger on the hard level.

    There  are  double  shoot,  triple shoot, super weapon, extra
    life,  smart bombs, money, warps, secret bonus level and much
    more to be collected and added to the starfighter.

    Look  out for mother ships, rockets, warp malfunctions, super
    guardians and Super Cash Ship!

    There is also a lot of secrets in the game, you can find this
    secrets  yourself,  or  you  can buy them in space-shop.  The
    space-shop  will appear every fourth level, but you must have
    more  than 50 credits to enter the shop.  There are more than
    10 secrets hidden in the game and some that are not listed in
    the game!!


    The Sub Games:
    --------------
    Meteor  Storm:  You must navigate you ship through a field of
    big  rocks  floating  in space.  Some of the rocks have bonus
    point  on  surface and can be collected.  There are also some
    money containers floating around.  Collect these and get some
    extra  shopping  money.   You  will  get a super bonus if you
    compleat the meteor storm.


    The  Memory  Station:   Try  and find a pair (Two blocks that
    look the same) in a matrix of blocks.  If you find a pair you
    will  get  the  bonus that are one the blocks.  You only have
    limited  time to find as many pairs as possible.  If you find
    all the pairs you will get a bonus.

    MORE ON THE PAL / NTSC MODES
    ============================

    PAL Video System:
    -----------------
        Game  in  normal  mode:  Select PAL and switch off the Hz
        mode inside the game (TAB).

        Game  in  Arcade feeling mode:  Select NTSC and switch on
        the Hz mode inside the game (TAB).  This is the mode that
        I personally like the best!!


    NTSC Video System:
    ------------------
        Game  in  normal mode:  Select NTSC and switch off the Hz
        mode  inside the game (TAB).  This is actually the arcade
        mode  and  the  game  will  be  a bit faster then for PAL
        players!

        Game  in PAL mode:  Select PAL and switch the Hz mode off
        inside  the  game  (TAB).   The  game  will  now be a bit
        slower.



    The  preferences  that  you  have  selected will be saved for
    later  use.   If  you want to change the preferences you most
    hold  down  the  fire button on the joystick (Port 2)(NO auto
    fire)  or the left mouse button when the game is loading.  Or
    you  can  delete  the  GALAGA.PREFERENCES  file  in the games
    directory.


    NOTE!
    -----
    This  game  will  NOT  work  on  any 24bit graphics card.  If
    Commodore  had made a machine with a fast enough processor to
    use  system  functions  in  games,  it would have worked, but
    they didn't and they never will!  Sorry !!!

    Amiga  is  the  best home computer in the world, it's just to
    bad that Commodore got hold of it !!!! And that Medhi Ali was
    ever born!!

    This  gadget  will  switch  between  PAL and NTSC mode of the
    game.  PAL will use a 270 line high display and NTSC will use
    a 210 line high display.  If you are living in a country that
    uses  the  NTSC video system then select the NTSC mode.  This
    will  adjust the game to use a smaller screen and the players
    ship should appear on the screen.
        If  you  want a bit more arcade feeling added to the game
    AND  you have a fat Agnus installed in your machine, then try
    the  NTSC mode and hit the TAB key when on the menu screen in
    the game.  This will speed up the game even more...  (Not for
    those who must use the NTSC mode!  (USA & JAPAN (I think!?)))

@node 9.1 "MUSIC"

    If  you  get sick and tired of the music you can change it to
    one  of your own favorite protracker modules.  You do this by
    changing the name of the original music or delete it.

                Example:

                rename GALAGA.MUSIC as GALAGA.MUSIC.reserve

    And  then  you  copy  your  module  over to the Deluxe Galaga
    directory and rename it as 'GALAGA.MUSIC'

                Example:

                rename MOD.MYSUPERTUNE as GALAGA.MUSIC


    You  may  also  change the jingles (this are small tunes that
    are played at special occasions), as they are also protracker
    modules.

    NOTE!   The  modules  that you want to use must be compatible
            with  ProTracker  1.1b.   If  you  test your selected
            module  and it's not played back correctly, then it's
            most probably not compatible.

    *NOTE*  Some  noisetracker (and maybe other module types too)
            uses  some  strange commands and my module player may
            crash  if  you use this kind of modules.  If the game
            crashes/guru's  for  no apparent reason it may be one
            of the loaded modules that causes the failure!



    NEW FOR  VERSION 1.3
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    You  may  now have many different music modules, and have one
    random module selected and loaded.

    First  copy  all  of  your favorite ProTracker modules to the
    Deluxe Galaga directory.  Then you must rename them to...

             GALAGA.MUSIC0   (The number at the end of the name -
             GALAGA.MUSIC1    starts on 0 and goes up to as -
             GALAGA.MUSIC2    many modules you have copied.)
             .                (Max is 9!! (0..9))
             .
             .
             GALAGA.MUSICN   (n is the number of modules)


    NEW FOR VERSION 1.7B
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    You  may  now  have a file containing a list of your favorite
    ProTracker modules.  The file must be named 'GALAGA.MODULES'!

    Example file.....

                Music:PT/Modules/mod.HideawayBlues
                Music:PT/Modules/mod.DontYouWantMe
                Music:PT/Modules/mod.FeelTheBase2
                Music:PT/Modules/mod.Guitarslinger
                *Add a dummy line with the EOF mark here>#

    Please look at the GALAGA.MODULES_res that should be included
    in the Deluxe Galaga package/directory.


    NEW FOR VERSION 2.4
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    When  the  game starts it will load as many of modules as the
    memory allows.  It will select any of the modules in the list
    randomly.   (Max  50  modules!)  If  you  have  a  MC68020 or
    better   (faster)  modules  will  also  be  loaded  into  any
    available fast memory.  When switching to a new module inside
    the  game  the  game action may pause for a very small period
    while  the  new  module  is  copied  from fast memory to chip
    memory.  On a fast MC680x0 this will barely be noticeable.


@endnode
@node 9.2 "SFX"

                Example

                rename GALAGA.SFX as GALAGA.SFX_reserve

    The  game  will  now  use  the  'GALAGA.SFX_SMALL'  as  sound
    effects.

    library)  to  load compressed data files or modules.  Use the
    supplied 'pack' program to pack or unpack datafiles.

    Example:

        pack hd1:GALAGA.GFX method MASH

    This  will  pack  the  file  'GALAGA.GFX'  on  HD1:  with the
    compressor  sub-library  'xpkMASH.library'.   The  compressor
    library must be correctly installed for this to work.

    Libs:
        xpkmaster.library
        compressors/
            xpkMASH.library
            xpkRAKE.library

@node 9.9 "ICONIZING THE GAME"

        You  can now iconize the game from almost anywhere in the
        game.   Just  hit the 'HELP' key and the game will return
        to the workbench screen. A small window with some gadgets
        will  be  opened  on the workbench, use this to return to
        the  game.   You can also free up some memory if you need
        some more memory to start some other programs.
        If  you free up only chipmem, you should also try to free
        up  modules  memory, if there is very little chipmem left
        when  you  have  freed  up the chipmem only.  If the game
        fails to allocate the chipmem when you select to continue
        the  game, the game will exit!!!  (A possible new hiscore
        will then be lost!!!)

@node 10 "The next Deluxe game"

    The  next  game in the Deluxe series, will probably be Deluxe
    Donkey  Kong.   I  actually  started on this game after I had
    finished Deluxe PacMan.  But then I got another public-domain
    version  of  Donkey Kong, that looked almost like the version
    that I had on my old C64, and that look almost like the one I
    had  in  mind.   After  I  released  Deluxe  PacMan many have
    written  to me and asked my to make a version of Donkey Kong,
    so  now  I am going do that.  A super duper version of Donkey
    Kong.   If you have any tips for Deluxe Donkey Kong then send
    them  to  me.   (Video  recordings, graphics, maps, sounds or
    ideas) But when I am finished with Donkey Kong I would really
    want  to  make  a  version  of  JumpMan,  one  of my all time
    favorites!

    A version of Radar Rat Race is also coming !!!!



    If  you  have any suggestions for improvements or if you have
    found any bugs then please let my know.

    Good luck and have a lot of fun !!!!  PEACE !!!!

I  have tested the game on a A2000B/68000 with 3MB memory and 1MB
chip memory with and with out harddisk.  And on a A1200 with both
a  68020  and  a  33MHz  68030/MMU  and  6MB RAM.  And I have not
discovered any ugly bugs on my setup.

Thanks  to  everyone  that sent me bug reports, messages and have
helped  me  with  this  game!!!!  Special thanks to the very kind
person  that  converted the doc file into this Amiga Guide file!!

A  Special  thanks  to  Odd  Rune  Olsen  for  play  testing  and
suggestions!

Please  do NOT hack this game and PLEASE do NOT make any trainers
for  the  game!!!!!!!!!!!!   This will kill both the game and any
future projects that I had in mind!!!!!!!
