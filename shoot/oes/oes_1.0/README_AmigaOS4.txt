Your laser takes some time to recharge.

Control the targeting crosshairs with the mouse.
Fire the weapon with Left Mouse Button.
Zoom with the mousewheel, or hold down Right Mouse Button while moving the 
mouse up/down.


IN-GAME VIEW:

VIPs are marked with blue reticles.
Terrorists (the enemy) are marked with red reticles.
Innocent pedestrians are marked with white reticles.
Missed shots (craters) are marked with black reticles.
Blue lines indicate the destinations of VIPs.
