Changes (for the Linux port):
1.29
Phaethon fixed the menus, and added URL linking stuff!
The config stuff is different!

1.28
Command line arguments.  snipe2d -h|--help to see them
Preference saving/restoration
Difficulty level 1-3 supported
Require SDL_image
Show difficulty setting on gameover screen
Save high scores (F12 on logoscreen to display)
Crosshair cursor to use on the nifty buttons (coming soon)
Nifty buttons.  About damn time, right?
Thanks to sibn for the above!
Bugzilla bug #46 (https://bugzilla.icculus.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46) should be fixed, thanks to jwr!
Changed to SDL_image for the logoscreen loading, changed to a PNG.
Further: No more bmps will be included with releases, all images will be
PNG's. Note that bmps will still be in CVS, so as to preserve the source art.
auto* stuff, thanks phaethon!
Music! Thanks to Pajama Crisis (Emmett Plant) and xiph!
Note that we now also require SDL_mixer!
Ungrabbed and paused modes display mouse cursor, to indicate crosshairs are uncontrollable.
Pause and boss mode releases the sound device and reopens on resume -- if sound device is in use by another program when resumed, you may have problems.
When paused, resume by pressing 'p', ESC, or double-clicking the mouse.
Removed getopt requirement, built in petopt instead.  Blame sibn for this one.
We added a Makefile for OS X (Makefile.osx), thanks to Ryan.  He also helped fix the flickering problem on OS X, w00t!
I changed the logoscreen too, need a real artist to clean it up.
Finally got rid of the bizzare newlines from windows.

1.27
Screenshots. Press s.
Pause. Press p.
Boss key, Ctrl+z. This pauses as well
Thanks to jwr for the above! 
Double buffering, can't remember who asked for this, but it's in.
Yet another new logoscreen!

1.26
Verbosity toggle (thanks yem!). Press v, default is none.
Yem also provided us with a patch to make it so you can run the binary from
any directory.

Please refer to this as "Orbital Eunuchs Sniper" from now on :)
