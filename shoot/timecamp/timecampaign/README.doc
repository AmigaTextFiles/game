   Instructions:
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There is a brief three level tutorial in the game, but if you're the kind
of person who's bothering to read this file, then the gameplay should be
fairly familiar.
   You're in a first person viewpoint, and the objectives for each level
are displayed at the beginning. Switches will make objects appear and/or
disappear, including sections of wall. Sometimes you will walk onto a
hotspot which will trigger a message in the square at the bottom of your
display. These hotspots are invisible, but be sure to read the messages when
they appear for they are often of great importance, especially in the
tutorial.
   The Map should be fairly useful, and bear in mind that you can continue
playing the game from the map, although as soon as any damage is inflicted
you will be returned to the game view. On the map, doors appear as X's,
walls are solid blocks, and enemies are pulsating blips.
   Complete each level by entering the exit (should be fairly obvious).
Clearly, on the levels with a time limit, you have to get to an exit before
the time runs out.

   Please enjoy this game and e-mail me with your comments.
