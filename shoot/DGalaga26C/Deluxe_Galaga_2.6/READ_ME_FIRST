        Some  of the modules that I have included in this archive
        was made by Jogeir Liljedahl.  I just have to say that he
        is one of my favorite composers on the Amiga!!  Extremely
        talented  in  my opinion!  Thanks for composing all those
        masterpieces Jogeir!



*       Pack
        ----

        This  is a small utility to compress or decompress files.
        This  tool can be used to pack the data file for the game
        if you want to save some disk space

        Usage:

        Pack <file> method <packing method>

        Example...

        Pack MyFile method MASH

        This  will  pack  the file 'MyFile' and replace it with a
        compressed  version  of  the  same file.  If the file was
        already packed it will skip the file.


        To unpack a file use the following command...

        Pack <file>

        The commando 'Pack #? all' will unpack all the files in the
        directory and all subdirectories.


*       SetPatch

        Use  this  if you make a selfbooting game disk.  Just add
        it in in the startup-sequence like this:

        SetPatch QUIET

        This  command  will  patch  some  function and engage the
        32  bit  data  fetch  in the AGA chips.  If you don't use
        this  and  boot  from a floppy disk the graphics will not
        come up alright! (Only on AGA machines!)




INSTALLING THE LIBS
-------------------

        In  the  'Libs'  directory  I  have  included some useful
        libraries  that  you could install on your gamedisk or in
        Libs:

        The libraries are...

        o       nonvolatile.library
                -------------------
                ** DELETED DUE TO COPYRIGHT OF THE LIBRARY
                   THIS LIBRARY IS PART OF THE OS3.1 PACKAGE.


        o       lowlevel.library
                ----------------
                ** DELETED DUE TO COPYRIGHT OF THE LIBRARY
                   THIS LIBRARY IS PART OF THE OS3.1 PACKAGE.


        o       xpkmaster.library
                -----------------
                This  library  must  be  installed if you want to
                compress  some  of  the  data files or if you are
                using  modules and datafiles that are compressed.
                The  sub  library  for  all the used packer types
                most be installed in the 'compressors' directory.
                The 'compressors' directory most be placed in the
                'Libs:'   directory   on  your  boot  disk.   The
                'xpkmaster.library'  must be copied to the Libs:
                directory too.


        *NOTE*  If you get an error message when you try to start
                the  game,  that  tells you there is a compressed
                datafile,  you  must copy the XPK library and the
                sub  libraries,  to  the  Libs:  directory on you
                boot disk!  (SYS:, harddisk or floppydisk)

                Libs:
                     xpkmaster.library
                     compressors/
                         xpkMASH.library
                         xpkSQSH.library
