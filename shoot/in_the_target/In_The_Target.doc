     After 6 months from the last version, this is the new "IN THE TARGET"!
Quite nothing is changed, just the intro and some other little things, but
it is better and better! Why did I do this new version? First of all to
correct some bugs in the previous one, but also becouse I have noticed that
in the last 6 months my knowledge of Amiga is far bigger! But I didn't write
all the codes from the beginning, quite all it is the old one: I like it becouse
it was my first code for a game. In this months I wrote other 5 games, every
time better than the others, but I wanted this game inaltered, just a bit
improved.

     It's very simple to play "In the Target" and I don't think you need to
read this .doc to play it; it is so easy that also my mother could play it!
You can choose to use the joystick and the mouse, there are three different
levels and a Hi_scores table. During the game you can find other bonuses:
extra shoots or bombs or one to do your target bigger. Your objective is to
destroy as many object as you can.
     Don't worry if you can't make scores as good as those in the table:
I haven't done them but I just wrote!

     Sorry if you find mistakes in this ".doc", but I have studied English
just at school, and I could get wrong!

               GOOD LUCK and ENJOY YOURSELF!!


For AMOS-Users:

     I realized this game entirely in "AMOS The creator". The main loop is
very easy and I spent just 3 night (during the day I have to study becouse
I am 16 and I have to go to the school), but then I spent about 3 months
to make bonuses, different livels and other parts like the beginning.
I haven't drawn bobs, but  I took  them from the  Extras disk because I am
not able to draw very well.
I have compiled it to make faster and independent from the AMOS. If you
interested to have the source codes, write me sending me just a disk (I'll
give you it with other games by me for nothing), but I'll be very happy if you'll send me pictures or bobs that  I could  use  in  future (I'll include
your name).


History:-
        V1.0    First release.
                I sent it to Mandarin Software.

                I added the bonuses, the score system changed
                I put the Hi_scores table
