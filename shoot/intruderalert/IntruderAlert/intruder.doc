Intruder Alert is a fast paced arcade action shoot 'em up game with 
awesome graphics and superb sound effects.
It requires 512K, a joystick and loud speakers!
It runs on the A1000, A500, A2000, & A3000, and has been tested in 
AmigaDOS 1.2, 1.3, and 2.04 -- In fact it was developed on the A3000
with 2.04 and an A1000 with 1.3, so it has been thoroughly tested on those.

In August of 1991, Intruder Alert began as a simple demo of men in
striped shirts bouncing around the screen.  In 4 months, over forty 
Domino's pizzas (pepperoni with extra sauce), 463 Oreos, 269 Chips 
Ahoy cookies, 2 broken joysticks, and countless wee hours of the morning 
later, it became the game you are playing today.

                               THE GAME

Intruder alert is played with a standard joystick plugged into
port 2, on your amiga.  Everything in the game is controlled with
the joystick , with the exception of high score entries.  For these, you
type in your name on the keyboard.

After clicking on the Intruder Alert icon, the intro screens will come up,
and when they are done the title will be flashing on the screen. Press
the joystick button to continue.

The theme song will then begin playing, and the screen will have four big
buttons on it.  Using either the joystick or the mouse select which 
section of the game you want to play as follows:

.-----------------.            .-----------------.
|                 |            |                 |
|   Easy Levels   |            |  Hard Levels    |
|                 |            |                 |

|                 |            |                 |
|                 |            |                 |
`-----------------'            `-----------------'


.-----------------.            .-----------------.
|                 |            |                 |
|      Jay's      |            |    Dave's       |
|     Custom      |            |    Custom       |
|     Levels      |            |    Levels       |
|                 |            |                 |
|   (quite hard)  |            |(also quite hard)|
|                 |            |                 |
`-----------------'            `-----------------'


Highlight screens from these level sets are:

Hard    27:  Ready to Die?    
        40:  Make Tracks. Beat Feet. Move It. RUN!
        48:  Somewhat Sequential
        49:  Last But Not Least    

Jay's    4:  The Flying 'V'
        10:  Banzai Mission
        18:  Looks Like Trouble
        20:  There Can Be Only One

Dave's   1:  Welcome To The Machine
         3:  I Hate Life
        10:  Helter Skelter
        16:  Arc De Flee-omph 

We consider these levels to be the epitome of Intruder Alert desperation.



When you select the easy levels, the titles of the levels will explain
the mechanics of play.  The other sections will have titles that are
a bit more, shall we say, unusual.  It's probably best to start with
the easy levels; you'll get the hang of it rather quickly.
We spent the most time developing the hard levels - so these should be 
more difficult, but also playable for the average joystick junkie.

At the start of each level, your man will flash, and the action will be
stopped.  When you are ready to go, press the FIRE button.  
Shoot anything that moves, and don't touch any walls! (SHWAD)
Watch out for Homer.  He moves, but you can't shoot him!  He is easily
recognized by his trademark cry: "Oh No !"
The object of the game is to complete all of the levels!

At this point we must point out that the Jay & Dave custom levels are
actually quite difficult, and only die-hard Intruder Alert fans will
complete them all.  (rest assured that either Jay or Dave has actually 
completed each and every level, so they are ALL possible, if not probable).
But since these levels can be quite frustrating, we have provided the 
following mechanisms, to make them more enjoyable 8->



                             CHEATING:!!!!!!!!!

Yes, it's Intruder Alert - the game that lets you cheat !!
At any time during the game, you can press the following keys to help 
you out.  Of course, if you use any of these cheats, you will not be 
allowed to enter a high score.

        'S' - Skip this level
        'A' - Skip a lot of levels!
        'L' - Give me some more men!

An excellent strategy for tackling the more vicious level sets is to juice 
your lives up ridiculously high and skip to the tough screens. Rehearse these
until you've gotten them completely "wired" and then start from level one to 
get on the high score board.

                        The Authors
         (Who are these Eyeballs guys, anyway?)

   Jay Stelly is the primary programmer for Eyeballs.  He has a BS in
Electrical Engineering (Computer Option) from the University of Southwestern
Lousiana.  He earns a living writing insurance rating software for PCs. 8-(
He is also responsible for the music and sound effects design in Intruder
Alert.  Jay is responsible for everything tight and efficient about Alert.

   Dave Speyrer is the Artist for Eyeballs.  He will be receiving a BS in
Electrical Engineering (Computer Option) in May 1992.  He drew all of the 
graphics (Except for the zombies which Jay drew, and Dave doesn't want 
credit for!) in Intruder Alert.  He is also responsible for for some 
algorithm design and coding, but mostly everything pretty and nitpicky.  

Dave and Jay have been writing games together since 1985.  Although this
is their first game for the Amiga they have written other games (that
you probably never heard of) 8-) for other platforms including:

As Digital Worlds Software:
Knok*Out Boxing  - Radio Shack Color Computer
The Lair of Erebus - Radio Shack Color Computer
Taos: The Summoning - Apple II
The Astral Gate - Apple II & Radio Shack Color Computer

                            HARDWARE & SOFTWARE

Intruder Alert was written with the following software & hardware:

It was written almost entirely in SAS/C v5.1, with a few routines
in assembly for speed. (again with SAS)

The art was done using Deluxe Paint IV - Electronic Arts
The iff.library - by CHW (sorry I only have initials) was used to
load pictures.
MED & medplayer.library - by Teijo Kinnunen was used to edit the music.
The req.library  - by Colin Fox (of Pyramyd Designs) and 
Bruce Dawson (of CygnusSoft Software). was used in the level editor.
Sound Effects were designed with the Ensoniq EPS, Korg DW8000, and 
Ensoniq SQ^R (Synthesizers), and downloaded to the Amiga and edited with:
Synthia Professional - The Other Guys Software.
