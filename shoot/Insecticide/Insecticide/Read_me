To load Insecticide, double click on the icon.  The game is entirely mouse
controlled.  Press the left mouse key to continue after the title page.

All the instructions for Insecticide are in the game so I won`t bother going
over them here - just click on the `Instruction` icon on the options page.

The game caters for fatter and faster Amigas but I find the best setup for
a normal 1meg machine is:

Graphic Level: Low
Blood Colour: Red
Surface: Pebbles
Game length: 99

Insecticide is Public Domain so it can be freely copied and passed around
AS LONG AS NO PROFIT IS MADE (unless it comes to me of course)

If you want all of the stuff that made up Insecticide ie. the uncompiled
AMOS code, the graphics, soundFX etc. then send five pounds and an SAE to
the following address:


James Hall
1 Chequers Close
Buntingford
Herts
SG9 9TB


I would also appreciate it if you would write to me about anything
concerning this or any other of my stunning(!) masterpieces(!!) eg.
improvements etc.

PS.

The other thing on this disk is `Zeller` - it explains itself when you load
it up.
