         Update: copy the destracker library to you libs directory before playing
         You are earths last hope in defending it from the invasion of the
         Triads ( a ruthless race of evil aliens ).

         This program only runs from shell ( it was tested on an A1200 50/50)
         this program works better on faster systems. It won't play that great on an
         stock amiga 500.

                       Hows it work ?

  The game play is pretty simple use the joystick to move and the fire button to
  shoot. Your shots start of in the direction you are moving then stick to thier
  set path until they hit a wall or an evil alien. Levels are cleared when all
  of the aliens have been destroyed,but be warned two aliens are indestructible
  the aliens flagship nicknamed the Big Box and its scout AKA little box . The
  alien flag ship is not that stable in earths atmosphere so it keeps exploding
  after a set time . Earth has gotten information about this design flaw in the
  aliens flagship and has equip the BetaIV with a Thermofissonometer
  (ther-mo-Fis-shun-o-mee-ter) that appears at the top of the screen when this
   meter fills up the alien flagship explodes. Also the alien scout ship fires a
  laser in either a horizontal or vertical direction ,Dont run into it. Thats it!
