As always, all of my full games are hard drive installable.

   HELIOFORGE is Storonskij-Ware, meaning that it is illegal
to pirate the full game.  Distribution of this DEMO is limited
to the following messy statements:

   This DEMO version must contain all Files, Icons, Graphics,
Sounds, Documents, etc, that I have decided to put with
the DEMO version of the game, in a completely unaltered
condition.  Also, All Files, Icons, Graphics, Sounds, Documents,
etc, must contain this DEMO version of the game in a completely
unaltered condition.  I, Pete W Storonskij, retain all rights to
HelioForge 3D, including all personal, Local, Domestic, Provincial,
National, International, Global, World, Galactic, Intergalactic,
OmniDimensional, and Time-Space Continuum rights.

   Anyone who ever printed ads in Amiga magazines must meet
the following additional criteria before they distribute the DEMO
ONLY:  REMEMBER, ONLY THE DEMO CAN BE GOTTEN FROM OTHERS...

   They must print a NEW ad, not one of the old ones from
years ago, in a current Amiga magazine!  A new ad must contain
the name "HelioForge3D DEMO" to distribute the HelioForge DEMO.

   This is merely to deter dishonest distributors, and the good
and benevolent ones need not fear anything, blah blah blah...

   Let's see, What else can I declare?  How about this, The
Full version can ONLY be distributed by ME, PETE W STORONSKIJ.

  How about this: any alteration of this DEMO version makes
it undistributable, whether graphics, sounds, game, Icons,
documents, or supporting software or hardware. If anything is
altered in any way whatsoever, or are replaced in any way, then
the DEMO distribution is illegal. (this means that you can't get
the front of your Amiga dirty, or the demo is voided, or
something like that :)

   Also, If you experience a solar eclipse (caused by the Moon
and the Sun being in alignment with the Earth), then hopefully it
will be 2017, in mid August, in Lincoln, Nebraska :)  I hope to
see you here... All Evil Pirates are doomed to look directly at
the Sun and go blind from the rain of porcupines that could
mysteriously fall out of the sky, oops...

   HelioForge is Actually 4D2! Which is better than 3D!

                THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

            ***** GAME RELATED STUFF *****

   This is a MOUSE powered game, giving you exact,
fluid control of your spacecraft.

   My newest game is HELIOFORGE, a state-of-the-art 3D
space blaster. The 3D effect is real, and every object has
it's own set of XYZ coordinates.  Now you can truely weave
your way through asteroid fields and Star Mines, using the
Mouse for exact, fluid control of your craft.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

   The game is set in a large star cluster, which has been
invaded by a massive enemy fleet.  You get to pick which
star systems to save first, directly from the 3D spinning
star chart.  If you get too badly beat up by enemy attack
waves, you can choose to enter a friendly system to get
repairs, extra nukes, and a much needed break from the
frantic action.

   THIS DEMO VERSION IS COMPUTER-PLAYER-ONLY

   Everything has been predrawn, which makes HelioForge
superfast.  All rescaled images have been retouched, to make
sure that there are no artifacts and no large pixels.  There
are extra background graphics that enhance the experience
for accellerated Amigas.

   THIS IS THE DEMO VERSION

  There are HUGE, screen filling planets like Saturn, Earth, and
Venus.  These gigantic planets are perfectly drawn, and their
size accentuates their perfectly round edges.  There are twice
as many frames per object, which greatly enhances the smooth
3D effect that is the standard of a Shipyard Creation.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

   The game is loaded with special touches.  If you are hit
with saucer fire, a StarMine, or a meteor, the screen will
shake and it will flash as it has never flashed before.  When
the screen flashes, it washes out all of the other colors, and
when the screen cools down, everything is put back perfectly.
When you fire back, particles from the explosions float about. 
There are also particles that fly past your ship that show
your velocity.  When there is a supernova, you actually
see it and feel it's effects.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

   You get to oblitterate fleets of saucers, asteroid fields,
StarMines, and Ambiance Inhibitors.  If you aren't successful
in your mission to destroy the Ambiance Inhibitor Matrix,
the sun goes supernova, tossing destructive meteor storms
in your face.  Thus ending your perfect record for saving
the day at the last moment.  Since the star cluster has
a great many stars, you can afford to lose a few to the
enemy fleet.  You will win if you can completely destroy the
enemy presence in the star cluster.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

   The game is very hard, but you choose when to go into
the spaceport for repairs.  This makes sure any player
can last a long time, as long as they can survive a single
attack group.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

The whirr of the Amiga's hard drive becomes the hum of
a finely tuned space craft.

*** Democracy in Video Games ***

   In HelioForge, the non-linear gameplay means that you can
do what you want and when you want.  You can choose to go
to any solar system in the huge 50-star cluster, and you can
choose to do many different things.  You can scan a system,
dock at a friendly starbase for repairs, fly through asteroid
fields, destroy mine fields, engage enemy fleets, and attack
dreaded Ambiance Inhibitor Matrix Installations.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

   If you choose to do too much sight seeing, then you risk
letting the enemy armada trample the star cluster with no
opposition.  Alternatively, if you choose to go non-stop
destroying alien armadas without stopping to repair your
ship, then you run the risk of being destroyed yourself.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

   You also have the choice of EXACTLY where to fly your
ship within each solar system.  You can go head-long into
the center of the action, or avoid the enemies entirely if
your ship is in danger of being destroyed.  The 3D Real Maps
allows you to go where you want, both in each solar system,
and in the star cluster in general.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

   You should save the galaxy if you just keep from getting
destroyed.

*** GAME TACTICS ***

   Because you are in a real 3D space, your tactics become
real.  

For instance, You can ... instead of ... and risking your ship.

You're arsenal is augmented with super bombs that vaporize
just about everything on your view screen.

   THIS IS A DEMO VERSION

   Finally, Register the game with Pete W Storonskij, with
only $3 US, as then you can play, instead of watching the
computer player having all of the fun :)

There are lots of tips that I erased from these DEMO DOCS.

*** CONTROL COMMANDS ***

   MOUSE CONTROLS:

NONE OF THIS WORKS IN THIS DEMO VERSION

Moving the mouse moves the cursor.  the cursor directs the
vehicle's exact direction of motion, as well as the aiming
of lasers.

Left Mouse Button: Fire Laser Cascade.
Right Button: OVERDRIVE Thrusters.

   KEYBOARD CONTROLS:

NONE OF THIS WORKS IN THIS DEMO VERSION

F1-F10:  Adjusts the amount of background graphics on screen
(just in case you have an unaccelerated A500 that is slower
than standard).
SPACE:   FIRE NUKE
DEL:    Toggles Crosshairs
ESC:    Abort Current Play/Quit Program. (THIS WORKS :)
HELP:   SWITCHES TO AUTOPILOT (ALWAYS ON IN THIS DEMO)
CHEAT CODE:   It's a SECRET :)  Only available in full game.
The full game docs reveal the cheat code :)

   HUMAN CONTROLS:

NONE OF THIS WORKS IN THIS DEMO VERSION

   Humans can only play in the full game, which is only
available directly from Pete W Storonskij.  In the Full
game, just use the above commands to fly your ship
around the universe, destroying aliens, etc...  Of course,
this is the demo, so humans can't play.

   COMPUTER PLAYERS:

THIS WORKS JUST FINE IN THIS DEMO VERSION

   The computer player plays an effective game, and also
plays in the full game when you don't care to play.

THIS FEATURE IS NOT IN THE DEMO VERSION

  Also, you can enter a game that the computer player has
started,  like in that old C64 game: Beach Head!!!

            *** SHIPYARD HEADQUARTERS ***

   At the Shipyard, I create video games.  It's really fun
to do.  I try to keep my games as diverse as possible, and
to create works in as many genres as possible.  It is this
dedication to varied genres that so few have even tried to
do, that is the essence of the Shipyard.  This enables you to
find more of what you want in one place.

   My creations are of the highest quality, and with the
extremely low cost that I have pioneered, well worth anyone's
resources.

   At $3 US for the full version of this game, how can you
pass up this tremendous deal.  It is the bargain of the
EON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The greatest deal since time itself began!
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah... :)

 Play this game, and you will see the tremendous graphics!
