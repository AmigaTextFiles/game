WELCOME
-------

Welcome to Seasons Classic's first C64 conversion, High Noon.
Original game by Ocean Software in 1983. Original authors unknown.

All code and music/sfx by Lloyd Rosen!


Features TWO PLAYER SIMULTANEOUS mode and highscore saving!


Requirements: This game should work on any Amiga. If it runs too fast
in NTSC mode, let me know and I'll release a fixed version! (are
there anyone Over There left?)

Tested on A1200 2mB, 425hd and A600 1mB, floppy and C64 with 1541II
and AR6.



WARNING
-------

In respect to today's violence attention we have to express that
kids under 25 - we repeat: 25! should not play this game. It's
extreeemely violent!
(Well, if you DO play it - don't go running in the streets with
your father's .38 playing cowboys and outlaws!)


;)


INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Start the game from Shell or WorkBench icon.


TITLE

On the title screen, select level by moving joystick left and right.
Select 1 player game by pushing button in port 2 or press
F1, 2 player game by pressing F2. Press "H" or wait a little while to
see the highscore table. Press ESC to exit to shellbench.

Note: The Hall of Fame is only saved upon quitting the game the
recommended way. And that is to press ESCape!



GAME INSTRUCTIONS


High Noon - featuring Rigor Mortis the Tireless Undertaker!


The game objective is to kill all the outlaws. They have a secret
hideout outside the town, and is robbing the bank
and kidnapping ladies (or whatever they're called these days:)
from the saloon. As you will notice, they're somewhat trigger happy.

Shoot outlaws early to gain maximum score - look out for dynamite
maniacs and snipers!

BONUS DRAWS

On bonus draws, shoot when the bad guy draws. If you're fast enough,
you'll collect the bonus.

Extra life every 10,000 points.





DIFFERENCES
-----------


There are very few visible, audible and playable
differences from the original version.

* One is that the players move a bit quicker (it used to be too
slow. For me, at least).

* I also had to make Rig. Mortis a little
bit less tall (miscalculated the height of the sprites, and I
was too sick of it to fix it!)

* The outlaws, hookers and horses do no longer come in so many
different colors. That would take an awful lot of sprites (there ARE an
awful lot even now! - yeah, you guessed right - I use BOBs instead
of sprites ----> btw: could someone give me some info about the "new"
32/64pix sprites? All they do is flicker!!) phew.. a long sentence, that one.

* The angle of the shots is more close to 45 degrees than the original.
(I don't know if that was the purpose - I think it's better.)

* The yellow color has been faded down a little (it used to be hard
to see the white things)

* The music is not accurately converted - but the themes are the same.
Anyhow, I also removed the in-game music that was more of a nuisance
than nice.

* A bit embarrasing to admit: I simply forgot about the swinging saloon
doors... And now I don't have the inspiration add them.


On the other hand, there's the two-player simultaneous mode and
highscore table (with saving - as all games should have :).

And there's also the comfort of playing it on your Amiga, rather
than dig up the old C64 (even though you SHOULD from time to time!)


DEVELOPMENT
-----------

* C64 Game was trained using the cute Action Replay 6 (POKE 16733,173)

* Graphics was ripped using the excellent GrabIFF from
the fabulous Frodo and veinblasting A64 (demo version I must add)

* Graphics were processed in the vast DeluxePaint IV

* Code was done using the X-rated Trash'm One

* Sound effects was ripped from the one and only C64 with
a true 49152-bit anonymous sampler and swell Audiomaster IV

* Music was converted using the best of the best: Seasons-Floydmon v1.70

* Original music was recorded using a fluffy Marantz PMD 740 4 track recorder.

The source code is 121kB big (6816 lines), with graphics in 159kB
and music/samples in 51kB.


Now, wasn't that very interesting....





SEASONS WANTS MEMBERS
---------------------

Seasons wants skilled members to produce C64 conversions, "real"
Amiga games and utilities. If you are a good coder and/or graphician,
don't hesitate to contact us. Just remember to send some examples
of your work. We have some nice projects to be done!

The Amiga and C64 are still alive!! Don't you ever think otherwise!

Oh, and we don't care if you're not very active but do some goodies
now and then.


Some of the areas we want to cover:

		- Assembly (680x0 - knowledge in 6502 is appreciated
		  but not necessary) coders
		- C(++) programmers / BlitzII programmers
		- Graphicians (DPaint  --- no raytracing!)
		- Designers (layouts, ideas)
		- Story writers (we are working on a Maniac Mansion
		  inspired game routine! write for more info!)
		- Game testers
		- People with knowledge of electronics

Get in touch..


MAKE A WISH
-----------


Make a wish for your favourite game. On the list at this time is:


- BRUCE LEE (DataSoft, Inc. 1984)

	(the all-time classic beat'em up (the atmosphere is brilliant!))

- H.E.R.O. (Activision 1984)

	(fast, adrenalizing and super-addictive jet-pac game!)

- THE GOONIES (DataSoft, Inc. 1985)

	(excellent 2-player puzzle solving game with superb atmosphere)


Other interesting games are CHOPLIFTER (Broderbund 1982), MR. ROBOT

If you have special requests, send us the note, and also the C64
game on a D64 file, if possible!


HOWEVER, BRUCE LEE IS THE NEXT CONVERSION! PERIOD!



Get it before everybody else does!.... look below.



OTHER RELEASES
--------------

Get SEASONS' other releases:

* STOCKMARKET IV (an ultra-addictive game of up's and down's in the
stockmarket - based on the ancient C64 game, but vastly! improved!
1-4 players, statistics, lots of news and soforth!)

* D6502 (a disassembler for 6502 files - very good.)




PLEASE remember to add TWO disks (one for the work, containing
some cool stuff ... NO DEMOS!) and a self-addressed envelope
(international reply coupons).
