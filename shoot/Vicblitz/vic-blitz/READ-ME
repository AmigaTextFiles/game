Hi thanx for getting my game and I hope you like it

To all the people out there who had a VIC-20 and played games on it,you might 
find this game play quit similar to a game you might have had on your VIC-20.
The game on the VIC-20 was called "BLITZ".This is were I first played the game
my father and I played it to death,but as much as we played it,it never got 
easy to finish.This is were this game found its roots,form that game.
There are a few changes I have put in to make it more fun which are:

1 : A lot more sound (but not to much)
2 : Coloured & Animated sprites
3 : A selection of things you can fly
4 : A selection of buildings (chosen at random by the computer)
5 : Bombs that fail
6 : A bonus game

In the VIC game the game play was,you were this plane and as you fly you had
to bomb the buildings out the way,getting lower and lower with each pass.
Well as you can guess that is what the game play is in my game.Once you had 
bombed the city to the ground you would land and get out your plane and give 
a jump for victoy and yes that is the same for my game(but only for one of the
sprites but that is for you to find out which one).The only problem with this 
is as you get lower you speed up and you can only drop a new bomb once the 
other one has hit its target or the ground.You will also see that you get 
bombs that fail now and then,this happens at random,so do not bomb buildings 
only when you are right on top of them,because that could cause your death.

There is also a bouns game in the game but you can find out about that when 
you get to play it.It comes up at random now and then.

The only keys you need to know are

1 : SPACE or MOUSE BUTTONS or FIRE  - -  :- To drop bombs

2 : C - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  :- To Clear the top score

3 : Q - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  :- To Quit (must be done to save 
                                                     the beast score)
 
This game was writen in Amos Pro. and then Compiled.It was writen 
on a standerd A1200 and works fine on my Amiga and should on yours.

DISK PLAYERS :- To Play from disk just copy all the files to disk and name 
                your disk Vic-Blitz and then run VB.

HARDRIVE PLAYERS :- To Play form a hardrive copy all the files to a dir named
                    Vic-Blitz.You will see a icon named Vic-Blitz and a text 
                    file to go with it,now go edit the file and change the 
                    line 
                          Assign Vic-Blitz HD1:Games/PD-New/Vic-Blitz 
                    
                    this assigns were the game is,change it to were you are 
                    going to put the game and then save the file.
                    Now clic on the icon and the game should load and run

me know what you think of my game that is all I ask.I am not asking you for

You are also welcome to copy and spred my game around as much as you like
but you must in 
                       NO WAY ADD TO IT OR CHANGE IT 

Like say change my sprites or the IFF screens that get loaded into the game.


If you like my game why not try writing a game your self it is not as hard
as you might think and can be fun to.

I can not be held responsible for all the fun and gray hairs my game might 
cause or for strange events or actions on your computer that might be caused 
or result for the use of my game on your computer.

Bomb well and have fun Chow.....
