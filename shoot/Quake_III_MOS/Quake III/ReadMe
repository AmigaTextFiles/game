This is Quake III: Arena for MorphOS.

REQUIREMENTS:
 - At least 256MB of memory
 - TinyGL version 50.9
 - Supported 3D hardware
 - 500MB free hard disk space
 - An internet connection to download the Q3A 1.32 update

INSTALLATION:
Drag the "Quake III" drawer to the location you want to install the game to.
Doubleclick the installquake3 icon.

The installupdate icon is only needed if the installer fails to download the
updates and you wish to update your Quake 3 data files at a later time.

USAGE:
To start Quake 3, simply doubleclick the icon.

This distribution also includes the dedicated server for Quake 3. It has no
icon, but should be started and controlled from a shell.

The dedicated server will not accept any client connections till you load a
map, and thus will appear not to function if you don't load one. Loading a map
is done by typing the map command followed by a mapname into the server
console. Example: map q3dm1
