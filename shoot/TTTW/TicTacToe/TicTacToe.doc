---THE STORY:


   The planet Eotcatcit has been invaded by the Extermination Alliance,
an evil orginization determined to conquer the universe.  The Alliance has
wiped out the entire TicTacToe Defense Force except for the two greatest
warriors, Mr. X and Mr. O.  Mr. X and Mr. O must wipe out the invasion force
of Slimeys, Flameys, Iceys, and Fisheys; and must then use the Model XWB-95J
Space Warp Booster/Wormhole Stabilizer® from IPM Enterprises to go to the 
four home planets of the invasion force in order to annihilate their armies 
so they won't be able to retake the planet.

---NOTES:

   When you first play the game, you may notice that your craft can only go 
halfway across the screen.  This is NOT a bug!!!  This is the way I designed
the game!  Each player is limited to their own half of the screen because of
TTTDF Rules of Engagement regarding placing extra drain on the XWB-95J.
