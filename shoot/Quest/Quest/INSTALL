Installation of Quest/Linux/Irix/Amiga
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note1: The binary package of Quest/Linux/Alpha does _not_ contain any version
       that runs on SVGALib. If you want to test this out get and try the
       source code version.

Note2: The Amiga port is a beta version and only available as source code.
       Ask Sven Thoennissen (svent@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de) or take
       a look at Aminet for precompiled versions.



1. Edit Makefile.cfg to set the global quest library path.


2. If you've downloaded the source code version first type

	make depend

   and then

	make install

   This will automatically compile Quest/Linux and install all necessary
   files in the global quest library path and the executable in
   /usr/local/bin.

   If you downloaded the binary version just type

	make install

   This will install all necessary quest library files in the quest library
   path and the executable in /usr/local/bin.

   Note: if you have the binary version and changed the library path from its
   default value you will need to set the environment variable QUESTLIBDIR to
   the new value.


3. (optional) Type

	make install-idtools
