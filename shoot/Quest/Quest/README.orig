Quest Source Readme:

You should have a bunch of .c files, a bunch of .h files, a few
subdirectories (graphics, mdls, groups) a .pas file, and the following
info files:

LEGAL.TXT -    important legal notes. Definitely read this before you read
               anything else

QSRCINFO.TXT - a description of the flow of the program as well as a few
               other important notes. Definitely read this before you do
               anything with the source.
