@Node "intro" "Introduction to Quest"

@{u}Introduction@{uu}


Quest is a level editor for Quake I. You can view the level from the x/y/z
axis, three-dimensional in the wired model view.

There are also some tools with Quest - qbsp, light and vis. They are found
in the bin-directories. You need them to compile your map into a *.bsp-file.

Quest was originally created for MSDOS. It was then ported to Linux and Irix
(Intel and Alpha CPUs), and finally to the Amiga!


@Endnode
@Node "requirements" "What you need"

@{u}Requirements@{uu}


Hardware:

  - 68020/68881 CPU or higher
  - about 6-8 MB of free RAM for Quest
  - at least 28MB (!) of free RAM in order to compile a level
    (suggested 64MB)

So, a 68060 Amiga with 48+ MB RAM is recommended. 32MB might be not enough..
But hey, go to a computer shop and buy 32MB fast page, it's not really
expensive :-)


Software:

  - OS3.0 or higher
  - CyberGraphX V40 (Quest is compatible with P96) or AGA
  - ixemul.library V47.3 or higher
  - rexxmast running (for compiling the levels)


@Endnode
@Node "install" "Installation"

There's no installer script yet. Please use the manual method instead.


@{u}Manual installation@{uu}


Follow these steps to get Quest running properly:

1. Extract the archive where you want it to be. It will create a folder "Quest".

2. Rename your desired version of AQuest-680x0 to "AQuest" in order to run
   Quest from workbench.

   Quest needs two assigns (create them in your user-startup, preferably):
     QUEST:     where the main executable is, e.g. "Work:Games/Quest"
     QUAKEDIR:  your Quake directory, containing the id1-folder,
                e.g. "Games:Quake". (I didn't choose QUAKE: because this
                is the name of clickBOOM's Quake-CD)

   Note that if you start Quest without these assigns, it will NOT show the
   "Please insert volume QUEST in any drive" requester!

   If you start Quest with the supplied icon from workbench, these assigns
   are tested first, so you don't have to set them manually.

3. The "bin" directories contain level building tools compiled for various
   processors of the 680x0-family. Rename your favourite one to "bin".
   Here's a short overview of memory requirements:

     bin (68020/68881,68030,68040)
      |___ qbsp   23.3M
      |___ light  12.4M
      |___ vis    12.0M


   @{i}Tech info:@{ui} These are the added sizes of all the chunks of the executables.
   All programs will additionally allocate further memory!


That's it with the installation. Read about @{" starting Quest " link "usage"} and about
@{" configuring Quest " link "config"}.


@Endnode
@Node "config" "Configuration of Quest"

@{u}Configuration-file@{uu}


Quest will save a configuration file ".questrc" to the Quest: path. This
file is self explaining but let's say something to it, anyway.


vid_mode

  You can open Quest on a 8bit-screen only. Choose among the resolutions 1-4,
  whatever you like best. There is no sense in opening a 16/24bit screen
  because Quest is designed to use 256 colours.



@{u}ENV-Variables@{uu}


QUESTOPTIONS

  The template of this string is : SCREENMODE/K
  Here you can give an alternate screenmode-ID if you don't like the mode-ID
  suggested by Quest.


@Endnode
@Node "usage" "Usage"

@{u}Starting Quest@{uu}

Start Quest by clicking on its icon, executing a script. The script will
assign Quest: to the current directory and it will check for the Quakedir:
assign. If all goes well, a screen should open, with a triple split editing
part and a menu on the right. The status bar at the bottom should say
"Quest amiga-0.6 initialized.".

Quest has neither pulldown menus nor intuition gadgets. It uses its own GUI
elements and requesters. (The Amiga port uses Amiga-requesters)


@{u}Explaining the screen@{uu}

At the top left you can see the default texture (e.g. "rock4_1"). Change it
via the "Settings/Def texture" menu. (You must have a WAD file installed
for this)

The top left gadget is showing the current view mode. Hit TAB to change.

The big middle part of the screen is showing two small views and one large
view. The two small ones help you viewing the level from different axis.

At the bottom of the sreen we have a scrollable message view. Use the up
and down arrows to scroll, and the little dragging line as well.

The gadgets on the bottom right are as follows:
  arrows    - rotate the camera
  T         - Texture picker
  M         - ?
  S         - ?
  box       - ?
  2 squares - ?


@{u}Load or create a map@{uu}

You might load an existing map to get used to Quest (see @{" here " link "relatedfiles"} on
how to get maps). Load it with the menu "File/Load".
If you don't have a map or want to create your own, you might start selecting
"Create/Brush/Room" from the menu.


@{u}Assigning a WAD file to your map@{uu}

Choose "Settings/Default wadfile" from the menu and select a suitable WAD
file from the "wads" directory.


@{u}Mouse buttons@{uu}

Use the left mousebutton to select the editing window, use the middle
mousebutton to zoom into the level, and use the right mousebutton to move
it around. For those who are already using their MMB or have a a two-button
mouse - use keys a and y to zoom in and out.

With the Shift- and Control-keys, you can multi-select the vertices.


@{u}Build the level@{uu}

You will want to see your level progress in Quake, won't you? :-)
Hit Alt-b and a selection window should pop up. You can choose between six
building methods:

 1. Fast build (no error checking)
      This will call the compiler tools without error checking. They will
      compute the level at a low precision, reducing compilation time.
      Once your bsp-file has been generated successfully, Quake is started
      from your Quakedir: assign.

 2. Fast build (error checking)
      Same as 1, but with error checking. If a tool exits with an error,
      the script is aborted safely. This is the most needed choice.

 3. Entities only
      If you have changed entities only you want to choose this option.
      It is a lot faster than recompiling the entire level.

 4. Lighting only
      Recommended if you only changed lightsources.

 5. Full Build
      This is the one you should choose when you have finished your level.
      The level compiler tools will compute at highest precision, thus
      taking much time.

 6. Build visible
      Actually, this is the same as 1, so you can ignore this one.

After you have chosen one of these options, a window will open on the
workbench screen so you can follow the compilation progress.
Once the build has completed, Quake is being started. Make sure you have
enough free ram, or Quake simply won't start. The executable should be
"Quake.exe" or "Quake", residing in the QUAKEDIR: assign.
Take a look at the "lib/go*" scripts if you want to know about how it is
started.


@{u}Texture Picker@{uu}

Click on the "T" gadget at the right bottom corner of the screen. After a
short while, you can choose between textures. Choose "Full screen" for a
big selection!


@Endnode
@Node "tools" "Tools"

@{u}Tools@{uu}


Quest comes with a few tools which are recommended if you want to see your
level in Quake. They are located in "bin" or "bin-68040". The "bin" tools
are compiled for the 68020/68881 CPU/FPU and have proven slightly faster
than the 68040 versions, on my 040. You might want to rename the directories
appropriately.

There are some more directories "bin-big" and "bin-68040-big". They contain
68020/68881 and 68040 versions of the tools, requiring original memory sizes
like the Linux version has.
The "bin" and "bin-68040" directories contain cut-down versions, eating a lot
less memory than their big brothers. If some tool reaches maximum limit on
any value (it will tell you so read its output) while computing on a level,
you should use its big brother.


So let's explain a bit about the tools:

@{i}qbsp@{ui}

  This one is a real monster! It eats up a lot of memory. Watch your
  workbench title showing free ram becoming less....
  qbsp creates several files, and finally the bsp-file which is loaded by
  Quake later.

@{i}light@{ui}

  Creates the lightmaps.

@{i}vis@{ui}

  hm.. don't know.. :) But this tool takes a long time to complete if you
  have chosen "Full build".



Note the -threads option on these tools does not work with the Amiga port
(originally used for Alpha CPU).


@Endnode
@Node "relatedfiles" "Quest - related files"

@{u}Related files@{uu}


In order to create a level you will need a Quake-WAD-file. Get it from

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/planetquake/prefab/quake/qed/quake101wad.zip

or from a mirror

@Endnode
@Node "faq" "FAQ"

@{u}Frequently asked questions@{uu}


@{u}Why is there no Amiga GUI (gadtools/MUI) ?@{uu}

Because Quest has already a good GUI, and I would screw up the whole source
code. Amiga Quest has asl-filerequesters and intuition requesters, though.


@{u}Is there a tool to convert bsp-files into map-files?@{uu}

I don't know. You might search the internet for this. If you find a program
which is able to do so, please @{" send me " link "author"} the source for porting it!
