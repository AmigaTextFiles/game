Thanks go to:

- Linus Torvalds for his incredible work on Linux.
- Chris Carollo and Trey Harrison for the original DOS implementation and the
  source code.
- Nathan Laredo for his unfinished portation of Quest. With his help I got
  finally rid of the f***ing binary menu file.
- Peter Reinholdtsen for his IRIX patch.
- Gyro Gearloose for his pyramids/clone patch.
- Johannes Overmann for stool, a very flexible string replacement utility.
- Sven Thoennissen for his incredible, enthusiastic work on the Amiga port.
- J. Whitham for his investigations in merging both recent arcs of good
  old Quest.
- Buckley A. Hopper for his missing palette patch.
