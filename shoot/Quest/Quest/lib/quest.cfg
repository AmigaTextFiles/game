# ------------
# vid_mode <x>
# ------------
#
# Sets the video mode for Quest to use.  Allowed values are:
#   1  -   640x480
#   2  -   800x600
#   3  -  1024x768
#   4  - 1280x1024
#
# I recommend setting the highest video mode your computer will comfortably
# support, due to the complexity of Quake levels and the difficulty of
# 3-dimensional visualization at lower resolutions.
