TankHunter also needs diskfont.library from your WorkBench

TankHunter uses powerpacker.library to crunch all data files.
PowerPacker is © by Nico François. EasySound & Joystick are from The
C-Manual © by Anders Bjerin (ACC). The music was composed using
OctaMED 1.0b © by Teijo Kinnunen.

You are not allowed to sell TankHunter or a disk containing TankHunter
for more than DM 8.-, $5 or equavalent.

If you want to distribute TH, please include all (!) files. I suggest to
use the LHA file and the installation script included on the original
FISH-release.

			      INSTRUCTIONS
			      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

TH is a game for two players. Please insert a second joystick in port one
of your AMIGA.

When starting TH you are on the options screen. Use the joystick in port
two to move the cursor. In the first row you can select the level, move
your joystick left or right. You can optionally enter the level using the
keyboard. Pressing the joystick button in the second row or pressing the
's'-key will start the game. In the third row you can toggle the music. If
music is disabled, sound effects can be heard. Select 'Quit' to exit TH.

The game itself is quite simple. Player one uses the joystick in port two,
player two the one in port one. Player one controls the tank in the top
left edge of the screen, player two the other one. Drive your tank around
and try to hit the other player. The player whose energy is out first
loses. That's all.

If you want to interrupt the game, press the SPACE-bar.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

				INSTALL DISK
				¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

TH must be started from a bootable disk. A script to install this disk is
included (at least in the original FISH-release). Start it and all will be
donw automatically.
