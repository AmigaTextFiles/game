                      @{FG HIGHLIGHT}1. INTRODUCTION TO 'RESERVOIR DOGZ'@{FG TEXT}

  Hi. My name is Gareth Griffiths, and I have a really annoying habit of
  referring to myself in the third-person, so don't be alarmed when I keep
  calling myself Gareth (?!)
  
  Anyway, thanks for purchasing/downloading/finding 'Reservoir Dogz'. It
  really makes the work that Gareth put in worthwhile. But why did Gareth
  make it? Well, after watching the film 'Reservoir Dogs' by Quentin
  Tarantino, Gareth decided to make a game about it. Unfortunately, because
  of copyright laws in Britain and the USA, he could not call the game
  'Reservoir Dogs' without paying a license fee. So he compromised and 
  replaced the second S with a Z. Problem Solved!
  
  He had been dabbling around in AMOS Pro for a while, and had made games
  like Alien Pong Trilogy 2 (reviewed in AF102), and Shoot Out 1 and 2
  (reviewed in AF103 and AF107 respectively). He had already attempted to
  make an Operation Wolf type game, which went under the title Shoot-Out
  (not to be confused with the others described above.) Unfortunately, 
  Gareth did not have enough experience with AMOS to make one back then,
  so he persevered with Shoot Out 1 and 2 (confused yet?) and APT2. 
    Then, while he was lying in bed watching 'Reservoir Dogs' he hit upon
  the idea on how to get it to work. He started coding the very next day,
  and three months later, this is the result!

  The minimum system configuration to run 'Reservoir Dogz' is:
  
       An Amiga
       Workbench/Kickstart 1.3.2 or above
       A mouse (2-buttoned)
       1.3 Megabytes of Chip RAM
       Fast RAM is not required or utilised.
       A MMU or FPU are neither required or utilised.
       
       A hard drive is not required but is recommended.
      
  To install 'Reservoir Dogz' to a @{FG HIGHLIGHT}hard drive@{FG TEXT} then you simply execute the
  hard drive install script in the root directory of the disk. The script
  is called 'HD-Install' and requires the 'Installer' program to be in your
  path. Note that you must have booted from your hard drive for the script
  to work.

  The file 'R_Dogz.scores' contains high score data. If this file is not
  present, then the game will generate one on the fly.
  
  'Reservoir Dogz' has been tested on:
  
  A1200 / 68020 / 10mb / HD / CD / DD / Wb3.0
  A1200 / 68020 / 2mb  / HD /    / DD / Wb3.0
  A1200 / 68030 / 18mb / HD / CD / DD / Wb3.1
  A500+ / 68000 / 2mb  /    /    / DD / Wb2.04
  A500  / 68000 / 2mb  /    /    / DD / Wb1.3.2
  
  It has not been tested on chipsets above 68030, the PPC boards or a
  68010. If 'Reservoir Dogz' fails to work on your setup, and you suspect
  that it is conflicting with your hardware, send system details to us and
  we will attempt to rectify the problem.

                              @{FG HIGHLIGHT}4. PLAYING THE GAME@{FG TEXT}

  In all reality, playing Reservoir Dogz is very simple. But first, I think
  there are a number of principles you need to understand:-
  
      Gunshot wounds are not easily healed. They are very painful, and
       shooting yourself in the chest is probably not a good idea.
       
      Gravity is everywhere. Your gun hand is not immune to gravity.
       Understand that the crosshair will also succumb to the forces of
       the mighty Isaac Newton.
       
      Policemen in the United Kingdom do not carry guns. Therefore this
       game is not very realistic, as it is set in the UK. However, that
       doesn't mean you can go out and just shoot a copper because he is
       unarmed.
       
      Reservoir Dogz is not really very good. It was just a test to see
       if I could do a game like this.
       
  Anyway, to play Reservoir Dogz, press '1' on the main menu screen.
  (to get to the main menu screen, press the left mouse button whilst the
  credits sequence is displayed, ie when it is first started.) If you leave
  the main menu alone for 10 seconds, the high score table will be
  displayed. If you leave it for a further 10 seconds, then the main menu
  will come back. If you don't want to wait 10 seconds though, just click 
  the left mouse button to get back to the main menu.
  
  The introductory text for level 1 will be 'vidiprinted' on the screen.
  To skip this, press the left mouse button. Then the backdrop will appear
  and so will five other things:-
  
      @{FG HIGHLIGHT}A copper.@{FG TEXT} On level 1, he will appear from one of three different
       places. Get ready to shoot him with the...
       
      @{FG HIGHLIGHT}Crosshair.@{FG TEXT} This is your targeting system. Simply move the crosshair
       over the copper and press the left mouse button to shoot. Note that
       your crosshair is affected by gravity.
       
      @{FG HIGHLIGHT}Ammo Indicator.@{FG TEXT} This shows you how much ammunition you have left in
       the current magazine. You have unlimited magazines, and load
       another magazine, press the @{FG HIGHLIGHT}right mouse button@{FG TEXT}. However, if
       you do this while there are still bullets in the old one, points will
       be lost!
       Each magazine contains a maximum of @{FG HIGHLIGHT}8 rounds@{FG TEXT}.
       
      @{FG HIGHLIGHT}Health Level.@{FG TEXT} This shows how healthy you are. By this I don't mean
       the amount of fresh veg. you have in your diet, but the number of
       times you have been shot, and the maximum hits you can suffer without
       dying.
 
      @{FG HIGHLIGHT}The Score Indicator.@{FG TEXT} Positioned above the health bar, this tells
       you your current score. It doesn't notify you when you qualify for
       high score table name entry.
       
  On level 1, there are @{FG HIGHLIGHT}20 coppers@{FG TEXT} to shoot, but 
  this figure increases, as does their reaction time. Yes, the coppers 
  shoot back. Occasionally, they will actually hit you, and you will lose
  @{FG HIGHLIGHT}10%@{FG TEXT} health. When your health level hits @{FG HIGHLIGHT}
  20%@{FG TEXT} you will die. Whenever you complete a level, your health
  level increases by @{FG HIGHLIGHT}20%@{FG TEXT}. The coppers accuracy
  is increased as you progress through the 5 levels.
  
  There are 5 levels, each with more positions that the coppers can appear,
  more coppers, and a lower reaction time for each copper. There is an end
  sequence, but it isn't more than a static picture with a story on it.

  The scoring system is as follows:

      Every copper killed earns you @{FG HIGHLIGHT}20 points@{FG TEXT}.
     
      Every shot that misses takes @{FG HIGHLIGHT}5 points@{FG TEXT} from your score.

      Every time the coppers hit you, you lose @{FG HIGHLIGHT}1 point@{FG TEXT}.

      If you reload while the magazine is not empty, you lose @{FG HIGHLIGHT}10 points@{FG TEXT}.
 
  When you complete a level, you get a bonus of @{FG HIGHLIGHT}100 points@{FG TEXT}.
  When you complete the game, you get a bonus of @{FG HIGHLIGHT}1000 points@{FG TEXT}.
  If, at the end of the current game, you score was high enough to get on
  to the high score table, you will have the opportunity of entering your
  name. These high scores are kept in the 'R_Dogz.scores' file and are
  saved when you Exit to Workbench from the Main Menu.

                                @{FG HIGHLIGHT}5. BUGS/CAVEATS@{FG TEXT}
                                
  There are not a lot of bugs in this game, but one important one which
  does allow you to cheat is that the coppers don't shoot back while you
  are reloading. If you cannot work out how to cheat from this info, then
  you're THICK! (But you lose points every time you reload!)

  If you experience a bug which causes a copper to suddenly shift position
  to a place where he shouldn't, send me a letter and I will stamp out the
  problem. This was a severe problem on levels 4 and 5, but I managed to
  iron them out. I haven't had any more since, but If you experience one,
  let me know so I can sort it aht! 
  
  There are cheats for unlimited ammo, invulnerability, and level skips to
  each of the levels (excluding level 1). There is also a 'cheat' which
  disables the other cheats. All I'm saying is that you enter them on the
  high score table.
  
  If you find other bugs, send a report to the address given on the
  contact information page.

                             @{FG HIGHLIGHT}6. A POSSIBLE SEQUEL?@{FG TEXT}
  
  Like I've already said, I did originally plan a game called Shoot-Out
  which was similar to this, but didn't have enough experience in AMOS to
  do it. I may still do it, and if I do, I want suggestions for features
  to put into the game. Send them to the address in the contact page.
  
  I may implement:-
  
      Limited magazines, depending on difficulty setting.
      Magazine power-ups.
      Difficulty settings
      More levels.
      Change the language to Blitz, which I am learning at the moment.
     
  Others go to the contact address!!!!!!!!
