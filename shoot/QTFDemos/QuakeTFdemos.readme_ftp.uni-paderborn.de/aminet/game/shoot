Short:    Gibs and Frags in 3 QuakeTF demos.
Author:   estoroth@klendathu.de (Jens Hilgart)
Uploader: estoroth@klendathu.de (Jens Hilgart)
Type:     game/shoot
Requires: Registered Quake, TeamFortress, 3 Maps: 2mach1, 2fort5, 2fort5SE.

This archive contains three demos I recorded on the 11-Dec-1999 and 23-Dec-1999.
All of them end up being relatively crowded, so non-stop gibs are almost guaranteed.

For more information and fun join us in IRC. Channel #amiaquake on IRCnet (i.e.
irc.uni-paderborn.de etc.) or visit the homepages of the three currently existing
Non-QW clans. informationwill of course only mention the URL of the Clan`s page I`m
in :-) (http://www.klendathu.de).

Greetings to all in #amigaquake!
