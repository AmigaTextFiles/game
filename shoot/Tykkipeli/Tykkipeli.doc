Tykkipeli - 19-Nov-1992

Another "Artillery"-clone... A bit like "Tanx", but simpler and slower and
uglier. But in this game, both players can fire simultaneously.

Press left-Amiga-A to swap between game/Workbench.

!!!!Important!!!!

Because of AMOS' flaws, quit any screen blankers before loading!!! Better
still, boot you're machine and run this game alone, without any background
tasks... Makes the game more enjoyable & reliable.

The game's texts are in finnish, which may cause some trouble....

I'll translate this when I have time.

The game contains full docs, just wait (or press fire a couple of times) and
they will appear.

This game was my first "big" AMOS program (written originally in 1990,
slightly improved recently), so it's slow and possibly bug-ridden. If you
find any bugs, report me.
