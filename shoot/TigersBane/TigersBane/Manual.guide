@node INTRO "Introduction to Tiger's Bane"

   Welcome to Tiger's Bane, a game of modern helicopter combat.  The action
takes place on multiple side-scrolling maps, but is slightly more realistic
and tactically oriented than your average shoot-em-up.
   Tiger's Bane has been in development for around 4 years, in one form or
another.  It started life as simply "Flying Tigers", and later migrated to
the Dark Unicorn Productions label, before ending up as "Tiger's Bane" from
Longbow Digital Arts.

   My inspirations for the game include Choplifter, JetStrike, Gunship 2000,
and Desert Strike.  I wanted a game that could capture some of the realism
of multi-helicopter air combat and combined-arms ground combat in a side-
view environment, without being overly fast and furious, and also without
hurting gameplay with too much hard-core simulation realism.

   The Operations in Tiger's Bane are designed first to be fun, and second
to be replayable.  Most Operations (except Training) contain about twice as
many missions as you will actually get to play in one game.  They are
usually chosen randomly, but some branches in the mission tree are based
on your performance up to that point.  Within each mission there are also
random factors at work, so one time there might be an air threat, another
time there might be an extra mobile SAM launcher, etc.

   Hope you enjoy the game!

   Lead Programmer, Longbow Digital Arts.

@node QUICK "Getting started quickly"

   To install Tiger's Bane, simply drag the directory to a location on your
hard drive.  No assigns or other installation steps are necessary.  To play
the game, your system is required to have a monitor capable of 15khz, e.g.
"NTSC:High Res Laced".  High scan frequency modes such as "DblNTSC" are not
supported.  Sorry for any inconveniance this may cause.

   Once Tiger's Bane is running, you can access online help for most menus
by clicking the "Help" balloon in the upper left, either with the mouse or
the joystick.  If you have a CD32 Joypad, you should enter the Options
Screen and select that as your desired method of flight control.  The
"lowlevel.library", included with AmigaDOS 3.1, is required for CD32
joypad support.

   On the Main Menu, select Start a New Game to get under way.  If you have
never played Tiger's Bane before, you should start with the Training
Operation to get a feel for the controls.  On the next screen, select a
skill level, and then choose Fly Operation to begin.

   Once on the Mission Briefing, note the Primary, and if present, Secondary
Targets, along with any other pertinent information.  The "Sightings" report
what @{"Enemy" link EN} and other @{"Friendly" link FR} forces are known to be present in the mission
area.  Select Skip to bypass the mission, or select Arming to choose your
helicopters and weapons for the fight.

   The first @{"helicopter" link HELI} you select on the left hand roster is the one
you will fly.  You can have up to 2 extra Wingmen and one Air Support Jet
Aircraft (you can only fly helicopters).  To change an Aircraft's weapons
loadout, select it on the right hand list (if it isn't already selected)
and modify its @{"armaments" link WEAP} in the lower right panels.  To select a weapon,
click on it in the Stores area on the left.  To place a weapon system on the
Aircraft, click on one of the Hardpoints in the right panel.  The type of
weapon that was previously there, if any, will then be selected.  Once done,
put on your flight suit and helmet, and click Fly Mission.

   Please see the @{"Flight Controls" link CONTROL} section for an overview, and details,
of the helicopter control systems in Tiger's Bane.

   Once you're armed and at your base, take off, complete the mission
objectives, and land back where you started (most of the time).  If your
helicopter gets too damaged to return to base, try to make an emergency
landing on something flat, or eject if all else fails.  Breaking a bird and
surviving is better than breaking a bird and getting killed in the process.

   After the mission, you will see the @{"Debriefing" link DEBR} screens.

@node CONTROL "Learning to fly a helicopter"

   First a word of warning.  The controls in Tiger's Bane are NOT those of
your average side-scrolling shooter.  They will likely take some getting
used to, but it shouldn't take too long.  Some points to remember:

   o Your helicopters have lots of mass, and lots of inertia to go along
with it.  Especially in windy conditions, it may take a little time for your
helicopter to start moving in the direction you want it to.  Think ahead.
   o The controls don't auto-center by default, so to stop moving you have
to bring them back to center yourself.  (This IS handy in combat, once you
get the hang of it.)  Watch the little green HUD pips around your chopper,
they show you how your controls are set.
   o Some helicopters have Fly By Wire systems installed, which will assist
you by making it easier to level out your rate of climb, and by (trying) to
help you avoid collisions with structures and the ground.  The system can
become damaged, though, so you should learn to fly choppers that don't have
it.  Without Fly By Wire, you will lose vertical thrust as you start
accelerating horizontally, and must compensate so as to not hit the ground.

   With that out of the way, on to the basics.  In all methods of control,
your main joystick/joypad/keys move your helicopter.  Up and down set your
collective, or rate of climb and descent, and left and right control your
pitch forward and backward, which dictate your horizontal movement.  In
general, most weapons require you to press and then let go of the key/
button/direction assosciated with them, however Chainguns will auto-fire.
The Evasive manouvre can sometimes be used to dodge past missiles and
bullets that are flying your way.

   -One Joystick-
   Weapons:  Press and hold fire, then move the stick in one of the four
main directions (see diagram).  Do NOT have autofire set on your joystick.
   Turning:  Tap the stick twice backwards to turn around, or leave the
stick centered and tap the fire button.
   Evasive:  Tap the stick up twice or down twice.

   -Two Joysticks-
   Weapons:  Push the second joystick in any direction (see diagram).
   Turning:  Tap the main joystick twice backwards, or tap either joystick's
fire button.
   Evasive:  Tap the main stick up twice or down twice.

   -CD32 Joypad-
   Weapons:  Press one of the main fire buttons (see diagram).
   Turning:  Press the "Rewind" button.
   Evasive:  Press the "Fast Forward" button.
   Pausing:  Push the "Play/Pause" button to freeze the action.
   Ejecting:  Press both the "Fast Forward" and "Rewind" buttons at once.

   Weapon vs. Direction Diagram:

               Up/Yellow
               -Wingtip-
             (def. Sidearm/
              Sidewinder)

     Left/Green    |     Right/Blue
     -Outboard-  --O--   -Inboard-
   (def. Rockets)  |  (def. Hellfires)

                Down/Red
               -Gun Mount-
             (def. Chaingun)

   -Keyboard-
   The keyboard controls are fully configurable on the Options Screen.  As
with the CD32 Joypad controls, one tap of a key designated as firing a
certian hardpoint will fire the weapon.  Keyboard controls are active
regardless of the primary control method, and both can be used at the same
time.  For example, the joystick can be used to fly the helicopter, and the
keyboard can be used to fire weapons, turn around, and evade.  Some useful
default keys are:

   Space, Eject (blades are detonated first, you'll live).
   P, Pause on/off.
   I, FLIR on/off (Forward Looking Infra Red).
   Escape, Emergency Abort (generally bad news).

@node DEBR "After the mission, stats on the carnage"

   After each mission, you will be shown how many Carnage Points you
scored (one for each enemy unit and structure destroyed), and how
successfully the Primary, and if present, Secondary objectives were
completed.  You might receive bonus Carnage Points for flying weaker
helicopters without Wingmen as support.  Note that Carnage Points have
no bearing on whether you are victorious in an Operation, your Mission
Success Rate determines whether you win or lose in the end.  Carnage
Points are simply an indicator of your destructive abilities in combat,
and will be recorded on the High Score Table along with your Success
Rate for posterity.

   If the operation is over (either because you played to the end, lost
your base, or were killed in action) you'll be shown an ending screen
and then the high score table for the operation.  If you survived till
the end and your Mission Success Rate was 80% or higher, you'll get to
see the winning screen for the operation.  Between 70% and 79% is a
stalemate, and less than 70% is a defeat.

@node HELI "The Tigers you can fly"

   Note:  Blackhawks will only carry one squad of troops at a time.
Wingman Blackhawks should automatically land to pick up and drop off
troops at the proper locations in a mission requiring it, as long as
you hover in the area around the pick up or drop off zone.

@node TAC "Tactics and tips in the Tiger's Bane game world"

   WEAPON SYSTEMS:

   The most important thing to remember when attacking enemy units
and structures is to use the right weapon for the job.  Effective use
of the weapons available will cause maximum damage while conserving
your limited resources.

   Chainguns and Hydra Rockets should be used against soft or lightly
armored targets.  Examples of such targets are troop squads, transport
trucks, gun emplacements, SAM radars and missile launchers, aircraft
hangars, houses, most factories, wooden bridges, and comms towers.
Since the range of Rockets and especially Chaingun is rather limited,
it can be dangerous to use them against large concentrations of heavy
air defences.  Tip: If you come across enemy main battle tanks without
anti-aircraft support, enough Rockets will take them out without using
up valuable Hellfires.

   When attacking a large group of light to medium armored targets with
your Rockets, try positioning yourself fairly close to the ground, and
then pitch forwards until your unguided weapons sight (a little green
cross on the ground in front of you) is located at the approximate
maximum range of your Rockets.  As you slowly drift towards the targets,
simply fire off a salvo of rockets whenever a target comes into range.
This technique works especially well against targets in wooded areas,
or enemies hiding amongst light structures.

   Hellfires are your primary anti-armor weapon, and will home in on
the target currently painted by your laser targetting system.  (If it
becomes destroyed, your Hellfires will no longer track.)  Use them to
quickly dispatch tanks, and to destroy dangerous targets at long range.
Hellfires also pack the most destructive punch against structures, and
are the only sensible weapon to use against bunkers, hardened aircraft
shelters, and iron girder bridges.  It is important to keep in mind
that Hellfires are nearly useless against troop squads and aircraft,
and should be used as a weapon of utter last resort.

   SideWinders are the preferred weapon for use against air threats,
though Rockets and Chaingun are also effective at close range.  Fire
when you see a red diamond surrounding the target aircraft.

   SideArms are a variant on the SideWinder with a radar seeking head,
intended for use against ground based radar sources.  If you expect
to encounter significant radar guided SAM threats, SideArms can be an
invaluable assistance.  While Hellfires will take out threats that are
closest to you, SideArms will seek directly towards the nearest
emitting radar source (signified by a green diamond) and destroy it.
In a crowded target area, firing a SideArm first can quickly
neutralize a large portion of the anti-aircraft defences.

   ENEMIES:

   You can prevent enemy radar (fixed radar at SAM sites, mobile radar
guided SAM launchers, and some ZSU-23s) from detecting you by flying
close enough to the ground, or by putting a building or hill between
you and the radar.  If the enemy's radar lock is broken, radar guided
missiles in the air at that time should stop tracking.  IR guided SAM
launchers and missiles do not have this disadvantage, and can fire at
you no matter what your altitude above ground if they aquire a lock.

   If enemy Migs are bothering you, try flying very close to the
ground and behind obstacles.  Their high speed makes it dangerous for
them to venture too close to the ground, and their high altitude
makes it harder for their radar to pick you out of the ground noise.
Turn around before the Mig makes its pass over you, and launch a
SideWinder up its tailpipe as soon as you get a lock.
