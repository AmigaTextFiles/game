@NODE Main "Fat Ally II - Special Edition"

Please note the following text was written by me 3 years ago (before I sold
my Amiga and bought a PC), when I was a quite overly enthusiastic Amiga
supporter. I've calmed down a lot since then, got a decent job to support my way
through Uni and realised that everything I said about the PC in the past was very
very true.

         Fat Ally II - SE
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   This is the first AmigaGuide document I've ever written so it may have a
few overlooked bugs in it, please don't this affect your viewpoint on the
game itself (i.e. don't expect it to be as good as this,(-: ).
    @{" Fat Ally " LINK fat_ally} II was created using @{" AMOS " LINK amos} and a variety of other
programs including Dpaint, Imagine V2 and @{" ImageStudio " LINK image}.
   I'm sorry if you don't like this game but I would like you to remember
that I am quite a new entry in the big long guest book that is the Amiga, and
my only previous contact with computers was an aging rubber keyed @{" speccy " LINK speccy}
and one of those SuperUltraPlayStationJupiter68 washing machine things. 
This game was created on a stock 1200 with an external disk drive and 245
meg hard disk drive.  In a few weeks I should also have 6 meg of memory after
committing my life to one of slave labour (tell me, is £1.20 an hour, for 8
hours a day, good value.  I think not).  I've become quite a bit of an Amiga
addict as of late and have vowed never to leave my machine for one of those
586PentiumIntel/DX/SXBollocksArse @{" PC " LINK pc} so-called-computers that all the Sunday
papers wet their pants over.  As I write this it has been announced that
Escom are be the new owners of our fabled technology, and so may the force 
be with them (cringe).  If anybody reading this is considering selling their 
Amiga to "upgrade" it to a totally different platform I can only but warn 
them, IF YOU SELL YOUR AMIGA YOU WILL MORE THAN LIKELY REGRET IT FOR THE 
REST OF YOUR COMPUTING LIFE, GONE WILL BE AN EASY TO USE AND QUITE SIMPLY 
BRILLIANT MACHINE AND GAINED WILL BE A OVER-HYPED PIECE OF CRAP WHICH WAS 
CREATED IN  THE 70'S AND SHOULD HAVE STAYED THERE.  DO NOT SELL YOUR AMIGA!

@NODE fat_ally "Fat Ally"
   Fat Ally is the dream child of @{" Mike Hogg " LINK mike} and was created
during an imaginative argument on the downfalls of the modern music often
referred to as "Rave".  Mike suggested the constant blips and bleeps shoved
out by all manner of drooling DJ's could be connected up to a C64 to produce
an all new game.  This game would be called "Fat Ally Cleans the Streets"
and would involve a rather plump person going by the name of Ally chasing an
epileptic Coke can around an abandoned park.  A few days later I had
an hour or so to spare so I went to work on an Amiga version of the latter
game.  Half an hour later it was complete, and as I like to put it was utter
cack.  Still despite these humble beginnings, Fat Ally has gone on to be a
household name (well at least in my household) and international superstar. 
Ally's second game cunningly entitled "Fat Ally 2" was met with somewhat
scepticism (3 refusals from PD companies to date), so it was decided
that the ultimate Fat Ally game had to made to put the allegations of Fat
Ally being crap to rest.  A new Fat Ally game was born, which although
similar sounding is nothing like "Fat Ally 2" (it has "II" instead of "2"
for a start).

@NODE amos "AMOS"
   Fat Ally II - SE was made using AMOS which I reckon to be an alright way
of making games, but my views are not shared by certain individuals. 
True, AMOS does have it's faults (no AGA support,  no access to intuition
except through separate commercial add-ons etc.) but there is no denying
that it is just perfect for knocking up the simple, not-to-complex game and
getting it to run at a reasonable speed.  AMOS is the perfect tool for
luring beginners into programming and also keeping them there to continue
pumping new fresh blood into the Amiga PD and maybe even commercial games
scene.

@NODE mike "Mike Hogg"
   Since Mike created Fat Ally (or at least the character of Fat Ally) it is
compulsory for me to include a few lines of text about him.  Mike has this
strange dream about moving to America and living in a small rural town. 
Somehow he's got it into his head that this insignificant game will propel
him into the realms of the rich and famous.  Personally I reckon the only
person apart from myself to actually see this game will be the person at the
PD companies who's job it is to empty the bins.

@NODE image "ImageStudio"
   I am a fully registered user of this absolutely f@#king brilliant
shareware image processor.  If you have not yet heard of this amazingly fine
package I strongly advise you to get a copy from aminet, local PD etc. for I
can guarantee you that you will not be disappointed.  I know this must sound
like I wrote it or something but I do believe that it is without a doubt the
greatest ever PD program.  Ever.

@NODE speccy "The Speccy"
   My very ever first computer was a rubber keyed spectrum 48K 8Bit
microcomputer (to give it it's full name).  It cost me £45 and was in my
opinion the best money I'd ever spent.  Originally my plan on getting a
computer was to "do my homework on it".  Of course as is always the case I
ended up playing games on it all the time.  The speccy is the most classic
of all the 8-Bits in my opinion.  If you want to re-live the old days I
would recommend you purchase the ZXAM shareware speccy emulator which runs
at a reasonable speed and is just what you need to bring all the nostalgia
flooding back. Oo it brings tears to me eyes.

@NODE pc "The work of Satan"
   As of late due to the fall of Commodore and much undue hype this rather
feeble computer format's sales have taken a sharp increase.  I have
unfortunately had the misfortune to use one of these "revolutionary computers"
and hated every moment of it.  Here are my own personal pet hates of this
satanic machine which was obviously created by somebody very annoyed with
life, considering suicide and wanting to leave the rest of the world in
eternal anguish:

   1. It isn't an Amiga.
   2. Even with 32Meg and a Pentuim chip it can barely multitask.
   3. It can only have 8 letters in a filename.
   4. You can only store 1.44Meg on a high density disk.
   5. You have to buy a soundcard to have sound better than that of a
       speccy.
   6. Windows is utter cack.
   7. DOS is worse.
   8. Try getting something as good as Dopus on it.
   9. There is no such thing as "free" PD.
   10. Can't handle anywhere near as many colours as HAM8 without a 
       graphics card.
   11. Don't get "Gravity Force 2" for it.
   12. No accessory is ever compatible with another one.
   13. I've never used it for more than 2 hours without it
            crashing.  (normally less).
   14. All "serious" programs usually need over 50Meg of hard disk
       space.
   15. Every time you turn it on more hard disk space "evaporates".
   16. Try making an animation then saving it to a domestic video
       player.
   17. Compare "Paintbrush" to "Dpaint".
   18. It's vastly overpriced for what you can do with it. (£900 for a
       great plant pot holder).
   19. It doesn't have a command line history.(In an Amiga shell enter
       something that is obviously wrong e.g. "Format pants" and press
       return.  Press Up and it will reappear, now do the same on a PC).
   20. Try doing anything half usefull on a 2Meg PC, then try the same
       on an stock A1200.
   21. You don't get "OctaMed" for it.
   22. You have to BUY screensavers. (No GBlanker, Oo No No.)
   23. You don't get "Fat Ally II - SE".
   24. In one evening I convinced Mike Hogg to buy an Amiga, after he
       spent over a year working with PCs.
   25. There's no easy way to get into programming with it.(No AMOS or
       BB2 or similar.)
   26. It even needs drivers just to run a mouse.
   27. You can emulate a PC on an Amiga but can you emulate an Amiga on
       a PC?
   28. You can't "Drag" screens down and up.
   29. Even with 8Meg it always seems to run out of memory amazingly
       quickly.
   30. I could never think of 30 things wrong with the Amiga.
