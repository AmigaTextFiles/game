          M E G A  B O M B E R  v0.1


Music/Graphics/code - Anthony Vaughan Bartram

Playtesting/Ideas - Jonathan Price

  This is a little free-ware game I was inspired to do after seeing some
of the existing pd/free versions of the game. This is kind of just a 
preliminary hack, but if anyone wants to give me any feedback then mail
all comments to the address below.


	I'll upload a totally finished version in a few weeks. 

This (??) took:-
               10 pizzas
               5-20 coffee`s
               3 rows
               2 missing disks
               1 complete re-write
               2 alcoholic binges
