 Welcome to my Demo of Incinerator.  I have dedicated this game to my cat, Peanut.  I have spent a whole lot of time in creating this program and I hope you like it. Incinerator is Shareware for $5.00.  In return for regeristration, I will give you the full version of incinerator.  Since I have to send a disk anyway, I may try to fill it up with other things.  I will also accept Shareware or freeware in an even trade ONLY IF YOU WROTE IT, sort of like a software exchange for programmers like myself who have no money.  Incinerator, and all of its support files are copyright  1993 Pete W Storonskij, and it is freely distributable shareware, and must not be modified or fragmented in any way.  The disabled version is freely distributable, but the FULL VERSION CANNOT BE DISTRIBUTED, as I am the only one authorized to distribute it.  Now to get to the Incinerator instructions. 
************************************************************

  IMPORTANT NOTE:  If the write protect tab is set to protect, the program will seem to lock up when you enter your name, so when you get the full version, make this adjustment (I have disabled the high score changes as well as the cheat mode and play beyond the second round, you can find the cheat mode in this version, but it will tell you that it is disabled).

  In order to play Incinerator, you need 1 Meg of chip ram, and 1 floppy drive.  It works on the A3000, A1200, and all earlier models that I know of.  It works in 2.xx workbench as well as version 3.0.

  To install Incinerator on a hard drive, drag over Incinerator and IncineratorFiles (directory) to the same path on your hard drive.  That is all there is to it, really.

  To play, double click the Incinerator icon, or type in Incinerator in the CLI or SHELL.  Loading takes a while from disk, so get a snack (It takes only several seconds to load from the hard drive).

  You get a choice of Easy, Medium, and Hard games, for which the difficulty level increases during game play.  More missiles, faster play, and tougher computer opponents are set for the hard level.

  You get to play 1 or 2 players, for which you alternate attacking and defending between each other.  The computer plays the second player in 1 player mode.

  SCORING:    Missiles:                     25 points
              Missiles by chain reaction:   35 points
              Helicopters:                        250 points
              Anything destroyed by Bombs: 40% of above
  BONUSES:     Energy units: 4 points per unit, 500 points max
              City Section survives round:  100 points
  EXTRAS:      City Sections: 1 every 5000 points
              Super Bombs: 1 every 5000 points (start with 3)
              Infinite Super Bombs:  Activating Cheat Mode (be creative, or silly: this is not a hint)

  No points are accumulated when attacking the enemy city.  This lets you concentrate completely on the detsruction of the enemy city.  You attack the enemy city every other round. You send missiles to their precise destinations by clicking where you want them to land.

  Helicopters are very nasty since they rapid-fire lasers on the city, wiping out huge sections of the city.  They don't start firing on the city immediately, but they should be destroyed immediately.

  To use a super weapon you press both mouse buttons or the space bar.  This wipes out all of the missiles on screen and even gets the helicopter.

  To pause the game, press any key on the keyboard (except space).  To restart the game, press the fire button.
  You have two laser cannons, each with its own energy supply.  Your lasers will be disabled if you run out of energy for that laser cannon or if it is destroyed.  The energy is replenished at half of your rapid-fire rate, as long as the energy dishes are intact.

  There is a defence shield that protects the city from a few missiles.  The helicopter can not penetrate the shield, and will reserve it's energy for until the shield is knocked down by missiles.  If the laser capacitors are full, the energy from the dishes will go to reinforcing the force field.

  If you get a high score, you will get to enter your name.  The top 15 high scores are stored with 10 characters for each name.  If you want a high score against the computer, then don't kill off the enemy city until your score is high enough (The computer will not be as nice and will not spare your city).

  I plan to develop games professionally for the Amiga, and this is only $5.00, which is extremely cheap for the quality of this game. With a price this low, I can only keep doing this if a sizable fraction of Amigans support me.  If you do like this game, then please don't procrastinate and get the full version from me.  I hope you really like my games, after all, I can't make a living from it if you don't register directly with me.

 To clear your conscience of playing this game, send $5.00 to:
