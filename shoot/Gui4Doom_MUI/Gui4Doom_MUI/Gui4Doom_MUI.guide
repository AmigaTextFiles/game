@Node Introduction "Introduction"

  @{B}@{U}Introduction@{UU}@{UB}

  For now more than 3 months, Doom can be played on Amiga.
But, there are now many engines (7), and it is not easy
to configure all to know which is the best on one's amiga.

  So, Xavier decided to code a GUI to easily use all dooms.
He then asked me to code a MUI interface for it. Then, after
version 0.5, I decided to totally remake the interface. I wanted
it to be more powerfull and still easy to use. After many hours
of work (Xavier also helped me, of course), we think it is
ready.
