@TOC "STILL"

@{i}'There are some corners of the Universe which have bred the most terrible things, things which go against everything we believe in. They must be fought.'
@{ui}
Cpt. Custard is (loosely) based on an old arcade game called Time Pilot.
It is exremely configurable to suit your machine type and your personal preference.

It was created using Amos 1.3, Dpaint IV & Real 3D. Originally it took just 3 days to write, including all GFX.
That was Easter 96, and since then I have occasionally added and improved bits and pieces..

@node "PLAY" "HOW TO PLAY CUSTARD"
@TOC "STILL"

Despite the complexity of this document, Captain Custard is very easy to play. If you haven't tried it yet, put this guide away now and go kill some bad guys.

Six easy steps to make a good Custard.

1  Fly around in Space.

2  Look at the stars.

3  @{"Shoot" link "BULLETS"} everything else.

4  Don't let anything hit you.

5  @{"Flip" link "FLIPPING"} your Ship.

6  Change the @{"settings" link "SET"} to reflect your machine speed and your ability.
@endnode
@node "FLIPPING"
@TOC "STILL"
When your Ship is facing directly up or down, you can Flip by moving the @{"Mouse/Joystick" link "JOY"} in the opposite Direction.
Nothing can hit you while flipping, and you can use this technique to take out multiple Enemies/Missiles at once, but you will be damaged if you come back into play over an exploding enemy.

@endnode
@node "CONFIG" "The CONFIG Screen"
@TOC "STILL"
            THE CONFIGUATION MENU
The current version of the game does not have Levels to play and complete like a normal game.
Instead you have the Configuration screen where you can adjust the way the game plays. Kind of like an in game Trainer/Cheat screen.

Toggle the Config screen at any time by pressing the right mouse button.

By pressing the letter on your keyboard to the left of each option you can
edit the @{"settings" link "SET"} used in the game.

Note that activating this screen will reset your score and shield.

In the the interest of personal freedom for the individual, the options that are non-volatile have not been idiot proofed.
@endnode

@node "SET" "Change The Settings."
@TOC "STILL"
In the @{"Configuration Screen" link "CONFIG"}  You can change the following-

       @{"The Input Device" link "JOY"}

    A: @{" Maximum Speed   " link "SPEED"}
    B: @{" Maximum Reverse " link "REVERSE"}
    C: @{" Acceleration    " link "ACCELERATION"}

@node "JOY" "Mouse / Joystick Support"
@TOC "SET"

Captain Custard supports both mouse and joystick play.

In the @{"Config Screen" link "CONFIG"} you can swap betweeen mouse and joystick mode by pressing fire on the Joystick or the left mouse button.

To play with the Mouse, simply point the crosshair at the edge of the screen you wish to fly towards. Use Left mouse button to @{"fire" link "BULLETS"}


Both modes support @{"Flipping" link "FLIPPING"}.
@endnode

@node "SPEED"
@TOC "SET"

A @{"Shared" link "SHARED"} Setting

At Low speeds, the enemy missiles can become more dificult to avoid
At High speeds, you won't even see what hit you.

Playable speeds range from about 600 - 1600
@endnode

@node "REVERSE"
@TOC "SET"

A @{"Shared" link "SHARED"} Setting

Backwards is better...

To fly backwards-

Set reverse speed High.
Set @{"Banking Drag" link "BANKING"} reasonably high. It works like acceleration in reverse.
Set @{"Friction" link "FRICTION"} to a low value (or off).
Turn from side to side or around in circles.
@endnode

@node "ACCELERATION"
@TOC "SET"

This setting is @{"shared" link "SHARED"} with the enemy, AND their missiles.

@endnode

@node "FRICTION"

A @{"Shared" link "SHARED"} Setting

In Space You Have No Brakes. (see @{"Banking Drag" link "BANKING"})
But this setting will slow you down, eventually...
@TOC "SET"
@endnode

@node "BANKING"
@TOC "SET"

A @{"Shared" link "SHARED"} Setting.

This is the amount you decelerate while turning.
High Banking and low @{"Centering" link "CENTERING"} do not mix.

This setting has a big effect on the Bad Guys. Set it high and some brain types will be completely screwed.
@endnode

@node "CENTERING"
@TOC "SET"

This setting is what keeps your ship in the centre of the screen.

From 'Time-Pilot' mode (1000+) where you stay dead centre at all times, to Gyruss mode (1) where at full speed you zip around the outside edge of the screen.

   Or you can try anywhere in between.

Low centering can be used (with practise) to avoid missiles and mines.
@endnode

@node "MINES"
@TOC "SET"

Change the number of mines floating around.

Mines can be used against the Bad Guys if you can manage to lead them into one.
This is very useful when restoring your @{"Sheild" link "SHEILD"}
@endnode

@node "BULLETS"
@TOC "SET"

All hail the power of the mighty @{b}Custard Gun@{ub}

Use this @{"setting" link "SET"} to change Custard's Fire power

If you set bullets to six or more, it is strongly recommended to keep firing at all times, don't use Auto-Fire, just keep the button pressed.

Note that this setting affects the amount of total enemies you have to kill to complete a level. (so does mines)
The little yellow bar beside the sheild indicator is a mission indicator.
When the yellow runs out, you win!!
@endnode

@node "STARS"

These don't slow the game down too much, but if you need that extra speed from your machine, you can turn the stars down a bit.
Likewise, if you have that extra Grunt, turn them all on and take the scenic route.
@TOC "SET"
@endnode

@node "ENEMY"
@TOC "SET"

The Evil Klyteroids...
The more, the merrier.

Eight is fun, but that's with lots of @{"bullets" link "BULLETS"} and an 060.

Or turn them off all together, and have big fun while you fly around the deserted Minefeild.
@endnode

@node "REFLEX"
@TOC "SET"

This setting controls the Enemies brain speed.

It sets the delay between each direction adjustment.
Note that each additional enemy after the first receives a slightly slower reflex automatically.
@endnode

@node "AI"
@TOC "SET"

 THE BRAIN TYPES

There are nine Brain types-

 Brain 0 - this is the default brain. All enemies use this brain until they are in firing range.

Once an enemy has fired, it then switches into it's brain mode until it's missile hits, times out, or is destroyed.
 
@{i}#  Value Type@{ui}
1-  001  Mimic
2-  002  Lefty
3-  004  Dodger
4-  008  Rookie
5-  016  Kamikazee
6-  032  Swiper
7-  064  Wing Sticker
8-  128  Guerilla

These are not really in any order.

By adding together the values shown above, each individual brain type can be enabled or disabled.

ie-  For Rookies only,              BRAIN TYPE :8
     For Kamikazees and Guerillas,  BRAIN TYPE :144 (16+128)
     For All Brains enabled,        BRAIN TYPE :255 (1+2+4+8+16+32+64+128)

Once types are activated, the way the game chooses who has what brain IS random. So if you Have ENEMIES: 2 and BRAIN TYPES: 5, You could end up with 2 mimics, 2 rookies or one of each.

Different settings, such as friction, banking drag and especially Reflex (which is the Enemies Brain Speed) have varying effects on the different Brains, Generally the lower these settings, the harder the Enemy, although this is not always true.

If you are going to change the Brain Types, which are all active by default, I recommend trying each of the Brains by itself first, so you can get to know which ones you like.


EDITING BRAIN TYPES.

From the Config screen press '*' on your keypad (or Shift-8)

This is new (made yesterday) and still a bit buggy on exit. but it does work, in that you can view, edit and save the default brain types held in the 'Brains' file.

Note that this file (Brains) will get saved over if you dont MAKE A BACKUP FILE FIRST!!!  

Brain 0 is Absolute (it doesn't depend on player direction) and it is not advisable to change this one unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing.

Brains 1 to 8
The Circle of enemies show their desired direction, relative to the direction you are facing, ie. most guys dont like being in front of you.

Use the keypad keys to edit,
7,9,1,3: for editing individual directions.
8,4,6,2,9,(,):for editing all directions simultaneously.
+,-: change braintype you are editing.
Space to exit.   

If you make a good brain file, please E-mail me a copy together with the settings it works best with (banking and soforth).
@endnode


@node "TURBO"

  This option is off/False/0  by default.
  Turning it on removes a 'Wait' instruction.
  Depending on your machine and the exact amount of graphics you set into the game this can be good, bad or have no effect at all.
@TOC "SET"
@endnode

@node "DEMO"
@TOC "SET"

  Just like the Game but you don't get to play.
  Very useful this.
@endnode

@node "SHEILD"
@TOC "STILL"
When something hits you, you may notice that you dont die straight away.
This is because you have a Sheild.

Notice the coloured circle around the ship icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. When this is white or blue you dont have much of a problem. Black is not good. Red is worse. When the red is flashing you're as good as dead.

Losing all your Sheild automatically activates the @{"Config Screen" link "CONFIG"}

You can slowly restore your Sheild by not firing for a while. This is when you need to use the @{"mines" link "MINES"}
@endnode

@node "SHARED"
@TOC "SET"
  For the interest of fairness some settings apply to the Bad Guys as well.
@endnode
