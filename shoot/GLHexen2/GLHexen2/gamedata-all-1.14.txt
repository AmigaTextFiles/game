Changes since Raven's 1.11/1.12a update:

1.14
=========
- Released as part of Hammer of Thyrion-1.3.0.
- Disallowed cycling to a weapon without proper mana (S.A)
- Bumped the teleport-push speed to a highest safe value of 225
  (250 is still safe, but just in case)  and restricted that to
  the Cathedral map when not in deathmatch.  Otherwise, Raven's
  original value (300) is used.
- Enabled impulse 34, (puzzle piece inventory list) (S.A)
- added Pa3PyX' fire delay bits for paladin's staff.
- Map cycling: renamed map_name to a more intuitive map_next
  Cleaned up some dprint's

=========
Merged the missing H2MP axtail (1.12-1.12a) patch from Raven

=========
(Merges from Pa3PyX' sources)
- fps independent crossbow, setstaff and flameorb fire rates
- no more 20 tornadoes per second from meteor staff at 200 fps

  with each other.   * assasin cloak ability re-write.
- necromancer soul steal adjustments to make it really useful.
- fixes to demoness abilities according to the manual
- crusader's full-mana ability starts at level3, assasin's
  backstab and crusader's holy strength start at level6.

1.12f
=========

  romeric6, meso9 and eidolon

1.12e
=========
