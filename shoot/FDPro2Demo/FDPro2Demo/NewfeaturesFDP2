Announcing the release of...

Fighter Duel Pro 2

Fighter Duel Pro 2 sets the standard for realistic flight simulation in the
home computer market.  From the detailed aerodynamic model to the
lightning-fast frame rate, FDPro2 is unparalled in simulating the 'feel'
of flying. With a full selection of aircraft and added features,
FDPro2 delivers the flight simulation package for the serious aviator.

All the features of the best selling WWII flight simulator Fighter Duel Pro
plus...

- Compatibility with both AGA and original chipsets.  Thirty-five percent
  performance increase with Amiga 1200 & 4000 models displaying the
  AGA 640 x 400 Hi-res No Flicker video mode.

- The super planes, including the German ME-262 jet, the rocket-powered
  Komet, the TA-152H version of the FW-190, the ME-110, the Japanese
  KI-84, the Russian Yak-3, the American  F2G Corsair and P-61 Black
  Widow, and arguably the best fighter of WWII, the British Mark XIV
  Spitfire. This brings the number of individually modelled and flight
  tested aircraft to a total of twenty-five.

- Fly against a 4 aircraft formation, with individual fuselage colors and
  markedly improved aggressiveness and tracking abilities.  Plus, change
  the foe aircraft type during flight.

- A redesigned gunnery system that accurately plots bullet trajectories
  and includes a sophisticated lead-computing gunsight.

- Keyboard equivalents for all aircraft functions.

  unlimited ammo option.

- Automatic detection and utilization of advanced processors and larger
  memory systems.

  mode where you fly wing with one computer controlled aircraft and
  battle two others, and a stationary gunnery mode where you man an
  anti-aircraft machine gun while attacked by computer controlled aircraft.

- The two-player hookup system now features 1200-14400 baud modem as well
  as null modem cable support and phonebook storage of your FDPro 2
  opponent's phone numbers.

- A "chat" mode that allows in-flight communication in two-player modes,
  plus the ability to send preset comments with a single keystroke.

- With a two-player hookup it is now possible to battle
  computer-controlled foes, either as a ME110 or P61 pilot and gunner,
  or lead and wing formation.
