system that normally allows you to switch your aircraft, your enemies
aircraft and their skill levels.  To switch these you will have to reboot
and reselect. You can't save your preferences from the Startup-Interface.
None of our famous 2 player modes are allowed, including the new 2 Seater
Pilot/Gunner modes and Wingman modes.
