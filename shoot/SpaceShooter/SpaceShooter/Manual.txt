   Space Shooter
   A simple game with ASCII graphics
   Version 1.1, by Krister Fundin (fundin@yahoo.com)

         Introduction
         ============

   This here manual describes how and why (but mostly how) to play Space
Shooter, which, as the subheading up there suggests, is a simple game with
ASCII graphics, meaning that the screen looks sort of like a page of what
you are reading here, except with fewer letters and more funny comic-strip-
character-cursing-like symbols. In the game, you guide a spaceship (I know
it looks like a giant bird, but it's really a spaceship), trying to avoid
getting shot down and generally having a good time.

         Objective
         =========

   The goal of Space Shooter is simply to stay alive as long as possible.
You do this by bringing down enemies before they bring you down, and by
replenishing your energy through the occasional power-up extra.

         Controls
         ========

   Steer the spaceship left or right using your joystick. Press fire to use
the blasters, but don't fire too frequently or they'll run out of energy.

   The ESCAPE key quits the game. Another key that might be of interest is
the print screen key (top right on the numeric keypad), which saves a
snapshot of the screen in the form of a text file. These files will be
called "Screenshot.x", where the x is a number which starts at 1, and will
appear in the current directory. Note that the count resets every time the
game is started, so either move or rename the files if you don't want them
to get overwritten.

         Enemies
         =======

   There are only two kinds of enemies in Space Shooter. The "fighters"
don't actually fight that much -- rather, they simply try to crash into your
spaceship. You won't be able to shake them off if they get too close, so
you'll have to shoot them down.

   The "birds" (more birds!) flutter about randomly, making them a tad
harder to hit. They have blasters of their own, which they use from time to
time. Don't let too many of them stay alive or you'll have trouble avoiding
their fire.

         Other stuff
         ===========

   Now and then, a power-up object will fly by. Pick them up to replenish
your energy. There are also some stars and planets in the background --
they're just scenery and can be ignored completely, and the same goes for
the debris that is left after some of the explosions.

         The status bar
         ==============

   At the bottom of the screen is a status bar which shows, from left to
right, your energy, your current weapon (there's only one to choose from,
but whatever) and your score.

         Almost done
         ===========

   Yeah, I'll readily admit that this game is a bit shoddily programmed.
Lots of features are missing, the collision detection is clunky, it will
probably run at the wrong speed on anyone's computer but mine, and don't
even mention that buggy display code. (Which reminds me: no warranty,
provided as-is, use at your own risk, etc.) But the reason isn't just that
I've been lazy (no, really), it's also because I've spent more time working
on a different version of the same game. Besides having a full colour
display, this version sports two additional enemy types, a choice of three
weapons, a hiscore table and lots of other stuff. I'll leave it as an
exercise for the reader to find it and make it run.
