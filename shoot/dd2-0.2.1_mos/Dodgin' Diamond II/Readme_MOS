This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).

For further instruction just use the included ReadMe and/or

PS: I changed the fire keys to the left/right shift keys
	(reason: SDL only recognizes the left ctrl key and I
	have a KVM-switch which uses the ctrl keys to switch
	through the connected computers)
