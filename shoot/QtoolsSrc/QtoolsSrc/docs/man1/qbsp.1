 this does the CSG operations on the brushes, fills away the outside of the map,
generates a bsp and all of the polygons required for drawing, bsps for the
clipping hulls, and copies all of the textures that are actually used out of the
editor's wadfiles into the output bsp files.
   
 qbsp generates these files:
  map.bsp		- the output map file to be read by quake or light/vis
  map.prt		- the portal file to be read by vis
  map.h1
  map.h2		- hull files written by forked processes.
  map.pts		- pointfile for tracing leaks in the level.
    
 In quake, you can type "pointfile" and it will leave a trail of dots from the
outside to the first entity it ran into.  Qbsp will refuse to generate a .prt
file if the map is not completely sealed in.

  It is possible to vis an unsealed map, but it could take hours.  Seal it up
first.

 You can make a .bsp file that can be run by quake with just the qbsp program.
When it is loaded into the game, it will be fullbright, and will allways draw
the entire level (slow).  This is fine for developing small tests, but different
methodologies are required for developing full size levels.
 Once a level has been completed, entities (monsters, items, etc) can be moved

or changed without reprocessing the entire level by running qbsp with the
-onlyents parameter.  This does not work for doors, triggers, etc that are
composed of brushes.  One of these days I will get around to coding that...
