 this takes the .prt file generated by qbsp, along with the .bsp file, and
generates a compressed bit array of the potentially visible set of each leaf.
This can take a very long time, depending on the input data.  The time is
related to the number of portals off of each leaf.  A simple wolfenstein like
level would have leafs with an average of only two portals from each leaf, and
would vis very fast.  The worst case for vising would be a stadium environment,
where you have a huge area with lots of things sticking out of the ground but
not contacting other major occluders.  A single large room like that can take
more time to process than an entire level made up of more densly occluded areas.
