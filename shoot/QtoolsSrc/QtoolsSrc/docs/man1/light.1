 this takes the .bsp file generated by qbsp and does light casting from all of
the light objects in the map.  Normally, it takes one light sample for each
lightmap point, but the "-extra" parameter causes it to take four samples (and
four times as long to run) and average them.  The lighting model used has little
theoretical grounding (it has linear fallof, for instance), it was just tweaked
until it looked good.
