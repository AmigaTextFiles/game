What's New

First release  (1-NOV-96)

Changes / Additions:

1)
now new keys can be used to specify light entities' direction and fading.

** key "mangle" specifies light entities' direction. key must have 3 values.
  first value is "yaw" angle (degrees), second - "pich" angle, third - not used.
  dont mix with intermission camera's key "mangle" which specifies X, Y, Z of
  point where the intermission camera looks at.

  example:
  {
  "classname"	"light"
  "origin"	"384 192 256"
  "light"	"600"
  "mangle"	"90 -45 0"
  }

** key "wait" specifies light entities light fading. key must have 1 value.
  lower value makes light fade slower.
  actualy does the same that commandline parameter "-dist" but
  only for entities that have this key. commandline parameter "-dist"
  still works.

  example:
  {
  "classname"	"light"
  "origin"	"384 192 256"
  "light"	"600"
  "wait"	".5"
  }
