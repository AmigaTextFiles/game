Extrinsic Dawn came about from a program I downloaded called QMAP 
by Sean Barrett. 

Sean Barrett<buzzard@world.std.com>. - original code
Jawed Karim <jawed@tc.umn.edu>. - DJGPP port

The original programs along with the original source can be found at

http://www.goecities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/788.qmap.htm

New stuff added since last release.
	Got the texture mapping and lighting all working
	Can use any map now and start at the real info_player_start
	Fixed some other math problems I was having.

I still have some work to do to this to speed it up, I have
ben so involved in finding a bug in it I havent worried about
its speed much.  Now thats its found and taken care of I am going
to add a s-buffer renderer which will cut down on all the massive
overdraw that is occuring, plan on putting some major functions, ie
texture mapping, into assemvly for speed purposes.

Well a little about the program.  I sped it up a lot by reducing the 
amount of 3d math and make it cruise through the bsp tree.  I also
added some minor collision detection but haven’t had time to perfect
it due me learning VESA coding.  
So any other questions can be sent to:  benco@gisco.net

People to thank:
1. Dj Delorie - for making DJGPP
2. id Software - ingenious of the bsp file structure
3. Sean Barrett - making QMAP and help with traversing the bsp tree
4. Jawed Karim - saving me time by porting QMAP to DJGPP
5. Martynas Kunigelis - for his free keyboard driver
6. David Charlton - for his help to start with
7. All People on irc.efnet.net - #gamecode
