this is a source-dump of my QuakeTools project. it is an entry to a
greater project of documenting quakes ans quakeIIs file-internals and
a library to create, modify and show all of their files.

take a look in the doc-dir.

NOTE: nearly 90% of the code is strict ANSI-C, the rest of 10%
      are 3 nested functions, and some trigraphs flowing around.

people who wants to give their pennies to this project are welcome.

 current features in short:

        read/writes picture formats:
        
         ppm/pgm/png/jpg
        
        read/writes 3d formats:
        
         tddd/3DS
         
        read/writes quake formats:
        
         wad/(bsp/vis/lit/prt/h?/map)/pak/(qc/dat)/mip/lmp
         
        read only quake formats:
        
         bsps of quakeII
        
        others:
        
         can compress wads
         can do fs-dithering
         can do smoothing
         uses high quality mipmap-scaling
         build in script-system with recursion-capabilities
         can load pictures directly into bsps
         uses less memory
         error robust
         can parse entire directories and perform the default actions to every file
          and subdirectory
         can extract bsp/pak recursively

	display:
	
	 animateable lights
	 possiblity to visualise the process of qbsp and light
	 transparent water
	 splitted in system-independend and system-dependend parts
	 rudimenal game-capabilities
	 wire/flat/8bit/16bit/24bit/32bit graphics-driver
	 multiple displays

	executables:
	
	 qbsp		(replacement, mid-level)
	 light		(replacement, mid-level)
	 rad		(replacement, mid-level)
	 vis		(replacement, mid-level)
	 qview		(replacement, mid-level)
	 ppmdiff	(low-level)
	 qcc		(replacement, mid-level)
	 qtools		(superior to all mid-level programs, high-level)

NOTE: some of these features exists only rudimental and are not really
      functional

NOTE: i really need feedback!! up to now i got only one bugreport (non-crashing)
      and one comment of a linux-user.
      the optimal case is if an amiga-clan (AmigaMercenaries, GoiGoi ...) or one
      of the unix-clans (linux and irix) adopt the whole project for excessive
      testing.

REQUEST: if there is someone out there who can program the parts for a X-display
	 you are welcome to put your creative minds into this project.

CONFUSED: i've send a message to the authors of the linux/amiga-port of quest
	  but didn't recieve an answer. i propose to join great parts of the
	  quest- and qtools-project.
