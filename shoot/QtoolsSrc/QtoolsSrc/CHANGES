	Version 0.0:

	 most of the code works, means:
	  graphic-conversions (Load/SaveImage)
	  bsp-building (qbsp)
	  vis-calculation (vis)
	  map-conversion (Load/SaveMAPFile/LoadBSPFile)
	  wads (Add/ExtractWAD2)
	  paks (Add/ExtractPAK)
	  mipmaps
	  quakec (qcc/unqcc)
	 problems exists with:
	  light-calculation (untested, maybe it works)
	  tddd-save (Imagine can't load it, but every other program I have)
	  tddd-load (last version was okay, new version untested)
	 exists only in scrabboard
	  rad (radiosity from quakeII converted to quakeI)
	  transparency (generation of transparency-tables, for what ever ...)
