Ideas for future development:

  - Add speed control.

  - Add manual fire mode.

  - Add new ways to "boost" the player when a question mark is shot
    in an "extended mode" game.

  - In later levels, big spinners could sometimes break off into
    two small ones.

  - Add sound effects for the spinners and for the cadence, as in the
    original Astrosmash.
