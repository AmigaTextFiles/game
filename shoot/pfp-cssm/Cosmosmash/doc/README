Cosmosmash - A clone of the Intellivision(TM) game Astrosmash(TM).

Copyright (C) 2000-2004 Pierre Sarrazin <http://sarrazip.com/>
This program is free software distributed under the GNU GPL.
See the file COPYING.


The program requires my `flatzebra' library (version 4.1) and the
Simple DirectMedia Layer multimedia library, version 1.2.0 or later
(see http://www.libsdl.org/).  Links to both are offered on the
Cosmosmash Home Page at

    http://sarrazip.com/dev/cosmosmash.html

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.  Assuming that
`flatzebra' has been installed under /usr or /usr/local, the typical
procedure is

    ./configure
    make
    make install

This package provides a manual page: cosmosmash.6

The canonical spelling is "Cosmosmash", not "CosmoSmash", even
though there is a C++ class in the code called CosmoSmashEngine...
