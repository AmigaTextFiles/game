THE BATTLEFIELD - The battlefield screen is a Pseudo 3-D view
of a battlefield, The enemy is at the top far away and you are at
the bottom. The DEPLOY EQUIPMENT window has your equipment. From
left to right SURFACE TO SURFACE MISSLES (3)- SURFACE TO AIR
MISSLE (1) - RADAR (1) - COMMAND AND CONTROL (1)

DEPLOY EQUIPMENT  - Use the mouse to select a piece by placing the
crosshair over the piece you want to move then click the left mouse
button. The piece will disappear. Move the crosshair to where you
want to place the piece and click the left button of the mouse. You
won't be able to place the pieces outside of the playfield,and you
won't be able to place the piece too close to another piece.

START THE GAME - When the last piece is on the play field the game
has begun, so be ready!

LAUNCHING SURFACE TO SURFACE MISSLES - Select the missle by using
the F1,F2,F3 keys.(F1=missle1,F2=missle2,F3=missle3) Then place the
crosshair in the enemy battlefield and press the left mouse button
to launch the missle. If you have the crosshair in the blue sky, the
missle will fall to the ground below that point. When the missle is
launched it will fly out of view at the top of the screen,then a few
seconds later you will see a small warhead fall over the enemy
battlefield. Your enemy has SURFACE TO AIR missles and he may shoot
your missle down. If you see your missle explode in the air you will
know he got it with his missle.

LAUNCHING SURFACE TO AIR MISSLE - Select the SAM by pressing the
SPACE BAR then select the target using the crosshair, and press the
left mouse button. NOTE - the SAM will not launch below the enemy's
front line. You will have to lead your target a little to hit it.
As an option the ESC key is assigned to select the SAM missle.
Your RADAR unit helps you aim the missle. If your enemy destroys
your RADAR unit you will have to aim a little better to hit your
target. NOTE should your SAM launcher get destroyed, it will be
repaired after a period of time, or you can elect to convert one
of your other launchers to a SAM site using the 1,2,3 keys on the
keypad. Press 1 on the keypad to replace launcher 1 with a SAM.
Strategy is important here. It's up to you.

YOUR AWACS - The panel in the lower left is your AWACS. The sections
will turn orange when your enemy launches a missle. The sections
represent a map of your enemy's battlefield. If the pannel in the
upper left turns orange,your enemy launched a missle from the back
left side of the battlefield. When you launch a missle at the enemy
you may notice one of the AWACS panels turn orange then grey,like a
flash. This indicates he launched his SURFACE TO AIR missle to shoot
your missle down. To get a more precise location of the enemy launch
sites, use the F4 key to send your plane over his battlefield. When
he launches a missle a small orange dot appears to let you see his
launch sites. CAUTION CAUTION!!! if you leave your AWACS over his
battlefield too long he will shoot it down!!!!!!!. Use the F5 key
to bring your AWACS back to a safe distance. The only time you dont
have to worry about getting shot down is if you destroy his SURFACE
TO AIR launcher. See the section STATUS to find out what he has
activated. Should your AWACS get destroyed, be patient it will be
repaired after a period of time.

ENEMY AWACS - During the battle you will see an airplane in the sky
to the left or the right. This is your enemy AWACS. If you are launching
a SURFACE TO SURFACE missle when this AWACS plane is in view,your
enemy will have the location of the missle you launch, he will come
after it,so be ready he doesn't miss!!! Use your SURFACE TO AIR
MISSLE to shoot down his AWACS.

RADAR - The RADAR panel in the bottom center will show you an orange
bar after the enemy launches a missle. This bar is in a relative
position to where the inbound missle is going to come down. If the
bar is on the left side of the pannel then the missle will come down
on the left side of the battlefield. If an enemy missle hits your
RADAR truck the radar glass will shatter and you will lose inbound
reports,and your SURFACE TO AIR missle will be less accurate.

STATUS - This pannel lets you know what your enemy has active.
When your missles hit one of his pieces of equipment the piece that
you hit will be removed from the status window.

NOTE ON THE MISSLES - The SURFACE TO AIR missles can't hit anything
in your enemy's battlefield. The SURFACE TO SURFACE missle can't
be used to hit an enemy inbound missle. DON'T GET CONFUSED!!!

ENDING THE BATTLE - Your COMMAND AND CONTROL HEADQUARTERS is what
you are trying to protect! If an enemy missle hits it the battle
is over!! Also if you lose all your SURFACE TO SURFACE missles, the
battle is over!! At the end a message will appear to let you know
if you WIN or LOSE,then you will go to the startup screen to see
your score.


NOTES ON YOUR ENEMY - HINTS

1. The kill ratio on his SAM is about 75%. If you destroy his
   RADAR unit this falls to 50%.

2. You destroy his SAM site and he can't shoot at your AWACS. When
   you see you have destroyed his sam hit the F4 key to get your
   AWACS down range.

3. Take a defensive posture at first. Concentrate on shooting the
   inbound missles. Try to get a shot at his AWACS plane. After you
   see his AWACS fly by then launch your SURFACE TO SURFACE MISSLES.

4. You shoot down his AWACS plane and he can't detect your launch
   sites, so launch at will.

5. Use your AWACS for short periods of time just to see one launch
   site then concentrate on it.

6. Try to get his SURFACE TO AIR MISSLE first, then you can concentrate
   on his launch sites.
