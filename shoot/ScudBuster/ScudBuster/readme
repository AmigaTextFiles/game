This demo version has been tested on a stock Amiga under Workbench
version 1.3 and 2.0. I haven't had the chance to run it on a fast
processor, however v.9 will be tested on an 030. If you register
by sending $20.00, I will send you all the upgrades to release 1.0
for free. We are working on getting real time graphics over a modem
at 300 baud, and as always trying to make the graphics more involved.
Please report all bugs and I will fix them before the next version
is released. The highest score for 7 battles is 960 so far at level
5. A line in the sand has been drawn!!! Thank you for your support.
