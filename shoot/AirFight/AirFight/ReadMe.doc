                             (c) 1995-98 by Qualis

  This is a simple shoot game for two players(recommended) or one player.
Two players mode is recommended because algorithm for computer plane is very
simple,so is relative easy to shoot him down...

  Game should work on any model of Amiga with 1 meg. memory.

 New features in version 1.5:
 
 - remove big bug in two player mode...
 - keyboard control (you can use now joystick and keyboard both or separate)
 - precision control (you can control delay of planes respond)
 - new planes control,that same how is in original game.

 And what is new in 2.0:

 - speed control of planes.
 - some optimalization...
 - improved resolution change.

  Control:
  Player 1 - joystick in port one. 
  Fire                  - Fire  
  Left,Right            - Left, Right :))
