Our first real gameproject on the legendary Amiga500. This game was technically perfect. It had smooth scrolling, nice sprite animations, palette-jumps and good allround effects. This game was never finished by us due to the falldown of Commodore/Amiga and its gamemarket. So, our team stopped their work on it forever :-(

But try out the demoversion.
