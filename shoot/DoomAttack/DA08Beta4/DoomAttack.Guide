DoomAttack is another port of Doom for the Amiga. Creating an Amiga version
was very easy, because ID Software have released the original source code as
public domain and therefore it's also 100% legal.

@{B}@{U}What's so special about *this* version:@{UB}@{UU}

o Several routines have been rewritten in assembler

o The game is running fast even on my AGA 68030/50 68882/50 and will fly
  on 68040 + GFX-Board. I'm not so sure about the 68060 version because
  if was created "by hand". Programs such as "CyberPatcher" or "OxyPatcher"
  might increase the speed of this version.

o The low detail mode routines (2 x 1) were fixed and the game is @{B}very@{UB}
  playable in full screen on a 68030/50 machine

o You can use Keyboard, Mouse and Joystick

o You can make a IFF screenshot from inside the game.

o Three versions: one for 68030, one for 68040 and one for 68060.

o Multiplayer game is now supported through a plugin. Actually there is a
  Net_TCP plugin (for playing on the Internet) and a so called Net_Local
  plugin for doing a two player game on one computer (not really playable,
  it was only created to test my network plugin interface).

o Music is now supported through a plugin. Actually there is Music_P61A
  plugin which plays P61A mods (ProTracker mods can be converted to this
  format).

o There's a cool prefs program. No more need to edit ".doomrc" with an
  editor.
  
o There are some improvements to the game itself, such as the advanced map
  features.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Requirements" "System Requirements"
@TOC "MAIN"

o Amiga OS 3.0

o 68020 - FPU is @{B}not@{UB} required
  
o Some fast memory. DoomAttack has been reported to work on a machine with
  only 2 MB fast memory, but it's better if you have 4 or 8 MB.
  
o AGA or GfxBoard

o There are three versions of the executable. One compiled for computers with
  68030, one for 68040 machines and one for computers with 68060, which I
  hope should not contain any of the commands that on this CPU have to be
  emulated (I had to do this by hand, as GCC (or at least the version I'm
  using) does not have a 'm68060' switch.

In order to use DoomAttack you first of all need a WAD file. I have only
tested DoomAttack with a Shareware WAD (you can get one from the ID Software
Web site: @{B}http://www.idsoftware.com@{UB}), that's one with the suffix ".wad".
Anyway it will probably work with registered and commercial WAD files, too.

For being able to use custom WAD you need a registered/commercial WAD, too!


@{B}@{U}Tip for italian users (and others, too!?):@{UB}@{UU}

There's a PC Doom Demo archive in many of the CDs of Enigma Amiga Run. Just
have a look at the "ONLYPC" directory. There you should find a file called
"doom1_2.zip". There's a unzip utility for the Amiga on Aminet: "util/arc/
Unzip512x.lha". Simply type: "unzip doom1_2.zip" and the archive will be
extracted to the current directory. After unzipping you will find several
files in the current directory, "DOOM1_2S.1" and "DOOM1_2_S.2" are the ones
containing the WAD file. The format of the two files seems to be ICE, but
inside there is a normal LHA file, therefore you can extract it diretly with
the Amiga. As the ICE file is split you first have to join the two parts
together: "join DOOM1_2S.1 DOOM1_2S.2 to DOOM.LHA". After that you can use
lha: "lha x DOOM.LHA". The warning "skipping extraneous/corrupt data" can be
ignored.

@NODE "Installation" "Installation"
@TOC "MAIN"

Use the installation script!!!! If you do not, there are some things you
have to know:
@{FG SHINE}____________________________________________________________________________@{FG TEXT}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

o Copy the right executable to the directory containing the WAD file. 

o The old chunky2planar routine cannot be used anymore. Delete it. Delete
  also the "c2p" directory (unless it's used by another Doom port, of
  course).

o Create a directory called "DoomAttackSupport" in the Doom directory.
  Copy the new "c2p" and "plugin" directories (!) there.

o DoomAttack needs to have the environment variable DOOMHOME (not HOME!
  I have changed this) set to the directory of Doom.

o Delete the ".doomrc" (settings) file in the Doom directory and configure
  DoomAttack with DoomAttackPrefs. If you are using other ports of Doom
  you can force DoomAttack to use another config file with the "-config"
  Shell option. In this case you don't need to delete the ".doomrc" file,
  but watch out: DoomAttackPrefs is usually saving/loading "PROGDIR:.doomrc"
  or ".doomrc" in the DOOMHOME directory (if the DOOMHOME env variable was
  found). Set the tooltype "CONFIGFILE" in the DoomAttackPrefs icon to avoid
  problems with other Doom ports (DoomAttack saves some additional stuff to
  the settings file ...)


o If you are going to use the P61A music plugin copy the file ".musicrc"
  to the Doom directory.

o The scripts have been changed a little bit and need two small utilites
  to be in C: "getbuffers" and "setbuffers". Read on!

o In order to speed up disk loading use "AddBuffers <disk:> <buffers>".
  One buffer is about 500 bytes. I suggest you to use a value between
  100 and 500, for example: "AddBuffers WORK: 200" will add 200 additional
  buffers to the drive WORK: In the "c" directory of the archive there are
  two small programs (SetBuffers/GetBuffers) which can be used instead of
  AddBuffers:
   
     - @{FG SHINE}SetBuffers <DRIVE> <BUFFERS>@{FG TEXT} will set the number of buffers of the
       <DRIVE> to <BUFFERS>. (AddBuffers would add the specified buffers)

     - @{FG SHINE}GetBuffers <DRIVE>@{FG TEXT} displays the number of buffers of the specified
       <DRIVE> in the shell. The output will only contain the value, no
       "has ?? buffers" string will be used. Therefore it's easier to use
       with the back ticking feature of the shell:
       
		set ActualBuffers `GetBuffers DH0:`

o Note for GFX board users. It might be necessary to specify "-rtg" when
  starting DoomAttack if you want the game to run on a GFX Board screen.
  V0.7 tries to detect a GFX board, but this will only work if your RTG
  system is compatible with CyberGraphX (I'm using IsCyberModeID() to do
  the check).

  Some users told me that the game ran faster on native Amiga screens than
  on GFX Board screens. Someone also said that he had to use a Screen
  promoter utility to get the "real" speed.

It's also possible to start DoomAttack from Workbench by double-clicking the
DoomAttack_ClickMe icon, first, which sets DOOMHOME and increases the
buffers.

Anyway Doom eats a lot of memory and therefore it might be better booting
"with no Startup Sequence". To simplify the starting in this case you can
copy the "DoomAttack_Start" file to S: so that after having booted without
Startup Sequence it will be enough typing "S:DoomAttack_Start" to get the
game running. "DoomAttack_Start" sets the DOOMHOME environment variable, adds
some buffers to "Work:" (change this if the volume containing the Doom files
has another name on your computer!!!!), sets the stack to 50000 and starts
DoomAttack.

You can do this from Workbench, too, by simply double-clicking the Doom-
Attack_BootStart icon and resetting the computer when the requester telling
you to do so, appears. If you are interested in how this work: When you
double-click DoomAttack_BootStart the script with the same name will be
executed. The scripts mounts a small RAD disk (called DoomRAD:) and creates a
startup-sequence for it. The RAD disk has the highest boot priority and
therefore autobooting will happen from there, when you reset the computer.
The startup-sequence created by the script (BTW: to set DoomAttack options
edit the "setenv DOOMOPTIONS" line in this script) sets up some assigns,
starts the monitor drivers, sets the environment variable DOOMHOME, increases
the stack size, kills the small RAD disk and then starts DoomAttack.

@TOC "MAIN"

Use DoomAttackPrefs to configure DoomAttack (it's still possible to edit
the settings files ".doomrc" with an editor). If you are using other Doom
ports, too, you can change the default settings file by using the CONFIGFILE
tooltype/argument. If you do so, you must be sure to start DoomAttack with
"-config <CONFIGFILE>".

Not much to explain here:

o With "Speed A" and "Speed B" you can define two different keys for the
  (single) action "SPEED".
  
o With "Strafe A" and "Strafe B" you can define two different keys for the
  (single) action "STRAFE".

o If you want to use some of the keys that are usually used by the system
  for mouse emulation (LAMIGA, RAMIGA) you have to set the option "Full
  keyboard control" in the "Program" page (this can be dangerous - see the
  note near the "Full keyboard control" explainings)

o If you are using a french keyboard where you have to hold down shift to
  bring up the keys 0-9 you can use the "French keymap patch" in the "Pro-
  gram" page which swaps the shift for these keys. If you do not then
  changing weapons will only be possible with the numeric key pad
  
o The keys <~> (left from the "1" and above "TAB"), </> (numeric pad) and
  <*> (numeric pad) are reserved. Don't use them here!

o Using the mouse can slow down the game a little. Switch the "Use Mouse"
  option off, if you are not going to use it.

o Mouse sensitivity increases from left to right

o Be sure not to set different buttons for each action

o If you are using a commodity that maps one or more keys to a special
  action such as screen cycling you can use the "Full mouse control" option
  in the "Program" page (read the warning there!) to disable this for the
  DoomAttack screen.

o If you want to use a CD32 Joypad change the "Controller Type". If you do
  so you should not change the buttons for the several actions:
  
  	Fire:   Button 1
  	Strafe: Button 2
  	Use:    Button 4
  	Speed:  Button 3

o There's a special entry in the screen mode requester which, if selected,
  forces DoomAttack to pop up a screen mode requester each time you start
  it (An alternative is to hold down one of the SHIFT keys when starting
  DoomAttack, which will have the same effect).

o C2P Routines:  If you don't have a GFX board or want to run DoomAttack on
  a standard Amiga screen mode you have to use a C2P Routine. Try out your-
  self, which is the fastest on your configuration. The Akiko C2P routines
  are for Amigas having this special chip, actually the CD32 and some of the
  upcoming new Amigas. There are two Akiko C2P routines. The only diffrence
  between the two is, that "c2p_akiko" uses OwnBlitter/DisownBlitter to gain
  exclusive use of the chip while "c2p_akiko2" does not do this (c2p stuff
  will be faster, but you might get problems (= graphic errors) if another
  task is using the akiko chip, too.
  
  PS: The installation script copies the C2P routines to a subdirectory
      ("DoomAttackSupport/c2p") in the Doom drawer. Go there to select the
      routine.
      
      The prefs program doesn't check if you select a valid c2p routine.
      This will only be done by DoomAttack when you start it. Watch the
      output in the Shell window. If you see "Working in RTG mode" then
      there was something wrong with the routine (Initialization failed
      or the routine could not be found) -> the program will fall back
      to RTG mode resulting in a very poor performance.

o Music Plugin --> see @{" Music Plugins " LINK "MusicPlugins"}

o Cache Sound FX: Usually DoomAttack loads all sound samples into Chip RAM.
  If you are running DoomAttack from Workbench there might not be enough
  free Chip RAM for all the samples (--> DoomAttack will abort). With this
  option you can force DoomAttack to keep only a few samples in Chip RAM
  while all the others are loaded and kept in Fast RAM (but not in the zone
  memory, BTW).

  the other players during game. This is usally done by pressing 'T' and 
  entering the text. During heavy enemy attacks this might take too much
  time so you can define 10 chat macros which can be activated in the game
  by pressing 'T' and then ALT + 0-9.

o @{B}Full keyboard control:@{UB}

  Activates a special InputHandler that disables the keyboard mouse emu-
  lation on the DoomAttack screen. This makes it possible to use (nearly)
  every key in the "Keys" page. For example you could use LALT to strafe
  left and LAMIGA to strafe right.
  
  @{B}Warning:@{UB} With this option it will be impossible to cycle through the
           screens with LAMIGA + N or LAMIGA + M, unless the game is
           paused or you are in a menu. You might get into a situation
           where a requester wants to pop up (maybe because of disk
           error or something like that) and you cannot switch to the
           Workbench screen because of the game actually not being "paus-
           able" or "menuable". In this case you'll probably have to
           reboot.


o @{B}Full mouse control:@{UB}

  Activates a special InputHandler that allows you to use all mouse buttons
  even if one (or more) of them is usually used by a commodity to do some
  special action such as screen cycling.
  
  @{B}Warning:@{UB} This option can lead to the same problems as "Full keyboard
           control"


o @{B}French keymap patch:@{UB}

  On french keyboards the keys 0-9 need SHIFT to be hold down. Therefore
  changing weapon with these keys will not work in DoomAttack, unless you
  use the numeric keypad. With this option you can tell DoomAttack to re-
  verse (swap) the shift of the keys 0-9, which solves the problem.


o @{B}No range check:@{UB}

  Disables the range checkings in the SpanDraw routines. Keep this enabled
  as the speed increase is very probably not noticeable at all.


o @{B}Cool (rotating) map:@{UB}

  The standard map option of Doom makes orientation sometimes a little bit
  difficult, because of the map being static - it's the player sprite who
  is rotating, but not the map itself. With this option you will get a
  rotating map, while the player sprite (arrow) will always look in the
  same diretion.


o @{B}HUD map transparency:@{UB}

  While the map is active you can change the map type by pressing <P>.
  This will switch the map between being full screen on a separate screen,
  full screen over the 3D game graphics and a small rectangle in different
  positions again over the 3D game graphics.

  If the map type is in "small rectangle" mode the game graphics inside this
  rectangle can either be left untouched ("Full"), cleared to black ("Off
  (Black)") or darkened with a very cool transparency effect ("Level 1" -
  "Level 6"). In my opinion "Level 2" or "Level 3" looks best.
  
  Having the map displayed over the game graphics of course slows the game
  down, especially if you are using one of the map cheats to make it com-
  pletely visible.
  

o @{B}Zone memory:@{UB}

  Size of the so called "Zone area" in KBytes. The default is 6144 (6
  MBytes). You should not go under 2000 KBytes.
  
  When starting DoomAttack the program tries to make sure that <Free FAST
  memory> KBytes will keep being free by reducing the size accordingly.


o @{B}Free FAST memory:@{UB}

  See Zone memory!

DoomAttack starting with 0.7 supports Music and Network play through exter-
nal plugins. The source code of all plugins is included so it should not be
a problem for other coders to create new plugins, maybe a real null modem
option or a Music plugin that sends the midi data directly to some MIDI
equipment through the serial port.

PS: The installation script copies the plugins to a subdirectory ("Doom-
    AttackSupport/Plugin" in the Doom drawer. When using DoomAttackPrefs
    go there to select the plugin (BTW: The prefs program does not check
    if you select a valid plugin. This will only done when you start Doom-
    Attack. Watch the output in the Shell window or use SnoopDos if you
    don't get a certain plugin to work).

Actually there's a P61A MOD player plugin and a special Debug Plugin avail-
able:

@{FG SHINE}____________________________________________________________________________@{FG TEXT}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

@{FG SHINE}P61A:@{FG TEXT}  This plays P61A modules. Protracker MODS can be converted to this
       format with the converter included in the Player61 archive (Aminet:
       mus/play/P6101.lha).

       You can tell the plugin which MODS to play in which situations by
       editing the ".musicrc" file. Simply add the filename of the MOD
       you want to have played in a certain situation to the line containing
       the relative "MusicID". There are a lot of Music IDs and I still
       did not have the time to find out, when each of them is used. There-
       fore you can set a default MOD in the first line which will be used
       if the line of the MusicID DoomAttack intended to play is empty.
      
       Some of the MusicIDs I know:
      
         mus_e1m1 	First episode - First Mission
         mus_e1m2       First episode - Second Mission
         ...
        
         mus_inter	Intermission screen
         mus_intro	Intro

       @{B}Notes:@{UB} - Don't add/delete/insert lines in ".musicrc", otherwise the
                IDs don't match anymore with the correct MODs.
              
              - You don't need to delete the comments(";mus_e1m1", ...) when
                adding the path of a MOD:
              
              		work:music/mods/P61.powermod ;mus_e1m1
              
              - If the filename of a MOD contains one or more spaces you can
                use quotation marks:
                
                	"work:music/mods/P61.power mod" ;mus_e1m1
              
       	      - To find out other MusicIDs you can use the Debug plugin.
      

@{FG SHINE}Debug:@{FG TEXT} Important: If you are using this plugin you must be sure not to use
       the "Full keyboard control" and "Full mouse control" options by
       disabling them in DoomAttackPrefs or by starting DoomAttack with
       the option "-noinputhack".

       Every time DoomAttack wants to start a new song, a requester will
       pop up telling you the relative MusicID.

       
@{FG SHINE}____________________________________________________________________________@{FG TEXT}

@{FG SHINE}Local:@{FG TEXT} This is the plugin I used to test the plugin interface stuff. It
       allows you to do a two player game on one computer. On my computer
       this is not really playable and that's probably true for all machines
       out there. Don't try it unless you really want to use it or you just
       can't believe that it works.
       
       The main problem is that you have to start DoomAttack twice so you
       will need a lot of free fast memory. But it should work with 8 MB.
       Another problem is, that the keyboard will be available only for
       one of the two players, the other one will have to use the Joystick
       or Joypad.

       To have a quick try do follow these steps:
       
       1) Go into DoomAttackPrefs and select a 640 x 400 screenmode (there
          will be two screens, you will have to drag down one of the two
          to make the other visible, later)
       
       2) Activate the Joystick option
       
       3) Activate the plugin (page "Multiplayer")

       4) Save the settings.
       
       5) Open a shell and start the first DoomAttack with:
       
          DoomAttack -zonesize 2000 -nosound -nomusic -nosleep
                     -noinputhack -net 1 Bill
       
       6) Wait until the message "sending network start info" appears
       
       7) Open another shell and start the second DoomAttack with:
       
          DoomAttack -zonesize 2000 -nosound -nomusic -nosleep
                     -noinputhack -net 2 John

       8) Wait until the first screen pops up. There will be a black/grey
          screen for some time, before.
       
       9) Drag the screen down (with LAMIGA + LMB) to make the screen of
          the second player visible
          
      10) You now must find out which player is controlled with the Joy-
          stick. The keyboard can be used only in an active window, so
          if you use CURSOR LEFT/CURSOR RIGHT and then Joystick LEFT,
          Joystick RIGHT and see, that both times the same player was
          turning around, than the wrong window is active. If this is the
          case drive to the other screen with the (invisible) mouse and
          activate it with a mouse click.


       @{B}Very important:@{UB} My computer crashed several times when I was using
                       this plugin. I'm not sure if there's a bug in this
                       plugin or maybe somewhere else, maybe in the music
                       plugin, as I tried it out with the music plugin
                       activated, too.
                       
                       This really isn't much more than a gag!!

You can set them with shell arguments (if you use DoomAttack_Start script
you must edit this file) or with tooltypes (only if you start DoomAttack
from Workbench). The '-' char is part of the option and tooltypes must con-

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

@{FG SHINE}-rtg@{FG TEXT}            IF you want to use a GFX-Board screenmode you have to specify
                this option. If you do so DoomAttack will render the
                framebuffer with either WritePixelArray8 or WriteChunkyPixels
                depending on whether you are running OS3.1 or not.

		Starting with V0.7 of DoomAttack this option should not be
		necessary anymore, at least if you are running a CyberGraphX
		compatible RTG system.


@{FG SHINE}-c2p@{FG TEXT}            Can be used if for some reason the new RTG autodetection rou-
		tine doesn't work correctly and therefore thinks a selected
		native Amiga screenmode is a RTG screen.


@{FG SHINE}-fps@{FG TEXT}            Displays the frames per seconds in the upper left corner of
                the screen.


@{FG SHINE}-rendercontrol@{FG TEXT}  Can be used together with "-fps" to see how fast the
                rendering would be, if there was no need to chunky2planar (or
                copy) from the framebuffer to the screen bitmap. You can
                switch the FrameBuffer-to-Screen routine on and off with CAPS
                LOCK. If CAPS LOCK is on, the screen won't be updated, but
                you will still see the fps (all 3D and game calculations
                will @{B}not@{UB} be disabled!!) .


@{FG SHINE}-nodoublebuffer@{FG TEXT} Switches double-buffering off. Double-buffering does actually
                only work with native screens (i.e. if you don't use the
                "-rtg" option).


@{FG SHINE}-zonesize@{FG TEXT}       By default DoomAttack tries to alloc one block of 6 MByte,
                which will be freed only when you quit Doom. If allocation
                fails, it decreases the size by 50 KByte, again and again,
                until allocation succeds. With -zonesize you can tell
                DoomAttack how many KBytes (!!!!! not MBytes) it shall try to
                alloc first. You should not go under 2000 KByte, although I'm
                not quite sure as this probably depends on the WAD file.

		This option ovverides the relative setting in ".doomrc"


@{FG SHINE}-freefast@{FG TEXT}       DoomAttack tries to leave <freefast> KBytes FAST memory free
		when allocating the "Zone area".

		This option overrides the relative setting in ".doomrc"


@{FG SHINE}-displayid@{FG TEXT}      Supply the (numeric) id of the screenmode you want to use.
                You can specify it in hexadecimal format. For example
                "0x21000" would be PAL:Lowres.

		This option ovverides the relative setting in ".doomrc"


@{FG SHINE}-c2proutine@{FG TEXT}     Specify an alternative chunky2planar routine. By default
                DoomAttack tries to load "PROGDIR:DoomAttackSupport/c2p/c2p"
                and if this file doesn't exist it falls back to RTG mode.

		This option ovverides the relative setting in ".doomrc"


@{FG SHINE}-forcedemo@{FG TEXT}      Forces to run the demo even if it "is from another game"


@{FG SHINE}-norangecheck@{FG TEXT}   There are some bugs in the rendering engine (= in the
                original source code) which sometimes can make it try to
                render outside the framebuffer (=> can cause crash).
                Therefore by default there are range checks in the routines
                to avoid this. This might slow down overall speed a little
                bit. With this option you can replace the render routines
                with faster ones not containing the mentioned range checks,
                at your own risk!! There will probably be only a very small
                speed increase, therefore I think it's better not using this
                option!


@{FG SHINE}-cachesound@{FG TEXT}     Cache sound effects = keep only a few of them in chip memory.

		This option overrides the relative setting in ".doomrc"


@{FG SHINE}-nosound@{FG TEXT}        Disable sound effects.


@{FG SHINE}-nomusic@{FG TEXT}        Tells DoomAttack not to use the music plugin.


@{FG SHINE}-coolmap@{FG TEXT}        You will get a rotating map, which makes orientation a lot
                easier.
                
		This option ovverides the relative setting in ".doomrc"


@{FG SHINE}-joypad@{FG TEXT}         Allows you to use a CD32 Joypad. The routines are based
                completely on ADoom from Peter McGavin and have not been
                tested!
                
		This option ovverides the relative setting in ".doomrc"


@{FG SHINE}-joyport@{FG TEXT}        The port to be used for the Joystick/Joypad. Specify 0 for
		the mouse port and 1 for the joystick port.

		This option ovverides the relative setting in ".doomrc"

                
@{FG SHINE}-config@{FG TEXT}         Use a custom configuration file instead of ".doomrc" in the
		DOOMHOME directory. For example: -config ram:myconfig


@{FG SHINE}-file@{FG TEXT}           Must be used if you want to play a custom WAD (which re-
		quires a registered/commerical WAD to be present, too). For
		example: -file SUPER.WAD


@{FG SHINE}-nosleep@{FG TEXT}        Usually DoomAttack automatically goes sleeping if you activate
		another window (it's CPU usage will go to 0). This will not
		work if you are trying to start DoomAttack twice (to use
		it with the DANet_Local plugin = two player on one computer
		game). At least one of the two has to be started with
		"-nosleep"


@{FG SHINE}-noinputhack@{FG TEXT}    Disables the InputHandler used for the "Full keyboard control"
		and "Full mouse control" options in ".doomrc". The relative
		option will therefore not be available.

@{B}Known bugs:@{UB}

o When making a screenshot with SHIFT + ` (which pops up a File Requester)
  you must press SHIFT once more, when the game screen reappears. This is
  because the program got the SHIFT DOWN event, but no SHIFT UP event, be-
  cause of the DoomAttack window not being active (the ASL requester window
  will be the active one) anymore when you release the keys. If you do not
  press SHIFT again, then the program thinks that the key has never been re-
  leased which usually (if you don't have changed the key settings with
  DoomAttackPrefs) makes it think you want to run (SPEED on).

o The program might still crash at exit. I'm not 100 % certain but I think
  that it only happens with the DAMusic_P61A and/or DANet_Local plugin
  activated. The original P61 player routines had some bugs in causing En-
  forcer Hits and writes to "foreign" memory. Maybe there are still some
  bugs in.

o If the program dead locks, then you very probably have activated the "Full
  keyboard control" and/or "Full mouse control" options. Read the warning
  about this stuff in @{" Configuration " LINK "Configuration"}

Thanks fly to:

o Lorens Johansson for writing the AmigaGuide documentation. I had to
  change it a little bit, as it contained some V40 commands.

o Peter Mc Gavin for including the source code in ADoom. Several parts of
  DoomAttack are based on ADoom. For example the Network plugin and the joy-
  pad routines (from Gabriele Greco)
  
o Aki M Laukkanen for the permission to use his ultra fast draw routines
  which are used in ADoom, too, BTW.

o Gregers Jacobsen for the DOpus Doom Filetype.

o Petri Savolainen for sending me C2P and P61A routines.

o Piotr Pawlow for sending me C2P routines

o Jarno Paananen for creating the Player61A - a very fast MOD player.

o Jyrki O Saarinen for his information about the 68060.

o Craig Howard for doing a DoomAttack startup picture for me.

o All the others, which sent me C2P routines, info about GFX Board coding,

@NODE "History" "History"
@TOC "Main"
V 0.7: - Had to redo all the 68060 stuff, because I had replaced the wrong
         CPU instructions. Arrrrgh!!

       - Added network support through a plugin. Actually there is a TCP
         (Internet) plugin and a Local plugin (two player game on one com-
         puter - not really playable).
       
       - Added music support through a plugin. Actually there is a P61A
         mod player plugin. ProTracker mods can be converted to this format
         with the converter program contained in the Player61A archive
         (Aminet: mus/play/P6101.lha)

       - Added "full keyboard control" and "full mouse control" options
       
       - Prefs program. It's even animated!
       
       - Created several other C2P modules for differenct machines
       
       - Improved map feature again. It can now be displayed on the HUD
         (over the game graphics), with different positions/sizes and
         a very cool transparency effect.
       
       - Many bug fixes
       
       - RTG screen modes should now be detected automatically
       
       - Added some cheat options (max. ammo, max. armor, max. health, ...)
       
       - Added french keyboard patch

       - Only very few new routines have been converted to assembly. I did
         not have the time for that. The speed increase in this version is
         mainly caused by the new C2P routines and the draw rouines from
         Aki M Laukkanen.


V 0.6: - Fixed several bugs. Might not crash anymore at exit, but don't count on it!!

       - Added "-joypad" option. The routines are completely based on the ones from
         ADoom (Thanks to Peter McGavin for having included the source code :) The
         routines have not been tested.
         
       - Added "-coolmap" option. You will get a rotating map!! I think orientation
         is much easier, then. Has still some problems when the grid is activated,
         but who is this using, anyway.
         
       - I thought "divul.l" and "divsl.l" did not exist in both the 68040 and 68060.
         But unfortunately (or not) only the 68060 does not have them, so the version
         of GCC I'm using generates a lot of them with the "-m68040" option making
         DoomAttack very slow on 68060 systems. Since my GCC does not have a "-m68060"
         option (is there any out having it?) I decided to do a 68060 version by
         hand by adding hundreds of #ifdef, #endifs. I'm not sure if the 68060 version
         is now really "divul.l" and "divsl.l" free, so let me know if it's working
         faster now. BTW: Is there a program with which this can be tested (on a
         68060 machine of course)?
       
       - Improved the FPS display.

@NODE "FINAL" "FINAL NOTES"
@TOC "MAIN"

o Special note for 68060 users: If you think you have found a bug, then try
  first with the 68020 or 68040 version, to see, if the bug is present in
  this versions, too. The 68060 version is a little bit special as I had to
  do it by hand (conditional compiling: lots of #ifdef mc68060 ... #endif)
  and so it might well be that I have made some errors (doing the 68060
  stuff was very annoying ...)

o The game from time to time crashes at exit. There seem to be a lot of bugs
  in the original source code. I have fixed some but there are still crashes.
  Reboot your computer after quitting DoomAttack. I don't take any
  responsibility for any damage that occures. You have been warned!!!
  
o The FPS display ("-fps" option) slows down the game a little bit.

o Native Amiga screenmodes with 30 kHz slow down the game a little bit. If
  possible use a normal 15 kHz mode.

o I have removed the checks for divison by zero in many places, where I think
  they are not necessary. Anyway I was not always 100% sure, so if you get a
  80000005 GURU let me know! I have been reported by several users that V0.5
  indeed produced divide by zero expections. Therefore I have re-written the
  division by zero checks in some places. If you still get GURUS with this
  version let me know and don't forget to specify in which occasion the GURU
  happened. I have also attached a small utility called Div0Killer, which
  prevents software failures to appear if a division by zero occures. You can
  start it somewhere in the startup-sequence with "run <>NIL: Div0Killer".
  
  You can find "Div0Killer" in the "Tools" directory. It has no icon so
  select "View all icons" from the Workbench menu.
  
  @{B}WARNING:@{UB} The usage of Div0Killer might result in unexpected behaviour, not
           only of DoomAttack, but of other programs too, if they make a
           division by zero and continue their work, just like if nothing had
           happened. Avoid it's usage if possible!
