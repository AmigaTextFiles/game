@{b}@{u}Background@{ub}@{uu} 
We started this projekt in the summer 1994 for upload something we have did
itself to AmiNET. We took a camera and film a lots fo pictures to this game.
Because we isn't so good programmers we use AMOS... When we have done 3 level
all of us was to tired to finish all the other... like intro, main-meny,
hiscore, docs, install and so on... But this autumn I (Daniel Widerström) and
Henrik Gustafson have done the must of this. It is only we and Mikael Johansson
who have the Amiga left so we may finish it.

We wish you a lot of fun with BloodBath  ;-)

@{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}
This is a game we have stealed the idea from BloodBath to the MAC. It's a
simply game shoot they (we ;-) ) before they shoot you. It reminds of
"Operation Wolf", a old game from 88 or so... But the screen doesn't scroll
instead the "enemy" came back and would shoot you again. There is 3 level
with raiser difficult level.

If there are still problems, you find a bug, you want to make some suggestions
or what ever, write or mail to one of the @{"addresses" link "authors"}.

If you don't have email you can use FidoNET.

Nothing happens but we want to know how many are useing it.

It's very easy, @{"fill out" system "c:ed Registration_form"} the @{"registration form" link "registrationform"}.
Then send it with email to one of the @{"authors" link "authors"}.
