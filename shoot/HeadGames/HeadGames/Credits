   Well this is it, the entire game as it stands right now, not particularly
awe-inspiring but amusing nonetheless.  (or is that 3 words?)
   Before you go blasting the enemy you need to make sure that the files
named Headgames.all and Headgames2 are in a DIR called Edit_files...
   One more time>>>VV

   Edit_files/Headgames.ALL
              Headgames2

   Once that is done, RENAME Headgames2 to Headgames.  (the problem being
that there are two files with the same name, causes a problem without a
structured directory!  If it messes up, just unarc it again more carefully!)

   Obviously the thing was done with SEUCK game constructor, allowing even
the most programming-retarded computer owner to make some interesting and
amusing games...  Drop me a line and tell me how you loved/hated the
thing...  Please!  It'll do me good to hear some feedback on this time
waster!   drop e-mail to N.SORENSON... thanks and happy hunting!
