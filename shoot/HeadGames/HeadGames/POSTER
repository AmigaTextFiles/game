   Well this is it, the entire game as it stands right now, not particularly
awe-inspiring but amusing nonetheless.  (or is that 3 words?)
   Before you go blasting the enemy you need to make sure that the files
named Headgames.all and Headgames2 are in a DIR called Edit_files...
   One more time>>>VV

   Edit_files/Headgames.ALL
              Headgames2

   Once that is done, RENAME Headgames2 to Headgames.  (the problem being
that there are two files with the same name, causes a problem without a
structured directory!  If it messes up, just unarc it again more carefully!)

[note: if you extract with a recent version of LHARC or LZ, the above
renaming is not necessary as subdirs will be built automatically after
extracing.  Dump your old version of LHARC and get the newest one!]

   Obviously the thing was done with SEUCK game constructor, allowing even
the most programming-retarded computer owner to make some interesting and
amusing games...  Drop me a line and tell me how you loved/hated the
thing...  Please!  It'll do me good to hear some feedback on this time
waster!   drop e-mail to N.SORENSON... thanks and happy hunting!

This game features digitized heads as enemies.

[unfortunately, the archive containing this file has no email path
for Neil Sorenson... if it was in his original documentation, someone
"along the line" deleted it.]

Joystick required.
