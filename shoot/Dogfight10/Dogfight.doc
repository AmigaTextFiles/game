				Dogfight V1.0
				~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Written using AMOS by Richard Ling, April 1990.

  Welcome to France, 1916. In those days, The life expectancy of young pilots
like you was said to be about twenty minutes. In this game, twenty seconds is
a more usual lifespan!
  You and a friend are the top aces of your time - the pride of the British
and German air forces. In this game, there is no real purpose to life other
than hearing the expiring whimper of the other player.
  You will need a joystick in both ports for this game. Player 1 (the British
plane) uses the stick in port 1, player 2 (the German plane) uses the stick
in port 0 (the mouse port).
				Options
				~~~~~~~
  After the game loads and unpacks, you will be presented with the intro
screen, where you can select the game options using the joystick in port 1.
  The first of the options is automatic or manual throttle. Automatic is
best for beginning players.
  The second is limited or unlimited bombs. If limited bombs is chosen, each
plane carries only two bombs.

			     Information panel
			     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Now the game screen comes up, showing a side view of two planes sitting on
runways. Initially, player 1's plane is shown on the left, and player 2's
plane on the right.
  At the bottom of the screen is the information panel. Player 1's score is
at the left, and player 2's score at the right. Underneath each score are two
bomb icons, showing that each plane is carrying two bombs. If you have stereo
sound connected to your computer, all sound effects for player 1 will come
from the left speaker, and all sound effects for player 2 will come from the
right speaker.
  If you picked automatic throttle, the planes will now accelerate down the
runway. otherwise, you will have to press forward on the joystick to
accelerate.
				Controls
				~~~~~~~~
  There are only five simple controls in Dogfight. Pressing forward on the
stick will accelerate. In auto mode, this is done for you, which makes it
harder to stall.
  Moving the stick left will make your plane turn anticlockwise; that is, 
player 1's plane (which faces right) will pull up, and player 2's plane
(facing left) will nosedive.
  Moving the stick right will turn your plane clockwise; that is, player 1's
plane will nosedive, and the player 2's plane will pull up. (The easiest way
to see how this works is to load the game and try it.)
  Pressing the fire button will fire the plane's gun. Hold the button down
for rapid fire.
  Finally, pulling back on the stick will drop a bomb (provided you are
carrying any).
				Takeoff
				~~~~~~~
  An extremely annoying tree growing at the end of each runway makes taking
off difficult. For a successful takeoff, you must lift off in time to clear
the tree, but not so early that you stall the plane.
  When you are about half way along the runway, lift your nose up just a
fraction. (The British player needs to tap the joystick quickly to the left,
the German player to the right.) If the plane loses power and falls to the
ground, you pulled up too early or raised the nose to far. If the plane clips
the top of the tree and crashes, you pulled up too late. (And if it just
explodes on the runway, you moved the stick to the wrong side!) With trial
and error, you will soon find the takeoff easy.
  The simplest way to take off is to accelerate right to the end of the
runway. Just before the tree, loop around until you are flying upside down.
Then when you have more speed, loop around the other way until you are the
right way up again.
				Stalling
				~~~~~~~~
  Your plane will lose speed if your throttle is off, or if you fly up at a
steep angle. If you lose too much speed, your plane will fall out of the sky.
By listening to the tone of your engine, you will get to know when your plane
is about to stall. In this case, point your nose down to speed up again. If
you do stall, point straight down, push forward and "head for the deck" to
get up as much speed as you can, then pull out of the dive right at the last
moment - you may be able to recover from the stall if you were high up.

			      The Battlefield
			      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The two runways are a fairly long way apart, separated by fields and a wide
river. At each end of the battlefield is a tall cliff. Flying into a cliff,
the river or the ground will destroy your plane. If you fly over the top of
one of the cliffs, you come out at the other side. Also, when flying at low
altitude, remember to look out for the two trees. Flying into the top of the
screen will stall your plane.

				Bombing
				~~~~~~~
  Each plane is normally fitted with two bombs. When one is dropped, a bomb
icon disappears from the info screen at the bottom. These bombs are not
replenished until you get a new plane.
  When a bomb is dropped, it will have the same horizontal velocity as your
plane. If you are flying level, the bomb will fly forwards as it drops, so
you will need to drop the bomb before you get over the target.
  Alternatively you can dive-bomb, by facing straight down above the target,
releasing the bomb, then pulling out of the dive. Since you are not moving
sideways at the time of release, the bomb falls straight down.

				Scoring
				~~~~~~~
  Besides the enemy plane, there are other targets around. Each player has
a hangar next to their runway; zeppelins periodically appear in the sky; and
submarines sometimes surface in the river.
  Hitting any enemy target will increase your score. Shooting down the enemy
plane scores a point, and destroying the enemy hangar or an enemy zeppelin or
sub scores you two points. If you crash your plane, the enemy will score a
point, and if you destroy your own hangar, zeppelin or sub, this gives the
enemy two points. Hangars are rebuilt soon after they are destroyed.
  Hangars and submarines can only be destroyed by using bombs, and zeppelins
can only be destroyed by gunfire. The enemy plane can be destroyed by gunfire
in a dogfight, or can be bombed or strafed while on the ground. (you can also
try to bomb the enemy plane in the air if you like!) However, game etiquette
states that a person who repeatedly shoots the other player on the ground
before he can take off is deserving of a punch in the nose.

				Landing

		       Can't be done.

			    The End of the Game
			    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This game will go on indefinitely. The number of planes is unlimited. If
the scores reach 999, they simply reset back to 0. You can exit at any time
by pressing Ctrl-C.
