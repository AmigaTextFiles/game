›[0;1;4mThe story:›[0m

Far, far away from planet earth in another galaxy there is a planet called
"Terror" where the Wizard of Terror is up to his tricks. He built a mighty
empire and created a new species of monsters never seen in the universe
before. Those monsters, formed to an army of darkness, are unfeeling,
unscrupulous and willing to kill for their master. With this army the mad
wizard is about to extinguish all humanity.

Our four heroes discovered the subterranean headquarter of the Wizard of
Terror and his evil army, before he could execute his crazy plan.

Now it is your turn to defeat the army of darkness and the Wizard or
Terror...
