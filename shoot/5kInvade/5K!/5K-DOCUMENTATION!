FEATURES:

* Entire program is only 5K!!
* 30 realtime alien-o-tronic droid systems(TM) per level
* Proper destroyable space-invader base systems(TM)
* 25 levels (each level gets faster, and the aliens shoot more)
* Amazing innovative true 8 colour graphics system (TM)
* Synthosound FX system (TM)
* Realtime calculated linear bullet system (TM)
* Direct-o-tron Joystick interaction system (TM)

Welcome to the wonderful world of ultra-small games :) This game was created
because I came across a 2.5K space invaders game, but was disappointed to
see that it had no sound, the aliens didn't actually invade at all (but
they did pack a hell of a lot of fire power! ;) Didn't feature the classic
Space Invaders "bases", had no levels, no sounds, no title screen. It was
the absolute bare minimum. So I decided to see how small I could do an
(almost) fully featured Space-Invaders clone. The only thing missing from
5K-Invaders is the bonus ship that flies past the top. 

Installation instructions: Copy it anywhere!
Running instructions: Click on it from workbench, type its name into
                      the shell, or click on it from Dopus or something!
Controls:

Once the game has started, you can take advantage of the Direct-o-tron
joystick interaction system(TM) by pressing FIRE to start. Once in the game,
push left to go left, right to go right, and fire to initiate a realtime
calculated linear bullet(TM). At any point you can take advantage of the
Quitronic Mousebutton operated full exit system(TM) by pressing the
left mousebutton.

I am now about to slag my programming off, but before this, bear in mind
that i'm not as bad a programmer as it would appear! (If you don't believe
me, watch out for my 9-node, trapdoor spawnable BBS system that runs
paragon/MAXs/Arexx doors and has more features than you could shake a
stick at. Its games programming i'm crap at :)

This is NOT however the smallest you COULD get a game with exactly the same
gfx/sound/features. Why? Because I wrote it rather badly in Amiga E ;) 
I did originally intend to write it in ASM, but seeing as how I only just
learned to program the audio hardware, and properly construct copper lists
to to more than set up a basic screen, I couldn't get my head around doing
blitter objects. So, I loaded Amiga E, and all the objects in this version
are (ahem..) BltBitMapRastPort'ed onto the screen. This is a very lame way
to do it, but I've never used Amiga E for games programming!! Because of
this (ahem) novel approach, the game is in fact quite system intensive,
which is OK for me (my Amiga has a 50mhz 030 and 8 megs of fast ram), but
it ends up being a bit jerky in places on a standard 1200 (but not
unplayable!!)

Anyway, have fun with this little program, and i'm sure it'll chear up all
those folk who have such small amounts of free hard disk space that they
had to remove their games, now you can at least have 1 :)) (It'll probably
also be good for coverdisk people, never leave a spare 5k!!)

Greetings to the usual folk (you must know who you are by now :), look
out for my other (better) programs, music modules, programming examples,
games, and ooh other stuff.

Support the Amiga!! Support is the ultimate cure for dying computers, and
the Amiga is a survivor!

           WATCH OUT FOR 5K PACMAN!!! NEXT IN THE 5K RANGE! :))
