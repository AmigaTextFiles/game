@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   PRELUDE@{fg text}@{bg back}

   It is the year 2030 AD and the Earth is no longer the place it once was.
Crime levels have increased exponentially - Arson, theft, extortion, assault
and murder are at record highs. Most citizens refer to the new breed of
criminals as Transgressors. Highly organised, these criminals have a hand in
almost everything that goes on within the city - from politics to medical
facilities. Extremely territorial, most cities have only one Transgressor
gang - an unspoken code generally helps keep the peace between the gangs
from various cities.

   This is not to say that the Police and Governments have done nothing in
response. Indeed, most National Governments are constantly increasing law
enforcement numbers and equipment. However, with the Transgressors having
the backing of the drug lords, the police are barely able to stem the flow
of crime. Until now.

   Some scientific personal have been secretly researching genetics and
weapons, with government assistance, in an effort to develop some form of
anti-crime personnel. After five years of trials, the first of these
crime-fighters are now ready. Known as the Vindicators, these civilian
volunteers are a cut above any normal human. Possessing better reflexes,
intelligence and perception, the Vindicators are perhaps the last chance for
law and order. 

   Success will not be easy however. The Vindicators are still in limited
numbers - only one has been assigned to each city. Furthermore, if the
Vindicators fail, not only will crime quickly overcome that city, but the
large numbers of failures may cause the governments to abandon the
Vindicator Program and submit before the Transgressors. A lot rides on the
shoulders of each Vindicator.

   You are Vindicator 800, Rick Murphy, assigned to protect the city of
Albora. It is your 6th week on the job and you have had some excellent
results. Taking the fight directly to the Transgressors, you quickly
crippled their drug and money inflows, as well as destroying many key
personnel. Everything was going beautifully - at least until yesterday.

   Fearing that the end was near, the Transgressors decided to make a major
strike. While diverting your attention through a series of raids on outlying
houses, a  hit squad attacked and killed your family. You were devastated.
Hot rage swept through you and has not abated since. You were sick of the
violence, sick of the suffering, sick of fighting. It was time to end it
once and for all.

   You arranged a meeting with the leader of the Transgressors - Traxxion.
You were willing to end the fighting as quickly as possible. Traxxion
listened and agreed with you. Your plan was simple - you would fight, one by
one, each of Traxxion's remaining gang members, and then Traxxion himself,
in the City Battle Arena. Each fight would be to the death. If you lost then
the city would be theirs for the taking. If you won - well, the
Transgressors would obviously be no more. A fight to the death - the winner
takes all - this was your Ultimatum.

@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   THE GAME MODES@{fg text}@{bg back}

   In Ultimatum you can play several different types of games.

      @{b}1. Practice Mode@{ub} - Practice mode allows you to get familiar with the
      controls of the tank as well as some opponents and the layout of the
      arena. At the end of each game you will get a detailed analysis of
      the game to allow you to improve your strategies.
            
      @{b}2. Campaign Mode@{ub} - Story mode pits you against the eight combatants
      in the story outlined in the prelude. You must defeat all eight
      enemies to rid the city of the Transgressors. Each opponent will
      become progressively harder. Thankfully you will begin each fight
      with full shields and ammo.
@endnode

@node "tank control" "Tank Control "

@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   TANK CONTROL@{fg text}@{bg back}

   Battles in Ultimatum are fought using tanks. The tank can be operated
with the Mouse (or Joystick) and the Keyboard. The sensitivity of the mouse
and Joystick can be set in the options screen. The controls are:

   @{b}MOUSE:@{ub}
               
   Moving the mouse left and right will turn the Tank left and right.
Pressing the right mouse button will move the tank forward. Pressing the
left mouse button will fire the lasers.

                      MOUSE
                    ---------
  Fire Lasers ---> /    |    \ <--- Move Forward
                   |    |    |
                   |    |    |
                   |---------|
                   |         |
   Turn Left <---  |         | ---> Turn Right
                   |         |
                   |         |
                   \         /
                    ---------

   @{b}JOYSTICK:@{ub}

   Left and right rotates the tank, while pressing forward moves the tank
forward.  Pulling back will reverse the tank while pressing the fire button
will fire the lasers.

                                        ***
                     Forward            *** Press button to fire lasers
                        |               ***
                        |
     Rotate left -------+------- Rotate right
                        |
                        |
                     Reverse


               
  @{b} KEYBOARD:@{ub}

   <SPACE>  - Turbo. This gives the tank a short burst of speed.

    <DEL>   - Missile. This fires a missile and switches to the missile
               view. The missile does not automatically hit the enemy tank.
               Instead you must guide the missile to the enemy tank by
               steering left and right. The missile has limited fuel and
               moves very fast. As soon as it hits anything it will
               explode.

   <RETURN> - Special. This will activate a special weapon if you have one.
               These are outlined below.
@endnode

@node "weapons" "Weapons      "

@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   WEAPONS@{fg text}@{bg back}

   @{b}Lasers@{ub} - The Lasers can be fired almost continuously and will show as
      flashing beams coming from both sides of the tank. The technical term
      for lasers is H-PAC. This stands for Heavy Particle Accelerator
      Cannon (© E Sean L Rintel).  H-PAC is the term used in-game.

      Lasers have two restrictions:

      (a) Limited Ammo - The Tank cannot store the energy to keep the
      Lasers firing on a never-ending basis. The tank can hold 40 shots at
      any one time. Your remaining shots are indicated on the lower left
      hand corner of the screen.

      You can reload the Lasers from one of the two reload stations in the
      arena. The stations are at either end of the arena and marked with
      either a ONE or a TWO. You start in number ONE. Further, you must
      reload from alternate reload stations. Thus, your next reload will be
      at station TWO, then back to ONE, back to TWO and so on. To make it
      easier the computer will tell you which reload you must use next. You
      actually reload by driving through the centre of the station.
      NOTE: you can drive in either way, not just the way the arrows point.

      (b) Limited Strength - The Lasers are not very strong. They do very
      little  damage from any great distance. In close, however, they make
      very capable weapons.

   @{b}Missiles@{ub} - These are your secret weapons. The missiles, known as
      TankBusters, deliver large amounts of damage. However, you must
      control the missiles yourself. When you fire a missile, the tank
      stops moving and the screen will change to the missile view (green).
      You must then guide the missile to the Enemy tank.

      Please note a few things: the Enemy tank WILL try and dodge the
      missile, the missile moves very fast and can be hard to control, the
      missile will explode as soon as it hits anything, and the missile has
      limited fuel (which counts down on the bottom right of the screen).

      Missiles may be used to destroy Specials (to prevent your opponent
      from getting it).

      You also have limited missiles - you begin with only four - so use
      them sparingly. To your advantage the enemy tank does not have any
      missiles.

   @{b}Turbo@{ub} - By pressing the space bar you will get a short burst of speed.
      This may be enough to get you to a reload station or just to get some
      breathing space. You can also use it to get really close to the other
      tank and blast him before he has time to react.  The number of turbos
      you have left is indicated by the blue arrows at the bottom of your
      heads-up-display.

   @{b}Aegis@{ub} - these are the shields.  I know this isn't really a weapon but I
      couldn't think of anywhere else to put it :) Your shields are
      expressed as a percentage.  When they fall below zero you are dead :(
@endnode

@node "specials" "Specials     "
   
@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   SPECIALS@{fg text}@{bg back}

   Specials are collected by obtaining the rotating power-up pyramids that
appear from time to time. They will appear randomly and you will be alerted
to their presence by a unique sound - you'll learn to recognise it!  Whoever
gets to the pyramid first will get the bonus, so quickly look for it.

Specials consist of two different types of bonuses: Power Ups and Extra
Weapons. Both Power Ups and Extra Weapons look identical so you will never
know what special it is until you get it.
   
   These are the specials:

      1. @{b}Shield Repair@{ub} - This power up will either partially or (if you are
         lucky) completely repair your shields.
      2. @{b}Laser Reload@{ub} - This will reload your lasers to their maximum
         capacity.
      3. @{b}Laser Bonus@{ub} - This will both reload and increase your lasers to a
         total of 80.
      4. @{b}Missile Reload@{ub} - This will reload your missiles to four (Major
         KICK BUTT TIME!).
      5. @{b}Turbo Reload@{ub} - This will reload your turbos to four.
      6. @{b}Velocity@{ub} - This will increase the speed of your tank permanantly.
      7.@{b} Enemy Analysis@{ub} - This will show the current statistics of the
         opponent.
      8.@{b} H-PAC Booster@{ub} - This will replace your normal laser with a better
         Laser.
      9. @{b}Starbursts@{ub} - these are self-guiding charges of energy fired at
         your opponent. Simply point at the enemy and shoot - the starburst
         will then home in on the enemy tank. Starbursts require 15 units
         of H-PAC each - once you have run out of H-PAC then you lose the
         Starburst special.  Press return to activate this special. (And it
         makes a cool sound when you fire it!! Excellent! Party!!)
     10. @{b}Recoil Bomb @{ub}- this converts all your remaining H-PAC, Missiles and
         Turbos into one huge bomb.  No aiming is required :)  Just press
         return to activate.
     11.@{b} Z-Sphere@{ub} - gives temporary invulnerability - indicated by your
         Aegis percentage shown in yellow (Dave says, "I always have to say
         DIE MOTHERS when ever I get this special!!")
     12.@{b} Transmogrifier@{ub} - pressing return converts all of your current
         H-PAC into Aegis! (Scott says, "what does Transmogrifier mean
         again?")
     13.@{b} Rammers@{ub} - ramming the enemy tank will now do him lots of damage
         *grin*

@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   WINNING@{fg text}@{bg back}

   When you defeat an opponent or are defeated, you will get a summary
screen showing you all sorts of interesting details about the game. Press
any key to go on. If you have defeated the opponent the next opponent will
appear and on you go. If you are good enough to defeat all the opponents you
will get the end game sequence.

Note that there are different end game sequences depending on the level you
are playing at. You only get the really, truly, its all over, end game
sequence if you are playing at the hardest level.
   
   If you are defeated you may get another chance depending on if there are
any continues left. There is also a secret mode if you know what to type in

@node "arena" "The Arena                   "

@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   THE ARENA@{fg text}@{bg back}

      In total there are three different arenas set in three different
locations. The locations are on the surface of the Earth, on the surface of
the moon, and underground. The arenas vary in size and shape, but each
consists of similar structures. Only experience will teach you how to best
use each arena to your advantage. However, to get you started, the first
arena is outlined below.

      The first arena is approximately square in shape with the four outer
points marked by tall rectangular END posts  - they are marked with the word
"END" and indicate the boundaries of the arena. An invisible wall prevents
you from moving outside the boundaries of the arena and your tank will
simply bounce off it. (Map - Objects 1, 2, 3, 4)

      The starting points for the two tanks are at opposite ends of the
arena and look like walled parking bays with arrows on the ground and walls.
The two starting bays both have a sign above them saying  either a "ONE" or
"TWO" written on the sides. You start in bay ONE and the computer starts in
bay TWO. You can enter the bays from either direction. The starting bays are
used for reloading the lasers. (Map - Objects 5(One), 6(Two))

      The center of the arena is marked by a large structure (Map - Object
7). There are also four multi-layered storage pods in the arena. Two are on
each side and they are rectangular in shape (Map - objects 8, 9, 10, 11).

      There are also two special objects in the arena. The first is the
local Television Building. It houses the commentators and the television
cameras and studios. It is in one corner of the arena and looks like a large
building with TV written on one side and large antenna on top of the
building (Map - Object 12).

The other object is the Hazard.  It is located diagonally opposite the TV
building on the far side of the arena. A large striped sign floats above the
pit warning contestents to stay away. Hitting the pit with your tank will
result in damage! (Map - Object 13).

@node "tips" "Tips and Tactics            "

@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   TIPS AND TACTICS@{fg text}@{bg back}

   @{b}Getting Started@{ub}

   - Read these docs from top to bottom
   - The first thing you should do is run the practice game, to get you
     familiar with the game and how to use the lasers, missiles and
     specials.
   - Also get familiar with the sensitivity of the controllers (either
     mouse or joy). Remember that you can change the sensitivity of the
     controllers in the options menu - different computers will require
     different sensitivities so try a few different ones.
   - Different computers will also require different speed settings. The
     standard game was designed to run on an unexpanded Amiga 1200, so if
     you have anything different (ie faster) you will need to slow the
     speed down a little. If you find the screen is glitching this may be
     because the speed setting is up to high. For instance, on my A4000/030
     (Dave writing here) I knock the speed setting down one or two.
     Experiment till you find the setting that suits your computer.

   - Get in close. Your lasers do more damage the closer you are.
   - Use the turbo to get you to specials or reload bays quickly.
   - Don't be afraid to use the missiles in close (its easy to hit the
     enemy in close) or to just scout out the arena.
   - If you can't see the special, try and find the enemy tank - it may be
     heading for the special.
   - If know you can't get to the special before the enemy tank, you may
     wish to missile the special. At least the enemy can't get it :)
   - Try not to turn your back on the computer for long - it will always
     take advantage of your blind spots.
   - Get familiar with the arena - know where the reload bays are.
   - Try different strategies with the specials - they will often mean the
     difference between winning and losing.

@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES@{fg text}@{bg back}

Ultimatum has been tested on an A1200/020/2M and an A4000/040/4M and works
fine on these computers.

FLICKERING SCREEN DURING PLAY

On an Amiga faster than a stock A1200, the "ground" may flicker. This is
because the game is running too fast. Correct this by bringing the game
speed down a notch or two. You can do this on the Options screen. On Dave's
A4000, Dave had to use a value of 1 or 2 for the game speed.

ARENA OBJECTS UPSIDE-DOWN

On rare occasions the arena objects are upside-down during the "fly-in"
sequence, just before you fight your opponent. This appears to be a rather
annoying quirk of Amos3D and cannot be corrected as far as I know.

FLICKERING GARBLED GRAPHICS

Sometimes while the music is being played you may see some flickering
garbled graphics. This is caused by the music player I am using :(  This can
often be corrected by rebooting and loading Ultimatum from a "fresh" start.
If you have been using Workbench for a while and then load Ultimatum, old
bits of memory may still be floating around, causing the flickering.
Therefore rebooting is recommended.

Ultimatum - A Full Moon Production.

Designed by David King and Stuart Matthews.

 Stuart Matthews - Programming, Music, Sounds Effects, Creative Input
 David King - 3d Objects and Graphics, Game Design and Scripting,
   Documentation

 Scott Matthews - Bitmap, handdrawn, pictures of the Characters and the
   Game Over pics.

 Starring:
   Sean Rintel as the Evil and Nasty Transgressors
   Stuart Matthews as the Cheerful and Helpful Commentators
   David, Stuart, Tim, and Jim as the Crowd


 The following Programs were used to help make this game:

   1. Amos Professional - a beautiful piece of software and a joy to work
         with. But where is the AGA update!! AARRGGHH!!
   2. Amos Compiler -Works fine. I wish it'd speed up the frame rate a bit
         more *grumble*
   3. Amos 3D - "Arrrrrrrrggggghhhh I hate this stupid program", says
         David, "What about you Stuart?". "I think Voodoo (who made Amos3D)
         never actually intended anyone to make a game with it.  Amos3D
         lacks a lot of features that are needed to make a good 3d game.
         You have to struggle to do anything with it", says Stuart.
   4. DPaint 4.5 - Very nice.
   5. Imagine 2.0 - I wish I had a faster computer, more ram, 24 bit
         graphics, and Imagine 3.0.
   6. OctaMED Pro - a truly fantastic program. Ignore the other trackers,
         MED is the best!
   7. Final Writer - The best.
   8. Memacs - Fast, small and easy to use. (It has stupid hot keys though
         - Stu.)
   9. Directory Opus - The best directory management program ever, but why
         doesn't it free all memory when it exits?? ("Yeah" says Stu.)
   10. X-Comm - Ok, so its buggy. But its fast and gets the job done. And I
         like the interface.

The following bits of hardware were used to help make this game:

   1. David's Computer - Amiga 4000/030/4/120, Commodore 1940 Monitor.
   2. Stuart's Computer - Amiga 1200/020/2/170, Commodore 1940 Monitor.
   3. Stuart's Sound Digitizer.
   4. Stuart's Microphone.
   5. David's Chair.
   6. Stuart's Chair.
   7. David's Brain.
   8. Stuart's Brain ("Sometimes", says David.)
   9. David's Modem.
   10. Stuart's Modem.
   11. Lots of Telecom's cabling.
   
   The authors would like to thank the following people for playing and

@{fg shine}@{bg shadow}   THE FINAL WORD@{fg text}@{bg back}

   Its taken us a year and a half to make this game, and its turned out
completely different from the program we both spoke about right at the
start. Funny how things turn out like that.

Truth be told we probably could have finished this game a hell of a lot
quicker but life in general got in the way. Anyway, its been a lot of fun
and we hope that at least some of you enjoy it. Please write and tell us
what you think:

      - flames will be deleted
      - constructive criticism will be taken on board
      - praise will be graciously accepted
   
   Go ESCOM and may the Force be with you, always.
