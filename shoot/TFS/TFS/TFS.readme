A retro DEMO-GAME for AMIGA by Alberto Sgaggero.  

Tie Fighter Simulator is a small DEMO-GAME
made with AMOS BASIC for classic Amiga
computers. It's a nostalgic tribute to
Star Wars, 80s electronic games, and retro
programming.  

THE STORY
Luke and Darth Vader are in the Mos Eisley
Cantina, enjoying a father-son moment
playing Tie Fighter Simulator and
listening to music.  

THE DEMO-GAME
Started in 2021 as a personal project to
relearn AMOS BASIC, inspired by a scene
from Star Wars - Episode IV. It was paused in
2022, resumed in 2024, and released in 2025.  

HOW TO PLAY
All instructions are included in the game.
