 ›[0;1mWelcome to ›[32;40mZerberk›[33;40m!›[0m
 ›[0;1m===================›[0m


 ›[0;1;4mWhat is it?›[0m

 Zerberk is inspired from the arcade game "Berzerk". The object of the game
 seems quite simple: Destroying all Centurion Robots and Elexerion Robots in
 an electricity maze and finally destroying the Neuronic. Every time a
 Neuronic is killed the robot speed increases!

 ›[0;1mThe electricity maze: ›[0mDon't leave a room before all robots are destroyed, or
 you will enter the same level again. All walls are deadly. Keep distance!

 ›[0;1mCenturions: ›[0mNormally they're standing around and are doing nothing... But if
 they ›[0mscan an intruder, Centurions will decrease distance or fire a deadly
 energy shot. Keep distance and fire diagonally!

 ›[0;1mElexerions: ›[0mThey are not moving around, but watch their energy beam!

 ›[0;1mOtto: ›[0mAppears if you stay too long in a maze room. Don't try to fire at him,
 your only chance is to escape. Try to flee to the left or right!

 ›[0;1mThe neuronic: ›[0mThe brain of all robots. Totally harmless, but guarded by
 Elexerions.

 ›[0;1mMystery: ›[0mDon't touch!

 Be carefull in multi-player mode:

   · All players must use the same exit!
   · The player in shortest range of the destroyed robot gets the score!


 ›[0;1;4mFeatures:›[0m

   · ›[0;1mUp to four player simultanous game! ›[0m(Supports the four player joystick
     adapter for the parallel port, so be sure that you are not currently
     using your parallel printer, if you select more than one player: the
     output may get scrambled.)
   · ›[0;1mSoft stereo! ›[0m(Uses one left and one right channel for each sample. A
     sound gets different volumes at the two channels - depending at the
     horizontal position of the sound causing object.)
   · ›[0;1mSaves highscores! ›[0m(Does not if your Disk is write protected.)
   · ›[0;1mFreeware!!! ›[0m(You can copy it for non-commercial purpose!)

 ›[0;1;4mTechnical:›[0m

   · Zerberk uses direct blitter access, so GFX-card screenmodes will fail.
     If you are using CyberGraphX, you WILL have to DISABLE the PLANES2FAST
     option or the game will even fail on standard screen modes!


 ›[0;1;4mHistory:›[0m

 Zerberk was my first Amiga game. Like Minerunner, inspiration hit me in a
 boring computer science lesson while thinking at old games from Atari 2600.
 Although parts of Star Defender and Minerunner were already playable,
 Zerberk was finished first. After endless futile attempts to create fast
 game graphics with the bob system from Amiga's graphics library, Andreas
 showed me the way of direct blitter programming and it was fast enough.
 Minerunner followed soon after. Thanks Andy! :^)

 ›[0;1mV1.4:›[0m (05.Dec.1993)
   · Player cannot harm themselves in team mode now.
   · Bug with Elexerions removed.
   · Color flashing speed decreased.

 ›[0;1mV1.3:›[0m (23.Jul.1993)
   · Another runtime error fixed!
   · Added shield for each player in the first few seconds of a level to
     avoid unfair situations.

 ›[0;1mV1.2:›[0m (17.May.1993)
   · Uses topaz.font 8 now. So there are no longer problems with non 8x8
     system default fonts.
   · Can open a NTSC screen. On some (NTSC?) machines seems to be a strange
     bug, so that some lines disappear. Double-click the NTSC icon to start
     Zerberk in NTSC mode or if you use the CLI, type: Zerberk NTSC
   · Recompiled with small data model and without stack check. Should run a
     bit faster now.

 ›[0;1mV1.1:›[0m (26.Apr.1993)
   · Runtime error fixed! (oops)

 ›[0;1mV1.0:›[0m (19.Apr.1993)
   · First public release.
