I. THE STORY

A. Episode 1: Return to LV-426

   Fifty years have passed since the original incident that claimed the lives
   of one hundred and fifty plus colonists and Colonial Marines. You are a
   hardened mercenary, hired by a rival company to investigate a rumor that
   Weyland Yutani has begun to rebuild Hadley's Hope, the colony destroyed by
   the nuclear blast from the atmospheric processor of the original compound.
   Sent alone, your job is to sniff out the details of just exactly what it
   is they are up to, while remaining undetected by their large force of
   Colonial Marines and Bio-Technicians.
        Unfortunately, things don't work out so good! Captured, you are
   placed in a electromagnetically sealed holding cell and await
   interrogation. The semi-constructed colony is cold, dark and wet, and
   days go by before you see anyone besides the rats and roaches that are
   fighting you for your last morsel of food. Finally, after nearly
   a week, one of the guys supposedly in charge - a Colonel or some dimwitted
   quasi-high ranking USCM official - is trying to find out just what the hell
   you are doing here when all of a sudden a sickening look appears on his
   face, blood begins to drip from his mouth and he begins to shake violently
   as he collapses to the floor!  Blood stains appear on his shirt,
   and you hear the crack of bones as *something* rips its way out of his
   chest and disappears off into the darkness. Great. Now you'll never get
   out of here, you'll probably just starve to death in this cell.  Another
   two days pass. In the distance you hear a lot of pulse rifle fire, mixed
   with a lot of yelling, and some quite *inhuman* sounds. It would seem
   that the rumors about Weyland Yutani may have been true, and that the
   so-called Xenomorph, something you had only heard about in stories until
   you saw one rip it's way out of that colonel's chest, was being bred in
   captivity in this so called colony. More like a biohazard waste dump
   that's getting out of control! Suddenly, everything goes black....you
   get up, slide open the now unlocked cell door, and stumble into the
   darkened room. Grabbing a pistol from the body of the colonel, and a
   shotgun and motion detector from a nearby storage closet, you set out to
   get the hell out of here!

*****************************
II. INSTALLING ALIEN QUAKE

A. Installation

   1. Make a directory in your QUAKE directory to hold Alien Quake.

   CD \QUAKE         (or the directory where your copy of Quake is located)
   MKDIR ALIENS
   CD ALIENS

   2. Copy the Alien Quake ZIP files to this directory.

   COPY [path]\AQ*.ZIP .

   (where [path] is the path where the Alien Quake ZIP files are located)

   3. Unzip the Alien Quake archives.

   PKUNZIP -d *.ZIP

   That's it! To start the game, do the following:

   CD \QUAKE        (or the directory where your copy of Quake is located)
   QUAKE -game aliens

**************************
III. THE BASICS OF PLAY

A. Goal of the Game

   The goal of the game is pretty simple.  Live.  Get out of the Colony.
   Kill everything you see, or be killed.

B. Skill

   The start area has three short hallways. The one you go down selects
   the skill level you wish to play at.

        Easy        -- Uh... Why?
        Medium      -- Most people should start Alien Quake at medium skill. 
        Hard        -- Highly recommended for real bad-asses.  After all, you
                       are a mercenary.
        Nightmare   -- Now were talking serious carnage.  Don't expect to
                       live very long!

C. Episodes

   "Return to LV-426" is the only episode in Alien Quake 1.0.

D. Getting About

   The specific keys named below can be changed by using the Configure Keys
   Menu. If you have reconfigured Run as the R key, for instance, then the
   Shift key will not double your speed. 

   Walk
      Use the arrow keys or the mouse. To walk steadily forward, hold down
      the Forward key (up arrow or center mouse button). Turn left or right
      with the left or right arrow keys or sliding your mouse to the left or 
      right.

   Run
      Hold down Run (the Shift key) to double your speed.

   Jumping
      Tap the Jump key (the space bar or Enter key). You jump further if 
      you're moving forward, and you jump higher if you're moving up a slope
      at. You'll be surprised at the spots you can reach in a jump. You can
      even avoid some attacks by jumping at the right time.

   Swimming
      When underwater, aim yourself in the direction you wish to go, and
      move forward. You have full three-dimensional freedom. Unfortunately,
      as in real life, you may lose your bearings while underwater. Use
      jump (the space bar or Enter key) to kick straight up towards the
      surface. Once on the surface, tread water by holding down jump.
      To get out of the drink, swim towards the shore. Once there, use jump
      to climb up. If you're down a well or you can't get a grip, you may
      not be able to climb out. There is always another way out, but you may
      have to submerge to find it.

   Shooting
      Tap the Shoot key (the Ctrl key or left mousebutton) to fire. Hold it 
      down to keep firing. But remember: "short, controlled bursts!"

   Firing Flares
      Press 'F' to fire a flare. These are very useful in dark areas and
      believe me - there are plenty of them.  

   Use
      Alien Quake has no "Use" function. To push a button or open a door,
      walk up to it. To ride a platform up or down, step onto it. If a door
      won't open or a platform won't go down, you may need to do something
      special to activate it.

   Picking up stuff
      To pick up items, weapons, and power-ups, walk over them. If you can't
      pick up a thing, it means you already have as many of it that you can
      carry. You can't pick up a piece of armor that's worse than the one
      you have.

E. Finding Things

   Buttons and Floorplates
      Buttons activate with a touch, and floorplates must be stepped on.
      If you see a distinctive-looking button in a spot you cannot reach,
      it's probably a shootable button-- fire at it.  Note: Some doors are
      better off left unopened in Alien Quake!

   Doors
      Most doors open at your approach. If one doesn't, find a special
      button, floorplate, or key.

   Secret Doors
      Some doors are camouflaged. Almost all secret doors open when they are
      shot.  The rest are opened by hidden pressure plates or buttons.

   Authoring Signature Rooms
      In order to prevent things like the "Actura level theft", some of the
      levels have an authoring signature room (or .sig room for short). .sig
      rooms contain the level author's signature - some easily recognizable
      structure or collection of brushes. When you step into a .sig room, a
      copyright message will be displayed. Visitnig the .sig rooms can be
      rewarding - sometimes they contain extra weapons and ammo!

   Platforms
      Most platforms only go up and down, while some follow tracks around
      rooms or levels. When you step onto a platform, it rises to its
      full height, and usually only lowers when you step off. Some platforms
      must be activated via button or pressure plate.

   Pressure Plates & Motion Detectors
      Invisible or visible sensors which open doors, unleash traps, warn
      monsters, etc.

   Uncovering Secrets
      Secrets are hidden in many ways. You might need to shoot a button, kill
      an alien, walk through a secret motion detector, etc.

   The Secret of Secrets
      All secrets in Alien Quake are indicated by clues. Don't waste your
      time hacking at every wall. 

=============================================================================
== TIP -- Bouncing a grenade off a shootable button or secret door won't   ==
== open it, but if the grenade's explosion goes off nearby, this may       ==
== activate such secrets.                                                  ==

B. Cheat Codes

   Ahh...Wouldn't you like to know????  Cheat codes have been changed!


**************************
V. Your New Environment

A. Firepower

   All new weapons are at your disposal...

   Motion Detector
      Not really a weapon, but very useful indeed.

   Pistol
      Not really a weapon. Oh sorry, not *much* of a weapon. More like
      a last resort!

   Shotgun
      A little better, but still takes a lot of shots to take out an alien.

   Pulse Rife
      Two modes. Grenades and Bullets.  Grenades are our favorite!

   Auto Rifle 
      Now were talking serious firepower!  Eats up that ammo though.

   Smartgun
      The most powerful weapon you will ever see in Quake!  We promise.

   Flamethrower  
      The most fun you will ever have in Quake!  We promise.

   Switching Between Weapons
      If you are firing a weapon and run out of ammo, Alien Quake
      automatically switches to another weapon.  


B. Ammo

   The eight weapons use four types of ammo. Each ammo type comes in two 
   flavors -- small and large. The large boxes carry twice as much as the 
   small. 

   Shells 
      For shotguns. A small box holds 20.

   Bullets 
      For pistols, pulse rifles and auto rifles. 

   Grenades 
      For grenade launchers. A small crate holds 5.

   Cells 
      For smartguns and flamethrowers.


C. Power-ups

   All power-ups except armor burn out after a while, so smoke 'em while you
   got 'em. 

   Armor 
      Comes in three flavors.

   Megahealth
      Gives you 100 additional hit points. After a few seconds, all hit
      points over 100 start slowing draining away because it's too much for
      the human body to hold. Still, it's nice while it lasts. 

   Biosuit 
      Lets you breathe underwater. Does not protect against molten metal. 

   Quad Damage 
      This is a nice one to find. Four times the carnage!


D. Bad Guys

   Alien Quake has more enemies than Quake, and they don't really behave much
   like Quake monsters.

   USMC Colonial Marines
      Marines with pulse rifles, looking to keep you from stealing their
      shuttle craft to get the hell of the rock!

   Bio Technicians
      Very protective about their work, and carrying pulse rifles to back it
      up.

   Androids
      Bishop Mk II.  Extremely tough and deadly.  Fires laser cannon with
      deadly accuracy.  These guys are nothing to mess with.  Dies in a
      spray of white bio juice!

   Sentry Guns
      You remember these things, right?  They are few in numbers, but it only
      takes one of these high powered babies to cut you into little pieces.

   Search Droids
      You will encounter these lightning shooters in the mid sections of
      several of the buildings, where few humans dare to venture.  But
      even search droids stay away from the lower sections!

   Aliens
      The Xenomorph goes through several stages before adulthood, and trust
      us, it's better to kill one off when it's young rather then letting it
      grow up into something bigger!

   Eggs
      All xenomorphs begin life as an egg.  Don't get to close to these
      pulsing sacs, or you'll be in for a surprise!

   Facehuggers
      Facehuggers emerge from eggs, are very difficult to hit and have an
      instinct to leap for your face, where they like to attach themselves.
      We suggest you make sure to not let them do that.

   Chestbursters
      You'll see these guys popping out of marines who have been impregnated
      by facehuggers.  Shooting a body will get the chestburster to pop out
      prematurely, giving you a chance to kill it.  If you let it get away,
      it will run off to hide somewhere, and after a while, it will evolve
      into an alien warrior.

   Alien Warriors
      Warriors are extremely fast, agile and dangerous.  When young, they can
      squeeze through tiny spaces, and make incredible leaps.  They
      eventually reach a full size of about eight feet tall and become a bit
      harder to dispose of.  Killing a warrior at close range is a Bad Thing
      to do, as you generally get doused with a lethal spray of bio-acid.
      Remember, the bigger the warrior, the more acid it contains!  Warriors
      are distinguishable by a rugged dark brown exoskeleton, with lots of
      armor and a mouth full of long teeth.

   Alien Drones
      Drones are the more smooth skeletoned, blackish cousins of the
      warriors. They can usually be found guarding eggs, and like the warrior
      can leap at you and they die in a shower of acid.

   Alien Queen
      There is only one of these beasts, and that's good, because at over
      twelve feet high, the queen is nearly indestructible.  She has a
      large wide cranium, and uses her tail to impale you.  Killing the
      queen will take at least 20 good grenade shots, so put away a few
      grenades for her!

=============================================================================
== TIP -- Aliens can hide in ducts, and pipes over your head, so always    ==
== keep a look out for what is over you head!                              ==
=============================================================================


E. Environmental Hazards and Effects

   Explosions
      Radioactive containers are in some areas. Shooting these 
      things unleashes a big boom, so be careful -- you may not want to 
      stand too close in a firefight. Your own grenades and rockets cause
      explosions too, of course -- the blast can hurt you if you're too
      close.

   Water 
      Safe enough unless you stay under so long that you start to drown.
      Come up for air periodically to prevent this. 

   Molten metal 
      If you're quick and it's shallow, you might escape before you're 
      burnt to a crisp,  but don't bet on it. 

=============================================================================
== TIP -- Aliens evolve!  If you see a young alien, kill it.  It's a lot   ==
== easier to deal with a chestburster than with a warrior.                 ==
=============================================================================


*********************************
VI. Frequently Asked Questions

Q.  Some things in this game are different from what I see in the
    movies!
A.  Alien Quake takes place fifty years after the second movie, so things
    have changed on the planet, obviously.  It is a new colony, so although
    some buildings may have similar designs, there are notable differences.
    Other things, such as weapon strengths, etc have been altered to improve
    gameplay. When designing Alien Quake, we almost always chose gameplay
    over movie specs.

Q.  Will there be more episodes?
A.  Yes!

Q.  I thought that the Nostromo was to be the first level!
A.  That was the original plan, but it didn't make sense as far as the
    episode went, so it was later designated the secret level.

Q.  Can the Aliens climb walls?
A.  At this time they cannot climb walls, but this may change in a later
    release.

Q.  How were the textures for the monsters, weapons and levels created?
A.  Many of the new textures were created directly from the movies.  In fact
    the textures for most of the aliens were created from the picture of the
    alien sticking it's head through the transport's door just before it got
    it's head blown off!  A lot of blending and pasting was involved.

Q.  How did you guys team up for this project?
A.  Basically through a common love of the Alien series, and the creative
    desire to modify Quake, the most awesome game ever created!  There have
    been many members since the beginning, but only three have stuck through
    to the bloody end!

Q.  Are you guys gonna team up for other episodes or projects?
A.  At this time the prognosis is pretty good for at least one more episode,
    maybe two, and possible some other projects.
