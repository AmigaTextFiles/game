   Introduction
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Croins is an Asteroids-clone game, but more coloured and various.


   System requirements
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Any PAL Amiga with 512 Kb of chip memory (you need another 512 Kb of chip
   for the title music).


   Installation
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Just copy the following files to any directory of your choice:

      Croins
      Croins-TopScores
      Mod.Virtual
      Croins.doc
      Croins.doc.info
      StartCroins
      StartCroins.info (or MWBIcon/StartCroins.info if you have the MagicWB
                        package installed)

   If you delete the Croins-TopScores file, the top scores table will be
   cleared.

   In case you want to create a bootable floppy disk, copy all the files
   from the archive to a disk labelled Croins and install it.


   Usage
   ¯¯¯¯¯
   To run the game open a CLI/Shell window, enter the Croins directory, type
   in 'Croins' and press the Enter key. It can also be started by
   double-clicking the StartCroins icon. You will find more detailed
   instructions within the game.


   Guarantee
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   The program has been tested several times, but its reliability is not
   guaranteed at 100%. I (the author) do not consider myself responsable for
   loss or damage of data as consequence of the use of the program. Play
   Croins at your own risk.


   Copyright

   that it is always accompanied by all the files in this archive. The whole

   History
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
      1.0  - First release.

      1.01 - When you quitted the game, the Workbench background colour on
             AGA machines could be altered.

      1.02 - Slightly changed the in-game information.

      1.03 - Added a title music.

      1.04 - If a mouse or screen blanker was running and you started
             Croins from a screen with a resolution different than PAL, the
             game screen could result severely distorted.
           - Changed the speed of the title music (now it is the original
             one).

      1.05 - Now you can control the ship by using the keyboard.
           - Now you can disable the joystick-down switch to avoid
             accidental activation of the hyperspace (use the space-bar
             instead).
           - Some other minor changes.
