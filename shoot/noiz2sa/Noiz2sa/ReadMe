How to play :

Select the stage using the keyboard or the joystick.

 - Movement  Arrow keys / Joystick
 - Fire      [Z]        / JoyButton 1, JoyButton 4
 - Slowdown  [X]        / JoyButton 2, JoyButton 3
 - Pause     [P]

Press the fire key/button to start the game.


Control your ship and avoid the barrage.
Your ship is not destroyed when it collides with some enemy.
Your ship is only destroyed when its core hits a bullet.
It's possible to slowdown the ship movement by pressing the corresponding key.

All green stars are bonus items. You should collect them.
The score is displayed in the top left corner and increases faster if you get
continuous sequences of bonus items.

When all your ships are destroyed, the game is over.
You get a new ship after 200 000 points and then every 500 000 points.


Available command line arguments:
 -nosound       No ingame sound.
 -window        Start the game in a window, instead of full-screen.
 -reverse       Exchange the fire and the slowdown keys.
 -brightness n  Set the screen brightness (n is a number between 0 and 256).
 -accframe      Use the alternative framerate management algorithm.
                (If you have a problem with framerate, try this option.)
 -nowait        No added slowdown when there are many displayed bullets (so the
                game becomes harder).
