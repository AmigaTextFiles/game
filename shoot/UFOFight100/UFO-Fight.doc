  UFO-Fight is a shoot/action-game.  0-3 players can play it the same time,
the other UFOs can be controlled by the computer.

    4. Idea

  The  idea of the game is quite simple.  There are one, two, three or four
UFOs  on  one  screen.   All of them have to shoot down the others from the
sky.   The  kills  and  lost lives (= deaths) are counted at the top of the
screen.

    5. In-game keys

  By  pressing  F1  you  can  go to the settings which also appear when you
start  the  game.   Here you can turn off UFOs and set their control device
(keyboard,  joystick  etc.), you can also reset the kills and deaths there.
By pressing P during the game you can pause it.

  This  is  my first, small game in BlitzII.  First I only wanted to make a
UFO  to  fly  over  the screen ...  But over night the program had become a
small  game.   Don't  await  too much from the game I was coding on it less
than 24 hours.  In addition this is my first try to write a game in BlitzII
and my first action game on the Amiga.

P.S. Sorry about my Englisch
