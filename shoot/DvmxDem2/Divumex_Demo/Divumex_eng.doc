/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X What is  Divumex? X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\

This  is  a  preview  of  a  game  I  am being developing.  It's a vertical
shoot'em up, designed as a tribute to Xevious, a game produced by Namco and
Atari in the early 80s.

Being this a preview, there are many things missing that will be introduced
once finished.  Many other improvements will be done (alien behaviour, ship
movement,  sound  effects  and so on).  Thus don't think the game looks too
primitive!

Many improvements have been made for this second demo, and I wish it to be
more amusing now. Obviously there still are many other things worth of
being added, and each suggestion by you will be willingly read.

X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\ DISCLAIMER X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X\X

In  my  full  consciousness  I ensure this game to be a whole production of
mine.   It  has been redesigned from scratch.  I do not own anything coming
from  the  original  coinop  besides a couple of photos.  The demo you have
just downloaded tries to be as similar as possible to the original game but
there are also many differences (graphics, alien movement) that will remain
in the final version too, mainly because this is a *tribute*, and in no way
it will be any kind of porting.

Moreover,  I  didn't  develop  this game for money.  Actually it is totally
freeware and you're free to do whatever you like, apart from modify or hide
the  author  name, or distribute without the document files as a commercial
product,  in  any  support  (disks, cds), Urban Mueller's AmiNet collection
being the only exception.

To  demostrate that this is *not* a copy from the coin-op, i'm ready to put
at anyone's disposal all Divumex sources and graphic screens.

Finally,  I  won't  be  held  responsible  for  any  damage occurred by the
[mis]use of this program.  Anyway it has been tested very carefully by many
people with different machines, and no problems have been found.

I  would be really glad if anyone who have tried Divumex sends me comments,
bugreports, or suggestions!

X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X New Features X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X/

Here follows a "what's new in there" list. I won't mention the countless
minor ones, which are anyway noticeable while playing.

- The game area is twice as long. Now the demo runs for nearly 11 minutes
  (if you ever manage to see it all without dying :) against the 5 minutes
  of Demo #1. I'll further enlarge it anyway.

- Now there's a score and an high score. The points per enemy rates are
  temporaneous and most probably they will be readjusted.

- Now the player has more than a single life. Previously the game ended as
  soon as you were hit.

- I added more new graphics, trying to add a 3d effect with shadows,
  embossing etc. I have to say that I'll heartily accept anybody willing to
  help me drawing graphics, mainly because I don't feel I'm an artist, and
  my drawings might have a poor quality.
  Obviously your submissions must resemble Xevious and respect some
  technical parameters which I'll promptly reveal to anybody interested.

- New enemies are present, both going by land and by air, and I even added
  some unvisible enemies which yield 500 points each when hit. To find
  them, just shoot when the crosshair turns red, not being any visible enemy
  under it.

- Enemy movements are slightly more complex now: while the previous version
  featured straightlined movements, now there are more smart routines to
  accomplish them. For instance, some aliens suddenly start moving after
  being still for a hile, other ones attack you and then quickly escape,
  other ones even try to avoid your bullets.

- Bullet movement is closer to reality. Enemy bullets always fly at the
  same speed now, regardless to the distance between them and your ship.

- The Start Screen has been replaced by one painted by Andrea Doimo.

- Upon demand I removed the 'wait until disk activity ends' requester,
  which was actually crashing under 1.3. If anybody knows how to implement
  such a thing still keeping 1.3 compatibility, in assembly, then please
  contact me.


/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\ Compatibility /X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\

This game requires Kick 2.0 at least. It has been successfully tested on
the following machines:

Amiga 1200 base
Amiga 1200 w/ fast ram
Amiga 3000
Amiga 4000

As  said before, it worked well but this does not implies that this program
is free of bugs!

The  game  should  work  on  68k  based  machines  too,  there shouldn't be
any compatibility trouble; anyway it might be slower at times.

I  couldn't  test  it  on any graphics card and I fear it won't work there.
Anyway I'd really thank anybody who can do it for me.

I  used Enforcer (by Michael Sinz) to check for suspicious memory accesses,
and none did happen.

In  case  of trouble, I'd really appreciate a rather exhaustive description
via  E-Mail  (or  fidonet  netmail).   A  message saying just "hey, it won't
work!" would be rather useless ;)



\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\ Warning \X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\

Divumex  may  be  installed  on  your  hard  disk.  Just note that it fully
disables  the  multitasking,  so  be  careful  there  isn't any disk/serial
accesses while you run the program!



\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\ Game Rules /X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X/

Fly.  Shoot.  Kill the aliens.  That's all.  :)

You  have  two  weapons:  air-to-air torpedoes and air-to-ground bombs.  At
every  click  of  the  joystick button, the ship will shoot one of both, the
former going upwards, the latter ending on the cross-target drawn above your
ship.

You can kill more than one ground target with a single shot, just target in
the middle.  Up to 4 objects can be hit!

When the blue cross target flies over a fireable object, it turns red.

At any time you can quit the game by clicking the left mouse button.



\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X Tecnichal Notes X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\

This  game has been written in 100% assembly, and by now it's made of nearly
11,000 source lines.

Maps  and  object  trajectors have been realized with a stand-alone program
made just for that purpose :)



/X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X To Do List \X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X\X/X\X\X\X/

Many things are still to be implemented yet, as pointed out before. I hope
to keep having enough time and will to accomplish it.
Anyway, being this a hobbyst and noprofit work, I can't guarantee that it
will SOON be 100%: I am stick to code only during my variable leisure time,
so please be patient. Moreover it's just me under all this stuff and as you
may guess, it's not easy, graphics being the hugest work.

Yet I promise to publish any new version, as long as major improvements are
operated.

What I *surely* add:

- Sound Effects (anybody having PD samples close to old Xevious' ones,
  please get in touch with me)

- New enemies

- New graphics

- New kind of bullets

Finally, I'd like to render the object movement even better and synchronize
animations and shootings (if you ever notice, land domes open and shoot in
two different moments, and this shouldn't happen).

Many of you asked for a End Level Alien. I won't tell it possible right
now, for it may slow down the whole game, being a big object to be moved on
the screen. I'm going to fix the most needed things first, but who knows?
