  Missile Command is released as beerware software.  That means if you're
  ever in Boulder, Colorado, you can buy me a beer for my efforts.  Enjoy,
  and Merry Christmas!


  HOW TO RUN THE GAME:
  --------------------

  Read the instructions in the intro.  Missile Command may be started from
  either CLI or Workbench.  If it fails to run, the program couldn't allocate
  all of the resources it needed and it aborted.  It needs all of the sprites,
  all sound channels, and 200K of chip RAM.

          ***********************************************************
          *                                                         *
          *  This is version 2.  The warning about sound that       *
          *  follows applies only to version 1.  I revamped my      *
          *  sound routines and ran them off the 60hz clock.  Much  *
          *  less interference with other stuff.                    *
          *                                                         *
          ***********************************************************

  *** WARNING, WILL ROBINSON! ***  Your system may crash if you run other
  sound stuff while Missile Command is running.  More than likely the sounds
  in Missile Command will simply repeat, because the sounds are interrupt
  driven.  To correct this, hit the "S" key twice to turn the sounds off, then
  on again (or simply leave them off).  I try to allocate the sound channels
  properly, so I can't explain why some sound stuff will run while Missile
  Command is running.  I get the channels with the lowest possible priority, 
  guaranteeing that I don't steal them from any other program, then I bump up
  the priority to maximum so other stuff won't steal from me.  If other sound
  stuff is running when you start Missile Command, it usually comes up with
  the sound turned off.  Beware of SoundTracker stuff, it'll lock up the
  computer.  If you want SoundTracker songs playing in the background, first
  start Missile Command, begin a game, turn the sound off, then start the
  SoundTracker song.  Once you turn off the sound in Missile Command, it
  remains off until turned back on.

  Oh yea, you may have to adjust your screen (PAL people disreguard this)
  because I print the scores and the sound on/off message at the very bottom
  of the screen.

  And make sure you run FF (fast fonts) before Missile Command.  This should
  speed up text output during the game.  The odds are your startup-sequence
  already runs FF.


  FEATURES:
  ---------
  
	* 100% assembler code, just over 7000 lines (not including the
	  Commodore include files), and 29K (the rest is graphic and sound
	  data).

	* Hires interlaced screen using only 2 bit planes.

	* 219 levels of parallax scrolling, and ... oh, I guess not, forget
	  that.

	* AmigaDos 2.0 compatible.

	* All events time based, playing at the same speed on all machines.

	* Multitasking.  Uses NO CPU TIME when paused, or when waiting for
	  player n to click to start.  Remember the "(Left_Amiga) N or M" to
	  flip between screens.  And for lots of fun, pull the workbench
	  screen down to reveal Missile Command running in the background.

	* A perfect gift for the holidays, and at just the right price.


  WHY WAS IT DONE?
  ----------------

  Who knows, really, it just sorta happened.  But seriously, sometimes you
  feel like a nut, and sometimes you don't, but wherever you go, there you
  are, so I made this game.  And there you have it, the whole story.


  WHEN WILL WE SEE MORE FROM MAX BITHEAD?
  ---------------------------------------

  Well, at least not until tomorrow, I'm kinda burned out, what with the
  holidays and all.  I kinda doubt it'll be that soon though.

  This has been an exercise in real-time sound and graphics programming on
  the Amiga Computer.  The best is yet to come.
