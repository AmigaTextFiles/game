AssaultCube 1.2.0.2 compiled for AROS i386

http://assault.cubers.net/

....:Requirements:....

- At least 256 MB of RAM
- Video card with hardware 3D acceleration
- At least 256 MB of Video RAM on video card, 512 MB of Video RAM recommended (*)
- mesa.library V18 or later, get it from AROS nightly build or from
   http://download.aros3d.org/releases/mesa.library-V18.0.zip and copy to LIBS:
- latest arosc.library, get it from AROS nightly build or from
   http://download.aros3d.org/releases/arosc.library-20110702.zip and copy to LIBS:

(*) - 512 MB VRAM is needed when all effects are turned on and high quality
textures are beeing used.


....:Installation:....

This archive contains everything, executable & data, so you don't need to download them seperately.
Just extract and play...


....:Running:....

If you run this program from the CLI, you *have* to set --init as option else the program uses the default screen value and fullscreen.
Notice that the game needs a lot of stack, at least 5000000 is required else the game/sdl/aros crashes.
The game is now also a lot bigger because libcurl/crypto/ssl was needed to compile it.


....:Options:....

--init - loads the init file out of the config dir. If not used, the >>>default<<< config is >>>always<<< used.
--protocol - shows the current protocol used in the game.
--loadmap= - loads a map.
--version - shows which version the program is.
--mod= - loads a mod.
--home= - sets the home directory.

....:Shaders/Fixed function:....

The game has two main rendering modes: OpenGL GLSL Shaders and OpenGL Fixed
Functions. The first mode will give much better visual quality effects, but
requires a more powerfull card to run. The mode is changes in Option->Gfx by
checking or unchecking []shaders option.

If you experience problems with rendering, you may try switching from shaders
mode (default) to fixed function mode.


Thanks to:

- Krzysztof 'Deadwood' Smiechowicz for compiling Cube/Cube2/AssaultCube in the first place.
- BSzili for pointing me in the right direction.
