@{b}Usage@{ub}


Wolf3D can be started via Icon from Workbench or from Shell.@{LINE}
Make sure, that the stack is set large enough, as I haven't compiled in any stack extension code.
An amount of 60KB should be large enough (if the game crashes, try to increase the stack).@{LINE}


The currently supported commandline/tooltype arguments are:@{LINE}

@{b}-fpu@{ub}@{LINDENT 26}                      Enable FPU routines
You should use that switch on a 68060 with FPU

@NODE HISTORY "What has changed"
@SMARTWRAP
@{b}History@{ub}


@{i}The following text is from the original readme by Sebastian:@{ui}


 I have started porting this game in summer 1998. But I gave up after
a week, because the sources was a big mess. Couple of days ago, I have
found a Linux port (made by Steven Fuller <relnev@atdot.org>, and can be found at
http://jcs.jsteintech.com/wolf3d/), which was far better than the Id sources
(all the crapy 16 bit Borland C references was removed ;) And I started again.@{LINE}
This is what I get after two sleepless nights.


v0.15@{LINE}
        - I have added too much swaping routines last time ;)@{LINE}
          Sprites graphics was screwed. Fixed.@{LINE}
        - It also seems that I have fixed the 'palette shifting bug'.@{LINE}
          Belive me, it was not me! It just started to work.@{LINE}
        - much faster (11fps full screen on 040/25)@{LINE}

v0.1@{LINE}
        - added a lot of byte swaping routines, which fixes almost@{LINE}
          all known bugs. All menu options are working now.@{LINE}
        - Saveing & loading game now works.@{LINE}
        - Added faster drawing routines.@{LINE}
        - still only Wolfenstein3D demo files works with this release.@{LINE}

v0.01   (initial release)@{LINE}
        - just compiled the source.@{LINE}
        - There is a lot of limitations:@{LINE}
           1) it is only working with Wolf3D demo data files@{LINE}
              (ftp://ftp.gamers.org/pub/games/wolf3d/official/1wolf14.zip)@{LINE}
              THOSE FILES MUST BE INSTALLED ON pEEcEE FIRST!!!@{LINE}
              Version for registereed data, and also for 'Spear of Destiny'@{LINE}
              soon. This will be different executables for every version@{LINE}
              of data or (if I get enough time) one executable.@{LINE}
           2) Game can crash in any moment. Also some of the menu options@{LINE}
              does not works (like 'read this' in main menu).@{LINE}
        - It is not as fast as I expected. Some additional optimizations@{LINE}
          are still required.@{LINE}
        - no sound at all.@{LINE}
        - save game does not work. (or maybe does? loading@{LINE}
                                    does not work for sure ;)@{LINE}
        - Only keyboard control works. Mouse & Joystick is not supported.


@{i}Now that's what I (Christian) have done:@{ui}


I also started a port some time ago, but stopped working on it as the original sources
by Id were just too bad...
