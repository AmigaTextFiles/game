         ------------------------------------------------------------

In the Issue of November 1993 of Amiga Format (The best magazine about Amiga!),
there were a disk with Blitz Basic (I think it's good and fast and easy and ...
but I always prefer AMOS!) and some examples of games made by Blitz. Among
these there were Zombie Apocalypse and when I saw it I told me: "When I have
free time, I want to make something like this!". And I did it: after my last
four games I realized FANTASY. I could copy Zombie ... at all, but I prefered
to change some things and the result is a new game!
To play it is very easy: you just need to own a mouse and you have to be fast
moving it. There are, in this version, only 4 different level-screens, but I'm
going to draw a lot of other ones for the next versions. Moving  the mouse you
must go over the enemies and then FIRE!!! Be careful: the monster who walk
along the screen must be hit 3 times (otherways the game was too easy!)

To realize the game I spent just 3 days (3 hours per day) and my biggest matter
was to realize the screens (I'm not a good painter!). So if you Have a picture
that can be useful for me, please send me.
If you like it or you often use it, please send me 10.000 italian liras and
you'll receive the next versions and all my other games.

For AMOS Users:
The game is entirely realized in AMOS The Creator. It was compiled to be
independent from the Amos editor and so you can give it to everybody.
If you want the source code, please send me a blank disk.
