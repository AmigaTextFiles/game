Bomb Maniac,
===========

A two player game. You will need two Joystics to play this game.
=================
Push fire and move the Joystick to put down a Bomb.
The purpose of the game is to kill the other player. (Not very Original,
but fun).

There is also an editor that is activated when you press 'e' on the
keyboard. Move around one guy and press F1-F5 to choose between
wall,stone,etc and then press fire on the joystick.

Use arrow up and arrow down to change level and 'RETURN' to put level into
the memory of the computer.

This Program was written one Weekend when we were bored.
If you like to have the source code (Assembler) or just like the game 
please write to us, or send me a mail.

Unfortunatley we have lost the version with sampled sound but if anyone
is interested we might find it.
Have fun,
