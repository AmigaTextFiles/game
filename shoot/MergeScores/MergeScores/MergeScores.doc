-==============================================-


Ever had two (or more) sets of high scores for MegaBall and wanted
to combine them into one?  Well, then this is for you!  This program
combines two high score tables into one, ignoring duplicate scores.
This means then you and your friend (say) can each take a copy of
the high score table, play it a bit and then recombine the tables
without all the top scores appearing twice.


Usage - From a Shell/CLI window:

MergeScores  <table1> <table2> <outputtable>

    - where <table1> is the filename of the first Megaball high score table
            <table2> is the filename of the second one
            <outputtable> is the filename of the combined one
            

Note: I recommend copying the two input tables to RAM: and then combining
them there - this prevents you accidentally erasing all your hard work :-)


When the output table has been created, rename it to "MegaBall3.scores"
(without the quotes of course) and put it back in the Megaball directory.
Then it should work!


That's it really - not very tricky.  If you like it - great!  Send me a
postcard to say so!  And if you like MegaBall, REGISTER it - it is
SHAREWARE and deserves to be.  Well done Ed and Al Mackey for showing
everyone how it should be done.


Source is included, but it's not very tricky - probably nobody else could
be bothered to write it.  Compile with Dice with:

   "dcc mergescores.c -o MergeScores"
   
and you should have no problems.
