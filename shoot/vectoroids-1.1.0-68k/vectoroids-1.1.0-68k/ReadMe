Vectoroids 1.1.0

--- about ------------------------------------------------------------------

    "Vectoroids" is a vector-based rock-shooting game similar to the
    arcade classic "Asteroids."  It is an SDL game based on the source for
    "Agendaroids," an X-Window game written for the Agenda VR3 Linux-based 
    PDA written by the same author.

    (This game is being entered into the "SDL Game Under 1 Megabyte" 
    contest held by No Starch Press / Loki Entertainment Software in late 
    2001.)

    The AmigaOS version is basically a simple compile, but with
    a few enhancements for the sound output.


--- requirements -----------------------------------------------------------

    - AmigaOS 3.0.0+
    - SDL.library
    - CGX or P96


--- usage ------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Simple start from icon.


--- controls ---------------------------------------------------------------
   
    The game can be played with either the keyboard, or a joystick/pad 
    (which I highly recommend).
   

    * [Left] / [Right] on the keyboard
      [Left] / [Right] on the joystick

      Rotate ship counter-clockwise and clockwise, respectively.


    * [Up] on the keyboard
      [Fire-B] or [UP] on the joystick

      Thrusts the ship in the direction it is currently facing.


    * [Space] on the keyboard
      [Fire-A] on the joystick

      Fires a bullet in the direction the ship is facing.


    * [Shift] on the keyboard

      Re-spawns your ship after you die, even if the game thinks there
      are still too many asteroids near the center of the screen...


--- status display ---------------------------------------------------------

    The following is displayed at the top of the screen during the game,
    from left to right:

    * Score

      Your current score.


    * Level

      The level of the game you are currently playing.


    * Lives

      Miniature spaceships which represent how many extra lives you have 
      left.


    Also, sometimes text (for example, what level you are on when you enter
    a new level) appears on the center of the screen for a moment.


--- scoring ----------------------------------------------------------------

    Each rock you shoot (or crash into) gains you points.  The smaller the
    rock, the more points you gain.

    Every 10,000 points, you also receive an extra ship.


--- levels -----------------------------------------------------------------

    After all rocks have been destroyed, you move on to the next level,
    which begins with more rocks than the previous started with...



--- full credits/ license/ source ------------------------------------------

    Full credits and the license (vectoroids is released under the GPL)
    you find inside the docu/ directory which contains the unmodified
    original documentation.

    Full source with all changes is in the source/ directory.





Happy asteroids-shooting!
