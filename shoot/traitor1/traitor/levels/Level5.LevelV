The two hostages from Dallas never made their 
escape and have now defected onto the enemies side. 
They had considerable knowledge of our attack forces 
and therefore must be killed before they unveil all of 
their information. It is known that they are now in the city 
of Austin although we know not their exact 
location so you must kill everyone to be sure that 
you've got them.
