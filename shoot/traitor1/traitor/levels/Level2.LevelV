Recently two of our men have been captured by the enemy 
and will be interigated once a high ranking officer arrives in the city. 
Your mission is to rescue the hostages and also 
to retrieve some grenades from one of the buildings so that 
we can examine them and begin making our own. 
Its currently raining in Dallas but that shouldn`t hamper you mission much.
