Oh dear. That last mission didn't go to well did it? 
The americans have now converted Middlesbrough into 
a base of operations. This will cause a considerable 
threat to our people in the surrounding areas. 
Therefore something must be done about it. 
Middlesbrough now contains a building that they use as a store. 
Without this building our intelligence tells us 
that the enemy would most probably leave the area. 
Therefore your mission is to destroy the newly built store at the edge of the town.
