     I know it's not super (my newer stuff is much better) but if you
                     get into it, it's very enjoyable.

Do not move Fonts. They should be left where they are.

a problem)

I think it needs 2 Meg CHIP RAM. Not AGA though.

It was made a fair few years ago but I just got onto the net so here it
is.

Sorry but GFX card users with less than 2 meg chip may not be able to run
it. I've no time to fix this, sorry. Maybe in the next version....
