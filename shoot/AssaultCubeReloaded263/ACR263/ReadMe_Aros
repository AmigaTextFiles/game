AssaultCube Reloaded 2.6.3 compiled for AROS i386

http://acr.victorz.ca

This new version is now based on the 1.2 branch of Assaultcube. Previous ones were based
on the 1.0 branch. So some things might or might not work.
The first time ACR starts *and* after changing the windowsize it saves some values in
different 'shadow.dat' files. This can take a while. Be patient.
The game might be a bit too dark for some. That's because the gamma can't be adjusted, it
can't even be set on linux with SDL 1.3+, so you either have to find a way to adjust the gamma
under AROS or set the monitor a bit lighter.


....:Requirements:....

- At least 256 MB of RAM
- Video card with hardware 3D acceleration
- At least 256 MB of Video RAM on video card, 512 MB of Video RAM recommended (*)

(*) - 512 MB VRAM is needed when all effects are turned on and high quality
textures are beeing used.


....:Installation:....

This archive contains everything, executable & data, so you don't need to download them seperately.
Just extract and play...

....:Running:....

You can use the program from the CLI, but then you *have* to set --init as option else the program uses
the default screen value and fullscreen. Or double click the program icon.
Notice that the game needs a lot of stack, at least 5000000 is required else the game/sdl/aros crashes.
This version has a working multiplayer option. If you don't see any servers in the serverlist,
just press F5 a few times until 1 or more show up.

....:Options:....

--init - loads the init file out of the config dir. If not used, the >>>default<<< config is >>>always<<< used.
--protocol - shows the current protocol used in the game.
--loadmap= - loads a map.
--version - shows which version the program is.
--mod= - loads a mod.
--home= - sets the home directory.


....:Shaders/Fixed function:....

The game has two main rendering modes: OpenGL GLSL Shaders and OpenGL Fixed
Functions. The first mode will give much better visual quality effects, but
requires a more powerfull card to run. The mode is changes in Option->Gfx by
checking or unchecking []shaders option.

If you experience problems with rendering, you may try switching from shaders
mode (default) to fixed function mode.
