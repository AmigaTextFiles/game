@Node "intro" "Introduction"

@{u}Introduction@{uu}


@{i}Demolicious@{ui} is a tool to edit Quake demos. My clan members recorded some demos
but we weren't able to edit them on Amiga, so I decided to write such a tool.
I was inspired by the PC demo editor @{i}FilmAt11@{ui}. But it needed LOTS of memory
and was happily crashing sometimes. I hope my program is stable and user-friendly.

@{i}Demolicious@{ui} is distributed under the publicly known concept of Freeware. Yes,
you don't have to pay anything to use it! No crippled features! You can let me
know your likes, dislikes or suggestions at any time, but I can't promise
to implement them all because I am at the end of my study ;-)



Note: You can record such demos by typing "record <demoname>" in the Quake
console, and "stop" to stop recording. In multiplayer games, issue the record
command BEFORE you connect to the server!

@Node "requirements" "Requirements"

@{u}Requirements@{uu}


@{i}Demolicious@{ui} requires at least:

  - MUI 3.8

  - 68020 CPU

  - Since Quake demos are usually rather large (about 1MB, but they
    can also be many MBs, e.g. 10MB or 20MB), you'll need a lot of RAM.
    You'll do fine with 16MB or more.


@Endnode
@Node "install" "Installation"

@{u}Installation@{uu}


Copy the program to your harddrive. Copy the MUI classes into your MUI:Libs/mui
directory (unless you have newer versions of these already there).


@Endnode
@Node "features" "Features"

@{u}Features@{uu}


  - @{i}Demolicious@{ui} is Freeware!

  - Cut/Copy/Paste to/from clipboard -> edit across multiple instances
    of the program

  - Insert text or sounds

  - Split multi-level demos

  - Stopwatch, to find specific passages while playing a demo with Quake

  - It's the first Quake demo editor for the Amiga ;-)


@Endnode
@Node "menus" "Menus"

@{u}Menus@{uu}


  @{i}Project@{ui}

    Open                Load a demo.

    Save                Save the demo - a filerequester will pop up.

    Split demo          Split a multi-level demo into separate files.
                        Select this right after you have loaded the multi-level
                        demo.

    About...            Show information about this program and the author.

    About MUI...        Show the MUI about requester.

    Quit                Quit the program.


  @{i}Edit@{ui}

    Cut                 Cut selected entries to the clipboard (unit 1).

    Copy                Copy selected entries to the clipboard.

    Paste               Insert clipboard into the list, in front of the selected
                        entry.
    ---

    Find Message        Find text in blocks, starting from the selected entry.
                        Only message types "Print", "Centerprint", "Finale",
                        "Cutscene" and "Sound" are searched.

    Insert Message      Insert a new message before the currently selected
                        message in the block-analyzer window.
                        Here is more information on @{" message types " link "msgtypes"}.

    Delete Messages     Delete messages marked in the block-analyzer window.


  @{i}View@{ui}

    Stopwatch           Show the @{" stopwatch " link "stopwatch"}.

    Block Analyzer      Show the messages of the active block.
                        Here is more information on @{" message types " link "msgtypes"}.

    Refresh             Refresh the blocklist and the analyzer window.


  @{i}Settings@{ui}

    Display Sounds      Toggle whether played sounds should be displayed in
                        the blocklist.

    MUI...              Open the MUI settings window for this application.


@Endnode
@Node "gadgets" "Main window gadgets"

@{u}Main window gadgets@{uu}


@{i}(Filename)@{ui}

  Here's the full path and the filename of the currently loaded demo.


@{i}CD Audio Track@{ui}

  Enter here the number of the audio track which should be played during
  the demo. 1 = track 1, 2 = track 2, and so on. Use a value of -1 to
  indicate that you want the default audio track here.


@{i}Mark Range@{ui}

  Because a demo can have tens of thousands of blocks, you can mark large
  ranges here. Enter the starting block number into the left field and
  the ending block number into the right field. Press the "Mark Range"
  button to mark your desired range.

  You can also double-click a block from the listview. The ending block
  number of the intended range becomes the selected block's number. The
  previous ending number becomes the new starting block number.
  (In other words, the value from the right field will move to the left field,
  while the right field is set to the double-clicked entry.)


@{i}Blocks-Listview@{ui}

  The huge list of blocks is shown here. It is divided into three columns:
  Block number, the block's timestamp (or nothing if there is no timestamp in
  this block), and some printable contents of the block.
  You can double-click an entry to mark a larger range (see above).


@{i}Status bar@{ui}

  It is showing information on what @{i}Demolicious@{ui} is currently doing.


@Endnode
@Node "stopwatch" "Stopwatch"

@{u}How to use the stopwatch@{uu}


First, open the stopwatch window by selecting its @{" menuitem " link "menus"}.
It'll show a hh:mm:ss:hs timer, displaying hours, minutes, seconds and
hundredth seconds. The buttons work just like a normal stopwatch in real
life :-)

  @{i}Start@{ui}         Start the timer.

  @{i}Stop@{ui}          Stop it.

  @{i}Reset@{ui}         Set it to to first timestamp encountered in the demo.

  @{i}Add mark@{ui}      Add the current time to the listview.

  @{i}Delete mark@{ui}   Remove the selected entry.

  @{i}Clear marks@{ui}   Clear the listview.


But what is this stopwatch for, you may ask. The idea is here:

It may often happen that you have loaded a large demo. Let's assume you now
want to cut all scenes with no action in it. So you can run Quake in a
window on the workbench, and play the demo there. Have @{i}Demolicious@{ui}
next to the Quake window. After you type "playdemo <demoname>" in Quake's
console, Quake will load the demo and play it.
Now you can watch the demo, and if a nice scene occurs, hit the @{i}Add mark@{ui}
button at the beginning and at the end of the scene! So you can have marks
for your scenes, making it easy to find them in the main listview!

Selecting an entry will skip to the block with the timestamp nearest to the
start-time of the selected entry.


@Endnode
@Node "msgtypes" "Message types"

@{u}Message types@{uu}


A Quake demo is made up of thousands of blocks. Each block contains several
messages. All message types are explained here:


Bad               Should never appear.

Nop               No operation.

Disconnect        This message is appearing once per demo, too, and it must be
                  at the very end.

Updatestat        Update player stats, e.g. ammo, secrets, killed monsters, etc.

Version           Server version, should be 0x0f (15).

Setview           Set camera position to an entity's origin.

Sound             Play a sound, bound to an entity.

Time              Timestamp.

                  Team-talks and Public-talks are shown with this message, too.

Stufftext         Insert quake commands, e.g. "color 0 13".

Setangle          Camera orientation.

Serverinfo        A demo has this message exactly one time. It must be in the
                  very first block of the demo. All entities are named here,
                  that is, the map name, models, sounds, and internal entities.

Lightstyle        Define a lightstyle. 'a' is black and 'z' is white.

Updatename        Update a player's name.

Updatefrags       Update a player's frags counter.

Damage            Damage origin and strength.

Spawnstatic       Spawn a static entity.

Spawnbinary       Obsolete.

Spawnbaseline     Create a dynamic entity.

Temp_entity       Temporary entity, e.g. spikes, explosions, beams.

Setpause          Set the pause state.

Signonum          Select client state.

Centerprint       This text is shown in the center of Quake's display.
                  These are usually welcome-messages, or status messages,
                  like "Your flag has been taken!".

Killedmonster     Death of a monster.

Foundsecret       Player enters a secret area.

Spawnstaticsound  A sound is played (bound to coordinates, e.g. atmosphere).

Intermission      Display level end screen.

Finale            This text is shown at the end of an episode.

CDTrack           Play a range of CD audiotracks.

Sellscreen        Help/Sell screen.

Cutscene          Similar to Finale, appeared in Mission pack #1.

Updateentity      Update every dynamic entity in the player's sight. It contains
                  only the changed values.

  - Rethink timestamps
  - Perhaps: recalculate demo from another player's view
  - don't cut essential messages (e.g. Updatefrags, updateColor)
  - 3D wireframe/solid preview (with Warp3D support)
    This feature is not sure to be implemented.
  - Insert more message-types than currently supported
