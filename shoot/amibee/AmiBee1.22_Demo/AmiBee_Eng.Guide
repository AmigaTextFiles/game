@NODE SHORT "What Is AmiBee ??"

@{b}WHAT IS AMIBEE ??@{ub}

@{b}AMIBEE@{ub} is a conversion for Amiga of the famous videogame @{b}TwinBee@{ub} by Konami.

It's a nice vertical shooter  featuring a cute character flying and firing to
everything in the screen (white carrots, etc.) trying to collect  color bells
(covered by smiling clouds) which bounces when you fire them. It's like a mix
between Hybris and Galaga, but featuring anime graphics (japanese cartoons).

I played the original game (TwinBee) on MSX, PC-Engine, SNES and then PSX, but
as no one  had plans to release it for Amiga, I decided to  write myself  this
conversion.

I recently contacted  a mister who is professional cartoon designer (handmade)
in my country. He liked the videogame idea, and he  told me that if I get good
reactions  from the scene he would  paint some  quality cartoon animations for
AmiBee, mainly to support peruvian development. As I know, AmiBee is the first
videogame of any kind, in any platform  and in any programming  language being
completed and  spreaded outside this country. Other local productions, also by
@{b}Twin Eagles Group@{ub}, were spreaded on the Commodore 64 scene, but that is
another story...

The in-game music, composed by me (using fantastic Teijo's SoundStudio!), is
actually the theme from C=64's "Neuromancer" game (originally by Devo).
The real name of the track is @{b}"Some Things Never Changes"@{ub}, and it's on their
album "Total Devo" (thanks to Paul Trauth for this tip).

If AMIBEE get reviewed in a print-magazine, disk-mag, online magazine or any
other publishing form, I would be grateful if you inform me about it.

I hope you'll like AmiBee Demo. Check @{"Program History" LINK HISTO} to see which features
were included in this release, and consider to @{"support" LINK REGIS} a work in progress :-)

@{b}AmiBee Development Information@{ub}

Programmed with Blitz 2.1
Graphics made/rearranged with Personal Paint 6.4
Music/SFX composed with SoundStudio v1.03c

Other stuff used: DSS8+ sound sampler.

@NODE REGIS "Supporting Development"

@{b}AmiBee is SHAREWARE.@{ub}

I spent most of my time planning, coding, music composing, painting, testing
the playability (even recording on VHS the game to check it in  the nights).
I redo the whole first level many times to gain better play feeling and alien
formations. After release 1.0, I was working on Level 2 which now includes new
graphics, new enemies, a new end-of-level boss and other features.

AmiBee is a @{b}Work In Progress@{ub}. I'll be releasing progressively new versions
as they are completed. Please, consider to @{b}support AmiBee development@{ub} by
registering to it.

You can send the @{b}registration fee@{ub} to the @{"author" LINK CONTA} in any of these currencies:

Ammount: @{b}10 US$ (ten US-Dollars)@{ub}

Nowadays Rate of Exchange accepted:

  - £    (British Pounds)
  - Dm   (German Marks)
  - Lit. (Italian Lire)
  
Please, use the included @{"Registration Form" LINK RFORM} for easiness.

@{b}IMPORTANT NOTE: LEVEL 2 is Already Available !!!@{ub}
                Fly above mountains, sky and  forest against savage animals
                like  squirrels, chicks, ducks, pigs,... and reach  the sea
                where the Three Little Barks, driving a Barko (a big flying
                ship) will try to stop you from saving Lady Akiko!!!

@{b}Public Distribution@{ub}

Improvements for public distribution will be @{b}only@{ub} and @{b}always@{ub} related to
the @{b}First Level@{ub}. Occasionally new stuff may be improved or added, but
you'll able to play only Level 1. If someday you wish a recently version you'll
need to pay an extra registration fee :-(
                                             
@{b}Registered User@{ub}

Registering is done obviously only @{b}one time@{ub}. You'll then receive @{b}privately@{ub}
future @{b}updates@{ub} and @{b}new levels@{ub} as they are completed.
If a major version is to be released, you'll be informed about preferential
discounts. Also, you'll have special low prices for other products I may
release in the future.

@ENDNODE



@NODE PLAYN "Playing AmiBee"

@{b}PLAYING AMIBEE...@{ub}

@{b}THE COLOR BELLS@{ub}

Yellow bell (Points!)   ... Progressively Extra Point (+500)
Celest bell (Speed-Up!) ... Progressively improves AmiBee movement
Green  bell (Power-Up!) ... Progressively improves AmiBee shooting
                            and then change to next Weapon!
White  bell (Shield!)   ... Activate Shield (20 seconds)
Red    bell (Beam-Up!)  ... Extra FireBeam
Black  bell (Damage!)   ... AmiBee lose his arms.
                            Next time hits Black bell, will lose one life.

- Shooting bells many times will randomly change the color.
- Collecting bells will give you points.

@{b}THE FLYING BASKET@{ub}

You'll notice a colorful flying basket with two white wings which sometimes(?)
crosses the screen. By wisely shoting bells, you must try to put them into the
Flying Basket. You'll hear then a score sound which signals you collected it.

- Each Bell scored will give you extra point.
- Collecting @{b}10 bells@{ub} (whatever color) will give you an @{b}Extra Live@{ub}.

@{b}THE FLYING AMBULANCE@{ub}

When AmiBee lose his arms for the first time, a Flying Ambulance will appear.
Entering there you'll recover the arms, allowing you to launch bombs again.

@{b}IN-GAME KEYS and JOYSTICK@{ub}

JOY          = AmiBee movement
JOY Button 1 = AmiBee shoot
JOY Button 2 = AmiBee bomb  (if you don't have Button#2 then use the keyboard)

Cursors    = AmiBee movement
Left ALT   = AmiBee shoot
Left AMIGA = AmiBee bomb

F1  = will Pause the game. Again, "F1" key will continue the game.
ESC = will stop the current game and return you to the IntroMenu screen.

@{b}GENERAL TIPS@{ub}

- When you begin each Level you'll notice the fast background scrolling while
  flying above the trees. Collect as fast as you can  useful Bells to improve
  AmiBee performance.

- Staying at the screen borders can be very dangerous sometimes!

- Try to learn enemies movement, hit-resistance, speed...

- Pay attention when AmiBee is flying under a the Clouds. Many times there
  can be enemies bullets under them!

- Don't wast your time collecting White Bells as they doesn't work yet :-(

- Don't press fire button like crazy. The secret is to calculate/anticipate
  the right moment to shoot, one by one, each enemy.

- If you feel too much "delay" (slowness) when AmiBee is shooting, try
  collecting more Green Bells.

- Keep the fire button pressed for few seconds to prepare the FireBeam.

- If you feel AmiBee moves too slow, try collecting more Blue Bells.

- You must learn to shot Bells only when necessary, and not continuosly!
  In this way you'll can wisely drive their bounce and put them into the
  Flying Basket.

- Beware of Black Bells! If you hit them AmiBee will lose his arms.
  To get back arms you'll need to enter to the Flying Ambulance.

- Extra lives are hidden in some levels.

If you have some questions or new ideas, don't hesitate to contact me.

@NODE CREDI "Credits..."

Alex Mena      -  For lending me his PC-Engine and TwinBee cardgame
Mighty Wolfie  -  For T.E.G. introduction logo
Mopz/NC Gamez  -  For the "Level_Complete" music, and being a good pal
Skid/Ozone     -  For converting original AmiBee readme to AmigaGuide
Tolkien        -  For translating AmigaGuide to Spanish

Special Notes:

"Game_Over" music taken from a CD compilation. It's an  arrangement of the old
C=64 classic Commando's hi-score (originally composed by Rob Hubbard). I don't
know who made this Amiga arrangement, but it seem was Hydra ?

"End-Of-Level Boss" music (Astrological Mix) composed by Nao/Lemon (in 1993),
found in a CD compilation. I tried to contact him, but I failed. I hope he
doesn't get angry for using his module, but it was perfect for the boss!  ;-)

Graphics for Level 2 were taken directly from PC-Engine TwinBee and used
in AmiBee, but  anyway they were  rearranged and improved when possible.
I'm good with 2D drawing but I can't do  everything! If someone  want to
help me drawing some graphics for next levels, please contact me.
