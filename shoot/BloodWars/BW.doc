	We Take No Warranty to anything this program may cause. The excact playing instructions and docs
	may or may not be included with future versions of Bloodwars The Ultimate Plagiate Warlords Game.



	PLEASE NOTE!

	This game is honest plagiate, and made just for fun. Other reason that may come to mind might be the
	frustration on so called "commercial games".

	About The Game

	Movement:

	In order to join units use numeric pad, or define the movement route so that it crosses the units to
	be joined, by clicking map behind the target unit.

	Moving from ship to land has slight delay while the computer thinks the route. It is going to be
	fixed in the future.

	If the defined movement route crosses units that are not to be joined, simply answer no and use the
	numeric pad, yet again.
	
	Once the route has been defined use the move gadget on following round until the destination is reached.

	Combat:

	The game will organize stacks by placing the unit with greatest Attack Value to the right, with some
	exceptions: Ship is always the last unit, then come Princes and Kings, then Mages (and other spell
	casters), then other carry units like dragons and pegasi.

	Quests:

	Only Princes and Kings may take a Quest (that is a Event, the name Quest is a bit misleading).

	Items:

	Items found from events are usable only if stack contains a Prince or a King, though all units are able
	to carry them.

	Wieving army:

	Click active  army or the split gadget.

	
	THIS IS ONLY BETA TESTING VERSION!

	DO NOT USE COMPUTER OPPONENTS OR SENTRY MODE. And even if you want to try them, be careful, The GURU
	is coming etc.

	The Game will teach the players as we see it.

	
	Enjoy!
