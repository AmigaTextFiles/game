   Why ? may be the first question you ask after playing this game,
or maybe it shouldn't really be called a game, 'massacre' fits the
bill more appropriately. Anyway, there's no point to the game, but
I hope you enjoy playing it.

   Using the keys F1-F7 selects the weapon with which you wish to
kill the Nerds with. The keys are as follows : -

F1      Shotgun                 F2      Uzi 9mm
F3      Rocket launcher         F4      Roller
F5      Drop a mine             F6      Overkill button
F7      Nerd panic mode

ESC     Quit game or select number of nerds. (pause)


   When the game is paused, pressing ESC again will quit the game and
   return to Workbench or the shell.

   The function keys F1 to F10 are used to select the number of Nerds
   to kill. Once this is done, press space to start a
   new game with the number of nerds you selected. The higher the number
   of nerds selected in a level may slow the game down a bit, depending
   on how powerful your machine is. The game starts with a default number
   of nerds being 50. At this number of nerds the game will run pretty
   smoothly on any Amiga.

Final note:

   This game is freeware so you can copy it and spread it throughout
the Cosmos.
