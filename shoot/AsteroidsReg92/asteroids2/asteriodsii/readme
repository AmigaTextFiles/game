SHORT:Asteroids for OS2.0+ systems

This archive contains both a Freeware asteroids clone and the
extended Shareware AsteriodsII game (limited to level 5).

Version 0.92 of AsteriodsII requires:
i)   OS2.0+
ii)  iffparse.library
iii) all game fonts in a FONTS: assigned directory 
iv)  500k memory (300k chip)

The game creates the following files in the current directory:
i)   'keydefinitions'  stores custom key assignments
ii)  'options'         stores game options
iii) 'highscores'      stores high score list


If you have registered for AsteriodsII and have not been offered
v0.95, get in contact with me.


IMPORTANT!  

In the v0.95 release, the game may be played upon any workbench
supported screen.  Foolishly, I made the 'workbench clone' screen
mode the default, so people with 640x200 screens wont see all
option screens, (and the game may crash under 3.0).  To fix this,
just go to the options screen and press <T>, to change screen type,
and immediately exit.  This will allow you to set up the options
you wish to save.
