Thanks! IKE

------------------------------------------------------------
Installation:

Just place your .PAK files in the 'id1' folder.  They must be located in this folder
for the program to find them and run.
------------------------------------------------------------
Running Quake:

Type this in a Shell:

stack 500000
sdlquake-MOS

or double click on the icon...

Requires networking to be running for game to start...
------------------------------------------------------------
Not Tested (but compiled in):

CD Music Support 
Network Support/LAN games
------------------------------------------------------------
Known Bugs:

1. It may be necessary to delete the config.cfg file out of the id1 directory
(once it's been created) if the program is not terminated properly.
As the program will hang while trying to find and load this file even though
it is present...
------------------------------------------------------------
How to recompile:

1. compile all the c sources in the src directory as object files with the -c option

gcc -c *.c

2. build the binary and link to the required libraries

gcc *.o -lSDL -ldebug -lpthread -lm -o sdlquake-MOS
------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
Compiled using:  MorphOS DevKit 3.12, gcc 2.95.3 and Gabriele's SDL dev kit 1.2.6
