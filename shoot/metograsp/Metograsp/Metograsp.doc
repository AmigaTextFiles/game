1.   SOMETHING JURIDICAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Metograsp is freeware. The author claims all rights. Metograsp can be
     freely copied, if all files are included (see below) and unchanged.
     The author will not be liable for any material and sanitary damages 
     which arise by the use of METOGRASP.


2.   SOMETHING TECHNICAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Following files should be present :

     1.  Metograsp             (the program) 
     2.  Metograsp.info
     3.  exp.raw               (soundfile)
     4.  fire.raw              (soundfile) 
     5.  sin.raw               (soundfile)
     6.  splash.raw            (soundfile)
     7.  thrust.raw            (soundfile)
     8.  Metograsp.dok         (german documentation)
     9.  Metograsp.dok.info    
     10. Metograsp.doc         (english documentation)
     11. Metograsp.doc.info    

     INSTALLATION :
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Copy the files where you want, ready !
     The soundfile and the program must be present in the same directory.

     The program starts from the workbench by clicking on its icon, or 
     from the CLI by typing the name of the program. Metograsp should 
     run on every PAL-Amiga from OS 1.3. A second player and a joystick 
     are needed !


3.   SCENARIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     As Pilots of space-gliders, you and your partner are somewhere on a
     surface, which is equivalent to a torus. A dodecahedron, which is the
     center of gravitation, exerts a graviation force to the gliders and
     the torpedos.
     Destroy the enemy glider and do not smash at the dodecahedron !


4.   OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Player-1  --->  Joystick in port-1
     Player-2  --->  Keyboard

    
4.1  THE REQUESTER 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     After starting the program a requester appears.
     The three sections :
     
       a) Highscore
       b) Gravitation control
       c) Quit and start

     A selected gadget has a blinking border. With <cursor/joystick left>,
     <cursor/joystick right>, <cursor/joystick up> and <cursor/joystick
     down> you can switch between the gadgets. With <cursor/joystick left>
     and <cursor/joystick right> you can adjust the gravitation when the 
     gravitation-gadget is selected :

       0 yellow Blocks  =  no gravitation
                        .
                        .
                        .
                        .
       5 yellow blocks  =  very strong gravitation

     Select the quit-gadget to finish or the start-gadget to start the
     game and press <joystick-button> or <return>.

     The winner is marked with a yellow and white blinking block in his
     row. By exceeding more than 25 points the counting starts again 
     from 0.   


4.2  THE COCKPIT 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     The screen is divided in two cockpits. Player-1 uses the upper,
     player-2 the lower cockpit.

     CURSOR CONTROLS :
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       Cursor left      --->  Rotate left
       Cursor right     --->  Rotate right
       Cursor down      --->  Thrust
       Cursor up        --->  Fire torpedo

     JOYSTICK CONTROLS :
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       Joystick left    --->  Rotate left
       Joystick right   --->  Rotate right
       Joystick up      --->  Thrust
       Joystick button  --->  Fire torpedo
  
     ADDITIONAL CONTROLS :
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       ESC              --->  Abort the game   

   
     THE INSTRUMENTS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT :
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     1)  The torpedo display shows the available number of torpedos. Only
         five torpedos can be active. After their time of activation has
         ended the stock will be refilled again. The result of a hit is a
         white window of the damaged glider.

     2)  The energy display shows the available amount of energy. The 
         thrust control diminishes the amount a little, a hit much more.
         If a hit subtracts more energy as is available, the glider ex-
         plodes.   

     3)  The red bar shows the distance from the center of gravitation.
         A high bar indicates small (!) distance from the dodecahedron.

     4)  This is the veloctity display. If the yellow bar exceeds the 
         upper bound, the glider explodes.


4.3  FURTHER DIRECTIONS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Other objects are only made for orientation. (You must find out in
     which sense !)

     Because of the little velocity of the torpedos you can be hit by
     your own if your veloctity is to high. To avoid this do not fire
     "forward".

     The range of sight is greater at the edge of the window. This has
     only technical reasons which I will not explain here.
