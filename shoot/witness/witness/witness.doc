                            GAME INSTRUCTIONS
                            -----------------

The Solar System has been invaded by an alien fleet, the only planet still
free is Earth. You must free eight planets of the Solar System (including
a ringless Saturn, due to memory restrictions). To do so you have to destroy
all enemies in each planet and protect small friendly civilian-shuttles that
fly around randomly, avoiding to be captured by enemy transport-shuttles.

To choose a planet, simply move the cursor over it and info relative to that
planet will be provided. Level 1 planets are EASY, Level 2 MEDIUM and
Level 3 HARD. Press fire to play the choosen planet.

Once in the planet you'll be able to see the score board. This consists of
the player/hi scores, the number of lives (small yellow shuttles),
smart bombs/energy (red bombs) and a scanner, where you can see the whole
planet. The small red dots are the alien ships, the white dots are the
small civilian shuttles and the white star in the middle is your ship.
Once all enemies (excluding enemy tranport-shuttles) are gone, the planet is
freed.
Some of the bigger aliens leave bonus when they die, allowing you to
collect bonus points (every 25,000 points you get an extra life), increase
your weapon power or change weapon. You start with a normal-laser (orange)
and can increase to ultra-laser (blue) and magma (red).


Keys in game:

     - SPACE to fire a smart bomb, which destroys all enemies on screen.
       Becareful when using this as it's also your energy.
     - P to pause.
     - ESC to abort.
