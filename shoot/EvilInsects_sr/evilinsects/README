Recently  I  received  an  e-mail  from  The Amiga Community
Source  Project,  requesting me to upload the sources of the
software that I put on Aminet a long time ago.

Well,  here  they  are,  in the hope that they are useful to
someone.  Because I no longer actively develop for the Amiga
myself,  I  hereby declare this program, its sources and all
related  data files to be PUBLIC DOMAIN. In other words, you
can do anything you like with them.

Feel free to send me an e-mail if you have any questions.
