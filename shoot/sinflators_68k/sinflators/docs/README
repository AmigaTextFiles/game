INTRODUCTION:
	I wrote this game because I was really bored and needed
practice with ncurses. Basically, you see the aliens, you shoot the
aliens you win. Arrows for control and SPACE to fire. Remember
that the aliens shoot back at you!


COMPILING:
	It comes with a makefile, so just 'make' it, and then
'make install' it. If for some reason you don't have make or are
wierd and you want to compile it yourself from the command line
'gcc main.c -lncurses -o sinflator' and it will be compiled!


COPYING:
	Do whatever you want with the code as long as you
mention my name somewhere.


BUG REPORTS AND COMMENTS:
	If you find any bugs PLEASE email me at bobertlo@yahoo.com
also email me if you have any comments.
