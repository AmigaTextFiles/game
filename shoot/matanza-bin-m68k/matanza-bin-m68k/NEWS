Version 0.13:

- We now call fork() and other standard stuff to make the process a daemon.
  Other changes in this direction are required (specially for logging things).

- We now catch WSACONNRESET in Windows.  It was causing us to exit before
  ("matanza: send: Unknown error (code 10054)").

- Added motion blur for objects that move too fast (speed is relative to the
  viewer).

- Fixed crash when --ppc was 2.

- Made it possible for a player to see the world as other players see it.

- Added support for telnet's linemode kludge.  Should fix problems with CRT
  and probably other telnet clients.

- Made it possible to enable and disable verbose messages at runtime.  Added a
  lot of verbosity that will hopefully help us find problems at certain
  platforms faster.

- Now depending on whether MATANZA_VERBOSE, Matanza is compiled with all the
  verbose messages.  If it is not enabled, it is compiled without them, which
  shrinks the file size.

- Added a new image for a ship (shiptank.txt).

- It is now possible to compile Matanza without asserts: just don't define
  MATANZA_ASSERT at compile time.

- Made it possible to view the world as the other players.  The commands `['
  and `]' are used to change from the current player to the prev/next.

- Fixed bug with some images for the ships:  As they got rotated, some parts
  (corners) used to disappear.

17/Mar/2001 Version 0.12:

- CPU optimizations for drawing images to players when the game is paused.

- LibXML is no longer used.

- Expat is now bundled with Matanza.  It is now possible to load universes
  using it.

- Initial support for simple monsters.

- Significative memory optimizations.  Images (which acocunted for most of the
  memory used by Matanza) are now taking around 16% of what they used to.  For
  example, the images for the asteroids used to require 1001 kb and now take
  only 157.

- Fixed a few memory leaks.

- Fixed bug: The default maximing speed (arg_speed_max) was way too big.

- Added initial code for simple monsters.

- Fixed a bug with applying x/y scale rates to the direction of bullets.

- Changed the way zooming works.  Fixed a bug where the x/y scales would almost
  never match the x/y screen sizes, which caused problems that can be explained
  as having a square look like a rectangle.

- Fixed a bug (I didn't think it was a bug, but it was reported as such) that
  caused the ship to rotate too fast at the beginning.  Now it rotates slowly.
  Bug or not, this is an improvement.

- Started to implement MMP, to allow programs to control ships remotely.  It is
  still under development.

- Hopefully fixed a bug that caused the screen to become full of trash when a
  player lagged for a significative time.

- Lots of internal changes to make the implementation of MMP as efficient as
  possible, as well as to be able to support multiple universes in one instance
  of the server.

- It is now possible to modify the ship's image at runtime (without recompiling
  Matanza).  The `--ship-img' parameter allows you to specify the path to the
  image.  See the `ship.txt' file for more details.  This feature was suggested
  by Augusto Tamayo.

- By Popular Demand, port to Microsoft Windows is complete.  It should be
  considered beta.  Please report any bugs.

- Port to BeOS is complete.  It should be considered beta.  Please report any
  bugs.  Thanks to Andrés Felipe Arguello for his useful input and testing
  during the porting process.

- Fixed bug concerning the "Game Over" label when ppc is 2.

- Made it possible for players to zoom in and out as they wish. `-' and `=' are
  used.  When ppc is two, you can use `-', `=', `/' and `*'.

- Command `w' now reports the lives left for every player.

- When ppc is 2, the following commands are now supported: `z', `0', `p'.

- When playing in air mode, collisions of players with asteroids and players
  among themselves are ignored.

- Fixed assertion fails (6247).

15/Feb/2001 Version 0.11:

- Fixed bug: when players lose, they are no longer shown in other players'
  radars.

- Fixed a bug where sometimes the keyboard was set on limbo.

- Added primite support for worlds.  This depends on libxml.

- The fire effect was finally fixed.

- Support for JPEG image format was removed. "Perfection is reached, not when
  there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to
  take away." -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

- Support for PNG files was added. "Everything should be made as simple as
  possible, but not simpler."  -- Albert Einstein

- It is now possible to quit during the game hitting `q' (and `Q').

06/Jan/2001 Version 0.10:

- Now bullets do hit asteroids.  After some damage, they break into smaller
  asteroids.

- We now draw the direction to reach asteroids.

- It is now possible to control the ship using the arrow keys.

- When no players are playing (or connected), Matanza now automatically pauses
  the game so it won't waste CPU cycles.

- Now you can have two players per connection (parameter ppc).

- Header file <arpa/telnet.h> is no longer needed to compile Matanza.  This was
  reported as a bug by Andrés Felipe Arguello, who is porting to Beos.

- Fixed a bug that would make players seeing the fire effects (the stuff after
  the "Presents") see everything differently.

- Support for loading the background image from a JPEG file was added.

- Strong bandwidth optimizations made on the way output is sent to the players.

- More command line arguments were added.

27/Sep/2000 Version 0.9:

- Space mode (previously specified with `--space') is now the default.  Use
  option `--air'.

- Fixed assert (matanza.w:3501).

- Added command line arguments `--asteroids' (specifies how many asteriods we
  draw), `--invisibility' (the maximum time the players can be invisible),
  `--no-radar' (doesn't show the directions to reach other players) and
  `--limits' (give edges to the world, rather than making it ``round'') where
  added.

- When a player runs out of bullets of a given type, we let him now.

- Default values for the maximum speed and angular speed were increased.

- Improved the README.

18/Sep/2000 Version 0.8:

- Added more navigation modes, specified using parameters `--brake',
  `--ang-speed-max', `--speed-max', `--fly-back' and `--space'.  I was inspired
  by kasteroid.

- Small optimizations.

17/Sep/2000 Version 0.7:

- Fixed a few assertion fails.

- Added teams mode, specified with parameters `--team', `--no-share' and
  `--teams-safe'.

- Added command line argument `--password' to perform authentication.

- When the command line arguments are not sane, we now fix them rather than
  refuse to run.

- Added new type of missiles, shot with `n'.

- Improved widgets of the main menu.

- Maximum player's name increased to 8 characters.

- Added more names to the list of initial random names.

- Improved the messages sent to the players to remove redundancy.

- Added command line argument `--no-chat' to remove that functionality.

- Added parameter `--lives'.  Apparently this change in version 0.5 got lost.

15/Sep/2000 Version 0.6:

- Bug fixes.

12/Sep/2000 Version 0.5:

- Now every player gets a random name from a list.

- Now every player has many lives, specified with `--lifes'.

- Fix for a bug for terminals with white background.

- Fixes for assertion fails.

9/Sep/2000 Version 0.4:

- Fixed bugs that were causing crashes (ASSERTs failed).

- Added options --health, --mapsize-x and --mapsize-y.

8/Sep/2000 Version 0.3:

- Fixed bug with telnet clients that send \r\n (eg. Windows').

- Added command line option --bold (there are some bugs with this).

- Fixed bug with missiles.

- Now we do draw the missiles.

- Added command line options --imgheight and --imgwidth.  Useful to zoom
  in/out.

- Added command line argument --version.

- Fixed compilation problem on BSDs (about getopt).  Hopefully.

5/Sep/2000 Version 0.2:

- Made it possible to shot bullets backwards.

- Fixed bug about the counter of players.

- The line at the bottom of the screen is now used.
 
4/Sep/2000 Version 0.1:

- First distribution of Matanza.
