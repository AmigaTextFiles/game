Here are pending things and ideas and instructions on how to contribute:

- Add a flame to the ships, its intensity determined by their speed.

- Draw more ships.  Please open ship.txt and edit the ship on it.  Send me the
  results.

- Finish specifing and implementing MMP.

- Add colors.  This is not so easy, but must be done.

- Add a key to brake the ship as soon as possible.

- Make more simple, stupid alien ships.

- Make computer controled ships.  As smart as can be.

- Make an image for the mother ship of every team.  Someone do this and send
  me the result.  The mother ship should have wholes for ships to enter into
  her and come outside of her.  The goal of every team is destroying the other
  teams' mother ships.

- Get teams to work again.

- When a player gets hurt badly, make his ship suffer random problems: not
  being able to reach full speed, suddently turning to a given side, etc.

- When a player gets hurt badly, make parts of his ship (eg. wings) disappear.

- Make special flying pills; when the players hit them, they get bonuses (such
  as more bullets, health, speeds enhacements and invisibility).

- Let the players assemble their ships at the beginning.  They must be able to
  choose how many missiles, fuel, invisibility, radars, etc. they want.

- Add fuel.  Players will eventually run out of fuel.

- Add scores.

- Fix the widgets when you have ppc != 1.  Improve them.

- Add XML configuration for the keyboard.

- Improve support for worlds.

- Make it possible to specify the damage players get done when they crash
  against the different objects.  In the XML files.
