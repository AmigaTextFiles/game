Check & Money Order instructions:

Personal checks drawn outside the US cannot be accepted, this includes Canada.

The easiest method of payment for Canadian users seems to be Canadian Postal
money orders.  They are cheap and easily cashable.  I usually process
registrations as soon as they come in, rather than waiting for the check to
clear, as I know they are accepted.

Also, don't waste your money on overnight express/fedex/etc, it really doesn't
get the key file to you much quicker, and you spend MUCH more on it.  Just a
suggestion.

Note to XenoRPG owners.  Due to the fact that I did not keep record of XenoRPG
registrations, I must ask that you send me your keyfile for verification.

*NOTE* I process registrations once a week, more if I'm able.  Please allow
at least 2-3 weeks before you come screaming that I took your money.  You will
get your license, I promise.
