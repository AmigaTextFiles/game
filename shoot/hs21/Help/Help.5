With the exception of an Alchemist, all classes have the ability to cast magic,
whether it be spells, scrolls, or the use of wands.  Spells are only taught to
certain magic-user classes, where as scrolls and wands are sold to the others.
Once a spell is learned, it may never be forgotten and is a permanent aid to
its user as long as he has enough spell power to cast it.  Scrolls may be read
to cast its spell as long as the user has enough spell power, but there is the
added chance that the scroll will burn and no longer be in the possession of
the user.  Wands, which are extremely expensive to purchase, may only be used
once, though the user can always purchase or find another.  The different types
of magic that may be used are as follows:

-=> Charisma, Intellect, Strength, Agility <=-
These magic spells temporarily increase your character's abilities, up to the
maximum of 100.  Each time one of these spells are successfully attempted, that
ability will increase from 1 through 10.

-=> Shield, Hone <=-
These spells increase the effectiveness of your armor or weapon.  Do not try to
augment your armor or weapon class to more than twice its value!  The result
could lead you to an unwanted visit to the Armoury or Weapon Shoppe.

-=> Teleport <=-
This spell allows you to teleport yourself in the dungeon, just as if you had
entered a magical teleport chamber.  It can also work on defense.  Should you
or an opponent be in a near-death situation, the spell may be attempted to flee
the situation.

-=> Heal, Blast <=-
These spells can help restore (heal) your hit points or damage (blast) your
opponent's hit points during battle.  You achieve greater results as your
character grows in experience.

-=> Resurrect <=-
This spell will prompt you to bring any dead player back to Alive! status,
making him available for another kill.  All players are resurrected at midnight
of each day.  Whenever a player logs in, their status is automatically set to
Alive! status.

-=> Cure <=-
This spell will restore all of your hit points.  This is an extremely powerful
spell to use during battle, because it can essentially double your hit points.
There is a small probablility that an opponent may use this spell on himself
during battle.

-=> Disintegrate <=-
This is the ultimate spell to use to defeat an opponent.  Once it is cast, your
opponent is completely atomized and you win the battle.  Be aware that anyone
with this capability might use it against you in battle.

-=> Confusion <=-
This spell is used to distract your opponent during a battle.  The opponent
will have tend to miss more during attack and his spell casting will fail more
often.

-=> Transmute <=-
This spell will permanently transmute your opponent's weapon into something
less damaging.  Some monsters may cast this spell, too.

-=> Mayhem <=-
This spell will prompt you to ruin some user, effectively stealing all of that
user's gold and downgrading his weapon, armor, real estate, security, and naval
warship.  This may only be used on users higher or up to thirty levels below
you.  The depleted user may be alerted that you had done the dirty deed.

-=> Morph <=-
This spell can only be cast during battle; it will randomly change your
opponent's character class -- permanently.  The morph in some instances may
actually make the opponent stronger -- or destroy him utterly.  A very rare
and dangerous spell.
