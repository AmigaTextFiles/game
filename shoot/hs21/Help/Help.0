Here are a few hints worth noting:

* At any prompt asking for a username or usernumber, you can type a ? to obtain
  a user listing by level.

* Jousting is important, especially in the beginning to gain gold.

* Whenever a prompt asks for an amount of gold, it usually has a [MAX=$$] after
  it.  You can type MAX instead of entering the whole amount.  If you are in
  default money format (platinum, gold, silver, copper), you can type a
  specific amount followed by the metal's letter, i.e., 500c is equal to 500
  copper pieces.  50000c is equivalent to 5s or 5 silver pieces.  1.5p is the
  only way to exchange the cash amount 1p,5000g; unless you make one exchange
  of 1p and then another for 5000g.

* Killing a 'blessed' user gives you bonus points on your abilities a small
  percentage on your weapon on armor.  Losing to a user while blessed gives
  him your blessedness.  Losing to an arena monster while blessed will give the
  blessedness to a random user.

* Losing to a 'cursed' user takes points away from your abilities along with a
  small percentage on your weapon on armor.  Only by defeating another user can
  you pass on the curse.

* Descend levels in the dungeon as quickly as you can to gain more experience,
  if you have the hit points.  Trapdoors can help, but they can also damage
  your weapon and armor.

* Owning a naval warship can earn you big money, especially fishing and hunting
  sea monsters.

* Defeating a user with a higher experience level than yourself will reduce his
  Experience Points awarded the next time he is defeated.  For example, a level
  7 Fighter defeats a level 9 Thief.  The Fighter receives level 9 Experience
  Points.  The next day, that player will show up as a level 9 (7) Thief.
  The next player that defeats him will only be awarded level 7 Experience
  Points.  The level 9 Thief can only restore his true level at his next logon.
