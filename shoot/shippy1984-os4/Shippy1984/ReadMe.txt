 MUSEUM OF RARE GAMES 
   Shippy 1984 is quite a fun game. It is a retro arcade shooter which somewhat 
   resembles Space Invaders. Unlike its appearance it is a modern game, it is 
   supposed to look like the games from the old days. Although there isn't that 
   much to do other than shooting space bugs, or whatever those things are, it's 
   still a game with a good feeling and a good soundtrack. The difficulty level 
   is quite high, it starts ridiculously easy but a few levels later it's nearly 
   impossible to finish a level.

   I would recommend this game if you want to experience the retro feeling on a 
   modern computer.

 GAME HIPPO 

  Having grown up in the 80s, I was reared on games like Galaxian. There has 
  always been something special to me about the classic arcade shooter, so much 
  so that I will make any excuse necessary to pop a quarter into any old 80s 
  space shooters I find, be they in some stinky gas station, the lounge in some 
  airport, or wherever.
  When I first fired up Shippy 1984 and was immediately greeted by the old 
  "Winners don't use drugs" screen that used to grace almost every arcade game, 
  I knew I was in for something special. When I saw the title screen and heard 
  the classically cheesy digitized voice pronounce the name of the game, I felt 
  like I was supposed to look for a coin slot.
  Even without the coin slot, Shippy 1984 is one of the best retro-shooters I've 
  ever played. Everything looks, sounds, and feels like it came straight out of 
  the games of my youth. The classic arcade font is here, the pre-game enemy 
  display is here, the high-score name entry music that is just little bit too 
  happy sounding is here too.
  Like the games of old, Shippy 1984 is based in simplicity. The objective is 
  simple: Control the Happy Fez and destroy the minions of the Angry Fez. There 
  are three types of enemies, two different weapon power ups, time bonuses, 
  accuracy bonuses, and bonus lives.
  I really can't say much more about this game, because there isn't much to it. 
  However, Shippy 1984 succeeds incredibly in everything it's trying to be. If 
  you like classic arcade shooters, this one's a keeper. If you're too young to 
  appreciate this sort of game, you probably won't like it. Don't expect anything 
  groundbreaking, but do expect to have some action packed fun.
  The game is also available for Mac OS X and Linux.
