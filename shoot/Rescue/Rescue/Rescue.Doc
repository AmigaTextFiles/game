You  are  allowed to copy "Space-Rescue" for private purposes, upload it to

Public-Domain  libraries  or  other Program libraries (except for Networks)

"Space-Rescue"   by   other   means  than  by  selling  Public-Domain-Disks
containing  the  game, or to give it along with any comercial products like
computer-maganzines  etc.,  you  need my written permission too.  (Normally
there's  no  problem  involved  in getting this permission - just send me a
Fido-Netmail  and  I'll  send  you  a fax).  I just want to get an overview
about who earns more money with this game than me :-)

In any case you are allowed to copy "Space-Rescue" only when copying this
file also.


Notes on compatibility:
-----------------------
"Space-Rescue"  automatically notices if started on an NTSC- or PAL-System.
On  PAL-Systems  it uses the full screen.  On NTSC it switches to overscan.
Nevertheless, the sound is playing slightly faster on NTSC-Machines.  Users
with  just 512 KByte of ram will have to disconnect all external drives and
start  "Space-Rescue"  out  of  the  CLI.  When you have got more memory of
course,   you   can  start  "Space-Rescue"  directly  from  the  workbench.
"Space-Rescue"  should  run on Systems with Turboboards, memory expansions,
Kickstart 2.0 etc.  (Sorry I could not test it on an A3000).

Warning!!! Space-Rescue totally turns of Multitasking.  Please wait for all
----------- other disk-activities to stop before starting the game.
After being started, Space-Rescue can by stopped at any time by pressing
the left Mousebutton.

Space-Rescue is distributed without any warranty.

Instructions 
============
Space-Rescue  is  some kind of answer to Anders Bjerins 'Mini-Blast'.  Your
task  is  to  maneuver  an  helicopter throughout a cave without getting to
touch anything.  Several obstacles make it difficult to get through all the
caves.  Some of them can be shot using your build in weapon, others can't.

Further  you  will have to watch your fuel.  Your Helicopter has an limited
amount of fuel (unleaded of course :-) which can be refilled at the marked,
white places.

In higher levels, there can be several ways to go.  Watch out which way you
choose,  for  there  are some ways, you can only complete, whe you refilled
your   fuel  at  the  right  time  (not  too  late,  and  not  too  early).
Nevertheless  you  can  normally  get  more  points  when  flying  the more
dangerous ways.

During  the  title-picture  ist  displayed,  you  can  choose  the level of
difficulty  by  pressing [F1] to [F3], which will determine the helicopters
size.   You  can  pause  the  game  by  pressing  [P].   Pressing  the left
mouse-button  during  the title sequence or in the game will get you out of
'Space-Rescue'.

In order to let you get an better overview about the cave and all what's in
it,  your  helicopter  features an short-range scanner (placed in the upper
right half of the screen).

When a level is done, a notice will be displayed at the same location.  You
now  have to land at the nearest refuelling-point and press the fire-button
to proceed to the next cave.  If you think the game is to hard, try finding
the  cheat-mode :-).  In general:  If it moves shoot it, if it doesn't move
blast it.

Thanks to Stephan Polster for testing the NTSC-mode and Andreas Dubhorn for
drawing the helicopter

   and to all those who send the Shareware-fee !!!
