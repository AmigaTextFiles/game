@NODE intro "Introducing DropZone"
"MISSION BRIEFING
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It  is  the year  2085, and  only  a  handful  of  people  have survived the
devastating robot wars. In a final bid for human survival the peoples of the
earth unite to develop the ultimate transportation; a Tacheon propelled star
cruiser, capable  of  overcoming relativistic limitations to  fresh new star
systems.

The  Tacheon  drive  relies on bombarding very  rare  Ionian  crystals  with
quarks.  But all the earth's resources were used up  developing a  prototype
and so a consignment of men is despatched to the hostile young planet of IO,
Jupiter's 2nd inner most moon.  It  is  here  that the crystals are found in
abundance  scattered  all  over the surface.  They are continually thrown up
from the depths of the planet by the elemental forces  of  the  three active
volcanoes, first discovered way back in the 1980's.

Not long after building a moonbase in the flat  bed  of  a  large crater the
first  wave  of  aliens arrive from Jupiter to rid their moon  of  the human
invaders.

It is your mission to protect the  men and their crystals from the marauding
aliens. You have  been equipped with the latest pulse laser back pack system
capable of carrying an extra  man  and becoming invisible and indestructible
for short periods of time. You must safely escort each surviving man and his
crystals  back  to  the Dropzone where the landing pad  of  the  moonbase is
located. You must succeed, the future of mankind depends on you alone."

So the original C64 instructions for Dropzone prepared me for the years of
struggle. And, as distant summers fled across the peaceful earth, after many
losses on both sides, it began to look as though mankind would be saved.
Just one final push with the best pilots, the survivors, the veterans, the
cream of experience, curdled under a harsh Jovian light. To sweep the moon
clean of the enemy scum with the purest, blindest of hate, nurtured through
so many orbits. They were weakened, and this time they would die. They would
all die.

But then, suddenly, my trusty C64 was sabotaged by the alien hordes. What
could be done? Men were dying out there!

I sat down in front of my A1200 with a copy of Blitz Basic 2 with only one
goal in mind; to create an interface between my computer and the moonbase on
IO, to get back out there before it was too late, mankind must survive!
Shortly after seeing the first flickering transmissions, planters swirling
through the stormy atmosphere, my A1200 was broken too... Again I suspected
THEM. But I could do nothing. I never knew the fate of our final mission.

And so I did other things. Time passed. I became content, resigned and idle.

And then one day I heard a sound. A sound that bubbled out of turbulent
memories and brought me back to life: a faint whistle; a cry for help. So
once again I started to build and mold. The result was DropZone.

Back in the fray, and I soon knew the scores had been evened; they had
rebuilt their strength, and we were still hanging on. Strapping on my
spacesuit, I felt like I was home. A hasty briefing warned me of new alien
developments: they were now trying to terraform IO, changing the atmosphere
to suit their foul needs and make it more hostile for us.

A call to arms! To defeat the alien menace and restore mankind to peace and
glory. New pilots will be needed. And old stalwarts too, called out of
retirement for the greatest battle yet. Humanity needs YOU!

			@{"'Alrighty! How do I play?'" link how}
@ENDNODE

@NODE sysreq "DropZone System Requirments"
To play DropZone you will need:

	An Amiga with at least OS 2+
	The AGA chipset (not strictly necessary but will be used if present)
	For best speed a reasonably fast Amiga (ie. A1200+fastram or better)

	To make the most of the game's output, you should plug it into your
	hifi; the game uses directional stereo sound effects, for example, to
	help you find the men in distress, and to show where the next nmeye's
	coming from. For the most resplendant and immersive visuals, play in
	the dark and let the explosions light up the back of your skull...

	Only the DEMO version may be freely distributed; the complete
	registered version is copyright and illegal to distribute.
	If you give anyone a copy of the complete version then there will
	be no future development of the software.

	The following DropZone files are required for the demo:

If any of the above files are missing from your copy then please @{"register" link register}
for a complete version (register anyway!).

Note:	The files ending with ".info" are optional but should be present
	whenever DropZone is distributed.

The software looks for it's data files from a volume called DROPZONE:
If you're working from floppy disk then simply name the disk DROPZONE
Ideally you'll be using a hard disk (the game doesn't need any disk access
once it's loaded, but it will load much faster than from floppy) and you
should place the whole archive in a directory called DROPZONE and add

	ASSIGN DROPZONE: [path]

where [path] is the full path of the DROPZONE directory, to the file

	s:startup-sequence

or

	s:user-startup

or simply type it into a CLI or SHELL window before you run the game.

@NODE ctrl "DropZone Controls Overview"
Starting a new game, Exiting DropZone
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Simply press fire from any of the title screens to begin a new game. If you
press 'ESC' on one of the title screens then the Hall-Of-Fame will be saved
to disk (for next time) and the game will exit to DOS (Workbench or CLI, or
wherever you came from).
'SPACE' moves between the various title screens.
If 'ESC' is pressed during the game that game will exit immediately to the
title screens, if you achieved a highscore it -will not- be entered into the
Hall-Of-Fame...


Controls
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
DropZone can be played with either a joystick (in port 1) or keyboard
controls, selected by pressing the fire-button of your choice on the title
screen.

Pressing 'j' toggles between joystick and keyboard control whilst paused.

The keyboard controls are:

	cursor keys - left, right, up and down thrusts
	right ALT - fire pulse weapon

Some special control keys can be used in both joystick and keyboard modes.

Special keys:

	SPACE bar - release strata bomb.
	right AMIGA - toggle cloak.
	ESCAPE - quit current game, and return to title screens.
	ESCAPE (from title screens) - quit to DOS and save Hall-Of-Fame.
	'p' - pause.
	'q' (while paused) - self destruct (all lives are lost).
	'j' (while paused) - toggle joystick and keyboard modes.


Environment
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
DropZone is played out over the surface of IO. To master the game you must
learn the feel of your back pack because you will have both INERTIA and
GRAVITY affecting your movement just as in everyday life on earth.


Firing
¯¯¯¯¯¯
Pressing your chosen fire button will release a pulse of deadly plasma (mind
the men on the surface!) to destroy an alien. Try it and see. (a valuable
addition to your modern lifestyle, I think you'll agree)

Horizontal Thrust
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯
Your strongest thrust from your jetpack will accelerate you across the
moon's surface. At full speed you will be faster than most of the opposition
but don't try to outrun a Nmeye!

Vertical Thrust
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯
Your secondary thrust is used to adjust your position above the surface.
Remember that the moon's gravity is constantly acting on you, so to hold a
steady position your must keep firing bursts of your vertical thrust.

Strata Bomb Release
¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Pressing the space bar to release a strata bomb (if you have any left) will
destroy any aliens (except men and androids) currently in view on the main
display.

Cloak Activation
¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Activating the cloak will render you invunerable for a short period, switch
it off again when you're through the danger to save the precious power
supply. You will have a chance to recharge after each attack wave.
@ENDNODE

@NODE rules "DropZone Objective and Game Structure"
Objective
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Your mission is to protect the men on planet IO's surface from being
destroyed by the invading aliens and return them one by one to the Dropzone
in which the moonbase landing pad is located.


Game Structure
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You start with a consignment of eight men, 15 seconds of cloaking power, 3
lives and three Strata Bombs. You get 1 bonus life and Strata Bomb for every
10,000 point mark that you reach, and 7 seconds of cloak power for each
wave.

After one million points has been achieved no more bonus lives or Strata
Bombs will be awarded. (But if you are that good you shouldn't need them!).

A wave is finished by destroying all planters, spores, trailers, blunder
storms and landing all the men back at the moonbase. You receive a points
bonus at the end of every attack wave for the number of rescued men.
You also get this for landing each man during the wave.

About every 5th wave a fresh consignment of men arrives. Prior to this round
you will have to battle through a special wave such as a TRAILER INVASION.
As you progress through the waves, the planters will adapt to your success,
becoming even more frenzied in their attacks on the men. Occasionally there
will be special level created by the game. These levels are always different
and unpredicatable.

If you lose a life while carrying a man he will be repleaced on the surface.
If you save and land all eight men then no more Android attacks will occur
for the rest of that wave. BUT if you have saved less than eight men then
every now and then one Android will actually invade the moonbase by
descending onto the landing pad and running into the moonbase.
@ENDNODE

@NODE cast "DropZone Characters"
Men
¯¯¯
At the start of each attack wave the 'Men Out' count will show how many men
are on the surface. They slowly move towards the moonbase in the Dropzone,
each carrying Ionian crystals. Whenever the alien Planters lower an Android
to destroy a man, he lets out a whistle for help that echoes around the
atmosphere. You can rescue men by picking them up one at a time and dropping
them off on to the elevated landing pad at the moonbase for bonus points.


Planters and Androids
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Planters are the most common alien. They are machines piloted by Androids
that drift across the surface rising up over volcanoes and the moonbase.
They are always on the look out for the men. When you attack, the Android
lowers itself to the surface to chase the man, leaving the Planter machine
to become a Nemesite


Nemesite
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Once an Android has landed, the Planter machine becomes a Nemesite, a deadly
homing missile set to crash into you at all costs. They evade your pulse
laser fire until they are close enough for collision.


Anti-Matter
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯
If all the Men on IO are destroyed, the Planters and Androids fuse into
gyrating Anti-Matter nodules which bounce towards you.


Spore
¯¯¯¯¯
Spores are fairly harmless until triggered off. When this occurs they
release up to four individual Trailers.


Trailers
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Trailers are released from Spores and need a direct hit on the heads of
their bodies to destroy them.


Nmeyes
¯¯¯¯¯¯
If you have survived an attack wave for too long the aliens send in a Nmeye
as their ultimate weapon. Nmeyes watch your every move and occasionally
blink. Their motion is erratic and they can move faster than you at full
speed. After 100 levels, two nmeyes can be sent at once, and later even
more...


Blunder Storms
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯
These storms are a silent but deadly environmental hazard of IO. They slowly
float in the upper atmosphere over the planet's surface sometimes retaining
molecular acid, or they will occasionally rumble and release an intense bolt
of proton lightning. If lightning strikes a man, he will be catapulted into
the Ionian atmosphere but he is well protected by his blue survival suit and
should still survive. Should an android be struck, its brain circuits will be
instantly fried and it will be destroyed as it crashes back to the surface.
If a nmeye is chasing you, it is occasionally possible to lead it under a
storm where, if stuck by lightning, it can be disabled for ten valuable
seconds before it burns out and the aliens send out another to hunt you down.



@ENDNODE

@NODE score "DropZone Score System"

Men		100-500	for rescuing during wave

Men		100-500	for each man surviving the wave

Men		0	if destroyed

Men		500	bonus if snatched in mid-air!

Android		50	if shot while descending with planter

Android		50	if shot whilst chasing a man

Android		500	if shot while falling from a destroyed planter

Planters	250		Spores		750

Nemesites	150		Trailers	250

Anti-Matter	150		Nmeyes		100

Blunder Storms	250		Loss of Life	10

By reaching certain scores, @{"bonus" link rules} lives or strata bombs can be gained.
Your score contributes to a mission rating; the best reach the @{"Hall of Fame" link fame}


@ENDNODE

@NODE fame "DropZone Hall of Fame"
Hall of Fame
¯¯¯¯ ¯¯ ¯¯¯¯
If at the end of the mission you have gained a sufficiently high score you
will be asked to enter your initials into the DropZone Hall of Fame,
signifying that you are one of the top ten heroes to attempt a DropZone
mission.
The Hall of Fame will only be saved to disk when you exit the game by
pressing 'ESC' from one of the title screens.
If you wish to clear the Hall of Fame, delete the following file:

	DropZone:Dropdata/fame.bin

A new version reset to the defaults will be created when you next play.


Mission Rating
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯
Depending on your performance you will be awarded one of 10 ranks. A
beginner might not achieve the 10,000 mark and will not recieve a rank. An
average score might get you Moon Cadet status. But for the mission to be
considered a total success you must achieve the rank of MEGASTAR. This is
universally regarded as the ultimate galactic distinction possible and will
be awarded to supreme warriors who fight off the aliens to score 1,000,000
points or more.


@ENDNODE

@NODE screen "DropZone Screen Display"
The Screen
¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯
The main (top) part of the screen shows the exact realtime side view of the
zone over which you are cruising.

The secondary (lower) part of the screen shows your instrumentation and
status displays.


Instruments
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Man Counts - These show how many men are currently on the planet's surface
and how many have actually been safely returned to the moonbase.

Attack Indicator - This is an arrow that is displayed the instant an Android
attack begins on one of the men still on the surface or the moonbase itself.
It shows the direction and shortest route to the last attack detected.

Cloak Status - This shows the amount of time left before the cloak generator
runs out of power. A warning signal is sounded about three seconds
beforehand.

Spare Lives - This shows up to three of the remaining lives

Strata Bombs - This shows up to three of the remaining Strata Bombs.

Score - Your accumulated points score, calculated according to the
@{"scoring system" link score}. With a high enough score you might achieve a rank or
enter the DropZone @{"Hall of Fame" link fame}.

SCANNER - This is the most important information area. It shows what is
happening elsewhere on the entire planet's surface and covers six times the
area shown on the main screen. Each member of the DropZone cast has a
distinct colour. The landing pad is detected as a series of bright white
dots at surface level.
@ENDNODE

@NODE hints "Veteran's Advice..."
Hints From The Old Warhorse's Mouth
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
(some apply only to the @{"full version" link register})


Learn to use the scanner! (without losing sight of your main display)

Be careful about shooting at ground level if there are men around. If all the
men die then the Planters and Androids will fuse into deadly Antimatter.

If a planter is releasing it's android to attack a man, it's your job to
rush to the rescue. If all the men are lost then things get very hectic and
you'll have to sit tight and wait for the next consignment of men (every few
attack waves). One method is to save the men first, then try to clear the
rest of the attack wave.

Spores are MOSTLY HARMLESS until you shoot them so leave them till last, or
try to get them all together with Strata Bombs which will help to clean
up the trailers too.

It is useful to save up Strata Bombs for the more difficult waves where
small groups of planters repeatedly teleport into the zone.

If a Nmeye is dispatched to destroy you (you should have finished the wave
sooner) then be prepared for a jousting duel. Find space away from planters
and other aliens and make full use of your scanner to monitor the Nmeye's
approach. Remember; you can't outrun a Nmeye at full speed, but you are more
manouvreable, so if it's hot on your tail (and you can't shake it!) fly in
circles, shooting as it spins past.

Try making a dummy move upwards as you flee from a close Nmeye, then make
use of the gravity by thrusting down towards the surface and doubling back
behind the Nmeye. This will give you some space as it overshoots.

A cool trick to try when chased by a nmeye is to lure it under a blunder
storm where, if struck by a blast of proton lightning, its brain circuits
can be fried and it will crash to the surface, disabled, buying you some
valuable time to complete the attack wave.

Another nice trick is to wait until the men are catapulted into the air by a
blunder storm, and try to catch them as they fall.

There is a special editor screen hidden in the game which gives you control
over some of the global parameters such as gravity/thrust strengh and
elasticity. There is also a secret cheat mode with many options for
experimentation. If the cheat mode has been activated, no hiscore will be
recorded, so that the Hall-O-Fame remains genuine.

Press 'r' when the cheat mode is active to make the level generator more
excitable. '[' quickly moves to the next level.

Try holding down SPACE before the first loading screen is displayed to switch
on the SCARECROW MODE. Or 'o' for ORIGINAL DROPZONE MODE.

@ENDNODE

@NODE designer "Designing your own backgrounds"

Using the CDesign editor, supplied with the complete @{"registered" link register} version,
you can design your own background graphics or edit the 70 or so supplied
backgrounds.

Background filenames should have the format:

	DROPBACKGn.COP

where 'n' is any number apart from 0, and should be located in the directory:

	DROPZONE:DROPDATA/BACK/

The number of backgrounds may be changed, but make sure that there are no
gaps in the file numbering. Number 0 is used when Antimatter occurs.

Also in this directory, you will find a dictionary file:

	NAMES.ASC

This is a standard ASCII file and may be edited in any text editor. It is
used to generate the names of random levels.

In the directory

	DROPZONE:DROPDATA/SOUND/

you may place any sound module in MED format to be played (probably in slow
motion... ho hum) while loading and throughout the titles.

@NODE history "DropZone History (abridged)"
Origins
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
DropZone is obviously based on the old Defender arcade games, with one or
two twists, tweeks and, in my view, improvements.

This version is specifically inspired by my memories of Archer Maclean's
masterpiece for the C64. I'm assuming it's a fairly faithful representation
(although I can't check; my C64 was buried years ago), I wrote it because I
wanted to play DropZone on my Amiga. And here it is, as large as life, and
twice as big.

My version was written with the help of Blitz Basic 2, a beautiful language
from Acid Software (despite its bugs, despite the fact that I can't get the
debugger to function properly, despite the clumsy, error-prone editor, and
despite the mess and inconsistency of the manuals/docs it is a stunningly
worthy package). Buy it. Use it.


Thanks must go to:

@NODE register "DropZone Registration"

Once upon a time I was going to distribute a demo version of DropZone, and make the
full version shareware for a paltry (or poultry?) fee. Now i can't be bothered, so you
should find this is the full version 1.0 of the game. Hope you find some enjoyment in
it...

On the offchance that you're so overwhelmed with gratitude, I'd welcome any small change,
gifts or whatever you feel like sending me. Whatever, let me know your thoughts on the
game if you can find my email address...

Note that I'm writing this in 1999, everything else (including the rest of this guide)
was done back in the day, years ago. In the interval I've added to the dictionary file
(about twice) and allowed friends to throw in a few words too...

Cheerio,
