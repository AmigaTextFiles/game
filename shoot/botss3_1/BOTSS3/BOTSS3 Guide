@{b}The Story so far...@{ub}

  Zackaria, Leader of a race of aliens attacked Earth believing that
he could win glory for his own kind and enslave all of humanity. This was
not the case however, and with superior forces and weaponary, Earth won the
battle and saved the Solar System from the alien invasion. Zackaria was
defeated but not killed and less than two months later he returned to fight
Earth once again, this time with allies from the prison planet Titan.

  Earth had at it's disposal five of the Solar System's most powerful one
man fighters - The Advanced Tactical Assault Fighter (ATAF). With these
fighters the Earth forces were almost victorious in there war. Towards the
end of the second battle, Zackaria gained the upperhand and killed the
President of Earth. The five pilots that had fought so long and hard to
defend the planet from Zackaria swore to protect it for as long as they lived.

  Now 2 years later they will have that task for one last time...

@node CONTROL "BASIC CONTROL"

@{b}Basic Gameplay@{ub}

    BOTSS 3 is a game for One or Two Players. It is actually a much
  easy, and all together more fun game when played with two players.
  Players can control the ATAFs with either the Mouse and or Joystick.

    Using the Mouse to Play the Game.

  The mouse makes the game very easy to play. Moved the mouse like
  you would do a pointer on the screen to control the ship. The Left
  mouse button fires your current weapon. The Right Mouse button fires
  your special weapon.

    Using the Joystick to Play the Game.

  A Joystick plugged into Port 2 (ie - not the mouse one), allows you
  to control either ATAF or both. Control is fairly basic.

  UP - Move Up   DOWN - Move Down   LEFT - Move Left  RIGHT - Move Right
                 FIRE - Fire        SPACE - Use Special

    The Game Screen also contains information about your ship's shield
   energy and your remaining special weapons. Player One's information
   is displayed at the top of the screen and Player Two's information
   at the bottom.

    Your ATAF's shield begin recharging as soon as it is hit and whenever
   its energy levels are below 100%. However, should they fall below
   25% then they will not recharge. You will be informed of this fact
   be a danger icon which will appear next to your shield value.
   A health token will be required to gain back this lost shield energy.
   Specials do not recharge and can only be gain with "S" tokens.

   You start the game either by pressing the FIRE button of a joystick
in port 2 or by pressing the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON on the title screen.

@node WEAPONS "WEAPONS"

@{b}Weapons@{ub}

 There are 3 different weapons in the game and a pair of Sidearms to be
attained. The Weapons avalible are PLASMA, LASERS and ROCKETS. Each weapon
have an advantage over the others and a disadvantage.

  PLASMA  - This is the weapon that you start off with. It powers up slowly
            but has the highest power up range. The Plasma weapon is powered
            up using the Green Tokens. Its recharge rate (speed of firing)
            can be powered up with the Blue Tokens.

  LASERS  - Lasers are a good secondary weapon since they power up twice as
            fast as the Plasma and can be also affected by the Blue Tokens.
            Lasers are built up with the Red Tokens.

  ROCKETS - Rockets power up the fastest and are quite powerful even in
            their lowest stage. As a result, Rockets cannot be powered up
            very far and are completely uneffected by the Blue Tokens.
            Rockets are powered up with the White Tokens.

  SPECIAL - This devestating weapon is standard on your craft. When used it
            will a huge beam of plasma out in front of the craft causing
            masses of damage to any enemy which are in its path. In addition
            it can be moved around the screen. It stays active for only a
            few seconds. The advantages of the SPECIAL is that, unlike the
            other weapons, its power outtage can not be reduced or damaged
            (other weapons can be drained). The other advantage of this
            weapon is that whilst active, you are invulnerable and NOTHING,
            but NOTHING, can kill you.

  SIDEARMS - These are released by certain enemies and attach themselves to
             the sides of your ship. They fire the weapon that you have
             currently active. This increases the firepower that you have on
             your craft.

  TOKENS

    BLUE  - As already described, these tokens allow the Plasma and Laser
            weapon speeds to be powered up. Standard firing rate is 4.
            Plasma can be powered up to 8 and Laser to 6. Rockets are
            unaffected.

    HEART - This token restores 25 shield points, vital if your shield has
            dropped below 25 as it will not recharge!!

    "S"   - This token adds one extra Special to your armament. However it
            is not a very frequent item and should be collected as soon
            as it is seen!
@endnode

@node ENEMIES
@{b}Enemies@{ub}

 During the Game you will come across a variety of enemies. Some will home
in on your ship and fire at you. Others will Avoid direct path confrontation
and simply aim at you. Some will chase you around the screen and not give up
until either you or themselves have been destroyed. Most enemies travel from
right to left of the screen.

 Every enemy within the game may release a token for you to collect a power
up your ship, but some enemies will release 3 tokens are once. Even though
you should be taking care to avoid enemy fire (remember one hit does not
kill you) some shots don't just cause damage, but they actually drain the
power of your current weapon. An explosion on your ship will indicate this
happening. Rockets always drain and cause a lot of damage at the same time.

 To finish a level, you must defeat the level guardian. The arrivial of this
enemy will be indicated by a multicoloured energy bar at the bottom of the
screen and a change in game music. Some guardians will stop and talk to you
before attacking, such as Kabal, Zackaria and Shan Lou. During this
sequence you cannot harm enemy but they will not fire at you either. Note
that any shots fired before this time can still hit and damage you.

@endnode

@node CUTSCENES
@{b}Cutscenes@{ub}

 These are short sequences that appear occasionally throughout the game. As
you progress further into it, they expand the story line and explain what
the next mission will be about and what (if any) special things will have to
be done during it.

  You can switch them on or off in the options screen, but be warned that it
is sometimes best to watch them as you may find yourself starting a level
you are completely unprepared for.

Hints and Tips
--------------

* Get a friend to play with you. (ooooh! Suits You, Sir!)
  It's more fun and easier than doing it yourself. (fnarr-fnarr)

* Play as a team.

* Some bosses need to have weak points destroyed first.

* Collect ALL the weapon power ups. If you get drained on one weapon then
  you can switch to one which hasn't been affected.

* Watch the cut scenes.

* Use the fire button to destroy the enemies and thus allow yourself to
  progress further in the game.

Background to the Game
----------------------

Why am I in my own game? It's not because I've got a huge ego, but because
all of characters in it are people I know (save for the aliens). BOTSS
was initially done as a bit of fun whilst at school, and lots of people
wanted to be in it.

Summer 1994 - Started writing BOTSS 3 in AMOS
Winter 1994 - Gave up. AMOS Couldn't handle it.

Summer 1995 - Started coding in BLITZ 2
              Game was 1 Player only with 2 Levels.
              Too many bugs, crashed all the time.
Winter 1995 - Gave up.

Spring 1996 - Started... AGAIN.
              Implimented Two Player mode, Multiple Power Ups. Sidearms, Etc

Winter 1997 - Finished.
              Yes, it took that bloody long...

(However the "2 Years Later" is a story reference, not a coding one.)

Phrases Most Used in Coding
---------------------------

"Stop nicking all the ****ing tokens!!"
"Why?"
"I'm trying to test the game, stupid!"

"(sigh)... it's crashed again."

"How the hell did that happen???"

"Stupid ****ing thing." (Many times)

"It's too hard!"

"There is a line between easy and hard and you just leapt right over it"

"What did you do to the clock? It says 12:03am 5th September..... 2017!"

"Anyone wanna play Worms?"

"I'm going to die... and I'm dead."
