Map Info version 1.0.0 (2010/02/23)

This command line utility will parse a Quake 2 map file to report
how many entities and textures are being used.  Useful for
spotting extra items to improve gameplay balance and/or reducing
extra textures to increase map speed.  Most map editors do not
provide a detailed breakdown of what is inside a map.

Map Info should be compatible with any Quake 2 (ID Tech 2) game
engine if the map file format has not be altered.

If a game has a different map format, you can modify the source
code to reflect the new format.  If you make such a modification,
please email me the modification and a map file to test against.

If you want me to make the modification, please email the name of
the game and a map file to test against.  An ideal map file would
be the example map provided by the game (e.g., base1.map for
Quake 2).  I will implement an option switch for that map format
and release a new version of Map Info.
