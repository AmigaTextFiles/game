The source code was written in ANSI C and should compile without
modification by any C99-standards compliant compiler.

The GNU Linux/Mac version was compiled on a MacBook with Mac OS X
Snow Leopard using GCC 4.2.1 (i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1) and
tested against Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop.

The Windows version was compiled with CodeBlocks on Windows XP
(32-bit) and tested against Windows Vista (64-bit).

If compiling from the command line on GNU Linux or Mac, use this
command: 

	make all

If compiling from the command line under Cygwin on Windows, use
this command:

	make windows
	
NOTE: You will need to have the cygwin1.dll in your path if you
move or execute mapinfo.exe outside of Cygwin or the programw will
not work.

The source code will compile on Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and
later versions.  CodeBlocks is highly recommended.
