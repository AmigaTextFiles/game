 /68882)

 You will need at least 1 Megabyte of Memory to run Thesius XII..

                           * 470k Other (Fast/Chip) 


 Any machine with enought extra free CHIP RAM will have access to speech

               ---        Makes NO effort to use any of the AGA chipset
                          features...(Sorry)



 Software Requirements:
 ======================

 Thesius XII should run upon any system with Wb1.x or higher installed
 and Does NOT Require any external libraries to run...

  

 The Story So Far:
 =================

	The year is 2131, for the last half century peace has been upheld
 throughout the affiliated humankind planets by the United Human League of
 Civilizations. The peace was recently shattered when an evil splinter
 political faction attempted a military coup. Luckily the plot was detected
 early enough and was quickly quelled. 

	In the aftermath of the failed coup attempt the four main political
 and military leaders of this underhanded attack on freedom fled across the
 universe to retreat to their various planets and bases.

	It is your task to track them down and capture them, so that they
 may be brought before the Supreme High Court for JUSTICE. 

        (Yep it's another damn shoot'em up....*8^)
        


 Controls:
 =========

 Requires a single buttoned joystick installed in port 2 for play.

            Left = Will move your fighter Left
           Right = Will move your fighter Right
              up = Will move your fighter Up
            Down = Will move your fighter Down
          Button = Will make your fighter shoot (no bullet limits)

 Keys:

        (Q) = Quit Thesius XII and Return to you Amiga Dos

        (O) = Select options (Within the intro)

        (P) = In Game Pause (P or Joystick Fire Button to Exit Pause)

      (ESC) = In Game Abort
      

 
 Both the left Mouse button and the joystick fire button can be used to
 advance/skip certain screens..Such As the Terminal, OPtions, Intro
 & Highscore Entry if you require.


 
 In Game Icons:
 ==============

 During play after destorying selected ships/objects, you may encounter a
 spining coin object, with one of the following letters upon it. These
 Coins are POWER UPS, via shooting the Coin you can cycle it thought
 the various available Power Ups, To Collect it, simply move your fighter
 over it..

 (W) = Weapon Power Up
 (P) = Probe
 (D) = Shot Damage
 (M) = Missile
 (B) = Bullet Speed
 (S) = Ship Speed
 (A) = Bullet Area 

 Please Note: To obtain some of the above power ups, you might have
              to collect more than the one single icon to fully enable it.
              (ie. Player to Alien Homming Missiles..)


 Authors Note:
 =============

 Due to the fact that this is *NOT* the FIRST level in the game i've given
 you the player, a small shot in the arm via NOT making you start with
 nothing... *8^)

 (Now ain't i sweet ;)



 Bug Reports:
 ============

 Althought this is NOT the 100% finished version of the UNREGISTERED 
 release of Thesius XII, I am open to peoples feedback about bugs/Undoc'd
 features in this software.

 BUT PLEASE NOTE: This project will be revised when *I* firstly have the
 TIME and secondly see FIT to do so... I am deeply sorry for those of
 you who enjoyed the game 'as is' and wish to see it progress, but this
 is my position, so please respect it.



 Known Problems:
 ===============

 It's with some regret, I must admit Thesius does have some very annoying
 (in some cases) problems.... ;(

 * Icons        - Thesius XII Fails to run from and them, as it doesn't
                  path into it's dir correctly..

                  This can be overcome via setting up a script in your icon
                  that Paths into your Thesius Dir and then executes it.


 * Keyboard Entry - Upon some (??) systems there is a fault in the Reading
                    of the keyboard ... Where your entered keys seem to be
                    lagged/delayed.... It does this on my (ocs) 68000 based
                    A500... but as yet I've no idea why ;)


 
 Running Thesius XII Upon NTSC Amigas?:
 ======================================

 At present if your System features either the ECS or AGA chipsets
 well then Thesius will auto detect the NTSC signal and switch it into
 PAL.
 
 Upon exiting the game your native NTSC standard will be reset.

 No Rebooting or Degraders should be needed...

 PAL signal is required over NTSC for one main reason,

 And that being, The faster frame rate under NTSC (60fps) simply makes
 the game completely unplayable... *8^(

 it's hard enought as it is... ;)

 Although there can be some problems, that might occur.

 Some TV's and I Assume some Monitors also, DON'T like changing video
 standards all that much, and as a result will normaly ROLL !! or just
 refuse to display it period. 

 If this happens either adjust your Vertical Hold (if you have one ;) or
 hit (Q) to quit out of the game..

 As yet there is *NO* proper support for NTSC systems, By that i Mean
 resizing of the PAL (intro/terminal/highscore & option) screens to fit
 better upon the 200 line high displays.. and no needing to switch into
 PAL to play the game at the correct speed.  ;(

 People with NTSC Amigas containing the OCS chipset, I'm sorry to say will
 have to put up with the increased Frame Rate (until i find a better solution)
 , As this chipset (as far as i know) doesn't allow switching of NTSC/PAL
 or vice versa in software. Sorry!
 

 PLEASE NOTE NTSC USERS:

 Heres what you may not be able to see when running it upon an NTSC system..

 Intro Screen:  At the bottom of this display, which you should be able too
                see just a little of, Theres a bouncing "Press Fire to
                Start" Message. 

 Option Screen: Although you probobly can't see it, the very bottom OPTION
                is "BEGIN GAME" or you can just use the LEFT MOUSE button.

 Terminal Screen: If your lucky nothing important should be missing, All
                  the Action (so to speak) should be visable.

 HighScore Entry: At the very bottom of this screen is where you'd normaly
                  see your NAME/CALL SIGN whatever being displayed as you
                  type it, upon pressing return it copys this into the
                  TOP 10 listing.

 
 How Do I Register Thesius XII:
 ==============================

 At Present there is *NO* registered version of Thesius XII as the package
 is NOT completed yet, I will be working on the project on/off over the
 next 1-2 months, It should be fully completed within this time....

 Please Feel free to forward me your wishes to obtain a registered copy
 of Thesius XII or any feedback about it you may have.

 When the final product is completed, it will cost $15 (Australian) to
 register, this includes return shipping.

 When its ready i'll post various announcements to Usenet and Fidonet.
