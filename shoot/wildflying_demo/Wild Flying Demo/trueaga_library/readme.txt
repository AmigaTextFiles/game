trueaga.library_p96     - work only with p96 api
trueaga.library_cgx     - work only with cgx api
trueaga.library_p96&cgx - auto detect, dont use this version
                          if you use p96 emul on cgx

note for mediator users!
because of lame elbox crap, mediators doesn't work with p96 api, only cgx
emulation. Mediator users should use trueaga.library_cgx
