COMPATIBILITY:

Scorched Tanks was developed on an AMIGA 1200 with 2 Megs of Chip RAM
 and 4 Megs of Fast RAM.  It has been tested on an Amiga 2000 with
 1 Meg of Chip RAM.  It has also been tested on an Amiga 500 with
 512k Chip RAM and 3 Megs of Fast Ram


If your system has only 512k of Chip RAM or only 1 Meg of total RAM,
 it is suggested that the program is loaded into the computer with as
 much free Chip RAM as possible.


This version of Scorched Tanks has a special 512k Chip RAM mode.
 This mode reduces the size of the playfield and
 cuts down on the music to save Chip RAM.
 64 color graphics mode is also not available in this mode.


Scorched Tanks was developed using AMOS Pro and AMOS Pro Compiler.
 This package is supposed to compile programs to work on:

 A500
 A500+
 A600
 A1000
 A1200
 A1500
 A2000
 A3000
 A4000

Many incompatibility problems are memory related.
 Running Scorched Tanks from Workbench on a 512K Chip RAM machine
 may not run properly.  It could run out of memory or crash.

Also, some Workbench programs like Enforcer and 'screen blankers' have
 been known to cause problems with AMOS Pro.  
 FBL is also known to cause system failures with Scorch'.


Programs used to develop Scorched Tanks:
---------------------------------------

AMOS Pro
AMOS Pro Compiler
Brilliance 2
PixMate
Final Writer Release 2
Proper Grammar 2
Directory Opus 4.1
DSS8+
Edge  <- Thank-you INOVAtronics.  Very nice text editor that 
         I use for everything.  Excellent product.


INTRODUCTION:

Scorched Tanks is a tank warfare game where 1 to 4 human players or
 computer controlled opponents, take turns at buying fancy weapons
 and shooting them at each other.  The more damage a player causes
 another, the more money they get.  The more money a player receives, the
 larger the weapons they can buy.  This is a very simple concept, but
 extreemly addictive!

This game is related to a very popular game called
 Scorched Earth on MS-Dos machines.  I've only played Scorched Earth maybe
 five times.  But it impressed me so much that I decided that the
 Amiga needed a version too.  Scorched Tanks is very similar yet VERY
 different to the MS-Dos game.


'Tanks innovates where 'Earth and other look-a-likes leave off.
 
It's simple to understand, yet complex enough to be challenging.

The gameplay and interface are so easy to understand, an 8 year old can pick
 it up in no time.  It was tested on a group of little kids.  They spent
 two hours screaming and jumping around as they blew-up each others
 computer tanks.  Basically it's simple to learn and the interface's 
 layout doesn't take away from the game.

The graphics and music try to add the, all important, Amiga feel
 to the game.

It draws people that hate computers.
 (Only if you can force them to look at the screen!)

The Future
----------

I plan to finish the 100 weapons that I promised.
Modem play is still a possibility.
AGA graphics would also be nice in future versions.
And I'm still trying to give Scorched Tanks that commercial feel that
I've wanted for so long.  More graphics, more sounds, more music,
more of everything that makes me glad that I own an Amiga.

I'm 20 years old, have 2 jobs, and will be getting married to a beautiful
young woman named Sarah Bell on June 3rd, 1994.
I'm constantly in a struggle free time.  Still, I bent over backwards and
put in the extra effort to finish this game for the Amiga community.

If you enjoy this game, register today.
Do it for the sake of the Amiga market.  The more people that I can show
that Shareware DOES work, the more new games you'll see in the future.
Trust me, it will work out for all of use if we support each other.
   

\\\     The future is up to you       ///
/// Let me know the game is worth it! \\\


Updates
-----------
Anyone who registers this game will receive the LATEST registered version
 of Scorched Tanks.
 Currently, registered versions allow for more than 5 rounds and a handy 
 Load/Save game option is available.

Also......

 Registered users will then be able to get upgrades to Scorch' for
 $3.00 US.
 If you registered the game with me personally, then send me $3.00 US
 and I'll send you the newest version.
 If you registered Scorched Tanks through NorthWest Public Domain,
 then send them $3.00 dollars US when newer versions are released.
 
 

Registering the Game: 
 
 If you register V1.85, you will receive V1.90 which supports a
 Load/Save game option and allows for more than 5 rounds to be played.
 I only disabled those few options because I worked really hard on the 
 Scorch' Project.  I want to share what I created.  I cut the Load/Save
 options and the number of options so that people who play the game a lot
 can register and get the most out of Scorch'.  If your a serious player,
 these options are for you.
 If your not, then you get to enjoy the game for free.
 
 So register and show me that you want development to continue on this game.
 I'll need the motivation.  Besides, sending me ten dollars is one sure 
 fire way to get your ideas heard and to make a new friend.
 
   
 I would love to get comments and ideas.  New weapons ideas and 
 other options would be great. 
 I want Scorched Tanks to be the best it can be.  Please help me out.
