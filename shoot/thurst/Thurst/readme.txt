Thurst - "The game I've been planning for 9 years"

Noticed a bit too late that the deadline was already on
monday (good thing I did!) and therefore, the game is a
bit "unfinished" right now (but hope I'll get it more
ready by the weekend)

So, many features are missing or are disabled (or just
don't work as they're supposed to) currently.

This is slightly updated version, works MUCH better than the
first one... There will be "official" update on thursday.

Supported platforms:
The version entered in the competition is the windows version.
Currently there's also MorphOS version, and support for other
platforms (MacOS X, Linux/PPC, Linux/X86) is planned

The game was developed on Pegasos 2 system running MorphOS.

Controls:
Up: Thurst
Left/Right: Rotate
Fire: Shoot
Down: Special Weapon

PL1: Arrow keys + shift
PL2: SXZC + ctrl
PL3: 8465 + 0 (numpad)
PL4: jbmn + space

Support for joysticks & internet play is planned, but not
currently implemented.
