ChaosCastle - Amiga version

The documentation of ChaosCastle can be found in the 'English' drawer:

For a short description of the game, read the file 'Present'.

Nothing is required to install ChaosCastle. Just copy the drawer 'CCastle'
where you want. If you can read this file, it meens the program is ready to
be started right now. For further information about Amiga specific
settings, consult the file 'InstallAmiga'.

Most important things are explained inside the game itself; also, there
are menus to change the settings such as the language used, the graphics
and the sound effects.
If you want more explanations, some documentation can be found in the
files 'Game' and 'Menus'.

ChaosCastle is shareware; please read the file 'Distribution' for more
informations about shareware policy, and how to register and get the full
version (without playtime limitations).
