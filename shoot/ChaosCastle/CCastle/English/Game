                           CHAOSCASTLE - THE GAME
                           ======================


GAME'S GOAL:

 Enter the four levels of the "Family" zone; in each one, a fight against one
member of the alien family is waiting you; these are "Brother Alien",
"Sister Alien", "Mother Alien" and "Father Alien".
 To enter a level of the "Family" zone, you'll need to collect 100£ in the
levels of the "Castle" zone.
 To enter a level of the "Castle" zone, you'll need to collect 100$ in the
levels of the "Chaos" zone.
 You can always enter a level of the "Chaos" zone.

 Kill every aliens to finish a level of the "Chaos" zone.
 Find the exit to finish a level of the "Castle" zone.
In all case:
Destroy everything you can (minerals, vegetals and animals) to be safe and
collect every bonus you find to increase your power.


THE SHOP

 After each level, you enter the shop. There you can buy bullets with the
money collected during the game. Note that the more expensive a weapon is,
the more efficient it is.
 Use the arrow keys to hilight an item and press the spacebar to buy it.
 You can also load or save a game on your disk there.
 This is also the place where you can enter another zone, if you have the
required money ($ or £) (see "game's goal").


COMMANDS

 Use either the numeric keys [1] to [9] (located at the right side of your
keyboard) or the arrow keys to move during the game.
 To fire with the main weapon (Gun), use the spacebar or the left Alt key;
hold it down to auto-fire.

 At the beginning of the game, the other weapons are not assigned to a
specific key. This means that you can choose yourself the key you want to use
for each weapon; just proceed as follow:
o Select the weapon (displayed at the right side of the screen) with [+] and
  [-] (or [F9] and [F10]).
o Press the key (A..Z or F1..F8) you want to use for the selected weapon.
  (The keys CTRL and Amiga may also be used, especially if your keyboard does
  not allow you to press two standard keys at once).
o You can then use this key as often as needed to fire with the corresponding
  weapon, but also to add bullets to it whenever you get an "Extra bullet"
  bonus.
 It is suggested to assign a key to each weapon at the beginning of the
game.

 The game can also be used with a joystick. If you have a CD32 joypad and
the lowlevel.library is installed, the two buttons on the back are
equivalent to the [+] and [-] keys and can therefore be used to select a
weapon or to activate a bomb. The red button is assigned to the main weapon
and the three other buttons can be assigned to any other weapon, like the
keyboard's keys.


WEAPONS

 Each weapon has an associated bomb that you can use by holding the
shift-key down while firing, or by pressing both [+] and [-] simultaneously
before you fire (or the joystick equivalent).
 The two numbers displayed below the name of a weapon give how many bullets
and bombs are left.
 Before you can use a weapon, you'll have to increase its power to at least
one (the power is given by the number of painted squares in the grid
displayed at the left side of the weapon's name), and of course you'll need
to get some bullets. The number of bullets and the power can be increased by
some bonuses hidden in the "Castle" zone; they affect the first weapon you
use just after you've collected the bonus. Both bullets and bombs can also be
bought in the shop, but not the power.
 The main weapon (Gun) can always be used.

 Note that there are weapons which are rather hot while other are rather cold
and that some aliens may be more resistant to hot weapons, while other may be
more resistant to cold ones, or equally to both; just try and see !
 Hot weapons are better in the way they are less disturbed by magnetic
fields and are able to set on fire multiple items together; but they are
unfortunatly less efficient under water.


HINTS:

 Some levels are very hard (especially in the "Family" zone): it is a good
idea to do some levels in the "Chaos" zone to collect money and to buy as
many bullets, bombs and lives as you can before you enter such a level.

 There are only 20 power-bonus in the whole game: you will never be able to
use all weapons at full power, so carefully choose the weapons you add power
to.

 Each time you are hit, the green band located on the top of the weapon's
list gets smaller; this band is your actual "power" and each time it
disappear completly, you lose a life. The bonuses with a red cross, present
in many levels, can be used at any time to restore your full power.
