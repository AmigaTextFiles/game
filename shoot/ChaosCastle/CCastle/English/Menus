                     CHAOSCASTLE - MENUS DESCRIPTION
                     ===============================


'File' menu:
o 'New Game':
Leave the current game and start a new one.
Neither the score nor the progress are saved automatically.

o 'Load Game':
Allow you to load a game from the disk.

o 'Save Game'
Allow you to save a game to the disk.

Note: If you've finished a game and your score is one of the ten bests', it
is inserted in the highscores table.
If you load the same game from the disk and you finish it again, the new
score replaces the old one if it is greater. If it is less than the old one,
the highscores table will point on that old one.

You can press [TAB] before you start a game to look at the highscores table.


o 'Hide'
Close the main window and flush every possible ressources to allow the
execution of other programs. The game can be restarted exactly where it was
left by reactivating the program.
When the program is hidden, it is iconified or added to the programs menu
list.

o 'Quit'
Finding this menu's goal is left as an exercice to the reader.


'Settings' menu:
o 'Graphics'
Open a dialog window to change graphical options. Each option has an
impact on the game's smoothness, i.e. the number of time a second the
processor is able to refresh the screen. If the game is regulary hashed,
it is a good idea to decrease some values. Also, it is recommended to
test the settings in a complex game as the first level of the chaos usually
doesn't cause speed problems. The faster your computer is, the higher values
you can use.

Buttons' description:
 - 'Autoconfigure'
   When activated, every options are configured automatically at the program
   start based on the capabilities of your computer; else, the following
   options can be set manually.
 - 'Explosions'
   Set the density of fog and dust in explosions.
   Use 'Low' to improve the smoothness.
 - 'Rendering'
   Choose between a dithered black&white or a 16-color display. The option
   'Colors x2' generates the backgrounds using two layers (dual playfield)
   and requires a 256 colors display.
   The game is smoother in black&white.
 - 'Size'
   Set the game's size in multiple of 320x240. 1 yields 320x240, 2 yields
   640x480, 3 yields 960x720, etc. If your computer allows it, the game is
   displayed in full screen in most sizes; else, only a portion of the screen
   is used.

o 'Sounds'
Open a dialog window to change the sound options.
Buttons' description:
- 'Autoconfigure'
  Same as above (for the graphics settings).
- 'Sounds'
  Enable or disable sound effects.
- 'Stereo'
  Sound effects are in stereo (actived) or in mono (unactived).
- 'Number of channels'
  Set how many sound effects can be produced simultaneously (from 1 to 8).
  A too high number can slow down the game or be rejected if it is over
  the capabilities of your computer. With a low number, only the most
  important sounds are produced.

o 'Language'
Open a dialog window that allow you to choose the language in which messages
are displayed. If <default> is choosen, the program will try to use the
system's language, or english if the former cannot be found.

Notes:
The 'Save' button from the tree above dialog windows save the three settings
together.

If the program can not fit the requested settings (e.g. because of memory
lack), it will try to use the minimal settings (black&white, 320x240, without
sounds) instead of quitting.

o 'Misc...'
Allow you to change some settings which are specific to the Amiga version of
ChaosCastle. These settings are stored in the tooltypes and are described in
the file 'InstallAmiga'. This menu only works with kickstart 3.1, but with
older kickstart you can still change the tooltypes from the Workbench.
