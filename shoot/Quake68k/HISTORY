	- gcc/68k support.

19-Jan-2002   V1.40
	- Included AHI-sound and key-event code from Jarmo Laakkonen.
	  (stereo sound support for 68k still missing!)

24-Nov-2002   V2.00
        - AHI sound support (stereo) works for all targets.
        - Stereo sound for Paula (audio.device).
        - MorphOS-native version (no Paula-sound, only AHI).
        - Removed -nostdout option. Default is to do no console output,
          but it can be enabled by -console.
        - Cybergraphics is detected automatically, when the
          cybergraphics.library is present. Otherwise try AGA.
        - Removed chunkyppc.library support (too slow, too much problems).
        - Source text cleanup.
        - Fixed floating point alignment crashes in PowerUp/MorphOS
          versions (some mods, e.g. "Malice" contain unaligned
          floating point data!). It worked with WarpOS in the past,
          because of the integrated FP alignment exception handler.
        - Fixed problems with particles under water.
        - Fixed graphics corruptions caused by rotated submodels
          (used in some mods like "Hipnotic", "Rogue", "Mexx9", etc.).

31-Dec-2002   V2.01
        - Paula sound driver allows to swap stereo channels (-swapchannels).
        - Paula sound driver switches filter on when in water, to make
          the noise more dull. Is a similar effect possible with AHI?
        - The '5' on the number-keypad is no longer dead.
        - Mouse wheel support (untested)

02-Oct-2003   V2.20
        - OS4 support.
          Joystick support disabled - seems to make problems in
          current OS4-beta. CD-audio replay untested.

02-Oct-2005   V2.30
        - Implemented a simple GUI, using MUI, to make the program start
          nicely from the Workbench.
