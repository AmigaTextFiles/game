@TOC "MAIN"
How To Play this Game:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aim of the game is to mindlessly slaughter as many sheep as possible
in 60 seconds, or before you run out of Ammo.
Control of a Cross-hair is made via the mouse. When a sheep flys into
view, aim at it and click the first mouse button, BOOM, No More sheep.
If by some miracle an Ammo box appears then shoot it to gain 20 more 
bullets. If you have gained a hi-score then you can enter your name into 
he Hi-score table. Simple Eh?
When you quit, the Hi-scores are saved into a file Called "hiscore" in the
current directory. Dont try Hacking it, It is Encrypted.

P.S. Pressing "C" Will Make the Cross Hair Smaller (Making it a little More
Difficult to Aim).

@NODE "CREDS" "System Requirements"
@TOC "MAIN"
System Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You Really Need about 1 Meg of RAM to run this game, However, It probably
does run an a 512K Machine. But I have not tested this properly.

Also about 260K free on your HardDrive is required if you wish to 
install it.
@ENDNODE
@NODE "TEK" "Technical Information"
Technical Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program was written in Amos Professional and Compiled with 
AMOS 1.35 Compiler. The source Code is Aprx 1000 Lines Long (Small
Eh?), the Sound Files take Aprx 100K, the graphics take about 70K,
and the music takes about 80K.
I Drew all the game graphics and backdrops in D-Paint 4, and the Title
Screen was scanned from a hand-drawn picture and coloured in D-Paint4.
(Don't laugh, I'm a Programmer, Not an Artist!)
Believe it or not, but this game began from an Artillerus Clone I was
writing. I was half way throught it when I suddenly thought, Why bother?. 
So I used the firing routines to Shoot sheep into the air instead. Great.

My Amiga is a 2 Meg (sad eh?) A1200 With an 850Mb 3.5" Maxtor Harddrive. I
have had my amiga for nearly 3 Years now, before then I had a nice little 
A600. (How did I manage without a HardDrive?)
Before then I Had a Speccy+³, and Before then, In a Past life, I had a 
Babbage V2 Calculating Machine. Before then......

Sorry that this Amigaguide is rubbish but I dont really know many of the
Tokens, so basic Text and Buttons it is.

@NODE "AUT" "About The Author"
About The Author:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have written in total, about 6 or 7 games in Amos over the past 3
years, and This (besides one other) is really the first game I have 
actually finished. So I am quite proud of it. I`ve also Just done a 
Skeletal Version of a "Star Trek: TNG" Simulator. Its made especially
for Techies who actually know what "Asymmetrical Peristaltic Field 
Manipulation" is!!. (See Page 54 of The Technical Manual if you don't!)
I would appreciate any suggestions or Idea`s on how to make this game
Cool. So, if you have any, send them to me. I may also release a demo 
soon depending on the response I get. So....
If you would Like to get in contact with me to talk about any of the above,
to Swap PD or to have a chat about computers in general Then... 

@{"Contact The Author" LINK "con"}

Oh,  I must thank my old physics teachers; Ann Patterson, Dave
Seddon and Pete Britton for teaching me the Equations of Motion, without
which this game couldn't have been made!

@NODE "fut" "The Future Of SheepShooter"
@TOC "MAIN"
The Future:
~~~~~~~~~~~

As it stands, this game is basically a framework for a much better game. So
many things could be added...Loads of Weapons, Different Backdrops,
4 or 5 Sheep On Screen at once and End of Level Sheep. It certainly could be
much better, but I probably will not write Version 2 Unless anyone wants me
too.
So If You do like it then get in touch and give me Some Suggestions and Bug
Reports. I'm also on the look out for Ideas for new Games and Utilities to
write, so If You Have Any, send them to Me.  @{"Contact The Author" LINK "con"}

Happy Sheep Shooting.
