1. Introduction

This is a 99% arcade perfect version of Space Invaders
programmed in the summer and autumn of 2004 by Kim Fastrup
Larsen for the original Commodore Amiga systems.

The game now supports AHI sound.  In fact, it should now be
completely OS4 compatible.  I do not own an OS4 system
myself, though, and so cannot test it.

The game has been tested on an Amiga 4000/030.  I have also
tested it in WinUAE in various configurations.

Unfortunately, I did have problems with using monitor
drivers (as described below) in WinUAE.  I think this is
due to emulation issues, but I cannot be sure.

For these reasons, I would greatly appreciate any kind of
feedback (positive or negative) from anyone who tries out
this game on a real Amiga system (classic or modern). Please
state exactly what kind of system on which you ran the game.

I can be reached on the following e-mail address:

Features:

+ Programmed in pure C using Intuition screens and windows
and absolutely no direct hardware access (not even user
copper lists)!

+ Gameplay is extremely close to the original arcade game--
use classic tricks such as "shot counting" and "death row!"

+ The graphics are a pixel perfect copy of the original
game, except that this version runs in 7 glorious colors
(and I changed the text slightly)!

The game can be freely copied by anybody for anybody.  This
game wants to be played!


2. How to run the game

For any european (PAL) Amiga, whatever the Kickstart or
model, it should be a simple matter of starting the game from
Workbench, Shell or startup-sequence.  The game does not need
any disk resident libraries, devices or fonts.

For american (NTSC) Amigas, since the game needs a display
of 240 lines and NTSC only provides 200 lines, special steps
must be taken.

First and foremost, NTSC Amigas must have Kickstart 2 or
better to run the game.

Kickstart 2 users must start the game from Workbench.  Your
Workbench must have the PAL monitor drivers installed.

Kickstart 3 users can simply choose PAL from the boot menu.
If this is done, there is no need to install monitor drivers.

Alternatively, Kickstart 3 users can run the game from
Workbench, having installed either of the PAL, DblPAL or
Multiscan monitor drivers.

Of course, you should only install monitor drivers that your
monitor actually supports!

Installation of monitor drivers works differently depending
on your exact Workbench version.  Refer to your Amiga's
instruction manuals for details.  On most systems it's a
matter of dragging a file from the "Storage/Monitors" drawer
to the "Devs/Monitors" drawer and then rebooting.

There may also be particular programs, boot blocks or even
hardware tricks available to convince your NTSC Amiga that
it is really PAL.  Use them at your own discretion and risk!


3. How to run the game optimally

The gameplay is updated 60 times per second just as in the
original arcade game.  A PAL display is only updated 50
times per second.  So when the game is run on a PAL display,
the various animated graphics appears to "stutter" slightly
instead of moving smoothly like it should.

However, Amigas equipped with the AGA chipset are able to
produce a VGA-like 240 line display that is updated 60 times
per second.  This requires the Multiscan monitor driver to
be installed.

In other words:  For the best results, the game should be
run on an AGA Amiga.  It should be started from the
Workbench, and the Workbench should have the Multiscan
monitor driver installed.


4. Additional information for sound card users

The game will now default to using AHI for sound output on
any system using OS4 or newer. If for some reason you wish
to use audio.device for sound instead, you must set the
tooltype SOUND=Paula if you are running the game from the
Workbench, or use the argument "Paula" if running the game
from a Shell, e.g.:

 Invaders Paula

On any system using an older version of the operating
system, the game will default to using audio.device for
sound.  If for some reason you wish to use AHI instead, you
must set the tooltype SOUND=AHI if you are running the game
from the Workbench, or use the argument "AHI" if running
the game from a Shell, e.g.:

 Invaders AHI

If you don't get any sound when playing the game, try
setting the tooltype SOUND=AHI/using the "AHI" argument.


5. How to play the game

The following keys are used in the game:

 F1:          Start a 1 player game
 F2:          Start a 2 player game
 Left Arrow:  Move the laser cannon left
 Right Arrow: Move the laser cannon right
 Left Alt:    Fire the laser cannon
 Esc:         Quit the game

A joystick can be used to move and fire the laser cannon.


6. Version history

Nov. 5th, 2004: V1.0 - First working version - should
 run on any PAL/DblPAL/Multiscan-compatible classic Amiga
 system.

Dec. 5th, 2004: V1.01 - No longer requires gameport.device
 (though it is still used if there) as a first step towards
 OS4 compatibility.

Jan. 16th, 2005: V1.02 - Changed screen routines slightly to
 centre display on Kickstart 1.3. Also did tiny updates to a
 couple of random choice routines.

Jan. 25rd, 2005: V1.03 - First attempt at AHI support for
 full compatability with OS4. Let's hope it works.

Feb. 1st, 2005: V1.04 - AHI code was never invoked, as the
 game would always attempt to open audio.device first, which
 doesn't fail in itself on OS4. This has been fixed, so
 hopefully there will now be sound in OS4. Tooltype support
 added.

Apr. 11th, 2005: V1.5 - Command line argument support added.
 Minor sound frequency corrections.
