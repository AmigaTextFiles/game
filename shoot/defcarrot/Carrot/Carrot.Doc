Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This game is a kind of shoot'em'up, but with a difference.  I got the idea
from seeing a game called Bunny Killer on the Mac and thought I could make
it into something a bit more fun.  Besides, Bunny Killer had no sound,
nothing that could be said to be graphical and a gameplay that was too
simple.

And now, later on I am happy to present "Defender of the Carrot" for the
Amiga which is FREEWARE.  It is not crippled, it contains a High-score
table, Cool sound, and cartoon graphics.  Hope someone likes it!


Game Play
^^^^^^^^^

The idea of the game is to shoot all the Rabbit before they reach the other
side of the screen and eat the whole of your carrot.  The game is played by
using the Mouse.  Simply move the mouse to aim the crosshairs over the
rabbits and press the Left Mouse button to Fire a bullet.  However you will
need to remember to re-load the gun.  To do so press the Right Mouse button
and you will regain a fully loaded gun containing 6 bullets.

Each Wave contains a certain number of Rabbits which will attempt to make a
quick dash across the screen to nibble your carrot.  The number of Rabbits
to run across the screen are shown as a yellow number at the bottom of
the screen.  If the rabbits manage to eat all of your carrot within the
Wave then the game will be over.


In Game Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Left Mouse button  - Fires Gun.
Right Mouse button - Reloads Gun.
P                  - Pause Game.  NOTE: Press P again to continue play.
ESC                - Escape (Abort) Game.
                     NOTE: Pressing ESC at the title page will exit the
                     game and return you to Workbench or AmigaDOS.


Laying Rabbit Traps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another way of killing the Rabbits is by laying Traps for them to run over.
When a Rabbit runs over a trap the Rabbit will be killed.  However, a Rabbit
can only run into a Trap once.  Afterwards the Trap will disappear off the
screen and is considered as being used.

After every Wave of Rabbits, you will gain another Rabbit Trap.  Just
before the start of the next Wave you are given the chance to lay any traps
you have gained over the previous Waves.  By clicking the Left Mouse button
you are able to lay however many traps you own.  However, you don't have to
lay all the traps you own.  To abort the Trap laying process simply click
the Right Mouse button.

The number of traps you have is shown at the bottom of the screen as a black
number.

Hint!
Its Best to place your traps near to the carrot at the Right side of the
screen so that any Rabbits that escape your fire power have a chance of
getting caught by a Trap.

It is also not wise to use a trap just because you collected one.  Its
best to conserve your traps for difficult levels later on in the game.


Trap Laying Keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Left Mouse button  - Lay a Trap.
Right Mouse button - Abort the Trap laying process.


High Scores
^^^^^^^^^^^^

High Scores will be saved to disk (if its Write Enabled!) and will be stored
as a file named "Carrot.Scores" in the same directory as the game is in.
The file will be created the first time you get a new high score and updated
for future high scores that you get.

To flush the high score table.  Simply delete this file and the default
scores will be replace in the high score table next time the game is
loaded.


Enjoy!
