This is a quick and dirty port of Quake 3 for OS4. To play, you need the latest version
of the Quake 3 data files (retial version plus all patches). You also need the latest 
MiniGL.library (included in this archive, copy to libs:).

Unpack Quake 3 data files to a directoy (say, dh1:games/Quake3), and extract the archive there.
(As a reference, the quake3 binary should be in the same directory as the "baseq3" directory).

To launch, alter the q3 batch file (adjust the path according to your system) and run "q3"
from shell.

The port uses the QVM jit, so it can also run all the mods (tested with Urban Terror).

Source code is available on OS4depot.net too. The port is unpotimized, so don't expect it
to be blazing fast.
