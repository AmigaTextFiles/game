Introduction

   Tunnel  is  a game in which you control a capsule going down a tunnel.
   In  the process you should pick up power-ups and avoid collisions with
   enemy balls coming your way.

   Tunnel is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. You are
   welcome  to  redistribute it under the terms of the GNU General Public
   License, Version 2 or any later version published by the Free Software
   Foundation. A copy of this licence is included in gpl.txt.

   During  the  game,  you  can  fire  at  other  balls.  They break into
   fragments which can damage your capsule, so beware.

   If  the  game  is  too  slow  on  your  computer,  try  using  a lower
   resolution,  either  using  command  line  options or by modifying the
   options files.

The options files

   If  the  command  line  options are not enough for you, or you want to
   tweak  the  game's feel, you can modify the options files. These files
   are in the subdirectory data of your installation directory.

   The  file  named  options  contains  general  options like resolution,
   gamma,  full  screen,  audio frequency and key bindings. The ball_info
   file contains information, such as strength and maximum speed, for all
   balls. The level file contains information on different levels.

   These files should be easy to edit once you get to them.

   If  you  do  not  want to change these default files, you can create a
   file  anywhere  and use the --file FILE command line option. To start,
   you  should  copy the file options and modify that. You can remove any
   fields you like, as the file options is still read before your file.

   To  change  the ball_info file, copy it and then modify it. This time,
   do  NOT remove fields you do not change, as only one ball_info file is
   used.  After  your  changes,  modify  your  options  file  so that the
   ball_data  field in the game record points to your new file. The level
   file can be modified in a similar manner.
