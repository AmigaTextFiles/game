    This game was something Sprinter and I made purely for fun. It was
NEVER intended for an actual release! The whole thing was really just a big
joke. That was until we found the game «Aliens Lair» (Sorry, Frank Otto!)
a game created with SEUCK. We thought that it would have to be a lot better
than our game to make it to the Aminet. We were wrong!

    We decided the release our game...

    Important!!! We do NOT mean anything bad about Frank Otto! All we're
saying is that his game is crap. (Just like our english is!!) I use his
Amos-extension-thingy, you see... Thanks, Frank! =:·D

    The year is 2581, and the world is almost completely dead because of
lack of important gases and minerals. Scientists worked their brains out
to find a solution... They set their new super-computer on the case.
An Amga 360000, with a 450 GHz (GigaHertz) CPU and 1200 TB (TeraBytes)
worth of RAM. After 3 nano-seconds it finds a solution...

    At the planet Xymplog, situated in the Andromeda-system, only half a
lightyear ahead, are all the gases and minerals needed for the earth.
You and your mate gets the mission.

    Everything is just fine, until on the way back, where you meet.
Enemies!!! (The most original part of the story)

    The earth is depending on YOU! (That is you...) 

                                        (Yes, really...)


You control your ship the original way.

Enemies:

Here's a brief list of SOME of the enemies you can meet.

UFO        -   Unoriginal Flying Object. Shoots in all directions.

Teresa-UFO -   Lying UFO. Fires all directions. Oh yes...

BreialKis  -   Little ship that zips downwards while zapping ahead.

Mini       -   Little hwite spot that zapps around shooting.

Berzerker  -   A thing that fires like crazy, or something...

Flamethrow -   Shoots flames. Yes, indeed.


That's the ones I can remember, but there are a lot more!
