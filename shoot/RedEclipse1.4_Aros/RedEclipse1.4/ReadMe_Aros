....:Installation:....

This archive contains only the executable & docs. Game data needs to be downloaded separately from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/redeclipse/files/redeclipse_1.4/redeclipse_1.4_nix.tar.bz2/download


After downloading, extract the content of archive into RedEclipse1.4 drawer. You should
end up with following directory structure:

+-RedEclipse1.4
+---data
+---game


....:Running:....

Just open a shell in the RedEclipse1.4 drawer and run 'redeclipse'. Notice that the game needs a lot of stack, at least 
5000000 is required else the game/sdl/aros crashes.


Thanks to:

- Krzysztof 'Deadwood' Smiechowicz for compiling Cube/Cube2/AssaultCube in the first place.
- BSzili for pointing me in the right direction.
