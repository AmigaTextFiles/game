   Hello and welcome to the Latest Chippy game. Look out for other Games with Chippy like Chippy in
Perils with Plumbers. And look out for the soon to be released Chippy's Attack Zone. These are
available to download on the HomePage Aminet and Roberta Smith DTP (Different Titles though)

   The aim of the game is to shoot everthing. Press Space for the Shop when you've got some gold Q to
kill yourself (WhichI doubt you'll use and Esc to restart the Game. Don't ask me for the Code because
I accedently lost it. Please E-Mail me and tell me what you think of it and If you can visit my
Homepage.

   I got the Music off the Aminet so If you wrote it then Thanks.

Have fun Shooting those Dogs...
