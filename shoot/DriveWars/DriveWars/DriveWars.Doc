   Drive Wars is arcade-style shoot'em up where you, either df0: or df1:, must fly into the disk drives of other computers to remove the deadly computer virus in each. Iraqi computer specailtists planted the virus disks and chips in these units to destroy all information on Iraq.Finailly, you must enter the Cray II super computer and remove a virus that will knock out all of the U.S. and Iraq possitions in the Persain Gulf Crisis. Either destroy or be detroyed.

   The enimies in Drive Wars vary. Small lightning-firing chips and electric mice can be destroyed either by a fireball from your drive door or by hitting them from behind. Walking defective chips tend to fire electrical blasts as well, as do the stationary ones. All enemies except for the mice and flying chips must be destroyed by using fireballs.

   Cylindrical red objects are bonuses. Shooting these twice will destroy the. Spiked disks and 5.25" disks labeled "VIRUS" are tricky foes. Watch out!

   Walls aren't the nicest foes, either. Some are simply background, some are indestructable, some can be killed, and others even move. One level is only walls, so watch it.

   There are other foes who havn't been mentioned, but you'll know them when you see them. Here are some helpful commands:
            
    DriveWars can be reset by pressing both mouse buttons at the same time.
    Pressing the Right mouse button and Fire button at the same time.
    Player two (df1:) can play by pressing th Fire button on a stick in the mouse port.
    You get 5 lives.
    This game may be coppied. If you do give out coppies, please ask your friends to send the $7 (and up) Shareware fee to me.

    I hope you like DriveWars. It was the result of many hours of programming and work. And don't forget, this is shareware!
