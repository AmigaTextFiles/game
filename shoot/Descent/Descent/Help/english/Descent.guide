We make no warranties as to the usability or correctness of this code.

About the Source Code:

Included is almost all the source code to Descent 1, ver. 1.5.  We removed
all code to which we did not own the copyright.  This mainly involved low-
level sound and modem code.

Kevin Bentley, maintainer of the Descent Developer Resources and author of
Kahn, has agreed to support this code base through his website at
www.ladder.org/ddr.  If you have questions or comments about the code, please
go there.  Please do not contact Parallax Software, its employees or its
affiliates.

The following tools were used in the development of Descent:
Watcom C/C++, version 9.5
Microsoft Macro Assembler, version 6.1x
Opus Make, version 6.01

Have fun with the code!
Parallax Software Corporation
Jan. 12, 1998

Kevin Bentley's notes:

As included in this zip file, the source should compile and run with the 
following:

Watcom 10.6
Miscrosoft Macro Assembler 6.11
GNU (or compatible, such as Microsoft, or Borland) Make utility

To build the executable, you should be able to just run maked1.bat. 
Descentr.exe should be built in the main subdirectory.

When you unzip the archive, make sure you use the -d option to expand subdirectories, or it will not 
compile.

The compiled code will run fine with no sound, and no serial port functionality 
(This means no VR equipment that uses serial interfaces, and no modem or serial 
play games.)

If you port this to another platform, please drop me a note 
kevinb@stargatenetworks.com , I would be happy to post a copy of your port on 
the web site. *PLEASE* make an attempt to keep the existing code compilable (ie. 
use #IFDEFS)), so other people can benefit from your work.

To build the editor, change the CCFLAGS variable in all the makefiles to 
"CCFLAGS = /dNETWORK /dEDITOR" and rebuild all files. You will need the files 
in editdata.zip (included in this archive) to run the editor. Also, I was only 
able to get the editor to run using the -nobm command line arguement.

Interview with Matt Toschlog and Mike Kulas regarding the release of the
Descent source code:

Q: Why are you releasing the source code?

Mike: The main reason is we figured a lot of people aspiring to work in the
game industry would like to see production "quality" code.  There are two
reasons for this.  One, you can learn a lot by looking at working code.
Two, people will see that you can write a decent game without writing
beautiful code.

Matt: That's a good thing?

Mike: Not really, except that it might make people think writing production
quality code isn't that hard.

Matt: That's a good thing?

Mike: Well, not really, unless they learn that they have to focus on
designing a brilliant game, rather than writing brilliant code.

Matt: Ah, that's a good thing.

Mike: Yeah, I don't think I understood that until we started working on
Descent.  At first all I cared about was writing technically good code.

Matt: Then we ran out of money and all we cared about was finishing our game.

Mike: Right.  Our code got ugly, but our game got done.

Matt: Writing code is easy.  Finishing is hard.

Q: Is there any code you're particularly proud of?

Matt: No.

Mike: No.

Matt: I'm most ashamed of the vector intersection code.

Mike: Yeah, that's pretty bad.

Matt: Mike's AI code is the worst I've ever seen.

Mike: Only because you program with your eyes closed.

Matt: I'm proud we managed to finish without going bankrupt.

Mike: Yeah, finishing is all.  Who said that?

Q: Seriously, what should people look at?

Matt: I really don't know.  It's not like there's a lot of reusable code in
there.  Some low level stuff could probably be used.  The vector-matrix
library is probably fairly instructive.

Mike: The AI is an example of how not to write an AI system.

Matt: You're doing it the same way in FreeSpace, right?

Mike: Yeah.

Matt: The texture mapper is worth looking at, not that you'll be needing a
software texture mapper much longer.

Q: You're including the editor, right?

Mike: Yeah, people will be able to use our editor.  On the whole, I doubt
it's any better than DMB2.  And it doesn't run under Windows.

Q: What enhancements do you hope to see people make?

Matt: If an aftermarket sprouts for it, we'd be very happy.  People ask for
lots of little features that we just don't have the time to add.

Mike: People could probably roll in some of the D2 multiplayer features
without too much difficulty.

Matt: I don't think we can guess what people will do.  We had no idea how
much would be done with third party levels.

Q: The license states that people can't use the code for commercial gain.
What if some kid develops something and wants to recoup some of the cost
through shareware?

Mike: We're not opposed to that in principle.  They need to get written
permission from us, though.  And, it would have to be after the thing is
done so we know what we're permitting to be commercialized, if you want to
call it that.

Q: Any plans to release the D2 source code?

Matt: No definite plans.  Though, I guess I don't see why all our source
code wouldn't eventually get released.

Mike: Me, too.  It loses commercial value in just a few years.  And,
releasing it brings us closer to our customers, which is a very good thing
to do.

Q: Any final comments?

Mike: Yeah, have fun with the code.

@node INSTALL "How to install and use"
@wordwrap

First, get a copy of Descent I V1.4 or V1.5 for the PC.
The CD-ROM Bundle "DESCENT I and II - THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION" is still available in computer game stores.

Copy the descent drawer on Disc One onto your HD and unpack this archive over it.
If you want to save some harddisk space, it's also possible to play Descent from CD. An inserted Descent-CD
is automatically detected... :)

That's all - fairly simple, isn't it?

@endnode

@node USAGE "How to use Descent"

Descent can be started via Icon from Workbench or from Shell.
Make sure, that the stack is set large enough, as I haven't compiled in any stack extension code. An amount of 60KB should be large enough (if the game crashes, try to increase the stack).

One word about the used key mapping:

F11 is mapped to the DEL key and F12 is HELP.
That's because all Keypad keys are used by the game and I wanted to have F11/F12 near F10... I hope, you can live with it.


Some of the key commands are:

<R AMIGA><F>                    Enable the frame counter

<R AMIGA><C>                    Show the cheat menu


The currently added/tested commandline arguments are:
(You can specify them as tooltypes as well)

-verbose                        Show initialization steps

-fpu                            Enable FPU routines
				You should use that switch on a 68060 with FPU

-width <windowwidth>            Width of game window (defaults to 320)

-height <windowheight>          Height of game window (defaults to 200)

-smgame <screenmode>            Screenmode to use for the game

-smmenu <screenmode>            Screenmode to use for the menu

-smautomap <screenmode>         Screenmode to use for the automap

-amfx <audiomode>               AHI audiomode to use for the fx
				A requester will pop up, if no mode is given
				If this option is omitted, audio.device will be used

-mcmusic <cluster>              CAMD midicluster to use for music

-directgfx                      Make use of direct accessing the videomem on a
				AGA/CyberGraphX/Picasso96 screen
				If not enabled, WritePixel#?() will be used

-iglasses                       Enable display for I-glasses!
				The NTSC monitor must be loaded for this.

-volume <percentage>            The maximum sound volume from 0 to 100

-lowmem                         Lower the animation detail with low memory

-nolowmem                       Never lower animation detail

-nosound                        Disable sound

-nomusic                        Disable only music, fx remain enabled

-nomemcheck                     Disable memory checking

-noscreens                      Skip the briefing screens

-autodemo                       autoload a demo file at start

-text <textfile>                load an alternate textfile

-piggy <pigfile>                load an alternate pigfile

@node JOYSTICK "How to build the PC joystick interface"

This joystick interface is a little bit special as it allows to connect and use
almost (or every?) PC gaming device to your Amiga.
The four capacitors of 150nF are needed to compensate for different resistor values.
You can leave them out, but your joystick will have less accuracy then.

NOTE:
Some Amiga games need swapped X and Y axis, so if you have a lot of those games,
swap pins 5 and 9 on both Amiga connectors.

@node HISTORY "What has changed"

I started on 30th January 1998 with porting directly the PC source, as I don't want to make a port of a port ...

0.00 - 0.05     12/02/98

· rewritten Makefiles for GNU make and changed directory structure a bit
· replaced all DOS/conio stuff with dos.library function calls
· moved x86-Assembly into C by peeking into the Mac-Source
· named every unnamed struct/union
· packed nearly every structure as this is the way Watcom C/C++ handles them per default
· added TONS of byteswappes, inlined them and turned to assembly
· removed byteswap of ID-Strings in IFF-loader code ;-)
· ported error handling routines
· ported debug mini-system (disabled the exec.library/Debug() call for Int3() in this release)
· ported timer interrupt code via lowlevel.library/TimerInt
· ported keyboard interrupt routines via lowlevel.library/KBInt
· ported compressed file IO routines and changed some other places to use asyncio.library
· quickported graphic setup code, it's nasty right now and I'm blitting directly into videomem
· inlined fixmul(), fixdiv(), fixmuldiv() and sqrt() for better performance
· replaced all rand()'s and RAND_MAX's with own routines returning short instead of int
· cleaned up code a bit and added a few missing prototypes
· a lot more changes in nearly every file, mainly cosmetic changes ...
· made an icon and created this documentation

0.06 - 0.07     17/02/98

· rewritten loader code and got rid of all __attribute__((packed))s
· ported critical error handling stuff
· ported main() program entry point
· added support for different screen modes (no AGA though)
· ported graphic setup code and fixed automap bug

0.08 - 0.10     20/02/98

· rewritten and ported most of the canvas/bitmap stuff to support AGA ;-)
· introduced new automap bug (please don't use it right now) :-(
· disabled temporarly direct Cybergfx

0.11 - 0.15     27/02/98

· replaced FPU instructions with fast 32Bit integer routines
· fixed some gfx bugs
· fixed an Enforcer hit caused by fix_fastsincos()
· added support for direct video on CyberGraphX/Picasso96 screens
· finally ported the ModeX stuff in automap mode
· made some small optimizations

0.16 - 0.20     06/03/98

· fixed a small accuracy bug in the palette code
· fixed a bug in the demo playback code
· made automap autoscrolling when no 320x400 mode is available
· added a switch to disable the mousepointer
· turned fixedpoint library to assembly, using 64Bit integer math on
  68020-40 and FPU instructions on 68060

0.21 - 0.25     12/03/98

· oops, direct video access was never used during game - fixed
· fixed a hashtable bug in the automapper and changed the algorithm to the faster one used in the Mac port
· PC keyboards don't create scancode zero, but so do AMIGA keyboards.
  Thus, taking zero as an error code isn't such a good thing - fixed
· added c2p routines by Aki Laukkanen, modified for being able to c2p at odd addresses
· changed the window shrinking stepsize to 32, for better chipmem-alignment
· turned the vector/matrix library to assembly, again using 64Bit integer math on 68020-40 and FPU instructions on 68060
· added extra lores mode
· lots of other small things I've forgotten

0.26 - 0.30     22/03/98

· changed position of framecounter a bit
· set interpolation method after each level back to linear
· fixed some nasty bugs in the assembly version of vector/matrix-library
· simplified the c2p-routines for masked writes
· reenabled the screenmode-requesters
· bitmaps are now always locked under CyberGfx/P96 when accessed directly
· fixed some canvas bugs in the original sources
· some 2d routines turned to assembly
· recompiled with EGCS
· disabled doublebuffering - it isn't needed on an Amiga
· added tooltypes
· added sound (sort of...)

0.31 - 0.34     04/04/98

· debugged sound and switched from function API to device API of AHI as it isn't possible to access the sound hardware with different tasks at the same time
· written fast sound mixing routines for up to 16 different stereo FX
· fixed some bugs in the loader/save-code for config-files

0.35 - 0.39     23/04/98

· completey rewritten sound system once again - but now I'm satisfied: ;)
  · again using lowlevel API of AHI (it's simply MUCH faster)
  · now using audio interrupts with -directsfx
  · improved soundquality a lot with -directsfx (nearly no mixing dependent distortion)
  · added switch for disabling the lowpass filter
· removed asyncio (increasing the buffer size of the partition does the same job)
· fixed a whole bunch of load/save bugs
· PCX loading was still non-linear at some places
· fixed rearview with -directgfx
· removed timer interrupt - it isn't needed anymore
· now using timer.device for timing instead of lowlevel.library
· ...

0.40 - 0.43     11/05/98

· removed keyboard interrupt, now uses IDCMP and doesn't require lowlevel.library anymore
· changed the VR-devices code as it was a little f*cked up in V1.5 imho
· I-glasses! mode now always opens a NTSC mode
· game crashed if no screenmodes were available - fixed
· pattern matching now uses #? instead of *
· optimized the sound system and increased DMA buffer size
· removed a lot of unused PC code
· bitmaps aren't locked anymore with directgfx - it's simply faster and shorter also custom C2P now requires directgfx to be specified
· added mouse support
· changed default keyboard settings a bit to be the same as in the original code
· removed OS version check as I'm using the auto library opening feature of libnix now
· no shell window anymore when started from workbench
· disabled <CTRL>-<C> handling and added version string

0.44 - 0.50     28/05/98

· oops, screen saving didn't work anymore - fixed
· removed the 640x480 screen size limitation (nice slideshow in 1600x1200 ;))
· made the game to use perspective texturemapping instead of linear
· converted texturemapping library inner loops to assembly
· fixed all bugs that I've found in the C versions of the mapper
· fixed a small bug in vector/matrix library
· fine-tuned fixedpoint library and vector/matrix library to avoid pipeline stalls on 68060
· removed -directsfx as it's obsolete: just don't specify -amsound
· removed -nofilter because I only allocate two channels and felt like this was a hack
· removed -nopointer, you'll soon know why...
· added NewIcons by Luca 'Hexaä' Longone

0.51 - 0.54     02/07/98

· -fpu now has to be used even on 68060, as there may be future low-end accelerators which don't have a FPU
· changed -amsound to -amfx (don't ask why...)
· the argument parser could cause Enforcer hits - fixed
· the game could hang, if sound allocation failed - fixed
· the pixel aspect was wrong including r0.50 - fixed
· swapped left and right channel to be the same like with AHI
· the sound system can now use any of the four stereochannel combinations
· increased sound volume with less than 16 channels
· debugged and optimized texture mapper outer loops (still C...)
· converted 3d library clipping and drawing parts to assembler
· screen sizing is now possible on PAL screens as well
· added localization
· fixed some longjmp() bugs
· recompiled with EGCS 1.0.2
· guide is now using wordwrap for better readability
· added icons by Jürgen Urbanek

0.55 - 0.57     15/07/98

· fixed some bugs in the localization routines
· added Danish, Spanish and German catalogs
· added support for music with camd.library (currently beta)
· ...

0.58 - 0.62     26/09/98

· now opens locale.library v38
· updated the German guide and catalogs (thanks, Jürgen!)
· fixed a bug in the MIDI message collector
· MIDI timing routine was 3% too slow, also converted to assembly
· MIDI songs can loop now
· increased soundchannels to 32 and doubled the sound volume
· added options to specify the dimensions of the game window
· length- and speed optimized the texturemapper inner loops a bit
· tried different caching modes for the render buffers, but had to find out that Copyback is still fastest
· added support for all kinds of analog joysticks
· Descent can be played from CD now

@node FUTURE "What time will bring"

· make a 3d accelerated version for Virge (already in the work, no high priority though)
· support for ECS (is it really worth it?)
· networking and modem support
· turn 3D engine back to assembly (partially done already)
· port the editor
· make a version for PowerPC (sorry, this will have to wait as I don't have the money right now)
· many other things that might be implemented, like Descent in a WB-Window, Overlay ...

"Where's the source?" you might ask.
Well, I might include it in one of the following versions, as soon as it is in a bit better state (mainly remove all the terrible warnings when compiling and remove all the unused PC-stuff...).

@endnode

@node FAQ "What, How, When...?"

Q: Descent exits with "Not enough strings in text file" or something like that!
A: You're using pre-V1.4 .pig/.hog-files or the shareware-files which currently don't work with Descent.

Q: Why do the walls look so curious when I fly near them? Am I stoned?
A: This one is fixed with r0.50!

Q: The screenmode requesters don't show up, what's wrong?
A: No problem anymore with r0.62!

Q: When will there be a PPC-version?
A: As soon as I have enough money to buy a PowerUP board.
   But I'll release my sources with r1.00, so there may be other people who want to do this.

Q: Why is the sound that low?
A: With r0.62, the sound is boosted to maximum without distortion...

Q: Descent crashes on my Apollo '060 accelerator!
A: The 68060.library that comes with Apollo boards seems to have some serious bugs, please use the Phase5 ones instead.
