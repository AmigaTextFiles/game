Okay readers, this one's pretty simple.  Cow Wars is a two player game
the object of which is to blow up your opponent before he or she can
blow you up.  Each player must lob 3 different cows (one glass,  one
real, and one styrofoam) over a mountain and land them on the other
player.  Which cow a player has to lob is a function of providence so
don't go trying to select one cow over another.  When all three cows
have found their mark the game ends, but any cow in the air has a  
chance to land so ties are possible.

Sound easy?  There are complications.  Wind can play a very nasty role   
in where your cows end up.  A real cow is a pretty heavy beast and so
the wind won't affect it much.  Glass is affected somewhat more.  And
styrofoam -- forget it.  Don't even bother launching a styrofoam cow
into a strong wind.  There's no telling where it will come down.
Another obstacle is the Fire Penguin who floats above the playing
field.  He doesn't like people and gets a kick out of snatching (well,
bumping) their cows out of the sky.

To aim your cows you use the joystick.  Up and down changes the gun
angle.  Left and right changes the size of the powder charge.

Cow Wars has lots of user definable options because that's the way I
think games ought to be.  Below is a list of options and their
corresponding keys:

     W - Sets maximum speed of the wind and how often it changes.
     M - How high the mountain in the middle is.
     B - The borders of the cannon movement.  Width is how far the
         cannon can travel and Center is the spot its movement is
         centered around.
     S - Speed of cannons.  Very slow up to around 990.
     R - Stands for random.  Press R and then any of the above keys to  
         pick a random value.  Pressing RR will randomly reset every
         parameter.
     Q - Quits current game.

The game always starts with the above parameters picked at random.
Have fun.  Materials Used:

Deluxe Paint III - Everything visual.  Actually the background screen,   
complete with the Fire Penguin, was part of something I had drawn
during a penguin art phase of mine long before beginning this program.

AMOS Creator and Compiler - It wouldn't have been possible without
these.  Highly recomended for anyone who wants to do game programming,
but doesn't care to learn every corner of the Amiga's insides.  Weird
learning curve though so watch out.

Sound Editor - Shareware sound editing utility.

Various PD and mouth made sound effects.  Mouth effects digitized into   
a Mac II si and transfered to the Amiga usig Dos-2-Dos.  Actually, I   
originally intended to write a plain old cannon game, sans cows, since   
a friend and I had had such a fun time playing one back on the old   
Apple II plus.  But the only disk of sounds I had was a PD Animal   
Noise disk and I though the idea of a cannon going moo was more inter-  
esting.  The cow thing developed from there.

This program is Public Domain.  This means that you can give it to
anyone you want free and you aren't even being bad.  If you like Cow
Wars check out Wabes another PD programs I've put out.  Wabes is a
maze/ghost/yellow-dot-chomping sort of an affair with the option of
having two guys on the screen at the same time controlled by different
players.
