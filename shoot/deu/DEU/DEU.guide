DOOM is a trademark of id Software.
DEU has been created by Brendon Wyber and Raphal Quinet and ported to the
Amiga by Ian Gledhill.
DEU is NOT an id Software product.

This version of DEU is a port from the Unix version which was written by
Brendon Wyber (b.wyber@csc.canterbury.ac.nz) and Raphal Quinet
(quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be).

@{b}The current DEU is an alpha version@{ub}. This means that stability is
not perfect and it may still produce Enforcer hits. However, it has been
tested on several systems and has proven quite reliable. If you have delicate
information on your hard drive, it may be an idea to use a temporary
partition to assure yourself.

The latest versions of DEU are available from the Doom Editor Utilities site:
@{b}http://www.aber.ac.uk/~img4@{ub}

You may use it with both the registered and the shareware versions of
DOOM, but you won't be allowed to save your changes if you are using the
shareware version (this is ID's will, since it might otherwise discourage
people from registering).

DISCLAIMERS

        DEU IS PROVIDED "AS-IS" AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE;
        NO WARRANTIES ARE MADE. ALL USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
        NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY IS ASSUMED.

id Software cannot and will not provide support for DEU.

id Software will not provide support for ANY file that has been modified
or created by DEU.

DEU will not allow you to modify the shareware version of DOOM.  It is
illegal to alter DEU to operate on the shareware version of DOOM.

It is illegal to distribute any registered version of DOOM (DOOM.WAD,
DOOMU.WAD, DOOM2.WAD or any others) in any form, original or modified.

By far and away the easiest thing to do is use the installer. However if you
wish to do it manually:

Copy the correct DEU executable and DEU.INI file where you want to install
DEU.

Edit the DEU.INI and if necessary change the location of the main wad (any
IWAD) and enter an approraite screenomde number. Don't forget to adjust the
screen width and height.

Lastly, make sure that DEU has a stack size of @{b}at least 500000@{ub}.
Don't come crying if you forget and it falls over...

Start DEU (Don't forget, it needs a stack of at least 500000).

You should then be presented with the prompt.  Use the following basic
commands:

    ?   This displays a list of commands and their valid syntax.

    EDIT [<episode> <level> ]
       This  command calls up the editor for the given map.  The edited
       level is then saved into a PWAD file of the given name.  If you
       don't enter any parameters you will be presented with a menu to
       choose from.

    QUIT
       This quits the program.

For starters, type:

    E 1 1      [Edit episode 1, mission 1 ]

When the editor starts up, it should display the map.  The editor will now
let you insert, delete and edit objects in the map.  In the centre of the
map is a crosshair (or your mouse pointer) which marks your current
position.  Little x's represent the Things.  Different colours represent
different types of Things.

Take a look at deu.txt for a complete explanantion of DEU controls.

- The shift key currently doesn't work. This will be fixed in future versions
  of DEU.
- The right mouse button doesn't work.
- Doesn't work with Doom 2. This may also be fixed in future releases.
- Creating an anti-clockwise sector within an existing sector doesn't work.
  This problem can sidestepped by inserting a polygon (F9) inside the
  required sector.
- There's no sound.
- DEU will not start if it is run from Workbench.

Remember, DEU needs a stack size of @{b}at least 50000@{ub}. If you do not do
this, DEU may lock up unpredictably...

Why not stop by either of these fine web sites? 

 Amiga DEU site: @{b}http://www.aber.ac.uk/~img4@{ub}

The official Amiga DEU site is wheree the latest versions of DEU are
released.

 Wadworld: @{b}http://surf.to/wad@{ub}

While light on general wads, Wadworld does have the first wad to be created
on the Amiga (and be publically available). It also carries general Amiga
Doom news.
