Did you DROOL over Wolfenstein 3D?!?  Blast a hole through those Dark
Forces?!?  Were you one DOOMed Space Marine?!?  Did you stop the Rise of The
Triad?!?  Did you get some action from Duke Nukem?!?  Were you not afraid of
no Quake?!?

That won't happen here (sorry).  But, if you're looking for some cool 3D
maze games, this is the place.  This Beta version of the game is (currently)
the only raycaster that will run on a 68000 without a FPU.  Of course, it'll
look like crap...the walls, anyway...but it's fast, at about 2-4 FPS.
That's the best you'll get on a 68000.

But you will get the following:

   *  64 Beautiful Colors on an Extra Halfbrite Screen...all of them in use
   *  Three Buff Weapons: Pistol, Shotgun, and The Three Gun
   *  Load and Save Game Options
   *  Three Different Enemies
   *  For you faster computer users, Full Detail with Texture Mapping
      wil yeild nine...count'em, NINE (9), different textures!!!

######################   Running This Silly Game   #########################

Run TheHuntIsOn.  Follow the onscreen prompts.  If you're running off floppy
drive, this may take a while, as it must index the Group file and load the
sound samples.

Once all this good stuff is done, the menu screen will come up.  Simply move
the joystick up and down to choose an option.  Start first with Adjust
Detail.  Move the mouse left and right to choose a level of detail, and up
and down to toggle texture mapping.  The FPS rating at top is a bit
misleading.  This does not take into account positioning enemies,
raycasting, moving yourself, etcetra etcetra.  Anything rated "A Very Good
Frame Rate" will probably do decent in the game itself.  Press fire to get
out of here.

Now, choose Choose An Episode.  There will only be one to
choose...Beginner's Luck...but it has seven levels of robot hunting, so you
won't get bored.

If you choose Help, or if in the game you hit 'H', you'll be presented with
the very large Help screens.  Move left and right to scroll through them,
and press fire to get out of there.  NOTE:  The Web Site referred to in
there is NOT up yet!!  I mean the Dragonfire one.  The others work fine, if
not all being highly commercial.

When the game really begins, you'll be facing a wall, pistol in hand.  There
are two bars on either side...on the left is your Health, and on the right
is your Ammo for your weapon.  When you get them, pressing 1-3 let you
choose your weapon-1 for Pistol, 2 for Shotgun, and 3 for the Three Gun.
You move by moving the joystick left and right and up and down, and hitting
fire lets you shoot.  Holding Left-Shift will let you run.  'L' lets you
load a saved game, and 'S' lets you save one of those said games.  '+' and
'-' adjust your detail, and 'D' toggles texture-mapping.  'H' loads the Help
info (like before).  'Q' quits the current game and goes back to the menu.
