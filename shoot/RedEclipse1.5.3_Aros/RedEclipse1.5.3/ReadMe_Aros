This archive contains only the executable & docs. Game data needs to be downloaded separately from:

http://www.indiedb.com/downloads/mirror/87522/112/a09deaaf6b05a2ce7ca392ae4f76839a

After downloading, extract the content of archive into RedEclipse1.5.3 drawer. You should
end up with following directory structure:

+-RedEclipse1.5.3
+---config
+---data
+---game


....:Running:....

Just open a shell in the RedEclipse1.5.3 drawer and run 'RE153'. Notice that the game needs a lot of stack, at least 
5000000 is required else the game/sdl/aros crashes.


Thanks to:

- Krzysztof 'Deadwood' Smiechowicz for compiling Cube/Cube2/AssaultCube in the first place.
- BSzili for pointing me in the right direction.
