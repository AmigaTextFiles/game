What?
-----

CheckIfCompressed is a small utility for use with the level editor of The
Killing Grounds (better known as Alien Breed 3D II), an Amiga game. It
checks whether a level data file has been compressed (ie. if the first four
characters in the file are "=SB="). CheckIfCompressed returns error code 5
(warn) if the file hasn't been compressed.


Why?
----

Some of the level data files must be compressed before they can be used in
the game, but you mustn't compress them twice. As some files (eg. the clips
file) can remain the same after editing the level, you may accidentally
compress an already compressed file. CheckIfCompressed is here to prevent
such accidents.


How?
----

Usage: CheckIfCompressed <file>

Included in this archive is a new version of the PACKLHA script that TKG's
scripts use to compress files. It has been modified to check whether the
file has already been compressed. Replace your old PACKLHA (probably in S:
directory) with this one and move CheckIfCompressed executable to AB3: (or
somewhere else and modify the paths in the script accordingly).

Also included is MAKELEV, a script that runs "linkup" and compresses the
data files. Run this after editing a level and you're ready to play.

CheckIfCompressed can be made resident.
