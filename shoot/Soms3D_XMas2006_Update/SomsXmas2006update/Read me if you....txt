Problem: Game is too dark
Solution: edit config.cfg in maindir and set vid_gamma 150 to a higher value.

Problem: Runs tooooo slow
Solution: Check if you got enought Video mem...if you got enought edit in config.cfg the max texturesize from 512 to 256(carefull this makes textures look uglier on your radeon) and the 
vid_depth 32 entry to vid_depth 16(also doesnt make it look nicer;). 

Changes:
Fixed Sound range
Add Silenthill noise effect
Add Bumpmapping for the overview map.
Hopefully fixed several reported bugs ;)
