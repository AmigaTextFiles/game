Wyrm Editor
===========
With this little program you'll be able to modify and create your own
class definition files and RC files (the class setters). In the future
(I hope that soon), the RWS and the Keys files will be supported.

Instalation
===========
The package consist on:
-The latest gamex86.dll for Wyrm 2
-the Wyrm editor (WE.exe)
-the new itemlist file (substitues the old one)
-this file (WE.txt)

Unzip the package into your Wyrm directory (overwriting the old files), 
and then execute the "WE.exe". First, the program will ask you for the
itemlist file. Then you'll able to edit your files :) You should take
the ones that come with Wyrm 2 beta 1 as base/example.

Enjoy,
