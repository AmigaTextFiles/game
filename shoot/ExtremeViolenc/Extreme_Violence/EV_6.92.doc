Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Extreme Violence is a nice game about cute bunny rabbits.
    - I don't think so...

    Extreme  Violence (EV) is a game for two players - you'll need a friend
and at least one joystick.  It has no plot.  It's kill - or be killed.

    Anybody  over the age of 4 should be able to figure out to play EV just
by  messing  around  with  it for a while.  In fact, if you're one of those
bizarre people who actually read the documentation before trying a program,
go  and  try it out now.  Just plug in two joysticks, press J, and shoot to
kill.   Ten points to win.  If you don't understand anything you can always
come back later.  See-ya !

Control Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

J - Select Joystick control for player 1
K - Select Keyboard control for player 1

(Player-2 is controlled by a joystick in port 2)

Player-1 keyboard controls (if you don't like these - use a stick !) :

    Q     - Up
    A     - Down
    O     - Left
    P     - Right
Space Bar - Fire

ESC - Quit game/program

HELP - Generate a new level (if a player is trapped)

Amiga + A - Switch between Workbench and EV

Secret Passwords - If I told you what they were, they wouldn't be secret.


    For  convenience,  the  game defaults to keyboard control for player 1.
This  means  that  you don't need to mess about taking the mouse out unless
you really want to play with two joysticks.  To select joystick control for
player  1,  press  J  at  the  title screen.  To return to keyboard control
simply press K.  Player 2 is always controlled by a joystick in port 2.


Gameplay
~~~~~~~~
The Arena
~~~~~~~~~
    The  contest  takes place in a large 640 by 512 pixel (4 screen) arena.
The  arena  is  made  up  of a grided floor and a number of randomly placed
rectangular obstacles (walls).

The Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~
    Each  player  has  their  own  scrolling  window,  which shows the area
immediately  surrounding  the  player.   As anybody who's ever played a two
player  game  knows,  the  idea  is to concentrate on your own window, only
looking at the other player's occasionally to see what they're up to.

The Violence
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The  aim  of the game, in case you haven't guessed yet, is to shoot the
other  player  before  they  shoot  you.  Each "kill" adds one point to the
victor's score, and the first player to reach 10 points wins the game.  Not
too  complicated, really.  Each time somebody wins, the game moves onto the
next  level.   On  each level, 2 more walls are added to the arena, up to a
maximum of 50 walls.

The Power-ups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Both  players  start  at  a random position in the arena.  On each level
there  are  two  weapons  power-ups,  which  have  various exciting effects
described  below.   You'll  soon  discover that you lose all your power-ups
when  killed, which can be annoying to say the least.  When the game starts
a  scrolling map of the whole arena is displayed.  This shows the positions
of  the  two power-ups and the walls, but not the starting positions of the
players.   Each  player  must  hunt  down their opponent, making use of the
radar  if  possible.  Player 1 (on the left) is shown on the radar as a red
dot , whereas player 2 is shown as a blue dot (i.e.  the radar dots are the
same as the colour of the player's hats).

Shooting
~~~~~~~~
    EV has a simple, but fast, weapons system.  Each player effectively has
only  one  bullet  on  the  screen at a time.  Pressing fire again before a
bullet  has  hit  an  obstacle "recalls" the bullet to the gun.  This means
that  if you hold down fire, the stream of bullets will only travel a short
distance.   In  order  to  make  long distance shots, you need to fire once
only.   It  sounds  weird,  but you'll soon get used to it.  The registered
version  of  the  game  does not have this limitation, meaning you can pump
lead to your heart's delight...

Additional "Features"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Occasionally, especially on the later levels, it is possible for one or
both of the players to become surrounded by walls, making it impossible for
anyone  to win (unless one player has magic bullets).  I prefer to think of
this  as a feature rather than a bug.  Pressing the HELP key will produce a
new, hopefully more feasible level.

    As  with  all  Amos  programs, pressing Amiga + A can be used to switch
between  Workbench and the program. 


Power Ups
~~~~~~~~~
Funny Map      - shows a map of the whole arena, in the same way as at the
                 beginning of each level, but at a ridiculously fast speed.
                 Not very funny, but it looked stupid just called "Map".

Bonus point    - err.. One extra point. No kiddin'.

ECM            - Electronic Counter Measures.  Makes the player disappear
                 from  the radar. This allows you to creep up on the other
                 player without them seeing you. It should only be used by
                 experienced players, since it can be as much of a
                 disadvantage to you as to your opponent.

Speedy Boots   - doubles player walking speed. Zoom...

Speedy Bullets - doubles velocity of bullets. Can be used in combination
                 with any of the three special weapons:

(note that picking up multiple speedy power-ups has no further effect)

Bouncy Bullets - Boing ! Special bullets that bounce off walls and the
                 edge of the arena. Most effective when fired diagonally.
                 Bullets stop after 10 bounces.

Magic Bullets  - enables bullets to magically travel through walls,
                 although at a reduced speed. Fans of the film "Dune" might
                 recognize the effect.

Power Lazer    - makes it very difficult to miss the other player.
                 Especially dangerous when combined with speedy bullets.
                 Good sound effect, too.

The  registered  version  of  EV  includes  even  more  exciting power-ups,
including seeking missiles, turning missiles, teleports and much more.  See
below for information on obtain the registered version for the ridiculously
low price of £5...

    Well, that just about covers it for the instructions. Enjoy the game...


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    NTSC  users will be glad to hear that the game should run okay on their
systems.   The  program  will  auto-detect  an  NTSC  system and adjust the
display to suit.  It won't look quite as nice, but at least it's playable.

    The bad news is that due to the large virtual screens and sound effects
used  in  the  program  you'll need at least a meg (that's one megabyte) of
memory.   (If  there  are  still  any  512k  owners out there - wise up and
upgrade!).

	If  the program quits back to Workbench when you try to start the game,
it  means  there  wasn't  enough free chip ram to allocate the playing area
screen  (it needs at least 400k).  Close any windows or other programs that
may be lying around the Workbench and try again.

    This release has been compiled using the latest version of Amos (v1.36)
and  should  therefore  work fine on A500+ / A600 / A1200 / A3000 / A4000 /
Workbench  2  / ECS / AA machines (and whatever other crazy stuff Commodore
have  developed  since  last time I looked).  If it doesn't it's probably a
bug in Amos, so blame François Lionet, not me !
