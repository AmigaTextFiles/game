What is Amega Race
------------------

You remember back in the old days in 1982 when you were playing Omega
Race on your VIC-20 and thought it was the best game ever made? Well,
after I bought my C64 I could not get over the fact that the C64
version of Omega Race sucked. So, in 1989 I and Mika Achren alias AD-
soft started making this Hires interlaced version of the game to our
Amigas. The game runs in 640x512-mode (sorry, no NTSC version will be
available) and as we have made every attempt to avoid flickering and
keep the screen refresh rate as high as possible (50 Hz most of the
time), we think we succeeded quite well (you may disagree if you want
to).


How to play
-----------

The idea is simple: Shoot everything that moves. There are three kind
of enemies: Crawlers which can change into viruses if left alone for
too long a period and mines. You can use either Keyboard, Paddles or
Joystick to control your ship. Every 4th lever is a special level
which has something especially difficult in itself. There are totally
32 levels. I don't think it is possible to play through them, but if
you do, please let me know and I'll create more.

Top-10 lists
------------

There are two Top-10 lists in the game. The first one is a conventional
who-got-most-points top list. The other shows what is the smallest
amount of points each level have been played through with. To get to
the rightmost list you must play fast and accurately. The Top-10
lists are stored to disk after you have hit ESC to quit Amega Race.
Included in the end of the game are my top scores. If you can play
better, just let me know and I'll make up something :-)


HD users
--------

The file AmegaRace is just a script to start AmegaRaceGame, which is
the actual game. There is a 6 second added delay so that floppy drives
have time to stop after loading the game into memory. If you are using
AmegaRace from HD (it seems to be totally safe, at least for me), you
might want to remove the delay to run the game faster. All you have to
do is change the only line in file AmegaRace from:
"AmegaRaceGame delay"
to:
"AmegaRaceGame"


Compatibility
-------------

Amega Race has been tested on a stock 1/2 Meg A500 with old PAL Agnus,
A PAL A1000 and my 9-Meg 68020 A2000HD and it seems to work just fine.
Actually, the explosion of players ship does look better if you have a
turbo card installed. If you have problems with your Amiga, please let
me know, since this version is still a test version and modifications
may be made if bugs are found. But notice that NO NTSC version will be
made of this game, since all the graphics should be redrawn to keep
the screen aspect ratio as it should be and that's too much trouble.


If you have problems
--------------------

This game is still a test version. I'm particularly conserned about the
rumor I have heard that this game would not work in all Amigas. If you
have an Amiga which refuses to run the game or crashes when running it,
please mail me and tell exactly what the problem is like. Don't forget
to as exactly as possible tell me your computer configuration. Thanks
in advance.
