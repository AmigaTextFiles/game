Disclaimer:
   I am not responsible for anything that Charr messes up and no
warranties are implied.


Distribution:
   Trade it, sell it, give it; I don't care as long as all original
components are left intact.  If you bought this, I didn't get
anything, so send me five dollars if you like the game (which you do
of course!).


Introduction:
   Charr is loosely based on Artillerus, an earlier game that I
wrote.  Artillerus was slow, quirky, and not all that good.  When it
came out though, it was the closest thing to Scorched Earth on the PC,
so it was well received- it was the best Artillery game on he Amiga,
period.  Then Mike Welch came out with Scorched Tanks, which was
similar to Artillerus, but a much better example of how an Artillery
game should be done.  It was slick from top to bottom and fun to play.
   I still wanted to add on to Artillerus, but there really was not
much point-  everything I could have added to Artillerus- Scorched
Tanks already had (why have two of the same game?).  I wanted to
create a "next generation" version for the gaming genre.  Thus, Charr
was born!
   The basic concept behind Charr is simultaneous action.  Many
different weapons can be fired at once and in different patterns with
each "bullet" proceeding independent of the others.  For example, a
lava can be flowing while another shot is still in the air and a bomb
is exploding.  There are only 26 weapons in the game; but when used
together, millions of combinations can be achieved.  This creates
 great variety and there are no scripted gimmicky weapons (like in
 Artillerus).  I've tried to make everything about Charr smooth,
professional, and open-ended.


Instructions:
   The basic idea is just click, then move the mouse left and right
to adjust things.  The rest is self explanatory; just follow the
instructions in the little help box in the lower right hand corner of
the screen.  The rest is very simple to figure out.


Thanks:
Bill Clagget:  Bill gave me so many ideas that this game would not be
what it is without him.  Oh yea, he composed the theme music too!

Tom Kirstein:  My main Amiga buddy.  Tom gave a ton of suggestions to
help improve Charr.  He also beta tested, painted the robots, and made
the nifty little intro (even if it needs an 030!!!!).

Mike Welch:  He gave me ALOT if good ideas- most having to do with user
interface and presentation.  Scorched Tanks 1.9 should be out about the same
time as this game, so look out for it too.

Bryan Schardein:  Beta testing and ideas.  He has a good analytical
mind (even if he is weird!)

Dale Grider:   An Artillerus subscriber who beta tested for me!

Acid Software: Even though I sometimes feel that I am fighting Blitz2
instead of working with it, it still rules!  The ultimate language for
writing games (among other things)!


Software used to create Charr:
Blitz 2
Personal Paint
DSS 8
Octamed v5.0
Quick Write
WinFract Pro
QBasic


The Future:
If the response is good to Charr, I'll write a weapon construction
kit and future versions.  I'd also like to write a good one-on-one hockey
game (TurboHockey sucks!).  I also just bought Watcomm C/C++ 10.0 for the
PC and am considering writing a DOS game.


The Author:
I am a programmer for Environmental Compliance Systems Corp. which is
a subsidiary of Orr Safety Corporation.  We create systems to monitor
power plants' emissions.  Believe it or not, the systems use OS/2,
which is not a bad environment to develop under.  ECSC is a
Louisville, KY. based firm.
