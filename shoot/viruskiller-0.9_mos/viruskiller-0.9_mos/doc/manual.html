<P>Virus Killer is distributed and licensed under the GNU General Public License. You can read
the full license by clicking <A HREF="LICENSE">here</A>.</P>

<P>This license agreement is shown the first time the game is played. IT MUST NOT BE REMOVED UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS GAME IN ANY FORM WHERE THE USER DOES NOT SEE THE LICENSE.</P>

<P>This manual is based on the downloadable version of Virus Killer as found on the Parallel Realities
website. Be aware that depending on the version of the game you are playing this manual may be incomplete or
incorrect in places.</P>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>The Internet was created by Microsoft and first shipped with Windows 95. It was accompanied by the greatest
launch lineup ever seen. A wealth of information exists for every taste, covering adverts for loans, adverts
for weightless, adverts for dating and pornography.</P>

<P>Unfortunately in life you must learn to take the rough with the smooth. Viruses appeared in great numbers
and are flooding into peoples' computers on a daily basis. But now you can fight them...</P>

<H4>Requirements</H4>
<P>Virus Killer requires the following,</P>
<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</A></LI>
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image">SDL Image</A></LI>
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer">SDL Mixer</A></LI>
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf">SDL TTF</A></LI>
	<LI><A HREF="http://zziplib.sourceforge.net/">ZZIP Lib</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>RAM and CPU requirements are currently not known.</P>

<P>Most Linux users will find that the required SDL libraries came with their system and are probably already
installed. If not, click the name of the library above to go to the relevant homepage.</P>

<H4>Installation</H4>
<P>Virus Killer can be installed in two different ways. The first (and easiest) is by using
a binary RPM package. The second involves building the game. It is recommended that you install via an RPM
if you are able to. You will require the libraries listed in the Requirements section whichever method you
choose. For installation from source you will also require the development packages for those libraries
listed.</P>

<P><B>Installation from RPM Package</B></P>
<P>To install from RPM simply use your preferred method of installation (eg - via a GUI such as KPackage
or via a terminal). If you wish to install via a terminal you can use the do so by typing
the following (remember to change the filename to match the name of the package you are installing),</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">rpm -U viruskiller-0.1-1.i586.rpm</P>

<P>Provided you have all the required libraries installed the game should install without problems.</P>

<P><B>Installation from source<B></P>
<P>If you choose this method you will need to build the game from source. This will require all the appropriate
development libraries (see Requirements) and some knowledge of building an application using the source code.
Open a terminal and use the following commands to extract, compile and install the game,</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">
tar xzf viruskiller-0.1-1.tar.gz<BR>
cd viruskiller-0.1-1<BR>
make<BR>
make install<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">*</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><I>* - You will have to be root in order to perform this step.</I></P>

<P>Notes</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Default installation target is /usr/games for the binary and /usr/share/games for the data</LI>
	<LI>Music and Font data are extracted to /tmp and loaded from there. SDL currently does not support loading
	music directly from memory. Also segmentation faults occurred when loading fonts from memory. These are
	only minor issues and should not affect the game in any way.</LI>
	<LI>Menu items are added for Gnome and KDE desktops. Games and Games/Arcade respectively.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Running</H4>
<P>Either type,</P>

<P CLASS="terminal">viruskiller</P>

under located in Games and Games / Arcade respectively.</P>

<H4>Starting a New Game</H4>

<P>From the title screen, press space / escape or return to bring up the main menu. Select Start New Game
and then choose a difficulty setting. The difficulty setting you choose will affect the way the game is
played, from the speed at which the viruses move, their numbers, their types and points you score.</P>

<H4>How to Play</H4>

<P>Ultimately the aim of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are scored by destroying
viruses and with bonuses at the end of each round. Depending on the mode of play the points you score will
differ.</P>

<P>Viruses will stream in each round from the various MS products and begin to make their way towards your
directories. Viruses can be destroyed by firing your kernel laser at them. This laser power is limited
and decreases as the laser is fired. Once the power is exhausted you must wait for it to charge up again.
The laser recharges whenever it is not being fired, whenever you kill a virus and whenever you pickup a
battery.</P>

<P>The actions of the viruses differs depending on their type. See the Viruses section for more information.
You should endevour to keep the viruses away from your directories whenever possible.</P>

<P>The number of viruses and the length of the round increases with each new round, and therefore so does
the difficulty.</P>

<P>It is possible to halt the action on screen with the use of a Thread Blocker. This is a special pickup
that allows you to click the Right Mouse Button and freeze all the viruses on screen. For approximately
6 seconds you will be able to destroy viruses without them being able to move or without losing any
Kernel Power. Note that this does not affect viruses that have already entered a directory.</P>

<P>There are also various pickups that can aid you in your battle, they are listed in the Items section.</P>

<H4>Items</H4>

<P>During the course of the game various pickups will appear on screen. To pick them up simply shoot them.
Below is a list of what each of these pickups does,</P>

<TABLE CLASS="blue" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="battery.png"></TD><TD>Battery - This pickup will fully restore your Kernel Power to maximum.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="clock.png"></TD><TD>Thread Blocker - Gives you one extra Thread Blocker (use with Right Mouse Button)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="bomb.png"></TD><TD>Bomb - When shot this item will destroy all the viruses on screen (except those within
directories) and then disappears. Can be extremely useful in frantic situations. It is however rare
so shoot it as soon as you see it.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<H4>Viruses</H4>

<P>There are three types of viruses in this game. Each performs a different action and are described
below,</P>

<TABLE CLASS="blue" CELLPADDING="5">
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="virus1.gif"></TD><TD>Green Thief - The green thief virus enters directories and steals files. It will then
attempt to take these files back to the security hole it entered from. If it is killed when it is
carrying a file the file is automatically returned to its home directory.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="virus2.gif"></TD><TD>Red Hungry Fuzz - Upon entering a directory this virus will eat a file and then
disappear. It is therefore more dangerous than the Thief since there is no way of stopping it
when it enters a directory.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="virus3.gif"></TD><TD>Flaming Skull - The most dangerous virus there is. It moves very slowly but will
destroy the <SPAN STYLE="color: #FFFF00">entire directory</SPAN> once it gets into it. You should destroy these viruses as
soon as you see them.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<H4>Game Over</H4>

<P>The game is over when you no longer have any directories left to protect. At this point you will
see the Game Over screen. If you have have managed to get a highscore you will then be prompted to
enter your name, if not you will return to the title screen.</P>

<H4>Misc Gameplay Information</H4>

<P>There are two other gameplay modes available. Unlocking them will require a little patience...</P>
