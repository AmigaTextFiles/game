Day 1: 7/6/06

Wrote most of the event system. Got the basic class structure sorted.

Day 2: 8/6/06

Implemented all the remaining classes. Wrote file handling code.
Can now load level and tileset from file.
Test.cpp has basic tests of ball, tile and level drawing functionality, as well as file access.
Added lots of debug statements, most of the problem was I kept forgetting to do SDL_Flip.
The Ball physics was a bastard. Problem was a typo. Fixed it one component at a time. Just about to try with gravity again.

Wrote a big chunk of the code to handle the options. However it isn't in use yet as I've been testing the smaller bits.
Also made a big start of the Game class, which will handle the whole thing.

The particles seem to work. Had an infinite loop in the draw bit as I wasn't moving it into the next element.

Next.... level collisions.
Got collisions working. Much better solution than the one in the last game, and probably a bit faster as it's
not always dividing/taking modulus.
		Day 3: 9/6/06:

Got penguin code written. Just in process of testing it.
Something's not quite right with the collisions. Check the offset alteration in collide.cpp :)
Glad it's all in one place now.
Did generic object collection class which should handle all the NPCs
Added penguins and their ability to die. something's screwy with the collisions though....  FUCK ME! TYPOS. REALLY DON@T LIKE THIS KEYBOARD< SHIFT KEEPS STICKING AS WELL>
Tried older version of GCC and that didn't work either. Going to reboot soon.
Did starfield. Still to test. Would be a good idea to have stars sorted so we don't have to go through all of them each time. But that will come.
Added weapons, they have code to collide with GameObj and hurt them accordingly. I figure there's going to be less particles that objects in a real level, so the particles can be looped through for the entities. In fairness it's going to require just the same amount of CPU time, but less code.

Have a bug where the distance the mouse is from the player controls the speed of the particles and accelleration. Can't see why this is happening. Looks identical to the code from the first game.
I'm thinking this could be a feature when I add in dual analogue stick support. it isn't necc. a bad thing.

As of 13/6/06
I have devoted hardly any time to this project. Wrote a bit of a bigger test map to fully test out scrolling.
Wrote the code to actually do the scrolling. Integrated the starfield.
Had a few attempts at sprites. Nothing good.
Added a sort into the starfield startup so the stars are sorted by their X position in the array.
Still haven't figured out why the particle speeds are dependant on teh distance from whatever's shooting them.
TODO for tonight (15th):
Collisions with enemies (I think I'll have it as only the player collides with other objects as otherwise it will start getting really intensive. -- sort of done.
Better AI
Got that done..

23/06/06

Been a long time.
Right, following fixes/additions:
* 45-degree tile collisions. Not tested in game but should work.
* Bouncing off enemies instead of sticking to them
* New tileset format allowing each of the 4 sections to be a diaganol
* reshuffled enemy class so it will be easier to add new ones.

25/06/06
* Enemies no longer pass through each other.
* 45-degree collisions work
* going to do an in-game map editor - wrote level saving code + most editing code
* Fixed bug where there was a 1 pixel gap between tiles.
* fixed bug where some graphics wouldn't display right (moved everything into BMP format)
* Optimized the collision code. The game now runs averaging 20% on my main box

26/06
* Editor works. Doesn't save yet.
* Pause function.

28th
I've re-introduced a bug where you can pass through walls. Bastard.
Enemies can no longer go through them though. Editor seems to be working well.
Generic function to get a member of a team who's in a certain range of a point.
Player no longer bounces off pengiuns.
Fixed collisions again.
Editor saves with S key.

29th
Did a new tileset.
Fixed problem with displaying on the laptop. Should convert all the surfaces to
the screen format, but for now running the X server in 24bpp.


Since then I've barely spent any time on this. (12/7)
Had some severe X troubles. Fucked my computer right up. :(
Added in particles for movement (trailParticle) and seperated out the particle classes into 2.

September:

not touched this for ages, Fixed the bug with the level not drawing sometimes. It was due to uninitialised ticker in GAME_GLOBAL
Merged in surface class, now to do rectangle.
Rectangle fucked it right up, reverted to using SDL_Rect. Tidied up + doc'ed the Game class.
Found + fixed bug with pause, where it would run really fast after unpausing it.

TODO:
Factory classes for entities.
recycle the surfaces and tilesets. Use a factory class for them.
Frontend + loaders. (game class etc)
More levels and tilesets - this is what I really need.
bugs: (features)
.
crap artwork
no sound
no music
Player can sometimes pass through walls. Wouldn't matter too much on the actual
game however as you would die before you got very far.
