'The  Age  of  Rock' is an action-game for up to 3 Players.  You must shoot
with  stones  at blocks to complete them to a rectangle.  If the blocks are
rectangelous,  they'll disappear and leave you some points.  The bigger the
blocks  are,  the more points you get.  But the blocks are coming nearer to
the  bottom.   If they reach you, you'll die.  And the blocks are even more
mean.   They  might come along in 4 different colours.  Grey means, you can
shoot at them everytime.  But red, blue or green blocks can only be shot by
ships with the same colour.  You cycle your ship-colour by joystick-up.  If
you  get  the  feeling,  the  task is too easy for you, well, joystick-down
increases the falling speed of blocks and gets you some extrapoints.

      Extras
      ------
  Sometimes appearing are two kinds of
  extraballs.  The blue ones get you 500
  bonuspoints, if you shoot them in time.  The
  silver ones get you the death.  They disappear
  on their own, if they are not hit.

          Bonus
          -----
      Sometimes you get into a bonuslevel. Here you
      have to shoot at the right time, to pass the
      door and get bonuspoints.  But don't hesitate
      too long.


              Display
              -------
          The blue field indicates, how far you've come
          in the level.  The yellow balls tell you the
          actual levelnumber.  And at the bottom you can
          see your score.

The Age Of Rock is an old game I wrote around 1990 and 1991.
It is an extended version of a videogame I saw called 'Block Hole'.
Last week I found it in my source-archive and polished it up a little,
removed some bugs and here we are.

Suggestions, Bugreports, Comments,
 anything is welcome and goes to
