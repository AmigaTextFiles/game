      This game is a rework of the old arcade classic "Defender" by
Williams. The object of the game is to destroy the aliens while defending
your humanoid buddies.
      @{"Landers" link "defender:Docs/lander/main" 0} start at the top of the screen and move down until they catch
a @{"humanoid" link "defender:Docs/human/main" 0}. they then take it to the top of the screen where they become
mutants. Once all your humanoids have been taken or destroyed you go into
space where all landers are @{"mutants" link "defender:Docs/mutant/main" 0}.
      @{"Bombers" link "defender:Docs/bomber/main" 0} just lig around leaving bombs behind.
      @{"Pods" link "defender:Docs/pod/main" 0} bob along until blown up when they release @{"swarmers" link "defender:Docs/gigler/main" 0} which home in
on you.
      @{"Baiters" link "defender:Docs/baiter/main" 0} appear later in the screen and are very nasty. They are there
to tell you to get a move on.

      Baiters, pods and swarmers can pass through walls.

      As noted elsewhere this is a beta-version and contains @{"bugs" link "bugs" 0} please
read the @{"relevent section" link "bugs" 0}.

      The menu at the start of the game allows you to select from a set of
cheats and to choose your preferred control method.
      If you use any cheats your name will not be included on the hi-score
table.
      Control is by joystick or buttons. Joystick control is fairly
intuitive. Smart bombs are fired with the space bar.
      Keyboard control is a bit tricky. I only included it because a friend
requested it, but even he does not use it. It is intended to mimic the
original machine but somehow is very awkward. The controls are:

            UP..................CTRL
            DOWN................LEFT SHIFT
            THRUST............../?
            FIRE................RIGHT SHIFT
            REVERSE.............LEFT AMIGA
            SMART BOMB..........SPACE

@node "require" "REQUIREMENTS"



         This game requires an AGA amiga with at least 2MB of fast ram (4MB
total).
         A fast processor is recomended.
         A hard drive is recommended.

         It has been tested
            and worked on
               A1200 `030 50Mhz 4MB fast RAM
               A1200 `020 14Mhz 2MB fast RAM
            but failed on
               A1200 `020 14Mhz no fast RAM
               A600
               A500

         If you have a diferrent setup and try this game @{"write" link "author" 0} and let me
know how it worked.

                             ------------

      An install script is supplied. However if you don`t trust my script
writing (and personally I don`t) just copy everything where you want it and
assign defender: as the drawer. It can be run from where it is but will not
be able to save the Hi-Score table to CD. If you do install it to your hard
drive you will need to have Viewtek somewhere on the path eg. In your C:
directory. This should be found in the C directory of this CD.

   @{b}@{i}@{fg shine}AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@{ub}@{ui}@{fg text}


      As mentioned elsewhere this is a beta-test version of the game. There
are several bugs I am aware of.

      The most serious one involves the colors. For some reason I can`t
figure out the game does not load the full palette. Whether this is down to
a fault in Blitz Basic 2 or due to my inept programming I don`t know. If
anyone knows of a solution to this problem please write.
      The temporary solution to this problem is that I`ve put a title screen
at the beginning which uses the same palette and used viewtek to load it up
thus loading the higher color registers with the apropriate colors.
Inelegant but what else can I do. If you know how to fix this bug from
inside Blitz2 I`d be grateful if you could write.
      Other bugs involve minor colision detection problems which I`m working
on.
      If any bugs irritate you a great deal please @{"write and complain" link "author" 0}.
