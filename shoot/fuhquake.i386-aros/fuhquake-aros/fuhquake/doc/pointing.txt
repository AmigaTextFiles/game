INTRODUCTION
------------

You can point to things and identify them and their location.
Unlike qizmo, FuhQuake does *not* hide pointing messages from you.
However, FuhQuake does not let you point to things that you do not
have a direct line of sight to.

USAGE
-----

$point / %x = item pointing to
$pointloc / %y = location of item pointing to
$pointatloc / %t = same as "%x at %y" 

You use the "tp_point" command to specify what things you can point to.
The usage is tp_point <list of things you want to be able to point to>

Possible things you can point to are:

"quad", "pent", "ring", "suit", "ra", "ya",	"ga",
"mh", "health", "lg", "rl", "gl", "sng", "ng", "ssg", "pack",
"cells", "rockets", "nails", "shells", "flag", 
"teammate", "enemy", "eyes", "sentry", "disp", "runes"

"powerups" is a shortcut to "quad pent ring"
"ammo" is a shortcut to "cells shells rockets nails"
"players" is a shortcut to "enemy teammate eyes"
"weapons" is a shortcut to "sg ssg ng sng gl rl lg"
"default" is a shortcut for default settings.
"all" is a shortcut for everything.

Also you can use "tp_point +item" to add an item to the point list.
Ex. "tp_point +pent" adds pent to your point list.
"tp_point -item" removes an item from your point list.

You can use tp_name_* to customise the names of things you point to.


DEATHMATCH MODE
---------------
In dm, you can't point to weapons if the deathmatch mode is 2,3 or 4
and you can't point to ammo if the deathmatch mode is 4.  This is
because pointing to such items makes no sense in those deathmatch modes.


PEOPLE POINTING
---------------
As of FuhQuake Version 0.26 you can point to teammates, enemies and eyes.

If you point to an enemy it will identify him/her as "enemy" (or whatever
is in tp_name_enemy".

If you point to a teammate it will identify him/her as "teammate" or whatever
is in tp_name_teammate.  One catch, if tp_name_teammate is "" (this is default)
then it will use the player's name instead of "teammate" etc.

If you point to eyes it will identify him/her as "eyes" (or whatever
is in tp_name_eyes".  You cannot tell if an eyes is a teammate or an enemy.

Also if the teammate/enemy/eyes has quad or pent, it will say "quaded enemy"
or "quaded pented eyes" etc.  You can use tp_name_quaded and tp_name_pented
to customise this.


TEAMFORTRESS POINTING
---------------------
In teamfortress you can also point to dispensers and sentry guns.
The pointing does not distinguish between friendly and enemy 
sentry guns and dispensers.  Use tp_name_dispenser and tp_name_sentry
to customise these names.

People pointing also works slightly differently in teamfortress. You can point
to all players in tf but you can never see their name (even if they are a 
teammate).  Their class however is displayed.  For example "enemy soldier"
or "teammate demoman".  You cannot use this for spy detection.  If you point
to an enemy spy disguised as a demoman on your team, then it will say
"teammate demoman" and not "enemy spy".
