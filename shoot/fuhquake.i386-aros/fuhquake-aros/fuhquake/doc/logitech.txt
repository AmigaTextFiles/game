INTRODUCTION
------------

FuhQuake versions with Build >= 275 support binding all buttons on logitech
mice.  This works with and without -dinput.  I have got all 8 mouse buttons
on my logitech mx500 working.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
*) You must be using a win32 binary (build >= 275) and a logitech mouse with
logitech's mouseware installed.

The following mouseware versions are known to work:
	v9.73, v9.76, v9.77, v9.78, v9.79.
The following mouseware versions are known NOT to work:
	v9.75.

You can download mouseware 9.73 at: www.fuhquake.net/files/misc/mw973enu.exe .

*) You must have mw_hook.dll in your quake dir (same dir where the FuhQuake
executables are).

USAGE
-----
Firstly use -m_mwhook on the command line.  Ex. fuhquake-gl.exe -m_mwhook -etc

You should be able to bind MOUSE4 - MOUSE8 in quake now and have it work
(you will have to use trial and error to see exactly which button on your
mouse is MOUSE4 etc).


CREDITS
-------
-m_mwhook works by intercepting the mouse messages logitech's mosueware
sends to quake, and making them the 'right' messages so that the buttons
work properly with quake.

The idea of doing this originally came from [EZH]FAN.
It was first implemented by BorisU in qw262.

All credit should go to those 2 people for overcoming the inadequacies
of Logitech MouseWare.
