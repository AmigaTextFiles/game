INTRODUCTION
------------
The -ruleset command line parameter is used to enforce competition rules.


POSSIBLE RULESETS
-----------------
At the moment there is only the "default" ruleset and the "smackdown" ruleset.


USAGE
-----
Use "-ruleset <name>" on the command line to use a ruleset.
If -ruleset isn't specified, then the default ruleset is used.


SMACKDOWN RULESET
-----------------
The smackdown ruleset differs from the default ruleset in the following ways.

*) The variables tp_msgtriggers, cl_trueLightning, r_aliasstats are disabled.

*) Many triggers are forbidden or restricted in their user.

*) Seconds are disabled in cl_clock except when using +showscores.  Seconds are
also displayed when spectating or playing a demo.

*) Timerefresh is forbidden during a match

*) If a server has no maxfps serverinfo key, then up to 77 fps is allowed instead
of the default 72 fps limit.


F_RULESET
---------
FuhQuake clients (build >= 275) will respond to f_ruleset requests with the ruleset
being used.  In future this may be removed and the ruleset simply displayed in the
f_modified response.
