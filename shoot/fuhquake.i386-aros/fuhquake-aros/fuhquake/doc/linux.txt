INTRODUCTION
------------
This doc explains some misc info about the linux binaries.


C LIBRARY VERSION
-----------------
You must be using libc6 (also known as glibc2) to use the binaries distributed
with FuhQuake.  Older C libraries (such as libc5) are not sufficient. To see
what C library version you have, type 'ls lib/libc.so.6' and if the file exists
then you have libc6.  All recent linux distributions (past 2 years) install libc6
by default.  Older linux distributions (eg redhat 5) use the older libc5.


SVGALIB BINARY
--------------

Prerequisites:
Making fuhquake.svga work essentially relies on configuring svgalib
properly.  Most linux distributions put the svgalib config file in
/etc/vga/libvga.config .  It's up to you to read the svgalib
documentation and configure it properly so that your mouse and keyboard
function properly.

svgalib variables :
vid_waitforrefresh: flips vsync on/off.
vid_redrawfull: redraws screen fully each frame (?).

svgalib command line:
-mode x : sets vid_mode to x (use vid_modelist in console to see what x can be).
-w x , -h y, -d z : try to set vid mode to width = x, height = y, depth = z .
-nokbd = no keyboard support.
-mdev dev = location of mouse device.  eg -mdev /dev/mouse
-mrate rate = define mouse rate (default 1200).


X11 SOFTWARE BINARY
-------------------

Prerequisites:
i) Have X configured and working using 8, 16, or 24 depth.
ii) If you want to bind MWHEELUP and MWHEELDOWN, you need the following line in the
"InputDevice" section of your XF86Config:
Option       "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"

x11 command line :
-verbose : print more info
-winsize x y : set window size to width = x, height = y
-width x : specifies window width
-height y : specified window height
-nomouse : disable mouse

Also if your mouse is behaving weirdly, try toggling _windowed_mouse .


GLX BINARY
----------

Prerequisites:
i)   Have GLX installed (get it from nvidia drivers page or use mesasoft software
implementation).  Obviously need nvidia card for decent FPS.
ii)  Have X set up and working properly.  If you want to run FuhQuake in fullscreen
mode then start X at the same resolution you wish to start FuhQuake at.
iii) I have the feeling you will need X version >= 4.0 and you may even need 4.2.
iv) If you want to bind MWHEELUP and MWHEELDOWN, you need the following line in the
"InputDevice" section of your XF86Config:
Option       "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"

glx command line:
-width x        : specifies window width
-height y       : specified window height
-fullscreen     : run in fullscreen mode (this will disable ability to alt-tab etc)
-nodga          : disable DGA.  Use this if you don't want DGA input support
                  or your X version doesn't support DGA. Same as -nomdga -nokdga .
-nomdga         : disable DGA mouse input.  Use this if you are having mouse trouble.
-nokdga         : disable DGA keyboard input. Use this if you are having keyboard trouble.
-gamma x        : specify gamma.
-nohwgamma      : Disable hardware gamma support.  Use this if you have problems with gamma.


Also if your mouse is behaving weirdly, try toggling _windowed_mouse .
