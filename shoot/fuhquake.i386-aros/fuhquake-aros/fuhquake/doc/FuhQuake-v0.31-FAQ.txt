FAQ For Version 0.31 Build 650
------------------------------

*Q1) I'm upgrading from v0.30 .  What changes do I need to make?
*A1) There's a few changes you need to make:

i) If you use a 24bit charset, you need to move it to qw/textures/charsets/XXX.png (or .tga) and
put "loadcharset XXX" in your config to load the charset.  You can change XXX to whatever you want.

ii) A few variables have been renamed, so you need to update your config:
gl_picmip_all has been renamed to gl_scaleModelTextures .  It defaults to 0.
scr_sshot_type has been renamed to sshot_format.
scr_sshot_dir has been renamed to sshot_dir.

iii) $serverstatus has been renamed to $matchstatus.

*Q2) I get an error about a missing "libpng" or "libjpeg".  What do I do?
*A2) If you are using windows, make sure you install all the dll's that come with FuhQuake v0.31.
If you are using linux, you need to install libpng (>=v1.2.0), libjpeg and libz.
All linux distributions ship with these libraries and most install them by default.

*Q3) I am using linux and I am sure I have libpng installed, but FuhQuake still says it can't find
libpng.  What's wrong?
*A3) Some linux systems, especially Debian, install libpng in a non-standard way,  They install
libpng but they do not create a link from libpng.so to the actual library.  You need to create this
link yourself.  Firstly find out where libpng is installed to ("locate libpng" is useful for this).
You will find something like /usr/lib/libpng.so.X.Y.Z where X,Y and Z are some numbers.  Then as
root do "ln -s /usr/lib/libpng.so.X.Y.Z /usr/lib/libpng.so" .  This will create a link called
"libpng.so" that links to "libpng.so.X.Y.Z" .  If there is more than one file with a name like
"libpng.so.X.Y.Z", then pick the one with the higher version number (X.Y.Z is the version number).

*Q4) Why are cl_camhack, scr_sshot_apply_palette, gl_fb_depthhack gone?
*A4) Because I removed them.

*Q5) What's this new loadcharset command?
*A5) In older versions of FuhQuake (v0.30 and lower), FuhQuake looked for an image called
charset.png (or .tga) and if it found it then that was made to be your console font.
Starting from FuhQuake v0.31, you can change your console font from within FuhQuake.
Put all your charset images in qw/textures/charsets/*.png (and *.tga) and use
/loadcharset XXX to load XXX.png (or tga).  "/loadcharset original" will restore the 8bit
font in your gfx.wad (this is default).  Note that the /loadcharset command is just a 'shortcut'
for the new gl_consolefont variable.

*Q6) I heard FuhQuake has inbuilt support for 'degeneration textures'.  What are these and how do
I use them?
*A6) Degeneration textures make FuhQuake GL look like software quake with d_mipcap 3.  If you don't
know what this is, then don't worry about it.  The following alias will enable this effect.

alias degeneration-2	"gl_lightmode 2; gl_scaleTurbTextures 0; gl_scaleModelTextures 1; gl_texturemode gl_nearest; gl_externalTextures_bmodels 0; gl_externalTextures_world 0; gl_picmip 0; gl_miptexLevel 3; cvar_reset gl_max_size"

See Q8 for more aliases, including how to disable the degeneration effect.

*Q7) Is it just me or have gl_picmip and gl_max_size changed?
*Q7) They have changed a great detail.  They now down-scale textures using a very accurate sampling
algorithm to give more accurate colour averages.  You cannot restore the old method, but 99% of
people will much prefer the new method.
See http://www.fuhquake.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2085 for screenshots.

*Q8) What are all these new texture commands in v0.31 ?
*A8) All of the following variables require a map restart to take affect.

i) gl_miptexLevel defaults to 0 and can be set to 0, 1, 2 or 3.  It is essentially a GL 'equivalent'
to d_mipcap in software.  It has no affect when loading external 24bit textures.

ii) gl_externalTextures_bmodels can be set to 0 to disable loading of external 24bit textures for
non-world .bsp models (any .bsp that isn't the actual map.  Ex. health and ammo boxes).
gl_externalTextures_world can be set to 0 to disable loading of external 24bit textures for the
world .bsp model (i.e. the actual map).

iii) gl_scaleModelTextures determines whether gl_picmip/gl_max_size/gl_miptexLevel affect models
other than the actual map.  Most people will want 0 (which is default).  This variable used to be
called gl_picmip_all .

iv) gl_scaleTurbTextures determines whether gl_picmip/gl_max_size/gl_miptexLevel affect turb
textures (lava, water, slime, teleports).

Here are some aliases demonstrating the new variables:

alias degeneration-1	"gl_lightmode 2; gl_scaleTurbTextures 0; gl_scaleModelTextures 1; gl_texturemode gl_nearest; gl_externalTextures_bmodels 0; gl_externalTextures_world 0; gl_picmip 3; gl_miptexLevel 0; cvar_reset gl_max_size"
alias degeneration-2	"gl_lightmode 2; gl_scaleTurbTextures 0; gl_scaleModelTextures 1; gl_texturemode gl_nearest; gl_externalTextures_bmodels 0; gl_externalTextures_world 0; gl_picmip 0; gl_miptexLevel 3; cvar_reset gl_max_size"
alias degeneration-3	"gl_lightmode 2; gl_scaleTurbTextures 0; gl_scaleModelTextures 0; gl_texturemode gl_linear_mipmap_nearest; gl_externalTextures_bmodels 1; gl_externalTextures_world 0; gl_picmip 0; gl_miptexLevel 0; gl_max_size 1"
alias regeneration-1	"gl_lightmode 0; gl_scaleTurbTextures 0; gl_scaleModelTextures 0; gl_texturemode gl_linear_mipmap_nearest; gl_externalTextures_bmodels 1; gl_externalTextures_world  1; gl_picmip 0; gl_miptexLevel 0; cvar_reset gl_max_size"

The first 3 disable 24bit textures, and apply one of gl_picmip, gl_miptexLevel or gl_max_size.
The fourth alias restores 24bit 'eyecandy' settings.
You may want to replace gl_linear_mipmap_nearest with gl_linear_mipmap_linear in the last 2 aliases
for extra quality at the expense of some FPS.

*Q9) How do I enable paletted PNG screenshots in Software FuhQuake?
*A9) "sshot_format png" is all you need.  You can increase "image_png_compression_level" up to 9
for higher compression (but slower write times).  This causes no image quality loss.

*Q10) What happened to $droppedweapon ?
*A10) It's gone, but if you need it just use alias f_death "set droppedweapon $weapon".  And no,
you will not be able to use f_death to automatically report lost when using -ruleset smackdown.
