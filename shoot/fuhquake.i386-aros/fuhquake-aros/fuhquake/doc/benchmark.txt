INTRODUCTION
------------
The following explains how to run some benchmarks for FuhQuake, and where
to report your results.  It will take about 30 minutes to run all these
benchmarks.


PREREQUISITES
-------------
You must have v0.27 Build 355 of fuhquake-gl.exe (type /version in console to
find out your version).  You must have the 24bit textures for dm3 and dm4
installed by the 0.27 installer (the 0.26 installer is OK, but 0.27 is
preferable as it contains updated textures for dm4).

Unzip fuhquake-benchmark.zip into your qw/ dir.  It should contain configs and
demos.  You can get it from http://www.fuhquake.net/files/misc/fuhquake-benchmark.zip .

Install fbca bots (needed for some benchmarks).  Simply unzip 
http://www.parboil.mailru.com/parboil/fbca097kt.zip
into c:\quake\fbca (except change c:\quake to your quake dir).

Use the default settings for your drivers.  This should turn off antialiasing
and so forth.  Don't do anything stupid in your drivers' settings to get more
fps.  We are testing quake, not video drivers.


INSTRUCTIONS
------------
i) Run fuhquake-gl.exe with the command line parameters for the benchmark
(and no other command line paremeters).
Ex. For Benchmark #1 (see below) you'd execute :
	fuhquake-gl.exe -bpp 16 -no24bit -width 1280 -height 960 +set gl_colorlights 0 +set s_khz 44

ii) Exec the config for the benchmark.  Do this with "cfg_reset; exec config.cfg"
except change config.cfg to the correct config name.
Ex. For Benchmark #1 (see below) you'd execute :
	"cfg_reset; exec fastest.cfg"  (type it in console)

iii) Type in console: "timedemo demoname" except change demoname to the name of the demo
for the benchmark.
Ex. For Benchmark #1 (see below) you's execute :
	"timedemo fps1"  or "timedemo fps1.qwd" (both will work, just type it in console).

After the timedemo is completed, it will print the average fps to console.


NOTES
-----
i) You must have vsync disabled.  The benchmark configs contain "vid_vsync 0" which
should turn it off for you, but if that doesn't work you'll have to find some other
way of turning vsync off (see your video drivers configuration).

ii) gl_texsort should be set to whatever gives you the most fps.
The default value of gl_texsort (depends on your video card) will give the most fps
for 99% of people.  Type "gl_texsort" in console to see what the default value is.

iii) sys_highpriority should be set to whatever gives you the most fps.  If you
close all apps before starting fuhquake-gl.exe then it won't matter what you set it to.
Otherwise "sys_highpriority 1" might give you more fps, but it might not.

IMPORTANT : Just because "sys_highpriority 1" might give you more fps does not mean you
should play with it in games, because there's a good chance it will make your mouse and
keyboard less responsive.  But we don't care about keyboard and mouse when running a
demo for a benchmark.

iv) gl_max_size should be left at its default value.


THE BENCHMARKS
--------------

If your video card can't run -width 1280 -height 960 full screen, then try 
-width 1280 -height 1024 or something similar.

If your video card isn't capable of getting 70+ FPS in Benchmark 3 then change
-width 1280 -height 960 in all the command line parameters below to -width 800 -height 600 .

Whatever you use, use the same -width -height for all the benchmarks below.  Remember what 
you used when you submit your results.


BENCHMARK #1
------------
command line parms : -bpp 16 -no24bit -width 1280 -height 960 +set gl_colorlights 0 +set s_khz 44
config name : fastest.cfg
demo name : fps1.qwd

BENCHMARK #2
------------
command line parms : -bpp 16 -width 1280 -height 960 +set gl_colorlights 1 +set s_khz 44
config name : normal.cfg
demo name : fps1.qwd

BENCHMARK #3
------------
command line parms : -bpp 32 -width 1280 -height 960 +set gl_colorlights 1 +set s_khz 44
config name : normal.cfg
demo name : fps1.qwd

BENCHMARK #4
------------
command line parms : -bpp 32 -width 1280 -height 960 +set gl_colorlights 1 +set s_khz 44
config name : normal.cfg
demo name : fps2.qwd

BENCHMARK #5
------------
command line parms : -bpp 32 -width 1280 -height 960 +set gl_colorlights 1 +set s_khz 44
config name : high.cfg
demo name : fps2.qwd


ABOUT THE BENCHMARKS
--------------------
Benchmarks #1, #2, and #3 test
i) The impact of 24bit textures, .lit's and model interpolation on fps
ii) The difference in fps between -bpp 16 and -bpp 32

Benchmarks #4 and #5 test
i) The impact of the new particle effects on fps in extreme situations

These benchmarks don't test dynamic lighting, water caustics, water fog or gl_detail
(for good reason which you need not concern yourself with!).

Bechmark #1 runs fuhquake-gl.bat basically with a config that could be run in zquake 0.14.
24bit textures are disabled, .lit files are disabled, model interpolation is disabled.
The qmb engine is disabled.  The map for the test is dm3.

Benchmark #2 is the same as benchmark #1 except 24bit textures, .lit files and model
interpolation is turned on.  The new particle effects are still disabled.

Benchmark #3 is the same as benchmark #2 except it is run at 1280x960x32 instead of 
1280x960x16 .


Benchmark #4 runs a demo with a *lot* of explosions in dm4 using the old particle engine.

Benchmark #5 is the same as benchmark #4 except all the new particle effects are turned on.

SUBMITTING RESULTS
------------------
Paste your benchmark results in a reply to the forum thread at 
http://www.fuhquake.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5593#5593 .

You will need to register a login at the forums first.

Use exactly the same format for your results as the ones given in the sample above.
In fact copy and paste the above sample result, and then change the sys specs, resolution
and fps to what suits you.  Anything else will be ignored (including adding sys specs for
your sound card and hard disk).
