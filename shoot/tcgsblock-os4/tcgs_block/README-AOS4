Another lovely JAP gem! This is a mix of modern jap shooters and the classic
Arkanoid. And what a nice game it makes! =)
This game is orignially a PSP game, and the screen is tilted 90 degrees to
the right, but don't let that put you down, it's PERFECTLY playable anyway,
think Krakout! 

The graphics, music and gameplay is top notch! I especially like the music
on level 2, make sure you hear it.

The controls of the game are simple, use the arrow keys. 

Arrow Up/Down steers the bat up and down.

Arrow Right shoots extra balls and fairies. For a frantic gameplay press the 
right arrow key 5-6 time when the game starts! 

When you have finished a level, press space to advance to the next one.
