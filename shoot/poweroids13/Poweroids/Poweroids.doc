   · Compatible with any screen that supports custom bitmaps!

 other display modes require more CPU power (the screen has to be updated
 more often). Use them only if you have a fast Amiga!

 ›[0;1;4mTool types:›[0m

   · ›[0;1mMONITOR=<monitorName>/<width>/<height>›[0m
     ›[0;1m(e.g. MONITOR=PAL/320/256)›[0m
     Selects the monitor and the screen resolution of the game display.
     This works only with Kickstart 2.0 (V37) or better. If no MONITOR tool
     type is specified, it uses the default monitor and 320/200.

   · ›[0;1mINPUTDEVICE=OFF›[0m -> Disables mousepointer and input device to
     get full CPU speed. In pause mode, both are active again.

   · ›[0;1mADAPTER=OFF›[0m -> Disables access to the parallel port. Usefull
     if there is no four player joystick adapter. Data sent to another device
     at the parallel port will be scrambled otherwise in multiplayermode!


 ›[0;1;4mTechnical:›[0m

   · Poweroids uses direct blitter access, so GFX-card screenmodes will fail.
     If you are using CyberGraphX, you WILL have to DISABLE the PLANES2FAST
     option or the game will even fail on standard screen modes!

   · Requires mathtrans.library and icon.library from workbench disk!

 Do you think there's nothing special about a game where you have to destroy
 asteroids? Well, you are right. These were my thoughts back in 1995 and so
