M*A*S*H Version 1
-----------------

Full instructions are available in the game, but a few small points should be
raised here.

M*A*S*H should be compatible with all 1 meg Amigas. On the A500 however,
samples may not load in. If you have incompatability problems please let me
know.

To run M*A*S*H, simply double-click the M*A*S*H icon in the MASH directory.
If it comes up with an error message the most likely explanation is that
some of the game files got corrupted. Mail me and I'll try to help.

This game will work from whatever directory you put it in, provided all the
game files are present. There is also a startup-sequence included in the s
directory should you wish to install it to a floppy.
