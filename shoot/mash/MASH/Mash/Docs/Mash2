M*A*S*H is really only a P.D taster of the full shareware sequel.
(and it still earned 88% from CU AMiga, 86% from The One, 84% from Amiga User
International !)

M*A*S*H II features :


Split Screen 2 Player mode 
--------------------------
	Player one plays with the normal mouse while player two either plays
with a second mouse or uses the new joystick/keyboard control system . The 
whole thing runs just as fast as the 1 player game .

New Shop section
----------------
	Earn money from your exploits on the battlefield so you can spend it
on more weapons, vehicles and hardware.


New Vehicles 
------------
	Tanks are now armoured, jet powered Zeppelins can drop bombs on the 
opposition as well as drop paratroopers , while troop transports carry 
the fresh eager new recruits to be butchered at the front line .


New Weapons 
-----------
	Landmines , Hand Grenades , Cluster bombs and Lazers !


30 New Levels 
-------------
	The levels get progressively harder and every five levels there is a
subgame of MASHInvaders to get some more money!


Water 
-----
	The same as in gravity force , except the spuds drown !


Indestructable scenery and traps 
------------------------------------
	Now you not only have to blow up the other guy , you have to figure 
out how to get there to kill him in the first place . The traps include such
wonders as The Inca God of Death and Lizzy the Spud Eating Venus Fly Trap .


Loads more animation & sound effects 
--------------------------------------
	More funny , more gory !
	

Much more advanced computer player 
----------------------------------
	You now have to deal with more intelligent red guys, Automatic Gun
Turrets and Zeppelins which parachute troops on top of you ( as well as bombs).


Handy little features!
----------------------
	Once you tell a spud to go somewhere he keeps walking even if you 
select something else. INCREDIBLY usefull ! Pause Mode. Password for each 
level, and option to print password.


If you have little memory ( e.g A500 ) the game will now load up sound effects.


All this costs you a paltry £ 7.00 or if you include your own blank disk £ 6.00.
