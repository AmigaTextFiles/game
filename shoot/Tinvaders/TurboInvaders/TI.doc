        Anyway, I would love to hear your comments, criticisms regarding
        this game.

        Really, it's purpose was just to make some contacts so I realize
        it's nothing spectacular. I only spent FOUR WEEKS on the entire
        project!

      * Sunday, 11-10-96, improved graphics slightly
      * Sunday, 11-17-96, improved graphics slightly and tweaked code a bit

        So, actually, Version 0.41 represents ONE MONTH OF MY TIME.

        This game was developed entirely by myself, so you know why the
        graphics are so poor, right?!






                        ***>>>  WHAT IS IT ?  <<***


             This is a VERY SIMPLE shoot-em-up. You control the ship
        at the bottom of the screen and attempt to destroy all the
        aliens while avoiding their fire.

             Every so often, an alien will release a power-capsule
        which floats down the screen. Catch this and your weapon
        will be 'powered-up' to the next level. There are EIGHT
        levels of firepower available for your ship.

             Each time you lose a ship, your firepower will be
        decreased by two levels, so avoid the alien-fire!!


             The object is simple: Complete all 22 stages and you
        win the game!






                           ***>>>  YOUR ENEMY  <<***


             You will battle three different types of aliens.
        Although they move the same, each have different armor
        and firepower available.


        The White Alien is the first you'll encounter. It requires
                        TWO hits to destroy. It can only fire
                        vertically and will drain 1 off your
                        ship's shield.

        The Blue Alien  will be first-ecountered at Stage Five. It
                        requires FOUR hits to destroy. It can fire
                        both vertically and diagonally. The diagonal
                        fire produces a different sound than normal
                        vertical fire. It's shots will drain 1 - 2
                        off your ships' shield.

        The Red Alien   will be first-ecountered at Stage Thirteen. It
                        requires SIX hits to destroy. It can also fire
                        both vertically and diagonally. Again, the
                        diagonal fire produces a different sound than
                        normal vertical fire. It's shots will drain
                        1 - 3 off your ships' shield.


             In addition to encountering different types of aliens,
        ALL aliens move a little faster with each new Stage. By the
        time you reach Stage TWENTY, they're really flying!!






                           ***>>>  TECHNICAL  <<***


             The game provides smooth, SIXTY frames per second, action
        on NTSC machines and FIFTY fps on PAL systems, IF you have a
        stock A1200 system or better.

             I must say that on a stock A500/A600, the frame-rate will suffer
        as this was developed on an A1200 system and it was only after I
        had compiled the latest version that I was able to see how it
        looked on a stock A600!

             Sorry about that but, the A500 was released ten years ago and
        it is now 1997. You really should have AT LEAST an A1200 w/FastRAM
        by now!!  Of course, I'm quite sure, more people would own A1200s
        if the prices had come down, rather than doubling!!


             I've had a few people ask if this is written in Assembly or
        if I'm using sprites....

             NO!! TurboInvaders is written, entirely, in Blitz Basic 2
        and EVERYTHING is being BLITTED. I am NOT using EVEN ONE SPRITE!!!!

             The reason it is, reasonably, action-packed, without Assembler
        or sprites, is that I have quite a bit of experience in code-
        optimization.


             Come to think of it, if I had used a little Assembler or a few
         sprites...... Well, that will have to wait for another game!!






                         ***>>>   JOIN  US   <<***


             I'm looking for talented/enthusiastic programmers,
        artists, animators, musicians,  and designers to join
        Unlimited Design.

             We are a new software developer, established earlier
        this year, currently working on two AGA games due for release
        within the next five months.

             Currently, there are six of us, located in both the USA
             and England (one designer, two programmers, two artists
             and one musician).

             If you:

             1. Are willing to give Unlimited Design 30 hours, or
                more, of your time each week, doing what you do
                best: Programming, Designing, Composing Music,
                Creating Still Graphics-Images, Animating, etc!

             2. Would like to be involved in the development of some
                of the best commercial software available for the Amiga,
                then...

                        CONTACT ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!!


        I don't care if you are coding in Amos, Blitz, C or Assembly!
        As long as you are willing to learn Blitz (or Assembly) you
        will be able to contribute to the projects.

        We are also looking for high-quality artists/animators
        to work in our Graphics Department as well as superb musicians
        for the Music Department.

        Even if you don't currently program, create graphics or
        music, but you have a STRONG DESIRE to be involved in
        software development!


        Just send a sample of your work to the following address:
        (Programmers please specify the language you used!!)
