Hi everybody!

Unfortunately I¥m too short of time to develope more software (I study 
computer-science and have to be busy with JAVA and so on), so I decide on to 
release the sourcecode of my programs.

Specially for my last release GALAGA WARS I¥ve get many response, so I think
there could be people outside want to develope that game.

My programs are all freeware, so you can do what you want with it. But it¥ll
be great, if you inform me about, when you want to use the code.
And it¥ll be the greatest, if you mention me in your software.

All programs are written in BLITZ BASIC II. The code is a little bit lame.
I¥m sure that you can make it better, now you have the chance.

Unfortunately I¥ve only used a small number of comments, but after taking 
some time the code cann¥t be as hard as it seems.

By the way all programs need an assign. In the ready software the assign is
executed by a script which will be started by clicking on the start-icon.
If you want to work with the code, you will take the assign into your
user-startup.
Please pay attention to the tips in the instructions!

The source-codes of the following programs is available in the aminet
(I think you just have one of them, because you read this!):

-Galaga Wars (classic space-shooter)
-Nuclear Assault (a game like Missile Command)
-Mech-Konstruktor (program for designing Battlemechs)

If I have time, I¥ll program some new stuff in BLITZ BASIC.

But I also have to take care of my other hobbies.
I produce techno- and trance-music. On my homepages you find info and some
tracks ready for download:
