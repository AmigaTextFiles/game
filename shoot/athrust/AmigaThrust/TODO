X version.

* Fade the colors in and out.

* Take away the demand for a local colormap if it isn't absolutly
  necessary.

* Ports for other unices.
  HP-UX, Solaris, SunOS, OpenBSD, AIX, Ultrix, OSF1, Irix and Linux are known
  to work.

* Support for non 8 bpp pseudocolor visuals.


MSDOG version.

* Sound.

* Keyboard driver can not tell left and right control apart. Strange.

* Maybe a utility to configure libvga.cfg; MSDOG users will probably not read
  the documentation very carefully.


General

* Should not require GNU make.

* Music.

* The blinking of the stars.

* Rewrite of the scrolling routines (Needed, but how?).

* Steering with joystick.

* Documentation of the code.
