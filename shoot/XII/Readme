A very old game. Its been laying around on my hard drive for years so
I thought I might as well stick it on AMINET.

It can be quite enjoyable with a few players.
Supports 4 player joystick adapter.

It will seem VERY confusing at first so you'll need to get used to it.
Basically just shoot everyone. Computer controlled players ain't bad
either!

Take a look at my web page, theirs LOADS of better games on it!
