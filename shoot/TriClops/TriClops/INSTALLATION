There are basically two options for making a TriClops game disk from this
directory.

(1)	Make a bootable games disk by cloning a standard Workbench disk
	and then copying over the files via the commands:

		(insert workbench disk in df0 and blank disk in df1)
		1> df0:c/diskcopy df0: to df1:
		1> df0:c/rename df1: TriClops
		1> df0:c/copy AmigaLibDisk35:TriClops TriClops: all

	Then boot off the new games disk, clean up the icons as desired
	with "snapshot" in the menu, and you can now run with a single
	disk.

(2)	Make a TriClops only disk (equivalent to what I received from
	Geodesic Publications) via the commands:

		(insert workbench disk in df0: and new blank disk in df1)
		1> df0:c/format drive df1: name TriClops
		2> df0:c/copy AmigaLibDisk35:TriClops TriClops: all

Have fun and enjoy.
