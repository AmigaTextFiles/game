   When the mouse pointer is below the menu bar,  both of its
buttons are used by the game.  To drag,  simply hold down one
or both buttons and move the mouse.  Say, you wish to go into
outer space, move the mouse pointer down to the bottom of the
screen, then hold down the select button and drag mouse up to
the top of screen,    release button and repeat this action a
few times,    as you watch the triangle on the right move up.
The choice of drag controls was  made  carefully  to make the 
ship easy to maneuver.  Experiment.

   Clicking will work only if the mouse  is  motionless.  The 
Stop  control,  mUC2,  can  be  very  handy  when  used  with
velocity and steering, mUD.   Repeated menu clicks makes life
easy when trying to hit the Triclops' feet.  If you get lost,
just pop up the world map, mCD.
