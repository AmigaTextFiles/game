                   INTERESTING THINGS TO DO

First de-activate the Vehcile- Walker check mark.

1.   Go to different parts of the globe and view  at  various
fractal levels. High fractalization levels can be interesting
very close to the planet. At level one you see real vertexes.

2.   At an altitude just above mountain tops, drag mUDY until
pitch is high, hi velocity. Get a world view and then a front
view, watch the jet loop  back into view after a few seconds.    

3.  Get near the city; jump into space mDUY;  point and fire,
mUC4;   turn off fire lock, mDC4;  pull pilot box all the way
down, you should see the space hull.  Now drive right through
the satellite mUDY;   stop mUC2, turn around mUDX, View, mCU.
You should see the orbiting Space Hull with Earth in back.

4.  Explore the  Space Hull.

5.  From space, fly into the planet, notice that when the jet
hits the atmosphere,   the instrumentation tick marks turn on
and the jet starts to orbit the globe.  Lower altitude, mDUY.  

6.  With jet at low altitude,  fly forwards, stop,  and turn.
Now fire at the screen, move back to find where the torpedos
blowup right at the screen.  Get another front view,  notice
the  different  torpedo  sprays  while  using mDDX ( Roll ).
The size of the circle spray is controlled by mDDY ( Slope).

7.   The trickiest for last !!!   The jet, when planet-side,
is laser gyroscope stablized.   However,  it is possible to 
balance it upside down! With the jet at low altitude, using
mDDX you can balance the jet upside down.   Once  balanced, 
the jet is stable to mUD and mDU maneuvers. If you move too
far though, the jet tips over, back to normal stability !!!
