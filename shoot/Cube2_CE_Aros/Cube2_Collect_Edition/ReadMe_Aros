http://sauerbraten.org/

....:Requirements:....

- At least 256 MB of RAM
- Video card with hardware 3D acceleration
- At least 256 MB of Video RAM on video card, 512 MB of Video RAM recommended (*)
- mesa.library V18 or later, get it from AROS nightly build or from
   http://download.aros3d.org/releases/mesa.library-V18.0.zip and copy to LIBS:
- latest arosc.library, get it from AROS nightly build or from
   http://download.aros3d.org/releases/arosc.library-20110702.zip and copy to LIBS:

(*) - 512 MB VRAM is needed when all effects are turned on and high quality
textures are beeing used.


....:Installation:....

This archive contains only the executable & docs. Game data needs to be downloaded
separately from:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/sauerbraten/files/sauerbraten/2013_01_04/sauerbraten_2013_02_03_collect_edition_linux.tar.bz2/download

After downloading, extract the content of archive into Cube 2 drawer. You should
end up with following directory structure:

+-Cube 2
+---data
+---packages


....:Preconfiguration:....

Double-click on the Cube 2 Preconfiguration icon. This will start a simple
preconfiguration utility in which you will be able to select what class of
video card do you have and what amount of VRAM do you have. Based on this
initial configuration will be created. You will be able to change the specific
configuration later in the game.

It is really important that you select the right amount of VRAM at this stage.
If you select more than you actually have, game will load high-quality
textures which will eat up all your VRAM and will most probably cause a crash.


....:Running:....

Double-click on the Cube 2 icon. Notice that the game needs a lot of stack, at least
5000000 is required else the game/sdl/aros crashes. If you wish to change the resolution select video options in the game.
Your settings will be saved.


....:Shaders/Fixed function:....

The game has two main rendering modes: OpenGL GLSL Shaders and OpenGL Fixed
Functions. The first mode will give much better visual quality effects, but
requires a more powerfull card to run. The mode is changes in Option->Gfx by
checking or unchecking []shaders option.

If you experience problems with rendering, you may try switching from shaders
mode (default) to fixed function mode.
