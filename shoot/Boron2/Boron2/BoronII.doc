	This game is AGA only in that it uses the faster 68020 processor.
I have only tested this game on a bog standard 1200.
ie.1200 with no fast-mem or accellarator board.

The game should work on all Amigas ,although at different speeds?

		******	A personnal request  ******
		
	Could someone send me information on the AGA hardware.

If anyone could send me a copy of Comrade J`s "How to code" document 
( Found in the lastest Amiga-guide ) I`d be very grateful.
