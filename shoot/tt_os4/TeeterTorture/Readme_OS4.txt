Taken from the website:

Teeter Torture is a simple shooting game (similar to "Space Invaders", "Galaga"
or "Galaxian"), but with a unique twist. Your cannon is sitting atop a teeter
totter. If it leans too far in either direction, a barrel of TNT explodes!

"Weight monsters" appear at the top of the screen, and randomly fall towards
the teeter totter. If they attach to it, they'll weigh it down, making it more
difficult to keep it balanced. (If they hit the cannon, it explodes and you
lose a life.)

Limitations:

° This is my first port, so there are many

It's an alpha release!

° No sound or music
° The "big" explosion when the TNT goes up is somewhat broken
  (not implemented?)
° Highscore list has ridiculous entry's, no chance to reach it and
° there is no life counter, so you can play forever (and never reach an
  highscore entry)
