This game is distributed under the terms of the GPL, I'll include a copy later.

There are 4 types of aliens, green, red, purple, and brown.  Destroy all of them.

There are 3 unique types of powerups right now, red is spread shots, purple is catalyst shots, and the other
3 (yellow, blue, and green) all clear the screen of enemies.  The two shot powerups are additive, meaning they can
both be active at the same time, if you manage to live long enough to get a purple and red powerup.

HOW TO PLAY:

You are only allowed to move sideways, use the right and left arrow keys for that.  Space fires.  Holding the fire
button let's you charge your projectile distruptor, when it's fully charged hit the left ctrl button to clear the 
screen of all shots (your's and theirs).
