 While we're all waiting for someone to buy the remaining assets of
Commodore, I thought I'd create a little entertainment.  With my
superb programming talents, I've created a game so awesome that DooM
lovers will sure to be envious for years to come, because quite
frankly there isn't enough of a PC market to warrant a port of this
product! :-)

Hey you!  What *is* this thing, anyway?

 "The Game" is a fairly elaborate Shoot 'Em Up Construction Kit
(SEUCK) game where the object of "The Game" is to earn 100,000
points so that Commodore-Amiga will not become bankrupt.  "The Game"
has a timeline theme to it in that it follows the various versions
of the Amiga's OS along with timely attacks from the various
competition.  You begin your mission in 1985 as a "Boing! ball" (for
player 1), or in two-player mode you have the Amiga "Check mark" to
help (for player 2).  Also, just like a cat, you get 9 lives for
which to bounce though life.  Your weapon is the original Workbench
mouse pointer (played with the fire-button on a joystick, though),
and you have various targets to shoot at.  Some of the targets
include PC Lemmings, Amiga fanatics, Atari Fugi symbols shooting MIDI
ports at you, Apples shooting unhappy Macs, Big Blue shooting those
"warning labels" and various game disks shooting copyright symbols at
you.  Yep; a whole lotta symbolism in this puppy!  Watch out for
"Guru Meditation" bonus rounds (or is this game really that buggy? :-)
And no parody would be complete without our two infamous C= executive
d00dz!

Hey you!  Where do I insert the quarter?

First, this game requires the following files and directories
from Workbench:
 C/IconX (to run both the introduction and game)
 L/Disk-Validator
 Libs/icon.library
 Libs/mathtrans.library (to run the introduction)

 Also, "The Game" has an introduction animation that will require at
least 1 meg of memory to run, but the actual SEUCK game itself only
requires 512K of memory.  "The Game" has been tested under both
Kickstart 1.3 and 2.04, and under a 68000 with 1 meg of RAM, 3 megs
and a 68EC030/68882 with 7 megs of RAM.

 Copy "The_Game" drawer and its contents to your harddrive or floppy.
There are two ways to run "The Game": Click open the drawer and
either click on "The_Game-start_WB" to run both the introduction
animation and game, or click on "TheGame" to go directly into the
SEUCK game itself.  If you have the RAM, I recommend running
"The_Game_start_WB" at least once just to view the dorky
Moviesetter intro animation which then loads the actual game.  But
if you just want to quickly go into "The Game" and ingnore all that
work I did for the introduction, then sure; go ahead.  Fine with me!
:-)

Hey you!  Now what?

 For a one-player game, make sure you have a joystick plugged into
port 1.  For a two-player game, unplug the mouse from port 2 and
have another joystick plugged into there.  (Note: best to plug things
in only when the computer if turned off.)

 To start "The Game" simply press the fire-button (on joystick 1 for
a one-player game or joystick 1 and joystick 2 for a two-player
game).  To get things rolling... err, bouncing... push up on the
joystick.  Later sections of "The Game," will auto-scroll th display.
Move player right or left to evade bullets and aim at enemies, and
pess fire to shoot.

 While in "The Game" and under one-player mode (you still have the
mouse plugged in), you can pause "The Game" by pressing the
fire-button on the joystick while holding down on the right mouse
button.  To go back to the title screen and start over again, press
both right and left mouse buttons at the same time.  Once you're back
at the title screen, you can either press fire to play the game again
or click the mouse pointer on the upper left corner of the title
screen to exit "The Game" and return to Workbench.  Nice features,
eh?  My fantasic programming talent really shows here!  Well, okay,
so all programming credit does belong to Palace Software and Accolade
for SEUCK.  Cool game idea, though. :-)

Hey you!  Where's all that legal stuff found in most documentation?
