       but the code is mine AHAHAHHA mine do you hear!!!????
          Shareware I think this is called...... (If you like this and
          use it alot then you must be very strange indeed! If you
          want to send me money to bribe me into writing more of this 
          stuff then by all means send some. But ya dont have to.)


    Geekshoot I.
    ------------

       The aim of the game is to shoot the geeks as they wander about.
       It is utterly pointless and possibly evil but I like it!

       Controls: F1 - F10 restart game with 10 - 100 geeks.
                 by pressing shift at the same time doubles this and
                 ctrl triples this.

                 Esc exits.

    Geekshoot II.
    -------------

       Remarkably similair plot to Geekshoot I......

       Controls: F1- F10 blah blah blah.....

               For the mouse: putting the pointer at the edges of the
               screen will scroll the area about. Pressing the right mouse
               button will recentre the screen at that point.

              Pressing space will drop cows on their heads...... YES, COWS!

              Esc exits and Help brings up a brief list of stuff....

    LotteryGeeks.
    -------------

        Novel one this. Same as geekshoot II but when you shoot them a little
        angel goes up holding a number..!!!! Nice isn`t it. The numbers go 
        from 1-49 for the National Lottery or 1-58 for that new Quick-pix 
        thing. Press Help why don`t you.
