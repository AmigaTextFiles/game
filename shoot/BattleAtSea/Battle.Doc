Battle at Sea is a freely distributable naval battle simulation. It was   
written using AMOS Professional and should run on every Amiga with at     
least 1 meg of RAM. It is a two-player tactical wargame featuring a map   
with more than 6000 fields to explore, minelayers, fuel-dumps and differ- 
ent ship-types to be equipped with various cargo. It is Giftware.         
                                                                          
-What is Giftware?                                                        
Giftware means you can spread and use this software freely. If you like it
you should show your appreciation by sending me a gift of your choice. The
value of your gift is to be set all by yourself. And of course the gift   
itself should be chosen by you. It can be anything, for example self-made 
programs, heavy metal CDs, good books, PAL-videos or money.               
If you accept the Giftware-conditions and register, I will in return send 
you the newest version of the program including configuration features for
the ship-types as well as a map-editor and a real manual.                 
However there is no compulsion to register. If you like the program, feel 
free to use it. Suggestions for future updates are always welcome anyway. 
                                                                          
-What is the game about?                                                  
The action takes place in a combat area far, far away where two human com-
petitors battle for power, might, wealth, young maidens etc. What I wanted
to say is that the battle in this game has nothing to do with any real    
conflict anywhere in the world.                                           
The two human fleet commanders try to conquer fortresses which serve main-
ly as production sites for new vessels or the vessels' equipment. The aim 
of the game is naturally the obliteration of all enemy forces. Besides the
fortresses and vessels fighting each other there are also fuel-dumps scat-
tered around the battlefield to allow the vessels unlimited readiness for 
action. Some of the vessels can lay mines to destroy the enemy ships' hull
or at least damage it. Minesweepers however are aboard every of the six   
ship-types and in the fortresses to prevent damage from lurking mines.    
Apart from fighting enemy ships and conquering fortresses both players    
also need to explore the battle-area which is unknown to them in the be-  
ginning. Four types of engines and three types of weapons as well as mines
and shield generators characterize every unique vessel roaming around the 
battlezone. Of course cargo can be exchanged between friendly vessels and 
damaged vessels slowly repair themselves if they do not quick-regain with-
in the walls of a fortress.                                               
                                                                          
-Course of the game                                                       
The "intro"-pictures can be skipped by pressing the right mousebutton when
the first picture appears so that the title page comes to the front.      
At the title page you may either load an old game or begin a new one. If  
you start a new one you are to enter the names of both players, the dura- 
tion messages will remain on screen and the number of fortresses that must
be conquered by both players. The game ends, if a player hasn't got a for-
tress anymore.                                                            
The game is organized in phases. Every unit takes its turn once in a phase
and fortresses' productions are completed within a certain amount of pha- 
ses. Every unit also regains its hull by one point a phase. Both vessels  
and fortresses can send and receive cargo to/from friendly units in the   
direct vicinity. The main differences between vessels and fortresses are  
that fortresses cannot move, active shield generators do not cost any fuel
for fortresses, statistics can only be viewed by a fortress and vessels   
have the ability to sink themselves in order to prevent the enmey from    
scoring for sinking your ship.                                            
Why active shield generators? Every unit can attack an enemy unit once a  
phase. During an attack all weapons installed in a gun-base fire at the   
enemy unit. There are two types of machine guns and a more powerful rock- 
et launcher. To protect a unit from a rocket attack it can place a shield 
generator in at least one of the gun-bases. There is a 75% chance for the 
shield generator to destroy the intruding rocket. However a shield genera-
tor installed in a ship costs some extra fuel. This also goes for the mine
sweepers. If a vessel runs into a mine, the hull will be damaged. If a    
ship has less than 20% of her maximum hull, she sinks. If a ship hasn't   
got any fuel left, she can only move one field a phase. If she loses her  
engine, she can still move one field. If she has more than one engine in  
the hold, the best one is used automatically. Her speed depends not only  
on her engine, but also on the ship-type and the weight of the cargo and  
of the fuel.                                                              
To prevent the game from being boring when controlling fortresses that    
produce ships and have nothing else to do fortresses can be sent into a so
called "sleep-mode". They then build their ships without having to come to
the front each phase. They awake automatically if under attack or having  
finished the production or if an enemy draws too near. Arrow up symbolizes
an active fortress, arrow down a sleeping one.                            
                                                                          
-Controlling the game:                                                    
All kinds of buttons are controlled by clicking the left mousebutton. Edit
zones for entering names etc. are to be used via the keyboard. The left   
Amiga-key in conjunction with the 'A' forces the workbench screen to the  
front where you can perform Dos-operations etc. When inside the graphic   
window in order to move a vessel, sweep for mines, select information and 
so on (when your mouse pointer is held inside this window) you can cancel 
your current task by pressing the right mousebutton. Clicking on the but- 
ton in the top left corner exits the game.                                
                                                                          
                                                                          
                                                                          
Well, this was just a brief documentation not covering all aspects of the 
game. Just discover what I left out here by yourself, this should not be  
too hard.                                                                 
                                                                          
P.S:

I do not have access to the Aminet. I wanted to contact you, but I could  
not find your adress in your modules. So please write me, because I want  
you to receive your share for creating these jolly good AND short modules.
