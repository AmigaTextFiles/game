Short:      ADescent source code

Type:       game/shoot


This is the latest ADescent source code. With the recent release of the
Descent 2 sources, I thought it would be a good time to release the source
of our Descent port, too. As we currently can't port Descent 2 ourselves,
this source code could be of use to anybody porting Descent 2 to the Amiga.
You are welcome to take any part of this source code for portin Descent 2.
For everyone else, remember that the source code is copyrighted, but you are
free to use any source that was written by us, not Parallax. If in doubt, just ask.
