     Welcome to STATOSCURO!

     You have in your hands the result of a year of work.This has
     to be one of the biggest PD projects ever;the idea was to get as
     many people as possible involved,thus creating a real community game.
     As it stands,4 guys from Uruguay,3 from England and 1 from Hungary
     helped in making this game come true.

     The process of making the game can be defined in two words:great fun!
     There was no pressure of any kind,that's why the game took so long
     to be finished.One of us would have an idea,share it with the rest,
     and then we'd work on it until it took shape.We were able to
     contribute to each other's stuff in a very deep way..Without the
     encouragement and enthusiasm of the other team members,the game would
     not be as good as it is now.When I finished assembling a level,it
     was the others who looked proud.When Jason or Kris did a great
     rendered pic,it was the rest who got the kick.It's hard to explain,
     but in a word,friendship says it.
     
     We are not perfectionists,we are idealists.With this we mean that in
     our opinion games are important,because we believe that they are more
     than "games for kids".We think that in this crazy world we live in,
     computer games let you forget your problems for a while,and at the
     same time to sort of dance over them.

     We hope you enjoy this game as much as we enjoyed creating it!


     "Do your best,then leave the results to me and don't worry-be happy"

     1-Photon

       It is the weapon you start with.It's the Trolin's stormtroopers'
       standard weapon.In typical shoot'em-up fashion it's neither bad nor
       amazing.

       RANGE: medium
       POWER: medium
       RELOAD TIME:medium

     2-Blastar

       The Blastar is an improved version of the Photon.It is slightly
       more powerful,it is a bit faster between shoots and it has some
       more range.

       RANGE:medium-long
       POWER:medium-high
       RELOAD TIME:medium-low

     3-Plasma

       A fast and flexible weapon.Slightly less powerful than the Blastar,
       it evens up with it's fast reload rate.

       RANGE:medium-long
       POWER:medium
       RELOAD TIME:low

     4-Lazer Beam

       A powerful weapon,it's only drawbacks being the high reload time and
       short range.

       RANGE:short
       POWER:high
       RELOAD TIME:high

     5-Rockets

       The most powerful weapon in the game.Great to teach that bugger that
       has pestered you for ages a proper lesson,or to impress girls with.
       It's usually very well hidden,too ; )

       RANGE:medium-long
       POWER:very high
       RELOAD TIME:hig

     This game is an overhead shooter,a la Chaos Engine or Wasted Dreams.
     Use a joystick in port 2 to move your character around,and the fire
     button to,erm,fire your weapon.
     At any time press ESC to lose a life,P to pause/unpause and CTRL + C
     to quit and return to WB.You can also control the Cyborg with the
     cursor keys,and shoot with right shift.
     You can save a screen shot to RAM if you press "Ctrl" whilst playing.

     At the start of each mission,you will be told what you are supposed
     to do.Read the text carefully,unless you fancy wandering around the
     landscape without having an idea of what you have to do to complete
     the level.

     Now,something that you must understand is that secret items are a very
     important part of the game.You might make it to the end without them
     but it would be tons easier having found those extra lives and big
     bog off weapons.

     The secrets items will appear when you walk past certain areas.Keep
     an eye open all the time for those apparently pointless dead ends!

     At the end of the second planet,you will be told how to start the game
     at the third planet!

     If you want to review the game,please feel free to ask for the trained
     version,which is also available to anyone who contacts us!

     Statoscuro has been tested on the following machines:

     Amiga 1200/020 10 MB Ram:

     It works OK.Smooth running when nothing else is.

     Amiga 1200/030 16 MB Ram:

     This is the recommended setting.

     Amiga 1200 with Apollo 1260/50 and 32 MB Ram:

     Works wonders :)

     It does work on A1200 2Mb Ram (the standard one,y'know).But I think
     that sooner or later you'll get an "out of memory" window!!And at any
     rate,in such a machine,the game is usually slow-paced,and there are
     places where it really crawls along!

     The recommended setting is A1200 with a 030 board and 8 MB ram.

     In theory,it should work on any amiga as long as you have enough memory
     and a HD,but we think that on a 500 or 600 it will barely run.

                             @{b}@{u} KNOWN BUGS @{ub}@{uu}

       Backbone is a great program,but it is not really suited for
       such a big project.The game is incredibly chip-memory hungry.
       The game is very likely to lock if you have been doing things
       beforehand.For the best performance,it is strongly advised that
       you reset your machine before playing.Sorry about this-we didn't
       create Backbone,you know.
       It's almost impossible to complete the game in one sitting.We advise
       you to play the first two planets in order to get the code,and then
       reboot and use the code to start on the third and final planet.

       Even though the game multitasks,and returns to WB (by pressing
       CTRL+C),you are strongly adviced to play it without running any
       background programs (I.E. booting without startup-sequence and
       executing it from here).

       1-The most powerful weapon in the game,the rockets,are always hidden.
         They are hidden in one level only for each planet.If you can find
         them,life will be much easier for you.

       2-Unless you have the rockets,it is not a very bright idea to take
         on more than one enemy at the time.

       3-If you don't have to kill all enemy,it's pointless to stop and
         fight with them.Remember,just concentrate on your mission!

       4-As I always say,it does not pay to be fancy.

     Just unpack or copy the game where you want it to be.No

     assigns required,and Statoscuro does not scatter rubbish all

    "First of all,I wanna thank my family,especially my older brother
    (Higinio) who tested the game and was really helpful.

    I want to say hello to all our AMIGA community here in
    Uruguay,particularly Maxi & Aldo.

    A big hug goes out to Steve Eaborn for his contribution to the last
    world of the game ; )

    There are no words to describe how thankful I feel towards the other
    team members.I am deeply indebted.

    Golden regards to all the great Aminet authors!

    Very special thanks to Mark Dowling for his cool game "The Power Of The
    Ginger",and for help in playtesting Statoscuro.
 
    Mega-thanks go out to Alastair Murray,for making this possible.

    Inspirational thanks go to:

                     * My brother Higinio for suggesting the name of
                       the game,and the name of the first planet.

                     * UFO:Enemy unknown (just have a look at the second
                       planet!)

    Big thanks to my favourite bands:Oasis and The Who for their incredible
    music! "

    "Thanks go to Emilio for letting me be part of his team.It has been
     great working with the person responsible for Charly The Merc,possibly
     one of the most addictive games I have played on my Amiga and I'm
     certain that his future games will be just as good ;) "

    Emilio Perez:"Programmer",Level Design,Music Selection,additional
                 2D graphics and sampled speech.

                 Emilio is the original member of On The Dole Softare.He
                 promised the others large amounts of money,fame,and
                 attaining the status of sex symbols,and thus managed to
                 con them into making Statoscuro.When they discovered the
                 truth,it was too late ; )

                 Emilio is 21 and lives in Montevideo,the capital of
                 Uruguay.For some reason that scientists are trying to
                 elucidate,Emilio is mad about all things British.That
                 ranges from the Amiga to books by Joseph Conrad,English
                 Football (he supports Newcastle United),Amiga magazines and
                 music bands like The Who,The Jam and Oasis.

    Jason Faramus:3D and 2D artist.Creator of the Cyborg character.Console
                  screen.Game over screen.All the screens that show the
                  Cyborg were rendered by Jason.

                  Jason comes from England and is 21 years old.He was the
                  second member to join the gang.Emilio asked him if he
                  could draw the graphic for the main character,and Jason
                  said "Sure!".He then worked for an entire week (!) and
                  rendered (!!) 128 frames (!!!) of an incredible-looking
                  character.Without a doubt,Jason is the dad of Statoscuro,
                  and the most commited member of the team.
                  We love you,man ;)

                  Jason is currently looking for a job in the graphics
                  industry.As you will notice from playing this game,his
                  talents are incredible.Nothing seems to be difficult for
                  him.

    Kristof Csendes:3D graphic artist.Intro screens.Creator of the Cyborg's
                    ship,as shown during the credits and at the beginning
                    of Planet Rastrillo.Creator of all the planet's
                    introduction screens.

                    Kristof (nicknamed "Kris") was the first member to
                    join the team.He worked as a playtester for Emilio's
                    "Death Is On The Way" game.He's 21 years old.
                    He is from Hungary,but since 1992,Kris lives in
                    Germany,near the French border.When he is not passing
                    out after heavy all-night drinking sessions or chasing
                    skirts,he studies Geography at Mainz University and
                    loves to render 3D pictures.
                    He can also speak 4 languages:Hungarian and German near
                    perfect,and a bit of English and French.
                    His hobbies are soccer (he supports Bayern Munich),
                    friends,car racing,beer drinking and of course the
                    Miggy!
                    If Jason is the dad of Statoscuro,then Kris is the
                    uncle ; )
 
    Kym Eden-Jones:Additional 2D graphics.Helped with the end game text.

                   Kym is the youngest member of the team.He is just 16
                   years old.He comes from Dorset,England but currently
                   lives in the small town of Gillingham.He is now doing
                   his final year of school,after which he will go to
                   college to study Biology,Electronics and computer
                   programming.
                   He likes rock music,mainly John Cale and The Stranglers,
                   and old stuff like that.Most importantly,he is a really
                   big Amiga fan,whose energy and determination proved
                   vital in seeing Statoscuro coming true.

    Maximiliano Davyt:"On The Dole Software" logo

                      Maxi is one of Emilio's best friends.He is 20
                      years old,and owns a CDTV.Like Emilio,he is from
                      Uruguay.He lives in the small country city of
                      Colonia Valdense.He is a terrific 3D artist.

    Gerardo Olivera:Controls screen and End Game screen number one.

                    31-years-old Gerardo is also from Montevideo,Uruguay.
                    He is a terrific 2D artist,as you will see for yourself.

    Higinio Perez:Lead playtester and responsible for the title of the
                  game.

                 Higinio is Emilio's older brother,and besides being the
                 lead playtester,he inspired Emilio to name the game
                 "Statoscuro",with something he said during a game of
                 Deluxe Galaga.If you would like to know what "Statoscuro"
                 means,then e-mail Emilio ; )

    Aldo Bianchi:Additional music selection,help with the speech samples.

                 Aldo is 27 years old,and like Gerardo and Emilio lives in
                 Montevideo,Uruguay.His support and comments were vital in
                 seeing Statoscuro being completed.

    So,if you think that you can do something good,then please don't

    hesitate to send me a sample of your work.You don't have to be able

    to do amazing things-I just want people who are "mad for it",and are

    prepared to work their bollocks off!

    Statoscuro is @{fg highlight}giftware@{fg text}.That means that if you
    enjoy the game,you have to send the programmer a gift.
    An e-mail telling where you got the game from and what you think
    of it is considered a great gift : )
    However,if you really want to make the programmer weep,send him an
    Amiga magazine-old,new,a fanzine...whatever!That would be terrific.
    Money is also accepted,of course ; ) Just a 5U$S note would be very
    nice.
    I need the manuals for both "3D Construction Kit II" and for
    "Reality",the game maker.I've have had both programs for ages but I have
    no idea how to use them ("Reality"),or don't know how to do certain
    things,like compiling the game in 3D Kit II (I have a full game done
    with it,but don't know how to compile it!Grrr!).
