	INTREPID is an arcade/strategy game in which you must navigate a
high tech tank through the Antarctic to rescue a scientist taken hostage
by terrorists. Full instructions on your mission and gameplay are
available inside the game by pressing the "NO Questions" button.

	To load INTREPID simply double click on its icon or CD to the
Intrepid directory and type "PROJ2 INTREPID" from CLI. You must have the
"RUN" command in the C: directoy for INTREPID to run. Intrepid is very
happy running from a HD. Simply copy the entire directory, with
sub-directories intact, over to the HD. 

	This is the latest version of INTREPID as of 1/20/1992. Previous
versions had a bug in the retreat sequence. This, among other things, have
been fixed. 
	
	Information on registration and distribution policy are found
within the game by pressing the "NO QUESTIONS" button.

Some things to keep in mind:
	
	The INTREPID uses most of the 512k of chip ram. You can multitask
	but it might crash the game

	If you have over 512k of CHIP ram there are extra sound effects
        For some reason it won't play sounds out of fast RAM. The director
	eats the chip RAM and won't return it without a re-boot. Bug?

	The game contains timing routines that should affect an 
	accelerated AMIGA, but they are untested. If there is a problem
	let me know.

    This game was created because of my quest to make an arcade type
action game with the Director. Forgive such things as flashing blits, it
was unavoidable for the sake of speed. As you can see though, the Director
is quite powerful and is definitely more than an animation language. I hope
you enjoy the game. I would like to hear plenty of comments and hopefully
no bug reports. If response is good I plan to improve the graphics as well
as add missions, features, etc. Definitely worth a registration fee!
