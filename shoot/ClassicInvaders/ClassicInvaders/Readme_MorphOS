I (bitRocky) accidentally found this game in Grunch, but it couldn't load the sounds.
I tried to recompile the src (after installing "boost" sources), and found out that
some ogg files failed to load.
These are the sounds:
   zap_scores.ogg, wrong_key.ogg, small_bonus.ogg, shot_collision.ogg, shot.ogg, menu_select.ogg, alien_death.ogg

So I converted them to wave sounds and now it works!

Really nice game!

This is a recompile from HAKs version because some sounds failed to load.

old Readme from HAK:
This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@nakama.at).
