Short:  sdlquake 1.0.9
Author:  ID Software 
Uploader:  ikepgh@yahoo.com (IKE)
Type:  game/shoot
Requires:  Amiga 68k (060), Quake .PAK files 

This is a quick and dirty port of sdlquake for AmigaOS 68k.  I've looked around and it doesn't appear anyone has done a SDL port of Quake to Amiga, so I said, "why not?"  I am getting really good framerates on my 3Ghz WinUAE setup and it is quite playable (cpuspd reports an 040 running at ~460mhz on my machine).  

I have tested it on my A1200/060/CV3D and it runs, but quite simply it is unplayable.  Sorry folks.  I'd be very interested to here from you and get some feedback on how it plays, your setup, etc.  I hope someone finds this code useful to do an OS4 ppc port of sdlquake, since I don't currently have OS4.

------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

Just place your .PAK files in the ID1 folder.  They must be located in this folder for the program to find them and run.

------------------------------------------------------------

Running Quake:

You must set the Stack to a relatively high value prior to running quake.  I use a value of 500000 and it seems to work just fine.

Type this in a Shell:

Stack 500000
sdlquake

Note:  When I tested it on my real 060 Amiga it required networking to be running in order to launch.  I started Genesis and that was sufficient, I did not need to actually connect to the internet.  I didn't notice this on WinUAE while I was porting since networking is running in the background all the time on the Windows side.
------------------------------------------------------------

Not Tested (but compiled in):

CD Music Support 
Network Support/LAN games

I'd like some feedback on these if you test them.  Send To: ikepgh@yahoo.com

------------------------------------------------------------

Known Bugs:

1. It may be necessary to delete the config.cfg file out of the ID1 directory (once it's been created) if the program is not terminated properly.  As the program will hang while trying to find and load this file even though it is present. 

Any thoughts or help would be greatly appreciated!!!   Send To:  ikepgh@yahoo.com

Fixed Bugs:

- Music crashes on player game start, but works through the demo.  Fixed this by utilizing Peter McGavin's awinquake sourcecode, specifically, "snd_amiga.c", Thanks Peter!!
  
------------------------------------------------------------

How to recompile:

1. compile all the c sources in the src directory as object files with the -c option

gcc -c -O3 -m68060 *.c

2. build the binary and link to the required libraries

gcc *.o -O3 -m68060 -lSDL -ldebug -lpthread -lm -o sdlquake

Note:  for this build I used the new pthread 2.0 from:
