  you get 30. More points are scored for the smaller, faster submarines, then
  for the big, slow ones, and you also score more points the deeper in the water
  the sub you hit is.


This game was programmed with Blitz Basic 2.1, I drew the Graphics in DPaintIV and
composed the music with Protracker 3.1b.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My system is a 10Mb A1200 with a 500Mb HardDrive, still with the 68020 chip.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first ever BB2 game I've programmed. - what do you think ?
I used to use AMOS Pro - I got it off Amiga Format, and although it was
powerful, it lacked the speed of the Blitz Basic Compiler, as well as support
for Intuition, and the AGA chip set.
