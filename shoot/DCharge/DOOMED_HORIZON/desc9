Sometimes a program is released}
that is so invaluable to the user}
that you wonder how you survived}
without it! ModeSwitcher is such a}
program. It places 2 buttons at the}
bottom of the screen marked PAL &}
NTSC, and by clicking on them you can}
SWITCH the display MODE !}
Very useful for those games that}
don't change the display mode to }
PAL and the bottom is lost.}|
