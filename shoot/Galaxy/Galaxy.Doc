                ----------------------------------------

                  A BRIGHT SPARK SOFTWARE PRODUCTION

                      Written By David Christian
Gameplay :
----------
Destroy as many of the invading aliens as possible. Get as high a score
as you can and have fun !!!!
"What gameplay !!!" I hear you cry ! Well, yes - it is simplistic but
I only put it out in the public domain because Blitz2 can be tricky to
learn so I thought beginners could use it. As I have been coding in
AMOS for so long Blitz2 blew me away with the speed and power of it all.
Now I can write games I could only dream about writing in AMOS !!!!

Information :
-------------
This little game is FREEWARE. That means that you can spread it around
as much as you want just as long as you leave this DOC file as it is.
This game is my first 'go' at a game in BLITZ BASIC 2 (Version 2.1) and
while it is not super quality, I think it is playable in a silly sort
of way. Experienced Blitz coders will probably laugh at the source
but I don't care - I have bad habits from AMOS (I used AMOS till XMAS 95
you know !!!).

Hard drive instalation :
------------------------
1) Make a new directory on your hard disk
2) Copy the GALAXY_BLITZ_96 File accross into the new directory.
3) Copy DATA directory to new directory (must be in same dir. as
   the GALAXY_BLITZ_96 file)
4) If you do not have the '2001' font installed in FONTS/ :-
   (I)   - Copy the '2001.font' file to your FONTS/ directory
   (II)  - Copy the '2001' directory to the FONTS/ directory
5) Thats it !!! Follow above instructions carefully for the game
   to run properly.

Notes :
-------
The source code uses BLITZ 2.1 and uses the new display libraries so
if you only have version 2 then convert the DISPLAY commands to slice
commands. (More notes on that subject in the sorce code !!!)
