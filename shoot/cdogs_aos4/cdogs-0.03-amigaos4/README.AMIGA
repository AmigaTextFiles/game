C-Dogs Amiga SDL Port v0.03
---------------------------
   (based on C-Dogs 1.06)


Ported to AmigaOS 4.0 by Spot / Up Rough.

Fullscreen mode doesn't work for now, atleast
not on my monitor, please let me know if it
works for you.

Amiga Input not tested as i never got it to
work properly on my machine.

This game is still in development and all
features aren't there yet, but it's very
playable. So, have a blast!
