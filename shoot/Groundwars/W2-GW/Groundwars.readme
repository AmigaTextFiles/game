Version : 1.0

This is the beta-version of a vertical scrolling shoot'em up from
NC.Gamez of Sweden. It's very playable on any AGA Amiga, but it's
designed on & for 030 processor. Play this version, and then send
me  an e-mail  with your opinion!  Should I crawl  back under the
rock from where I came, or continue develop this game?
