-»» WHAT IS THIS? ««--------------------------------------------------------

A fan made side scroller shooter made by Mikael Persson (know as Hipoonios)
using Backbone in just three weeks! So don't expect too  much of it!

I used to watch the animated TV show SuperTed all the time as a kid. I loved
it (and still do).I remember I was really disappointed there where no game
for the Amiga. Commodore 64 and Spectrum had one. Why not the Amiga?! That
is why I decided to create this awesome piece of quality software (ha ha).

This is actually my first game I'm releasing. I made some small games in
AMOS when I was younger, but did never release anything.

So I'm really happy to finally release something (even if it sucks). And
hopefully I will do more games in the future (send feedback to make me
motivated!).

This game was planned to be released sometime in the beginning of 2015, but
got finished a bit quickier than I thought, so releasing it earlier. That's
why it says 2015 in the intro sequence.

If you have played many Amiga games before then you will recognize much of
the graphics I have used in this game (see credits section below).

I guess I could do a much better game than this, by spending more time on
it. Also there are some limitations in Backbone so I could not do everything
I wanted to do. Also I wanted my first game to fit on one bootable disk, so
didn't use too much graphics and music.


-»» SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ««--------------------------------------------------

It should run on all Amigas with at least 2 MB of RAM. A 68030 processor or
better is strongly recommended. Yep, even simple games like this requires a
fast Amiga because of Backbone.


-»» CREDITS ««--------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the graphics, sound and music in this game is not made by me. I have
used graphics and music from various games. Just to mention a few, Lemmings,
Zool, James Pond II, Baby Jo and Kid Gloves II.

The cutscenes are images ripped from the real animation and converted to 32
colors. Some looks bad, sorry for that. The source I had was not the best.

-»» THE AIM OF THE GAME ««--------------------------------------------------

Find Texas Pete and his spaceship and kick his butt. He has kidnapped your
friend Spotty and his family. There are five levels in the game.


-»» HD INSTALL ««-----------------------------------------------------------

The game boot from floppy. but you can easily install it on your harddrive.
Just copy all files from disk to a directory and the libraries to libs:.

That's it!


-»» TIPS ««-----------------------------------------------------------------

Eat candy! Some gives you energy and more powerful weapons.

There is a boss at the end of each level. The bosses in this game is super
easy to kill, because I could not do better boss-fight. 

When you meet a boss, stay in the left corner and shoot him rapidly till he
dies.

Do not touch anything! Most things in this game kills you. If you touch the
nails = you lose a full life.


-»» CONTROLS ««-------------------------------------------------------------

I recommend Joystick a Joypad for best control. But you can also use cursor
keys and use right shift key to fire.

Other keys:

P = Paus the game.
ESC = Kill yourself.
CTRL+C = Quit the game/back to Workbench.


-»» BUGS ««-----------------------------------------------------------------

Are there any bugs? Yep, there is a few. But nothing worth to mention. All
bugs are related to Backbone anyway. So nothing I can do to fix them.


-»» GREETINGS ««------------------------------------------------------------

To all Amiga fans out there!


-»» FINAL WORDS ««----------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy the game!

Amiga forever!
