Virus Killer

Version 0.1

LICENSE

	GNU GPL - Please read LICENSE for more information


INSTALLATION

	The game should be built using the makefile included. SDL, SDL Mixer, SDL
Image, SDL TTF and ZZIP Lib are
	all required in order to build and play the game. Once the game is built
you must install it using the
	make install command to move all the data and binaries to the correct
locations. The default install
	path for binaries and data is /usr/games and
/usr/share/games/parallelrealities respectively.


PLAYING

	Please see manual.html for game instructions. This is installed to
/usr/share/doc/viruskiller-0.1 by
	default.
	
	
FEEDBACK

	If you have any trouble getting this game to build or run please drop me a
line with a description of
	the problem so I can fix it. I like to make sure these things can be made
to work with minimal effort. 
	Should you have all the required libraries and headers it should be just a
case of make, make install.
