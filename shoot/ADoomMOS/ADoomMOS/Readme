ADoomMOS V0.1
-------------------------

ADoomMOS is a simple port of ADoom for MorphOS with minor changes:

- Automagic bus speed detection
- Automagic screenmode selection
- No doomsound.library needed (using AHI Library)
- Sound is "clipping"
- No more music :-(

This port is really unfinsh and would need some work on the sound/music 
part, but as it's usable, some people may enjoy it

See original readme for more details.

Enjoy
