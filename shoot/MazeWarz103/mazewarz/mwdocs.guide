@Node "intro"

@{u}@{b}Introduction@{uu}@{ub}
    Welcome to @{b}SySiS@{ub}' second release:  @{i}MazeWarz@{ui} 1993.  This multiplayer action
game  is loosely based on an ancient newtworkable game that originated sometime
in  the  1970's.   The  game  has  been  ported  to  many different formats and
computers since then.  From 1 to 8 players move droids around a maze armed with
a single missile shooter and his/her wits.  This is a game with no beginning or
end:  it is a continuous battle for supremacy...
    To understand  @{i}MazeWarz@{ui} requires experience, so read @{" Controls " Link "controls"} and have a
quick go now, so I don't have to bore you with a long concept description.

@{u}@{b}Features@{uu}@{ub}
    Those  who  are familiar with the basic game will need little introduction,
however there are some important omissions and additions that should be noted.

*  From 1 to 4 players can compete on each computer. Using a serial link (modem
or direct connection), a maximum of 8 players can be accommocated.

*  The  computer  can be made to control up to 8 unused droids.  The computer's
reaction time is adjustable.

*  Two mazes are selected and played simultaneously.  A new set of mazes may be
selected at any time during the game.

*  There are about 16 mazes to choose from, and a converter program is included
to allow you to design your own.

*  Each player has a "Haven" in which special abilities may be bought with cash
gained  from  shooting  other  players.  In addition, the player cannot be shot
while in Haven.

@Node "note"
@{u}@{b}Programming Note@{uu}@{ub}

    This  game  was  written in AMOS.  The converter was written in C.  I chose
AMOS  because  I  found system programming under C too time consuming and error
prone.   Moving  a  few  8  by 8 bobs around the screen hardly seemed worth the
pages  of  startup code required.  In addition some of what I wanted to achieve
would  have  been  very tricky using C (eg.  double buffered screens), and only
really  easy  to  write using assembler.  Since I have very little knowledge of
68000 assembly programming, and have no real interest in starting now, those of
you  who  despise  AMOS  and  other  "lamer" HLL's will have to wait until more
people  get an AGA machine and 3.0 docs to see any system friendly games of any
quality, in the public domain, or elsewhere for that matter.

    Also,  sorry to anyone who takes offence over the nonexistant annoying AMOS
messages in the game.  All due 'credit' goes to the excellent language, even if
I  am  now  moving  to  Blitz  Basic II.  Sorry guys, but come back when you're
system friendly...

@Node "install"
@{u}@{b}Installation@{uu}@{ub}
    To  play  @{i}MazeWarz@{ui}  you  will  need  to  boot  your  computer  with a fully
functioning  Workbench  disk,  or hard disk, and at least two mazes in a drawer
called  "mazes".   The  maze  drawer  must  be located in the same directory as
@{i}MazeWarz@{ui}.  Just  double  click on the @{i}MazeWarz@{ui} icon to play.  The program  will
decrunch and you will be presented with the Maze Selection screen.
    You must have full Workbench libs, l and devs directories on your boot disk
for  @{i}MazeWarz@{ui} to run, especially the serial.device in the devs directory.  
@{i}MazeWarz@{ui} will abort if these files are unavailable.
    @{i}MazeWarz@{ui} works on any OS 2.0 Amiga with at least 1MB of memory. It may also
work  on  a  512k machine but I haven't tried it because there is no excuse for
having  such  a small amount of memory:  if you can afford a $500 computer, you
can  afford  a  $50  upgrade to double its memory.  This goes for the operating
system as well.
    Unfortunately,  (and  I  apologise  for  this), I cannot guarantee that the
program  works  for  A1200's or A4000's, although it has been briefly run on an
A1200  and found to be ok.  Serial connections under 3.0 (whatever the machine,
are  a little suspect...but this may just be the phases of the moon...you never
know with AMOS.)
    This is a PAL only game. NTSC lamers go away....

@Node "mazesel"
@{u}@{b}Maze Selection@{ub}@{uu}
    Using  left/right  and  fire,  move  the  pointer  to select either mazes 1
through  6  or  any  other  maze  using  the question mark box.  Only the right
keyboard and joy-port joystick are activated during Maze Selection.  The cursor
keys are also enabled for maze selection.
    Select two different mazes, and the game begins.

@{" Controls " Link "controls"}
@EndNode

@Node "controls"
@{u}@{b}Controls@{uu}@{ub}
    After the program has loaded, you must @{" Select Mazes " Link "mazesel"}.
    When the mazes appear, the game has begun.  Each player must be entered and
his/her  name typed in.  The following table shows the key required to activate
each  player  (ST),  the  key to terminate player (TER), and the device used to
control droid:

@{u}ST  TER CONTROL             KEYS@{uu} (if applicable)

F1  F5  Keypad (rt key)     4=left, 6=right, 8=forward, 5=back, 0 or ENTER=fire
F2  F6  Joy in Joystick port
F3  F7  Left Keyboard       A=left, D=right, W=forward, S=back, SPC or ALT=fire 
F4  F8  Joy in mouse port

    A600 users (no keypad) should remap the keys as shown below.
    The  keyboard  fire  buttons  are  arranged to be friendly to both left and
right  handed  people.   In addition, it is useful to have to ability to change
hands during play, as it can be quite gruelling.
    The  joystick  movement  is absolute, and the keyboard's is relative.  This
means  that  pushing  left  on the joystick will make your droid face left, and
then move to the left. On the keyboard, you are only able to turn left relative
to  your  current  heading.   This  gives the joystick the advantage of quickly
changing direction, as about faces are possible.  However the keyboard controls
give  a better flow through tight areas of the maze.  Thus the keyboard and the
joystick are roughly balanced in their ability.

@{b}Other Keys@{ub}
    Press  HELP  to  reach  the  two help screens, the second of which lets you
alter  a  few  of the game's parameters and other functions.  An explanation of
these keys follows:

    S:   "Slug's  Keys".   One  of  the beta testers of this game wanted this
key layout, namely E, S, D and X to move using the left
keyboard. Personally I think it'll give you a bad cramp, but there you are...
    A: A600 keys. This remaps the right keyboard to use the cursor keys instead
of the numeric keypad. This should be selected by A600 users without keypads.
    R: returns to normal key layout (both Slug's and A600's keys.)
    N: Select a new set of mazes without erasing current scores.
    Up  and  down  keys  (cursor  keys):   change  the  speed  of  the computer
controlled droids.  Up=faster. Not much use on slow machines.
    0-8:   Maximum  number  of computer droids.  When set to four, for example,
whatever  the  number  of  human players, the computer will always control four
other droids.  When set to a number greater than the current number of computer
droids, some will be erased. Handy if you are being beaten by the damn computer
and your friends drop in...
    C: Continue the game.

    Hitting  F10  (PAUSE)  also  reaches  this  screen.   Do  not  attempt  to
simultaneously run a terminal program using the same serial port as @{i}MazeWarz@{ui}.
One is bound to fail.
@EndNode

@node "compdroids"
@{u}@{b}Computer Droids@{uu}@{ub}
    After  a  short  period  of  time in which a particular droid has been left
unused  (in the "JOIN IN" state), the computer may take control and join in the
battle.   Up to 8 computer droids may play at any one time.  This is adjustable
(see  @{" Controls " Link "controls"}).  Unaccelerated  machines may have problems with more than 4
computer  controlled  droids.   It  may  be  advisable  to  limit the number of
computer droids if you are engaging in a battle over the modem at 2400bps.
    Slow  machines  will  default  to  only 4 computer controlled droids, while
faster  Amigas  will  automatically  set  the  number  to 8.  Of course you are
welcome to change these to suit your preferences.
    The  computer  droids  follow a strict algorithm, and while not very smart,
can  be extremely quick, and are quite a formidable opposition to even the most
seasoned @{i}MazeWarz@{ui} player when set on a fast speed.
    Computer  players  using  droids  that  may be controlled by humans (red to
green) are automatically erased upon entering any human player.
    Computer  droids  use  Havens,  teleporters  and doors.  When teleported or
shot,  they  appear  in the maze with more human players.
@EndNode

@Node "havens"
@{u}@{b}Havens@{uu}@{ub}
    Havens are coloured blocks with little circles in their middle.
    Havens  act  like  Teleporters  to missiles, but you cannot enter any Haven
except  the  Haven that is the same colour as your droid.  You can shoot out of
Havens,  but  no-one can shoot in.  You lose 5 cash points every time you enter
your  haven.  Once inside, a small icon may appear in the space between the two
mazes.   This represents a special power that you have been granted.  A certain
number of cash points are required for you to be granted the powers.  Your cash
points  will  be  deducted for this 'purchase'.  The power endowment process is
automatic  and  the  ability is randomly chosen.  Each time any player receives
special  power, the threshold number of cash points required for the next power
up is increased.  The threshold is initially set at 50.
    Your  special  ability  will last until you are conquered (see below).  The
following table shows the available powers:

@{i}Mega Missile@{ui}    : seeks and follows droids. The missile travels at a much
                  greater speed than normal and may turn corners or  about-face
                  in the pursuit of another droid. Their trail may lead them to
                  hit the originating player. This is one of the hazards of the
                  mega missile. A missile may be aborted by firing again.
@{i}Mines@{ui}           : fire when facing wall to plant a mine: you can die by hitting  
                  own mine. Mines are invisible. You may only have  four  mines
                  on screen at any time. They cannot be destroyed except  by  a 
                  player  colliding  with  them.  In  addition, a mine  may  be
                  detonated remotely by the planter by  firing  upon  it.  This 
                  will cause all players in a 9 square area to be destroyed.
@{i}Deflector Shield@{ui}: missiles that hit you from the  sides (not front or back) are
                  repelled and sent off in the opposite direction!


    Players  with  special  abilities  may  be conquered by being shot 20 times
since his last powerup.  Once a player is conquered, he loses all abilities and
returns  to  normal  playing.   The  conquering  threshold  may increase at the
computer's discretion.
    Note  that players earning multiple powerups, for example mega missiles and
deflector,  may  be  difficult  to  vanquish,  hence  the use of mines by other
players may prove necessary in order to defeat the powerful player.

@Node "serial"
@{u}@{b}Serial Operation@{uu}@{ub}
    All serial operations are carried out with 1 stop bit, no parity and 8 bits
per  character.   The  default  speed  is  2400bps.  If you wish to connect two
computers with a null modem cable, you should set the speed to 9600bps.  If you
wish  to  connect by modem, both computers must have modems that can connect at
2400bps  minimum.   If both machines are using 9600bps (v32) modems, or better,
the 9600bps speed should be selected.
    When  connecting by modem, you will need to command your modem to dial out,
answer  the  phone etc.  Press DEL to enter a string.  This string will be sent
to  the  modem.   Leave  the line blank to exit back to the main game.  You may
require  some  knowledge  of  the  AT  command  set  in  order to use the modem
effectively.  Basically, you should use the string ATD 1234567 where 1234567 is
the  number you wish to dial, and ATDP 1234567 if you only have pulse dialling.
Also,  use  ATS0=2 to enable auto-answering, or ATA to pick up the phone if you
don't  have  auto-answer.  Note that typing a '=' will look like a 0 on the LED
panel, but will be sent correctly to the modem.
    If  you  have  a  modem connection or a cable correctly fitted, press F9 to
change  the  serial  settings.  Here the serial speed may be toggled.  You must
alert  @{i}MazeWarz@{ui}  that  you  have  a  connection and that you wish to initiate a
linked game.  Press A.  One computer will be appointed the control machine, the
other being the slave.  The control computer sends its current maze data to the
slave.   The  first  four players on the control computer remain, and the first
four  players  on  the  slave  machine  are  moved  to the last four positions,
although  the  keys  F1-F8 are remapped to refer to players 5-8.  The remaining
four  positions  on  each  computer screen are replaced by the other computer's
four  players.   Therefore,  the  colours  of  the players' droids on the slave
machine  will  change.   When  the link has been established and the mazes sent
(about  5  seconds later), all players' scores are reset play begins.  To break
the  link,  press  F9  and  then B.  If you wish to send a message to the other
computer,  press  F9  and  then M.  An interactive 'chat' mode will be enabled,
which may be exited by pressing any function key (1-10).
    While  a valid connection is operating, a small link icon will be displayed
in the border between the mazes.  If one computer is put into pause mode or one
of  the  menu options is selected, the other computer is automatically notified
and a scrolling PAUSE message is displayed on that machine.
    If  you  attempt  to  make a connection (A) and there is no direct or modem
link  with another computer, or something goes wrong, you may abort the linking
process  by  hitting a key while the "CONNECTING" message is displayed.  If the
linking  process  is  disrupted or otherwise incomplete, the process with abort
after a few seconds' delay.
    In  order  to  ensure  that  a  reasonable  speed  of play is maintained, a
relative/demand serial system has been employed.  Unfortunately as a result any
errors  in  the  transmission of data (eg line noise) between the computers can
lead  to  various  problems  including  discrepancies between the positions and
movements of players between each computer.  This should not pose a problem for
direct links, however modem users may encounter brief delays on bad lines while
each  computer  is brought back into sync.  If a significant number of problems
occur during play over a modem, it may be advisable to seek another connection.
    It must be pointed out here, that the serial routines are not 100% bug free
(no  shit  sherlock), so don't engage in long distance or expensive phone calls
just   for   the   purpose  of  playing  this  game,  because  you  can  expect
crashes/dropouts.   On  a  direct link, experimentation will eventually lead to
success!   If you want this to be bug free, then just send me your Amiga to use
as a serial test machine...

@Node "about"
@{b}@{u}About SySiS@{ub}@{uu}
    @{i}MazeWarz@{ui}  is  the  second of a series of multiplayer  games  for the Amiga.
The  first,  @{b}Aeroball@{ub},  is  a  two  player futuristic air hockey game with some
twists.   If you like @{i}MazeWarz@{ui} (?!) you should look for a copy on local  BBS's,
or  contact  @{b}SySiS@{ub}.   I  plan  to  continue  this  series for at least one more
release.   This  will  be  a more strategy based space multiplayer game, called
@{b}Dominion@{ub}.  It will have elements of Civilization,  Supremacy  etc.  From 1 to 2
(maybe  4) players will be supported, using a serial link (one for the thinking
man!)
    Other  older  releases  include Blue Murder (whodunnit with atmosphere, not
pinball  graphics like some pretenders), and Ivory Remains, an original musical
mod  'album'  (not  for  the  faint  hearted  or  the  most  serious of musical
connoisseurs.)

@{b}Contacting SiSys@{ub}
    If you wish to contact @{b}SiSys@{ub} regarding @{i}MazeWarz@{ui} or any other SiSys release,
send  flames, suggestions, or requests to @{b}theppell@extro.ucc.su.OZ.AU@{ub}

@{b}Credits@{ub}
    Credit  goes  to  SLUG  for  his  suggestions, encouragement (?), extensive
