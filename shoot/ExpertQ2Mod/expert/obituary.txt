# Obituary File
#
# CAUSES AND CONTEXTS
#
# The format used to specify an obituary is:
#
# [Message],[Cause],[Context 1],...,{Context n}
#
# [Cause] indicates the basic cause of death, such as:
# "fall" - falling damage
# "rocket" - killing by a rocket
#
# All causes are mutually exclusive (you cannot be killed both by a rocket and
# by falling).  For a full list of causes, see "causes.txt".
#
# A "context" represents a special situation beyond the cause of death.  For
# example, the context "victim airborne" indicates that the player who was
# killed was up in the air at the instant he was killed.  If you include a
# context for an obituary message, the message will only occur when the 
# context occurs in the game.  For example:
#
# $AName knocks $VName out of the air with a rocket,rocket,victim airborne
#
# This message will be printed _only_ if the victim was airborne when killed.
# Contexts are not mutually exclusive, and you can write obits with as many 
# contexts from the list of contexts as you like.
#
# MULTIPLE CONTEXTS
#
# If no obituary is defined for the set of all contexts that are true, the
# obituary that matches the most contexts will be used.  If two obituaries
# match an equal number of contexts, the obituary that matches the context
# with the highest value in the table of contexts below will be used.  For 
# example, if the following two obituaries exist:
#
# $AName splattered $VName all over a wall,rocket,gibbed
# $AName knocks $VName out of the air with a rocket,rocket,victim airborne
#
# .. and a player is gibbed while airborne, the second obituary will be used,
# since "victim airborne" appears before "gibbed" in the context table below.
# If you want the second obituary to be used in that situation instead, you 
# can always define another obituary:
#
# $AName splattedered $VName all over a wall,rocket,victim airborne,gibbed
#
# This obituary matches _both_ "gibbed" and "victim airborne", so it will be
# preferred when both "gibbed" and "victim airborne" are true.
#
# NAME AND PRONOUN SUBSTITUTION
#
# Within the message, you can use the following symbols to refer to the name's
# of the killer (attacker) and victim, and the appropriate pronouns for the
# attacker and victim's sex.
#
# $VName        Victim Name                 $AName      Attacker Name
# $VHe          Victim he/she               $AHe        Attacker he/she    
# $VHim         Victim him/her              $AHim       Attacker him/her
# $VHis         Victim his/her              $AHis       Attacker his/her
#
# For example: $VName killed $VHimself
# Becomes:     Player killed himself      (if Player is male)
#              Player killed herself      (if Player is female)
