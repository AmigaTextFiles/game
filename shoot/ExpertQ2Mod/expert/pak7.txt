evilbob's Attack Pak for Quake2 CTF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projectiles:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- both grenade types, hyperblaster bolt, and rocket have all been reskinned for higher visibility
- included Myrkul's modified rocket explosion


HUD:
~~~~
- changed hud text to look "puffie"
- HUD numbers (scores, health value, etc) are a green LCD style
- ammo icons have a transparent background
- weapon icons have been replaced with ammo icons. no you can actually tell which weapon you're using at a glance
- changed some other HUD icons for the hell of it

Sound:
~~~~~~
- included the Expert team audio files

Skins:
~~~~~~
- Changed Male, Female, and Cyborg skins to a high visibility skin type
- There's several alternate skins types included with the pak

Notes:
~~~~~~
- This entire pak was created by me (evilbob) except for the modified rocket explosion
- The HUD numbers (green LCD style) are like that included with 3 Fingers' Quake2 Combat Pak Ultra (and previous version) but were made before I'd seen his pak.

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drop pak7.pak into your ctf directory (eg. \quake2\ctf)
if you have a pak7 already, rename it to pak6
if you have a pak8 or pak9 in that directory, they could override some of the fancies included in this collection
