Note!    
This arc has been updated:
   1.this file did not work with Exp. ram:
	I ran it thru DJ James prg to fix this.
	2. I couldn't get it to load sounds, found
	   out there was a .sound file missing
	   so I added one.
	3. added b4arc and Afterarc to rename files
If these are wrong blame me not the author.

*****    Missile Defense     *****
Public Domain Program for the Amiga
by Glen Merriman, Summer-Fall 1986
100% Assembly Language. Included are
executable and documentation files,
not to be altered without my consent.

Program is called "Missile" and can
be invoked from either CLI or the
Workbench on 1.1 of any Amiga.

If sound effects are desired, be
sure the following files are present
in the same directory as "Missile":
   1. boom.sound
   2. explosion.sound
   3. alarm.sound
   4. ready.sound
   5. chime.sound
   6. siren.sound
   7. tick.sound
You are free to change the sounds!
These sounds were simply taken from
the public domain, and new ones
can be generated using a digitizer.
However, be aware that if your new
sound is not long enough, it will
repeat over and over again. (I did
this because if the sound terminated
before the ADCMD_FREE was called,
the system would sometimes hang
when BeginIO/CMD_WRITE was later
used for another sound. Why does
this sometimes happen???)

INTERESTING TIDBITS:
* This is a multitasking program, so
  try running it 2 or 3 games at once!
  Of course, you'll probably want to
  freeze one while another is progress.

* The sprites are not moved with the
  standard ROMKernel routines (this is
  the only impolite thing my program
  does), and for good reason: speed.
  Therefore, they do not follow the
  screen they're in, and they make a
  humorous distraction when you move
  the game screen to back!

* For a slower paced game, run another
  program in the background. A good
  choice is a music program. Then the
  game has background music!

* Source code is available from me and
  can be obtained with a kind donation
  of $5 to the following humanoid:

  (You will get it on a disk from me if
  you send for it through the mail. Of
  course, the costs of the postage and
  the disk itself dictate that I charge
  an additional $3 for mail service).

  I have gleaned vast knowledge with
  this little project, and I will share
  it along with my other projects,
  including my machine language monitor/
  disassembler which I used to debug my
  game, if you will be so kind as to
  help support my efforts.
