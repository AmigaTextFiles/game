@node DESCRIPTION

  DESCRIPTION:

  Humanity is on the verge of intersellar exploration. The perfect time
  for aliens intent on conquest to expand their empire before man can
  improve his technology and therefore his defensive capabilities.

  There is one ship with any hope of stopping the aliens. An experimental
  design, there is only one trained pilot whose age means he is lacking
  in combat experience. YOU are that pilot.

  With Earth in such desperate need, you are called to duty as your
  home planet's Young Defender.

  A mission briefing will be displayed before the start of each level.

  Good Luck!

@node REQUIREMENTS

  REQUIREMENTS:

  A Commodore Amiga 1200 or 4000 computer (AGA chipset) with 2 MB of RAM.

  Please note that stability of the game on a 2 MB only equipped Amiga cannot
  be guaranteed as there has been minimum testing performed with this setup.

  ALSO RECOMMENDED BUT NOT REQUIRED:

  A joystick plugged into port 2. Control by keyboard is also possible.

  A hard drive. An installation script is provided.

  ADDENDUM: If you have obtained this archive from the Aminet, please
  disregard information about the installation script. See notes under
  hard drive installation. Please note that using the Aminet archive
  requires installing the game to a hard drive. Although it is still
  possible to run the game from a hard drive without loading Workbench,
  I am unable to provide the procedure in this guide file. Running the
  game after loading Workbench will require memory greater than 2 MB
  (Sorry!).

@endnode

@node INSTALLATION

  INSTALLATION:

  Young Defender can be run directly from the release @{" floppy " link FLOPPY} diskettes or
  it can be installed on to a @{" hard drive " link HARDDRIVE}.

  ADDENDUM: If you have obtained this archive from Aminet, the information relating to the
  release floppy diskettes does not apply. Please see the special instructions under
  hard drive installation.

  When Young Defender is run, it will search for a file containing score
  information from previous play sessions. If the file cannot be located,
  a new score table will be created. If there are any changes to the
  table, they will be written to a file which is saved to disk in the
  appropriate place.

@endnode

@node FLOPPY

  FLOPPY INSTALLATION:

  Young Defender can be run from floppy in two ways.

  You may boot your Amiga using Disk One which will automatically load
  and run Young Defender. This method is recommended for Amigas with only
  2MB of RAM as Workbench will not be loaded, therefore maximizing the
  amount of memory available for Young Defender.

  Alternatively, you may boot your Amiga normally with Workbench and
  then run Young Defender. Just insert Disk One after Workbench has loaded
  and then double click on it. When the disk window opens, simply double
  click on the Young Defender icon.

  ADDENDUM: If you have obtained this archive from Aminet, you will need
  to follow the special instructions for hard disk installation. If I
  receive sufficient requests, I may upload archives to Aminet which can
  be used to create a floppy diskette release of the game.

@endnode

@node HARDDRIVE

  HARD DRIVE INSTALLATION:

  An installation script is provided with Young Defender which simplifies
  installing the game to a hard drive. It creates the appropriate
  sub-directories and moves the files from the release floppy diskettes
  to them.

  Start your Amiga and load Workbench as normal. Insert Disk One and
  double click on it. When the disk window opens, simply double click
  on the Install icon. The installation script uses Commodore's
  installer program.

  ADDENDUM: If you have obtained this archive from Aminet, you should
  follow the instructions below for installation to a hard drive. Young
  Defender has been completed for some time and was originally intended
  for submission to 17Bit Software as 5 x 720KB floppy diskettes. The
  archive you have obtained is designed to allow ease of use from Aminet.

  Simply extract the files from this archive to the location that you
  wish to store them on your hard drive. A directory called "Young
  Defender" will be created at that location with an icon file.
  This will complete the installation and the game can then be run
  from Workbench by double clicking on the icon provided in the
  "YoungDefender" draw. Please note that because you are running the
  game with Workbench loaded, you will need to have in excess of 2 MB
  of memory.

@node AUTHORS

  AUTHORS:

  Eclipse Software Productions is a software development division of Eclipse
  Group.

  Eclipse Group is primarily Ken Richards & Sandy Earle.

  We are interested in any suggestions, ideas etc, whether they be
  programming or design tips or even game ideas. We would like to
  hear from people who would be interested in testing any future
  games that we may develop, including Young Defender II. To date,
  our lack of experience has directed us to convert simple games
  from the past, but we have learnt a few things when developing this
  game which have made us eager to try new game ideas.

  If you would like to contact us, please send a letter to the following
  address:

                         Sandy Earle

  Check out our other games called "The Great Gold Raid" and
  "Class E: Lunar Module" which are available from 17 Bit Software
  (disk # 3309 and disks # 3665 A & B).

  The YD.diary file contains a history of the development of the game if
  you are interested. (Not present in the Aminet archive)

  ADDENDUM: The graphic artist for this game, Sandy Earle, has moved on
  and unless someone would like to provide me with original graphics it
  seems unlikely that I will be able to produce any further games.
