@{BODY}@{JLEFT}@{I}This guide uses some special features of the OS3.1
@{AMIGAGUIDE} system. Hope it will be readable for users of older versions,
too... @{UI}

@ENDNODE

@NODE requirements "What you need"
Whools needs an Amiga equipped with @{B}OS2.0@{UB} or better and at least
@{B}512 KB RAM@{UB}. Since Whools doesn't hack around anywhere in the system,
it is compatible with all kind of hardware and software supported by the
OS (see the section about @{"screenmodes" LINK screen}).


@{"ptreplay.library" LINK ptreplay.readme/main} V2 is needed to hear
the music (version 6 is included in the Whools package).

@ENDNODE

@NODE screen "Screen modes etc."
@{U}@{B}Note for non-PAL/NTSC-screenmode users:@{PLAIN}


Whools opens its screen (320×200×32) in PAL or NTSC mode, according to your
Amiga hardware. But due to Whools' system friendly routines this screen may
be promoted to any screen you desire.


I (Philip) am using a VGA monitor connected to an A1200 in multiscan screen
modes and have Whools' screen being promoted to a Multiscan 320×240 screen
without having any problems.


There are different commodities which will promote screens for you, e.g.
NewMode, ModePro or MCP, which are available thru Aminet. I assume that
everybody using non-PAL/NTSC modes has already obtained such a tool.


If you are using DblPAL or DblNTSC modes you can also promote Whools' by
selecting `Mode Promotion' (`Modus übernehmen' in German) in the IControl
system preferences.



Theoretically, Whools should be capable to run on graphics board screens,
e.g. under CyberGraphX, too. But this could not be tested by the authors,
so feel free to send @{"us" LINK authors} your superfluous hardware :-)

@ENDNODE

@NODE installation "Installation"
@{B}@{U}Select the medium you want to install Whools on:@{PLAIN}


    @{" Harddisk " LINK hdinstall}

    @{" Floppy disk " LINK diskinstall}


@ENDNODE

@NODE hdinstall "Harddisk installation"
Double-click on the @{I}Install @{UI}icon to start the installation.
Then follow the instructions given on the screen.

@ENDNODE

@NODE diskinstall "Floppy disk installation"
Whools can be started directly from disk without any further installation
process.


If you play the game from floppy, you should make a backup of it. Consult
your Workbench manual on how to make backups of disks if you don't know.


@{B}Do only perform changes (deleting unneeded icons etc. - read on) @{I}on
your private backup! @{UI}Always keep an unchanged original version! Please
do not redistribute changed versions
(see the @{"legal information" LINK legal} for more details)!@{UB}


After you have made the backup, have a look at the @{I}Icons @{UI}drawer. If
you like the icons you find there better than the original ones, put them
into the main directory of Whools. The old icons will then be overwritten.

Then you may delete the @{I}Icons @{UI}drawer.


You may also want to delete the Installer script.


If you have only 1 MB RAM, you should make your disk bootable. Then you
don't need to start Workbench first but you can simply boot the Whools
disk to start the game. This will save some memory.
In order to make the disk bootable, type


 @{B}Install df#:@{UB}


in the Shell/CLI, where # stands for the drive number where your Whools disk
is in (0-3). If you have only one drive, type


 @{B}Install ?@{UB}


Then put the Whools disk into the drive, type @{B}df0:@{UB} and press Return.


If Whools is in a subdirectory on the disk, you should move the files to the
root (main) directory of the disk now. (If the subdirectory is named "Whools"
then rename it first, beacause otherwise the Workbench would try to overwrite
the drawer with the program file of the same name.) Note that there are some
files without icons, so select @{I}Show All Files @{UI}from the Window menu
first.


Now you can simply boot the disk and the game will load automatically.

@ENDNODE

@NODE howtoplay "How to play"
You start the game by double-clicking on its icon, by clicking on the
@{I}START THE GAME @{UI}button on the @{"contents page" LINK main} of this
guide or by typing @{B}Whools@{UB} in the CLI/Shell (after "CD'ing" into
Whools' directory). Depending on the type of @{"installation" LINK installation},
it is also possible to start the game by booting its disk.


Your task sounds simple, but it isn't... You have to eliminate all whools in
all levels because they have stolen your grandma's toothbrush last week.
@{I}(Hmmm... I guess some work has still to be done on this "story" :-)@{UI}


After you have started the game, you'll first see a map of the whole level.
Press a key or mousebutton to start playing this level. During the level,
only a smaller map is available. It shows an area of 13*11 fields around
you and is activated by pressing the Help key or by clicking on
"SHOW MAP". Using the F10 key you can select whether the map shall
be oriented to your viewing direction or always to the north. The latter
might be better for orientation.


You move through the maze by using the cursor keys: Via the up key you
move one step forward, the down key brings you one step back and the
left/right keys allow you to turn left/right. Holding the Shift key
down while pressing left or right brings you one step left or right.
Using the mouse for moving is also possible: Move the mouse pointer over
the 3D view, and you'll see the mouse pointer changing its shape depending
on its position. Click with the left mouse button and you'll move/turn
in the direction indicated by the mouse pointer's shape. Try it out, it's
harder to explain than to see.


When you meet a whool then shoot at him. The fire key is the Ctrl key.
You can also fire by pressing the right mouse button when the mouse
pointer is located over the 3D view. This allows "mouse-only" steering.


You can select one of three weapons by pressing the corresponding
numeric key. The weapons are different in strength and need of energy.


Now click on "SET TARGET" or press Return or Enter. You'll hear a
short beep that indicates that your transporter is prorammed with
a new coordinate, namely your current coordinate in the maze.
Move some fields away from that position and then click on "ENGAGE BEAM"
or press the Backspace key. You beam to the position you was at
when you clicked on "SET TARGET". If not, that can have two reasons:
You either don't have enough energy left, or a whool is currently at
the target position.


By clicking on "SAVE" you can save the current game status to disk
and continue the game at a later time. @{I}WARNING: @{UI}The score is not
saved to disk for the simple reason that otherwise you could get
one hiscore entry after the other by simply reloading a saved game
with a high score!

@NODE legal "Hmm? Copyright? What's that?"
You play this game on your own risk! Do not make us responsible for any heart
attacks or whatever could happen...


This game is @{B}©1997 by @{"Pointed Ear Software Design" LINK authors}@{UB}.


You may copy it, copy it and copy it, give it to anyone you do or do not like,
put it on your harddisk, print Hex dumps of the files and put them on your
walls, burn it on PD CD-ROMs, on magazin cover disks or whereever you like.
@{B}But:@{UB} @{"All files" LINK files} must be included in their unchanged
form! Compressions and the like are, of course, allowed. If you find it
necessary to add any files (whyever?), it should be apparent at first glance
that they do not belong to the original package.
You may not take money for the software! You may take
a @{U}@{I}small@{UU} @{UI}fee for the disk and for copying
the data on it, but @{I}not more than 5 DM or 3 US$! @{UI}Commercial use of
this program is only allowed if it is an addendum (for example, to a hard
disk or to disk packages). But then the price of the product may not rise
because of this software!


This release concept is commonly known as @{I}FREEWARE@{UI}.


There are quite a number of companies who offer freely distributable software
for 5.90 DM or more per disk and - to make things even worse - only copy
1 program onto a disk, even if it takes just a few K! One of these companies
is Mallander Computer Software in Germany. This is too much!
If we see you offering this game for more than 5 DM without
us having given you our written permission, we will take proceedings against
you!!! Remember this.
