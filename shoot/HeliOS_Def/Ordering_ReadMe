  The simply re-programmable version of the Defender game.   £15

  The fully re-programmable version of the Defender game
  with source code, custom HeliOS compiler, and language
  documentation.                                             £25

  The stand-alone version of the HeliOS language compiler.   £35
  This allows a HeliOS program to be compiled and run
  without the presence of the full HeliOS system, but is
  only recommended for use in low memory conditions where
  the full HeliOS system would be inoperable.

  The integrated version of the HeliOS language with
  editors, debugger, interpreter, compiler etc.  This
  is the full HeliOS system which has many features
  designed to make programming easy, and which is much
  preferable, for beginners and experts alike, to the
  the simple stand-alone HeliOS compiler.                    £65

  The help and example kit.  This provides comprehensive
  help on all HeliOS commands and full commented source
  code for example programs demonstrating the use of all
  major HeliOS functions.  This set of disks has over
  1000 help files and nearly 1000 software examples,
  making HeliOS easily the most extensively documented
  programming language on the Amiga!                         £35

  A complete set of all the above modules.                   £100
