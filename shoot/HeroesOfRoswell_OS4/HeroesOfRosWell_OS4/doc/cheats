Cheat Mode

Why would you want to cheat, doesn't that take all of the fun out of the game? Well, there's good news for you cheaters, upon completion of the game (on any difficulty level) cheat mode will be enabled until the game is exited.

Is there a way to enable cheats without beating the game? Of course, this game is open source. Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right was nothing. Dive right in to the source code, change it and recompile, presto chango! Why not port it to mac while you're there?
