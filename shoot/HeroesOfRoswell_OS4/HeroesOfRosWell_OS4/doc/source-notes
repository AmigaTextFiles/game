Source Code Notes

You are being warned once and only once, the source code is horribley messy. I am fully aware that the source code is a mess, therefore; comments like: "That shouldn't even work!" or "WTF! you suck!" are not only unneeded, but highly unwanted. I've already recieved enough negative comments about the source code, I don't need another. Maybe the source code to my next game will be neater, but only the future can tell.

With that said, I am most likely the only one who can understand how the source code works, making adding weapons and features near impossible for even an experienced programmer. All negative comments about the source code may be directed at your local brick wall.

I would however, immensely enjoy it if someone could possibley port/compile this game on other operating systems. This *should* be a simple thing to do (the game is written using SDL [libsdl.org]) but as previously mentioned, the source code is sloppy and the task is not so easy.
