Enemies in HOR

Along with the 4 "regular" enemies described here, there are 4 oversized "boss" ships to destroy.

Dumb UFO - These are the standard issue alien enemy fighters, these ships are relatively weak and carry only a small amount of ammo. They should make perfect targets to up your kill count and earn more power ups.

Bird Head - Large slow ships that pack a punch, you'd do best to stay away from these if they come out more than one at a time. They have moderately strong shields and carry a good deal of ammo.

Interceptor - Part of the Elite Alien Attack Fleet (EAAF for short), these large, well shielded ships weave back and forth while firing a heavy blaster. If you manage to let one expend all of it's ammo, these ships become sitting ducks.

EAAF Skel Ship - A fast, versatile attack ship making up the majority of the EAAF. These ships not only pack a punch with heavy blasters, but sport the strongest class of alien shields and a moderate payload of ammo. Do not attempt an assault on these ships without having a powered up blaster.
