How to Play HOR

Heroes of Roswell is a top down vertical scrolling shooter. If you were around in the late 80s early 90s, chances are you've played games like this in the past. You control a ship by pressing the up down left and right arrow keys, and fire blasters at enemy ships by pressing the left Ctrl button. Getting hit by enemy bullets will deplete your shields. When your shields are depleted your ship will blow up and you will lose a life. When you've lost all of your lives, the game is over.

Your goal in HOR is to save the earth from an alien menace hell bent on destroying the earth. In order to aquire power ups for your ship, you will need to destroy enemies. Once a powerup is on screen, shoot it open to aquire it's powers. At the end of every level is a big bad boss to destroy, destroy this oversized enemy to move onto the next level.
