Welcome to Fleuch 3.0!


This is a version based on Fleuch2.0 by Karsten Goetze with some
extensions by Andreas Spreen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game:

 You have to move the small space ship through the scenery without touching
 the walls. Look for a ball and try to fly in short distance to it, then
 hit space to pick it up. The level ends, if you climb to the top.
 If your ball is destroyed (but not the ship) enter ESC to get a new ball.

Fleuch is based on Thrust from the C64.

The controls:
                         ESC - end level/game
                           P - pause

  Keyboard mode:           A - left turn
                           S - right turn
                 SHIFT RIGHT - thrust
                      RETURN - fire
                       SPACE - pick up ball 


  Joystick mode:  LEFT/RIGHT - turn left/right
                          UP - thrust
                        DOWN - pick up ball
                 FIRE BUTTON - fire

Music was made with Teijo Kinnunens great "MED - music editor V3.20".
His playroutine is used in the game.

The game looks for files in the subdirectory "data" which should
be in the same directory as the main program. The font "fleuch"
is used, so make sure, it's in the right place (fonts:).
Also the mathffp.library, the mathtrans.library and the
diskfont.library are needed. Start game from CLI or Workbench.

Hiscores are saved, so disable write protection on disk.
While looking at the hiscores, you can press DEL to
reinitialize all tables.

I hope NTSC-Users will also have their fun with it and the
game runs on every Amiga. If not, please send me a note.
