@{b} WarpHexen - The 3D Game for PowerPC@{ub}

@{b} Networking @{ub}

To use TCP/IP:

-net <number of players>

To use IPX:

-netipx <number of players>

(you need amipx.library installed)

If problems appear, and IPX does not run, try if:

-reverseipx -netipx <number of players>

works. (new feature in V1.2)

-netserial <number of players> <devicename.device> <unit> <speed>

To network with a PC you should also add:

-pcchecksum

Note, that Hexen on PC does not support TCP/IP !!!

If you get problems with it, please contact me !!!

@node intro "AmiHeretic"

@{b} WarpHexen - The 3D Game for PowerPC@{ub}

@{b} Introduction @{ub}

Hexen is one of the "Classics" on the 3D market, the fantasy
game from Ravensoft, which came after Doom. Ravensoft recently
released the Source Code. This is a port of the Game to the
WarpUP PowerPC Kernel. It is currently a basic port, but will
enhance much in the following. I and Thomas Frieden want to make it
the best Hexen Port out there. An 68k version probably will also
be added later.

WarpHexen supports:

- WarpUP :)
- Both playing in a screen and in a workbench window
- Keyboard, Joystick, mouse
- TCP/IP, AmIPX and Serial Link Support
- PowerPC Assembler Optimization (since V1.1) (4 functions)
- Sound (Finally !!!) :)

More things soon, in new versions.

All Crashes should now be fixed !!! If you still get some, use
the "List Hunk/Offset of Crash" Feature of WarpUP V4 to send
me a bugreport (V4 was recently released at H&P).

WarpHexen uses a simple GUI which also handles the stack correctly.
A more advanced GUI will come later.

@node install "WarpHexen"

@{b} WarpHexen - The 3D Game for PowerPC@{ub}

@{b} Installation @{ub}

Currently you need to own a PPC Board to use WarpHexen. This
will probably change in the future, when both PPC and 68k versions
of WarpHexen will be available.

Software you need:

- WarpUP PowerPC Software

This is the new PowerPC standard, replacing the ppc.library. On new
PowerPC Boards like the Brainstormer only WarpUP programs will run,
but not ppc.library programs. WarpHexen of course will support
the Brainstormer G3 Board !!!

It does not work with V7, as i need to get the Busclock of the Board,
and the function to do so needs powerpc.library V10 at least. If you
need WarpUP and ppc.library both, i recommend using WarpUP V14 and
the ppc.library emulation for WarpUP of Frank Wille together. There
won't be a future for ppc.library, so it is a bad idea relying on it...
new PPC Boards are WarpUP-only, but 2-2.5x faster than current Boards,
due to a more modern PPC called G3 (Info: www.escena.de)

- rtgmaster.library

Get it from Aminet gfx/board/rtgmaster_user.lha

- locale.library

Not required, but if you want to play with a joystick...

- Hexen WAD File

You can get this from ftp.cdrom.com (Shareware Version). For full
version, contact Ravensoft. AmiHeretic supports all sorts of
Heretic WAD Files. No "special" WAD required.

- dmxemul.library

This great Library from Christian Sauer (Thanks for the sound
coding help !!! :) ) is needed for the sound support. It is
included to this archive.

If you run the Shareware-Version use the parameter -shareware !!!

WarpHexen -shareware

To be able to save: Create the directory hexendata in the local
directory !!!

@node config "WarpHexen"

@{b} WarpHexen - The 3D Game for PowerPC@{ub}

@{b} Configuration @{ub}

By using the Hexen.CFG you can configure the Keyboard and some other
things. In the future a GUI will help here. You have to use RAWKEY codes
to specify your own settings. I think the default ones are quite good.
If you do not like them: Change them.

The default settings:

Turn Right:      Right Arrow
Turn Left:       Left Arrow
Forward:         Up Arrow
Backward:        Down Arrow
Strafe left:     ,
Strafe right:    .
Fly Up:          Numberblock 9
Fly Down:        Numberblock 3
Fly Center:      Numberblock 6
Look Up:         Numberblock 7
Look Down:       Numberblock 1
Look Center:     Numberblock 4
Inventory left:  [
Inventory right: ]
Use Artifact:    RETURN
Fire:            CONTROL
Force Strafe:    SHIFT
Speed:           ALT
Use:             Blank
Gamma:           HELP
Pause:           DEL
Automap:         TAB
Help Screen:     F1
<:               Jump

(Rest like written on the help screen)

Asides from the keys (do not try to use Amiga-keys... you would not
be able to use Amiga-Keys and Arrow-Keys at the same time) you can
specify:

- usegamma: The default gamma value
- chatmacro's: Set chatmacro's
- screenblocks: Set Screenblocks
- use_fps: Use fps counter

@node prob "WarpHexen"

@{b} WarpHexen - The 3D Game for PowerPC@{ub}

@{b} Possible Problems @{ub}

1: Termination problems

If the game crashes on start, or during termination, this is not
WarpUP's fault. In fact there is "Anti-WarpUP-Code" in the FlashROM
of the A1200 PPC and in the ppc.library.

To get rid of this "Anti-WarpUP-Code", do ONCE in a shell (it is saved
to your HD then):

echo >env:powerpc/TERMINATOR "2"
echo >envarc:powerpc/TERMINATOR "2"

Then reboot. If you have a very old FlashROM use "1" instead of "2". One
of the two works. Note, that this might not work, if you have ppc.library
apps installed in the background (Maybe you should consider installing
Frank Wille's ppc.library Emulation ?).

Do NOT install:

- CGX PPC (doesn't do a speedup anyways, only does Memory Allocation with
  ppc.library to disable WarpUP, else the same like CGX 68k)
- ppc.library based Datatypes
- RC5-PPC
- Printer-Spooler of Turboprint PPC
- PPCInstall
- ElfLoadSeg

Remember, on future PPC Boards *only* WarpUP will run. Best you adapt now
already. I don't have a SINGLE ppc.library app on my system...

If you get crashes after quit or if you get a black screen this is a
termination problem. Or if it crashes after the termination requester.

I am really sorry about these things, but they are not my fault, nor the
fault of H&P. It will be good when the new Boards appear, where no ppc.library
which tries to mess around exists...

2: rtgmaster crashes (but it is no problem with WarpUP)

Then put

c:MCPramlibpatch >nil:

to your startup-sequence. This tool is in the rtgmaster package. The reason
for these problems is an incompatibility of the 68k part of rtgmaster with
certain tools like MCP. The ramlibpatch fixes this.

3: CV/PPC or BV/PPC problem

do:

echo >env:powerpc/force "1"
echo >envarc:powerpc/force "1"
echo >env:powerpc/gfxaddr "$e0000000"
echo >envarc:powerpc/gfxaddr "$e0000000"

and reboot. And now it works. Go sure you use powerpc.library V14 or higher.

4: Stackproblems

Use the GUI or set the cache manually. If you use the GUI stack is handled
automatically. Note: For some systems it seems the RunCommand function
of dos.library does not work (an "evil system patch" active ?) They should
raise the stack manually

5: Problems when Miami is running

Miami seems to have with certain settings problems with WarpHexen. With
AmiTCP it works fine, though. And if the settings are correct, also with
Miami. It is appearently important, that in TCP/IP the "dynamic" checkmark
is set. If the configuration is done right, it also runs with Miami.
