Introduction
------------

Sub Attack is based on the old "shoot the ships" arcade game.  The idea is 
that you have to launch your torpedo at the correct time so that the torpedo
meets the ship as they both travel across the screen.  The concept is simple
(I'm sure that you've seen it before...).

The controls
------------

Sub Attack is controlled using the mouse.  The left button fires the torpedo.
The catch here is that you only have one torpedo on the screen at any one
time. The right mouse button brings up another screen which explains the
scoring and has buttons for selecting the "about", "credits", "high score"
and "help" screens. 

Scoring
-------

Points are awarded for destroying ships (what else?). There are four types
of ship, each traveling at a different speed. The faster the ship, the more
points you get.  After you destroy 20 ships, you move to the next level.
Ships are launched more frequently on progressive levels.  If you miss 20
ships, the game ends.

Version 1.0
-----------

Version 1.0 is a shareware version, which means that it is being released
into the public domain.  If you like the game, send me whatever you think
it's worth.

Registered users will receive the next version of "Sub Attack", which will
only be available to registered users.  See the "About" screen in "Sub Attack"
for a few more details.

Anyone who sends $10 (Australian please) and a disk will be registered, and
will get the source code in return.

Next Version
------------

I'm already working on the next version in  the hope that someone will
register and make this all worth while.  Naturally, I'll do my best to fix
any bugs (but ya gotta tell me about 'em, or else I won't know!).  I've got
a few other ideas such as:

 - a few more types of ship
 - a more interesting scene (i.e., waves etc.)
 - the ability to lay a mine or two floating in the water
 - the ability to turn the sound off or adjust the volume
 - the ability to start at a different level
 - whatever you think is a good thing....

If you've got an idea, drop me a line an tell me.  I'll even write back!

Well, that's it. There is not much more I can say about "Sub Attack", except
that I hope you enjoy it. 

        "Sub Attack" was proudly written in AMOS, © Mandarin/Jawx
          and compiled using the AMOS compiler (Thanks Francois!).


Special thanks to Andy K and all those who register (I'll name you in the next
release!).
