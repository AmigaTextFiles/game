  I've been playing Doom II with ADoom v0.6 for the last few hours,
and I can wholeheartedly say: YAHOOOO!!!!! GREAT, GREAT FUN!!!!

  Oh yeah! It is fast, fast, fast on my 030 now. On some scenes it's even
faster than my 486 PC. Of course with some complex views, it's a bit slower.

  I downloaded v0.8 and tried it, and it is MOST COOL!!!
Now that the popping in the music is gone, the game has a really
polished feel! And, I noticed on some simpler levels, the engine
really speeds up on my 030 (up past 10fps). 
[...]
  ADoom v1.1 is awesome! I can actually run it in 320x240 with
no noticable slowdown!

  I tried 640x400, 640x480, even 704x500 (which looked incredible!).
All of them a barely playable on my machine, but the resolution was
truly impressive looking! Very cool!  

  How *do* you do it?

when you select a menu option.

Your version doesn't display any of these problems, sound works
without the need for AHI. The graphics look as they should on a

This letter concerns Adoom. Firstly id like to tell you what you've
done. You have brought the very finest the gaming world has to offer
to Amiga, you have given us a PERFECT conversion of Doom, except this
is better, it can Multitask. Whats more is that this early beta
version runs like it is on a bloody p200, on my 060/50. yes it runs
like a bloody dream! Its fast, Its Smooth and its down right
impressive. To be honest I didnt think even an 060 was capable of
this. But this has re-wrote the book on how good the Amiga is.  With
my 060 and AGA I can play this game which i thought was impossible.
Yes for years Ive thought that games such as gloom are better, and
indeed i still think that Gloom is unbeatable, but doom is pushing it
very close.

ADoom is bloody brilliant! It runs quite smooth at almost full screen on my

great speed but doesn't the latest SetPatch do the same thing?? You say there
is not much Amiga specific code yet. Does that mean it could get even
faster?!? At the moment it is running faster than Gloom!

Ah well, it's great to have such a good game finally for free on Amiga!

Keep the 040 optimisation BTW. You need it. I need it. It's good enough. ;)

I just want to send you a I-like-your-port-it's-better-than-the-others-letter.
You have made a good job. Firstly, it works. Secondly, it's fast. I read
that it had optimized c2p for 040 and I was very happy, because I have 040.
I tried it and it was definitely faster than the others that I had tried.
It took some time to figure that I had played the game WITHOUT 040
optimized c2p. I had to start without startup-sequence because of little
memory and then the FPU wasn't recognized until I started setpatch. THEN it
went FAST! :)

Cybervision 64/3D 4Mb and Scandoubler using r69c CyberGfx3. 

I usually use a 320x200 8-bit CGfx display on ADoom but it also works
very well on every standard screenmode I have tried so far.

I have compared ADoom with the other amiga versions currently being
distributed and so far yours has impressed me the most.  For a start
it is more functional.

with deley and when I quit the Doom it crashes the hole system.

Cybervision 64/3D + CGX Software v3.1
Blizzard 1230-IV / 16 MB of fast Ram

Congatulations - didn't they say it could never be done?

I downloaded ADoom 0.2 from the Aminet on Friday. Had a bit of trouble
getting the WAD file but eventually downloaded it from Marcus
Geelnard's (AmiDoom) site (other sites were very slow and kept
throwing me out before the end).

Anyway the game runs great, very smooth on about 3/4 full screen. I am
using an A1200 with 040/33 Apollo board and 8MB fast (AGA only). So
far I have had no crashes and it multitasks well with Workbench 3.0,
with no problems on exiting. Sound is a bit off and on (occasionally
samples are missed if several other sounds are already playing - is
this a limitation of the audio.device/Paula chip?). No music either.

Keep up the good work. Perhaps this example will be the inspiration
that the big software companies need to get back into the Amiga
market.

Long live Amiga!

and I was really amazed (I still am :) over the speed of it, in fact that
it was running on a custom 256 colour screen and multitasking!!
It runs very well on my A1200 040/40 AGA, and I run it in 3 sizes below
the full screen window to make it go smooth, although it's playable in
fullscreen too, but not as smooth.
Today I've tested several Amiga DOOM compilations, but ADoom is still,
without doubt the fastest one (at least on my 040/40 AGA) and the sound
effects work perfectly! For example AmigaDoom uses AHI for the sound and
it doesn't sound very good with annoying clicks every time a sound is
played, I don't know if this is caused by AHI or if the author(s) of
AmigaDoom has made some mistakes.

Just again another email to send a big THANK YOU to you for making the best

CV64/3d / CGFX3 / OS 3.1 and I've also seen it running on an a1230/50 at which
the speed was very impressive too. I've had absolutely NO problems at all
(except for some tiny red glitches sometimes, but they didn't bother me),
either running from workbench or without startup-sequence. 

It made me very happy that the game runned so slick on our great Amiga, and
once again it shows what a simple Amiga can do with it's 'puny' MC680x0! And
again it shows the tremendous enthousiasm of Amiga users, the sourcecode's
only 10 days out and a PeeZee game is very succefully ported 5 times to our
so-called 'dead' platform, and loads of people are already playing it,
according to userhints.txt! Gr8 stuff, and it certainly will keep a few more
people from giving in to the 'dark side'. ;)

Please keep up the good work, and maybe somebody can add support for that nice
S3-Virge chip on that CV64/3d of mine?

I just have one small request. Could you add a hires mode? You know,
640x480x256.

Because since playing Doom II on the higher levels, where all the wide open
spaces are, the moire effect caused by all the distant walls is giving me
eye cramps.

If you could manage to add the hires mode, this would releave my eye strain
enormously (I hope)! >B')

Today I decided to test something that has received alot of hype lately,
Doom on the Amiga.  I was pleased to see what the noise was all about - an
excellent version of Doom for an excellent computer.

Over the past 4 years, the Amiga has received alot of bad press.  There are
some fundamental problems with the Amiga hardware - but when programmed
properly, they are barely noticable.  Several years ago, I defected to the
PC, since there was more money in it.

As I said, I have downloaded ADoom, and spent about 3 hours playing today.
All I have is an A1200 with 68020/68882 @ 33Mhz, but the it was really fast
in 3/4 the screen size.

Great job - the Amiga needs more programmers like you and less programmers
like myself defecting to the PC.  You have given me the inspiration to
return to programming on the Amiga.

Nicholas Piper <pcomm@inorbit.com> writes:

 All DOOMS require a WAD, this contains all the game information,
 like sounds, graphics, level details etc. etc. If you don't
 want to pay for one, use the Shareware WAD from the original
 Shareware DOOM. This is availible at

   http://www.dtrance.ch/doom/download/Doom-[Shareware].lzx

 and

   http://www.pluk.com/

 I think. This is the ONLY WAD you can use without paying. If you
 want to use all the hundreds of custom WADS and 3rd party levels
 (say from ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/) you need the commercial
 WAD. This contains loads of more information that these
 custom 3rd party WADS don't contain but the game needs. You
 can get this WAD by buying the Doom game and copying it over
 to your Adoom/AmiDoom directory. You can then use them
 by doing "Adoom -file custom.wad" etc.

 You are NOT paying for ADoom or AmiDoom, but for the commercial
 WAD. Sure, ID software gave the source away, but they still
 want money :-)) Its only about 9.99 UKP, so go and buy it... maybe
 it'll encourage ID to give us the source to more games :-)

 When you add a custom.wad via -file, it replaces one or more
 of the levels. The level and episode should be given in the .txt
 file that belongs to the WAD. E2L3 would mean that the wad replaces
 Level 3 on episode 2. Therefore, to play that new level, you need
 to play the game until you get to level 3, after selecting episode
 2. (The second one on the list....) OR you can jump to that section
 by typing in IDCLEV23. To jump to E1L3 it would be IDCLEV13, etc.
 Sometimes you might see E3M3, but it means the same thing, they
 just used the word mission, instead of level I guess :-)

 Alternatively, you can warp straight to the level, by using
 the command line, =


  adoom -file whatever.wad -devparm -warp 2 5 -skill <skill number>

 Where <skill number> is in the range 1 to 5.

[...]

Questions Then (the FAQ bit)
----------------------------

Q. "Error: R_TextureNumForName: SW1BLUE not found"
   What does this mean ?

A.
   You have named the shareware WAD as doom.wad, it should
   be named as doom1.wad. I'm using doom1.wad, which is
   4196020 bytes. If yours is that size, call it doom1.wad,
   remove all the other wads, and off you go :-)

Ok, I've worked it out. I didn't realise WADs replaced individual levels.
turned out the wads I was trying to play DIDN'T replace level 1, so of
course I was seeing the normal level 1. Hmm...

if I -file a wad that replaces level 1, all is well. except that it's very

Ok, I figured out what the problem was, and I have no idea why it would do

Using ADOOM 0.4 the DOOM2.WAD runs perfectly on my 030 50Mhz but I have to

I have tried two WADS with ADoom at this time, both from the shareware

The WAD from version 1.666 does work.

IWADs are the main WAD files; PWADs are patch wad files.  If you check
the head of a wad file you will see 'IWAD' or 'PWAD'.  It's how DOOM
tells whether or not a patch wad file is really a patch wad file.
You assume the IWAD is in the same directory as ADoom unless you
specify a patch wad with the -file switch; if you specify -file,
you assume the IWAD is in the same directory as the patch wad.
You need the ability to set where the IWAD is and where the PWAD(s)
are independent of each other or ADoom.  Mike thinks you should 
keep a path for EACH patch wad, but at least have the ability to
do seperate paths for the IWAD, the PWAD(s), and ADoom.

When I try to play demo files (extension LMP) I use the argument:

"adding e1-uv.lmp", but when it's about to start the game (right
after setting up the screenmode) it says:

Error: W_GetNumForName: e1-uv not found!

Could it be becouse it's missing ".lmp" in the last case? Or is
trying to look in the WAD file for the LMP file?

No difference with or without.

I tried another LMP file named "e1m4.lmp" and this time it didn't
come up with the errormessage, but when it started playing the

There are patches for WADs, even one updates the WAD to Ultimate Doom :)
[...]
So, as I promised, I checked the IDsoft site for the WAD updates.
I succesfully updated a WAD that didn't work neither in ADoom nor
the shareware DOOM.EXE to fully working Ultimate Doom.
To upgrade the WAD I did the following:

1. I got the updates from IDsoft site. It's
ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/doom/ - there are some ZIP (both
normal and sfx archives for PC) files. Read the .txt files and 
get the update from 1.1/1.2 to 1.9 and from 1.9 to Ultimate 
(don't remember the names, though)

2. I copied these updates and DOOM.WAD (which refused to work -
"STBAR not found" with shareware DOOM.EXE) (size 10396254) 
and also a shareware edition of Doom.

3. Unpacked everything  in the same directory and ran the 
PSHELL.EXE  (from 1.1 or 1.2 update). The updating process took 
a lot of time  on my P75 (note: you have to have atleast DOOM.WAD 
and DOOM.EXE, otherwise the patcher won't run). After succesful
patching the WAD file should have about 11 MB.

4. Then I unpacked the 1.9 to ultimate update (still in the same
dir) and ran PSHELL.EXE. After another couple of minutes I finally
got the Ultimate DOOM.WAD, size 12408292 bytes.

5. I copied the WAD to ADoom dir on Amiga and renamed it to
DOOMU.WAD. Works perfectly.

TIPS TO SPEED UP DISK LOADING

Alvaro Thompson <alvaro@enterprise.net> writes:

Also, I noticed how loooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggg
it took for the game to load the Doom II WAD file. It was also pretty
slow when loading each level etc. I imagine this is because of the
massive file size.  Maybe you could overcome this? Perhaps you could
make some small utility that will somehow split one massive WAD file
into several small ones, therefore taking less time to load in the
game.

I noticed that every time a new gfx appears, it has to be loaded from
the HD, eg an explosion, a new kind of enemy, etc, which produces a
very nasty jerking. Is there anyway that you could pre-load all of
these gfx into the game, before the game is going? This would be
excellent!

I think, it would be a very good Idea to execute this commandline
("Addbuffers : 500") from the Executable. If you think, that's too
memory-hungry, than you could make the buffer-size user-definable.

Removing the buffers after initializing the refresh-daemon doesn't make
sense, I think. For two reasons: sometimes during the Game file Acces is
necassary, which in some cases also isn't very fast with the standard 30

normally have enough RAM to spend this tiny 250 kB on Disk-Buffers.

KEYBOARD AND JOYPAD BUTTON REMAPPING
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason Frecknall <jay@blidworth.demon.co.uk> writes:

Any chance of you changing the fire key (CTRL)?  I edited the .doomrc
file and changed fire to right alt (Ascii=184), so it's the same as on
the PC, and sidestep to the ctrl key (just to move it out of the way
for now) and strangely both Right Alt and Right Amiga fire your
weapon.  Do you plan to change the keys to a more Amiga friendly
arrangement?  There might be a problem with Alt and Amiga being used
together if you can get them working independantly since this
combination is for keyboard control of the mouse pointer.

Jason Frecknall <jay@blidworth.demon.co.uk> writes:

The key CTRl maps to varies.
Mine is Insert and a friends is caps lock or num lock.
As mentioned in my previous mail Right Alt and Amiga both map to the same
ascii value, but I have since noticed that with Trance's port this doesn't
happen.

Joypad support works great, It makes a huge difference in playability
it's very easy to dodge enemy fire now.

The sidestep/strafe function works good and is very approprietly placed on
the upper cd 32 button's, Thanks.

I can also use the cd 32 pause/play button to get to the options  menu and
use the blue button for opening doors(red for fire).

The green and yellow buttons doesn't seem to do anything so i guess you
haven't put any function's there yet (or have I missed something?).

It's brilliant with joypadsupport, if youre thinking of putting any
function's on the remaining two buttons consider putting the automap
function on one of them since that would be very useful as well.

I suggest the following

This would make it simarlar to AB3d which a lot of us are used to.

In the long run perhaps you could let people set their own prefs.

ggreco@iol.it (Gabriele Greco) replies:

You can do it very simpy editing your .doomrc file, it's by default:

joyb_fire		0
joyb_strafe		1
joyb_use		3
joyb_speed		2

To archive your configuration your simply have to swap the use/speed/fire
buttons. Do not touch joyb_strafe since it's used in a tricky way.

You can't perfectly reach your desired configuration since I actually
use green to see last message as I've no time to look in the code for
a way to swap weapons (it's not as immediate as the rest of the
control since such a function doesn't exist in doom...)

if you are aware that the "<" and ">" keys in the original Doom and

problem I am having with playing ADoom is that the fire button is
nowhere near the sidestep keys. Both myself and a number of my
friends play doom (and its clones) with theright hand on the cursor
keys and the left hand performing sidestepping and firing. The
Amiga keyboard of course does not have the "ctrl" key at the bottom
right of the keyboard unlike PC's.
Here's the thing, could you cause the right amiga key to fire as

I know what it is... there are many build-in hotkeys in the Amiga OS

You may remember a while back I mailed you about a small problem
I had with changing the default joypad settings.
I edited the .doomrc file and when I loaded Adoom straight after
booting the new controls worked but when I used another program
before Adoom the controls reverted to default. I think i've found the
solution.

I have Adoom on my work:games , but when looking at my worbench
partition I noticed a .doomrc file  and I deleted it. All of a sudden
the new controls work after using another program (at least for one
go).
I look on my WB partition and that .doomrc files there again, so this
time I look at it and it's got the default controls. I edit it to my
new controls and now the problem has disapeared (at least for the
moment).
Should Adoom be putting another .doomrc file on my WB partition ?

Anyway hope this helps, I seem to remember you said it might be a
problem with the 'Home Variable'.

BTW i'd really, really like to configure that green joypad button if
you ever get a spare moment.

Many thanks, the BEST just keeps getting better and better.

I think that serial linking would be more of use than network linking,

Also, I've tried a 4-player network game (one PC and one Amiga share a

still playable, but the slower PC (still a P75) is sluggish. Of course,
the Mac is always sluggish.
When I quit the Mac version, the game becomes a lot more responsive, so
it is most likely that it is the Mac that is slowing things down.

I've downloaded ADoom 0.9 and played it versus my PC and Mac.
The frame rate does not drop below 6fps (on my A4000/060 on AGA, and
with mouse enabled, at two steps below maximum size, high detail) on a
Western-level called Boot Hill.
I don't see any significant slowdown with IPX networking compared to
non-networked ADoom. I think when I buy a graphics card, it will be even
better.
Right now, it's already quite playable. In fact, more playable than the
Mac! (which has a PowerPC 603e at 75MHz)

I like it so much, that I've just ordered another copy of DOOM2, to make
things legal.

I'm using PC DOOMII v1.9 and MacDOOMII. I've had to use -pcchecksum and
-forceversion 109 . And yes, ADoom bombs out at the end of DOOMII level
1 in co-op. Big deal.

(BTW: some friends said to me (for fun) I invented the Borg species in

I use Win95Doom (it is really great - could be played in 640x400, ...) -
again: 
Now in "IPX Connection to DOS or MAC Doom" Mode - it works for a while - seems
to me that Win95 is doing some rubbish - I will try it with DOS. Very Good
work ! 
I will keep up my testing work...

And I use 4 Amigas in a network (is this really a network???):
I connected 3 060 Amiga`s running ADoom via SLIP lines at 115200. All are
running AmiTCP and it works great on all machines ! We played for hours and
had a lot of fun I didn`t manage to connect the fourth Amiga - only a 030

Joseph Fenton <jlfenton@ctaz.com> (author of the MUS-play code)
writes:

The MUS player only uses two of the audio channels (0 and 1,
although the channel numbers can be changed).  That leaves
2 channels free for the SFX.  By having music on two and SFX
on the other two, the master volume is still controllable using
the channel volume in Paula.  You'll notice that I combine up
to 16 voices and use an arithmetic shift for fast volume scaling.
The bfffo (log2(x)) gives the shift so that the volume remains
linear. If you combine SFX, you use more processing power,
but can then use the sepeartion as the voice volume when
adding into the left or right buffer just as I use the instrument
channel volume to combine the instument voices in the MUS
player.  I don't use the panning in the MUS file because I never
saw a MUS score that used it, but it could be used to do seperate
left and right output.

If you don't combine SFX, you only have two instead of four
channels.  Not much of a tradeoff as many folks use lower counts
on the real DOOM for a speed up. Plus,  if the music is turned off,
you could go back to four channels again.

[about MIDI_Instruments]
They are the standard MIDI instruments and percussions by the way; we'll
also be trying to do a new file ourselves sometime.  One hint, do most
normal or high pitched instruments at 72 and low pitched instruments
(bass) at 60; they sound better that way because the 11K sample rate
limits how good you can get one end or the other.  Sampling at an
octave closer to where it wil NORMALLY be played makes the instrument
play back better.

[...]

If you look at the MIDI_Instruments.s file, it is a table of offsets to
the instruments; the instruments are:

	LONG Sample Rate in MIDI_Instruments, replaced by ptr to wave in player
	FIXED Loop Start (if non-zero) of instrument
	FIXED Length and Loop End of instrument
	BYTE Flags, 0 in MIDI_Instruments
	BYTE Note Base of sampled instrument, 60 = sampled at middle C, 72 =
	sampled at 1 octave above middle C.
	ARRAY OF BYTES Instrument wave data in Amiga raw format (8bit signed)

The sample rate should always be about 11050; if the instruments are
significantly off from that number, the note sampling table should be
altered to correct the deviation.

   advantage of stereo effects.

    Some ideas?:

 *  MIDIFiles sampled at 28kHz? That would sound a lot better. ;)

 *  Music frequency playback at 28kHz? 11kHz is pretty noisy.

  Just thought I'd let you know that the new MIDI files are indeed a
lot better than the old ones. There's an apparent waveform "clipping"
problem with some of the songs though. Also, when switching between
songs with the IDMUS cheat, eventually the songs start to sound like
they get transposed incorrectly. 

[...] even at 11kHz, the music sounds very good.
I even tried one of my favorite MUS PWADs, "30Tunes1.WAD". All in all, it
really, really sounds good. Once the slight occassional "popping" is removed
from the MUS player, it will be even better.

simple way to implement MIDI music in ADoom. At least according to the

nice way for implementing this and the PlayMF source code probably would
give useful hints about how it should be used. (I'm talking about playing
MIDI files with external MIDI devices here.)

Another thing is that maybe you should just start using AHI for sound
output. I tested ADescent (which is currently sloooow) and it had stereo
sound and it really did boost the atmosphere up. AFAIK AHI does all the
mixing for you so you don't have to get into that... Be quick though, I've
already solved the 3 first episodes in Ultimate Doom and the fourth is
half way done ;).

68060 PROBLEMS AND TIPS
------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Shaun F." <shaunf@box.net.au> writes:

I've found the following quirk when playing ADoom:

I have a blizzard 1260 68060 accelerator, and when using ADoom withOUT
having a fastexec patch (to place exec.library in FASTRAM, as the 1260
does not do this by itself), ADoom runs very very slow indeed.

Upon using FastExec or BlizzMagic's Fastexec feature, sysinfo reports
exec.library in fastram, and Adoom runs very fast and smooth. What's
the cause of this? Is ADoom VERY exec intense or something?

I was jsut thinking, many people with 1260's installed, with no
fastexec patch might find it unplayably slow.

[...]

I just read your docs in ADoom 0.5, and it says for 060 users,
FastExec dramatically increases the speed.  It actually seems to be
FastExec's "SSP to FastMem option" which affects the speed of
ADoom. FastExec is quite annoying, because it reboots the machine on
every cold startup. A much better solution is to use a program such as
MCP which has a SSP to FastMem option in it's processor prefs section,
and doesn't require rebooting on cold startups.

I'm sure there's other programs around which are simple commands that you can
add in your User-Startup or whatever that move the SuperVisor Stack to
FastMemory.
You can easily check if your SSP is in fastmem with a program like SYSspeed,
in it's System Configuration window. Look at the memory address of SSP:. 

[...]

It appears that with the latest versions of ADoom, it now runs fine on
a 68060 without any FastExec or SSP to fastram things installed. As a
big guess, it probably had something to do with emulation library
activity in the Supervisor Stack Pointer area. Anyone correct me if
I'm wrong, because I don't have much clue about programming :)

I have an A1200, with a 50Mhz 68060 Blizzard 1260 card, and 16 MB EDO FastRAM.

When running ADoom withOUT MCP's "SSP to FASTRAM" option, it's very very slow,
unplayably slow. However, if the Supervisor Stack is put into FASTRAM, ADoom
is very very smooth, the way it's meant to be. BlizzMagic and FastExec have
options to place SSP in fastram as well.

I never thought the SSP to fastram thing made such a huge difference, but it
certainly does with ADoom. What's the reason for this? People with 1260's not
running any SSP to fastram patches must find ADoom unplayably slow!

   If you need to run fastexec or similar program it is because you are
running a bad hack or program.  That is slowing something down!
   And I'm sorry to say the odds are it is MCP.  Even though this program
might work wonders for some people there are so many options in it that you
might have ticked one that really you shouldn't have.

I'm not sure, but it might have to do with how you use the teleport.  I
played around with it last night and here's what I think.  If you are
moving when you arrive at the receiving end of the teleport, it won't
crash.  If you arrive in the teleport and are standing still, it
crashes.  In others words, holding down a cursor key while teleporting
is okay.

This may or may not be the problem... when I tried it though it was
okay... might have been coincidence though.

    I took a quick look at the amiga_notes and noticed some mention of

    for( i = startlump ; i < numlumps ; i++, lump_p++, fileinfo++ )

    I have not run into this problem but I know the names are supposed to
be 0 padded. Any extraneous blanks will botch that test in the function
W_CheckNumForName(). Since it's possible that trailing blanks may be
intentional maybe add an option to check for it? Those who are
encountering problems can try the option. Are those with the problem
perhaps specifying the -shdev, -regdev or -comdev parameters without the
DEVMAPS"data_se" or "DEVMAPS"cdata directories?

  Well, I tried your newest version of ADoom. There seems
to be a problem with palette changes when you get items or take
damage. They don't look right, like some colors aren't updated
or the color change isn't synchronized with the screen.

  I wonder if changing the priority of the c2p routine
has something to do with this.

  Maybe you could add a tooltype to set the c2p routine?

Low detail!!! A lot slower indeed.

I finally found why your Excellant Doom port runs slower on my sys with P96
1.34a.  It's the rtg.library in LIBS:Picasso96/rtg.library.  I installed the
earlier version and it runs fine.  I guess it is a bug in the rtg.library. 
Maybe it is a 040 thing on my system, as I talked to others with 060's and
they say it works fine... I get a 060 this week, so I am anxious to see if
this problem will go away. Hopefully the next P96 rtg.lib will fix this. The
funny thing is other doom ports are unafected by this.

I have found the bug for Adoom with P96. In P96 you can specify a
Tooltype for the monitor file named SOFTSPRITE.
If it set to YES, a software emulated mouse pointer are there, like this
from amiga os. If NO is set, the mouse pointer comes from the graka, if
its possible. But this pointer looks ugly for me.
And Adoom runs if this Tooltype is set to NO. Thats not a real solution,
because i cant toggle this setting easyli, only a reboot changed that.
Your prog is the only one, i have problems with.

No, none of them. I have tried the new options mousepointer, rtg and

and jumps directly to the first level and the screen for choosing
difficulty. Or it quits immediately. I will be test it without
startup-sequence now.

Alexander Niven-Jenkins <anj@cremlinsoftware.org>

   I have v1.34a installed and I have a PicassoIV (v1.34 allows MYST to work),
ADoom works perfectly and has always done so on my machine.  Just incase there
is a problem with machines I have included the options I have on startup to
see if they work for other people:

      Icon tooltypes translated command line to:

         -forcedemo
         -music
         -mmu
         -rotatemap
         -maponhu
         -rtg
         -screenmode $50001000
         -cpu 68060

   Now with these options everything runs like dream.  I can only assume if
there are problem with Picasso96 that either there is a bug in one of the
other graphic card drivers or as usual they have some 'hack' installed or an
option in another program 'mcp?' turned on.
[...]
   You'll be glad to know that today P96 v1.35 was released and one of its
features is the fixed 'SOFTSPRITE' with writepixelarray etc.

   This therefore fixes the ADoom crashing problem.

I just thought I'd email you to tell you my experience with your very
excellent port of Doom.  I have tried ADoom versions 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6
on the the following setups: A3000 w/ A3640@25MHz, OS 3.1, 12MB Fast, 2MB Chip,
730MB Quantum SCSI HD, GVP Spectrum 28/24 & Picasso96 software
The second system is A4000 w/ GVP TRexx II 68060@50MHz, 32MB Fast, 2MB Chip,
OS 3.1, 2.1G SCSI-II drive, PicassoIV & Picasso96 software.

Amazingly, I am able to start up ADoom on both machines using the
shareware Doom1.wad and registered Doom2.wad files.  However,
on the A4000 setup, the machine locks up after a few minutes playing
and I need to do a complete reboot.  Needless to say, very frustrating.
This happens regardless of screenmode (i.e. native Amiga or Picasso96 RTG modes).
Do you have any idea what this is?  I suspect it has something to do
with the GVP 68060.library (version 1.2 BTW).  
[...]
Some good news to report.  I tried using ADoomv0.7 on my GVP 68060-equipped
A4000 (w/PicassoIV/P96 software) and it works much better.  I have a total
lockup only about every ten-fifteen minutes now using the registered doom2.wad
file, as opposed to every two-five minutes with v0.6.  Whatever you did with
v0.7, the 68060 seems to like it better, although it is still not perfect. 
The lockups still occur when you touch a wall or drop down a level.  This
could be a bug in the original Doom code which is not noticed on slower
machines such as 68040 or less.  When the lockups happen, there is usually a
noticeable split in the screen sprites, offsetting one frame from another.  I
also tried adjusting the tooltypes to use the Directcgx option but this didn't
seem to make a difference.  In any case, it is much more playable now that it
is useable for more than a few minutes.  Keep up the good work. - Jason Edmonds
[...]
More bad news.  Both versions 0.7 and 0.8 still crash after 10-15 minutes of
playing ADoom on my A4000/GVP-M 68060 machine.  I just downloaded v0.9 and
will give it a go.  I'll let you know when I am confident of a thorough test. 

BTW, I don't know if this is of any help but of all of the software I use on
this machine, only ADoom and IBrowse v1.12a (registered) seem to lock up the
Amiga.  I mean stone cold freezes.

Keep up the good work. Much appreciated. - Jason
[...]
I think I stumbled upon the problem.  I was having way too many crashes with
software so I installed FastIPrefs and bingo...no more lockups with ADoomv0.8.
 You might want to include this info for any Picasso96 users in your read.me
file in case it isn't already mentioned.  Man, that was frustrating but I just
successfully played Doom2 for 1/2 an hour with no problems.  Most satisfying. 
 Thanks for all of your help.  - Jason

BTW, my setup again for your records is an A4000 w/GVP TRexxII 68060 @50MHz,
40Megs Fast/2Chip, PicassoIV, 2.2G Samsung SCSI-II HD, OS 3.1,
Picasso96v1.34a, NewIcons4.1, MagicWB2.0, MUI3.8, Setpatch 43.6, and now
FastIPrefs.  
[...]
It apparently fixes a memory problem when displaying RTG screens under
Picasso96.  The old IPrefs program causes memory conflicts which lead to total
lockups, I reckon.  Oh well, it works now anyway.  Now, I just can't wait to
get Quake Amiga from Clickboom.  Thanks. - Jason

   My specs are : A1200, Apollo 1260@50mhz, 32 meg ram, Surf Squirrel,
3.4* CD-ROM, 28.8 modem 1.04 gig HD.

   I don't think the memory is at fault because it's fully used by
Lightwave.

   I run Executive, MCP, Oxypatcher, Magic Menu, Visual Prefs (These
are the only things I can think of that would influece the operation
at all.)

I've tried that and it doesn't seem to make much of a difference =/ It
still crashes at the same point.

    It seems that my memory is at fault (which is strange as LW doesn't
complain)  0.8 didn't work, the onlt port I've found that works is psidoom, 
but don't fear, I'll keep trying adoom with every release.

I downloaded your archive ADOOM-1.1.lha from Aminet and tried to run
it.  As in earlier versions, it openen a screen and waited for input.
So I pressed ESC and the menu popped up ... and that's about as far as
it will work. It doesn't crash my machine or anything, it just won't
work at all.

My configuration is: A 1200, Blizzard 030/50 Mhz, FPU 882, 18 MB (2
Chip + 16 Fast), 24x Toshiba ATAPI CD, AGA, 14' PAL Monitor (until
today and no longer !).  I start ADoom clicking on the icon (not
altered) or typing 'ADoom' from shell.

I now added the '-mouse' option to my commandline. I have the game
working now.

On the other hand, I have the same problem as with DoomAttack. When
picking up certain things, the game crashes. For example, there was a
MedKit-like box : the error was 'W_GetNumForName: dsgetpow not found'
and the game shut down. Same thing with those white armored dresses.

I already thought I could be my WAD-file (Registered V1.10).

 I have also tried it with the original '40 board, and without the Picasso.

Loaded from the CU disks and it works fine, so maybe I erred in the

I have no clue whether or not anyone will be foolish enough to port DOOM
to the Amiga.  I love the machine but can recognise its weaknesses.  It is
indeed impossible to make DOOM as it is known on the PC for the Amiga. 
Anyone doubting can ask their friendly neighbourhood games programmer.  I
know a few, so that's where my information comes from. :)  The texture
mapping and 3D routines are highly dependent on the availability of chunky
pixels.  Creating for conversion of chunky data to planar data will
produce far too slow a game - especially if anyone is thinking of a
full-screen offering.  2 friends have created routines far faster than the
ones posted here, available on Aminet and also made by Chris Green. 
Routines for mapping and also some routines for chunky conversion.  If you
will be happy with a slow game, then I am sure someone might be willing 
to provide you with one.  Pop a CD32 board with the Akiko into the A4000
and you now have some faster routines for conversion and a far more
suitable system for this type of game.  For true playability and that
Amiga charm though...  We'll have to wait for some Advanced Amiga
Architecture (AAA) options to become available.  Then if someone choses
you can have your DOOM+ :8^) (and really beat up on your VGA buddies)

On an A4000/040, the bottleneck for c2p conversion is writing to chip
RAM.  Whether you have an Akiko in your A4000/040 or not, c2p
conversion takes exactly the same time with the best algorithm.

We don't have to wait for AAA.  There are existing Amigas that would
run Doom just fine (if someone would port it).

On 15 Feb 1994, in response to the above message, freund@cis.uab.edu
(Jason Freund), the author of the rot3 texture mapping demo, wrote to
comp.sys.amiga.games:

[...]	I laugh whenever people compare processor speeds and conclude that
Wolf/DOOM could be done on a Mac or Amiga because the Mac and Amiga (both would
run a DOOM simulation at the same speed, incidentally) don't have the 1
critical thing that makes DOOM INHERENTLY ~8-10 times faster on the IBM than on
the Amiga: chunky pixels.  On the Mac/Amiga, for every pixel you need to 
do logical operations in each bitplane to read and write the pixel from/to
the appropriate byte in memory.  On the IBM, all these operations are done
at once because you can simply pick up a pixel and put it down in 1 move.
So at the innermost level (where 85% of the work is really done), the IBM
is inehrently at least 8 times faster.  

[...]	IMHO, DOOM is not possible -- not even close -- even on an 040.
Obviously, this will incite a lot of flames on this group, so let me qualify
this:  No existing Mac/Amiga will ever run DOOM as fast as a 286.  I am very
confident about this.  Wolf was barely possible since there were so many
limitations that happened to just barely fit in the Amiga's schemes.
DOOM does lots of things that could never be done using any chunky
pixel emulation scheme on the Amiga.  We might be able to pick up a few
tricks from DOOM that weren't in Wolf at very little speed loss, but 
some things are actually IMPOSSIBLE (floor, ceiling, outside).  Note:
IMPOSSIBLE means: Impossible to implement on Amiga and have it go as fast
as DOOM on 286.  And an even longer list of DOOM things would slow down an 
Amiga engine to make it intolerably slow.

On 3 Sep 1994, John Carmack <johnc@idcube.idsoftware.com>, the
original programmer of DOOM, wrote to George Sanderson
<G.Sanderson@ais.gu.edu.au>:

The amiga is not powerfull enough to run DOOM.  It takes the full
speed of a 68040 to play the game properly even if you have a chunky
pixel mode in hardware.  Having to convert to bit planes would kill
it even on the fastest amiga hardware, not to mention the effect it
would have on the majority of the amiga base.

When we started developing AB3D I spoke to id about the possibility of

AmiDoom!

They said that it was for so that they could be sure that the finished
product would be worthy of the Doom name. But to be honest, if we had
