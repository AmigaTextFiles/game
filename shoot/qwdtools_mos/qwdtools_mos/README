QWDtools for UNIX version 0.02 (c) Risto Sandvik 2003
http://www.helsinki.fi/~sandvik/qwdlinux

Based on QWDtools ver. 0.14b (c) 2001 Bartlomiej Rychtarski

This is the UNIX port of QWDtools! I hacked it up in a few hours, 
so don't get your hopes up :) 

FEATURES
--------

* Compiles under Linux
* Compiles under Digital UNIX V4.0F
* If it compiles under something else, please let me know :)
* Converts files from .qwd to .mvd
* Doesn't do much else :)

No .qwz support yet, but you can always convert them to .qwd
manually w/qizmo and run them through qwdtools after that.

Greets go out to Fuh for maintaining the Linux version of 
Fuhquake and to Bartlomiej Rychtarski for the original 
version of qwdtools!
