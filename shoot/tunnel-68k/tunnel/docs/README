Tunnel

Tunnel is a game in which you control a capsule going down a tunnel,
shooting other balls in the way.  Tunnel is free software released
under the GPL (see the file COPYING).  It is available at
http://tspiteri.org/tunnel/


Installing

You need to install the SDL and SDL_image libraries
(http://www.libsdl.org/).  Then the simple

./configure
make
(su to root)
make install

Or ./configure --prefix=/destination/directory where the destination
directory is some subdirectory of your home directory so that you do
not need root permissions.

You can also use the --enable-owndir option to ./configure so that all
of tunnel is installed into one directory.  Then you can move this
directory to anywhere after installation.  To run, though, you have to
change to the tunnel directory.


Hardware Requirements

It used to work fine on my Pentium 2 350 MHz.  If you are having speed
problems, edit the file <prefixdir>/share/tunnel/options and reduce
the resolution (width and height in the graphics record).  Or use the
command line options.  More information is available in the manual.


Running

The program name is tunnel.

Gameplay

See the manual in the doc directory.


Note

All graphics are created using the Gimp and Scheme.  The files *.scm
in the directory images are used to generate all graphics using the
Gimp version 1.2.  The method used to draw the balls was borrowed from
the Script-Fu/Misc/Sphere plugin in the gimp.
