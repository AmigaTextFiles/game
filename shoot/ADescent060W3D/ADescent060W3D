ADescent Warp3D version:
This archive contains the Warp3D version of ADescent. You *must* have a
working Warp3D installation to run it, if you havent, get the old
0.7 version instead, or wait for the v0.8 (comming, ah, soon).
Note that Warp3D also currently requires a CyberVision3D.
The requirements of the normal ADescent version still aply to this version.

YOU WILL NEED V1.5 HOG AND PIG FILES!!!
If you get the "Not enough strings" message, this means you have a wrong
version of the files. See the section "Obtaining the files" in the Guide file
for hints where you can get them. Please don't mail us, we can't provide them.
