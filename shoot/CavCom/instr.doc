Welcome to Cavern Commander...This game is a shootem-up
scroller, that I hope you enjoy. It took me about 4 weeks
to complete, working on it about 2-3 hours on most week 
days, but some days I worked on other projects. It is made 
with AMOS The Creator...On my AMIGA 600 and 1200.
-------------------------------------------------------

In CAVERN COMMANDER the inhabitants of a 5 level
underground cavern are in trouble... The defense system
has gone hay-wire... When supply ships try to deliver 
food to the inhabitants (creatures) of the cavern the
defense system destroys them, the creatures, men and 
animals are slowly starving.
You must rescue the creatures with your space ship,
while avoiding the cavern walls, the missiles, and
killer satellites, all the while you are picking up
(rescue) the creatures, you must constantly watch your
fuel meter....

Your ship can fire a missile in the direction you
are facing by pressing the fire buuton on the joystick.
You start with 2 ships, one you are currently using 
and one in reserve. 

To rescue creatures (men and animals), simply touch 
them with your ship. To get fuel, simply touch the fuel
tank with your ship. Be careful your ship doesn't run
out of fuel, crash into the cavern walls, or get to
far off the scrolling screen, or you will be killed.

You cannot advance to a higher level, if you haven't
rescued all of the creatures on the current level,
you will be forced to play the level over, into you
rescue all of the creatures....
