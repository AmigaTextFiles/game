THIS VERSION
============                                                 

V3.0 - Written in AMOS 1.3 - 8/6/98 (Totally re-written)    

So whats new in the latest version of this arcade classic?   

This game is getting a bit long in the tooth now but I still 
wasn't happy with it. The problem was mainly with the speed. 
The previous versions were playable on a bog standard A1200  
but when it came to an A500 it looked pretty pathetic. This  
version was written and compiled on an A500 so I could       
seriously optimize the code so that it would run at a decent 
frame rate. The result is that it now runs at a very         
impressive speed indeed. Other improvements include faster
collision detection, improved joystick detection, better
sound FX and a better screen display.                                                     


HOW TO PLAY
===========                                                  
                                                             
I don't really have to tell you do I?                                                         


CONTROLS
========                                                     

Joystick Left to move Left
Joystick Right to move Right
Joystick Fire to er, Fire                                    

In game keys are simply Esc to quit back to Workbench/DOS    


TECHY STUFF
===========

to all you 68k programmers out there who think AMOS is just
to slow then get a load of this:-

55 Blitter Objects, 8 Hardware Sprites and it runs in full
fram rate even on a standard A500.


A500 OWNERS                                                  
===========                                                  
                                                             
If you only have 512k in your A500 then the game will not work.
If you have a 1/2 Meg upgrade though, all will be fine.
                                                         
                                                             
Tested on A500 (1 Meg)                                       
          A500+                                              
          A600                                               
          A1200                                              
          A1200 + 030                                        
          A1200 + 040                                        
          A1200 + 060                                        
                                                             
060 owners may experience strange sound effects from time to
time.  This is no fault of mine, I think its due to the way AMOS
plays raw samples.  The actual game runs fine though.             


BUGS
====

There are a couple of small bugs in the game that I know about and
are associated with collision checks on the green bases.  Sometimes
a bomb or your missile won't detect the base properly and will
result in them passing straight through the base.  This vary rarely
happens though and doesn't spoil the playability of the game at all.
If you find any other bugs, please let me know and I will do my best
to correct them.


FUTURE UPDATES                                               
==============                                               
                                                             
Probably not, but then again if someone finds any bugs in the
game I will try and correct it.        
                                                             
                                                             
FINAL NOTE                                                   
==========

If you play this game alot then please don't forget to register as
this will ensure that I continue creating more games for our
beloved machine.  Lets face it, there is a serious lack of new
Amiga games out there and failure to support people like me will
only result in even less software than there allready is. So do the
decent thing and register.
              
I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do. You can forget   
your Tekkens, Quakes and Ridge Racers, this game has that all
important ingredient that those games lack...  Playability.

Enjoy,
        Kev.
