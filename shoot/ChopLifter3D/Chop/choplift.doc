   ----------------------------------------------------------------------



   This is my first real attempt on a game on the Amiga system,
   besides of the BBS door games like the Tetris one for my
   Trion BBS system.

   However on the Commodore 64 more then 10 years ago I have
   written small games like a moonlander.
   Also during that time I write little demos with fast polygons
   and sound.

   Since I had the Vic-20 I always wanted to write a 3D fligth
   sim kind of program. This is the first succesfull one :)

   Part of the reason I wrote this game is to get some experience
   in the writing of 3D games. So when the Amiga-II appears I could
   produce new software and games faster.
   A lot of the code used in this program I have developed earlier
   for other programs.

   Remember the old Choplifter game on the Commodore 64 ??
   This is sort of a 3D version.
   The objective of the game was (how I remember it) to fly
   over a border with a helicopter and pick up (rescue) people.
   You do this by simply landing near them, and they walk to
   the helicopter and jump in.

   The objective of this game is the same, however i've not
   spend much attention yet to things like inert mass, acceleration.
   Because with the frame rate on my machine that's not very
   usefull .. or even testable.
   So it is more sort of a heli flight-sim to benchmark
   your top of the range Amiga's :)




   Starting the program
   --------------------

   This program is written so it can be used on all classes
   of classic Amigas.


   On slower machines you can run it in a "wire-frame" mode
   with 16 colors on a 320x256 screen.

   Start with:    Game


   Or you try the "polygon" mode with 16 colors which is a fraction
   slower.

   Start with:    Game -P


   If you have a real fast machine you can try the "shaded polygon"
   mode in HAM6 on a 320x256 screen.

   Start with:    Game -T


   If you have a real fast machine you can try the "Dithered shaded polygon"
   mode in HAM6.

   Start with:    Game -T -D


   If you have a real fast machine you can try the "Dithered shaded polygon"
   mode in HAM6, where polygons are replaced with textures if they
   are available for the type of surface.

   Start with:    Game -T -D -U



   If the the HAM6 true color mode is to slow, you can replace
   the -T with -G to render in 16 grey scales instead of color.

   If you have an AGA machine you can add a -B flag to use
   HAM8 instead of HAM6.

   If you want HIRES in 16color, GREY or HAM8 mode add a -H flag.

   If you have a CyberGraphics board add a -C flag to use the
   24 bit color mode instead of the HAM6 mode.
   (Uses an 640x240 resolution with matching ratio)

   If you have a NTSC machine use the -N flag to reduce resolution
   from 256 to 200 and change the screen ratio.
   (or to speed up the program sligthly)

   You can also use flags to make a smaller window which should
   speed things up a bit.

   If you start the game with the 'startme' script sound is added.


   Note that only the Truecolor modes (HAM6 or better) use Z-buffering



   Game-Control
   ------------

   To control a helicopter you need to control 4-axis
   The collective to go up and down.
   The feet-pedals to turn.
   The stick to go forward/backward and sideways.

   However most people don't have 2 joysticks or feet-pedals
   so this game uses one stick for all axis.

   When the fire button is released the stick controls
   forward/backward and sideway motions.

   When the fire button is pressed the stick controls the
   other axis.
   Press the stick sideways to turn.
   Press the stick backward to go up.
   Press the stick forward to go down.

   To exit the program you have to press the left mouse button
   on port0 (or the joystick button if a stick is connected to port 0).



   Notes
   -----

   This program will run on all Amigas with Kickstart 2.04
   or higher, and an OCS chipset or better.

   This program is OS-friendly (except for the joystick read code)
   and should pose no problem with multitasking, except for
   using most of the CPU power.

   Note that there are no AGA or PPC modes at this moment.
   If you want me to add these you have to send me the Hardware
   to develop it on :)

   This program it merely a test version, there have no
   optimizations being done. Also my texture map code isn't
   to perfect.

   This program is developed on an Amiga 2000 Rev 4.3 with OCS
   An A2630 card with 25 Mhz 68030 and 4 MB of memory.
   Which gives about 3 frames a second in the slowest mode.

   PLEASE write me how fast it is on your setup.



   This program is Shareware, please send me US $10 if you
   like this program. 
   Remember that if you want me to develop games for the Amiga-II
   system then first I need an Amiga-II :)
