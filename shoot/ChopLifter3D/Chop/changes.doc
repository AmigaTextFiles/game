    V 0.18 -> 0.19


   -Switched color of two points of polygons which makes the
    whole screen look better. Except in some grey modes perhaps.
    Yes .. this could also be explained as a bug :)

   -Added a color mapped mode, which was basically the only missing
    draw mode.
    It converts 24 bits graphics to 16 color screens, which is
    the slowest mode yet :b
    Only added it because I needed it in another project, so I
    used the game as a test bed.

    The Grey and HAM modes are much faster because they don't
    have to check each color to see which one matched the
    wanted color the closest.

    Added a few dither modes to the color mapped mode to test
    how good they worked.
    One works better on textures the other beter one shades.
    The first one is the default one.

    Fixed unload in the sound handler, it wasn't "connected" yet.


    V 0.17 -> 0.18


   -Enhanced the truecolor blitter functions.
    Now textures and shaded polygones can be drawn over the edge of
    the screen with no problems or shading errors.
    However .. this slowed down the game a tiny bit.

    Which could easily be compensated by drawing a 5x5 grid instead of
    a 7x7 grid .. but it isn't nearly as nice to see because it is not
    entirely screen filling.

   -Made my own blit function for the 16 color mode.
    Now the polygones aren't cut of anymore at the end of the screen.
    They are build up line by line with the RectFill graphics lib
    command. However .. this this mode by a factor greater of 2.
    But it is still a lot faster as the shaded,textured modes.
    Also new things are possible cause you can color or dither
    per line.

    So now the game uses the whole screen without distorsions,
    (except for the wireframe mode)
    the other methode looked nice, but I geuss this looks better.


    V 0.16 -> 0.17


   -Made the windows of the heli object the same on both sides.

   -Compiled a 68030 version which was much faster as the generic version.
    More then  7% in grey shaded mode.
    More then 20% in color texture mode.
    More then 30% in grey texture mode.

    made a script to compile 68000, 68020, 68030, 68040 versions.

    I believe the 68020 and 68030 versions use a few commands that
    do more in the same time.
    For the 68040 the compiler places the commands also in a certain
    order so the program can be executed faster. The 68040 can
    execute a number of commands in parallel so you don't want
    commands after each other that needs the result from the
    previous command.

   -Written a little program to find out what CPU is in a machine

   -Changed the startme script which now checks the which CPU
    the machine has and starts the rigth executable.
    Also it does a very wild stab at which mode your computer
    can handle .. depending on what CPU you have and if the
    "libs:cybergraphics.library" file is found.

    Maybe not very realistic .. but usefull for people who
    don't read docs ;)

   -Added a -Y flag for test purposses so it runs only 10 frames.
    And the chopper flies straigth up.
    With this option I can see very accurately if the game has gotten
    faster.

   -Made a little "test" script that automatically measures the speed
    of the game in important modes and writes the results to "ram:a".

   -Changed the -A dither option to -D
    Changed the -D debug option to -X
    Changed the -H Ham8  option to -B
    Changed the -B Hires option to -H

   -Made the color differences for shading much larger so the
    graphics in 16 grey scale and HAM6 look much smoother.

   -Added code so the "grey" mode can be rendered in 8 bit
    instead of 24 bit memory arrays.
    Which not only needs less memory but also speeds the
    game up 30% in grey mode.
    Also a more accurate methode to make a grey tone from
    RGB can be used.
    However edges are still traced in color.

    Textures are converted to grey after they are loaded so they
    also take only a third of the space.
    Made fast grey texture map code.

    It is now reasonable fast on my OCS A2000 with 25 Mhz 68030

    It now does 0.683 frames a sec in grey dithered mode.
    (Which was 0.454 frames in V0.15 .. a 50 % increase)
    (game.030 -g -d -y -z)

    Or 1.057 frames a sec with the sligthly smaller screen.
    (Which was 0.754 frames in V0.15 .. a 40 % increase)
    (game.030 -g -d -y -z -s)

    It now does 0.620 frames a sec in grey textured dithered mode.
    (Which was 0.366 frames in V0.15 .. a 70 % increase)
    (game.030 -g -d -y -z -u)

    Added a little intro, well a big turning chopper with
    a little text over it.



    V 0.15 -> 0.16


   -added an Interlace flag, for fast machines.
    Need more then 512K chip memory if you want to use both the
    Interlace and the Hires flags.
    Just to be complete and to check out how it looks :)

   -Enhanced the fall back mode if a screen couldn't be opened.

   -Made the walls (objects) thicker, first the thickness was
    zero. So when you saw one vertically it could disappear.

   -Since the last change .. the distance travelled per frame is
    to large when the FPS is very low. So now the distance
    is limited to the distance per frame from the lost version
    when the FPS is low. So it reacts better with high and low
    Frames Per Second rates.

   -Made the game faster in grey and HAM modes with (1-20% ?)
    faster chuncky to planair and planair to chuncky conversion code.
    By replacing shifts by constants.

   -Made the GREY mode 20% faster by simpeler conversion code,
    it now first makes a grey value before doing the dithering
    stuff .. instead of doing the calculations on the RGB values.
    Which makes dithering a little smoothers, but very light grey
    gets satured very quickly. Fixed the saturation problem by
    taking the double green value and scale down a bit more.
    Still have the old code saved though.
    However .. drawing is still done in an RGB chuncky buffer.

   -Made "chuncky to plainer"/"planair to chuncky" code faster by not
    allocating a work chipmem buffer each time, which also
    makes it possible for the blitter to copy the buffer to the
    screen while the CPU works on the next screen.
    Might want to undo this, there is no measurable speed increase.

   -made the game 2-4% faster by optimizing conversion functions.

   -changed the cybergfx resolution to 320x240 I think.
    However with the interlace flag you can double the height
    With the hires flag you can double the Width.


    V 0.14 -> 0.15


   -Renamed some directories
    Added a samples directory

   -Written a sound handler
    Made a "startme" script to test run the game with "sound".

   -Changed the game so the speed is dependend on the time,
    not an equal distance between 2 frames. So the speed is
    now the same at every frame rate.
    However the code for accelaration is disabled at the
    moment. Because of low frame rate (3 fps).
    Or else it looks like nothing happens during a number
    of frames.


    V 0.13 -> 0.14


   -Tried to make the lines mode faster by drawing only 2 lines per
    square, you don't see them anyway because there is a sqaure
    next to every square. However the chopper got a bit mutilated.
    Didn't make much difference so I undid it.

   -Added a small window which is bigger as the mini window.
    It uses half of the screen. Which is 7/10 of the width and height.

   -In theory the grey mode can be sped up by using a "grey-map"
    instead of a "RGB-map" so only one third of the bytes have
    to be moved. But I don't think the grey mode has much
    future.

   -Changed the font to a fuzzy font or antialiased font.
    Fonts are now drawn with different shades of a certain
    color so you can't see the jagged edges anymore.
    Added characters a-z.

   -Made it possible to choose between lores and hires in
    the line/polygone mode instead of only hires.
    Which doubles the speed to 3 fps on my A2000/A2630.

   -Added double buffering to the 16 color modes.

   -Fixed grayscales in HAM8 mode, which where to dark, And dithering.

   -Made a loop in cybergfx mode to get refresh messages.


    V 0.12 -> V 0.13


   -Changed the methodes of clearing buffers to speed things up.

   -Added a couple of modes with 1/3 1/4 of the screen size (width not area).
    Note that there already was a 1/2 size mode.

   -Doubled the speed of shaded polygons by replacing multiplys with adds.

   -Doubled the speed of texture mapping.

   -Increased speed by removing CLEAR MEM flags in Memory allocate
    calls in Render functions.

   -Color number 255 of the palette was not set in the HAM8 mode.

   -HAM8 didn't work right, hopefully that is fixed.
      I read in text files that plane 1 and 2 are modify planes.
      Later in an old magazine I read plane 7 and 8 are modify planes,
      Which couldn't explain the colors of previous versions.
	
   -Changed the CyberGfx code a bit.

   -Added code to report the number of frames per second rendered.

    Speed of this version on a REV 4 A2000 + A2630  (test script)


640x240 4p Lines

 Frames per sec:    1.582

640x240 4p Polygones

 Frames per sec:    1.506

160x120 4p Polygones

 Frames per sec:    1.919

320x240 4p Grey shaded ditherd

 Frames per sec:    0.347

640x240 4p Grey shaded ditherd

 Frames per sec:    0.139

160x120 4p Grey shaded ditherd

 Frames per sec:    0.967

320x240 6p True color textures shaded dith.

 Frames per sec:    0.279



    V 0.11 -> V 0.12


   -Fixed screen offsets in different modes.

   -The system now only uses the visible part in mini window
    mode. Which uses much less memory and CPU cycles.

   -Enhanced grey dithering


    V 0.10 -> V 0.11


   -Fixed a bug in the HAM8 conversion
    I did something silly, I used data in non-dithering mode
    that was only produced in dithered mode.
    Don't know if it is now fully functional, because I have no HAM8 mode.

   -Fixed a hires problem.
    Forget to change a value 320 in a width variable.
    So in Hires you got wrapped picture.

   -Added a "true color" mode with 16 grey scales, which should be
    the fastest true color mode. However it takes more time to render
    the screen then to convert it to grey or HAM, so there is
    not much noticeable speed gain.

   -Added a flag to make hires in grey and HAM8 mode optionial.



    V 0.09 -> V 0.10


   -Made new textures.
    I made a little error in DPaintIV, so all old textures
    had a black beam on the top where the title bar was.

    Edited couple of object files.
    Because textured walls where upside down.
    White lines on the road where not always visible.
    Changed proportion of people sligthly.

    Filled the map a little more.

   -If you didn't used the -T (Truecolor) flag with the
    HAM8 or CyberGrafics mode things went wrong.
    So now it sets the flag internally.

   -I assumed HAM8 was pretty much the same as HAM6.
    Just found out that they differ a lot because
    the control bits lay on the other side of the
    color value.
    Optimized the RGB->HAM code a bit, split up the code in
    HAM6 and HAM8 versions.

   -Made score printing a little faster by doing nothing when
    a space is detected.

   -Speeded things up a little by integrating the RGB plot function
    code in Polygon functions.
