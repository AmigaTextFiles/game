3 minutes into the future...Noel is the proud owner of the mighty Noel P. Davies Esq. EVIL company:-
A pleasure to take money away from you. He use underhand dealings to earn more power and more money.
And the hero of this game happens to work for them. I never said you were working for good guys...

Matthew arrives by foot to the towering skyscraper that can be seen for miles (oddly, no matter which
way you're facing you can still see it). Matthew pushes the revolving door too hard and spins around
in it accidentally, trapping several obese people. Never mind. Undaunted, Matthew carries on. To his
dismay the coffee machine still refuses to work. "I NEED CAFFEINE!" Matthew screams. Calming himself
down (actually, someone just knocked him out with a handbag), Matthew walks casually to the lift. Too
casually in fact, as he knocks over a pot plant and hilariously falls over. Now with his newly soiled
trousers (for want of a better word) he glides to the lift only to find the lift is naturally out of
order (you're not bored yet are you?).

16 minutes later

After running up 37 flights of stairs, Matthew eventually (thank God) reaches the door of the head of
the company, Noel P. Davies Esq. (the "e" is silent).

"Come in."

Matthew opens the door and strides up to the silhouetted figure.

"I trust your last mission went well, fighting the poisoned monkeys in Rangoon and Zanzibar."
Noel suavely purrs in a very English accent (not that this is his real voice, natch).

"Yes. Yes it did."

"Good. I have 3 more missions for you. You will get paid £7.99 for completing all of them."

"Woohoo!"

"You are to go to Skegness and destroy the malfunctioned toy factory."

"OK."

So Matthew catches the next taxi to Skegness. Here we go.

@node Can_I?

This marvellous 10 level demo requires an A1200 to really function properly. An accelerated Amiga
would be a superb idea, though not too accelerated. Don't expect it, for example, to work on a 20Ghz PPC
 (would be nice, wouldn't it?) with WarpUp or something like that.
 I have not tested this game on anything other than an A1200 '030/50 MHz. It works fine on this. 
 Play the demo and judge for yourself how quick it is. If it's too fast, try disabling the CPU caches or something.
 You will also require a joypad, and a massive 1.5 MB to install onto the hard drive. 
Provided you haven't eaten up the rest of your hard drive by installing Genetic Species or something.

@node Instructions

Standard controls apply. Experiment with the three guns that are available. Only one can be fired in
mid-air.

Special things:-

1. Indestructaball- these cannot be destroyed. Simply avoid.

2. The mysterious duck- When you touch these, odd things can occur. A block may suddenly disappear
nearby or you can be teleported. Sometimes you need to press "Space" to enable the effect.

3. The red eeeeeevil face- these don't appear to do any harm. Try destroying them to see what
happens.

4. Spikes- all hurt, some more than others.

5. Flaming pit- This does not really help you on your quest. Kills you quicker than you can say
"Ginger Flavoured Crisps".

@node Uh_Oh

Not to worry here. I am not responsible for any mutants, house fires, bugs that leap out of the
screen and tickle you or any other viruses that can put you to bed.

Everthing but the programming language, the actual computer and the modules were created by me.
The programming language was created by Alastair Murray (a groovy bloke), the modules are PD and were
created by people who aren't tone deaf. The computer was designed by evil robots threatening world
domination.

Software is provided "AS-IS"(tm) . No warranties, no reponsibility etc.

@node Thankyou_For_Making_This_Possible...

Thanks to:-

Alastair Murray       (Creating the programming language "Backbone", and eventually
                             producing one version which actually worked for me)
Emilio Perez             (Showed that decent games can be created on Backbone. Play Statoscuro after this!)
Matthew Houlsby        (Though I have to give him 1% royalties on each copy sold)
Lumb                      (Appears in the game as an evil green-haired red eyed thing. 
                            I'm giving him 0.5% royalties on every copy sold, except now he's
                            going to a different 6th form school I don't have to anymore. 
                            Hooray!)
Chi                        (starring as the monkey. Groovy guy.)
Paul                       (starring as himself. Perhaps groovier than some other people think. Yeah.)
Noel P. Davies Esq.     (now he is only mentioned in text. Because I can't draw him. Until now. Months later)
Family                    (Bringing me up)
Me                         (Self-indulgement. Well, I did do the graphics, playtesting, level design...)
Amiga                     (Decent computer, I guess. It still feels faster than using Windows on a 233Mhz PC)
CrossDos                 (If I don't sell well on one platform, UAE and CrossDos can help... if I knew how)

@node Now_Then_Now_Then

Sometimes Matthew refuses to fire, other times he's trigger happy. I don't know what causes this at all.
Matthew's eyebrows are transparent.
It may or may not work on your system. This is because Backbone kind of ceased development in 1998. 
That doesn't mean it's crud or anything. Au contraire.* It really is great. 

Don't think there's anything else.

* I get a GCSE "A" in French. For what? Adding "Au Contraire" to the end of a sentence?
 Of the 1000 words or so I learnt for the exam, do I only remember about 50 now? Well, yes. 
I did my French GCSE oral on this game. Did you know that? No, of course you couldn't know.

Future
~~~~~~

Well, if the game sells well (I'm still waiting!), a sequel could very well occur. A port to the AmigaONE 
(though I'm still not entirely sure what that is...) could happen. However, Mr A-Levels loom. Ah well... 
I did groovy in the GCSE exams. Though how I could get a "B" in Geography is anyone's guess
 
(possibly because I let it be known not altogether subtlely that, for the Geography coursework,
 3 hours of trudging around Wrexham counting buildings and naming their type all to locate the
 centre of the CBD in on-off showery weather as NOT BEING A FUN IDEA AT ALL).

Hello Emilio. How's the ol' Deathbird?
