HOI HAS PROVEN TO SHOW SOME STRANGE BEHAVIOUR ON AN ACCELERATED A.G.A.
MACHINE AT CERTAIN SPOTS (STARTING WITH A 68030 CPU), BUT THIS WILL NOT
AFFECT THE GAMEPLAY OR CAUSE THE GAME TO CRASH.

           THE GAME THAT STARTED IT ALL, YEARS AGO...!

YES, INDEED... IF YOU KNOW OUR HOI SAGA DEMOES AND WONDERED ABOUT THE
ORIGIN OF OUR NAME, HERE IS THE EXPLANATION...

IN SEPTEMBER 1990 METIN CREATED A CUTE, GREEN CHARACTER AND CALLED HIM HOI.
HOI WOULD BECOME THE STAR OF A PLATFORM GAME BEARING HIS OWN NAME. RHINO
AND METIN DESIGNED THE GAME, RHINO PROGRAMMED IT, METIN PAINTED AND
ANIMATED THE GRAPHICS AND, LAST BUT NOT LEAST, RAMON TOOK CARE OF THE
MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT.

IN THE SPRING OF 1991 (BACK WHEN SONIC THE HEDGEHOG WAS NOT YET INTRODUCED
TO THE PUBLIC) THE ROUGH, NON-TWEAKED VERSIONS OF THE FIRST THREE LEVELS
WERE FINISHED AND WE MADE A HUMBLE DEMO VERSION TO SEND TO THE COMPANIES.
THE AMERICAN INNERPRISE SOFTWARE (FORMERLY KNOWN AS DISCOVERY SOFTWARE)
REPLIED AND A DEAL WAS BORN. THEY ASKED FOR THE EARLY VERSIONS OF THE THREE
LEVELS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THEM. NOT LONG AFTER WE SENT THE DISC, IT
APPEARED IN THE PIRATE CIRCUITS, CRACKED BY FAIRLIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS, THE
WORLD RECEIVED MONTHS OF HARD WORK (MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE COMPLETE
GAME) FOR FREE. NOT EVEN ONE OF US WAS MENTIONED IN THE INTRO, JUST
INNERPRISE. AFTER THIS DISILLUSIONMENT WE TERMINATED THE CONTRACT AND MOVED
OVER TO THE NEXT INTERESTED COMPANY (IN THE U.S.A. AS WELL):
MICRO-ILLUSIONS.

MICRO-ILLUSIONS TURNED OUT TO BE ALMOST AS UNRELIABLE AS INNERPRISE,
UNNECESSARILY DELAYING THE PROJECT FOR MUCH TOO LONG WHILE KEEPING US ON A
STRING WITH A LOT OF SMOOTH TALK. FINALLY, THEY MANAGED TO RELEASE THE GAME
AND IT GOT SOME QUITE FLATTERING REVIEWS AROUND THE WORLD: THE ENGLISH
MAGAZINE "THE ONE" AWARDED HOI WITH AN OVERALL RATING OF 90 PERCENT, THE
ENGLISH MAGAZINE "AMIGA MANIA" GAVE IT 87 PERCENT AND THE FRENCH MAGAZINE
"JOYSTICK" DECIDED IT DESERVED 86 PERCENT. A TREMENDOUS MENTAL REWARD FOR
MORE THAN A YEAR OF DEDICATION AND HOPE. TOO BAD MICRO-ILLUSIONS SUDDENLY
DECIDED TO CHANGE THEIR NAME INTO HOLLYWARE AND THE SIGNED CONTRACT TURNED
OUT TO BE FULL OF HAZARDS. RESULT: THE ONLY PROCEEDS WE HAVE EVER RECEIVED
FROM HOLLYWARE IS A STAGGERING $ 500...!

A SAD ENDING? WELL, FINANCIALLY IT WAS, BUT WE DID HAVE A LOT OF FUN
CREATING THE GAME AND READING THE REVIEWS. IF YOU ARE WIPING AWAY A TEAR AT
THIS MOMENT AND/OR IF YOU REALLY LIKE HOI, YOU CAN PROVE YOUR APPRECIATION
BY FUNDING TEAM HOI. IF YOU DO SO, YOU WILL BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
REALIZATION OF OUR FUTURE PROJECTS (LIKE OUR A.G.A. SEQUEL TO HOI...!) AND
WE WILL SURELY SEND OUR THANKS TO YOU IN THESE FUTURE CREATIONS.

OUR DUTCH BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER IS 3917.18.509 (R. V. VLIET, RABOBANK
HOLLAND). THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED IN ADVANCE, FELLOW AMIGA FREAK AND WE
HOPE YOU HAVE A LOT OF FUN WITH THE GAME (IF YOU DO NOT SEND US MONEY, HAVE
FUN AS WELL)!

BEST REGARDS,

TEAM HOI

P.S.: IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN MEET US AT THE BIG PARTY IN DENMARK AT THE END OF
THIS YEAR (1993). WE HOPE TO SEE YOU THERE!
