S U P E R   M E T H A N E   B R O T H E R S   -   A M I G A O S   4 .0  

The linux version of Super Methane Brothers use Allegro and libMikMod for 
video and sound. However I found out that the GP2X version uses SDL instead
of Allegro thus making it portable to AmigaOS 4.0, so I modified the GP2X
sources to suit AmigaOS and compiled it. Unfortunately libMIKMOD ain't 
ported to AmigaOS 4.0 yet, so there is no sound in this version :( but
it's a VERY nice port as it's done by the original Amiga coder of the game.
Consider this my official cry for a port of libMIKMOD to AmigaOS 4.0! :D
This game rocks!
