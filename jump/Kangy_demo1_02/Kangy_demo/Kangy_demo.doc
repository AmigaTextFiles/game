   Introduction
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Kangy is a platform game in which you have to guide a kangaroo and
   collect all the fruits in each round.


   System requirements
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Any PAL Amiga with 1 Mb of memory (at least 512 Kb of Chip).


   Installation
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Just copy the following files to any directory of your choice:

      Kangy_demo
      Kangy-TopScores
      Kangy_demo.doc
      Kangy_demo.doc.info
      StartKangy_demo
      StartKangy_demo.info

   If you delete the Kangy-TopScores file, the top scores table will be
   cleared.

   In case you want to create a bootable floppy disk, copy all the files
   from this archive to a disk labelled Kangy_demo and install it.


   Usage
   ¯¯¯¯¯
   To run the game open a CLI/Shell window, enter the Kangy_demo directory,
   type in 'Kangy_demo' and press the Enter key. It can also be started by
   double-clicking the StartKangy_demo icon.
   During the title move the arrow next to Play and push the joystick to the
   right and to the left to select the difficulty level. You can choose
   among Easy, Normal and Hard.
   You can use the keyboard instead of the joystick at any time. Use the
   cursor keys as directional keys and press the Right-Shift as fire
   button.
   While playing you can press the M key to switch the music on/off, the F
   key to switch all the sound effects on/off, and the J key to switch the
   kangy boing sound effect on/off.
   The in-game information bar displays the following:

      L:05  R:01  SCORE:0000000  F:N/5  T:99
         ^     ^           ^       ^ ^     ^
         |     |           |       | |     |
         |     |   Points -+       | |     +- Time remaining
         |     |                   | |
         |     +- Round number     | +- Number of fruits to be put away
         |                         |
         +- Number of lives        +- Indicates if you have
                                      a fruit (N=No, Y=Yes)

   Every level passed (5 rounds) you will obtain a password allowing you to
   start playing from that level the next time.
   You will find detailed instructions on how to play within the game.
