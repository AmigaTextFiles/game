                                  SYNOPSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program attempts to simulate, as accurately as possible, one of the most
fascinating stages in the life-cycle of the Australian Cane Toad. As everyone
knows, the eggs of the Cane Toad are laid within the carcasses of dead sheep.
In this nutrient-rich environment the tadpoles quickly mature, and soon there
are a multitude of young toads ready to begin their famous migration to the
nearest creek or river bed.  This journey frequently takes them across busy
roads, and rivers whose erratic currents and high toxicity defy the bulky
toad's best attempts at swimming.


                                INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try playing the game.  If you still need instructions, send an extra $50 with
your shareware fee, and I'll spell it all out for you.  Don't forget to
include your name and address.


                                RAVE REVIEWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read what these popular Amiga magazines had to say about the original Croak:

*  "Yes, it's Frogger!  And not just any old Frogger.  We reckon it's the
    best Amiga version of the classic arcade game yet."

   "As the levels progress the cars get faster, special bonuses appear (leap
    on the flies to swallow them up, but don't mistake the spider for one)
    and... oh, it just gets more and more fun.  And don't forget the time
    limit!  You know what to do!  Go to it!"

    - The One, September 1992

*  "It's so very easy in theory, and so finicky in practice.  Hopping your
    frog across the road and over the river, that is.  It's so infuriating to
    get all the way across and then miss the hole!"

    - Amiga Format, June 1992

*  "Apart from the fact that it's flawlessly programmed, the best thing about
    Croak is the simultaneous two-player mode, that transforms the game into
    a vicious contest for homes and bonuses."

    - Australian Commodore & Amiga Review, January 1994

*  "Everyone loves a good Frogger clone!"

   - Amiga CD32 Gamer, October 1994


                      EXCITING NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*  NTSC COMPATIBILITY.  Croak II will open a cropped screen with a mild
   overscan on an American machine.  PAL users still get the full 256 lines.

   Note: if for some reason Croak fails to detect an NTSC machine, NTSC mode
         can be forced by adding "N" as a command-line parameter (ie: run
         Croak by typing "CROAK N").  PAL mode can be forced with "CROAK P".

*  KEYBOARD CONTROL.  Several combinations of joystick and keyboard control
   for the two player game are selectable on the title screen.  In a one frog
   game, all control options are available simultaneously.

*  MAGIC BUTTERFLIES.  These occasionally flutter down the screen, and do
   strange things when caught.  You will have to experiment to find out which
   colour butterfly does what (there are a couple of nasty ones).

*  You can elect to begin the game on any of the first four levels.

*  The two player game has been revamped into a more fun sudden-death format.
   When one frog is completely dead, the game continues only until the second
   player has beaten his score, or dies also.

*  Improved entry of names into the high score table.

*  Blood now smears realistically.


                         IMPROVEMENTS AND BUG FIXES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*  PROPER TIMING.  The game now runs at the same speed on all machines (Croak
   used to be quite tricky to play on an Amiga 4000!)  Users of accelerated
   machines benefit from smoother updating.

*  FLICKER FIXED.  Flicker on the road and river has been largely eliminated.

*  Now uses a proper Amiga screen, so can be easily multi-tasked.

*  Gameplay has been overhauled.

*  The pointless two-player high score table, and the subliminal message
   regarding Kate Bush, have been removed.
