                     The ELF Sprite Programming Language 
                             for EGA Life Forms
                         as described by Linus Sphinx

A text file of, "elf", is used to describe and, "cut up", a bitmap. The two files are
combined at runtime to produce a video game or simulation and allow for easy adjustment of
animation sequences, solid surface simulation, sound linking and chaining of events without
recompiling the interpeter.

Elf consists of the letters, "eqsfr", pound sign, forward slash, numbers, colons and commas 
arranged as:

#:numberofspritesinthisfile,maxyrows,maxxcols,numberof_floorsinthisfile
e:mapX,mapY,layerZ,opaque,type,framecount,direction,speed,flipspeed,timetolive,sound,palette
q:frameleft,frametop,frameright,framebottom
q:frameleft,frametop,frameright,framebottom
q:frameleft,frametop,frameright,framebottom
s:count:xincrement,yincrement
f:mapx,mapy,length

commands are
        # - count of actual sprites including all steps and elfs max_x, max_y, total floors
        e - elf/sprite
        q - source quadrangle one for each framecount in elf command
        s - step - repeat for count times of x and y increments
        f - floor - a line forming a solid walking surface
        // - rest of line is a comment
        
        not yet implemented:
        r - rotate source quadrangle x degrees 
            
commands should be in the order shown if only for your own sanity
the count command comes first in the file and appears only once
elf speed is the number of pixels to jump, flipspeed is the number of page flips between frame
changes
direction is in the number according to the keypad, 5 is standing still
framecount source quadrangles must follow each elf
a step must be preceded by an elf/quadrangles combination, starts where it's elf was and repeats
at +x and +y intervals creating elfs in mass with all properties equal except x and y values.
player/tank sprites use mapX and mapY as plus or minus the player x and y and layer 5.
layers are 0 to 9 with 0 representing the background, missles are layer 6, foreground layer 9.
sound is a value referencing the line number starting at the second wave command in the 
wav/racket.txt file - 0 = no sound (0 is the background music)
palette is 0 normal 1 red 2 green 3 blue non zero only valid for type 5 tanks
