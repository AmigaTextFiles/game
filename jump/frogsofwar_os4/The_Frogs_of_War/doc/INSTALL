un-tar the archive file as in:
	tar xvfz fow-X.Y-tar.gz

this will create the main program directory - this is where the frogs executable goes: 

	frogs/ - frogs compiled binary here

and beneath that:

	frogs/bmp - images and .elf files here
	frogs/wav - sounds and .elf file here
	frogs/doc - robot files, help and docs here
	frogs/src - source code and make file here

There is a pre-compiled binary there just cd /frogs and run ./frogs for command line help.
If that should fail to find your libraries for whatever distro you're running, you can 
make sure the program sdl-config that comes with libSDL is in your path, change to the 
frogs/src directory and execute:

#start fresh
make clean

#build the program
make

#put it in the right spot
cp frogs ..

#go there
cd .. 

# test
./frogs
