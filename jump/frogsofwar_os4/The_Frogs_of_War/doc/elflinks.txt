Elf Linkages Portion Of The Elf Sprite Description Language
               as specified by Linus Sphinx
linkages.txt in the bitmap directory contains the links between sprites that make up an
elf. An elf consists of three sprites each representing the birth, life and death of the
elf. The sprite numbers are from the tank.txt file and the elf number is merely unique
to the other elves as in:
<elf id>:<birth>,<life>,<death>
2:34,2,3
3:3,4,5
elves may share sprites just as sprites may share frames. Tank.txt describes sprites, 
linkages.txt describes the sprites change from one to another as the sprite representing
each phase's time-to-live expires.
