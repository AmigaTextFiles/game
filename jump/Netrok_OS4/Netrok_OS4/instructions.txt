Move Netrok with CURSOR-KEYS, 
jump with ALT, run with CTRL.

Place your level jump'in flag with DELETE. 
From this position you can replay the level 
if Netrok dies. You cannot redeploy
this flag within the same level, so think where 
to place it.

Change shield with CURSOR-KEYS of the Numeric 
Block. Select first the shield you want to 
move, and then the position where to move 
it to. Collect 20 red shield power coins to 
get a new shield.

Kill enemies by jumping on them or simply 
running in them. But look for the position of 
theire prickles. You can kill an enemy from
the side where he has his prickles only with the
blue west from the blue button by running in 
him or with the special red shoes, which allows 
to jump on the prickles.
Netrok cannot beaten the big prickles, so try
to avoid them.

Everything what makes playing the game 
easier, costs you score! E.g. changing
shields, dropping jump`in flag etc. 
On the other hand, you get score if you
beat the level in shorter time or kill enemies..
For every 5000 points score you get 1 UP.

Good luck and have fun!
