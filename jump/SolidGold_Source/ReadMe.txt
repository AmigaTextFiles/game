About:
------

SOLID GOLD is a Jump'n Run with 8-way soft scrolling. It's written for the
classic Amiga hardware and designed in the style of the early 90s.

The game features ten levels spanning four worlds, with different graphics 
and enemies. Each level's goal is to find an artefact which will lead the 
way to the next world.

System Requirements:
--------------------

Any OCS-PAL or ECS/AGA Amiga with a minimum of 1 MB RAM (512K Chip RAM
required) will do. The game will also run on high-end Amigas but does
not make full use of their capabilities. It also works on Minimig and
emulators.

Minimum OS version: Kickstart 1.2.

Boots and works from any disk drive.


Versions:
---------

V1.0 31-Dec-2013: First releaese.


Story:
------

You are John Kayle, an adventurer and archeologist, trying to recover 
important artefacts in four different places of the world, competing
with a mysterious secret society.

More information is provided by the in-game introduction sequence.


Control:
--------

The game is played with a joystick in the second port. Recommended is a
Competition Pro like input device, but also game pads are supported,
including their secondary fire button.

Running left: joystick left
Running right: joystick right
Jumping: joystick up (or secondary button)

You can control the hero in mid-air while jumping by moving the joystick
left or right.

The first button (the only button on typical Amiga joysticks) is only used
in the menu and to start the game.


Scoring points:
---------------

Most enemies can be killed by jumping onto them. It is important to hit
them from above. Touching an enemy's side or contact from below are lethal
for the hero.

Killing an additional enemy without touching ground will double the
score for the kill.

After collecting 50 gems of any kind you will be granted an extra life.

Each level is concluded by a statistics screen. It will display the number 
of collected items and killed enemies, opposed to total numbers. Upon 
reaching the maximum possible numbers, an extra bonus is granted.
