     System Requirements
     -------------------                                        
                                                                  
     Any Amiga with at least Kickstart2.0, and we believe you need at
     least 1 meg chip.                                       
     We have tested BountyHunter on Amiga 500+, Amiga 1200/030 OS3.1,
     Amiga 4000/060 Cybervision, Amiga 4000/030, Amiga 2000.
                                                       
     How to install

     Move the directory where you want it. Make sure the files
     level1.dat and level2.dat are in the same directory as the
     executable (Bountyhunter).                    
     
     About the demo
     --------------
     
     This demo is a classic Jump`n`Shoot`em`up where you guide the
     Bounty Hunter (as you haven`t guessed already) through the
     dangerous levels in the chase after Morgan Schinowski, A.K.A
     "Wild Morgan", and the "Thermo-Flux-Time-and-Space-Warping-
     Device ©" that he has stolen.
     
     This game is a tribute to all of you who sat there, ten years ago,
     struggling through all the rooms in JetSetWilly, or swore at the
     fourth room in Henry's House. Shortly said, Those jumpies where
     the pixels made the difference between life or death. If you did
     not stand exactly right and timed your jump extremely well, it
     was back to the starting point.
     
     Now, The jumpies nowadays can be pretty good, but they don't
     have the same feel as the good oldies did, mainly because they
     base their playability on action, not timing.
     
     Therefore, we have tried to include a bit of them both for this
     little demo, and we really hope you'll enjoy it.
     
     We sure know we do.
