     We take no responsibility for whatever Hiccups this game may 
     do to your system. There isn't a way that it should do so since
     we both have our computers nice and proper, but anyway, everybody
     else are having these texts in their doc:s, and we just wanna 
     follow standard procedures.

     -------------------

     Any Amiga with at least Kickstart2.0, and we believe you need at
     least 1 meg chip.
     We have tested BountyHunter on Amiga 500+, Amiga 1200/030 OS3.1,

     Feedware
     --------

     This demo is feedware. It means that we're not so
     fond of spending our sparetime in making games noone will play.
     So, if you enjoy this demo, and you'd like to play the complete
     game, just send us some feedback on E-mail, snailmail or on 
     the phone or whatever. (and if you really, really HAVE to
     send us some money as well, we will have the good grace just
     to accept it). Then, if we get enough feedback so that we
     think there really is an idea to continue with the game
     (we have some levelscetches that are really hard-work-put-
     togehtering to do) we'll complete it and send it out on Aminet,
     and everywhere else where you can get it. If we get a thousand
     feedbackers we make a doom-type-of game out of it:-).

     Now, if you paid for this demo alone, you should consider sueing
     the one who sold you the copy.

     If you bought it through a PD-library and you only paid for 
     the disk we think it's OK. If, however, you paid more than 
     that, we think you should sue the people involved in the fraud.

     The point we try to make is that this is a non-profit game and
     since we don't get any profit, you shouldn't give someone else
     your profit for it either....

     If you'd like to use this demo on a Coverdisk to a Magazine,
     you're welcome, and we would appreciate if you sent us a copy
     so we could show off to all our friends...

     **************************************************************

                              
     Feedbackform
     ------------

     For the more comfortable feebacker, we have provided you
     with a form where you just have to fill in the details
     and send to us. Now, if you are the creative type and 
     want to improvise on this part, you are welcome to do 
     just that.

     For the very, VERY, comfortable feedbacker, we got a
     short version.

     The Story So far:
     -----------------

     Police-Constable Norbert mopped his sweaty forehead with a
     handkerchief and stared at the radio, not believing what he
     just had heard. For almost two hours he had surrounded the
     building where he was totally sure that the newly escaped and
     extremely dangerous villain Morgan Schinowski, A.K.A "Wild Morgan"
     had taken his refuge. Just as Norbert had glimpsed a movement in
     one of the windows and been on the verge to call out a "total 
     storm and kill everything on sight"-order, the radio had called.
     The one on the other side of the radio was the boss, shouting
     uncomfortably loud for one being supposed to have had two heart 
     attacks at the age of fifty, and much of the shouting was about
     Norbert NOT storming the building. There were also something
     about a "Thermo-Flux-Time-and-Space-Warping-Device ©", a machine 
     making it possible to travel in time, and about "Wild Morgan"
     now being the owner of the device and of the consequences being
     very dire indeed if a low-life police-constable Norbert blew this
     delicate situation up with a wrong move. 

     But that wasn't all...There had been some mentioning about 
     HIM as well... You never wanted to be there when HE was around... 
     The last time he had "fixed" a situation the casualties had 
     climbed to over a hundred, and to Norberts knowledge, they were 
     still climbing. Norbert considered his options of 
     A) Storming the place anyway or B)Driving to the next town 
     and buy doughnuts when the screech of a braking car made him 
     wince and bite his tounge. He watched the men closest at hand 
     widening their eyes and starting to back away when the slam of 
     a closing cardoor called to their attention.
     "I should've been a gardener, just like me ol'mom'tol'me, he 
     thought as the steps of someone (or something!) weighing 150 Kg
     and totally dressed in metal neared him. Norbert thought he was
     fainting when the light of the street lamps were blocked out by
     an enormous bulk passing by, and then it was there, in front of
     him. 

     A huge humanoid shape, dressed in the most technologically
     advanced armour you can find, stomped up to the building, never
     slowing down a bit. Because of the blood pounding in his ears, he
     guessed rather than heard sixty policemen unsecuring their guns
     as the figure reached for the biggest gun Norbert had ever seen.
     "Men, Hold your fire, fer chrissakes', hold your FIRE!!" he 
     screamed, hoping he reacted quick enough so he wouldn't have to 
     confront a lot of angry widows as well as an angry boss in the 
     morning. 

     Time stopped, as the huge figure, standing erect and with
     that gun in his hand, turned around and watched at Norbert. As
     the man ("he must be a man, mustn't he?") stood in the shadows
     Norbert didn't see his face, only a red glimmer from some sort
     of a helmet or something ("It can't be his friggin EYES!").
     That was when Norbert saw the most hideous thing he had ever seen,
     a thing that would haunt him in his dreams years to come.

     The shape smiled. 

     It was the biggest, maddest smile he had ever seen, and he had 
     visions of liontamers putting their heads into that smile. As the
     man turned and walked through the entrance to "Perts Plastic 
     Products" Norbert shook his head free of the disturbing visions.

     "Well, what do we do now, captain?", one of the men asked. 
     "Mmm?" Norbert replied, absentmindedly, thinking about the money 
     one can earn doing toothpaste-adverts with that smile.
     All of a sudden, reality came back to Norbert. Here he was, with 
     sixty of his men, and with HIM inside.he began to sweat anew, when
     the man repeated his former question.
     "All men to their vehicles, NOW!! We're to be outta here in one
     minute, or there'll be nothing left of us to get out!!!!" As if 
     to punctuate the meaning of Norberts orders, the ground shook and
     a firecloud billowed out from one of the windows.

     One minute later Norbert sat in the passengerseat when one of his
     men asked him where they were heading.
     "Oh, just drive on to the next town and I`ll buy doughnuts for
     everyone. Pass it on through the radio, there's a good lad."
     As the driver started handing out orders another boom was heard 
     from the factory-building. Norbert watched it in the rear-view-
     mirror as he thought of the reprimands he would get tomorrow in 
     the boss' office for not standing at guard as commanded. Well,
     blast that, Norbert wouldn`t stand around that factory right now
     for a million bucks, hell no, not when the place had gotten a 
     visit by the Bounty Hunter.....


     **************************************************************


     The Game Itself
     ---------------

     This game is a classic Jump`n`Shoot`em`up where you guide the
     Bounty Hunter (as you haven`t guessed already) through the 
     dangerous levels in the chase after Morgan Schinowski, A.K.A 
     "Wild Morgan", and the "Thermo-Flux-Time-and-Space-Warping-
     Device ©" that he has stolen. 

     This game is a tribute to all of you who sat there, ten years ago,
     struggling through all the rooms in JetSetWilly, or swore at the
     fourth room in Henry's House. Shortly said, Those jumpies where
     the pixels made the difference between life or death. If you did
     not stand exactly right and timed your jump extremely well, it
     was back to the starting point.

     Now, The jumpies nowadays can be pretty good, but they don't
     have the same feel as the good oldies did, mainly because they
     base their playability on action, not timing.

     Therefore, we have tried to include a bit of them both for this
     little demo, and we really hope you'll enjoy it.

     We sure know we do.


     **************************************************************



     How To Play
     -----------

     This part is really very simple. in the demo you'll notice a 
     little blue figure. That is the Bounty Hunter and that's the
     guy you're steering. If you pull the joystick up,up'n'left or
     up'n'right you'll jump. If you pull the jostick right or left
     you'll go (surprisingly enough, considering the odd bugs we've
     discovered and debugged in this demo) right or left.
     If you pull the joystick down you'll duck, and if you press the
     fire button you'll shoot.

     Now, at the bottom of the screen there are some numbers that are
     a lot of zero's, a couple of hearts, a gliding bar and a fast,
     down-counting counter.they are in order of appearance;

     The Scoretable
      -  if you'll fetch some coins or kill some 
         baddies you'll notice this table will not 
         be filled with zeros anymore.

     The Heartrow
      -  This is the number of lives you got, if one
         of the baddies get you , you'll die and one
         heart will be subtracted from the lot.

     Firepower
      -  This bar shows how much firepower you have 
         left. It refills all the time, but you cannot
         auto-fire yourself through the demo.
         This is to spare your thumbs, and NOT to make
         the demo harder to complete.

     Point-O-Meter
      -  These numbers are scorepoints. If you complete
         the demo fast enough, the Point-O-Meter will
         stop and you'll be able to collect the huge
         amount of points that it'll show.
                              


     To make this doc a fullfilment to all the other docs in the world
     we have decided that we will also draw a scetch in ascii, showing 
     you more exactly _where_ these little features are situated on the
     screen, during your demo session..(so you'll know where to look).

     Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the ASCII-scetch..

           |      This is the screen. here you`ll spend most of    |
           |      the time watching.                               |
           |                                                       |

           |                                                       |
           |                                                       |
           |                                                       |

           |  Here are the other stuff                             |
           |                                                       |

           ---------------------------------------------------------

     There are also a couple of things you can collect along the way 
     in the demo, they are ;

     Coins      
      -  They are round and rotating, collect them 
         and add some points to your Scoretable.
         The small ones give xx points and the big
         ones give XX points.

     Healthbox
      -  A bluebox with a white cross on it.
         Get it, and you'll get an extralife
         (an extraheart).    

     If you see something that doesn't look like this, we strongly
     advice you not to collect it, as it can prove to be hazardous.

     There are also places where one should jump, and there are places
     where one should wait, even if there's no reason at all in doing
     so.....


     The rest of the demo is up to your own "trial and terror"..


     **************************************************************


     Things to come:
     ---------------

     Things to include if the feedback gets high enough:

     * More multidirectional levels (Not just door to door)

     * More baddies (Tons of them)

     * More different platforms to jump on (disappearing,teleporting)

     * Different weapons to pick up (why have a multi-fractional-beam
     lazer and not upgrade it?)

     * Menu choices (Instead of just "click fire" there will be a 
     chance to define keys, shut down music/Sfx, level Code (U wish!:-)

     * Sublims that will make you want to send us a lot of precious 
     items.

     * different armour to pick up (so you won`t die so much so quickly)

     * Other themes on the levels (like...er.."wood"..."space"..you know)

     * And all the possibly wonderful ideas that the possible
     feedbackers possibly send us.

     known bugs
     ----------

     * The loops in the module do not quit playing when you start the
     game and change levels. We are not ignorant of that fact, even if
     we wish we could be, but we just want to release it.

     * Sometimes the game goes Gameover at the beginning. We work very hard to
     discover this bug. We think it has something to do with another player in 
     another dimension, just having his game ended, and this occurence mirrors 
     its way in to our dimension, but, what can we say, it`s a game that goes 
     over the three dimensions :-)

     A finishing word
     ----------------

     Well, now there ain't so much more to say, so load the demo,
     complete the two levels, send us the feedback wether you liked
     it or not, and YOU decide if the demo will turn into a game
     or not. 

     (This very voting thing was attempted by a swedish cable-
     channel where swedes could vote if they should continue broadcast
     their soap opera.the attempt utterly failed and the soapopera 
     went down the drain. Comforting thought isn't it:-)
