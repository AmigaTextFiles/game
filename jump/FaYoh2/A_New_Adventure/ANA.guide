Hello, dear registered player!
   I'm  sorry  about  the one-month-delay of this game. I had lots of problems
getting  things  work  correctly,  and testing all levels stole much more time
than I had expected. But now it's finally here.
   I  will  - most likely - send you a new version of this game later. Because
there  are  still  some  small  things I wish to change/improve. This doc, for
example,  needs  a  good overhaul. If you payed the double amount of money for
the game, you will receive the paper doc in some weeks (I haven't even started
working on it yet :( ).
   I  hope  you'll  enjoy this game. And remember, that you won't see the REAL
ending of the game until you've got a 100% score on every level!

Take care!

@node 4 "Story"


                                  S T O R Y

The  most  horrible thing has happened! Don Jockface, a black bubblegum, stole
FaYoh's  gum-machine. FaYoh, a green gum, used it as storage for his stars. No
one  actually  knows  what  stars are good for, but gums sure enjoy collecting
them.  Don  Jockface  had  no  interest in the stars though. He just wanted to
search  for lost coins in the machine. So the black gum carried the machine to
the top of his tower, where he thought he could work undisturbed.
   FaYoh must ofcourse get his bubblegum-machine back. But that's not all! Don
Jockface  carried  the  machine carelessly and dropped stars everywhere in the
big tower. Before gum-fighting with Don, FaYoh must find the lost stars!

@node 6 "Control"


                                C O N T R O L

To guide FaYoh around, you use a joystick or -pad (MUCH better) in joyport.

- LEFT/RIGHT
   Move left/right. Walls stop you.
   When you answer a question, left is "yep" (yes) and right is "naw" (no).

- FIRE/UP
   Jump, or move up if FaYoh has got a propeller or fish-suit.

- DOWN
   Always use it to walk through mirrors.
   If  you're  plain  FaYoh this is the stomp-button. It can only be used when
FaYoh,  jumping,  is  on  his way up in the air. He falls down hard, and if he
lands on a brick-block, it cracks.
   If FaYoh is wearing a fish-suit, he moves down.

There are also some keyboard-functions (only IN game!):

- Esc
   Quit to title.

- SPACE
   Pause. Press SPACE or FIRE to unpause. If you press Esc during a pause on a
level that you've completed before, you go back to the tower.

@node 7 "Levels"


                                 L E V E L S

You start in the tower of Don Jockface. It is filled with mirrors that lead to
strange  areas  of  the  black  gum's  home.  You  enter an unlocked mirror by
pressing joy down. But what nasty beasts might hide behind the locked mirrors?
Complete some levels and you'll know!
   When  you've  found  all  hidden  stars  in an area, you must return to the
tower's main court by entering the mirror you came from.
   There are two special mirrors at the bottom of the tower. 

- SAVE
   A witch lives in this mirror. For a tiny fee, she'll save your progress!

- BONUS
   Use your points to win extra lives!

@node 8 "Bonuses"


                                B O N U S E S

- STARS
   To  complete  a level, you must find all stars. All stars equals 50% of the
total levelscore. The scoreline tells you how many are left. 

- FUNCOINS
   There  are  five funcoins hidden on each level. When they're all found, you
you  receive an extra life. One funcoin equals 5% of the total levelscore. The
scoreline tells you how many you've found.

- CHERRIES
   In  most rooms, there are some cherries to pick up. If you get all cherries
in  a  room,  they are gone next time you go in there. Finding all cherries in
all  rooms  on  a  level  gives you 25% of the total levelscore. The scoreline
tells you how many are left.

- KEY
   There are red, yellow and green keys. You use them to get rid of barricades
of same colors.

- PROPELLER
   This  item  allows  FaYoh  to  fly.  Very handy when you have to reach high
platforms. With this on his head, FaYoh is also immortal!

- GOLDEN BEETLE (Buss)
   This  is a suit that makes your enemies believe that you're one of them. As
long  as  you don't stomp an enemy, they don't try to kill you. After stomping
an enemy, your suit disappears. You loose the suit when entering a new room.

- GOLDEN FISH (Wobler)
   This  is a suit that allows you to swim. You loose the suit when entering a
new room.

@node 3 "Hints"


                                  H I N T S

-  Arrows never lie. So if there's something you can't find - like a funcoin -
look for arrows that seem pointless.

- Walls don't have to be walls.

@node 10 "Requirements"


                           R E Q U I R E M E N T S

You  need  an AGA Amiga with a HD to run this game. If you've got a hog A1200,
you probably have to reboot with no startup-sequence.
   The  game  doesn't  like  all  commodities.  I know that MCP can cause some
problems,  but I really haven't had the time to check it out (and there's most
likely  nothing  I  can do about it). Avoid using screenblankers that actually
turn off the screen (such as DMA-blanker).
