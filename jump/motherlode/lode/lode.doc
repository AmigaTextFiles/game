      This game is based on an old game with a similar name.  Those of you

who have played that game will find it very familiar.  You may skip the

Rules section if you wish.  If you haven't played before, please read

everything.  Everyone should read the Shareware Information section, which

also tells you how to get the level editor.
  

Rules:
------

  The object of Mother Lode is to collect all the chests(yellow boxes) on

each level, and then make it to the top of the screen.  There are ladders to

climb, ropes you can pull yourself across gaps by, and various types of

floor.  The most common type of ground looks like blue bricks.  You can dig

through this type, and this type only.  More on digging later.  The second

type is more solid, and looks like one solid brick instead of many smaller

ones.  This type can not be dug through.  The last type looks just like

ordinary bricks, but is actually a trap!  If you try to stand on one of

these, you will fall through to whatever is below.  Note that on some

levels, you may actually NEED to use one of these traps at some point.  Also

note that if there is a ladder directly on top of a trap, you will be able

to stand there, but you will also be able to climb down into the trap(but

not back up!)  You may have to experiment to find these traps.  Watch the

robots for clues!

   Digging:  To help you accomplish your goal, you have been given a

microwave shovel capable of digging through any normal bricks.  It has an

unlimited power supply, but it's effects are not permanent.  You may dig

into any ordinary set of bricks, as long as the space above is not

obstructed by anything, including robots!  The direction you will dig is the

last direction travelled before pressing the button. (Two button joysticks

ARE supported. see below)  You will always dig one square to the left or

right of your current position. It is possible to dig while standing on solid

ground, on a ladder, or hanging from a rope.  Note that a rope above a

square does count as an obstruction, and you will not be able to dig there.

   If a robot is stuck in a hole, you may safely step on its head.  Be

careful though, if it's been in there too long, it may climb out and kill you.

   After a certain interval, any bricks which have been dug out will begin to

fill in.  If anyone or anything happens to be caught in the middle of this,

it  will die.  You may move freely in the holes dug this way, including

digging farther down. However, if a robot falls into one of these holes it

will become stuck.  Eventually, it will manage to free itself, unless the

square fills in first.  In that case, the robot will be crushed, and a

replacement will appear somewhere near the top of the screen.

    Robots:  On each level, there will be several robots guarding the

chests.  While not particularly bright, they are persistent, and cause

instant death if touched.  You may dispose of a robot by trapping it in a

hole you have dug, but another will soon be along to replace it.  New

robots can be seen transporting in near the top of the screen.  During

the transport period, it is safe to touch, but as soon as it is fully

present, it is as lethal as its predecessor.

     You may fall any distance safely, onto any sort of surface(except a

robot, of course).  For every level completed, you will earn a bonus which

depends on the number of robots on the level.  You will also receive an

extra man.  Every level included with this game has at least one robot, and

no level will ever have more than six, although I haven't even included any

with that many.  Sometimes the level itself is more of a problem than those

pesky 'bots, sometimes it's the other way around.

    One last thing:  after you have collected all the chests on a level, new

ladders will usually appear.  These are to aid you in getting to the top,

and sometimes may be neccessary to win.  For example, a chest could be in a

pit with no apparent way out, but if you collect that chest last, a ladder

will appear to let you out.  Also remember that a ladder that helps you

might also help a robot get to you.  Be careful.


Controls:
---------
   At the beginning of the game, several options can be set from the

pull-down menus:

   Level -- choose the starting level.  This can be anywhere from 1 to 999.

There are 50 levels included with the game, but you may add more later. While

playing the game, you can change the level by pressing ctrl-N for next, or

ctrl-P for previous.  However, if you have any points, this will forfeit

your chance at a high score.  You may start at any level and still get a

high score, though.

   Joystick -- One or Two buttons.  If you have a two button joystick, USE

IT!  it makes things much easier, as you don't have to keep turning around

to dig.  The way it works is:  button 1 digs to your left, and button 2 digs

to your right.  Sega type joysticks are set up properly to work as two

button sticks.  For technical types, the second button is wired to pin 9. 

Instead of choosing this option from the menu, you can also click button 2

to start the game.(after all, people with one button sticks can't press the

second button.)  From within the game, ctrl-J switches the mode.

   Sound -- Turns the sound on and off.  Use ctrl-S inside the game.

   Quit -- Adios muchachos.

   You can also view the high scores and an 'About' message from the menus.


Key commands used while playing:

ctrl-S  -- toggle sound
ctrl-J  -- switch joystick mode.
ctrl-V  -- Slow the game down, for fast computers(or slow people :-)
ctrl-Q  -- back to title screen(or quit entirely if on the title screen)
ctrl-A  -- Abort this life, in case you fall and can't get up.(get stuck,
           that is)

Cheat keys:  (Use as much as you want, but you won't be allowed to record a
              high score.  Exception: ctrl-N and ctrl-P may be used freely
              before you've gotten any points.)

Ctrl-N  -- Next Level
Ctrl-P  -- Previous Level
Ctrl-X  -- eXtra man.

Using levels from other places:
-------------------------------
   Two programs, "combine" and "separate," should have been included with

this game.  These are used to make several levels into one file, and turn

that file back into separate levels, respectively.  The purpose of these is

to make it easy to upload groups of levels and pass them around without

worrying about actual level numbers.

   Please see "combine.doc" for more details.


Shareware info:
---------------
    This game may be distributed freely, provided all files are left intact,

and no profit is made from said distribution.  A reasonable fee for disk

copying and shipping may be charged.  If you enjoy this game, please send a

contribution to the author.  In exchange for $15, you will receive a level

editor which will allow you to create levels just like the ones found with

the game. (after all, it's the same editor >I< use to make them!) 

Alternatively, send me $10 with a blank disk and a SASE and I will send you

the editor.  Feel free to load up that disk with goodies, too!(only legal

stuff, please)

    In an effort to ensure the quality of my games, I will give away a copy

of the editor to anyone who reports a major bug, if I can duplicate that bug.

I hope there aren't any, but it's well worth it if it gets people to tell

me about them.  (A major bug would be, for example, starting World War III.

Crashing the computer also qualifies.) 

    If you don't like the game, feel free to tell me that as well.  I'm

always open to suggestions.
