   This is the documentation for the two programs "Combine" and "Separate",
whose functions are to convert Mother Lode levels into files suitable for
uploading.  To do this, use combine to make a range of levels into one file.
This file can be passed around freely, and Separate can be used to turn it
back into levels on someone else's system.

Combine:
--------

Syntax: Combine <start_level> <end_level> <filename>
makes a file <filename> containg all levels from <start_level> to <end_level>.
all arguments are mandatory.

Examples:

   Combine 1 5 MyLevels - Creates file MyLevels containing levels 1,2,3,4,5.

   Combine 20 20 OneLevel - Creates file OneLevel containing only level 20.


Separate:
---------

Syntax: Separate <name> [start_level]
reads the file <name> and copies the levels it contains sequentially, starting
at start_level.  if start_level is left out, Separate will look for the first
empty level(that is, the first level for which there is no file of the form
"lode.lxxx" where xxx is the level number.)

Examples:

   Separate MyLevels 75 - Copies the levels in MyLevels to level 75 on.

   Separate MyLevels  - Appends the levels in MyLevels and the end of the
                        existing levels.


Notes:
------

   First, why did I need to write these?  Well, the levels as they are can be
passed around and still work, but they would have to be carefully renamed to
avoid overwriting existing levels(i.e. I might have 259 levels on my disk, and
someone could have uploaded level 91).  Without combine and separate, I would
have to rename that level by hand.  These programs do that for you, as well as
making it convenient to pass around groups of levels.

   Second: If you don't buy the level editor, you probaby only need Separate.
I included Combine also just in case you've collected some levels from other
places, and want to make one group out of them.
