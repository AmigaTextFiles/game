CORNELIUS SAVES CHRISTMAS
by Alkis Polyrakis

1. STORY

Cornelius is a child, young enough to still be excited about Christmas and not blame his parents for giving him such a goofy name. One day on his way home from school, he overheard the owner of his town’s only big store saying that he wouldn’t be selling any Christmas trees or toys this Christmas. Although he couldn’t understand everything the old man said, he realized that an evil wizard named A. C. Countant forced him to make that decision. Wasting no time, Cornelius decided to fight against the enchanted toys that were under the spell of the wizard and free all the trapped Christmas trees.

2. HOW TO PLAY
Cornelius saved Christmas is a classic platform game, similar to the popular representatives of the genre that we used to play a lot in our Amiga. Help Cornelius save Christmas by guiding him through 30 levels. Use the joystick to move him around and press fire to shoot at the enchanted toys. To complete a level and move on to the next stage, you need to destroy all the toys and make your way to the Christmas tree. You have 7 lives to complete the game.

P: Pause game
Esc: Lose a life
Ctrl + C: Quit to Workbench

Note that the further you move your joystick, the higher Cornelius will jump.

The blocks that constitute the levels of the game have different attributes. Some of them are completely solid, while you can jump through some of the others. Some will kill you if you fall on them, while some will disappear if you trigger the right switch somewhere else on the screen. There are also some blocks that will teleport Cornelius to somewhere else.

During the course of the game, you will have the chance to collect different weapons and extra lives.
