A special thanks to the active members of the SMW forum: 
SleepyP, Xijar, Fernando Márquez, j rok, Jared, 4matsy, DrJones, 
UltimateNinja9, ventuz, Flexserve, nitsuja and leftyfb.  These guys are 
relentless in responding to content requests and providing feedback.  They 
have created tons of maps, sounds, music and skins for this release!  The 
quality of this release is directly a result of their help and great ideas.

I'd also like to thank the xbox test crew: Brian Porter, Caesar Cypher, 
Brandon Stansbury, Brian Smith, Chris Schager, Alex Arnot, Jason Lumbert
 and Kevin King.  They have helped me find numerous bugs and have suggested 
tons of features of which practically all were included in this release.

THANKS!


Inevitably, we have forgotten to thank somebody for their contribution.  So
many people contributed ideas it's hard to keep track of everybody! :)  Please
let us know if we forgot your name here and we'll add it in a hurry.
