<h2 id="gm_"><a href="javascript:toggleIt('gm')">Game Modes [click to view]</a></h2>
<div id="gm" class="leftbar" style="display: none;">

	<h3>Classic</h3>
	<p>
	This is the original Mario War game where each player starts with X lives and the last
	player with any lives left is the winner.  Touching a hazard (such as spikes) causes
	you to lose a life; collecting a 1up mushroom gives you an extra life.
	</p>


	<h3>Frag Limit</h3>
	<p>
	This is the standard frag limit game where the first player to kill X players
	wins.  Dying on a hazard causes you to lose a frag; collecting a 1up mushroom
	gives you an extra frag.
	</p>


	<h3>Time Limit</h3>
	<p>
	This is a timed game played to the number of seconds you select.  The player
	with the most frags at the end of this time is the winner.  Dying on a hazard
	causes you to lose a frag; collecting a 1up mushroom gives you an extra frag.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Jail Limit</h3>
	<p>
	This mode is similar to Frag Limit, but with a couple of modifications.
	Each player you kill in this mode will spawn in jail.  When a player is in jail,
	their movement is slowed down and their jumping ability is hampered.  If all the
	players on other teams are jailed, you earn extra points and everyone (both on your
	team and other teams) is freed.  If a player on your team tags you while in jail,
	you are freed.  You are also freed if you spend 20 seconds in jail.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Coin Limit</h3>
	<p>
	This game isn't about killing other players, it is about collecting coins.  A single
	coin will appear somewhere on the map.  If someone grabs it, or if nobody can get to
	it within a certain amount of time, a new one appears somewhere else. The first
	player to collect X coins wins.  Getting killed on hazards has no effect (except
	for dying and respawning) and collecting the 1up counts as collecting a coin.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Goomba</h3>
	<p>
	In this mode, goombas will randomly spawn; the goal is to stomp as many as you can.
	The first player to stomp X goombas, wins.  Stomping other players does nothing;
	neither does getting killed on hazards.  Collecting the 1up counts as an extra kill.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Yoshi's Eggs</h3>
	<p>
	In this mode, a Yoshi and a bouncy little green-spotted egg will randomly spawn.  Players
	can pick the egg up, and when the egg is brought to Yoshi the player that got it there
	gains a point.  The first person to return X eggs to Yoshi wins the game.  Eggs can
	be stolen from players that are carrying them by killing them.  Killing yourself on
	spikes will cause you to lose the egg if you have it; collecting a 1up gives you an
	additional point.
	</p>


	<h3>Chicken</h3>
	<p>
	In this mode, the first person to kill another person will turn into the
	chicken.  The player that is the chicken will rack up points.  The first player to
	X points wins.  Dying on spikes will cause you to stop being the chicken, if you are;
	collecting a 1up mushroom will give you 25 points no matter who you are.  Killing
	another	player while you're the chicken will give you a bonus 15 points.
	</p>


	<h3>Tag</h3>
	<p>
	Tag is essentially the opposite of chicken mode.  At the start, one player will randomly
	be chosen as the tagged player (their colors will be bright green with a white border).
	It is the job of the tagged one to touch or kill somebody else to transfer the tag.  
	The tagged player gets a speed boost to help him catch the other players.  When 
	you're the tagged player, you'll constantly be losing points.  When you hit 0, 
	you are removed from the game and the player with the highest points will then 
	become tagged.  Being killed or killing yourself takes 15 points off your score
	and collecting a 1up mushroom restores 25 points.
	</p>


	<h3>Domination</h3>
	<p>
	This mode is like the domination mode from many FPSs.  There will be several bases 
	(the number is always one more than the number of players) randomly placed around
	the map and it is the goal to control as many of them as possible.  You control them
	by tagging them.  The more you control, the faster you accumulate points.  The first
	player to accumulate X points wins.  If you die in any way, you lose all your tagged
	bases and collecting a 1up gives you 25 points.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Race</h3>
	<p>
	In this mode, you must race around the map tagging moving targets in numerical order
	(you must tag "1" first, then "2", and so on).  As you tag targets, your team indicator
	will appear on them.  Once you tag "1", "2", and "3", head to the finish line (the
	checkered flag) to score a point.  If you or anyone on your team is killed, you lose all
	the targets you had tagged to up to this point.  Collecting a 1up gives you one extra lap.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Owned</h3>
	<p>
	This mode is similar to Domination, except the players are your targets.  Each
	player that you kill will spawn with a circle of your color behind them.  For
	every player you have "Owned", the faster you accumulate points.  If you are
	killed, you lose all your owned players.  Collecting a 1up gives you 25 points.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Fire Frenzy</h3>
	<p>
	This mode has the same rules as Frag Limit, except special fire flower powerup cards
	will randomly spawn around the map.  The more players there are, the more cards will
	appear.  Collecting one of these cards has the same effect as getting a fire flower
	out of an item box.  It just makes a normal deathmatch just a little more exciting.
	</p>
	

	<h3>Hammers</h3>
	<p>
	This is the same as Fire Frenzy, except hammer powerup cards will randomly spawn
	instead of fire flower cards.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Bob-Omb</h3>
	<p>
	This mode has the same rules as Frag Limit, except a special bob-omb powerup card will
	randomly spawn.  Collecting this card turns you into a bob-omb.  Press the turbo button
	to explode killing all players (except yourself) in a large area around you.  After 
	exploding the bob-omb, a new bob-omb card will spawn.
	</p>


	<h3>Survival</h3>
	<p>
	This mode has the same rules as Classic, except now, Thwomps rain down from the sky.  
	Hitting a thwomp kills you.  The last player alive wins.
	</p>


	<h3>Free Play</h3>
	<p>
	This mode has all the same rules as frag limit except there's no limit.  You play until
	you're done.
	</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2 id="go_"><a href="javascript:toggleIt('go')">Game Options [click to view]</a></h2>
<div id="go" class="leftbar" style="display: none;">

	<h3>Spawn</h3>
	<p>
	Choose the style of how players spawn.  
	<li>"Instant" is just a puff of smoke with players instantly spawning.
	<li>"Door" is how players spawned in the original Mario War; a door
	opens and players fall out after about half a second.  
	<li>"Swirl" leaves a large color
	swirl allowing players to easily see where they are spawning.  It takes about one second
	to spawn this way.
	</p>


	<h3>Awards</h3>
	<p>
	This is the style of awards that players will see when they score multiple kills in a row.
	<li>"Fireworks" sends out a number of indicators above the player equal to the number of kills
	the player has in a row.
	<li>"Spiral" is similar to fireworks but the indicators spiral out from the player.
	<li>"Ring" shows off your kills with a ring around the player showing the type of kills they
	have scored.
	<li>"Souls" doesn't show anything until the player dies, at which point the souls of the 
	players he has killed can escape.
	<li>"Text" mode displays a text indicator of how many kills in a row the player has scored.
	</p>


	<h3>Scores</h3>
	<p>
	Sets the position of the in game scoreboards.  The options are:
	<li>"Top": aligned to the top center of the screen
	<li>"Bottom": bottom centered
	<li>"Corners": puts the scores in the four corners of the screen
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Announcer</h3>
	<p>
	This allows you to select the voice that announces kills, the start of the game, etc.  This can be 
	customized by creating text files in the sfx\announcer directory.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Team Kill</h3>
	<p>
	When playing on a team, you will be able to accidentally kill your teammates if this option
	is on.  When off, there are no collisions of any sort between teammates.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Team Color</h3>
	<p>
	When this is on, your player will change colors depending on what team he is on.  When off
	Player 1 will always be red, Player 2 will be green, etc.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Respawn</h3>
	<p>
	Sets the amount of time that a player must wait before they respawn after being killed.  It
	can be set between 0 seconds (i.e. instant respawn) and 10 seconds.
	</p>


	<h3>Shield</h3>
	<p>
	The shield option will give players a white shield around them just after spawning for one
	second.  They will also get this shield after warping.  This option helps players from being
	killed instantly after spawning or warping if a player is near and waiting to kill them.
	</p>


	<h3>Crunch</h3>
	<p>
	When this option is on, each time a player is killed, the screen will "crunch" a little bit.
	It is just an eyecandy effect to make the kills seem more impressive.  :)
	</p>


	<h3>Top Layer</h3>
	<p>
	Some maps contain layers that are drawn over the players.  When this option is on, these
	layers will be drawn.  If your computer is slow, turn this option off.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Fullscreen</h3>
	<p>
	Use this option to toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode.  You can also hit 
	"CTRL + ENTER" at anytime to toggle this option.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Sound</h3>
	<p>
	This setting adjusts the sound volume or turns the sound off completely.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Music</h3>
	<p>
	This setting adjusts the music volume or turns the music off completely.
	</p>

	<h3>Show FPS</h3>
	<p>
	When this option is on, the frame rate will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.  You
	can use this to determine if you are running at full frame rate or not.  The frame rate
	should be at 62.5 fps.
	</p>

  </div>
  
   <h2 id="pu_"><a href="javascript:toggleIt('pu')">Items [click to view]</a></h2>
<div id="pu" class="leftbar" style="display: none;">

	<p>Items in the game can be acquired in two ways: from "?" blocks or
	by winning tournaments.  When collecting an item from a "?" block, depending
	on the item it may be used instantly or it may be stored for later use.  Items
	that are acquired by winning a tournament will always become a stored item at the
	beginning of each game you play (until there is a new tournament winner).  Here are
	the classes of items:
	<li>Instant - These will be used instantly by the player upon picking it up.
	<li>Collectable - These will be used instantly if the player doesn't already have this item;
	otherwise they will be stored.
	<li>Weapon - These are just like Collectables, except that if you already have another
	Weapon, the one you already had becomes stored instead of the one you just got.
	<li>Stored - These will be stored and can be used at anytime by pressing the item button.

	<h3>1up Mushroom</h3>
	<b>Type: Instant<b>
	<p>
	Awards the player some bonus score.  Depending on the gamemode, this could mean several
	things.  In games where you have a certain number of lives, you will earn an extra life.
	In games where there is a kill count or something similar, you will gain an extra kill.
	In ames where you earn score based on the time you hold an object, you will gain 25 points
	toward the goal.
	</p>

	<h3>Fire Flower</h3>
	<b>Type: Weapon</b>
	<p>
	This will give you the ability to shoot fireballs with the turbo button.
	</p>

	<h3>Invincibility Star</h3>
	<b>Type: Collectable</b>
	<p>
	Gives the player invincibility for 10 seconds.  During this time, the player can walk on
	spikes/lava, stay above the map as long as they want or continually fall without burning
	up.  If you collect a star and are already invincible, you will store it for later.
	</p>
		
	<h3>Poison Mushroom</h3>
	<b>Type: Instant<b>
	<p>
	Upon collecting this item, your player dies instantly.  It has the same effect on your score
	as hitting spikes or lava.
	</p>

	<h3>Hammer</h3>
	<b>Type: Weapon</b>
	<p>
	This powerup will give your player the ability to throw hammers.
	</p>
		
	<h3>Clock</h3>
	<b>Type: Stored<b>
	<p>
	When the clock item is used, all players that are not on your team will be slowed down
	and will only be able to jump 2 blocks high.  This effect lasts for 10 seconds.
	</p>

	<h3>Bob-Omb</h3>
	<b>Type: Collectable<b>
	<p>
	This powerup turns the player into a Bob-Omb.  Pressing the turbo button causes the player
	to explode and kill players around him.
	</p>

	<h3>POW Block</h3>
	<b>Type: Stored<b>
	<p>
	When this item is used, the screen shakes for about half a second and any players that
	are touch the ground during this time are killed.  Players should watch when a player is
	using this powerup and make sure they make a long jump so they are not killed.  This also
	kills goombas that are on the ground in Goomba mode.
	</p>

	<h3>Bullet Bill</h3>
	<b>Type: Stored<b>
	<p>
	When this item is used, the player becomes shielded and Bullet Bills will fire in from
	the sides of the screen for about 5 seconds.  Players on the opposing team must dodge or
	jump on the bullet bills to avoid death.
	</p>

	 important map.  Just remember that pressing 'S' saves instantly to what ever map name
	 is in the upper right corner, overwriting what ever was there before.

	 <h3>Controls</h3>

	 <dl>
	 <dt>T</dt>
	 <dd>
	     Brings up tile set - select a tile by left clicking on it (DON'T RIGHT CLICK
	     unless you want to change the type of tile it is, but this behavior will only
	     change on your machine, not the machines you distribute the maps to)  Now
	     you're in "Tile Mode".  Look to the upper left corner for the mode you're in.
	     Tiles are collision detected blocks that don't move or background non-collision
	     detected images.
	 </dd>

	 <dt>I</dt><dd>Brings up the interaction block set - select a block by left clicking on it.
	     Now you're in "Block Mode".  Blocks are collision detected blocks that interact
	     with the player in some way, such as breaking upon impact, releasing items,
	     bouncing, etc.  Blocks can be placed over tiles without replacing the tile.  So
	     if a breakable block is placed over a tile block and in the game the player 
	     destroys the breakable block, then the tile block will become visible.
	 </dd>
	 
	 <dt>W</dt><dd>Brings up the warps set - select a warp by left clicking on it.
	     Now you're in "Warp Mode".  The direction of the warps face "out".  This means that
		 if you want a player to be able to warp down into a pipe below him, place an upward
		 facing arrow on those blocks.  All warps with the same number are connected and players
		 will randomly exit from the same number warp that they entered from.
	 </dd>
	 
	  <dt>M</dt><dd>This puts you into "Move Mode" - you can now select areas on the map and 
		move them around.  First select an area so it is highlighted in red.  Now click and hold
		on that area and move the mouse to drag it around.  There are some more tools you can use
		to make this more powerful:<br><br>
		
		<li>Shift - This allows you to select multiple areas at once.  Hold down the shift
		key then select areas on the map.  All the areas will stay selected.<br><br>

		<li>Ctrl - This allows you to select areas freehand.  Hold down the left control
		key then select areas on the map.  The areas are now selected just under the mouse
		instead of the drag select box.<br><br>
		
		<li>C - Pressing the "c" key will copy the areas currently selected.  Move your mouse around
		to see what it will look like when you paste it back to the map.  When you are happy with the
		placement of the copied areas, left click the mouse to add it to the map.  If you want to
		abort the paste, right click the mouse.<br><br>
		
		<li>Delete - If you want to delete certain areas of the map, simply select them and hit the 
		"delete" or "backspace" key.<br><br>
	
		
	 </dd>

	 <dt>S</dt><dd>Save the map to the name in the upper right corner of the screen

	 </dd>

	 <dt>Shift + S</dt><dd>Save the map as a new name (but doesn't change the name of the current map)

	 </dd>

	 <dt>Shift + F</dt><dd>Find a map by name - This will bring up a dialog where you can enter part of
	 a map name and it will open the first map that matches that string (if no map matches, it stays on
	 the current map).  You can then repeatedly press "f" to view all the maps that match that string.

	 </dd>

	 <dt>F</dt><dd>Repeatedly press the "f" key to view all the maps that match the current find string.
	 If you haven't used "Shift + F" yet, it will bring up the find dialog.

	 </dd>

	 <dt>N</dt><dd>Creates a new map and keeps the current map's tiles (if you want to do a "save as"
	     while also changing the name of the current map you're working on, press 'N', name
	     it then press 'S').  File names now support underscore and space characters.

	 </dd>

	 <dt>CTRL + DELETE</dt><dd>Clears all tiles and blocks from the current map

	 </dd>

	 <dt>V</dt><dd>Hide the interaction blocks so you can view what is behind them

	 </dd>
	 
	 <dt>Y</dt><dd>Since there are 4 layers to a map now, you'll need to select which layer you want to
	 add tiles to.  Use the "Y" key to do this.  On the upper left, you'll see a little 0,1,2,3 icon.  The
	 colored number is the layer you currently are on.  When you add tiles, they will be added to this layer.
	 The layers are ordered: 0 - bottom most through 3 - top most.  You can use this key in conjuction with
	 the "U" key to view just a single layer.
	 </dd>
	 
	 <dt>U</dt><dd>Toggles viewing just the selected layer or all the layers at once.  Sometimes it is nice
	 to just modify a single layer without having to look at all the layers. 
	 </dd>
	 
	 <dt>O</dt><dd>Optimizes the layers.  This essentially moves all solid tiles down to the deepest available
	 layer.  There is a performance hit for tiles in layers 2 and 3 of the map.  You should try to place as 
	 many solid tiles that a player would never be behind in layers 0 and 1.  This optimize tool helps you do 
	 that.  Save your map prior to using this feature because it can split up tiles across layers which makes
	 the map hard to work on after you optimize it.  Optimized maps should behave in the game exactly the same
	 way an unoptimized map does, except it will performe better.
	 </dd>

	 <dt>B</dt><dd>Changes the background image

	 </dd>
	 
	  <dt>E</dt><dd>Brings up a dialog to select the floating eyecandy

	 </dd>

	 <dt>Left click</dt><dd>place a tile in the currently selected layer (or place a block but there is 
	 only 1 block layer)

	 </dd>

	 <dt>Right click</dt><dd>remove a tile in the currently selected layer

	 </dd>

	 <dt>ESC</dt><dd>Exit</dd>
