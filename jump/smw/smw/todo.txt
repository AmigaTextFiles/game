Done  Pri  Description
[X]        Down jump on solid on top blocks
[ ]        powerup selection on menu
[X]        mushroom menu marker instead of ">"
[X]        no "maps/" in front of map names
[X]        button turns off menu so you can see the background map
[X]        No "exit" or "fullscreen" on Xbox version
[X]        Better screen resize feature for Xbox (left stick position, right stick size or top/left then bottom/right set size)
[ ]        Victor of last game wears special marker?
[ ]        Speed up/high jump mushroom powerup
[ ]        Rideable objects like Yoshi and Bomb Cannon (make yoshi ridable in Yoshi's eggs mode so one player can try to move Yoshi away from other players.  Bomb cannon shoots fire balls and Yoshi can eat other players)
[X]  High  Tournament play (keep track of wins and each time a player wins a tournament, they get a special item like Bomberman, each win is tracked with the icon from that game time (chicken, clock, coin, egg, etc))
[X]        Add team play - allow setting of teams 2 on 2, 1 on 2, 3 on 1.  Adjust modes so that if one person on the team is chicken or tagged, then all players are chicken or tagged.  Adjust scoreboards so there is only 1 per team with all mario icons on that board.
[X]  High  Drag select and move for map editor
[X]        Add awards for kills in a row, kills in air in a row, dominating (score x% above everyone else, say 30%).  Awards should be like text eye candy, but be some sort of easily recognizable graphic and sound.
[ ]        Report kills, deaths, kills in row, kills in air in row, other player's kill sprees stopped on score board when game ends, games won (possibly with graphic like a chicken icon for each chicken win, coin for coin match, egg for egg match, thwomp for survival, etc)
[X]        Option on menu for spawning.  Allow instant, door(fast), swirl(slow), and top?
[X]        Add Door eyecandy for door spawning
[X]        When turning off menu to view map, make left/right keys switch map regardless of which menu option is selected
[X]        Have back and front eyecandy so some objects can be behind player
[X]        Have back and front objects so blocks are behind player and fireballs/powerups are in front of player
[X]        Add menu help for random/map view buttons
[X]        Stop invincible music when returning to menu
[X]  Med   Add background music (have it stop when invincible music plays then resume afterward)
[X]  Med   Background music for menu
[X]        Add pause/resume feature
[X]        Optimize collision loop for front and back interaction objects (get frame rate up!)
[X]        Add Domination Mode
[ ]  Low   Detect plugging in joysticks in the middle of running the game for XBox
[X]        Add sound for tagging block in domination mode
[X]        Add Bob-bom mode (and test it with 1up, player killed player, player killed self, invinciblity, etc...)
[X]        Fix player overlapped on both sides of the screen collision detection (real pain) - also fixed items and blocks overlapped coldec also
[X]        Add smoke poof when spawning instantly
[X]  High  Pipe warping from one pipe to another
[X]        Better note block super jumping (right now you have to hit the jump button before you hit the block)
[X]  High  Two layer tile map where there is a possible background tile and a foreground tile.  At startup, both layers would be blitted to the background so there is no performance hit, but this would allow for things like fences, railings or rounded objects to appear infront of background type tiles
[X]        Fix bug where if 3 players were bouncing off each other, the 1.5 bounce multiplyer could cause velx to exceed TILESIZE and players would move thorugh tiles.  Fixed with CapVelocity() function.
[X]        Work on awards system - need a good way to reward players for cool moves or kills in a row.  Currently we just have one award for stomping on more than 1 player in a row in air.
[ ]  Low   Add PNG support - will reduce BMP background size quite a bit (project is currently 30MB unzipped)
[ ]        Add Network support for PC version
[X]  High  Fix powerup width/height to be more like mario (smaller width and height with drawing offset).  This will allow for powerups to fall through 1 tile holes.
[X]        Fix Player4's controls from fcvb to 5123 for PC version - Tried, doesn't work because key states array is only 
[X]        Fix game bug where in Yoshi's Eggs game mode if a player has the egg and is killed by a player with invincibility, they killed player doesn't lose the egg!
[X]        Compressed formats for music (mp3 or ogg)
[X]        Fix bug where player can be on edge of breakable block and if player hits edge and bottom at same time, player on block is not killed
[X]        Kills in a row award should be blocks of player color swirling around player outwardly with the number of kills in a row on each block
[X]  Low   Fix top row of blocks on the map.  They should only detect collision on bottom, not top or sides.  This will allow for the player to fall through the top if they are stuck up there, but hit the bottom to keep them in.  -> Perfect collision detection now occurs on top row with a out-of-bounds timer to kill player if he doesn't move back into main map
[X]        Souls style awards where we keep track of which players the player has killed and upon his death, his killed souls escape (use 16x16 jump player sprites for souls)
[X]        If players are in a continous falling loop, when they reach terminal velocity, they should start "burning up" and if they stay like that for too long, they die (fixes problem with somewhat invincible players in a continous falling loop).
[X]        Fix bug if player is invincible and game ends and he gets game over mario, the invincible music keeps on playing
[X]        In domination mode, if you die, all of the areas you control lose your color.  We'll have to see if this is a good change on gameplay.
[X]        Customizable input controls
[X]        Fix bug where players spawn invincible but still can collide with other players
[X]        Add Unreal awards back in as award style option
[X]        Make pressing down key on PC version do down jump and keep down + jump on Xbox for down jump
[X]        Put unreal sounds back into project
[X]        Make corpse eyecandy collision detection rect as wide as player so it doesn't get stuck in tiles on sides
[X]  High  Add option to menu to turn on and off screen crunch
[X]        Look at options.bin and write it big/little endian to possibly fix mac crash
[X]  High  Select more than one awards style at a time?  How about making the unreal announcer an option to turn on and off.
[X]  High  Add "Owned" mode where when a player kills another player, a colored marker is put on the killed player.  The killer scores points depending on how many players he has currently "owned".
[X]  High  Option on menu to merge front layer into background layer to increase framerate on slow machines
[X]        Fix exiting game to select no button by default and have to move to yes button and press Enter/A to select
[X]        Tag mode should trade tags when players touch, not stomp.  Maybe lose goal/25 score when stomped by any player
[X]  High  Add special items players can collect and use in a battle.  Add a new button to use the special item (star, fireflower, slow other players, 1up, steal key item (like bomb, chicken)) and use in battle.  Display special item in scoreboard for players.  Winning tournament gives player random special item to use.
[X]        Spawn invincibility is all of a sudden shorter than normal (1/4 sec maybe).  Possibly caused by spawn style length of time (spawn invinciblity counter is ticking while spawning)
[X]  High  Map loading latency on XBox (try commenting out the new new warp code to see if it fixes it, then optimize)
[X]        Chicken and tagged should not score when warping
[X]        Game crash when winning by a bomb blast in bob-omb mode (scenario: player 4 winning at 19 kills on 20 kill bob-omb mode)
[X]        a second "no tag backs" after a tag is transfered -> made tagger spawn invincibled
[X]        Reoranize map structure.  Read in each tile and all date with that tile.  Should be organized backgroundID,layer1,2,3,4,interactionblock,warp,layer1,2,3,4,inter... 
[X]        Write and read functions to do both little and big endian (cleans up map saving and loading code quite a bit, also options.bin if needed)
[ ]        timebased movement or hardwired fps or auto frameskipping or like in "rubber pig" by david olofson
[X]  High  Add Mario skins where each sprite has 6 (3 for upper and 3 for lower... or more) mapped colors and the colors of the player are mapped onto that sprite at load time.  This way we don’t have to create 4 different sprites for each player!  Maybe make different skins unlockable (by winning tournaments) or just configurable on main menu.  Add all skins from fan sources + old classic blue overalls.
[X]  High  Update Readme with new http://smw.72dpiarmy.com/ site and combine readme from all previous releases so credit is given to all who helped develop the game
[X]        Optimize slow areas like tournament winner screen by predrawing everything to 1 layer
[X]        Jail mode?  Stomp players and they spawn slowed down and take 20 seconds to unfreeze.  Can be freed by team players.
[X]        Fix bug when player jumps into bottom of another player near the top of the screen, they will move to the side of the player and not ride all the way up.  Caused by rounding error -> switched yf() to yi().
[X]        Optimize block collision detection by taking all blocks around player + 1 and just collision detecting against them, not all blocks in interaction object array
[ ]        Add vegetable mode per zio tok's request - code has classes to support this (look at OverMapObject class).  Painful part is doing all the mario carrying sprites.
[X]        Add those blue throwable blocks.  Could use same carry and throw code from vegetable mode to do this.  Implement with a new type of interaction block that just dies when you try to carry it and creates a carryable object.
[X]  High  Mortal Kombat announcer with "Fatality", "Excellent", "Brutality", "Combo"?
[X]  High  Add pipe network locks so when a player enters a pipe network, it locks (so only one player is allowed in a network at one given time).  A little lock icon should be displayed on all the locked entrances/exits.  Should lock for 3 seconds maybe.  An alternative solution is to have players actually move along the pipe path and collide in transit.
[X]  High  Make bomb card, fire card, egg, and coin (and any other appearing item?) appear in a location for 30 seconds, if no one grabs it, move it to a new location.
[X]  High  Add color map image that has color->replacement color for all colors
[X]        Add Kirby, Bubble Bobble, new GBA mario skins, Final Fantasy
[X]  High  Link, shyguy and snifit skins
[X]        Add stored powerup per player instead of one per score
[X]        Race mode
[X]        Fix problem when mario comes out of pipe and another player is there causing warping player to move inside block.  Need to map collision detect when moving players to the side of other players.
[X]        Use a single skin file instead of the 10 separate files needed now.
[X]        Add friendly fire to options menu to turn on and off
[X]        Change green flag powerup to POW block.  Make it so only players on ground die during blast.  Get SMB2 POW sound.  
[X]        Get SMB2 timer sound for slowdown powerup
[X]        Add feature to convert 1.5 maps to 1.6 maps
[ ]        Improve AI to deal with death spikes -> easy to detect but hard to do it effeciently (need to scan entire map and make notes of blocks to avoid and which sides are deadly).  Keep this info in an array in the map (you can prescan when we do warp areas) and use the threat style distance detection in the AI just like everything else (I'm not sure which object to return from the nearestSpike function).  Make sure that only downward or all direction spikes are counted when jumping and upward or all direction are counted when falling.
[X]        Improve AI to deal with invincibility, down jumping, turbo 
[X]        Improve AI to deal with goals other than killing other players -> now goals trump trying to kill other players.  AI will chase powerups, bob-omb and fireflower cards, coins, eggs, yoshi (if player has egg)
[X]        Improve AI to deal with threats -> AI now avoids fireballs, explosions and thwomps
[X]        Add new scoreboard shades and tournament images to allow for 3 person teams to easily display all player sprites nicely
[X]        When using a stored powerup, do some sort of consuming swirl animation before powerup kicks in to give other players a warning that it is coming
[X]        Option to turn music on/off
[X]        Option to move score board from top/bottom/corners
[X]        Fix bug with ring awards (last award is not shown and there is a hole in the ring)
[X]        Fix bug with skins not loading on xbox and huge latency when loading skins.  Can press A -> back -> A to start without skins?!
[X]        Stomp'em Mode where goombas are randomly walking around the screen or dropping in from up top and the first player to kill X goombas wins
[X]        Poison mushroom powerup
[ ]        Carryable items like vegetables + bombs
[X]        Fix bug where when time is up on timed mode and two teams/players tie, then they are both left in game and allowed to score!  No scoring should happen after game is over!   Check all game modes.
[X]        Fix bug where CPU doesn't need to run away from his own fireballs
[X]        Fix bug on xbox, pressing start when map view is on in tournament mode should start game, not show player team/skin select -> Fixed?  Need to check.
[X]        Fix bug where number and intensity of thwomps not being reset between games
[X]        Fix bug in thwomp mode, red/green + yellow + blue -> green died taking red/green team to 0 lives and red player was left behind (was not removed from game!) until he was stomped on then he was removed but team had -1 score -> Problem is that CGM_MarioWar::playerkilledself(CPlayer &player) method doesn't handle killing all players on team!
[X]        Fix bug if yoshi doesn't have egg returned to him in 30 seconds, move him (he can get stuck in middle of map if he can't find a spot)
[X]        When players/teams die off one by one, keep track of who died first and when displaying end of game scoreboard, if scores are tied, then tie-break by who died last
[X]        Add fireballs the color of the player that shot them.  This way you can tell which fireballs you are immune to and which you need to avoid.
[ ]        "Catch Up" option on menu that gives players in last place toward the end of the game a speed boost/higher jump or possibly a slower speed and jump for the player in 1st place.
[ ]        Moving platforms
[ ]        Along with moving platforms, add conveyor belts
[ ]        Diggable sand tiles from SMB2.  When you press the turbo key over a sand tile, it "digs up" and disappears. Otherwise the tile acts just like solid on top tiles.
[ ]        Water tiles where players can swim up in them
[ ]        One way tiles that don't allow a player to move in the opposite direction of that shown on the tile (so really disallows movement tile, instead of forcing only movement in a single direction)
[X]        Fix physics from nitsuja: 1-up mushrooms bounce off of thin air instead of falling off the platform of clouds, pushing sideways into a music note block while falling really fast will completely stop your falling, and pushing sideways into a music note block when you're falling not-so-fast sometimes makes you bounce way upward. -> Hard problem the way it is now because collision with map tiles and blocks happens in two seperate areas now allowing you to precalculate where fy will be for interaction obejcts like collision with tiles does
[ ]        Use new libSDLx libraries for xbox release.  See if we can get the joystick recognition code working during the middle of the game.
[ ]        New option for friendly fire called "Assist" where you can pogo off of your teammates for extra jump height.
[X]        Bullet bill bonus powerup where a bunch of survival style bullet bills come in from both sides for 15 seconds and initiating player is immune from death while this is happening (give them spawn invincibility during this time)
[X]        Detect if we're going to play the same sound multiple times closely together and avoid doing this.  Maybe we need to implement a sound manager.  Something like manager.play(id) and it automatically keeps track of what sounds it has played recently and doesn't play them again (5 frames or something). -> no sound manager, but each sound tracks when it played last and if it is under 40ms, it doesn't play again.
[X]        Fix bug with solid-on-top tiles with only a single tile space above and then a solid tile.  Player can't jump up into this space.
[X]        Fix display bug where you use a stored powerup then go into a pipe (shows still ring of powerup around you)
[ ]        Fix bug if you are pressing a direction then die and stop pressing a direction, your player will still be moving when you spawn
[X]        Fix bug where items you are carrying (like eggs) disappear when warping
[X]        Fix bug if two players are hitting a powerup block (helps if they are on the same team with friendly fire off) and one player hits the block and it bounces up and another player is traveling up when the block is coming down, the second player can get trapped in the bottom of the block.
[X]        Bug where players get stuck inside blocks - has to do with collision detection after players collide with each other.  Since map collision detection happens after a player is moved to a new position based on the player's collision box, he can be moved into solid tiles.
[X]        Fix bug where players spawn under ceiling spikes
[ ]        Fix AI so it doesn't move into areas where they will be over spikes without falling on to something solid first.
[X]        Option to turn on spawn invinciblity on options menu
[X]        Animate interaction blocks like powerup, breakable and note blocks
[X]        Make goombas die when player hits bottom of breakable, bounce or powerup block
[X]        Only have POW block kill things on the ground (see if inair == false and kill that object) for the duration that shaketimer > 0 (also need to add teamID of killing team to game_values).
[ ]        Winning pose - have player do a special winning pose when the game is over
[X]        Figure out why fireballs are not being collision detected against bullet bills
[X]        Add helper keys at bottom of team/skin select screen
[X]        Fix all areas where colors for players matter (new colorID should be used)
[X]        Fix yoshi's egg moving down to player's feet when warping
[X]        Fix mario jumping up into a gap, but being "bounced" out
[ ]        Move scores out of way of players jumping up into them
[X]        Put location arrows at top of screen when player's iy + PH < 0 and have distance counter? -> Player out-of-bounds counter and when it reaches 0, player dies
[X]        Fix top row of tiles and interaction blocks so player can't get stuck on top of screen
[X]        Add substitutions to the clouds on each level, add option for clouds, nothing, and other flying things from mario games (ghosts, fish, birds, flying koopas?).  Have it as a setting on the map like background.
[X]        Remove "name_" infront of map names when displaying
[X]        Don't play music when "hurry up" music comes on
[ ]        Speed up playing music after hurry up ->SDL_Mixer is not capable of doing this.  SDL_Mixer 2.0 should support this feature :)
[X]        Play special game over music (maybe the music from SMB1 after sliding down the flag pole)
[X]        Speed up cpu_think() by not taking the sqrt of the distance for each of the 5 distance functions.  Just use the raw squared distance instead.
[ ]        Mario death gore option
[X]        Spinning arrows around the chicken to more easily identify who is the chicken (especially with the new chicken color scheme)
[X]        Spawn invincibility for pipe warping
[X]        Update intro splash screen to use mountain (or random?) background with new text
[X]        Fade out background on menus by blitting everything to a surface and overlaying with solid transparent black texture - need to draw all background objects to a single surface and draw transparent black over the top then just display that surface (might be slow to load new maps)
[X]        Fade out background when game is paused or exiting
[X]        Add sound when player finished "lap" - something from mario kart perhaps
[X]        Stop background music when invincible
[X]        Have better tournament menu music
[X]        Fix SMB3Level2 music - at end of loop it doesn't smoothly flow into beginning again
[X]        Add option to menu to not play music
[ ]        Add a framerate movement adjustment to all moving items so when framerate dips below 62, it adjusts for smooth movement - caused problems with collision detection!
[X]        NEED optimization for interaction object blocks -> maps are slow where lots of interaction blocks!
[X]        Test new faded background under menus -> check load time for switching maps on xbox and check tournament end with exploding fireworks (should not see any degrade in performance)
[X]        Add key to hold down to skip 10 maps at a time when choosing map (there are too many maps now :)
[X]        New hammer powerup that is on top of blocks makes a small arc and falls to ground
[X]        Fix bug with hurry up music where if a player is removed from the game (classic and tag) and there are two players left and one has the hurry up limit, the sound is not played until the next kill because the just dead player isn't removed from the game yet so the countaliveteams() still returns 3.
[X]        Use bullet bill sound instead of cannon for bullet bill powerup
[X]        Go through nitsuja's music files and clean them up.  Add music and use SMB3 world clear as new tournament over sound?
[X]        Test poison mushrooms, fireballs, and hammers while players are warping (do they die mid-warp?)
[X]        Make AI avoid poison mushroom instead of trying to collect it
[X]        Figure out rogue crash on chainlink map where players were on the same team (2, 1, 1) log had half the new music playing line.  Only seems to happen in .exe, not when debugging or in ide. - Float rounding error in 2 places + tag dangling pointer
[X]        Need better way to place items than 64 tries then put in middle.  Maybe give it 64 tries and if it still fails, try 64 times again next frame.
[X]        Currently deleting string memory for bool and music descriptions that are passed as const parameters.  Is this OK?
[X]        AI doesn't need to run away from poison mushroom when invincible
[X]        Jailed AI just jumps in place - fixed, it was trying to tag itself in getNearestTeammate()
[X]        Add check in autotester to see if a player is inside a solid block and to pause the game if this happens (make sure the automatic game end at 3 minutes doesn't kick in if paused)
[X]        Fix bugs where accessing map.block, map.map, map.warp, and map.blockat.  Make sure we access within array bounds!  Corpse violates this right now on both tx and ty (falls off bottom of screen or overlaps sides)
[X]        When player hits another player from side and bottom in same frame, the collisiontotop and collisiontoleft/right are true at the same time.  Need to integrate this into the collision handling when both top and right/left are true.
[X]        Add copy and paste to level editor
[X]        Don't display where tiles used to be when moving them
[ ]        Look into SDL_Mixer 2.0 -> add playing .ogg sounds and changing music speed
[ ]        Level editor port to Xbox
[ ]        Sloped floors (possibly sliding down them like in smb3)
[ ]        Several tile sets and you can choose which tileset you want to use for each level
[X]        Preload and keep in memory menu, tournament, tournament over, and end of level music so there are no jumps when playing the music.
[X]        Need to sleep a little in the level loading code so the menu music playing thread doesn't skip -> Done, need to test on Xbox -> better but not completely fixed
[X] High   Fix Bug: screen flicker in full screen mode!!
[ ]        Fix Bug: No stage clear music when playing race mode -> related is music continues on race mode after stage over -> No repro :(
[ ]        Domination suggestion: switching places from time to time -> moving all tiles after X seconds (30 maybe)
[X]        Goomba collision detection reported to be a bit weird.  I've never encountered this issue, but some friends of mine said that if you hit a goomba in an angle close to 45 degrees (or thelike) you'll die.
[ ]        Race is a bit too penalizing.  Resetting a players laps if he dies is a bit harsh. Maybe only one lap should be removed to make it less punishing.
[X]        Fireballs last too long.  They need a time to live and die if they don't hit anything.
[X]        close button, Alt+enter, alt+f4 won't work in the loading-splash screen.
[X]        alt+f4 / alt+enter won't work ingame.
[X]        Music playlists configurable like the announcer is.  You could do an "All" list that had everything like it currently is now and a "NES" and "SNES" list, or "SMB3", "SMB2" etc.
[X]        Volume slider control on options menu for sound and music
[ ]        Difficulty settings for CPU controlled players
[ ]        Add more pipe pieces like 2x2 corner pieces, 1x1 corners and up/down pieces and middle pieces for 3x3 pipes and larger
[X]        Add no player/item spawn indicators on map (addable in level editor) so that players and items can't spawn in certian areas)
[ ]        Add X% avoidable areas on map so AI avoids these areas X% of the time.  Maybe make it so every player spawn these areas are calculated to be avoided or not avoided for this life or for this Y second interval.
[ ]        The palette of sprites change in a strange way when eating a poison mushroom while invincible -> no repro
[X]        The chicken mode should reward the chocobo for killing other players.
[X]        The goombas should spawn more frequently.
[X]        Throwing hammers are too strong, maybe just letting you throwing one?
[X]        I find the default values of many modes too high, is there a way to save lower values in your preferences?
[X]        The egg is lost (and appear in a new random position) if you kill yourself in Yoshi's Eggs, unlike the readme states. -> Updated Readme
[ ]        Climbable tiles like vines and ladders
[ ]        Feather: Allows you to double-jump. Overlaps with other items, so for example you can have both a feather and a fire flower.
[ ]        Leaf: Allows you to float. (Could make you fall down slowly while holding the jump button, or could allow you to float like the Princess in SMB2.) Also overlaps with other items, but not with the feather.
[ ]        Vegetable: A la SMB2. When you grab one, it hovers over your head, and the next time you hit the fire button you throw it. If you have another projectile weapon, you keep it but can't use it until you've thrown the vegetable. If you hit someone with one of these, it bounces off them and can't hit anyone else.
[ ]        Mystery Mushroom: A la Battle mode from SMB3 on Super Mario All-Stars. This red mushroom with a question mark on it will make all players randomly switch places with each other when someone grabs it.
[ ]        Kuribo's Shoe: Makes you immune to spikes (unless you hit them with your head). Slows you down a bit and makes you do that little bounce-along-the-ground thing like in SMB3, but also makes you jump a lot higher and makes you immune to any weapon (including shells and veggies, which bounce off you) that hits you from the side or from below. You lose this when you get hit with three weapons or if you die from getting hit from above. Overlaps with all items. (Oh, come on, you know this would rule! :P )
[ ]        Boo: A la Super Mario Kart. When you use this, you become transparent (i.e. can move through other players) and can't be killed for a short time (except by environmental hazards such as spikes). Additionally, if any other players have bonus items, you will steal one of them at random. (This would work best as a bonus item.)
[ ]        N-Spade: A la SMB3. All over the course there are a bunch of cards (probably 12 or so). When you hit a card it turns your color and flips over to reveal a picture. After you hit a second card it checks to see whether there is a match. If not, they flip back. If there is a match with the other card of your color, you get points. If there is a match, but with a card of a different color, you split the points with whoever owns the other card. (So, of course, all point values should be even numbers, and ideally there would be several different values, so for example stars would be worth more than flowers, etc.) Jumping on players flips their cards back over; suicide does not. When all the cards are gone, a new set appears, and whoever gets to a certain score first wins.
[ ]        Dr. Mario: There are three viruses on the screen (red, yellow, and blue) and three pills with corresponding colors. You have to pick up a pill and touch the virus of the right color with it to get a point. Touching the wrong color kills you, as does touching a virus without a pill. Killing several of the same color in a row grants bonus points. Jumping on someone allows you to steal their pill, but you can't carry more than one pill at once. Suicide doesn't get rid of your pill. Dying in any way does not kill your color combo. First one to reach a certain number of points wins.
[ ]        Combo Race: First one to jump on a certain number of opponents in a row wins. Dying in any way breaks your combo.
[ ]        Eat Your Vegetables: Veggie cards instead of fire or hammer cards.
[ ]        Shell Shock: Shell cards instead of fire or hammer cards.
[ ]        Cheep-Cheep: Same as Goomba mode except there are Cheep-Cheeps flying up from the bottom of the screen like they do in some SMB1 levels.
[ ]        Cookie: Same as Survival except that the cookies from Yoshi's Cookie are raining down, and the goal is to be the first to reach a certain number. (Because cookies are tasty! ^_^)
[ ]        All Your Base: Same as Domination except that there are more bases (probably twice the number of players plus 1) and if you kill someone you get all their bases! Of course you should be able to claim other peoples' bases normally by just touching them. (I can't remember how Domination works off the bat but IIRC when someone dies in that they just lose all their bases regardless of how they died.)
[X]        Add Item and option descriptions in the readme.
[X]        Samuele Poletto's name spelt correctly in the docs and on the site.
[ ]        Add a mode where jumping on foes' heads or hitting them with projectiles merely sends them skidding backwards, and the idea is to shove enemies into Poison Mushrooms and lethal hazards! Working title: Sumo Mode! If Sumo makes it into Super Mario War, pushing foes should have greater effect in this mode.
[X]        Optimize release build for xbox (disable exception handling and optimize for speed over size)
[X]        Fix bug where on unfeeling map players fall through bottom but can end up on top of ceiling to right or left of hole.
[X]        OVerlayer optimization (only draw rects that have stuff in them!)  Precalculate rects when saving map!
[ ]        If a player is CPU controlled, but a player hits the controls for that player, it should popup a dialog asking if you want to turn that player into player controlled.
[X]        Make clock, POW, and bullet bill powerups less powerful
[X]        Make players start out with stored powerups at the beginning of each level
[X]        Make all powerups available from powerup blocks (but assign percentage chances for each one where POW will be low)
[X]        Make collecting a bomb, clock, bulletbill, or POW (or hammer/fire if you already have that ability) send it to your stored powerups
[X]        When in race mode and player has star powerup and then the game ends, the end music doesn't play but the normal background music does
[ ]        j rok spawned inside a wall, use his maps to reproduce and check what the spawn rects are on them! -> no repro
[X]        Fix bug where controls could semi control a cpu player
[X]        Fix bug where player hitting noteblock against a goomba would not give him the score point
[X]        Allow map creators to choose which music file (or a list of files) that can play on their map.  It then would randomly pick one from the list to play.  If the user doesn't have any of the files on the list, then they would get a random music file they do have.  This does take some power away from the user, not allowing them to pick which songs play.  Maybe we could tie this into which background image there is.  Each time a song is added, we would specify in some config file which backgrounds it is allowed to play on.
[ ]        Add "hurry up" sound to the announcer options
[ ]        Customized tilesets for each map (with corresponding collision options for each tile)
[X]        Customizable countdown timer before players respawn after death (could help calm down 4-player chaos a bit)
[ ]        More music: http://cc.usu.edu/~jerr/smwremix_sample.mp3
[X]        Change references of cristomarquez to "Fernando Márquez"
[ ]        Treat lava differently than it is now.  Powerups and items should be destroyed when hitting lava/spikes.
[ ]        Level Editor: Add an undo button
[X]        1up should add a constant score to domination, chicken, owned and tag.  When goal is large like 1000, you get 100 score!
[X]        Jail mode: Killing someone while you are jailed should be another way to get rid of your cage.
[ ]        Jail mode bug: Getting a poisoned mushroom while you are jailed sometimes gets ride of your cage. -> no repro
[ ]        Jail mode bug: When you kill a computer-controlled player with a hammer, it doesn't always jail them. -> no repro
[X]        Jail mode bug: Two characters are jailed, two are not; one of the jailed characters kills one of the non-jailed characters, and all jails are removed except the player who did the killing. Makes no sense.
[ ]        Poison Mushroom Bug: Kills you even when you have shield? -> no repro
[X]        Fix it so you don't spawn in the middle of the air
[ ]        If you have no music files in the music directory, SMW crashes on start up
[X]        If you put more than 32 warps on a map, it can crash in the middle of game play
[X]        Remove "Free Play" from tournament modes
[X]        Apply powerup weightings to bonus wheel
[X]        Hurry up music doesn't play if there are 3 players left on say tagand then one is removed from game and the two are below the hurry up threshold
[ ]        Game mode sub-options menu that allows players to customize details of a game mode (like add/remove chicken indicator, move domination goal boxes periodically, don't penalize race on death, slider bar for goal length, etc)
[X]        Test to see if xbox can handle overlayer now
[X]        Organize file list readers so that all code is in a central function
[X]        Bug 1: If the tagged player kills a player which hasn't enough life remaining, the tagged player remains tagged (it also could cause him/her not to properly reflect his/her tagged status graphic, we aren't sure). This happened while the tagged player was using the hammer.
[X]        Bug 2: If the winning player's life bar drops to 0 (for example, he accidentally eats a poison mushroom), he loses the crown on the scoreboard, and he earns no points from that stage (while in a tournament).
[X]        CPU players should use stored powerups if they don't already have the ability
[X]        Save fullscreen option for PC so it starts fullscreen next time
[X]        It seems to me that Jail mode is kinda pointless with two players.  Maybe if there are only two players left the bonus for jailing everyone should be disabled.
[ ]        Perhaps the respawn timer could be set to allow half-second intervals as well
[X]        The manual needs to be updated if the 1UP really does add a constant number now (many of the mode descriptions still say that it adds 10%).
[ ]        The offscreen arrow is really annoying sometimes because sometimes your opponents can force you to the top of the screen when you have virtually no time left. Someone else suggested letting the amount of time reload when you're on the screen for a certain time; maybe that would be a good idea. Say, for every five frames onscreen you get one more frame offscreen or something, up to the maximum of five seconds or whatever.
[ ]        Seeing the arrow time in tenths of a second would be better, I think.
[ ]        An option to change the max arrow time would be nice.
[ ]        Another timer for setting the respawn rate of item boxes would also be nice.
[ ]        An item switch, so you can turn certain items on and off (on options menu) and set their weights.  Say you had all items set to 0 except for flowers at 4, Bob-Ombs at 2, and POWs at 1. Then the total number would be 7, and flowers would appear four out of seven times on average, Bob-Ombs 2 out of 7 times, and POWs 1 out of 7. 
[X]        Don't draw "owned" spheres when warping -> also fixed jail and chicken marker
[X]        AI is using bobomb early -> will use it early if it is escaping a threat or trying to clear spikes/lava
[ ]        Add item no spawn zones as well as player no spawn zones.  Then the players can be restricted to spawn in just a small area, but items can be lots of places.
[ ]        Fast scrolling using triggers on xbox.  Have it so it just scrolls the names without loading the maps and when the trigger is released, then it laods the map.  Have the pressure of the trigger equal the speed in which it scrolls.  Have left trigger move up the alphabet and right move down.
[X]        Slider on the game modes to show you what goal you have set for this mode and allow you to go to 400 from 500 easily.  
[X]        Remove "Free Play" and replace with an infinity goal for each game mode.  This would allow playing goombas or coins for as long as you want.
[ ]        Bullet bills should kill goombas and players and attribute the kill to the bullet bill shooter
[ ]        Random special music for menus and stage clears.  Can be specified in the music pack configs.  Will probably need a number before each section indicating how many track are in each section.
[X]        Collision detection bug: Load the map Boarding Action and jump down the hole in the middle. Once you reach max velocity, hold left against the wall, and (if you haven't died already) you'll make it inside the top hole on the left. However, try the same thing but against the right wall. You won't get inside the hole, and you'll just die, even though the walls are identical. 
[X]        Fix bug where if you're spawn invincible from using a bullet bill powerup and then you warp, your spawn invincibility will be reduced
[X]        Fireballs and hammers when colliding with a group of goombas kills all the goombas
[X]        Fix bug where when using a stored powerup and you collect another stored powerup in the middle of using a different one, the powerup you are using will switch to the one you just picked up
[ ]        Add feature to give credit for kills to a player that touches another player then that player dies (poison mushroom, spikes, etc.) Essentially keep track of how long it has been since a player touched you when you "kill yourself".  If it has been less than a second or two, credit that player.
[X]        Add flurry SMB2 skin
[ ]        Add porcupo SMB2 skin
[X]        Add a few vine tiles
[ ]        Color-code the Bullet Bills and whatnot like the fireballs and hammers. Would it be easier to make it so one cannot kill oneself with one's own Bullet Bills
[X]        I've noticed that in free play, team members get points for killing each other if the "team kill" option is on.
[ ]        Cheep-cheep and lakitu/spiny frenzies as well? Cheep-cheeps would come up from the bottom of the screen ala SMB1's bridge levels, and lakitus would fly randomly around the screen and drop spinys... Or just have one powerup that randomly picks one of the enemy frenzies...
[ ]        Update map quantities in the thanks.txt files
[ ]        Just have one "frenzy" mode, but you can choose which item you want to use for the frenzy, so you could do frenzies with any item. (Bullet Bill or POW frenzies would be awesome, for example.)  Have these settings in the mode options
[ ]        Have seperate pages for tiles (pipe page, solid block, solid-on-top, death, etc) so there is more room for tiles and they are logically organized
[ ]        Verify xbox bug fix where you can pause then game when exiting or exit the game while paused!
[X]        Add gamepad support for pc
[ ]        Figure out impact of adding SDL_HWACCEL and possibly SDL_HWSURFACE | SDL_DOUBLEBUF to graphics init
[X]        Make sound/music control turn off when you decrease it past 1
[ ]        Player awards like "Most Frantic" etc.  Look on forums for ideas
[ ]        Mode and powerup ideas from forums: http://forum.72dpiarmy.com/?q=node/41
[ ]        Map makers should choose which game modes a map can be played on.  This could either be in a music pack like config file where blah.map,1,0,0,1,1,0 or in the level editor and is saved in the map data
[ ]        Have each team appearance directly under the other in the same image, so its like the current images, but repeated 3 more times below with different colours. Then you could have the different team versions look slightly different. Have a sonic skin that is Sonic on blue, Knuckles on red, Tails on yellow and someone else on green.
[X]        Fix hammers so that player's X velocity is added to the hammer's X velocity when shot
[ ]        Menu cleanup with different controls like toggles, text boxes, list boxes, map choosers, IP choosers etc
[ ]        Test new controls options, try xbox and try pc with joystick/gamepad
