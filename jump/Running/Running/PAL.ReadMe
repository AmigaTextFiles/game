PAL and NTSC are written by Nico François. Use the PAL utility to
switch your Amiga to PAL mode (only possible if you have the new
agnus (the 1 meg chip agnus)). It is included here so you can play
'Running'. (PAL is only needed if you do not have PAL by default.
PAL is default in Europe, but not in the USA).

If you have an Amiga 3000, you can use preferences (and 'AddMonitor')
to open a pal screen.
