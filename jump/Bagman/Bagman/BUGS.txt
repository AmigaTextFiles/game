minor:

sometimes guards go in opposite direction despite the opposite direction avoidance mechanism
sometimes guards choose a direction, then change it (in an intersection) when seeing player
can sometimes release pickaxe in slope (very rare)
NDS: gameover clearscreen
invincible flag not working

(maybe) to code later:

in-game music
game demo
hiscores
