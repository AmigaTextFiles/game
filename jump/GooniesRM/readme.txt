The Goonies Remake
Version 1.0


ABOUT THE PROJECT : 
///////////////////////////////////////

We are proud to present you the remake of a famous game of the Spectrum, the Amstrad CPC, the C64, the VIC 20 and the ATARI called « the GOONIES » from Datasoft inspirated by the homonym movie.
This project is a tribute to the games of this time which inspirate the games of today and tomorrow.

In despite of basic graphics and sounds, peculiar to this time, the original version brought a lot of fun and playability but especially a new kind of gameplay in the eighties, the cooperative gameplay which needs that the two players help themselves to finish the level.
All these elements have made « The goonies » a cult game from the 8 bits years.

To bring this game to the present days, we spend a lot of time to refine the graphics, to give a new dimension with realistic sounds and dynamic tunes, to create impressive special FX but we spend also a lot of time to enhance the playability and give you a great gameplay with the feeling of the original game. 
It isn’t enough ? ok, we have also added extra levels that you can unlock after finishing the game one time. 

We hope that you’ll have as much fun playing the game as us to create it.
