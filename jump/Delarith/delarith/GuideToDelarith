@NODE 1 "What Is Delarith?"

Delarith is the story of an adventurer seeking for treasure of ancients.
You must guide him thru' ancient ruins and ..........

Wow, what a story! So silly isn't it?.. It is just a platform game which you
have to have lotsa luck and a little brain...

The aim of Delarith is to collect 10 items to make the keys/biggers appear
then collect it to exit...... Easy?


DELARITH means nothing!!! Yes, nothing.

We found it while looking to dictionary to find a good name for our game.
The short for Arithmetics=arith, then put some other letter to create a cool
name, then it's DELARITH......

Delarith is again from ole Spectrum days, like our previous titles @{"NSX" link 100} and
@{"GEENIE" link 101}.
It is never programmed on Spectrum but designed in/for it. You can understand
this from level designs. They're 256*192 pixels.... Is there anyone remember
this numbers?
@ENDNODE
@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 2 "Levels"

Levels.... Made of 6 bpl EHB screens.... 6th for shadows again...

Walk over the blocks, use lifts, blow yourself up, fall down from exploding
blocks....


Let's simulate the blocks;
 ___
|\ /|   BORDER BLOCKS:
| X |   Usually appears on border tiles....
|/_\|   But sometimes, appear in game area... If so, means wall tile.

==:==   WALL BLOCKS: 
=:===   Standard wall tiles...
===:=   Good to walk on...

--:--   EXPLODING BLOCKS:
-:---   Seems like to wall tiles, but explodes on further steps then you
---:-   fall down.....

#"A"#   LIFTS:
# I #   Used to teleport yourself to upper/lower platform...
#.V.#   If there is a space to be teleported....

#"^"#   MINES:
#< >#   Jogging, never been this much fun....
#.!.#   Just step on it, watch your bones fly...

  x     ITEMS: 
 /$\    Collect them to get points....
 \_/    Collect 10 of them to find the key....

 _ 
|_|     KEYS/BIGGERS: 
  \     Collect it to exit to next level....
   X    (Do this ASCII seems like a key? NO!)

Delarith is based on a world system just as NSX and Geenie... 
This means you-pass-some-levels-all-level-graphics-changes.... 
Pass 5 levels and see new graphics..
World and level numbers are on the upper-left corner of game screen...

EXPLAINED BLOCK GRAPHICS ARE DUMMY AND WILL CHANGE IN EVERY WORLD, FIND THEM
YOURSELF WHICH BLOCK IS WHAT....

@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 3 "Enemies"

Of course there are enemies trying to stop you. Indeed most of them are just
trying to pass the screen and crush you if you're on their way...

There are 0-3 enemies per level. 

Here are our enemies:

Arrows, Liquid drops, Rockets, Fireballs, Crabs, Skulls, Boubles, Goldfishes,
Silverfishes, Seahorses, Worms (Should I call them worms?) and Eyes....

Too few enemies? Don't think so....

And your biggest enemy is the time limit.....

@NODE 11 "Brothers on the yard"

Backyard Brothers are a little team of ex-sceners (or sceners). There are
were two coders (M.Ali and Berke) but now just one, two graphicians 
(M.Ali and Tunc) and a musician (Onat) in the team.

I think we are the only team from Turkey producing games, but sure that we
are the only ones on Amiga...

This is the third title, and it took some time to finish it. I'm talking about
years.... But it took some weeks to finish, years after designing it...

@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 12 "Other Stuff"
These things were forgotten and added here, hope there's not more:

CONTROLS:
         - Use your stick (port 2)
         - Cursor keys to move + space for fire
         - Keypad 2-4-6-8 to move + Keypad 5 for fire

TIME LIMIT:
        There's also a time limit against you. It is shown on the lower side
        of the screen. Watch for it....

BEST TIMES:
        Getting the 'reset-timer' extra changes nothing for the best times
        list. It's counter is different, just be quick...
        You can break best time records (under 100) when you find the level
        pass cheat or you're so lucky that first extra is the key....

20492:
        20492 bytes are the data lenght for worlds. 
        You can not rename and play normal levels in a different order 
        (if you're not very very very lucky) or you cannot
        replace after editing them. DELARITH checks file and exits with 
        an error message if occured. 

GIVE UP A LIFE:
        When you feel yourself in stuck, press "ESC" to sacrifice a life.
        You will need it in some levels. This will restart the level, use
        it when you're falling directly to mines... You can't sacrife if only
        one life left...

CHEATS:
        The game itself has some cheat options, try to find them:
        Pass level, infinite lives, unlimited time, mines don't blow,
        no enemies, infinite shield....

@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE 14 "Last minute"

- Please, do not crack the game and not release trainers. The game itself has
some cheat options (explained in @{"OTHER STUFF" link 12}). Try to find them instead.

- Please, do not reset your machine when disk operates, it may be saving bests
lists to disk and may crash your disk or data. We are not responsible of
damages of your media that Delarith did because of this but we will replace
your damaged Delarith datas for once.

- Please, send a sample copy to us if you put 'DELARITH' to your compilation.
Or if you reviewed it do the same with your magazine..

@NODE 100 "Nibbler Super eXtra"

NSX is the first title of @{"Backyard Brothers" link 11}. Its a nibbler game
but it has a lots of extras, lots of levels, lots of cool graphics.....

Extras, levels and graphics makes it different from the others. Maybe the
best nibbler clone is NSX.

Extras such as lemming, pacman, ghost, joker, dynamite, scissor etc. makes
the game great fun.
