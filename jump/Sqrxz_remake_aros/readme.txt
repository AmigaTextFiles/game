          |       While Sqrxz wandered around on a sunny day,       |
          |       he was unaware that he had lost all his items     |
          |       while enjoying the scenery. It was already        |
          |       dark until he recognized the loss. There was      |
          |       no possibilty, but to go back where he            |
          |       started the trip and save his things. If the      |
          |       loss was not already enough, strange              |
          |       creatures appeared. Will they be helpful?         |

          |       Sqrxz requires fast reflexes and is a simply      |
          |       mindblasting Jump'n'Run puzzle game with high     |
          |       frustration factor originally made in 1996 by     |
          |       Marcus Vesterlund (Maze) and John Holmvall        |
          |       (Hojo) for DOS and Windows 9x.                    |
          |                                                         |
          |       Sqrxz (2010) is a remake of the game with         |
          |       same name and has been created by Rodolphe        |
          |       Boixel (Thor), Shahzad Sahaib (Kojote), Simon     |
          |       Butler and Brendan Ratliff (Syphus). Minor        |
          |       support came from Marcus Vesterlund himself       |
          |       who also gave permission to redo his game.        |
          |       Denny Müller (Mulle) supported the team with      |
          |       a Wordpress-Theme for the official page and       |
          |       Rabia Sahaib (Mahek) made three more levels.      |
          |                                                         |
          |       A remake should be usually bearing                |
          |       improvements, so does Sqrxz 2010. Beside the      |
          |       "classic" graphic mode, there is a new mode       |
          |       with "deluxe" graphics. The main gameplay         |
          |       has been modified in a way that you need to       |
          |       collect all items to open the door at the end     |
          |       of each level, which makes some levels harder     |
          |       than they actually already were. Extended         |
          |       "fun" is guarantueed with additional three        |
          |       levels, unseen before. Each level does have       |
          |       it's own chiptune and adds up to the retro        |
          |       feeling. A Top 10 highscore table will hold       |
          |       all your records. For the ones who like           |
          |       hidden features, there is even a small easter     |
          |       egg!                                              |
