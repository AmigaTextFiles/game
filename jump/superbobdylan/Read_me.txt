Requirements:
Any Amiga with 1 MB chipmem.

Installation:
Just make sure the drawers "pics" and "levels" are placed in the same
directory as the main game file "dylan".

The Game:
Your mission is to guide Bob through 8 of his best records. Each track on
the records is represented by a level in the game, there are 90 levels
altogether. After you have completed a whole record, you'll be given a
code, which means you don't have to play all those levels again.
On his adventures though the levels, Bob can pick up records. Collecting
99 records gives Bob an extra life. There are other various bonuses, like
shots, to pick up as well.

The gameplay:
Just plug your joystick into port 2 and get ready.
If you have ever played the 8-bit Nintendo game "Super Mario Bros", you
might find this game quite similar.
