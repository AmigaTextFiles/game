*** Introduction ***

Easter Egg is a challenging 2D arcade game containing 31 levels 
with nice soundtrack by Andrzej Drozd and graphics by Czeslaw Mnich. 
Game was made by me using Backbone.
 
The player takes the role of chick who travels through dangerous 
full of enemies levels. The goal of each level is to collect all 
white eggs which also gives extra points.
An extra life can be gained by collecting a big gold egg.

There are 3 types of stages in the game: "Grass", "Ice" and "Lava" stage.
Jumping on the blue platforms "ice" takes a few points of energy but 
standing on the red platforms "lava" takes energy as long as 
we not leave the danger platform.

For the beginners available is "cheat mode".
Offers extra live/energy or skip to next level.
