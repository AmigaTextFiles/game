This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@nakama.at).

PS: Due to heavy load on my machine (PegII G4) I had to remove a lot of
waterdrops from the waterfall.

PPS: Due to no support of several OpenGL commands there is no mirroring in
the water/lava as seen on the screenshots.

PPPS: I did only port the game, not the level editor, as I'm not sure whether
anyone will use it.
