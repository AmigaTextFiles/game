Introduction

of The Goonies at http://goonies.jorito.net.

The Story
=========
The action takes place in the sleepy seaside town of Cauldron Point - down in 
an area known as the Goon Docks. The Goonies are a group of local kids - Mikey, 
Brand, Mouth, Chunk and Data. One day they find an old treasure map in Mikey's 
attic. Data figures that this must be the fabulous hidden treasure of the 
notorious local pirate, One-Eyed Willy. The girls, Andy and Stef, join the 
other Goonies and the adventure begins. But the secret underground tunnels they 
are exploring are actually the hideout of the Fratelli Gang, and the Goonies 
are soon trapped! The Goonies have a powerful ally on their side, however, in 
the form of the huge and amiable Sloth.

When you play this game, you are Sloth! Can you help the Goonies find the 
treasure and escape back to save the Goon Docks from demolition?

How to play
===========
When you have started the game, you can select the 'How to play' menu option for
a visual explanation about the game's controls and objectives. These 
instructions are an expanded version of the in-game menu.

1. This game is designed for a single player competing against the computer.
2. The action can be controlled from the keyboard of your computer
3. Press the Space Bar on your keyboard to start the game.
4. An interesting feature of this game is that you have to keep in mind your 
level of VITALITY and EXPERIENCE as a player. You start off with 100% vitality 
and zero experience. These levels are indicated on your computer screen.
5. As you proceed through the game and run into obstacles, your vitality 
naturally decreases.
6. On the other hand, your level of experience will increase as you 
successfully dispose of the horrors (like the skulls and the skeletons) you 
meet in the underground maze. When your experience level reaches 100%, your 
vitality will increase.
7. You can knock out the members of the Fratelli Gang, but remember that you 
don't gain any EXPERIENCE from this!
8. Once you succeed in rescuing all seven of the Goonies from the underground 
maze of the tunnels, the next stage of the game will begin.
9. You can also increase your vitality level by grabbing up any cannisters of 
VITALITY DRINK you see in an empty cage that has no Goonies trapped in it.
10. To stop the action momentarily, press the [F-1] key. This will freeze the 
screen and show the map. Pressing the [F-1] key again will restart the game.

Structure and progress of the game
==================================
This game has five separate stages of increasing difficulty. Each stage has five
different scenes. The different scenes in a single difficulty stage are 
interconnected at the skull entry ports, and you can move from scene to scene 
at will. You must remain in the same stage, however, until you have successfully
completed it. The game is composed of one hundred separate screens of action.

Characters and components of the game
=====================================

Sloth (main character)
----------------------
The gentle gigantic creature who helps the Goonies to find the treasure and 
escape from the labyrinth.

Fratelli Gang members
---------------------
These are the bad guys. They want to hunt down and capture all the Goonies, 
who have stumbled in on the Gang's secret hideout. They are armed and dangerous!

Keys
----
These keys are to the cages where the Fratelli Gang has the Goonies locked up. 
Be careful, a cage may have more than one keyhole.

Doubloons
---------
Gold coins from the treasure hoard of One-Eyed Willy. Use these to increase 
your score.

Treasure sacks
--------------
Contained in these are many devices to help save the Goonies. But, be careful: 
sometimes they contain something you don't want at all!

Other items of treasure include...
Shields, magic formulas, riddles, hyper shoes, helmets, torches, time stopping 
devices, and magic capes. These have different effects on the enemy, and the 
same item will change effects according to its color. Figure out what must be 
done to get these treasure items to appear!

Passwords
=========
Rescuing all seven Goonies means you have successfully completed one stage. At 
this point, you will see a password displayed on your screen. Once you know a 
password, you can progress directly to the stage following it. 

Passwords can be entered by pressing CTRL+K at the title screen. After you 
entered the password, press ENTER to start the game.
