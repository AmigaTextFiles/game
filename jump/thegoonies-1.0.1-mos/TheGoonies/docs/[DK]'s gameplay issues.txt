Big rocks:

2-5-4 = Three times type.
4-1-2 = Four or five times type.
4-3-1 = Four times type.


Light blue coat:

It makes the player completely safe from the lava openings at 2-6-4, eg. . However, 
energy will be lost (a bit less than usual) when the player is bit by the water from a waterfall. Does this make sense?

Skeletons:

2-5-4 = Observe how they can climb...	2-2-1 ...but not jump.


Walls: If they close above you, you die.
