  Алекс неволно попада в града и вашата цел е да го избавите от сигурна
смърт. Имате право на 5 грешки, след това играта започва отначало. За
управление използвайте Джойстика във втори порт. Бутона на джойстика служи
за скок.

@node Editor "Level Editor"

  Unlike the original Sinclair game, the Amiga version features Level
Editor for all the designing minds out there. Creating levels is as easy
as drawing graphics with a graphic editor. The editor saves the designed
level as AlexLevel in the PROGDIR: After creating the levels they can be
added as files in the directory PROGDIR:Levels/Level# , Where # is
everything from 01 to 99. The custom levels start to play from level 24.
Levels 1-23 are built in the game.

  Send levels directly to @{" me " link credits} , for inclusion in later versions.
  Credits of course will be given to all contributors.
