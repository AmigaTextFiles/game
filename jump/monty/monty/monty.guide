@node 1 "So whats this Shareware thing mean ?"

    Shareware  is  a way of getting good software in a cheap way.
    You get hold of the software for almost nothing, and can test
    it  for  a  while  before  deciding  if  you  want to pay the
    programmer  for  his/her hard work   And remember that if you
    don't  pay  and nobody else do pay than it's pretty sure that
    the  programmer  will  NOT  make any more shareware software.
    And  that  will  in  the  end  lead  to  no software for your
    machine!!!!  So please, pay the author of the software.

    PLEASE NOTE!  This program is in fact, Shareware!

  Introduction:

  Monty is a wolf, who lives in a village. One day Monty goes out in the
  forest playing with his bouncy ball. Meanwhile his village is attacked
  by aliens. The aliens steal all the diamonds that power the village.
  Having no diamonds is disaterous for the village.

  Monty returns to find that the aliens just finishing off packing the
  diamonds in the cargo bay ready to take off.

  Only Monty could do something about it. Quick thinking he grabs a
  parachute and jumps on board the alien craft as it is taking off. As the
  alien craft is just nearing the atmosphere Monty finds a lever, thinking
  it might stop the craft he pulls it. But, the lever opens the cargo bay
  doors and all of the diamonds fall out, scattering all over the world.
  Monty jumps off the ship to go round and collect as many diamonds as he
  can before it is too late for his village.

  However, the aliens want the diamonds for there power source so they all
  return to Montys planet to collect them before Monty does. The aliens put
  all the animals of the forest under a spell so they will stop Monty in
  any way they can.

  You control Monty through the levels collecting diamonds, and avoiding
  alien influenced animals, the only way you can stop them is by using the
  bouncy ball Monty was playing with. Throwing the ball at the animals a
  few times stops them.

          Can you stop the village before it is too late............

   No such thing here, just simply drag the directory over to disk
   or hard-drive and double click on the monty icon, the game SHOULD
   load and run.




@endnode
@node 7 "Game options"

    From the title screen, selecting options, the following will be
    displayed::
    
                            LIVES: 3
                            GAME MODE: NORMAL
                            HISCORE: LOAD
                            LEVEL CODE: ------
                            DETAIL: HIGH
                            EXIT

    Here are the options in more detail:


    LIVES: 3 / 5 / 7
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    This shows how many lives you will have from the start of the
    game.  (Never)

    
    GAME MODE: EASY / NORMAL
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    This tells you how the game will be played   In EASY mode you
    will have less diamonds to  collect and you will only have to 
    hit the  baddies a few times    In NORMAL mode  then the game
    will  be  in default mode,  giving  you the  normal amount of
    diamonds  to collect  and  the baddies  will have  the normal 
    amount of hits.


    HISCORE: LOAD / SAVE
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    Selecting  between these  will not  do much as  they are, but
    pressing F10 while on this  option will let you save the high
    score table,  so you can  show off  your all time greatest to
    all your friends.


    DETAILS: LOW / HIGH
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    The game has two detail levels. If you have a slow AMIGA such
    as a standard  A500 or A600 then use the  LOW option, has the
    games runs faster, but you  don't have to. If you have a 1200
    or better then  use the HIGH  option  for all the  glory of a 
    overall  better display.  I have a 030 / 50Mhz AMIGA 1200 and
    the game runs without a single jump on the HIGH option.

@node 10 "Other Eclipse/ASP games"

    Games Done
    ----------

    The ECLIPSE COLLECTION DISK 1 consists of the following games:

    @{"Survivors" system "ppshow GFX/3.Pak"}
    This is a gravity game, pickup all the men that have survived
    a deadly bomb attack. You will need a steady hand to guide
    yourself through this game.

    @{"Super Tron" system "ppshow GFX/1.Pak"}
    Addictive 1/2 player game(Better in 2 player mode).  Guide to
    bikes around the screen, leaving a trail. The trail begins to
    make a maze, so now you have to watch you dont crash.


    @{"Mega Ball" system "ppshow GFX/2.Pak"}
    Guide a bouncing 'BOB' ball around mazes, using single joystick
    pushes.  Different puzzles such as invisible walls, painted
    walls, smaller gaps, and just plain hardness gets in your way.
    Very hard and   game.

    This disk can also be bought for a small price of £2.00 (English)
    pounds. Send money my @{"address" link 2.1} if wanted.


    Comming Soon
    ------------
    The following games are from ASP software which stands for
    A,miga only S,oftware P,rogrammers.

    The next game from ASP, will probably be STAR-FIGHTERS,
    This is a shootem-up game with a bit of Sydicate thrown in for
    good measure. Watch out for demos on the Aminet soon.



    NAME-UNKNOWN
    ------------
    Ever played Command and Conquer for the PeeCee or Playstation/
    Saturn?  Well thats what were making for youre humble AMIGA.
    If not, its a about 2 different sides, GOOD and BAD fighting
    against each other, using different tactics to defeat each
    other!

    At the moment, we are trying to squeeze the game for a 2MB RAM
    AMIGA, But it will probably need: A1200 4MB RAM faster processor,
    and a Hard-drive. Sorry fokes, but thats what you need for a
    game like this.

    NOTE: Any of you still will A500/+, A600 or bog standard A1200
    UPGRADE NOW to a faster A1200 with at least 4 MEG.
