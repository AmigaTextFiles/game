Bounce
~~~~~~

This is a bouncy ball platform type game that's great fun to play and
has some nice graphics (a rarity for me ;) )

All instructions are in the game, just wait for a while on the menu screen.

You can make you own levels/alter the previous ones with the supplied
Map_Editor. Don't have too many spikes or water surfaces, otherwise it'll
probably crash!

If you like this game, tell me. I might make Bounce 2 or something, if
there's enough demand!

This game is NOT shareware, but it's not PD either. Please, give it to
all your friends and enemies, but don't distrubute an altered version.
However, if you do alter it, let me have a look at it! :)
