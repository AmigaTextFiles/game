 . Introduction

   Retrobattle is made to look and feel like the classic arcade-style
   NES games, such as Ice Climber and Clu Clu Land. Not only are the
   sprites limited to three colors each, but the scoring, increasing
   difficulty, and setup of the game makes for a challenging arcade
   experience that mixes various oldschool concepts.

   See the file manual.txt for a more thorough description of the
   game.


 . License

   Retrobattle is licensed under the General Public License. Please
   see the file COPYING for more information.


 . Compilation

   To compile Retrobattle you need the SDL and SDL_mixer development
   packages. When these prerequisites are met, simply go into the src
   directory and type 'make'. Like this:

   $ cd src/
   $ make

   Hopefully you'll get an executable called retrobattle in the root
   directory of the Retrobattle package (i.e. retrobattle-src-*/retrobattle).


 . Installation

   Run 'make install' to install Retrobattle in /opt/retrobattle. If
   you want to place Retrobattle somewhere else, you can specify the
   RETROINSTALLDIR environment variable, like this:

   $ sudo RETROINSTALLDIR=/usr/local/games make install
