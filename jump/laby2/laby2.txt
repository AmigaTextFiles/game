 This game is a one-big-level-platform-game.
 
                     - SHORT STORY -
 
 You are a man lost in a very large labyrinth. You have to
 finde the door out from there. You don't need to fight or
 enything like that. The only thing you have to do is walk
 ...walk...walk...jump...walk... Until you finde the door.
 If you are impatient, don't play this game ;)
 
             -  HOW BIG IS THE LABYRINTH -
 
 The labyrinth is BIG. It's going to take a very long time
 for you to find the door. I know the way, but still it ta-
 kes over 30 minutes for me to walk through the labyrinth.
 
                        - SHEAT -
 
 If you finde it hard to finde the door, look at the pic-
 ture laby2.iff, there you can finde a simple map over the
 labyrinth and something more. But try first without sheat ;)
