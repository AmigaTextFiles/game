INTRODUCTION

    This is an (about 98% accurate) conversion of the old CP/M Ladder game.
    It was written from scratch with the screen layout copied by counting
    the chars on a NCR DecisionMate V.

PREFACE

    I liked the original game version from Tom van der Meijden. It seemed
    to be well written and had no problems with OS3.0, AGA and a 68030. It
    even worked flawlessly with its screen promoted to any other screenmode
    than PAL or NTSC. Unfortunately it failed to operate on a graphic card!
    The problem was that Ladder wrote its graphics data directly into the
    bitplanes. Having not much expirience with such stuff I would guess it
    was a speed issue with the old chipset and the 68000. Then I had to much
    spare time and finally succeed to rewrite the game. Now it uses a system
    function to draw into the screens bitmap. Therefore it should work on
    graphic cards, at least I hope so :-)
    
FEATURES

    - Amiga, CP/M, old, multitasking, game, fun
    - should run on any amiga w/o a graphic card
    - needs at least 1.2 of the operating system
    - comes with a level editor (only native gfx)

INSTALLATION

    Installing Ladder is fairly easy. Copy the whole game directory to a
    location on your harddisk. Thats all :-)
    The program doesn't require any additional assign.

USAGE

    Ladder can be started either from CLI/Shell or Workbench. To start Ladder
    from the Workbench doubleclick on its icon. To start Ladder from the shell
    simply type:

      1> Ladder

    followed by a return.

    Ladder can be started with a name for an external level file. If no
    argument is given Ladder will use the internal levels.
    A level filename can specified from workbench too. Here one has to supply
    the tooltype LEVEL with the name for the level file to use.

    NOTE: This feature has been disabled because it could easily crash the
          computer! The problem is that one cannot really check whether one
          loads a valid level file or not. Anyway I never needed this feature
          but its still there.

GAMEPLAY

    There are 7 levels, played in this sequence:

    1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567

    If you successful complete this sequence the game starts all over, only
    faster this time (of course only if the difficulty can be raised).

    The game is controlled over the keyboard:

    Space  = jump, use cursor-keys or num-keypad 2,4,6,8 to move around.
    Ctrl-c = return from game play to main menu
    Escape = (a=abort,c=continue)

                                                 |
    Tip: You can 'stand still' on top of a wall  |  just jump on it and hit
         any key (other than space or cursor-keys).


    The game writes a high-score file to the current directory. This is only
    done if the highscore has actually changed.

HISTORY

    1.1 - removed direct bitplane write -> should work with gfx cards now
        - now uses timer.device for delays (not quite accurate though :-/
        - nearly all functions rewritten
        - does proper cleanup now
        - source included

    1.0 - initial release
