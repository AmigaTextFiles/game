No mice were harmed during the making of this game.  Can I go now...?

NOT QUITE.  HERE COMES THE GUIDE TO GETTING IT ALL UP AND RUNNING...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Right then, so do you have an Amiga computer with at least 1MB of RAM?  Then keep reading.  If you don't, then sorry, your name's not on the list, you're not coming in.  I mean, have you seen the state of your trainers?

What happens next largely depends on what archive you've downloaded.  If you're reading this from the floppy disk, then simply reboot your machine and ta-da... your Amiga will sing, dance and make tea (oh, alright then, the game will load automatically - just sit back and relax, anyway).

If you've unpacked the lha archive onto your hard disk, then you'll be pleased to know you don't have to do anything else other than double-click on the Maxwell icon and you're up and running.  No additional libraries or fonts need be installed.

Right.  Now it's time for the fun stuff.

BASED ON AN INCREDIBLE TRUE STORY...
------------------------------------

Honest.  It's a tear-jerker so have those tissues at the ready.

Maxwell the cool blue mouse (who insists on wearing sunglasses and a backpack) had just woken up after a very pleasant night's sleep. He was excited because just yesterday, he had gone and bought a fabulous new Amiga game. He had given the game pride of place in his special disk box ready to be played as soon as he got up that morning.

But disaster had struck.  The disk wasn't there.  The box was empty.  It hadn't been left in his Amiga's disk drive.  In fact, it was nowhere to be seen. "Oh, botheration!  My floppy diskette appears to have gone missing.  This is a most unfortunate turn of events", is something Maxwell didn't quite say but as it's before the watershed... well, that was the gist of it.

There's only one real explanation - someone must have got in, somehow, and stolen it. But how?  Who?  Why?  In the absence of anything worthwhile to do, Maxwell decides to go on a little adventure to try and retrieve his game.  After all, it's a small village, and there are one or two shady characters lurking about.  Not everyone likes Maxwell and indeed, not everyone likes the Amiga...

"Now, what did I do with my door key?  Typical, the one night I don't go out drinking heavily and listening to mouse, sorry, house music at the local club is the night my key goes missing..."

WAS THAT REALLY WORTH SPENDING FOUR PARAGRAPHS ON?
--------------------------------------------------

Of course.  Now you know the background and the task ahead for poor Maxwell, and now it's time to put his little world to rights by leaping on platforms, deftly dodging strange little creatures and talking to the village's inhabitants, perhaps doing them a favour or two along the way.

To start the game, simply press fire on the title screen.  You'll be treated to a couple of intro screens before your quest begins.  Note that the game also supports CD32 joypads - press right at the title screen to use a CD32 pad, left for a normal joystick and then press fire (or Red).

Here, then, is where you'll want to know how to perform the various functions needed to do well: (CD32 pad controls in brackets)

Left and right - move Maxwell, er, left and right.  Also used to scroll through the inventory items when the inventory is activated.

Fire (Red button) - jump

Up (Green button) - talks to other characters if you're in contact with them, and provides an inspection of one or two objects, too.  All of the text will appear in the grey box and can be advanced by pressing fire (Red).

Down (Yellow button) - Picks up any items you're hovering over and switches control to the inventory. The top right of the screen shows the items Maxwell currently has in his possession.  Moving left and right at this point will move the red cursor and the text in the grey box will change to show the item's description. From here, you can either drop an item either in a general area, use an item on a character or other object or just exit without dropping anything, all by pressing the fire button (Red) when you're ready.

P (Play/Pause button) - pause/unpause the action.  You can also press fire (Red) to unpause.

Esc (Both shoulder buttons) - quit back to the titles (doing this on the title sequence exits altogether).

On your travels, you will also find several annoying creatures and insects roaming around.  Coming into contact with these will cause you to lose a health point (represented by the little hearts shown on the top panel) and losing all of these will cause Maxwell to lose a life (represented by the little Maxwell heads also on the top panel).  When you lose a life, you'll restart at the last point he touched the ground and will be invulnerable for a few seconds.  Keep in mind that anything flamey will also hurt and as for water... well, this mouse isn't known for his swimming ability so no amount of health points will help you here...

HAVE YOU FINISHED NOW?

Music was taken from whatever public domain source I could grab them from.  Currently I haven't got any music produced specifically for the game but if I do get a couple of MED tunes made up, I'll update the archives with them and credit them appropriately.

Do follow our progress at http://www.facebook.com/RemainderSoftware and email me at grahamhumphrey1986@hotmail.com with any feedback and so on.

Big thanks to the guys above for their invaluable help and encouragement in getting this demo finished, I am incredibly grateful to them for their hard work, enthusiasm and ideas.  Without them this wouldn't have happened.

I GUESS THIS IS THE SELF-INDULGENT, RAMBLY BIT COMING UP...
-----------------------------------------------------------

Damn right.

Maxwell was started way back in the halcyon days of November 2012.  This was several months after Downfall had been released and I was keen to work on something a bit more ambitious.  I had always wanted to write a Dizzy-style arcade adventure featuring character interaction, puzzles to solve and a large world to explore, as well as more than a couple of elements of the old-fashioned 8-bit platform games that were so popular on the ZX Spectrum and the like.  This seemed like the perfect chance, so Predseda (artist on Downfall) and myself began work on this new project.

It only took a month or so to get a very basic skeleton up and running.  Predseda had drawn me some placeholder tiles and I came up with a small map which you could roam around, jumping about and falling and all that happy stuff.  But I hit a few issues with collision, picking things up and some really tedious bugs that I got bored of so I put it on the backburner from about January 2013, not properly resuming again until about September/October that year when suddenly things took off.

We had a new, larger map, we placed some enemies to avoid, some water to drown in, a character or two to interact with... everything was working and we had a basic engine in place.  We then bolted a storyline and some more items and people onto what we had and before we knew it, our proof of concept demo became a little game in its own right and the momentum and enthusiasm gained from each little milestone reached (even from little things like the conversations popping up in the panel, characters giving you new items and so on) took us to the edge of completion in January 2014.

Then things dropped off, with real life getting in the way and some serious challenges lay ahead in getting some new graphics for our map.  It was all a bit too... well, dark and featureless.  Many months passed with little activity until about September when Chris Clarke - creator of the excellent amigapd.com website, book author and programmer - was keen to get involved in graphic creation.  So after some discussions, he started to draw some new tiles for the map, and did more, and more, and more, until out of pretty much nothing we had a full, colourful set of graphics to use.  Quickly I implemented these, and any changes I wanted were patiently dealt with and also put in.  He also knocked together some new enemies for me to use and - along with Predseda - had his own influence on the game's style and features.  Predseda then came up with some lovely presentation screens and before we knew it, we had a proper small game, and a nice demo to show off our engine in preparation for a bigger game.

If the graphical style seems a bit disjointed and inconsistent, then you now know why, but it's certainly colourful and nicely drawn.  The only thing we haven't had in time is some music to go with it so I've chucked a couple of tunes in that I thought fit the mood of the game, which isn't ideal but it's nothing that can't be solved later.

This is only a demo, believe it or not - we have a full game we want to start working on which will use this engine, but undoubtedly with some tweaks (like a nicer status panel, some new bad guys and animation for the non-player characters) and a level-based approach (like Crystal Kingdom Dizzy) which will see four separate maps used to advance the story (no relation to this storyline by the way).  This will take quite some time to plan and prepare this but as there aren't any real techincal issues, we can concentrate on getting the game design just how we want it.

If you've read this far, well done.  I will try to keep people posted with progress as much as I can, and I hope we do our ideas justice enough to release physical copies on both disk and CD-ROM, if people want it.  Let me know what you think, and thanks for reading and playing.
