SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~`~~~~~
"Phuk The World" was created on an un-expanded Amiga 1200.
The game has been tested only on an Amiga 1200.
Please note the this game requires nearly 2MB Chip to load because all the
code, music, sound FX and grafix are pre-loaded so there's no more disc
access needed throughout the game ( unless you save/load games! )
I have attempted to degrade the game so that it will work on a 1 mb
machine but with no success - The game map is to big and has too much
graphics !!

If you are having trouble getting "Phuk The World" to run on your set-up
then contact me at the address at the end of this doc or at the address on
the 'Info' page in the game.

THE STORY
~~~~~~~~~ 

Doctor Badds was working on his latest development in his sex lab. His
creation was nearing completion. It was a knob with a ming of its own ready
to save his friends and solve their personal problems. All that Doctor Badds
needed to do was connect the sack resistor to the harding tissue and the
creation was complete.

The knob shuddered under the thrusts of Dr. Badds penis as he forced himself
into the ignition start hole. Then the 'gruff' of the knobs engine groaned
out through the lab and the worlds first problem solving penis was born !!!

Badds stood above the penis and looked down, I command you to solve the
phucked up worlds of my friends! And within a small second the knob spoke
"Fuck you, my twatish creator!". Doctor Badds looked at the knob in
astonishment and then he commanded "Do what I fuckin' say you bastard!" The
knob bent slightly and replied "Yes my master, bater."

Doctor Badds carried the knob over to the staircase leading to the world
above. "Now remember you can't breath under water and you can only
re-generate yourself four times. Oh and good luck!, my little prick." said
Dr. Baddick sadly.

The knob bounced happily up and up the stair case to be greeted by a
blindingly bright world with a rainbow sky and walking turtles (!?)

AIM OF THIS GAME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well if you have ever played Dizzy (Spit!,spit!) then you should have the
general idea. Wonder around the large map discovering all sorts of sick,
perverted and strange characters and then discover what their problem is. Now
you gotta go and find objects that may help them. Simple really!

CONTROLS
~~~~~~~~
The game is played with a joystick or a joypad (if you want) in the 'GAME'
port.

INSIDE INFO
~~~~~~~~~~~
For the people who are actually bothering to read this document then here's
a quick bit of info.  A cheat mode has been built into the game so that you
can move around all the locations and give your knob some more lives.
All that is needed to activate the cheat is a press of a key during the
startup of the game.  The key you have to press may not be on all Amiga
keyboards so beware!
