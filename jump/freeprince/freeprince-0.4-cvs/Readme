Open source engine for Prince Of Persia Dos version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a compiled version of the latest cvs release,
It's very alpha and there don't appear to be any wall detection.
Honestly it's quite useless as it is, it's more of a toy really.

To run the engine you will need the files from the DOS version and
a 'level.dat' file,without that it will most likely crash (ok it will).

(keep files and engine in same dir)

some of the Ingame keys:

ctrl+g = save
ctrl + j = joystick
ctrl + k = keyboard
ctrl + a = reload level
ctrl + l = load
ctrl + q = quit
ctrl + r = goto title screen 
ctrl + v = show version
shift + l = pass level
shift + t = add energy
shift + s = add hit point
shift + + = add time
shift + - = reduce time
