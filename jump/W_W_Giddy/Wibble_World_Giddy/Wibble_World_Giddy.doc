Wibble World Giddy

About the game:

This game is a parody of the Codemasters Dizzy series. It also features
some jokes based on topical news at the time.

- Sellafield (UK nuclear plant) were burying their waste.
- CFCs used in spray cans were being blamed for the hole in the ozone
  layer and causing global warming.
- The UK rave scene was in full swing, attended and produced by students.
  Students are poor and smelly, so instead of getting an Amiga A500, they
  buy the cheaper Atari ST (which also has MIDI ports for music, wow!)
- Tab Clear was relaunched as a caffiene filled drink that tastes a bit
  like Coke, but it's a clear liquid. Ooh! Aah!

Instructions:

Press left and right on the joystick to walk left and right. Press fire to
jump.

Do not touch the animals or water, or you will lose energy. Eat the
beetroots to restore your energy. Collect coins to buy the item at the shop
(glue for 30 coins, spade for 50 coins). Walk over objects to collect them.

When you reach an obstacle, use the correct item to destroy it. To use an
item, hold down on the joystick and press fire. Now press left and right to
cycle through your inventory. Finally, press fire to use an item.
