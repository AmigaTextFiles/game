[HISTORY]
Once upon a time ...

A well known penguin called Tux, was living
quitely in his polar country.

Unfortunately, some day, watching at its
XawTV, a bad new alerted him :

Some areas of the earth were so polluted
that all the animals (for example the
moles) were running away.
However these moles, muted by having
eaten so much GMOs, were colonizing
climatic belts where nobody would have
expected them to live !

Alerted, our friend decided to have a
walk around his territory, but the evil was
already here, a giant mole-hill was
installed nearby !

The mole invasion had begun, a strong
reaction was necessary ...
