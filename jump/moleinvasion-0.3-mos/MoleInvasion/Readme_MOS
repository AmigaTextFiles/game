This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).

For further information take a look at the the original website at
http://moleinvasion.tuxfamily.org/

PS: For a quick help, start the game from shell with parameter "-h".

PPS: If you want to have background music, download the .ogg files
from http://moleinvasion.tuxfamily.org/download/snd/ and put them into
the Progdir:snd/ directory
