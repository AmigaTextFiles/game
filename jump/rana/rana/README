Please note that the game in this version (commit
debb0bc36a21aeac6e694724552d007ef44a8a46) only supports joystick input. You
cannot start the game without joystick emulation enabled in UAE or a physical
joystick connected!

The binary was compiled by me after discussing this game on the Amiga-News.de
forums.
