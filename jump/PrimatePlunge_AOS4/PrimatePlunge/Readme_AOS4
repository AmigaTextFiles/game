This is just a quick port to MorphOS from HAK (hak@vip.at).
...And an ever faster recompile for AmigaOS 4.0 by Spot / Up Rough.
Thanks to HAK for doing the hard work.

For further information read the original README or take a look at the
the original website at http://www.aelius.com/primateplunge/

PS: Due to the fact that the MOS version of SDL_Mixer library doesn't
support MIDI there is no title music.

Note, This doesn't apply to the AmigaOS 4.0 version, i converted all
sounds to OGG to save some valuable disk space, and I also converted
the intro tune from midi to OGG, so the AmigaOS 4.0 version is 
complete. Enjoy the beautiful graphics and the kick ass gameplay!
