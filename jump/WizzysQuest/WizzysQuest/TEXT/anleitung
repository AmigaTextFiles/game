The aim of the game is to reach the Dragon. All 50 levels must be completed
 to do this. In every Level there is Wizzy, his Master and one door
It is your task to bring the master to the door without running into 
one of the many, many monsters that you will meet.  To achieve this you
can make stone blocks appear and also dissapear, you may also use some
of the many objects available.#
The joystick functions are:#
Left/Right           -> Wizzy Walks#
Up/Diagonal Up       -> Wizzy Jumps#
Fire and Left/Right  -> Wizzy Builds a block sideways#
Fire and Up          -> Wizzy Builds a block diagonally#
Fire and Down        -> Wizzy Builds a block diagonally#
You may therefore only build blocks Left, Right or Diagonally
and not directly Upwards or Downwards.
When building a block the fire button should be pressed before the direction
is selected. understood?, no?, doesn't matter, try it out and you'll see. 
The many objects such as: Keys, Locks, Diamonds,   
Lightening rods, Guards, Rainbow doors, Rainbow bridges, 
Shields, One way streets etc. are there for you to try out!
The first five levels are very easy and serve really just to warm the
player up. From level 30 you are in the difficult stages, levels 40-45
are extreemly hard, after that its easier again. After every five levels
or so a Scroll will appear with a Level Password, this is so that you don't
have to start from scratch every time you boot the game.
With this Password you can open a secret door and enter the game at the
level for which you found the Password last.%
Some keys during the game have functions:#
Pressing <HELP> brings up a help page.#
<P> Pauses the game.#
<S> speeds up the game, for some reason that I dont understand it runs
at different speeds depending on the amount of memory in the system being
used.#
<ESC> ends the level if you get into a position from which there is no way
out, this costs a life!.#
When all three lives are gone you may enter your name in the high score list
that is, if you've scored enough.  The high score will only be saved if: 
the disk is NOT write protected and then only if you exit using the
ADIOS AMIGAS option from the menu.%
Special Note: It really is worth playing to the end,
The procedure SHOWDOWN is the longest procedure of the game,
it is a couple of hundred lines of code which was frustrating to write
especially when you think that most people wont get to see it!.#
This game was developed from may-aug 1990 on an Amiga 1000 with 2.5
MByte of memory. It had to run on every Amiga with 512K and be compatable
with Kickstart 1.2 and 1.3, it was written in GFABASIC 3.03 and was compiled
with GFA-Compiler1. The pictures were done with DPAINT III. The sprites and
Levels were done on my own Object-editor. Sounds were produced with
Perfectsound Software and the CADE-Digitizer, Music with MED2.00e von Teijo
Kinnunen who finnished it on 1281990.%
