Yeaa well, the german version of this story is a bit long winded
so here's the short one.
In the days of old when magic was alive and hero's still volenteered
in a small village called Rumpelsfeld.......oh look, lets put it this
way:> a dragon pinched a virgin from Rumpelsfeld and if you want to
get your nuts off on a virgin, go rescue her.#  
Phew why are the krauts so long winded.
