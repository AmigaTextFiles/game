@node Install "Installing JSW '97"

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  ->  FLOPPY INSTALL:
	Simply unpack the archive onto a blank floppy disk. Make sure
        the disk is bootable, if unsure goto a workbench shell, put
        the disk in DF0: drive then type 'Install DF0:'

  ->  HD INSTALL:
        Unpack the archive to any location on your hard drive and then
	run the JSW97_HD_Installer program, this will copy all needed
        fonts and libraries to your normally assigned FONTS: and
        LIBS: directories, usually located on your boot drive.

    
      * If any of the files needed by JSW '97 are not present then
        the game will not run, and you will be alerted which file
        is missing.

@node Game "Playing the Game"

The Game
~~~~~~~~
      When you run JSW '97 you can skip the intro credits by pressing
      the Escape key. Once it has loaded you may redefine your keys.
      The default keys are Q=LEFT, W=RIGHT, SPACE=JUMP, P=PAUSE.

      The aim of the game is to collect all 200 objects which are
      scattered around the 190 screens, which will then allow you
      to enter the palace. Generally anything that moves will kill
      you and any object that flashes you must collect. You can fall
      a maximum of 4 blocks without being killed and jump and maximum
      width of 5 blocks.

      Some of the screens are easy, and some are hard, also look out
      for hidden rooms and passages.

      If you manage to get onto the high score table then make sure
      you keep your disk write enabled, if running from floppy.

      While you are playing the game you can multitask by pressing
      both 'Left Amiga Key' and 'A' together. This is so you can
      run another task at the same time, or use the internet etc..

      GOOD LUCK!

@node Bugs "Known Bugs"

Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~

      Many people who have large amount of fastram (16/32mb) have
      reported not being able to run the game, this may be okay in v1.1

      Amiga users with accelerators have commented that the jump
      routine is too fast, again this should be improved in v1.1

      You cannot redefine 3 keys that are on the same row, or willy
      cannot jump diagnally. The reason for this is still unknown.

      There was a huge bug in v1.1 with the joystick routine, this
      was due to the joystick causing timing problems in the jump
      routine. Joystick support has been temporarly removed, but will
      be added as soon as this problem is corrected.
