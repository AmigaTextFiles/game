As of 26/10/2004 the following are required:

*Graphics need improving, particularly tiles-sets
*More levels are required
*More enemies are required
*Spells associated with each rune must be implemented
-- Main spell needed 'far sight' that will allow the player
   to view parts of the levels without travelling there. This
   would allow players to look down pits before jumping. Of course
   the further you look the magic it would use up

*More music needs to be written
*Level editor needs to be improved
