Njam Changes:

version 1.21    (changes from preview version 1.05 included)

New features:

- 92 new levels in 7 new levelsets
- 50 bonus points that can be collected on screen
- new skin by Thorsten Kohnhorst (http://kiki.sourceforge.net)
- Bonus-life timer is now variable depending on number of cookies
- a new levelset named: EASY, with 10 levels for beginners
- Added "Are you sure?" when exiting/saving in level editor.
- nice picture when player(s) complete all levels.
- option to swap levels in level editor (to change the order)
- Game options: any skin can be selected as default
- Enhanced some of the graphics (freeze, victory, pause, etc.)
- Freezer now works cumulative i.e. when collecting new freezer
  while ghosts are already frozen, the freezing-time is added
- Perl scripts to manipulate levels as human readable text files
  contributed by Jalal A. Elhusseini
- version number is show in the main screen

Bugfixes:
- Number of levels in cooperative games wasn't calculated right,
  so the last level was played twice. Fixed.


version 1.00

New features:

- Integrated level editor
- High-Score list
- New game element: Teleports
- 10 new duel levels, making it 20 in basic set now.
- Some of the existing levels are redesigned.
- Rules:  There were (non-fair) situations in duel games, when the player
          closest to the juice gets it, and then just goes to another juice
		  trying to "protect" it (i.e. just stands on it, not allowing others
		  to take it). That's why the new game rule is added. If a player runs
		  over juice while he has active superpower, the juice vanishes and
		  shows up in the opposite corner of the screen. This only applies to
		  duel games.
- Added command-line option (-d) to run via DGA driver on Linux, which makes
  the game a lot faster.
- On Linux Njam changes working directory to the one where the executable is,
  so it can easily be run by, for example: /usr/local/games/njam/njam without
  need to alter the sources. This should simplify making of packages for
  various Linux distributions.
- Inno Setup script added to the sources, so anyone can build setup.exe for
  MS Windows port.

Bugfixes:

- It isn't anymore possible to start network games without any players selected.
- Display doesn't anymore show previous frames when using hardware surfaces.
- The driple-ding sound can now be heard multiple times if needed. It happens
  sometimes that a player eats enough ghosts to regain the chance to win a
  level (which is now marked with coughing sound) and the triple-ding will be
  heard as many times as it needs to be.
- The driple-ding sound was heard no matter if sound fx were turned off in game
  options. Fixed.
- When more than 2 players are playing a duel game, the triple-ding sound was
  not played at right moment (it was played after the first bar turns white...
  instead of: when all bars turn white). Fixed.
- The number of levels for multiplayer wasn't calculated right, so some levels
  were never played. Fixed.
- Fixed one small memory leak (memory for one resource wasn't freed on exit).

version 0.96

- change: Added bonus for cooperative games. If player(s) finish the level
          before the bonus-time runs out, they are awarded one life.
- change: Added nice "game over" pictures, contributed by Djordje Matic.
- change: Added two new original skins. The skins are now turned on by default.
- change: In duel games after the player gets killed by a ghost, when he shows
          up on screen, he gets invisibility for a short period of time, which
          prevents ghosts from slamming him right away.
- change: Added level 20 (final level) in single/cooperative mode
- change: Added few nice sound effects
- change: Added command-line option to use hardware or software rendering
- bugfix: Removed possibility to do: ESC, ESC, SPACE and restart the level.

version 0.95

- change: Networking works. 2-4 players can play on two machines. Free for all.
          I have tested in on LAN, haven't tried the Internet.
- change: There are now 5 ghosts in single player and cooperative mode and 8
          ghosts in duel mode. The game was just too hard to play.
- change: Added SDL_image library and converted big images to .jpg format so
          the whole game takes less space (especially important for downloads)
          Also, reduced .exe and .dll sizes, so the download is only about
		  1.2MB now.
- change: Added possibility to do: make install
          Contributed by Martin Willemoes Hansen.
- change: Added makefile for Borland's Free C++ Compiler.
- change: Changed level 9 in cooperative mode (had some not-so-nice dead-end).
- bugfix: Settings selected in options menu are now saved to configuration file
          and loaded when the game is started, so the game remembers user's
          settings.
- bugfix: Fixed problems when compiling with gcc 2.95


version 0.91

- bugfix: in version 0.90 once two player game is started, the single player
          game doesn't work anymore, i.e. it always starts the two player game.
          This is now fixed.
- bugfix: in version 0.90 it was possible to go to next level by giving away
          one life (press: ESC, ESC, SPACE). Now it is not possible.
- bugfix: in version 0.90 it was possible to go to next level by giving away
          one life (let the ghost eat you, press ESC, SPACE). Fixed.
- change: I have reduced target speed from 33.3 to 30fps since game run too
          fast and was really hard to play in non-duel mode.
- change: Added current level indicator
- change: Added frames_per_second indicator
- change: Changed some flags in SetVideo mode so Linux version works faster now
- change: added nice picture of a killed ghost (the "desperate eyes" ;)
- bugfix: ghosts didn't go after players if they are too far from each other
          (on the opposite side of the screen). Fixed.
