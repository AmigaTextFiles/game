- fix some of the graphics and make some nice effects (sparks and stuff...)
- rewrite routines that handle stuff in main menu
  - script routine: do not load data from file all the time
  - both routines:  only update the regions of screen that are changed
- themable ghosts


Well, none of it really. This is probably the last version of Njam I'm going
to make, so if someone wishes to continue the development, they can pick
any goals they want.
