<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">There are two types of game: Duel
and Cooperative. <br>
<a name="duel"></a><br>
In <font color="#000099"><b>Duel games</b></font> the goal is to win four
games before other players do. To win a game, you have to be the player with
most points. The points are gained by eating the <a href="#cookies">cookies</a>
and <a href="#ghosts">ghosts</a>. Each cookie is worth one point, each ghost
is worth 5 points. If two players have the same points, the game is a draw.
Eating ghosts is a tough task, you can do it only when you have <a
 href="#juice">superpower</a> and even then the ghosts will try to run away.
If the ghost kills a player, it's no big deal, he will revive, and show up
on the screen few seconds later at <a href="#door">the door</a>. But be careful,
if ghosts eat you too often,&nbsp; your opponent might eat just about everything
while you wait.<br>
<br>
The points are shown at the right part of <a href="ingame.png"
 title="Shows game screen (70kB)">screen</a>. They are represented by vertical
bars which have the same colors as players. Under each bar, there is a thin
grey line which shows how much points would player have if he eats all cookies
that are on screen. When that thin line turns white, some of the players
has enough points to win, and game can go to next level. Also, a triple-ding sound
is heard at that moment. In fact, you can press ESC key anytime to finish current
level, and the player with most points
at that moment will be declared winner. Note not to press ESC when there
are still some superpowers left, since some of the players can take it and
<a href="doc2.html#gps">kill many ghosts</a> and gain a lot of points. However,
if there isn't any superpower on the screen and the line turns white, just hit
ESC, don't bother to finish the level.<br>
<a name="nonduel"></a><br>
In <font color="#000099"><b>Cooperative games</b></font> players don't compete,
but cooperate. The goal of each level is to eat <b>all</b> cookies, and then
advance to next level, until they complete the whole game. The players share
a number of lives, and if ghost kills any of the players, one life is lost.
When all lives are lost, the game is over. When playing in two, it's good
idea to help each other by driving ghosts away. During each level players
have a chance to win a life if
they complete the level before the bonus-time runs out. The remaining time is
shown at right part of the screen (vertical red bar).</font><br>

The Ghosts</big></b></font><br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Ghosts are enemies of the players.
They run around the screen and try to capture the player and kill him. If player
has a <a href="#juice">superpower</a>, then they run away from him,
since superpower kills them. Ghosts spawn at the <a href="#ghosthouse">pentagram</a>
and run around. When a ghost dies, he returns to pentagram to recuperate,
and after a while he's out again. There are three types of ghosts, which
are recognized by their color and behavior:</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000099" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Shaddy </b></font>&nbsp;
&nbsp; <img src="shaddy.gif" alt="" width="23" height="23"
 align="middle"><br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Shaddy is a blind ghost. He just
moves randomly, and often makes turns at crossroads. He never
turns back the same way he came, except sometimes when he hits the wall and
forgets himself. However, he can feel the presence of superpower so he will
run like hell from it, just like the other ghosts do. It is said that the
worst thing that can happen to you is to be hunted by 2 or 3 shaddys since
they are so unpredictable. Only the most skilled players who have a lot of
luck can survive that kind of situations..</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#ff0000" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Hunter</b></font>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="hunter.gif" alt="" width="23"
 height="23" align="middle"><br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Hunter is the pursuit ghost. Something
like a guard. He patrols around, and always goes straight, that is, he never
turns sideways on cross-roads. If hunter spots you, he will turn your way at once,
and hunt you down. If you are far enough, you still have a chance to hide
behind some corner and avoid him. By exposing yourself to the hunter, he
becomes your follower so you can use him as effective weapon. Hunters are
most attracted by nearest player at their sight, so one can hide around the
corner for a moment, just enough for hunter to start chasing someone else.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font color="#ff6600">Assassin</font></b></font>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="assassin.gif" alt="" width="24" height="23"
 align="middle"><br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Assassin is the most dangerous
creature. It just moves around like a </font><font color="#000099"
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>shaddy</b></font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">, but if he sees you, he turns to </font><font
 color="#ff0000" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>hunter</b></font><font
 face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> at once. If he loses you, he continues
to run straight (just like hunter does) until he hits the wall and then goes
back to shaddy mode. You can make assassin your follower too, but take care.</font><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"></font><br>
<br>
<div align="center"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><big><img
 src="thinline.gif" alt="" width="583" height="9" align="top"></big></b></font><br>
</div>
<br>
<a name="levelres"></a><br>
<b><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Level resources &amp; stuff</font></big></b><br>
<br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size=-1><b>Note</b>: game elements look different with different skins,
as you can see <a href=doc2.html#skins>on this page</a>.</font>
<br><br>
<a name="cookies"></a><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Cookie &nbsp; &nbsp;<img
 src="cookie.gif" alt="" width="30" height="30" align="middle"></b><br>
<br>
Cookies are the goal of the game. Each cookie gives you one point, and the
player with most points is the winner. You can also gain points by eating
ghosts, where each eaten ghost gives you 5 points. If players have even points
in a <a href="doc.html#duel">duel game</a>, the game is a draw, and there
is no winner.<br>
<br>
<a name="juice"></a><br>
<b>Super-power (juice) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="juice.gif" alt=""
 width="30" height="30" align="middle"></b><br>
<br>
When the player drinks this cool juice, he gains superpower which enables
him to eat anything that moves: ghosts and even other players. Superpower
lasts for a short period of time, and you can see small numbers 3,2,1...
around player as superpower is about to run out. One cannot eat another player
if the other has the superpower, nor can collect another juice if he has
superpower already. In duel games, if player would try to take the superpower when he
already has it, it will disappear and show up in the opposite corner of the screen.
When ghosts see the player with superpower they run away,
unless he is also <a href="doc.html#invisible">invisible</a> at the same time,
which is a great combination if you want to kill a lot of ghosts. Player
that has superpower is glowing red.<br>
<br>
<a name="invisible"></a><br>
<b>Invisibility &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="invisible.gif" alt="" width="30"
 height="30" align="middle"></b><br>
<br>
As the name suggests, you are invisible to ghosts. Since shaddy is already
blind, this does not affect him. When invisible, you can eat ghosts (if you
have superpower) easily, since they will not run away. Invisibility lasts
three times longer than superpower. Player which is invisible to ghosts is
glowing yellow.<br>
<br>
<a name="teleport"></a><br>
<b>Teleport &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="teleport.gif" alt="" width="30"
 height="30" align="middle"></b><br>
<br>
When a player walks into teleport, he is moved to one of the other teleports
on screen. Teleport destination is chosen randomly. The player keeps his
moving direction, and keeps moving, unless there is an obstacle in front of him.
Ghosts just fly over teleports, so teleports can nicely be used to avoid ghosts
when in deep trouble. <br>
<br>
<a name="freezer"></a><br>
<b>Freezer &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="freezer.gif" alt="" width="30"
 height="30" align="middle"></b><br>
<br>
This cute gizmo freezes the ghosts for a short period of time. It lasts twice
as long as superpower. Even though that ghosts cannot move during that time,
they can still eat you, so beware.<br>
<br>
<a name="trap"></a><br>
<b>Trap &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="trap.gif" alt="" width="30"
 height="30" align="middle"></b><br>
<br>
Trap is a spot on the ground where the player can pass only once. After that,
the trap closes, and wall shows up at that place. You may try to close the
trap and go back in same direction where you came from, but it may kill you.
Ghosts are immune to traps, they do not activate neither can die of it. When
a trap kills you, you are dead just like the ghosts got you. Only difference
is that you have to wait twice longer to show up. Also, if the trap kills you,
you will not lose a life.<br>
<br>
<a name="door"></a><br>
<b>The Door &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="door.gif" alt="" width="30"
 height="30" align="middle"></b><br>
<br>
When the player is killed he leaves the game for a short period of time. After
that time passes he comes back, and enters the game through the door. There
is always one door on the screen. If the player is slammed by a trap the
delay of showing up doubles, so be patient.<br>
<br>
<a name="ghosthouse"></a><br>
<b>Pentagram (ghost-house) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="ghinactive.gif"
 alt="" width="30" height="30" align="middle"> &nbsp;<img
 src="ghactive.gif" alt="" width="30" height="30" align="middle"></b><br>
<br>
This is where ghosts come out from. Inactive pentagram is colored black.
When ghost is about to came out of it, it turns yellow, so beware. Wandering
around yellow pentagram is generally not a good idea, unless you have <a
 href="doc.html#juice">superpower</a> on you.</font>

<b><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Game controls and command

<br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Player one (yellow player) uses
cursor keys (up, down, left and right arrow) to move. Player two (green)
uses keys R, F, D and G respectively. Players actually don't move, they just
set the direction for their character, and as soon there is free space in
that direction, he starts moving. Once you start moving, you cannot stop
unless you hit the wall. When you host the network game, the controls are
the same, but when you join it, then you're controlling players three and
four (red and dark-green) with these same controls.<br>
<br>
Other keys are P for pausing the game, and ESC to exit the game. If you press
ESC in <a href="#nonduel">cooperative game</a>, players will lose one life.
In <a href="#duel">duel games</a>, current game ends, and the player with
most points at that moment is a winner. This is especially useful when there
are some cookies left on screen, but they are impossible to reach. <br>
<br>
The following command line options are available: <br>
<b>-w</b> &nbsp; starts the game in <b>window</b> (as opposed to fullscreen)<br>
<b>-h</b> &nbsp; uses <b>hardware</b> surfaces if possible (game runs faster, but
there were problems with some graphic cards, so software surfaces are default)<br>
<b>-d</b> &nbsp; use <b>DGA</b> driver on Linux (much faster, but must run as root).<br>
