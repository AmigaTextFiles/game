                              JUMPING JACK
                              ============

Jumping Jack is a 4 way scrolling game which uses a bitmap larger than the
display and `pans' the display over the large bitmap.

To control Jumping Jack use the joystick. The fire button will make him
jump.

The idea of the game is to collect enough coins and then jump in the exit.

To collect coins position Jack under a block with a question mark on it and
jump up. When you have collected enough coins a little jingle will play and
the number of coins in the score bar will turn red. At this point can jump
down the exit, which is a block with an `E' on it, and complete the level.
If you fall into an exit without collecting enough coins you will lose a
life and have to start again!

There are some blocks which look as if they are made of bricks, hitting
these with your head with smash them. Also there are some plain blocks
which will fall down when you bump them with your head. Watch out for the
spikes, if you land on these you will lose a life.

Some blocks are hidden and will only appear when you hit them with your
head!!! These can be quite tricky to find!!!

If Jumping Jack falls to far he will die.

If you get stuck you can press the escape key to start the level again
although you will lose a life.

Pressing `P' will pause the game. Press it again to restart.

The Editor
----------

Pressing the space key during the game will put you into the editor.

You may make up your own levels and save them to disc and then play them by
using the editor.

The cursor will display the current block that you can move around the map
with the joystick and place into it by pressing the fire button. To change
the type of block use the plus and minus keys (unshifted). If you want to
delete a block position the cursor over it and press `d'. To clear the
whole level press `c'. IMPORTANT: EVERY LEVEL MUST HAVE A BORDER OF NORMAL
BLOCKS ALL THE WAY AROUND IT!! If you neglect to do this the game will very
probably crash, SO DO IT!!!

If you want to make a block hidden position the cursor over it and press
`h'. To get rid of hidden blocks you can either delete them with the `d'
key or just place another block over it.

When you are happy with your level press `s' to save it. A message will
appear saying `LEVEL #?' and then number 0. Change the 0 to the number you
want your level to be and press return. The level will save and the game
will exit. YOU MUST RUN THE GAME AGAIN AFTER SAVING A LEVEL!!!

IMPORTANT: There are 4 levels on the disc. You MUST number you levels from
5 upwards. You cannot save over levels 1 to 4. When the game starts it will
load the file `map1.bin' for level 1. It will then load `map2.bin' followed
by `map3.bin' and `map4.bin'. It will keep increasing the number in the
file name until it cannot find a file by that name in which case it begins
again at level 1. I.E. if there is a file called `map5.bin' this will be
loaded after level 4. If, however, there is a `map6.bin' but NO `map5.bin'
the game will restart after level 4 as it could not find level 5.

Well, that's it! Have Fun!!
