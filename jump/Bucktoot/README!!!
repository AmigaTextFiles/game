Important info before you play Bucktooth Bob:

	1) It's an AMOS program.  If you're running it solely
	   off of floppy you might have trouble because AMOS
	   likes ALL the libraries etc to be present.  If in doubt,
	   just copy the whole BucktoothBob directory onto a fully
	   loaded Workbench disk.
	2) It's a memory hog ... I don't know how much it uses but I
	   know it uses a LOT.  It can multitask by the way, just hit
	   Amiga-A.
	3) It loads lots of files.  If you're using a floppy you might
	   want to copy the whole directory into RAM: and run it from
	   there (assuming you have enough ram).  I have two megs
	   and I can run it from RAM: (it goes really fast).
	4) It's kind of slow in spots ... sorry .. this is really
	   AMOS's fault (although sort of mine too).  If you have a 
	   500 it should run okay, though.
	5) It's NTSC only (sorry PAL guys).

It also needs the following files in it's directory or it WON'T run:
	
	bucktoothintromus.abk
	bucktoothintro0.iff
	bucktoothintro1.iff
	bucktoothtitlemus.abk
	bucktoothtitle.iff
	bucktoothbob0.iff
	bucktoothbob1.iff
	bucktoothendmus.abk

That's 8 files altogether.  The program will tell you if one is missing.
Report any bugs to: wn22@cmu.edu (at least until July 1994), or write to:

Also write to me if you feel like it anyway...

Have fun, and I hope it works!
