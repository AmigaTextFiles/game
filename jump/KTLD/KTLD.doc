Greetings fellow Amigans...              //
... and welcome to my shareware game.  \X/

THE STORY...
Upon awakening you realise your uncontrollable urge to pilot a
state-of-the-art military shuttle to an alien infested planet and collect
pods with only a handgun to defend yourself...

THE CAST (in order of appearance)
You          - Runs around each level under player control
               collecting pods and avoiding aliens.  Beware
               of all explosions as the player loses life
               when in contact. (I know I do)
Brain-Things - Consider endless pacing of platforms to
               be fun.
Mutant       - Climb around levels using ladders.
Snake        - Although relatively slow, these attack.
Droid        - Pace the platforms of the level.  These
               droids attack upon visual contact.
Probe        - Heavily armoured probe which explores some
               stages.  Although these droids have no
               weaponry, collision is fatal.
Cannon       - Semi-Intelligent cannon mounted droids which
               attack on sight.
Jumpy-Things - Generally harmless.
Century      - Due to the poor design and programming of
               these droids, they are unable to fire whilst
               climbing around the levels, however, they
               make up for this lack with a rapid fire
               weaponry.  These droids are generally no
               happy chappies.

BONUS LEVELS
Bonus levels appear throughout the game without warning.  The aim of these
levels is to collect all of the bonus pods within the time allocated.  All
shields will be restored to your current life by default, and if each of
these bonus levels are cleared, an extra life will be rewarded.

CONTROL
At any time during joystick-driven gameplay, holding down the left mouse
button will quit back to the title screen. Holding down the right mouse
button will quit you back to workbench, with all systems returned.

If you feel insecure about the lack of music on the title screen may I
suggest the following albums...
 - Pearl Jam - Ten
 - Pearl Jam - Verses
 - Pearl Jam - Live Vol 1
 - Nirvana - NeverMind

This game should work on all Amiga computers which are capable of running
AMOS.  Although this game is Shareware, it is not to be altered in any way.

If you know of any PC owners, send my condolences and suggest these
practical applications...
 - Link the PC to your Amiga and use it as a printer
   buffer.
 - Grind the processor to make a beach-side contribution.
 - Fill the casing with water through the air ducts, whilst
   taking care not to drown the treadmill-hampsters, and
   use the CPU to boil water for a coffee.

If you would like to make this game part of your software collection, I
would very much appreciate the equivalent of 5 Australian Dollars or,
whatever you consider appropriate, sent to me at...

Live long and prosper...
