 ›[0;1;4mHow do I play it?›[0m

 No problem! Simply collect all gold. A ladder that leads to the next level
 will appear if you have done the job. Pushing the button opens the floor to
 your left or right side temporarilly. Your opponents keep stuck in the opened
 holes and you can walk over then. Greeeed... In this world, the bad guys
 doesn't win. If you fail, try again!


 ›[0;1;4mHow do I use two button joysticks?›[0m

 Two button joysticks (e.g. the sega mega drive joypad) can be used in the
 standard mouse or joystick port. If you push the second button to start
 (instead of the standard button), you will be in the two button mode:
 standard button digs at your left side, second button on your right side.
 The pins for the second button are not connected on most four player
 adapter ports (at least, they're not at mine :^) and so, they're not
 supported, sorry.


 ›[0;1;4mTool types:›[0m

 You can specify some extras by altering the tool types in the game icon.

   · ›[0;1mMONITOR=Pal›[0m -> Sets the name of the monitor (DblNTSC, Euro36,
     etc). (works only with Kickstart 2.0 or better)

   · ›[0;1mINPUTDEVICE=OFF›[0m -> Disables mousepointer and input device to
     get full CPU speed. In pause mode and in the level editor, the
     mousepointer and input device are active again.

   · ›[0;1mADAPTER=OFF›[0m --> Disables access to the parallel port. Usefull
     if there is no four player joystick adapter. Data sent to another device
     at the parallel port will be scrambled otherwise in multiplayermode!

   · ›[0;1mCIRCLE=OFF›[0m --> Disables the circle zoom at beginning of a level

   · ›[0;1mPALETTE=A2024›[0m --> Uses a special palette for the A2024 monitor.


 ›[0;1;4mSpecial keys:›[0m

   · Del:   Kill all players on a level. (If someone is in a dead end)
   · Esc:   Quits the game.
   · F1-F4: Selects the number of players.
   · F5:    Pauses the game.
   · F6-F8: Selects extra levels.
   · F9:    Toggles Soundtrack or 4-ChannelFX
   · F10:   (Re)start the game.
   · E:     Enters the level editor.

  ›[0;1mOriginal keyboard control:›[0m
    (press F10 and "U" in the title page to start in one button mode,
     press F10 and "O" to start in two button mode...)
    "U" - leftButton "I" - up         "O" - rightButton

  ›[0;1mAdditional keyboard control:›[0m

     press F10 and left amiga to start in two button mode...)

    leftButton:  left alt/right amiga
    rightButton: left amiga/right alt


 ›[0;1;4mThe Level Editor:›[0m

 Push "E" in the title page to enter the Level Editor! This thing of true
 magic enables YOU to create new amazing levels for Mine Runner.

 The editor can create mapfiles (which carry the information of the level
 structure) and logfiles (which carry information how you tested the
 level the last time). All files will be saved in the "Levels" drawer.

 You may send your best levels to me and maybe they will be included in the
 next release! Let's see... If you want to do that, please put in your mind
 that I will need the mapfile of the level AND a logfile where you have
 completed the level! (I am not a good Mine Runner <^: and I have to know
 how to complete the level) You may send them uuencoded with email.

 Ok, select a drawing block from the palette at the top of the screen and draw
 your level by using your mouse.

 Don't forget to enter the level name in the input gadget for the following
 four actions:

  · The "TEST" gadget: Let you test the level while creating the logfile.
  · The "SHOW" gadget: Shows the actions of the logfile if level was done.
  · The "SAVE" gadget: Saves the map of a level.
  · The "LOAD" gadget: Reloads a previous saved level.
  · The "QUIT" gadget: Quits the editor.


 ›[0;1;4mTechnical:›[0m

   · With older kickstarts, the level name cannot be displayed in the
     input gadget. You can type in the name even if you cannot see it.

   · Minerunner uses direct blitter access, so GFX-card screenmodes will fail.
     If you are using CyberGraphX, you WILL have to DISABLE the PLANES2FAST
     option or the game will even fail on standard screen modes!


 ›[0;1;4mHistory:›[0m
 
 Crazy: Minerunner was born in the same boring computer science lesson as
 Zerberk, but some weeks before. As far as I can remember, Andreas told me
 about a contest where he and someone else had to create a game from scratch
 in one night: Pac Man and Space Invaders... So I drove home and made a mini
 Minerunner for the next day. (I better had not...) More crazy: Although, the
 core part of the game was finished in a day, it took weeks to fix all bugs
 and get the bad guys walking somewhat like "unstupid". Even more crazy: I
 built a special joyport-Nullmodem cable to transfer 150 levels from a game
 that I will not mention here from my C128 to the Amiga. That took a whole
 night and I had to restart transfer every 40 minutes or so because of the
 (totally crazy) handmade transfer protocoll. Crazyly crazy: Some Minerunner
 fan(atic)s played all these levels (and even more) and logged the result.
