- Requirements

-> SDL 1.2, www.libsdl.org
-> sdl_mixer, www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

These libraries are preinstalled on most Distributions, otherwise install them with your package manager.
IMPORTANT: Additionally, you also need the programm "sdl-config", which is located in the SDL-Devel 
package. You should install it, too. If it isn't included with your distribution, get it here:

http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php   (Development Libraries)

- Installation:

1. Untar the archive, open a shell and change to the directory where you have extracted "Blaster"
2. type "make"
3. After compiling, you are ready to go using the command "./blaster"
4. On the other hand, it is preferable to do a systemwide installation: To gain Root- privileges, type "su", followed by your Root- password.
5. Install the game with "make install"

The binary will be placed in /usr/local/bin and is named "blaster".

6. Run the game with "blaster"

If you are not able to compile the game, you are probably missing one of the required libraries. Install them first and make sure 
you have "sdl-config" in your PATH.

-Parameters

Start the program with "-nosound" to turn off sound.

-Objective

You control the little man with a gun in his hand and your goal is to pass all the 30+ Levels and also to reach a
