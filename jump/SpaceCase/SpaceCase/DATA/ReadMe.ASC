OPTIONS SCREEN.
---------------
To access the options screen, press up on the title screen.
Here is a list of the options, and what they do.

DIFFICULTY LEVELS.
------------------
There are three levels of difficulty, TRAINER, NORMAL and STOMP.
Each difficulty level not only controls the difficulty of the game,
but also the controlabilty.

ENTER LEVEL CODE.
-----------------
This option allows you to enter a code to re-start at the point which
you left of.  You are given a level code when you die.

VIEW HIGH SCORES.
-----------------
This allows you to view the high score table.

SOUND TEST.
-----------
This will play the currently chosen sample.(Don't ask me why!)

DISPLAY 50Hz/60Hz.
------------------
This allows you to change the display type, PAL or NTSC.  In NTSC mode
on a PAL machine, the game will run 10% faster!

MAP-FLIPPER.
------------
This allows you to play the levels horazontally 'Flipped'.  This is
good if you have completed the game and want to try it in a differnt
perspective, or if your having difficulty playing, or perhaps if your
a left-handed gamer!! 8-)

END.
----
This option will return you to the title screen.


GENERAL PLAY INFO.
------------------
Here's a bit of 'General Play' information about the game.


HINTS AND TIPS.
---------------
To start of with select the 'Trainer' difficulty level, and as you
get better move up to 'Normal', and then on to 'STOMPIN'.

Its best to use your Rockets on badies that will shoot at you, or
hurtle towards at great velocity!!  Remember to keep a safe distance!

When you collect an 'Extra-Live Chance' bonus, follow him up the,
while blowing up bins and collecting and bonuses on your way.  Dont
worry about the 'FLYS', as you have a shield.

If your having trouble getting past a particular level, then use the
MAP-FLIPPER option, on the options screen, as its often helpfull to
to tackle a problem for a different perspective!

When blowing up bins, keep a safe distance, and if posible on the same
verticle line, this way you can take care of the flys with ease!

Finaly, learn each badies attack and movement pattern, each one is
different, and has different ranges,speeds and inteligence.

BOMBS.
------
Bombs Are Your Main Weapon.  As before, to kill a bad dude, the bad
dude must be under the explosion.  Bombs bounce off floors depending on
how far they fall.  They also speed up going down hills, and slow down
going up hills.
To use a Bomb HOLD DOWN >FIRE<, a Bomb will be released.  Keep holding 
down >FIRE< until the Bomb is over the target.  Then release the >FIRE< 
button. The Bomb will explode, and take out any bad dudes under it!

ROCKETS.
--------
Rockets Are Your Secondary Weapon.  Again, to kill a bad dude, the bad 
dude must be under the explosion.  Rockets are limited.  You can only
carry 9 Rockets at any one time.  Rockets only explode when you release
the >FIRE< button OR when they go into the side,top or bottom of the screen.
To use a Rocket HOLD DOWN >FIRE and DOWN<.  You may then guide the Rocket
by pulling >LEFT< or >RIGHT< on the stick.  Release fire to explode! When 
The Rocket has been fired you may realese >DOWN<, but NOT >FIRE<!

BINS/OIL DRUMS.
---------------
Bins And Oil Drums Can Be Destroyed By Blowing Them Up With A Bomb Or
A Rocket.
Bins and oil drums, when destroyed, may reveal a collectable.  However
if you destroy to many Bins/Oil Drums, The resident FLYS won't be happy,
and will show you a few moves!  You can 'dispose' of the flys by Bombing 
them, or, if your good, Rocketing them!!

SECRET LEVELS.
--------------
There Are Secret Levels...And thats all I'm saying!!!

JUMPING.
--------
Press >UP< to jump! The longer you keep >UP< pressed the higher you will
jump.

JELLY.
------
Jelly Allows You To Get To Those 'To High To Reach' Places. Simply
jump on the jelly to bounce.  You may also build up mementom. Holding 
>UP< will make you bounce higher, and Holding >DOWN< will make bounce 
lower!

DISOLVING PLATFORMS.
--------------------
You dont know where these are. When you walk on one you are perfectly 
safe.  But when you jump or walk off of them they will disappear.

JOKER PLATFORMS.
----------------
You dont know where these are either, but unlike 'DISOLVING PLATFORMS',
these will disappear as soon as you are on one of them.

SPIKES.
-------
Very bad for your health!

INDUSTRIAL WASTE.
-----------------
This Drips down from pipes that are all around the levels.  You don't
want to make contact with this stuff!!

MOVEING PLATFORMS.
------------------
These move Left/Right/Up and down, and may be stood on!! 8-)

COLLECTABLES.
-------------
R-Rocket. Gives you an extra Rocket!

S-Sheild. Makes you emune to Bad Dudes, but NOT Spikes.

B-Bonus. Gives you a Points Bonus.

1-Extra Live Chance! When you collect one of these, a little dude
will appear, on a space-hopper!  You will also be awarded a sheild.
He can't hurt you, and you must follow him to the top of the screen 
for an extra live. You must not let him go to far of the screen when 
you follow him, or your loose him, and your extra live!!

P-Power! Collecting this will make you 'spin-out' up and down the screen,
killing any badies you come into contact with, and you cant get hurt
by spikes! After about 5 seconds you may press >UP< to sort it out!
If you don't, and you keep 'spining-out', then you will automatically
get sorted, and it could be Spike-Time!!

E-Energy. Replenishes your Energy.

WEIRD ONES.
-----------
Sometimes the bad dudes may go a bit 'funny'.  This is a side effect
of the industrial waste!!

Enjoy!!
