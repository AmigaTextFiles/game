If you have started the game successfully, the program will show you a list
of four options:

PLAY
INFO
SET-UP
QUIT


PLAY
If you chose the PLAY option, you will be asked to enter your name (three
letters). You can correct what you have typed in by pressing BACK SPACE. To
clear everything, you point at the option CLEAR, and press the left mouse
button. Press either RETURN, or point at the option OK and press the left 
mouse button, when you have finished.

The program will now start. Remember to move the mouse to the left side of
the screen, otherwise the program will be in "PAUSE MODE". (See GOAL for
more information.)

INFO
The program will present you with another menu with five options:

GOAL
OBJECTS
SCORE
AUTHOR
CANCEL

They will give you a brief description of this game. They are included in
this file, but you will also find more instructions here. So read this
carefully at least once.

The CANCEL option will bring you back to the main menu.

SET-UP
You can here change the default keys. This is very handy if you are used to
other keys than the ones I have chosen for you. (See CONTROLS for more
information.)

The program will ask you to define the keys for:

UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, STOP, KICK.
If you want to cancel this task, you simply point at the option CANCEL and
press the left mouse button. The option DEFAULT will change the definition
of the keys back to their default values.

GOAL
You have been assigned the demanding task of cleaning your SYSOP's hard disc
from viruses. These nasty creatures have infected all sectors, and you have
to wipe them off, sector by sector.

To eliminate a virus you simply kick a disc at it. But beware, the viruses
may also kill you. It is important that you are fast and kill them all,
before they start to destroy your 3 1/2" discs.

There are 50 different levels (sectors), and on each level the speed will
increase. The viruses will also be smarter, and start to hunt you on the
higher levels.

It is useful to know that each virus has its own characteristic behaviour:

1. The magnet is the most dangerous virus. It will follow you everywhere,
and it is almost impossible to hide from on the higher levels.

2. The mouse is very mobile, and is turning fast around corners.

3. The photo-diode is good at attacking you from behind, and has some
other interesting features!

4. The joystick was created by an ugly hacker who liked to play games too
much, and didn't spend so much time fixing his virus. It is therefore quite
harmless, but it may trap you if you are not careful.

To pause the game, you simply move the mouse to the right side of the screen.
When you want to continue you (surprise, surprise) move the mouse back to
the left side.

CONTROLS
Special keys:

F1 : Will make you go continuously without stopping all the time.
F2 : Will stop you after every step.
F6 : Music ON.
F7 : Music OFF. (Very handy)
F10: This is an option which should only be used by experienced
     players! This will allow you to start on level 10, where
     life becomes harder. This enables beginners to practice on
     some easy levels, but will not force good players to start
     on level one all the time. 
     (Your score will be cleared, and you will have three lives again.)

The default keys:
(You may change these if you want. See SET-UP)

UP:        8 (Numeric pad)
RIGHT:     6      -"-
DOWN:      2      -"-
LEFT:      4      -"-
STOP:      5      -"-
"KICK":  SPACE

When you have lost a life, press "KICK" to continue.

You can now also use a Joystick, which should be connected to the right
port.

SCORE

The more viruses you kill with one single disc, the more points you get:

Viruses  Points
      1       2
      2       6
      3      14
      4      30

By putting the 5 1/4" discs together you will earn an extra 20 points.

The Surprise Bonus (?) will give you 0-20 points.

When you change levels you get 1 point per 5 non-destroyed discs.

SYS will look in the current directory for all the files when you start the
program. If it can not find the highscore-list, it will try to create a new.
If the disc would be write-protected, SYS will ask you to un-protect it.
However, if you do not want the program to create a new file for you
simply chose the option "CANCEL", otherwise unprotect it, and press "RETRY".
The same procedure will be repeated when you quit the program, and SYS is
trying to update the higscore-list.

If SYS can not find a soundfile when the program loads, it will just
continue to load the other files, and will later on not use that sound. If
you, for example, don not like the sound-effects (for some strange reason),
you simply erase them, and SYS will now not allocate any space for the 
sound. Very useful if you want to run several programs at the same time,
and do not have much RAM left.

If you realy dislike the sound, you can simply add your own effects. The
only thing you have to do is to call the sound-files "SYS_Soundx.snd", where
x is a number between 1 and 7. They can be in either IFF- or FutureSound
-format.

Nr1: Bonus.  Nr2: Hit.  Nr3: Breaking-disk. Nr4: Killed, Nr5: "Kick"
Nr6: Ding    Nr7: Background sound.

NOTE:
The Background sound will sometimes be played at a higher (+2000) rate when
someone has taken a "Lattice C Compiler" bonus.

AUTHOR

I created this game during the winter 1988-89 as an exercise in programming
this wonderful computer. It took me around seven weeks to finish, and one
extra week to debug and check. If you would find an error anyway or you have
suggestions for the next version, please write.

I would also like to thank Sioe-Lin Kwik and Mats Bjerin for their moral
support and assistance.

My intention with this game was to enable you to enjoy your FANTASTIC AMIGA
without having to pay #¿25. You may copy this program to all your friends as
long as you do it without receiving any payments back.

If you have any good high-scores, ideas, suggestions, programs (PD or your
own), demos, information etc etc etc, please write to me! My address is:
