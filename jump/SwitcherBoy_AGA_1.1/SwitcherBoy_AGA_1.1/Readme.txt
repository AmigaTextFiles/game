Entry for AmigaWave (2nd Place) and Posadas Party 2025 (3nd Place).


Final version of SwitcherBoy (1.1), a game for AGA-based Amiga systems
with some fast RAM, aiming for broader compatibility with ECS/OCS setups
in the future. The game is designed to perform well even on modest
configurations.


Developed using the Redpill engine, graphics adapted from public domain
resources and an original soundtrack composed by Fermix.


Special thanks to the testers who helped polish the game across different
setups:
Tolkien, Jorger, Zener, Daphy, and PolloHacker.


And of course, a heartfelt thank you to Daphy, responsible for both the
translation and cultural adaptation of the game into English and Dutch.
