Welcome to WiZiO - 1998 Mr E Software.
--------------------------------------

This little item won "Game of the Month" in Amiga Format Reader's Games last
year, and I thought I'd release it to the public domain.

The game is (as yet) unfinished and only contains 4 levels of World One. 
I'm afraid I've lost interest in finishing it, but I may do so one day. 
Dunno. What do you think? 

This game is 100% Compiled AMOS with no extensions (just goes to show what
you can do with this excellent language!). I may release the source if there
is enough interest (it's not very pretty though)... I may even release the
source for my other games from "Mr E's Compendium" which won AF's "Game
of the Month" and also "Reader's Choice" last year. Again, all 100% AMOS.

							hmm.

Anyway, if you want to contact me, you can do so at the address below...
