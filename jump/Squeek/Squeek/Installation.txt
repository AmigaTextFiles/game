Hello!
------


Congratulations for downloading Squeek!
This is the full version of a 30-level plattformgame!


Installation
------------

Just move the Squeek-Drawer to whereever you want! Then click the Squeekicon to play the Game!


Enjoy!

PS:I suppose the game runs VERY slow on 68000-020 systems, maybe even 030. Therefore, I
managed to make an A500-version in a hurry!!! Mail me at: titlesta@online.no. My website
will soon be ready at http://www.tripod.com/~hognetitle/
Be sure to check it out for the latest games and Squeek-upgrades(if bugs are located!!).
