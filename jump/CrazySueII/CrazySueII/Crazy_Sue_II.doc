Crazy Sue II 

The story
---------

The  people of Ereanor learned of the courageous girl Sue who had destroyed
the  terrible  sorcerer,  the  "Wizard  of  Doom". For three days and three
nights  they  celebrated their freedom. However a dark shadow was soon cast
over  the  Kingdom  of Ereanor as the sinister "Mistress of Death", wife of
the defeated wizard, took her revenge.

[Some  other  really  nasty  stuff  happened,  but  it  was in German and I
couldn't read it. But it did involve the kidnapping of Sue's teddy-bear.]

That  was  too  much, so like before, Sue courageously and heroicly took up
the fight. You also take up the fight and help Sue against the evil witch.

The game
--------

Jump  and  run  your way through the castle to find the evil witch. Collect
spells, keys and other bonuses along the way by touching them.

Spells come in two varieties - ones which work their magic immediately, eg.
"time"  and "life", others last for a fixed amount of time, their remaining
effect  is  shown  as  a  countdown  timer underneath. See below for how to
activate spells.

Pressing ESC aborts the game. Pressing the "P" key pauses it.

The controls
------------

Push  left  or right on the joystick to make Sue run left or right. Push up
on  the  joystick  to  make  Sue  jump.  Sue  jumps higher if you hold this
direction  for  longer.  You can also push up and left or right to make Sue
jump in that direction.

Push  down  in front of a door or passage to enter the next room. Doors are
usually locked and require keys or a door spell to enter.

Press  down  in front of an altar to choose a spell to activate, if Sue has
any.  Once  you've  pressed down, you can push left and right to choose the
spell and press fire to activate it.

Have fun!
