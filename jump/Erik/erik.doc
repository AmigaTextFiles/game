Brief instructions and hints:
-----------------------------

The aim of Erik is simple, very simple. Just make your way to the exit of
each level and Erik's freedom.


You control Erik with the joystick. The usual directions apply:


                                   JUMP
                                    |
                                    |
                          WALK      |      WALK
                          LEFT------|------RIGHT
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |

                          PRESS FIRE TO USE WEAPON


On the title screen you can select which world you wish to start on by 
pressing 1,2 or 3. The last world can only be reached by playing the whole 
game.<FULL VERSION ONLY*

There are coloured star blocks on one level of each world. Shooting these
blocks causes them to change colour. Certain colour combinations give
rewards- diamonds, extra lives etc. I will leave it to you to suss it out.

There are lot's of secret rooms in Erik. To enter a secret room, you must
possess the key for that level, and be in the right place. A magical sound
will be heard, and the magic door will open somewhere on the level. I will
let you find out what happens in these rooms.

There is a shop to be found on most levels where you can spend the money you
have collected on goodies.

Some weapons can be found that are not available from the shop, so keep an
eye out.

All weapons can be upgraded by collecting "P" bottles.

A spring icon can be collected which enables Erik to jump higher. There are 
places which you will have to have the spring to access.

There are three types of shield available for Erik's use, one available from
the shop. Use them well.

There is a warp zone hidden in level 1 world 1, bet you can't find out how 
to use it!!

We hope you enjoy playing Erik.
