  @{u}PacMan'96 Introduction:@{uu}

   PacMan is one of the most known and legendary computer
   games in the world. Unfortunatly, we had to recognize,
   that  for the Amiga there is no real usable version
   available. So it happend to me as a A4000/040 user (and
   me as a A3K/060 user, note from the translator:) again
   and again that most (Shareware) PacMan ports (or is this
   PacMen:) heavily crashed my machine or flicker a lot.

   Because of this, one thing has to be said before:
   From today on all @{u}Amos/Basic/crap-programers@{uu} can
   keep their fingers away from porting another PacMan ;).

   PacMan'96 Features:

    * Written in C++/Assembler
    * Enforcer-Hit free
    * Runs in Multitasking
    * Runs on dragable Screens
    * Free selectable ScreenMode
    * Runs driver independ(!) on all graphics boards
    * Runs in a window on the Workbench(!)
    * Taskpriority selectable
    * Selectable Game Control (lowlevel.library support)
    * All Resources are allocated and freed 
      100% system friendly
    * All Options are written to disk (how wonder!)

  @{u}PacMan'96 System Requirements:@{uu}

   Minimum required:

    * an Amiga with OS 2.0 (V36)
    * 68020 Porzessor
    * ~400 kB free ChipMem
    * ~500 kB free FastMem

   These Requirement might look a bit high for such a
   simple game. This is because the game is 100% system
   compatible and therefore needs more resources than
   a hardware banging code will use.
   Theoretically it would be possible to write a version
   that runs on a plain OCS/68000 Amiga but I think a
   10 year old configuration is pretty out of date to
   be suported.

  @{u}Harddisk Installation :@{uu}

   Drag the PacMan96 Drawer into a dircetory of your
   choice.

   Starting from Hardisk:
    Open the PacMan96 drawer and start the program 
    by double clicking on the PacMan96 icon.

   In the PacMan96 directory you can find a "s" and
   a "c" directory. Both are used for the Floppy Disk
   installation.
   If you want to save some bytes on your harddisk
   you might delete these directories.

  @{u}Floppy Disk Installation :@{uu}

   Please copy the @{u}whole contents@{uu} of the PacMan96
   Drawer to an empty formated Floppy Disk.

     * Only spec. X-Mas release:
       On disk is not enough space for all files,
       so you must not copy the following files:
        X-Mas96
        X-Mas96.info
        X-MasMan
        X-MasSmpl

   Please don't forget to make this disk bootable
   by (e.g.) typing "Install df0:" from shell.

   Starting from Floppy Disk:
    Insert the disk into one diskdrive and reboot your
    Amiga.

   Or:
    If the Workbench is running, open the PacMan
    disk and start the program by double clicking
    onto the PacMan96 icon.

  @{u}To EGS Users:@{uu}

    If you want to play PacMan'96 you will have to
    use the EGSPlus emulation.

    You will find EGSPlus on Aminet® in gfx/board
    drawer named EGSPlus.lha.

    EGSPlus changes the EGS emulation in such a way
    that it can now deal with friend bitmaps.
    Please unlha the archive and use the included
    installer to install EGSPlus.
    See there for further information.
    (Stay tuned for Jürgen's EGSPlus V2 !)

   of the game should be well-known - so I don't 
   explain them here again (laziness:)

   * On top oft the screen you find the current scores
     for player 1 (left) and player 2 (right). Between
     them you see the current high score.
   * Beside the screen you see some fruits which
     might be collected in this level.
   * The hearts on the bottom tell you how many lives
     you have left.

   Images for player one are always displayed on the
   left side, for player two the right part of the

   or upload it to Aminet®, or...
    
   To edit your own levels a mouse connected to port 1
   is needed (of course).

   By pressing ESC or by double clicking onto the note
   on the top left corner of the editor you return to 
   the @{" Main Menu " Link MainMenu}.

   You will find these symbols in top of the editor:

   ED: # XCV LEV:<01> SPD:<1> IQ:<1> L S

   Right below the current level is drawn.


   ED: # Here you see the current edit object you are
         useing. By clicking the left mouse button in
         the level area this block is set at the mouse
         position.

         If you press the right mouse button, an object
         is cleared from the current mouse position.

         If you click onto the sign (#) in the symbol
         line you change the current object you draw with.

         These objects are available:

         Blue Wall block:
          This is the object to draw walls.

         Small yellow point:
          By pressing the D on the "ED:" string all free
          areas in the edit area are filled with this
          little yellow points. This is what have to eat :)
          Warning ! Make sure you can reach all this
          points within the game (e.g. avoid hidden areas
          to be filled with points !).

         Big yellow point:
          Set this "powerpoint" into your level to eat 
          the ghosts. Be carefull with setting them so
          you have some fun when playing :)

         Ghosteyes:
          You can not move over this object, but ghosts
          can. It is an invisible wall for the player.
          If you want to move over it a yellow block 
          is draw shortly.
          With this object the entrance to the ghost
          house should be locked. But you can also use
          it whereever you want.

         PacMan:
          This object defines the startposition and
          startdirection for your PacMan. You get this
          object only by clicking onto the PacMan object
          in the edit area. Now you can set the position
          of the PacMan. By pressing the right mouse
          button onto the PacMan object you change the
          direction the PacMan begins to run.

         Ghost:
          This is the startposition of the ghosts.
          You only get this ghost object by clicking
          onto the ghost block in the edit area with 
          the left mouse button.
          Now you can set the ghost to a any position
          in the level.
          You should always have a "house" around the
          ghosts and lock the entrance with the ghost 
          eyes (see above).

   XCV: This are the standard cut/copy/past functions.
        You cut/copy or paste a level by clicking on 
        that signs:

        X: The current level is copied into the copy buffer
           and the level itself is cleard (cut).

        C: The current level is only copied into the
           copy buffer (copy).

        V: The current level is overwritten by the
           one in the copy buffer (paste).


   LEV: The number of the level is shown here (1-32).
        By pressing the cursor keys left/right or by
        clicking onto the arrows left and right beside 
        the number you step to the previous or next
        level.


   SPD: This is the speed switch. You can define the 
        speed at which the objects in the level will
        move (1-2). Click on the arrows left and right
        beside the number to switch the speed level.

        1: Standard speed.
        2: Double speed.


   IQ:  This is the inteligence the ghost have when
        you start a level (1-8).
        Again, select the IQ level by clicking
        the arrows left or right beside the number.

        1: senceless stupid (PC)
        2: total idiot
        3: a bit dumb
        4: little crazy 
        5: almost smart
        6: insidious
        7: underhanded
        8: absoluty unfair

        Please note that this values are beginning
        levels. From time to time this will grow
        so that the ghost learn a bit to get smarter.


   L S: By clicking the left mousebutton on one of these
        buttons you can load (L) or save (S) all levels.

        By pressing the right mouse button over the
        image you can load or save single levels to disk.

        L: Load
        S: Save

        A standard Amiga filerequester apears where 
        you can enter the wanted file name to load or
        save.


   If you press the button on the joystick for player 
   one (or the RETURN key in P1 KEYBOARD mode) you
   can try out the level imedately.
   After the level is finished or canceled, you return
   to the editor screen.

  @{u}PacMan'96 EXIT:@{uu}

   A safetiy request apears which you must confirm
   to exit PacMan'96.

   By pressing the left/right cursor keys or by draging
   the joystick left or right you can change between
   <YES> or <NO>. If you press RETURN or the fire button
   the request is confirmed.

   <YES> finishes PacMan'96.
   <NO>  you return to the @{" Main Menu " Link MainMenu}.

   You should always leave PacMan'96 with the EXIT function

  @{u}PacMan'96 Program / Problems:@{uu}

   If something went wrong there will always apear 
   a requester with some notes about the error source.
   This requester can be closed with RETURN or ESC.


  @{u}WINDOW ON WB:@{uu}

   PacMan'96 can only played on the Workbench
   if it is opened on a 256 color screen. PacMan'96
   trys to allocate 32 linear pens with the OS call
   ObtainPen(). If this fails (e.g. you have
   256 colors, but they are not available to PacMan'96
   because MultiView is just displaying an image)
   a requester with an error message is shown.


  @{u}SCREENMODE:@{uu}

   On graphics boards PacMan'96 can only be played
   on 8 bit screens (256 colors).
   PacMan'96 is not able to use 15/16/24 bit screen
   modes because the palette fadeing is not available
   in these display modes.


  @{u}Joystick:@{uu}

   In the directory PacMan96/libs/ you can find the
   lowlevel.library. This library is necessary to play
   the game with the joystick or the joypad. If it is
   not possible to play PacMan'96 with the joystick
   please copy this library into your standard library
   path, e.g.: 

    15.PacMan96:> copy libs/lowlevel.library libs:


  @{u}Music/Soundeffects:@{uu}

   Because PacMan'96 allocates every resources system
   friendly, the audio channel are allocated useing
   the audio.device. Also a CIA Interrupt is needed
   to play the music. If an allocation of any of these 
   resources fails a requester will be opened.
   In such a case, please close all (music) programs
   that block the audio channels or the CIA interrupts.
   (wonder what happens on a Draco).


  @{u}Libraries:@{uu}

   PacMan'96 does require an asl.library to 
   open the file and screen mode requesters.


  @{u}Flickering / Image jerks / Doulebuffering:@{uu}

   If Pacman'96 flickers it could have different causes.
   PacMan'96 runs under full Multitasking which means
   that other software my need some time to run while
   PacMan'96 just wants to blit an object...
   (e.g. watches or other time critical applications
   can cause such an behavior). Some of these programs
   depend on interrupt timeing. In such a case even
   changeing the taskpriority will not help. The only
   solution for this problem is to switch this program
   off.
 
   If you see some strange flicker effects this could
   be a problem of the doublebuffering with the 
   ScrollVPort() function. The Autodocs say this method
   is slow on systems lower the OS 3.x. I am sorry
   I do not know a better system compatible way to
   to use doublebuffer that also supports OS2.0


  @{u}Jerks on Graphicboards:@{uu}

   PacMan'96 synchronizes the screen refresh with the
   WaitTOF() function from the graphics.library.
   Some board driver use the standard vertical interrupt
   of the standard Amiga video output. This method 
   does not really work synchronous to the real position
   of the boards raster beam...


  @{u}Program Technical Stuff:@{uu}

   PacMan'96 has been written with Maxon C/C++ 3.
   Only the music, soundeffect routines and the
   anim5 player have been written in assembler.

   The graphics board code does NOT require any
   further libraries. The graphics.library function
   GetBitMapAttr(bm) & BMF_STANDARD has been used 
   to check if PacMan'96 is running on a graphics
   card. If the display is not a standard bitmap
   friendbitmaps are used to allocate the bitmaps
   for the objects. The source images are converted
   to the display format by a simple BltBitMap() 
   call then. This makes it possible that the
   images and the display does have the same pixel
   format. All graphics operations are done by 
   BltBitMap/BltBitMapRastPort() calls which are
   speed things up enormously in chunky modes.

   Some Emulations do have problems with friend bitmaps
   (e.g. the standard @{" EGS " LINK Installation} Emulation). PacMan'96 
   detects such things and shows a real bad warning !

   The font used is done by LowLife/Hotline-1993.
   Some special characters have been added and
   the data format has been optimized.

   The sound track PopMan is based on the module
   Popcorn from Hawk-1991 and has been compressed
   to 3 channels and has been memory optimized.
