.oO How to play Oo.

Your goal is simple - catch as much mead bottles as possible while 
keeping yourself away from the trolls. From time to time you should
visit one of the barrels, because you cannot carry more than 9 bottles
at a time.

In single player mode, you can use both barrels - in two player mode, you
can only use the barrel you started at. As soon as you grabbed the seventh
bottle, your barrel starts to blink.

The game ends if you miss more than 9 bottles.

If you`re good enough you may enter your name in the highscore list. Highscores
and font settings will be saved when you quit the game.
