@NODE HEROES "The Four Horsemen"
Geenie, Teenie, Meenie, Veenie..... These are the names of our four greenish
friends. You must jump them through worlds by @{"levels" link LEVELS}.
They jump and collect, nothing else.

The main idea of this game is taken from an old C64 game, can't remember it's
name or author. But, be sure that the game changed a lot (We pixelled some
graphics in 1990 when we saw the original game but they were nearly
forgotten.) We found them in 1995 and started to improve then the design came.
First there were just one greenie, Geenie (second from the left on title). To 
add a 'Backyard' factor to the game we added extras (balls/gems) and other
greenies, more levels, more.... That's why it took 4 months to finish the
game.. Add more and more thingies takes more and more times. As we did in
@{"Nibbler Super eXtra" link NSX} (first Backyard Brothers title).

After releasing NSX, we (finally) decided to release GEENIE... Enjoy!!

@NODE REQUIR "Is your Amiga is OLD?"
Needs ram....

Most of the game coded on a 512K Chip + 2 Meg Fast RAM A500 v1.3, and it
completed on a standard A1200.

Tested on:
        A500 v1.3 512K Chip
        A500 v1.3 512K Chip + 2M Fast
        A600 1M Chip
        A1200 2M Chip
        A1200 2M Chip + 4M Fast + 68030
                But we think it works on all Amigas.. 

If this game don't work on your machine, we promise we'll try to fix your
problem. Just reach @{"us" link CREDIT}!!!!

@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE LEVELS "Worlds They Live"
To complete a level, you have to collect 10 certain items, in early levels
these are numbered jumping circles. The 10th one with a colored circle
instead.

There are some more extras to be collected, fruits and balls/gems. Fruits
gaves you some points and you see a number flying when you eat it. Get them
quick. See @{"extra items" link EXTRAS}.

Jumping is a matter of time...

Don't splash, avoid from moving thingies (if they're not staying on same
platform), collects extras and points, simple ?

There you'll se no enemy in first level, but more level you pass more enemies
you see..... with more specialities...
@ENDNODE
@REMARK =========================================================================
@NODE EXTRAS "The Junkyard"
Balls/Gems, Fruits/Food/Drink.... The Junk....

The effect of balls (for water world), gems (for desert world) are:
        - Blue   : Hero don't fall
        - Gray   : Invincibility
        - Yellow : More points for everything
        - Red    : Complete level (you have to fall for this)
        - Green  : Extra life (same as red one)

Other extras gives bonus points up to 500....

Jumping to another platform gives 1, enemy splashing gives 100 points too. 

(Extra items will change for more worlds in full version.)

Backyard Brothers was founded in 1995...

Backyard Brothers are a little team of ex-sceners (or sceners). There are two
coders (M.Ali and Berke), two graphicians (M.Ali and Tunc) and a musician

play and some utils for all to use.
