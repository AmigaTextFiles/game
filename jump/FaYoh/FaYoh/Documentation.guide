The name "Fayoh" was invented by my friend Independence Dave.  He disliked
the way Scooter (H. P. Baxxter) sang the word "fire", meaning that it sounded
like "fayoh"!  Anyway, we ARE fans of Scooter (Or "Scootah" as they say with
their german accent...) so no offence :)

Used...

Programming - Blitz Basic 2.1 (Acid Software)
Graphics - Personal Paint (Cloanto) and Vidi Amiga 12 (Rombo)
Music - (mostly) Pro Tracker Pro 3.31 (Cryptoburners & RD10/Osiris)
Computer - AMiGA 1200/030/50 MHz with 6MB RAM (+ the usual stuff), PAL

Also tested on - AMiGA 1200/030/40 MHz with 7MB RAM, in NTSC.

If your computer sets your house on fayoh (fire), do NOT blame me!  I'm just
the very innocent programmer, not at all aware of the consequences of my 
work!  You're playing this game at your own risk.  It shouldn't be able to
hurt your system though, and has never done so to those it was tested on!

                    <--- .:! The story of FaYoh !:. --->



It all started a while ago...

   Ed was a young "smoothie", a "ladies man", and he was escourting another
nice girl "victim" outside the disco.  She really wasn't quite his type.  A 
little more bimbo-ish than he liked.  He actually found her vapid smile, and 
tinny childlike voice rather irritating.  But... What the heck.  It was only 
his second conquest of the night, and he expected it would not be his last.  
Once outside, in the alley, he began by kissing her, pushing his mouth hard 
against hers, and that was how FaYoh and Audrey met!

   FaYoh, you see, was a green piece of chewing gum and was in Ed's mouth, 
while Audrey - a pink 'n' cute (perhaps overly sweet, exactly the kind of gum 
you might expect a childish young female to choose) female gum - was in the 
young girl's mouth.  During the kiss they saw each other, and fell in love 
as only two gums can!  Fayoh's emotions took over his body.  All his masculine
gum hormones told him that he must have this gal-gum!  His thoughts whirled 
within his tiny gum brain as he starred across the two rows of teeth at his
beloved.

   The kiss didn't last forever though.  The two humans parted and Ed spoke his
farewells to girl number two.  With each momentary opening of Ed's mouth FaYoh 
watched as Audrey was taken away from him by the gal with the silly smile.  
He was heartbroken.  Suddenly, the gal's face changed; she opened her mouth and 
spit Audrey out!   Ed closed his mouth and FaYoh, alone in the moist darkness, 
could see no more.

   It was only about a half an hour later, but to FaYoh it seemed forever.  Ed 
opened his mouth and FaYoh was ejected hitting the ground with a big <SPLATT>. 
Finally the little green gum was free!  Now he could start his long search for 
the pink blob-of-his-dreams, Audrey!


As you might have figured out already, in this game you play the part of FaYoh 
in his quest to find Audrey!

Good luck!

@node  "Controll, enemies and items"

        <--- .:! The short version of how to control FaYoh !:. --->



   Joy Left  - Move left
   Joy Right - Move Right
   Fire      - Jump

Break bricks...
   Blocks made of bricks can be destroyed.  All you have to do is to crack'em
with your head (the upper part of the blob).  Sometimes, bonuses are hidden 
inside, so destroy as many of them as possible!

Kill enemies...
   You can kill most enemies by jumping on'em.  Bouncy enemies can NOT be 
killed this way, nor can the spikey ones!  You can jump on flying enemies, 
but usually to no effect.

Jump higher...
   Remember that if you press fire while landing on an enemy, you'll  make
a major jump!  This is useful for reaching high platforms!  Using a bounce-
pad will make you jump even higher, but such pads are rare.

Items...
   Cherry  - You'll get an extra life after picking 100 of them up.
   Diamond - These are wonderful things!  There are 5 of them per level.
             If you find all of them, you will receive an extra life!
   Coin    - This'll make you untouchable by living creatures, but it 
             only lasts for a few seconds.
   Candy   - If you collect this, you'll be presented with a bonus game
             when the level is completed.  There you may win extra lives 
             if you're lucky!

             <--- .:! Levels that may exist someplace !:. --->



   You reach the hidden levels by falling down into holes in the ground at
"obvious" places.  Sometimes, you must find a hidden level to get all five
diamonds.
