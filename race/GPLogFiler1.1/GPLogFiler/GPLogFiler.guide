Introduction
------------

GPLogFiler was created as an alternative of @{"AGPLap" link "Utils" 0} and it is supposed to
make handling of f1gp logfiles easier. I have used the @{"Magic User interface" link "MUI" 0},
file requesters and multyple viewing windows to make a user frieldly program.

However GPLogFiler can not record a new logfile. It only loads and saves
logfiles created by @{"AGPLapTime" link "Utils" 0}. This is because it does not patch the f1gp in
order to record a race. Such patching code will not be added in the future,
but it may utilize AGPLapTime to do so.

@node "Requirements" "Requirements"

Requirements
------------

GPLogFiler requires at least an Amiga with OS-2.01 to run. You must 
also have MUI 3.8 and the NList custom class installed on your system.

It doesn't take too much memory to run, but you may need more memory to
load many logfiles at the same time. I have no @{"feedback" link "Feedback" 0} yet, whether is
left enough memory for GPLogFiler to run when f1gp and/or other f1gp
utilities are running on a low memory Amiga.
@endnode

@node "Installation" "Installation"

Installation
------------

There is not an installer script in the archive yet, so you must do it
manually. Just unpack it in the directory you want the GPLogFiler directory
to reside, or use a directory utility to copy only the files you need.

@node "Overview" "Overview"

Overview
--------

GPLogFiler is a very user friendly utility based on MUI to make life with
f1gp logfiles easier. This first version supports only the very basic,
but GPLogFiler will hopefully expand.

Please note that you cannot record an f1gp race with GPLogFiler. You have
to use @{"AGPLapTime" link "Utils" 0} to do this.

The amiga-os locale system is supported to make translation in other languages
possible. Only three languages are available in this first release but I 
hope that many other translators will @{"contact me" link "Feedback" 0}.

@node "Usage" "Usage"

Usage
-----

GPLogFiler is very easy to use and all functions are self explained. Since
@{"MUI" link "MUI" 0} is being used, the usual amiga style is present. All the strings used
in GPLogFiler can be customized or translated using the locale support.

Windows are open dynamically when needed, and everything is unsynchronous
except for the file requestors. Dialog windows are also used to inform or
ask the user to confirm an action.

There are 2 basic type of windows used in GPLogFiler:

 @{" Main Window     " link "MainWindow" 0}
 @{" Log View Window " link "LogViewWindow" 0}
 @{" Comment Window  " link "CommentWindow" 0}
@endnode

@node "MainWindow" "Main Window"

Main Window
-----------

This is the window open when the program is ran, and it's used to control
the logfiles as individuals or as groups. It consists of a listview, a
control panel and a menu associated with them.

Each logfile loaded in memory, is displayed on the listview with some
information about it. The info fields of the listview are:

Filename: The filename of the logfile.
Date:     The datestamp of the file on disk.
Size:     It's size in bytes. It's always a multiple of 44.
Sessions: The number of different sessions in the logfile. Also the track
          is displayed when all session are on the same track.
Drivers:  The number of human and computer drivers in the logfile. Drivers
          with in different sessions but with the same number and name are
          counted only once.
Status:   The current status of the logfile.
Comment:  The comment associated with the file on disk.


The buttons on the control panel are:

Load new: Load a new logfile in memory using a file requester. This will
          occupy a new place on the listview.
Save:     Save the selected logfiles on disk. A new filename can also be
          chosen.
Remove:   Remove the selected logfiles from memory and close the log view
          windows associated with them.
Clear:    Remove all logfiles from memory and close all log view windows.
View Log: Open Log view windows, with the logs of the selected logfiles
          displayed on them.
Export:   Export the log contents to a text file.
Comment:  Allows you to set a comment for the logfile. (This is an
          Amiga-OS file comment.)


Menu consists of the following items:

Project:           The usual general stuff.
    Iconify:        The usual iconifying action.
    About:          Copyright and some other info.
    About MUI:      The usual MUI about information.
    Quit:           Exit GPLogFiler.
Logfile:           Actions to be performed on logfiles.
    Load New:       Same as the control panel one.
    Save:           Same as the control panel one.
    Remove:         Same as the control panel one.
    Clear:          Same as the control panel one.
    View Log:       Same as the control panel one.
    Export to file: Same as Export on the control panel.
    Comment:        Same as the control panel one.
Settings:          Set GPLogFiler to your preferences.
    MUI:            The usual MUI environment settings.
@endnode

@node "LogViewWindow" "Log View Window"

Log View Window
---------------

The log of an opened logfile is displayed in this window. Only one log
view window can be opened for each log file.

More details about the information displayed in this window will appear
in this section in a future version of GPLogFiler. Look at the @{"AGPLap" link "Utils" 0}
documentation instead.
@endnode

@node "CommentWindow" "Comment Window"

Comment Window
--------------

This window allows you to change the comment of one or more logfiles.

There are a string gadget and four buttons. You may type the
comment in the string gadget and press return or 'OK' to set it.
You can skip a selected logfile with 'Skip' or press 'All' to
set the same comment for the remaining selected logfiles.
You can stop anytime by closing the window or pressing 'Abort'.
@endnode

@node "Compatibility" "Compatibility"

Compatibility
-------------

GPLogFiler produces output similar to @{"AGPLap" link "Utils" 0}. However there are some
small differences between them. Some of these may extinct in the future
but other won't.

These major differences are:
  -GPLogFiler sorts drivers of a non race session by fastest lap time
   (on the results section), while AGPLap sorts them by leading laps.
  -The average pit stop time differs in some rare cases.

GPLogFiler does not support any command line arguments yet, so all those
AGPLap options such as the -w usage with AGPLapTime are not possible.
