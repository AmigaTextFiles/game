  @{b}This is a work in progress demo of an engine which is likely to
be used in a racing game.@{ub}

  Bear in mind that this is a very early preview, so don't be surprised if
you hate the control method, think the car looks crap or think the grass and
sunset colour schemes clash - you're probably right, but the engine has the
@{i}potential @{ui} to become something good!

@NODE GSC2P "About the Chunky to planar libraries...."

  The GSChunky2Planar libraries were written in 1997 by me (Alastair Robinson),
in an attempt to replace the CopperChunky screenmode I used in my Wolfenstein
clone a year or so ago. (AMRWolf, just a demo released in Aminet and CUCD III.)
  Basically, I wanted to migrate to Chunky2Planar conversion for higher
resolutions, without losing the advantage of TrueColour rendering.

  That was when I downloaded ASA/Cirion's TrueColour HAM8 routine.  This gives
a resolution of 160 × 100, but has the small disadvantage that each pixel must
be in RBGB format - which prevents the chunky data being interchangable with
a similar routine for graphics cards.
  Then a friend gave me a disk full of Chunky2Planar routines he'd collected
from various sources, and I began to experiment.

  Peter McGavin's C2P4.s was the first routine I attacked:  Out came the chunky
comparison buffer, (you'd need two anyway if you're double-buffering - three
chunky buffers as well as two planar buffers is a bit excessive!)  I re-wrote
the CPU portion to use the most significant 4 bits instead of the least
significant and added support for region restriction.
This has evolved into the C+B-12-?x?.libraries.

  The next routine to be attacked was C2P8.s, by Peter McGavin, and modified
by Conrad Sandersson.  Once again, I removed the chunky comparison buffer and
added support for region restriction.  I also modified the blitter routines
so that only six bitplanes are converted, and split one of the blitter passes
in half to allow a larger buffer to be converted.  (This was needed for the
1.5×1 library)  Most importantly of all, I changed the name to C2P6.s!
This routine was used in the C+B-18-?x?.libraries.

  Lastly, I wrote a library around Kalms_C2P.s, which I'm pleased to report
needed no modification.  (Optimising it for 6 planes instead of 8 was a task
I couldn't face - but this routine is blindingly fast anyway!) This became
the 020-18-?x?.libraries, and these are the best ones to use if you have a
68030/50Mhz or better.


  These libraries will eventually be released for general use, along with some
equivalents for CyberGrafX, and possibly Picasso'96, but writing these
equivalents is not an easy task while I don't own a graphics board!

  Contact me if you'd like to furnish me with a suitable routine - but don't
expect great wealth as a result; the C2P routines I've used so far are (to the
best of my knowledge) public domain, so the libraries themselves will be
released as freeware.

@NODE Installation "Installing the VoxelEngine..."

  Just de-archive the entire lha file and copy the entire directory onto a
hard-disk.

  The voxel engine relies on my @{"GSChunky2Planar libraries" link GSC2P}, also © 1997 by
Black Five Softdesign, which are in the GSChunky2Planar drawer.  The
specification of these libraries is still subject to change (and it will do
when I support graphics cards), so it would be advisable not to place them
in libs:, and even more advisable not to try to use them in your own projects!
(Public release soon, I promise!)

@ENDNODE

@NODE Requirements "What is required for the VoxelEngine..."

  The VoxelEngine requires a 68020 or higher and (with the current C2P libraries)
the AGA Chipset.

  I have only tried this version on machines with 8 megs of fast ram, but
it may run with less.  As usual, the more ram you have, the better.

  The engine was written on a 68030/25MHz machine, and has been tested on
a 50MHz '030 and a 25MHz '040.
  On the '040 it was no faster than on my '030/25, probably due to copyback
caches being disabled or something.  This problem will probably disappear,
along with several others when I ditch AMOSPro and make the engine 100%
machine code!

  The Configuration GUI requires MUI 3.6 or higher.

   The engine was written partly in AMOSPro, and uses features from my
GameSupport extension, and the GSChunky2Planar libraries (which are still subject
to change and so haven't been properly released yet.)

@NODE Running "Running the VoxelEngine..."

  To run the engine, just double click on the big Track1 Icon.  After a short
pause the engine will display a landscape.  Moving the mouse left and right will
rotate the viewpoint, and holding the left mouse button will make you
travel forward.
  Don't be surprised if the car behaves strangely on occasions; It will quite
often turn 270° clockwise when it should turn 90° anticlockwise!
  I'll fix this soon.

  You will start on some grass, you'll have to find the road for yourself!

@{B}So what make this engine special?@{UB}

» The engine runs on screen in TRUE COLOUR, even on AGA machines (HAM8).  In
  theory the 12 bit (HAM6) 3×1 mode could run on ECS chips, but the blitter
  routines would need to be re-written.  Support for graphics cards is planned,
  but this cannot be done until I re-write the AMOSPro stuff in assembler.

» All graphical routines are resolution-independent, supporting up to 1280×1024
  as a hard-coded maximum size.  The view can be shrunk and expanded at will.

» Two Megabytes are devoted to the landscape, one for altitude and the other
  for shading.  The shading and terraforming are performed by my own track
  editor which will probably be released in the future.

» A roadway is carved into the hills!  (or more correctly, the hills were
  generated around the road!)

» The road path is constructed from spline curves, giving the track designer
  extreme freedom.

» Provision has been made for objects to be integrated and properly clipped
  with the landscape.

» A car object is already implemented (but needs a lot of work!)


Keys:

» F1 - F6 will select the colour scheme for the landscape.

» F7 - F8 will choose between two different sky textures.

» F9 - F10 will select high and low quality rendering modes respectively.

» + & - will change the size of the window.

» Delete and Help will toggle between third-person perspective and overhead
  views.  (The car is not visible in the overhead view!)

» S will save a screenshot into the ram disk.  The produced file will be in
  ImageStudio's native format, VMEM.  This was chosen because it is the easiest
  24-bit format to save in existence!  Saving the file might take a minute or
  so, depending on the resolution, because the saver is an AMOSPro routine!

» Esc will quit the program.

Resolution cannot be changed from within the engine, you will have to quit
and run...
@{b}The Configuration Program@{ub}

  This is nowhere near finished, but it gives an indication of my plans for
the future.  The Save and Cancel gadgets on the first page work, as does the
Chunky2Planar page, but everything else is for show only!

  To change the Chunky2Planar module, just choose the desired mode from the
list, go back to the other page and press save.

  Please note:  The Benchmark gadget will attempt to gauge the speed of the
selected Chunky2Planar converter.  This has nothing to do with the speed of
the voxel engine itself; the time taken by the converter is (roughly speaking)
in addition to the time taken to render the frame!  Bear in mind also that
those converters which support region-restriction will be sped up considerably
if the engine runs in a small window!
