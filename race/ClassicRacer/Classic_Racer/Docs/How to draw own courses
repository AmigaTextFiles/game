Description how to create own Classic Racer courses
===================================================

(der deutsche Text ist in ClassicRacer.txt enthalten)



To draw your own course you just need one of the classic ;-) paint programs
like PPaint or DPaint.
To start it is probably the best to load one of the pictures in the "Kurse"
directory as template...


  1. File format:

     The Classic Racer only accepts IFF-ILBM pictures with 16 colors.


  2. Picture size:

     The minimal dimensions of a Classic Racer course are 320*256 pixel. You
     can enlarge the picture as long as it fits into chip memory.
     Please notice that the width must be a multiple of 8.


  3. Interpretation of the colors:

     All course elements like road and walls are just recognized by
     different colors:

      Number Function       Number Function
      ---------------------------------------------
      00     (reserved)     08     start position 1

      01     earth/grass    09     start position 2

      02     road           10     start position 3

      03     road           11     start position 4

      04     finish         12     oil

      05     water          13     earth/grass

      06     wall           14     wall

      07     road           15     wall

     The appearance of the colors can be adapted to your needs, just
     0,8,9,10 and 11 will be set by the program.


  4. Start pixels

     To tell Classic Racer where the four players should start, you have to
     set four pixels on your course. One pixel for every color from 8 to 11.
     The distance between the pixels should at least 10 pixel.


Just save the final picture in the "Kurse" directory and test it...
