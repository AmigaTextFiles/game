<H2><A NAME=5>5. DEVELOPERS INFORMATION</A></H2>
<P>
The concept of a "Standard-Licence" like this one has several advantages:
<P><UL>
<LI> You as a developer don't have to think about copyright stuff yourself.
<LI> The users of your product have to read it only if they haven't done so
     before.
<LI> This document is available in several languages via Aminet®.
     So you can be sure that the users have read it at least once and did
     understand it.
</UL><P>
If you want to include "AFD-COPYRIGHT"(TM) in your own Amiga® FD-Software
package you have to follow these rules:
<P><UL><LI>
a. Read this whole document carefully  and make sure that you agree with the
   whole text WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS.
<P>   
   (If you do not agree with it, do not use it! You are allowed to copy parts
   of it,  but IF you do so,  you MUST NOT use the names "AFD-COPYRIGHT"(TM)
   and "Standard Amiga FD-Software Copyright Note"(TM).)
<P><LI>
b. Make sure that you use the following Default-Tools in the .info-files you
   are going to release:
<P><UL>
   <LI> for ASCII texts:           <B>More</B>
   <LI> for AmigaGuide® documents: <B>AmigaGuide</B>
   <LI> for AmigaOS scripts:       <B>IconX</B>
   <LI> for ARexx scripts:         <B>RX</B>
   <LI> for configuration files:   <B>Ed</B>
   <LI> for Installer scripts:     <B>Installer</B>
   <LI> for IFF-ILBM pictures:     <B>Display</B>
</UL>
<P>(The idea of this rule was inspired by Osma "Tau" Ahvenlampi, Finland.
   It was included to set a standard. If someone does not use these tools
   (s)he has to make not more than one link per file type!)
<P><LI>
