This program allow You to see the records without running the game.
It can also check two records files,and tell you who is better:
You or you friend.

WARNING0:
	This program checks only for 12 tracks.If You have more
	tracks change in source line

#define TRACKSNUMBER 12

	to:

#define TRACKSNUMBER Your_Number_Of_Tracks

And recompile the source.

And of course send me the tracks I don't have ;-).
Here is list of all track I have:

Road_Circuit_2
Road_Circuit_1 
Tropical_Islands_1
Grasslands_1
Floating_City_1
Grasslands_2
Forbidden_Castle_1
Toxic_Refinery_1
Tropical_Islands_2
Toxic_Refinery_2
Floating_City_2
Forbidden_Castle_2

Usage:
    Cli only.

    Type XtremeTime .laptimes

and You will see all results. File ".laptimes" can be found in
you XTRemeRacing directory.Remember to save you best time with 
'save setup' option from menu.

    Type XtremeTime .laptimes other.laptimes

and You will see You times and then times from the second file.
Important: .laptimes is your file
	   other.laptimes is you friend or someone else file.

In other way the program will tell you that you have worse times,
and it will be a lie.

In this archive is also my file with best times.Maybe not as good
as they can be,but...
I'm not demand any profit for this prog, but If You find this programm 
funny,or usefull, or exciting or just you like it please send me you
'.laptimes' file!!!

I promise to send the disk back with my latest .laptimes

WARNING:
	wiht a knowledge of structures from .laptimes you can change
	the times without playing the game.BUT PLEASE don't do it!!!!!
	Be a man and don't cheat like a chicken.Be honest to the people
	who are playing this game so hard.
WARNING2:
	Be also honest to the people that create this fantastic game,
	and don't play pirate copy.If You wanna to see more Amiga games
