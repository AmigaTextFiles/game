                            Shareware
                            ^^^^^^^^^

  Last lap is in fact a shareware production and not a public domain product. The full game has been given to you so that you can make up your own mind to see if you want the program. If you wish to or intend to keep this game you must pay the registration fee of £5.00 (english dosh - cheque made payable to Stephen Greener) to the address given else were in this document (Sublime software address). 
	In return all registered users will be given/sent any future updates of this program as they are finished.  If you want updates don't forget to send your name and address.


                        System requirements
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                       
  To run Last lap you must have around 1.5 meg of free memory. If you don't have enough memory free last lap might (probley) crash (this has not been tested yet at the time of typing this document). The program itself needs all files in the lastlap draw to work. Last lap works fine on a basic 1200 and a 1200 with harddisk. Other Amigas have not been tested (had no access to them - wish we did). 

                         500(+) / 600 users

  Please note  - Last lap was written on a 1200 with the 1200 in mind so if this game is a little slow on the 500/600 this could be due to the speed difference between the machines (This has not been tested yet either). If this happens I recomend that you buy a A1200(+HD) right now!.  


                            Installing
                            ^^^^^^^^^^

  Last lap requires about 840 k of free space. To install last lap on to your hard disk all you have to do is drag the Last lap draw (in wb) to the place that you wish for it to be installed. Last lap requires no other files than the ones present in the last lap draw. To run just open the last lap draw and click twice on the last lap icon. Simple.
