 Please note: Drop me a line if you are interested in the game.
              I'd be very interested to know if it works on your
              Amiga, especially if your configuration is a bit
              exotic.

@node "Hardware" "Requirements"

Aerial Racers should run on a base A1200, however as this is a pre-demo
release this might not be the case.  If it does crash (urmm _no_ error
messages yet...) try freeing as much memory as possible, and please let
me know of any difficulties.

Note: this version of Aerial Racers is not AGA specific, so it could
run on a souped up A500 or A2000 (1meg chip minimum)..... give it a go,
who knows.  All versions here-after will be AGA only however.

Please also note that running any background tasks could possibly cause a
crash.  If it does crash then make sure all commodities are turned off.

Aerial Racers has been tested on the following machines:

        *  A1200 0MB, 4MB
        *  A1200 030/28 4MB
        *  A1200 030/33 882/33 (Microbotix) 10MB

I've heard that there is problems with Amiga's equiped with '060 processors,
so if anyone has one of these could they please let me know if the game
does or doesn't work... thanks.

@node "Money" "Registration"

At this moment registration is not a consideration..... I'm more interested
in what you think of Aerial Racers.
And as University tends to get in the way a bit, development time can be a
problem.
So please drop me a line...
I'd also like to know what your config is...

How to play.
------------

  Firstly, as this is a demo, there are only two cars that you can use: the
Streetcar and the Monster Pickup.  The Track Editor has had saving disabled,
so you're stuck with the tracks that I've included.


* Important *
-------------
  When playing the game, you can only drive directly forward over cross-roads,
therefore you cannot make left or right hand turns at cross-roads.
  Also it doesn't matter how you complete laps.... forwards (the direction
you start facing), or backwards, or shortest route. As long as you don't do
a U-turn on the track.


Game Modes.
-----------
  There are two separate race mode in Aerial Racers, these are the sprint and
the arcade modes.
  Sprint is your standard fastest wins race, and record times are saved.
  Arcade mode has power-ups appearing on the track, some good, some bad...
          Speed Up:       Maximum speed for a few seconds.
          Traction:       Maximum traction for a few seconds.
          Extra lap:      Adds a lap to your lap counter.
          Decrease Speed: Grinds your car to a stop.
          Reverse:        Reverses your joystick left/right controls, until
                          you pick up another power-up.
          Gravity:        Alters the gravity setting for a few seconds.
  The draw-back with the arcade mode is that race and lap times don't count.


Game Menus.
-----------
  There are a quite a few of them so.... just have a play around.


In Game.
--------
  Joystick controls:
          Left  - rotate car anti-clockwise.
          Right - rotate car clockwise.
          Up    - Nothing.
          Down  - Brake.
          Fire  - Accelerate.

  Esc:  Kill current race, and return to menu.
  P:    Pauses the game, any key to resume.

Track Editor.
-------------
  As save is disabled just have a play around... still has a couple of bugs.

  Note: use the right mouse button on the track grid to select a tile to
edit an existing piece, and the left mouse button to replace it entirely.

@node "Plans" "What's in store..."


Well as this is definately the last non-AGA version - moving to AGA only.

This will enable us to add:

        - More competitors. (probably upto 3 human + 1 computer players)
        - More cars. (of course...)
        - better car handling and collisions.
        - better gfx and sound.
        - more track pieces. (bottle-necks for instance)
        - including the track editor in the game itself.
        - possibly championships, null-modem link, hires displays....
        - damage to cars, oil slicks, mines....
        - much better game front-end / menus.
        - give me ideas!


Other games in the pipeline!

  * Screech Demo      (Fantastic overhead racing game)
  If you haven't checked it out, it's on Aminet, get it now...

Hairpin II is already available as licenseware.
Forthcoming releases (in no particular order) are:

   * Combat 2000      (Combat/Scorched Earth cross) - working title - 30%
   * Marauder         (Robot combat game)
   * Galaxian AMI     80% complete

Not to many at the moment........ here's a chance to add your name!

Ben Ellis - for the music that he gave me ages ago to use on any games that
            I might get around to writing.

And certainly, Andrew and Brad for the support, and the plagiarising of
the Screech guide.
