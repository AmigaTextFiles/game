  if you are upgrading from older version (datafile was called hofpoints2.dat),
rename the datafile from hofpoints2.dat do hofpoints.dat.
 
   AND if your file have different lenght (new datafile have 2 characters at
end of this file  - this is your ID from HOF, add your ID from HOF right behind
last character in datafile) 

  thats all...
