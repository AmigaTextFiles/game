@{B}@{APEN 3}COMPUTER REQUIRMENTS:@{UB}@{APEN 1}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game requires a A1200 or above to run at full speed, but works on a
A500/A600 but only slower.  Owners with accelerated Amigas may need to disable
their 'CPU Caches'.  This is because of a small problem with 'Blitz Basic IIs'
sound routines.

@{B}@{APEN 3}GAME INFORMATION:@{UB}@{APEN 1}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A while ago I wrote a game called HydroZone.  In that game you flew down a series
of fast moving 3D tunnels trying to avoid walls which zap your limited supply of
energy if you crashed into them.  You also got to shoot 3D alien robots.  It was
great fun playing it, but it was maybe a bit too hard for the average games
player.

This game is a huge up date of that game which uses a similar game engine but is
so very different.  Gone is the energy metre, and inplace is a spit screen display.
Race a friend to the finish in a two player (or more) battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game comes complete with a Level Editor, so if you think you have got the
talent, you could design your own tunnels to add to this game.  If you do, PLEASE
send them to me.  I will gladly add them to my master disk.  When/if I receive
enough levels, I will release them on a data disk.

@{i}Magazine Quotes:
@{apen 2}"....your missions take you through some weird and wonderful worlds in 
which you explore numerous screens and shoot everything in sight...." 
"...the sprites may be tiny, but you can clearly see what's going on, right down 
to the streams of blood flowing from open wounds." 
"...the sprites move with surprising grace in all directions.  Along the way you'll 
come across plenty of aliens and space craft, and it's all pretty impressive stuff 
to be honest."       @{UI}@{apen 1} @{b}Amiga Action preview (September 95)@{ub}

@{apen 2}@{i}"In  short, AFF is the best PD game I have ever played (and  I've played a few) 
The  difficulty level is set just right so you always find something new, the 
missions are  poriginal and it is extremely addictive."   @{UI}@{apen 1}
@{B}                      ShareWorld 7 Disk Magazine.     Overall Score 94% @{ub}

@{i}Price @{b}£3.99 @{ub}(U.K. Sterling Pounds)@{ui}

@{APEN 3}@{B}WIRED CHAOS@{UB}@{APEN 1}
~~~~~~~~~~~
Multi-player light cycles clone with many power-ups and features.
This is probably one of the best light cycle clones there is.  If you don't take my
word for it, check out what the magazines said about it.

@{I}@{APEN 2}"Occasionally a PD game comes in that we all play for hours. 
Wired Chaos is the best version of Light Cycles available.  So there!....." 
"...in fact basically, it's just about the best PD game we've come across in 
quite some time.  I beg and implore you to buy the shareware version and 
encourage more top products like this." @{UI}@{APEN 1} @{B}Amiga Action (Game of the Month)@{UB}

@{i}@{APEN 2}"....Playability is present in copious amounts, and a good many hours could be spent 
crowded around the keyboard with a bunch of partially inebriated companions revelling 
in the addictive action." @{ui}@{APEN 1}  @{b}Amiga Computing (Game of the Month)@{UB}

@{i}Price @{b}£3.75 @{ub}(U.K. Sterling Pounds)@{ui}
Countries other than the U.K. can register by sending cash for £5.00 (U.K. Sterling)

@{APEN 3}@{B}HYDROZONE@{UB}@{APEN 1}
~~~~~~~~~~
Fly through fast, speedy 3D tunnels.  Very similar to this game.

@{I}Magazine Review Quotes:
@{APEN 2}"This shareware effort, from little known Skull Army Software, could with a 
lot of polishing pass for a commercial release.  As it stands at the moment it is 
far better than average PD games, the first in fact to earn our all-new PD games of 
the month accolade." @{ui}@{APEN 1}    @{B}Amiga Action (Game of the Month) @{UB}
