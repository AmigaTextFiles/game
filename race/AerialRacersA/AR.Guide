@node "Hardware" "Requirements"

Aerial Racers should run on a base A1200, however this might not be the case.
If it does crash try freeing as much memory as possible, and please let me
know of any difficulties.

Note: this version of Aerial Racers is not AGA specific, so it should
run on a souped up A500 or A2000 (1meg chip minimum).....

I've heard that there is problems with Amiga's equipped with '060 processors,
so if anyone has one of these could they please let me know if the game
does or doesn't work... thanks.

I've previously stated that Aerial Racers would move to AGA only.  However
due to the many responses from people asking for it to remain ECS compatible
I've endeavoured to keep it so.  Although it won't be necessary to have an
AGA Amiga, your machine will have to be comparable to an A1200 - memory and
speed wise.

@node "Install" "Installing Aerial Racers"

Aerial Racers Hard Disk Install
-------------------------------

Firstly remove any old versions of Aerial Racers.

To install Aerial Racers simply uncompact all of the Aerial Racers
archives to the same directory (possibly called "AerialRacers" ;-)

To play Aerial Racers, either click the Workbench icon, or start the game
from a shell with:
                  AerialRacers

Easy huh?


Aerial Racers Floppy Disk Install
---------------------------------

Uncompact each archive to a blank disk,

Label the first disk:  "AerialRacers1"
Label the second disk: "AerialRacers2"
Label the third disk:  "AerialRacers2"

To make the game bootable you must make the first disk bootable (of course!)
and copy the following libraries to the libs directory of the first disk:

    diskfont.library
    mathtrans.library

Then boot from AerialRacers1, and play the game.


@endnode

@node "Reg" "Registration"

Well I don't want much for this game just an e-mail or a postcard letting
me know what you think of it. =)

As I'm working and going to Uni full time I don't have as much time to spend
on Aerial Racers as I would like, so instead of just having it sit on my
hard disk until some distant day when I might make a few small dollars from
it I've decided to give Aerial Racers it's freedom...

So all you have to do to make both of us feel happy and contented is drop
me a line.

Feel free to e-mail any tracks that you have designed and if I like them
I'll include them in future releases and/or make them available from my
web site.

If your feeling generous then why not see if I would like a registered
version of something that you have coded, or you could redraw the background
scenery (in the scenery drawer, just IFF files.), or you could.... =)

@node "Play" "Gameplay"

How to play.
------------

As Aerial Racers is now freeware there will be no restrictions on its game
play.  However at the moment just the first six cars are included; the
Camaro, the Monster Pickup, the Monster Beetle, the Formula One, the
Hovercraft, and the Sports car. More vehicles will be include in future
releases as I finish programming them in...

* Important *
-------------
  When playing the game, you can only drive directly forward over cross-roads,
therefore you cannot make left or right hand turns at the cross-roads.
  Also it doesn't matter how you complete laps.... forwards (the direction
you start facing), or backwards, or shortest route. As long as you don't do
a U-turn on the track.


Game Menus.
-----------
  There are a quite a few of them so.... just have a play around.
  As some combinations of options are illegal (particually in the race
options menu), altering one option may change another option automatically.
This should be fairly obvious and sensible.... I hope. =)

In Game.
--------
  Joystick controls:
          Left  - rotate car anti-clockwise.
          Right - rotate car clockwise.
          Up    - Nothing.
          Down  - Brake.
          Fire  - Accelerate.

  Keyboard controls (Right):
     Left arrow - rotate car anti-clockwise.
    Right arrow - rotate car clockwise.
    Right Amiga - Brake.
      Right alt - Accelerate.

  Keyboard controls (Left):
              Z - rotate car anti-clockwise.
              X - rotate car clockwise.
       Left alt - Brake.
     Left Amiga - Accelerate.

  CD 32 Game Pads:
          Left  - rotate car anti-clockwise.
          Right - rotate car clockwise.
          Up    - Nothing.
  Green Button  - Brake.
    Red Button  - Accelerate.


            Esc - Kill current race, and return to menu.
              P - Pauses the game, press P to resume.

@node "Editor" "The Aerial Racers track editor"

At the moment the T-intersection tiles are unavailable, this isn't intended
for any shareware crippling or such.  At this time the computer opponents
aren't smart enough to find their own way around all tracks and so it's
possible to design tracks that the computer cars cannot finish.
Therefore the T-intersections have be removed until the computer AI has been
correctly implimented.... Stay tuned!!!


Track Editor.
-------------
  You can now save and play your own tracks, and include your name so other
people know who designed the best tracks.... See the Registration section
for more details.


  Well I haven't got time to write instuctions yet... So you'll have to work
it all out for yourself! =)


 * Note *  -  use the right mouse button on the track grid to select a tile
to edit an existing piece, and the left mouse button to replace it entirely.


@endnode

@node "Plans" "What's in store..."

What will hopefully be included in near future release:

        - Depth sorting of cars.
        - Best of 3, best of 5, and championship competitions.
        - Better and more varied car performace.
        - Computer AI for path finding (will allow T-intersections in tracks)

Ideas for the future:

        - Computer opponents that can actually give a good race.
        - More cars. (of course...)
        - Better gfx and sound.
        - More track pieces. (bottle-necks for instance)
        - Possibly null-modem link, hires displays....
        - Damage to cars, oil slicks, mines....
        - May re-introduce power-ups etc.
        - give me ideas!
