Shock news:  This is only a DEMO!! No!

The full game with fifty tracks, source code and level editor is available!
See below for ordering!!

AMOS USERS- Full source code!!  Wow!

                            
                            *** Instructions ***

Mr. Shark Goes Racing is a top-down car racing game.  The object is simple-
complete each track infront of every other car.  There are no rules- smashing
other cars, dirty driving and special help are all allowed!

We would like to proudly say that Mr. Shark Goes Racing won an award from
Amiga Format at the FES 94 exhibition for its unique blend of action, speed
and playability!


Upon loading, the game presents you with a series of credit screens.  Press
any key or fire button to pass through these.  Then the main title screen
will be displayed- press fire to start the game!

As this is the demo, no options are available.

In the demo you take part in a three car grand prix as a single human player.
You are racing on some of the easier tracks, and play Mr. Shark himself.  You
are up against Mr. Barc- king of speed, and Mr. Smile- he's not really on
drugs!!

After a short time, the game screen will appear.  Three bings will sound, and
then your off!  Controls are:

         Fire     : Accelerate
         Left     : Turn left
         Right    : Turn right
         Up       : Fire object
         Down     : Break

The track consists of a number of different parts:

         Main Track     : A windy, flat surface which you race upon and
                          travel fastest upon.

         Run Off        : Different colour and pattern to the track, it is
                          un-even and will slow you down- only go onto in an
                          emergency!

         Barrier        : Again, a different colour.  When you run into this,
                          your car will bounce backwards as if by magic.  Be
                          warned- you lose a lot of speed by driving into a
                          barrier, so stay away!

         Bonus Box      : These will give you a special power, activated by
                          pressing up, which lasts for a set amount of time.
                          Powers include:

                                 Turbo    : In the shape of a can of oil, this
                                            will give you a super fast car for
                                            a time, but watch those corners!

                                 Ball     : This will bounce around the screen
                                            until it hits a car.  The car it
                                            hits will become very difficult to
                                            control, and will swerve all over
                                            the track!

                                 Boomerang: This does the same as the ball,
                                            but it will home in on the nearest
                                            car (not yours!).

                                 Mushroom : Will slow the other cars down, and
                                            do strange things to player two's
                                            screen (in the full game!)

                                 Star     : This will make your car all-
                                            powerful!  The run-off will not
                                            slow you down any more, and other
                                            cars which hit you will do a
                                            boomerang effect!

                                 Banana   : This will leave an ultra slippy
                                            banana skin on the track- run
                                            over one at your peril!

Hopefully you will grasp the controls quickly, but be warned- the computer
drivers are fairly good, and those bonus boxes can be more of a pain to drive
to than they are worth!

Anyway, when you finish, in first place I hope, your car will drive off as a
computer, and the other cars will draw up behind.  The screen will then slid
off to be replaced by a track time screen.  Press fire to see your running
points- the object of the game is to always be at the top of this list!

Press fire to continue to the next track.

The five tracks are:

         Star Fish      : Very pretty track, but hard to drive and slow!

         Smile City     : Aarrgghh!!  Smile's on drugs, and so is his track!

         Pussy cat      : The cats one cool dude!  Very fast and slick!

         Sharky Island  : The fish himself.  Fast, but so slipppy!

         Blank Void     : Surrealism rules!  Fast, dark and moody!

When you finish, with the full 100 points of course, the ending will appear.
Take time to read it- you can't break from the screen until it has been
displayed at least once- and you might lean something!!

Thankyou for playing Mr. Shark Goes Racing.

Mr. Shark Goes Racing was written by:

   Code           : Matthew Daws
   Graphics       : Jonathan Stanley
   Level Design   : Matthew Nash
   Ray Tracing    : Matthew Daws
   Music          : Mark Roberts
   Play testing   : Various (can't remember really!)

Packages used in the creation:

   AMOS Professional
   AMOS Compiler
   DPaint 4 AGA
   Imagine 2
   Rend 24
   Pixel 3D Pro
   OctaMed Pro
   + Others!!

Machines Used:

   Amiga 1200 + TV           (It can be done!)
   Reeves 486SX-25           (Printing + WP- you know!)

So, just because you ain't got a good machine or money- I spent œ50 on AMOS
and collected magazines- doesn't mean that you can't create a really cool
game!  So, joint up and start coding..



                        *** Technical Information ***

This game requires:

         2Mb Chip Ram  (NOT fast, but chip)
         
It would be recommended to get:

         '020 or higher processor (it's still quick on an A600 though)
         
It will not run off a hard disk, so don't try it!!

The game was designed in AMOS, believe it or not, and for source code + ideas
buy the full game, but:

   i)   The game does not scroll- there is just one big screen held in memory
        and hardware offsetting is used (hence 2MB)

   ii)  The code uses a fair bit of maths- sorry, but no game can get away
        from it, and the more you learn, the better!

   iii) To speed up math functions use an array- looking up Sin(56) is about
        five times quicker than calculating it!

   iv)  Read code the main loop several times- new ideas can often be found!

   v)   Don't be ambitions- the similar the project the better really- I
        still won't touch a platformer!

And finally, be CREATIVE!!

                          *** Distribution Notes ***
