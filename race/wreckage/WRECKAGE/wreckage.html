<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Wreckage is an experimental version of a driving simulation. <i>Experimental</i> meaning
that the final outcome of this attempt, if any, will not be directly based on the game
engine of <b>Wreckage</b>. Wreckage is written almost entirely in Blitz Basic. The engine for
the new game is written almost entirely in C++. Wreckage itself will probably never be able to
grow enough to match the features of the new engine.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Playing the game</H3>

<H4>Control method</H4>

<P>Select your control method using the appropriate gadget. You will not be able
to use an <B>analogue joystick</B> unless you have used AnJoyPrefs (available on
Aminet) to calibrate it.<P>

<P> If you are using a <b>mouse</b> then you can change its response by the two sliders
<VAR>Mouse Sensitivity</VAR> and <VAR>Steering Return</VAR> The first one
controls the amount the wheels turn when the mosue is moved, while the second
one controls how fast the wheels go back to the central position.</P>

<P><VAR>Speed-Sensitive Steering</VAR> increases the steering 'stiffness' as
your speed increases. If you like to do a lot of 'drifting' then perhaps you
should set this to zero.<p>

<h4>Gameplay options</h4>

<P><VAR>Easy Driving</VAR> does a couple of things to help you out: It increases
your car's downforce without increasing drag, it removes the dynamics of the
friction characteristic and it removes the effects of weight shifting.</p>

<P>If you are still having trouble then you can check the <VAR>Throttle
Help</VAR> option. This reduces the throttle each time a power-spin is imminent.
However it kicks in a little too easily and you will not be able to get the same
performance out of your car with this turned on.</P>

<P>If you are <B><I>still</I></B> having trouble then maybe you should change
the Terrain Settings, the Environment Settings or the Car Settings.</p>

<H4>Terrain Settings</H4>

<P>The most important setting is <VAR>Hill Steepness</VAR>. This is the
<B>average</B> hill steepness and <I>not</I> the maximum! Values around 10% are
best. Checking on the <VAR>Flat Around Track</VAR> gadget will make the
landscape at and near the track flatter. This has the side-effect of creating
canyons and or high narrow plateaus! So Take Care!</P>

<P>Another important setting is <VAR>Squashed Terrain Function</VAR>. This
results in the terrain being splitted into 'hilly' and 'flat' zones. Half of the
time the transitions between these zones are smooth and half of the time they
are a relatively steep drop. Flat parts will actually be quite flat even on very
high <VAR>Hill Steepness</VAR> settings. It is recommended that you use an
increased <VAR>Inclined Turns</VAR> value if you have this enabled along with
very steep hills, since otherwise the randomly generated track is very likely to
go straight up a 50% steepness hill immediately after a flat zone... (well, just
try it and see)</P>

<P>When the track is generated the steepness of a curve is
proportional to the amount by which the road is banked at that
point. <VAR>Inclined Turns</VAR> can be used to adjust the sensitivity of the
generator. Low values will result in an almost straight road for even highly
banked tracks. High values will result in a lot of S curves as the track goes
back and forth from one hillside to the other.</p>
<P><font size=-1>NOTE:The track generator function can be viewed as a simple
hill-climbing algorithm. The generator always tries to turn the track towards
the lowest closest point. So, if I had used a parabolic function for the
landscape, the track would always go into its centre and do loads of circles
there, whose radius would be proportional to the Inclined Turns setting</P>

<P>The other road setting is <VAR>Curve Steepness</VAR>. Use this with care, as
it does not take hills into account. High values of this and high hill steepness
will most probably result in a lot of almost-impossible turns.</p>

<p>Finally <VAR>Bump Height</VAR> specifies the amount of disturbance that your
car takes when you go off-road. High values will make it very likely that you
will roll over, even on a Jeep.</P>



<H4>Environment Settings</H4>

<P><VAR>Gravity</VAR> is the most important setting. Increased gravity increases
your road grip <b>and</b> it reduces the amount of time you spend flying :)</P>

<P><VAR>Track Grip</VAR> - the only other environment setting does what it says.
The default value of 50% is just fine. Higher values will help you with
cornering, but will result in higher friction at high speeds. (For example, max
speed of F1 on straight is 340 with 50% grip, but 260 with 100% grip). Using the
clutch however will give you a few extra Kmh B] (F1 goes up to 300Kmh with
sleazy clutch tricks)
