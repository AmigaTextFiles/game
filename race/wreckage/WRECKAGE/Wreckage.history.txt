Wreckage is a realistic driving sim for one player. The graphics are not
excellent, but the gameplay is neat.

As of this day, I have decided to release the quite messy Wreckage source code
You can do whatever you want with it.



Latest developments:

XV.45    (This is the FINAL wreckage release. Someday I might create Wreckage 2,
         but I have not got the time for it right now.)
        -More gfx detail on road
        -Road polygons now lightsource shaded (flat)
        -Finalized simulation model
        -BugFixes
        -No more crashes when not enough mem is available
        -Now you can use your own graphics for the cockpit
        -Engine DSP now works as it was originally intended.
