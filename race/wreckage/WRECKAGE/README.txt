RUNNING THE GAME
----------------
Just click on the Wreckage Icon
If the game crashes, make sure that the SFX directory
is in the same directory as the game and that the SFX
are in place.
If it still doesn't work, make sure you are running workbench
in a resolution that is at least 640x256 (so, NTSC HIRES wont do)

If it still doesn't work, contact me.

ANALOG JOYSTICK
---------------

Note that if you want to use an analog joystick, the only way to
calibrate it at the moment is to use an external program called
AnJoyPrefs.lha - get it from Aminet.
The Inverse Analog Joystick switch can be used to invert the horizontal and
vertical directions of your joystick (some people complained about that)
