Notes
=====

Some sacrifices had to be made to play an Arcade version of Outrun on the Amiga. 

- Yamaha YM2151 and PCM sounds have been replaced with .mod files and sound 
effects.If you can provide better .mod or asm code for Jason C Brooke player 
to use the original outrun tunes please contact me!
- The background graphics have been disabled in favor of a few more FPS. This doesnt affect the gameplay.
- Some of the shadow sprites have been disabled in favor of a few more FPS. This doesnt affect the gameplay.  
- Many of the enhanced CannonBall features are disabled but will be added in future updates.
