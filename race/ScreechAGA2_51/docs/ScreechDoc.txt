This text written 13/9/1995

Full  version  available  around  February  1996.    Keep  checking  for
forthcoming reviews in various Amiga magazines (we hope!).


HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
****************************

68020 or better processor
1MB+ CHIP RAM

NOTE:  We would appreciate it if  someone could let us know how  Screech
runs  on  Amigas other than the A1200.  If anyone expresses interest, we
may release a cut-down version for the A500.

Special note:  We  would also  like to acknowledge that  Powerpacker and
Crunchmania  were used in the  production of this game. We forgot to add
them  to the  credits at this  time but  this does  not  diminish  their
contributions!


HISTORY
****************************

Screech! began life while initial development of our  'mech'  type  game
was in progress. We had just added a 32-direction  car  to  attack  your
player, and decided that it looked  pretty  cool.  Next  thing  we knew,
Andrew had it driving  around  under  player  control.  We  seized  this
opportunity to improve on our last (and first) effort, Hairpin II (plug,
plug). We had hoped to have Screech! finished within a couple  of  weeks
(ho ho ho), and to a degree, we did!!


THE GAME
****************************

Screech! features 9 computer controlled cars, oil slicks, water patches,
exploding pit crews, road kills  and  everything  else  you've  come  to
expect from driving games. New features of this release are the graphics
and an entire rewrite from AM*S to Blitz Basic 2.  This version will let
you race two tracks with a demo of the third.  You can also let a friend
join in with two player mode. The full version will allow  racing with a
computer  controlled teammate  through  several disks full of tracks, in
various  levels of  competition.  Just make sure you keep earning enough
money to keep your car on the road. Sponsors and bribes will be there to
grab as well.

INSANE SOFTWARE
****************************

An ever-growing  conglomeration of people stuck in small towns.  For the
purposes of this game, and  wherever  mentioned  in  this  text,  Insane
Software is: 

        * Andrew Heap     - Programmer
        * Jared Quinert   - Sound & Music
        * Bradley Leffler - Graphics and added designs

        other members

        * Vaughan Roberts - Programmer
        * Timothy Opie    - Data entry (the guy who does the tedious bits)

As mentioned earlier, Hairpin II is already  available as licenseware.
Forthcoming releases (in no particular order) are:

   * Screech!         (You know what to expect)
   * Combat 2000      (Combat/Scorched Earth cross) - working title

   * Galaxian AMI
   * Aerial Racers    (Finished and soon to be available!)


BARTERWARE
****************************

Screech! is barterware.  If you're  interested  in  receiving  the  full
version, with many more tracks and a nice management side, then send  us
œ8, US $12, AUS $15 or equivalen  goods/service, and we'll send you  the
complete version of Screech!  We'd prefer the cash, but if you'd like to
send disks, games,  BBS accounts, Atari 2600/7800 carts, old Atari 8-bit
software,  joysticks, or anything else you think we could use, then feel
free to do so.  We  may also include  demos  of forthcoming releases and
anything else we deem interesting.  

Alternatively, if you are a programmer, or involved in the production of
shareware or  PD  games, then send us a copy  of your game.  We  hope to
start a network of amateur game developers to share our skills. We would
also like to organize a nice distribution process within the network. It
would  also  be  nice  to have someone else test our software, and share
ideas and suggestions.
