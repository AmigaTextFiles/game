                      INDYCAR CHALLENGE INSTRUCTIONS
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The game is made up of two distinct parts, the first is a psuedo managerial
section where the player must manage their finances effectively, upgrading
their car's capabilities as and when they see fit.  The second part of the
game is the racing (a season consists of 16 races).
The various parts of the game are explained below:-



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        THE TEAM MANAGEMENT SECTION
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  TEAM SETUP - The team setup menu allows you to change various aspects of
    your car's performance.


1.1 ENGINES - The better your engine the faster you can go!  The engine also
    affects the rate of fuel consumption.

1.2 AERODYNAMICS - The Aerodynamics in question are the front and rear
    wings.  The better your wings the more downforce produced and therefore
    the faster you can turn.

1.3 TYRES - The Tyres constantly wear down during the race.  The better the
    tyres the longer they last and the fewer pitstops are necessary.

1.4 CHASSIS - The Chassis and the various parts coupled to it affect how
    much stress your car can take.  The better the chassis the better it
    will hold your car together,  and the less damage will be done.

1.5 PIT CREW - The Pit Crew reflects how quickly your car is serviced when
    it is in the pits.  The better the pit crew you hire the faster your car
    will be serviced.


All of the above can be bought at any time, be careful though as you will be
allowed to buy various equioment which are actually worse than the ones
which you have already got, you can't however buy the same things which you
already have.



2.  FINANCES - The Finances menu will allow you to check how much money you
    currently have in the bank and the total of your debts.  You start the
    game with £1,500,000.



3.  CAR SETUP - The car setup screen will allow you to check which engine,
    aerodynamic set, tyres, chassis and pit crew are in use.



4.  CHAMPIONSHIP POINTS - This will allow you to check the current
    championship standings.



5.  LOANS - This menu will provide you with the opportunity of borrowing or
    repaying money to or from the bank.

5.1 BORROW MONEY - This option will allow you to borrow £100,000 in an
    interest free loan.  Up to £500,000 may be borrowed.

5.2 REPAY MONEY - This option will allow you to repay money (in £100,000
    sums) which you have previously borrowed.


6.  NEXT RACE - This will take you on to the racing section and the next
    race of the season.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                            THE RACING SECTION
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The racing section deals with the actual racing of your car.  This is your
opportunity to claim those all important championship points.  All the races
are run over twelve laps.  Racing the car is a very simple process explained
below:-



                             Joystick control
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Up    - Pushing up accelerates the car.
Down  - Pulling down activates the brakes.
Left  - Turns the car to the left.
Right - Turns the car to the right.


During the race your tyres will wear down, your fuel will diminish and
depending on the number of collisions you have your car will be damaged.
Pulling into the pits alleiviates these problems by changing your tyres,
refueling your car and repairing any damage.  If any of the above reach a
critical level you will be forced to retire from the race.  Your pit is
outlined in yellow with a yellow cross in the middle.

Upon completion of twelve laps the other cars will continue to race until
all the placings are complete.  You will then be informed of how many points
you have received, these will then be added to your current total of
championship points.  The various running costs of your team will be
deducted from your cash total and the next week will then begin.  At the end
of each season (16 races) you will be informed of any prize money you will
receive and it will then be added to your bank balance.  You will be
supplied with a load/save password which can be entered at the beginning of
the game, this code allows you to continue the game from the position which
you have previously reached.
