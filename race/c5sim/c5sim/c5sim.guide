@{u}c5sim - An Introduction@{uu}

c5sim is the ONLY top-down racing game which allows you to race C5's around
a track, against a friend or computer or on your own in 'time trial' mode.
Who needs fast formula 1 car racing games, when you can race a three speed
(move forward, stop and move backward by reversing the connections to the
battery, pedalling backwards or trying to go uphill.  Only the first option
is implemented in this game.) C5 around a track.  There's no pitstops,
because the C5 was plastic and would therefore just bounce off of any
obstacles.

It features a 'flat battery' mode (2 player only), and fastest lap/race
times and championship tables (which are all automatically saved) and a
track editor (albeit not a very good one).

Please note that this will not work direct from CD, because it needs to
write to the disk, so if that's where it is now, please drag the c5sim
drawer across to your hard drive or a floppy disk.

@node c5anim "About c5anim"
@{u}About c5anim (the C5 Intro Anim)@{uu}
@{i}By Chris Young 1996@{ui}

This  is an IFF ANIM5 animation (although I can convert to AVI -  bit  of  a
large file,  though - or FLC (and some other formats which I can't remember,
mostly ANIM5 variants),  if you're a sad PC user.), which has to be manually
run if you want to watch it. I did it this way for two reasons:

a)   AMOS Classic (I ain't got no compiler for AMOS Pro)  doesn't  have  any
commands for loading or playing anims.
d)   So you can choose whether to watch it or not,  without wasting valuable
time accessing disks and things.
b) and c) are a bit irrelevant to this distribution, so I removed them.

This animation,  you may or may not have realised,  is based on the sort  of
intro  bit to @{i}Lotus III@{ui} (You know,  the one where the car comes  up
the road and sort of "smacks" into the camera revealing the Lotus logo).

This  one has Sir Clive on a C5,  waving to everyone (he's happy because  he
thinks  it's  going  to be a big success)  and sort of "crashing"  into  the
camera, revealing a crack and a screen showing "Sinclair C IIIII".

@node c5c5 "About The Sinclair C5"
@{u}About the C5@{uu}

The Sinclair C5 was released in 1985.  It was (alledgedly) built because Sir
Clive had not passed his driving test.  When it failed, he designed the Zike
(zero-emmision bike,  or something)  because he didn't want to be  the  only
person  actually  using a C5.  However,  the Zike was £500-ish,   so  no-one
bought  it.   Now  he's  designing some other vehicle  (a  C5-Reliant  Robin
cross),   so presumably he has now passed his test.  Or he just  wants  more
'fun'  poked  at him.  Personally,  I reckon he should go back to  designing
computers.

@node c5menu "c5 Sim - Menu Options"
@{u}The menu for c5 sim@{uu}

1UP  box:  allows you to enter your name.  Click on the box and type in your
name, ending with @{i}Return@{ui} (max. 9 chars).

Click on 2UP box to select who you want as player 2.

None: Race against (?) the clock
Computer: Race against a computer player
Human: Race aginst someone using a joystick connected to the mouse port

If you select "Human" for player 2, you then have two further options:

Click on "Enter Name" to enter player 2's name (as described above).
Click  on  "Battery"  to toggle whether you want the "low  battery"  feature
switched on or off.
When  on,  whilst playing your c5's battery will suddenly become  flat.   To
continue racing, pedal (hit the fire button rapidly) as fast as you can.

To start, click on "Play".  Enjoy.

If  you  want  to practice a track,  or want to load a custom track  created
with  the @{"track editor" link c5tred},  click with the right mouse  button
instead.

@node c5play "c5 sim - Playing"
@{u}Playing@{uu}

Controls: Fire - move
          Left - rotate anti-clockwise
          Right - rotate clockwise

If  a  "battery flat" message appears,  rapidly hit the fire button to pedal
along to the finish.

Other useful buttons to push: 

Esc    - Exit back to menu
Ctrl-C - Quit game
Help   - Shows  you  the  way around the track by marking  points  with  the
         numbers 1-9

@node c5Race "c5 sim - Race Results"
@{u}Race Results@{uu}

At the end of each race you will see a screen showing how good you are.
The game disk @{b}must@{ub} be write-enabled, as c5-sim saves these results.

@{u}One Player Mode@{uu}

The  race results screen will display two tables:  one of fastest lap  times
for that race, the other of fastest finishing times.

@{u}Two Player Modes@{uu}

The  screen  will display the winners name at the top,  with the  number  of
races won,  represented by cups,  in this game underneath. The loser will be
displayed at the bottom of the screen.

After  all  races  are  raced,  a table will be shown showing  greatest  win
difference between the two players.  If there is no win difference, you will
not earn a place in the table.

@node c5tred "c5 sim - Track Editor"
@{u}Track editor for c5 sim@{uu}

Warning:   This track editor is "cheap and cheerful" - ie.   it's  not  very
good.  Even David Darling wouldn't say "it's absolutely brilliant!" (except,
erm, he probably would).

Move the cursor around with the arrow keys.
The  track pieces are displayed round the edge of the screen.  Click on  one
to  place it in the current position (or place the pointer over it  and  hit
@{i}space@{ui}).

After  this,   mark  sections of the track by  positioning  the  cursor  and
hitting numeric keys 0-9.

Note:  These are checkpoints to make sure the player's not cheating, and for
the computer to follow.

Position the cursor over where you want the race to start from (over the  9s
is a good idea), and select "save" from the pull-down menu.

To start a new track: Select "new" from the menu
To load and edit a track: select "load" from the menu
