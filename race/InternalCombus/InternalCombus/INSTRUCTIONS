THE AUTHORS
-----------

This game was produced by two sixth formers who met for the first time
in a Maths lesson during September of 1993.   This is the first game by
these two nutters, and is completely overshadowed by their next project: a
huge graphic arcade/adventure in the Zelda mould.

THE GAME
--------

The year is 2094.   After a nuclear war, the planet's environment has been
severely damaged, and only a few thousand human beings can be sustained on
the planet Earth...

COME ON...   DO YOU REALLY WANT A PLOT TO THIS GAME???   WELL TOUGH!  
THERE ISN'T ONE.

Internal Combustion is an overhead view racing game.    The aim is to race
around each of 12 tracks as fast as possible, and to ultimately win the
Internal Combustion League.

Various power-ups can be collected to aid or to hinder your progress.

The game can be played by upto 3 players.   If there is only one person
playing, he/she must race against a computer on one of three difficulty
levels.

Control is by joystick or keys.   Control method is chosen on the options
screen, where you choose how each car should be controlled or whether it
should be disabled.   Each car has different attributes, and beginners
should choose the porsche because it is the slowest car, and therefore the
hardest to crash.   More advanced gamers will prefer the Buggy or the
Formula One because they are faster, but trickier to drive.

The way each car differs is through its acceleration, top-speed and
traction.   If you crash a lot, you will need high acceleration.   If you
have a high top-speed you will need good traction to make the corners
without skidding.   The attributes for each car are as follows:

-----------------------------------------------
|              | PORSCHE | BUGGY  | FORMULA 1 |
-----------------------------------------------
| TOP-SPEED    | LOW     | MEDIUM | HIGH      |
| ACCELERATION | HIGH    | LOW    | MEDIUM    |
| TRACTION     | MEDIUM  | HIGH   | LOW       |
-----------------------------------------------

By collecting PLUS signs, these attributes can be upgraded, but BEWARE,
collecting NEGATIVE signs will degrade your car.

If you collect a letter B - it will give you a speed boost.
Similarly, collecting a letters S will slow your car down.
Collecting a letter F will freeze your car for a second.
Collecting gold money bags will add one to your score in the Internal
Combustion League, where as collecting black money bags will deduct one
point from your score.

Points are also allocated as follows:

Finishing in first place gives you 5 points, and getting the best lap will
give you 3 points.   If three cars are racing, 2 points will be given to
the car that finished in second place.

Finally, here is the control method:

For joystick - JOY 1 is the standard joystick port, and JOY 2 is the
standard mouse port.   Pressing fire will accelerate your car, left and
right will rotate your car, and down will brake/reverse your car.

Control by keyboard is exactly the same, and there are two options to
choose from:

KEYS 1:   A - accelerate          KEYS 2:   L - accelerate
          Z - brake/reverse                 , - brake/reverse
          X - left                          N - left
          C - right                         M - right

(comma is underneath the L on the British Keyboard)

To pause the game press `P`, and press it again to resume play.
