@node "Intro" "Description"
SnapshotF1GP is a program which can be used to take "screenshots" from
F1GP.  It is also possible to store multiple successive frames from the
game which you can then use to make an animation.
@endnode

@node "Install" "Installation"
Just used the supplied installation program.  This will ask you where you
want the program and documentation installed, and will also install the
libraries if necessary.

Alternatively, simply copy the program and documentation to the place of
your choice.  You will also need to make sure f1gp.library and iff.library
are present in LIBS:.
@endnode

@node "Usage" "Program Usage"
SnapshotF1GP is a shell based program, so you can't run it from Workbench.

You need to run it after you have started F1GP.  Once you've got it started
you can press the 'S' key while driving to take a screenshot (or if in
animation mode, start recording).  While driving the images will be stored
in a memory buffer - only when you exit the cockpit will they be saved to
disk.

SnapshotF1GP will automatically exit if F1GP does.  You can force
SnapshotF1GP to quit by pressing Ctrl-C in the shell window in which you
started it.  While SnapshotF1GP is saving the images you can also press
Ctrl-C to abort the saving process.

The following command line options are available:

@{b}BASEFILE@{ub} (default: "RAM:gpsnapshot.iff")

This is the base filename of the files that the snapshoted images are saved
to.  This name is automatically appended with a number (.001 - .999)
denoting the sequence number.  The files are named this way so that
successive frames can be turned into an animation (I use PPaint 7's
FramesToAnim script to load the frames, which can then be saved out as a
GIF anim for use on the web).

@{b}NUMFRAMES/N@{ub} (default: 1)

The maximum number of frames you would like to save in one session.  Each
frame requires 32000 bytes of memory to be allocated on startup.

@{b}ANIM/S@{ub}

Switches SnapshotF1GP into animation mode.  This means that once you press
the 'S' key, in F1GP, each updated frame is stored automatically. This
behaviour can be adjusted with the INTERVAL option.  So, for example, to
store 10 seconds of action when running the game at 10 frames per second
you will need to have 100 frames (= 3.2Mb of memory).  You can stop
recording by pressing 'S' a second time.

@{b}INTERVAL/N@{ub} (default: 1)

When in animation mode this specifies how often frames are saved.  For
example, a value of 1 means that every frame is saved; 2 means every second
frame is saved; 3 means that every third frame is saved, etc. Effectively,
this decreases the frame rate on the resulting animation.

@{b}NOCOMPRESS/S@{ub}

Turns off compression of the saved images.
@endnode

@node "Requirements" "System Requirements"
SnapshotF1GP requires @{b}Workbench / Kickstart 2.04 or higher@{ub}.

The following libraries must be present in LIBS:

   iff.library
   f1gp.library

Obviously, you'll need a copy of Geoff Crammond's @{b}Formula One Grand Prix@{ub}
(also known as World Circuit in the USA), which is published by MicroProse
Software.

@node "History" "Program History"
@{b}1.1@{ub} (19.4.2000)

 - Changed default BASENAME to "RAM:gpsnapshot.iff", as to make it
   compatible with FramesToAnim.pprx V1.2+ (the basename of f1gp.iff
   only worked with FramesToAnim.pprx V1.1 :(
 - Updated icons to the OS 3.5 standard
 - Updated f1gp.library to v36.10

@{b}1.0@{ub} (14.12.97)

 - Initial public release

@{b}0.4 beta@{ub} (28.7.97)

 - If the BASEFILE argument was greater than 25 characters, major problems
   would occur when saving images - fixed

@{b}0.3 beta@{ub} (23.7.97)

 - Modified ReadArgs Shell template slightly
 - The saving of the images is now done on SnapshotF1GP's task (which
   could lead to some new bugs ;-) instead of F1GP's - this means that:
    1. disk full retry/cancel requestors now show up
    2. saving of images can now be aborted with a Ctrl-C
    3. errors from the iff.library save routine can now be detected
       properly
 - If the disk becomes full when saving the images, no attempts are made
   to save the remaining images, and the last saved (incomplete) image
   file is deleted
 - Will no longer crash on startup if there is not enough memory for the
   chosen number of buffers

@{b}0.2 beta@{ub} (20.2.97)

 - Changed behaviour of INTERVAL option
 - Animation recordings can now be aborted and restarted while playing

@{b}0.1 beta@{ub} (16.2.97)

 - Initial private-beta release.
