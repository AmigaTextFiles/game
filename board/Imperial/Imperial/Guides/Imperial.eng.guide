@node Rules
You have to remove all the tiles from the board to win.
Here are the rules :

  - a tile must be free to be removed : a tile is free when it has no
    tiles on top of it and when you can slide it out to the left or the
    right.

  - tiles must be removed in matching pairs : tiles that compose the pair
    must be identical.

    Note : Since there is only one of each kind of Season and Flower, any
           two in the suit may match.

To see the rules, try the menu HELP/Rules.

The program know the rules and it will open a requester when an error
occurs (Tile isn't free or Tiles don't match).

The tiles used in Impérial are taken from the game of Mah-Jongg.

The object of Impérial is to remove all of the tiles from the board.

Tiles are  removed  from the board in  matching pairs.  For all of  the suits
except the Seasons and Flowers, tiles must match exactly to be removed. Since
there is only one of each kind of Season and Flower,  any two in the suit may
match.

Tiles can only be removed if they are free. A tile is free if it has no tiles
on top of it and if you can slide it out to the left or the right.
}

                                  STRATEGY


Every game has a solution.

Here are some hints to help you to find it :

- work from the outside in
- remove the end tiles as soon as you can,  especially those tiles that block
  more than one tile
- if  all four  tiles in a  matching set  are free,  you can remove  all four
  safely

@node "Important remarks"
If you have FAST memory the program will be almost twice faster than if
you only have CHIP memory.

When you edit a layout, check if it has a solution. If it hasn't, the
program will try all the possibilities to fill it before it understands
that it cannot make a playable board and this could take a very long
time. If you are patient, there's no other problem with layouts which
aren't playable.
