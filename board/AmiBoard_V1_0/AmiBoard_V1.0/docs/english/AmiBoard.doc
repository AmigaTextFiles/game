                          Documentation for AmiBoard V1.0

                                by Thorsten Greiner



Getting Started:

    First decide which Screenmode you will use with AmiBoard. Enter this  into
    the  Screenmode=...  tooltype of the AmiBoard icon. An Installer script is
    provided to install the appropriate brush for the chess pieces.

    Now, if you have an Amiga with less than 2 MB of free  RAM,  the  settings
    for  the  hashtables  may  be  too large. In this case, set the HTBits and
    PTBits tooltypes to 15 or less.

    A double click on the AmiBoard icon will start the program.


How to enter moves:

    To move a piece, click on the square it stands on, keep the  mouse  button
    pressed, move mouse to the destination square and release mouse button. If
    the move is illegal, the screen will flash.

    If the move is a pawn promotion, a requester will pop up  asking  to  what
    kind of piece the pawn will promote.

    If the Analysis/Respond automatically? entry  is  checked,  AmiBoard  will
    compute its move and make it on the board.
