			     -= Miga Mind =-

			     a small WB-game

	     Amiga-version of the well-known game 'MasterMind'
	   Written by Ekke Verheul on a very sunny first-of-May,
	   in 1990, while being too sick to leave, but (ofcorse)
	   in a good enough shape to keep on writing....games...

	    To be honest, this is the first game I wrote , and I
	   wrote it because I like the game,but noone ever plays
	   it with me. )-: If you don't know how to play it; the
	   original sais: "break the hidden code" . In this game  
	   we never use the same charakter twice,so if you can't
	   find it @#!, it's easy enough.

	   Have Fun !

	PS.
	    I have  included  the  source, but I only thought of
	   letting it swim when it was all 'ready' and since I'm
	   a poor sick man (-:  I didn't think you realy want me
	   to optimise and write smart comments, do you ?   Hum.
	   All (3!) objects can be compiled with "lc -csf -v #?"
	   and the LINK-file  is  included also. If you found an
	   easy (?) way to add some, some music would be pretty,
	   DO send me a copy... please ?
