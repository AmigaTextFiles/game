@node Installation
@chapter How to configure, compile and install @value{NAME}.
@cindex Installation

@ifclear AMYBOARD
@value{NAME} is usually distributed as source. You need to compile this
sources with any C compiler.

A shell script called @file{configure} will attempt to adapt the sources
to your system and C compiler. It is important to execute this script
before attempting to compile the sources. Usually you would use
@file{configure} like below
@example
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
@end example
@noindent
This will install the @value{NAME} binary in @file{/usr/local/bin}, man pages
in @file{/usr/local/man} etc. (@file{/usr/local} is the default, you
can omit the --prefix option, if you don't want another installation directory.)
@file{configure} will create a @file{Makefile} for you, thus you can
compile the sources with
@example
    make
@end example
@noindent
once @file{configure} is done. If all goes well and no error messages
occur, you finish the installation with
@example
    make install
@end example
@noindent
Please read the file INSTALL for details about @file{configure}, the
files it creates and how to configure @file{configure} itself.
See the file @file{FAQ} for answers to frequently asked questions.

After the installation is done, you can remove the sources.
@end ifclear

@ifset AMYBOARD
@cindex AmyBoard.prefs
@cindex Preferences
@value{NAME} requires OS 2.04, 1 MB of RAM and MUI 2.0 or later.
To play against the Amiga you need GNU Chess installed. (Aminet,
@file{game/think} directory) To play on the ICS you need a telnet
program (AmiTCP/IP, AS225 or whatever else) reading from stdin and
writing to stdout or a modem and a terminal program using
stdin/stdout as well.

After unpacking the binary archive to @file{RAM:}, you should run the
installation script by doubleclicking the icon @file{Install}. This
icon assumes that you have the Commodore @file{Installer} in your
workbench path. If you still don't have the @file{Installer}, you can
get it from @code{Aminet}, @file{util/misc} directory.

Installation will be done in one directory, say @file{WORK:},
a subdirectory @file{AmyBoard} will be created. The binary
and some icons will be in @file{WORK:AmyBoard},
config files in @file{WORK:AmyBoard/lib}.
@footnote{This has the advantage that deinstalling AmyBoard is rather
easy: Just delete the @file{AmyBoard} drawer.
However, you won't do this, won't you? ;-)}
If you have a recent version of AmyBoard in the same directory, the
old config files and icons will be copied to
@file{WORK:AmyBoard/obsolete}, so that you can reuse
them.

Once the installation script is done, you should start AmyBoard with
the @file{Work:AmyBoard/AmyBoard} icon and the
@code{MUI} prefs. Change the colors and size of the board, the
location of the window until you like it, then save these settings
with the MUI prefs.

The installation script will create a preferences file
@file{AmyBoard.prefs} for you.
This file is assumed preliminary (though perfectly usable), it is a
good idea to edit and
modify it using your favourite text editor. Things you might wish
to change are:
@itemize
@item The colors; this is done by changing the pen numbers
@code{whitePiecePen}, @code{blackPiecePen}, @code{lightSquarePen}
and @code{darkSquarePen}. Registered MUI users should keep the
values -1 which indicate to use the default MUI colors
@code{Shinepen}, @code{Shadowpen}, @code{Halfshinepen} and
@code{Halfshadowpen}, respectively, and use the MUI prefs to change
the colors.
@item Path and memory requirements of the GNU Chess binary: More memory
improves the strength of GNU Chess. (The installation script already
did this for you.) The memory requirements are changed
with the arguments @key{-C} and @key{-T}:
@table @samp
@item -C 1001 -T 4001
about 1 MByte
@item -C 3001 -T 20001
about 2 MByte
@item -C 4001 -T 30001
about 2.5 MByte
@item -C 6001 -T 40001
@end table
@noindent
To tell @value{NAME} that the GNU Chess binary is in
@file{Fun:gnuchess-4.0.pl74} and you want it to allocate about
1 MByte RAM you would enter
@example
    firstChessProgram=Fun:gnuchess-4.0.pl74/gnuchessx -C 1001 -T 4001
    secondChessProgram=Fun:gnuchess-4.0.pl74/gnuchessx -C 1001 -T 4001
@end example

It is important to use the complete path here, as the AmigaDOS
function @code{LoadSeg} ignores your path settings.
@xref{GNU Chess options}.
@item The default time settings of GNU Chess: Variables
@code{movesPerSesssion} and @code{timeControl}.
@xref{GNU Chess options}.
@item Your favourite ICS host (@code{icsHost}) and port number
(@code{icsPort}). (You probably won't need to change the defaults,
as the installation script can create ICS icons for different
hosts, which override these settings.)
@xref{ICS options}.
@item The name of your telnet or terminal program. (Note, that this
@strong{must} use stdin and stdout!) The installation script
lets you select one. (Again, note that you have to use
the complete path.) @xref{ICS options}.
@xref{Serial ICS connection}.
@end itemize
@noindent
For the full set of @value{NAME}'s options see @xref{Invocation}.

Be sure, that the programs stack is no less than 10000 bytes. This
is especially important, when running the program from Toolmanager,
as the default value of Toolmanagers @code{Exec Objects} are
4096 bytes only.


If you would like to recompile @value{NAME}, you
currently need either @code{Dice} or @code{gcc}. Edit the
@file{Makefile}, remove the comments from your compilers switches
and comment the others in. @samp{DMake} or @samp{Make}, respectively,
 will do the compilation for you.

It shouldn't be a serious problem to use @code{SAS/C}, as I tried to
keep the code compatible. However, I cannot test it, as I don't have
this compiler. (Gifts welcome. :-) By using a Unix compatible front
end like @file{dev/c/cc.lha} from Aminet, you should even be able
to use the same @file{Makefile}.
@end ifset


@node Invocation
@chapter Command options supported by @value{NAME}.
@cindex Invocation
@cindex Options
@ifset AMYBOARD
On Unix it is usual behaviour to implement command options with names
like @samp{-v} (verbose) or @samp{-h} help. If a program like
@value{NAME} has lots of possible options, it makes sense to drop these
short option names and instead use option names like @samp{-verbose} or
@samp{-help}. This is almost like on the Amiga where one would use
@samp{verbose} or @samp{help}.

To be both compatible to XBoard and have a real Amiga program I decided
to allow both: With @value{NAME} you may use either @samp{-debug} or
@samp{debug}, whatever you want. Thus in the following words beginning
with a hyphen (@key{-}) are option names, but you may omit the hyphen.
@end ifset

@value{NAME} always runs in one of 4 possible modes:
@table @samp
@item @value{LCNAME} [options]
starts @value{NAME} as a GNU chess interface. As an interface to GNU
Chess, @value{NAME} lets you play a game against the machine, set up
arbitrary positions, force variations, or watch a game between two
machines.
@item @value{LCNAME} -ics [options]
lets @value{NAME} act as an interface to the Internet Chess Server
(ICS). You can play against other ICS users, observe games they are
playing, or review games that have recently finished. @xref{ICS}.
@item @value{LCNAME} -ncp [options]
allows to use @value{NAME} as a simple chessboard to play through
games. It will read and write game files and allow you to play
through variations manually. You can use it to browse games off the
net or review GNU Chess, ICS, and correspondence games you have saved.
These features are available at all times; even if you do not have
access to GNU Chess or the ICS, you can use them.
@item cmail
will use @value{NAME} as an interface to electronic mail
correspondence chess.
@ifclear AMYBOARD
@xref{CMail}.
@end ifclear
@ifset AMYBOARD
(This possibility is currently not given on the Amiga: @file{cmail}
is a @file{Perl} script which assumes a full mail setup, both
usually not given on the Amiga. Probably someone would be interested
in converting @file{cmail} into an @code{ARexx} script?
@end ifset
@end table

@ifclear AMYBOARD
Most of the @value{NAME} options have both a long name and a short
name. To turn a boolean option on or off from the command line,
either give its long name followed by the value @code{true} or
@code{false} (@samp{-longOptionName true}), or give just the short
name to turn the option on (@samp{-opt}), or the short name
preceded by @key{x} to turn the option off (@samp{-xopt}). For
options that take strings or numbers as values, you can use the
long or short option names interchangeably.

Each option corresponds to an X resource with the same name, so
you can set options in your @samp{.Xdefaults} file if you like.
For options that have two names, the longer one is the name of
the corresponding X resource; the short name is not recognized
in @file{.Xdefaults}. To turn a boolean option on or off in your
@file{.Xdefaults} file, give its long name followed by the value
@code{true} or @code{false}:
@example
    XBoard*longOptionName: true
@end example
@end ifclear

@ifset AMYBOARD
Most of the @value{NAME} options have both a long name and a short
name. You have three possibilities to set the options:
@enumerate
@item By editing the preferences file @file{PROGDIR:lib/AmyBoard.prefs},
where @file{PROGDIR:} indicates the directory of the @value{NAME}
binary. The lines of the file are interpreted as if they were
toolkit options, empty lines or lines beginning with a semicolon are
treated as comments.
@item By editing an icons toolkit options.
@item By supplying arguments with the CLI command line.
@end enumerate
@noindent
Of course toolkit options or CLI arguments override settings of the
prefs file.

The argument parsing behaves in general much like ReadArgs(), except for
boolean arguments which are a mixture of the /S and /T switches: In
general, they behave like /S arguments in the CLI, but like /T in the
toolkit options or in the prefs file. To be precise, you may use
something like
@example
    amyboard ncp
@end example
@noindent
in the CLI (indicating that the value of ncp should be toggled), but not
as a toolkit option or as a prefs file entry: In that case you have to
explicitly state something like
@example
    NCP true
@end example
@noindent
(For obvious reasons this version conflicts with the above.) However,
you may always write
@example
    NCP=false
@end example
@noindent
As usual, option names are case-insensitive.

@cindex -movesPerSession, option
Each player begins with the specified amount of time on his clock. If
a player makes the specified number of moves before his clock runs out,
@value{NAME} adds the specified amount of time to his clock.
Default: 40 moves in 5 minutes.

@ifclear AMYBOARD
@item -clock or -clockMode
@cindex -clock, option
@cindex -clockMode, option
Determines whether or not to display the chess clocks. If clockMode is
@samp{false}, the clocks are not shown, but the side that is to play next
is still highlighted. Also, unless @code{searchTime} or @code{searchDepth}
is set, GNU Chess still keeps track of the clock time and uses it to
determine how fast to make its moves.
@end ifclear

@item -st or -searchTime minutes[:seconds]
@cindex -st, option
@cindex -searchTime, option
Tells GNU Chess to spend at most the given amount of time
searching for each of its moves. Without this option, GNU Chess
chooses its search time based on the number of moves and amount
of time remaining until the next time control.
@ifclear AMYBOARD
Setting this option also sets @code{clockMode} to false.
@end ifclear

@item -sd or -searchDepth number
@cindex -sd, option
@cindex -searchDepth, option
Tells GNU Chess to look ahead at most the given number of moves
when searching for a move to make. Without this option, GNU
Chess chooses its search depth based on the number of moves and
amount of time remaining until the next time control.
@ifclear AMYBOARD
Setting this option also sets @code{clockMode} to false.
@end ifclear

@item -thinking or -showThinking
@cindex -thinking, option
@cindex -showThinking, option
If this option is set, GNU Chess's notion of the score and best
line of play from the current position is displayed as it is
thinking. The score indicates how many pawns ahead (or if nega-
tive, behind) GNU Chess thinks it is. In matches between two
machines, the score is prefixed by @key{W} or @key{B} to indicate
whether it is showing White's thinking or Black's.

@item -mm or -matchMode
@cindex -mm, option
@cindex -matchMode, option
Automatically runs a game between two chess programs.  If the
@code{loadGameFile} or @code{loadPositionFile} option is set,
@value{NAME} starts
the game with the given opening moves or the given position;
otherwise, the game starts with the standard initial chess position.
If the @code{saveGameFile} option is set, a move record for the
match is appended to the specified file. If the @code{savePositionFile}
option is set, the final position reached in the match is appended
to the specified file. When the match is over, @value{NAME}
exits. Default: false.

@item -fcp or -firstChessProgram program
@cindex -fcp, option
@cindex -firstChessProgram, option
Name of first chess program.  In matches between two machines,
this program plays Black. Default: @file{gnuchessx}.

@item -scp or -secondChessProgram program
@cindex -scp, option
@cindex -secondChessProgram, option
Name of second chess program, if needed. In matches between two
machines, this program plays White; otherwise it is not started.
Default: @file{gnuchessx}.

@ifclear AMYBOARD
@item -fh or -firstHost host
@itemx -sh or -secondHost host
@cindex -fh, option
@cindex -firstHost, option
@cindex -sh, option
@cindex -secondHost, option
Hosts on which the chess programs are to run. The default for
each is @file{localhost}. If you specify another host, @value{NAME}
uses @file{rsh} (1) to run the chess program there. (You can substitute a
different remote shell program for rsh using the @code{remoteShell}
option described below.)
@end ifclear

@item -initString string
@cindex -initString, option
The string that is sent to initialize the chess program.
Default:
@example
    new
    beep
    random
    easy
@end example
@noindent
Setting this option from the command line is tricky, because you must
type in real newline characters. In most shells you can do this by
entering a @samp{\\} character followed by a newline. It is easier to set
the option from your @file{.Xdefaults} file; in that case you can
include the character sequence @samp{\\n} in the string, and it will
be converted to a newline.

If you change this option, don't remove the @samp{new} and @samp{beep}
commands. You can remove the @samp{random} command if you like;
including it causes GNU Chess to randomize its move selection
slightly so that it doesn't play the same moves in every game.
(Even without @samp{random}, GNU Chess randomizes its choice of moves
from its opening book.) You can also remove @samp{easy} if you like;
including it toggles easy mode off, causing GNU Chess to think
on your time. That is, if @samp{easy} is included in the initString,
GNU Chess thinks on your time; if not, it does not. (Yes, this
does seem backwards, doesn't it!) You can also try adding other
commands to the initString; see the GNU Chess documentation for
details.

@item -whiteString string
@itemx -blackString string
@cindex -whiteString, option
@cindex -blackString, option
These options control what is sent when the Machine White and
Machine Black buttons are selected. This is mostly for compati-
bility with obsolete versions of GNU Chess.

@ifset AMYBOARD
@item -childPriority
@itemx -childStack
@cindex -childPriority, option
@cindex -childStack, option
set the respective settings of the process to be created for GNU Chess.
Note, that the GNU Chess task requires a relatively big stack, compared
to true Amiga programs: Do not use less than 50000 bytes. By increasing
GNU Chess's memory requirements you probably increase it's stack
requirements too: Thus you might need to change the default of 100000
bytes.@footnote{It would have been possible to compile GNU Chess with
dynamic stack checking. However, this would give overhead with
@strong{every} function call and result in a drastical loss of playing
strength, so I decided not to use this feature.}

be needed to add a empty line at the top of @file{.icsrc}.
@end ifset

@item -autocomm or -autoComment
@cindex -autocomm, option
@cindex -autoComment, option
If @code{autoComment} is True, any remarks made on ICS while you are observing or
playing a game are recorded as a comment on the current move.  This includes
remarks made with the ICS commands @kbd{say}, @kbd{tell}, @kbd{whisper},
and @kbd{kibitz}.
Limitation: remarks that you type yourself are not recognized;
@value{NAME} scans only the output from ICS, not the input you type to it.
Default: False.

@item -autoflag or -autoCallFlag
@cindex -autoflag, option
@cindex -autoCallFlag, option
If @code{autoCallFlag} is true and your opponent runs out of time
before you do, @value{NAME} will automatically call his flag, claiming
a win on time (or a draw if you do not have mating material).
Default: false.

@item -autobs or -autoObserve
@cindex -autobs, option
@cindex -autoObserve, option
If @code{autoObserve} is true and you add a player to your @code{gnotify}
list on ICS, @value{NAME} will automatically observe all of that
player's games, unless you are doing something else (such as
observing or playing a game of your own) when one starts.
Default: false.

@item -quiet or -quietPlay
@cindex -quiet, option
@cindex -quietPlay, option
If this option is true, @value{NAME} will automatically issue a
@example
    set shout 0

command whenever you start an ICS game and a
@example
    set shout 1
@end example
command whenever you finish one. Default: false.

@item -icshost or -internetChessServerHost host
@cindex -icshost, option
@cindex -internetChessServerHost, option

@item -gateway host-name
@cindex -gateway, option
If this option is set to a host name, @value{NAME} uses @file{rsh} (1) to run
the @file{telnet} (1) program on the given host to communicate with the
Internet Chess Server instead of using its own internal implementation
of the telnet protocol. You can substitute a different remote shell

internal implementation of the telnet protocol to communicate with the
ICS. @xref{Firewalls}.
@end ifclear

@item -telnetProgram prog-name
@cindex -telnetProgram, option
This option gives the name of the telnet program to be used with

@cindex -internetChessServerCommPort, option
@cindex -icscomm, option
If this option is set, @value{NAME} communicates with the ICS through
the given character I/O device instead of opening a TCP connection.
Use this option if your system does not have any kind of
Internet connection itself (not even a SLIP or PPP connection),
but you do have dialup access (or a hardwired terminal line) to
an Internet service provider from which you can telnet to the
ICS.

The support for this option in @value{NAME} is minimal. You need to
set all communication parameters and tty modes before you enter
@value{NAME}.

Use a script something like this:
@example
    stty raw -echo 9600 > /dev/tty00
    @value{NAME} -ics -icscomm /dev/tty00
@end example

Here replace @samp{/dev/tty00} with the name of the device that your
modem is connected to. You might have to add several more
options to these stty commands. See the man pages for @file{stty} (1)
and @code{tty} (4) if you run into problems. Also, on many systems stty
works on its standard input instead of standard output, so you
have to use @key{<} instead of @key{>}.

If you are using linux, try starting with the script below.
Change it as necessary for your installation.
@example
    ####################################################
    #!/bin/sh -f
    # configure modem and fire up @value{NAME}

    # configure modem
    (
    stty 2400 ; stty raw ; stty hupcl ; stty -clocal
    stty ignbrk ; stty ignpar ; stty ixon ; stty ixoff
    stty -iexten ; stty -echo
    ) < /dev/modem
    @value{NAME} -ics -icscomm /dev/modem
    ####################################################
@end example
@noindent
After you start @value{NAME} in this way, type whatever commands are
necessary to dial out to your Internet provider and log in.
Then telnet to ICS, using a command like
@example
    telnet chess.lm.com 5000
@end example
@noindent
Important: See the paragraph below about extra echoes.
@xref{Limitations}.

@ifset AMYBOARD
@item -icsWindow
@cindex -icsWindow, option
is a specification of a window to open for ICS input/output. This is
especially useful, if you start @value{NAME} from Workbench: The CLI
window is used otherwise. Note that setting this option @strong{forces}
a separate window, even if you start the program from the CLI. However,
@value{NAME} does not detach from the CLI (except when using
@kbd{Run >nil: <nil:}), thus you better set this option in the icon
toolkits only.

@cindex -loadGameIndex, option
If the @code{loadGameFile} option is set, @value{NAME} loads the specified
game file at startup. The file name @file{-} specifies the standard
input. If there is more than one game in the file, @value{NAME}
pops up a menu of the available games, with entries based on their PGN tags.
If the @code{loadGameIndex} option is set to @samp{N}, the menu is suppressed
and the N th game found in the file is loaded immediately.
The menu is also suppressed if @code{matchMode} is enabled or if the game file
is a pipe; in these cases the first game in the file is loaded immediately.

@item -td or -timeDelay seconds
@cindex -td, option
@cindex -timeDelay, option
Time delay between moves during @samp{Load Game}. Fractional seconds

move if you are observing a game on the Internet Chess Server).
The bell is not rung after moves you make or moves read from a

@item -queen or -alwaysPromoteToQueen
@cindex -queen, option
@cindex -alwaysPromoteToQueen, option
If this option is false (the default), @value{NAME} brings up a dialog

@cindex -flipView, option
If you are playing a game on the ICS, the board is always
oriented at the start of the game so that your pawns move from
the bottom of the window towards the top. Otherwise, the starting is

@item -bm or -bitmapDirectory
@cindex -bm, option
@cindex -bitmapDirectory, option
By default, @value{NAME} uses a set of compiled-in bitmaps for its
pieces. If the @code{bitmapDirectory} option is set at runtime, piece
bitmaps are taken from files in the specified directory instead.
The first character of a bitmap name gives the piece it
represents (p, n, b, r, q, or k); the next characters give the
size in pixels (80, 64, or 40), and the following character
indicates whether the piece is solid or outline (s or o). Bitmap
file names have the extension @file{.bm}. The outline bitmaps
are used only in monochrome mode.

Two sets of bitmaps are distributed with @value{NAME}. Those in the
directory @file{bitmaps} are normally compiled in as the default.
Those in the @file{bitmaps.xchess} directory can be selected at runtime
with the @code{bitmapDirectory} option. If you want to compile in the
latter set as the default, rename the @file{bitmaps} directory to
@file{bitmaps.fselch} and the @file{bitmaps.xchess} directory to
@file{bitmaps}; then recompile @value{NAME}.

or in fact almost any file that contains moves in algebraic
notation. If the file includes a PGN position (FEN tag), or an
@value{NAME} position diagram bracketed by @samp{[--} and @samp{--]}
before the first move, the game starts from that position. Text
enclosed in parentheses, square brackets, or curly braces is assumed to

    [Result "1-0"]
@end example
@noindent
Any characters that do not match this syntax are silently ignored. Note that
the PGN standard requires all games to have at least the seven tags shown
above. Any that you omit will be filled in by @value{NAME}
with @samp{?} (unknown value), or @samp{-} (inapplicable value).

@item Edit Comment
@cindex Edit Comment, Menuitem
Adds or modifies a comment on the current position. Comments are
saved by @samp{Save Game} and are displayed by @samp{Load Game},
@samp{Forward}, and @samp{Backward}.

@item Pause
@cindex Pause, Menuitem
Pauses updates to the board, and if you are playing against GNU Chess,
also pauses your clock. To continue, select @samp{Pause} again, and the
display will automatically update to the latest position.
The @key{P} button and keyboard @key{p} key are equivalents.

If you select Pause when you are playing against GNU Chess and
it is not your move, GNU Chess's clock
will continue to run and it will eventually make a move, at which point
both clocks will stop. Since board updates are paused, however,
you will not see the move until you exit from Pause mode (or select Forward).
This behavior is meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

If you select Pause while you are in
@code{examine} mode on ICS, you can step backward and forward in the
current history of the examined game without affecting the other observers
and examiners. Select Pause again to reconnect yourself to the current state
of the game on ICS.

If you select @samp{Pause} while you are loading a game, the game stops
loading. You can load more moves manually by selecting @samp{Forward}, or
resume automatic loading by selecting @samp{Pause} again.

@item Backward
@cindex Backward, Menuitem
@cindex <, Button
Steps backward through a series of remembered moves.
The @key{[<]} button and the "b" key are equivalents.

In most modes, @samp{Backward} only lets you look back at old positions;
it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are playing against
GNU Chess, playing or observing a game on the ICS, or loading a game.
If you select @samp{Backward} in any of these situations, you will not
be allowed to make a different move. Use @samp{Retract Move} or
@samp{Edit Game} if you want to change past moves.

If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @samp{Backward}
depends on whether @value{NAME} is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, @samp{Backward} issues the ICS backward command, which backs up
everyone's view of the game and allows you to make a different
move. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Backward} only backs up your local
view.

@item Forward
@cindex Forward, Menuitem
@cindex >, Button
Steps forward through a series of remembered moves (undoing the
effect of @samp{Backward}) or forward through a game file. The
@key{[>]} button and the @key{f} key are equivalents.

If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of Forward
depends on whether @value{NAME} is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, @samp{Forward} issues the ICS forward command, which moves
everyone's view of the game forward along the current line. If
Pause mode is on, @samp{Forward} only moves your local view forward,
and it will not go past the position that the game was in when
you paused.

@item Back to Start
@cindex Back to Start, Menuitem
@cindex <<, Button
Jumps backward to the first remembered position in the game.
The @key{[<<]} button and the shifted @key{B} key are equivalents.

In most modes, Back to Start only lets you look back at old
positions; it does not retract moves. This is the case if you
are playing against GNU chess, playing or observing a game on
the ICS, or loading a game. If you select @samp{Back to Start} in any
of these situations, you will not be allowed to make different
moves. Use @samp{Retract Move} or @samp{Edit Game} if you want to change past
moves; or use Reset to start a new game.

If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @samp{Back to
Start} depends on whether @value{NAME} is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, @samp{Back to Start} issues the ICS @samp{backward 999999}
command, which backs up everyone's view of the game to the start and
allows you to make different moves. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Back
to Start} only backs up your local view.

@item Forward to End
@cindex Forward to End, Menuitem
@cindex >>, Button
Jumps forward to the last remembered position in the game. The
@key{[>>]} button and the shifted @key{F} key are equivalents.

If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @samp{Forward to
End} depends on whether @value{NAME} is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, @samp{Forward to End} issues the ICS @samp{forward 999999}
command, which moves everyone's view of the game forward to the end of
the current line. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Forward to End} only moves
your local view forward, and it will not go past the position

@item Retract Move
@cindex Retract Move, Menuitem
Retracts your last move. In GNU Chess mode, you can do this only
after GNU Chess has replied to your move; if GNU Chess is still

@table @asis
@item Iconize
Pressing the @key{i} or @key{c} key iconizes @value{NAME}. The graphical
icon displays a white knight if it is white's move, or a black knight,
if it is Black's move. If your X window manager displays only text icons,
not graphical ones, check its documentation; there is probably a way to
enable graphical icons. If you are running the Motif window manager
@file{mwm} (1), add these lines to your @file{.Xdefaults} file and
restart mwm:
@example
Mwm*iconDecoration: activelabel label image
Mwm*@value{NAME}*iconImageBackground: White
Mwm*@value{NAME}*iconImageForeground: Black
@end example
@noindent
The first line above enables graphical icons in mwm; you don't need it
if you already have them. The next two lines force the white knights to
come out white and the black kinghts black. Unfortunately these resources
can't be set from inside @value{NAME}; you have to set them in your
@file{.Xdefaults} file.
@end table

You can add or remove shortcut keys using the X resources
@code{form.translations}. Here is an example of what would go in your
@file{.Xdefaults} file:
@example

Binding a key to @code{NothingProc} makes it do nothing, thus removing
it as a shortcut key. The @value{NAME} keys that can be bound to keys

@node ICS
@chapter Using @value{NAME} as an ICS client
@cindex ICS
@cindex ICS, addresses
What is this ICS thing, you probably ask? @dfn{ICS} (Internet chess server,
also known as @dfn{ICC}, Internet chess club, which is the commercial
version) is an internet service very similar to irc: People use a client
program like @value{NAME} to connect to a server program on a remote host,
the so-called server. There they meet to play chess, watch other people's
games or just chat: In fact, the atmoshpere is full of virtual shouts,
much like a usual chess club.

ICS is getting more and more important for chess players: Currently
(March 1995) there are some thousand registered users on the different
ICS hosts and it is not unusual to meet 200-300 of them on ICC in
the evening hours. The number is increasing rapidly.

Usually you are using @file{telnet} (1) to connect to the chess server.
(@value{NAME} does this for you.)
@ifclear AMYBOARD
For a detailed description of options that control the connection, see
@ref{ICS options}.
@end ifclear
@ifset AMYBOARD
@cindex SLIP
@cindex PPP
However, @file{telnet} assumes a @code{SLIP} or @code{PPP} connection
or something similar to the Internet. @value{NAME} is not bound to this,
however: You can replace @file{telnet} by any program reading from stdin
and writing to stdout, for example a simple terminal program.

@menu
* Serial ICS connection::   Using a terminal program to connect to ICS.
@end menu
@end ifset

When using @value{NAME} as an ICS client, the program seems to be split
into two parts: The first one is the chessboard, as usual. Additionally
you are using the terminal window as a possibility to type in
commands and read information not available on the chessboard.

The first time you are using the terminal is to enter your login name
and password, if you are a registered player. (You don't need to do
this manually, the @code{icsLogon} option may do this for you.
@pxref{ICS options}) If not, enter any name.
If someone has already registered under that name, you'll be
asked for a password; just hit return and try again.

You may use the terminal window to enter commands. Useful ICS commands
include
@table @kbd
@item help <topic>
@cindex help, ICS command
to get help on the given <topic>. (To get a list of possible topics type
@dfn{help} without topic.) Obviously this is a very important command
for new users. :-) It is recommended netiquette to use it before asking
other people.

For example @kbd{help register} tells you how to become a registered
ICS player.
@item who <flags>
@cindex who, ICS command
to see a list of people displayed who are are logged on. Administrators
(people you should ask first, if you have something to ask) are marked
with the character @key{*}, an asterisk. The <flags> allow you to
display only selected players: For example, @kbd{who of} shows a
list of players which are interested in playing, but do not have
an opponent.
@item games
@cindex games, ICS command
to see what games are being played
@item match <player> [<mins>] [<inc>]
to challenge another player to a game. Both opponents get <mins> minutes
for the game, <inc> seconds will be added after each move.
If another player challenges you, the server asks, if you want to
accept the challenge: Use the @kbd{accept} or @kbd{decline} commands
to answer.
@item accept
@itemx decline
@cindex accept, ICS command
@cindex decline, ICS command
to accept or decline another players offer; this is both used to start a
game (if the player challenges you) or to terminate the game, for
example, if your opponent offers you a @kbd{draw}, to @kbd{adjourn} or
@kbd{abort} the game. @xref{Action Menu}.

If you have more than one pending offer (for example, if more than one
player is challenging you, or if your opponent offers both a draw and
to adjourn the game), you have to supply additional information, either
by typing something like @kbd{accept <player>}, @kbd{accept draw} or
using a command like
@item draw
@itemx adjourn
@itemx abort
@cindex draw, ICS command
@cindex adjourn, ICS command
@cindex abort, ICS command
offers your opponent to terminate a game by mutual agreement. (Adjourned
games may be continued later.) The server asks your opponent, so he can
either @kbd{decline} your offer or accept it by typing the same command
or @kbd{accept}. (Your opponent won't be asked, of course, if he lacks
material to win, for example.)
@item finger <player>
@cindex finger, ICS command
to get informations about the given <player>. (Default: yourself.)
@item vars
@cindex vars, ICS command
to get a list of personal settings
@item set <var> <value>
@cindex set, ICS command
to modify these settings
@item observe <player>
@cindex observe, ICS command
to observe an ongoing game of the given <player>.
@item examine
@itemx oldmoves
@cindex examine, ICS command
@cindex oldmoves, ICS command
to review a recently completed game
@end table

Whenever you ask to observe an ongoing game, review a completed game,
or resume an adjourned game, @value{NAME} retrieves and parses the list
of past moves from the ICS, so you can review them with the @samp{Forward}
and @samp{Backward} commands or save them with @samp{Save Game}.
Some special @value{NAME} features are activated when you are
in examine mode on ICS.

@subsection Using a terminal program to connect to ICS.
@cindex Serial ICS connection
@cindex ICS, Serial connection
@cindex IPDial
@cindex Terminal program
As already mentioned, you may connect to the ICS with any terminal
program, provided that it can read from stdin and write to stdout.
An example (which is well suuported by the installation script)
is @code{IPDial}, which you find in the @file{comm/tcp} directory
on Aminet. However, you need to connect to a host with Internet
access which will act as a gateway to the ICS server.

Usually you do the following:
@itemize
@item Create a login script for your terminal program that allows
to login to your remote host. Probably you add a line like
@example
    SEND "telnet chess.lm.com 5000"
@end example
@noindent
to the login script: This would make the remote host to create
a connection to the ICS server chess.lm.com (ICC) as the very first
command to execute. The installation script can create such a
login script for you, to be used by @code{IPDial}
(@file{PROGDIR:lib/IcsLogin.IPDial}, where @file{PROGDIR:} is the
directory of the AmyBoard binary). However, you
need to edit it manually, insert your remote hosts phone number,
your login name and password, for example.
@item Create an icon that calls your terminal program like it would
do with telnet; the installation script can do this for you.

@ifclear AMYBOARD
@node Firewalls
@chapter Connecting to the ICS through a firewall.
By default, @value{NAME} communicates with an Internet Chess Server
by opening a TCP socket directly from the machine it is running on
to the ICS. If there is a firewall between your machine and the ICS,
this won't work. Here are some recipes for getting around common
kinds of firewalls using special options to @value{NAME}.
Important: See the paragraph in the below about extra echoes.
@xref{Limitations}.

Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can telnet
to a firewall host, log in, and then telnet from there to ICS.
Let's say the firewall is called @samp{fire.wall.com}. Set
command-line options as follows:
@example
    xboard -ics -icshost fire.wall.com -icsport 23
@end example
@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:
@example
    XBoard*internetChessServerHost: fire.wall.com
    XBoard*internetChessServerPort: 23
@end example
@noindent
Then when you run @value{NAME} in ICS mode, you will be prompted
to log in to the firewall host. (This works because port 23 is the
standard telnet login service.) Do so, then telnet to ICS, using a
command like @samp{telnet chess.lm.com 5000}, or whatever command
the firewall provides for telnetting to port 5000.

If your firewall lets you telnet (or rlogin) to remote hosts, but
doesn't let you telnet to port 5000, you will have to find some
other host outside the firewall that does let you do this, and
hop through it. For instance, suppose you have an account at
@samp{foo.edu}. Follow the recipe above, but instead of typing
@samp{telnet chess.lm.com 5000} to the firewall, type
@samp{telnet foo.edu} (or @samp{rlogin foo.edu}), log in there, and
then type @samp{telnet chess.lm.com 5000}.

Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can use rsh
to run programs on a firewall host, and that host can telnet to ICS.
Let's say the firewall is called @samp{rsh.wall.com}. Set
command-line options as follows:
@example
    xboard -ics -gateway rsh.wall.com -icshost chess.lm.com
@end example
@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:
@example
    XBoard*gateway: rsh.wall.com
    XBoard*internetChessServerHost: chess.lm.com
@end example
Then when you run @value{NAME} in ICS mode, it will connect to
the ICS by using @file{rsh} to run the command @samp{telnet
chess.lm.com 5000} on host @samp{rsh.wall.com}.
-
Suppose that you can telnet anywhere you want, but you have to
run a special program called @file{ptelnet} to do so.

First, we'll consider the easy case, in which
@samp{ptelnet chess.lm.com 5000} gets you to the chess server.
In this case set command line options as follows:
@example
    xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet
@end example
@noindent
Or in your \&.Xdefaults file:
@example
    XBoard*useTelnet: true
    XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
@end example
@noindent
Then when you run @value{NAME} in ICS mode, it will issue the
command @samp{ptelnet chess.lm.com 5000} to connect to the ICS.

Next, suppose that @samp{ptelnet chess.lm.com 5000} doesn't work;
that is, your @file{ptelnet} program doesn't let you connect to
alternative ports. In this case, you will have to find some other
host outside the firewall that does let you do this, and hop
through it. For instance, suppose you have an account at
@samp{foo.edu}. Set command line options as follows:
@example
    xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet -icshost foo.edu -icsport ""
@end example
@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:
@example
    XBoard*useTelnet: true
    XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
    XBoard*internetChessServerHost: foo.edu
    XBoard*internetChessServerPort:
@end example
@noindent
Then when you run @value{NAME} in ICS mode, it will issue the
command @samp{ptelnet foo.edu} to connect to your account at
@samp{foo.edu}. Log in there, then type @samp{telnet chess.lm.com 5000}.

When you receive a message from an opponent containing a move in one of
your games, simply pipe the message through @file{cmail}. In some mailers
this is as simple as typing @kbd{| cmail} when viewing the message, while in
others you may have to save the message to a file and do @kbd{cmail < file}
at the command line. In either case @file{cmail} will display the game using
@value{NAME}. If you didn't exit @value{NAME} when you made your first move
then @file{cmail} will do its best to use the existing @value{NAME} instead
of starting a new one. As before, simply make a move and select
@samp{Mail Move} from the @samp{File} menu. @xref{File Menu}. @file{cmail}
will try to use the
@value{NAME} that was most recently used to display the current game. This
means that many games can be in progress simultaneously, each with its own
active @value{NAME}.

If you want to look at the history or explore a variation, go ahead, but
you must return to the current position before @value{NAME} will allow you
to mail a move. If you edit the game's history you must select
@samp{Reload Same Game} from the @samp{File} menu to get back to the original
position, then make the move you want and select @samp{Mail Move}.
As before, if you decide you aren't ready to make a move just yet you can
either select @samp{Exit} without sending a move or just leave
@value{NAME} running until you are ready.

Because @value{NAME} can now detect checkmate and stalemate, @file{cmail}
now handles game termination sensibly. As well as resignation, the
@samp{Action} menu now allows draws to be offered and accepted for
@file{cmail} games.

For multi-game messages, only unfinished and just-finished games will be
included in email messages. When all the games are finished, they are
archived in the user's archive directory, and similarly in the opponent's
when he or she pipes the final message through @file{cmail}. The archive
file name includes the date the game was started.

It's possible to have a @file{cmail} message carry more than one game.
This feature was implemented to handle IECG (International Email Chess
Group) matches, where a match consists of 1 game as white and 1 as black,
with moves transmitted simultaneously. In case there are more general uses,
@file{cmail} itself places no limit on the number of black/white games
contained in a message; however, @value{NAME} does.


@node CMail trouble
@section Known CMail problems.
It's possible that a strange conjunction of conditions may occasionally
mean that @file{cmail} has trouble reactivating an existing
@value{NAME}. If this should happen, simply trying it again should work.
If not, remove the file that stores the @value{NAME}'s PID
(@file{game.pid}) or use the @samp{-xreuse} option to force
@file{cmail} to start a new @value{NAME}.

Versions of @file{cmail} after 2.16 no longer understand the old file format
that @value{NAME} used to use and so cannot be used to correspond with
anyone using an older version.

Versions of @file{cmail} older than 2.11 do not handle multi-game messages,
so multi-game correspondence is not possible with opponents using an older
version.

@node Environment
@chapter Environment variables
@cindex Environment variables
@cindex CHESSDIR
Game and position files are found in a directory named by the
@code{CHESSDIR} environment variable. If this variable is not set, the
current working directory is used. If @code{CHESSDIR} is set,
@value{NAME} actually changes its working directory to
@code{$CHESSDIR}, so GNU Chess listing files will also be stored there
as well.
@end ifclear


@node Limitations
@chapter Known limitations
@cindex Limitations
There is no way for two people running copies of @value{NAME} to play
each other without going through the @code{Internet Chess Server}.

The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.

The internal move legality tester does not look at the game history,
so in some cases it misses illegal castling or en passant captures.
However, if you attempt such a move when using GNU Chess (or the ICS),
it will reject the move, and @value{NAME} will undo it and let you
try another. Also FEN positions saved by @value{NAME} do not include
correct information about whether castling or en passant are legal.

In ICS mode @value{NAME} cannot handle observing (and/or playing) more
than one game at a time. It may get confused if you try to do this,
thought it tries to recover gracefully. Select @samp{Reset} from the
@samp{File} menu, if you have problems. @xref{File Menu}.

Your password may get echoed when you log on to the ICS.

If you are connecting to the ICS by running telnet on an Internet provider
or firewall host, you may find that each line you type is echoed back an extra
time after you hit Return. If your Internet provider is a Unix system, you can
probably turn its echo off by typing
@example
    stty -echo
@end example
after you log in, and/or by typing @key{^E-Return} (@key{control-E} followed by
the @key{Return} key) to the telnet program after you have logged into ICS.
It is a good idea to do this if you can, because the extra echo can
occasionally confuse @value{NAME}'s parsing routines.

The @file{.icsrc} file does not work properly when you
connect to ICS through a Unix gateway host with @code{useTelnet} mode.
The Unix login process apparently discards type-ahead. @xref{ICS options}.
@ifset AMYBOARD
Due to a problemm which I did not figure out yet, it might be needed to add
an empty line to the top of the @file{.icsrc} file.
@end ifset

Some @value{NAME} functions may not work with versions of GNU Chess earlier
than 4.0, patchlevel 73.

@node Caveats
@unnumbered What you should keep in mind
@cindex Caveats
@ifclear AMYBOARD
@value{NAME} depends on the Xt Intrinsics and Athena Widget
Set of X11R4 or later. In particular, X11R3 just won't do.

@value{NAME} works best with version 4.0 of GNU Chess. Older
versions may also work, but they are unsupported. The GNU Chess project
requests that you get a current copy of GNU Chess rather than using
older, bug-ridden versions. GNU Chess must be compiled with the
@samp{-DXBOARD} flag for use with @value{NAME}.  Use the
@example
    make gnuchessx
@end example
target in GNU Chess 4.0 to do this.

The Free Software Foundation would prefer to be able to distribute an
X chessboard program covered only by the GNU General Public License
and unencumbered by any other copyright.  If you can help with this,
please contact the FSF.

@itemize
@item The most common problem is, that people don't see the pieces, after
they have started @value{NAME} the first time. The reason is simple: Their
color settings in the MUI prefs don't fit @value{NAME}'s requirements.
To fix this problem you have two possibilities
@enumerate
@item Use the MUI prefs to fix appropriate colors for @value{NAME}; the
program uses MUI's @code{Shinepen}, @code{Shadowpen}, @code{Halfshinepen} and
@code{Halfshadowpen}. Be sure, that these are all different.
@item Enter pen settings in the prefs file of @value{NAME} (usually
@file{PROGDIR:lib/AmyBoard.prefs}) manually.
@end enumerate
@item Another common problem are strange crashes, especially in ICS mode.
This can happen, if your stack is too low: A value of 10000 should be
sufficient, but the CLI default value of 4096 definitely isn't. Note,
that Toolmanager uses the same value by default: You must increase it in
the @code{Exec object}, if you want to start @value{NAME} from
Toolmanager.
