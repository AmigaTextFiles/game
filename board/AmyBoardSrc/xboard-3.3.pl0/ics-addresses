Internet Chess Servers
----------------------

Internet Chess Servers (ICS's) can usually be found on several of the machines
listed below.  Within each group the most popular sites are listed first.  If
you connect to a site and find very few people logged in, type "help motd" and
"help addresses" there to see if more addresses are listed, and try one of
them, or another of those listed below.

The number immediately after each name is the "port number."  If you are
connecting to the server using xboard, 5000 is the default port number.  If
you need to specify a different port number, do so with the -icsport option to
xboard.  The number in parentheses is the numeric IP address, again followed
by the port number.  You can use the numeric IP address in place of the name
if your system has problems looking up the name.

chess.lm.com 5000            (192.231.221.16 5000)
  This site is now the Internet Chess Club.  The ICC is a pay service,
  but guests can still log in free to play unrated games and use most
  of the other features.

  These are Free Internet Chess Server sites.  The FICS does not
  currently have all the features of the ICC, but there is no charge for
  usage.

iris4.metiu.ucsb.edu 5000    (128.111.246.4 5000)   Santa Barbara, CA, USA
  These sites are currently running old versions of the Internet Chess
  Club code.  At this writing they still allow free access, but they
  do not accept new registrations.


Chess FTP Servers
-----------------

To use an FTP server, type the command "ftp XXX" (where XXX is one of
the machine names listed below), type "anonymous" as your login name,
and type your email address as the password.  For further help, read
the messages the FTP server prints, use the "help" command inside ftp,
or read the documentation for the ftp program on your system.

Chess World Wide Web pages
--------------------------

To use any of these, you need a World Wide Web browser.  Use the "Open
URL" or "Open Location" function on one of these names.  Most of them
have pointers to additional chess pages as well.
