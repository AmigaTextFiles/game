History:    'PIGbase4' developed Apr 1994 to Mar 1996 based on
            'Learn-Chess' developed 1991 to 1994.

            v2.7 is release ten 26/8-97, but the third on internet.

New/improved since v2.6 (release nine 19/4-96):
            - major improvements to chess-engine (maybe 500 elo better)
            - new feature: advanced search patterns to find positions.
            - new feature: chess clock, sort of.
            - now almost everything working/included in shareware version.
            - now move pieces with drag-and-drop.
            - faster Chessbase import
            - several minor improvements.

Corrected since v2.6:
            - several minor bugs removed.
