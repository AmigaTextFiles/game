<Disk/Printer icon: Disk>

Games are saved in a compressed format. It is possible to have up
to 1760 light-commented games on an ordinary disc (880K).

Only one game in each file.

The settings of Man/Computer, Strength, Board, field-power icons
and the move number is saved with the game.

To save a game, click the arrow pointing from the board to the Disk icon.
To load a game, click the arrow pointing from the Disk icon to the board.

       @{b}Reading of games from text files (@{"Ascii" Link "Ascii"}, @{"PGN" Link "PGN"}):@{ub}

<Disk/Printer icon: Printer>

Games can be read with comments from text files. The game can be in a
reasonable free format, if just  there are  are  both from and to coordinates
or the piece name letters are used (english if INTERNATIONAL=ON else your
local language).

                    !! @{b}OBSERVE@{ub} !!
    If you don't move to the start position before 'Text read' is selected,
    the position on the board can be used as a search-filter.

Evt. an alternative startposition can be read, ex:
..........
.  R   K .          ; Capitalized letter for a black piece.
.  R  PPP.          ; * immediate to the right of White, say, he is to move.
.        .          ; (if no *, then White to move)
.        .          ; R=Rook,   T=Tower (Rook with castling-right)
.        .          ; K=King,   M=Majesty (King with castling-right)
.        .          ; P=Pawn,   E=Enpassant-pawn
.    rppp.*         ; B=Bishop, N=kNight, Q=Queen
.    r k .          ; space=empty field
..........          ; .=frame around the 8x8 fields

;Mate in two moves
   1. Re2-e8    Rc8xe8  
   2. Re1xe8   

  All lines starting with a percentage sign (%) is ignored.
  All in punctuation marks () is read as a comment (can be on several lines).
  All in braces [] is read as a comment (can be on several lines).
  All to the right of a semicolon ; is read as a comment.
  Coordinates are read as moves.
  Short-form notation requires the piece-letters to be capitalized.
  All other chars are ignored.

    NOTE: In the @{"PGN" Link "PGN"} format must an alternative
          start-position be defined as a @{"FEN" Link "FEN"} tag.

Underpromotion is read as e8N or e8=N

The game is checked for errors when read, so a reading can be used to make
sure that a game  in a textfile is correctly typed.

If a textfile contains more than one game, every re-read from the same file
will read the next game. The games are expected to end with 1-0, 0-1 or 1/2.

   @{b}Writing of game to textfiles or printer:@{ub}

<Disk/Printer icon: Printer>

If writing is made to a textfile (other name than prt:), there will be placed
a ; (semicolon) before all comments (if LONGFORMWRITE=ON) or () (punctuation 
marks) around. That makes sure that the written game can be read again with
the comments intact. 

If the game has an alternative startposition, it will be written
(as a text-only position).

    NOTE: If written in the @{"PGN" Link "PGN"} format, an alternative
          start-position will be written as a @{"FEN" Link "FEN"} tag.

If you write to an existing textfile (OK when asked), the game will be append-
ed, while PIG (SK20) and Saved (SK10,SK11) format files will be overwritten.

If you make a comment to a position containing the text-string:
<dia>  there will be written a diagram in the textformat used with the
Chess-font. (see font/Font.Doc) @{" Try to see it " Link "ChessFontType1/Font.Doc/Main"}

PGN text format is used if @{"tool type" Link "ToolTypes"} LONGFORMWRITE=OFF.
If @{"tool type" Link "ToolTypes"} PGN=ON will PGN-@{"NAG" Link "NAG"}s be used (see @{"PGN" Link "PGN"} standard).

A long notation-form is used (one fullmove/line) if LONGFORMWRITE=ON

English piece letters are used when INTERNATIONAL=ON
National piece letters are used when INTERNATIONAL=OFF

  @{b}Automatic play-through (HIDDEN SPECIAL FUNCTION):@{ub}

By push-and-hold with the mouse on the 'Next/last move', and move the mouse
up above the icon before the button is released, an automatic play-through
starts. Higher gives faster (upto mid of the window). It stops by the end of
game, or by executing a new command.

  @{b}How to play against the computer@{ub}

1. Click the Board icon if you want to turn the board around

2. Click on the Man icon above the board icon if present to set the Computer
   to play that side. 

   NOTE: the man/computer eyes indicates whom to make next move, the mouth
         indicates the overall evaluation of the position.
         
3. If none of the three thinking-strength icon to the right of the Computer
   icon is active then activate the wanted one to start computer thinking.

4. To move see @{"Board:" Link "Walk"}

   NOTE: the mouth on a piece indicates the activity for that piece. 

   NOTE: the time used for each move is directly related to the complexity
         of the position. Many pieces attacked, checks possible and promotable
         pawns can extent the search from 1-3 upto 20-24 half-moves.

   NOTE: the 'chess-clock' was not intended as a user feature, but is a test
         feature I found too nice to disable. See history for description.

  F9                Convert a @{"PGN" Link "PGN"} text file to a PIG file.
                    If a ChessBase file (.CBF extension) is chosen:
                        Will try to convert it to PGN (in t:) by calling the

                        (in same directory as PIGbase or in c: should be ok).
                        The pgn file created by CBASCII is deleted when the
                        conversion to pig file is done. The temporary pgn file
                        needs about 5 times the ChessBase gamefile size of
                        free space on t: (normally the ram disk).
                        If the Site tag is '*', the Event and Site are swapped.

            amiga-guide format.

            Key to activate edit comment is now the Enter only (on the numeric
            keypad), not the return key anymore to get more consistency.
            FOURTH RELEASE!

8/12-95     Return key could still give edit-comment in some cases, now OK.

18/12-95    The first 20 (100 if @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} LOTMEMON=ON) pig games in the
            game-selection list will now be buffered to speed up game loading
            time (games from the end of a 8Mb pig file loads 3-6 times faster).

            Ghosting of arrows in game-selection list is now more correct.

            Icons will now be placed relative to each other (to use different-
            sized icons with the different piece-sets).

            The window height will be smaller than 256 if smaller icons used.

            New piece-sets 60x60-Std, 50x25-Xtra (REGISTERED version).

25/12-95    'small leftarrow' function is disabled 'cause it's unnessesary.

            Analyse will now read comment as a variation if present, else try
            to read comment for next move (because some places the variations
            AFTER the game-move).

            Save will now warn before overwriting existing files if not the
            fileformat is the same (SK10). Write will always warn. PIG append
            game still appends to any file (not good).

            Extended this manual: Walk-through and some changes.

            Board icon made smaller to make room for 5 new icons working as:
               F5,   F2,   F1, ScrL, NumL
            if room for more icons (@{"other sets" Link "OtherPieceSets"}), 5 more icons will appear:
               F8,  F10,   F9,   F4, xtra
            A600 owners could not reach the functions located on the numeric
            keyboard (ScrL, NumL) before this change.

2/1-96      (Now v2.3) Calc of icon-positions better (alternative piece-sets)

            More big icons in the piece-set 60x60-Std (disk/printer,,)

            Filerequester updates: faster scroll. Filesizes were listed in
            kilobytes, so files <1k listed as 0k, now all sizes <10000 is
            listed in bytes. Double-click selection of files now possible.

            Double-click load game in the game-selection list now possible.

            Text-editor (comment-editor) update: Now it's possible to place
            the cursor position directly with a mouse-click.
            A mouse-click just outside the text-area can scroll.
            SIXTH RELEASE!

12/1-96     Analyse functions modified: it will now place the variations moves
            AFTER the game-move. It's the normal way. The last played move
            is therefore automatically taken back on analyse ON, and replayed
            on analyse OFF. If no comment to read a variation from, the comment
            to position BEFORE the game-move is tried read.

15/1-96     Bug in 'arrow to A' function could cause guru when the resulting
            string-length was dividable with 4.

            New Opening-key generator: when entering white move nr 8 or when
            loading a game, the ECO and/or NIC key will be generated and
            inserted into the PGN infos if the fields are free (max two chars
            length). The ECO key can be A0-E9 (50 different). The NIC key can
            be: AL BI CK EO FR HD IG KF KG KI KP NI PU QG QI QO QP RE RG RL
            SD SI SO VG VO (25 different).

16/1-96     New gamefile ECO-KEYS.PIG containing about 2000 openings with
            their long name and their ECO key in the range A00 to E99.
            (ECO-KEYS.PIG is supplied in the REGISTERED version only).

            The game-selection list will recognize if a .pig file contains
            openings like ECO-KEYS.PIG (White=W & Black=B) and then display
            with long opening names. The Match Variation (in the filter editor)
            with value set to 0 will then copy the best fitting ECO key to
            current game (instead of the NIC key).

            Modified PGN import: now better nesting when [ { ( in PGN tags.

            Error corrected: Shareware version could not save or print at
            all. Now works again with games upto 60 moves.

            Position-search failed to find positions when used on a position
            in a game with a non-standard start-position, now OK.

            Now the positioning of windows is working better.

            Now the windows automatically deactivates after moving them.

            Now MouthOff will update on all the pieces when setup mode.

            A trouble printing (write text to prt) introduced in V 2.06 fixed.

            The window bar move infos when small piece-set used, is now
            adjusted to the smaller window size.

            If you write (text-format) to an existing file (OK when asked) and
            the file exists, PIG (SK20) and Saved (SK10,SK11) format files will
            be overwritten, while other will be appended to.

            If PIGbase was started from a directory with more than 192 files or
            more than 64 directories, it could break down, now ok.

20/2-96     Alternative start-positions is now possible to save in .pig file
            games.

            The match variation search also found games vith matching moves
            but SHORTER (incomplete matches), now OK

            Position search modified to work with alternative start-positions
            and is now 2-20% faster too.

            Now PGN export will use @{"NAG" Link "NAG"}s if nescessary (see @{"PGN" Link "PGN"} standard).
            (only the basic @{"NAG" Link "NAG"} 1-6 and 11-21 are converted)

            New theory tree window (PrtSc key), see @{"Theory" Link "Theory"}

3/3-96      Buffersize for game-selection list made bigger. Now 200, before 20
            (if @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} LOTMEMON=ON now 2000, before 50)
            Speeds up game and theory loading (F3). Will recognize a change of
            LOTMEMON next time a game-selection list is made.

10/3-96     F9 (convert pgn to pig) is extended to automatically try to convert
            Chessbase gamefiles to pgn calling CBASCII if a file with .CBF
            extension is chosen.

            pig to pgn (F10): Bug since v2.3 fixed. And now not dependent of

              N makes the NIC key (using required file ECO-KEYS.PIG)
              K makes both the ECO and the NIC key
            The keyfiles have to be in the same directory as PIGbase to work.

            The  = (equal) in Filter editor didn't work properly, now OK.

12/4-96     F9 didn't tell where in the PGN file conversion problems occured.
            Now it shows the line and position of the last found problem.

            F4 paused conversion when some problems occured. Now they are
            written to the logfile instead.

            F4 now supports automatic Chessbase CBF to PGN conversion too.
            (CBASCII conversion utility required)

            Now PGN import will convert @{"NAG" Link "NAG"}s if nescessary (see @{"PGN" Link "PGN"} standard).

            The text/PGN import/export improved to give a nicer look.

            New function: Tournament tables (the M key).

            Now clears ECO and NIC infos when new first-move (new game).
 
            Increased stability:
            - will now free all allocated memory at end (no more loosing 2.5k).
            - more stable on Blizzard A1220/1230 Accelerators (looks

            - more stable on 68030/40/60 processors

            RESUME 2.6-2.7:

            - several minor bugs removed.
            - improvements to several features.
            - major improvements to chess-engine (maybe 500 elo better)
            - new feature: advanced search patterns to find positions.
            - new feature: chess clock, sort of.
            - more included in shareware version.

       ---------------------------

            Tournament tables:
            -  now sorted on score.
            - 'Count of games' were in reality a 'Count of opponents'
               causing game doublets hard to find, now OK.

            New game: didn't clear the old game if in start-position, now OK.

            @{"Search Patterns" Link "SearchPatterns"} can be entered in the filter field just above
            the 'search position' icon (upto 30 chars).
           
            Now move pieces with drag-and-drop.
  
            Help: Filter, now includes help to all the icons/fields.
                  Game-list, now Help key gives a helptext.

            The icon to open theory-window (key: PrtSc) has swapped position
            with the icon to see pgn-infos (key: NumL). This makes the theory
            icon available at standard setup while the pgn-infos icon is
            available only in conjunction with @{"other piece sets" Link "OtherPieceSets"}.
            The icon is now looking like a game-tree (empty before).

            The loading of @{"other piece sets" Link "OtherPieceSets"} were disabled in the shareware
            version of v2.6 (now re-enabled).

            (Now v2.7b1)

            The PGN import now accepts CR as end-of-line marker to support the
            text-file format used on the Macintosh (LF or CR+LF still ok).

            (Now v2.7b2)

            Fieldpower now more correct calculated using the piece values too.
            Before would two rooks control a field even when a opponent pawn
            had the control.

            (Now v2.7b3 24/2-97)

            Chess Engine improvements:
            Playing strength improved (to about 1100-1300 elo?), now mates and
            material respected, but more time used, in some positions too much.

            save single game minor errors (NOT gamefiles):
            - small error when save with alternative start position, fixed. Old
              files with the error will now be loaded correctly.
            - when save an alternative position without moves, the load would
              notice an error (but still load the position if a second load was
              tried). Now loads OK.

            Stalemate were always seen as mate. Now correct.

            (Now v2.7b4 26/4-97)

            Chess Engine improvements:
            - 3* same position detection. NOTE: not 100% correct detected yet.
            - Chess-engine now 1300-1500 elo on 28Mhz A1200?

            Chess clock, the format: 0:07     0:05     0:03     0:01
                                     White    Black    Last     Since
                                     total    total    move   last move

            It's not a normal chess-clock. The time used for each move is
            kept and the totals is just the sums for all the previous moves.
            The engine always stores the actual used time while a player stores
            the 'since last move' time. A player can undo a move and thereby undo
            the stored time for it too.

            Time used on 28Mhz A1200 for the tree levels (minutes for 60 moves):
                 3) 60-240
                 2) 15-30
                 1)  1-2

            (now v2.7b6 6/7-97)

            Chess Engine improvements:

            Simple pawn end-game understanding.
            En-passant moves and promote to knight were overlooked by the
            search engine, now OK.
            Positional values differentiated between White and Black to detect
            King positions quality.
            Now faster, but still a bit slow when queen endgames.
            Now the strength should be between VChess3.1 and gnuChess4.0p58.

              NOTE: some Chess Engine stuff to include in future versions:
                - Time-management (needed to play under tournament conditions)
                - Mating knowledge
                - Hash-tables
                - Use opponents time
                - 50-move rule
                - 100% detection of draw on 3 times the same position
                - more levels

            Chessbase import (F4,F9): now creates the temporary pgn file in t:
            to allow import directly from a CD and to speed-up the conversion.

            The multi-file import (F4) now has a limit of 512 files (were 256)

            The filter: (White/Black Elo/USCF) now selects all with a rating
            equal to and above the entered value (before equal to only).

            Just about all shareware restrictions removed or softened
26/8-97     (Now v2.7) RELEASE TEN!

             known minor bugs:
                - theory-window + analyse functions CAN give unstability.

  Wants to to get an overview of a pig-file:

     Use for example the letter f as White and Black name (in the filter),
     and you gets around one out of five games in a PIG file selected.


  Wants to find the NIC-key (opening cathegory) to a game:

     a. press N key (REGISTERED version only).
        (be sure to have a file named NIC-KEYS.PIG in same dir as PIGbase)

     b. use a PIG file with varied games (and NIC keys).
        Use Match Variation (in the filter editor) with value set to 0, and
        the NIC key field from the best matching game will be copied to the
        current game.


  Wants to make the ECO-key (opening cathegory) to a game:

     a. press E key (REGISTERED version only).
        (be sure to have a file named ECO-KEYS.PIG in same dir as PIGbase)

     b. use a PIG file with varied games (and ECO keys).
        Use Match Variation (in the filter editor) with value set to 0, and
        the ECO key field from the best matching game will be copied to the
        current game.

  Wants to find the best matching games:

     Use Match Variation (in the filter) with value set to 0, and to the left
     in the game-selection list you see how many halfmoves that match your
     game. Observe that The NIC key (ECO if ECO-KEYS.PIG) field from the best
     matching game will be  automatically copied to your game if possible.

     
  Wants to free the space used by deleted games:

     Make a new cleaned up PIG file using F8 'append PIG to PIG' to a new
     filename.


  Wants to search for a position:

     2 to 10 times as fast if you give at least the two first chars of
     the NICkey too.
     See the count of scanned/total positions in the topline of the
     game-selection list when finished.

  Wants to split a pigfile in two:

     Use the Append from the filter editor. Set a small value in the 'With Info' 
     field (50), if you are extracting a big pig file (more than about 10,000
     games). If you have more than 1 Mb ram you can set the icons @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} 
     LOTMEMON=ON before start of the program.

  Wants to play-through a variation shown in a game as a comment.

     1a. Move to the position where the comment is shown
         (if the variation is stored after the game-move, the NORMAL way).
     1b. Move to the position AFTER the comment is shown.
         (if the variation is stored before the game-move, an UNUSUAL way).
     2.  Select the 'laying Y' icon to start an analyse.
         (PIGbase tries to read the comment as a game)
     3.  If successful (all arrows enabled), play-through the game.
     4.  Select the 'laying Y' icon to stop the analyse.

  Wants to enter a comment with an alternative variation to a positions
  last move:

     1.  Move to the position where the comment is wanted
         (AFTER the gamemove).
     2.  Select the 'laying Y' icon to start an analyse.
         (the 'A' icon changes to 'arrow to A')
         (the last played move is taken back)
     3.  Play the variation on the board.
         (comments not allowed while in analyse mode)
     4.  click the 'arrow to A' icon.
         (store the analyse as a comment to the game-position).

  Wants to know how to handle .PIG gamefiles:

     - Always keep all the small .PIG gamefiles as the 'master' files. Backup.
     - Use the ConcatPIG utility program to concat all the small .PIG files to
       one big PIGBASE.PIG gamefile, containing a copy of them all.
     - Now you can easily search in ALL the games using the big PIG file.

     Own gamefiles: Two Backups!
     - On workbench find and open the drawer with your file
     - select the workbench menu 'Windows/show/all files'
     - Move the icon to another disk to make a copy of the file.
       (store the disk with the PIG file as a backup)
     - Export your PIG gamefile to PGN text format using F10 in PIGbase.
       (store PGN textfile as a backup, it's readable in other programs.)

  Wants to prepare the opening play against a well-known player:

     - collect all games of the player with the colour he will have into
       one (new) pig file (using append in the filter).
     - Activate Theory-tree window (PrtSc key or theory-tree icon)
     - Make tree: F3 key, select pig file, select all (wanted) games, select OK
     - Use statistic mode to see his score in different variations.
     - Use min/max mode to 'play' against his most successfull moves (the top
       move in the list).

  Wants to import ChessBase gamefiles:

     - get an Amiga version of CBASCII (made by Andy Duplain)
       An Amiga version (by Ortwin Paetzold) is found on Aminet and
       on ftp.pitt.edu named cbasc-am.lha
     - place CBASCII in the c: directory
     - Be sure to have the chessbase file on a disk with about 5 times the
       filesize of free space (for temporary file).
     - press F9 in PIGbase and select a chessbase file ending with .CBF
       If enough free disk space to the temporary pgn file, you should end
       up with a pig file.

  Wants to export games to other chessdatabases:

     - be shure the tooltype INTERNATIONAL=ON
     - use F10, select pig file, OK, ALL1, OK, call the output <name>.PGN
     - using CrossDos save to a 720K IBM formatted disk (about 1000 games max).
     - conversion from PGN to other formats: find and use a conversion utility
       program: pgn2nic,pgn2cb,cbascii,,,

          NOTE: the cbascii can't convert games with 2-letter ECO keys, so
                either create longer ECO keys to all games, remove them or
                replace all instances of [ECO with [EC using a text-editor.
                
  Wants to check that a tournament is complete and correct:

     - use the M key to start making a tournament table (out of played games)
     - choose a pig gamefile
     - select the games using the filter and the game selection list
     - check the generated table (same player with different names?, equal
       count of games played?)

         for illegal chars in the PGN syntax (paranthesis/brackets/braces,,).
         Use an editor and correct the problem. Alternatively save the PGN
         file in smaller parts and read/convert them separately.


   - Wants lower memory use, do one or more of the following:

         1. Set the @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} WORKBENCH=ON in the icon info.
            The program will start on the Workbench screen.
         2a.Remove the req.library from libs: (or better rename it to disable)
         2b.Set the @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} REQFILEREQUESTER=ON in the icon info.
            Req.library's file-requester will be used (to allow 3.)
         3. Set the Stack to a lower value (down to 16k if REQFILEREQUESTER=ON)
            or down to 34500 if REQFILEREQUESTER=OFF).
         4. Set the @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} SIMPLEREFRESH=ON. 
            Window-refresh will be slower.
         6. Do not use alternative piece-sets (no "ilbm" directory)
         7. Do not use the LOCALE file or disable texts in the LOCALE file
            you don't need translated by inserting colons with a texteditor.

   - Wants to transfer a game to a PC (WB2.1+ only):
         
         1. Activate the DosDriver PC0 by moving it from Storage/DosDrivers
            to Devs/DosDrivers, double-click the icon or reset.
         2. If you don't have an IBM-formatted DD (720K) disc then: 
               - Insert an empty disc and select the Disc icon PC0:????.
               - Format the disc
         3. Save (and load) in clean text <Disk/printer icon: Printer>.
         4. On the PC, load as Windows @{"Ascii" Link "Ascii"} (there are no CarriageReturns
            after the LineFeeds in the text).

   - Wants to save or load a game in clean text:

         1. Set the Disk/Printer Icon to Printer.
         2. Click on one of the arrows between board and Printer icon
         3. Save: Change 'prt:' to the wanted filename.

   - Wants to search for a position:

         1. Place the wanted position on the board.
         2. Toggle the 'position' icon in the filter editor.

   - Unstable:

         1. Check StackSize in the icon info (at least 34500, or try 46000).
         2. Is req.library v2.5 or newer?
         3. Try to use the Req Filerequester (REQFILEREQUESTER=ON).

     NOTE: Some A1200s will fail or be unstable when both AT-bus harddisk and
           memory expansion are present. I suspect that this problem has caused
           a lot of problems and disappointments. I know of people who gave up
           the Amiga because of it. THE SOLUTION (maybe):

               WARNING: It's easy to lose data on the harddisk using
                        HDtoolbox or RDprep. Take backup first! Consult an
                        expert! Do it at your own risk!

           Change the harddisk partition DMA MASK from 0x7ffffffc to 0xfffffff0
           in all partitions and maybe the Maxtransfer value down to 0xf0000.
           

   - Sleeping pointer when talking:
 
         1. Is the 'Speaker' program in same directory.
         2. Is the @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} NOSPEAKTASK=ON (should be OFF)

   - German error-message (uberlauf-fehler) or other serious problems:

         1. Note the failing function/conditions
         2. Note the versions (in the @{"Help" Link "Help"} first time used)
         3. Note the System (computer, workbench, screenmode, ram,,,,)
         4. Mail it to: E.B.Madsen Kastebjergvej 23, 2750 Ballerup, Denmark

   - Can't see the anything (all colours in the palette set to the same)

         1a. Delete the Palette-file "PIGpaletteBP2" and restart.
         1b. Or delete all the Palette-files "PIGpaletteBP1" to 8

   - Mouths on pieces misplaced

         1a. Don't use alternative piece-sets (no "ilbm" directory or no 
             pieces in it)
         1b. Use another piece-set (in the "ilbm" directory)
         1c. Redesign the piece-set (see @{"8.4.2" Link "OtherPieceSets"})
         1d. Disable the mouths: Set the @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} MOUTHOFF=ON

   - UPS! instead of OOPS!

         1. Copy the english version of the brushes 103 and 104 to the "ilbm"
            directory. Other languages: edit the brushes in a paint program.

   - Wants to create a new (pig) file, not append to an existing

         The append will automatically create a new pig file if given a non-
         existing filename. Just enter a new name in the filerequester.

        @{b}WHAT IS DISABLED IN THE SHAREWARE VERSION (not much really)@{ub}
        -------------------------------------------------------------

   You can play and make games of maximum 60 full-moves (80 from v2.7), but
   still load and replay longer games.

   The computer player can not play on the strongest level.
   (restriction removed from v2.7)

   In setup mode will the movement of pieces work okay, but the demo message
   will be shown every time a king is moved (from v2.7 almost never).

   Can not save or print single games longer than 60 full-moves (80 from v2.7),
   but still save all games to PIG files.

   Demomessage when loading games longer than 60 moves
   (restriction removed from v2.7).

   Every 20'th in the game selection list will be hidden, but can still be
   loaded (from v2.7 it's just every 80'th starting with no 82).

   Save function in the theory window is disabled.
   (can save from v2.7, but limited to maximum 10000 nodes/file. And the first
   letter in the filename is replaced by an underline).

   The one-key creation of ECO and NIC keys are disabled, but still possible.
   (enabled in v2.7).

   
      EXTRAS SUPPLIED WITH THE REGISTERED VERSION:
      --------------------------------------------

                                       @{"Order the Registered version" Link "OrderForm"}

   10.000 games (not just 800).
   From v2.7: included in shareware version too.

   A quality ChessPieces Adobe Type 1 font. @{" Try to see Font.Doc " Link "ChessFontType1/Font.Doc/Main"}
   From v2.7: included in shareware version too.

   Extra piece-sets (without mouths, so set @{"Tooltype" Link "Settings"} MOUTHOFF=ON):
   From v2.7: some included in shareware version too.

                                                          Try see ilbm.doc in:

   The laced sets is best with a flicker-fixer (scandoubler) or with a screen-
   promotion utility like Andreas Linnemanns "NewMode" to use the dblpal or the
   dblntsc screenmode.

   A new more intelligent filtering algorithm is used in the registered
   version of PIGbase, so a simple search is therefore about double as fast.
   From v2.7: included in shareware version too.

   A 68020-minimum version.


      BONUS (no copyrights, maybe available on Internet):
      ------
   A PD opening-theory book containing 15696 moves in 842 variations, modified
   to a PIGbase readable format (see note in @{"chapter 6" Link "TechData"}). Used if present
   (OPENINGS.TXT) by the computer-player (but not on the lowest strength).
   From v2.7: included in shareware version too.

   The ECO-KEYS.PIG opening key file with ECO-keys and the long names to the
   openings. Total of 2000 openings to the 500 ECO-keys in the range A00-E99.
   From v2.7: included in shareware version too.

   The NIC-KEYS.PIG opening key file with NIC-keys and the long names to the
   openings. Have more and longer keys than the ECO-keyfile.
   From v2.7: included in shareware version too.

@Node "FEN"
 FEN is "Forsyth-Edwards Notation"; it is a standard for describing
 chess positions using the ASCII character set.


 Example:

 rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/1NBQKBNR w Kkq h6 0 1


 .. and placed in a @{"PGN" Link "PGN"} tag:

 [FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/1NBQKBNR w Kkq h6 0 1"]
 
Data fields:
-------------
  FEN specifies the piece placement, the active colour, the castling availability,
  the en passant target square, the halfmove clock, and the fullmove number.
  These can all fit on a single text line in an easily read format.  The length
  of a FEN position description varies somewhat according to the position. In
  some cases, the description could be eighty or more characters in length and so
  may not fit conveniently on some displays.  However, these positions aren't too
  common.
  
  A FEN description has six fields.  Each field is composed only of non-blank
  printing ASCII characters.  Adjacent fields are separated by a single ASCII
  space character.
  
  
  Piece placement data
  
  The first field represents the placement of the pieces on the board.  The board
  contents are specified starting with the eighth rank and ending with the first
  rank.  For each rank, the squares are specified from file a to file h.  White
  pieces are identified by uppercase SAN piece letters ("PNBRQK") and black
  pieces are identified by lowercase SAN piece letters ("pnbrqk").  Empty squares
  are represented by the digits one through eight; the digit used represents the
  count of contiguous empty squares.  A solidus character "/" is used to separate
  data of adjacent ranks.
  
  
  Active colour
  
  The second field represents the active colour.  A lower case "w" is used if
  White is to move; a lower case "b" is used if Black is the active player.
  
  
  Castling availability
  
  The third field represents castling availability.  This indicates potential
  future castling that may not be possible at the moment due to blocking pieces
  or enemy attacks.  If there is no castling availability for either side, the
  single character symbol "-" is used.  Otherwise, a combination of from one to
  four characters are present.  If White has kingside castling availability, the
  uppercase letter "K" appears.  If White has queenside castling availability,
  the uppercase letter "Q" appears.  If Black has kingside castling availability,
  the lowercase letter "k" appears.  If Black has queenside castling
  availability, then the lowercase letter "q" appears.  Those letters which
  appear will be ordered first uppercase before lowercase and second kingside
  before queenside.  There is no whitespace between the letters.
  
  
  En passant target square
  
  The fourth field is the en passant target square.  If there is no en passant
  target square then the single character symbol "-" appears.  If there is an en
  passant target square then is represented by a lowercase file character
  immediately followed by a rank digit.  Obviously, the rank digit will be "3"
  following a white pawn double advance (Black is the active colour) or else be
  the digit "6" after a black pawn double advance (White being the active colour).
  
  
  Halfmove clock
  
  The fifth field is a nonnegative integer representing the halfmove clock.  This
  number is the count of halfmoves (or ply) since the last pawn advance or
  capturing move.  This value is used for the fifty move draw rule.
  
  
  Fullmove number
  
  The sixth and last field is a positive integer that gives the fullmove number.
  This will have the value "1" for the first move of a game for both White and
  Black.  It increments by one immediately after each move by Black.

    Supplemental tag names:

WhiteTitle, BlackTitle: String values such as "FM", "IM", and "GM";
WhiteElo, BlackElo: Integer values; these are used for FIDE Elo ratings.
WhiteUSCF, BlackUSCF: 
EventDate: the starting date of the Event
EventSponsor:
Section: this is used for the playing section of a tournament 
     (e.g.,"Open" or "Reserve").
Stage: A string; this is used for the stage of a multistage event
     (e.g.,"Preliminary" or "Semifinal").
Board: An integer; this identifies the board number in a team event.
Opening: A string; this is used for the traditional opening name.
Variation: this is used to further refine the Opening tag.
SubVariation: this is used to further refine the Variation tag. 
ECO: String of the form "XDD/DD" where the "X" is a letter from "A" to "E" and
     the "D" positions are digits; this is used for an opening designation from the
     five volume _Encyclopedia of Chess Openings_.
NIC: A string; this is used for an opening designation from the _New in Chess_
     database.
Annotator: A name or names in the format of the player name tags; this
     identifies the annotator of the game.
Time: A time-of-day value in the form "HH:MM:SS"; similar to the Date tag
     except that it denotes the local clock time (hours, minutes, and seconds) of
     the start of the game.  Note that colons, not periods, are used for internal
     separators for the Time value.
FEN: alternative start-position in the @{"FEN" Link "FEN"} format.

It's represented as a $ followed by a number.

   NOTE: NAGs $1 to $6 and $11 to $21 are supported by PGN export in PIGbase.

@Node "Ascii"

  Ascii is a clean text-only format, but special chars differs:

  7-bit Ascii            Used by Unix,,, no national chars, 96 chars total
  8-bit Ascii IBM DOS    Used by PCs, good for textmode only programs
  8-bit Ascii ISO        Used by Amiga and Windows
  8-bit Ascii (MAC)      Used by Macintosh

  The 8-bit Ascii is just the 7-bit Ascii extended with 96 or more chars,
  and the differences is therefore in special-chars only.

        Theory tree
     ------------------

  Theory window (PrtSc key or theory-tree icon) makes trees out of games with
  statistical or min/max information to known positions:

    Draw values:   The value in% of a draw for White and Black.
                   Will affect the min/max'ing.
                   To edit: press and keep left mouse-button down while you
                   edit the value and press return. Then release mouse-button.

                   WARNING: the values can look changed but be without effect
                            if the above (weird) method isn't used to edit.

                   If you're white and have to win the game, and black will
                   win the tournament after a draw, you should set draw values
                   to W=1, B=99 indicating that a draw is almost nothing worth
                   to you (1%) and almost as good as a win to black (99%). Then
                   the min/max sorting will be organized after that white wants
                   unclear more than drawish positions and black the opposite.

                   If you have an expected score of 0.7 you could enter the
                   opponents draw value as 0.7 and your own as 0.3

                   NOTE: These values are best used with a theory made with
                         correct evaluation values to the games used (manually
                         entered).
                         Theory made on games results (F3 import) is best used
                         with Statistic view, where the draw values are of
                         minor importance (but are still used to decide the
                         movelist sort order)

    Statistic:     If OFF (not toggled) then min/max information. min/max means
                   the position-value if the best moves are made from both
                   sides. The +- value for example, is expressed as 39/36/24
                   meaning percentage propability for White win/Draw/Black win.

    How to import gamefiles from other formats
   -------------------------------------------

PIGbase4 can import gamefiles in the @{"PGN" Link "PGN"} text format.

How to get PGN files:
---------------------

A) From NICBASE3 gamefiles:

   1. Start your NICBASE3 program (IBM-PC DOS program).
      NICBASE3 works with the IBM emulator PC-Task v2.0 and v 3.1, but NOT v3.0.
   2. Load the gamefile.
   3. Make a printfile using FIDE-SHORT format and use the international
      piece-letters (NBRQK) or the danish (SLTDK). NICBASE3 can max print
      750 games, but just select again and reprint to the same printfile
      several times to get them all in one big file. or use different names
      to get several files which fits 720k formatted disks. To get more on each
      disk you can compress files about 3x using a packer. Offcourse you have
      to have an unpacker for the used format (zip, arj, lha,,) on the Amiga.
   4. Get the file into your Amiga using CROSS-DOS (PCtask: use CopyToA)
   5. Use the NICtoPGN utility to convert to PGN file(s).
      Works with the IBM emulator PCtask v3.0 and v3.1.

B) From ChessBase gamefiles:

   1. Use the CBASCII (IBM-PC DOS public domaine program).
      It can be found on internet ftp.pitt.edu group/chess/UTIL/cba15a.zip

          NOTE: .zip packed files can be unpacked with PKUNZIP on PCs, and with
                UnZIP (v5.12) on the Amiga.
                .arj packed files can be unpacked with UNARJ on PCs, and with
                UnARJ (v2.41) on the Amiga.
                .lha packed files can be unpacked with LHA on PCs, and possibly
                LHA and other packers on the Amiga.

   2. Get the file into your Amiga using CROSS-DOS (PCtask: use CopyToA)

          NOTE: An Amiga version of CBASCII is available on Aminet too.

   
C) From Internet:
   
   PGN files:           ftp.pitt.edu group/chess/PGN.       or
                        chess.onenet.net/pub/chess/Game-Databases/PGN.
   NICBASE gamefiles:   ftp.pitt.edu group/chess/NICB.      or
                        chess.onenet.net/pub/chess/Game-Databases/NicBase.
   CHESSBASE gamefiles: ftp.pitt.edu group/chess/CB.        or
                        chess.onenet.net/pub/chess/Game-Databases/ChessBase.

   It's zip'ed, you have to unpack it (on IBM-PC DOS use PKUNZIP, or
   you can do it on the Amiga using unzip,zip or PKAzip).

   Many interesting chess problem sets represented with @{"FEN" Link "FEN"} can be found at the
   chess.uoknor.edu ftp site in the directory pub/chess/SAN_testsuites.


How to make PIG files out of the PGN files.
-------------------------------------------

   1. Start PIGbase4 and press F9 to convert one PGN file (call it <name>.pig)
      or press F4 to convert all .PGN files in the selected directory.

   2. Use the ConcatPIG utility to quickly concat several PIG files to a new
      or to an existing PIG file (better to have fewer, bigger files).


How to make PIG files directly out of ChessBase .CBF (and .CBI) files.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. Get the files (unpacked, .arj or .zip) into your Amiga.

   2. Unpack if nescessary with UnZIP (v5.12) or UnARJ (v2.41).
      (found on aminnet).

   3. Get the Amiga version of CBASCII (see note in chapter 4 keys, F9)

   4. Convert single gamefiles with F9 or all in a directory with F4.

@Node "DefinePieceSets"
    How to define new piece-sets
   ------------------------------

  Different piece-set is loaded if a "ilbm" directory exists with the
  alternative IFF-ILBM brush pieces (and icons) stored as files named:

     001      (white square)
     002      (black square)
     010-027  (white squared mMkKqQtTrRbBnNeEpP, see @{"3.2" Link "ReadAsciiOrPgn"})
     028      piece menu used on the setup screen  (97x230, other sizes too)
     110-127  (black squared mMkKqQtTrRbBnNeEpP)
     (even=white pieces, odd=BLACK PIECES.)

  All the pieces must be the same size as 001.

  The white square (001) forces PIGbase to open a 1,2,4,8 or 16 colour screen
  depending on the colour-count in the saved brush.

  Pieces higher than 31 pixels forces PIGbase to open an interlaced screen.

@Node "SearchPatterns"
                Search Patterns String
                ----------------------

  Use:   complex search for position types

  How:   Enter a search pattern string in the Filter.

  Syntax: .OPTIONS COUNTS QUALIFIERS

The OPTIONS part is not nessesary. To use, set a punctuation sign '.' as the
first char in the search string followed by one or more of these options:

    W   only positions where it's White's turn
    B   only positions where it's Black's turn
    R   the Reverse postions too (up/down)
    M   the Mirror positions too (left/right)
    N   Ignore the count for pieces not defined in the COUNTS part

        NOTE: Counts are default set to 0 which is best for
              endgame search while the N option makes it easy
              to enter midgame search patterns.

The COUNTS part (separated by spaces) is not nessesary. Tells how many of
each piece the searched positions must have. Examples:

   2q           two white queens
   0Q           no BLACK queen
   1qQ          one white and one BLACK queen
   1q 1Q        one white and one BLACK queen
   2rRbB        two rooks and bishops each 
   #q           free count of white queens
   4-6P         four to six BLACK pawns

       NOTE: - The pieces (COUNTS and QUALIFIERS) are LOCALIZED, unless
               INTERNATIONAL=ON (examples shown as english/INTERNATIONAL).
             - The Options (WBRMN) are not LOCALIZED.
             - BLACK pieces if capitalized else white pieces.

The QUALIFIERS part (separated by spaces) is not nessesary. Tell where the
pieces must be placed in the searched positions. Examples:

   Pc7          a BLACK pawn on C7
   pa           a white pawn on the a-file
   r7           a white pawn on the 7'th row
   Rh5-7        a BLACK rook on h5,h6 or h7
   ba-d3        a white bishop on a3,b3,c3 or d3
   ka-c6-7      a white king on a6,a7,b6,b7,c6 or c7 (restriction: max 9)


Examples of complete search pattern strings:

1qR                Endgames where white has queen against rook

1q 1p 1Q pa        Queen endgames with a white pawn on the a-file
   or
1qpQ pa          
          
1bN #pP            White has bishop against knight and free count of pawns
                   on each side (0-8).

.NB bh7 Kg8        Games where white offers a bishop on h7 (and some more)
                   The B option used only to speed up the search a bit (it's
                   faster because half as many positions are compared).

.RM 1rR            Games where one has rook + c or f pawn against rook alone
     
.NR Bg2 Bb2        Games with double-fianchetto 

.NR 3n             Games with promotion to knight (some of them)

.NW ka8 Qa-b7-8    Games where white possibly got mated on a8 by BLACK queen
                   on a7,b7 or b8. The W option used only to speed up the
                   search a bit. Games where white can capture the black
                   queen will be included too.

.NR 7pP pa pb pd pe pf pg ph Pa Pb Pc Pd Pf Pg Ph  (SEE NOTE!)
                   Games with a pawn position allowing minority attack.
                   The 7pP used only to speed up the search a bit.

                   NOTE: because of a limit to string length (30 chars) in
                         the filter, this last example isn't yet possible.

                   NOTE: Speed up the search a bit for endgames: Combine with
                         the 'moves' in filter to skip searching through games
                         shorter than eg. 40 moves.
                         Use Reverse (and Mirror) options to get more matching
                         games in the same search time.
