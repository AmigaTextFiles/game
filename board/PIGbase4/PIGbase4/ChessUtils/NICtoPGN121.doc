INFO:

This is a utility to convert CHESS games from the PC chess database 
NICBASE3 .PRN files to the standard chess-game text fileformat, PGN.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
USE:

First make a printfile from NICBASE3 of the wanted games. Be
shure to select FIDE-SHORT format, and use the international
piece-letters (NBRQK) or the danish (SLTDK).

Then use this ShareWare utility.

-----------------------------------------
ABOUT THE PGN FORMAT:

there is seven standard tags: Event,Site,Date,Round,White,Black,Result

  pgn example :

[Event "FIDE World Championship"]     or    [Event "?"]
[Site "New York City, NY USA"]    
[Date "1992.08.31"]                   or    [Date "1992.??.??"]
[Round "4.1.2"]                       or    [Round "22"]
[White "Tal, Mikhail N."]             or
[Black "Lasker, Emmanuel"]          
[Result "*"]                          or    [Result "1/2-1/2"]

     (e.g.,"Preliminary" or "Semifinal").

SubVariation: this is used to further refine the Variation tag. 
ECO: String of the form "XDD/DD" where the "X" is a letter from "A" to "E" and
     the "D" positions are digits; this is used for an opening designation from the
     five volume _Encyclopedia of Chess Openings_.
NIC: A string; this is used for an opening designation from the _New in Chess_
     database.
Annotator: A name or names in the format of the player name tags; this
     identifies the annotator of the game.

     except that it denotes the local clock time (hours, minutes, and seconds) of
     the start of the game.  Note that colons, not periods, are used for internal
     separators for the Time value.
