Chess-font
----------

USE:

  Scalable font with Chess-pieces. Can be used with word-processors to
  create and print-out chess positions (diagrams).

  The Pig-Base chess-database can generate ascii text files with automatic
  generation of diagrams:
  
    -  Make a comment to the wanted position containing the text-string:
       <dia> to generate the diagram. Print the game to a file.

    -  Import the ascii text into your word-processor wich
       has to support the Adobe Type 1 font format (.PFB) or
       the TrueType format (.TTF) in MAC or PC version.

    -  Mark the block with the position in ascii

    -  Select the Chess font


NAMING:

  Uses the danish piece letters (bsltdk f), capitalized if black.

  If the piece is on a black field, the letter above on the keyboard
  is used (exeption: t has no letter above and uses y instead).

  Some of the pieces can be too complex and may fail.

  The font can be used on PC's to make chess magazines.
