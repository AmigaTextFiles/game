; LOCALE-FILE FOR THE PIGbase4 v2.5 LEARN-CHESS PROGRAM
;
; (c) 1991-96 E.B.Madsen, Kastebjergvej 23, 2750 Ballerup, DK Denmark
;
;
;      HOW TO USE THE LOCALE-FILE (your own language):
;
; Make a copy of this file and name it LOCALE, place it in the same
; directory  as the LEARN-CHESS program, to activate loading.
;
; Remove the colon (:) from the lines you want to activate
; 
; If you don't have the file in a version translated to your own language,
; you can do this yourself with an editor. (in 1996 can new translations
; mailed to me on a disc, be granted a free full-version of the newest
; PIGbase4 to the translator, but contact me first to avoid translating a
; language already done).
;
; Danish LOCALE          : E.B.Madsen
; English LOCALE         : E.B.Madsen (better translation wanted)
; German LOCALE          : Ortwin Paetzold (still working)
;
;      LOCALE-FILE FORMAT:
;
;      Plain ASCII text, but observe the following points:
;
;   1. Lines starting with semi-colon (;) is comments and is ignored.
;   2. Lines starting with colon (:) is counted, but is not loaded
;      (No reason to load lines equal to the the internal texts when English)
;   3. Empty lines is ignored.
;   4. The backslash (\) will be converted to newlines.
;   5. The texts is loaded using positional correspondance, so don't
;      insert or delete non-comment lines.
;   6. The lines can be upto 2048 chars long, so edit with an editor
;      there is capable of that line-length (CygnusEditor and many other).
;   7. Some lines is texts written Phonetic (ARPHABET) for the Amiga's 
;      Narrator-device (all the talking). Use legal NARRATOR syntax only
;      in those lines.
;   8. There is no check for maxlength on the individual lines, so don't
;      make them too much longer, unless you will risk problems. 
;   9. Don't forget that spaces in the line-ends is chars too.
