 Welcome to CW Vehicle Design.

 This is the Beta and probably only release for this program,
I have a sick wife and I am working many hours, not to mention
trying to learn the Mac and Clonez and I also need to go back to
school (mostly for english ;). 

 This is just a front end for designing cars for the Steve Jackson
game Carwars in a hopefully quick and easy format. If you dont play
Carwars then you will not need this utility, allthough the game is
cool. 

 For the carwars players: I used the basic version of the vehicle
design straight from the manual (I hope I didnt infringe on any 
copyrights) so if you are using any additional addons this will at
least give a good concept at what you can do with different car 
configurations as a base unit. Also I havnt put in the weapons so
you will have to make a judgement call on how many spaces and weight
you will need left over but you can still config a vehicle in a matter
of seconds.

 To get this to run you will need the translator.library for some
reason, I tried it on my 500 that I just installed a bare bones 
WB2.1 and it asked for that library. Requires OS2.x and above. 
Allthough I havnt tested it on WB1.3.

 I think thats about it. But if you find that my calulations are 
not correct go ahead and send me some mail (send me mail anyway so
I know if anyone uses this ;)



Known bugs:

 :Theres a little logic bug in the armor types, try to find it ;).   
 :No weapons or turrets.
 :I forgot to take out my debug stuff, so just move the console 
  window to the back. 



Thanks to:

 Danny Wong: For Visual Arts, I used his program to design the GUI.
PS I know its ugly I was just playing around with Visual Arts :)

Steve Jackson: For Carwars and Illuminati (I'll have to play them 
again when my computer dies).

Escom: For hopefully making new Amigas and making it a dominate 
force in the computing world (I can dream cant I?).
