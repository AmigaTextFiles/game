        Requirements:   an Amiga/emulator (this should be obvious)
                        this program      (this should be obvious, too)

The game:

On the main screen you are confronted with four options: PLAY, OPTS, EDIT
and QUIT.

PLAY:   After clicking this gadget, guess what, the game will start. You can
        see a menu where you can select "THROW DICE", "MOVE MAN", "GET
        HELP", "RESTART GAME" or "EXIT".

        THROW DICE:     If it's the computer's turn, he will start to throw
                        his dice and immediately move one of his men.
                        Otherwise it's your task to throw the dice. But this
                        is a tricky thing to do: You can see a pointer in
                        the very middle of the board pointing downward. As
                        soon as you click with the mouse it will start
                        rotating clockwise. You now should click a second
                        time before the pointer comes to rest again. The
                        pointer's distance from his origin denotes the force
                        it is thrown by. As soon as the dice stops you may
                        move one of your men provided that this is possible.
                        If it is not and none of your men would be movable
                        with a 1,2,3,4 or a 5 you may roll the dice up to
                        three times.

        MOVE MAN:       When you click this button, you may select one of
                        your men to move. You will only be able to make a
                        legal move. After you've picked your choice the man
                        will automatically move the correct number of steps.
                        If your dice had shown a 6 you will have to throw
                        again.

        GET HELP:       If you can't decide which man to move, you will have
                        the possibility to let the computer help you. The
                        amiga will show you the man he thinks is the best to
                        take according to the brainfile you selected at the
                        opts.

        RESTART GAME:   This will rebuild the initial board setup and will
                        let you start from the beginning again.

        EXIT:           If your wish is to leave the current game, this
                        button fulfills that task.

OPTS:   This gadget leads you to the option screen where you can set the
        type of player (human, computer or none), the name and the brainfile
        to use for every single colour. When you're done, you can select OK.

EDIT:   On this screen you can edit the brainfiles. On the right there is a
        list with all currently available brainfiles. With the gadgets below
        this list you are able to CREATE a new brainfile, to DELETE an
        unneeded one, to SAVE your adjustments and to return to the main
        screen (OK). On the lefthand side you can make all the possible
        settings. These function as follows: When the computer calculates
        which man to take, it goes through this list for each man. It
        considers any of the conditions and it sums the values of the true
        ones. Then an additional chance value is added and afterwards the
        man with the greatest sum is picked. If there are more then one with
        the same highest value then the one to move is picked randomly.

QUIT:   Haa, guess what, with this button you can quit the game.

                                                     And now, have fun :->
