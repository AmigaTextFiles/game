What is Amiga Bridge?
---------------------

As you might have guessed, Amiga Bridge is an Amiga program that plays
the game bridge. It supports a subset of the bidding system described
by Eric Jannersten in his books "Bridge från grunden" and "Systemet i
ett nötskal" (I don't know their english titles, if any).
As far as I know, this is the first non-commercial bridge program
available for the Amiga. In my opinion it compares well with the
commercial ones :-) , especially when the user interface is concerned.
I admit the documentation might be a bit sparse, but who reads lengthy
documentation files anyway?

Acknowledgements
----------------

I'd like to thank some people for making life easier to live:

o Martin Ewaldz		Pascal source to PC bridge (the basics
			for the bidding system).
o Nico François		This version of Amiga Bridge uses reqtools.library
			(© Nico François) for almost all requesters.

How hands are valued
--------------------

o Honor points (hp).
  ACE => 4 hp, KING => 3 hp, QUEEN => 2 hp, KNIGHT => 1 hp.
  There are a lot of special cases where other values should be
  used. However, for simplicity the special cases are ignored.

o Distribution points (dp).
  The calculation of distribution points (as described in the books
  I've read) is complicated. It gives a different number of points
  depending on the progress of the bidding.
  I have chosen a simple approximation:
  All suits with less than 3 cards => (3 - number of cards) dp.

o Points (also refered to as "normal points").
  This is the sum of the honor points and the distribution points.

o Trick points (tp).
  The number of trick points for a hand depends on the selected trump.
  It represents how many tricks we should be able to secure with
  the specified trump (8 tp <=> 8 probable tricks).
  A table is used to find the offensive value of the honors.
  Suits with more than 3 cards give 0.5 (1 for trump) tp for each
  additional card. Only the integer part is used.

  o---------------------o-----------------------o
  | 3		E-K-Q	| 1 1/4		E-Kn-x	|  "x" represents any
  |			|		K-Q-x	|  card less than 10.
  | 2 1/2	E-K-Kn	|			|
  |		E-Q-Kn	| 1		E	|
  |			|		K-Q	|
  | 2 1/4	E-K-10	|		K-Kn-x	|
  |			|		Q-Kn-10	|
  | 2		E-K	|			|
  |		E-Q-10	| 3/4		K-Kn	|
  |		K-Q-Kn	|		K-10-9	|
  |			|			|
  | 1 3/4	E-Kn-10	| 1/2		K-x	|
  |			|		Q-Kn-x	|
  | 1 1/2	E-Q	|		Q-10-9	|
  |		K-Q-10	|			|
  |		K-Kn-10	| 1/4		Q-x	|
  |			|		Kn-10-x	|

The bidding system
------------------

The bidding system is probably the most complex part of Amiga Bridge.
I'm not going to describe it here.
There are two menu items in the "Game" menu ("Opening bids" and
"Response bids") that will help you with details about the implemented
opening & response bids possible.
However, there are other bid classes.

o Blackwood (4 NT, 4 NT - ? - 5 NT).
  The first blackwood question asks partner for number of aces,
  the second for number of kings. The second question gives the
  additional information that all the aces are accounted for.
  Amiga Bridge doesn't treat trump king (queen) as an ace (king).
  The responses are:
  4 NT:  5 C <=> 0 or 4 aces, 5 D <=> 1 ace, 5 H <=> 2 aces,
         5 S <=> 3 aces.
  5 NT:  6 C <=> 0 or 4 kings, 6 D <=> 1 king, 6 H <=> 2 kings,
         6 S <=> 3 kings.

o Normal bids. A bid that doesn't fit any convention is normal.

o Illegal bids. All unsupported bids are illegal. They don't give
  any information whatsoever. The computer never makes illegal bids.

To find the correct bid (and to learn the system), experiment!
Make a bid, then select "Display info" from the "Game" menu.
If you made the wrong bid you can always select "Restart" (or
"Restart game" from the "Game" menu) and try again.
You can also select "Auto bidding" from the "Preferences" menu and
bidding will be handled automatically.

Preferences
-----------

o Computer cheating	When selected, the computer will cheat & look
			at your cards. This results in faster (and
			sometimes better) moves. Normally the computer
			calculates simulated distributions, based on the
			information obtained from bidding.
o Auto bidding		The computer handles the bidding automagically.
o Award honor bonus	In the good old days, bonus points were awarded
			for having all the honors (or all honors in
			trump).
o Delay obvious moves	When an opponent (or your partner, when your
			opponents have claimed a contract) has but one
			card in a suit, the computer doesn't have to
			think, the move is obvious. When this item is
			selected the computer will pretend to think,
			keeping the actual distribution a secret.
o Alternate colors	How do you want your cards to be sorted?
			The hands are not redrawn at once.
o Change colors		Now why would you want to do that?
o Evaluation
  - Number of deals	The number of simulated distributions that should
			be tried. Low values will result in some rash
			moves, but (much) faster evaluation.
			Default setting: 3.
			Personally I use a value of 9. A 25 MHz A3000
			has some benefits...
  - Weight, heuristics	The weight for the heuristic part of the evaluation.
  			Amiga Bridge makes a (clever?) guess about the
  			best card to play. Default setting: 3.
  - Weight, search	The weight for the search part of the evaluation.
  			Each card is tried in turn, the max/min number
  			of won tricks is calculated. Default setting: 9.

History
-------

09 Dec 1991	First released version (1.0 ß) uploaded to ab20.

27 Dec 1991	Changed from req.library to reqtools.library. Added
		some opening conventions (highest of sequence, rule 11,
		...). Some bugs in bidding system fixed.

03 Jan 1992	Added code to handle NTSC machines. Unless a PAL screen
		can be opened (with kickstart 1.x I don't know how to
		do that on an NTSC machine) the program will abort.
		Added options 'Delay obvious moves' and
		'Alternate colors'. Version 1.01, uploaded to ab20.

06 Jan 1992	Added support for NTSC machines.
		Kickstart 2.0: If the required hardware is present and
			       a PAL monitor driver is installed, a
			       PAL screen is opened.
			       Note: a PAL monitor driver MUST be present,
			       place PAL in WBStartup!
		Kickstart 1.3: If the required hardware is present Amiga
			       Bridge will ask the user if a PAL or an
			       NTSC screen should be opened.
		Some bugs fixed.

16 Jan 1992	Some code optimizations. Added options to load / save
		distributions. Version 1.02, uploaded to ab20.

20 Jan 1992	Removed the option to switch to PAL on NTSC machines
		running kickstart 1.3. A reset seems to be required to
		make it work properly on all machines.
		I don't like the idea of user-software making resets -
		use a stand-alone PAL converter instead.
		Also, the "normal" version should work with an MC68000
		this time. The last one didn't (due to an error in my
		makefile; one file was optimized for MC68020 => GURU).
		Stupid mistake.	Version 1.03, uploaded to ab20.

06 May 1992	Fixed some minor bugs. I have been working with other
		things lately and I don't think I'll find any time
		for Amiga Bridge for quite a while.
		That's why I choose to upload this version, even if
		there are only minor improvements.
		Perhaps if some people registered... (hint, hint :-) ).
		Version 1.04.

19 Dec 1992	Mostly changes in the user interface, added possibility
		to iconify. Some small changes in bidding and playing.
		Version 1.05.

01 Jan 1993	Changed compiler. Extensive optimisations in the bidding
		and playing code. Fixed some rather serious bugs,
		one of which caused the program to discard high cards
		instead of low... Version 1.06.

Comments:
---------

o In NTSC mode, only the upper half of the cards is displayed.
  This makes it difficult to recognise some cards.
  I don't intend to fix this. The risk for playing the wrong card is
  small and there is always the Undo function.
o Extensively tested with enforcer (no results - yet).
