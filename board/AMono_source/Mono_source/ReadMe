Here is the source code for my AMonopoly game.  Included is the AMOS source as well as an ASCII version.  I have also included the graphic files used to make the game.  If I have left anything out let me know.

I hope someone out there will convert it to VP code for the Next Generation Amigas.

My releasing the source code doesn't necessarily mean that support for my version is dead, but I haven't touched the code for a while and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of interest.  I would like to take the chance to thank everyone who supported AMonopoly so far.
