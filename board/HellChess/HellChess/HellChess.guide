Have you ever downloaded any of the previous HellChess versions ?
I doubt it, but if you did, finally another update is here, and this
is quite an huge update.

HellChess is build on the BraatWorst engine meaning the game is available
for many different platforms. Currently the game is available for:
Amiga 68K
Windows
WindowsCE
Linux
Gameboy Advanced
PalmOS

More will be added ofcoz.

Note though, only the Amiga version is available for FREE!!!! :)

@{b}LHA archive@{ub}

The archive contains a few executables. You can launch them
from a cli using the proper icon. Reason for all the different
executables is because I'm using different compilers to get the
whole project to build. Kinda silly, I know.

@{b}System requirements@{ub}

030+ CPU or better.
Some fastmemory
ECS/AGA or CGFX
Minor Chess knowledge

The program requires quite alot of CPU power though, especially with
all items added to the game such as networking play, sound and animation.
I didn't want to leave anything behind on the Amiga. The PPC version will
follow as soon I can get the development environment up and running.

@{b}Any bugs we are aware off ?@{ub}

Possibly on P96 screens, or Voodoo cards the colours will display wrongly.
I hope not, but can't test it since I'm using a CyberVision :)

Swapping screens on 24bit+ screens seems to be jerky.
