                          @{fg shine}Introduction@{fg text}

   SPIDER  is  a  double-deck  solitaire  game.   In contrast to other
patience  games  (like  the  Solitaire-Game  that  comes  with Windows
respectively CardZ or Solitaire on the Amiga) it is more difficult and
provide possibilities to overcome bad luck.

   Like  all  other  card  games,  SPIDER take the roll to shuffle and
display the cards.  It also keep track of all your moves and allows to
undo  or  redo  a  move.   A full session with the actual state of the
tableau  and  the  performed  moves  can  be saved to a file and later
continued.

   This  version  is  functional  and graphical based on the excellent
'Spider' program from  Donald R. Woods from Sun Microsystems, which is
part of the OpenLook-Distribution.

                       @{fg shine}Installation Hints@{fg text}

@{b}Requirements@{ub}

   Spider needs at least Version V2.04 of the Amiga OS.  No exorbitant
memory size, harddisk capacity or CPU power is needed.  It's a nice
little game which should work on every amiga computer (tested only on
a A1000 with a MC68000).


@{b}Installation and Configuration@{ub}

   Sorry  no  Env-Variables,  Tooltypes  or  Assigns needed!  Copy the
Program,  Documentation  and  the Sessions-Directory to your favourite
place.   Perhaps  it's  only  necessary  to  change  the  Tool  of the
documentation-file from 'multiview' to 'amigaguide'.

                       @{fg shine}Rules for Spider@{fg text}

@{b}Objectives@{ub}

   The aim of the game is to build a stack of cards from King down to
Ace in the same suit.  You win the game when you have built all eight
stacks.


@{b}The tableau@{ub}

   You  play  with two decks therefore 104 cards.  After shuffling the
cards the first 54 form the initial tableau.  They are spread over ten
stacks,  but  only the last card is up-face in the stack.  The rest of
the cards remains in the hand.

   A finished sequence from Ace to King in the same suit can everytime
removed  from  the  table.  But it's more challenging to leave them on
the table and try complete all the eight stacks on the table!


@{b}Moving cards@{ub}

   The  last single card on a stack can only moved to another stack if
this  stack  is  empty, or if the last card is of the next higher rank
regardless  of  his suit (Cards rank from King (highest), Queen, Jack,
10,  9,  ..  2, Ace (lowest)).  The last cards on a stack with correct
ranking  and  the  same  suit  form a sequence which can be moved as a
single 'card'. If the card under the moved cards is down-faced it will
turned.

   For  example:   you  can  move the sequence '10,9,8 of spades' to a
'Jack  of  hearts',  but  to move a '2' onto a '4' is illegal.  Please
note  that the King is the highest card and can only moved to an empty
stack!

   If  a sequence is complete (13 cards), you can remove them into one
of  the  free  places  above the ten stacks.  But it's not possible to
remove a single or incomplete card to get a empty stack or to move the
removed cards back to the tableau!


@{b}The Hand@{ub}

    The remaining 50 cards in the hand can be dealed in 5 steps with
10 cards to the tableau. But make sure that no stack is empty!


@{b}Scoring@{ub}

To value the progress of an game, the following arbitrary formula of
scoring is used:

10 pts for each initially face down card that is turned over
15 additional pts for each stack without any face down cards
 2 pts for each card of an incomplete sequence which sits atop
   the next higher card of the same suit
50 pts for each completed sequence
 2 pts for each completed stack still the tableau (after the first three)

   That  makes 590 points for all turned cards and a sum of 990 points
for all eight completed sequences removed.  Winning with all completed
sequences on the tableau yields to a score of 1000.


@{b}Strategy@{ub}

   Perhaps the best strategy is to create at least one "space" (a empty
stack) for moving and sorting the disordered cards.

   So turn up as much cards as possible without leading the tableau to
chaos.  Thus create sequences where it is feasible, and use equivalent
moving  possibilities  to  sort and turn up new cards.  First move the
cards  with the highest ranking so that you can hang other cards below
them.  But never move a King to early to an free space!

                       @{fg shine}Controlling Spider@{fg text}

   Spider opens a window in his own screen where it display the table
with all cards. The program is controlled via Menu (see below, the A-
denotes the right Amiga-key) or equivalent keyboard-shortcuts and the
mouse by drop and drag.

   Menu-layout:

	Game 		   Play          Help
	----------------   ----------    -----------------
	New Game    A-N    Give   A-G    Suggest Move  A-M
	Start Again A-A    Undo   A-U    Information   A-I
	Open        A-O    Redo   A-R
	Save        A-S    Score  A-#
	About
	Quit        A-Q


@{b}The Display@{ub}

   The  spider  window  as four different entities.  In the upper left
corner  the  hand with the remaining cards.  The eight outlines on the
right   are  the  placeholders  for  the  removed  suits.   Below  the
placeholders  are  the eight stacks.  On the bottom of the window sits
an status-line where spider prints information or error messages.


@{b}Playing@{ub}

   The  moving  of  cards  its  totally  done  with the mouse.  Please
consider following list of possible actions and remember that even the
cleared area below a stack belongs to them.

   Mouse-actions:

   * Move last sequence from stack (mouse-down) to stack (mouse-up).
   * Remove or move sequence to (hope so) best (mouse-down-up) place.
   * Move a single card or a part of an sequence to another stack.
       (Pick card at the top)
   * "Give" the next hand (mouse-up-down on the hand)
   * "Undo" (mouse-up-down in the free table)

   Spider  also  informs  you  of  the current "Score" only on demand.
With the action "Suggest move" the novice player get a good hint which
cards  he  has  to  move  next (it's still not perfect:  has loops and
looks no pace ahead).


@{b}The Undo/Redo-buffer@{ub}

   Spider stores each performed move in an undo-redo buffer. You can
go forward and back in this buffer with "Undo" and "Redo". The stored
removes will be erased if the performed move differs with the next
move in the redo-buffer.

   This mechanism allows the user to ship the cliffs of bad luck.  But
be  honest  to  yourself,  to play without using undo/redo is the true
fulfillment!


@{b}The Game@{ub}

   It's  possible  to  restart  the same game at the beginning ("Start
Again")  or play with fresh shuffled cards ("New Game").  You can also
"Load"  or  "Save" a game-session (with full undo/redo-buffer) from or
to a file. If you are interested how many moves you have done or the
number of cards in the hand use "Information".

@endnode

@node "examples" "Examples"

   This  package  includes some sample game-sessions in the "Sessions"
directory.   You  can  "Load"  and replay them by "Starting Again" and
"Redo"  my  moves.  So can learn about my strategy and have a starting
point of games which can definitly solved.
