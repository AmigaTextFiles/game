@NODE Introduction "Introduction to Rummi"

@{u}Introduction to Rummi@{uu}

In Holland (and maybe elsewhere, I don't know) the game Rummikub is
quite popular. It is a game of combination and strategy for 2 or more
players.

This program is an Amiga implementation of this game for 2 players,
the Amiga being one and you are the other.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Requirements "System Requirements"

@{u}System Requirements@{uu}

To run this program, you need an Amiga with OS 2.04 or higher.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Installation "Installing Rummi"

@{u}Installing Rummi@{uu}

I have not supplied an installer script, as the installation is very
simple.
Just copy the program and this guide to wherever you want them to be.

No additional libraries or files required.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Start "Program Start"

@{u}Program Start@{uu}

Simple. Just double-click its icon.
Or, just type Rummi in the shell.

There are no tooltypes or parameters.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Rules "Rules of the game"

@{u}Rules of the game@{uu}

Rummi is a game with fairly simple rules. There are 104 pieces, numbered
from 1 thru 13, in 4 different colors. There are two pieces for each
color/number combination. Initially these pieces lay face-down on a pile
(the pile is not visible on the screen). Both playes take 14 pieces, and
lay them on their own tray.

The aim of the game is to get rid of all your pieces as quickly as
possible. The following rules apply:

- In each turn you may play any number of pieces by putting them from
  your tray onto the table.

- Pieces on the table may be rearranged, but not be taken back from the
  table to your own tray.

- At the end of each turn, all pieces on the table must be arranged in valid
  series of at least 3 pieces.
  Valid series may consist of:
   3 to 13 pieces of the same color but increasing value, or
   3 or 4 pieces of the same value but different colors.

- If both players have duplicate pieces (two pieces with the same color
  @{b}and@{ub} value), they may swap the duplicate pieces.

- The @{i}first@{ui} time a player plays a piece, he must play at least a total of
  30 in that same turn. Only pieces taken from his tray count in this total,
  not any pieces rearranged on the table.
  In the second and following turns there is no minimum.

- If a player cannot play any piece, he must take a piece from the pile.

- The player who is the first to lose all his pieces, wins the game.

The original game contains two jokers (wild pieces) that fit everywhere.
However, this program doesn't support jokers.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Operation "How to play"

@{u}How to play@{uu}

@{b}The beginning@{ub}
The first 14 pieces for each player are taken automaticly.
The program decides (randomly) who has the first turn, you or the program.

@{b}Moving a piece@{ub}
You can pick up a piece by clicking on it. Clicking again will drop
the piece.
You may drop the piece anywhere on the table. If the piece came from your
tray, you may put it back on your own tray again if you didn't place it
on the table.

If you drop a piece on top of an existing series, the program checks if
the piece fits. If so, the piece will be added to the proper end of the
series.
If necessary, the series will be split in two (for example: drop a 5
on top of a series 3-4-5-6-7, and the series will be split into 3-4-5 and
5-6-7).

@{b}Ending your turn@{ub}
If you cannot (or don't want to) play any more, click the gadget in the
bottom right corner of the screen.
Depending on whether you have moved or not, the gadget has some imagery
representing "take a piece" or the letters "OK".

@{b}Swapping duplicate pieces@{ub}
When you've got duplicate pieces, and the program has too (it will let you
know when it has), you can swap them.

Pick up the duplicate piece, and click on the program's tray. The piece
will be swapped. You can drop the new piece on your own tray.

You cannot swap a piece that wasn't duplicate on your tray, nor can you
swap a duplicate piece if the program hasn't any.

@{b}Invalid plays@{ub}
When you have moved and click the "OK" gadget, the program checks if you
didn't leave invalid series on the table. After your first turn, the
program checks if you did play at least a total of 30.

If there are incomplete series, or you didn't play at least 30 on your
first turn, you will see a requester. Click "OK" to make it disappear.
Then you have the chance to fix things right.

If you cannot fix it properly, just click the bottom right "OK" gadget
immediately. Any invalid series are put from the table on your tray, and
you must take 5 extra pieces from the pile for a penalty.

@ENDNODE
@NODE Menus "Rummi Menus"

@{u}Rummi Menus@{uu}

@{b}Game menu@{ub}
   @{b}Back up@{ub}
      take back the last piece played.
   @{b}New game@{ub}
      starts a new game.
   @{b}Single play@{ub}
      the program doesn't play. Perhaps nice to practice.
   @{b}About@{ub}
      give some information.
   @{b}Quit@{ub}
      quits the program.

@{b}Level menu@{ub}
   @{b}Beginner@{ub}
      the program doesn't try every (complex) combination.
   @{b}Expert@{ub}
      the program will try every combination it can think of.

@{b}Screen menu@{ub}
This serves as a replacement for the missing title bar and depth-arranging
gadgets on the screen.
   @{b}Front@{ub}
      move the screen to front.
   @{b}Back@{ub}
      move the screen to the back.
   @{b}Workbench@{ub}
      move the Workbench to front.
   @{b}Set Mode@{ub}
      set @{" screen " link Screen} mode and size and start a new game.
      (OS 3.0+ only)

@ENDNODE
@NODE Screen "Screen mode and size"

@{u}Screen mode and size@{uu}

By default, Rummi opens a 320 x 256 screen using the default monitor for
your system. The screen autoscrolls if it is larger than your display.

If running under OS 3.0 or higher, you can choose your own screen mode
and size. The settings are saved in a file named Rummi.config in the same
drawer as where the program resides. The next time you start Rummi these
settings are used.

If you have OS 2.04 you could use a utility like NewMode instead to select
your own favourite screen mode and size.

@{b}Warning@{ub}
If you select too small a screen size, there might just not be enough room
on the table to accomodate all played tiles. If the program runs out of
space, it tries to rearrange the series. If there is still not enough room,
the program will mess up the display. Some series will be drawn outside the
table, on top of your tray, on top of other series, or not drawn at all.
This makes those series unplayable for you, but the program can still
access those. If that happens, you should select a bigger screen.

@NODE Bugs "Known bugs"
