----------
IMPORTANT:
----------

 The author of this program is not in any way responsible for any
damage caused by this software WHAT SO EVER!!!

This version of Solitaire is FREEWARE, so you can give it to
anyone you want.  It should be distributed as FreeWare, and anyone
can include it in their PD library (or something similar), as long
as they charge only a minor fee for copying.

  Fred Fish is also allowed to include this program in his
excellent Fred Fish PD library.

Computer magazines and other computer publications are NOT allowed
to include it with their product without my written permission!!!!



----------------------------------
What do you need to use Solitaire:
----------------------------------

You will need:

  * One (or more) Amiga(s) (!)
  * A M68020 processor (or higher),
  * At least Kickstart V3.0 (V39) (or higher),
  * And an AGA machine (A1200/A4000(-030/-040)/CD32???)

But if you are a developer, you should be able to play the game as
long as you have a 68020 or better, KS 3.0, and you use a
HIRES|LACED Workbench.....



-------------------
Quick Installation:
-------------------

Just copy the following files to the desired directory:

  Solitaire            - The main program executable
  Solitaire.info       - The icon for the main program
  Solitaire.prefs      - Prefs info for the main program
  Solitaire.guide      - AmigaGuide help file
  Solitaire.guide.info - Icon for the help file

And copy the following files to your font(s) director(y/ies):

  Doritos/     - The directory containing the font file
    16         - The font file itself
  Doritos.font - The font description file

If the font files are missing or something like that, Solitaire
will work, but it will use Topaz/8 instead.  But I really hope
that it's not necessary, because it looks that much better with
the Doritos font..



If you couldn't manage to get Solitaire to work, read the
AmigaGuide help file.


------
Usage:
------

 Using this program should be self explaining.  If you have ever
played the Windows version of "Solitaire" on a PC, playing the
Amiga version should be veeery easy.
