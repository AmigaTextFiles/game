 In this Solitaire release the AmigaGuide docs are not quite
finished!!  The sections on "How to Play Solitaire" are not
finished, and the "Index" page is not finished either. Some of the
hypertext links are also missing.The reason for this is that
writing the AmigaGuide doc simply took too much time..

Getting started
***************

To be able to play Solitaire, you will need:

  * One (or more) Amiga(s) (!)
  * A M68020 processor (or higher),
  * At least Kickstart V3.0 (V39) (or higer),
  * And an AGA machine (A1200/A4000(-030/-040)/CD32???)

But if you are a developer, you should be able to play the game as
long as you have a 68020 or better, KS 3.0, and you use a
HIRES|LACED Workbench.....


The complete solitaire archive should consist of these files:

ReadMe.txt           - Quick info
ReadMe.txt.info      - Icon for readme file

Solitaire            - Main Program
Solitaire.info       - Icon for Solitaire
Solitaire.prefs      - Prefs settings

Solitaire.guide      - AmigaGuide hypertext doc for Solitaire
Solitaire.guide.info - Icon for the hypertext doc

doritos/16           - The font itself
doritos.font         - The font description file


To install the program, just copy:

 * Solitaire, Solitaire.info, Solitaire.prefs
   (OPTIONAL: Solitaire.guide, Solitaire.guide.info)

to the desired directory, and then copy:

 * Doritos/16, Doritos.font

to your fonts directory.

You don't have to use the font which comes with this program, it
uses Topaz/8 if it doesn't find the supplied font.  But I really
recommend that you use it, because it generally looks nicer if you do.

If you have problems getting started, look at the @{" Troubleshooting " link item_trouble} section.

Problem 1 - Solitaire allways opens on a PRODUCTIVITY screen
************************************************************

  At startup time Solitaire tries to lock the default public screen,
to duplicate it's properties.  If there is no default public screen,
or the default public screen is smaller than:  640*460, Solitaire opens
it's own screen.  In this version of Solitaire, a VGA-PRODUCTIVITY
screen is used if it cannot clone the default public screen.
This might change in the future...

Problem 2 - Solitaire uses Topaz/8 as the screenfont
****************************************************

  The supplied font (Doritos/16) should reside in your fonts: directory,
(or any other font: assigns), if it doesn't Solitaire uses Topaz/8.

Solitaire opens a FPB_DESIGNED font (looks nicer that way!), so it will
always fail if the correct font file isn't present.

If the font file wasn't included in the archive you got, please try to
get a complete archive...

Solitaire is not "really" font sensetive, so the gadget placements and sizes
are hard-coded. So using Topaz/8 may not look nice, but it will work.

Some day Solitare MAY become a font-sensetive program...
(I'll just have to code some really nice GUI routines first, 
OR wait for Kick 4.0!!...8)

Problem 3 - Solitaire doesn't use my config
*******************************************

  The config file that Solitaire reads at startup time, must reside in
the directory that contains the main executable. The current directory
must also be the directory that contains the main program (Solitaire).

If, upon startup, some of these conditions aren't met, or the .prefs file
is missing, Solitaire will produce an error message @{" Error 8 " link item_e_8}.

Solitaire Bugs
**************

  This program should be mostly free from major bugs and quirks.
But because of the size and complexity of this program, there are a
few things that I have left unfixed. Either because I just wasn't able
to fix the problem (in this version), or it was of such character that
it wasn't really a "bug".
Anyway, none of the "bugs" should affect anything in a serious manner.

This program has been developed and tested with the use of the "Enforcer"
debug-tool. It has been tested thoroughly on the following machine 
configurations:

  * A4000-040 (/1952) - Standard config + 100Mb extra HD
  * A4000-030 (/1942) - Standard config
  * A1200     (/1940) - Standard config (with HD).

This program has also been tested under extreme conditions like:

  * Low memory (CHIP and FAST),
  * Started on A500 (KS 1.2),
  * the most commonly used WB screen configurations,
  * wrong versions of several libraries etc...

This program should also free ALL resources and memory when exited.


But there are still a few things that needs fixing.
Here is a quick summation of the "bugs" that I know to exist:

----

If you use LARGE fonts (bigger than 20-30 pixels) as your "Screen Text",
some of the card-graphics or gadgets may get trashed.

---

Sometimes, when selecting "Save" in the @{" Card Prefs " link item_w_2} window,
it will redraw all the cards, even if you did not choose a new image.

 This menu-item allows you to start a new game. The deck is re-shuffled,
and all your game statistics (score, time etc.) will be reset, except
if you are playing the "Vegas" game type.

 Upon choosing this menu-item, a requester will pop up asking if you
really want a "New Game". Choosing "No" will allow you to continue
with the old game, choosing "Yes", will start a new game.

********************

 If you are playing a "-Timed" or "-Timed with Score" game, this will
temporarily stop the game timer (clock), until you choose "Continue"
from the requester that pops up.

 This will prevent the internal timer from running without you playing,
and this again prevents your game score from decreasing.

This gadget allows you to enter your name, it can be a maximum of 32
characters in length. If you select Save/Use, the @{" Name " link item_ms_2} textbox 
on the main screen will be updated to contain the new name. 
In this version of Soltaire the name is not really useful, but when the

@{b}@{u}Level - [cycle]:@{ub}@{uu}
There are to "Game Levels" in Solitare in this version, they are:
"Easy" and "Hard". (Read the @{" Gameplay " link item_gameplay} section for further info on gametypes).
If the selection you made is different than the initial setting, Solitaire

@{b}***************************@{ub}
Game configuration gadgets:
@{b}***************************@{ub}

@{b}@{u}Shuffle - [slider]:@{ub}@{uu}
The slider value is used to determine the number of times the @{" Cards " link item_?}
are shuffled before they're dealed.
The slider range is: 1 (min) <->  50 (max).

@{b}@{u}Warning Requester(s) - [checkbox]:@{ub}@{uu}
Checked....: Solitaire will put up requesters every time you do something
             illegal.

Not Checked: Solitaire will only put up requesters that's really necessary.

@{b}@{u}Warning Beep - [checkbox]:@{ub}@{uu}
Checked....: You will get a DisplayBeep() each time you do something
             wrong/illegal.

Not Checked: DisplayBeep() is only used when necessary.

@{b}@{u}Extended Drop Field - [checkbox]:@{ub}@{uu}
Checked....: With this option enabled, you can drop cards at any position
             below the stack you want to put them on, and if the cards are
             of the the "right type" they will end up in that stack.

Not Checked: This only allows you to drop cards at the stack, or else the 
             cards are put back in the source stack.

PS! Try this one out, it's really not that easy to explain how it works!!

@{b}@{u}Cheat Mode - [checkbox]:@{ub}@{uu}
Checked....: Allows you to CHEAT (nifty huh!)

Not Checked: Doesn't allow you to CHEAT (now isn't that unfair!)

I really can't tell you any more about this function, that would really
spoil all the fun!

@{b}@{u}UnDo - [checkbox]:@{ub}@{uu}
Checked....: With this function, you can undo your last move.
             A move is: Moving (a) card(s), Turning a card, 
             Get new cards from the @{" Shuffe Stack " link item_?2}, @{ "Double Clicking " link item_?3}.
             
Not Checked: No undo option available.

Since it's really easy to "UnDo" stuff, I could allow multiple undo levels
in the future.

@{b}@{u}Animate End - [checkbox]:@{ub}@{uu}

About Solitaire
***************

 This implementaion of the card game Solitaire, was adapted from the
PC version which is bundeled with Windows @{i}(c) Microsoft@{ui} 3.0+.
It is one of the best and most addictive "GUI" games I have ever played.
But since I am no real PC fan (no offence), I just had to make a Amiga
version that was at least as good as the Windows version.

 To be able to to that, I had to get hold of a "REAL computer",
so I bought a A4000-030. This is really the first computer I have 
ever had, which would enable me to write the "Ultimate Solitaire".
(You really can't imagine how horrible it is to write programs on
an diskbased A500!!!).

 I decided to write this program in C, because it's really the best and
simplest way to write system-friendly software. And since it demands
that you at least have an A1200 (KickStart 3.0 & AGA-chipset), 
speed wasn't that important.


@{b}This version of solitaire was developed with:@{ub}
  * SAS/C 6.2, SAS/C 6.3 (really the only choice..)
  * CygnusED V3.5
  * Toolmaker V1.19
  * DOPUS V4.01, DOPUS V4.10 (it really is the ultimate directory utility)
  * DeluxePaint V4.5, V4.6

Future plans
************

 If I get any positive feedback, what so ever, I will brobably continue
to make this program better.


Here is a list of some of the future plans I have in mind:

  * Locale support
    (Only if YOU will translate the locale files for me!)
  * Online AmigaGuide help
  * Solitaire in a Window on any public screen
  * Scaling of cards if window is sized
  * Userdefined IFF (brush) card images
  * Userdefined ANIM-BRUSH card backs
  * Game "recorder" (& playback - Allows playback of old games)
  * More different "game types"
  * I'll maybe even include different types of cardgames
  * Userdefinable fonts


I would apprechiate it if you sent me suggestions (or bug reports).

@{b}@{u}Spc thanks to:@{ub}@{uu}
  * Lars Hamre, who not only @{b}@{u}FORCED@{ub}@{uu} [ :-) ] me to make this game, 
    but also gave me some good ideas, and coded the excellent
    "card move blit" routines, and not to forget: Helped me with
    the BOOPSI ImageGClass implementation.
    Keep up the good work (at SCALA).

  * Morten W. Lund.


@{b}@{u}I would really like to thank:@{ub}@{uu}
  * Stefan Becker for writing ToolManager (V2.1), without it I doubt
    that I'd ever written this program.
  * Martin Laubach for writing Arq.
  * All the guys at Commodore for making things like:
    The A4000, AGA, Kick & WB 3.0, Amiga Guide, bla, bla, bla....

    It's really sad to see the ultimate Soft&Hardware team ever
    fall apart, just because the management didn't know how
    to market all the great products they made.

    Thanks for making an effort....


@{b}@{u}Personal thanks to:@{ub}@{uu}
  * Anders, Kim, Henning (and his brother for making the 
    greatest loudspeakers EVER!!!!) & Tor-Einar.
  * And not to forget Stig Johansen. His first ever credit in
    an Amiga program. (He is really a PC freak, the poor sod!)
    

@{b}@{u}With continuing inspiration from:@{ub}@{uu}
  * ELP, Genesis, Brand X, Marillion, King Crimson, Yes,
    Rush, Primus, Fish and all prog-rockers out there.

    We are a dying breed.....



I hope you like this....

About the author
****************

 I'm 19 years of age, and I have been using computers (Amiga/PC) since 1988.
Since then I have studied electronics/computers for tree years, and later
this year (1993/early 1994) I will join the army (I didn't volunteer!!).

I've written programs in BASIC, PASCAL (Amiga & PC) and Assembly laguage
until now. But when I bough my A4000, C seemed to be the "natural" choice.

Solitaire is one of my "first" C programs, and because of that it's
not perfect. But one of my highest goals are to write system friendly
and highly configurable programs, and I think that Solitaire has reached
that goal.

 Since Solitaire is the first program I have ever "released" to the general
public, I would really apprechiate some feedback.

Solitaire History
*****************

@{b}V0.00 -> V0.74@{ub} - Internal releases

@{b}V0.75@{ub}          - Solitaire V1.0a.
                 First general release, not spread to the public

@{b}V0.76 -> V0.80@{ub} - Internal releases (code optimizing)

@{b}V0.82@{ub}          - Solitaire V1.01a.
                 Second general release, first version spread to the
                 Amiga comunity.

@{b}V0.85@{ub}          - Solitaire V1.02.
                 V1.01a wasn't as bug free as it should be, 
                 so it wasn't realeased.

                 In V1.02 several bugs and "known ??features??" has
                 been removed. And finally we've got the BOOPSI stuff
                 working. (It wasn't easy!!!)

                 This probably will be the last update of Solitaire in
                 quite a while. (Unnless I get a lot of feedback...)

@{b}V0.86@{ub}          - The same as V0.85, but the graphics are cleaned
                 up a bit..

@{b}V0.87@{ub}          - Solitaire V1.03
                 A few SMALL but irritating bugs have been removed,
                 the graphics have been cleaned up yet again, the
                 main program is also a few kb smaller...

                 This WILL be the FIRST public release!!!!!!!!!
