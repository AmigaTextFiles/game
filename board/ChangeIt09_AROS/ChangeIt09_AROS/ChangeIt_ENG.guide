@{FG SHINE}Game requirements:@{FG TEXT}



- datatypes.library

- png.datatype

- AHI

- GFX card (recommended)



Running the game on AGA chipset is possible, but there might appear some glitches on some graphic elements.



Game runs on Workbench screen. Number of required screen colors depends on the skin you selected.



There are available different sets of skins. To choose a skin you need to enter skin's catalog name in the game icon's tooltype. You may also run the game using previously written AmigaDOS script and attaching it under the suitable icon.



Skin's catalog should contain following files:

main.iff - defines the bricks available in game,

skin.iff - defines the game background and buttons,

About - information about the author of the skin.

FONTS - skin custom font catalog,

sound - skin samples.



For better hardware configurations it is recommended to use parameter EXTRAGFX=1. This parameter activates additional graphic effects. Extra graphic effects may be set using tooltypes, parameters or simple by pressing F1 key in the game.

@{B}How to play?@{UB}

When you select game mode, you can see the board with 64 randomly chosen elements arranged in 8 rows with 8 elements in each.

Main goal of the player is to change the position of two neighbouring elements in order to obtain at least three elements of the same shape and colour in vertical or horizontal line. If it happens, the bricks disappear. You may change only elements which are directly next to themselves.

To change bricks, you should click left mouse button between two bricks of your choice.

The Bricks will swap only if the game can be proceeded further.



In Time Attack mode the player has 1 minute to collect number of points required by the game in order to finish the level and progress to another one. The player is awared with extra points for any time left.



In Brick Hunt mode the player has 1 minute to remove required number of special blocks in order to finish the level and progress to another one. The player is awared with extra points for any time left. In this mode the player can get bonuses such as extra time, removal of all blocks of chosen type or appearing of the additional block on board.





@{B}Scoring system@{UB}

- 3 bricks - 3 points.

- 4 bricks - 10 points plus new brick which makes "explosion" when arranged with other bricks. For every brick which was removed in that way you get 3 points.

- 5 bricks - 30 points plus bonus - you will get extra brick which you can swap with any other brick making that all the bricks of the same colour disappear from the board. For every brick which was removed in that way you get 5 points.

You can get extra points for "avalanche situations", ie. during one change of the block's position you can make other blocks to disappear in a chain reaction. In such case you are rewarded with points which are calculated as points of removed blocks multiplied by the avalanche degree.

In case of not being able to make any further moves, the suitable requester appears.





@{B}Buttons@{UB}

Main menu:

New Game - starts the new game with the possibility to choose game mode.

HiScore - shows Top Ten scores table for the last played difficulty level. After running the game for the first time, it shows the table for Easy mode.

About - information about current version and bricks presentation.

Quit - quits the game.
