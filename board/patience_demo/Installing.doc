Installing Patience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing patience is easy....make a directory for it, and copy the music
files, the config, and the high scores file into it.  Assign Patience: to
this directory.

Make sure that garnet.font is in fonts: and medplayer.library is in libs:,
and you are ready to go !

Click the icon, and you're done.

e.g.

assign patience: work:patience
copy patience patience:
copy patience.config patience:
copy patience.scores patience:
copy P_CardFlip.MEDmod patience:
copy P_Music.MEDmod patience:
copy P_TryAgain.MEDmod patience:
copy medplayer.library libs:
makedir fonts:garnet
copy garnet fonts:garnet
copy garnet.font fonts:garnet

I think that's it !

Robert.
