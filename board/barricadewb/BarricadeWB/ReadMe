Game rules:
Every barricade player have 1 to 8 pawns. The point is to place all your pawns

their turns in order. In each turn player moves one of his or her pawns number
of game fields equal to numer on six-sided dice. When counting fields you cant

placed on any empty game field. When move ends on field with other pawn on it
