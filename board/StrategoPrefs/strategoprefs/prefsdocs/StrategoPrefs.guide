    StrategoPrefs is a preference editor for @{"Stratego" link ABOUTSTRATEGO} which simplifies the
configuration of Stratego via a @{"MUI" link ABOUTMUI} interface. Stratego takes it's config.
from tooltypes in the Stratego icon but one of the team associated with
Stratego voiced the opinion that a prefs editor was needed so here it is!

    Stratego is a completely multi-tasking game which requires very little CPU
time! The game runs on a 4-bit-plane (16 color), HighRes Interlaced screen and
is mode promotable.

The game board is your battlefield; you have an army of 33 men, and 6 bombs
which you must use to capture your enemy's flag while protecting your own. Both
you and your adversary will secretly layout your respective pieces to build a
good defence as well as an incisive attacking strategy. Once both you and your
opponent have your armies in place, it is time to advance and conquer in an
attempt to capture the enemy flag!

For more details please refer to the Stratego documentation.

@node INSTALLATION "Installation"

    There are two ways to install StrategoPrefs:

    1. Copy the StrategoPrefs directory & icon wherever you want it.

    2. Use the supplied install script. This does exactly the same thing
       as 1 but does it in a user friendly manner so it is a Good Thing.

@endnode
@node REQUIREMENTS "Requirements"

    To use StrategoPrefs you need:

    o Stratego (otherwise this is a nice looking, but completely useless,
      editor).

    o 68020 or above.

    o MUI 3.8

    o WB 3.n

    To view the pictures which accompany this document you will need a
png datatype.

@node MENU_PROJ_OPEN "StrategoPrefs, Project Menu, Open"

    This option allows you to open an icon and read the tootypes
contained within it. It only make sense to select the Stratego icon for use
with this option as selecting an icon which does not contain any of the
tootypes recognised by Stratego will result in a default configuration.
If you select an icon which contains Stratego recognised tooltypes then
these will be loaded and used to update the configuration.

@endnode
@node MENU_PROJ_SAVE "StrategoPrefs, Project Menu, Save"

    This will attempt to save the current settings to an icon. If you have
previously loaded or saved data to/ from an icon it will write the settings
out to it, otherwise you will be requested to enter a name. Please see
@{"Save As" link MENU_PROJ_SAVEAS} for more details of saving to icon.

    NB: If StrategoPrefs is started from Stratego then this is the only icon
operation which can be performed: @{"Open" link MENU_PROJ_OPEN} and @{"Save As" link MENU_PROJ_SAVEAS} are automatically disabled
to prevent confusion.

@endnode
@node MENU_PROJ_SAVEAS "StrategoPrefs, Project Menu, Save As"

    This will attempt to save the current settings to an icon. You will
be requested to enter a name to save the data under: it is not necessary to
add the '.info' extension as one will be added for you but I check for
this prior to writing so if you have added the .info extension StrategoPrefs
will not add it again. Note that if the icon does not exist the you @{b}MUST@{ub}
have def_stratego.info in a subdirectory 'graphics/' in the same directory
as StrategoPRefs or the save will fail. StrategoPrefs is completely friendly
to NewIcons and will not change any tooltypes which may exist in the icons
it saves to unless it understands them. I have tried to conform to the
NewIcons convention of placing 'real' tooltypes before the NewIcons data. If
you encounter any problems with this then please @{"contact me" link AUTHOR}!

@endnode
@node MENU_PROJ_ABOUT "StrategoPrefs, Project Menu, About"

    When you select this you will be presented with a window containing
a small amount of information about StrategoPrefs.

@endnode
@node MENU_PROJ_QUIT "StrategoPrefs, Project Menu, Quit"

    This will close down StrategoPrefs. If StrategoPrefs was started from
inside Stratego you will be returned to it.

@endnode
@node MENU_EDIT_DEFAULT "StrategoPrefs, Edit Menu, Reset To Defaults"

    This sets the preferences to their default state ie:

        Sound               On
        Fog Of War          On
        Aggressor Advantage Off
        Silent Defense      Off
        Rescue              Off
        Display             Own screen
        Graphics Mode       ECS

    It is possible to undo this operation by selecting @{"Restore" link MENU_EDIT_RESTORE} under the
Edit menu.

@endnode
@node MENU_EDIT_LASTSAVE "StrategoPrefs, Edit Menu, Last Saved"

    When selected this will restore the preferences set last time any
data was saved. You can undo this by selecting @{"Restore" link MENU_EDIT_RESTORE} from the Edit menu.

@endnode
@node MENU_EDIT_RESTORE "StrategoPrefs, Edit Menu, Restore"

    This undoes the last major operation (ie: every time a menu operation
is selected). It is possible to undo the undo by selecting this item again.

@endnode
@node MENU_PRESET_LOAD "StrategoPrefs, Presets Menu, Load"

    StrategoPrefs can also load and save a custom format preferences file
which makes it easy for you to compile a number of commonly used setups
which can be loaded easily.

    To load a preset file select this option and you will be presented with
an ASL request. Select the file you want to load and StrategoPrefs will do
the rest. If you want you can undo this operation by selecting @{"Restore" link MENU_EDIT_RESTORE}
from the Edit menu.

@endnode
@node MENU_PRESET_SAVE "StrategoPrefs, Presets Menu, Save"

    StrategoPrefs can also load and save a custom format preferences file
which makes it easy for you to compile a number of commonly used setups
which can be loaded easily.

    To save a preset file select this option and you will be presented with
an ASL request. Enter the name you want to save the current preferences
under and click on 'save'. If the file already exists you will be asked
to confirm the overwrite. If you cancel the overwrite requester nothing
will be saved. If you confirm it then the old file will be erased and the
current preferences written over it. @{b}Be very careful when you overwrite file@{ub}s
as it is impossible to get them back!

@node TOOLTYPES "ToolTypes"

    There are 3 tooltypes understood by StrategoPrefs:

@{B}SERVERLIST@{UB}

    Specifies the file used to store the list of TCP servers. If this is not
given the StrategoPrefs defaults to using PROGDIR:StrategoPrefs.serverlist
If the file does not exist you will be informed of this fact by StrategoPrefs
while it is setting up. StrategoPrefs will automatically attempt to write the
server list out to this file when you quit StrategoPrefs.

@{B}DEFICON@{UB}

    Allows you to specify an icon StrategoPrefs should attempt to load on
startup. You will be informed if this icon can not be opened. If the open
succeeds then selecting @{"Save" link MENU_PROJ_SAVE} from the menu or interface will save to this
icon until you change the current icon via @{"Save As..." link MENU_PROJ_SAVEAS}.

@{B}DEFPRESET@{UB}

    If this tooltype is given then StrategoPrefs will attempt to load the
specified preset file. If it fails then you will be informed of this but
StrategoPrefs will continue to operate.


                                 @{FG shine}Important Note@{FG text}

    DEFICON and DEFPRESET are mutually exclusive. If both are given in the
tooltypes list then DEFPRESET is completely ignored (even if the icon
specified by DEFICON can not be loaded).

@node HISTORY "Where StrategoPrefs has been"

@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.1 (18.11.1997) 19:55:58 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Interface code started. Implementing interface using MUI, reusing standard
MUI setup routines from HexASCII (another one of my MUI projects, not released)
to make implmentation faster.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.2 (18.11.1997) 21:32:43 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal evaluation version@{ui}

Interface complete (not including TCP setup stuff). This version distibuted
for comments.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.3 (18.11.1997) 22:08:54 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Added 'Load...' and 'Save As...' options wo allow extra prefs files (may 
make the inclusion of preferences files easier later on). Also moved all
prefs data into a 'StrategoPrefs' structure to make loading/ saving easier.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.4 (19.11.1997) 20:01:28 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Added display mode, required movement of groups to produce a clean look
(just sticking the cycle in made the display ugly). Also added Presets
menu to allow the Project options to be devoted to icons and the Presets
menu given over to prefs files. Started preset load/ save.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.5 (22.11.1997) 19:06:53 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Preset load/ save working.
 
Bugfix in SavePreset():
 
    If target file already exists, and the user clicks on 'Overwrite' then
the file is not truncated. Fixed this by closing the file opened using
MODE_OLDFILE and reopened it in MODE_NEWFILE.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.6 (22.11.1997) 22:28:46 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Massive bug in CompactInterface(). GetAttrs() assumes a LONG for the storage
but I was using BOOLs and BYTEs and these were not being set correctly by
GetAttrs(). I have solved this by having a temp variable 'Attribute' which is
set by GetAttrs() and then inspected (or cast in most cases) to set the field
in the prefs struct.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.7 (23.11.1997) 15:55:57 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

All 'Edit Menu' routines working correctly now.

Added filters to preset ASL requests so they are set up to filter out all
but .prefs files.

Added About window.

'Open...' now works, including display of currently loaded file in the editor
title bar (clipped to 15 characters for clarity).


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.8 (23.11.1997) 16:43:54 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal evaluation version@{ui}

Removed memory loss on shutdown caused by not freeing the whole of the
window title buffer. Fixed by recalculating the length for the free as
well as the allocate.

This version sent out for evaluation & bugtesting.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.9 (24.11.1997) 21:48:53 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Added command line options:

    GHOSTSETUP/S    If set then the Initial Rules and Display groups
                    are ghosted and may not be altered by the user.

    PREFSFILE/K     If sepecified then the file is loaded as a StrategoPrefs
                    Preset file.

    PREFSICON/K     This is used to specify the icon to read at startup.


These are deliberately not documented; they are provided for the sole purpose
of the Stratego <-> StrategoPrefs interface and are not intended for general
use.

Added file parameters to LoadPreset() and OpenIcon() to make file loading
easier.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.10 (24.11.1997) 21:59:56 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Fixed stupid bug in LoadPreset (|| instead of && in the 'retry|cancel'
loop.. DOH!). Changed interface so that the whole initial rules and display
groups can be ghosted.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.11 (25.11.1997) 19:05:44 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Added status line. Project/Open... and Project/Save As... are now ghosted
when GHOSTSETUP is specified.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.12 (25.11.1997) 21:47:18 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Locale support included, main interface localised (still got to localise
StrategoPrefs_IO.c strings).


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.13 (26.11.1997) 20:07:22 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

13.. Unlucky for some (but I may as well sit under a ladder breaking mirrors
for my luck). Anyway, I have finished localisation of all files. Cleaned
up startup code, removed some redundant functions, moved MAKE_ID macro
to StrategoPrefs.h out of the way.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 0.14 ( 7.12.1997) 11:30:24 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Moved all icon processing routines into a seperate .c file to make code
more readable.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.0 (7.12.1997) 18:40:21 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal evaluation version@{ui}

Icon save now implemented. Only aspect remaining is the TCP section.

This version sent out for evaluation & bugtesting.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.1  ( 9.12.1997) 21:23:41 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Added TCP options, currently working on TCPServer list.

Fixed 4 byte memory leak from mismatched FreeMem in ExitMUI() caused by using
PROGNAME + 31 instead of strlen(GetStr(ID_MSG_PRGNAME, MSG_PRGNAME)) + 31

NOTE: Localising multi-column list titles does not appear to work correctly.
When I attempt it the program generates a number of enforcer hits related to
the hook function. I will attempt to recify this in a later revision.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.2  (10.12.1997) 21:59:17 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

TCP popup fully functional, TCP server list auto load/save completed. TCP
options are not yet saved to icon though.


@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.3  (11.12.1997) 15:46:32 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

TCP options now load/ save to icons & presets. Menus fully localised.

Looks like more or less everything completed now.......


@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.4  (11.12.1997) 20:56:58 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}First public release version@{ui}

Fixed spin lock in EditServerEntry caused by omitting the wait (DOH!). Added
the alias handler which allows the short server name to be replaced with the
full server TCP entry/ IP address...


@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.5  (24.01.1998) 15:15:03 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Internal version@{ui}

Bug fix, reported by George:

" Just adding a bit more prefs support here, and I found a bug in Stratego
Prefs:

start StrategoPrefs with:

StrategoPrefs GHOSTSETUP PREFSICON=Stratego

Now if your previous setup was Fog ticked, and Sound off, when you start up
the next time, the Fog box is not disabled (it should be becuase the sound box
is not active)."


@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.6  (25.01.1998) 19:57:50 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{i}Second public release version@{ui}

'Bug' fix: If started from workbench the ASL requester always defaults
to 'sys:' Fixed by initialising requesters with PROGDIR:


@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.7  (21.02.1998) 14:17:26 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}

Added DEFICON and DEFPRESET tooltypes after a request from Trevor. Fixed
bug in startup which would halt the setup if the icon couldn't be loaded.

Added 'current icon' display to About requester.


@{B}StrategoPrefs 1.8  (21.02.1998) 15:13:06 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{UB}
@{I}Third public release version@{UI}

Added SERVERLIST tooltype and updated StrategoPrefs.guide. Converted graphics
to png format for better compression.

@{b}StrategoPrefs 1.9  (16.03.1998) 19:52:19 by Chris <dasoft@zetnet.co.uk>@{ub}
@{I}Fourth public release version@{UI}

'Bugfix': Locale would not open on 3.0 machines (I open v39, 3.0 only has v38)
Fixed by simply opening v38 instead!
