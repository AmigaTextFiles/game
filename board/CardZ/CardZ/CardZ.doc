     1. General
     
     CardZ is a program for playing several patience games.
     
     The game rules are included in the program.
     
     Release 2.04 or higher is required.
     
     Since a 640x256 PAL HiRes screen is used, CardZ cannot run on those
     NTSC systems, which cannot display this.
     
     
     2. Distribution
     
     CardZ is NOT Public Domain, but copyrighted freeware : it may be
     distributed and used freely.
     
     CardZ may not be sold, but inclusion in a PD-library is permitted as
     long as only a SMALL fee is charged to cover the costs of copying and
     distribution. The Fred Fish Library is the perfect example.
     
     Program and documentation must be distributed together.
     It concerns the files CardZ, CardZ.info, CardZ.doc and CardZ.doc.info.
     
     
     3. Developing environment
