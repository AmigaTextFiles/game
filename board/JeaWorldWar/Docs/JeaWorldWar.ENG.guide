This program is my first exit as Amiga programmer (also if I write programs
by  ten years, I begun on the C64) and is my third program writed in E (the
first  was  suspended,  the second is desaparecido...).  I begun with the E
language by eight months and securely i would have obtained the same result
with engagement minus...  you will be good with me?
