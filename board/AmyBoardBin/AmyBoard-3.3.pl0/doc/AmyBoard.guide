GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  675
     Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     @{i}one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.@{ui}
     Copyright (C) 19@{i}yy@{ui}  @{i}name of author@{ui}
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19@{i}yy@{ui} @{i}name of author@{ui}
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands @{b}show w@{ub} and @{b}show c@{ub} should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @{b}show w@{ub} and @{b}show c@{ub};
they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.
     
     @{i}signature of Ty Coon@{ui}, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

How to configure, compile and install AmyBoard.
***********************************************

   AmyBoard requires OS 2.04, 1 MB of RAM and MUI 2.0 or later.  To
play against the Amiga you need GNU Chess installed. (Aminet,
@{b}game/think@{ub} directory) To play on the ICS you need a telnet program
(AmiTCP/IP, AS225 or whatever else) reading from stdin and writing to
stdout or a modem and a terminal program using stdin/stdout as well.

   After unpacking the binary archive to @{b}RAM:@{ub}, you should run the
installation script by doubleclicking the icon @{b}Install@{ub}. This icon
assumes that you have the Commodore @{b}Installer@{ub} in your workbench path.
If you still don't have the @{b}Installer@{ub}, you can get it from @{b}Aminet@{ub},
@{b}util/misc@{ub} directory.

   Installation will be done in one directory, say @{b}WORK:@{ub}, a
subdirectory @{b}AmyBoard@{ub} will be created. The binary and some icons will
be in @{b}WORK:AmyBoard@{ub}, config files in @{b}WORK:AmyBoard/lib@{ub}.  (1) If you
have a recent version of AmyBoard in the same directory, the old config
files and icons will be copied to @{b}WORK:AmyBoard/obsolete@{ub}, so that you
can reuse them.

   Once the installation script is done, you should start AmyBoard with
the @{b}Work:AmyBoard/AmyBoard@{ub} icon and the @{b}MUI@{ub} prefs. Change the colors
and size of the board, the location of the window until you like it,
then save these settings with the MUI prefs.

   The installation script will create a preferences file
@{b}AmyBoard.prefs@{ub} for you.  This file is assumed preliminary (though
perfectly usable), it is a good idea to edit and modify it using your
favourite text editor. Things you might wish to change are:
   @{b}*@{ub} The colors; this is done by changing the pen numbers
     @{b}whitePiecePen@{ub}, @{b}blackPiecePen@{ub}, @{b}lightSquarePen@{ub} and
     @{b}darkSquarePen@{ub}. Registered MUI users should keep the values -1
     which indicate to use the default MUI colors @{b}Shinepen@{ub}, @{b}Shadowpen@{ub},
     @{b}Halfshinepen@{ub} and @{b}Halfshadowpen@{ub}, respectively, and use the MUI
     prefs to change the colors.

   @{b}*@{ub} Path and memory requirements of the GNU Chess binary: More memory
     improves the strength of GNU Chess. (The installation script
     already did this for you.) The memory requirements are changed
     with the arguments -C and -T:
    @{b}-C 1001 -T 4001@{ub}
          about 1 MByte

    @{b}-C 3001 -T 20001@{ub}
          about 2 MByte

    @{b}-C 4001 -T 30001@{ub}
          about 2.5 MByte

    @{b}-C 6001 -T 40001@{ub}
     To tell AmyBoard that the GNU Chess binary is in
     @{b}Fun:gnuchess-4.0.pl74@{ub} and you want it to allocate about 1 MByte
     RAM you would enter
              firstChessProgram=Fun:gnuchess-4.0.pl74/gnuchessx -C 1001 -T 4001
              secondChessProgram=Fun:gnuchess-4.0.pl74/gnuchessx -C 1001 -T 4001

     It is important to use the complete path here, as the AmigaDOS
     function @{b}LoadSeg@{ub} ignores your path settings.  See
     @{"GNU Chess options" Link "GNU Chess options"}.

   @{b}*@{ub} The default time settings of GNU Chess: Variables @{b}movesPerSesssion@{ub}
     and @{b}timeControl@{ub}.  See @{"GNU Chess options" Link "GNU Chess options"}.

   @{b}*@{ub} Your favourite ICS host (@{b}icsHost@{ub}) and port number (@{b}icsPort@{ub}). (You
     probably won't need to change the defaults, as the installation
     script can create ICS icons for different hosts, which override
     these settings.) See @{"ICS options" Link "ICS options"}.

   @{b}*@{ub} The name of your telnet or terminal program. (Note, that this @{i}must@{ui}
     use stdin and stdout!) The installation script lets you select
     one. (Again, note that you have to use the complete path.) See
     @{"ICS options" Link "ICS options"}.  See @{"Serial ICS connection" Link "Serial ICS connection"}.

For the full set of AmyBoard's options see See @{"Invocation" Link "Invocation"}.

   Be sure, that the programs stack is no less than 10000 bytes. This
is especially important, when running the program from Toolmanager, as
the default value of Toolmanagers @{b}Exec Objects@{ub} are 4096 bytes only.

   If you would like to recompile AmyBoard, you currently need either
@{b}Dice@{ub} or @{b}gcc@{ub}. Edit the @{b}Makefile@{ub}, remove the comments from your compilers
switches and comment the others in. @{b}DMake@{ub} or @{b}Make@{ub}, respectively,  will
do the compilation for you.

   It shouldn't be a serious problem to use @{b}SAS/C@{ub}, as I tried to keep
the code compatible. However, I cannot test it, as I don't have this
compiler. (Gifts welcome. :-) By using a Unix compatible front end like
@{b}dev/c/cc.lha@{ub} from Aminet, you should even be able to use the same
@{b}Makefile@{ub}.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  This has the advantage that deinstalling AmyBoard is rather
easy: Just delete the @{b}AmyBoard@{ub} drawer.  However, you won't do this,
won't you? ;-)

Command options supported by AmyBoard.
**************************************

   On Unix it is usual behaviour to implement command options with names
like @{b}-v@{ub} (verbose) or @{b}-h@{ub} help. If a program like AmyBoard has lots of
possible options, it makes sense to drop these short option names and
instead use option names like @{b}-verbose@{ub} or @{b}-help@{ub}. This is almost like on
the Amiga where one would use @{b}verbose@{ub} or @{b}help@{ub}.

   To be both compatible to XBoard and have a real Amiga program I
decided to allow both: With AmyBoard you may use either @{b}-debug@{ub} or
@{b}debug@{ub}, whatever you want. Thus in the following words beginning
with a hyphen (-) are option names, but you may omit the hyphen.

   AmyBoard always runs in one of 4 possible modes:
@{b}amyboard [options]@{ub}
     starts AmyBoard as a GNU chess interface. As an interface to GNU
     Chess, AmyBoard lets you play a game against the machine, set up
     arbitrary positions, force variations, or watch a game between two
     machines.

@{b}amyboard -ics [options]@{ub}
     lets AmyBoard act as an interface to the Internet Chess Server
     (ICS). You can play against other ICS users, observe games they are
     playing, or review games that have recently finished. See @{"ICS" Link "ICS"}.

@{b}amyboard -ncp [options]@{ub}
     allows to use AmyBoard as a simple chessboard to play through
     games. It will read and write game files and allow you to play
     through variations manually. You can use it to browse games off the
     net or review GNU Chess, ICS, and correspondence games you have
     saved.  These features are available at all times; even if you do
     not have access to GNU Chess or the ICS, you can use them.

@{b}cmail@{ub}
     will use AmyBoard as an interface to electronic mail
     correspondence chess.  (This possibility is currently not given on
     the Amiga: @{b}cmail@{ub} is a @{b}Perl@{ub} script which assumes a full mail setup,
     both usually not given on the Amiga. Probably someone would be
     interested in converting @{b}cmail@{ub} into an @{b}ARexx@{ub} script?

   Most of the AmyBoard options have both a long name and a short name.
You have three possibilities to set the options:
  1. By editing the preferences file @{b}PROGDIR:lib/AmyBoard.prefs@{ub}, where
     @{b}PROGDIR:@{ub} indicates the directory of the AmyBoard binary. The lines
     of the file are interpreted as if they were toolkit options, empty
     lines or lines beginning with a semicolon are treated as comments.

  2. By editing an icons toolkit options.

  3. By supplying arguments with the CLI command line.

Of course toolkit options or CLI arguments override settings of the
prefs file.

   The argument parsing behaves in general much like ReadArgs(), except
for boolean arguments which are a mixture of the /S and /T switches: In
general, they behave like /S arguments in the CLI, but like /T in the
toolkit options or in the prefs file. To be precise, you may use
something like
         amyboard ncp

in the CLI (indicating that the value of ncp should be toggled), but not
as a toolkit option or as a prefs file entry: In that case you have to
explicitly state something like
         NCP true

(For obvious reasons this version conflicts with the above.) However,
you may always write
         NCP=false

As usual, option names are case-insensitive.

Controlling GNU Chess
=====================

-tc or -timeControl minutes[:seconds]
-mps or -movesPerSession moves
     Each player begins with the specified amount of time on his clock.
     If a player makes the specified number of moves before his clock
     runs out, AmyBoard adds the specified amount of time to his clock.
     Default: 40 moves in 5 minutes.

-st or -searchTime minutes[:seconds]
     Tells GNU Chess to spend at most the given amount of time
     searching for each of its moves. Without this option, GNU Chess
     chooses its search time based on the number of moves and amount of
     time remaining until the next time control.

-sd or -searchDepth number
     Tells GNU Chess to look ahead at most the given number of moves
     when searching for a move to make. Without this option, GNU Chess
     chooses its search depth based on the number of moves and amount
     of time remaining until the next time control.

-thinking or -showThinking
     If this option is set, GNU Chess's notion of the score and best
     line of play from the current position is displayed as it is
     thinking. The score indicates how many pawns ahead (or if nega-
     tive, behind) GNU Chess thinks it is. In matches between two
     machines, the score is prefixed by W or B to indicate whether it
     is showing White's thinking or Black's.

-mm or -matchMode
     Automatically runs a game between two chess programs.  If the
     @{b}loadGameFile@{ub} or @{b}loadPositionFile@{ub} option is set, AmyBoard starts
     the game with the given opening moves or the given position;
     otherwise, the game starts with the standard initial chess
     position.  If the @{b}saveGameFile@{ub} option is set, a move record for the
     match is appended to the specified file. If the @{b}savePositionFile@{ub}
     option is set, the final position reached in the match is appended
     to the specified file. When the match is over, AmyBoard exits.
     Default: false.

-fcp or -firstChessProgram program
     Name of first chess program.  In matches between two machines,
     this program plays Black. Default: @{b}gnuchessx@{ub}.

-scp or -secondChessProgram program
     Name of second chess program, if needed. In matches between two
     machines, this program plays White; otherwise it is not started.
     Default: @{b}gnuchessx@{ub}.

-initString string
     The string that is sent to initialize the chess program.  Default:
              new
              beep
              random
              easy

     Setting this option from the command line is tricky, because you
     must type in real newline characters. In most shells you can do
     this by entering a @{b}\\ @{ub} character followed by a newline. It is
     easier to set the option from your @{b}.Xdefaults@{ub} file; in that case
     you can include the character sequence @{b}\\n@{ub} in the string, and it
     will be converted to a newline.

     If you change this option, don't remove the @{b}new@{ub} and @{b}beep@{ub} commands.
     You can remove the @{b}random@{ub} command if you like; including it causes
     GNU Chess to randomize its move selection slightly so that it
     doesn't play the same moves in every game.  (Even without @{b}random@{ub},
     GNU Chess randomizes its choice of moves from its opening book.)
     You can also remove @{b}easy@{ub} if you like; including it toggles easy
     mode off, causing GNU Chess to think on your time. That is, if
     @{b}easy@{ub} is included in the initString, GNU Chess thinks on your
     time; if not, it does not. (Yes, this does seem backwards, doesn't
     it!) You can also try adding other commands to the initString; see
     the GNU Chess documentation for details.

-whiteString string
-blackString string
     These options control what is sent when the Machine White and
     Machine Black buttons are selected. This is mostly for compati-
     bility with obsolete versions of GNU Chess.

-childPriority
-childStack
     set the respective settings of the process to be created for GNU
     Chess.  Note, that the GNU Chess task requires a relatively big
     stack, compared to true Amiga programs: Do not use less than 50000
     bytes. By increasing GNU Chess's memory requirements you probably
     increase it's stack requirements too: Thus you might need to
     change the default of 100000 bytes.(1)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  It would have been possible to compile GNU Chess with dynamic
stack checking. However, this would give overhead with @{i}every@{ui} function
call and result in a drastical loss of playing strength, so I decided
not to use this feature.

Connecting to and using ICS
===========================

-ics or -internetChessServerMode
     Connect with an Internet Chess Server to play chess against its
     other users, observe games they are playing, or review games that
     have recently finished. Default: false.  To use AmyBoard in ICS
     mode, run it in the foreground, and use the terminal you started
     it from to type commands and receive text responses from the chess
     server.  See @{"ICS" Link "ICS"}. See @{"File Menu" Link "File Menu"}. See @{"Step Menu" Link "Step Menu"}.  See @{"Mode Menu" Link "Mode Menu"}.

-icslogon or -internetChessServerLogonScript file-name
     Whenever AmyBoard connects to the Internet Chess Server, if it
     finds a file with the name given in this option, it feeds the
     file's contents to the ICS as commands. The default file name is
     @{b}PROGDIR:lib/.icsrc@{ub}.  Usually the first two lines of the file
     should be your ICS user name and password.  The file name can be
     either absolute or relative to @{b}PROGDIR:@{ub} or @{b}ENV:@{ub}. Due to a problem
     which I did not figure out yet, it may be needed to add a empty
     line at the top of @{b}.icsrc@{ub}.

-autocomm or -autoComment
     If @{b}autoComment@{ub} is True, any remarks made on ICS while you are
     observing or playing a game are recorded as a comment on the
     current move.  This includes remarks made with the ICS commands
     @{b}say@{ub}, @{b}tell@{ub}, @{b}whisper@{ub}, and @{b}kibitz@{ub}.  Limitation: remarks that you
     type yourself are not recognized; AmyBoard scans only the output
     from ICS, not the input you type to it.  Default: False.

-autoflag or -autoCallFlag
     If @{b}autoCallFlag@{ub} is true and your opponent runs out of time before
     you do, AmyBoard will automatically call his flag, claiming a win
     on time (or a draw if you do not have mating material).  Default:
     false.

-autobs or -autoObserve
     If @{b}autoObserve@{ub} is true and you add a player to your @{b}gnotify@{ub} list
     on ICS, AmyBoard will automatically observe all of that player's
     games, unless you are doing something else (such as observing or
     playing a game of your own) when one starts.  Default: false.

-quiet or -quietPlay
     If this option is true, AmyBoard will automatically issue a
              set shout 0

     command whenever you start an ICS game and a
              set shout 1
     command whenever you finish one. Default: false.

-icshost or -internetChessServerHost host
     The Internet host name or address of the chess server to connect
     to when in ICS mode. Default: @{b}chess.lm.com@{ub}. See the file
     @{b}ics-addresses@{ub} in the AmyBoard distribution for a list of other
     addresses to try. See also the output of the command
              finger chess@ics.onenet.net

     If your site doesn't have a working Internet name server, try
     specifying the host address in numeric form. The address of
     @{b}chess.lm.com@{ub} is @{b}192.231.221.16@{ub}; that of @{b}ics.onenet.net@{ub} is
     164.58.253.10.

-icsport or -internetChessServerPort port-number
     The port number to use when connecting to a chess server in ICS
     mode. Default: 5000.

-telnetProgram prog-name
     This option gives the name of the telnet program to be used with
     the gateway and @{b}useTelnet@{ub} options.  The default is @{b}telnet@{ub}. The
     telnet program is invoked with the value of
     @{b}internetChessServerHost@{ub} as its first argument and the value of
     @{b}internetChessServerPort@{ub} as its second argument.

     Of course you are not forced to use a certain telnet program, in
     fact the only requirement is, that the program reads input from
     stdin and writes to stdout. For example, you might wish to use a
     terminal program, if you don't have a @{b}SLIP@{ub} or @{b}PPP@{ub} connection.  See
     @{"Serial ICS connection" Link "Serial ICS connection"}.

-icsWindow
     is a specification of a window to open for ICS input/output. This
     is especially useful, if you start AmyBoard from Workbench: The CLI
     window is used otherwise. Note that setting this option @{i}forces@{ui} a
     separate window, even if you start the program from the CLI.
     However, AmyBoard does not detach from the CLI (except when using
     @{b}Run >nil: <nil:@{ub}), thus you better set this option in the icon
     toolkits only.

Load and Save options
=====================

-lgf or -loadGameFile file
-lgi or -loadGameIndex index
     If the @{b}loadGameFile@{ub} option is set, AmyBoard loads the specified
     game file at startup. The file name @{b}-@{ub} specifies the standard
     input. If there is more than one game in the file, AmyBoard pops
     up a menu of the available games, with entries based on their PGN
     tags.  If the @{b}loadGameIndex@{ub} option is set to @{b}N@{ub}, the menu is
     suppressed and the N th game found in the file is loaded
     immediately.  The menu is also suppressed if @{b}matchMode@{ub} is enabled
     or if the game file is a pipe; in these cases the first game in
     the file is loaded immediately.

-td or -timeDelay seconds
     Time delay between moves during @{b}Load Game@{ub}. Fractional seconds are
     allowed; try @{b}-td 0.4@{ub}. A time delay value of -1 tells AmyBoard not
     to step through game files automatically. Default: 1 second.

-sgf or -saveGameFile file
     If this option is set, AmyBoard appends a record of every game
     played to the specified file. The file name @{b}-@{ub} specifies the
     standard output.

-autosave or -autoSaveGames
     If this option is true, at the end of every game AmyBoard prompts
     you for a file name and appends a record of the game to the file
     you specify. Ignored if @{b}saveGameFile@{ub} is set.

-lpf or -loadPositionFile file
-lpi or -loadPositionIndex index
     If the @{b}loadPositionFile@{ub} option is set, AmyBoard loads the
     specified position file at startup. The file name @{b}-@{ub} specifies the
     standard input. If the @{b}loadPositionIndex@{ub} option is set to N, the
     Nth position found in the file is loaded; otherwise the first
     position is loaded.

-spf or -savePositionFile file
     If this option is set, AmyBoard appends the final position reached
     in every game played to the specified file. The file name @{b}-@{ub}
     specifies the standard output.

-oldsave or -oldSaveStyle
     If this option is false (the default), AmyBoard saves games in PGN
     (portable game notation) and positions in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards
     notation).  If the option is true, a save style that is compatible
     with older versions of AmyBoard is used instead.

Look and Feel
=============

-bell or -ringBellAfterMoves
     If this option is true, AmyBoard alerts you by ringing the
     terminal bell after each of your opponent's moves (or after every
     move if you are observing a game on the Internet Chess Server).
     The bell is not rung after moves you make or moves read from a
     saved game file. Default: false.

     If you turn on this option when using AmyBoard with the Internet
     Chess Server, you will probably want to give the
              set bell 0

     command to the ICS, since otherwise the ICS will ring the bell
     itself after every move (not just yours). (The @{b}.icsrc@{ub} file is a
     good place for this, see @{"ICS options" Link "ICS options"})

-queen or -alwaysPromoteToQueen
     If this option is false (the default), AmyBoard brings up a dialog
     box whenever you move a pawn to the last rank, asking what piece
     you want to promote it to. If the option is true, your pawns are
     always promoted to queens. (Your opponent can still underpromote,
     however.)

-size or -boardSize (Huge | Large | Medium | Small | Tiny)
     Determines how large the board will be and what built-in piece
     bitmaps will be used. On a huge board (the default), pieces are
     80x80 pixels, on a large board 64x64 pixels, and on a medium board
     40x40 pixels. Small (44x22) and tiny (44x19) boards are for PAL
     and NTSC HighRes displays, respectively.

     Note, that you better adjust this by simply resizing the window
     and using the MUI prefs to fix a certain window size. That way you
     can determine the windows size and position and not only the
     chessboards resolution.

-coords or -showCoords
     If this option is true, AmyBoard displays algebraic coordinates
     along the board's left and bottom edges. The default is false.
     MUI's tiny font, which you can select with the MUI prefs, will be
     used.

-flip or -flipView
     If you are playing a game on the ICS, the board is always oriented
     at the start of the game so that your pawns move from the bottom
     of the window towards the top. Otherwise, the starting is
     determined by the flipView option; if it is false (the default),
     White's pawns move from bottom to top at the start of each game;
     if it is true, Black's pawns move from bottom to top.

-bm or -bitmapDirectory
     By default, AmyBoard uses a set of compiled-in bitmaps for its
     pieces. If the @{b}bitmapDirectory@{ub} option is set at runtime, piece
     bitmaps are taken from files in the specified directory instead.
     The first character of a bitmap name gives the piece it represents
     (p, n, b, r, q, or k); the next characters give the size in pixels
     (80, 64, or 40), and the following character indicates whether the
     piece is solid or outline (s or o). Bitmap file names have the
     extension @{b}.bm@{ub}. The outline bitmaps are used only in monochrome
     mode.

     Two sets of bitmaps are distributed with AmyBoard. Those in the
     directory @{b}bitmaps@{ub} are normally compiled in as the default.  Those
     in the @{b}bitmaps.xchess@{ub} directory can be selected at runtime with
     the @{b}bitmapDirectory@{ub} option. If you want to compile in the latter
     set as the default, rename the @{b}bitmaps@{ub} directory to @{b}bitmaps.fselch@{ub}
     and the @{b}bitmaps.xchess@{ub} directory to @{b}bitmaps@{ub}; then recompile
     AmyBoard.

-wpp or -whitePiecePen
-bpp or -blackPiecePen
-lsp or -lightSquareColor
-dsp or -darkSquareColor
     Pen specifications, defaults are -1, in which case MUI's @{b}Shine-@{ub},
     @{b}Shadow-@{ub}, @{b}Halfshine-@{ub} and @{b}Halfshadowpen@{ub}, respectively, will be used.
     Thus you'd better use the MUI prefs to fix these settings.

-ncp or -noChessProgram
     If this option is true, AmyBoard acts as a passive chessboard; it

Accessing external games and positions
======================================

Reset
     Resets AmyBoard and GNU Chess to the beginning of a new chess
     game. The r key is a keyboard equivalent. In Internet Chess Server
     mode, clears the current state of AmyBoard, then resynchronizes
     with ICS by sending a refresh command. If you want to stop
     playing, observing, or examining a game on ICS, use an appropriate
     command from the Action menu, not @{b}Reset@{ub}. See @{"Action Menu" Link "Action Menu"}.

Load Game
     Plays a game from a record file. The g key is a keyboard
     equivalent.  An ASL requester prompts you for the file name. If
     the file contains more than one game, a window displays a list of
     games (with information drawn from their PGN tags, if any), and
     you can select the one you want. Alternatively, you can load the
     Nth game in the file directly, by typing the number @{b}N@{ub} after the
     file name, separated by the , character.

     The game file parser will accept PGN (portable game notation), or
     in fact almost any file that contains moves in algebraic notation.
     If the file includes a PGN position (FEN tag), or an AmyBoard
     position diagram bracketed by @{b}[-@{ub} and @{b}-]@{ub} before the first move, the
     game starts from that position. Text enclosed in parentheses,
     square brackets, or curly braces is assumed to be commentary and
     is displayed in a pop-up window. Any other text in the file is
     ignored. PGN variations (enclosed in parentheses) are treated as
     comments; AmyBoard is not able to walk variation trees.

Load Next Game
     Loads the next game from the last game record file you loaded.
     The shifted N key is a keyboard equivalent.  Not available if the
     last game was loaded from a pipe.

Load Previous Game
     Loads the previous game from the last game record file you loaded.
     The shifted P key is a keyboard equivalent.  Not available if the
     last game was loaded from a pipe.

Reload Same Game
     Reloads the last game you loaded.

Load Position
     Sets up a position from a position file.  A popup dialog prompts
     you for the file name. If the file contains more than one saved
     position, and you want to load the Nth one, type the number N
     after the file name, separated by a space. Position files must be
     in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation), or in the format that the Save
     Position command writes when oldSaveStyle is turned on.

Save Game
     Appends a record of the current game to a file.  An ASL requester
     prompts you for the file name. If the game did not begin with the
     standard starting position, the game file includes the starting
     position used. Games are saved in the PGN (portable game notation)
     format, unless the oldSaveStyle option is true, in which case they
     are saved in an older format that is specific to AmyBoard. Both
     formats are human-readable, and both can be read back by the @{b}Load
     Game@{ub} command.

Save Position
     Appends a diagram of the current position to a file.  An ASL
     requester prompts you for the file name. Positions are saved in
     FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation) format unless the @{b}oldSaveStyle@{ub}
     option is true, in which case they are saved in an older,
     human-readable format that is specific to AmyBoard. Both formats
     can be read back by the @{b}Load Position@{ub} command.

Selecting AmyBoard's mode
=========================

Machine White
     Forces GNU Chess to play White. GNU Chess mode only.

Machine Black
     Forces GNU Chess to play Black. GNU Chess mode only.

Two Machines
     Plays a game between two computer programs. GNU Chess mode only.

ICS Client
     ICS mode only. Takes AmyBoard out of the Edit Game or Edit
     Position state.

     While you are examining a game on the ICS, you can issue the ICS
     position-editing commands with the mouse. (Do this with @{b}ICS Client@{ub}
     selected on the Mode menu, not @{b}Edit Position@{ub}; the latter edits
     only your local copy of the position.)

     To drop a new piece on a square, press the left mouse button on the
     square, while holding down the Shift key. This brings up a menu of
     white and black pieces.  Additional menu choices let you empty the
     square or clear the board.  You cannot set the side to play or
     drag pieces to arbitrary squares while examining on ICS, however;
     the ICS permits only legal moves in this mode.

Edit Game
     Allows you to make moves for both Black and White, and to change
     moves after backing up with the @{b}Backward@{ub} command. The clocks do
     not run.

     In GNU Chess mode, GNU chess continues to check moves for legality
     but does not participate in the game. You can bring GNU Chess back
     into the game by selecting @{b}Machine White@{ub}, @{b}Machine Black@{ub}, or @{b}Two
     Machines@{ub}.

     In ICS mode, the moves are not sent to the ICS: @{b}Edit Game@{ub} takes
     AmyBoard out of ICS Client mode and lets you edit games locally.
     f you want to edit games on ICS in a way that other ICS users can
     see, use the ICS examine command or start an ICS match against
     yourself.

Edit Position
     Lets you set up an arbitrary board position.  Use the left mouse
     button to drag pieces to new squares, or to delete a piece by
     dragging it off the board or dragging an empty square on top of
     it. To drop a new piece on a square, press the left mouse button
     while holding down the shift key. This brings up a menu of white
     and black pieces. Additional menu choices let you empty the
     square, clear the board or set the side to play next.  Selecting
     @{b}Edit Position@{ub} causes AmyBoard to discard all remembered moves in
     the current game.

     In ICS mode, changes made to the position by @{b}Edit Position@{ub} are not
     sent to the ICS: @{b}Edit Position@{ub} takes AmyBoard out of @{b}ICS Client@{ub}
     mode and lets you edit positions locally. If you want to edit
     positions on ICS in a way that other ICS users can see, use the
     @{b}ICS examine@{ub} command, or start an ICS match against yourself.  (See
     also the ICS Client topic above.)

Show Game List
     Shows or hides the list of games generated by the last @{b}Load Game@{ub}
     command.

Edit Tags
     Lets you edit the @{b}PGN@{ub} (portable game notation) tags for the
     current game. After editing, the tags must still conform to the
     PGN tag syntax:
              <tag-section> ::= <tag-pair> <tag-section>
          		      <empty>
              <tag-pair> ::= [ <tag-name> <tag-value> ]
              <tag-name> ::= <identifier>
              <tag-value> ::= <string>

     See the PGN Standard for full details. Here is an example:
              [Event "Portoroz Interzonal"]
              [Site "Portoroz, Yugoslavia"]
              [Date "1958.08.16"]
              [Round "8"]
              [White "Robert J. Fischer"]
              [Black "Bent Larsen"]
              [Result "1-0"]

     Any characters that do not match this syntax are silently ignored.
     Note that the PGN standard requires all games to have at least the
     seven tags shown above. Any that you omit will be filled in by
     AmyBoard with @{b}?@{ub} (unknown value), or @{b}-@{ub} (inapplicable value).

Edit Comment
     Adds or modifies a comment on the current position. Comments are
     saved by @{b}Save Game@{ub} and are displayed by @{b}Load Game@{ub}, @{b}Forward@{ub}, and
     @{b}Backward@{ub}.

Pause
     Pauses updates to the board, and if you are playing against GNU
     Chess, also pauses your clock. To continue, select @{b}Pause@{ub} again,
     and the display will automatically update to the latest position.
     The P button and keyboard p key are equivalents.

     If you select Pause when you are playing against GNU Chess and it
     is not your move, GNU Chess's clock will continue to run and it
     will eventually make a move, at which point both clocks will stop.
     Since board updates are paused, however, you will not see the move
     until you exit from Pause mode (or select Forward).  This behavior
     is meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

     If you select Pause while you are in @{b}examine@{ub} mode on ICS, you can
     step backward and forward in the current history of the examined
     game without affecting the other observers and examiners. Select
     Pause again to reconnect yourself to the current state of the game
     on ICS.

     If you select @{b}Pause@{ub} while you are loading a game, the game stops
     loading. You can load more moves manually by selecting @{b}Forward@{ub}, or
     resume automatic loading by selecting @{b}Pause@{ub} again.

Talking to GNU chess or ICS opponents
=====================================

Accept
     Accepts a pending match offer. If there is more than one offer
     pending, you will have to type in a more specific command instead
     of using this menu choice. (ICS mode only)

Decline
     Declines a pending offer (match, draw, adjourn, etc.). If there is
     more than one offer pending, you will have to type in a more
     specific command instead of using this menu choice. (ICS mode only)

Call Flag
     Calls your opponent's flag, claiming a win on time, or claiming a
     draw if you are both out of time. You can also call your
     opponent's flag by clicking on his clock or by pressing the
     keyboard t key.

Draw
     Offers a draw to your opponent, accepts a pending draw offer from
     your opponent, or claims a draw by repetition or the 50-move rule,
     as appropriate. The d key is a keyboard equivalent.  (Not
     available in GNU Chess mode.)

Adjourn
     Asks your opponent to agree to adjourning the current game, or
     agrees to a pending adjournment offer from your opponent. (ICS
     mode only)

Abort
     Asks your opponent to agree to aborting the current game, or
     agrees to a pending abort offer from your opponent. An aborted
     game ends immediately without affecting either player's rating.

Resign
     Resigns the game to your opponent. The shifted R key is a keyboard
     equivalent.

Stop Observing
     Ends your participation in observing a game, by issuing the ICS
     observe command with no arguments. (ICS mode only)

Stop Examining
     Ends your participation in examining a game, by issuing the ICS
     unexamine command. (ICS mode only)

Controlling the game
====================

Backward
     Steps backward through a series of remembered moves.  The [<]
     button and the "b" key are equivalents.

     In most modes, @{b}Backward@{ub} only lets you look back at old positions;
     it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are playing
     against GNU Chess, playing or observing a game on the ICS, or
     loading a game.  If you select @{b}Backward@{ub} in any of these
     situations, you will not be allowed to make a different move. Use
     @{b}Retract Move@{ub} or @{b}Edit Game@{ub} if you want to change past moves.

     If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @{b}Backward@{ub}
     depends on whether AmyBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
     off, @{b}Backward@{ub} issues the ICS backward command, which backs up
     everyone's view of the game and allows you to make a different
     move. If Pause mode is on, @{b}Backward@{ub} only backs up your local view.

Forward
     Steps forward through a series of remembered moves (undoing the
     effect of @{b}Backward@{ub}) or forward through a game file. The [>] button
     and the f key are equivalents.

     If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of Forward
     depends on whether AmyBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
     off, @{b}Forward@{ub} issues the ICS forward command, which moves
     everyone's view of the game forward along the current line. If
     Pause mode is on, @{b}Forward@{ub} only moves your local view forward, and
     it will not go past the position that the game was in when you
     paused.

Back to Start
     Jumps backward to the first remembered position in the game.  The
     [<<] button and the shifted B key are equivalents.

     In most modes, Back to Start only lets you look back at old
     positions; it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are
     playing against GNU chess, playing or observing a game on the ICS,
     or loading a game. If you select @{b}Back to Start@{ub} in any of these
     situations, you will not be allowed to make different moves. Use
     @{b}Retract Move@{ub} or @{b}Edit Game@{ub} if you want to change past moves; or use
     Reset to start a new game.

     If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @{b}Back to Start@{ub}
     depends on whether AmyBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
     off, @{b}Back to Start@{ub} issues the ICS @{b}backward 999999@{ub} command, which
     backs up everyone's view of the game to the start and allows you
     to make different moves. If Pause mode is on, @{b}Back to Start@{ub} only
     backs up your local view.

Forward to End
     Jumps forward to the last remembered position in the game. The
     [>>] button and the shifted F key are equivalents.

     If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @{b}Forward to End@{ub}
     depends on whether AmyBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
     off, @{b}Forward to End@{ub} issues the ICS @{b}forward 999999@{ub} command, which
     moves everyone's view of the game forward to the end of the
     current line. If Pause mode is on, @{b}Forward to End@{ub} only moves your
     local view forward, and it will not go past the position that the
     game was in when you paused.

Revert
     If you are examining a game on ICS and Pause mode is off, issues
     the ICS command @{b}revert@{ub}.

Truncate Game
     Discards all remembered moves of the game beyond the current
     position. Puts AmyBoard into @{b}Edit Game@{ub} mode if it was not there
     already.

Move Now
     Forces GNU Chess to move immediately. (GNU Chess mode only)

Retract Move
     Retracts your last move. In GNU Chess mode, you can do this only
     after GNU Chess has replied to your move; if GNU Chess is still
     thinking, use @{b}Move Now@{ub} first. In ICS mode, @{b}Retract Move@{ub} issues the
     command @{b}takeback 1@{ub} or @{b}takeback 2@{ub} depending on whether it is your
     opponent's move or yours.

Using AmyBoard as an ICS client
*******************************

   What is this ICS thing, you probably ask? @{i}ICS@{ui} (Internet chess server,
also known as @{i}ICC@{ui}, Internet chess club, which is the commercial
version) is an internet service very similar to irc: People use a client
program like AmyBoard to connect to a server program on a remote host,
the so-called server. There they meet to play chess, watch other
people's games or just chat: In fact, the atmoshpere is full of virtual
shouts, much like a usual chess club.

   ICS is getting more and more important for chess players: Currently
(March 1995) there are some thousand registered users on the different
ICS hosts and it is not unusual to meet 200-300 of them on ICC in the
evening hours. The number is increasing rapidly.

   Usually you are using @{b}telnet@{ub} (1) to connect to the chess server.
(N{No Value For "AME"} does this for you.) However, @{b}telnet@{ub} assumes a
@{b}SLIP@{ub} or @{b}PPP@{ub} connection or something similar to the Internet. AmyBoard
is not bound to this, however: You can replace @{b}telnet@{ub} by any program
reading from stdin and writing to stdout, for example a simple terminal
program.


 @{" Serial ICS connection " Link "Serial ICS connection"}    Using a terminal program to connect to ICS.

   When using AmyBoard as an ICS client, the program seems to be split
into two parts: The first one is the chessboard, as usual. Additionally
you are using the terminal window as a possibility to type in commands
and read information not available on the chessboard.

   The first time you are using the terminal is to enter your login name
and password, if you are a registered player. (You don't need to do
this manually, the @{b}icsLogon@{ub} option may do this for you.  see
@{"ICS options" Link "ICS options"}) If not, enter any name.  If someone has already registered
under that name, you'll be asked for a password; just hit return and
try again.

   You may use the terminal window to enter commands. Useful ICS
commands include
@{b}help <topic>@{ub}
     to get help on the given <topic>. (To get a list of possible
     topics type @{i}help@{ui} without topic.) Obviously this is a very
     important command for new users. :-) It is recommended netiquette
     to use it before asking other people.

     For example @{b}help register@{ub} tells you how to become a registered ICS
     player.

@{b}who <flags>@{ub}
     to see a list of people displayed who are are logged on.
     Administrators (people you should ask first, if you have something
     to ask) are marked with the character *, an asterisk. The <flags>
     allow you to display only selected players: For example, @{b}who of@{ub}
     shows a list of players which are interested in playing, but do
     not have an opponent.

@{b}games@{ub}
     to see what games are being played

@{b}match <player> [<mins>] [<inc>]@{ub}
     to challenge another player to a game. Both opponents get <mins>
     minutes for the game, <inc> seconds will be added after each move.
     If another player challenges you, the server asks, if you want to
     accept the challenge: Use the @{b}accept@{ub} or @{b}decline@{ub} commands to answer.

@{b}accept@{ub}
@{b}decline@{ub}
     to accept or decline another players offer; this is both used to
     start a game (if the player challenges you) or to terminate the
     game, for example, if your opponent offers you a @{b}draw@{ub}, to @{b}adjourn@{ub}
     or @{b}abort@{ub} the game. See @{"Action Menu" Link "Action Menu"}.

     If you have more than one pending offer (for example, if more than
     one player is challenging you, or if your opponent offers both a
     draw and to adjourn the game), you have to supply additional
     information, either by typing something like @{b}accept <player>@{ub},
     @{b}accept draw@{ub} or using a command like

@{b}draw@{ub}
@{b}adjourn@{ub}
@{b}abort@{ub}
     offers your opponent to terminate a game by mutual agreement.
     (Adjourned games may be continued later.) The server asks your
     opponent, so he can either @{b}decline@{ub} your offer or accept it by
     typing the same command or @{b}accept@{ub}. (Your opponent won't be asked,
     of course, if he lacks material to win, for example.)

@{b}finger <player>@{ub}
     to get informations about the given <player>. (Default: yourself.)

@{b}vars@{ub}
     to get a list of personal settings

@{b}set <var> <value>@{ub}
     to modify these settings

@{b}observe <player>@{ub}
     to observe an ongoing game of the given <player>.

@{b}examine@{ub}
@{b}oldmoves@{ub}
     to review a recently completed game

   Whenever you ask to observe an ongoing game, review a completed game,
or resume an adjourned game, AmyBoard retrieves and parses the list of
past moves from the ICS, so you can review them with the @{b}Forward@{ub} and
@{b}Backward@{ub} commands or save them with @{b}Save Game@{ub}.  Some special AmyBoard
features are activated when you are in examine mode on ICS.

Using a terminal program to connect to ICS.
-------------------------------------------

   As already mentioned, you may connect to the ICS with any terminal
program, provided that it can read from stdin and write to stdout.  An
example (which is well suuported by the installation script) is @{b}IPDial@{ub},
which you find in the @{b}comm/tcp@{ub} directory on Aminet. However, you need to
connect to a host with Internet access which will act as a gateway to
the ICS server.

   Usually you do the following:
   @{b}*@{ub} Create a login script for your terminal program that allows to
     login to your remote host. Probably you add a line like
              SEND "telnet chess.lm.com 5000"

     to the login script: This would make the remote host to create a
     connection to the ICS server chess.lm.com (ICC) as the very first
     command to execute. The installation script can create such a
     login script for you, to be used by @{b}IPDial@{ub}
     (@{b}PROGDIR:lib/IcsLogin.IPDial@{ub}, where @{b}PROGDIR:@{ub} is the directory
     of the AmyBoard binary). However, you need to edit it manually,
     insert your remote hosts phone number, your login name and
     password, for example.

   @{b}*@{ub} Create an icon that calls your terminal program like it would do
     with telnet; the installation script can do this for you.

Known limitations
*****************

   There is no way for two people running copies of AmyBoard to play
each other without going through the @{b}Internet Chess Server@{ub}.

   The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.

   The internal move legality tester does not look at the game history,
so in some cases it misses illegal castling or en passant captures.
However, if you attempt such a move when using GNU Chess (or the ICS),
it will reject the move, and AmyBoard will undo it and let you try
another. Also FEN positions saved by AmyBoard do not include correct
information about whether castling or en passant are legal.

   In ICS mode AmyBoard cannot handle observing (and/or playing) more
than one game at a time. It may get confused if you try to do this,
thought it tries to recover gracefully. Select @{b}Reset@{ub} from the @{b}File@{ub}
menu, if you have problems. See @{"File Menu" Link "File Menu"}.

   Your password may get echoed when you log on to the ICS.

   If you are connecting to the ICS by running telnet on an Internet
provider or firewall host, you may find that each line you type is
echoed back an extra time after you hit Return. If your Internet
provider is a Unix system, you can probably turn its echo off by typing
         stty -echo
   after you log in, and/or by typing ^E-Return (control-E followed by
the Return key) to the telnet program after you have logged into ICS.
It is a good idea to do this if you can, because the extra echo can
occasionally confuse AmyBoard's parsing routines.

   The @{b}.icsrc@{ub} file does not work properly when you connect to ICS
through a Unix gateway host with @{b}useTelnet@{ub} mode.  The Unix login
process apparently discards type-ahead. See @{"ICS options" Link "ICS options"}.  Due to a
problemm which I did not figure out yet, it might be needed to add an
empty line to the top of the @{b}.icsrc@{ub} file.

   Some AmyBoard functions may not work with versions of GNU Chess
earlier than 4.0, patchlevel 73.

What you should keep in mind
****************************

   @{b}*@{ub} The most common problem is, that people don't see the pieces, after
     they have started AmyBoard the first time. The reason is simple:
     Their color settings in the MUI prefs don't fit AmyBoard's
     requirements.  To fix this problem you have two possibilities
       1. Use the MUI prefs to fix appropriate colors for AmyBoard; the
          program uses MUI's @{i}Shinepen@{ui}, @{i}Shadowpen@{ui}, @{i}Halfshinepen@{ui} and
          @{i}Halfshadowpen@{ui}. Be sure, that these are all different.

       2. Enter pen settings in the prefs file of AmyBoard (usually
          @{b}PROGDIR:lib/AmyBoard.prefs@{ub}) manually.

   @{b}*@{ub} Another common problem are strange crashes, especially in ICS mode.
     This can happen, if your stack is too low: A value of 10000 should
     be sufficient, but the CLI default value of 4096 definitely isn't.
     Note, that Toolmanager uses the same value by default: You must
     increase it in the @{b}Exec object@{ub}, if you want to start AmyBoard from
     Toolmanager.
