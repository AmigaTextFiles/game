This material was submitted to me on disk directly by the author, Gary
Teachout, for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Gary!

P.S.  He did a nice job with the submission, placing everything in separate
directories with icons for the doc files, just like my standard format.
This is a real time saver for me because I can just plop the directories
down onto one of my standard disks with little change.
