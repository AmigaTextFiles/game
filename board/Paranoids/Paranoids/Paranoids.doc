   Paranoids is a traditional board game played by drawing cards, rolling
dice and moving pieces around the board. Each player has six pieces four
patients and two doctors. The object of the game is to get all of your
patients out of the asylum. Your doctors are for protecting your patients
and making trouble for your opponents pieces. The agressive stratigies that
work for many other board games don't work as well as cautious stratigies.
