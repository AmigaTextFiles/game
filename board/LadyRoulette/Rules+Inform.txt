First menu:

 'option' access to sub-menu to choose sounds and game mode, that is:

  REAL  > the extraction of numbers will happen by a 'real' turning wheel,
          with all numbers in succession, random force applied on spin and
          the real wheel's speed fading

  SIMUL > this is a 'fake' extraction, because numbers pop out immediately
          by random extraction

  CHEAT > this is a testing mode, but you know password to have it!
          (Notice that only works with single numbers extractions!)

 Then choose play to go to the 'green carpet' and begin to play roulette!

During play:
------------

 by pressing RMB; when your choice is done, the view return automatically
 to the top.
 Now press LMB on the little wheel that appears to launch the ball!
 Previously, you can choose your 'bet categories' by pressing 'numbers'
 button, to experience between seven possibilities:

  INDIVIDUAL > the bet is on one only straight number, otherwise is on a
               multi-purpose boxes, like 'pair', or 'passe', etc..

  VERTICAL DOUBLE > two vertical close numbers (i.e. 0 and 1, 1 and4,
                    16 and 19, etc..

  HORIZONTAL DOUBLE > two horizontal close numbers (i.e. 1 and 2, 7 and 10,
                      35 and 36, etc..

  SQUARE MULTIPLE > four adiacent numbers. (i.e. 1 and 2 and 4 and 5 in
                    square form)

  ZERO TRIPLE > only two combination by three numbers with zero: 0and 1
                and 2 or 0 and 2 and 3

  HORIZONTAL TRIPLE > three horizontal numbers like 1 and 2 and 3, or
                      22 and 23 and 24..

  VERTICAL MULTIPLE > four numbers in vertical, belonging to the relative
                      dozen box (i.e. 1 and 4 and 7 and 10, or 14 and 17
                      and 20 and 23, etc..)

 Before placing a bet, add money to spend by 50$ at time, by relative
 buttons (if 'monte' is enough!)
 Instead of play by one turn at time, you can add two or three rounds more
 (three is the maximum), but the relative reward it divided by number of
 rounds, and moreover it costs an addicted fair money penalty.
