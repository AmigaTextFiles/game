This distribution contains the source code to CBASCII (version 1.3c) and
other ChessBase utilities I have been working on.  I have now placed the
source code into the public domain and hope that someone will continue
to develop and maintain the utilities, as I have no time to do so.  You
will find the binaries in the distribution CBU_BIN.ZIP.

The source code was developed using MSC V7 and MASM V6, though I have also
compiled the code under SunOS 4.1.1 so it is reasonably portable.  The
main use of the assembler was to provide an EMS-access system, called
"MemPage", that allowed me to access memory on the PC beyond 640KB.  I have
provided C-source equilalents to all assembler functions for systems that
provide virtual memory.  The MemPage system is only used in CBSORT, and
could easily be extended to access XMS memory.

To compile under UNIX:

Unpack the distribution and copy the DOS <-> UNIX shell scripts "misc/dos2unix"
and "misc/unix2dos" into a directory in your $PATH, then "chmod 0755" them.
Now convert all the source files from DOS to UNIX:

	cd cbu_src
	sh misc/tounix

Makefiles are included for SunOS 4 and SCO UNIX and these can be copied from
the "mkfiles" sub-directory in bin and lib (and in the root directory).  If
you are compiling on another flavour of UNIX then copy the sunos4 (for BSD-
like system) or sco (for SysV-like system) and then edit lib/machine.h to
setup the defines for that flavour.

Mail me if you have problems...
