GETTING STARTED ON IOS
 
       In this document, I've used ``quotation marks'' to set apart the 
       names of commands. Please don't type the quotation marks when 
       using the commands.
 
       This is a quick, five-minute course on how to use the Internet 
       Othello Server. It's not meant to replace the normal IOS help 
       system, which can give you complete details and syntax for any 
       command. To use that system, type ``help'' for a complete list of 
       commands, or ``help {name of command}'' for information about any 
       specific command. There are a lot of tricks and functions which 
       won't be covered here but which you'll want to learn as you become
       familiar with IOS.
 
1. What is IOS?
              The Internet Othello Server, located at the University of 
       Paderborn, Germany, is a computer which allows Othello / reversi 
       players to play against each other, observe others' games, or 
       simply chat.
 
2. Logging on
              You've probably logged onto IOS as an unregistered user. 
       Once you've registered, a password will be required for anyone to 
       log on under your special username. That prevents someone else from
       playing under your name and ruining your rating! Type ``help register'' 
       for complete information.
 
3. Who else is here?
              There are several different commands for figuring out who 
       else is logged onto the server.
       * The command ``who'' gives you a complete list of the users 
       logged in. If you use the ``who'' column and look under the column 
       marked ``G,'' you may see game numbers next to some of the 
       players' names. If ant+ and jcarney+ each have the number ``2'' in 
       the G column, that means those two players are currently playing 
       game number 2.
       * The command ``players'' is similar to ``who'' but only shows you 
       the users who are available to play. This chart will ususally be 
       shorter than the ``who'' chart, since it won't include players in 
       the middle of a game or those who have specifically made 
       themselves unavailable.
       * The command ``games'' will list the games currently being 
       played, showing you who is active.
 
4. Are these computer programs or real people?
              Good question -- and one that's not always easy to answer. 
       If you become a regular IOS user, you'll learn to recognize many 
       of the usernames and you'll know whether they're human or
       computers.
              You can use the ``finger'' command to call up information 
       about a player, and that listing will sometimes (but not always) 
       tell you the player's real name or mention that it is a computer 
       program. Type ``finger ant+'' and you'll see that ant+ is a
       computer program; type ``finger jcarney'' and you'll see that he's 
       John Carney, a real live human. But not every listing includes a 
       name or description.
              You can also try talking to a player, using the ``tell'' 
       command: ``tell {name of user} Hi. Would you like to play a 
       game?''  Humans will often respond; computer programs usually 
       won't. If a human player doesn't respond, it may because the
       message scrolled off his or her screen before he or she noticed 
       it. Or the player may have the type of Internet connection which 
       allows him or her to stay logged into IOS for long periods of 
       time, in which case he or she may not be paying attention to the 
       computer at the moment.
 
5. How do I play a game?
              If you want to play a human opponent, you may want to 
       strike up a conversation first, using the ``tell'' command. But 
       when you're ready to start a game, with either a human or a 
       computer program, type ``match {name of user}'' to challenge that 
       user. This will send a message from you offering a match. The
       other user can accept, decline or just ignore your message.
              If someone offers you a game, you'll see a message 
       including the words ``match from'' pop up on your screen. Simply 
       type ``accept {name of user}'' if you agree to play, or ``decline 
       {name of user}'' if you don't.
              The default game on IOS allows each player 15 minutes for 
       all of his or her moves. You can specify a different time if you 
       like; type ``help match'' for details.
 
6. How do I watch someone else's game?
              Find the game number through the ``who'' or the ``games'' 
       chart, and then type ``observe {game number}''.  You can find out
       who else is watching the game with the ``whoobs {game number}'' 
       command.
              You can talk to other observers and/or players, but be 
       courteous. The ``kib {game number}'' command sends a message which 
       can be seen by players and by other observers. But if you're 
       watching a serious match, you're better off using ``whisp {game 
       number}'' to send your message only to the other observers. That 
       way you don't distract or unfairly help a player.
 
7. What next?
              If you think you'll be stopping by in the future, you'll 
       probably want to register, which gives you the right to maintain a
       rating. With a rating, you can see how you compare to other 
       players -- that's helpful when looking for opponents in your 
       general skill level.  (Don't be afraid to play stronger players, 
       though -- that's how you improve.)
              Registered players can also have transcripts of their games 
       mailed to them automatically -- a great way to help you study your 
       play and improve your skills.
              Type ``help register'' for details on how to register. 
       Please follow the directions carefully!
 
              You'll probably want to check out one of the ``client'' 
       programs available for various computers and operating systems. A
       client program replaces the Xs and Os of the basic IOS display 
       with a stable, attractive graphic screen. Since your game board 
       isn't constantly scrolling off the screen, you're less likely to 
       miss messages from other players.
              A client program also lets you use what's called ``trust 
       mode,'' in which your moves are timed by your own computer, rather 
       than by IOS. That way, you aren't penalized when the Internet 
       suffers from ``lag,'' a condition that slows down communication 
       between your computer and IOS.
              Type ``help clients'' for more information about client 
       programs.

              Also, be sure and check out the regular IOS tournaments, 
       held on the first Saturday of each month. Start times are changed 
       from month to month in fairness to players from various time zones 
       around the world. Some tournaments allow only human players; 
       others allow both humans and computer programs.
 
              So, welcome to IOS -- and have fun!
