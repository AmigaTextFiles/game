I. Introduction

  Welcome  to  Adrasthello!   Adrasthello  is  a  graphical  client for the
internet  othello  server  paderborn.   Because  one  has  only a textbased
in/output,  and  because  there  already  is a client for several operating
systems  except  the  Amiga  OS  available, I decided to code such a client
myself.   The client never got really finished, but I decided to publish it
now,  because  its  more  or  less useable, and I don't know if I will ever
finish  it.   Also  there  is no computer opponent available if you play it
offline.

II. Using the client

  On  the one hand you can use Adrasthello offline to snoop in, take a look
at the possible statistics and so on.  Also you can play it with a partner.
  On the other hand you can use it as client.  This means, graphical output
of the board, play by mouse.  You have advantages like to show the possible
moves,  which  you  don't  have in the text version.  Parallel to the board
there  is running a simple terminal program.  There are no special settings
in IOS itself necessary to use the client instead of telnet or terminal.

III. Explanation of the shell parameters

  You can show all possible parameters with 'Adrasthello ?' from CLI.

CLIENT ... This keyword means that you want to use Adrasthello as client.

DEVICE ... serial.device if you want to play it with a terminal connection;
if you want to use it by tcp connection, you have to use telser.device or
a different serial.device tcp-emulation. You can find such a tool in the
AmiNet.

UNIT ... default 0.

BAUD ... baudrate, like 19200.

ECHO ... Turns on local echo in the client mode's terminal program.

LF ... sends LF instead of CR&LF. Useful if you have problems logging or
have problems with empty lines.

IV. Explanation of the menu functions.

Only in German documentation.

V. Copyright
