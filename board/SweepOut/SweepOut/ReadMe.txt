Welcome to SweepOut, the online, competitive MineSweeper.

Minesweeper has never been so much fun.


Requirement:

-a TCP/IP stack. This is mandatory, this game can't be played solo/offline.
-Since it needs a TCP/IP stack, you need some extra ram (the game itself needs around
350 to 650 KB (OCS / AGA)).
-Maybe a fast processor? It's done with Amos, and I did it on 060@80, so I have no idea
how it runs on slow CPU.


Getting started:

First, you need to create an account to play, with a name and a password. Write down
this password since at the date of the release, you won't be able to retrieve it if you
forget it. Your account will be lost forever.

Please don't create multiple accounts. It doesn't offer any interest anyway.


Gameplay:

This is a Minesweeper, should I explain it? Your goal is to mark all bombs. When you left
click on a case, you see the amount of bombs around this case, from 0 to 8. With all those
numbers, you have to guess where the bombs are, and secure them with right click 
(Amiga checkmark!). Once all bombs are marked and all cases are opened, the game
switches to the next level.


Scoring:

This is where SweepOut is different from any other minesweeper. On top of your screen
you can see a "bonus multiplier" bar. This bonus grows when you finish a level, and shrinks
when you left click on a bomb. Higher you keep this bonus, more scoring you do! So take
your time and make no mistake.

Keep in mind time consumes your bonus, and the level also affect it a lot!

The game ends when this bonus reach 0 (gameover).


Game Over:

When the game ends, you can do many things with your score:
-You can update your old one if the new one is better.
-You can also sacrifice your score to "blast" the top player! So if the top score is too
hard for you to beat... just destroy it !!!

This online factor gives a great interest boost!

Minesweeper has never been so much fun!
