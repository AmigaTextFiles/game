The program PIECE is as much primitive as possible. I didn't want to spend a
second more making it than what was necessary.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE USE OF THE PROGRAM 'PIECE' IS ASSUMED BY THE USER.

I included the source in Amiga E 2.1b as the best documentation. ;-)

The purpose of this program is to convert a 48x20 IFF brush to two ASCII files 
placed in RAM: under names "output1" and "output2". They will be ready to be 
included into the file "chess.pieces".

This program works with brushes included in this archive. If it doesn't work 
with your brushes, have a look at mine and help yourself. ;-)

THE PROGRAM 'PIECE' AND ITS SOURCE CODE ARE IN PUBLIC DOMAIN. I CLAIM NO 
COPYRIGHT.

(It would be a shame if I did... on such a piece of @#$%)
