There are still not many choices if you want to use a chess playing program
for free or only a little money. Chess 2.0 are five years old but still an 
alternative. To make its usage somewhat more convenient, I decided to create 
better looking pieces. In case they wouldn't look good with your colors, I 
included my color setting as well.

Generally, all in this archive is free. See the bottom of Chess.pieces for 
details.


Chess 2.0 were made in 1989 by A.H.W. Kaufmann (and other people before him)
