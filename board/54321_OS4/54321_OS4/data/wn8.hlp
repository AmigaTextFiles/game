text_center 280 130 "Karnaugh maps to reduce a complex logical equation"
text_center 280 154 "to an optimized sum of products."

text_center 280 202 "If the equation has more than three variables in it,"
text_center 280 226 "the Karnaugh map gets quite intricate."

text_center 280 274 "Five-variable Karnaugh maps often span multiple sheets of paper."

text_center 280 322 "The purpose of Karnaugh maps is better"
text_center 280 346 "served by representing each variable on its own axis."

text_center 280 394 "Then, the optimized sum of products can be found quickly"
text_center 280 418 "by slicing off chunks of "1"s from the resulting cube."
