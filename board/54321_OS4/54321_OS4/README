Description:
        54321 is five games in four-, three-, or two- dimensions for
        one player.  54321 takes five classic two-dimensional puzzle
        games and extends them into three and four dimensions.
        For more information, see the help within the game.

Build Instructions:
    Build:  gmake all size

            This will build the executable and prepare the data.
            All of the files needed for a binary release are placed
            in the ``Release'' directory.

            Or, if you're feeling really saucy and have pdflatex,
            notangle, and noweave installed, you can uncomment the
            ``HAS_NOWEB'' line at the top of the GNUmakefile.  But,
            I've already distributed it with all of the source code
            and the code doc generated, so there's no need to feel
            saucy.

            In the ``archs'' directory, there are subdirectories
            for each platform that I have built this game under.
            If there are any problems compiling, you may have to
            check the ``variables.GNU'' file in the appropriate
            subdirectory of ``archs''.

            For example, if you are compiling under Linux and your
            C++ is not called ``c++'', then you should change the
            definition of ``CXX'' in ``archs/Linux/variables.GNU.''

            And, if your are compiling under Linux or Solaris and
            your SDL_image library is not in /usr/local/, then you
            may have to change the definition of ``SDL_IMAGE'' in
            the appropriate ``variables.GNU'' file.

    Tools and Libraries:
            gmake               (required)
            a C++ compiler      (required)
            SDL                 (required)
            SDL_image           (required)
            SDLmain             (required for Linux, Solaris, MacOS X)
            libpng              (required for Linux, Solaris, MacOS X)
            zlib                (required for Linux, Solaris, MacOS X)

            pdflatex    (optional)
            noweave     (optional)
            notangle    (optional)

Linux Info:
    Build Size: 694k

    Running:
	    From the ``Release'' directory, run ``./54321-Linux''.

            You can give the command-line option ``-window'' to
            start 54321 in a window instead of in fullscreen
            mode.

    If you are using the binary release, then you must already have
    the SDL, SDL_image, libpng, and zlib libraries available on
    your system.

Solaris Info:
    Running:
	    From the ``Release'' directory, run ``./54321-SunOS''.

            You can give the command-line option ``-window'' to
            start 54321 in a window instead of in fullscreen
            mode.

    If you are using the binary release, then you must already have
    the SDL, SDL_image, libpng, and zlib libraries available on
    your system.

BeOS Info:
    Running:
            Open the ``54321-BeOS'' icon.

    If you are using the binary release, then you must already have
    the SDL and SDL_image libraries available on your system.

MacOS X Info:
    Running:
            Open the ``54321-Darwin'' icon.

    If you are using the binary release, then you must already have
    the SDL, SDL_image, libpng, and zlib libraries available on
    your system.

Win32 Info:
    Building:
	    I had to hack things a great deal to get this to
	    build.  I pretty much nuked the ``unsigned int''
	    before all of the ``redefinition of "ii"'' errors.
	    I deleted the ``unsigned char*'' in front of the
	    ``redefinition of "ptr"'' errors.  I changed all
	    of the ``random()'' calls to ``rand()'' and the
	    ``srandom( getpid() ^ SDL_GetTicks() )'' to
	    ``srand( SDL_GetTicks() )''.  I nuked the include
	    of <unistd.h>.  And, I commented out the line
	    in main ``videoFlags |= SDL_FULLSCREEN''.

    Running:
            Open the ``54321'' icon in the ``bin/Win32'' folder.

    Warning:  This runs very slowly under Win32 on my test machine
    (a P133 running Win95).
