       I know not where, Klondike goes,
       Hither, thither, off she flows.

       A gem or not, decide, for free,
       But use it lots, and you owe me.


WallyWare Solitaire:
-------------------
  The most commonly played solitaire game is known widely as Klondike.  It
  might also be known as Patience Solitaire, ChinaMan, Demon Patience,
  Fascination, Canfield or others.  But even more numerous than its names are
  the number of different ways Klondike is played.  Unfortunately, most
  computer solitaire games enforce Hoyle's rules with few exceptions.  So,
  if you like playing by slightly different rules, you're simply out of luck,
  forced to conform.

  WallyWare Solitaire not only plays Klondike nicely with low memory/screen
  requirements, you play by the rules of your choice.  Hoyle's rules can be
  either partially or entirely disabled, and there are 5 different ways of
  working through the hand.  There are many other features including a
  Wrap-Up function for when a win is imminent, an Undo function that will
  back up more than one move, a palette requester to fine-tune the colors
  to your liking, and a Save-Setup function that remembers how everything
  is configured.

  There are also three optional play modes.  In Sudden-Death, if you miss a
  move the game is over.  In the Near-Death mode, a missed move only gets a
  warning.  With the Move-Indicator ON, you're constantly informed whether a
  legal move is possible and if needed, you can get specifics about the move.

  And finally, as a novelty, WallyWare Solitaire plays on its own.  Select
  the AutoPlay function and away it goes.  Makes a nice showroom demo.


Installation:
------------
  With WorkBench, drag either the Klondike directory icon, or all of its
  files to where you want Klondike installed.

    ** A Klondike.settings file may later require another 44 bytes

  It is IMPORTANT that both the document and card-images files be available
  to Klondike.  See the alternate installation scheme if Klondike has trouble
  finding files.


Upgrading:
---------
  If you're upgrading a previous version of Klondike, the 5 files listed
  above, replace their earlier counterparts.  Your existing settings file
  will be utilized by the newer Klondike.  See Changes v1.9 listed below.


In a Nut-Shell:
--------------
  When Klondike is started, it displays the software license, initializes
  program variables and prompts the user to press anything to begin playing.
  Once the cards have finished dealing, you're ready to play the first game.

  Cards are moved by positioning the cursor over the card to be moved, and
  grabbing it by holding down on the left mouse button.  Continue holding
  down on the mouse button and move the card to its new position.  Release
  the mouse button to drop the card.  Several cards can be moved in a single
  motion by grabbing the deepest card of the pile to be moved.

  Cards are dealt according to the dealmode when the deck or hand at the
  (upperleft) is clicked.  If the dealmode allows for multiple passes through
  the hand, clicking the hand position when its empty will pickup the waste
  pile (talon), in preparation for another pass through the hand.  The menus
  can be used to start new games, change the options and rules, quit...


According to "Hoyle":
--------------------
  28 cards are dealt to 7 piles called the tableau.  The object is to move
  all of the cards to the top 4 piles called foundations.

  On the tableau piles, you can build in descending sequence, red on black,
  or black on red.  Multiple cards may also be moved in the tableau and only
  Kings are allowed to be played in an open tableau pile.

  When an Ace is freed, it is played in a foundation pile.  Thereafter, you
  may build on the foundations in ascending sequence of the same suit.  Once
  a card has been played in a foundation, it may not be moved.

  The cards remaining after the deal are called the hand.  There are two
  common methods for working through the hand.  In the one card mode, each
  consecutive card in the hand is turned up and placed in the waste pile.
  The top card in the waste pile is always available to be played.  The game
  ends after the stack has been gone through once.  In the 3 card mode, three
  cards at a time are dealt from the hand to the waste pile but you may make
  as many passes through the hand as necessary.


Klondike Menus and Keyboard Shortcuts:
-------------------------------------
  The Right Mouse Button can be used to activate menu items.  When a check-
  mark character is shown with a menu item, the option or rule is turned ON.
  Multiple menu selections can be made by using the left button along with
  the right button.  Shortcuts are available for most of the menu functions
  or settings.  The keyboard shortcuts can be activated the AmigaOS way, by
  using the right Amiga key inconjunction with the hot key, or by simply
  pressing the hot key by itself.


Game Menu      Hot-Key:
-----------------------
  New Game        N
    Each time a new game is started, your bank balance is charged 50 dollars,
    the cards are reshuffled then dealt, and it's ready for play.

  Chapter 7       7
    Sets the bank balance to zero prior to starting a new game.

  Undo Last Move  U
    The Undo function uses a history buffer to record upto 400 card movements
    within a game.  Activating this function will undo moves in their reverse
    sequence.  Repeated activation will return a game to its initial starting
    condition.

  Wally Warp-Up   W
    Its purpose is to eliminate the formality of moving cards to foundations
    when a win is imminent.  When activated, as many cards as possible are
    moved to foundations.  If all the cards make it to the foundations, a
    victory is scored and bank balance gets a bonus.  As it turned out,
    this also works nicely when a number of cards need to be moved to the
    foundations and you just feel lazy.

  Concede Game    C
    Select this function to see the hidden cards after a game has reached
    its conclusion.  After a Concede game function, play is still possible.
    It will probably be confusing though, since the cards that were just
    turned up are still considered hidden and so unmovable until they are
    really turned up.

  AutoPlay        A
    Starts the computer playing on its own.  Play continues until a mouse or
    keyboard event occurs, which means you can press the A key repeatedly to
    stop/start playing.

  Save Setup      S
    This function saves the current menu options and rules so that this
    arrangement is restored the next time you play Klondike.  It normally
    creates a file named "Klondike.settings" in the current directory.
    In the alternate installation scheme, the settings file is read from
    and written to volume KLONDIKE:.

  Quit            Q
    Ends the Game.  An inadvertant press of a bare Q key is protected with
    a confirmation requester.


Options Menu    Hot Key:
------------------------
  1-Card 1-Pass    1
    Deals 1 card at a time, and allows only one pass through the hand.

  3-Card 3-Passes  2
    Deals 3 cards at a time, and allows only three passes through the hand.

  3-Card N-Passes  3
    Deals 3 cards at a time, and allows unlimited passes through the hand.

  3-Card N-P.Rev.  4
    Deals 3 cards at a time, but their order is reversed as they are moved
    from the hand to the waste pile.  Allows unlimited passes through the
    hand.  It takes two complete passes through the hand without a play
    before a game concludes.

  1-Card N-Passes  5
    Deals 1 card at a time, and allows unlimited passes through the hand.


Rules Menu     Hot-Key:
-----------------------
  All Rules Off   -
    Turns all five rules OFF.

  Non-Movable Partial Stacks
    This rule prevents you from moving partial stacks in the tableau.
    After cards are played in the tableau, they can be moved only a
    few ways; from the top of a stack to a foundation, as part of all
    the cards that are face up in that stack or to an empty tableau.
    The rule is enforced by allowing you to move only cards that are
    the first face-up card from the bottom (screen top) of the stack.

  Non-Movable Foundations
    This rule prevents you from moving cards once they have been played on
    a foundation.

  Kings Only on Empty Stacks
    This rule allows only Kings to be played in empty tableau piles.

  Normal Foundation Rules
    This rule consist of two parts.  An Ace must be the first card played
    in an empty foundation.  Afterwards, cards played in the foundation must
    be one value higher and of the same suit as the card its played on.

  Normal Tableau Rules
    Cards played in the tableau must be of the opposite color and one value
    lower than the card its played on.

  All Rules On    =
    Turns all 5 rules ON.
    There is a small quirk when this function is selected using the multiple
    menu selection feature of AmigaDOS.  The check marks beside the five
    rules will not appear until after the mouse buttons have been released
    and the menu reactivated.


Extras Menu    Hot-Key:
-----------------------
  Move Indicator  M
    When ON, a little box that says PLAY will appear whenever a legal move
    is possible.  Click the PLAY box if you need more information about the
    move.

  Near Death      N
    In this mode, you cannot deal cards from the hand until all the legal
    moves have been made.

  Sudden Death    D
    When sudden death is ON, if you miss a play you're history.  Be sure
    all the plays have been made before clicking the hand to turn up more
    cards.

  Fast Moves      F
    When ON, the card movements are faster.

  Spread Talon x  X
    With this option ON, dealt cards are spread horizontally so that you
    can see the last three cards dealt.

  Spread Talon y  Y
    With this option ON, dealt cards are spread vertically down the screen,
    so that you can view all of the cards in the waste pile.  Turn both
    Spread Talon functions OFF to view only the last card dealt.

  Palette         P
    A simple Palette requester to fine-tune the colors for your monitor.


Rules Discussion:
----------------
  Hoyle's rules are implemented in five parts so to allow for a number of
  common play variations while still enforcing a set of rules.  Still, you
  can turn them all OFF and move cards about freely.  By manually enforcing
  your own choice of rules you can play a popular variation of Solitaire
  known as How-Many-Times-Do-I-Have-To-Cheat-To-Win.

  Don't be surprised if you get unexpected results when only a part of the
  rules are disabled.  While one rule might seem to allow a particular
  move, another rule may still prevent it.


Scoring:
-------
  The scoring method employed is based on a 50 dollar charge for playing a
  game, and a 5 dollar pay back for every card you move to a foundation.
  If all 52 cards make it to the foundations, then a bonus is included which
  makes a total score of 500 dollars, or a net profit of $450.


AutoPlay Logic:
--------------
  Compared to the decision making processes of humans playing solitaire,
  AutoPlay's is bare bones.  While it distinguishes between plays that move
  cards to the foundations and plays that move cards to a tableau pile, it
  does not recognize multiple plays.  The first move it finds is the move
  it makes.

         Start:
           Make plays to the tableau until there are none.

           If there is a move to one of the foundations then
             Make the move then
             Goto start.

           If there is at least one card remaining in the hand then
             Deal once from the hand then
             Goto start.

           Ready the hand for another pass by picking up the waste pile.

           If the game is over, which depends on the dealmode, then
             Start a new game.

           Goto start.


  A variation of this method, which plays cards to the foundations as a
  first priority produced 10 to 20 percent lower returns for all dealmodes.


AutoPlay Experiment:
-------------------
  Out of curiosity, I've wanted to know how the various dealmodes affect
  the odds of making money playing solitaire.  To speed things up, I
  stripped everything possible from the program.  Without all the whistles
  and bells, Klondike plays almost 4 games/second on an A3000.

  The following data was gathered using ten 10,000 game sessions for each
  dealmode.
                              ave                ave
                             %Games  std.       return   std.
        DealMode              Won    dev.       /game    dev.
        =====================================================
        1-Card 1-Pass         1.85   .15        -4.63    .88

        3-Card 3-Passes       3.05   .11        -5.90    .56

        3-Card N-Passes       6.74   .20        14.62   1.00

        3-Card N-Pass Rev.   21.78   .43        95.41   1.93

        1-Card N-Passes      26.38   .69       118.94   3.04


  Its interesting that while the average loss per game in the first two
  dealmodes are about the same, the number of wins in the 3-Card 3-Pass mode
  is much higher.  I guess you don't win as often in the 1-Card 1-Pass mode,
  but when you lose, you don't lose as bad.

  After 1 million games in the 3-card N-Passes mode, Klondike averaged
  14.57 profit per game and won 6.72 percent of the time.

  Again, these results are based on a very simple play strategy.  A human
  can improve them by selecting plays intelligently.


Alternate Installation Scheme:
-----------------------------
  If for some reason you want to start Klondike from the CLI, and from a
  different directory than where Klondike's files are stored, this will
  interest you.  The problem with the normal installation is that Klondike
  won't be able to find its support files.

  To remedy this situation, ASSIGN KLONDIKE: (to your Klondike's directory).
  When Klondike is first started, is tries to find the document file in the
  current directory.  If found, all support files will be read from and
  written to the current directory.  If the doc wasn't found in the current
  directory, it tries volume KLONDIKE: and uses that directory if it can
  find the doc.  If the doc isn't found in either of these directories,
  Klondike exits.


Changes v1.19:
-------------
  New Autoplay function.  Computer plays on its own until a mouse or
  keyboard event occurs.

  New Undo function.  Uses a history buffer to undo moves.  Remembers
  upto 400 moves.

  New Concede game function to view the face-down cards when there
  are no more moves.

  Modified the Move indicator mode so that clicking the Play box will tell
  you which card can be played. (Jeff Lavin)

  Expanded the logic for finding and handling support files.
  Support files may be kept in the current directory or the assigned
  directory KLONDIKE:.  The location the document file determines
  where the remaining support files are expected to be and where the
  settings file is saved. (James Sherman)

  Fixed the only known bug, in the hot-key menu shortcuts.   The qualifying
  Right-Amiga key wasn't supposed to be required.

  Separated the Spread Talon option into its x and y components.  Turn them
  both off to see only the top card in the waste pile. (Bill Falls)

  This ended up changing the size of settings file.
  Klondike v1.9 can read either settings file, but writes only new ones.
  Klondike v1.8 ignores the newer settings files.

  Added ability to abort a WallyWarpUp.  Any mouse or keyboard event serves
  to halt the Warp.

  Shuffles are more thorough and still efficient. (Jeff Lavin)

  The 3-Card n-passes Rev dealmode now uses a hidden pile, just right of
  the hand, which ends up showing the cards being reversed as they are
  dealt.  This cleaned up my voodoo code in the reverse dealmode, which
  was needed to complete the Undo function.

  Fixed the unreported bug in the keyboard menu shortcuts.   The qualifying
  right-Amiga key isn't required to activate a menu item from the keyboard.

  Changed the input handling so that you can double-click ahead when dealing
  from the hand, so long as your not in the sudden-death mode. (Bob Starkey)

  Minor changes to a few of the card images.


Klondike Trivia:
---------------
  In 1897, news of a gold strike on a tributary of the Yukon made the name
  "Klondike" famous.  The word "Klondike" is thought to be a corruption of
  "Thron-diuck", an Indian word which translates as "hammer water".  It is
  said to be derived from the fact that the natives drove stakes across the
  shallow mouth of the stream as anchors for their salmon nets.

  Of coincidence, is the fact that another game of solitaire called Canfield,
  was being played about the same time that news of the gold strike was heard.
  A proprietor of a famous gambling dive at Saratoga made a fortune charging
  $50 per deck and paying $5 for every card played to a foundation.  Even
  though the rules of Canfield solitaire resemble Klondike's, the odds of
  winning proved much to Mr. Canfield's advantage.

  "Games for one player are childish and simple, and are not worth learning.
  When a man is reduced to such a pass as playing cards by himself, he had
  better give up..."
    Captain Crawley, "The Card Players Manual", 1876

  "Patience is the mental equivalent of jogging.  Its purpose is to tone the
  brain up and get rid of unsociable flabbiness."
    David Parlett,  "The Penguin Book of Card Games", 1979


Quirks:
------
  Intuition doesn't provide a means of turning ON several menu checkmarks
  internally, so using the multiple menu select feature of AmigaOS to turn
  ON all the rules doesn't show the checkmarks until the right mouse button
  is released and the menu is reactivated.

  Too bad we don't have a MutualInclude field in the MenuItem structure that
  would turn MenuItems ON the way the MutualExclude field turns them OFF.

  Still minor font problem in the menus when the system default font is
  larger that TOPAZ 8.

  Moving cards flutter.  I needs to use the Amiga's bobs instead of....

  A few when moving cards which exist off the bottom of the screen.


Wish List:
---------
  1) Reset Game/Undo All function.

  2) 600x400x3 graphics.  Card images with rounded see-through corners and
     faster smoother graphics.

  3) Compete against other players, human and or computer.

  4) Compete in several scenarios, where a certain condition determines the
     end of the competition.  Be able to limit the number of games in a session
     or ending when the balance reaches a particular level.

  5) Be able to enter a starting balance.

  6) Keep accounts and histories for multiple players.

  7) Ability to double-click and automatically move a card to its foundation.

  8) Ability to use a DPaint brush as the image for the back of the cards.

  9) A penny for every game of WallyWare Solitaire played.

  Your input welcome!
