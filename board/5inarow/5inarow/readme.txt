Whats New
---------
v1.1 just fixes a display corruption bug under OS4 Update4.


Configuration
-------------
Theres two tooltype options in 5inarow's icon.

GRAPHICSDIR=<the graphics dir to use. default is "gfx">
(any gfx dirs you use must be in the root folder of 5inarow!)

HOWMANYTOWIN=<how many in a row to win a game.. default is 5>
(most people seem to prefer 5 but I like 4. 5 just goes on for years)

The tooltypes are ignored if run from shell.


Custom Graphics
---------------
If you want to make your own graphics for this game, make three tiles:
0.gif for blank spaces, 1.gif for O, and 2.gif for X. Make sure all
three are the same size, or else your hard drive will be reformatted.
(Just joking.. it will just look funny)


Bug reports
-----------
I've been finding it difficult to come up with winner checking routines that
work properly. I think I've got it right now, but if you come up with a way
to win without actually winning, or if you dont win when you should, then
please take a screenshot and mail it to me so I can fix it!


Future
------
v1.2 will be internet playable!! when I get around to making it. :P and
eventually I'll try and do some AI for a 1 player mode.
