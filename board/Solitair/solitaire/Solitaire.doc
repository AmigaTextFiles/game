The Aim Of The Game
===================
32  stones  are  placed in 33 holes. Only the centre hole is left
open.  You  may  "jump"  with  a stone over the other in an empty
hole,  so  the  middle  stone  is  taken  off the board. The only
allowed  way  to  jump  is  either vertical or horizontal, taking
one stone at maximum.

Try  to  take  all stones, keeping one stone left (in the centre)
eventually.  Some  say  this is impossible, but the build-in demo
proves it is possible.


Story
=====
I  programmed  this little game after playing with the MS-Windows
version  of  the  game.  As  I  am a convinced Amiga user, I felt
that  even  the  most  stupid piece of software couldn't exist on
the  PC  without  a  matching  Amiga  counterpart.  So I made the
thing  in  three days using SAS-C 6.2 on my Amiga 2500/020. It is
supposed  to  fill  the  gap  that  M.Sh.Fayzullin  left  when he
introduced his "WBGames" (which are quite nice, by the way!).


Game features
=============
Solitaire only runs on Kickstart 2.04 or higher.

Solitaire  is  a  so called "Commodity", i.e. the program runs in
the background (it hides) and can be activated with a hotkey.
You  can  set  three Commodity  parameters, all using a tool-type
entry in the icon-info-requester or in the CLI command-line:
CX_POPKEY  is  set  to the hotkey (combination) of Solitaire. The
value  is  a  string describing the key-combination (e.g. 'f1' or
'shift a' or 'alt esc'). Default is 'ctrl alt s'.
CX_PRIORITY  defines  the  program  priority within the Commodity
system.  The  priority is used to determine wich commodity should
be activated when they have the same hotkey.
CX_POPUP  is either YES or NO. If set to NO, the solitaire window
will not open when launched.

other tooltypes are:
SCREEN  lets  you  choose the public screen Solitaire should open
on.  The  value  is  a  string with the public screenname. If the
screen  doesn't  exist, Solitaire will open on the default public
screen (probably WorkBench).
XCOORD   and  YCOORD  define  the  upper  xy-coordinates  of  the
Solitaire  window.  So  you  can place the window at opening time
wherever you want.

All other program functions are grouped in standard menus:

Project/Hide : "Hides"  the  program.   Reactivate  it  with  the
               hotkey.  The  window  close-gadget  has  the  same
               function.
Project/About: Displays some credits.
Project/Quit : Quits  and  removes the program from the Commodity
               system.
Solitaire/New Game: Abandons current game and starts a new one.
Solitaire/Demo    : Simulates a very good player ! Watch him !

Solitaire  uses  a  minimum of system recources. The memory usage
and  code  size  was  limited as much as possible, and as for CPU
usage,  I  think a small game like this just hasn't much need for
processor power... (usage is 0% most of the time).

Acknowledgements
================
Thanks  to  Frank  Maesen  for  his  Commodity  research and ßeta
testing. Some code in Solitaire was originally his work.

Also   thank  you  to  Marat  Fayzullin,  because  his  "WBGames"
inspired me to start programming Solitaire.

Finally,  hip  hip houra for Commodore-Amiga because they provide
us the best microcomputer with a great operating system !


History
=======
* v1.0 (7.5.93)
  Initial version. Smashed it into 12124 bytes (only!).

* v1.1 (10.5.93)
  -Fixed esthetical bug when window opened with screenfont higher
   then 8 pixels (made window GimmeZeroZero).
  -Hotkey is now displayed in screentitle.
  -Menus are NewLookMenus under Kick 3.0 or higher.
  -Window  now  refreshes  itself,  saves  memory but is a little
   slower.
  -Removed a bug causing enforcer hits.
  -Added 3 new tooltypes: SCREEN, XCOORD, YCOORD.
   (Now you can play Solitaire everyware !)
  -Demo  is  now  'event'-sensitive. Menuselections, etc. are now
   evaluated.
  -Code size bumped up to 12356 octagonal bits (also know as bytes).

* v1.2 (15.2.94)
  -Added CX_POPUP tooltype (Commodore guidelines!)
  -Removed a small bug in the window-refreshing routine.
  -Now uses default screen font instead of topaz.8.
  -Selecting Quit while playing demo WILL quit now.
  -Selecting Hide while playing demo WILL hide now.
  -Selecting New Game while playing demo will stop the demo.
  -Grabbing an element while playing demo will not crash the
   Amiga anymore. It simply cancels the demo.
