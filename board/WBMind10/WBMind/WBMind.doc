            it using any type  of media as long as the original distribution
            of 'WBMind' remains intact. The distribution of 'WBMind' should
            contain the following files: WBMind
                                         WBMind.info
                                         WBMind.doc

                                         WBMind.c.gz

INSTALLATION:
                Take the WBMind drawer and drag it in the destination
            directory. That is all you need to do.
ABOUT WBMind:
                WBMind is a MasterMind type game that runs on the Amigas
            windows environment. Its name implies that it runs on the
            WorkBench screen, yet it can also jump to other screens
            currently open using the 'Jump' gadget. This program was
            written to baffle your mind while waiting for something to
            download, a picture to raytrace or a huge program to compile.
            Program requires 2.0 or above.

INSTRUCTIONS:
                This game is yet another MasterMind type game. The
            computer stores a four digit code in memory and you have to
            find it. Each digit can be one of six possible characters:
            A,B,C,D,E and F. You may increase the difficulty level by
            adding more characters. The maximum number is ten (A-J).
            You have ten tries to crack the code.

                Each time you enter a four digit combination the computer
            will give you a few clues as to how close you were to the
            stored code. These clues are in the clue boxes on the left
            hand side of the window.

                First the computer checks all four positions for a matching
            character at the correct position. For each one it finds, it
            puts a black square in the clue box. It then completely forgets
            about the positions that have the correct character in them.

                It then checks the remaining position characters to see if
            any of them actually exist in the hidden code but in another
            position. For each character it finds this to be true it puts
            a white square in the clue box.

                Once it is done with this it leaves the remaining squares
            in the clue box blank. Here are some examples:

            EXAMPLES:
                Assume the code hidden by the computer is ABBC.

                If the user enters:             The clue box will have:
                    ABBC                        4 black, 0 white, 0 blank.
                                                And the user has won.

                    ABCD                        2 black, 1 white, 1 blank.

                    BBDD                        1 black, 0 white, 3 blank.

                    BCAB                        0 black, 4 white, 0 blank.

                    CCBE                        1 black, 2 white, 1 blank.

                    DEFF                        0 blank, 0 white, 4 blank.

            Make sure you understand how the clues are generated.

CONTROLS
        You may use either the mouse or the cursor keys to play.

        USING THE CURSOR KEYS

        Left and Right move your current position left or right
        Up and Down select the current character.
        Return tells the computer that you have selected your particular
        4 digit combination and that you are ready for the clues.

        USING THE MOUSE

        Using the mouse is a little more complicated.
        You can select the current position, by clicking on it. You can
        select the current character by clicking on it. If you click
        again on the current position, the current -character- will move
        down by one. If you click again on the current character the
        current position will move right by one.

        Clicking on the clue box tells the computer that you have selected
        your particular 4 digit combination and that you are ready for the
        clues.

        The GIVE UP gadget
            If you want to give up click on this and you will see the
        hidden code.

        The Jump gadget
            This gadget enables you to jump to the next screen.

Acknowledgments:
        First I'd like to thank Matt Dillon for DICE. Its awesome for poor
        students like me that can't afford a $250.00 compiler. I would also
        like to thank all the PD/Shareware programers that have made their
        code available to the public. Its thanks to these people that PD and
        Shareware programs will continue to be developed for the Amiga.
        Keep in mind that its up to us, the users, to maintain a steady
        support for the Amiga developers by actually paying for the software
        we use whether its Shareware or commercial. Last but not least I would
        like to thank Javier Diaz for some of his ideas on the mouse controls
        for this program.

SOURCE CODE:
        The source is included under WBMind.c.gz . I used gzip because it
        has a very good compression ratio and... well not everyone is interested
        in the source so why waste space.

BUGS:
        Well I don't know of any but if you find some please e-mail
        me at sopho@wpi.wpi.edu. If this bounces, and you really think
        the bug is important, you can try writting to my home-home address:
