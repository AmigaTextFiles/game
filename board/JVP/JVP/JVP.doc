NOTES
~~~~~
This program was written over a weekend, after spending a few bucks at
a local casino here, in Las Vegas. The reason for writing it, was just
to prove I could do it.

Over the weekend that it was written, I was never delt a Royal Flush, so
if you are delt one, if you can, please let me know.

The Program is around 75K mostly due to a large amounts of graphics
data.

The only assumption that this program makes is that there are 100 cents
in a dollar.

This program was written using only DPaint, an OLD program called brush
by R. Cox, ExtractFont by Gregg Tavares, and SAS/C6.3
