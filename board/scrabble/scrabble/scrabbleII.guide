Some notes.


ScrabbleII is tested but I can not be held responsible for any loss of
data or otherwise.

Only the Dutch word file contains many words (it is my native language)
I include the English and Italian word files with a few word, after
playing with scrabble some time the number of words will grow.

How to install.


Right now there is no installer. It has to be done manually.

Copy te files:

scrabbleII                 The main programm
scrabbleII.info            The Icon
scrabbleII.iff             Board Picture
scrabble-woorden           Dutch word file
scrabble-words             English word file
parole-scarabeo            Italian word file

to any directory or drive. Copy the iff.library to libs: if you
don't already have it there.

There are currently three translations, English (standard)
Dutch and @{"Italian" LINK "made"}.

Copy the needed translation file to the locale:catalogs/xxxxx

Playing the game


Please look in @{"menu-section" LINK "menu"} first.

To start the game choose player-prefs, there will be a window
where you can set the number of players and if there are human
or computer players.

With the radio-buttons it is possible to set how many players
will play. If the upper radio-button is on, there will be one
player.

With the checkbox gadgets the choice is made if it has to be a
human or computer player.
The name which are filled in will be saved if the save preferences
is choosen from the preferences menu.

Click on start to start the game :-)

A new window will appear, here you can get your stones or if the
player is a computer-player he will do it automatically.

This window will come up for every player.

The active player has his stones in the red area below the buttons.
The other players have their stones in the blue part of the screen.

The player how is on turn can make his word. When you are finished
click on [Oke] and if it is right you will get points and the next
player is on turn.

If the word is unknown there will be a window asking if this word
is a real good English (or other language). click on [oke] if you
are sure.

At the bottom of the main screen there is a place for text to show.
When you make a error or you are doing some wrong, that is the place
to look!

The button [Change Stones] is there so you can get new stones, if
you do change stones the next player is on turn.

The button [Pass] you can use if you can't make any word.
If all the players pass 3 times the computer will ask if the game
must be aborted.

Click on [Stop] to stop this game.

In the place above the buttons you can see what the value of a letter
is and the word-value of the field.
