@node Introduction "TRC User's Guide | Introduction"
@toc  Contents
@{u}@{b}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

The TRC program is a playing aid for Avalon Hill's classic board wargame, The
Russian Campaign.  The TRC program allows two players to conveniently play
The Russian Campaign by e-mail.  The features include:

     Fully computer based PBEM.  No map must be kept set up, no error prone
      recording of unit locations must be done.

     Simple, mouse based unit manipulation.

     Fast, compiled, OS friendly code.

     Respects font and resolution preferences.


@{b}Important:  This program is a play-aid only.  Ownership of the board
game is necessary for play.  There are no game rules in this distribution.@{ub}
The board game The Russian Campaign is published by Avalon Hill.  Contact
your usual wargame sources if you require a copy.

@node Requirements "TRC User's Guide | Introduction | System Requirements"
@toc  Contents
@{u}@{b}System Requirements@{ub}@{uu}

System requirements for the TRC program are modest.  A minimum is:

    68020
    WB2.04
    1MB Chip RAM
    1MB Fast RAM

However, a system capable of 640 x 400 resolution or better is recommended
as is WB3.x.  The resolution recommendation is so that the graphics are
proportioned correctly and to keep map scrolling to a minimum.  The WB3.x
recommendation is due to the bulk of the program testing being done with
WB3.1.

@node Installation "TRC User's Guide | Introduction | Installation"
@toc  Contents
@{u}@{b}Installation@{ub}@{uu}

The TRC program comes with an Installer script which can be run simply by
double clicking on the Install icon.

If for some reason you need to install TRC manually:

    copy the contents of the libs drawer to LIBS:
    copy everything else to whatever drawer you'd like, but maintain
     the directory structure of the distribution.

@remark-----------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Start-up "TRC User's Guide | Introduction | Start-up"
@toc  Contents
@{u}@{b}Start-up@{ub}@{uu}

The program can be launched from either the Workbench or CLI.  If launched
from the CLI, the current directory must be the TRC program directory so it
can find the map file.

The TRC program runs on a custom screen, cloning the mode and resolution of
the default (usually Workbench) screen.

There are no tool-types or command line arguments.

The distribution contains a saved game file called AtStart.trc.  This file
contains the at start Russian and German forces for the standard campaign
game already deployed on the map in their appropriate military districts and
army groups.

@node Mouse "TRC User's Guide | Reference | Mouse Input"
@toc  Contents
@{u}@{b}Mouse Input@{ub}@{uu}

Most player activity is centred on manipulation of the units.  This section
defines mouse and key combinations for the various types of unit manipulation
which occurs during play.  The button and key combinations have been chosen
with the primary goal of serving the TRC program needs.  A secondary goal
has been to parallel typical Amiga convention where reasonable.

@{b}Task@{ub}                       @{b}Mouse@{ub}

Pick up a unit.            Click.

Pick up more units.        Shift Click.

Place held unit.           Click.

Cycle Stack                L-Alt Click.

Flip a unit.               L-Amiga Click


Note:  Unfortunately the choice to use the left modifier keys can conflict
with some Intuition shortcuts.  In particular the screen drag shortcut as
specified in the IControl prefs program defaults to L-Amiga and thus
conflicts with Flip Unit.  This shortcut must be turned off while playing
TRC.  (This author simply turned it off period since he never uses it).
Someday this issue will be addressed in a more elegant fashion.

@toc  Windows
@{u}@{b}The Map Window@{ub}@{uu}

The Map Window displays the game map - it @{b}is@{ub} the game map.  The window
contains a fixed sized bitmap rendition of The Russian Campaign map.  The Map
Window may be moved and sized.  Scrolling is done by proportional scroll bars
in the right and bottom borders.  The window is open at all times.

In the Map Window the game units are moved using the mouse as described in
the @{"Mouse Input" link Mouse} section.

@node CounterMixWindows "TRC User's Guide | Reference | Windows | Counter Mix"
@toc  Windows
@{u}@{b}Counter Mix Windows@{ub}@{uu}

There are two counter mix windows:  a Russian Counter Mix and a German
Counter Mix.  Counter Mix windows represent the supply of game counters
neatly stacked by type, somewhere off-board.  They look like horizontally
arranged rows of units, one of each type.  Underneath each unit is a number
indicating the quantity of that unit type remaining in the counter mix.
(In some games, the quantity of units provided in the counter mix is
significant.  In the Russian Campaign it isn't because the Order-of-Battle
specifies precisely what units become available when.  Thus, the quantities
for all unit types start out a completely arbitrary 99. i.e. Lots).

Counter Mix windows are fixed sized.  They are opened via menu choice 
View|Open <side> Counter Mix.  They are "modeless", and may be left
displayed if the player can afford the screen real estate.

Counters are moved between Map and Counter Mix windows using the mouse as
described in the Mouse Input section.  When a new unit is deployed it is
moved from the counter mix to the map.  When a unit is destroyed, it is moved
from the map to the counter mix.

Note that no Replacement Pool areas have been explicitly provided on the map.
A section of the Black or Baltic seas should serve admirably well.
