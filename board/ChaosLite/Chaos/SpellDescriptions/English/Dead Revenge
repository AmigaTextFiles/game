Dead Revenge*
This extremely rare spell allows a wizard to haunt the opposition even
after death.  When a wizard protected with Dead Revenge is killed a
generator appears in the place where the wizard was killed.  The generator
will produce creatures for the player.  Furthermore, any generators owned
by the killed wizard will live on and continue to be under the control of
the dead wizard!

Thus a player who is killed while possessing the Dead Revenge powerup will
still have an influence in the game, at least until all his generators are
each individually killed.
