Orc*
The orc is typical of many exceedingly common species in having very
limited abilities.  Free orcs band together in tribes but those under a
wizard have deserted their tribes and pledged loyalty to their wizard.  
Orcs are easily slain and are only of minimal use.  Their greatest asset is
their frequency.

They hate elves and will kill them whenever possible but would rather avoid
the stronger ogre. Orcs are scavengers, though not particularly efficient
ones.
