Bless*
The bless spell is used to improve the overall morale and strength of a
wizard and creations.  Every creation of the casting wizard's, including
inanimate objects and growths receives a small boost in life.

Bless spells are best cast when you have many creations or when your wizard
is starting to founder.  You cannot bless the creations of another player.
