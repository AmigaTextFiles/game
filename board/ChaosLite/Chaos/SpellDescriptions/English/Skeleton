Skeleton*
The skeleton is a magically animated human skeleton having no intelligence
or magical resistance and is the weakest undead.  Skeletons are easily
conjured so they are a very common undead.

The skeleton is useful for holding living creatures at bay but quickly dies
when attacked by any other type of undead.
