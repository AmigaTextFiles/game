Storm*
Storm causes the wizard to emit a random volley of lightning bolts.  Due to
the number of bolts produced the wizard will not be able to control where
they land or which creatures are affected.

This spell should be used cautiously. It is best applied when the wizard is
surrounded by enemy creatures.
