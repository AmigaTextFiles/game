Wasp Nest*
A wasp nest is pretty self-explanatory, any enemy creature  approaching a
wasp nest will be automatically attacked.  Once you cast a wasp nest you
can forget about it, since you cannot move it and it attacks automatically.
It will attack all adjacent squares simultaneously.

The wasps are friendly towards the creations of its owner.
