X-Ray*
This spell blasts an object with a high dosage of X-rays.  Weak creatures
may die instantly, as this spell will lower their magical resistance by 2
points and transfer the excess damage to their life force at a 10:1 ratio.  

For example a creature with magical resistance of 1 and life of 15 will be
reduced to a magical resistance of 0 and life force of 5.  This spell
requires line of sight and can be used on inanimate objects.
