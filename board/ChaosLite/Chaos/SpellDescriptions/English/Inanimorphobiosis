Inanimorphobiosis*
Inanimorphobiosis is a more potent version of Stone to Flesh designed by
Professor Conwell to utilize the full power of advanced scientific
principles.  The spell name is derived from Inanimate + morph "to change" +
bio "life" + sis  "the act of".  So it means literally, the act of changing
from inanimate to living.

The recipient inanimate object will become a creature under your control
and will be able to move at least 5 squares and attack with at least 5
points of combat.
