Torment*
This spell allows your wizard to influence the strength of creature casts
made by all the other wizards.  When another wizard casts a creature its
life force will be only 4 points, making it easy to kill.

If you are lucky the effect will hold for several creature casts of each
wizard, but more likely it will work once for each wizard. It has no effect
on independents or generated creatures.
