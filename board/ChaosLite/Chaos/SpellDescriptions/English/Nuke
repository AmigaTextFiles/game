Nuke*
Nuke allows a wizard to invoke a local nuclear disturbance in a chosen
cell.  Anything in the cell will be instantly destroyed.  The chosen cell
will remain radioactive for the duration of the game.  Anything trying to
enter or shoot into a radioactive cell also dies instantly.

Due to the magical protective aura surrounding a wizard, Nuke will not
succeed against a wizard or anything that a wizard is riding on or
meditating in. Thus a Nuke will succeed against a generator but will fail
against a horse being ridden by a wizard.

Nukes can only be obtained by meditation.
