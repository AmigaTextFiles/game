Reveal*
Reveal is the opposite of cloak.  Using reveal on a non-cloaked creature
does nothing, and is a waste of the spell.  Using reveal on a cloaked
creature will destroy the cloak rendering the creature visible again.  Once
revealed the creature can be attacked as per normal.

Reveal works anywhere and does not require line of sight.
