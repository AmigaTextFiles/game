Wake*
The wake spell is used to reverse the effect of the sleep spell or to wake
creatures which went to sleep when a wizard died.  Once woken a creature
will be under the allegiance of the wizard who cast the wake spell,
irrespective of how the creature was put to sleep.

Quickly make use of this spell when the chance arises as sleeping creatures
tend to decay.
