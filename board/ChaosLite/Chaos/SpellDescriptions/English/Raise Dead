Raise Dead*
The Raise Dead spell is a highly sought after spell.  It enables a  wizard
to bring a corpse back from the dead as an undead.  Whatever is raised
comes back from the dead as if it had just been cast by the wizard except
that it will be an undead.

Don't be too quick to use your raise dead spell, but don't hold back on it
for too long either. The spell has only a short range and requires line of
sight.
