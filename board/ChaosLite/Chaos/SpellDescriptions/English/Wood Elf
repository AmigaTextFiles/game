Wood Elf*
Like all elves the wood elf has a pure heart giving them a high magical
resistance (particularly from the darker kinds of magic).  Wood elves are
physically weak and should best avoid direct combat.  Wood elves are highly
skilled with a bow.  Every wood elf comes complete with an ash bow and a
full quiver of arrows.

The ability of the wood elf is slightly exceeded by their rarer cousin the
gray elf.
