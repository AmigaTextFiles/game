Armour*
Armour can be used to boost the defences of any creature.  A good candidate
to armour is your wizard.  Armour adds a third of the maximum life to the
selected creature.  You can apply armour to enemy creatures if desired.  

Line of sight is not required and the spell works over the entire world.
