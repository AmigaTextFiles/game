Ball Lightning*
An energized ball of lightning which severely damages the target's combat
ability.  Inflicts 6 points of damage to the target's combat ability with
any excess damage being transferred to the target's life force at a 2:1
ratio.  Thus using this spell on a creature with 1 combat point would
result in its combat being reduced to 0 and its life force being reduced by
10 points.
