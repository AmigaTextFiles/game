Devastation*
When you are tired of the current battles cast this spell for a clean
start.  This spell essentially wipes the slate clean.  Everything except
wizards and generators is instantly destroyed.  Even mounted wizards will
be exposed.  However, this spell should be used with some caution.  It is
best to use this spell when you have several good creatures on your spell
list with which you can repopulate the world after the devastation.

The use of this spell is bound to cause outrage on the part of other
wizards, which is all the more reason to use it.  The mechanism of this
spell has never been properly explained, but wizards known to have cast it
speak of a euphoric state of mind immediately after the devastation.
