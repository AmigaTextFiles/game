Range Boost*
Range Boost improves the ranged combat abilities of any creature which has a
shooting weapon, including dragons, elves, wizards with bows, pyrohydra and
so on.  It has no effect on creatures without some initial ability.

Range Boost increases both the range and the damage of ranged combat by +4.
