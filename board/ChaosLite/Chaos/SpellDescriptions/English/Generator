Generator*
The generator spell allows a wizard to cast a generator identical in
appearance and operation to those used by the independent creatures.  This
spell is only available by meditation.  It is unlikely that you will ever
get one of these spells.

Like the independent generator, this generator will randomly produce
creatures belonging to the casting wizard, but unlike independent
creatures, once created the wizard takes responsibility for their movement.

Once cast the generator is essentially eternal.
