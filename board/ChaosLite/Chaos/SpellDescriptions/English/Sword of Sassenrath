Sword of Sassenrath*
This spell works over the entire world and does not require line of sight.  
The recipient of the Sword of Sassenrath will gain 5 points of combat and
will suddenly be able to attack undeads.

Due to the fact that this mighty weapon was forged by the Arch-Mage
Sassenrath himself (one of the most intelligent wizards to have ever
lived), the recipient will also become considerably more intelligent. Any
friendly unit ending its turn adjacent to the holder of the Sword of
Sassenrath will also tend to become more intelligent.
