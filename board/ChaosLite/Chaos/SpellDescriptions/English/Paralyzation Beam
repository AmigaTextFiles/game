Paralyzation Beam*
Causes your wizard to emit a Beam of Paralyzation which will drain 7 points
of movement from EVERYTHING in the chosen direction.  If the target does
not have at least 7 points of movement then the beam causes 6 life points
of damage for every movement point less than 7.

This beam does not affect scrolls.
