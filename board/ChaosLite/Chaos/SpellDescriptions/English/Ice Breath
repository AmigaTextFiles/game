Ice Breath*
This spell causes the wizard to breathe out an icy beam.  This beam can
only be resisted by magic.  Any creature hit by the icy beam will have its
magical resistance lowered by 2 points with the excess damage transfered to
its life force at a 10:1 ratio.

Thus, very weak creatures are likely to die of hypothermia.
