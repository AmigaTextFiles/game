Vulture*
The vulture is easily cast and unlike most creatures can be cast up to 2
squares away from the wizard, provided there is line of sight.  The vulture
easily escapes from conflict and has good range.  It also has excellent
eyesight and an even better sense of smell.  Vultures are scavengers.
