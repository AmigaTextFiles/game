Points*
When competing for honour against other wizards it is desirable that your
final score reflects your ability.  This simple spell awards your wizard
100 points in reflection of his greatness.  Unfortunately, the spell does
nothing to assist your fate in the world.

The spell is best cast when you are stuck in a corner with no room to cast
a more productive spell. The spell is most beneficial in limited turn games
where you are playing solely for points.
