Bipedal Generator*
This is a like the general purpose generator but is somewhat weaker and
only produces a limited number of races.  It is capable of generating most
of the weaker bipedal races.

Casting such a generator will ensure that you always have a fresh supply of
blocking creatures even if not a strong army.
