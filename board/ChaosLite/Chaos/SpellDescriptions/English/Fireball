Fireball*
This spell causes the wizard to emit a ball of fire which will cause
magical damage and/or physical damage as the excess damage caused to the
magical resistance is transfered to the life force at a 10:1 ratio.  

Anything can be shot provided it is in range and line of sight is
available.  Be careful not to shoot your own creations.
