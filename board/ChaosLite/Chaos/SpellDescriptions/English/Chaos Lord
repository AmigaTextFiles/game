Chaos Lord*
A wizard casting this spell will be completely enlightened to the entire
universe and become essentially immortal.  A wizard possessing the level of
potency induced by this spell will not need support creatures, mounts, nor
undeads.

Such a wizard may freely go hand to hand with a demon and still expect to
win easily.  All other players will need to forget their petty squabbles if
they are to defeat you.

If you have this spell on your list it should be used immediately, no
matter what the circumstances.  This spell induces a state more powerful
than the highly sought after Touch of God spell.  Besides giving the wizard
full strength in all vital statistics the wizard will also receive the
triple power up, a bow, wings, fire shield, flood shield, earthquake
shield, reflector, pox shield, and quickshot.
