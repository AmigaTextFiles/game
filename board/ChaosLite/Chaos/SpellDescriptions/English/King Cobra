King Cobra*
The king cobra has very little to recommend for it, aside from the fact
that its poisonous bite causes permanent damage to any victim stupid enough
to get close to it.

Every creature is capable of killing a king cobra, even creatures as low as
bats, dire wolves, vultures, fauns, elves, and pegasii can kill a king
cobra in a single blow. The king cobra is also stupid, has minimal magical
resistance, and is sluggish. Assuming the cobra survives an attack, it has
a good chance of escaping the conflict.
