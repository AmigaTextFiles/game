Hide*
Causes your wizard to disappear from the game for some time (typically
about 5 rounds).  During this time you will be unable to do anything, you
will not be able to cast creatures.  However, you will be able to move any
creatures you have left on the board.

The spell is most useful when your wizard is in a tight spot. You reappear
at a random position.
