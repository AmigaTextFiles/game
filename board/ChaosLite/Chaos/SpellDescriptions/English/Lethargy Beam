Lethargy Beam*
Causes your wizard to emit a Beam of Lethargy which will drain 3 points of
movement from EVERYTHING in the chosen direction.  If the target does not
have at least 3 points of movement then the beam causes 6 life points of
damage for every movement point less than 3.

This beam does not affect scrolls.
