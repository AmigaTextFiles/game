Brown Bear*
A very strong and skilled animal, the brown bear is a tough match for a
lion.  Like the lion the brown bear is very ferocious in attack.  The brown
bear is not particularly agile and once engaged the bear must usually fight
to the death.  A brown bear can be killed by the rarer but more powerful
grizzly bear.
