Shadow Wood*
The shadow wood is a useful tree when they are on your side.  The shadow
wood cannot move but it can attack any enemy creature that strays into an
adjacent square.

Unlike the magic wood the shadow wood cannot be used for meditation by a
wizard. Each cast allows for 6 trees to be conjured up to 12 cells away
from the wizard.
