Archery*
The target is given the archery powerup.  This spell is only meaningful for
objects having ranged combat.  It will have little effect on other
creatures.  Further, there is little point in casting this spell on
creatures (like elves) which already have this ability.  Ideal targets are
dragons, bolters, and wizards with bows.

After receiving this spell line of sight will not be required for ranged
combat.
