T-Rex*
The Tyrannosaurus Rex is the most terrible and fearsome of the carnivorous
dinosaurs.  Despite its size this animal is surprisingly swift and is a good
match for any dragon.  It can kill many creatures with a single bite.  It
is capable of killing a lion, pegasus, bear, or bird lord within two turns.

The Tyrannosaurus is a perpetually hungry hunter/scavenger and will quickly
devour any corpses it can find.  Tyrannosaurus is best attacked with magic.
