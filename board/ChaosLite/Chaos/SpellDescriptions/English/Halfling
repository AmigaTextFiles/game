Halfling*
These little guys are extremely magic resistant.  The halfling is typically
a hard-working, orderly, and peaceful citizen similar to a human, although
much smaller.  They usually fight with swords although some have been known
to carry bows.  While they fight well, and with determination, they have
little stamina and quickly become exhausted in battle.
