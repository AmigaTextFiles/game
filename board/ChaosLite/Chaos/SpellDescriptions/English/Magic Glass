Magic Glass*
This spell allows the wizard to produce 4 pieces of magic glass.  To the
opposition the glass has the strength and consistency of a wall, but to
your own creatures the glass will allow line of sight and ranged combat.  

It is the ideal substance behind which to locate creatures with ranged
combat or even to hide your wizard. One nice thing about this spell is that
you don't need Line of Sight to cast it.
