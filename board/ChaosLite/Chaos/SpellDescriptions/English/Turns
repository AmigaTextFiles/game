Turns*
Are you tired of expending a large amount of energy struggling in what
seems to be a never ending battle?  This spell could be the answer.  If the
number of turns remaining exceeds 10 then this spell will give everyone a
major hurry up by cutting the number of remaining turns to just 10.  

However, the spell is bipolar and if the number of turns remaining is less
than 10 then an additional 10 turns will be granted.
