Hidden Horror*
For all intents and purposes this is a halfling with a singular important
difference.  Upon its death the hidden horror becomes a red dragon (unless
it is set to reincarnate, in which case it becomes a golden dragon).

The halfling is typically a hard-working, orderly, and peaceful citizen
similar to a human, although much smaller. They usually fight with swords
although some have been known to carry bows. While they fight well, and
with determination, they have little stamina and quickly become exhausted
in battle.
