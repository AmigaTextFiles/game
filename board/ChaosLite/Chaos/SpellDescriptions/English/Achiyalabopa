Achiyalabopa*
A large low-flying bird with poor eyesight.  The history of this creature
is unclear, but it has evolved feathers which resemble knives.  It attacks
simply by brushing against the opponent.  The knife-like feathers are sharp
enough to make a large number of serrations on the hides of the opponent.
