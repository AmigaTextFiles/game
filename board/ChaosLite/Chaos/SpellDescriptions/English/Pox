Pox*
The pox is a highly infectious and contagious disease which is spread by
proximity.  Creatures infected with the pox will slowly wilt and may
eventually die.  Wizards are not immune to its effects but can be protected
with a pox shield.

All creatures can be cured of the pox by the cure spell. This spell allows
you to infect one creature with the disease.
