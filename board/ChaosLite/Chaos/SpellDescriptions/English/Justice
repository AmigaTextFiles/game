Justice*
A spell which attempts to make a creature see the evil of its ways.  The
feedback generated is often enough to kill the target.

It can be applied to wizards, does not require line of sight and has
infinite range. 2 attempts are granted, each of which inflicts 3 points of
damage to the creature's magical resistance.
