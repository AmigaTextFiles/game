Vodka*
This spell causes bottles of Vodka to appear nearby all the creatures
controlled by the same wizard as your target.  All the creatures will be
very happy about receiving this free gift and will merrily chug it all
down.

The end result is that they will all be drunk for 2 turns cumulative and
their combat ability will be effectively cut in half.
