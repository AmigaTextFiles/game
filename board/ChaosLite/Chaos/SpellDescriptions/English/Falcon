Falcon*
Falcons are very swift and can cross the longer axis of the visible world
in just three moves.  Because of this incredible range the falcon is most
useful for mounting long range aerial assaults and its excellent eyesight
makes it invaluable for long-range reconaissance.

A falcon can only be granted through meditation.
