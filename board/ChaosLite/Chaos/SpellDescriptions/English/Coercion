Coercion*
A mental assault against all the other wizards.  The other wizards will
have difficulty staving off the onslaught and they will not have time to
select a spell in the subsequent round.

While most wizards will shake of the effects of the spell within one round,
some wizards may suffer for several rounds.  This spell is useful in the
early stages of the game and gives you a chance to get ahead of the other
wizards.
