Golden Dragon*
A very intelligent creature that rules amongst the good living species with
the exception of the immensely rare platinum dragon.  The golden dragon can
fight in a similar vein as the stone giant but has the gift of fire
breathing and flight which makes it extremely deadly to any creature or
wizard that attracts its attention.

The golden dragon can kill some of the lesser dragons.
