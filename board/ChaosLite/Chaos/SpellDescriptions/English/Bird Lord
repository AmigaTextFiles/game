Bird Lord*
A bird lord is a king of the avian species.  Often bird lords are mistaken
as eagles.  Bird lords can heal any wounds they receive at a phenomenal
rate.  They are amongst the fastest of all creatures and are well learned.  
Most magic will have little effect on them.  The bird lord possesses
adequate combat skill and can easily flee from danger.  The biggest boon of
the bird lord is its ability to fire an extremely acidic salvo an immense distance.
