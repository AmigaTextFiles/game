Overview
========

   This is a mythical strategy game for up to eight human and/or
computer players. It is a game of justice and vengeance, of good versus
evil, of life versus death, of light versus shadow, as a group of
wizards battle ferociously to exterminate their opponents and achieve
world domination.

   If you dare to compete, you will be faced with beasts of all
descriptions, from everyday animals like horses and lions; to monsters
of hideous proportions, from fire-breathing multi-headed pyrohydras to
extremely dangerous dragons that sail through the air hunting their
favorite food -- you. Creatures from the spirit world are also in
abundance; you may even be confronted with the devil himself. Say your
prayers if you do.

   You will experience the most cataclysmic natural disasters ever to
occur in the course of human history. You may be drowned in swift-moving
floodwaters, burned beyond recognition in raging uncontrolled
hellfires, or be swallowed up by the very Earth itself in horrific
earthquakes.

   With your own eyes you will witness corpses rising from the dead to
rejoin the battle. You will be struck with terror as your army succumbs
to massive piles of green slime and purple fungi. Even the humble tree
is not always what it seems.

   Your army is not restricted to man alone. Your forces will be filled
out with orcs, elves, ogres, and a host of other races. You will
doubtless send many of these creatures to a premature death as they
blindly follow your every command. Only those wizards who use the
strategy of a Perfect General, possess the bloodlust of a Warlord, make
effective use of their Hired Guns and have the zeal to build an Empire
will triumph in the end.

   You will utilize and be subjected to some of the most powerful magic,
sorcery, and necromancy known to the human mind. You may be cursed,
drained, and infected with disease. You may disappear into the ethereal
plane or vanish into a timewarp. You will twist time, garble gravity,
and rip holes in space as you criminally violate all the laws of
physics with the unbridled arrogance of the dictatorial tyrant you
really are.

   You will cause untold destruction of a once pristine environment as
you destroy entire forests on a whim, saturate the air with
foul-smelling toxic fumes and unleash the apocalyptic fury of nuclear
devastation on all who oppose you.

   The grapes of wrath never tasted so good.

   To survive, you must strike a fine balance between defending your
wizard and attacking the other wizards. Only one wizard can rule the
world, but it can be a long time in coming, with up to eight wizards
chasing the same goal. Furthermore, the wizards may lose control of
their powerful magic and suffer the dreaded fate of mutual
annihilation; forever cleansing the world of disruptive magic!

System requirements
===================

   Versions 2.5 and below may be played on any Amiga with 1 megabyte of
ram and OS 1.2 or higher. Yes, even if you have an old 1985 A1000 with
Kickstart 1.2 you can play this great game so long as you have 1 meg or
more of ram.

   The authors went to great lengths and much trouble to ensure
compatiblity with all the old Amigas. We hope you enjoy the fruits of
our labors.

   Version 2.5 is the LAST version that will work on any Amiga with 1
meg of ram. ALL versions above 2.3d require at least 2 megs of ram, a
hard drive, at least OS 1.2 or higher and a Motorola 68000 CPU or
higher.

   2.5d = demo version. 2.5f = full version which only registered users
can obtain. The demo version cannot load games, and stops at turn 18.

   Chaos 2.6 will work under at least Workbench 1.2, 1.3, 2.04, 3.0 and
3.1 and should work on anything subsequent. It requires an Amiga
supporting PAL mode. All Amigas manufactured since 1989 support PAL
mode. Any Amiga manufactured before 1989 supports PAL mode if it has
been upgraded with an enhanced Agnes chip. (Enhanced Denise chip not
needed).

   Version 2.71 is the LAST version that will work with an OS less than
3.0

   Version 2.81 and up all require a 68020 processor or higher and OS
3.0 or higher.

   If you live in the USA or Canada then you'll need to boot your
computer into PAL mode. The best way to do this is to use the program
"degrader", though in this case you aren't going to actually degrade
anything. With degrader select "50 Hz", "50 Hz System" and "Survive
Resets" and your Amiga will be rebooted in PAL mode and will think it
is in a European country operating in PAL mode.

   Normally a North American Amiga operates in NTSC mode 640x400
resolution.  PAL mode produces a resolution of 640x512.

   Chaos makes use of the @{b}narrator.device@{ub} and @{b}req.library@{ub}. As of
version 2.2 Chaos no longer makes any use of @{b}ReqTools.library@{ub}.

   If the @{b}-t@{ub} option is used the @{b}translator.library@{ub} is also used.  Other
required files are the executable @{b}chaos@{ub} and the data files @{b}pool.ssc@{ub} and
@{b}chaos.prb@{ub} all of which must reside in the current directory when Chaos
is started. There are various other fonts, music and Sounds files which
reside in the directories of the same name within the current directory.

   The @{b}-t@{ub} option forces translation of player names for the speech and
requires the @{b}translator.library@{ub}. A few other options are supported, to
find out about these use @{b}chaos -h@{ub} and then press @{b}left Amiga-M@{ub} to return
to the CLI screen.

Installation
============

   Just toss it on your hard drive somewhere.

   You do not need to copy any files to LIBS: or FONTS: or anywhere
else.

   You do not need to edit your startup-sequence.

   You do not need to make any ASSIGNs.

   There are no other files that you have to mess with.

   You do not need to run any install scripts or answer any complicated
questions.

   All Amiga software should be this easy to install, don't you agree?

The game
********

   It should be unnecessary to read all the instructions to play the
game. For those who are itching to start skip to the Game Startup
section(see @{"GameStartup" Link "GameStartup"}.) to see how to load the game and then just
follow your nose. For the rest of you, the following describes how the
game is played.

   Each player (human or computer controlled) starts the game with a
wizard and a randomly generated repertoire of spells. The idea is to be
the last wizard alive and to amass the greatest score. Once your wizard
is killed you are out of the game, so protecting your wizard is vital
to your survival. The options available at the start of the game allow
for a wide range of scenarios.

   A game is organized as a series of rounds. Each round consists of
several stages, and each living wizard may partake in each stage of
each round. The major stages are: spell selection, spell casting, and
movement. Each stage is described in detail below. As well as these
main stages there are also a number of auxiliary stages performed
solely by the computer.

   The game can be played almost entirely with the mouse and is icon
driven.  All the entities in the game have animated graphical
representations. A text region at the bottom of the screen is used to
display other information. Initially, you may be perplexed by the wide
range of spells available but after a few games you should become
comfortable.

   The world once was comprised of a 7000 mile diameter sphere covered
with beautiful vegetation, crystal clear water and wonderful wildlife.
But that was before the 1000 year wizard war of Irvine vs. Conwell; the
culmination of which resulted in the destruction of most of the prime
material plane of existence.(1) All that is left is a flat rectangular
board of square cells, measuring 17 across by 14 down.

   The game is played on this rectangular board of square cells. You
move your pieces around the board using the mouse. The cost of a move
depends on the distance between the initial cell and the final cell. It
costs more to move diagonally than it does to go vertically or
horizontally.

   It is important to understand there is a distinction between the
gaming environment supplied by the computer and the computer controlled
entities.  When a computer player moves it does not get access to any
information that you cannot get. In fact, the computer bases it moves
on less information than a human player.

How to win
==========

   You have to:

   @{b}*@{ub} Kill all enemy wizards,

   @{b}*@{ub} kill or block all independent generators,

   @{b}*@{ub} kill all enemy creatures that are still roaming around.

   A generator needs an empty space on which to generate creatures
onto. So if you can block all the spaces surrounding a generator, then
it cannot generate anything.


@EndNode

@Node "GameStartup" "Chaos.Guide/GameStartup"

@Toc "TheGame"

Game startup
============

   The game can be started from the Workbench or from the command line.
Some of the options can only be controlled from the command line. The
usual way of starting from the command line is to enter the command
@{b}chaos -t@{ub} when in the directory containing the chaos files. There is an
icon for starting from the Workbench. Installation is discussed in
Section Installation (see @{"Installation" Link "Installation"}). You should ensure Chaos has a
stack of at least 50000 bytes. From the command line this can be done
by typing @{b}stack 50000@{ub} before starting chaos. Those who have received
Chaos on a self-booting disk need not worry about this matter.

   These instructions are accurate for 3.0 of the game.  However, Chaos
is a rapidly evolving program and new features are continually being
added and some instructions may become obsolete or inaccurate in the
future. Only registered users are guaranteed of being informed about
new releases.

   After passing the introductory screens you will arrive at the first
setup screen. This screen allows you to select which wizards will be
playing, whether or not they will be computer controlled, the teams,
and their names. By default it starts with two human controlled wizards
on different teams. The @{b}T@{ub} column is used for team selection. The icons
appearing in this column represent a team. By clicking on them they
move on to the next team in the sequence. If two wizards are showing
the same icon this means they will start on the same team. There also
exist spells which can alter the teams during the course of a game.

   Once you are satisfied with the setup click on @{b}Start@{ub} which will take
you to the second initialization screen. On this screen you can select
the number of generators (default 4, maximum 99), number of spells
(default 20, maximum 99), and level of computer wizards (maximum 9).

   The wizard level influences only the allocation of spells to computer
players and does not influence the way the computer moves or casts
spells.  Any wizard can improve their level rating by casting Level
spells during the game. Doing so increases the chances of getting
useful, rare and powerful bonus spells.

   You should decide how many turns the game should last for. The
default action is forever which means the game continues until all
human players have been killed or one human player remains and all
computer players are dead. Alternatively, any number up to 999 can be
specified. The number of turns remaining is displayed at the top right
of the screen as a series of tally marks. If these are shown in yellow
then you are into the last few turns.

   You can also turn @{b}Texas Trash'em@{ub} on or off. Texas Trash'em allows
you to optionally trash (discard) one of your spells in addition to
casting a spell each turn. This allows you to discard spells you don't
like or don't want. In version 1.8 and below, computer players do not
discard spells. In version 1.9 and up you MUST discard a spell each
turn but casting a spell is optional (unless there are 5 spells or less
left in your spell list in which case you don't have to discard if you
don't want to.)

   By default the game will operate in @{b}Classic@{ub} mode. In this mode only
a limited number of spells are available. This mode is particularly
suited to neophytes. If you switch off this mode then the full
repertoire of spells is made available.

   You may also select the number of artifacts that will be randomly
placed on the board. Allowable settings are 0 to 99.

   Artifacts are like a regular creature object except it belongs to
@{b}NOBODY@{ub} until someone moves adjacent to it.

   An Artifact's owner is determined at the beginning of each movement
phase.  It is determined according to who has the most creatures
adjacent to it. In the event that 2 or more players have an equal
number of creatures adjacent to it then it remains @{b}NOBODY@{ub}'s.

   Inanimate objects and other artifacts do @{i}NOT@{ui} assist in controlling
artifacts.

   Currently there are only 4 artifacts:

   @{b}*@{ub} Bolter Wall Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Dalek Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Robot Artifacts

   @{b}*@{ub} Stone Golem Artifacts

   Artifacts have 0 movement points.

   Most magic spells can be cast on Artifacts so you can heal an
Artifact or increase its capabilities, etc.

   If you play Chaos against human opponents who hide in a corner,
cowering in fear, then try playing the game with some artifacts. The
sight of a nice, big, powerful artifact just sitting there waiting for
someone to claim it can be a strong incentive for them to charge out
after it and has been known to spark intense power struggles.

   @{b}Hidden Artifacts@{ub}: If this is turned on then artifacts will be buried
underneath walls, trees, rocks and other inanimate objects. These
objects will have to be destoryed in order to take posession of the
artifact underneath.

   You can also select the number of scrolls that will appear on the
board.  Allowable settings are 0 to 99. A scroll is a spell lying on
the board which is free for the taking. Isn't that cool? Scrolls are
magically inscribed on extremely delicate, dry, brittle, paper. They
are therefore excessively fragile and even the tiniest amount of damage
will destroy them. The scroll rules should be set to one of the
following:

  1. Scrolls can be picked up by anybody.

  2. Scrolls can be picked up by wizards only.

  3. Scrolls can be picked up by anybody except flying creatures.

   Inanimate objects can never pick up scrolls.

   There are normally only 3 ways to affect scrolls:

   @{b}*@{ub} By entering a cell that contains a scroll and surviving there
     until the end of the complete round. The complete round means
     until everyone has finished their turn for this round, including
     all wizards and independents. If you survive in a cell containing
     a scroll until the end of the round then the scroll is magically
     added to your commanding Wizard's spell list.

   @{b}*@{ub} Destroy them by shooting them.

   @{b}*@{ub} Destroy them by Burying them with the Bury spell.

   @{i}Caution:@{ui} shooting the scrolls of Undead Elementals may produce
Ungood side effects. }8>

   If you play Chaos against human players who just sit in a corner and
avoid conflicts with each other then try playing the game with some
scrolls laying around. This can draw them out of their corner and start
up some fierce battles!

   @{b}Scroll Delay@{ub}: Allowable settings are 0 to 6.  This controls how many
consecutive turns you must control the cell before you are awarded the
scroll. 0 means you will acquire it at the end of @{i}this@{ui} round. 1 means
you will acquire it at the end of the @{i}next@{ui} round and so forth.

   If at the end of a round, you no longer control the cell then you
must start over again so if @{b}Scroll Delay@{ub} is 6 and you lose control of
the cell after only 5 turns then you must regain control for 6
consecutive turns to obtain the scroll.

   You are permitted to move creatures into and out of the cell
containing the scroll without any penalty so long as you control the
cell with a scroll-capable creature at the end of the round.

   @{b}Hidden Scrolls@{ub}: If this is turned on then scrolls will be buried
underneath walls, trees, rocks and other inanimate objects. These
objects will have to be destoryed in order to take posession of the
scroll underneath.

   At this time you should not change the board size.

   When you have made any desired changes, click on @{b}Start@{ub} to begin the
game.

Spell selection
===============

   For each human wizard in turn, the right of the screen is filled
with the currently available spells for that wizard. Information can be
obtained about the spells by reading about the spells in this manual or
by selecting the @{b}?@{ub} gadget and then clicking on the spell you wish to
know about.  Or simply by pointing the mouse at the spell in question
and then pressing the @{b}q@{ub} or @{b}?@{ub} key on the keyboard.

   A wizard can decide not to choose a spell by clicking the return
gadget, whence control will pass to the next wizard.

   Assuming you wish to pick a spell, simply click on the desired spell.
During the casting stage you will attempt to use your selected spell.
Care should be taken in spell selection. Consider such things as the
range of the spell, the situation of the wizard, your position on the
board, and whether line of sight is required for the spell. Just press
@{b}c@{ub} (for Casting possibilities) while the mouse is over a spell and
all the possible places that you could cast that spell will be
highlighted on the board.

   Once selected, a spell must be attempted. If the spell is aborted,
it will still be considered used and will not appear on your spell list
in the next round.

   If @{b}Texas Trash'em@{ub} was selected then you will also be required to
select a spell to be discarded (unless you have less than six spells
remaining). Such a selection must be made even if you choose not to
select a spell for casting.

Spell casting
=============

   During spell casting, each player who selected a spell during the
spell selection stage will in turn get a chance to actuate the spell.
Computer controlled wizards will attempt to cast a spell at their
position in the sequence. In addition, each generator on the screen
might produce a creature. Certain other creatures also occasionally
cast spells.

   For each player in turn the spell selected is shown on the bottom
line of the screen, together with the number of attempts and the range
for the spell. For example,

     Gray Elf x1  Range=2

   means 1 Gray Elf is being cast, and the elf can be cast either
immediately adjacent to the wizard or one cell removed from the wizard
(just press @{b}c@{ub} to see all possible legal cells). A range of zero means
the spell can be cast simply by pressing the left mouse button and
there is no need to select a cell. Such spells are often special powers
for the wizard. The computer automatically applies the spell to the
correct wizard or creature.  Certain spells have a range of 15, these
spells can be cast on any appropriate cell on the screen and do not
require line of sight.

   Most spells have a fixed range, measured in a straight line from the
casting wizard. For instance, nearly all creatures have a range of one
and so can only be cast immediately adjacent to the wizard. All these
spells require line of sight. The line of sight is measured from the
centre of the wizard's cell to the centre of the destination cell. You
can see over blank space, dead creatures, pits, pools, and fires.
Sometimes line of sight can be obtained by waiting until an appropriate
time in the animation sequence.(1) By pressing @{b}c@{ub} you can ask the
computer to show you all legal target cells.

   Spells can be aborted by pressing the right mouse button. Aborted
spells still get used up, so try to avoid having to abort spells. If
you find yourself aborting spells often, you are probably not choosing
spells appropriate to your situation.

   Most spells can be cast only on certain types of cell (the program
will notify you of any errors you make in selecting the cell). If you
make an error you are free to choose a new cell. For instance,
creatures can be cast on empty cells or cells containing dead
creatures, but cannot be cast on other creatures or inanimate objects.

   After each wizard has cast, the generators may produce creatures on
any cell adjacent to the generator which is empty, or contains a dead
creature.  Adjacent cells occupied by creatures or inanimate objects
will never be generated upon.

@Next "Movement"

@Toc "TheGame"

Board update
============

   The board update is handled entirely by the computer. The update
carries out activities which are not directly under any player's
control. During the update any or all of the following things might
happen:

   @{b}*@{ub} The growths (earthquakes, fire, flood, fungi, orange jelly, gooey
     blob, and green ooze) are permitted to grow. Each cell containing
     a growth may or may not grow. If a cell is going to grow it will
     do so in only one direction in any particular turn. The direction
     of growth is chosen at random.  Earthquakes cannot "grow"
     diagonally. Some of the growths grow faster than others, orange
     jelly is particularly voracious while floods tend to be sluggish.
     If a cell doesn't grow it might dissipate instead. You may have
     some of your creatures buried, killed, or revealed in this growth
     process.  Should your wizard be buried or killed you are
     considered dead and your game ends (an exception occurs in the
     case of a wizard having previously cast Lich Lord).

     Any creature which is covered by a growth will have its life set
     to one half of its normal maximum upon being uncovered. If the
     growth is killed somehow, such as you shooting it with a bow, then
     all the other stats are left untouched.But if the growth has died
     of natural causes then @{i}all@{ui} the creature's stats will be set to
     their normal intial values, though life will still be cut in half.
     These effects can be exploited by clever players.

     Neither case applies to dead bodies, scrolls or artifact
     creatures. Thus you cannot morph an artifact creature into a non
     artifact creature by letting it get covered up with a growth.

   @{b}*@{ub} Any tempests on the board may move. A creature in the path of the
     tempest will be thrown to a new random location. On very rare
     occasions a creature will be killed as a result of the throw.

   @{b}*@{ub} Any vortices may move. A creature in its path will disappear into
     the future.

   @{b}*@{ub} Ropers get tired of constantly sitting in the same place.
     Sometimes they decide to teleport to a new location.

Movement
========

   The movement stage is the most complex stage, since normally there
are a large number of creatures to be moved and each creature has a
number of possible moves. Each player is given a chance to move in turn
(unless he is the victim of a Freeze spell). The strategies employed
during the movement stage will have the greatest effect on your
survival in the game. Movement involves not only the shifting of
creature positions but also combat.

   Dead creatures, sleeping creatures, and growths cannot be moved. No
inanimates can be moved, although shadow wood trees and bolters may be
used to attack enemy creatures(1) in adjacent cells. Special objects
like ropers, wasp nests or solars are controlled by the computer.

   A player is able to move each creation once in each turn. To end
your turn click on the return gadget and control will pass to the next
player.  Players having cast the Move It spell in the current round
will get a second chance to move after all other players have moved,
but before the independents move.

   A creature is said to be @{i}engaged@{ui} if it is adjacent to an enemy
creature and is unable to retreat. Engaged creatures cannot be moved but
may still be able to fight. How likely a creature is to be engaged is
dependent on its manoeuvrability and the number of adjacent hostile
creatures.

   To move a creature simply click on the creature using the left mouse
button. Normally, the distance the creature may be moved will be
displayed in the text bar. Depending on the creature, it will be flying
movement or walking movement. There is a special cursor when flying
movement is active.  To see all legal moves press the @{b}m@{ub} key.

Flying movement
---------------

   For flying creatures you can pick any cell within the given range
except cells occupied by your team's creations. If the cell is empty or
contains a dead creature then the creature will move to the selected
cell, otherwise an aerial attack will be made on the selected cell.

   The Fly spell is able to provide any creature with wings, however its
movement points won't be altered. The Wizard wings spell gives the
wizard the ability to fly in the range of an eagle.

   Flying movement can be temporarily impossible in the world if the
gravity sphere has been cast, or permanently for a creature if it is
the victim of a singular or dual earthbind spell.

Aerial attacks
--------------

   An aerial attack results when a flying creature is moved onto a cell

moved into the cell.

   A ground based creature can only move one cell at a time and you
must show the computer exactly how to move multiple cells by clicking
in each cell in turn. Many walking creatures can only move one cell
anyway. For those which can move more than one cell you should select a
sequence of adjacent cells -- you can abort the move at any time by
pressing the right mouse button.  During the course of a move a
creature may become engaged in which case it will move no further.

Combat
------

   Engaged creatures can take part in combat. You cannot attack your
team's creatures (but see @{"RangedCombat" Link "RangedCombat"}), unless the creature currently
moving has a negative combat ability, meaning the attack will actually
heal.  Living creatures cannot (normally) attack undead creatures,
otherwise anything goes. Once engaged, an attack is induced by clicking
on the cell containing the creature you wish to attack. If successful,
the defendant will be killed and the attacker will move onto the
corpse. For a successful kill of a strong opponent you may be awarded a
bonus spell.

   It is possible to attack inanimate objects and growths, although you
cannot get engaged to them. Be wary of killing growths with buried
creatures beneath, as the buried creature will be revealed and will
probably be quite hungry.

Ranged combat
-------------

   Some creatures such as elves, dragons, and wizards carrying bows,
have additional attacks. Such an attack is indicated by the @{i}sights
pointer@{ui}. Line of sight is required for most of these weapons. It is
possible to shoot your own creations or creations of your team members,
so choose your targets carefully. Occasionally it might be desirable to
kill one your own creatures due to insanity or disease (especially if
you are playing for points).

   Creatures which posess the @{i}archery@{ui} skill (such as the Wood Elf and
Gray Elf) do not need line of sight to shoot a target. Their shots
simply arch over any intervening obstacles. The Archery spell can give
the archery skill to creatures with some ranged combat ability, while
the Archerotomy will remove this skill.

Wizard movement
---------------

   Under normal circumstances the wizard can be moved like any other
creature.  However, wizards are capable of special movements. Wizards
can climb magic trees, enter castles, and ride certain creatures. For
convenience these activities are collectively called @{i}mounting@{ui}. You
cannot mount if you are engaged, otherwise mounting is effected by
simply moving the wizard onto the cell occupied by the entity you wish
to mount.

   Dismounting is somewhat more complicated as the computer needs to
distinguish which of the two entities is to be moved. For trees and
castles the computer will assume the wizard. For ridden creatures the
default is the creature. To dismount from a creature the following
sequence should occur:

   @{b}*@{ub} Select the creature the wizard is riding.

   @{b}*@{ub} Click on the `D' gadget at the top right of the screen (which will
     now be unghosted).

   @{b}*@{ub} Move the wizard to a cell adjacent to the creature (wizards with
     high movement allowance or wings still only move one cell when
     dismounting).

   Mounting is generally a good idea, as it hides the wizard from view
and gives the wizard additional protection.

   Once you have moved all creatures that you wish to, select the end

at the appropriate point in the sequence. After all wizards have moved
the independent creatures will be moved by the computer according to
the same rules.

   Finally, any wasp nests, ropers, fungi and anything else that has the
Special Combat Attribute will attack adjacent opponents.

   Note that some objects such as Pools, Apple Wood Trees, Hippocrates
and others have @{i}negative@{ui} special combat. This means their Special Combat

Identity
........

   This characteristic uniquely determines what the object is in the

(like a bipedal generator). This also determines the @{i}initial@{ui} value of
all other characteristics. When this object gets hit with the
Restoration spell, all its characteristics revert to their initial

   This is more a consequence of the ownership. It is determined by the

creatures cannot attack the undead, though there are numerous
exceptions such as the Imp, The Exorcist or any Wizard with a magic

Movement type
.............

   In the game creatures can move by flying or staying on the ground.
This statistic, which only makes sense for creatures, detemines the
type of movement for a particular object. Flying movement enables
special features like the ability to mount aerial attacks or, for most
flying creatures, the ability to see and map the world without need for

   This particular statistic indicates whether the wizard is able to

are mountable set 1 can be directly ridden by the wizard.  They range
from the Horse and Pegasus to the Magic Wood and the Shadow City.
Objects which are mountable set 2 can only be ridden by the wizard
after he has cast the Ride spell, as mounting them requires more
training.  They include all dragons, the hardy Elephant, the swift Bird
Lord and even the fearsome Tyrannasaurus Rex.  The mountability

Life force
..........

   Life Force is also known as "hit points".  This very important
characteristic determines the resistance of the object to physical
damage by combat, ranged combat, special combat, magic and poison.  If
the life force of an object becomes negative the object dies.  Normally
if the life force becomes 0, the object dies.  However, death by poison
requires that the life force drop to below 0 before death occurs.  The
life force of a corpse begins at 0 and is lowered when a scavenger eats
some of it.  When a corpse's life force reaches the negative of its
normal maximum, it is considered consumed and disappears from play.  A
recovery rate from -7 to 7 is available on each turn:  auto-healing
capabilities (when positive) or poison (when negative).  The Armor
spell can be used to raise the life force of a creature, and it can be
lowered by numerous other means.  Other spells or forms of combat (like
the bite of the Giant Rat) affect the recovery ability.

Magical resistance
..................

   All creatures are not equal when it comes to magic. Some are very
vulnerable to magic spells whereas others (not necessarily those which
are physically resistant) can show a very strong aptitude to resist
magical attacks. Usually a creature dies when its magical resistance,
which normally ranges from 0 to 7, becomes negative.  Certain
ultra-powerful spells such as Justice, Dark Power and Exorcism kill the
creature if they lower the magic resistance to 0.

   A recover rate from -7 to 7 is possible. The magical resistance of a
particular creature can be raised by the magic shield spell, which can
also be used to improve the recovery rate for magical resistance. The
spells which attack the magical resistance are many, and there are also
creatures which attack it like the Juju Zombie.

Manoeuvrability
...............

   Ranging from 0 to 15 with a maximum recovery of 7, this
characteristic (also called agility) determines the probability that
the creature gets engaged at the beginning of its movement phase when
an enemy is adjacent.  Creatures whose manoeuvrability is 0 are always
engaged while those whose manoeuvrability is 15 are never engaged and
can always escape a battle.  All creatures immediately become engaged
upon moving next to any enemy creature, regardless of their agility
rating.  The Command spell can be used to raise the agility of all the
creations of the casting wizard.  The Spectator, Python and a few other
creatures attack this statistic.

Intelligence
............

   The intelligence or stupidity of a creature in Chaos is measured
from 0 (very stupid) to 15 (most intelligent), with a recovery rate
from -7 to 7.  When the intelligence of a creature becomes negative, it
dies as the synaptic damage prevents its brain from maintaining its own
vital functions.  Intelligence can be raised by the Brain Boost spell
or lowered with the Brain Drain spell, among others. This
characteristic also determines the probability of success of
Subversion-like spells on the creature.  Certain creatures, such as the
Mind Flayer, attack this statistic.

Combat
......

   One of the most important statistics, combat reflects the ability of
a particular creature to cause damage to other objects in the world.
Possible values range from -15 to 15 with a recovery rate from -7 to 7.
Each time the creature attacks another object, its combat statistic is
subtracted from the target statistics of the attacked creature.  If the
combat statistic is negative, this means that the attack will in fact
heal the targetted creature (which can be an ally or an enemy).
However, creatures with positive combat cannot attack their allies.
This prevents simple mistakes of accidentally clicking on a friendly
creature and wounding it.  A variety of characteristics can be altered
by combat.  Usually this will be the life force but, for example, the
Arctic Wolf attacks simultaneously the life force, manoeuvrability and
movement points.  The combat ability can be magically raised for
example by the Combat spell, destroyed with Demonic Touch, or the
target statistic changed by the Poison Dagger spell.

Ranged combat
.............

   Some creatures have the ability to shoot missiles, such as arrows or
fire breath (like Red Dragons). This is indicated by a positive (from 1
to 15) ranged combat ability, which will be subtracted from the target
statistics of the targetted creature. A negative ranged combat ability
means ranged healing. This statistic can be magically altered by the
Range Boost spell or the Range Drain Beam. However, there is no direct
way to produce a generic creature which has no initial ranged combat
ability with this capacity. The wizard, however, can make use of the
Magic Bow and protect himself with the Reflector spell. A recovery rate

   This very special capability ranging from -15 to 15 is like combat
in that it attacks some characteristics of other creatures, but differs
in the way it is done. Special combat takes place after the movement
phase and possibly affects every surrounding object. It can also affect
allies as well as enemies, depending on the object possessing special
combat. Any creature can be given special combat through the Shocker

points from the corpse it's standing on as its scavengerism statistic
and add them to its own life force. When the life force of the corpse
reaches the negative of its initial value, the corpse is fully consumed
and disappears.  Some creatures such as the Dire Wolf, Arctic Wolf,

choosing the spell and the target. @{i}Some@{ui} of these rules can be read by
clicking on the @{b}?@{ub} gadget then on the icon of the spell to read about.
Or you can just press "q" on the keyboard while the mousepointer is
pointing at any spell or scroll.  "q" stands for "query" or "question
mark".

   This works on any spell in the casting wizard's spell list or any
scroll on the board.  With the right magic item it can even work on
enemy wizard's spell lists!

Probability
...........

   Not all spells are equally likely to happen in the game. The most
potent spells are generally very rare. This is determined by the
probability of each particular spell and the level of the spell caster.
The probability of a spell is expressed as a positive or negative
percentage. A spell with a probability of 0 never happens at all. A
spell with a probability of 99 is extremely common. Spells which have a
negative probability can only be obtained as BONUS spells, either when
a powerful object is killed in the game or when a meditation object
collapses while your wizard is inside it, and a few more cases. The
possibility of getting rarer spells increases when the spell caster
makes use of the Level spell.

...........

   This is the maximum number of cells the target may be away from the

Keys
====

   By pressing the number keys @{b}1@{ub}-@{b}9@{ub} the creations of the corresponding
player can be highlighted. Key @{b}9@{ub} highlights the independent creatures.
Creatures who have not moved are highlighted in a cycling color.
Creatures who have moved are highlighted in red. Allies are highlighted
in blue.

   Pressing @{b}q@{ub} for @{i}Query@{ui} is another way to bring up the information
screen for a creature. Once brought up you can press @{b}q@{ub} again to quit
the info screen or press any other key to continue on to the 2nd info
screen.

   Pressing @{b}c@{ub} for @{i}Cast@{ui} during the spellcasting phase will show all the
legal targets for the spell about to be cast. It takes into account all
the rules for spell casting such as range, line-of-sight, wizard
powerups and the exact type of thing in the target cell (growth,
creature, inanimate, etc.)

   Pressing @{b}m@{ub} for @{i}Move@{ui} shows all the legal moves that the currently
highlighted creature can make or if no creature is currently
highlighted then it shows the legal moves for the creature under the
mouse pointer. "Moving" includes "attacking" so often the cells of enemy
creatures will be highlighted (because it is legal for you to attempt to
move there) even though you perhaps don't have a snowball's chance in
hell of really killing the creature (e.g. orc vs. stone giant).

   Pressing @{b}r@{ub} for @{i}Range@{ui} shows all the cells that are within range of
the currently highlighted creature's ranged weapon or if no creature is
currently highlighted then it shows all cells that are in range of the
creature under the mouse pointer. @{i}Please note@{ui}: this shows all the cells
that are within range not all the cells that you can actually hit.
Many times the cells shown will be unshootable due to intervening
objects blocking line-of-sight or the fact that undeads cannot be shot
by living creatures.

   Pressing @{b}s@{ub} for @{i}Shoot@{ui} shows all the cells that can actually be shot
by the currently highlighted creature's ranged weapon or if no creature
is currently highlihgted then it shows all the cells that can actually
be shot by the creature under the mouse pointer. @{i}Please note@{ui}: this
takes into account line-of-sight and living/undead restrictions.

   Pressing @{b}l@{ub} for Line-of-Sight shows all the cells that can be seen by
the currently highlighted creature or if no creature is highlighted
then it shows all the cells that can be seen by the the cell under the
mouse pointer. This is particularly useful when you are thinking of
casting a spell that requires line-of-sight and you want to see if your
wizard can actually see the intended target. It is also good for
checking out where enemy wizards can/cannot see to so you can hide your
creatures behind walls and things to protect them from subversion,
betrayal, abduction, sleep, braindrain etc.

   Pressing SHIFT in combination with @{b}m@{ub}, @{b}r@{ub}, @{b}s@{ub} or @{b}l@{ub} will @{i}always@{ui} show the
relevent cells for the creature under the mouse pointer, regardless of
any currently highlighted creature.

Menus
=====

   The menus can only be used during the spell selection stage. They are
primarily concerned with loading and saving games, but it is also
possible to turn the speech on and off. The sound option is used to
switch off the sound while the independents move. Turn it off if you
want the game to go faster but be warned it is hard to follow what is
happening. There is also a menu option to view the current scores. The
ShowCast menu item is used to control the graphical effect used during
spellcasting. Turn it off if you want the game to go faster but be

Customizing the game
====================

   It is now possible to use your own creations in the game. This is
done by replacing some files in the Chaos directory. Be sure to keep a
copy of the original files !

Graphics
--------

   As 3.0 a new graphics system that uses standard iff pictures to
describe how monsters and magic spells and all other objects in the
game look has been introduced.

   Each object in the game has its own 320x256 64 color EHB mode iff
file.

   The name of the file is, and must be, the @{i}exact@{ui} name of the object in
English. The spaces must be there so don't try to rename them. All the
files are already included with the proper name in @{b}gfx/Spells/@{ub} so you
don't need to worry about this.

   All you have to do is edit any of the files you want and they will
automagically get included into the game. Unless for some reason the
clock in your Amiga is broken. In which case you may have to type in
the shell: @{b}delete gfx/dat/#?@{ub}

   That will delete the graphics index files and force the game to
rebuild them from scratch. It takes a full minute to rebuild all the
tiles from scratch because it must open and close 350 files + read in
350 files + decompress 350 files + cut and paste 731 tiles, check for
blank frames, etc. These numbers are only accurate as of July 25th,
2000. The numbers will be much larger in the future.

   If you change any graphic file then the next time you start the
game, it will notice that you have changed something and will rebuild
the tile indexes. This will take a full minute or more.

   Selecting @{b}New Game@{ub} from the menu is currently not sufficient to
reload the tiles. You must completely quit the game (exit to DOS or
WorkBench).  Then reload the game and all will be well. 8)

   The old 3 frame animation limitation has been @{i}ERADICATED@{ui}. You may
now draw or render as many frames as you like.

   The old 32-color limitation has been @{i}ERADICATED@{ui}. I couldn't think of
any conceivable reason why any strategy game should be limited to 32
colors.  All Amigas support 64 colors or more so we are going to use
them.

Ye Olde Rules for GrafixMages
-----------------------------

  0. The first 31 pixels at the top of the screen are ignored.

  1. All Living Creatures @{i}MUST@{ui} have a dead image! (Even if you just cut
     & paste in an image of a dead orc.) The leftmost tile is reserved
     for the dead image and only the dead image.

  2. All Inanimate Objects and Growths and Undeads must @{i}NOT@{ui} have a dead
     image. Its dead image space should be blank.

  3. You may have as many frames of animation as you like. Ping-Pong and
     continuous looping playback are both currently supported.

  4. In order to specify that you want your animation played in looping
     mode you must change the purple line at line 32 to be color #1.
     This tells the game to play this animation in a continuous loop.

  5. The animation frames are terminated by the first completely blank
     frame.

  6. The image must use the supplied palette. If you rearrange the
     palette for artistic reasons then you @{i}MUST@{ui} rearrange it back to
     its original state before saving the file. Failure to do this will
     result in wrong-looking graphics.

  7. If you want to leave extra grafix on the screen that you are
     working on then that's ok. They will be ignored. Only the tiles up
     to the first blank tile are processed by the game. Any extra gfx
     at the bottom of the screen are ignored.

Adding your own sound effects
-----------------------------

   Beginning with Chaos v2.81 it is very easy to add your own sound
effects into the game.

   Once you have a sound effect that you want in the game you must save
it as a @{b}.8svx@{ub} sound file.

   In the @{b}Chaos@{ub} game directory there is a @{b}Sounds/@{ub} directory. In that
dir are 3 other directories @{b}Combat/@{ub} @{b}Death/@{ub} and @{b}Kill/@{ub}.

   The @{b}Combat/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
attacks another in hand-to-hand combat.

   The @{b}Death/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
dies.

   The @{b}Kill/@{ub} directory contains the sounds that play when a creature
kills something.

   So let's say you have a really great sound that the Mind Flayer
should make when it attacks someone. Just put the sound effect into the
@{b}Combat/@{ub} directory under the name of @{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}. The filename of the
sound effect must @{i}EXACTLY@{ui} match the name of the creature in the game!
You @{i}MUST@{ui} use correct spacing and uppercase/lowercase letters.

   If you add new sounds in the middle of a game then you must quit the
game completely (exit back to workbench). Then restart the game and the
sounds will then be activated.

   If you have a sound that you would like to play when a Mind Flayer
dies then just put it in the @{b}Death/@{ub} directory with the name @{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}.

   If you have a sound that you would like to play whenever a Mind
Flayer kills something then put it in the @{b}Kill/@{ub} directory with the name
@{b}Mind Flayer@{ub}.

   Using this system you can implement special sounds for any and all
of the monsters in Chaos.

Improvements from 2.86 to 3.0
-----------------------------

   Enhanced graphics version !

  1. I have written a new graphics system that uses standard iff
     pictures to describe how monsters and magic spells and all other
     objects in the game look. This required LOTS of changes to the
     game executable (see the README file for details).

  2. BUG: When playing in exploration mode, if you try to examine an
     unexplored cell and the cell has a scroll in it then it lets you
     read the scroll! NOW FIXED.

  3. BUG: Joseph Conwell reports that he cast Sword of Sassenrath on
     his Orc and then when it promoted to Mighty Orc it lost its Sword
     of Sassenrath. JC: This is because it promotes to whichever stat
     is bigger. 0 > -1 so it makes sense. However I have now hacked in
     some extra code so that if you posess negative special combat then
     it will be promoted to whichever stat has the greatest absolute
     value. NOW FIXED.

  4. Put in Xav's new moon from setupscreen as Sanctuary. DONE. Put in
     Kreton's Wizard graphic as Wizard 1. DONE. Edit Generator. DONE.
     Remove blood from ShapeChanger. DONE. Spriggan is messed up. Fix
     him. DONE. Mess with Witches as new wizards. Leave this for Xav.
     Amphisbaena is all messed up. Leave this for Joe or Xav.

  5. Add in code to load the setupscreen1 from
     gfx/Screens/English/SetupScreen1.iff. DONE.

  6. Rewrite the setup code to have everything on SetupScreen1
     positioned correctly. This took some time because the name gadgets
     were overwriting the border. DONE.

  7. Add in code to load the setupscreen2 from
     gfx/Screens/English/SetupScreen2.iff  DONE.

  8. WOOPS!  I forgot to rewrite PutToSleep() to stop animating
     creatures that are asleep!  There is a sleeping Pegasus that is
     still flapping its wings like crazy!  NOW FIXED.

  9. Rewrite Flesh to Stone and Mass Petrification to properly stop the
     newly created inanimate object from being animated. DONE.

 10. Rewrite Stone to Flesh and Inanimorphobiosis to properly reactivate
     the animation on a previously-animated creature.  DONE.

 11. Put Xavier in the scrolling credits and the docs. DONE.

 12. FLAW: The pentagrams on the "About" screen are now invisible due
     to the new color palette! NOW FIXED.

 13. Add in code to load the EndTurn, Question Mark, Dismount, Load and
     Save gadgets from gfx/Gadgets/English/

 14. August 2, 2000: The size of the release executable file "chaos" is
     325816 bytes.  On July 25 it was 421048.  SAVED 95232 bytes!

 15. After converting all the gfx to IFF files, many spells looked
     horrible and I spent some time editing them.

 16. Included Joseph's improved Abath, Arborist, Alliance, Agathion,
     Azer, Apple Wood, Aviary. I totally redid Joe's Aviary and Apple
     Wood and Archerotomy.  Included Xav's improved: Agathion, Air
     Elemental, Acid Rain.

 17. Burstroem's Browser: Included Xav's book. Added more antialiasing
     to the bottom of the book. Included Joseph's new Bandit and
     Baboon. They are both MUCH better than the originals!

 18. Included Xav's Fantabulous Battle Cry! Included Xav's new
     Biohazard. I will use Joseph's Biohazard as something else.
     Included Joseph's new Bipedal Generator and Bodak. Edited Joseph's
     new Basalt Golem into an animation and included it.

 19. Exorcise: I simply replaced the old Exorcise graphic which wasn't
     so bad with a new one designed by Aes which is TOTALLY AWESOME! It
     has great shading in it!!! Oops its 2 pixels to tall and 2 pixels
     too wide! NOW FIXED!

 20. Inanimage and Inanimatologist look identical to a Wizard 1! I
     propose: Xav's Wizard 1 becomes Inanimage. Xav's Wizard 1 minus
     the wand becomes Inanimatologist. There will be a completely new
     wizard for Wizard 1. (I'll decide which graphic later on) This
     means the old Inanimage/Inanimatologist/Wizard 1 will be used for
     absolutely nothing! But I can assign him to be something later. I
     can also draw sparkles around the end of the wand.

 21. Magic Castle: The original was so so hopeless looking that I
     didn't bother trying to smooth it out.  I just replaced it with
     Xav's "Dark Castle".  The Dark Castle has a flaw: The Door and
     windows are made of the transparent black instead of the hard
     foreground black.  NOW FIXED.

 22. Ogre Warrior: The original Ogre Warrior was just a mirror image of
     the Ogre so that is how I did the new one. I just mirrored the
     Ogre and saved it.  This means the shadowing is actually
     backwards. But oh well... we can worry about that later. Maybe it
     will be funny to have a backwards shadow on him?

 23. Ogre Assasin: He's just like the Ogre Warrior but with a differnet
     animation sequence.  He has the backwards shadow as above.

 24. Oracle: Designed by Xav.  I brightened the crystal ball a bit and
     made it look like the Oracle's fingers were touching the crystal
     ball.  For the dead image I drew a crystal ball laying on the
     ground + pirated the dead image from Scavengerism.

 25. Added in Joseph's new: spectator, spriggan, speed, storm, sleep,
     skeleton, Hyperclone, Shocker. Shape Changer, Shadow, Magic
     Attack, Lich Lord, Leopard

 26. Put in Joseph's new: Joker, Justice (goatee), Iridium Horse (back
     leg), King Cobra (hood, now brown), Imp (more frames of
     animation), Hippocrates (now has a 2 pixel hat), Free All (now has
     3 keys instead of only 2), Dark Power (multi-shaded green), Aerial
     Servant (many frames of animation + different colors)

 27. Sent Eye for an Eye, Animate, Exophagy to Xav along with spell
     descriptions:  They came back looking unbelievably awesome!!!!!

 28. Xav's Telescope: I lightened the moon. Included Xav's Magic Bolt,
     Magic Glass, Mana Battery. Included Xav's amazingly great new:
     Shadow Wood, Dark Wood, Fir Tree, Magic Wood, Apple Wood. Included
     Xav's amazingly great new: Violet Fungi, Gooey Blob, Green Ooze,
     Orange Jelly, Fire, Flood, Earthquake.

 29. August 2, 2000: The size of the release executable file "chaos" is
     325816 bytes. On July 25 it was 421048. SAVED 95232 bytes!

 30. Many more graphics adjustments, see README for details.

 31. Sent v2.9 to Xav on August 2, 2000 so he can design gfx for it
     over his 2 weeks vacation.

 32. Put in Xav's fixed Wizard 2, Wizard 3 and Fly.  We still need 4
     female wizards.

 33. Included Xav's new: Ball Lightning, Basalt Golem, Bless, Charm,
     Clay Golem, Coercion, Cure, Dalek, Dao, Dark Wood, Death Bringer,
     Demonic Touch, Depth, Destroy Wall, Discard, Double, Elephant,
     Fireball, Freeze, Haste, Horse, Hyperclone, Irvine's
     Invulnerability, Justice, Lightning, Lion, Magic Bow, Meteor
     Storm, Moveit, Mullac de Irvine, Protection, Pyotechnics, Quickshot
     (quickshot is hard to read but I went ahead and included it
     anyway).  Radioactive Land, Recover Boost, Reflector, Replicate,
     Request, Reveal,

 34. Xav says to change the French spell desccription of Dark Citadel
     from Citadèle to Citadelle.  DONE.

 35. BUG: Mana Battery Scrolls give bonus spells just like a real Mana
     Battery.  NOW FIXED.

 36. BUG: 1 occurrence of "Brain Dead" was not using translated strings
     thus it was always appearing in English.

 37. August 15, 2000: Replaced all occurrences of "Run JCsound >NIL:"
     with "Run <>NIL: JCsound <>NIL:"

 38. Included Frédéric's new Français Spell Descriptions: Water
     Elemental, Sluggishness Beam and Combat Drain Beam.

 39. FD: Something strange happened when I cast consecrate on a higher
     devil sitting on the bottom border of the screen: the devil
     himself was not killed, of course, but the spell did extra sound
     effects, as if there had been creatures below. And I heard an
     allelujah sound, and at the end of the turn the bonus window
     opened. No victim, no "Other", but I had the choice of 1 spell
     among 31 !!! JC: The trouble was that the Drainer() function had
     NO error checking! Ack! all these years its been affecting cells
     that don't exist!  NOW FIXED.

 40. Sent all English and Français spell descriptions to Red|Blue in
     Quebec for proofreading. He liked the game "Romance of the 3
     Kingdoms" and "Bandit Kings of Ancient China" so I figure he'll
     like Chaos.

 41. FD: Due to impurities, a generator went asleep but continued to
     generate sleeping creatures. It's kind of strange don't you think
     ? Impurities shouldn't put generators to sleep ! They should only
     change their allegeance to a wizard or the independents (the
     sleeping creatures generated are often destroyed as soon as they
     are generated :-) ) JC: This sounds sooooooooooo hilarious!!!! I
     don't know how you find all this weird stuff out!!!!
     hehehehhahahahahahah 8) It sounds so funny I'm not going to change
     it. I've never seen it happen before! And if it does happen it must
     be very rare. I probably should fix it so that it doesn't change
     to dead wizards... either that or let creatures move, even if they
     belong to a dead wizard. FD: That would be a good enhancement. And
     change the dead revenge so that dead players keep control of the
     generated creatures.

 42. NEW FEATURE: I have now adjusted the code, such that if a creature
     exists who belongs to a dead wizard, the creature will still be
     moved as usual.

 43. DEAD REVENGE IMPROVED: I have now adjusted the code such that a
     wizard who is killed while posessing the Dead Revenge powerup will
     not lose ANY of his generators! The wizard will die, but his
     generators will live on! And any creatures produced by the
     generators will be controllable by the player! I forsee this as
     being strategically important primarily in multiplayer games where
     a certain wizard may be killed first, but can still have some
     influence in the game due to his generated creatures. For years I
     haven't even bothered casting Dead Revenge because it just didn't
     really seem to benefit me; there were always better spells to
     cast. Now however, I will always try to cast Dead Revenge!

 44. EDITED Dead Revenge spell description.

 45. BUG: I have found a strange bug in the game related to the chaos
     lord and fire. It could be the fire shield (and possibly other
     shields) that's not working. My wizard (an undead chaos lord, by
     the way, with shocker) was covered by its own fire breathed by one
     of my 3 platinum dragons, but it did not die !!! I destroyed the
     fire with another platinum dragon breath, and I could see a very
     very strange animation, alternating: my wizard (wizard 1), a grey
     elf (previouly dead) and the dead grey elf. I guess this is
     because the fire had 3 animation frames... ? When I query the
     stats, everything is back to normal chaos lord stats, except for
     life force who's back to 19. No wait ! There's another big strange
     difference ! It's Wizard 1 belonging to nobody ! And it moved and
     attacked (but only shot once instead of three) with the
     independents ! He killed my cats ! What a strange creature !
     Actually it moves between me and my cats (I have the cat lord),
     not with the independents. JC: ok, I have investigated this and it
     all comes down to this: Fire Shield and Flood Shield DO NOT WORK!
     Ack! All these years Fire Shield and Flood Shield have not been
     working! NOW FIXED.

 46. Included Frédéric's new English and Français spell descriptions
     for Power Walls and Webs.

 47. FLAW: When a Tempest kills something, it doesn't make the dying
     noise and it doesn't print any text message either. It just sort
     of disappears. NOW FIXED.

 48. Garbage appears in the french translation when I have reveal in my
     spell list and the mouse pointer is over it. I get something like
     "RévélerÜF\«J". I looked at the "Reveal" description file but
     it seems ok to me... ? This only happens with this spell. JC: It
     is the very last spell. The very last spell wasn't being
     NULL-terminated. NOW FIXED.

 49. FD: When a creature has a negative combat statistic, it can heal
     other creatures. But the "m" key does not show it can move over
     friendly creatures to heal them. JC: NOW FIXED.

 50. BUG: If you shoot and kill your own wizard, when you end your turn,
     sometimes various random enforcer hits happen and always various
     random bits of memory get corrupted. This was caused by
     MoveWizard() being performed on a dead wizard so it thinks the wiz
     is in cell -1 which causes many illegal mem accesses. NOW FIXED.

 51. Included Xav's new Singular Earthbind, Dual Earthbind, Dragon Nest
     and Goblin / Goblin Bomb.

 52. BUG: The archery effect randomly locks up the entire computer
     (sometimes).  I theorize that sometimes task switching kicks in
     right in the middle of a OS WritePixel() call such that
     WritePixel() starts out using rastPort with a layer and ends up
     using a rastPort without a layer (or vice versa).  And this
     somehow makes the OS go insane and crash. So how should I fix
     this? A) Add an ObtainSemaphore() ReleaseSemaphore() pair to the
     archery code? B) Comment out that layers disabling code in the
     animator task? I am choosing option B for the following reasons:
     1. I don't ever want this bug to happen again! Someday someone
     might code a new routine that does writes or reads from rastPort
     without getting a lock on &Board first! Then the bug will be back!
     2. I don't have time to fiddle around chasing silly bugs like this
     so we'll just have to settle for an animator task that is now 10%
     to 15% slower. 3. Now that I've implemented the fix, THAT
     MYSTERIOUS BLUE LINE THAT KEPT RANDOMLY APPEARING ON THE LEFT HAND
     SIDE OF THE BOARD IS GONE FOREVER! NOW FIXED!

 53. BUG: Strange blue line randomly appears on the left side of the
     board.  NOW FIXED (see above).

 54. PROBLEM: Using default settings the music is playing during the
     bonus spell selection panel.  This causes JCsound to fail.  This
     doesn't hurt anything but it is disconcerting to the user to see
     messages in the cli window that say "ChaosDigitalSoundSubProcess
     failed returncode 150" so I have now changed the bonus spell panel
     to not attempt to play any sound effects if the music is playing.
     NOW FIXED.

 55. Included Xav's Abduction graphic (the one with the flying saucer).
     The only trouble is that the Abduction spell doesn't really
     abduct anyone.  Abduction should really be renamed as BrainWashing
     or something.  "Abduction" should be the same as Vanish but I
     can't think up a way to make it be different from Vanish. (?)

 56. Included Joseph's new Eagle (2 extra frames), Skeleton (Added a
     few new frames), Dragon Nest (He thought it looked to much like a
     friendly little fireplace so he made it round.  It is now an
     interdimensional "portal"), Pegasus (1 extra frame), Crocodile
     (fixed the feet).

 57. FLAW: A Range Boosted or Aesculapiused Goblin loses some ability
     when killing an Archer and picking up the bow.  NOW FIXED.

 58. Included Xav's new Français setup screen I and II into the game.

 59. FLAW: If a person doesn't have narrator.device installed then the
     game won't play.  I have now removed all narrator.device
     dependencies so this is NOW FIXED.

 60. ADDED a new code module prefs.c to Load and Save user preferences
     in a plain ASCII file.  I just hacked and slashed sm.c into
     prefs.c.  This ended up still being a lot of work.  Over 1200
     lines of code.

 61. New menu option: "Save Prefs"

 62. Changed Français info panel Tirer -> Tir.

 63. FD: "If you want to read about a spell, point at it and press "q"
     for Query." I let it as is, but there's something you should be
     aware of: in the french keymap, I must press "a" instead of "q" to
     get info. But this can change also for other french-speaking
     countries. What you should do is use the keymap.library (in ROM)
     to revert the wanted character into a wanted keypress, so that the
     letter can be correct in all keymap configurations. JC: Ok I did
     this and tested it and it works. NOW FIXED.

 64. PROBLEM: Now that we have improved pearl.font for Chaos there can
     be a problem. If a person already has the old pearl.font installed
     and is using it in his workbench or CED or whatever, then it will
     already be loaded.  Thus when Chaos attempts to load "pearl.font"
     it will load their old unimproved version since it is already in
     memory. Therefore I have now renamed pearl.font -> ChaosPearl.font
     and ran fixfonts on it. NOW FIXED.

 65. Made documentation directories.  Copied the quickstarts into them.

 66. Added #?.prefs and Documentation/ all to MakeDemoOfChaos.txt

 67. BUG: Justice randomly does the following: A: Doesn't work. B:
     Works C: Works but then awards a bonus spell on a creature that
     isn't supposed to give a bonus spell. An innocent-looking routine
     was in fact the work of EVIL. It was causing all the random errors
     of Justice, Dark Power, Vengeance, Exorcise etc. There is a ;
     missing from the end of the first line therefore the 2nd line was
     never being executed. NOW FIXED.

 68. New IFF gadget loading code: Each gadget will be an IFF brush. I
     must load each of these brushes into an image struct. 1. Open the
     IFF-file. 2.  Determine its x and y size. 3. Allocate the memory
     for that 4. Read it in and set up the struct Image for it. 5. Poke
     these values into the gadget struct.

 69. Included Xav's new French versions of the Start and Quit gadgets.

 70. The game is now 99% playable in French.  Everything except the
     menus and docs has been translated.

 71. Added in those 2 gadgets for the hires screen.

 72. REMOVED the old hardcoded TickImage and CrossImage from
     Init.c/Init.h

 73. I antialiased Xav's new rotating Generator and included it into
     the game.

 74. Version 3.0 completed on September 20th, 2000.

Improvements from 2.85 to 2.86
------------------------------

  1. Replaced EndTurn.8svx with Frédéric's EndTurn.8svx because
     nobody liked the old end turn sound.  I renamed the old
     EndTurn.8svx to MaxCombat.8svx and changed the game code to play
     this sound anytime anyone casts a spell that makes a creature have
     maximum combat.  This means the following spells: Combat, Touch of
     God, Chaos Lord.

  2. Translation of IP1 (Information Panel 1) Creature Statistics
     Screen to: Français. Scavenge translates to Charognardise which
     is _entirely_ too long. So I'm leaving this in English. Someday
     when we make the AGA version this can be changed to the
     "Scavengerism" spell icon, which looks quite nice. Magic
     Resistance translates to Résistance magique which is too long.
     Résistance magique -> Résist. magique Ranged Combat translates
     to Combat à distance which is too long.

  3. Reduced the amount of time that the horrible looking circular
     pattern is displayed on the lissa-box requester things. Reduced it
     to 1/3 of its old value.

  4. ADDED Multingual talklists code so that now the game can use
     talklists of any supported language.

  5. The dir structure of certain things in Chaos has now changed. The
     Screens/ dir and TalkListsDir/ have changed. So any further
     updates issued need to be COMPLETE updates, not just the
     executable file. Possibly other things in the dir structure or
     file structure have changed also.

  6. FLAW: Touch of God and Chaos Lord do not do any sort of graphical
     effect!  So you cannot tell who it is being cast on! NOW FIXED.

  7. PROBLEM: The req.library filerequester is optimized for use on
     non-interleaved bitmaps. This means the scrolling sucks bigtime on
     the chaos interleaved bitmaps. It colorflashes horribly. It goes
     from having the best scrolling of any filerequester to suddenly
     having the worst scrolling of any filerequester. So I opened up
     yet another new screen. This one is just like the old HiResScreen
     only it is noninterleaved. Now the scrolling looks fast and smooth
     again! NOW FIXED.

  8. LOAD/SAVE screens now have smooth scrolling once again.

  9. Fixed Passage description.

 10. Copied the entire gamedir over to Chaos_2.9/ so that I may now
     begin work on the Enhanced Graphics Version on Tuesday, July 25th,
     2000.

Improvements from 2.84 to 2.85
------------------------------

  1. FD: It seems to me that growths eventually stop growing, sometimes
     after a single turn. JC: NOW FIXED.

  2. FD: I have noticed very recently (between 2.83 and 2.84) that some
     growths tend to stop growing very rapidly. I once cast an orange
     jelly and it never grew at all ! JC: NOW FIXED.

  3. FD: Sometimes Hippocrates or Aesculapius randomly kills one of my
     creatures with his healing Special Combat. JC: I finally figured
     this out! It happened randomly because it was caused by the
     Impurities code! The real bug was: BUG: With Impurities turned on,
     healing special combat sometimes kills the creature being healed!
     NOW FIXED!

  4. FD: When a cloaked wizard who as scavengerism is scavenging a
     corpse, it says "Wizard 4 munches on a corpse of cloaked creature"
     ! JC: This was a simple matter where I switched my variables. NOW
     FIXED.

  5. FD: Sometimes when a wizard is "killed" by
     justice/vengeance/exorcise in an unexplored region and is
     reinstated, his position is revealed (the cell he's in becomes
     empty for the duration of the "bonus spell" sound). JC: This was a
     bug whereby DrawCell(&NothingImage,cell); was being used instead
     of the correct ReDrawCell(cell); DrawCell() just blindly draws
     graphics into cells without taking into account exploration mode.
     ReDrawCell() knows about exploration mode and acts accordingly.
     NOW FIXED.

  6. FD: The wizard that wouldn't die bug: Wizard 5 has 1 life point
     and -2 recovery. Each time he's attacked, it dies (allelujah
     sound, but no wizard dying sound). The cell is left blank but the
     wizard is still there if I move the mouse pointer over it. It can
     be attacked again and the same happens. The cell is eventually
     refreshed and the wizard reappears. I think he cast Lich lord
     during his first life but the lich lord icon is not in the list of
     his powerups now. He was killed at least 15 times by the
     independents ! JC: Ok, this had nothing to do with Lich Lord. This
     was caused by the fact that the wizard had cast Horror on himself.
     Each time he was killed the Horror code kicked in and tried to
     replicate him, but there were no empty adjacent cells. So he
     wasn't actually replicated and the Horror was not actually used up
     and he didn't actually die. I have now changed it such that: 1) If
     this happens again, the Horror gets used up. So it will only
     happen once. 2) It now prints a text message and does a graphical
     effect to indicate that the Horror process is happening. 3) It
     sets Life, Magic Resistance, Intelligence, Manuverability and
     Combat to maximum. Move gets set to max(CurrentMove,InitialMove).
     This is to make up for the fact that it didn't get to replicate.
     NOW FIXED. Tested and works ok.

  7. FD: When the independents (but it may also happen for other teams,
     I don't know) kill a wizard, the word "Independents" at the bottom
     of the screen is erased just after the dying-wizard animation, and
     the movement phase continues without "Independents" to be
     reprinted.  JC: NOW FIXED.

  8. FD: An evil wizard cast meddle but the following creatures were not
     affected: The exorcist, earth elemental. Is it because they have no
     reincarnation ? JC: Yes. FD: Why wouldn't the exorcist reincarnate
     into a bandit or an orc ? He was set to not reincarnate into
     anything. I have now changed The Exorcist so that he reincarnates
     into a good little Halfling.

  9. FD: A wizard destroyed a white dragon corpse with a magic bolt and
     the dragon cried ! It's an old bug you told me was allegedly fixed
     :-) JC: OOPS! I put the "and !isDead(b) and !isScroll(b)" code on
     1 of the lines that needed it but I forgot to put it on the other
     line that needed it!  doh! NOW FIXED.

 10. Score Screen has now been translated into Français. I added in a
     teensy amount of code for stringwidth sensitivity so that the
     screen looks good in English and Français. I'll probably have to
     add more code when the game is translated to other languages. I
     only added in the bare minimum amount to make the Français score
     screen look good.

 11. SMALL BUGS: Microscopically small even 8) The following spells
     would, in exploration mode, reveal the position of the target for
     a brief instant by drawing a blank image in the target cell.
     However, this blank image was immediately redrawn properly.
     Apparently nobody ever noticed this small flaw. It affected the
     following spells: Armour, Brain Boost, Cloak, Combat, Cursed
     Sword, Magic Shield, Meteor Storm, Recover Boost, Restoration,
     Sword of Sassenrath, Scavengerism and Exophagy. NOW FIXED.

 12. ALL appropriate occurrences of DrawCell() have now been replaced
     with ReDrawCell()  I systematically went through the entire
     program and did this.  DONE.

 13. 1st and 2nd Spell Information Panels have now been 100% translated
     into Français.

 14. Replaced all appropriate occurrences of player_name[x] with
     PlayerName(x) in the entire program + coded the PlayerName()
     routine to handle the multilingual translation issues. This took 1
     hour.

Improvements from 2.83 to 2.84
------------------------------

  1. CHANGED Cartography to immediately explore the cells during the
     casting phase in the same way that I already changed Telescope and
     Seismology.

  2. INSTALLED the new ChaosCalligraphy.font which has been modified by
     Frédéric to include (all?) international characters of Western
     European alphabets.  Most notably ¿¡ñÑ éèêëæ ÉÈÊËÆ
     çÇ etc.

  3. FD: I cast betrayal on a bolter wall and it said the spell
     succeeded. But the bolter wall still belonged to the same player.
     JC: This has always been possible. If Betrayal succeeds then a new
     player is randomly chosen. In your case it randomly chose the same
     player as before. I have now changed it so that if the spell
     succeeds then the target WILL change owners. NOW FIXED.

  4. FD: Sometimes the old EndOfTurn sound is played at the end of a
     turn, instead of the sound from file "EndTurn.8svx". I did not
     find a condition for this to happen. JC: This happened only when
     someone had previously cast Move It. NOW FIXED.

  5. FD: When I begin a game in exploration mode (as player 1 or 8,
     never mind), the position of player 3 is shown to me before
     disappearing again. ? JC: This one took me a while to figure out.
     In the beginning of the game I changed the PlayerView to 15 so
     that way absolutely nothing would be shown since there is no
     player 15. But the Team[] only has 12 elements! (0-11) so Team[15]
     was actually accessing into TeamSettings[3] (which keeps a backup
     copy of the team settings so that alliances and seperations don't
     mess up the setup screen) Of course TeamSettings[3] is going to
     equal 3 unless you change the Teams on the setup screen. So the
     game thought that player 15 was on Team 3 and thus would show you
     player 3's position at the start of the game. So how do I fix
     this? A: Expand the Team[] and TeamSettings[] array. This requires
     a change to the savegame format and I would have to convert all
     the old levels to the new format. B: I could just not change the
     view to be 15 at the beginning. I could change it to the 1st human
     player, (since he will get the 1st real view anyway) or I could
     change it to the DEADP player. Option B is easiest. I will just
     change the view to the DEADP player. This will work perfectly
     until the game starts randomly distributing dead bodies across the
     map at the beginning of the game. This will probably never happen
     so it should never be an issue. NOW FIXED

  6. FD: I cast the cat lord, and I had already a lion. I was able to
     control the lion and attack a harpy with it. Then, after I clicked
     end-of-turn, the cat lord controlled the lion and attacked the
     harpy again. NOW FIXED.

  7. FD: A wizard has scavengerism but he's cloaked and the sentence
     say he is a wizard munching on some brown bear carcass. I think it
     should say "cloaked creature" instead of wizard. NOW FIXED.

  8. FD: A leopard corpse mewed when it was destroyed by a fireball !
     Corpses really shouldn't make any sound :-) NOW FIXED.

  9. FD: I'm able to control the solar and make it attack before it
     attacks on his own ! NOW FIXED.

 10. HORRIBLE LOCKUP BUG WITH "Repulsion" sound. FD: Sometimes the game
     locks up and makes the Repulsion sound. JC: This same bug was
     reported by JJ several times over the last few months but the
     details were so sketchy that I had no way to track it down and fix
     it. 10 days later after countless hours of playtesting by
     Frédéric using the JC modified version of Chaos which generates
     logfiles of its actions, I was finally able to track down this
     horrible bug!! What the actual bug was: Basic Explanation:
     Anything that caused the TELEPORTIN or TELEPORTOUT cell effects to
     be used would lock up in an infinite loop making sound. Since a
     simple sound played in a loop is what the "Repulsion" sound is,
     this sounds very similar to the Repulsion spell sound. Specific
     Explanation: IF you were playing in exploration mode and any of
     the following things happened then the game would lock up. A) A
     roper teleported to a new location. B) A creature changed sides
     due to impurities. C) Any Wizard used the Passage spell. D) Any
     Wizard used the Teleport spell. E) Any wizard cast Pyrotechnics or
     Storm and it actually hit a creature. F) Any Haunt spontaneously
     changed sides. G) Any Wizard cast the Pox spell on something. NOW
     FIXED!!! So the reason the lockup bug seemed to only happen when
     you played with lots of enemy wizards and with growths on the
     screen was because, the more stuff on the board, the more of a
     chance of Impurities cause an alleigance change.

 11. BUG: When I'm in alliance with another wizard, I can see the
     regions he has explored. However, when a creature is moving in
     these regions, it is not highlighted.  JC: This bug was a simple
     typographical error in the code.  NOW FIXED.

 12. FD: About the bug in inamorphobiosis you fixed. I thought the same
     problem could arise when a wizard mounts a cat (lion, jaguar etc)
     thanks to "Mount" and another player casts the cat lord. Did you
     consider this case ? JC: I just changed it so that Cat Lords
     cannot take control of mounted cats. NOW FIXED.

 13. FD: After Joker, I got "Wizard 7" on my list ! Is this normal ?
     JC: Well, the way Sean programmed it, it could give you any spell,
     even spells with 0 probability. I have now changed it so that it
     will not give you spells of 0 probability. NOW FIXED.

 14. FD: I had triple in effect and my marid cast violet fungi. It
     logically cast it three times, but all at the same place, one on
     another. This should be considered stupid ! JC: NOW FIXED.

 15. FD: I first got Burstroem's Browser today. I cast it and began to
     peek at other wizards spell lists. When I play with Texas
     Trash'em, I can peek at others spell list when I have already
     picked a spell to cast and the game is waiting for me to discard
     another one. However, when I get back to my list, the spell I had
     picked to cast is displayed again. JC: NOW FIXED.

 16. FD: When a growth is hit with "No grow", it becomes inanimate, so
     the animation should be stopped. JC: NOW FIXED.

 17. CHANGED: Each Wizard now has a unique name!  Instead of 8
     creatures with the name "Wizard", we now have "Wizard 1", "Wizard
     2" etc.  This was neccessary so that each wizard can have its own
     unique sound files and graphic files.

 18. BUG: A scroll of a Cat Lord takes control of the cats and makes
     them belong to NOBODY!  NOW FIXED.

 19. CHANGED: Inanimage is now only half as likely to cast
     Inanimorphobiosis or Mass Petrification as he is likely to cast
     any of his other spells.

 20. CHANGED Ghoul: The description of the Ghoul says that it feeds on
     others so I have now changed it so that it has Exophagy and +2
     Scavenging as per Frédéric's request.

 21. Double-attacking BUG: Independent creatures and the creatures of
     computer-controlled wizards get to move and/or attack twice if
     they have more than 10 movement points and are not engaged. NOW
     FIXED.

 22. BUG: Independent creatures and the creatures of
     computer-controlled wizards accrue approximately .24 free movement
     points for each diagonal movement made. NOW FIXED.

 23. BUG: A computer-controlled wizard who is mounted on an inanimate
     object (such as a centaur that has been hit with Flesh to Stone)
     can still attack and shoot if the centaur is "engaged". NOW FIXED

 24. BUG: Animate affects scrolls of inanimate objects! NOW FIXED!

 25. FD: I cast "no grow" on my own gooey blob so that I get many
     creatures when I subsequently cast "animate". However, it didn't
     work: I still have my petrified gooey blob. We should either: say
     the spell only works for trees, or make it affect more inanimate
     objects (including those petrified by flesh to stone, for example
     make them creatures again). JC: I changed it so that now it
     affects petrified growths. NOW FIXED. Also it didn't affect
     Ropers. Now it does.

 26. FD: When the mount of a wizard is killed, it leaves no corpse
     behind. JC: NOW FIXED.

 27. FD: When a creature kills a growth covering a scroll, it does not
     move over the scroll. JC: NOW FIXED.

 28. FD: Desire: on the second setup screen, add the GFLG_TABCYCLE (cf
     Intuition/Intuition.h) to the string gadgets so that one can move
     between all the string gadgets without using the mouse. JC: DONE.
     I also implemented it on the 1st setup screen. TABCYCLE feature
     added in honor of Frédéric Delacroix, who earned the "Playtester
     of the Month Award" for June 2000.

 29. FD: Suggestion: Convert could be cast on the inanimate so that it
     can be used to destroy dark wood. (An enemy of mine is an arborist
     and cast a line of dark woods close to me). JC: DONE. Convert
     spell description updated.

 30. FD: There is an independent solar but it never moves or attack !
     JC: NOW FIXED. Tested and works perfectly.

 31. Font bugs! Font in start/quit gadgets is wrong. It is using a
     system default font. Font in Menus is wrong. It is using a system
     default font.  Font inside the filerequester is wrong. It is using
     a system default font.  Font in text gadgets on setup 1 is Topaz!
     The solution is to have a PearlFont8TextAttrForOpenDiskFont that
     says "ChaosGame:fonts/pearl.font" and a seperate
     PearlFont8TextAttrForIntuition that says "pearl.font". NOW FIXED.

Improvements from 2.82 to 2.83
------------------------------

  1. Hidden Horror + Reincarnation Bug Report by Frédéric: I had cast
     reincarnation on my hidden horror so as to get a golden dragon
     when it came close to that combat-enhanced enemy wizard (like this
     is said in the hidden horror description), but I only got a red
     dragon. NOW FIXED.

  2. Added in some code to read in all the catalog files.

  3. REPLACED most of the text in the game with an appropriate call to
     Message() which gives the correctly translated string according to
     the currently selected language.

  4. PROOFREAD, corrected & edited Frédéric's new doc sections on
     creature statistics and spell statistics.

  5. Catalog translation problems: 1: French grammar is backwards when
     compared with English grammar so my catalogs are useles. But the
     solution is VERY easy, simply make use of the new sprintf() (or
     related) routine in the Amiga OS that allows the translator to
     switch the orders of the parameters around using positional
     notation such as %1$s %2$s %3$ld.  New Tsprintf routine is simply
     an asm routine that calls RawDoFmt() with a function parameter to
     store the chars in a buffer. WHY OH WHY doesn't RawDoFmt() default
     to sprintf string-storing when supplied with a NULL function
     parameter? This asm routine came straight out of the RKRM example
     listed under RawDoFmt() This should solve all the @{i}current@{ui}
     translation problems. Other translation problems will be dealt
     with later.

  6. I went through and added numeric positioning information to EVERY
     string that had more than 1 parameter.

  7. I basically copied the prototype from sprintf() in stdio.h to use
     as the prototype for Tsprintf(). Though first I compiled the game
     as a test with no prototype for Tsprintf() and no warnings or
     errors were generated! I assumed the game would just crash so I
     didn't try to play it like that till added the prototype and did
     smake clean smake.

  8. Decide how to handle spellnames? Why not handle it exactly the
     same as I handle Message(); ? Yes, exactly like I handle Message,
     excellent. Ok, but how do I read them in? If I could somehow make
     a list of all English spellnames. This is easy. duh. I have a list
     of all English spellnames. Its built into the game! This is all
     useless! I need French names of OBJECTS in the game, not french
     names of english names.  Now go through each name in the this list
     and open up that filename in each language/ dir and dig out the
     language/ version of it and put it into an array! Easy! DONE.

  9. Make a CreatureName() macro that returns the creature_name of the
     creature in the currently selected language. DONE.

 10. Go through the entire game and replace all appropriate occurrences
     of creature_name[x] with CreatureName(x) except the ones in
     editor.c. I'll worry about that later. Certain occurrences of
     creature_name[x] specifically must NOT be replaced because they
     are dealing with files (sound files, text files, etc.) and those
     files must always be named according to their english name. DONE.

 11. Check the date of the LanguageSpellnames.txt against the date of
     the dir Language/  If the dir is newer then it means something has
     changed and the text files must be rebuilt.  So if the Language/
     dir is newer than the LanguageSpellnames.txt file or the
     EnglishSpellnames.txt file or the English/ dir then it must be
     rebuilt.  Additionally, if the English .txt file  gets rebuilt
     then they must ALL get rebuilt because it might mean some new
     spells have been added.

 12. PROBLEM: It takes several seconds to open/read/close the 350 files
     required to read in the translated spellnames. (And its only doing
     Français now!  That will be over a whole minute when all
     languages are done.) So I optimized it such that the list only
     needs to be rebuilt if someone has changed something in one of the
     descriptions.  NOW FIXED.

 13. TRANSLATED SPELLNAMES ARE NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL.

 14. Changed "Hungarian" -> "Magyar".

 15. June 17, 2000: Received Frédéric's registration. He is now
     inducted as a junior member of Team Chaos and assumes all
     privileges and resposonsibilities associated therewith. He is also
     Chief Executive Vice President in Charge of Français Translation,
     Français Font Editing and also English and Français AmigaGuide
     Electronic Hypertext Documentation.

 16. Saturday, June 17th, 2000: I loaded my very first IFF graphic file
     into t he game and displayed it. AMAZING! All these years I've
     never once loaded a graphics file into one of my programs! Though
     I have loaded IFF sound files for many many years.

 17. FD: Saving does not work ! I launched Chaos from the shell and got
     messages like c/lha: unknown option - 3 each time the game tried
     to save the current game (either autosave or requested save). I've
     finally found why lha complains about the -3 option: it was in my
     ENV:LHAOPTS file, to automatically select the best compression
     algorythm. However, the old lha version supplied with chaos does
     not know of this option. The ideal solution would be that you use
     the -I option when you call lha from Chaos, this will cause lha to
     ignore the LHAOPTS environment variable. JC: Ok, I changed lha to
     use -qaI when being called from Chaos. NOW FIXED.

 18. FD: I cast abduction and it abducted a poison dagger scroll ! And
     it did reveal itself as I was trying exploration mode :-) JC: NOW
     FIXED

 19. FD: The proportionnal font you use in the info screens does not
     know of accented letters !! This makes french descriptions for
     spells totally unreadable ! For example "Dévastation" becomes
     "Dvastation" ! JC: I know all about this. You are in charge of
     translation so you are supposed to fix this.

 20. FD: The special combat ability provided by Aesculapius does not
     target anything ! I think special combat should have a default
     stat target even if the creature has no special combat at all
     (like range combat). Moreover this special combat targets my own
     creatures too ! JC: This was a simple problem of not enclosing my
     #define in () NOW FIXED. Aesculapius no longer gives people
     Special Combat.

 21. FD: "Independent vulture eats some brown bear cadaver. Life +d"
     Seems the %d thing does not work. JC: This is a problem with that
     stupid OS sprintf not working with long parameters. It only works
     with words! It has already caused me many many problems and this
     is the whole reason why it took me soooo long to do the
     translation coding. Anyway this particular sentence is NOW FIXED.

 22. FD: I've found another minor bug: when I cast alternography and
     restart the game, the alternography is not reset and remains
     active. JC: NOW FIXED

 23. FD: "Asleep's wizard munches on some manticore's cadaver. Life +d."
     Asleep's wizard ??? This should not exist (it is not a fake
     wizard)!  Moreover, asleep creatures should not eat anymore ! JC:
     Well, there was a bug whereby any scavenger that was asleep or
     dead or a scroll would still scavenge any dead bodies that it was
     on top of. NOW FIXED.

 24. FD: Providing someone with a telescope does not increase his
     mapping of his own position in the world until he moves. Too bad
     if that creature is engaged. Maybe the telescope spell should
     update the explored cell for the recipient creature. This update
     should also happen when a creature blocking line of sight moves,
     revealing some parts of the world. Maybe a good place to do this
     is board update. Reply from JC: 1: Its a rule: if you are engaged
     then you can't map the world. You are too busy defending yourself
     to have time to draw maps. 2: Furthermore its a rule that if your
     creature doesn't move then it doesn't map anything. Thus, a
     creature that never moves will never map anything. 3: I have been
     thinking of changing the Telescope and Seismology spells such that
     they give results immediately upon casting. Since you asked for
     this I went ahead and implemented it. So from now on if you cast
     Telescope or Seismology you will IMMEDIATELY (in the casting
     phase) map new areas.

 25. FIXED description of Solar.

 26. CHANGED: Aesculapius scrolls are now always buried.

 27. CHANGED: Touch of God, Chaos Lord, Iridium Horse and Aesculapius
     scrolls are now only 1/3 as probable as other scrolls.

Improvements from 2.81 to 2.82
------------------------------

  1. IMPLEMENTED all of Frédéric's spell-description
     corrections/clarifications for all spells beginning with the
     letters F to Z. Including complete rewrites of Magic Attack, Magic
     Bolt, Ice Breath, Lightning, X-Ray and Fireball. DONE.

  2. CHANGED Pythons so they attack Life Force + Manuverability.

  3. ADDED a new "Language" menu option with English, Français,
     Hungarian, Deutsch, Español and Italiano options. All options are
     mutually exclusive.

  4. ADDED some text to print when a promotion happens.

  5. ADDED some text to print when an Orc/Goblin/Troll gets a bow.

  6. ADDED some text to print when the game is AutoSaving.

  7. Range Boost didn't work on a Wizard with a Magic Bow. NOW FIXED.

  8. JJ doesn't like the digital sound effects and wants a "Combat
     Sounds" on/off feature. This took me 2 hours. 1 hour to do it and
     and 1 hour to debug it due to lame C STUPIDITY. I wrote IF
     (MENUCombatSound) and the compiler generated NO ERRORS! But there
     is no variable called MENUCombatSound!!!!! And it didn't call the
     FUNCTION MENUCombatSound() either! It just always evaluated the
     nonexistent variable as TRUE so the sounds were ALWAYS ON no
     matter what I did. NOW FIXED.

  9. INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT ADDED! (Only for Spell
     Descriptions) IT WORKS GREAT! Currently the only languages
     supported are English, Français and Hungarian. The font still
     needs to be edited to contain accented characters, this is
     Frédéric's department.

 10. ELIMINATED all those stupid spell+1 and spell- and spell+=1
     constructs from SpellInformation().  This was all caused by
     PoolPos requiring a spellnumber-1 instead of a real spellnumber!
     NOW ALL FIXED!

 11. ENFORCER HIT BUG! Selecting "Scores" from the Menu somehow
     corrupts the value of the Global Variable "Language" and sets it
     to 8. Then anything that uses the Language variable to access an
     array triggers off enforcer hits. Hmmm... this was all caused by a
     missing break; after a END_SWITCH. I guess most END_SWITCH
     statements need a break; after them.

 12. Wolverines now scavenge +3.

 13. Achiyalabopa now needs LOS for its sight range due to the fact
     that it is "low-flying".

Improvements from 2.71 to 2.81
------------------------------

  1. REQUIRES OS 3.0 ROM or higher.

  2. Enhanced Information Panels with MUCH better graphics.

  3. Enhanced Score Screen with MUCH better graphics.

  4. Music OFF feature.

  5. ExplorationMode spells don't appear in non exploration games.

  6. ExplorationMode spells DO appear in non exploration games IF Texas
     Trash'em is activated, thus you can throw them away.

  7. Several things can now be cast on dead bodies. (like Ropers and
     Wasp Nests).

  8. Miscellaneous changes.

  9. New Arcing Weapon Effect for archers.

 10. 13 new creatures. Most have very special capabilities.

 11. 7 New creature powers: Oracle, Eidetic Memory, Recognize Creatures,
     Recognize Growths, Recognize Inanimates, Recognize Spells, Ibrowse
     (mind reading)

 12. Enhanced Info Panel capabilities. If you own any creature with
     perfect Eidetic Memory then you will always "remember" what is
     under any given square on the board. You will be able to see what
     is under any square on your info panel. Current Creatures with
     perfect Eidetic Memory are: Elephant, Memory Master, Memory Mage.

 13. Enhanced Scroll Panel capabilities. If you own an Omnibiologist or
     Recognomancer you can view the stats of a creature before you cast
     it. If you own an Inanimatologist or Inanimage or Recognomancer
     you can view the stats of inanimate objects before you cast them.
     If you own Mullac De Irvine or Recognomancer you can view the
     stats of growths before you cast them.

 14. Enhanced Bonus Spell Selection capabilities. The above creatures
     assist you in making your bonus spell selections.

 15. Bonus Spell Selection now prints the name of the spell you are
     pointing at (if you have the appropriate .recognize powerup) at
     the bottom of the screen.

 16. Computer controlled Creatures who have healing attacks no longer
     attack their enemies.

 17. Humans can now attack their own creatures if such an attack would
     heal the creature.

 18. 2 New Creature Characteristics: Exophagy and Scavenging.

 19. 4 new magic spells.

 20. 2 new inanimate objects.

 21. Numerous small bugs fixed.

 22. Numerous creatures are now scavengers.

 23. New music for scavenging and artifact changing.

 24. 1 HORRIBLE bug fixed (it could randomly crash the machine).

 25. All memory leaks fixed.

 26. 3 new Chaos Theme Songs. Including "Are you ready to move?"

 27. 50+ new digital sound effects!

 28. If a creature does not yet have a sound effect, it is easy to add
     one yourself!

 29. If you don't like a certain sound effect, it is easy to change it
     yourself!

 30. Necroptence bug fixed!

 31. Turmoil bug fixed!

 32. Wizard kills magic tree and disappears bug fixed!

 33. Computer wizards no longer cast Restoration on their cloaked
     creatures.

 34. AUTOSAVE FEATURE IMPLEMENTED: This feature defaults to ON. It will
     save the game automatically on EACH human wizard's turn. Each save
     is done into a different filename. Example filename
     "004p8AutoSave.lha". This means that this is the savefile for turn
     004, player 8's turn. The turn number is first so that the files
     will list in numerical order in the filerequester.  >From now on
     if you find a horrible bug that crashes the machine or something
     you can ALWAYS go back to your last saved position (Because it is
     saved automatically). You can then replay the turn over and over
     again to figure out exactly what it is that is triggering the bug.
     This should greatly benefit playtesters the world over.

 35. IMPLEMENTED all of Frédéric's spell-description
     corrections/clarifications for all spells beginning with the
     letters A-E.

 36. BUG: Disrupt drains the intelligence of creatures which are your
     allies.  NOW FIXED.

 37. CHANGED: Disrupt now also drains the intelligence of enemy wizards.

Improvements from 2.6 to 2.7
----------------------------

   Attention Chaos Gamer:

  1. Exploration Mode Upgrade. When exploration mode is on you cannot
     see cells which you have not explored. Once you have explored a
     cell it stays permanently explored, there is no need to maintain
     line-of-sight to the cell. This makes the gameplay nice and
     simple, the way I like it. Most creatures simply explore the cell
     they are in and all adjacent cells. Some creatures, like Eagles
     explore further and can see behind walls due to flying high in the
     air. Other creatures, like snakes, can "feel" the movements of
     other creatures at far distances, thus allowing them to map cells
     which are hidden behind walls that cannot be seen by normal
     creatures. Certain other creatures can hear or smell other
     creatures. This adds the "Explore-the-Map" play mechanic to the
     game. You can't see any cells until you have sent a unit to map
     them. Once mapped the cell remains visible forever even if you
     have no nearby units or no line-of-sight. You can also see the
     cells that your allies can see. But if they stop being your ally
     then you can no longer see those cells. I love games where you
     must explore the level and map it out. Having Exploration Mode
     turned ON makes the game MUCH harder since you have no idea what
     direction you should be going in the early stages of the game. Nor
     do you have any idea what direction you will be attacked from at
     first. Exploration mode makes computer movement more CPU-intensive
     which is why I waited so long to implement it. Now that the game
     is aimed at a 2 meg 020+ amiga it shouldn't be a problem.
     Exploration mode doubles the amount of fun generated by the game
     IMHO. I was going to wait and implement Exploration after I did the
     graphics upgrade but due to my extremely limited time I had to
     reprioritize things and am now implementing the simplest upgrades
     first.

  2. REWROTE Charm, Raise Dead, Mass Ressurrect and Swap spells.

  3. I made all snakes feel out 6 squares. Snakes cannot be felt,
     smelled or heard. Only seen. All living flying creatures don't
     need LOS to see. And most see out 2 squares. Eagle, Falcon and
     Vulture have Excellent eyesight.  Spectator, Achiyalabopa and
     Harpy have poor eyesight. Vulture, Dire Wolf and Arctic Wolf have
     excellent sense of smell.

  4. TESTED OK September 22, 1999: Ok at this point I have never
     actually tested any of the above modifications A-K. So I just set
     PlayerView==1 and ran the game to test out the above changes.
     EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY! Its totally amazing! Geez I must be a
     40th level megacoder! I can explore the map and I can't see the
     enemies, its totally kewl! Well my Vulture (which can see 3 cells)
     and my Pegasus (which can see 2 cells) are totally mapping out the
     board super fast. This has convinced me to reduce the sightranges
     of all flying creatures. Vulture and Eagle will see out 2 squares
     diagonally. All other flying creatures will be set to see only 1
     square out just like the ground creatures (except flying creatures
     don't need LOS so if their sightrange ever gets increased they'll
     be able to see over walls and things.) DONE.

  5. Entering the board editor or spell editor should set
     ExplorationMode=NO and upon exiting it should be returned to its
     former status. DONE.

  6. Modify BoardEffect() to not do the effect on unexplored cells.
     DONE.

  7. Modify Cycle() / Bow weapon. This automatically fixes
     WeaponEffect() and WeaponEffectDrawer(). I intentionally left the
     sound effects in place and only hide the graphics. DONE.

  8. Lightning() will be left as it is because there is no easy way to
     mask it.  If you cast it you reveal your position. DONE.

  9. WizardExplode() will not be masked simply because I like to know
     when an enemy wizard has died, even if he dies in the vast expanse
     of the unexplored regions. DONE.

 10. At beginning of game set playerview to 15 since that will show a
     solid grey board. DONE.

 11. MAJOR PROBLEM WITH REPULSION: The Replusion spell copies cells
     around using board[x]=board[y] style code. But this copies the
     exploration bits to so it ends up exploring areas that you've
     never been too and it looks buggy. Also the clone, hyperclone and
     warp spells use board[x]=board[y] code which means they are
     copying around the exploration bits of players that they are not
     supposed to! ALL FIXED.

 12. FLAW: I was playing a test game in ExplorationMode and I started
     out with Triple, Red Dragon, Replicate, Cloak. So I had 6 red
     dragons, 3 of which were cloaked so I was trying to explore the
     map as fast as possible so I was flying each dragon deep into
     unexplored territory. I clicked on my cloaked dragon and moved him
     deep into an unexplored area and the game made a funny noise and
     my dragon was gone! At first I didn't know what the hell had
     happened. Then I realized that I had flown him into a pit. Poor
     little dragon 8( NOW FIXED with informative text message.

 13. A computer player cast Vengeance on wizard 1 while it was on
     wizard 2's view and it showed the spunge effect on the unexplored
     cell! Wrong. Its not supposed to do that! Modified SpungeColour()
     to use MaskWritePixel() NOW FIXED DONE

 14. The Following spells need to be investigated/modified to call
     ExploreCell() in an appropriate manner: Repulsion, Replicate,
     Simulacrum, HyperClone, Teleport, The time when any creature warps
     back in to the board, Turmoil, Vortex, Tempest, Roper
     teleportation, GrowthRoutine, Horror, Passsage. ALL DONE.

 15. BUG: Any creature with e.g. sqSightRange of 32 and
     SightRequiresLOS==YES can't actually see that far because the
     close-up unexplored cells block LOS to the further away unexplored
     cells therefore: ExploreCell() must be modified to sort all the
     cells on the board into ascending order of distance from the
     observer. Then this sorted list of cells will be used instead of
     just going through the cells from 0 to 239. NOW FIXED AND DONE.

 16. Speed up the "derive Cell from pixel coords" code in
     MaskWritePixel by using my LSRCellHeightShiftBitMultGAMECOL[y]
     technique from cell.c. DONE

 17. Modify all Numeric keypresses to check that the cell is really
     visible to the current PlayerView before highlighting it.

 18. Added a new CAST_NOTONUNEXPLORED or CAST_EXPLOREDONLY bit to
     certain spells such as Vengeance, Dark Power, Justice, Armour,
     Cursed Sword, etc. Also add "Cannot cast on unexplored cell" to
     the 2nd info panel of the spell information thing.

 19. PROBLEM: Pressing the 'l' key on a blank cell only highlights that
     cell and the 8 adjacent cells because the owner of that cell
     (NOBODY) has not explored any cells. I put some special code in
     AutoFail() so now the 'l' key works like it always did. NOW FIXED.

 20. Added CAST_NOTONUNEXPLORED to the spellinfo screen. DONE.

 21. Added SightRange, FeelRange, SmellRange and HearRange to creature
     info panel 2nd screen. DONE.

 22. Changed the Ghost and Drelb so they can't be felt or smelled. DONE.

 23. 4 NEW SPELLS: Cartography, Alternography, Seismology, Telescope.
     Alternography majorly kicks ass!

 24. After adding the new spells I loaded up the old levels to see if
     they still worked and ... THEY DO! 8)

 25. CANCELLED: The Play by Email upgrade has been CANCELLED until
     someone registers the game who has a netconnected Amiga.

 26. BUG: When loading a game, probabilities are all messed up on the
     info screen!  NOW FIXED.

 27. UPGRADED All SAI's Levels to the new format successfully.

 28. YUCK! Some color combos in the credits intro are terrible. I have
     made a better color combo for the bright red text. DONE.

 29. FLAW: When a Bolter Wall is the last computer controlled thing to
     move it stays highlighted well into the next phase of the game.
     Way longer than it is supposed to. NOW FIXED.

 30. I tried to duplicate the "Kill your own wizard and get an enforcer
     hit" bug but every time I kill my own wizard there is no enforcer
     hit. ???

 31. DOUBLED the speed of ClearBoard();

 32. PROBLEM: It takes me forever to find the spell I want when I'm
     designing levels and testing things. SOLUTION: Alphabetized the
     list of objects in the alt-o object chooser menu. DONE. SOLVED.

 33. DARK WOOD INCONGRUENCY: The description says they are undead but
     their undead_stat is not set. NOW FIXED.

 34. AAUUGH! I cast animate on an independent generator and nothing
     happened! I have now changed the spell description to say "This
     spell has no effect on generators." FIXED.

 35. DAMMIT I WAS GOING TO WIN AND THIS STUPID MudMan thing with 0
     maneuverability just moved next to my wizard and killed him even
     though he should have been engaged to my zombie!!!!! Engagement
     routine needs to be investigated!

 36. ENGAGEMENT ROUTINE FIXED: The routine now works like this: If you
     are next to 1 enemy creature THEN If you have 0 maneuverability
     you are ENGAGED. If you have 15 maneuverability you are NOT
     ENGAGED. If you have 1 maneuverability you have 1 chance in 15 of
     not being engaged. If you have 2 maneuverability you have 2
     chances in 15 of not being engaged. The engagement system is now
     totally logical and easy to understand.

 37. PROBLEM: You can't install Chaos to your HD by simply dragging the
     drawer icon to the HD because the req.library must also be copied
     to the LIBS: I have now changed it so that it will open the
     library from LIBS: or from the libs/ dir in the chaos dir so now
     the game is SUPER EASY TO INSTALL!!! NOW FIXED.

 38. 4 NEW SPELLS: Stone to Flesh, Inanimorphobiosis, Flesh to Stone,
     Mass Petrification.

 39. I went back and modified most of my spells to use implode cell
     effect for when something bad is happening to the recipient and
     implode+explode cell effect for when something good is happening
     to the recipient. DONE.

 40. SOUND EFFECTS fully reinstated in ExplorationMode. I have decided
     that I like to hear all the sound effects of events that happen in
     unexplored areas so I modified CellEffect() to only mask the gfx
     in unexplored areas NOT the sound effects. DONE.

 41. BUG: Intro credits monster list sometimes has messed up colors.
     NOW FIXED.

 42. SPEEDED up the intro credits a bit.

 43. VODKA changed to allow you to cast it on the independents. Now the
     spell is actually useful for something :)

 44. CAST_ARTIFACT added to spell information screen.

 45. CHANGED SWAP: to not swap inanimate objects.

 46. Bazillions of bugs which only had a 1 in a million chance of
     happening have been FIXED.

 47. ALL of those annoying things have been removed such as: Wizard's
     Names no longer constantly reset. End Turn Confirmation is now
     optional. You can now save the game on ANY player's turn and it
     works as it should.

 48. 7x as much music! And 7x as good too!

 49. Codex Sirconia.

 50. Plasma Beam Bug FIXED!

 51. Better Computer Artificial Intelligence!

 52. NEW optimizations to save memory!

 53. BETTER Screen handling for users with OS 3.0 and higher!

 54. ENGAGEMENT routine fixed! I don't know if you ever noticed this or
     not but once in a blue moon a creature with 0 maneuverability
     adjacent to an enemy creature would NOT be engaged! THIS IS NOW
     FIXED.

 55. SPEEDUP: Computer AI is now MUCH faster than before!

 56. NEGATIVE score bug fixed!

 57. NEW SPELLS: Crystal Ball, Ubiquiscope, Fly, Singular Earthbind,
     Dual Earthbind, Nonarchery, Convert, Sword of Sassenrath, Cursed
     Sword, Mount, NoMount, NoGrow, The Exorcist, Cartography,
     Alternography, Seismology, Telescope, Stone to Flesh,
     Inanimorphobiosis, Flesh to Stone, Mass Petrification, Brain Drain
     Beam, Demonic Touch Beam, Combat Drain Beam, Range Drain Beam,
     Recover Drain Beam, Lethargy Beam, Paralyzation Beam, Life Drain
     Beam, Toxicity Beam, Encumberance Beam, Sluggishness Beam.

 58. COUNTLESS other bugfixes!

 59. NUMEROUS other minor improvements!

 60. Vodka and Magic Wand now have a real graphic!

 61. 11 Custom Designed Levels! These levels are NOT random. They were
     designed in a special way by actual sadistic, depraved, evil Human
     Beings. Can you battle your way through them in less turns that
     the game designers? Can you even survive in them for more than 12
     turns? Find out how good a wizard you REALLY are.

 62. We have received complaints from AES and others about the game
     using 2 seperate screens because they typically run lots of
     programs and flip between them a lot so sometimes the screens get
     out-of-order. I have now (finally) dug up the information on
     attached (parent/child/family) screens and OS 3.0 is REALLY
     AWESOME!! OS 3.0 screen handling is vastly superior to OS 2.04!
     The use of attached screens also allows me to have as many screens
     open as I want without annoying anyone. All unused screens will be
     hidden.  This is going to be really kewl.

 63. AGA DETECTION code added. Now we can display different graphics
     depending on if the game is running on AGA or ECS.

 64. 64 bit alignment of screen memory implemented. This allows the
     entire computer to run faster when playing the game on AGA Amigas
     because the display will be running at 4x bandwidth.

 65. DEFAULTS CHANGED to start with 1 human vs 1 computer wizard + 4
     generators.

 66. SCREWEY QUIT BUG FINALLY SOLVED!!!!

 67. BUG: Vodka has no effect on Independents. NOW FIXED.

 68. BUG: Agents cast harmful spells against their friends and allies.
     Allegedly NOW FIXED.

 69. BUG: COMPUTER WIZARDS ALWAYS CAST PLASMABEAM STUPIDLY: NOW FIXED.

 70. I also modified the PlasmaBeamHandler and stupidity checking to be
     compatible with AgentCasting. DONE.

 71. WROTE a new PlasmaBeamRanking() routine so the computer wizards
     will try to cast it under the most favorable circumstances.

 72. FLAW: PlasmaBeamHandler always converts illegal coordinates into a
     cell with GetCell(). NOW FIXED.

 73. uhmmm there were major problems in the spellcasting AI...
     IsStupidCast() was assuming that the spell was being cast from the
     WIZARD's cell thus it couldn't possibly have worked with
     AgentCasting. Maybe this explains why agents cast sleep on
     friendly creatures? NOW FIXED.

 74. MAJOR BUGs in IntelligentComputerSpellSelect() and other routines.
     NOW FIXED.

 75. MAJOR BUG in IsStupidCast() All CAST_FREE spells were being
     handled all wrong. This was totally messing up the computer's
     thinking. CAST_FREE spells were routinely being regarded as
     REALLY_STUPID(-3) when in fact they were the best and most usefull
     spell possible. NOW FIXED.

 76. ADDED stupidity checking for Alternography.

 77. ExplorationMode option now on setup screen II.

 78. BUG: Patrick Hawkins reports: If the talklists file is not present
     then an alert is generated telling you it isn't there. Then the
     whole computer crashes. BUG: Kermit reports: If you don't have
     narrator.device then an alert is generated saying "Could not open
     narrator.device" then the whole computer crashes. BUG: James
     Conwell reports: If ANYTHING goes wrong in CommenceChaos(), a file
     is not found, a library can't be opened, a device is missing, etc.
     then a nice alert is generated telling you such. Then the entire
     computer ALWAYS crashes. ALL FIXED NOW.

 79. FIXED memory leaks.

 80. FIXED Semaphore bugs.

 81. PROBLEM: Casting Stone to Flesh or Inanimorphobiosis on a wall
     gives you a wall which can be moved but it can't actually attack
     anything. I changed it so that it will always be able to attack
     the living and if the inanimate object was undead then it will
     also be able to attack undeads. NOW FIXED.

 82. 11 NEW SPELLS: Brain Drain Beam, Demonic Touch Beam, Combat Drain
     Beam, Range Drain Beam, Recover Drain Beam, Lethargy Beam,
     Paralyzation Beam, Life Drain Beam, Toxicity Beam, Encumberance
     Beam, Sluggishness Beam. These spells do not affect corpses or
     scrolls. Each spell has its own AI routine.

 83. BUG! Combat, Maneuverability, Ranged Combat and Special Combat
     recovery/ poisoning don't work right!!! NOW FIXED.

 84. The holder of the Sword of Sassenrath makes his nearby friends more
     intelligent. DONE.

 85. Codex Sirconia Upgrade Several small corrections made.

 86. Problem: There is no explanation of Summoning, only of
     Subjugation. 7 new paragraphs added. NOW FIXED.

 87. Problem: There is no explanation of how the world can exist in a
     2-dimensional state and yet flying creatures can "fly" "over" other
     objects. 2 paragraphs added. NOW FIXED.

 88. Still need to come up with some sort of explanation for undeads
     and why they can't be attacked. ??? Added 1 more paragraph.

 89. NEW SECTION: "The Folly of Man" to explain generators. 10
     paragraphs.

 90. Put in all of SAI's new spell graphics into the game.

Improvements from 2.5 to 2.6
----------------------------

  1. MUSIC is now played during spell-selection phase. I played a
     couple of test games with 6 theme songs installed and it was MUCH
     better than 0 theme songs like we've had in the past but it still
     wasn't nearly enough.

  2. The game feels MUCH more upbeat with the new music!!!!

  3. BUG: When starting a new game the colors on the HiRes part of the
     setup screen are all wrong and it is positioned wrong too. FIXED.

  4. BUG: When starting a new game the colors on the HiRes part of the
     gameboard are wrong. FIXED.

  5. BUG: Several of the new Sidewinder protracker mods won't work with
     the playroutine. They are playing EXTREMELY slowly. I converted
     them to MED MMD1 so this is NOW FIXED.

  6. MODIFIED the game so that if you turn off sound and speech then
     the music plays continuously through the spell-selection,
     spell-casting and movement phases of the game, only changing at
     the beginning of the next turn.

  7. INCLUDED CD advertisement for Sidewinder CDs into the docs.

  8. Color My World Modifications

  9. BUG: sometimes wizards cast Plasma Beam for some strange reason.
     then they always cast it up to the left, even if nothing is there,
     or even if it attacks multiple creatures that they own while not
     hurting any enemies.  Leaving this for SAI to investigate. Fixed
     by JC months later on October 20th, 1999. NOW FIXED.

 10. BUG in protracker play routine. There is a bug in the playroutine
     that causes certain protracker mods to play back incorrectly. It
     sounds like the notes are being played back about 100x too slowly.
     I have no idea how to debug this so I'm just converting the
     affected mods to MED format.  Converted LOTS of protracker mods to
     MED MMD1 format.

 11. NEEDED: Dear SAI, could you please adjust the loading and saving
     such that player 3 can save the game, and then when reloading the
     game it will reload to player 3's spell selection phase? Thanks.
     Implemented by JC in August 1999.

 12. OBSOLETED: EditPopupIDCMP is now handled my the main HandleIDCMP
     routine.  This means that "q" querying etc. now works properly in
     the editor.

 13. Temporarily turned off the end of turn confirmation as I find it
     annoying.

 14. Improved the implementation of the popup creature menus using an
     array of functions.

 15. Fixed a bug in ClearBoard().

 16. End Turn Confirmation is now an option in the menus. Default is
     OFF.

 17. PROBLEM: The "about" screen with the pentagrams hashes sometimes.
     It hashes a lot and looks utterly terrible under heavy CPU load.
     NOW FIXED by increasing the taskpri to 100 during the doublebuffer
     switching.

 18. PROBLEM: The credits scrolling is not 100% smooth and is very
     jerky under heavy CPU load. NOW FIXED by increasing taskpri to 100
     during the doublebuffer switching.

 19. NEGATIVE SCORE BUG: I played a game against JJ and I won but my
     score was negative and his was positive so he claimed he was
     really the winner. In the current version of the game shooting the
     following scrolls gives the following points. Scrolls of creatures
     award as many points as the original life of the real creature.
     moveit -124 Pox shield -125 acid rain -123 devastation -1 touch of
     god -116 ball lightning -114 plasma beam -113 sword of sassenrath
     -118 cursed sword -110 nomount -86. Other scrolls have various
     (mostly HUGE) positive scores associated with them. This is all
     caused by bad subscript errors. Points are awarded according to
     the .Life statistic. But Magic Spells don't have a .Life statistic
     so it just accesses some other data. Made required changes to
     DevastationHandler() also. DONE AND FIXED.

 20. BUG: DeathBringer struck a scroll dead. NOW FIXED.

 21. PROBLEM: We keep getting Emails from NTSC users who don't know how
     to PALboot their Amiga. I added in the AmigaToPAL cli command
     which requires OS 2.04 or higher. Now the game automatically puts
     the computer into pal mode. FIXED.

 22. BUG: Pressing 'q' on the creatures on the alt-o menu thing shows
     the spell description instead of their stats. NOW FIXED.

 23. Spell-List Editor Upgrade 0. Have a seperate spell-list editor
     which is different from the "board editor" 1. Its easy. Just make
     a SpellBoard for storing the spell list onto. DONE. 2. You select
     "Edit Spell List" from the Main Menu. DONE. 3. Figure out where
     the code goes when you select "Edit Spell List" ??? DONE. 4.
     delete copy and paste work exactly the same as in the
     board-editor. DONE. 5. Modify HandleIDCMP + make new menu. DONE. 6.
     Need CopySpellsFromListToBoard(player) (do this once at the
     beginning + anytime the player number is changed) DONE. 7. Need
     CopySpellsFromBoardToList(player) (do this whenever you select
     "quit" or change player number) DONE. 8. Need alt-i for "insert"
     an empty space into the spell-list. DONE. 9. Need alt-d to delete
     just as in the board editor unless it is used on an empty cell in
     which case the empty cell is deleted and all cells to the right
     are scooted 1 space to the left. DONE.

 24. Gamesave Format Upgrade: currentPlayer is now saved. BUG:
     ExorcistID is listed in the translation table twice! FIXED. BUG:
     Probability information was not completely saved. FIXED. BUG: the
     currentSpell was being saved but not translated. FIXED. BUG: When
     you save the game it resets back to player 1's turn. FIXED. BUG:
     When you load a game it resets back to player 1's turn. FIXED.
     REMOVED old stuff that is no longer needed.

 25. BUG: The FavoriteFoodID and RunsAwayFromID is not translated like
     all the other ids. So the first time we add a new spell to the
     game, all our previously designed levels will have creatures with
     messed up tastes and fears. NOW FIXED.

 26. HOPEFULLY I can now do a complete major upgrade or 2 or 3 and not
     have to convert all the old levels up to the new format.

 27. Line of Sight Upgrade. BUG: If you are trying to cast a roper or
     bolter wall etc. along a 45° angle, the "l" key will show that
     you have line of sight but sometimes the "c" key says you don't!
     And when the "c" says you can't cast it there you really can't
     cast it there even though it is in range and you have line of
     sight! This is caused by a problem in isLineOfSight. isLineOfSight
     @{i}SHOULD@{ui} work perfectly but it doesn't. I don't know why. Its like
     it is off by 1 or something. This problem only occurs when there
     are generators adjacent to the 45° path. If you want to
     investigate this mystery then please do so. In the meantime I have
     solved the problem by replacing all occurrences of isLineOfSight C
     code with isLineOfSightQ asm code. NOW FIXED.

 28. SPEEDUP: Computer controlled shooters now decide who they will
     shoot over 2x as fast as before!

 29. SPEEDUP: Computer AI is now MUCH faster than before!

 30. SPEEDUP: "c" key is now over 3x as fast as before!

 31. SPEEDUP: "s" key is now much faster!

 32. BUG: isLineOfSightQ does not automatically return TRUE when the
     source cell is the destination cell. (This prevented me from
     casting Combat on myself) NOW FIXED.

 33. FIXED various bugs with the Mass Ressurrect spell + pox or
     reincarnation or vanquished foes. It was all very broken. NOW
     FIXED.

 34. ALL files 100% cleaned up!

 35. Played a test game. Saved and Loaded multiple times. Everything
     works.

 36. REGISTERED USER on September 17th: a nice chap from Ireland mailed
     in his registration fee. He has an AGA Amiga 1200 tower with Zorro
     IV Busboard, Picasso IV gfx card, 50 Mhz 060, 64 Megs of RAM,
     Power Flyer, etc.

 37. Added Sidewinder to the Scrolling Credits.

 38. Played Sean's Levels 1-4 and 10. Added turns_left to the about
     screen.

 39. Added Registered_Text to hold the registered user's name.

Improvements from 2.3 to 2.5
----------------------------

  1. Allegedly fixed menu recoverable error problem. This fix is not to
     my satisfaction and I will try and find a better solution. NOW
     FIXED

  2. CHANGED: The eye-eye powerup now only gives 2 counts instead of 5,
     but its effect can now be accumulated by casting the spell
     multiple times.

  3. Added MOUNTABLE2_STAT to the Shadow Dragon.

  4. Modified the movement and range stats to show the original value
     in red (i.e. like all the others stats) and the current value in
     green. I didn't do anything about recovery for movement.

  5. Added a few new random messages for wizard spell selection.

  6. RENAMED: JCformat.jc to JCformat.c for Unix compatibility.

  7. Modified the info panel so that creatures having the REIN bit set,
     show the number of reincarnations steps remaining in their
     sequence (previously just an `R' was shown).

  8. Input handler upgrade.

  9. Incorporated the editor IDCMP handler into the main game handler,
     thus moving the one step closer to a single IDCMP handler. In
     addition this change shaved 500 bytes on the size of the code
     segment.

 10. Discovered I had accidently deleted the code for the `S' key.
     Reinstated it.

 11. Repaired the Quit option on the initialization screens.

 12. It always seemed like there was something missing from Classic
     Chaos. I just figured out what it was. I have now made Ropers and
     Wasp Nests CLASSIC.

 13. Added in medmod support to music.lib. We can now easily play med
     (MMD0 and MMD1) mods in Chaos.

 14. Added support for the QuadSpectrumAnalyzers into the medmod asm
     code.

 15. Added support for the Quadrascopes into the medmod asm code.

 16. Solved the mystery of converting period into samples per second

 17. Rewrote the quadrascopes to use the RIGHT formula now.

 18. Tested all 6 game musics with the new system and they all work
     WONDERFULLY!

 19. Chaos now officially supports the playback of protracker and MED
     MMD0 and MMD1 mods. If you have a choice then use MMD1. Not that
     it really matters.  I have no idea which routine is faster, all I
     know is that MMD1 mod format is superior to protracker mod format
     due to being able to handle more instruments and being able to
     have multiple songs per file. Hooray for Teijo Kinuunen!

 20. FLAW: Selecting "Load" from Setup Screen I produces some problems
     so I just quickly uncommented it for now. This saved 100 bytes on
     release version. As a general principle I believe that games
     should have a load option on the first main screen. I'll just
     worry about it later because right this second I'm trying to nuke
     as many bugs as fast as possible.

 21. FLAW: exiting from reading a spell description makes a beep. FIXED

 22. James Conwell's 10 Commandments of Game Design. Any game produced
     by James Conwell MUST have the following features: 1. It must have
     an option for more than 1 human participant to play in a game. I
     don't care what kind of game it is. It MUST have at least a
     2-player option. 2. It must have a 1 player option. 3. It should
     have an option for 2 player competitive as well as 2 player
     cooperative. 2 player cooperative mode is VERY important!!!! 4.
     It must have awesome music. 5. It must have a wide variety of
     awesome music, probably including but not neccessarily limited to
     the following: A.  Spooky Music. B. Rave Techno. C. Straight
     Dance. D. Dramatic Music. 6. It must have an intro that can be
     IMMEDIATELY exited at any time. 7. It must make good use of the
     capabilities of the format that it is presented in/on.  8. It must
     be FUN to play. 9. We must go through the game and take out
     everything about it that is annoying and either remove it or make
     it optional. 10. It must have good graphics.

 23. DOUBLE-BUFFERING of rastports/bitmaps implemented for pentagrams
     (finally!). Now they are rock solid, except for during high CPU
     load times (like while downloading from the internet on standard
     serial port) During high cpu load they flicker a bit sometimes. I
     haven't tested it on A500 yet.

 24. ADPCM asm routines upgrade: ADPCM stands for Advanced Delta Pulse
     Code Modulation. It is a lossy compression algorythm which is
     supported by the Zyxel Voice modems and various voicemail
     packages. I intend to use ADPCM audio compression technology to
     reduce the storage requirements of the speech samples of Chaos.
     This is useful for persons such as SAI who have limited hard drive
     space. I do not intend to compress the "sound effects" of the
     game. Only the speech samples because there are going to be
     hundreds of speech samples. The game will soon have about 10 megs
     of uncompressed speech which will be only 2.5 megs compressed.

 25. NOTE about OS compatibility: If the game were ever to require OS
     2.04 or higher (which I assume it will when we make the game
     internet-capable) then we can replace all occurences of CreatePort
     with CreateMsgPort and all occurrences of DeletePort with
     DeleteMsgPort and all occurrences of CreateExtIO with
     CreateIORequest and all occurrences of DeleteExtIO with
     DeleteIORequest then we could stop linking with amiga.lib and
     hopefully save some bytes on the executable filesize.

 26. It would really help if the floppy version could use a fast file
     system floppy. But, alas, that requires OS 2.04 or higher.

 27. Changed wizard names to names that actually mean something to me.
     This makes the game a lot more fun for me.

 28. CHANGED: Bipedal Generators to generate at the same rate as
     Aviaries.

 29. James opens a can of "WHOOP ASS". James guggles down the whole
     thing.  James rewrites line of sight testing to be 9x faster than
     present, 21x faster than it was originally.

 30. Made algorythmic sound effects allocate/deallocate the sound
     channel. Now that it no longer hogs a sound channel at max
     priority I can add ingame music.

 31. CLASSIC: Ogre Mage, Standard Wall, Weak Wall, Rock, Speed and Slow
     are now CLASSIC.

 32. CHANGED: Impurities and Agent Casting can no longer be set using
     the ingame menus. I had to do this to pave the way for the
     internet upgrade. We can only allow the user to change settings
     during the game which do not materially affect gameplay. Things
     which materially affect gameplay must be set @{i}once@{ui} at the beginning
     of the game and then remain unchanged for the duration of that
     game.

 33. Placed Impurities and AgentCasting on setup screen and in savegame
     file.  This means the savegame format has changed so previously
     saved games will no longer load correctly. Tested and verified, I
     loaded an old savegame and the whole game locked up but at least
     the computer didn't crash.

 34. FLAW: (at least I assume this is a flaw). I had a stone giant
     stand on top of a dead stone golem. Each turn the computer players
     would justice or dark power my Stone Giant and it would be
     reinstated as a stone golem. then the next player would justice my
     new stone golem and it would go back to being a Stone Giant. ad
     infinitum. This is caused by the fact that justice and dark power
     leave corpses behind when in previous versions they did not.
     Anyway I changed it so that Justice/DarkPower/Exorcise/etc. do not
     leave corpses behind anymore. FIXED and TESTED.

 35. BUG: C for CAST does not work on the second
     Justice/DarkPower/speed/slow etc. (any multiplicity spell I
     guess.) Strangely, the C key works for Shadow Woods and other
     trees. Ok, I traced this to a problem in the spell files where the
     target of the spell is highlighted with the highlight sprite. The
     C key uses the position of the HighLight Sprite for determination
     of who the caster is. This information was being lost. NOW FIXED
     in every spell file.

 36. The turn number is now displayed on the New Game and Quit Game
     requesters.

 37. Disrupt no longer kills scrolls + I added the following sentence
     to the description: "This spell currently does not affect wizards,
     growths, inanimate objects or scrolls."

 38. various changes to docs.

 39. FLAW: At beginning of Spell Selection phase there is still text
     left over at the bottom from the movement phase. FIXED.

 40. LIST PROCESSING implemented for the sentence generation of what
     wizards say during their spell selection. There are now around 20x
     as many things that they can say without taking 20x the memory.
     It's extremely easy to edit the TalkLists file and add new stuff
     in, you don't even have to recompile! I took this code from a True
     Basic paragraph generator that I made a few years ago. Only I
     didn't bother to translate all the paragraph stuff. Just the
     1-line sentence generation and list processing stuff.

 41. BUG: a computer wizard cast Alliance but then didn't actually cast
     it on anyone. Or at least he didn't get any allies by casting it.
     This has now happened 10 to 12 times. When playing a game with no
     generators the Alliance spell always works. The problem is that
     the computer wizards always try to ally themselves with the
     Independents when independents are available but the spell is
     programmed to fail when applied to an Independent creature. NOW
     FIXED.

 42. ADDED New CastInfo bits: CAST_NOINDEPENDENTS and CAST_NOASLEEP so
     that it it is illegal to cast Alliance on independent or sleeping
     creatures. It is now illegal to cast sleep on sleeping creatures
     too. This will help prevent the computer players from doing stupid
     stuff.

 43. CHANGED: CAST_UNDEAD to CAST_MUSTBEUNDEAD.

 44. BROKEN: Aviaries, Dragon Nests and Bipedal Generators never
     generate anything anymore 8( (at least not when playing with 8
     wizards.) I just played a test game against 8 wizards and 4
     generators and the generators NEVER generated anything. Ok, this
     is because I had AgentCasting turned off. I have NOW FIXED this so
     that even with AgentCasting off, the generator agents still
     generate.

 45. MAJOR BUG: A computer wizard just attacked his own elephant! This
     might be because he was beside it and was "engaged" to it or
     perhaps he tried to mount it? Lucky for him his elephant didn't
     attack him back, it charged toward the nearest enemy instead. The
     bug was in ChooseDestination(). NOW FIXED.

 46. BUG: Computer Wizards keep trying to mount meditations which are
     already occupied. NOW FIXED.

 47. BUG: A computer Wizard just cast Animate on turn 1 and then nothing
     happened. It didn't say what he cast it on. It didn't say he
     aborted it.  OK, he didn't have any inanimate objects so "nothing"
     is exactly what was supposed to happen. I modified isStupidCast to
     check for this. NOW FIXED.

 48. BUG: Computer wizards routinely waste Subversion type spells on
     creatures which are being ridden. I don't know why
     FLAG_NOWIZARDCELL doesn't prevent this from happening. Sleep
     spells are wasted this way too. NOW FIXED.

 49. FLAW: Dark Wood, Speed and Slow spell descriptions do not show how
     many attempts of each you get. FIXED.

 50. BUG: The "Destroy Wall" spell destroys walls but does not reveal
     what the wall was covering. If the wall was covering a scroll or
     artifact or corpse or etc. then it is destroyed. FIXED

 51. BUGS: Boil, Quench and Still all have the same bug as Destroy
     Wall. ALL NOW FIXED.

 52. BUG: I played a game with 99 hidden scrolls and 99 hidden
     artifacts and 2 wizards and the the initial "Repulsion" messed up
     the color pallette of the game. There was a place where the code
     did a return without reloading the original colour pallette. FIXED.

 53. BUG: Animate destroys any item which is under the item being
     morphed.  Corpses, artifacts, scrolls, etc are being destroyed
     this way. FIXED.

 54. BUGS: Alter Reality, MassMorph and Mutate have the same bug as
     Animate. ALL FIXED NOW.

 55. Nuke destroys the entire cell and I left it that way.

 56. BUG: I was player 2. Player 8 killed player 3 and somehow all the
     foes vanquished from the player 3 wizard got put onto my wizard.
     NOW FIXED

 57. BUG: Player 6 just killed my orc with his wizard but it put the
     orc on @{i}my@{ui} wizard's Foes Vanquished. NOW FIXED

 58. Fixed Eye for an Eye, Torment, Nuke, Free, Alter Reality spell
     descriptions.

 59. Scroll Delay now defaults to 0.

 60. BUG: My ally cast Magic Shield on my Basalt Golem yet its Magic
     Resistance is still 0. This happened after most of the other
     wizards had been killed off. ??? I just cast Magic Shield on
     myself on turn 1 of a new game and it had no effect! The recovery
     code was messed up. NOW FIXED.

 61. BUG: Brain Boost doesn't work either! The recovery code was messed
     up. NOW FIXED.

 62. BUG: an organge jelly just grew over my Nightmare (my nightmare is
     not being ridden) and the orange jelly just pirated his Foes
     Vanquished. The entire list of Foes Vanquished for the Nightmare
     is now on the Orange Jelly. NOW FIXED.

 63. BUG: I uncovered the nightmare and it has no Foes Vanquished. It
     doesn't even say "Foes Vanquished 0". Its all one big blank spot.
     NOW FIXED.

 64. I intentionally fixed the above two bugs and 1 part of the reason
     I rewrote the foes vanquished handling was because I was hoping
     that in the process of doing so all the other foes vanquished bugs
     would mysteriously disappear. Well, guess what? That is exactly
     what happened. All the other foes vanquished bugs just
     mysteriously disappeared. ALL FIXED NOW.

 65. BUG: When computer wizard 1 is on the top of the screen and he is
     trying to mount his steed yet is engaged, this triggers enforcer
     hits. Enforcer hits do a DisplayBeep() which is what messes up the
     sound I think. I know that enforcer hits make the sound effects
     sound funny. I think this is because it changes the setting of the
     audio filter. (Enforcer Hits problem was in EngageChoice) NOW
     FIXED!

 66. STUPID: A computer wizard cast demonic touch on a sleeping dragon
     (which was the only enemy creature that he could cast it on).
     FIXED.

 67. STUPID: Actually, after looking at the code I could see that ANY
     spell might potentially be cast on sleeping creatures. I changed
     it so that casting any spell on a sleeping creature is considered
     stupid except for Wake. FIXED.

 68. BUG: A wizard cast Alter Reality on a pegasus being ridden by
     another wizard and the spell failed. I have changed Alter Reality
     so that it can be cast on creatures which are being ridden by the
     wizard. I tested this and it really works! FIXED.

 69. BUG: Sometimes wizards try to cast Kill on a creature which is
     being ridden. The assistance says NOEXPOSEDWIZARD yet the spell is
     programmed to fail if there is a wizard anywhere in the cell. I
     changed this so that the spell now matches its computer assistance
     flags. This means it now succeeds against mounted creatures. FIXED.

 70. FLAW: You can't easily tell when a Subversion/Betrayal/Abduction
     works or not. It now prints "Spell Succeeds!" at the bottom of the
     screen when it succeeds. (It already said "Spell fails" when it
     fails.) NOW FIXED.

 71. INTELLIGENT MAGIC WOOD CASTING implemented: Works great! Wizards
     now cast Magic Woods close to themselves and their allies while
     keeping them as far away as possible from their enemies. However
     any wizard who has " mad", "mad ", ""kalsu", "crazy", "krazy" or
     "insane" in his name will use the random treecasting routine
     instead. This feature is dedicated to Joseph Dixon who said the
     old way of casting trees made the game look stupid 8)

 72. BUG: Team Scores are wrong when several people are on each team.
     Team Life is wrong when several people on each team. The score and
     life of the lowest numbered team is being displayed for their team
     and their score and life are being displayed for the OTHER team.
     NOW FIXED. + the code is a bit more simplified.

 73. INTELLIGENT DarkWood and ShadowWood Casting Implemented. Basically
     the computer wizards try to cast these trees adjacent to lots of
     enemies which are nearby. A small consideration is given to enemy
     generators.

 74. PROBLEM: Every time I am about to win the game I have a bunch of
     creatures closing in on the last enemy wizard. It is now a bit
     harder to kill wizards since they are sometimes surrounded by
     trees which block many of my possible paths of attack and
     shooting. But every time as I am closing in the computer wizard
     will cast a creature to stop me but he always casts it in the
     wrong place (like BEHIND him instead of in FRONT of him). This
     always makes me feel sorry for the poor stupid computer wizards.
     If only he would have cast his dragon IN FRONT of his wizard
     (between his wizard and my dragon) he could have lived for at
     least 1 more turn. The solution is the following: INTELLIGENT
     CREATURE CASTING Implemented. Works great.

 75. BUG: in new IntelligentCreatureCast: Casting a creature while in
     someone else's tree makes the creature become the tree owner's
     instead of the caster's. FIXED.

 76. PROBLEM: I have killed wizards many times on the first turn with
     Ball Lightning and many other times during the game also. In fact,
     lately I've been winning the game in only 12-18 turns. So I have
     now REDUCED Ball Lightning's Life damage from a 10:1 ratio down to
     2:1.

 77. CHANGED: Abath combat from 4 to 8 since the description says that
     it has an enlarged horn which can induce severe bruising.

 78. STUPID: A computer wizard cast reincarnate on his ally's Bolter
     Wall which already had Reincarnate cast on it. FIXED.

 79. STUPID: A computer wizard cast Horror on a creature which already
     had Horror. FIXED.

 80. POSSIBLE BUG: A computer wizard just cast "Free" on a manticore
     that was being ridden by another wizard. The Manticore is now an
     independent and is still being ridden. NOW FIXED.

 81. BUG: Click on an eyeball. Now try to attack an undead creature by
     accident.  Now it says you are engaged even though there are NO
     creatures next to you.  You can't move or do anything but cancel
     your movement. This was found when I tried to attack a Wizard that
     had Liched himself. FIXED by SAI.

 82. Vanished wizards should never be thinking about casting a spell
     because their .Warped bit will be set.

 83. IMPROVED the speech of "Player One", "Player Two" etc.

 84. STUPID: A wizard just cast combat on himself and on the next turn
     he cast Poison Dagger on himself, thus wasting his combat spell!
     FIXED by raising the ranking of Poison Dagger by 4 points to be 1
     point higher than Combat + modified IsStupidCast().

 85. HYBSIL says it fires poisoned arrows. So we made its Ranged Combat
     attack recovery.

 86. CHANGED: WoodElf only needs 4 kills to be promoted to a DreadElf.

 87. Spell selection upgrade.

 88. Moved the Dismount gadget up next the query gadget.

 89. I decreased the delay for messages to stay on the screen during
     computer spell selection. It still seems too long so I will
     shorten it more yet. I think it adds to the atmosphere if you have
     to read quickly, helps gives the impression of action.

 90. Blanked the bottom area of the screen after spell selection.

 91. Fixed a problem with discarding. Now marks a spell used when it is
     first selected so that the player canNOT discard the same spell
     (this was done in a completely different way under the gadget
     scheme).

 92. When spell selection occurs now a blank square is drawn over the
     selected spell. This helps make things clearer especially when
     using the Texas mode.

 93. NEW POWERUP: An orc, goblin, or troll killing an elf, will now
     pick up the bow previously used by the elf.

 94. I just saw the problem where a computer wizard cast sleep on a
     mounted creature. There were no other suitable targets nearby, but
     it still doesn't explain why that spell was selected in the first
     place. NOW FIXED

 95. Fixed the editor so that the spell list is redisplayed when the
     editor exits.

 96. Attempted to fix the problem where the bonus spell selection panel
     is sometimes made bigger than it should be.

 97. Fixed a bug pertaining to computer wizard spell selection that was
     resulting from my earlier changes to spell selection.

 98. I added a routine to do sensible promotions on a cell. Several
     stats now take the max of the original and the new creature. Not
     all of them, so there is still some additional challenges for
     those deliberately going for power ups.

 99. At present the power ups using the new system are: WoodElf ->
     DreadElf (4 kills) Ogre -> Ogre Warrior (5 kills) Ogre Mage ->
     Ogre Assassin (7 kills) Green Dragon -> Emerald Dragon (7 kills)

100. Made the fade twice as fast in Disection spell.

101. Changed that Magic Shield spell, so that casting a shield on a
     creature with maximum MR causes its MR_Recover rate to increase by
     one. Hence by casting lots of shields you can make something @{i}very@{ui}
     magic resistant.  Changed Protection to work the same way.

102. CHANGED BoardEffect so that when the effect is for the entire
     screen no sound is produced (I found things like "cure" were
     getting real annoying because they take several seconds to
     complete). [Note I am talking here about the GREENCIRCLEEX effect
     in cell.c]

103. CHANGED: Hybsil when shooting now affect Man and Recover stats
     making it more consistent with poison as the description says.

104. CONSISTENCY IMPROVEMENT: When you select sound off from the game
     menu it now turns off sound for the independents during both
     movement and casting.  This makes playing against 99 generators
     run considerable faster.

105. PASSAGE: Improved the comment on the Passage spell to reflect that
     fact that a mounted creature or mediation can also make passage.

106. BUG: Computer wizards (when either exposed or mounted) often
     choose not to move. No problem with that. Except sometimes they
     are adjacent to enemies cells and they still don't move. In such
     circumstances it would be logical to at least make an attack OR an
     attempt to move away.

107. Fixed another bug perhaps causing problems with warped wizards.

108. BUG: Place the mouse pointer over a cell or spell on the edge of
     the board.  Now move the mousepointer to off the board and back.
     The display is now blank (it doesn't say what you are pointing
     at). You must first move to ANOTHER cell and then back. This bug
     has been around for a long long time on the board and now it is
     there in the spell list also. NOW FIXED.

109. ADDED some new wizard names.

110. EDITED descriptions of OgreWarrior, Ogre Assassin and Ogre Mage.
     Since the Ogre Mage description says he is trained in the medical
     arts I gave him special combat of -1 against life.

111. Changed Texas Trade'em into Texas Trash'em since you don't trade
     spells in, you trash them (discard them).

112. PROBLEM: when you cast a spell it tells you the range, which isn't
     very useful. I would much rather know the multiplicity so I know
     how many attempts I get with the spell. I've been wanting this
     feature since the first time I played the game years ago; I could
     never remember how many attempts of Justice, Dark Power and the
     various tree spells I was going to get. This made it difficult to
     plan where to cast my trees. NOW FIXED.

113. SHORTCOMING: Q key does not work on the spell list. NOW FIXED.

114. BUG: At the beginning of a person's movement phase there is text
     left over from the previous person's movement. NOW FIXED.

115. NEW SPELLS: Magic Wand and Vodka. Neither have a real graphic yet.
     I won't make any graphics till I implement the graphics upgrade. I
     just had to program these in real quick while I still remembered
     where to put the code fragments that make them work.

116. BUG: Computer players keep casting Demonic touch and then aborting
     it even though there are low-combat creatures nearby! NOW FIXED.

117. REDUCED Thundermare combat to 12.

118. BUG: I just killed a wizard and for my bonus spell I picked the
     Crimson Death. It says its probability is 226% instead of -8% like
     it is supposed to. NOW FIXED.

119. BUG: A sleeping Vortex is moving around the board! NOW FIXED.

120. Vortex description no longer says it leaves a trail of distorted
     space in its wake.

121. NEW FEATURE: The "c" key now works on your spell list! I've been
     wanting this feature for years. Now that I've got it, it is
     totally cool! You can @{i}instantly@{ui} determine all the potential
     targets of any spell in your list.  This is so much easier than
     having to read the 2nd info screen of a spell to see if it is
     allowed to be cast on certain types of things (like growths or
     inanimates or corpses) etc. etc.

122. UPDATED THE DOCS for "c" key and multiplicity.

123. BUGS: The speech for Lich Lord and ShapeChanger doesn't work due
     to a typographical error in the phonetic spelling. All these years
     I thought you had intentionally left out speech for the
     ShapeChanger. Oh well, its NOW FIXED.

124. FIXED the awful pronunciation of "Justice", "Castle", "Confidence",
     "Coercion", Ogre", "Ogre Mage", Ogre Assassin", "Ogre Warrior" and
     "Falcon". Justice had been pronounced "Justayce" for years and
     "Falcon" had been pronounced "Foilcon" for years. NOW FIXED.

125. PROBLEM: the spell manager issues warnings when I put a period at
     the end of a phonetic string. There should not be a warning for
     this. Erroneous warnings are also issued for the chars: ,()? NOW
     FIXED.

126. IMPROVED PRONUNCIATION of ALL SPELLS. I should have done this
     years ago, its so easy. And I only intend to use the algorythmic
     speech for a few more months before I replace it with digitized
     speech. Oh well. There were just sooo many spells which were using
     1 or more wrong phonemes. Certain spells had the correct phonemes
     but had the stress reversed (stress on 2nd syllable when it was
     supposed to be on the first or vice versa.) Almost every single
     spell file has changed now. COMPLETED. I didn't change the speech
     for Goblin Bomb and Hidden Horror so that people can sneakily cast
     them without their opponents noticing. hehehe.

127. PROBLEM: We were playing a multiplayer game. At some point while
     most of us were out of the room somebody moved some stuff around
     on the table by the keyboard. This resulted in a joystick falling
     onto the keyboard and resting on the return key. This made
     everyone end their turn at about 1 second intervals. I know this
     isn't much of a @{i}real@{ui} problem but still... I have now implemented
     End of Turn Confirmation. NOW FIXED.

128. Betrayal, Free and Subversion can no longer be cast on Artifacts.

129. AAAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!! MAJOR BUG!!! I just played a test game
     and I just cast Raise Dead on an enemy wizard. The Enemy wizard
     wasn't dead. He is now MY wizard and he's undead! You can also
     cast Raise Dead on your own wizard to make him suddenly become
     undead! This is all caused because of the lame way of defining
     classes of objects according to the highness or lowness of their
     ID number. Someday I'll go through and eliminate all that stuff
     like I've been wanting to do for years. But for now I'll just hack
     in a quick fix. NOW FIXED.

130. Casting sleep on an artifact puts it to sleep but since its owner
     is calculated right after that, it never says that it belongs to
     ASLEEP. Thus you cannot see if it is asleep or not. If someone
     casts sleep on an artifact that belongs to you it will be
     technically put to sleep (so it will collapse at some point) but
     it will still belong to you and you can still attack with it.

131. REMOVED Temporarily all the ADPCM code from the game since I
     probably won't really use it for a few more months till the
     OS2.04+ version and to save memory on the FINAL 1 meg version.

132. BUG: Sometimes computer controlled wizards attack their ally's
     creatures.  This only applies to computer controlled @{i}wizards@{ui}. The
     Creatures of the wizard don't get engaged to or attack allies,
     only the wizard himself.  Basically computer wizards are trying to
     mount their ally's mountable creatures. The problem was in
     ChooseDestination NOW REWRITTEN AND FIXED.

133. TORMENT description changed to say that it works for several
     "creature casts".

134. TORMENT description changed to say that it affects "all the other
     wizards"

135. COERCION description changed to say that it affects "all the other
     wizards"

136. BUG: Jerry cast Restoration on my cloaked wizard and it
     technically removed the cloak but it never redrew the wizard, so
     for the rest of the game it looked like he was cloaked on the
     board, but in fact was not. NOW FIXED.

137. BUG: Jerry cast "Orcs" while having a Magic Wand so I told him to
     press the "c" key to see where all he could cast his orcs but the
     "c" key didn't work! It doesn't seem to work on any multiplicity
     spells. NOW FIXED.

138. PLAYED 1 test game on 7Mhz 68000. Everything seemed to work ok,
     but the "End Turn" confirmation was too slow. Oh well.

139. Uploaded v2.5d demo version to Aminet. Upload rejected as usual.

140. LOAD/SAVE BUG: If you save a game with wizards in trees then
     reload it there is a MAJOR problem: When the tree collapses the
     wizard is invisible and "he's there but not really there" which
     makes him impossible to kill.  NOW FIXED.

141. MAJOR BUG: highlight ? with mouse then click on some cells. It
     will lock up quite frequently. Usually happens with cells on the
     upper right of the board. BUG NOW FIXED on OS 1.2 / 1.3 by hacking
     in some "IF OS < 1.3 THEN TrapRMB" code.

142. MAJOR BUG: Right Mouse Button on load/save screen under OS 1.3
     locks up the program. This is caused by the fact that the
     requester opens its own window without the TRAPRMB bit set. I
     don't know any way to make the requester open a TRAPRMB window. So
     we need to work around this bug some other way or just require OS
     2.04 or higher. OK, I have simply turned off the MENUVERIFY
     feature for the HiResWindow during the loading and saving screens
     and now it works perfectly under OS 1.3. NOW FIXED.

143. FLAW: A human wizard can no longer attack a tree that is occupied
     by another wizard. It just says "already occupied". I Changed this
     to not attack if the tree is occupied by an ally, otherwise attack
     the tree even if the tree itself is on your team. Ditto for all
     meditations. This change does not affect computer wizards and does
     not allow any of your own creatures to attack your own
     meditations. NOW FIXED.

144. SPEEDED UP: Lissajous box menu thingies.

145. BUG: I move my player 2 wizard into my ally's dark citadel and now
     I can't move him out! He's trapped! This was caused by the the
     fact that the "clear movement bit" code was OUTSIDE the main loop!
     So the MOVED bit was only being cleared after all players had
     moved! Thus I never noticed this since for player 1 (who I usually
     play) the MOVED bit was properly cleared. But for ALL other
     players the MOVED bit was set totally wrong. I went back and
     looked at all the old source code versions on my HD and they all
     have this same bug! ack. NOW FIXED.

146. CHANGED: Killing a generator now allows you to pick from 4 bonus
     spells instead of only 2; thus reflecting the extreme difficulty
     of killing a generator.

147. BUG: Computer wizards cast vodka on artifacts a lot, this
     effectively wastes the vodka spell. I have now simply removed the
     CAST_ARTIFACT from the CastInfo field so this is NOW FIXED.

148. BUG: If you save the game while Tormented, then reload, you
     suddenly have a MagicWand and Vodka powerup. NOW FIXED.

149. BUG: Depth removes line-of-sight requirements but its description
     says it is only supposed to allow unlimited range without changing
     line of sight requirements. This is due to a limitation in the
     spellcasting engine that any spell with max range automatically
     does not require line of sight.  There is currently NO WAY to have
     a spell have unlimited range yet require line of sight. So we need
     to either reduce the range of Depth down to 14 and edit the
     description accordingly, or we need to change the description of
     depth to say that it removes line of sight requirements also. Or we
     could change depth to be that it doesn't change range but it
     removes line of sight requirements. Or ??? OK, here is what I did:
     I changed the Depth description to state that you get unlimited
     range + you don't need line of sight.

150. NEW SPELL: Crystal Ball. This spell removes line of sight
     requirements for all spells.

151. NEW SPELL: Ubiquiscope. The Ubiquiscope is like a combination of
     Crystal Ball + Magic Wand.

152. NEW SPELLS: Fly, Singular Earthbind, Dual Earthbind, Nonarchery,
     Convert, Sword of Sassenrath, Cursed Sword, Mount, No Mount, No
     Grow, The Exorcist.

153. BUG: I vanished wizard 6 and then there was an enforcer hit on his
     turn!  This only happened on the turn IMMEDIATELY after I cast
     vanish on him. It never happened again after that. Ok, this was a
     problem with the game trying to move a wizard who had been warped.
     I have now fixed MoveWizard() to check the .warped bit and exit if
     it is set. NOW FIXED.

154. MODIFIED isStupidCast to prevent casting of Speed and Fly on
     Bolter Walls.

155. NEW FLAG: FLAG_HIGHCR for the Archery and Nonarchery spells so that
     computer wizards will use them more intelligently.

156. BUG: There is something wrong in the movement routine! The
     Exorcist can't move! It says "Cannot attack the living" when
     trying to move into an empty space! There are no other creatures
     nearby. Happened on turn 1. NOW FIXED.

157. BUG: uhmmm.. I've killed every single thing on the board and the
     game isn't ending. NOW FIXED.

158. BUG: uhmmm.. I've killed every single thing on the board and the
     game isn't ending. NOW FIXED.

159. PROBLEM WITH VICTORY CONDITIONS: When playing the game with the
     default settings of 4 generators you sometimes win on the first
     turn without even doing anything! (when the generators don't
     generate anything on turn 1). So I changed it so that to win the
     game you must now either kill or block all independent generators.
     NOW FIXED.

160. PROBLEM: When I select "Save as" I like to save the game with the
     turn number as part of the filename. But then I have to go back
     and check the score panel, then do save as again which is
     annoying. So now I display the turn on the "Save as" panel and the
     "About" panel too. NOW FIXED.

161. When the game ends it now tells you WHY it is ending.

162. UPLOADED v2.5d DEMO version to aminet on Sunday, June 27th, 1999.

@Toc "HistoryOfChaos"

Improvements from 2.2 to 2.3
----------------------------

  1. BUG: Computer wizards refused to cast Magic Bow if they had double
     or triple in effect. Bows and swords are cumulative so it is
     desirable to cast them with triple. NOW FIXED

  2. EDITED spell descriptions: Gray Elf, Willy, Arctic Wolf, Gravity,
     Virtue (btw: why is this spell called Virtue?), Paradigm Shift,
     Ball Lightning, Emerald Dragon, Battle Cry, Coercion (shouldn't
     this be called mind blank or something?), Materialize, Meddle.

  3. BUG: Magic Glass doesn't say "Blocks LOS Enemy Only" on 2nd info
     screen.  FIXED.

  4. BUG: a dragon just shot my wizard through a magic glass. The "l"
     key shows that the dragon does not have line of sight to my wizard
     yet he shot him anyway. The shooting routine (at least for
     independents) must not be taking into account Line of Sight rules
     100%. FIXED

  5. CHANGED: Dagger -> Poison Dagger

  6. CHANGED: Basilisk ranged weapon to attack movement rating.
     (Basilisks are supposed to paralyze with their gaze according to
     the Monster Manual 8)

  7. FLAW: Clicking on Ranged Combat on Info screen of Basilisk or
     Arctic Wolf does not highlight "Movement" so that you can see that
     they attack Movement instead of life. FIXED.

  8. Implemented req.library file requester into the game. I've been
     planning to do this for ages but never had time before. This has
     the following advantages: 1. Easy to use. 2. Features high-speed
     smooth scrolling. 3.  Features powerful pattern-matching. 4.
     Features directory caching.  (YAY!!!!) 5. I've been using it for
     years and it is perfectly reliable. 6.  No negotiation needed to
     use it in our products. 7. Only 18436 bytes in size. That's 27,700
     bytes smaller than reqtools.library and 22,508 bytes smaller than
     asl.library.

  9. PROBLEM: After I've played Chaos for several hours and I'm really
     tired I sometimes select load when I meant to select save.
     Sometimes I select save when I meant to select load with
     disasterous results. Sometimes this happens due to tiredness and
     sometimes due to a less than 100% Right Mouse Button. So I made
     the load and save screens noticeably different. PROBLEM SOLVED.

 10. PROBLEM, after selecting save then cancel the text at the bottom
     of the screen is erased so you can't tell whose turn it is. FIXED.

 11. BUG: Computer controlled archers refuse to shoot things that they
     don't have Line-of-Sight to. In other words, computer creatures
     which have archery ability are never actually @{i}using@{ui} their archery
     ability. NOW FIXED.

 12. CHANGED: Bolter to have 0 Combat. (Since they can't attack anyway.)

 13. CHANGED: Magic Glass to not need line of sight when casting it.
     And it can now be cast on corpses too.

 14. FLAW: After clicking on a flying creature the really cool mouse
     reporting is turned off so you can't automatically know what your
     mouse pointer is over. FIXED.

 15. FLAW: After clicking on a ground creature the really cool mouse
     reporting is sometimes turned off so you can't automatically know
     what your mouse pointer is over. FIXED.

 16. CHANGED: Inanimate objects are no longer highlighted in the color
     cycling color when you press the number keys. Technically, it was
     correct to highlight them with the color cycling color since their
     moved bit was not set but since you cannot move inanimate objects
     or even click on them I decided it was best to have them
     highlighted like other objects which can't currently be moved (in
     red). Ditto for growths.

 17. CHANGED: Speed spell gives 2 attempts instead of 3.

 18. Upgraded Bonus spell selection so that you can see what you did to
     earn the bonus spells.

 19. BUG: Pyrotechnics wasn't awarding bonus spells based upon what it
     killed.  It was always awarding the number of bonus spells
     associated with killing wizards rather than the creature actually
     killed. FIXED.

 20. BUG: Pyrotechnics wasn't awarding points based upon what it
     killed. It was always awarding the number of points of a wizard's
     initial life rather than the number of points of initial life of
     the creature killed. FIXED.

 21. Fixed Team score sorting bug. The problem was that the scores were
     being calculated based on team numbers but displayed based on
     player numbers. It needed to be calculated and displayed based on
     one or the other. NOW FIXED.

 22. BUG: Computer players are casting Magic Castles and Dark Citadels
     far away from themselves. FIXED. (This was considered stupid so I
     just modified isStupidCast to detect this.)

 23. CONFUSING: The display of the Team Icon on a Wizard's info screen
     display.  This is no longer needed due to the improved number keys
     + Team Score display. REMOVED.

 24. q key now quits from info panels any other key continues on just
     like a LMB (Left Mouse Button) press. Now using the q key RAWKS!

 25. BUG: Selecting QUIT from setup screen I or II causes the game to
     crash.  FIXED by commenting out the code for the QUIT and LOAD
     gadgets. This was the easiest and fastest way to fix this problem
     and it makes the program simpler and easier to understand since
     now the ONLY way to quit or load the game is from the dropdown
     menu in the main game.

 26. IMPROVED ChaosDocs.tex a bit.

 27. PROBLEM: I can't tell what my mouse pointer is pointing at when
     using the level editor because the really cool
     auto-mouse-reporting feature isn't there 8(. I just LOVE always
     knowing exactly what I'm pointing at because A) Some creatures
     look just alike and B) I don't remember what every spell looks
     like. Indeed, this is the main reason I liked using my mini-level
     editor; I always knew exactly what I was looking at because the
     computer always automatically told me, no guesswork involved.
     SOLUTION: I put in auto-mouse-reporting code into editor.tex.
     YAY!!!

 28. Implemented stat-editing on info panels when brought up from
     within the level editor (LevelEditorActive==YES). Use the mouse to
     click on the stat and then enter the new stat right on the screen.

 29. Modified combat, ranged combat, special combat gadgets to handle
     up to 4 chars. -15(NULL).

 30. BUG: Most recovery rate graphs are not being redrawn when clicking
     on Combat, Ranged Combat or Special Combat to see what they
     attack. FIXED.

 31. You can now edit attributes on the 2nd info panel. Just click on a
     stat to toggle it.

 32. Tested making an attacking, flying, shooting, meditation,
     mountable set 1, creature generator. Hehehehehee HARHARHAR
     ROFL!!!! It actually works! I can fly my DragonNest around the
     screen attacking and shooting things! And I can mount it and
     dismount it!!!! And it emits dragons for me even while my wizard
     is mounted in it!!!! ROFDL!!!! The game engine gets an A+ for
     allowing this to work on the first try!

 33. FIXED those blocks for Range and Move on info panel. Scooted them
     down 2 pixels.

 34. MAJOR FLAW: sometimes the speech doesn't work, sometimes it
     does... it is completely random. This affects monster names,
     creature names, player names, everything... NOW COMPLETELY FIXED.

 35. FIXED: Pressing Amiga-m or Amiga-n on info screens was clearing
     the info screen because ANY key triggered going to the next info
     screen. NOW FIXED by simply ignoring all keys except for q=quit
     and w,a,tab and return take you to the next info panel.

 36. Speeded up line of sight testing by about 30% in many cases. YAY!

 37. Speeded up SqDistance by 5% (eliminated 8 cycles) asm SqDistance
     is now over 12x as fast as C SqDistance. YAHOO!

 38. Speeded up SqDistance again. (Eliminated 4 cycles on 68000. 68030
     cycle count unchanged.

 39. PENTAGRAM VECTOR UPGRADE: Implemented hyper fast sin and cos asm
     functions.  (JCSin and JCCos) These functions require the input
     angle to be measured in units of jams, NOT degrees or radians. 1
     jam = 1/4096th of a complete circle. btw jams stands for "James'
     Angular Measurement System". This system fully utilizes the power
     of binary integer arithmetic inherent in all CPUs.

 40. Ok, I have now modified all those keypresses that highlight cells
     to temporarily disable the menus. EVERYTHING IS WORKING PERFECTLY
     NOW.

 41. About, New, Quit etc. (things in menu.tex) should get a lock on
     the board first to keep the animatortask from overwriting the
     display. FIXED.

 42. Attempting to edit, load or save produces the message "Removed
     from DEMO version. Please register."

 43. CHANGED: The level editor is no longer mentioned anywhere in the
     docs or the game due to the fact that it isn't completed yet, etc.

 44. Implemented Lissajous Squares Quit Menu thingy. I did this for the
     following reasons: 1. I wanted to do a really kewl requester. 2. I
     am vaguely planning to play a different piece of music on each
     requester in menu.tex; therefore, I need all the requesters to be
     silent so as not to interfere with the music. 3. Amiga
     color-cycling RULEZ! FEATURES: 1. Looks kewl. 2. 31 colors are
     cycled. 3. Just when you think it is going to shoot off the screen
     it arcs around and comes back. 4. Fast. 5. Smooth. 6.  Infinite
     variety. (Only the first one is the same each time, after that
     they are randomly generated. Zillions of different designs.) 8.
     Utilizes Asm TestPixel, JCSin and JCCos.

 45. Minor touchups on Setup Screen I

 46. Edited description of Reflector.

 47. Replaced "New Game" requester with Lissajous Squares version.

 48. Changed default spell list to 99. Thus anyone playing the demo
     version will definitely see lots of spells that they never get a
     chance to cast.  hehehehe.

 49. Other miscellaneous bugfixes.

 50. Edited docs to include info about the demo version.

 51. Reduced the length of a demo game to 18 turns because I played a
     test game and I won in about 15 turns due to Classic mode giving
     me lots of tough creatures to squash the independents with. (I was
     controlling 2 wizards against 4 generators.)

 52. Ok the game is now working on the 7Mhz 68000 but for some reason
     when you select a team all the checkmarks on setup screen I are
     redrawn. This totally stops the quadrascopes for a second...

 53. BUG: The speech always seems to work during casting phase but it
     seems to only work randomly during movement phase. Hacking more
     changes to Say() in an attempt to make this problem go away.

 54. OK I think I found the speech bug: an intervening use of
     text_store between say() and waitforsay(). Tested and the speech
     is working 100% now.

 55. Made various changes to print what is being said first, then
     actually saying it. Thus you can read what it is saying for the 2
     or 3 seconds that it is saying it.

 56. CHANGED Aerial Servant and Combat to be CLASSIC.

 57. BUG: Spriggan speech doesn't work. Allegedly FIXED by removing the
     "2" from the end of the speech.

 58. Speeded up TestPixel. Saved 4 cycles on 68000 or 2 cycles on 68030.

 59. Put in some checksums for lamer protection.

 60. BUG: Any errors in the early startup phase (e.g. it can't open a
     certain file) result in a crash. NOW FIXED.

 61. CHANGED: the default font for the game to be pearl.font (now
     included in the fonts/ dir.) I did this for 3 main reasons: 1.
     Games which use the standard topaz font always seem "cheap"
     compared to games which use their own custom font. It just somehow
     feels more "commercial" when you play a game with a font different
     than the one you are used to looking at all the time. 2. The
     lowercase i of Topaz sucks. 3. I have tested many, many fonts to
     find the one which is the easiest to read. And pearl is it. I have
     had pearl.font as the default font on my Amiga for several years
     now. It just makes everything easier to read. @{i}Especially@{ui} 640x512
     resolution text which is the resolution that I run everything in.
     I realize that Chaos does not currently use that high a resolution
     but I just tested several fonts a few mins ago against pearl in
     640x256 mode and I could still see the difference.

 62. SMOOTHED out the outlining of the Large font during the intro. The
     outlining used to appear blocky on certain letters. Now the jagged
     edges are rounded off. This has the drawback of almost doubling
     the execution speed of FancyWriteText but the slowness will really
     only be noticeable on the 7 Mhz 68000 and for UAE lamers. Oh
     well.... too bad for them...

 63. STUPID: Computer wizards cast Ball Lightning on a Generator which
     already had 0 combat. NOW FIXED.

 64. STUPID: Computer wizards cast Demonic Touch on other wizards who
     only had 1 combat point. NOW FIXED.

 65. ADDED: Stupidity checking for Shocker.

 66. IMPROVED: Stupidity checking for Archery.

 67. BUG: FLAG_NOWIZARDCELL is broken. Wizards routinely cast spells
     like Subversion and Betrayal, etc. on creatures which have mounted
     wizards. NOW FIXED.

 68. STUPID: My allied wizard just cast a pool far away from himself
     and right up next to his enemy's base camp. FIXED.

 69. STUPID: Wizards sometimes cast Magic Wood trees directly adjacent
     to enemy wizards. FIXED.

 70. LESS THAN INTELLIGENT: Computer wizards only cast castles directly
     adjacent to themselves, they never cast castles across the screen
     to be adjacent to one of their allies. NOW FIXED and totally cool.

 71. MAJOR BUG: I just moved my Aerial Servant onto a Mass Resurrect
     Scroll.  Then somebody justiced my servant and killed it and I
     guess it "reinstated" the scroll. Anyway there is now a weird
     creature whose 3 frames of animation are Lion, Dead Lion, Mass
     Resurrect Scroll. It's stats are totally freaked out with numbers
     like 78 and -78. It eats Hydras, it's Mountable Set 1 and it's a
     flying meditation growth that can attack both living and undead
     creatures. Weird stuff. The mouse thinks it is a Mass Resurrect
     scroll that belongs to me, therefore its movement bit doesn't get
     cleared so I can't click on it and move it. darn. I didn't have
     time to try to mount it. I wonder what would have happened? NOW
     FIXED.

 72. FLAW: I tried to cast my python on a Ghost scroll and it said
     "Cannot cast on Creatures" rather than the more appropriate
     "Cannot cast on Scrolls" FIXED.

 73. BUG: A Faun Scroll just put my Ghoul to sleep! FIXED.

 74. BUG: Dark Powering a snake that is standing on a scroll kills the
     snake and makes the scroll disappear. FIXED.

 75. BUG: snake stands on dead vampire. Justice Snake regenerates a
     living vampire rather than an undead vampire. ERADICATED.

 76. BUG: Play a game with 99 scrolls. Start a new game. After
     ScrollDelay turns NOBODY is awarded jillions of spells from many
     (but not all) blank spaces on the board. Traced this to a problem
     in ClearBoard(); NOW FIXED.

 77. BUG: Generator Scroll just generated a Hydra. This was so
     hilarious that I almost left this bug in the game... oh well, I
     FIXED it.

 78. BUG: I was riding a unicorn and I cast reincarnate on my unicorn.
     I was surrounded by enemy monsters, they killed my unicorn and it
     reincarnated into a spider then they killed the spider and it
     became a beetle then a goblin killed the beetle and stepped onto
     the square! I could still cast spells but I couldn't dismount the
     independent goblin. This goblin also had an identity crisis; each
     turn when I clicked on the "end turn" gadget; this goblin would
     attack independent creatures for me all on its own. But when it
     was the Independent's turn it would act like an independent goblin
     and attack my creatures. I made a small correction to Reinstate()
     and tested it so this is NOW FIXED.

 79. BUG: I killed 5 things with my WoodElf and it sure enough became a
     DreadElf but it belonged to NOBODY! FIXED.

 80. BUG: I killed 7 things with my GreenDragon and it became an
     Emerald Dragon belonging to NOBODY. FIXED.

 81. BUG: I killed 20 things with my RedDragon but it didn't give me a
     Vampire Spell. FIXED.

 82. I got sick of the lameness of C so I invented a new language
     called JC. JC stands for "James' C", "James Conwell" and "GET
     THOSE GAWDAM FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT LAME-ASS BRACES {} OUTTA MY
     FACE!" 8) Have you ever wished C didn't have all those lame curly
     braces? {} Then JC is for you. Have you ever wished C had Array
     Bounds Checking? Then JC is for you. Have you ever wished C would
     properly indent your source code for you? Then JC is for you. Have
     you ever said "C is the greatest language ever. Its ease of use is
     remarkable, its syntax is unsurpassed and its execution speed
     cannot be matched by even the best assembly language programmers"?
     Then you are seriously deranged and JC is not for you.  Read the
     readme.txt file for complete information.

 83. All source files upgraded to JC.

 84. BUG: when a creature ends it movement the "Range = X" line of
     WriteNearBottom is not erased. FIXED.

 85. BUG: I was playing a game and there were no indpendents left
     alive. After I went the computer said "INDEPENDENTS" and them
     immediately started making lots of bonus spell noises and stuff.
     This was caused by the awarding of bonus spells from manabatteries
     etc. So there needs to be some sort of notification that the game
     is processing the update phase and is NOT still doing the
     Independent movement. FIXED.

 86. BUG: The Repulsion spell does not repel scrolls properly.
     Sometimes there is a cell which contains nothing while the
     underpart contains the scroll that used to be there. This results
     in NOBODY collecting lots of free scrolls from empty cells. FIXED.

 87. FLAW: Abduction spell abducts artifacts then the artifact owners
     are immediately recalculated in the update phase so the net effect
     is nil. NOW FIXED: Abduction no longer targets artifacts.

 88. BUG: Plasma Beam locked up the game. (oops a misplaced END_IF) NOW
     FIXED.

 89. Put in some simple IFs to reduce the intensity of the background
     color on lissajous squares but this seems to have completely
     stopped the background color cycling 8(

 90. COOL! I FINALLY found the bug in my lissajous background color
     cycler! Now it does more or less what I had intended it to do!

 91. Jerry cast a cat lord and the cat lord immediately cast a Jaguar
     but the Jaguar allegedly never moved (several turns) till Jerry
     killed the Cat Lord. The cats which were already on the board when
     the Cat Lord was cast all worked like they were supposed to. They
     moved around and killed things, etc. Unfortunately I didn't pay
     that much attention to it. I think the Jaguar may simply have been
     sitting by a pool the entire time.

 92. TEMPEST BUG: Jerry cast a Tempest whose Life Force and Recovery
     and Combat kept mysteriously rising. Furthermore, it managed to
     accumulate several Foes Killed every single turn even though it
     never killed anything. And this happened whether it teleported
     something or not. By the end of the game it had 54 Foes
     Vanquished. Ok I have determined that Tempests were "killing"
     every empty cell that they moved onto and they were also "killing"
     every dead body that they were moving onto. Presumably, killing an
     empty cell was its favorite food and that is why its stats were
     raising so high. TEMPEST BUG FIXED.

 93. BUG: Sleeping Tempests could still move. FIXED.

 94. SCROLLING now at priority 50. This fixes the above occaissional
     glitches for nearly all situations.

 95. Put in 3 different MeltScreen effects. There is a problem in
     knowing how to redraw the right hand side of the screen after this
     effect. I don't know how to solve this.

 96. Biohazard now uses the MeltScreen(SINK) effect.

 97. Devastation now uses MeltScreen(SUCK)

 98. WaveScreen effects: You can now make the entire screen wave with
     StartWavyTask (screen, 1); Small numbers mean more radical waving.
     Larger numbers mean very gentle waving. I implemented this as its
     own task because this effect can be used WHILE WE PLAY THE GAME AS
     USUAL. Kewl!

 99. Bless and Haste now utilize the WavyScreen effect.

100. Reduced the probability of Bipedal Generators.

101. FLAW: the 2nd menu strip (CONTROLS: Speech, Sound, Impurities
     etc.) does not highlight correctly. This dates all the way back to
     v1.0 FIXED.

102. FLAW: Something about the game that has always really bothered me
     is that there was no way to know what turn it was. Grrr... When I
     play a long long game I have no idea how many turns I've played. I
     like to know what turn it is so that I know about how many spells
     I have left and because sometimes I play a ridiculously hard game
     just to see how many turns I can survive.  FIXED. The turn # is
     now displayed on the Scores Screen.

103. UPLOADED version 2.3d to Aminet.

Improvements from 2.1 to 2.2
----------------------------

  1. The spell selection by computer players was notably slower on the
     A500 (this is your new regime of spell selection). However, the
     real problem here was that there was not enough on screen
     indication of what was happening. NOW FIXED

  2. Somehow there was a sleeping neo-otuygh which was not redrawn.

  3. Somehow there was a sleeping ogre-mage that was still animated.

  4. The team scores were still not correctly sorted.

  5. Several times players shot there own "hidden horrors" to reveal
     the red dragon. I think the probability of the hidden horror needs
     to be reduced below that of the red dragon. NOW FIXED

  6. The game locks up on the A500 when starting a new game after the
     completion on the previous game. The only seems to happen when
     there are lots of wizards. It can also be avoided by starting a
     new game from the menu before the game ends naturally. I am
     assuming that this situation is because memory is tight. NOW FIXED

  7. The teleport explode effect is applied to the wrong player. NOW
     FIXED

  8. The boil explode effect is applied to fire rather than water. NOW
     FIXED

  9. The initial set up was the same every time the program was loaded.
     NOW FIXED

 10. If you set the number of turns to "n" you actually get "n+1"
     turns. NOW FIXED

 11. Computer wizards and not conforming to the rules regarding the
     necropotence spell and discard spell. NOW FIXED

 12. Dad pressed the end-turn gadget in an attempt to cancel a spell.
     Instead it tried to cast the creature to some location off the
     bottom of the screen.  NOW FIXED (end of turn ghosted during
     casting)

 13. There is insufficient information given to the player indicating
     the pick up of a scroll. NOW FIXED (there is a text message and an
     audio effect)

 14. Casting Biohazard gave all scrolls recovery -1 and they
     subsequently all died in the next round. NOW ALLEGEDLY FIXED

 15. Flying creatures still show wings cursor even when engaged. NOW
     FIXED

 16. I cast a Meddle causing the nightmare I was mounted to become a
     skeleton (i.e. I should now have been mounted on a skeleton); but
     when I moved the skeleton my wizard was not moved. I think this
     means I need to check the "mounted" bit carefully when doing
     reincarnation. ALLEGEDLY FIXED

 17. Glen pointed out that the archery spell description does not
     actually say what the spell does, although he guessed correctly.
     NOW FIXED.

 18. Callum wanted "RETURN" to mean end-of-turn. NOW FIXED

 19. Callum suggested the right hand set of bars on the info pages be
     labelled "Recovery" at the top. NOW FIXED

 20. Fixed a bug with Repulsion which could leave the colours
     permanently screwed up.

 21. Made isStupidCast compliant with agent casting.

 22. Made menu option for script font on info screens.

 23. Made menu option for agent casting.

 24. Stopped the computer from moved onto nuked squares. Allowed
     computer creatures to decide the best option is not to move.

 25. Computer wizards now move towards and stay on scrolls.

 26. Added Turns, Dread Elf, Dagger, Gravity, Demonic Touch

 27. Added secret power up WoodElf->DreadElf (make 5 kills with wood
     elf)

 28. Added gravity to information display.

 29. Fixed FileIO to save gravity information.

 30. Fixed end-of-game bug that caused lockups. Still haven't fixed the
     quit bug.

 31. Allegedly completed implementation of Volcano.

 32. Added two new generators: one for birds, one for dragons.

 33. Improved the loading and saving of the probability table.

 34. FIXED at last the ReleaseSemaphore problem when quiting the game.

 35. Made fake wizards actually capable of spell casting.

 36. Allowed combat on movement rating (see Arctic Wolf).

 37. Added: Arctic Wolf, Virtue, Shadow City, Basilisk, Achiyalabopa,
     and Paradigm Shift.

 38. Made <RETURN> equivalent to end-of-turn. Problem: holding down
     return will cause multiple player to have end-of-turn. To overcome
     this I have put in a delay, but this is a rather weak solution. If
     only there was a RAWKEYUP IDCMP event this would be easy to fix,
     but I couldn't find anything in the docs about doing this.

 39. Replaced $ in chaos.font with a bullet.

 40. Improved the image for the Nuke spell.

 41. Improved the image for the Lightning spell.

 42. Added: Animate, Ball Lightning, Shocker, Basalt Golem, Emerald
     Dragon, Willy, Glass, Battle Cry, Coercion, Confidence, Eye for an
     Eye, Torment, and Materialize.

 43. Made the secret powerup GreenDragon->EmeraldDragon.

 44. Implemented Eye-for-an-Eye in combat routines.

 45. Fixed a small problem in the intro sequence where "Wizards" and
     "Webs" were printed multiple times.

 46. Added new powerups for creatures making high numbers of kills (in
     the form of specific bonus spells).

 47. Devastation spell now correctly awards points.

 48. Added casting contraints to computer spell selection for new
     spells.

 49. Moved the foes vanquished display onto the first info screen.

 50. Added editor support for artifacts.

 51. Replaced the reqtools with a file requester of my own making. It
     is pretty slack at the moment, but at least we can get rid of
     reqtools now. This is good for three reasons: (i) less effort for
     users (don't need to install reqtools), (ii) smaller overall
     memory requirement for game, (iii) no negotiation needed with
     reqtools author for a commercial release.

 52. Allegedly reduced the likelihood of computer creatures shooting
     wizards protected with invulnerability.

 53. If the level now increases above 5, then new spells (and the
     initial spell list in the case of computer wizards) will be
     composed mainly of unique spells.

 54. Converted the Intelligence stat from 3 bits to 4 bits and modified
     all spell files, info.tex, and cast.tex accordingly. If we made
     .MR 4 bits most stats would then be the same, but the MR case
     would be a lot harder to do than Intel was.

 55. Added FLAG_NOWIZARDCELL to the computer assistance flags, to
     indicate spells not to be applied to cells containing a wizard
     even if the wizard is mounted or meditating (e.g. Alter Reality).

 56. Creatures killing their favourite food now get a combat and
     recovery rate boost.

@Toc "HistoryOfChaos"

Improvements from 2.0 to 2.1
----------------------------

  1. BUG: Wizard kills some creatures. Wizard mounts something. Mount
     dies permanently. Wizard's vanquished foes info not copied into
     cell.vanquished.  FIXED

  2. BUG: same as above but with collapsing meditations. FIXED

  3. Inserted version information compatible with the AmigaDOS version
     command.

  4. ARTIFACTS UPGRADE

  5. Hidden Artifacts implemented.

  6. Now that I have implemented hidden artifacts and scrolls I find
     that I cannot attack objects that belong to NOBODY. I'm not fixing
     this right away so that I can play the game like this for a while
     and see what it is like.  The game does let me shoot objects
     belonging to NOBODY though. NOW FIXED.

  7. Made numerous changes so that killing any object that is covering
     a scroll or artifact does NOT destroy the scroll/artifact. In
     general, if a creature dies while on top of a scroll then the
     corpse for the creature goes to the underpart and the scroll goes
     to the top part.

  8. Hidden scrolls and artifacts are now fully supported. You can now
     "dig up" buried scrolls and artifacts. You can now have wars over
     a particular scroll, with one creature moving onto the cell and
     being killed by another creature who is then killed by yet
     another, ad infinitum and the scroll won't be destroyed.

  9. Made 2 fixes to prevent Thundermare and Iridium transformations
     from destroying scrolls underfoot.

 10. Set CAST_ARTIFACT on all appropriate magic spell files. Artifact
     creatures are treated just like any other creature for purposes of
     spell-casting.

 11. Hidden Scrolls implemented.

 12. Inanimate objects can no longer pick up scrolls.

 13. Changed spider description to say that it eats scrolls. (since the
     act of laying a web destroys any scroll that may have been
     underneath it.)

 14. Scroll delay implemented. So now it is @{i}very@{ui} possible to have wars
     over scrolls. You can set the scroll delay to 3 turns and then you
     must take the cell and HOLD it for 3 turns straight. If someone
     dislodges you from the cell before 3 turns is up then you don't
     get the scroll and must retake it and start over.

 15. BUG: Ropers destroy whatever they are standing on when
     teleporting. Oops no it doesn't. When the roper teleports it takes
     whatever it is standing on with it. Interesting.

 16. BUGS: Roper scrolls teleport, growth scrolls alter growth rates,
     Spider scrolls lay webs, Haunt scrolls change sides, meditation
     scrolls collapse, spriggan scrolls "take a kip". ALL FIXED NOW.

 17. Improved computer spell selection. This should completely
     eliminate all the really stupid casts where the wizard tries to
     cast an impossible spell due to there not being any legal targets.
     (Such as casting Raise Dead when there are NO corpses in range.)

 18. BUGS: Computer wizards were cheating! They were going through
     their ENTIRE spell list and casting any spell they wanted! And
     they were going through their entire spell list and discarding any
     spell they wanted! NOW FIXED

 19. New function: isStupidCast.

 20. Improved computer spell selection by using isStupidCast along with
     isIllegalCast. Now if a wizard contemplates casting combat but his
     only legal targets are enemy creatures or his own combat aerial
     servant he will simply decide that casting combat in this
     situation would be stupid and will cast something else instead.

 21. ADDED lots of extra checks for spells to probably not cast while
     double or triple is in effect.

 22. ADDED complete stupidity checking regarding multiple wizard
     powerups.

 23. FLAW: A computer wizard was in a tree. There were several legal
     targets for the slow spell that he cast but unfortunately, all the
     targets were already speed 1 so the spell was really wasted. NOW
     FIXED.

 24. SMALL FLAW: A computer wizard in a Dark Citadel just cast Speed on
     his Floating Eye. I'm sure he had at least a few other spells that
     would have been better. NOW FIXED.

 25. FLAW: A computer wizard cast Sanctuary on himself even though he
     already had Recover Boost. (He had no creatures on the board). He
     should have cast any one of a number of other better spells. NOW
     FIXED.

 26. Numerous other flawed spell selections fixed using the same method
     as above. This new "look before you cast" strategy is really
     working out nicely! The only strategy game that might be better
     than Chaos is Chaos Coding.

 27. BUG: I just surrounded a computer wizard with weak walls. (He had
     already selected Lightning as his spell). When it became his turn
     to cast he cast it on one of my weak walls. The wall then had 83
     life points. Fixed by SAI.

 28. After ages of hacking and slashing music asm code I am now ready to
     integrate the new music playback system into Chaos.

 29. Commented out EVERYTHING to do with the awful ptreplay.library.
     Now that the new music system is @{i}finally@{ui} in and working:
     ADVANTAGES of new music system vs. ptreplay.library: 1. It
     actually works. 2. It works on MC68000 processors unlike
     ptreplay.library. 3. It can play Sound/Noise/Mutant/ProTracker
     music without messing them up like ptreplay.library did. 4. Also
     supports 8-channel Oktalyzer music. (untested at this time)
     ptreplay.library has no 8-channel support. 5. It has a rudimentary
     IFF 8SVX sound sample play routine also. 6. It was originally
     written by my good buddy Bryan Ford the MEGACODER. 7. It is very
     easy to add med/octamed support should we decide to do so. 8. It
     is very easy to add support for a BUNCH of other music formats but
     those other formats are all irrelevant AFAIK. 9. MOST IMPORTANTLY:
     It _shares_ the sound channels in a system friendly manner!!!
     Something that _NO_ other replay routine does!!! (That I know of
     or could find any evidence of or have even heard of.)
     DISADVANTAGES of new music system vs. ptreplay.library. 1. Takes
     26k instead of only 10k. 2. It might be a LOT slower. I just don't
     know. We need to somehow test its speed by running a program and
     timing it then running the same program again with the music going
     and see if there is a speed difference. 3. It isn't a shared
     library so it can't be flushed out in a low memory situation. 4.
     It doesn't have volume fade in/out because I haven't got around to
     implementing that yet. This isn't really a disadvantage though
     since the volume fade in/out of ptreplay.library caused crashes
     anyway.

 30. DELETED all code related to ptreplay.library.

 31. BUG? I was playing a nice little game... I had surrounded a bipedal
     generator except for 1 cell. I just cast a faun into that cell.
     Then it said "Banderlog sleep" and my Red Dragon was put to sleep
     and instantly collapsed! ARGH! There are no banderlog's on the
     screen! Could my Faun have cast sleep on my own creature? The
     exact same thing just happened again!  This time my gorilla got
     put to sleep! I think maybe I am casting creatures onto a dead
     banderlog. Now I'm in a completely different situation and my Faun
     just put my harpy to sleep. This faun has killed more of my
     creatures than the enemy has. Now my other faun on the other side
     of the board put my manticore to sleep. I guess Fauns just cast
     their sleep spell on anybody...  Now my faun put my Crocodile to
     sleep.

 32. Quadrascope and Spectrogram added to the setup screens to go along
     with the music.

 33. BUG: When a creature is engaged it can still "attack" an empty
     cell and move onto it. NOW FIXED for human players. This bug may
     still exist for computer players.

 34. I made a smake release and tested it on my A2000 and disabled the
     chipram down to 512k to see if it would work. IT DID!!! AMIGA
     RULES!!! I just can't imagine any W95 program running with only
     55k of free ram and not crashing after 5 minutes or so.

 35. Adjusted alignment of scopes to allow them to run a bit faster.
     Saves 64 chipram reads and 64 chipram writes per frame drawn per
     scope. Rewrote the quadrascopes to run at 3x the framerate that
     they were running previously.  They now run at MAXIMUM speed (50
     fps). Quadrascopes are now much more "electric".

 36. BUG: Artifact ties were being awarded to the higher player number
     rather than to NOBODY. NOW FIXED.

 37. BUG: Inanimate objects are exerting influence on artifacts. NOW
     FIXED.

 38. BUG: Joe cast Magic Bolt on a web and it increased the web's life
     to 33 points or something. Now REALLY fixed.

 39. BUG: I cast a Magic Bolt on a freshly generated skeleton. The
     skeleton then had 25 life points! Now REALLY fixed.

 40. BUG: computer wizard cast dark citadel several squares away.

 41. Edited some spell descriptions and removed spell-casting ability
     from Faun because I really hated it and couldn't stand it any
     longer.

 42. FLAW: Wizards kept subverting/abducting/betraying artifacts. NOW
     FIXED.

 43. Changed: Bipedal generators no longer produce bears.

 44. Changed: Moved end-of-turn gadget to be FAR away from question
     mark gadget.  My entire family has been bugging me about this for
     years. Every time we play they say "That shouldn't be there next
     to the question mark."

 45. l key for line of sight. It works like the other keypresses execpt
     that this one simply shows all the cells that can be seen from the
     current cell.  This is very useful if you are thinking of casting
     a certain spell that needs line-of-sight and you want to be sure
     that you have it. Simply place the mouse pointer over your wizard
     and press "l" to see all the cells that he has line-of-sight into.

 46. Fixed it so that the game startup after setup screen II doesn't
     look so bad on slow machines.

 47. The line of sight testing was just too slow on A500.

@Next "1_81-1_9"
@Prev "2_0-2_1"
@Toc "HistoryOfChaos"

Improvements from 1.9 to 2.0
----------------------------

  1. Made minor changes to most of the new spell descriptions: Abath,
     Abduction, Acid Rain, Amphisbaena, Archery, Betrayal, Thundermare,
     Iridium Horse, Chaos Lord, Devastation, Disection, Hidden Horror,
     Mana Battery, Meddle, Necropotence, Points, Bipedal Generator.

  2. 1 bug in DoComputerCast removed.

  3. I could find no evidence in the casting code of Depth removing LOS
     requirements so I changed the description of Depth accordingly.

  4. DoComputerCast never checks the CAST_GROWTH bit. This explains why
     they cast weird spells on growths. They were cheating!

  5. DoComputerCast never checks for the presence of an Arborist spell.
     Poor guys. They could NEVER put 2 trees next to each other.

  6. That's a total of 4 discrepancies between DoCast and
     DoComputerCast. I fixed all this by writing a new "Grand Unified
     Spellcasting Rules Function" that DoCast and DoComputerCast and
     the "c" key all use to determine if a postulated cell/spell/wizard
     combination would be legal or not. This should help to eliminate
     lots of bugs in the future. From now on, all spellcasting rules
     just go one place ObeySpellCastingRules. This ensures that both
     computer wizards and human wizards and agents all follow the exact
     same set of rules.

  7. c = casting. During the spellcasting phase you can press c and all
     the legal targets for your spell are highlighted in the color
     cycling color.  This can be useful in the regular game as well as
     for testing the spellcasting rules.

  8. q = query = question mark to bring up info screens.

  9. Added new subsection to the docs "Keys" Plus other small
     improvements.

 10. Mini Level Editor Upgrade.

 11. Added the bar graphs of the recovery rates to the information
     panel.

 12. Columnarized the stats on the 2nd info screen so SAI will have
     room to implement his "Creatures Killed" stuff. In my notes I
     called it "Foes Vanquished"

 13. Fixed that annoying problem where an independent creature could
     move next to one of your creatures and attack it while the
     highlight sprite didn't bother to highlight the creature in its
     new cell until AFTER the attack was complete and even then it was
     instantly turned off. NOW FIXED. The sprite now appears to keep up
     much better.

 14. BUG: The computer seems to think that player 2 and DEADP are on
     the same team. It looked very strange when I pressed "2" and all
     the dead things on the screen lit up in BLUE. NOW FIXED.

 15. FLAW: ChaosLord did not set the FLYING_STAT bit of the wizard. NOW
     FIXED.

 16. MAJOR new gameplay mechanic: scrolls. Sometimes it is just plain
     fun to collect things and add them to your colletion. This applies
     to both games and real life. To some extent it adds the
     "Colonization" Play-Mechanic because you want to hurry up and grab
     as many scrolls as you can early in the game rather than just
     sitting in a tree meditating. btw: Scrolls make being player 7 or
     8 more advantageous. All in all Scrolls make a powerful additional
     option for an already superb game. There are now some intriguing
     new ways to play the game. Like start with 0 or 1 spells but 99
     Scrolls with you against 3 enemy wizards and 1 generator. It makes
     the game take on a whole new flavor.

 17. I was having a serious bug where scrolls with an ID > RevealID
     were being inserted into cells. This caused enforcer hits and lots
     of crashes.

 18. BUG: Program lets you select growths to move. NOW FIXED.

 19. Fixed MassMorph to not destroy bipedal generators.

 20. Made independent attract to Mana Battery.

 21. Fixed problem of info of spells without description.

 22. Made minor changes to game docs.

 23. Made a slight change to the testing of spells during scroll
     insertion.

 24. Started implementation of foes vanquished.

 25. Modified editor to work with scrolls.

 26. Added scrolls docs to user docs. Didn't do it very well however.

 27. Fixed Abduction and Raise Dead (for some reason Raise Dead was
     leaving the corpse underneath). Actually I think that means the
     corpse was already there which means there is something else wrong
     as well.

 28. Vanquished foes now working including saving of this information.
     However, I am not at all convinced that memory is been released
     properly in all cases when an object dies, e.g. when a creature
     falls in a pit. Also when a spell like Replicate is used, this
     replicates the vanquished list for that creature as well (not
     quite, both creatures end up using the same list-since this is
     rather neat I haven't changed it).

 29. Implemented a bomb explosion effect. It is now used for Nuke and
     the Goblin Bomb.

 30. Fixed the recovery rate code.

Improvements from 1.81 to 1.9
-----------------------------

  1. Incorporated new image data.

  2. Added the following new spells: Derro, Mud Man, Spriggan,
     Agathion, Annis, Azer, Banderlog, Bodak, Cat Lord, Jann, Marid,
     Shade, Dao, Bandit, Hybsil, Fire Bat, Shadow Dragon, Spectator,
     Crimson, Drelb, Haunt, Juju, Solar, Quickshot, Discard, Boil,
     Passage.

  3. Fixed the graphics for the golden and platinum dragon.

  4. Played a game; quickly remembered that I hadn't finished the
     coding for all my new spells. The image for Quickshot has some how
     got inverted, very strange. There were still lots of dead wizards
     lying about the screen. A cloaked sleeping dragon did not appear
     cloaked on the screen. The program crashed when a manticore shot a
     magic wood tree.

  5. Made a change in move.tex hopefully to stop dead wizards.

  6. Added the SPRITES flag to the Chaos screen.

  7. Discovered that CHAOSANIM is causing a huge number of enforcer
     violations.  I suspect this may be because there is an unbalanced
     ReleaseSemaphore in the program. It seems to start happening after
     a wizard dies. I removed my changes, but it didn't improve the
     situation.

  8. Completed the preliminary coding for the spell manager for
     creatures.

  9. Fixed a bug wherby a dead wizard with the "Uncertainity" spell
     could result in dead creatures being case as if they were alive.

 10. Allegedly modified te freeze spell to work on independents. --JC
     tested this and it really works.

 11. Completed spell files for all objects on the board.

 12. Whew, I have just finished making spell files for all our spells
     (all 255 of them, now I added my new ones). The next one should be
     interesting since any byte quantities hanging around related to
     spells might break. Well, I won't be adding any more for a little
     while anyway.

 13. Change the ordering of spells by swapping LichLord with Mutate (so
     that all computer assistance spells come after consecrate).

 14. The was obviously a problem reading "chaos.prb" because all the
     spells were unusual ones. Fixed that problem. But then the game
     crashed just after a wizard died. Suspecting my fix to stop dead
     wizards I have temporarily disabled it. The whole problem of
     killing wizards needs a good going over and rationalization.

 15. Fixed alignment of first set up screen.

 16. Fixed some bugs to do with scoring.

 17. Allegedly changed Texas'em so that when less than six spells
     remain no discard is required. This probably needs some sound to
     stop people clicking on each others spells. Tested OK.

 18. Added variant spider webs, this has pushed the number of spells
     over 255 and some problems might occur.

 19. Fixed the loading/saving problem.

 20. Added some mechanism for a turn counter. There is no warning that
     the game is about to end, also the scores aren't shown at the end.

 21. Replaced About menu.

 22. Added turn counter and discarding flag to the save file.

 23. Fixed a bug relating to the Dao.

 24. Elimited the single pixel blue line from the top of the screen.

 25. Replaced the new game menu.

 26. Completed implementation of the discard spell.

 27. Completed implementation of the quickshot spell (image still
     reversed tho).

 28. Fixed screen clearing when loading a saved game.

 29. Replaced the quit menu.

 30. Only the file menu now relies on reqtools, and will continue to do
     so in the mean time.

 31. Fixed yet another bug to do with discarding.

 32. Fixed a problem relating to the Eartquake and my change to the
     Reinstate function

 33. Made the solar always move on its own accord.

 34. Made the Cat Lord more rigourous. Technically, there should only
     ever be one Cat Lord at a time (ok, there are some ways around
     this, but they will probably be entertaining if they occur, so I'm
     leaving them). The Cat Lord should now move all cats. The latest
     code does prevent multiple Cat Lords from being cast or generated.

 35. Completed implementation of the haunt and solar.

 36. Did some optimisation and tidying up of BoardUpdate.

 37. Implemented computer discarding for Texas trash'em.

 38. Stopped computer wizards from attempting Cat Lord while one on
     screen.

 39. Fixed a problem with dead graphics.

 40. Implemented agent casting of general magic spells.

 41. Completed implementation of Agathion.

 42. Allowed faun to cast sleep.

 43. Allowed azer to cast quench.

 44. Stopped horrors reproducing after the first time.

 45. Completed implementation of Dao.

 46. Agents now highlighted and show owner when casting.

 47. Completed implementation of Jann, Dao, and Marid.

 48. Stopped Justice, Dark Power, and Vengeance on growths.

 49. Allegedly fixed scoring (now tested, it looks ok).

 50. Turned on highlighting for Speed and Slow spells

 51. Turns remaining now displayed on the far right of the screen at
     the top.

 52. Turn counter stuff now works reasonably well. The game will stop
     when all turns are exhausted and the scores will be given.

 53. Problem: Start Chaos and Quit. An Alert pops up (like a guru but
     yellow and non-fatal) that says "Recoverable Error: 0100 0008" I
     looked it up and that means "Damaged Semaphore". NOW FIXED.

 54. Edited descriptions of Marid,Rat.

 55. Fixed up Timing Code.

 56. When simulacrumming an unanimated creature with double in effect
     it is not drawn immediately. In fact it isn't drawn till something
     triggers ReDrawAll=YES. NOW FIXED.

 57. I noticed that Reflector always did exactly 3 points of damage to
     the shooter rather than actually "reflecting" the damage back to
     the shooter.  e.g. A White Dragon shot me and it should have
     "reflected" 9 points of damage back to him but instead only did 3.
     Also, if the wizard had a 15 Ranged Combat Rating then even a
     Camel would get hit with 15 points of retaliatory damage. Also, if
     an Undead Shooter shoots an ordinary Reflectified Wizard then the
     damage does NOT reflect onto the shooter; instead it is an
     "invalid attack, cannot attack undead" So in fact either the spell
     should be renamed to "Retaliation" or "Retaliatory Strike" or the
     Reflector Spell Code should be reworked to actually "reflect" the
     incoming damage. I chose to rework the code so now the exact
     damage is always reflected onto the shooter. Even the exact @{i}type@{ui}
     of damage is reflected: Intelligence damage is reflected as
     Intelligence damage. Ditto for poisoning and all the other stats.

 58. Implemented linearly equidistant ascending order bitplanes. Works
     fine.  >From now on all custom gfx routines can gain an extra 15%
     or more speed due to this fact.

 59. OK NOW AT LONG LAST, COMPUTER TREE-CASTING SHOULD BE ABOUT 3x as
     fast as before!!!!!!

 60. Implemented Split-Screen Technology. Or in the present form it
     might be better referred to as Dual-Screen Technology.

 61. Subversion of a sleeping creature did not clear Sleeping Stat;
     although the owner was correctly changed. Now it does.

 62. When a cloaked creature goes to sleep the cloak image disappears;
     although the creature keeps the cloaked stat. That in itself is
     not a problem; however, once woken the cloak image does not
     return. Ok, I fixed it so a sleeping cloaked creature who is
     awakened will show up graphically as a cloaked creature.

 63. BUG: Closing the FileRequester or selecting CANCEL does not
     actually cancel anything. The game still loads/saves the game. NOW
     FIXED.

 64. PROBLEM: Whenever the game stops the animation system for a
     legitimate reason the sprite also stops. This results in jerky
     sprite animation on all Amigas. On the A500 this is especially
     noticeable since the sprite spends most of its time in slow motion
     and jerking arouind in an icky manner.  SOLUTION: I have
     Implemented the sprite animation as a vertical blank interrupt so
     it will ALWAYS be animated smoothly, regardless of
     ObtainSemaphore() or Forbid(). This makes playing the game on the
     A500 a zillion times better. This should also allow the sprite to
     keep up with moving creatures better.

 65. Implemented new ChaosColorCycler Task which is responsible for all
     color cycling. This allows color cycling to continue unabated even
     when the CHAOSANIM Task is prevented from running by an
     ObtainSemaphore.

 66. Implemented new method for seeing which stats are attacked by
     Combat, Ranged Combat and Special Combat. Just click on Combat and
     the stats that it attacks will begin flashing. The old method was
     just never clear enough for me. Hopefully this new method will
     make things more clear.

 67. Pressing the "r" key now shows the shooting range of the current
     creature by highlighting the cells that can be shot. Looks kewl!

 68. Pressing the "s" key now shows the cells that the current creature
     can shoot into (taking into account any LineOfSight requirements).

 69. Pressing the "m" key now shows the cells that the current creature
     can move into.

 70. FLAW: computer controlled creatures can't shoot quite as far as
     human controlled creatures due to the fact that humans are given
     an extra .5 on their range while computer players are not. I have
     now rewritten the range code such that all shooting ranges are
     calculated identically for humans, computers and the "r" and "s"
     keys. NOW FIXED.

 71. When a creature is about to shoot, its actual .Range stat is
     printed at the bottom of the screen.

 72. PROBLEM: When deciding which spell to cast, the really cool
     auto-mouse-reporting feature that tells you what thing is under
     your mouse pointer is deactivated. I've been wanting to keep this
     active during spell selection forever. Now I finally did it! YAY!

 73. The "r" and "s" and "m" keys now work on whatever cell the
     mousepointer is over at the time of the keypress!!! (Assuming
     there is no creature currently highlighted.) YAHOO! Now we can
     easily inspect the ranges and movement capabilities of any
     creature!!!!

 74. Now if you press SHIFT+r or SHIFT+s or SHIFT+m it displays the
     range info for the creature under the mousepointer @{i}even@{ui} if you
     have already clicked on a creature and that creature is
     highlighted by the sprite. This allows you to go around
     graphically inspecting the ranges of creatures right in the middle
     of moving one of your monsters!! Kewl!

 75. Implemented the new Highlighting method on Creations + Allies with
     numeric keys.

 76. Fixed the bug pertaining to the Dao, Marid etc.

 77. Implemented flying pointer.

 78. Fixed Invert slowness.

 79. Fixed Hide spell showing up on spell lists inappropriately
     (actually caused by Passage having rank 0 and prob 100)

 80. Gave Marid and Dao to more sensible probabilities.

 81. Fixed quickshot imagery

 82. Allowed reincarnation of creature even when mounted.

 83. Added new spells: Abath, Abduction, Acid Rain, Amphisbaena,
     Archery, Betrayal, Thundermare, Iridium Horse, Chaos Lord,
     Devastation, Disection, Hidden Horror, Mana Battery, Meddle,
     Necropotence, Points, Bipedal Generator.

 84. Implemented the secret powerup Horse->Thundermare->Iridium.

 85. There was a bug in UpdateBoard that is not looking after wizard
     stats properly, I discovered this after implementing the ChaosLord
     spell.

 86. Set the Classic flag for all the appropriate spells. Also changed
     the game to start in "classic" mode by default.

 87. Allegedly fixed a problem that was causing the game to hang on
     Quit.

 88. Modified the I/O routines to save the entire probability table
     with a saved game. NOW TESTED, all seems to work.

Improvements from 1.8 to 1.81
-----------------------------

  1. Improved the Docs to be in sync with the new version 1.8 features.

  2. Acquired the OctaMED/RBF software play routines directly from Ray
     Burt-Frost himself. I have no idea if I am actually going to use
     any of it though.

  3. Put my Lame old icon into the distribution.

  4. Fixed off-center WizardExplode.

  5. Changed descriptions of Dark Power, Exorcise, Justice, Vengeance,
     Consecrate, Invert and Brain Boost.

  6. Violet Fungi growth rate STILL WAY TOO HIGH. I have now instituted
     a new growth formula which will hopefully make the growths do what
     we wanted. And I put SPUD_CONSTANT back down to 5 like it used to
     be.

  7. I just came in the room and looked at the screen and I noticed
     something: The graphics seemed much more appealing than they used
     to be. The screen is filled with all sorts of little animated
     critters plus loads of webs and some earthquakes. It just all
     looks enticing and interesting somehow. All the extra movement
     from the faster frame rate makes everything more exciting.

  8. Allegedly fixed the bug where computer wizards cast Raise Dead on
     growths.

  9. Allegedly fixed the problem of Computer Wizards casting Armour on
     creatures with max life.

Improvements from 1.7.5 to 1.8
------------------------------

  1. July 1997: Made a teensy weensy correction to the docs.

  2. Outlined some further ideas on gameplay in English.

  3. Added the following color effects to cell.tex. The FadeTo___Scale
     routines fade the foreground only. The background stays black.
     FadeToGreyScale (Fade the whole screen to a b&w photograph),
     FadeToRedScale, FadeToGreenScale, FadeToBlueScale,
     FadeToCyanScale, FadeToYellowScale, FadeToMagentaScale,
     FadeToColor (Fade the whole screen, including the background, to a
     SOLID color), LowLevelFade (fades to any colorscale).

  4. Added animated sprite to highlight the creature whose turn it is.
     Utilizes 50 fps animation so it really catches your eye. I drew a
     simple little 4-frame animated sprited for this purpose. Hmmm...
     50 fps is actually TOO fast (at least for this particular sprite)
     so I slowed it down to 25 fps.

  5. Successfully linked an asm routine to the C main program and shared
     variables between C and asm. Gee, it only took me 20 hours of
     mortal combat with the Slinker to achieve this... I eventually
     just set data=far for EVERY module to get it to work right. I'll
     fix it to use near data later.

  6. Many small fixes to TeXnotes.

  7. Static and empty cells are NO LONGER REDRAWN by the animator. If
     it isn't animated then the animator doesn't need to draw it. So on
     average this doubles the speed of the animator. In the WORST case
     it will go the same speed as it used to go. In the BEST case it
     goes about 238x faster! On average it should cruise 2x as fast as
     before.

  8. Doubled the speed of the BoardEffect C code.

  9. Retargetable graphics upgrade: Retargetable graphics are needed so
     the game can inherently work with 16x16 or 32x32 or 32x16 or 16x32
     or even 64x64 cells.

 10. I talked to an Amiga guy about his favorite strategy games. (He
     had no idea that I was co-coder of Chaos) He mentioned Chaos as
     one of his favorite strategy games. I asked him lots of questions
     about Chaos like what are its good points and what are its bad
     points and what kind of game is it? And stuff like that. He said a
     lot of interesting things. One of his main complaints was that the
     computer moved to slowly. Well, I had just been waiting for a real
     life gamer to complain about the speed to justify spending some
     time looking over cmove.tex.

 11. I just figured out how to speed up computer movement an additional
     4x but I doubt that I can get it programmed in before the Sunday
     Morning deadline.

 12. All this time my HighlightSprite was messed up and nobody ever
     noticed it.  But when I stared at it I noticed that the right hand
     side was messed up somehow. It turned out that the right side of
     frame 3 was exactly the opposite of how it was supposed to be.
     FIXED.

 13. I rewrote SqDistance in optimized assembly code. It is now 11x as
     fast as before. C version took about 1834 cycles while mine takes
     only about 156 cycles. Cycle times listed are for 68000. I am
     hoping this will translate into making the computer creatures move
     4x as fast because SqDistance is in the inner-innerloop and gets
     executed a LOT.

 14. Collapse magic castles, dark citadels and magic woods as
     appropriate.

 15. I have changed the animator to do only @{i}1@{ui} Obtain/Release Semaphore
     pair per update. This saves 474 jsr/rts combos per frame resulting
     in a significant speed increase in the animator task.

 16. BUG: When you run out of spells in Texas Trash'em the game gets
     stuck. You can't choose a spell or exit the spell-choosing phase.
     You are just stuck.

 17. I just noticed that the animator is still animating at full speed
     even when the spell and creature information panels are being
     displayed. I had noticed a long time ago that the spell info
     screen is filled with text rather slowly on the 7.15909Mhz 68000
     so I have adjusted the information panels to stop the animation
     while they are up. This will speed up the display of text a bit
     plus lighten the multitasking load on the system while the gamer
     reads his spell description. BTW: This is a good example of the
     clipping that the OS DrawImage routine does. It clips the whole
     entire image and draws nothing when a full screen window is up.

 18. Replaced old intro with "something more spectacular".

 19. Quadruple the resolution of the old intro.

 20. Same number of colors as the old intro (since the old one only
     used 8 colors this was not hard 8) I only used 8 colors to
     conserve chipram and hopefully be able to include one of my Chaos
     Theme Songs along with the inro.

 21. Smooth Scrolling.

 22. Colorfading effect.

 23. The text has different colors and shadows each time for variety.

 24. ExtraLarge, easy to read, colorized fonts.

 25. Quadruple-Channel music played with the rather lame, buggy and
     system-unfriendly ptreplay.library.

 26. As far as strategy games go, the new intro-credits-presentation is
     fairly good but it is still quite lame compared to Action Games and
     Action/Strategy Games.

 27. OOPS! I was just about to add background music to the intro so I
     looked at my filesizes: 410k, 550k, 393k, 250k. Hmmm.. The intro
     music may just have to require 1 meg of chipram. Maybe the 250k
     one will fit. The 250k one is the simplest sounding one though. I
     also have a SPECTACULARLY GOOD LOOKING 16color super-well-textured
     ColorFont that we could use in the intro but the font is about
     400k so I'll probably just use it in the "2 Megs of chipram intro".

 28. I have implemented some simple code at the beginning of
     CommenceChaos to determine the currentdir and then Assign
     ChaosGame: to that dir. So now we can load fonts from
     "ChaosGame:fonts/fontname.font" and everything works great! I
     presume that this has also solved the problems of loading my
     ChaosThemeSongs, sound effects and other things.

 29. 2 new asm functions: pal and ntsc. To switch into either video mode
     instantly on any ECS Agnus equiped Amiga. Which means @{i}any@{ui} Amiga
     manufactured in the 1990's plus some of the Amigas from 1989 plus
     anybody who upgraded their old Amigas to an ECS Agnus.

 30. Computer Tree Casting Speedup. NOW, after all that, computer
     treecasting should be noticeably faster on the A500 than before.

 31. Growth Rates are still a bit too high but especially Violet Fungi
     so: I just changed SPUD_CONSTANT from 5 to 6 and FUNGI_RATE from
     30 to 40 in at attempt to keep growths from taking over the world.
     Now I've played some test games with it like this and it seems
     just GREAT! Now it is working the way I envisioned it!

 32. Couldn't see the Ogre Mage or bird lord shot most of the time. I
     think it had just been drawing to fast.

 33. BUG: Bird Lord shot me and it didn't redraw my cell. (I was
     invulnerable at the time, if that makes any difference) Bird Lord
     shot another creature and it was redrawn properly. NOW FIXED.

 34. The 2nd voice sample in ChaosTheme1 just didn't sound right so I
     deleted it and saved 49k. Now my small themesong is only 201k.
     Hopefully that will fit into a 512k chipram intro.

 35. A wizard with lots of creatures and a doube-triple put all 6 of
     his armours on the @{i}same@{ui} creature even though he had other
     creatures that were wounded. He wasted at least half of his
     armours.

 36. Same game later on... Right now there is a DEAD pegasus. It says
     dead and it has the dead image. Yet it has life and people are
     attacking it. ?? It was next to a shadowwood so maybe when a
     ShadowWood kills something this is what happens? This was probably
     caused by a growth and is probably FIXED now.

 37. Fire covered up my wizard who was on a horse but it didn't kill my
     team and it didn't put my creatures to sleep and I could still
     play (but without my wizard). When I click on the cell that I was
     on I can see my powerups just like as if I was in a tree. Next
     turn I killed the fire with my creatures and uncovered my wizard
     and everything was back to normal.

 38. HighlightSprite kept highlighting some tree each time it was
     Matt's turn.  (he was player 3) No big deal, it just looks funny.
     We kept making jokes that he must have a "Magic Owl" in that tree
     or something. FIXED.

 39. Independent Spiderwebs didn't show up at first due to no ReDrawCell
     command. FIXED.

 40. 2 different Computer Wizards cast CLOAK and then aborted the spell
     because they were in a tree and they had no creatures yet.

 41. When a growth no longer covers a dead body the body becomes
     "unalive" FIXED.

 42. Computer wizards aborted Combat, Cloak, Raise Dead.

 43. A Computer-controlled wizard just mounted an independent Nightmare!

 44. 4th from the bottom, 7th from the right, the green ooze is being
     drawn 1 pixel too far down. Cell coords must be off for that cell.
     It is DEFINITELY being redrawn 1 pixel too low. Sometimes the blob
     is drawn off by about 3 pixels.

 45. Blob covered up computer wizard and "killed" him but the game
     didn't end and his powerups show when I click on that blob. This
     might be because the computer wizard in question has LichLord.
     Next Turn: WOW! Now the covered wizard just cast invulnerability
     on himself. He can't attack or move though, apparently. Next Turn:
     Now he just vengeanced my elephant! Next Turn: Now he cast a
     Spectre! And he is still covered up by the green blob.  As far as
     I can tell this is exactly the way it is suposed to work due to
     him having LichLord. I have no complaints. It is just freaky. 8)

 46. Tried to make an autobooting version of Chaos for 1.3. I've done
     this before and it always worked but now it loads then crashes. I
     don't know why but it might be because of that stupid
     ptreplay.library. I went to an awful lot of trouble to avoid using
     OS2.0+ functions so that it would work on all Amigas. Ok, I just
     tested it and it DEFINITELY is the ptreplay.library that is
     causing the crash on the 68000.

 47. Speeded up WeaponEffect

 48. Speeded up ThreeBeam

 49. On a screenfull of creatures I often can't spot the victim of a
     DarkPower/ Justice/ Exorcise/ Vengeance so now the victim is
     HighLighted.

Improvements from 1.7.4 to 1.7.5
--------------------------------

  1. Fixed that annoying empty dead cell bug.

  2. Fixed Tempests so they don't distort space.

  3. Sometimes the Bonus Spell window ONLY displays Hide spells. Once
     this starts it never seems to stop; every bonus spell for the rest
     of the game is displayed as a Hide spell.

  4. New method of showing what stats are attacked by combat.

  5. Optimize the highlight routine.

  6. Purple combat conflicted with pink recovery so I changed Combat to
     BROWN.

  7. Growth rates were incredibly high so I doubled GCEILING to slow
     them down some.

  8. Fixed the DarkWood so they now attack and while I was at it I
     changed their abilities and description a bit.

  9. RMB now cancels info screens properly.

 10. Shortened ScreenShakes.

 11. Fixed Touch of God to set CombatApply Combat and Ranged Combat for
     Life.

 12. Now Info screen shows BrainBoost, MagicShield and Armour powerups.

 13. Team Icon now displayed on Score Screen and TeamScore screen.

 14. Collapsing meditations now give at least 2 spells to pick from.

 15. Team scores are now displayed but they are not sorted correctly.

 16. Pick your bonus spell even if it is only 1. This way you @{i}know@{ui} that
     you got a bonus spell and you know exactly what you got as a bonus
     spell.

 17. The old sound system hogs 2 audio channels. As a quick fix I just
     commented out the code for 1 of the channels so now it only
     uses/hogs 1 channel.

  2. Show allies on number keys. + change the docs.

  3. Allegedly fixed it so a wizard in a castle or tree can attack
     enemies.

  4. Joe made me put in numeric keypad support.

  5. put in new stat in cast.tex called CAST_GROWTH because the
     computer just cast 6 raise deads on 6 different orange jellies.

  6. Things like walls and pits can now be cast ON growths.

Improvements from 1.7.2 to 1.7.3
--------------------------------

  1. Made 2nd info screen to show all stats such as CR_LOS,
     Attacks_Undead, Favorite Food, Afraid of, etc. This is something
     that I've been wanting for a very long time! Now I can see
     EVERYTHING about a creature.

  2. Made 2nd SpellInfo screen with all casting attributes. This is
     something that I have @{i}REALLY@{ui} been wanting for a long time! I am
     always casting a spell and then I find out that I can't cast it
     where I want to so I have to abort it! I have 3 times tried to
     cast armour on a Violet Fungi during an important game and it
     wouldn't let me.

  3. Give the archers actual archery skill. Reduce their range to keep
     the same play balance as before.

  4. Give the archers 1 point of Magic Resistance recovery since their
     description says they have a pure heart and have high magic
     resistance

  5. Removed archery skill from inanimates and growths.

  6. Earthquake movescreen effect: Horziontal_Shake, Vertical_Shake,
     Diagonal_Shake.

  7. Changed Move.tex so that elementals, generators, Stone Giants and
     StoneGolems and EarthQuakes shake the screen when they die.

  8. When an EarthQuake grows, the screen shakes.

  9. Show Powerups like combat, recoverboost and speed on info screen.
     I've been wanting this feature for a long time! I am always having
     3 creatures that look alike EXCEPT for that 1 of them has Combat.
     And then I have to click on each 1 of them and look down at the
     combat stat to find which one it is.  Now the little Combat symbol
     is up there as a powerup so it is easier to spot. Looks cool too.

 10. Eliminated Plastic looking borders on info screens. Now looks more
     slick!

 11. CR_LOS is now more sensibly known as Archery in the program.

 12. Some sort of bug with scrolling credits. After 20 minutes or so
     the machine locks up.

Improvements from 1.7 to 1.7.2
------------------------------

  1. Sleeping Creatures now stop being animated so you can see that
     they are asleep.

  2. Weird bug with simulacrumming a wizard. I was controlling 2
     different wizards who were not in an alliance with each other. I
     had Double in effect. I double simulacrummed the other wizard. I
     simulacrummed the original and then I simulacrummed the copy. I
     hopped one of the wizards on a unicorn and it just disappeared. It
     wasn't there and it couldn't dismount. Ever. The unicorn was still
     there but not the wizard.

  3. Modified the following creatures to take advantage of the new
     combat system: Cobra is now poisonous, Halfling is now @{i}very@{ui} magic
     resistant, Mind Flayer now really attacks intelligence.

  4. Creature Recovery now handles negative recovery rates (Poison),
     though it won't actually kill you yet.

  5. Fixed description of Justice spell.

  6. Numeric keys show player's creatures in RED1 if they have moved
     and in WHITE if they haven't moved.

  7. Fixed Lich spell description.

  8. Pool is now a regular spell. In my opinion it is hard enough to
     use due to Eagles and things that fly up at it and also because it
     adds the "Repair your forces" play mechanic to the game.

Improvements from 1.6 to 1.7
----------------------------

  1. Resurrect and RessurrectID -> MassResurrect

  2. Cloaked creatures now block enemy's LOS but not friendly's LOS.

  3. Fixed life 0. Creatures didn't die when they reached 0 life. Now
     they do.

  4. Fixed Load last name from savefile.

  5. Added lots of new stats in and set them appropriately for each
     creature.

  6. Movement points as float rather than integer.

  7. Modified end-of-turn healing to heal all appropriate stats.

  8. Modified existing combat routine to take into account negative
     combat. We can now make creatures whose attacks heal instead of
     hurt.

  9. Modified existing combat routine to take into account affecting
     different/multiple stats other than life. Now we can make
     creatures that attack any stat or combination of stats. Such as
     intelligence or magic resistance etc.

 10. Added 1 new paragraph to the docs.

 11. Roper, Wasp Nest, Pool, Volcano, Apple Tree are now ordinary items
     which have SpecialCombat.

 12. Modified RangedCombat routine to take into account CR_LOS. Now we
     can make creatures which have distance weapons that don't require
     line of sight.

 13. Added new predicates: AttacksLiving, AttacksUndead, isUndead

 14. Modified maiming routine to not maim on negative combat.

 15. We can now have creatures that gain or lose flying ability.

 16. Lich and Lich Lord and Raise Dead have been modified appropriately.

 17. There was a bug with Magic Sword and Magic Knife: If the wizard
     already had MAX_COMBAT and then cast Magic Sword or Magic Knife
     then he did NOT gain the abiltiy to attack undeads because the
     sword/knife did not get applied.  This is now fixed. The routine
     is now much shorter also.

 18. We can now make creatures which cannot attack living creatures,
     only undeads.

 19. We can now make creatures whose specialcombat affects very
     specific groups of creatures and any combination of stats.

 20. Info Screen graphing is now even better!

 21. ShadowForm, .Shadow, ShadowFormID -> Irvine's_Invulnerability

 22. Heal and HealID -> Restoration.

 23. Info screen has now been revamped to show all the new stats in a
     graphical manner.

Improvements from 1.5 to 1.6
----------------------------

  1. Enhanced Pronuciation of Speech.

  2. Made numerous enhancements to program documentation.

  3. Made numerous enhancements to the User Manual.

  4. Added a new bit to CastInfo[] called CAST_LOS. This bit determines
     if a spell needs Line Of Sight or not. This solves the problem of
     casting creatures diagonally next to a generator or other large
     square object. It also allows the creation of spells that, for
     instance, have a range 3 but DON'T require line of sight. Cool!

  5. Vengeance and Exorcise used to do the @{i}exact@{ui} same thing. So I was
     going to change Exorcise to only be able to be cast on Undeads and
     bump the strength up to 7 to make up for this but there is no
     CAST_UNDEAD or CAST_UNDEAD_ONLY bit so I just raised the strength
     of Exorcise to 4. I just don't see the point in having 2 spells
     which do the exact same thing.

  6. Dark Power and Justice used to do the exact same thing. Now I have
     changed Justice to be 2 sets of 3-point attacks instead of 3 sets
     of 2-point attacks to add some variety. Thus Justice is now a bit
     less useful but Exorcise is a bit more useful so hopefully the
     play-balance is roughly the same as it was.

  7. Magic Bow is now cumulative. Since magic bows are so rare (I've
     never had 2 of them in Chaos 1.5), I have set it to bump up the
     range by 1 on additional bows. That should be a pleasant surprise
     to anyone if they ever have 2 of them!

  8. Destroy Wall now destroys PowerWalls also.

  9. Show numbers beside bar graphs.

 10. I fixed the deal where Independent Undeads never bothered to shoot.

 11. Show LOS required on Spell Info screen.

 12. James "The Optimizer" Strikes Again! Many speed and memory
     optimizations.

 13. 20 new spells!!!.

 14. CAST_UNDEAD_FLAG

 15. Fixed a bug that sometimes causes a crash. (obtain/release
     semaphore)

   We can only work on Chaos in our spare time but are always pleased
to hear suggestions for improvements from people who play the game.

   Here is a list of features that may be added in the future:

   @{b}*@{ub} More spells (send me your favourite ideas, and pictures of wanted
     creatures).

   @{b}*@{ub} Improved sound and sampled speech.

   @{b}*@{ub} More flexibility in game options, such as allowing players to buy
     spells, and so on.

   @{b}*@{ub} Level editor.

Known bugs
==========

   Chaos has been extensively tested with @{b}Enforcer@{ub}, @{b}MuForce@{ub}, @{b}Mungwall@{ub}
and @{b}MuGuardianAngel@{ub} and in our experience does nothing nasty. However,
crashes may happen, if they do it is most helpful to me if you can note
carefully what was happening when the crash occurred.  There are a few
less serious bugs within the game which may be fixed in the future.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Reinstatement Bug@{ui}: When Dark Power, Vengeance, Decree, or
     Justice succeeds in killing a creature upon a corpse, the creature
     is killed but the corpse is brought back to life. This "bug" is
     deliberately incorporated in the program. Advanced players will
     exploit this fact in the obvious way.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Cat Lord@{ui}: Theoretically there should only ever be one Cat Lord.
     However, it possible to create more than one by a variety of
     methods:

       a. using Alter Reality,

       b. using Mutate,

       c. by waking a sleeping one,

       d. by raising a dead one,

       e. using Request.

     Multiple Cat Lords will not cause the game to crash but may result
     in cats changing sides several times, moving multiple times, and
     other undocumented effects. We leave it to you to explore the
     possibilities.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{i}Classic Bugs@{ui}: The classic mode is not perfect and it is
     possible that spells not normally available will occur. Known
     cases are the faun casting sleep. The thundermare and iridium
     powerups are still possible. If generators are used then the
     bipedal generator will still generate creatures not normally
     available in classic mode.

Miscellaneous
-------------

   James Conwell has had the following utilities installed on his
Amigas for years and has used them every day and they work great and he
recommends them to everyone: CPUblit 1.0, Arq 1.78 (Animated
Requesters), FastExec (Loads Exec.library to fastram instead of
chipram; speeds up multitasking and interrupts, etc.) and PoolMem, the
most useful utility ever: It greatly reduces memory fragmentation in
your system, thus increasing speed and reliabilty.

Technical features
==================

   This game was coded in a mixture of JC and Assembly code. We use JC
for the main game and super high speed optimized assembly code for
certain time-critical things like the music and the ray tracing and
certain math operations and certain graphics operations.

   Version 2.3 contains 313 spells. Version 3.0 contains 349 spells.

   If you have an 020 or higher processor then this game features 50 fps
animation in the quadrascopes and quadspectrograms. If you only have a 7
Mhz 68000 then you will only get about 25 fps.

   The sprite that highlights the current creature only runs at 25 fps
no matter how fast your computer is. We did this on purpose because
when it moves faster than 25 fps it becomes unpleasing to the eye.

   If you have an 020 or higher processor then the color cycling on the
QUIT and NEW GAME requesters moves at 50 fps. If you only have a 7 Mhz
68000 then it is only about 25 fps.

   The vector graphic pentagrams on the ABOUT requester rotate at 50
fps on all Amigas.

   The intro music utilizes 4 simultaneous channels of audio, each one
at up to 28,000 samples per second.

   The introductory credits are displayed in 640x512 resolution with 8
colors and smooth full-screen scrolling.

   This game utilizes ray-tracing. When calculating line of sight to a
target a beam of light is traced from the source to the target. If the
beam gets through then you have line of sight. If the beam is blocked
then you do not have line of sight.

   Ray Tracing is an inherently slow process so if you only have a 7
Mhz 68000 you will notice a delay of up to .5 seconds when you push the
"l" key to see all the cells on the board that you have line of sight
to while the computer ray-traces all the possiblities. If this is too
slow for you then please upgrade to a 25 Mhz 030 and then you'll be
happy 8)

   This game was programmed to be 100% OS friendly and Multitasking
friendly, however it will not work on graphics cards because

  1. Most graphics cards are lame and don't have sprites.

  2. This game contains certain high speed routines that write directly
     to your display memory in order to go 10x faster than using slow
     OS calls. This is totally legal and system friendly; it just isn't
     compatible with add-on graphics cards, so if you have a graphics
     card you'll need to play the game on your regular built-in chipset
     instead of the graphics card.

  3. Neither of the authors owns a graphics card.

   This game can be played on Amigas which are equipped with graphics
cards however no benefit will be derived from the presence of a
graphics card. It didn't make sense for us to make graphics that go 10x
slower for regular Amiga owners just so that those with graphics cards
could go a bit faster.  Neither of the programmers of this game own a
graphics card. If you want us to make a new "graphics-card-aware"
version of the game then you'll have to buy us a graphics card to work
with.

   Version 2.3 utilizes a main gameboard resolution of 320x256 pixels
with 32 colors. The text area at the bottom of the main screen is
displayed in 640x256 resolution with 8 colors. The information panels
are also displayed with 640x256 resolution in 8 colors.

   Version 2.3 utilizes Information Panels, Scroll Panels and Score
Screens of 640x512 pixels in 16 colors on both ECS and AGA Amigas. And
a specially designed Calligraphy font is used with anti-aliasing and
anti-flickering to make it appear extremely smooth looking.

   Version 3.0 contains 904 tiles.

   Bill Gates does not profit in any way from the sale or use of this
game.

Abath
=====

   A variation on the unicorn having a somewhat enlarged horn which it

Abduction
=========

   Like subversion, abduction is an attempt to convince an enemy
creature that its interests may better lie with allegiance to your
wizard.  Intelligent creatures are more likely to see through this ruse
than stupid creatures.  However, as abduction applies to a random
creature you cannot know beforehand the intelligence of the recipient.
Further, because the targeting of this spell is so imprecise it is
possible that it will be applied to one of your own creations.
Therefore, the spell is most beneficial when you have relatively few
creations.  Line of sight is not required and your chosen target can be
anywhere on the board.  This spell will not attempt to target
Artifacts, Scrolls, Wizards or corpses.  If successful, the target will
immediately come under control of your wizard and no longer respond to
the commands of its previous lord.

   A large low-flying bird with poor eyesight.  The history of this

Acid Rain
=========

   Causes a global rain storm with droplets of extreme acidity.  The
rain drops are a mixture of water, sulphuric acid, formic acid, nitric
acid, phosphoric acid, carbonic acid, and surprisingly citric acid.
The droplets also contain hydrazine and various other flammable
compounds.  Because of these flammable compounds acid rain will not put
out fires.  Further, acid rain does not harm creatures in general
although during the rain it may be painful to them.  However, trees are
extremely vulnerable to this type of rain.  Even the hardy magic wood
cannot stand acid rain.

Betrayal
========

   Betrayal is an attempt to convince an enemy creature that its

essentially a weak version of subversion, as the convincing is only one
way.  That is, although the creature may be convinced to change sides
there is little chance that it will decide upon your lord as its new
leader.  However, the spell is still useful because it works over a
longer distance than subversion and no wizard likes any adjacent

the number of synaptic connections in the mental faculties of the
chosen target.  The spell is best used to protect a wizard against the

Brain Drain
===========

   This spell will play on the mind of the chosen target.  The spell
induces torment in the brain of the target causing severe synaptic
damage.  For weak minded creatures the spell is usually fatal.  Damage
caused by a brain drain spell may be recoverable by a brain boost
spell.  This spell can be cast on enemy wizards.  This spell inflicts
10 points of damage to the target's intelligence; if this results in a
value less than zero then the target dies of stupidity.

until the conjurer is killed or until it is put out by other means.
Fires can burn any creature, living or undead or dead, or any wizard
not possessing a fire shield.  Fires even burn the creatures of the
conjurer and can even burn the conjurer.  Fires can also burn down
castles, citadels and even walls, although this usually takes
considerable time.  The destructive ability of a fire exceeds that of
any creature including dragons and vampires.  Fire can be put out by
active effort of creatures, each cell of fire has a energy comparable
to that of a faun or troll.

Although the gooey blob has no intelligence it will never harm its
master or any of its maters creatures.  However, the gooey blob quickly
grows over enemy creatures preventing them from moving but not actually
killing them.  Buried creatures can be recovered by killing the gooey
blob on them.  Rescued creatures will have half their initial life
remaining after being uncovered no matter how much they had when they
were buried, so their life on recovery can be more or less than what it
was when they were buried.  If an enemy wizard succumbs to the blob
that wizard dies.

strong, swift, and deadly in combat.  Not only can it attack in similar

affects several statistics of the target simultaneously.  The irdium
horse also freely attacks undeads even though it is not undead itself.
The nightmare pales in comparison to this awesome beast.  Even demons

The spell might or might not succeed.  More intelligent creatures are
less likely to change sides than stupid creatures.  You will never be
able to convince another wizard to join your side or any creature such
a wizard might be riding.  Subversion can be attempted on any creature

Violet Fungi
============

   Once cast a violet fungi no longer responds to commands from its
creator, although it will not harm him in any way.  The violet fungi
releases toxic spores which reduce the stamina of nearby opponents.
Occasionally, a fungi may sprout additional fungi.

Virtue
======

   A vapourous blast of multichromatic light resulting in the death of
many white coloured species.  The caster's own creatures are not
immune.  The following species are immediately vapourized: air
elementals, arctic wolves, bats, derros, eyes, falcons, fauns, fire
bats, gryphons, pegasii, rats, skeletons, stone giants, stone golems,
trolls, and white dragons.

Vitality
========

   A strong encouragement to your creations.  This spells gives them
peace of mind which means that their wounds will heal at a faster rate
than normal.  Its effect is cumulative.

Vodka
=====

   This spell causes bottles of Vodka to appear nearby all the
creatures controlled by the same wizard as your target.  All the
creatures will be very happy about receiving this free gift and will
merrily chug it all down.  The end result is that they will all be
drunk for 2 turns cumulative and their combat ability will be
effectively cut in half.

Volcano
=======

   This spell unleashes powerful tectonic forces resulting in the
creation of a small volcano.  Any creature nearby will become more
agile.  However, the volcano is inherently unstable and can explode
without warning.

Vulture
=======

   The vulture is easily cast and unlike most creatures can be cast up
to 2 squares away from the wizard, provided there is line of sight.
The vulture easily escapes from conflict and has good range.  It also
has excellent eyesight and an even better sense of smell.  Vultures are
scavengers.

Wake
====

   The wake spell is used to reverse the effect of the sleep spell or
to wake creatures which went to sleep when a wizard died.  Once woken a
creature will be under the allegiance of the wizard who cast the wake
spell, irrespective of how the creature was put to sleep.  Quickly make
use of this spell when the chance arises as sleeping creatures tend to
decay.

Wasp Nest
=========

   A wasp nest is pretty self-explanatory, any enemy creature
approaching a wasp nest will be automatically attacked.  Once you cast
a wasp nest you can forget about it, since you cannot move it and it
attacks automatically.  It will attack all adjacent squares
simultaneously.  The wasps are friendly towards the creations of its
owner.

Weak Wall
=========

   Despite its name, the weak wall is a formidable obstacle for an
opponent to overcome.  It is extremely useful for slowing the passage
of fire, or blocking the growth of gooey blob.  The name only implies
that this wall is weaker than standard wall or strong wall.  Most
magical attacks will eliminate a weak wall.  The wall can also be
destroyed by combat but this will usually take several rounds.  For
each weak wall spell 6 pieces of wall may be cast anywhere in the world.

Web
===

   This spell allows the wizard to magically create 6 pieces of spider
web.  Such web is useful for blocking weak opponents, but will not stop
a determined opponent.

White Dragon
============

   White dragons normally dwell only in cold regions.  Meditation may
allow a wizard to call upon a white dragon.  The white dragon is very
strong but slower than other dragons due to its lower metabolic rate.
The white dragon can freeze other species to death with a breath weapon
which is more effective than the breath weapons of the red and green
dragons.

   The wight is an evil undead and falls into the middle of the undeads
in terms of overall ability.  They can be beaten by wraiths, ghosts and
vampires but can deal to skeletons and zombies.

real wizard.  The spell is only available by meditation, although
generators  will produce fake wizards frequently.

Wizard Wings
============

   Wizard wings gives your wizard the ability to fly and will set his
movement to 6.  The spell will only work on your wizard.  Provided the
wizard is not engaged or dismounting, flight with the range of an eagle
will be possible.  Wizard Wings are particularly useful for hopping
between magic wood trees.

Wolverine
=========

   A ferocious mutant wolf that loves killing and is very good at it.
Wolverines normally shun wizards and can only be obtained through
meditation.  Apart from its superior fighting ability the wolverine is
much the same as the dire wolf.  They loathe dire wolves which they
consider as unwanted competition for food.

Wood Elf
========

   Like all elves the wood elf has a pure heart giving them a high
magical resistance (particularly from the darker kinds of magic).  Wood
elves are physically weak and should best avoid direct combat.  Wood
elves are highly skilled with a bow.  Every wood elf comes complete
with an ash bow and a full quiver of arrows.  The ability of the wood
elf is slightly exceeded by their rarer cousin the gray elf.

Wraith
======

   The wraith is closely related to the wight but is superior in
several respects.  Wraiths have exceptional intelligence and excellent
magical resistance.  The wraith can outrun most lesser undeads but
rarely has the need to, since the wraith is a proficient killer.

X-Ray
=====

   This spell blasts an object with a high dosage of X-rays.  Weak
creatures may die instantly, as this spell will lower their magical
resistance by 2 points and transfer the excess damage to their life
force at a 10:1 ratio.  For example a creature with magical resistance
of 1 and life of 15 will be reduced to a magical resistance of 0 and
life force of 5.  This spell requires line of sight and can be used on
inanimate objects.

Zombie
======

   The zombie is a magically animated corpse and is only slightly more
sophisticated than a skeleton.  Like the skeleton, the zombie is very
effective at blocking the progress of land-ridden living creatures.
Other undeads, however, can quickly dispose of the zombie.
