Introduction:
-------------
This is a preview demo of our e-mailware version of Stratego.  It currently
allows for a complete two player game, is completely system friendly, and has
proven to be 100% crash / enforcer free on all tested machines.

It currently does not contain the following:

- 1 Player Games (the AI is complicated!)
- TCP is disabled (A new generic game protocol is under development)

The rest of the game is fully functional!

-----------------
Planned Road Map:
-----------------
As of now, a TCP enabled version is planned for the "near" future.  This is
just a matter of George finding sometime to work with that hasn't been
dedicated to a myraid of other things (mainly support code for Explorer 2260
and Maim & Mangle).

AI - this is a big one, on the scale of chess algorithms for its complexity.
Currently, we are planning on completing this *after* the release of Explorer
2260 and Maim & Mangle.  So it will be a while before you can bash away at you
Amiga.  For now I'm afraid it will have to be unwilling family members / friends
/ household pets, and soon friends / enemies over the Internet.

----------------
Stratego "Sets":
----------------
Stratego was written (actually some was rewritten...) in a fashion to allow
replaceable graphics and sound samples.  It was our intention that end users
could crank out new and interesting graphics and sample sets.

We would be very interested in hosting some of the better sets on our site,
together with a link to the authors website.  It would be especially nice if
some people could provide us with sample sets.

A Note on Sample Sets:
----------------------
The current batch of Sound Samples is quite a hasty job.  A friend of ours has
promised samples for a while, but they are not finished yet.  To fill the gap,
we cobbled together some samples to the best of our ability.

For those of you who may be interested in a Stratego sample set, I (George)
would especially love a Stratego set (both samples and graphics?) from the BBC
series "Bottom".  A good episode to start with would be "Culture".

A Note on Graphics Sets:
------------------------
Some very special dimensions and palette constraints have to be considered.
If you are interested in doing a graphics set, please e-mail George for further
information.

------------
Suggestions:
------------
All suggestions are welcome.  One thing we are not interested in however, are
modifications to the rules of Stratego.  We prefer the authentic game of
Stratego, and we hope you do as well.

Anything else is fair game.  Do you feel we have done something in a completely
stupid fashion?  Hey - feel free to let us know, we have big shoulders.  The
contact address is deimos@fundy.net.

-------------
Localisation:
-------------
The local file is ready for prospective translators.  In order to minimise what
has become a gargantuan archive, we opted to leave the local files out.  If you
wish to translate Stratego into your native language, please contact us at
deimos@fundy.net.

A list of translators and catalogs will be added to our website as they are
finalised.

-----------------
Trouble Shooting:
-----------------
The manual (both the AmigaGuide and HTML versions) describe the actual rules to
the game, and how to use this version of the game.  If you have troubles
or problems, please, please, *please* read the manual first.  If you still have
problems or something is unclear, then feel free to contact us.

No, we are not mean bastards (not overly so anyway), but we do have a large
amount of e-mail everyday, and answering the same questions several times will
only take time away from Maim & Mangle ;).  Perhaps the game may warrant a FAQ
in the future.  If that is the case we will be interested in hearing from
people who may be interested in maintaining such a beast.

-----
Bugs:
-----
As of now, there are no known bugs.  That does not mean that no bugs are
present, far from it!  If you find a bug, please fill out the online error
report at http://user.fundy.net/deimos/bugs.htm.
