There are many ways to set up a good defence: usually you will place Bombs around the Flag to protect it, however, Bombs are quite valuable and you only have six of them. So, by placing the Flag in a corner you will only need two Bombs to protect it, and you will still have four left to randomly cause havoc :-). You might even set the Bombs in the front row so that many of the first opponent's pieces are eliminated quickly (be careful not to cover all six squares beside the 2x2 squares with Bombs or you will not be able to move, and you will lose the game before it even begins! ;-)
<P>
You may wish to distribute your men so that you have some high-ranking pieces in the front lines as well as around your Flag (be careful though, because you do not want to lose all your highest ranking pieces in the beginning, or you will have nothing left to defend your Flag!). Also, place your Miners/8 behind the front line and in the back rows, so that when your front line finds a Bomb you can then send the Miners/8 to disarm them. Distribute the Scouts/8 near the front line to determine your opponents strength and setup early in the game and to find Bombs for your Miners/8 to defuse.
