<P>
Stratego is a completely multi-tasking game which requires very little CPU time! The game can be run in either 16 (ECS/OCS) <U>OR</U> 256 colors (AGA/RTG).  Stratego's screen is 640x400 and may be run on its own screen <U>OR</U> in a window on the default public screen!
Should the screen not appear, or in the event of an error, make sure your machine fulfills the <A HREF="require.htm">minimum requirements</A>.
<P>
The screen consists of the game board, the display panel, some pull-down <A HREF="menus.htm">menus</A>, and two buttons (Begin/End Turn and Replay Last). The display panel is where all game requesters are displayed. The game board is a 10x10 playfield with two 2x2 areas upon which the game pieces are not allowed to be placed or moved. The two buttons near the bottom right of the screen are:
<P>
<B>Begin/End Turn:</B> Fairly self-explanatory - push this button to begin each turn including the initial game setup. The button will then read <B>End Turn</B>, which you push to end your turn. You may also use the RETURN key to Begin and End your turn. See <A HREF="hotkeys.htm">HotKeys</A>.
<P>
<B>Replay Last:</B> In two player mode on a single machine, each player must look away while the other player executes his/her move so as not to see the other's setup; therefore you may replay your opponent's last move to see what occurred. This option does not reveal your opponents setup, just which piece was moved and where it was moved to.
