<P>
Stratego is a completely multi-tasking game which requires very little CPU time! The game can be run in either 16 (ECS/OCS) <U>OR</U> 256 colors (AGA/RTG).  Stratego's screen is 640x400 and may be run on its own screen <U>OR</U> in a window on the default public screen! See <A HREF="require.htm">Requirements</A>.
<P>
The game board is your battlefield; you have an army of 33 men, and 6 bombs which you must use to capture your enemy's flag while protecting your own. Both you and your adversary will secretly layout your respective pieces to build a good defence as well as an incisive attacking strategy. Once both you and your opponent have your armies in place, it is time to advance and conquer in an attempt to capture the enemy flag!
