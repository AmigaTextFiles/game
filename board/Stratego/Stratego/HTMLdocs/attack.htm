<P>
When you attack your opponent, the computer will reveal the identity of the defending piece, and both the attacker's square and the defender's square will be highlighted. The computer then waits for you to end your turn, upon which the piece with the highest rank (lowest number) will remain, and the piece with the lower rank (higher number) is removed from the playing board. If the defending piece is of the same rank (same number) as the attacking piece, then both pieces are removed from the board (unless <A HREF="menus.htm#Aggressor">Aggressor Advantage</A> is enabled).
<P>
Normally, when a piece attacks a Bomb, the piece is removed from the board, regardless of rank (ie. it is blown up ;-), however, the Miner/8 has the ability to &quot;disarm&quot; Bombs. Therefore when a Miner/8 attacks a Bomb, the Bomb is removed from the board, and the Miner/8 then occupies the square where the Bomb used to be.
<P>
Although the highest ranking piece is the Marshal/1, he may be removed from  game play if he: attacks a Bomb; attacks, or is attacked by the opponent's Marshal/1; or, is attacked by a Spy/S. The Spy/S has the lowest rank and is always the removed from the board when it is attacked. However, it's unique ability to outrank the Marshal/1 <I>if it is the aggressor</I> makes it very valuable.
