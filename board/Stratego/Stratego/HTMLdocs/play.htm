<P>
After both players have set up their respective sides of the board, the pieces screen in the display panel becomes a record of pieces lost (i.e. 3/4 would now indicate that you have lost three out of four pieces, and that there is one remaining on the board).
<P>
To make a move, left click on the desired piece (except for the Flag and Bombs which remain stationary) and then select an adjacent square (either forward, backward, left or right of the piece's current position - diagonals are not allowed). With the exception of the Scout/9, all movable pieces can only move one square per turn. The Scout/9, however, can move anywhere along a row or column as long as you do not jump over another piece. Remember though, if you <I><B>do</B></I> move a Scout/9 more than one square, your opponent will know the piece's identity. So, sometimes you may wish to move the scout just like any other piece (ie. one square at a time) to trick your opponent into thinking the piece is of a higher rank. Pieces may not move diagonally, jump another piece, or move between the same two squares for more than three consecutive turns. Again, the computer will prevent you from making an illegal move - if you find that the piece will not go where you want, or that you can not end your turn, it is because you have not performed a legal move. Note that you may not move onto the two 2x2 squares in the center of the board.
<P>
If the square which you select as your destination contains an opponents piece, then you will be <A HREF="attack.htm">Attacking</A> that piece.
<P>
The first player to attack the opponents Flag is the winner. You may also win if your opponent no longer has any movable pieces on the board, or if s/he cannot move them (ie. they are surrounded by Bombs).
