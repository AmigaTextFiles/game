<P>
If you play this game more than once, you are <B>required</B> (please) to email either <A HREF="mailto:deimos@fundy.net">George</A> or <A HREF="mailto:trevor@jot.nb.ca">myself</A> (or both if you like). The main reason for this request is that we want to get an idea of how popular (if at all) the game is, and so we can keep a record of which machines and configurations the game works on. We will also notify &quot;registered&quot; users when new versions become available. Mailing us also provides you with the opportunity to express your likes and dislikes with the game, make suggestions as to how to improve it, and report any bugs.
<P>
Currently the game has been tested on the following configurations: <A HREF="george.htm">George's system</A> and <A HREF="trevor.htm">Trevor's system</A>.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#FF8080">NOTE:</FONT> Magazine publishers are NOT required to contact <A HREF="mailto:deimos@fundy.net">us</A> before including this game on coverdisks (if you choose to do so) provided we are accredited for our work.
