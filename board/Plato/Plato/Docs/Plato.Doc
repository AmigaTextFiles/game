1.1 What is Plato?

    Plato is a game of strategybased on Othello.  It uses an eight by eight
board using double sided counters (black and white).  It is easy to learn but
takes time to master.  I find it enjoyable.

1.2 Why did I do Plato?

    I have owned my Amiga for nearly one year, and during this time I have
never found a version of Plato on this machine that plays reasonably well
and runs on the Workbench screen.  I personally find it annoying when a
simplistic strategy game is given a screen of its own when it is obviously
not needed.  The program I have written, as far as I know, is perfectly
system legal and has no programming bugs (I say nothing about the computers
gameplay).  If anybody using this program finds any bugs or can suggest
ways of improving the computer gameplay, I would be very glad to here from
you so I can correct the bug or improve the computer.

2.1 The rules.

 1)  Black always takes the first turn.
 2)  On every move a disc must be placed next to an opponent's disc, either
sideways, lengthways or diagonally. The disc placed must trap an opponent's
disc (or discs) between the one placed and one already on board in any
direction.
 3)  The number of discs that can be captured in a turn in any or multiple
directions is unlimited.
 4)  If it is impossible to capture one of your opponent's discs when it is
your move, you miss that turn and cannot move again until you can lay a
disk that captures at least one of your opponents discs. Until you can lay
such a disc your opponent continues to play, turning over as many of your
discs as possible. (The program will tell you to pass if this is the case.)
 5)  Play continues as above until - The board is filled.
				   - One player has no pieces of his colour
				     left on the board.
				   - No further moves are possible for
				     either player.
 6)  When this occurs the discs are counted and the player with the most
wins.

2.2 Hints and tips.

 1)  Corner discs are very useful because once you have one it can never be
taken away from you by the other player.  As well as this it is a permanent
end to three lines.  Therefore there is a large advantage in the corner
pieces.
 2)  Edge pieces are also reasonably safe because they can only be captured
from either side of the disc while they are an end for five lines.
 3)  While the move that captures the most discs may seem the best,
sometimes less dramatic moves can be to more of an advantage.
 4)  Solid blocks of colour, especially backed by a corner, is often a key
to winning the game.
 5)  There is a slight advantage to going first.  So if there are two human
players, the more experienced player may give this advantage to the other
one.  After one game the winner may wish to let the loser go first on the
next game.
