AmiChess is a new chess program for the Amiga.
The chess engine is based on the latest GNUChess version.
Due to the GNU license, the archive contains the full source code.

What the program can do:
* Read/Write of chess files in PGN and EPD-format.
* You can play against the computer, let the computer play against
  itself or use the program as supervisor.
* Usage and creation of an opening book. Several levels available
  for book usage.
* Chess strength variable by settings of time (move per time) or
  search depth.
* Undo and remove function.
* Let the computer show its best variation when thinking.
* Change the board design "on the fly".
* Choose between a dozens skins, boards and resolutions for most common screens.
* Solve chess problems (with restrictions).
* Localization, currently in English and German.

Things that are missing or restricted.
* No pondering (thinking while human thinks).


How to install the opening book:
The opening book is not included in this archive, because it is
about 10 MB of size! If you like to install an opening book,
simply follow these steps:
* Download ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/chess/book_1.00.pgn.gz
* Unpack the file with gzip, UnArc or any other unpacker
  that can handle gzip-packed files.
* Start AmiChess. Select "Menu/Game/Book/Add ..." and select
  the unpacked book file.
* Wait for about 30 mins to 2 hrs for compilation to finish.
  Ignore any error messages while compiling the book.
* After successful compilation you should find the file "book.dat"
  in your program folder.


Developer information:
* Binary requires at least an 68020 CPU (68k)
  or PPC603/040 (WarpOS)
* The program has been compiled with StormC V4 in GCC mode.

Some notes:
* I am not able to include pondering in AmiChess, as I am not familar
  with the chess engine. If you have any idea on how to improve the
  program, simply let me know.
* When saving a game (PGN) or a position (EPD), the program will add
  the current game to your selected file, if the file already exists.
  Unfortunately, the program will load only the first game in a file that
  contains several games. If you like to continue a game, it is recommended
  to save the game in a new file or delete the old game before!
  I hope to change this behaviour in future releases.
* Hint function is sometimes crashing the program. I don't know why.
  Best you don't use it. Use "Show thinking" instead for computer variation.
* Program requires a Workbench resolution of at least 800x600.
* You MUST NOT use sound.datatype V41 from Stephan Rupprecht. This
  datatype can cause lock-ups when playing sound samples!
