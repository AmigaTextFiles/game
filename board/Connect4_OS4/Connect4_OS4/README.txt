PLAYING
=-=-=-=
  The game is played as one player against the might / skill of the computer.
  Change the computer skill level by checking the checkbox next to the skill
  level you want to play against.
  To start a new game click new game top right. Players take it in turns to 
  start first, no matter who wins.
  To undo a move you didn't want to play click the undo button top right,
  you can undo as many moves as you like. Undo doesn't work if the game 
  has finished. That would make it a bit too easy.
  
  Players take it in turn to go, there's a note at the bottom of the screen
  for whose go it is. A dot is displayed under the column which was last played.
  To place a counter click in the column you want to play, if the column is
  full a note is displayed.
  If you are a bit stuck then click Hint top right which will display a circle under
  the column the computer would play.
  
  The stats are stored for the playing session showing how many games you've
  won, lost or drawn
  
  Happy playing

  Thanks!
