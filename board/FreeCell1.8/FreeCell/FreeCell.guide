@NODE   "INTRO"         "Overview"

FreeCell is a logic puzzle in the form of a solitaire card game.  It is unlike
most solitaire games, however, in that there is no luck involved after the
initial shuffle.  There are no hidden cards; they are all dealt face up at the
start of the game.

FreeCell has an extremely high rate of 'solvability'.  It approaches something
like 99.9%.  There is a FAQ on the web somewhere that gives more information on
this, however, this is based on the PC version of FreeCell.  So, there are some
games that are not solvable.  If any are found on this version, please let me
know.

As of version 1.5, a new set of rules has been added, "Baker's Rules".  This is
almost the same as the original, except that you can only play, for example, the
three of diamonds onto the four of diamonds.  Everything else is the same.  This
makes the game somewhat harder.  I've been told that solvability is now roughly
70%.

If you have any comments, bug reports or suggestions, please e-mail me on

@NODE   "GAMEPLAY"      "Playing the Game"

FreeCell is similar to other solitaire games you may have played.  You play red
cards on black cards and black cards on red cards (for Baker's Rules, its the
same suit).  The object of the game is to move all the cards to the @{"Home Cells" LINK BOARD},
piling up cards of the same suit starting with the ace.

@{b}Starting Up:@{ub}
    FreeCell has one tool type which is originally configured to allow multiple
    @{"statistics files" LINK STATFILES}.  If you are ever only going to use one stats file, you can
    switch this off and save yourself a file requester.  Bring up icon info -
    Right-Amiga I, and set the tool type 'MULTIPLESTATS' to 'NO'.  If you're
    happy with multiple stats files (more than one person plays this game on
    your computer, or you want separate stats files for whatever reason), leave
    it as it is.

    To only use one stats file from the CLI, just enter any parameter, eg.

        FreeCell anycharacter

    If you type 'FreeCell' by itself, you will get the stats file requester.

    Once you start the game, you will get a file requester where you can select
    the stats file you wish or create a new one.  See the above link for more
    information.

    The FreeCell screen will then be displayed.

@{b}To Start a New Game:@{ub}
    From the Game Menu, choose New Game, or press F2, or click on the first
    button on the dock window.  A new game will be chosen for you at random.
    The cards will be shuffled and then dealt onto the main screen.

@{b}To Select a Specific Game:@{ub}
    From the Game menu, choose Select Game, or press F3, or click on the second
    button on the dock window.  A requester will be displayed where you can
    enter the game number of the specific game you want to play.

    The game number refers to a unique shuffle and deal of the cards.  There
    are 999,999,999 different Game Numbers available in FreeCell.  I can't
    guarantee that they're all different, however.

@{b}To Play a Set Game:@{ub}
    From the Game menu, choose Play Set Game.  This will bring up a file
    requester (pattern match 'setgame.#?').  The file you select consists of a
    deck of cards arrayed in any order you choose.  You can then play out this
    game.  Go @{"here" LINK GAMEMENU} for more information.

@{b}To Move a Card:@{ub}
    Click the card you want to move.  It will be highlighted.  Then click the
    area to which you want to move the card.  The card will move to that area
    (provided it is a legal move).  To cancel a move, click again on the
    selected card.

@{b}To Reveal a Partially Hidden Card:@{ub}
    Click the card with the right mouse button.

@{b}To Move a Stack of Cards:@{ub}
    You can move an ordered stack of cards from one column to another if there
    are enough free cells open.  To move a stack, click any card in the stack;
    then click the column that you want to move the stack to.  Provided that
    there are enough free cells available, the cards will move.

@{b}To Quickly Move a Card to a Free Cell:@{ub}
    Double-click the card you want to move to a free cell (must be a free cell,
    of course).  This option can be turned off via the @{"Options menu" LINK OPTIONSMENU}.

@{b}To Undo the Last Move:@{ub}
    Use the menu item from the help menu, or use the last button on the dock
    window.
@ENDNODE


@NODE	"RULES"			"Rules of the Game"

This section describes the rules of FreeCell.

@{b}Area and Objective:@{ub}
    The FreeCell game area consists of the @{"home cells" LINK BOARD}, @{"free cells" LINK BOARD},
    and the deck of cards, which is dealt face-up at the beginning of the game.

    The object of the game is to move all the cards to the home cells, using
    the free cells as placeholders.  To win, you must make four stacks of cards
    on the home cells:  one for each suit, with the ace on the bottom and each
    card stacked in order of rank.

@{b}Legal Moves:@{ub}
    There are four legal moves in FreeCell:

    1.	You can move any card from the bottom of a column to an empty @{"free cell" LINK BOARD}.

    2.	You can move any card from a free cell or from the bottom of a column
        to a @{"home cell" LINK BOARD} if that card is one greater in rank than the card
        in the home cell, and of the same suit.  For example, you can move a
        four of clubs on to a three of clubs in a home cell.  Aces can always
        be moved to an empty home cell.

    @{b}NOTE:@{ub} At the end of each move, FreeCell will transfer unneeded cards to the
        home cells.  A card is unneeded if there are no lower-rank cards of the
        opposite colour left in the playing area.

    3.	You can move a card from a free cell or from the bottom of another
        column as long as the rank of the card is one less than the rank of the
        card you will place it on, and the colours of the cards are different.
        For example, you can move a black three onto a red four.  Any card can
        be moved to an empty column.

    @{b}NOTE:@{ub} If you are playing "Baker's Rules", this move is slightly different.
        The suit has to be the same.  For example, the three of hearts can only be
        played onto a four of hearts.

    4.	You can move an ordered stack of cards from one column to another column
        if the rank of the top card in that stack obeys rule three, and there
        are enough free cells to accomplish it.

        If you move the stack to an empty column, a requester will appear asking
        whether you want to move a single card, column of cards, or neither.
        Click on the appropriate button.

@{b}Winning:@{ub}
    You win when you have moved all the cards from the columns to the home cells.

    You are able to save the solution to the game just completed if you wish.
    Click the 'Save solution' button.  This creates a text file called:

        Solution.game#########_Rn

    (where 'R' is the rules version, either 'O' for original, or 'B' for Baker's
    rules, and 'n' is for the number of FreeCells if not 4)

    in a directory called Solutions.  Note that this directory must exist first.
    The file is made up of two character pairs separated by a space, ten to a line.
    With this you can follow the solution that someone else made when they went
    through a game that you're having trouble with.

    The first character of each pair is the 'from' column, and the second is the
    'to' column(!).  The main columns are represented by the numbers from '1' to
    '8', the free cells by 'a' to 'd', and the home cells by 'h' to 'k' (for any
    that you move yourself).  If a column move is done to an empty column (and
    the column move requester comes up), this is represented by the number of
    cards moved placed between parentheses, ie. 35(3) - three cards moved from
    column 3 to empty column 5.

@{b}Losing:@{ub}
    You lose if there are no more legal moves.  When you lose a game, you can
    try the same Game Number again without further affecting the statistics.  To
    do this, choose Restart Game from the Game Menu or click the Same Game check-
    box on the end-of-game requester and click Yes.

    A counter is displayed on the title bar of how many attempts you have made on
    the current game.

@NODE   "STRATEGIES"        "Strategies and Hints"

This section contains helpful hints for playing FreeCell successfully.

Winning at FreeCell requires patience.  A common mistake is to make a move just
because it is possible, and then to realize that it cuts off another move.

*   Spend the first few games becoming familiar with all the moves.  Be sure you
    understand how moving a stack of cards works, and what the limitations are.

*   Study the deck carefully before you make your first move.  Look for trouble
    spots like aces hidden at the tops of columns, or both red sevens stacked
    behind three kings.

*   Use your @{"free cells" LINK BOARD} carefully.  There are only a maximum of four.  This
    number can be modified from 0 to 4 via the @{"Options menu" LINK OPTIONSMENU}.  Try to keep them
    unoccupied as much as possible.  If they are full, and you can't move them
    elsewhere, you will be severely restricted in what you can do.

*   When you are first learning FreeCell, it may be helpful to get messages that
    tell you when you have made an invalid move.  To get messages, choose
    Messages from the @{"Options menu" LINK OPTIONSMENU}.

*   Look for a column that will be easy to clear (cards that can be moved to
    other columns, some Aces...).  Once it's clear, try to put the highest card
    at the top of the column (preferably a King) and build on it.


A Few Strategy Tips for Baker's Game (by David Antczak).

As you experiment with Baker's Game, you will find that the small change in the
rules necessitates a somewhat different approach in the search for a solution.
Free Cell is usually a pleasant diversion, with almost 100% of the deals being
solvable, and the timing of moves and placement of cards is rarely critical.
Mathematicians estimate that Baker's Game, on the other hand, is only solvable
70% of the time, and you may soon get the feeling that the missing 30% are the
easy deals!  With that in mind, here are a few pointers to get you started on the
road to more thoughtful and successful play of this very fine game.  I will refer
to the three areas of movement by the somewhat standard terms of "tableau", where
the cards are first dealt into columns, "cells", where the cards can be
temporarily stored, and "foundation", the goal area.  Also, the term "empty
column" means any area in the tableau where cards were dealt but where none are
at the present time.

If you are a longtime player of Free Cell, you will first need to re-orient your
thinking a bit so that you are looking for the proper cards to play upon!

When the cards are first dealt, resist the temptation to dive right in and start
moving them around!  Take a few minutes to take stock of the situation and begin
to formulate a plan.  If any cards can be immediately moved onto the foundation
without disturbing other cards, go ahead and move them -- there will be no
better place for them and it simplifies the tableau to have them out of the way.
After that, continue to scan the tableau looking for three main things: the
location of all aces, deuces, and treys, the location of all kings, and columns
that are possible candidates for clearing.

Finding the A-2-3 of each suit often gives some immediate ideas for a plan of
attack on the whole deal.  It isn't necessary to memorize the location of each,
but find them and see what problems they pose.  Are they dealt near the top of the
column?  Are higher cards of the same suit below them in the column?  "Well begun
is half done" holds very true in Baker's Game, and moving these cards to the
foundation will substantially reduce the crowding in the tableau.

The kings have to be located and kept in mind for one small but often important
reason.  When other cards are played into the cells, they can be returned to the
tableau either by placement on the next higher card or by playing to an empty
column.  Kings, however, having no higher card, can only return to the tableau
in an empty column.  This means, of course, that kings often block the cells
longer.  Always have this in mind when you move a king up to the cells.

Clearing a column is almost always a good idea, if you can do so and not lose too
much mobility.  Empty columns can be filled with the cards of your choice, a
sequence of cards that is ready to fly to the foundation as soon as they are
released.  Look for columns that have a lot of low cards, or a sequence of one
suit that can be untangled, or a lot of cards that can be scattered around the
tableau without tying up the cells.  Once a column is clear, try to pick a suit
and a card from that suit that will let you move a lot of cards into that column.
Keep in mind, however, that it may be more important to move only a few cards if
those cards in turn free up other critical cards.

There is a rough pattern to this game that often works in practice as the
skeleton of a plan -- cards are scattered in the tableau and the cells, a column
is cleared, cards are consolidated in that column and the cells are cleared, and
then cards are scattered in the cells and tableau again.

There is one critical difference in play between Baker's Game and Free Cell.  In
the latter, if you have a six-card sequence in the tableau, say 9-8-7-6-5-4, you
can move this in two stages if you have even two cells open by moving the 6-5-4
onto the "other" 7, moving the 9-8-7, then moving the 6-5-4 back to the original
7.  But Baker's Game has no "other" 7!  Therefore, sequences of six cards or more
can never be moved in the tableau, even if all four cells are open.  Be very wary
of building long sequences with any cards above them, and be especially wary of
building any sequences with lower cards in the same suit above them in the same
column.

There is one more tip on play I would pass on -- don't be too quick to surrender
on any deal unless you can actually demonstrate that it can't be solved.  Use the
undo feature and keep working at stubborn deals, even if you have to undo all the
way back to the start.  This game is much more like a puzzle than mental chewing
gum, and some of the deals are tough nuts to crack.  There is enormous
satisfaction in solving one of the tough deals after working on it for hours or
days or even weeks!

Happy Solving!

@NODE	"GAMEMENU"	"Game Menu Commands"

This section contains information about Game memu commands in FreeCell.

@{b}New Game:@{ub}
    Deals a new game of FreeCell.  Picks the game number at random.

@{b}Select Game:@{ub}
    Lets you pick a specific game of FreeCell and deals it.

@{b}Restart Game:@{ub}
    Redeals the current game of FreeCell.  It will ask you if you want to resign
    this game - but only if it's not a 'setgame'.  This option is also available
    from the dock window (third button).

@{b}Play Set Game:@{ub}
    Lets you arrange the deck as you want.  Create a text file that starts with
    'setgame.' and enter the cards as they will be dealt - from left to right,
    bottom to top.  An example file is included in the archive.  The game
    (PC11982) happens to be impossible to solve.

    Each card is defined by two characters as follows:  The first character of
    each card is the rank, ie. Ace is 'A', 2 to 9 as 2 to 9, ten as 'T', Jack
    as 'J', Queen as 'Q', King as 'K'.  Each suit is represented by it's first
    character.  For example, the 5 of hearts is '5H' and King of Spades is 'KS'.

    Once the file is created, select this menu option and a file requester will
    allow you to select a game to play!  Note that this game will not affect the
    statistics.

@{b}Browse Solution:@{ub}
    This is where you can load the solution to a game and play through the
    solution.  It doesn't allow you to continue playing the game your own way.
    It's mainly for educational or fun purposes.

    Note that the number of FreeCells is also saved with the solution (if not
    four).  This is so you can see how the original solver solved it with less
    than four FreeCells.  If the game was solved using Baker's Rules (from v1.5),
    this is also saved with the game.

    A file requester allows you to choose any game solution.  The game is then
    loaded and dealt.  A video control unit is displayed which has four buttons:

    - Rewind:        Restarts the current game so you can watch it again.

    - Undo:          Undoes the previous move - possible all the way to the start
                     of the game.

    - Stop:          Stops the fast forward.

    - Play:          Plays one move of the solution (includes any AutoMove).

    - Fast Forward:  Plays the solution continually (until the game ends).  There
                     are three speeds from slow to normal speed.

    There are also keyboard 'shortcuts':

    - Rewind:        Shift-left arrow.
    - Undo:          Left arrow.
    - Stop:          Up or down arrow.
    - Play:          Right arrow.
    - Fast Forward:  Shift-right arrow.

@{b}Rules:@{ub}
    There are two options: Original or Baker's.  Original is how it is described
    in these rules.  Baker's is slightly different in that you can only play a
    card onto another card if it is the same suit (not the other colour) and one
    less in rank (as for the Original).

    A corollary to this is, if the Ace of a particular suit is already 'home',
    any other cards of that suit can be placed immediately home without waiting
    for lower cards of the opposite colour to be placed home.

@{b}About...@{ub}
    Shows the current version of FreeCell and etc. etc...

@{b}Exit:@{ub}
    Exits FreeCell.  You can exit at any time, even in the middle of a game -
    when this happens, you have the option of saving the unfinished game for
    completion later (not for 'setgame').
@ENDNODE


@NODE	"OPTIONSMENU"	"Options Menu Commands"

This section contains information about the Options menu commands in FreeCell.

@{b}Statistics:@{ub}
    Shows you your wins, losses, and streaks.  You can clear the statistics by
    clicking on the Clear button.  The statistics are saved when you exit the
    game.

    Note that if you lose a game and play it again and eventually solve the
    game, that game is still recorded as a loss, but only a single loss.

@{b}Messages:@{ub}
    Turns the messages for invalid moves on or off.  If messages is checked,
    you will receive messages when you attempt an invalid move, and the card
    selected will be reset.  If messages is unchecked, nothing will happen
    when an invalid move is attempted, the card initially selected will remain
    selected.

@{b}DoubleClick:@{ub}
    Double-clicking a card on the main board can quickly move this card to an
    empty free cell.  If this is not wanted, select this menu item to toggle
    this option.  You will then have to manually move the card to the free cell.

@{b}Number of FreeCells:@{ub}
    This option will allow you to select from 0 to 4 FreeCells for the game.
    Just in case you thought the games were getting too easy!

@{b}ScreenMode...:@{ub}
    A screen mode requester!  Here you can select the screen mode that fits your
    fancy.  If you choose the old PAL or NTSC modes, a different card set is
    loaded (they're a bit shorter).  Any current game is not interrupted.

@{b}Tool Dock:@{ub}
    This opens a tool dock window which contains four buttons:

	- New game
	- Select game
	- Restart game
	- Undo move

    This is for lazy people who can't be bothered using menus all the time.

    From version 1.8, you can now choose whether you want the dock horizontal
    or vertical.  Just select from the sub-menu.

@{b}Palette...:@{ub}
    Here you can change the palette to your liking if the cards are too bright
    or too dark and save the changes if you wish.  The palette is saved to a
    file called 'palette.?' (where ? is the current stats file you have open -
    defaults to 'default').  If the file exists when the game is started, this
    palette is loaded, else the (original) default is used.  

@{b}Animation prefs...:@{ub}
    With this you can vary the number of frames and delay between the frames of
    the card animation.

    A requester is brought up with two sliders.  It's self explanatory to use.
    You can specify between 1 and 10 frames, and a delay of 0 to 25 'ticks'.
    There are approximately 50 'ticks' per second.

@{b}Don't Keep the Stats:@{ub}
    This allows you to temporarily stop the gathering of statistics during game
    play.  Wins and losses are not logged.  Unfortunately, at the moment, this
    allows you to cheat a little - if the game looks hard, put this option on,
    then play the game.  If it looks as if you'll win, switch this option off
    before you get that far.  (You didn't hear this from me.)

@ENDNODE


@NODE	"BOARD"		"Board Pieces"

When the game is first started, you have a mostly empty screen.  The game
board is built up as follows:

*   The four @{b}@{u}Free Cells@{uu}@{ub} (top left).  This is a temporary holding place for
    any cards you wish to put there.  When moving cards between columns, any
    free spaces here are used in the move.

    You are able to set the number of FreeCells available for play from 0 to 4.
    This is under the @{"Options menu" LINK OPTIONSMENU}.  Obviously, not many games are solvable
    without any FreeCells, but I dare say there are some.

*   The four @{b}@{u}Home Cells@{uu}@{ub} (top right).  This is the eventual destination of
    all the cards (we hope!).  Aces can be played to home cells immediately,
    and other cards of the same suit can be played in order on top of them.
    You win the game by moving all the cards to the home cells.

*   The main playing board.  Here there are placed 8 columns of cards, all
    dealt face up.  There is a nice indented border placed around the playing
    area and the words 'Free Cells' and 'Home Cells' placed above the
    appropriate cells.  There is also a move counter placed just above the
    King in between the Free and Home cells.
@ENDNODE


@NODE	"STATFILES"	"Statistics Files"

The statistics file is your record of how well you do playing this game.  It
shows how many games you've won and lost this session and also keeps a running
total overall.  This can be cleared by pressing the Clear button on the
@{"stats requester" LINK OPTIONSMENU}.

The stats file also stores your preferences in playing the game.  It stores
whether you like having messages, the current screen mode, whether you want
double-clicking to quickly move a card to a vacant FreeCell, and other things
as well.

To create a new stats file, simply enter a name in the file requester at the
beginning of a sessions play, such as 'stats.Fred' or 'stats.Games100-200', then
press enter, or click OK.  When you end the session (quit FreeCell), the stats
file will be saved under that name.

To use an existing stats file, simply select the one you want on the stats file
requester.

@{b}Note:@{ub}  If you have multiple stats file switched off (see 'Playing the Game'),
the only stats file will be called 'default'.

@NODE   "ML"        "Mailing List"

Lee Hesseldon has kindly started up a mailing list for my program(!).  Here is
where you can post your solutions or ask questions, and suggest improvements
for FreeCell.

The mailing list is: @{b}'freecell@egroups.com'@{ub}.

Of course, if for some reason, you can't manage that list, you can still get
me at:

        @{b}Darryl Hartwig

        darrylh@powerup.com.au@{ub}

I think Lee is compiling a huge list of solutions, so if you are having some
trouble with some particularly nasty game, send an e-mail asking for help,
and if the solution is already there, Lee will be able to e-mail it to you.

@NODE   "CATALOG"   "Catalogs and Locales"

As from version 1.8, localization is now supported.  I haven't actually
created any catalogs yet (as I'm unfortunately not bi-lingual), but I've
included the catalog description for FreeCell.

If any translators want the catalog translation file, I can create the shell
for that and e-mail it to you.  I'll suggest that the catalogs can be put onto
my website and possibly on Aminet as well.

I'm using Flexcat for the translation and coding purposes.

If there any questions regarding this, you can of course e-mail me directly,
or the @("Mailing List" LINK ML}.

@NODE   "OTHER"     "Other Bits & Pieces"

The font I use for the game is 'xen 11 point', and the font for this help file
is 'xcourier 13'.  Both are included in the archive.  Please copy them to your
FONTS: directory.

This version of FreeCell was written by Darryl Hartwig using DICE 3.0.  I've
coded the game for WB3.0, so it might not work on WB2.0 - maybe someone can
let me know.

If you find some games that you're not able to solve (or eventually solved
some hard games), let me know so I can have a go.

With the new 'solution saver' (from version 1.2), you'll be able to e-mail the
solution of any hard-to-solve games to the mailing list (see @{"Mailing List" LINK ML})
or me and I'll include them (eventually maybe) on my web site:

        @{b}http:www.powerup.com.au/~darrylh/c.html@{ub}

This is my first attempt at releasing anything into Aminet, so go easy on me.

This game is FreeWare, but I'd like an e-mail if you download and play it.
The usual legal restrictions apply for this type of software.  All the code in
the archive must be kept together.
