five noughts or crosses in line before your Amiga gets it.

@node ch4 "Tooltypes"

FiveInLine recognizes the following Icon Tooltypes: (not case sensitive)

@{b}BoardSize@{ub} specifies (as you might guess the size of the playing board.
Valid size are 11 (11 x11) through 31 (31 x 31). If not present defaults to 15
(15 x 15)

@{b}UserBegins@{ub} is a Yes/No type specifying who will start. If not present a 
requester will pop up each time you start FiveInLine. From the second game on you
and your Amiga will begin every other game.

@{b}PlayLevel@{ub} specifies the playing level of the Amiga. Valid values are 1 
through 5, 5 being the hardest to beat. The algorithm used is the same, but the
Amiga tends to overlook it's best move (on a random basis) when you lower it's
playing level. Playing level defaults to 5 if this tooltype is missing.

@node ch5 "Playing FiveInLine"

You play the X-s and the Amiga plays the O-s. Your object is to line up five of
your X-s before the Amiga can rank up five of its O-s.

Horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines is allowed and a "four-in-line" open in
both ends is a winner. Watch out for double "three-in-line"s as well...

The Amiga will evaluate all free squares and place it's O where it hurts you
most. If no attack can be made it will try to put your plans for a "fiver" to
rest...

Happy playing!

@node ch6 "History"

The algorithm for FiveInLine was extracted from a Borland Turbo Pascal program
on a PC in the mid eighties.

I wrote a AmigaBasic version for my first Amiga 1000 and my first C version made
it to AmigaLibDisk 163. It was buggy and look rather ugly (I think now!).

I have written a RPG version for the IBM AS/400 using one-dimensional arrays,
but ever since V37 (AmigaDos 2.04) I have wanted to do a new version in C for
the Amiga.

I fiddled round a while trying to use gadgets for the playing board before
deciding to use BevelBoxes.  After uploading an early 2.0 beta version on a BBS
I received enough feedback to debug and refine the program to its current state.

Finally I made a new Icon more in style with the new look of the program.

@node ch7 "Credits"

I want to thank:


Bjørnar Henden for reporting Enforcer hits and helping me find their reason.
Also for giving me the idea of playing levels.

Tommy Larsen for the idea of using Tooltypes.

Øystein Rønning for helping me find the font-related bug keeping gadgets from
appearing under OS V37. Also for pointing me in the right direction for menu
design (NEWLOOKMENUS).

Nico François for making ReqTools.

Jan van den Baard for making GadToolsBox simplifying the layout of screens and
windows.

Commodore for making the Amiga.

Last but not least @{b}Fred Fish@{ub} for his work with the library. KEEP IT UP!


THANK YOU!
