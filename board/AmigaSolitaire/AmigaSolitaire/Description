   Amiga Solitaire is an Amiga version of that every popular card game,
Klondike Solitaire.  The game provides multiple options including six
different decks (with unique king, queen, and jack pictures for three of
the decks), customizable game rules, game timer, the ability to view a
stack, and an undo feature.

   This game originally appeared in the January 1992 issue of Jumpdisk
magazine.  However, that version had a substitute for the good-looking
Batman deck that appears in this original version.

   This game is hereby placed into the public domain.  Please distribute
FREELY and in it's original, unmodified form, with all documentation
