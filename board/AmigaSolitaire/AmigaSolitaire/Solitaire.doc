RULES OF SOLITAIRE:
-------------------

   There are dozens of variations of the traditional game of Solitaire.  This
program emulates the most common variation, Klondike Solitaire, and allows
you to customize the rules of the game to your liking.

   The object of Solitaire is to move all of the 52 cards of the deck into
four foundations (located in the upper right corner of the game screen),
one for each suit with cards arranged in ascending order from Ace up to King.
Seven stacks across the middle of the game screen facilitate the movement of
the cards.

   A game of Solitaire is dealt by placing one card face up on the leftmost
stack and one card face down on each of the next six stacks, then one card
face up on the second stack and one card face down on each of the next five
stacks, then one card face up on the third stack and one card face donw on
each of the next four stacks, and so on until each of the seven stacks has
one face up card as the very top card of the deck.  The result is a right
triangle made up of 28 cards, with the face up cards of each stack
forming the hypotenuse, and the right angle being in the upper right corner.
Fortunately, since this is a computer game, the computer takes care of
dealing the cards for you!

   The remaining 24 cards of the deck are placed in the upper right corner of
the screen to be turned over, either three cards at or time or singly.  The
topmost card of this "flip deck" can then be played either on a stack or
moved up to a foundation.  When all the cards from the deck have been flipped
through, they may be turned back over and flipped through again.  If you are
flipping by 3 cards each time and a card or several cards had been moved from
the flip deck (to a stack or a foundation), then the cards will be flipped
over in a different sequence, allowing for other cards to be played. 

   The top most card of a stack or the topmost card of the "flip deck" may be
moved up to a foundation if it is an Ace or the next higher card in that
suit's sequence.  For example, if the Ace of Spades is moved up to a
foundation (it does not matter which empty foundation it is placed in), then
the 2 of spades must then be placed on top of the Ace of Spades, followed by
the 3 of spades, the 4 of spades, and so on, up to the King of spades.  An
Ace of any suit may only be moved up to an empty foundation, but it does not
matter which empty foundation it is placed in.

   A card may be moved from the flip deck to a stack if it is of the opposite
color of the topmost, face up card on the stack and one denomination less.
For example, if a 6 of spades if on top of one of the deck, either a 5 of 
hearts or a 5 of diamonds may be played on it.  Or if a King of Hearts is on
top of a stack, a Queen of Spades or a Queen of Clubs may be placed on top
of it.  If there is only one card face up on a stack, it may be played on
a different stack in this same manner.

   All the face up cards from one stack may be moved onto a different stack
if the bottomost face up card (the one behind all the others) from the stack
to be moved is of the opposite color and one less than the topmost face up
card of the destination stack.  

   When a stack is empty, only a King may be moved to this stack, or the
face up cards from another stack if the bottomost faceup card is a king.  

   When all 52 cards have been placed, in sequence, into their appropriate
foundation by suit, the game is won!


MENU OPTIONS:
-------------

   There are three menus that are accessed by holding down the right mouse
button and moving the mouse to the title bar at the top of the screen.  A
description of each menu option follows:

    I.  Game menu

        A. About

              This opens a window displaying information about the game,
           including the authors and current version.  Click on the close
           button of the about window to return to the game.

        B. New Game (right-Amiga N)
		        
              This option shuffles the deck and deals a new solitaire game.
           The game timer and the count of the number of times gone through
           the deck are reset, while the rest of the options remain the
           same.

        C. Select Deck (right-Amiga S)

              This option allows you to choose from six different playing
           decks.  A window will open in the middle of the screen displaying
           each of the six decks when you choose this option.  Click on any
           one of the six decks and it will become the current deck.

        D. Quit (right-Amiga Q)

              Selecting this option aborts the game and returns you to the
           operating system.

   II.  Options menu

           These options can be changed at any time during the game.  This
        allows for customization of the game to fit your playing tastes.

        A. Error Flash (right-Amiga F)

              This sets the option of having the computer screen flash
           whenever an illegal move is made.

        B. Card Dragging (right-Amiga C)

           a. On:

                 Turns card dragging on.  See "Mouse Controls", below, for
              an explanation of the actual controls of card dragging.

           b. Off:

                 Turns card dragging off.  See "Mouse Controls", below, for
              an explanation of the actual controls of non-card dragging.

        C. Game Timer (right-Amiga T)

              This option turns on and off the timer of the current game,
           measured in seconds.  If the timer is turned off and then turned
           back on, it will start over at 0 seconds.

        D. Flip by: 

           a. Threes (right-Amiga 3)

                 Flips the deck by three cards with every mouse click.

           b. Ones (right-Amiga 1)

                 Flips the deck by one card with every mouse click.

        E. Times Thru Deck

              This option lets you select the total amount of times you are 
           able to flip through the cards remaining in the deck.  Choices
           are 1, 3, 5, 10, or unlimited times through the deck.

   III. Cheats menu

        A. Undo last move (right-Amiga U)

              This option lets you take back the last move, whether it was
           moving a card from the deck to a stack, or just flipping the deck.
           Selecting this option again before making any other move will
           restore the move you made (i.e., undo the undo).

        B. View stack: (right-Amiga V)

              This option allows you to look at the cards that are face down
           on any of the seven stacks across the middle of the play screen.
           Select this option and then you will be told to select a stack
           to view (displayed in the title bar).  Place the mouse pointer
           over any of the stacks and click the left mouse button.  A window
           will appear in the middle of the screen showing any face cards
           of the selected stack, with the top most card on the very right.
           Click on the close button of the view window to return to the
           game.


MOUSE CONTROLS:
---------------

   Here are descriptions of how to operate the mouse in Solitaire.  First
are instructions that apply whether or not card dragging is selected.  Then
a description of the differences between card dragging and non-card dragging
is explained.

  I. General Operations
     (operations that apply whether card dragging is on or off)

        To flip over the top card of a stack when it is face down, move the
     mouse pointer to the stack and press and release the left mouse
     button.  The top card will flip over.

        To flip cards from the deck, position the mouse pointer over the
     deck (the face-down card back in the upper right corner of the screen)
     and press and release the left mouse button.

        Once all the cards from the deck have been flipped through, a black
     deck outline will appear in the upper left corner of the screen, if you
     have not used all of your times through the deck.  Move the mouse
     pointer over this outline, and press and release the mouse button to
     move all the cards that have been flipped back into the deck.

        Sometimes the top card off a stack can be moved to a foundation and
     all the face up cards from the same stack can also be moved to another
     stack.  So how do you tell the game you want to pick up all the cards
     face up on the stack (to move them to another stack), or only the top
     card (to move it to a foundation)?  Simple: If the mouse pointer is
     over the top card, it will pick up only the top card.  If the mouse
     pointer is over any of the other face up cards of the stack, it will
     pick up all of the cards that are face up on that stack.

 II. Card Dragging On

        With card dragging selected, to select a card (or set of cards) to
     move, position the mouse pointer over the desired card and then press
     and hold the left mouse button.  The cards will be picked up and you
     will be able to drag them around as long as keep the left mouse button
     held down.  To move the card(s) to a new location, release the left
     button when the mouse pointer is over the new location.  If it is a
     valid move, the card will be placed at the new location; if it is not,
     the card will be returned to its original position.

        If you pick up a card (or cards) that you don't want to move,
     simply move the mouse pointer back to where the cards where picked up
     from and release the left mouse button.  The cards will be returned.

        A shortcut is provided to move a card from one of the seven stacks
     up to the foundation of the same suit.  Move the mouse pointer over
     the top card on one of the stacks and press and release the left mouse
     button quickly (this time is determined by your Preference's double
     click setting).  If the card can be moved to one of the foundations,
     it will be moved for you; otherwise it will not be moved.

III. Card Dragging Off

        To select a card (or cards) to move with card dragging unselected,
     move the mouse pointer over the desired card (or cards) to move, press
     and release the left mouse button.  The cards that can be moved will
     be reversed in color to show which cards have been selected to be
     moved.  Now move the mouse pointer to where the cards should be
     moved and press and release the left mouse button.  If the cards can
     be moved, they will be; otherwise, they will remain where they are
     and become unselected.

        If you select a card (or set of cards) that you don't actually
     want to move, simply press and release the mouse pointer over the
     highlited card(s), and they will be deselected.

        A shortcut to move the top card from a stack up to one of the
     foundations is to position the mouse pointer over a stack with at
     least the top card face up (if it isn't, then clicking on the card
     will flip it over).  Double-click on the top card quickly (this time
     is determined by your Preferences Double-Click setting), and if it
     can be moved up to one of the foundations, it will be; otherwise, it
     will be deselected.


PROGRAM INFORMATION:
--------------------

   Amiga Solitaire was written in SAS/C 5.10a.  It was started on an Amiga
1000, under AmigaDOS 1.3, and completed on an Amiga 3000, under AmigaDOS 2.0.
The card graphics were originally drawn in Deluxe Paint III and then
converted into C code.

   I, David Meny, wrote all of the program code, drew the card front graphics
(2-10), the Legend of Lothian deck, and drew the blue diamonds, Amiga, and
fireworks card backfaces.  Albert Penello drew the wonderful face card
graphics, the Batman deck, and the Peter's Quest deck.

   If you have any comments, suggestions, or encounter a problem, please
