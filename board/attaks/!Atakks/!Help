The original help is in French, I'm afraid.

It's essentially an Othello-like clone.  For either one or two players.
The game starts in two player mode.  Press 'i' during the game to have
the computer play blue.  'q' or Escape to quit.

The size of the board can be changed by altering the !Run file with
the syntax shown.
