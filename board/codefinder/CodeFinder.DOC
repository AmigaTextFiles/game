                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This game is the old classic 'MasterMind' where a code is made by
the code maker (in this case by the Amiga) and the code breaker (That's
you !) has the job of finding this code.


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This game should run on any Amiga as far as I know as what written
on an Amiga 1200 with 6MB RAM,68881 and 120MB HD. It was also tested on an
A500 with KS1.3. The game is PAL only because of the large game screen. It
would not make sense to cram it all in just for NTSC. Sorry. 


Gameplay
~~~~~~~~
        The game is played by placing coloured pegs in a sequence and the
subesequent information that you get from the computer as to the colour and
position of the pegs. A black dot indicates that a peg is the right colour
and in the right place. A white dot is a colour that is in the sequence but
is not in the right place. A blank brown dot indicates that a peg is not in
the sequence at all.     
        The black and white dots are displayed above the relevant guess and
bear no relation to the guess in terms of position. ie. a black dot in the
first space DOES NOT MEAN that the first colour peg in the sequence is
right necessarily. The black dots are displayed first then the white dots
and lastly any blank dots, so no position information is inferred by these
pegs whatsoever. 


Controls
~~~~~~~~
        The controls for this game are mouse clicks for the named gadgets
and on the coloured pegs. Keyboard shortcuts are the first letter of the
named gadgets and the keys 1 to 6 for the colour pegs. The 'Guess' key is
<Return>. The arrow keys move the selected position up and down, or you can
click on a square to highlight it. Only the highlighted square gets a
colour and to make this easier the selection moves on one place after each
insertion of a colour. It is possible to place a colour in any part of the
sequence in any order you choose just by highlighting the square to be
changed and clicking on a colour.
