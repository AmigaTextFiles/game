Please note
-----------

Part of the Unix Porting Project.  Support for this program under RISC OS
is only offered to subscribers.  See http://www.chocky.org/unix/
for more information.

This program is 32-bit compatible, and is suitable for all RISC OS
ARM6, ARM7, StrongARM and XScale machines.  It may not be suitable for
earlier machines.


Playing
-------

The original help is in French, I'm afraid.

It's essentially an Othello-like clone.  For either one or two players.
The game starts in two player mode.  Press 'i' during the game to have
the computer play blue.  'q' or Escape to quit.

The size of the board can be changed by altering the !Run file with
the syntax shown.
