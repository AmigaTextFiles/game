Mens Erger Je Niet is an old Dutch board game. It is played
with 2-4 players.
The meaning of this game is to get your four pawns in the coloured
places on the board.
This game can be played with 1 to 4 players of who can be 1 to 4
computer players.

After the dice has rolled you have to move your pawn, if you come
on a place where a pawn stand that pawn must be moved to its
home position.
After a six you have to roll again.

The program is rather straight so you would not have problems with
it.
The program is in dutch if someone would like to have a tranlation to
English you have to send me a Email and I'll make it so.

When you quit the Game the actual preference will be saved, like
players, sound.
