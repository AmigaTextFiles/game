@NODE HTP "HOW TO PLAY KnightsQuest"

        The movement of the gamepiece is the same as the knight in 
        chess ( an `L' shape ). The goal is to land on all of the 
        squares on the board. It is no easy task....

       This is my first real AMIGA PROGRAM ... oh sure i have typed in all 
       the listings from several `C' books, but this is my very first
       AMIGA GAME .... I hope to continue to develop games for the AMIGA.
       
       I first bought an AMIGA 1000 in April of 1988 and in January of 1989
       I bought a AMIGA 500 ... After writting several games and apps in 
       AmigaBasic I bought HiSoftBasic and continued pushing the limits 
       of the language (YahtzeeV1.2). I decided to learn/teach myself `C'.
       So in 1991 I bought a `C' book and in 1992 I bought SAS/C v6.0 and
       a AMIGA 1200 ......  
                           
                           This is Two (2) years of `C' experimenting
                           I urge anyone interested in programming to
                           "just do it" The AMIGA needs many coders to 
                           push the capabilities of the machine ...
                           I have just scratched the surface...
                                        
       I would like to hear what you think...
