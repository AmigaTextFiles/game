    AMASTERMIND V1.0

INSTRUCTIONS:
This is a mastermind-type game in which the player must work out a hidden
combination of colours. Full instructions on how to play the game can be
found in the menu item "Game", "Instructions" (It seemed like a logical
place to put 'em!), for those who really need them.

NOTE: to toggle wbench screen press Left Amiga-A, (Alt-N and M will not work)
      To quit (without using the exit menu) press Ctrl-C.



HALF MEG USERS:
This game will run with only half a meg but it means 
you will be deprived of the pleasure? of seeing my intro-screen, which
took longer to write than the game! So hurry up and buy some memory 
expansion!

DISTRIBUTION
You  may pass this game on to anyone providing you don't make a profit 
from it and providing you keep this doc. file with it.
You may not include any of my code in your programmes without my permission.

SHAREWARE NOTICE:
I spent a lot of time writing this game and I have others planned. This 
is the first programme that I have released to the public and I will 
only release my future creations if I get a suitable response from you!
I am not expecting to make my first million from this but I would 
appreciate a little recognition for my efforts.
I don't care what you send me (money, blank disks, something you wrote, 
a postcard, anything to let me know that someone has actually read this 
stuff!). If you send me enough to cover the cost of postage and a disk 
(or send me a disk and enough for the postage, or a few spare blank 
disks for me) I will send you a registered version (without the 
interuption screen) and/or a compiled version when Mandarin/Jawx 
release the AMOS compiler. As a bonus you will also receive another AMOS
game called landmine (written by PERRY ROSENBOOM).

All suggestions for improvements will 
be considered and implemented if possible.

YOU WILL NO LONGER NEED AMOS OR RAMOS TO RUN THIS GAME.
IT HAS BEEN COMPILED. JUST CLICK ON THE ICON FROM WORKBENCH.

So how about dropping me a line? If you feel generous and want to send 
me a few extra dollars or a box of blank disks, I will be eternally 
grateful and so will my ego!

Send any money in Australian dollars please.
