@node Requirements "System Requirements"

@{b}Hardware@{ub}             Required       640x512x128 capability
                                     (AGA/RTG)  (OS3)
                                     (RTG only) (OS4)
                                    about 2Mb free RAM
                     Recommended    Graphics card
                                    Keyboard with numeric keypad
@{b}Firmware@{ub}             Required       Kickstart R3.0+
@{b}Software@{ub}             Required       OS3.0+
                     Recommended    OpenURL.library (if OS < 4.1.1)
                                    TCP/IP stack

The user's preferred screen mode, game mode, etc. are stored in the
Saga.config file.

If the Saga.config file does not exist, you will be asked to select
your preferred screen mode. You need at least 640*512 resolution in 128
or more colours.

The OS3 version is not intended for OS4 nor MorphOS, and compatibility of
it with those platforms is not assured. You should run the native port for
your platform (because some of the compatibility logic is done at compile-
time rather than at runtime).

If the CLI argument or Workbench tooltype PUBSCREEN is specified, the
game will use the named public screen. This public screen should be at
least slightly larger than 640x512 for this (to accommodate the window
borders.)
  The game allocates various pens if run on a public screen. If there are
not enough available pens, some countries may be shown in grey.

@node Arguments "Startup Arguments"

@{b}CLI Arguments@{ub}

                                    @{b}Saga@{ub}

@{b}Format:          Saga@{ub}
                   [BEOWULF=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE]
                  [BRUNHILD=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE]
                      [EGIL=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE]
                    [RAGNAR=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE]
                 [SIEGFRIED=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE]
                   [STARKAD=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE]
                 [SCREENMODE]
                 [PUBSCREEN=<@{i}screenname@{ui}>]
                     [[FILE=]<@{i}savedgame@{ui}>]]

@{b}Template:@{ub}        BEOWULF/K,BRUNHILD/K,EGIL/K,RAGNAR/K,SIEGFRIED/K,
                 STARKAD/K,SCREENMODE/S,PUBSCREEN/K,FILE

@{b}Purpose:@{ub}         To run the Saga game.

@{b}Specification:@{ub}

    <hero>:      Controls for the relevant hero. This will override
                 the relevant value stored in Saga.config.

    <@{i}savedgame@{ui}>:  the pathname of your saved game to load at
                 startup. This is taken exactly as entered; a '@{b}.saga@{ub}'
                 extension is not automatically appended.

    SCREENMODE:  This allows you to choose a new screenmode at startup,
                 even if a Saga.config file exists.

    PUBSCREEN:   Name of the public screen to run the game on.

    ?:           Displays the command line argument format.

The order of the arguments is interchangeable.

Saga reads initial controls for the heroes from the Saga.config file.
If this is not present, the defaults are BEOWULF=HUMAN, BRUNHILD=NONE,
EGIL=NONE, RAGNAR=AMIGA, SIEGFRIED=NONE and STARKAD=NONE.

@{b}Workbench ToolTypes@{ub}

    BEOWULF=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE              eg. BEOWULF=HUMAN
   BRUNHILD=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE
       EGIL=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE
     RAGNAR=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE
  SIEGFRIED=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE
    STARKAD=HUMAN|AMIGA|NONE
 SCREENMODE                               eg. SCREENMODE
  PUBSCREEN=<screenname>                  eg. PUBSCREEN=Workbench
       FILE=<savedgame>                   eg. FILE=foo.saga

These are equivalent to the relevant CLI arguments.

If you double-click on a saved game file, the game will load with that
saved game. In that case, ToolTypes are of course, taken from the saved
game's .info file.

@{b}How to Run Saga in Greek@{ub}

You need to be using an appropriate 8-point monospaced Greek font (ie. one
which is designed for code page ELOT 928). There are several such fonts
available, eg. from http://www.hri.org/culture97/fonts/AmiGR.lha . Copy
one or all of them into FONTS: . You should download and install
AntiTopaz.lha (from Aminet) and set it to use a font such as topazgr.font
instead of topaz.font .
  Also, you will of course need to set Greek as your preferred language in
Locale Preferences. You may need to download the Boing Bag #2 Greek Locale
package (http://os.amigaworld.de/download.php?id=14) or EPAGrWb.lha (from
Aminet) for eg. the greek.language files.

@endnode

@node Controls "Controls"

Any combination of hero controls is acceptable, but at least one hero must
exist. Note that although the game is supposedly for 2-6 heroes it is in
fact quite possible to play with only one hero.

Note that the 'Message Delay' slider doesn't affect the "Turn # of #"
prompts (because they provide a unique opportunity to restart and/or save
the game), or any prompt which requires a user response.

You can also change the number of turns to play (1-99); this defaults to
20, which corresponds to the original game.

Be aware that there is a menu which contains important functionality (even
if the titlebar is not being displayed). Since the right mousebutton is
used during the game, you need to move the pointer to the top of the screen
before pressing it, if you want to access the menus.

You can load and play a previously saved game from the title screen (or
CLI). You can save the current game, and/or restart the game, at the start
of each turn. The game is automatically saved (to PROGDIR:Autosave.saga)
at the start of each turn. We suggest using an extension of ".saga" for
saved game files.

The game is played with a combination of mouse and keyboard input.
Counters and regions are selected with the mouse. Numeric amounts (except
zero) require a response from the keyboard. Questions with only two
choices (eg. (Y)es/(N)o, or (G)lory/(L)uck) can also be answered by using
the left mousebutton for the first choice, or the right or middle
mousebutton for the second choice.

At the bottom-right corner of the screen you can see what the results of
clicking the mousebuttons will be. For example, if `LMB=Glory/Luck=RMB' is
displayed, the left mousebutton chooses glory and the right mousebutton
chooses luck. If `LMB=OK/OK=RMB' is displayed, either mousebutton will
acknowledge the message.

At all times the name of the counter or region under the pointer is
displayed. You can get more detailed information about any counter or
region by pressing Help whilst the pointer is over the thing you are
interested in, or by shift-clicking on it.

There are just two main phases per turn:
  Move phase: each of your counters moves in turn. The relevant counter is
highlighted (drawn in a paler colour). Then you click the left button
where you want to go and it moves there. You can move up to 4 times for a
hero or 2-3 times for a jarl. Backspace during this will cancel the
counter's moves and let you redo them. When the counter has made all its
moves, or you click the right mousebutton to end its moves early, the next
counter is highlighted and you do its moves.
  Attack phase: click on any of your counters to attack with it. Any
other counters you have in the same space will automatically join the
attack. They are all highlighted. Then click on the defending counter
or region. You can do multiple attacks but only an attacker can only
fight the same defender once per round.

@{b}Game Summary@{ub}

You are able to see a game summary from the menu, or by pressing Help
whilst the pointer is not over a counter or region, or pressing Shift-Help
at any time.

    Hero Name  C-M J K S T C S R Glry Luck $$$$
               o o a i w r o t u
               m v r n o e n a n
               b e l g r a t t e
               a m s d d s r u
               t e   o   u o s
                 n   m   r l
                 t   s   e
                         s

Sword:     First letter of the name of the hero's sword, or `-' for no
           sword.
Treasures: Number of magic treasures possessed by the hero and his jarls.
Control:   `H', `A' or `-' for human, Amiga or none.
Status:    `G', `W' or `D' for good, wounded or dead.
Wealth:    Amount of wealth possessed by the hero and his jarls.

You are also shown the monsters, jarls and treasures remaining in their
respective "piles" of counters. The order in which they are listed is not
necessarily the order in which these counters will be "drawn".
  Additionally, you are shown a historical score graph covering the
previous 40 turns. The white vertical bar indicates the end of the game.
The white horizontal bar indicates the 15 point level (the minimum for
victory).

@{b}Movement@{ub}

Counters to be moved are automatically selected for you, in turn.
Click the left mousebutton in an adjacent region. If you make a mistake
and wish to redo the counter's movements, press Backspace. When finished
moving a counter, press the spacebar.

@{b}Combat@{ub}

You can decide the order in which your attacks will be made. At
each "Select attackers?" prompt, click the left mousebutton on the region
from which you want to attack, or press the spacebar if you have finished
all attacks for the turn. When you have selected an attacker, you will be
prompted to "Select defender?". Click on the defending counter or region,
or press the spacebar to return to the "Select attacker?" prompt. After
the combat, you will be returned to the "Select attacker?" prompt to
conduct other attacks.

Note that the middle mousebutton can be used instead of the spacebar, or
you can click the left mousebutton in the message area at the bottom of
the screen, or you can click the right mousebutton anywhere except the
title bar.

@{b}Licence@{ub}

Saga is open source freeware. These are the licence conditions:

    * you are not allowed to sell it, or modified versions of it, without
      consent (however, magazine covermounting is permitted);

    * any modified versions must be clearly marked as such, and not be
      misrepresented as being the original software;

    * you are not allowed to claim you wrote this software, or to remove
      or alter the existing credits (though you may append to them as
      appropriate);

    * you may distribute this unmodified executable either with or without
      the source code, at your discretion. (The official release packages
      will always include source code.) However, modified versions
      (including ports) must include both the executable and source code;

    * any accessory files (eg. catalog files) must be accompanied by
      source code (eg. the corresponding .ct file);

    * software into which code or algorithms are copied must be open
      source, and appropriate credit must be given;

    * you must allow us the right to backport improvements you make to
      this software or algorithms;

    * contributions cannot later be arbitrarily rescinded; and

    * you are not allowed to modify the software to insert logic bombs,
      spyware, digital restrictions management, copy protection, online
      activation, virii or other malware, nor may you include it in any
      package, compilation or download containing these.

If you would like to become an official co-developer of this game, please
contact us.

@{b}Bugs@{ub}

Amiga development and style guidelines have been adhered to, using the
official Amiga Developer CD 2.1 as authoritive reference.

Please contact us immediately if any bugs are found. You can use
our utility, Report+, to generate bug reports for Saga, though this is
not required. Please write bug reports in English if possible. Please do
not assume that any bug has already been reported.

@{b}Future@{ub}

Users are invited to contribute suggestions for the future of the game.
In particular, new monster species, swords, treasures and regions may be
contributed by users.

Users, especially those who have played the original board game, are
requested to contact us to discuss their interpretations of the
ambiguities in the rulebook.

Translators are also required for most European languages.

This software is in maintenance mode: bug fixes will be forthcoming
if necessary, but major new features are unlikely. It does not meet our
current standards of quality, and a complete rewrite would probably be
best, but has been judged not worth doing in this case. If you would
like to take over, please email us.

@{b}Source code@{ub}

@node Introduction "Introduction"

Danger lurks in the frozen wastes of the north. There are monsters in the
green lands to the south. Everywhere there are foes to slay and kingdoms
to conquer. This is the age of heroes, and the tales of your glory will
live on long after your lifetime.

In SAGA: Age of Heroes, players defeat evil monsters, win fabulous
treasures and rule great kingdoms in their quest to gain glory and be the
one hero whose memory will live on forever in the songs and stories of the
age.

The early Middle Ages was a time of bold warriors, great deeds, and heroic
sagas. Heroes had a philosophy centred around the accumulation of glory
and a belief that the only thing of enduring value was to be remembered in
the songs and epic tales of their people. Those who successfully performed
fantastic deeds were remembered on earth and those who failed were
forgotten.

Even the gods were thought to shape their values in this fashion. Valhalla
was filled with brave warriors who had done many glorious things and
proven their right to be accepted into the company of the mighty. Those
who had failed to gain glory were left to wander in Hel - a much colder
fate. The gaining of glory was important to a warrior in this life and the
next.

SAGA minigame recreates a mythical time period occurring sometime after
the fall of Rome - the age of heroes and Vikings! Each player takes a
heroic figure and attempts to perform deeds that will generate enough
glory to ensure that the hero's memory will live in the sagas composed
after his death.

To gain glory, the heroes slay monsters, accumulate treasure hoards,
recruit lesser heroes ("jarls", or earls) as their companions, and
establish kingdoms. The hero who gains the most glory is the one whose
fame will live on in the sagas, while the others are doomed to be
forgotten by posterity. Each player must be decisive and alert to grasp
chances and avoid having other heroes gain glory at his expense.

SAGA minigame is an invitation to relive the epic ancient days when men
could be heroes and dragons walked the earth.

                  +-------+
    Combat Factor | 5   4 | Movement Factor
                  |       |
                  | <pic> | Picture
                  |       |
                  | SIEG. | Name
                  +-------+

The first number (reading left to right) is the combat factor of the
counter. It is used when determining the outcome of a battle. The second
number is the movement factor of the counter. It is the number of areas on
the map through which the counter may move in one turn.

The name on the counter specifies who or what the counter represents. It
serves to personalize the game and allows one to keep precise records of
one's magical items and jarls.

The type of counter lets the play know what sort of beast, person, or
object the counter represents. There are counters for heroes, jarls,
magic weapons, magic treasures, trolls, ghosts, drow, giants, witches, and
dragons. In advanced mode, there are also counters for hydras, krakens and
sea serpents.

@{b}Map.@{ub} The map is in several shades of colour. The colours
distinguish the various areas from each other and from the sea.

Each area has a name and a taxation factor. For example:

    Finmark (3)

This name is the name of that area, and the taxation factor indicates how
rich the area will be as part of a kingdom. Taxation factors are more
fully explained in the rules section on @{" Kingdoms and Taxes " link Kingdoms}.

@node Winning "Object of Play and Winning the Game"

The objective of each SAGA player is to amass as much glory as possible by
the end of the game. The hero with the most glory at the end of the 20th
turn of play (whether alive or dead) is the winner, and will be remembered
the longest in the sagas of the Norsemen. The others will be forgotten
soon after their lifetimes. However, all heroes who gain 15 or more points
of glory will be accepted into Valhalla to fight for Odin at Ragnarok -
the ultimate goal of any Norse hero!
@endnode

@node Glory "Glory and Luck"

@{b}Glory@{ub} is the reputation of the hero. It determines who wins the game.

@{b}Luck@{ub} represents the good fortune of the hero. A hero gains luck as the
result of success in combat. Luck may be used to alter combat results (see
@{"Luck in Combat" link Modifiers}) or to recruit jarls (see @{"Jarls" link Jarls}).

The following things will affect glory and luck totals during the game:

@{b}Slaying Monsters.@{ub} Each time a hero and/or the jarls of a hero
slay a monster, the hero gets either a certain number of glory points or a
certain number of luck points, according to the following table:

    @{u}Monster        Glory   Luck@{uu}
    Dragon           6       5
    Drow             3       2
    Ghost            2       2
    Giant            4       3
    Troll            3       3
    Witch            5       4
   *Hydra            7       5
   *Sea Serpent      7       5
   *Kraken           8       5

* Hydra, Sea Serpent and Kraken are only used in advanced mode.

@{b}Slaying Other Heroes or Jarls.@{ub} When a hero and his jarls (or
either alone) slay another hero or jarl, the hero receives glory or luck
equal to one-half the combat factor of the hero and/or jarl(s) slain
rounding down. For example, if Siegfried (5-4) slays Ivar (4-2), Siegfried
has the option of taking 2 points of luck or 2 points of glory. He may not
take 1 of each.

@{b}Wounding Monsters, Jarls, or Heroes.@{ub} One-half of the luck or glory points
(rouded down) that would be gained for slaying these counters are gained
for wounding them. For example, if Siegfried only wounded Ivar, he would
be able to gain only 1 point of luck or 1 point of glory. Someone wounding
a dragon would be able to choose between 3 points of glory and 2 points of
luck.

@{b}Fleeing Battle.@{ub} Every time hero is forced to flee a battle (by combat
result or magical spell), that hero loses 2 points of glory.

@{b}Recruiting Jarls.@{ub} Each jarl recruited by the hero is worth (at the time of
recruitment) one-half his combat factor (rounding down) in either luck or
glory. For example, if the jarl Bjarki (3-3) is recruited by a hero, that
hero may select from 1 point of luck or 1 point of glory. Each jarl that
is slain while in the service of the hero removes from that hero either
luck or glory equal to one-half the jarl's combat factor (player's
choice - does not have to be what was gained when the jarl was recruited).
At the end of the game, each jarl is worth, in glory, an additional one-
half (rounding down) of his combat factor to the hero he is serving. Thus
if Bjarki is one of Beowulf's jarls at the end of the game, he is worth 1
point of glory to Beowulf.

Note that a hero must always expend a point of luck to recruit a jarl.

@{b}Gaining Gold and Luck.@{ub} At the end of the game, gold and luck are converted
to glory points. Every 10 gold marks in the hero's hoard is worth 1 point
of glory, and every 3 points of luck remaining to the hero are worth 1
point of glory.
@endnode

@node Setup "Set Up"

There are two versions of the game which can be played. Basic mode is
most faithful to the original version, whereas advanced mode is an
expanded version of the original, unique to this Amiga conversion, which
has:

    * 3 new monster types (hydra, kraken and sea serpent);
    * 4 new monsters (2 hydras, 1 kraken and 2 sea serpents); and
    * 3 new treasures (magic crown, healing potion and teleport scroll).

Divide the counters into four piles, keeping the heroes separate. The four
piles, all face down, should be: monsters of all sorts, jarls, magic
weapons, and magic treasures.

Each player picks a hero counter to represent him in the game. Each player
then picks a magic sword at random from the face-down pile. Magic swords
will not be given out again in the game and so all of the left-over magic
swords are put aside until the next game.

A number of monster counters equal to the number of players in the game is
picked at random from the face-down pile of monsters. For each monster
roll two dice, and place that monster in the area indicated. Monsters are
placed on the board face up.

A number of jarl counters equal to the number of players in the game is
picked at random from the pile of jarls and placed face down in random
countries in the same manner that the monsters were placed. More than one
jarl and/or monster may be placed in the same area.

Heroes begin the game in a randomly determined area (found in the same
manner as monsters are placed). This area should be noted, as it is
sometimes necessary to know a hero's home country.

Each player begins the game with three points of luck but no glory or
wealth. All of these amounts will change as the game progresses, but none
may ever go below zero.
@endnode

@node Sequence "Sequence of Play"

  1. @{b}Movement.@{ub} All heroes and jarls move. The hero with the most glory and
     his jarls move first. In cases of ties the heroes roll dice to
     see who goes first, with the highest roll going first.

  2. @{b}Combat and Jarls.@{ub} Combat occurs in the same sequence as movement;
     jarls are recruited after combat.

  3. @{b}Kingdoms and Taxes.@{ub} Heroes and jarls collect taxes from the areas in
     the hero's kingdom (if any).

  4. @{b}Place Monsters.@{ub} A number of monsters equal to the number of heroes in
     play are randomly placed face up by rolling two dice and placing the
     monster in the area indicated. (This is done every turn until all
     counters are used. "Dead" monsters may not be reused.)

  5. @{b}Place Jarls.@{ub} A number of jarls equal to the number of heroes
     in play are randomly placed face down by rolling two dice and placing
     the jarl in the area indicated. (This is done every turn until all
     counters are used. "Dead" jarls may not be reused.)

  6. @{b}Mark Turn.@{ub} One turn is marked off. At the end of the 20th
     turn the game is over and players total their glory to determine who
     has won.
@endnode

@node Movement "Movement"

A counter may move as many areas as its movement factor. Each area is
defined by colour or, in the case of sea areas, by dividing lines.
Counters may move and remain in sea areas just as if they were on land.
There is no difference between land movement and sea movement.

Movement is always voluntary, except for certain combat results. Counters
do not have to move their full movement rate, and may thus choose to move
any amount from zero to their total movement. All or none of a player's
counters (hero and jarls) may move.

As long as a counter is moving it may ignore all other counters. Thus a
counter representing a hero could pass through areas containing other
heroes, monsters, and jarls without having to fight or otherwise interact
with any of them. When a counter chooses to fight it ends its movement for
the turn.

Counters may move from one area to any adjacent area, even if the second
area is adjacent only by a corner.

A counter's movement may be affected by magical treasure or the gods.
@endnode

@node Combat "Combat"

Combat may only be conducted between counters in the same area. Combat is
resolved using the following procedure.

 1. Determine the attacker(s) and defender(s).

 2. Roll for drow, witch, or ghost magic spells (if applicable).

 3. Modify the die roll with luck.

 4. Total all modifiers to combat (runes, gods, spells, magic items, and
    luck).

 5. Roll one die and check the @{"Combat Results Table" link Table} to determine the
    outcome of the battle after adding all modifiers to the die roll.

 6. Apply the combat result.

 7. Check to see if a god noticed the battle.

A more complete explanation of each step is given below.

 1. @{b}Determine the attacker and defender.@{ub} Combat occurs in the same order
    as movement (descending order of glory points as totalled at the
    beginning of each turn). The person whose turn it is is automatically
    considered the attacker, while those being attacked are considered the
    defenders. The order of areas is at the discretion of the attacker.

    Heroes @{i}must@{ui} attack at least one monster (if there is a monster) in the
    area they are in during the combat portion of the turn. If there is
    more than one monster they may choose which one they wish to fight.
    They may attack more than one monster in an area.

    Heroes may also attack other heroes and jarls, in which case the
    defending hero or jarl may call for aid to any other counters in the
    area which are controlled by the same player. The attacker must then
    attack not only the first counter but all of the counters who have
    come to the aid of the first counter attacked as well.

    Heroes may also attack areas, using the area's tax factor as a combat
    strength. This is detailed more fully under @{"Kingdoms and Taxes" link Kingdoms}.

    Heroes may attack any combination of the above. Any counter may be
    attacked any number of times by other counters, with the limitation
    that each counter may attack a given counter @{i}only once@{ui} in a
    combat turn.

 2. @{b}Roll for drow, witch, or ghost magic spells (if applicable).@{ub} Drow,
    witch, and ghost monster counters have the use of magic spells. These
    spells take effect before the combat die roll and may modify the
    results of the combat. Ghosts will only use a spell if they roll a 1,
    2, or 3, in which case they will cast the spell with that number. Drow
    (evil dark elves) will roll a die and cast the spell having the number
    that is rolled. Witches will roll two dice and cast two spells, one
    with each of the numbers rolled. If the same spell is indicated on
    each die, it will be cast twice (and the effect applied twice). The
    spells will be explained later in the @{"Modifiers to Combat" link Modifiers} section.

 3. @{b}Modify the die roll with luck.@{ub} Before the die is rolled, heroes who
    are involved in the battle (or who have jarls involved in the battle)
    may modify the die roll up or down one with each point of luck
    expended before the die is rolled.

 4. @{b}Total all modifiers to combat (runes, gods, magic items, spells and
    luck).@{ub} Runes are learned the first time a hero slays a drow, witch or
    ghost. Each hero may learn only one run. The rune learned may have an
    effect upon combat. All runs are explained more fully under @{"Runes" link Runes}.

    Gods sometimes notice the struggles of men and intervene in them. A
    god's intervention will not change the result of a magic spell. The
    specifics of notice and intervention are covered more fully in the
    section of @{"Gods" link Gods}. Usually intervention occurs in the form of additions
    or subtractions to or from the combat strength of one side or the
    other in battle.

    Magic items may add to either side's combat strength on either attack
    or defence; this is explained more fully under @{"Magic Items" link Treasures}.

    Spells and luck are as above.

 5. @{b}Roll one die and check the Combat Results Table to determine the
    outcome of the battle after adding all modifiers to the die roll.@{ub} After
    all modifications to the combat strengths of both sides have been
    made, subtract the defender's strength from the attacker's and consult
    the @{"Combat Results Table" link Table} to determine the results according to a
    die roll and modifications due to luck.

 6. @{b}Apply the combat result.@{ub}

    ATTACKERS KILLED. Remove the counter(s) representing the attacker from
    the board. They will not return.

    ATTACKERS WOUNDED. Attacking heroes are wounded. Attacking jarls are
    removed from the board and placed, upside down, in their pile, from
    which they will reenter play normally. There is no further effect from
    being wounded, except that jarls that reenter play after being wounded
    are considered unrecruited jarls.

    ATTACKERS FLEE. The defender may move the attacker's counter(s).

    NO RESULT. The fight breaks off without definite decision. All
    counters remain in the area.

    DEFENDERS FLEE. The attacker may move the defender's counter(s).

    DEFENDERS WOUNDED. Defending heroes are wounded. Jarls and monsters on
    the defending side are removed from the board and placed in their
    respective piles. They will reenter play normally.

    DEFENDERS KILLED. Remove the counter(s) representing the defender from
    the board. They will not return.

 6. @{b}Check to see if a god noticed the battle.@{ub} Each player involved in a
    battle may roll one die to see if the battle was noticed by a god. If
    the player rolls a 1 (a 1 or 2 if the player's hero has the rune Amsir
    and was involved in the battle), the battle was noticed. Effects of
    the gods noticing a battle are covered more fully in the section
    titled @{"Gods" link Gods}.

@endnode

@node Modifiers "Modifiers to Combat"

@{b}Spells.@{ub} Spells are rolled for on the following table:

 1. HAGALL - This spell brings down hail and reduces the combat factor of
    each counter in the area (including the caster) by one for the rest of
    the turn. It also prevents any of the counters from moving by sea next
    turn.

 2. IS - This spell covers the land with ice making it impossible for any
    hero to found, or continue to have a kingdom in the country. The
    players should note this fact for the future.

 3. JARA - All in the area lose their next turn.

 4. NIED - This spell works if the person it is cast against rolls a 1, 2,
    or 3 on a die. It makes the combat result an automatic "no result" and
    causes all in the area to lose one turn.

 5. WYNN - This spell works if the person it is cast against rolls a 1, 2,
    or 3 on a die. It forces all of the heroes and jarls in the area to
    flee.

 6. YR - This spell works if the person it is cast against rolls a 1, 2,
    or 3 on a die. It causes all counters in the area (except face down
    jarls or monster counters) to be wounded.

@{b}Luck in Combat.@{ub} A hero may change any combat die roll which involves the
hero or any of his jarls. This is done by expending 1 point of luck
for every 1 that the hero wishes to change the number rolled. Luck must be
allocated for this purpose before the die is rolled, and is lost even if
the addition or subtraction made no difference.

When a player recruits a jarl, he must expend 1 point of luck to
successfully convince the jarl to join him. If the point of luck is not
expended, the jarl will suffer the actual combat result indicated by the
attempt to recruit him (see @{"Jarls" link Jarls}).

@{b}Magic Swords@{ub}. There are several magic swords in the game. Many
heroes of the sagas got their start by obtaining a magic sword. The swords
available for use in the game are:

    BALMUNG - This sword adds +1 to the user's combat factor. In any fight
    where its user is attacking an enemy using magic armour it cancels out
    the benefit of the magic armour. Thus, the Mail Coat and the Magic
    Shirt (see @{"Magic Treasures" link Treasures}) provide no protection against Balmung.

    DRAGVENDILL - This sword adds +2 to the user's combat factor.

    GRAM - This sword adds +2 to the user's combat factor.

    HRUNTING - This sword adds +1 to the user's combat factor. It also
    means the other side must flee instead when the Combat Results Table
    indicates that the user's side must flee.

    LOVI - This sword adds +1 to the user's combat factor. In any battle
    against a side including jarls, it adds an additional +2 to the combat
    factor.

    TYRFING - This sword adds +2 to the user's combat factor.

If a hero with a sword is slain, or a jarl with a sword is wounded or
slain, the sword will remain in that area until someone comes and picks it
up (ends their movement in the area with the sword).

@{b}Other Modifiers@{ub}. Magic Treasures, Runes, and the Gods may also
affect combat. These are explained later in their own sections.
@endnode

@node Options "Options After Combat"

If a hero is wounded or killed as a result of combat, there are several
options open to him.

If wounded, a hero may heal the wound by spending one turn at rest in the
hero's starting country. Any hero who is wounded while having an unhealed
wound dies. The rune ING allows heroes to heal themselves by remaining at
rest one turn in any area.

If a hero has died, the player may:

 1. Withdraw from play and total up glory, as if the game were over. The
    player then hopes that none of the other players will exceed this
    total in the remaining turns. The amount of glory that the hero ends
    the game with is the amount the hero had when he died.

 2. Restart the hero. A restarted hero gets three points of luck, but gets
    none of the glory, jarls, or wealth of the old hero. (This is an
    option for the player to begin the game again.)

 3. Transfer all the hero's luck to one of his jarls and play that
    jarl as a hero. That jarl counter is thereafter treated as a hero
    counter. This symbolizes the heroic tradition passing from the hero to
    one of his faithful followers. The player loses all accumulated glory
    but keeps luck, jarls, and kingdom.
@endnode

@node Jarls "Jarls"

Heroes had friends and followers who aided them in the slaying of
monsters, the doing of great deeds, and the ruling of their kingdoms.
These men were called jarls (the Norse equivalent of `earl' - pronounced
yarl).

A jarl is recruited by a hero who beats him in combat and then expends a
point of luck. Only jarls may be recruited this way, not monsters or other
heroes. Only jarls that are face down may be recruited.

Jarls are recruited during the combat phase. To recruit a jarl a hero must
first attack the jarl. All jarls are kept face down on the board until
they are attacked. Once a jarl is turned face up, the hero must attack. To
recruit the jarl the hero must obtain a "defenders flee", "defenders
wounded", or "defenders killed" result in combat against the jarl and then
expend one point of luck. The hero must be present in the combat, but may
have the help of other jarls. Combat effects will affect the hero, but not
the jarl unless the hero declines to expend a point of luck, in which case
all effects will be [as] normal.

Jarls who are wounded and removed from the board are considered to be
unrecruited, unwounded jarls when they are returned to play.

Jarls are used by heroes to collect taxes for them (see
@{"Kingdoms and Taxes" link Kingdoms}. If a recruited jarl kills a monster, hero, or jarl
by himself the luck or glory goes to his master. Recruited jarls may add
countries to their hero's kingdom.

No hero may have more than 4 jarls recruited at any one time.
@endnode

@node Kingdoms "Kingdoms and Taxes"

A hero may do other things besides fighting with monsters, jarls, and
other heroes. One of the things he or she may do is start a kingdom. Many
famous heroes (such as Beowulf) did so. To start a kingdom the hero moves
himself and/or any controlled jarls into any country that has not had an
IS (ice) spell cast upon it. The player must then successfully attack the
country, using the area's tax factor as a combat factor. Note that a hero
or jarl may want to, or have to, attack other counters in the area on the
same turn that he attacks the country. A successful attack is an attack
that yields a result of "defenders flee", "defenders wounded", or
"defenders killed". If the hero fails the attackers will suffer the
adverse result indicated by the Combat Results Table. The roll represents
the necessity of clearing out bandits, wild beasts, claimants to the
throne, and so forth.

After the hero has set the country in order (the attack is carried out in
the combat portion of the turn and counts as an attack), taxes may be
collected from the country every turn the hero or one of his jarls spends
in the country.

If a country is left for a turn without the hero or one of his jarls in
it, the country is overrun by bandits, wild animals, and other evil
creatures and men, and must be subdued again by a successful attack on the
Combat Results Table.

The hero adds the taxes to his hoard immediately if the hero is in the
area when they are paid. The hero also adds the taxes to his hoard if the
hero's counter moves through the country after the taxes have been paid to
his jarl. A jarl may leave an area and travel to the hero with the taxes
he has collected.

If a jarl is killed after collecting taxes but before the hero has placed
the taxes in his hoard, the killer gets the taxes. If the killer is a jarl
the taxes are not added to his hero's hoard until the hero and the jarl
are in the same area at the same time. Taxes are transferred merely by
placing the counters in the same area at some point during movement.

A hero with taxes who is slain yields no treasure to the slayer.

All taxes are collected in golden marks. The number of golden marks raised
each turn is a number equal to the country's tax factor. Thus Frankland
(8) yields eight gold marks a turn.
@endnode

@node Gods "Gods"

The gods may notice the actions of men. Any time a hero has fought a
battle he or may check to see if the gods have noticed him. On a roll of 1
(1 or 2 if the player has the rune Amsir) the gods have noticed the
battle. The following tables tell which god notices and what the god does.
First roll one die to see which god has noticed:

 1. Frey, god of fertility and life.
 2. Loki, god of luck and of trouble.
 3. Njord, god of wealth and of the sea.
 4. Odin, god of battles and of death.
 5. Thor, god of thunder.
 6. Tyr, god of war and of the sword.

Now roll a second die and check the result with the appropriate god to
determine the result:

    FREY - this god's attention results in his sending magical maidens to
    heal the hero's wounds.
        1-4    Frey will send a maiden to heal the next wound. This
               results in the next wound being healed without the hero
               spending any time resting.
        5-6    Frey will send a maiden to heal the hero's next two wounds.
               These wounds are healed as the above.

    LOKI - this god's intervention immediately affects the hero's luck.
        1-3    Loki steals a point of luck from the hero.
        4-6    Loki grants the hero a point of luck for his daring.

    NJORD - this god's notice affects things other than combat. Roll
    immediately upon gaining Njord's attention.
        1-2    Next time the hero moves by sea Njord aids him and the
               entire sea counts as only 1 area for movement purposes.
        3-4    Njord gives 1-6 marks to the hero as a gift.
        5      Njord takes 1-6 marks from the hero's hoard as due tribute.
        6      Njord prevents the hero from travelling by sea the next
               turn.

    ODIN - this god's notice affects the hero the @{i}next@{ui} time he fights a
    battle. Roll then to see what Odin does.
        1      Odin decides that the hero is ready for Valhalla and aids
               the hero's enemies by adding 3 to their combat strength.
        2      Odin aids the hero's enemies by sending a wolf, adding 1 to
               their combat factor.
        3      Odin's ravens are sent by him to observe the battle, but
               Odin does nothing.
        4      Odin sends a wolf to aid the hero, adding 1 to his side's
               combat factor.
        5      Odin aids the hero by adding 3 to his side's combat
               strength.
        6      Odin intervenes personally, and adds 5 to the combat
               strength of the hero. The hero also gains 3 points of
               glory.

    THOR - this god's notice takes effect after the result of the hero's
    @{i}next@{ui} battle. Roll then to see what Thor does.

        1-3    Thor decides that the hero deserves no reward.
        4-5    Thor rewards the hero by speaking to him, thus giving 1
               point of glory.
        6      Thor honours the hero by eating with him, thus granting 2
               points of glory.

    TYR - this god's notice affects the hero's @{i}next@{ui} battle. Roll then to
    see what Tyr does.

        1      Tyr aids the hero's enemies by adding 1 to their combat
               strength.
        2-3    Tyr decides that the fight is balanced fairly, and does not

@node Treasures "Magic Treasures"

Magic treasures are found with dragons.

In basic mode, each of the first four dragons to be placed on the board
will have a magic treasure. The last two dragons have 20 marks of treasure
instead of a magic treasure.

In advanced mode, each of the six dragons and two hydras will have a magic
treasure.

The four basic magic treasures are:

BROSUNG NECKLACE - This treasure is worth 20 marks. It may be traded for
any item in a dragon's hoard. The wearer of the Brosung Necklace moves
into the area adjacent to that of the dragon, and gives it to the dragon
while taking what the dragon had. The wearer may then see what he had
traded for. One cannot change one's mind when dealing with dragons, so
there is no altering the exchange once it is made.

FREY FAXI - This treasure is a magic horse that can be ridden only 3
times. It doubles the rider's movement factor and will carry any number of
riders. After the third use remove the treasure from the board.

MAGIC SHIRT - This treasure is from Ireland. It adds 1 to the combat
strength of the wearer when he is being attacked. The magic shirt also
adds 1 to the movement factor of the person wearing it.

MAIL COAT - This treasure adds 2 to the combat strength of its wearer, but
only when the wearer is @{i}defending@{ui}.

In advanced mode, there are also the following four treasures:

HEALING POTION - This treasure can be used only once. It will heal any
wounds that the hero is suffering.

INVISIBILITY RING - This treasure can be worn as desired when being
attacked. There is a half chance that its wearer can avoid the combat.

MAGIC CROWN - There is a half chance per turn per kingdom that an
abandoned kingdom will remain loyal.

TELEPORT SCROLL - This treasure can be used only once. It will teleport
the user to any desired location.

One counter may have any number of magic treasures.
@endnode

@node Runes "Runes"

When a hero kills a drow, ghost, or witch for the first time he learns a
magic rune. A rune is a poem or song that, when recited, produces some
magical effect. Each hero may learn one, and @{i}only@{ui} one, rune during the
game. To find out which rune the hero has learned the player should roll
on the table below. More than one hero may have the same rune, but no hero
may have more than one rune.

 1. AMSIR - This is the rune of the gods. A hero with this rune has twice
    the chance of having the gods notice him (the gods notice on a
    roll of 1 or 2 instead of just a roll of 1).

 2. EON - This is the rune of time. A hero with this rune has a movement
    factor one greater than the factor printed on his counter.

 3. GEOFU - This is the rune of gifts and property. The hero with this
    rune will have all the areas in his kingdom yield one additional mark
    over and above the tax factor each turn.

 4. ING - This is the rune of healing and fertility. A hero who has this
    rune can heal his wounds by spending one turn anywhere at rest instead
    of having to return to his starting country.

 5. OGAL - This is the rune of beserk fury. A hero who has this rune has a
    combat factor one greater than the factor printed on his counter.

 6. SYGIL - This is the rune of the sun. It is useful against evil magic
    spells. Every time a spell is cast at the hero who has this rune, the
    hero rolls a die. If the hero rolls a 1, 2, or 3 the spell does not
    affect the hero (although it may affect those in the same area with
    him).

@node Differences "Differences"

There are certain ambiguities and contradictions in the original
printed rules. We have attempted to discern the intended rule in these
cases, but whether such an interpretation would corresponds with the
official TSR interpretation, or various ad hoc interpretation made by
players of the game, cannot be guaranteed.

Here is a list of confirmed differences between the original board
game and this Amiga conversion. If you are concerned about these, please
indicate which rules you would like to see changed. The differences are
roughly sorted in order of descending importance.

Note that the @{"rulebook" link Rulebook}, as presented here, is amended in
accordance with these differences. The original rulebook is @{"here" link Original}.

In the board game, heroes and jarls can trade (`lend') swords and
treasures to each other.

In the board game, fleeing is handled differently.

In the board game, you can use as much luck as you wish to affect a
combat. In this version, you can only use 9 points of luck at most per
combat.

In the board game, the attacking and defending players decide
simultaneously how many luck to expend.

In the board game, combat is handled one region at a time. In this
version you can make your attacks in any order.

In the board game, praying is optional.

In this version, the combat results table extends infinitely in all
directions; no distinction is made between the die roll and combat
strength components of the result.

In the board game, a player's counters may be moved in any order.

In the board game, when two maidens are granted the second maiden requires
the hero to worship Frey.

In the board game, if Njord aids your movement, this occurs the next time
you move by sea. In this version, it always occurs on the next turn.

@node Original "Original Rulebook"

These are the original TSR rules.

@{b}INTRODUCTION@{ub}

Danger lurks in the frozen wastes of the north. There are monsters in the
green lands to the south. Everywhere there are foes to slay and kingdoms
to conquer. This is the age of heroes, and the tales of your glory will
live on long after your lifetime.

In SAGA: Age of Heroes, players defeat evil monsters, win fabulous
treasures and rule great kingdoms in their quest to gain glory and be the
one hero whose memory will live on forever in the songs and stories of the
age.

The early Middle Ages was a time of bold warriors, great deeds, and heroic
sagas. Heroes had a philosophy centred around the accumulation of glory
and a belief that the only thing of enduring value was to be remembered in
the songs and epic tales of their people. Those who successfully performed
fantastic deeds were remembered on earth and those who failed were
forgotten.

Even the gods were thought to shape their values in this fashion. Valhalla
was filled with brave warriors who had done many glorious things and
proven their right to be accepted into the company of the mighty. Those
who had failed to gain glory were left to wander in Hel - a much colder
fate. The gaining of glory was important to a warrior in this life and the
next.

SAGA minigame recreates a mythical time period occurring sometime after
the fall of Rome - the age of heroes and Vikings! Each player takes a
heroic figure and attempts to perform deeds that will generate enough
glory to ensure that the hero's memory will live in the sagas composed
after his or her death.

To gain glory, the heroes slay monsters, accumulate treasure hoards,
recruit lesser heroes ("jarls", or earls) as their companions, and
establish kingdoms. The hero who gains the most glory is the one whose
fame will live on in the sagas, while the others are doomed to be
forgotten by posterity. Each player must be decisive and alert to grasp
chances and avoid having other heroes gain glory at his or her expense.

SAGA minigame is an invitation to relive the epic ancient days when men
could be heroes and dragons walked the earth.

@{b}GAME COMPONENTS@{ub}

@{b}Counters@{ub}. Printed on all counters used in this game are two numbers, a
name, and a type. For example:

                  +-------+
    Combat Factor | 5   4 | Movement Factor
                  |       |
                  | <pic> | Picture
                  |       |
                  | SIEG. | Name
                  +-------+

The first number (reading left to right) is the combat factor of the
counter. It is used when determining the outcome of a battle. The second
number is the movement factor of the counter. It is the number of areas on
the map through which the counter may move in one turn.

The name on the counter specifies who or what the counter represents. It
serves to personalize the game and allows one to keep precise records of
one's magical items and jarls.

The type of counter lets the play know what sort of beast, person, or
object the counter represents. There are counters for heroes, jarls,
magic weapons, magic treasures, trolls, ghosts, drow, giants, witches, and
dragons.

@{b}Map.@{ub} The map is in several shades of colour. The colours
distinguish the various areas from each other and from the sea.

Each area has a number, a name and a taxation factor. For example:

    1:1 Finmark (3)

The number is used for randomly locating counters (see @{b}Set Up@{ub}).
This name is the name of that area, and the taxation factor indicates how
rich the area will be as part of a kingdom. Taxation factors are more
fully explained in the rules section on @{b}Kingdoms and Taxes@{ub}.

@{b}OBJECT OF PLAY AND WINNING THE GAME@{ub}

The objective of each SAGA player is to amass as much glory as possible by
the end of the game. The hero with the most glory at the end of the 20th
turn of play (whether alive or dead) is the winner, and will be remembered
the longest in the sagas of the Norsemen. The others will be forgotten
soon after their lifetimes. However, all heroes who gain 15 or more points
of glory will be accepted into Valhalla to fight for Odin at Ragnarok -
the ultimate goal of any Norse hero!

@{b}GLORY AND LUCK@{ub}

@{b}Glory@{ub} is the reputation of the hero. It determines who wins the game.

@{b}Luck@{ub} represents the good fortune of the hero. A hero gains luck as the
result of success in combat. Luck may be used to alter combat results (see
@{b}Luck in Combat@{ub}) or to recruit jarls (see @{b}Jarls@{ub}).

The following things will affect glory and luck totals during the game:

@{b}Slaying Monsters.@{ub} Each time a hero or the jarls of a hero
slay a monster, the hero gets either a certain number of glory points or a
certain number of luck points, according to the following table:

    @{u}Monster        Glory   Luck@{uu}
    Dragon           6       5
    Drow             3       2
    Ghost            2       2
    Giant            4       3
    Troll            3       3
    Witch            5       4

@{b}Slaying Other Heroes or Jarls.@{ub} When a hero and his jarls (or
either alone) slay another hero or jarl, the hero receives glory or luck
equal to one-half the combat factor of the hero or jarl(s) slain
rounding down. For example, if Siegfried (5-4) slays Ivar (4-2), Siegfried
has the option of taking 2 points of luck or 2 points of glory. He may not
take 1 of each.

@{b}Wounding Monsters, Jarls, or Heroes.@{ub} One-half of the luck or glory points
(rouded down) that would be gained for slaying these counters are gained
for wounding them. For example, if Siegfried only wounded Ivar, he would
be able to gain only 1 point of luck or 1 point of glory. Someone wounding
a dragon would be able to choose between 3 points of glory and 2 points of
luck.

@{b}Fleeing Battle.@{ub} Every time hero is forced to flee a battle (by combat
result or magical spell), that hero loses 2 points of glory.

@{b}Recruiting Jarls.@{ub} Each jarl recruited by the hero is worth (at the time of
recruitment) one-half his combat factor (rounding down) in either luck or
glory. For example, if the jarl Bjarki (3-3) is recruited by a hero, that
hero may select from 1 point of luck or 1 point of glory. Each jarl that
is slain while in the service of the hero removes from that hero either
luck or glory equal to one-half the jarl's combat factor (player's
choice - does not have to be what was gained when the jarl was recruited).
At the end of the game, each jarl is worth, in glory, an additional one-
half (rounding down) of his combat factor to the hero he is serving. Thus
if Bjarki is one of Beowulf's jarls at the end of the game, he is worth 1
point of glory to Beowulf.

Note that a hero must always expend a point of luck to recruit a jarl.

@{b}Gaining Gold and Luck.@{ub} At the end of the game, gold and luck are converted
to glory points. Every 10 gold marks in the hero's hoard is worth 1 point
of glory, and every 3 points of luck remaining to the hero are worth 1
point of glory.

@{b}SET UP@{ub}

Divide the counters into four piles, keeping the heroes separate. The four
piles, all face down, should be: monsters of all sorts, jarls, magic
weapons, and magic treasures.

Each player picks a hero counter to represent him in the game. Players
roll dice if two or more people want the same counter, and high roll
chooses first. Each player then picks a magic sword at random from the
face-down pile. Magic swords will not be given out again in the game and
so all of the left-over magic swords are put aside until the next game.

A number of monster counters equal to the number of players in the game is
picked at random from the face-down pile of monsters. For each monster
roll two dice, and place that monster in the area indicated (for example,
if the dice rolled came up 3 and 5, the monster would be put in the area
numbered 3:5, which is Rhineland). Monsters are placed on the board face
up.

A number of jarl counters equal to the number of players in the game is
picked at random from the pile of jarls and placed face down in random
countries by rolling two dice for each jarl counter in the same manner
that the monsters were placed. More than one jarl and/or monster may be
placed in the same area.

Heroes begin the game in a randomly determined area (found in the same
manner as monsters are placed). This area should be noted on the record
sheet, as it is sometimes necessary to know a hero's home country.

Each player should have a record sheet similar to that included in the
rules. Permission to photocopy the sample records sheet for personal use
in playing this game is granted by TSR. On this sheet the player keeps
track of the hero's wealth, glory, and luck. Each player begins the game
with three points of luck but no glory or wealth. All of these amounts
will change as the game progresses, but none may ever go below zero.

@{b}SEQUENCE OF PLAY@{ub}

  1. @{b}Movement.@{ub} All heroes and jarls move. The hero with the most glory and
     his or her jarls move first. In cases of ties the heroes roll dice to
     see who goes first, with the highest roll going first.

  2. @{b}Combat and Jarls.@{ub} Combat occurs in the same sequence as movement;
     jarls are recruited after combat.

  3. @{b}Kingdoms and Taxes.@{ub} Heroes and jarls collect taxes from the areas in
     the heroes' kingdom (if any).

  4. @{b}Place Monsters.@{ub} A number of monsters equal to the number of heroes in
     play are randomly placed face up by rolling two dice and placing the
     monster in the area indicated. (This is done every turn until all
     counters are used. "Dead" monsters may not be reused.)

  5. @{b}Place Jarls.@{ub} A number of jarls equal to the number of heroes
     in play are randomly placed face down by rolling two dice and placing
     the jarl in the area indicated. (This is done every turn until all
     counters are used. "Dead" jarls may not be reused.)

  6. @{b}Mark Turn.@{ub} One turn is marked off. At the end of the 20th
     turn the game is over and players total their glory to determine who
     has won.

@{b}MOVEMENT@{ub}

A counter may move as many areas as its movement factor. Each area is
defined by colour or, in the case of sea areas, by dividing lines.
Counters may move and remain in sea areas just as if they were on land.
There is no difference between land movement and sea movement.

Movement is always voluntary, except for certain combat results. Counters
do not have to move their full movement rate, and may thus choose to move
any amount from zero to their total movement. All or none of a player's
counters (hero and jarls) may move.

As long as a counter is moving it may ignore all other counters. Thus a
counter representing a hero could pass through areas containing other
heroes, monsters, and jarls without having to fight or otherwise interact
with any of them. When a counter chooses to fight it ends its movement for
the turn.

Counters may move from one area to any adjacent area, even if the second
area is adjacent only by a corner.

A counter's movement may be affected by magical treasure or the gods.

@{b}COMBAT@{ub}

Combat may only be conducted between counters in the same area. Combat is
resolved using the following procedure.

 1. Determine the attacker(s) and defender(s).

 2. Roll for drow, witch, or ghost magic spells (if applicable).

 3. Modify the die roll with luck.

 4. Total all modifiers to combat (runes, gods, spells, magic items, and
    luck).

 5. Roll one die and check the @{b}Combat Results Table@{ub} to determine the
    outcome of the battle after adding all modifiers to the die roll.

 6. Apply the combat result.

 7. Check to see if a god noticed the battle (optional).

A more complete explanation of each step is given below.

 1. @{b}Determine the attacker and defender.@{ub} Combat occurs in the same order
    as movement (descending order of glory points as totalled at the
    beginning of each turn). The person whose turn it is is automatically
    considered the attacker, while those being attacked are considered the
    defenders. Combat must be handled one area at a time. The order of
    areas, however, is at the discretion of the attacker.

    Heroes @{i}must@{ui} attack at least one monster (if there is a monster) in the
    area they are in during the combat portion of the turn. If there is
    more than one monster they may choose which one they wish to fight.
    They may attack more than one monster in an area.

    Heroes may also attack other heroes and jarls, in which case the
    defending hero or jarl may call for aid to any other counters in the
    area which are controlled by the same player. The attacker must then
    attack not only the first counter but all of the counters who have
    come to the aid of the first counter attacked as well.

    Heroes may also attack areas, using the area's tax factor as a combat
    strength. This is detailed more fully under @{b}Kingdoms and Taxes@{ub}.

    Heroes may attack any combination of the above. Any counter may be
    attacked any number of times by other counters, with the limitation
    that each counter may attack @{i}only once@{ui} in a combat turn.

 2. @{b}Roll for drow, witch, or ghost magic spells (if applicable).@{ub} Drow,
    witch, and ghost monster counters have the use of magic spells. These
    spells take effect before the combat die roll and may modify the
    results of the combat. Ghosts will only use a spell if they roll a 1,
    2, or 3, in which case they will cast the spell with that number. Drow
    (evil dark elves) will roll a die and cast the spell having the number
    that is rolled. Witches will roll two dice and cast two spells, one
    with each of the numbers rolled. If the same spell is indicated on
    each die, it will be cast twice (and the effect applied twice). The
    spells will be explained later in the @{b}Modifiers to Combat@{ub} section.

 3. @{b}Modify the die roll with luck.@{ub} Before the die is rolled, heroes who
    are involved in the battle (or who have jarls involved in the battle)
    may modify the die roll up or down one with each point of luck
    expended before the die is rolled. If there are two or more heroes
    involved in the battle they should each write how much luck they are
    using to modify the die roll and how before revealing the amounts
    simultaneously.

 4. @{b}Total all modifiers to combat (runes, gods, magic items, spells and
    luck).@{ub} Runes are learned the first time a hero slays a drow, witch or
    ghost. Each hero may learn only one run. The rune learned may have an
    effect upon combat. All runs are explained more fully under @{b}Runes@{ub}.

    Gods sometimes notice the struggles of men and intervene in them. A
    god's intervention will not change the result of a magic spell. The
    specifics of notice and intervention are covered more fully in the
    section of @{b}Gods@{ub}. Usually intervention occurs in the form of additions
    or subtractions to or from the combat strength of one side or the
    other in battle.

    Magic items may add to either side's combat strength on either attack
    or defence; this is explained more fully under @{b}Magic Items@{ub}.

    Spells and luck are as above.

 5. @{b}Roll one die and check the Combat Results Table to determine the
    outcome of the battle after adding all modifiers to the die roll.@{ub} After
    all modifications to the combat strengths of both sides have been
    made, subtract the defender's strength from the attacker's and consult
    the @{b}Combat Results Table@{ub} below to determine the results according to a
    die roll and modifications due to luck.

 6. @{b}Apply the combat result.@{ub}

    ATTACKER KILLED. Remove the counter(s) representing the attacker from
    the board. They will not return.

    ATTACKER WOUNDED. Heroes on the attacking side are wounded. Jarls on
    the attacking side are removed from the board and placed, upside down,
    in their pile, from which they will reenter play normally. There is no
    further effect from being wounded, except that jarls that reenter play
    after being wounded are considered unrecruited jarls.

    ATTACKER FLEES. The attacker must immediately move away from the
    defender at maximum speed in the direction of the defender's choice.
    If the defender is not a player in the game, the attacker must move
    toward the hero's home country. If the attacker is in the hero's home
    country the next player to attack may move the attacker's counters in
    any direction he wishes.

    NO RESULT. The fight breaks off without definite decision. All
    counters remain in the area.

    DEFENDER FLEES. The defender must immediately move its maximum
    movement away from the attacker in the direction the attacker
    indicates.

    DEFENDER WOUNDED. Heroes on the defending side are wounded. Jarls and
    monsters on the defending side are removed from the board and placed
    in their respective piles. They will reenter play normally.

    DEFENDER KILLED. Remove the counter(s) representing the defender from
    the board. They will not return.

 6. @{b}Check to see if a god noticed the battle (optional).@{ub} Each player
    involved in a battle may roll one die to see if the battle was noticed
    by a god. If the player rolls a 1 (a 1 or 2 if the player's hero has
    the rune Amsir and was involved in the battle), the battle was
    noticed. Effects of the gods noticing a battle are covered more fully
    in the section titled @{b}Gods@{ub}.

@{b}MODIFIERS TO COMBAT@{ub}

@{b}Spells.@{ub} Spells are rolled for on the following table:

 1. HAGALL - This spell brings down hail and reduces the combat factor of
    each counter in the area (including the caster) by one for the rest of
    the turn. It also prevents any of the counters from moving by sea next
    turn.

 2. IS - This spell covers the land with ice making it impossible for any
    hero to found, or continue to have a kingdom in the country. The
    players should note this fact for the future.

 3. JARA - All in the area lose their next turn.

 4. NIED - This spell works if the person it is cast against rolls a 1, 2,
    or 3 on a die. It makes the combat result an automatic "no result" and
    causes all in the area to lose one turn.

 5. WYNN - This spell works if the person whose counter(s) it is cast upon
    rolls a 1, 2, or 3 on a die. It forces all of the heroes and jarls to
    move as far as they can toward the hero's starting country. The hero
    and jarls may not attack anything that turn.

 6. YR - This spell works if the person it is cast against rolls a 1, 2,
    or 3 on a die. It causes all counters in the area (except face down
    jarls or monster counters) to be wounded.

@{b}Luck in Combat.@{ub} A hero may change any combat die roll which involves the
hero or any of his or her jarls. This is done by expending 1 point of luck
for every 1 that the hero wishes to change the number rolled. Luck must be
allocated for this purpose before the die is rolled, and is lost even if
the addition or subtraction made no difference.

When a player recruits a jarl, he must expend 1 point of luck to
successfully convince the jarl to join him. If the point of luck is not
expended, the jarl will suffer the actual combat result indicated by the
attempt to recruit him (see @{b}Jarls@{ub}).

@{b}Magic Swords@{ub}. There are several magic swords in the game. Many
heroes of the sagas got their start by obtaining a magic sword. The swords
available for use in the game are:

    BALMUNG - This sword adds +1 to the user's combat factor. In any fight
    where its user is attacking an enemy using magic armour it cancels out
    the benefit of the magic armour. Thus, the Mail Coat and the Magic
    Shirt (see @{b}Magic Treasures@{ub}) provide no protection against Balmung.

    DRAGVENDILL - This sword adds +2 to the user's combat factor.

    GRAM - This sword adds +2 to the user's combat factor.

    HRUNTING - This sword adds +1 to the user's combat factor. It also
    gives the user's side the option of making the other side flee when
    the Combat Results Table indicates that the user's side must flee.

    LOVI - This sword adds +1 to the user's combat factor. In any battle
    against a side including jarls, it adds an additional +2 to the combat
    factor.

    TYRFING - This sword adds +2 to the user's combat factor.

Swords may be used by the hero or lent to one of his jarls. If the jarl in
question is wounded or slain, the sword will remain in the area where the
jarl was wounded or slain until someone comes and picks it up (ends their
movement in the area with the sword).

@{b}Other Modifiers@{ub}. Magic Treasures, Runes, and the Gods may also
affect combat. These are explained later in their own sections.

@{b}OPTIONS AFTER COMBAT@{ub}

If a hero is wounded or killed as a result of combat, there are several
options open to him.

If wounded, a hero may heal the wound by spending one turn at rest in the
hero's starting country. Any hero who is wounded while having an unhealed
wound dies. The rune ING allows heroes to heal themselves by remaining at
rest one turn in any area.

If a hero has died, the player may:

 1. Withdraw from play and total up glory, as if the game were over. The
    player then hopes that none of the other players will exceed this
    total in the remaining turns. The amount of glory that the hero ends
    the game with is the amount the hero had when he died.

 2. Restart the hero. A restarted hero gets three points of luck and the
    magic weapon of the old hero, but gets none of the glory, jarls, or
    wealth. (This is an option for the player to begin the game again.)

 3. Transfer all the hero's luck to one of his or her jarls and play that
    jarl as a hero. That jarl counter is thereafter treated as a hero
    counter. This symbolizes the heroic tradition passing from the hero to
    one of his faithful followers. The player loses all accumulated glory
    but keeps luck, jarls, and kingdom, and magic items (subject to the
    item being recovered as in @{b}Magic Swords@{ub}).

@{b}JARLS@{ub}

Heroes had friends and followers who aided them in the slaying of
monsters, the doing of great deeds, and the ruling of their kingdoms.
These men were called jarls (the Norse equivalent of `earl' - pronounced
yarl).

A jarl is recruited by a hero who beats him in combat and then expends a
point of luck. Only jarls may be recruited this way, not monsters or other
heroes. Only jarls that are face down may be recruited.

Jarls are recruited during the combat phase. To recruit a jarl a hero must
first attack the jarl. All jarls are kept face down on the board until
they are attacked. Once a jarl is turned face up, the hero must attack. To
recruit the jarl the hero must obtain a "defender flees", "defender
wounded", or "defender killed" result in combat against the jarl and then
expend one point of luck. The hero must be present in the combat, but may
have the help of other jarls. Combat effects will affect the hero, but not
the jarl unless the hero declines to expend a point of luck, in which case
all effects will be [as] normal.

Jarls who are wounded and removed from the board are considered to be
unrecruited, unwounded jarls when they are returned to play.

Jarls are used by heroes to collect taxes for them (see
@{b}Kingdoms and Taxes@{ub}. If a recruited jarl kills a monster, hero, or jarl
by himself the luck or glory goes to his master. Recruited jarls may add
countries to their hero's kingdom.

No hero may have more than 4 jarls recruited at any one time.

@{b}KINGDOMS AND TAXES@{ub}

A hero may do other things besides fighting with monsters, jarls, and
other heroes. One of the things he or she may do is start a kingdom. Many
famous heroes (such as Beowulf) did so. To start a kingdom the hero moves
himself and/or any controlled jarls into any country that has not had an
IS (ice) spell cast upon it. The player must then successfully attack the
country, using the area's tax factor as a combat factor. Note that a hero
or jarl may want to, or have to, attack other counters in the area on the
same turn that he attacks the country. A successful attack is an attack
that yields a result of "defender flees", "defender wounded", or "defender
killed". If the hero fails the attackers will suffer the adverse result
indicated by the Combat Results Table. The roll represents the necessity
of clearing out bandits, wild beasts, claimants to the throne, and so
forth.

After the hero has set the country in order (the attack is carried out in
the combat portion of the turn and counts as an attack), taxes may be
collected from the country every turn the hero or one of his jarls spends
in the country.

If a country is left for a turn without the hero or one of his jarls in
it, the country is overrun by bandits, wild animals, and other evil
creatures and men, and must be subdued again by a successful attack on the
Combat Results Table.

The hero adds the taxes to his hoard immediately if the hero is in the
area when they are paid. The hero also adds the taxes to his hoard if the
hero's counter moves through the country after the taxes have been paid to
his jarl. A jarl may leave an area and travel to the hero with the taxes
he has collected.

If a jarl is killed after collecting taxes but before the hero has placed
the taxes in his hoard, the killer gets the taxes. If the killer is a jarl
the taxes are not added to his hero's hoard until the hero and the jarl
are in the same area at the same time. Taxes are transferred merely by
placing the counters in the same area at some point during movement.

A hero with taxes who is slain yields no treasure to the slayer.

All taxes are collected in golden marks. The number of golden marks raised
each turn is a number equal to the country's tax factor. Thus Frankland
(8) yields eight gold marks a turn.

@{b}MARK TURN@{ub}

The turn should be marked off on each player's record sheet.

@{b}OTHER INFORMATION@{ub}

@{b}GODS@{ub}

The gods may notice the actions of men. Any time a hero has fought a
battle he or may check to see if the gods have noticed him. On a roll of 1
(1 or 2 if the player has the rune Amsir) the gods have noticed the
battle. The following tables tell which god notices and what the god does.
First roll one die to see which god has noticed:

 1. Frey, god of fertility and life.
 2. Loki, god of luck and of trouble.
 3. Njord, god of wealth and of the sea.
 4. Odin, god of battles and of death.
 5. Thor, god of thunder.
 6. Tyr, god of war and of the sword.

Now roll a second die and check the result with the appropriate god to
determine the result:

    FREY - this god's attention results in his sending magical maidens to
    heal the hero's wounds.
        1-4    Frey will send a maiden to heal the next wound. This
               results in the next wound being healed without the hero
               spending any time resting.
        5-6    Frey will send a maiden to heal the hero's next two wounds.
               The first wound is healed as the above. The second wound
               requires the hero to spend two turns with the maiden
               worshipping Frey (and thus the hero spends two turns not
               moving to heal the second wound). Frey will kill a hero
               who refuses his gift or does not join the maiden to
               worship him.

    LOKI - this god's intervention immediately affects the hero's luck.
        1-3    Loki steals a point of luck from the hero.
        4-6    Loki grants the hero a point of luck for his daring.

    NJORD - this god's notice affects things other than combat. Roll
    immediately upon gaining Njord's attention.
        1-2    Next time the hero moves by sea Njord aids him and the
               entire sea counts as only 1 area for movement purposes.
        3-4    Njord gives 1-6 marks to the hero as a gift.
        5      Njord takes 1-6 marks from the hero's hoard as due tribute.
        6      Njord will kill the hero with sinister sea serpents if he
               travels by sea the next turn (the hero cannot be forced to
               flee by sea as an adverse combat result).

    ODIN - this god's notice affects the hero the @{i}next@{ui} time he fights a
    battle. Roll then to see what Odin does.
        1      Odin decides that the hero is ready for Valhalla and aids
               the hero's enemies by adding 3 to their combat strength.
        2      Odin aids the hero's enemies by sending a wolf, adding 1 to
               their combat factor.
        3      Odin's ravens are sent by him to observe the battle, but
               Odin does nothing.
        4      Odin sends a wolf to aid the hero, adding 1 to his side's
               combat factor.
        5      Odin aids the hero by adding 3 to his side's combat
               strength.
        6      Odin intervenes personally, and adds 5 to the combat
               strength of the hero. The hero also gains 3 points of
               glory.

    THOR - this god's notice takes effect after the result of the hero's
    @{i}next@{ui} battle. Roll then to see what Thor does.

        1-3    Thor decides that the hero deserves no reward.
        4-5    Thor rewards the hero by speaking to him, thus giving 1
               point of glory.
        6      Thor honours the hero by eating with him, thus granting 2
               points of glory.

    TYR - this god's notice affects the hero's @{i}next@{ui} battle. Roll then to
    see what Tyr does.

        1      Tyr aids the hero's enemies by adding 1 to their combat
               strength.
        2-3    Tyr decides that the fight is balanced fairly, and does not
               intervene.
        4      Tyr aids the hero by adding 1 to his side's combat
               strength.
        5      Tyr aids the hero by adding 2 to his side's combat
               strength.
        6      Tyr aids the hero by adding 1 to the combat strength of
               each person on the hero's side.

@{b}MAGIC TREASURES@{ub}

Magic treasures are found with dragons. Each of the first four dragons to
be placed on the board will have a magic treasure. When the dragon
appears, place one of the magic treasure counters under it. The last two
dragons have 20 marks of treasure instead of a magic treasure.

The four magic treasures are:

BROSUNG NECKLACE - This treasure is worth 20 marks. It may be traded for
any item in a dragon's hoard. The wearer of the Brosung Necklace moves
into the area adjacent to that of the dragon, turns the Necklace upside
down, and places it under the dragon while taking what the dragon had. The
wearer may then see what he had traded for. One cannot change one's mind
when dealing with dragons, so there is no altering the exchange once it is
made.

FREY FAXI - This treasure is a magic horse that can be ridden only 3
times. It doubles the rider's movement factor and will carry any number of
riders. After the third use remove the treasure from the board.

MAGIC SHIRT - This treasure is from Ireland. It adds 1 to the combat
strength of the wearer when he is on the side being attacked. The magic
shirt also adds 1 to the movement factor of the person wearing it.

MAIL COAT - This treasure adds 2 to the combat strength of its wearer's
side, but only when the wearer is @{i}defending@{ui}.

All magic treasures are kept face down on the board underneath whoever has
them at the moment. One counter may have any number of magic treasures.

@{b}RUNES@{ub}

When a hero kills a drow, ghost, or witch for the first time he learns a
magic rune. A rune is a poem or song that, when recited, produces some
magical effect. Each hero may learn one, and @{i}only@{ui} one, rune during the
game. To find out which rune the hero has learned the player should roll
on the table below. More than one hero may have the same rune, but no hero
may have more than one rune.

 1. AMSIR - This is the rune of the gods. A hero with this rune has twice
    the chance of having the gods notice him or her (the gods notice on a
    roll of 1 or 2 instead of just a roll of 1).

 2. EON - This is the rune of time. A hero with this rune has a movement
    factor one greater than the factor printed on his counter.

 3. GEOFU - This is the rune of gifts and property. The hero with this
    rune will have all the areas in his kingdom yield one additional mark
    over and above the tax factor each turn.

 4. ING - This is the rune of healing and fertility. A hero who has this
    rune can heal his wounds by spending one turn anywhere at rest instead
    of having to return to his starting country.

 5. OGAL - This is the rune of beserk fury. A hero who has this rune has a
    combat factor one greater than the factor printed on his counter.

 6. SYGIL - This is the rune of the sun. It is useful against evil magic
    spells. Every time a spell is cast at the hero who has this rune, the
    hero rolls a die. If the hero rolls a 1, 2, or 3 the spell does not
    affect the hero (although it may affect those in the same area with
    him).

Runes are assumed to be in effect at all times unless the player
specifically states otherwise.
