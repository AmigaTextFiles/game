A new idea behind a wellknown game. Everyone knows OTHELLO,
better known as REVERSI. Dozens of more or less excellent
computer conversions of that game exist already.

The principle is easy:
The players alternating place a piece of their color. This
presumes that the pieces of their opponent are enclosed by own
pieces. The oppenent pieces then take over the color of the
actual player. The player with the most pieces at the end of a
game is the winner.

So far - so good. Of course does this ROTHELLO, too. But here are
the good news: as the name indicates are with ROTHELLO not only
pieces to be set, but whole rows or columns can be rotated resp.
shifted! Therefor corresponding arrows are located around the 8x8
playfield. Are there located in a row/column minimum 4 pieces of
different colors this row/column may be shifted in the direction
the arrow shows for one position. Pieces that leave the playfield
at one end enter it at the opposite side. Be careful! According
to the new positions of the pieces within the row/column the
whole playfield with the exception of the shifted row/column is
recalculated. This can lead to a totally new situation. Use your
shifts with care, you have only five of them during a game.

The game is completly operated with the mouse. Before the start
of a game you choose with a appropriate gadget whether to play
against a human opponent "HUMAN VS. HUMAN" or agains the computer
"HUMAN VS. AMIGA". Then you decide whom to begin "Player 1/2
begins" resp. "HUMAN/AMIGA begins". During the game the name of
the active player is written in the color of his pieces (orange
resp. blue) in the display area in the upper right corner. You
place a piece by clicking in a field of your choice. If any of
the surrounding arrows are colored green after placing a piece
one of corresponding rows/columns may be shifted. Therefor you
first click the gadget "MAKE A SHIFT" then the arrow. Don´t you
want to or is there nothing to shift the game is handed over to
the opponent by clicking the "NEXT PLAYER"-Gadget.

The actual game may be ended at any time by chosing the "QUIT"-
Gadget. Now you have the choice to start a "NEW GAME" or to leave
the program by "QUIT ROTHELLO".


The game is programmed and compiled with GFA-BASIC. We hope you
have fun with it. If you have any comments or suggestions to it,
please feel free to send us a note.
