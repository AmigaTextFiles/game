Prolog

     A little while ago one of my room-mates got interested in Solitaire
Royal, and in learning how to play the various games included in that
package he revealed to me a solitaire game which was taught to him by his
grandfather. I challenged him to write this game for the Amiga, a fairly
simple task, and he accepted. Unfortunately he never got around to finally
writing the program, and so in a fit of homework avoidance I decided to
get it done.

     Two days later, here it is.

The Program

     Seeing as my room-mate doesn't know the actual name for this kind of
solitaire, it seemed fitting that we call it simply SolitaireX. The rules
are simple. An initial hand is dealt consisting of 4 rows of 52 cards (the
entire deck). The aces are then removed.

     The idea is to resolve each of the four rows into ascending order.
Staring with 2's in the leftmost column, and proceeding to kings in the
right (but one) most column.  This is acheived by moving cards according
to 3 rules;

     1) A blank square may be filled only with a card of the same suit
        and value one greater than the card to the left of the blank
     2) The leftmost blanks may be filled with any two
     3) No card may be placed in a blank, next to a king (as there is
        no card of higher value)

     Once you have run out of moves, cards which are 'well placed'
(ie: starting from a two in the leftmost column, and proceeding in the
same suit, in ascending order) are left on the tableau, and all other
cards are reshuffled and re-dealt. When re-dealing, blanks are left
immediately to the left of the 'well placed' cards, or in the left-most
column, whichever is appropriate.  Three shuffles are allowed (the
initial deal counting as one).

Computerization

     As in colourization, computerization of traditional games always
involves enhancements.  In this case there are a range of options
available along the bottom of the display, and a 'keen' user interface
for playing the game.

Movement

     After the cards are dealt, all possible moves are shown by a
pulsing green box around cards which may be moved. To move a
particular card simply point to it with the mouse and click on it,
the card will move into the correct blank area, and the new possible
moves will be highlighted.

     When moving twos into the left-most column, it is possible that
more than one blank space will be available. In this case, after
clicking on the two, the various blank spaces will be highlighted.
Select the destination for the two you have chosen by clicking in the
correct box. Any illegal click at this point will cancel the move.

Reshuffling

     Once you have decided that you can make no more useful moves, or
there are no more moves you can make, click on the reshuffle button at
the bottem of the screen. This will collect all the unplaced cards,
reshuffle, and redeal them.

Backing Up

     For all of us who make spontaneous (and often stupid) moves, the
backup button allows a quick fix. You can backup all the way to the
beginning of a game (including backing up through shuffles) by repeated
use of this button.

Tournaments

     For those of us with a competetive edge, the tournament mode
allows playing the game over again with the same deck of cards, and
the same shuffles (throughout). To use this mode click on tournament
before makeing ANY moves.  The backup option will become ghosted as
this feature is not allowed during tournament play (can't make it
too easy can we?).  To switch to a new player (ie start over) click
on the tournament icon again.  Tournament mode keeps track of the
highest score achieved during the present tournament.  Any number
of players may continue with the same set of cards by repeated use
of the Tournament button.


Starting Over

     If you have completed a game, or wish to forget about the mess
you've made of your present game, and just want a new set of cards,
click on the Restart button. This button may also be used to exit
the Tournament mode.

Exiting

     That subtle button labeled 'Quit', will perform the intuitively
obvious function of exiting the code, freeing up all resources as it
goes.

Copyright et al...

     The imagery for the cards was taken from the program 'Spades'
which was written by Gregory M. Stelmack.  While this program
prefers to find it's cards in the file 'Cards.images', it will also
quite happily load them from 'Spades.images' as provided with the
Spades program. In this way if the two programs co-exist in the
same directory, they can share the image files, thus saving ~40k
of storage.

     The program for 'SolitaireX' was written entirely by myself
Stephen Orr, and as such it's source is the sole property of my
company, SandIsoft.  The binary, however is released as FreeWare,
I retain the rights, but allow free copying and distribution
except where such would infringe upon my rights as described
above.  Anybody attempting to make more than copying charges from
the ditribution of this program should be shot.  Let that be the
end of it.
