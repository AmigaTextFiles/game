<H2>About the Game</H2>

<P>Sudoku (pronounced soo-dough-coo with the emphasis on the
first syllable) is a simple number-based puzzle/game played on a
9x9 grid that is divided into 3x3 subgrids. The goal is to enter
a number from 1 to 9 in each cell so that each number appears
only once in each column and row. In addition, each 3x3 subgrid
may only contain one of each number.</P>

<H2>How to Play the Game</H2>

<P>At the start of a new game, Sudoku fills in a random selection
of cells for you - the number of cells depends on the difficulty
level you use. Click in any of the empty cells or use the arrow
keys to highlight individual cells and press a number from 1 to 9
to fill in the cell. To clear a cell, press 0, Delete, or
Backspace. When you have successfully completed all subgrids, the
entire puzzle is highlighted in green until you start a new
game.</P>

<P>As you work to complete the puzzle, you can display possible
solutions inside each cell by holding the Shift key and pressing
each number in turn. Repeat the process to remove individual
numbers, or press a number without the Shift key to replace them
with the actual number to use.</P>
