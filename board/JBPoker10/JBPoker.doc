                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     V1.0 was written in AMOS May 1991. This program is dedicated to the
  FAIL grade I recieved because I was writing this instead of studying for
  a University of Wollongong test on integral calculus.

   "JB Poker" was designed to emulate the poker-playing machines commonly
seen in pubs. You could appreciate the difficulty of trying to copy something
you have never actually seen. All I know of these machines was told to me by
a friend, whose ability to poke coins into slot machines at a rate of $10 per
60 seconds is legendary. Understandably, this made him somewhat unpopular
with his parents (the rightful earners of the money), so he suggested I write
a program that had the same effect on his small brain as the real thing, but
cost considerably less to run than the price of an A500 every hour. Within
24 hours Poker had emerged (gripping stuff!). His initials (J.B.) were added
to distinguish the game from the hundred other Poker games around.

   Over the next week a string of add-ons were suggested, such as "what about
a title across the top with flashing lights and stuff","where's the music",
etc. By July 1991, it became the horrible apparition you see now.
   Anyway, that's how it happened.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PEOPLE WHO READ THE FIRST 5 WORDS AND THEN STOPPED READING - YOU CAN START
                             READING AGAIN HERE!

   After the prog has loaded and given a short introduction, the Poker screen
will appear. There is a playing area (covered in green felt, of course), a
control panel with four buttons, the area where your money is displayed at
the bottom, and the pointer hand, which can be moved using the mouse. 
   If there is a saved game on the disk, You will be asked whether you want
to start a new game with ten dollars, or load the saved amount from disk.
Just click on the appropriately coloured button to continue. I'll assume you
are starting a new game.
   You will be given ten $1 coins (we're in the big time now remember!) By
clicking on the bottom of the screen, these can be picked up with the mouse,
a la Dungeon Master. You can enter from 1 to 5 credits into the slot at the
right. Pressing the coin reject button under the money slot will eject the
coins.
   Press the DEAL button and you will be dealt five cards. You can turn over 
any of the cards by clicking on them. Press DEAL again and the upside-down
cards will be replaced with new cards from the deck. Your hand will then be
checked for winning combinations.
   Good hands will give you a multiple of your credits:

         Rubbish cards .................... you lose your credits.
         One pair, of 2's to 10's ......... you lose your credits.
         One pair, of J,Q,K or A .......... you keep your credits.
         Two pairs ...................... you double your credits. 
         Three of a kind ........... you get 5 times your credits.
         Straight .................. you get 8 times your credits.
         Flush .................... you get 12 times your credits.
         Full house ............... you get 25 times your credits.
         Four of a kind ........... you get 50 times your credits.
         Straight flush ........... you get 75 times your credits.
         Royal flush ............. you get 100 times your credits.

   If you do not lose your credits, you will be given a chance to gamble
your winnings. To gamble, press either the red or black button. The cards
will be shuffled and a random card dealt. If the card is the same colour
as the button you picked, your credits will be doubled. If not, all your
credits will be lost. This can be repeated as many times as you dare. If you
want to stop betting, or don't want to bet, press the DEAL button. All your
credits in excess of 5 will then be chucked out of the machine.
   When you press the QUIT button (you cannot do this in the middle of
a hand) the prog will ask you if you want to save your money. If you save,
your money will be saved on the system (boot-up) disk, so make sure it is
unprotected.
   There are also several short-cuts to speed up the game. The right
mouse button emulates the DEAL button when starting a new hand or after
selecting cards, and, when entering credits, picking up a coin and pressing
the right mouse button will put it into the machine. (To enter credits
quickly move the mouse over the credits and press the left and right buttons
alternately, press the right button twice in a row to deal.) For those who
prefer keyboard commands:

	        F1-F5 .... enter that number of credits
	        Return .................... DEAL button
	        F1-F5 ............... flip cards 1 to 5
	        Left shift ............... Black button
	        Right shift ................ Red button
	        F9 ....................... Music on/off
	        F10 ....................... QUIT button
