The following steps are listed by priority:

Control:
1. Factor out player, create a generic interface (probably callback)
   Mouse Player, Keyboard Player
2. Create an option panel for player/gfx control

Graphics:
1. Accept different screen sizes (crop fields, resize fonts)
2. Highlight fields that can be set (using alpha?)
3. Fullscreen option
4. Use alpha effect for coloring fields (shave 24k off)
5. Optionally use SDL_image and jpgs (to make the download smaller)

Network:
1. Accept network players (using generic interface)
   inet.h or SDL_net? Use TCP/IP with small ascii protocol
2. Create a no-graphics server

AI:
1. Create stupid computer opponents (using generic interface)
2. Create brute force minimax opponent using score as rating
3. Try out more complex rating function

Saving and Loading, Replay:
