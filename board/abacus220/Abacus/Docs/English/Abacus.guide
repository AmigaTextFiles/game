              Abacus an Amiga implementation of 'Abalone' - a board game
              for one or two player.

              It is played on a hexagonal board. Each player starts up with
              14 marbles, and the goal is to kick the enemy marbles off the
              board. The game is over when a player lost 6 of his marbles,

              Abacus runs on the Workbench, has got an install-script and
              is localized to English and German.

              This program is FREEWARE.

@{b}Requirements@{ub}  To play Abacus you need:

              * Amiga with Kickstart 2.0 or higher (Kick 2.1 for german
                catalog)
              * Installed @{"MUI-System" link "MUI"} Version 3.6 or higher

@node "INSTALLATION" "Installation"
                                  @{u}@{b}Installation@{ub}@{uu}


@{b}Automatic@{ub}      The best way to get Abacus installed is to start the script
               "Abacus-Install". Don't panic: No files will be copied into
               your holy system directories!

               You can start Abacus after the installation just by clicking
               its icon from the workbench.

@{b}By hand@{ub}        If the script does not work because you do not have Installer,
               just drag the "Abacus" drawer somewhere to your harddisk.
               Then take the "Abacus.guide" of your preferred language from
               "Abacus/Docs/<lang>/" and move it to the "Abacus/" drawer so
               that it can be used for online help.

@{b}Deinstallation@{ub} Just delete the Abacus drawer. Thst's all.

@node "RULES" "Playing rules"
                                   @{u}@{b}Playing rules@{ub}@{uu}


@{b}Idea@{ub}           The game Abacus is played by two players on a hexagonal
               board. Each player starts up with 14 marbles and the goal is
               to kick the enemy marbles off the board. If a player lost 6
               of his marbles he lost the game.

@{b}Moves@{ub}          What the players have to do is to push one of their marbles
               by turns. A marble can be pushed from its place to one of the
               six neighbour places.
               When the destination place is occupied by another marble,
               that marble gets pushed into the same direction and so on.
               This way you can push not only one but a row of marbles at
               once - and if a marble is pushed over the board limits it
               gets lost.

               But not all kinds of moves are allowed! To push marbles of
               the opponent, you got to have the majority of marbles in this
               move. You are only allowed to push maximal three of your own
               marbles at once, which also means that the number of pushed
               enemy marbles is limited to two. The color of the marbles in
               a row may not be mixed. First place have to be the marbles of
               the active player followed by the marbles of the opponent.

               The following list shows all possible moves. "X" marks a ball
               of the active player and "O" a ball of the opponent. "." is
               an empty place or a place outside the board. The push-
               direction is alway from left to right:

               @{u}Right@{uu}

                 X .

                 X X .

                 X X X .

                 X X O .

                 X X X O .

                 X X X O O .

               @{u}Wrong@{uu}

                 X O .                ( no majority )

                 X X O O .            ( no majority )

                 X X X O O O .        ( no majority )

                 X X X X .            ( more than three own balls )

                 X X O X .            ( mixed ball order )

                 X X X O O X .        ( mixed ball order )

@{b}Broadway moves@{ub} Despite the moves mentiones above, you may also move a row
               of two or three of your marbles "broadway". That means that
               they are moved all together left or right, instead of a
               straight forward push direction.
               The destination fields have to be empty, and you cannot push
               enemy marbles with broadway moves.

@{b}Game board@{ub}     On the left there is the game board. The small circles on
               the right indicate the number of marbles from each color that
               have been kicked out yet.

               To select a marble just click on it. To select more than one
               marble click on the first one, hold the mouse botton pressed
               and release it over the last one. All selected marbles will
               be marked, if the selection is according to the rules.
               To take back a selection just click on one of the selected
               marbles once again.

               To move a selected marble, click on that neighbour field you
               want to move the marble to. If the move is not against the
               rules, the move gets executed and the next player is on turn.

@{b}Player display@{ub} On the right side of the window is a display that shows
               the names and colors of both player. The name of the player,
               that is expected to do his move, is marked.

@{b}MUI in Abacus@{ub} Abacus needs MUI 3.6 or higher to be installed. You are
              allowed to use MUI @{b}without@{ub} registering for it - but
              when you register you can take advantage of some extended
              functions in the MUI preferences. It is very recommended to
              read the MUI documentation carefully - especially of the MUI
              preferences. Despite that I would like to show you in the
              following list @{i}some@{ui} advantages of MUI-programs that
              could be useful using Abacus:

              If you want Abacus to work on an own @{b}screen@{ub} and not
              on the Workbench then simply configure Abacus with the MUI
              preferences to use any screen you like.

              Windows of MUI applications are @{b}resizeable@{ub} and
              completely @{b}fontsensitive@{ub} what means, that they look
              fine with every font.

              MUI applications may be @{b}iconified@{ub} at every time with
              an extra-gadget in the windows title bar.

              MUI applications are known to the system as @{b}commodities@{ub}
              and can so be handled with the commodity-exchange program.
