@node "intro" "I.Introduction"

 WBWort is a game of spelling words, like Scrabble.
 Most functions are easy to understand, so you won't have to 
 read the whole guide. 

 @{i}Don't say does not look nice, until you've tried
 the new preferences option! @{ui} ;)
 
 That' all you need to know, I think...

 As long as this copy is unregistered some boring requesters
 will appear (To stop this ... @{"register" link "regis"}). This is
 no cripple-ware, there are no limitations on unregistered versions.

 If you have any problems with this piece of software or if you
 find any bugs, write to this address ----> @{"author" link "autho"}.

 You don't have to register for this, but I've spent so much time
 on this program... I think it's worth some money.

 Enjoy it!

 @{b}REQUIREMENTS:@{ub}

 Kick 3.x
 68020 or better recommended for using computer opponent. 
 
 The Vocabulary Editor needs @{"MUI" link VocEd.guide/MUI}. 

@endnode

@node "distr" "II. Distribution"

 This game is SHAREWARE! If you like it please @{"register" link "regis"}.
 COPYRIGHT 1999 by Oliver Lüthje. 

 You may copy this as long as all parts of the archive stay intact,
 together and unchanged. If you want to add it to a shareware 
 collection please inform me (@{"author" link "autho"}).
 
 IMPORTANT: I don't take responsibility for damage or problems, 
 this software may cause.

@endnode

@node "insta" "III.Installation" 

 To install WBWort, just extract the archive.

 That's all...

@endnode

@node "instr" "IV.Instructions"

 @{b} Starting WBWort @{ub}

 WBWort will try to open it's windows on the workbench. 
 If this is impossible, you may start with 'emergency preferences', 
 which means that WBW starts on an hires-laced screen 
 and uses topaz.font (size 8 pixels). 

 Then you can change the @{"display preferences" link "prefs"}.

 @{b} Starting a new game @{ub}

 Pick the menu game/new to start a new game. A @{"game preferences" link "gameprefs"}
 requester will appear. Choose your opponent and language  and 
 click on the ok-button.

 Both players get eight letters, the player with the lowest first letter 
 begins. Click on your letters to choose one, it moves to the right,
 then you can place it at another position in your set of letters or on the
 field. 

 The first letter must also be the first letter of the word you
 want to place on the board. Following letters must be placed one by one
 to the right of or below this starting point.

 If you have finished your turn, click on the symbol right under your
 name. If you can't spell any word choose the menu turn/pass, or exchange
 some of your letters with turn/change.

 If you don't want to play anymore, select Game/quit, do not turn
 your computer off, or no changes will be saved.

@endnode

@node "rules" "V.Rules""

 Each player gets eight letters. The player with the lowest first letter starts.
 He if he can build a word with his letters, he puts them down on the
 field including the center field. Next player's free to place his word
 anywhere on the field, but it must have contact to another word. If
 his word builds a new word by extending an already placed word, both words
 count as new words. All letters count different points. If they're placed
 on fields labeld '2*B' or '3*B' they're points will be multiplied by 2 or 3.
 'x*W' Fields mean that the points of the whole word will be multiplied.
 Blank letters can be used as a 'joker' for any letter, but they don't count
 any points.

 If a player can use all eight letters, while there are still new ones
 available, he get's 50 extra points.

 You can exchange a blank, that is already placed on the board, with the
 letter, for which it stands. To do this, select this letter and then
 click on the blank.
 
@endnode

@node "extra" "VI.Extras"

 1. Statistics
 If you pick the menu Info/Statistics, you can see who has
 placed the longest word and so on. Passing and exchanging letters
 count as 0 points, exchanging a blank does not count for the
 statistics. Choose the diagram to see the development through
 the whole game.

 2. Save ASCII-FILE
 This function will create an ASCII-file of the current situation,
 it' quite useless, but perhaps you're so proud of the game, that
 you want to print it. Of course you can't reload these files
 as saved games.

 3. Vocabulary Editor <VocEd>
 To remove words from the vocabulary or to type in new ones,
 use the Vocabulary Editor by @{"Sascha Werth" link "sascha"}.
 You can click on words to change them or add new ones by typing
 them into the input line. 

 @{b}You can't change the vocabulary, while WBWort is running!@{ub}

 WBW saves the vocabulary if you quit, your changes, made with VocEd
 will be overwritten.

 See @{"VocEd.guide" link VocEd.guide/main} for more information.

 I'm not rich too.

 The preferences requester:

 @{b}1. Computer opponent @{ub}

 The normal computer opponent tries to get the highest
 score out of a turn, the <easy> opponent tries to place
 the longest word.

 @{b}2. Minimum length @{ub}

 Some people play this game without words of two letters.

 @{b}3. Letter distribution and vocabulary @{ub}

 Select the distribution used in your country and
 a vocabulary of your language.
 By now, english, german, swedish and french are available,
 other languages will be added.

@endnode

@node "prefs" "Display Preferences"

 @{b}Graphics  @{ub

   - You may change the whole look of the board and letters
     here. Each graphics set is represented by one file in
     the 'WBWort/Des' directory. The name of the selected
     file, a short descripton and a preview is displayed.
     Some graphic sets are too large for small screens (e.g.
     'newton.des'. WBW will have problems if you select
     a small screen but large graphics. See @{"Problems with Prefs" link emergency} 
     for more information. 

  -  If you want to know more about the new graphic files 
     or draw an own one, click here: @{"Graphic files" link graphics}.
 
 @{b}Fonts  @{ub}

  -  You can change the two fonts WBW uses.

      The @{b}Gadget Font@{ub} is used for all Gadgets (Buttons,
      Cycles, String input etc.)

      The @{b}Text@{ub} is used for all text display (labels etc.)

     WBW will have problems if you select a small screen but
     large fonts. See @{"Problems with Prefs" link emergency} for more 
     information. 

 @{b}Extras @{ub} (Flags)

  - With the checkboxes you can control WBW's behavior:

    - @{b}All player buttons@{ub}: If this mode is on, the player
      window is opened with three buttons: [ok], [pass] and [take back].
      If it's off, only the 'ok' button will appear.
      (@{i} default: on @{ui})

    - @{b}Show opponents letters@{ub}: If you want to get a smaller
      players window, turn this mode off. This means that the computer
      player's letters are hidden constantly.
      (@{i} default: on @{ui})

    - @{b}All graphics & animations@{ub}: If this mode is on
      most requesters show little images. You may turn this off
      to save memory or space on the screen.
      (@{i} default: on @{ui})

    - @{b}Open all windows at start@{ub}: If this mode is on,
      WBW opens all three windows (players data, letters and board)
      at start.
      (@{i} default: off @{ui})

    - @{b}Print points on letters@{ub}: If you use a very small graphic
      set (e.g. 'mini.des'), the numbers on the letters are nearly
      unreadable (with 'mini.des' they're displayed in binary code). So
      turn them off, if you want.
      (@{i} default: on @{ui})

 @{b}Screenmode @{ub}

  - If you want to play WBW on an own screen, click on @{b}"Select"@{ub}.
    To use the workbench screen, click on @{b}"Use Workbench"@{ub}.

    WBW will have problems if you select a small screen but
    large fonts or graphics. See @{"Problems with Prefs" link emergency} for
    more information. 

 @{b}Learning mode  @{ub}

  - You can choose among:

    - @{b}Always learn@{ub}: Which means that all words you place on the
      board, which are not part of the vocabulary at the moment, are
      added to it.

    - @{b}Ask to learn@{ub}: Which means that will a requester appears for 
      each new word and you can select, if it should be added or not.

    - @{b}Never learn@{ub}: No words will be added to the vocabulary.

 @{b}Window positions@{ub}

  - If you select 'Save&Use' all preferences and the window positions
    will be saved.

@endnode

@node emergency "Problems with the preferences"

  @{b}Problems with preferences@{ub}

  ... @{u}Problems@{uu} ...

  As mentioned above, you can select screenmodes, fonts and graphics
  that don't harmonize.

  - @{b}Fonts@{ub} do not affect the main window dimensions, but all 
    other window sizes.

  - @{b}Graphics sizes@{ub} affect all windows displaying letters.

  You may reduce these effects if you turn @{i}All graphics
  and animations, show opponents letters,@{ui} and  @{i}all player 
  buttons@{ui} (see 'Extras' in @{"display prefs" link prefs}) off. This may 
  reduce the sizes of the windows.

  ... @{u}Emergency-Prefs@{uu} ...

  If WBW is not able to open it's windows, a requester will appear. You
  may quit WBW then or try it with 'emergency-prefs' this means that
  WBW restarts with the following settings:

     @{i}Graphics file: DES/mini.des@{ui}      - These means a letter size 
     of 12x12 pixel and, resulting, a board size of 180x180 pixel. See
     @{"graphic files" link graphics} for more information.

     @{i}Screenmode:    Hi-Res interlaced@{ui} - A (flickering) screen of
     640x512 pixel, which hopefully can be displayed on all systems.

     @{i}Fonts:         Topaz (8 pixel)@{ui}   - WBW chooses this font, 
     because it's allways available. There could be fonts installed on your 
     system that would be more suitable, but WBW can't depend on them.

  With this settings WBW should be able to open it's windows, especially
  the preferences requester. Then you may change the settings to your
  prefered. 
    
@endnode

@node graphics "Graphic-files"

  @{b}New file format@{ub}

  WBWort uses an own format for graphic files now, which includes
  all bitmaps (board, letters, points and preview). New graphic files
  will be released separatly from the main archive.

  @{b}Do it yourself...@{ub}

  You can participate in WBW's development and draw your own
  graphic files. There's an IFF-Picture with an example and instructions
  in the archive, named: @{"Docs/DoItYourself.iff" link DoItyourself.iff/main}.

  At the moment, WBW uses the MagicWB colors. This means an 8 color
  palette as used in the example.

  There are other ways to participate, too: See chapter @{"participation" link parti}.

    If want a version using your own language, please write a

  3. @{u}Make an own vocabulary@{uu} :

    I'm allways interested in new vocabulary files. Vocabularies
