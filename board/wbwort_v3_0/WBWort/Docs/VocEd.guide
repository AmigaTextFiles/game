 This Programm uses @{"MUI" LINK MUI}. MUI is not included in this
 archive. If you don't have it, you can easily retrieve it from Aminet.

 To start VocEd simply doubleclick on its icon. If the Editor does not
 appear, then please have a look at the @{"requirements" LINK WBWort.guide/intro}.

 The Gadgets:

 @{b}Load@{ub}            - Load a vocabulary.

 @{b}Save@{ub}            - Save the vocabulary in memory.

 @{b}New@{ub}             - Create a new vocabulary.

 @{b}Add@{ub}             - Inserts an existing vocabulary into the one in
                   memory. Double words are suppressed, and not added a
                   second time.

 @{b}Quit@{ub}            - After a safetyrequester has been successfully
                   answered, the editor exits.

 @{b}<List of Words>@{ub} - The list shows the words of the choosen length.
                   If you select a word with your mouse it will be copied
                   to the stringgadget below. Modified words are
                   inserted as new ones and will NOT replace the selected.

 @{b}<Stringgadget>@{ub}  - To add new words to the vocabulary, simply enter
                   them here and press return afterwards.

 @{b}Delete@{ub}          - The selected word from the list will be removed
                   from the vocabulary.

 @{b}All@{ub}             - All words within the list will be deleted from the
                   vocabulary.

 @{b}<Slider>@{ub}        - Here you can choose the length of the words to be
                   displayed in the list above.


 The numeric fields:

    The left field contains the count of words of the choosen length.
