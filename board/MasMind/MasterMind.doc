***********************************************************************

     This is a program that I whipped up in 6 hours, just to see if
I could do it.  The game is a Mastermind clone.  The original is by 
Pressman Toy Corporation.  If I know my copyright laws I can't
call my game Mastermind.  So, I renamed my game to Mastermind ILK.  
Ilk means same or type, in old Scot.  So the title literally says
mastermind type game.  If this is not good enough, please tell me.  
     This game is simple in theroy.  The computer picks four pegs
from six different colors.  Your task is to "guess" the combination.
For simplicity I've made this game not use double pegs or missing
pegs.  If I ever decide to go back to this program I'll add these as an
option at that time.  Your guessing is aided by the computer putting white
and black pegs at the side after you press done.  A white peg means you have
a color right by it is in the wrong position.  A Black peg means you have
a color right and it is in the right position.  The order of black and white
pegs is *arbitrary*.  The positions of the pegs does not correspond to your
positions at the right.  I won't go into the logic and tricks of the game.

	Have fun.
