This is a copy of the game Othello
just load it into AMOS, and run it.

To play the game, you just click on the square that
you want your piece to go in.  (It might be a bit slow :(

The object of the game is to have filled up the board with pieces,
and have most of them on your colour.

The rules are:
		Your piece (White) MUST be next to a black one.
		You must 'Take' one or more of his pieces.  To 
		do this, you place a piece where another of your
		pieces is opposite his.
		You can't place a piece on an occupies square.
		
Simple!
