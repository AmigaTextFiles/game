Chaos V5.4 Dokumentation
************************

   This file describes the use of Chaos V5.4, a program for managing chess
tournaments. Chaos does swiss pairing as well as Round-Robin tournaments
and is able to compute the player's DWZ (German rating number) resulting
from the tournament.

Survey
******

   Chaos V5.4 is written completely in C and compiled using DICE
V2.07.54-3.0. It manages swiss pairing (see @{"Swiss pairing" Link "Swiss pairing"}) as well as
Round-Robin tournaments (see @{"Round-Robin mode" Link "Round-Robin mode"}) and computes the DWZ's
(German rating number) resulting from the tournament. It follows the rules
of the `Turnierleiterhandbuch des Deutschen Schachbundes' (The official
german chess federation's guide to managing chess tournaments). These rules
may part in detail from the FIDE-rules (especially on managing the swiss
pairing), but should conform in general. The algorithms should allow to do
the pairings in a way satisfying everyone. Chaos is fast and therefore also
suitable for tournaments with 15-minute or 5-minute games.

   When having an odd number of players, Chaos selects one player, who
receives a full point bye in the Swiss pairing mode.  You are able to add
players after drawing the first round and mark players that drop out.
(Swiss pairing only).

   All output of data (sorry: nearly all) goes to screen or printer, as the
user decides. Tables are sorted by points only, by Buchholz, extended
Buchholz or Sonneborn-Berger (see @{"Preferences" Link "Preferences"}). The program creates tables
of progress or cross-tables (the last one as TeX-source only).  All is done
with a standard-Intuition GUI (Graphical-User-Interface), which should be
usable straight forward. (This is no excuse for not reading this
documentation, especially the section about precautions.  see @{"Precautions" Link "Precautions"})

   The number of players is limited only by RAM (approximately 3 KBytes of
RAM per player are needed).

Installation
************

   Chaos is developed using Kickstart 3.0 and should run on any Amiga using
Kickstart 2.0 or higher. Chaos uses the @{b}locale.library@{ub}, but supports other
languages without it! Bad luck for people still using Kickstart 1.3 or
lower -- and another reason to upgrade. (Believe me: 2.x is a wonderful
thing for programmers and users too.)

   What Chaos needs is the @{b}mui.library@{ub}, version 2.0 or newer. MUI (@{b}Magic
user interface@{ub}) is shareware and hence freely distributable; you find it
for example on Aminet (Directory @{b}/pub/aminet/dev/gui@{ub}) or on the Fish CDs. I
admit, that using a shareware program as part of a really free program is a
bit of contradiction. But the advantages of using MUI seemed overwhelming
to me, MUI is cheap (15$ for the registration) and after all: In principle
it's possible, to use MUI without being registered. However, I strongly
encourage any Chaos user to become registered.

   A hard-drive is not required, but very useful (as always) and installing
Chaos @{i}and@{ui} MUI on one floppy disk could make problems. (I did not try it.)

   Installation is rather simple: Just unpack the file @{b}Chaos.lha@{ub}.  (I
suppose, you have done right now. :-) If not, use the following command:

   @{i}lha x Chaos5.4bin.lha@{ui}

(You will find LhA on the fish-disks for example.) If you want, you can
unpack the sources (in @{b}Chaos5.4src.lha@{ub}) as well.

   The installation is finished now! But possibly you don't like to have a
special Chaos-directory? To perform the installation you can use the
Install-Skript in that case by simply double-clicking the Install icon.
When running it in Novice-Mode it simply copies the program to @{b}c:@{ub}, the
default-icon to @{b}s:@{ub} and the Catalogs you wish to @{b}Locale:Catalogs@{ub}. The skript
needs the program @{b}Installer@{ub} which is part of the OS since Workbench 2.1.
There is a freely distributable version of this program which you should
find on the Fish-disks too or on Aminet (directory @{b}/pub/aminet/util/misc@{ub}).

   What the installer script does: When using @{b}locale.library@{ub}, Chaos needs
to find the Directory @{b}Catalogs@{ub}. This should be a subdirectory of the
directory from which the program is started or might be copied to @{b}locale:@{ub}
using the command

   @{i}copy Catalogs locale:Catalogs all@{ui}

Without @{b}locale.library@{ub} you have to use the built in english language.
Currently there is only a german catalogfile. The file @{b}src/NewCatalog.ct@{ub}
can be used to create new catalogfiles.  (Please send them to me. I will
include them in new versions of the program.) Note, that Chaos is able to
use catalogs on Workbench 2.0! Possibly you have to create a directory
@{b}Locale:catalogs@{ub} in that case.

   Another subdirectory should be called @{b}s@{ub} containing the file
@{b}Chaos_project.info@{ub}, which is the project-icon, that tournaments will
receive when being saved by Chaos, and the file @{b}Chaos_Menu@{ub} which is
required for the @{b}Special@{ub} menu. It might be changed for example using
@{b}IconEd@{ub}. Another place to install this could be @{b}s:@{ub}. In that case execute

   @{i}copy s s: all@{ui}

and remove the subdirectory @{b}s@{ub}.

   There is a subdirectory @{b}Rexx@{ub} containing some example scripts. These show
how to use Chaos from an ARexx program. Probably you wish to copy these as
well.

   It should be noted that Chaos uses some special characters which are not
included in all fonts. Please ensure that your Workbench uses fonts which
contain all 256 Amiga-characters!

   The program is started from either CLI or workbench. One thing is
important: Chaos uses algorithms working in a recursive way and needs very
much stack therefore! Suggested are 50 Bytes per player and 4000 bytes for
the system.  A stack of 20000 bytes should be sufficient and is set as
default in the Chaos-Icon. The stacksize is changed using the Info-menuitem
in the workbench screen or using the CLI-command @{b}stack@{ub} depending on how you
start Chaos. The latter should be done by inserting the following line in
@{b}s:Shell-Startup@{ub} or executing the line manually everytime before starting
Chaos:

   @{i}stack 20000@{ui}

Management
**********

   This chapter contains some general hints and is not required to use the
program. But you should take a look at the section about precautions.


 @{" Preparations " Link "Preparations"}    Some suggestions.
 @{" Precautions " Link "Precautions"}     Regards to Murphy ;-)

Preparations
============

   There are some additional problems and questions (besides the usual
things like getting a room, the chess-sets and so on) when using a computer
in a chess-tournament. You should check these:

   @{b}*@{ub} How many players will participate in the tournament? If you are
     expecting more than say 20, there will be a large number of people
     which need to be registered all at once. Note that the computer will
     accept input only from @{i}one@{ui} assistant. This might result in an annoying
     delay.  Try to be informed about the players in advance and encourage
     pre-registrations.

   @{b}*@{ub} Have a look at the playing-site: Is there a second room for the
     computer?  If not: An ink- or laser-printer might be useful.  (The
     sound of pin-writers is awful!) Do you have enough power plugs?

   @{b}*@{ub} If you are using another printer than your own, you should take a look
     at the printer-drivers. Which one could be used? And remember setting
     the preferences in the right way.

   @{b}*@{ub} Make sure that nobody unauthorized has access to the computer.  (I
     have had very bad experiences with children.)

Precautions
===========

   Did you ever have contact with Murphy's Law? If not, drop this section:
You won't in the future. Otherwise read on: What happens in case of a
hardware-failure or a software-bug? No problem, if you are prepared!

   Always having a backup of the program and all data should be your first
principle. Pairings are always (at least a little bit) randomized, so make a
backup after @{i}each@{ui} pairing. Even better: Use different files for each round.
(You might detect for example that the result of a game was entered
incorrectly, while the pairings for the next round are already finished and
saved.  By loading the previous copy you can change the result and repeat
the drawing with the correct result.) Additionally you should have contact
to another Amiga-user near you...  So hardware-failures aren't problems.

   But there might be a software-bug. :-( (Please do not be alarmed that the
author considers this, see it as a strength of the program! :-) You have to
manage the tournament by hand in that case. The program is able to create
the player-cards you need using the menuitem @{b}Player-cards@{ub}. (Actually the
program creates TeX-source. The output of TeX isn't very fast.  I would
like to have suggestions for doing this another way.) See @{"Player-cards" Link "Output"}.

Starting the program
********************

   The program is started from either CLI or Workbench by double-clicking
the program's icon or a project icon created by Chaos. The command-template
of Chaos look's like the following:

     @{i}Chaos FILE,MAKEICONS/S,DEFICON/K,LANGUAGE/K,NOWINDOW/S@{ui}

This is what the arguments mean:
@{b}FILE@{ub}
     is the name of a tournament-file you want to load. The program is
     initialized to a new tournament without name, if @{b}FILE@{ub} is omitted. You
     should begin by selecting the menuitem @{b}Project-New@{ub} in that case.

@{b}MAKEICONS@{ub}
     forces Chaos to create Icons when saving tournaments. When started
     from CLI, Chaos will not create Icons otherwise.

@{b}DEFICON@{ub}
     is the name of the icon, Chaos should use. Default is @{b}s/Chaos_Project@{ub}.
     Please notice, that the ending @{b}.info@{ub} is added automatically by
     @{b}icon.library@{ub}! If the given Icon isn't found, Chaos try's to load
     @{b}s:Chaos_Project@{ub}. If this is isn't present either, Chaos will use the
     Kickstart's default-icon. See @{"Installation" Link "Installation"}.

@{b}MENUFILE@{ub}
     is the name of a file containing own menuitems which should appear in
     a menu called @{b}Special@{ub}. (Default is @{b}s/Chaos_Menu@{ub}.) See @{"Own Menuitems" Link "Own Menuitems"}.

@{b}LANGUAGE@{ub}
     is the name of the language you wish to use. This is for users of
     Workbench 2.0 only. Don't use this when running Workbench 2.1 or
     higher! Default is english. Of course other languages require the
     installation of the catalog files.

@{b}NOWINDOW@{ub}
     suppresses the program's window. This makes of course no sense, except
     if you use the program in batch mode from an ARexx script.

@{b}WINNERPOINTS@{ub}
@{b}DRAWPOINTS@{ub}
     number of points that winning a game and draws give, respectively.
     Note, that these will be divided by two.  See @{"tournament-window" Link "tournament-window"}.

   The Workbench-Tooltypes are the same except for @{b}MAKEICONS@{ub}: The default
is to create Icons, when started from Workbench, so this command isn't
needed. In that case you might use the Tooltype @{b}NOICONS@{ub}. (Please notice,
that the Project-icon's Tooltypes overwrite those of the Tool-icon.)
@{b}NOWINDOW@{ub} isn't allowed as tooltype. I don't see any sense in running the
program without window from the workbench.

The program's input-windows
***************************

   Input of data is done using standard-Intuition-gadgets. You should be
able to work with it immediately. However, some principles should be noted:

   @{b}*@{ub} All windows have a CloseWindow- and a Cancel-gadget. You might cancel
     the program's actions everywhere. The Esc key might be used
     alternatively.

   @{b}*@{ub} All windows receiving input have an Ok-gadget and are terminated using
     this. Additionally you can use the keys Ctrl Return to terminate a
     window. However, this will not work if a string gadget is activated. A
     workaround is to set Ctrl Return as @{b}Gadget Off@{ub} key in the MUI
     preferences. This makes it possible to terminate the window by pressing
     Ctrl Return twice.

   @{b}*@{ub} Some windows have string gadgets. The first string gadget is always
     activated, when the window appears. All text you enter will be
     received by that string-gadget, until you press one of the following
     keys:
       1. The Tab- and the Return-key will activate the next string-gadget.

       2. The Shift-Tab key will activate the previous string-gadget.

   @{b}*@{ub} MUI makes it possible to work without mouse. For example pressing the
     Tab key always activates the next gadget and Shift-Tab the previos.
     Listview gadgets are controlled by the cursor keys and the Return key
     can select a button like the Ok gadget. Note, that the keys can be
     changed in the MUI preferences. Please read details in the MUI
     documentation.

   These are the input-windows:


 @{" Input of tournament-data " Link "tournament-window"}                     Tournament-name and -mode
 @{" Player-selection " Link "Player-selection"}                             Selection of a player
 @{" Input of player-data " Link "Player-input"}                         Input of one player's data
 @{" Setting games " Link "Setting games"}                    Forcing pairings (Swiss pairing only)
 @{" Input of results " Link "Result-input"}                             Input of one round's results


@EndNode

@Node "tournament-window" "Chaos_english.guide/tournament-window"
@Next "Player-selection"
@Toc "Input-windows"

The Input-of-tournament-data-window
===================================

   This window appears, when selecting the menuitem @{b}Project-New@{ub}.  See
@{"Project" Link "Project"}. The window contains a string-gadget, in which the tournament-name
should be entered. This is the name which will appear on the main-window
and in the printer-headlines. If you have different groups each playing
their own tournament, you should use different names, for example "1st
Metzinger Open (Women)" and "1st Metzinger Open (Men)".

   Below of the tournament name you find gadgets where you may enter the
points for winning a game and draws. They correspond directly to the
@{b}WINNERPOINTS@{ub} and @{b}DRAWERPOINTS@{ub} arguments when starting the program. See
@{"Startup" Link "Startup"}. These numbers are divided by two, thus if you want the usual 1
point for a win and a half point for a draw, you have to enter 2 and 1
point instead. (These are the defaults.) The idea is to allow something
like 3 points for a win and 1 point for a draw. (Remember, that you would
have to enter 6 and 2 instead.)

The Player-selection-window
===========================

   This window is opened from the menuitems @{b}Players-Modify@{ub} and
@{b}Players-Delete@{ub}. See @{"Players" Link "Players"}. It shows a list of all players, which can be
scrolled with the usual Arrow- and Scrollbar-Gadgets. You can select one
player by clicking on his name or more than one by clicking on their names
while holding the shift key pressed. Note, that it's just like selecting
Workbench icons. The window is terminated by pressing the upper-left button
of the window. (@{b}Modify@{ub}, for example)


@EndNode

@Node "Player-input" "Chaos_english.guide/Player-input"
@Next "Setting games"
@Prev "Player-selection"
@Toc "Input-windows"

The Input-of-player-data-window
===============================

   When selecting one of the menu-items @{b}Players-Add@{ub} or @{b}Players-Modify@{ub}, this
window will appear. See @{"Players" Link "Players"}. It uses the following gadgets:

@{i}Name@{ui}
     The player's name is used, when pairing the first round. The players
     are sorted alphabetically by the program, therefore their names need
     to be entered in a uniform way. Suggested is last name, comma, first
     name, for example "Wiedmann, Jochen". See @{"Swiss pairing" Link "Swiss pairing"}.

     You @{i}must@{ui} enter a player's name and it must be unique! The program
     doesn't accept clicking the Ok-gadget without a name! If needed, use
     something like @{b}Miller, Joe (2)@{ub}.

@{i}Home address@{ui}
@{i}Phone@{ui}
     The player's addresses will not be needed in most cases. Of course
     they might be useful, if a tournament goes on for an extended period
     of time.

@{i}Chess-club@{ui}
     This will not be needed too in most cases. But you might wish to
     include this in the list of players.

@{i}Birthday@{ui}
     A players birthday is needed only when computing the DWZ-ratings. It
     @{i}must@{ui} be entered as dd.mm.yy or dd.mm.yyyy, where dd means day, mm
     means month and yy Year. I would like to use the excellent DOS-routine
     StrToDate, which might use the locale's date format instead of my own.
     But StrToDate fails when entering dates prior to 1.1.1978!

     The program checks birthdays before accepting them and rejects
     incorrect dates.

@{i}Rating@{ui}
     The rating is used to create an internal ranking, when pairing the
     first round (Swiss pairing only) and when computing the new DWZ of
     course. You might enter any national rating, for example USCF-rating
     instead, if they are sorted descending. (Better players have higher
     numbers.) Of course you must not mix ratings of different systems, you
     should convert them instead.

     Please notice that the official form of the DWZ is something like
     1834-23, which means a rating of 1834 resulting from 23 tournaments.
     Chaos accepts both the official and the short form 1834.

@{i}ELO@{ui}
     If players have an ELO-number, this rather than DWZ will be used by
     Chaos.  (This seems wise to me, but could be handled in a different
     manner.) Please notice, that ELO-numbers should not be entered, if
     national ratings and ELO-numbers aren't equivalent. For example
     players which have the same DWZ or ELO should be expected to have the
     same playing strength.

For all these string-gadgets please have a look at @{"Input-windows" Link "Input-windows"}.

@{i}Senior@{ui}
@{i}Junior@{ui}
@{i}Woman@{ui}
@{i}Junior (A)@{ui}
@{i}Junior (B)@{ui}
@{i}Junior (C)@{ui}
@{i}Junior (D)@{ui}
@{i}Junior (E)@{ui}
     If you want to make separate tables for special groups (for example
     you can give a prize to the best woman), but all players are paired in
     one group, you can use these gadgets to mark the groups. This doesn't
     affect the pairings, it just adds the possibiltyof creating separate
     tables for these groups. See @{"Table" Link "Output"}.

Setting games
=============

   Under certain circumstances you might wish to force special pairings.
That's why this window appears before drawing the games of a new round in a
Swiss pairing tournament. I don't expect you want this in most cases and so
the window can be disabled using the menu item @{b}Setting games@{ub}.  See
@{"Setting games" Link "Preferences"}.

   To the left of the window you find the list of all players except for
withdrawn players. By double-clicking a players name you put him into the
list of set games on the right side of the window. Of course you need to
double-click another player to make a game. Chaos doesn't allow you to pair
players again. You will be asked, if you really want to pair players, if
both had one color in the last two rounds. Using the @{b}Delete@{ub} button you can
remove games.

   Normally Chaos should determine who will receive the white pieces. This
makes the pairings easier in the following rounds. However, this can be
changed using the cycle gadget below the list of players. In that case the
first player will receive the white pieces. (The order of setting is
meaningless otherwise.) Matches with colors determined are indicated by a
@{b}(cd)@{ub} (colors determined) behind the names.

   You can as well select a player for a one point bye: After all games have
been selected, double-click the player for the one point bye. (You select
an odd number of players.) Of course this isn't allowed, if the number of
active players is even or if the player already had an one point bye.


@EndNode

@Node "Result-input" "Chaos_english.guide/Result-input"
@Prev "Setting games"
@Toc "Input-windows"

The Input-of-results-window
===========================

   By selecting a subitem of @{b}Round-Input results@{ub} you create this window,
which shows a list of one round's games. (see @{"Input results" Link "Round"}) By using the
usual Arrow- and scrollbar-gadgets you might scroll this list.  There is
always one game, which is activated and therefore highlighted (Kickstart
3.x) or shown beneath the List (Kickstart 2.x). You might activate another
game by clicking it.

   Some other gadgets are placed below. By clicking the right ones (@{b}Played@{ub}
and @{b}Not played@{ub}) you tell the program, if a game really took place or was,
for example, forfeited. (Default is, that the game was played.) The gadgets
to the left (@{b}White wins@{ub}, @{b}Draw@{ub}, @{b}Black wins@{ub}, @{b}Result missing@{ub}) allow to enter
the game's result. (Default is, that the result is missing.)

   You may as well use the keyboard to enter results: The keys w (White
wins), d (Draw), b (Black wins), m (Result missing), p (Game played) and n
(Game not played) correspond to the gadgets above. The next game will
automatically be activated after a result was entered. This allows a rather
fast and comfortable input.

The program's menus
*******************

   The program uses one main-window, which contains some informations:
Tournament-name and -file, number of players and rounds and tournament-mode.
It carries a menu-bar, while there is no input- or output-window.

   The menus are:


 @{" Project " Link "Project"}      Loading and saving tournaments
 @{" Players " Link "Players"}      Managing the list of players
 @{" Round " Link "Round"}        Pairing and result-input

The Project-menu
================

   Most programs using a GUI have a menu like this. It's items are:

@{i}New@{ui}
     This menu-item creates the Input-of-tournament-data-window.  See
     @{"Input of tournament data" Link "tournament-window"}. If anything has changed since the last
     save/load, a requester appears and asks, if you want to save first.

@{i}Load@{ui}
     You might load a tournament from disk using this using the @{b}asl.library@{ub}.
     The same requester as above appears, if data has changed since the last
     save/load.

@{i}Save@{ui}
     Here you save the tournament. Of course a tournament-file has to be set
     first. (This is done by loading a tournament.) @{b}Project-Save as@{ub} is
     called without a tournament-file.

@{i}Save as@{ui}
     Using this you might select another tournament-file with the

     to save to different files after each drawing. (see @{"Precautions" Link "Precautions"}) This
     is supported by calling this menuitem automatically, if drawing is
     finished and using a name like @{b}chaos.5.cdat@{ub} as default, where 5 is the
     number of rounds.

@{i}About@{ui}
     Here some informations about the program and me (the author) is

     to see @{i}interesting@{ui} information. Of course I am disappointed always. :-(
     Now I want to disappoint you! ;-)

@{i}Quit@{ui}
     Oh no! You really need this? Think about it! Sure? Ok. No point in
     helping those people. Of course the program brings up a similar
     warning if you want to leave without saving modifications first.

The Players-menu
================

   This menu's items are using the windows @{b}Input of player-data@{ub} and
@{b}Player-selection@{ub}. They are described above. See @{"Input-windows" Link "Input-windows"}.  Here are
the menu-items:

@{i}Add@{ui}
     Using this you enter new players before starting the tournament.  When
     using the Swiss pairing, you may enter new players until the second
     round is paired. This of course is not in strict accordance with the
     rules, but some administrators will be happy about it. New players are
     given a one point bye, if the number of players was even before or
     have to play against the player who was free before (and he gets his
     bye removed). The new players are sorted in at the lower end of the
     internal list of rankings. Please note that you decide about the
     pairings of the new players, if you enter more than one! You should
     therefore follow the principles described in @{"Late players" Link "Late players"}.

@{i}Import@{ui}
     You might wish to include players from a previous tournament in a new
     tournament without enter all data manually. This is possible by using
     this item: The asl requester appears, allowing to select an old
     tournament file and to get players from the player selection window.

     You can create a player database by creating a new tournament, give it
     the name of your club, for example, and including the players here.
     See @{"UpdateRatings" Link "UpdateRatings"}.

@{i}Modify@{ui}
     You are always able to modify players. Of course this should not happen
     after the first round and therefore a requester appears, asking you,
     whether you really want to do this.

@{i}Delete@{ui}
     Players may be deleted before the first pairings, but not later. You
     can use this menu-item to mark players who dropped out instead, when
     using the Swiss pairing. Players which get the marked player as
     opponent, will receive a one point bye. Of course there will be at
     most one player receiving a free point per round. Dropped players are
     paired against each other to ensure this.

     In either case there will be requesters which ensure that you don't
     delete players accidentally. Note, that @{i}no@{ui} player is deleted, if you
     cancel @{i}anywhere@{ui}.

The Round-Menu
==============

   This menu is designed to manage the menu after entering the players. It
has just two menu-items:

@{i}Make pairings@{ui}
     This menuitem contains 3 subitems. By selecting one of these subitems
     the tournament is started and the first pairings are made using the
     corresponding mode: Either @{b}Swiss pairing@{ub} (see @{"Swiss pairing" Link "Swiss pairing"}) or @{b}Round
     Robin@{ub} according to the FIDE (see @{"FIDE-system" Link "FIDE-system"}) or the @{b}shift-system@{ub} (see
     @{"shift-system" Link "shift-system"}).  Please note, that it is not possible to change the
     pairing-mode later!

     When playing a Round-Robin tournament, all games are paired at once
     and this menu-item is no longer needed. In a Swiss-pairing-tournament
     this needs to be selected again to create the pairings of another
     round. The program will not allow you to make new pairings until all
     results of the previous round are entered.  If you need to proceed
     without waiting for all the results, you can use a simple trick: Enter
     all missing results as draw, make the pairings and mark the results
     again as missing. (Do not forget to re-modify the results, before
     making them public!)

     If a pairing was successful, the menu-item @{b}Project-Save as@{ub} is called
     automatically. I @{i}strongly@{ui} recommend to use this!  See @{"Precautions" Link "Precautions"}.

@{i}Input results@{ui}
     The results are entered using this menu item. A requester appears
     asking for the round number, if you select it.

The Output-menu
===============

   All output except the player-cards and the cross-table can either be
directed to screen, printer (Draft or Letter quality mode) or to a file.
This is set in the preferences-menu. See @{"Output-Device" Link "Preferences"}.

   Output to the screen will appear in the Output-window. The text is
arranged as a scrollable list and you may use Arrow- or Scrollbar-Gadgets
to move the text up and down. For the printer please remember to set the
printer-preferences. See @{"Preparations" Link "Preparations"}. The asl-filerequester appears, if
you want output to a file and select an output item and allows you to enter
a filename.

   Using the corresponding menuitems you can create the following lists:

@{i}List of players@{ui}
     You can select a @{b}short@{ub} list containing only player-numbers, names,
     chess-clubs and ratings (DWZ and ELO) of the players or a @{b}long@{ub} list
     containing all player-data.

@{i}List of rankings@{ui}
     This is the internal ranking used by the program. It is sorted by the
     official ratings before the first round, but changes later. There's no
     need to look at this list, except if you want to follow the program
     making pairings. See @{"Swiss pairing" Link "Swiss pairing"}. Please note that this list might
     look somewhat confusing, when results have been entered since the last
     pairing. The list isn't sorted until new pairings are created and
     therefore should be printed only immediately after creating them.

@{i}Table@{ui}
     The table can be sorted in different ways. This is set in the
     preferences-menu. See @{"Table-mode" Link "Preferences"}. Additionally you can create separate
     tables of special groups (seniors, juniors, women, ...).  See
     @{"Input of player-data" Link "Player-input"}.

@{i}Round@{ui}
     This is the list of all games of one round. The number of the round is
     selected using the same requester as for entering results. See
     @{"Enter results" Link "Round"}.

@{i}Table of progress@{ui}
     This table contains a list of all players, all games and results. It is
     designed to be used in the Swiss-pairing-mode and therefore disabled
     in the Round-Robin mode.

@{i}Cross-table@{ui}
     The cross-table is nearly the same as the table of progress, but
     designed for the Round-Robin mode and therefore disabled in the
     Swiss-pairing-mode.  Another output mode is available here: Chaos can
     create TeX-source.  If you select the subitem @{b}TeX@{ub} the asl-requester
     appears, asking for a filename. The subitem @{b}Ascii@{ub} works in the usual
     way.

@{i}Player-cards@{ui}
     The player-cards contain all information to manage the tournament
     manually.  They are designed primarily for my purposes (debugging),
     but I decided to keep them in the public version for safety purposes.
     See @{"Precautions" Link "Precautions"}.  The output of the player-cards works in the same way
     as the output of the cross-table.

@{i}DWZ-ratings@{ui}
     The output of the DWZ-ratings is described in detail in another
     chapter.  See @{"DWZ-ratings" Link "DWZ-ratings"}.

The Preferences-Menu
====================

   Please notice, that the menu-items of this menu are valid for different
periods.

@{i}Table-mode@{ui}
     You select the table-mode here, which determines how the tables are
     sorted.  Please notice that the table mode is saved with the other
     tournament-data.  Possible modes are (default is simple):
       1. In the @{b}simple@{ub} mode the table is sorted by points only.

       2. Using the @{b}Buchholz@{ub}-mode the table is sorted by points and
          Buchholz-points. A player's Buchholz-points are calculated as the
          sum of his opponent's points.

       3. The @{b}extended Buchholz@{ub}-mode is nearly the same as the Buchholz
          mode, except that extended Buchholz-points are included, which
          are the summarized Buchholz-points of the opponents.

       4. The @{b}Sonneborn-Berger@{ub}-mode is similar to the Buchholz-mode, except
          that the opponents points are multiplied by a constant depending
          on the result: 0 for a loss, one for a draw and 2 for a win.

@{i}Output-device@{ui}
     You set the output-device here. (Surprise! ;-) Possible devices are
     screen, printer using draft, printer using letter quality or output to
     a file.  Default is screen, which is always set when the program
     starts.

@{i}Setting games@{ui}
     If this option is set (it is @{i}not@{ui} when the program starts) and you
     select the menu item @{b}Pairings@{ub} in a Swiss pairing tournament a window
     appears that allows you to set games. See @{"Setting games" Link "Setting games"}.

@{i}Make icons@{ui}
     This shows, whether chaos will create an icon, if a tournament is
     saved.  Default is to create icons, when started from Workbench and to
     omit this, when started from CLI. (This can be modified by using the
     MAKEICONS- or DEFICON-options or the NOICONS-tooltype, respectively;
     see @{"Startup" Link "Startup"}) Selecting the menu-item toggles this mode.

The DWZ-report
**************

   The list of DWZ-ratings contains all players, who have played at least
one rated opponent. The algorithm of computing the DWZ is similar to the
ELO-algorithm and therefore can be used to get a rough impression of a
players performance, even if another rating-system, for example USCF is
used. For details of the algorithm see: Peter Zoefel, Karl-Heinz Glenz,
`Das ELO-System'.

   Age is a factor in determining the DWZ and the birthday of the player is
required for an official rating-report. Therefore a requester appears, if a
players birthday is missing when computing the DWZ. It offers the following
answers:
  1. One of the gadgets @{b}20 or less@{ub}, @{b}21-25@{ub}, @{b}26 or more@{ub} makes the program
     suggest, that the player belongs to the corresponding age-group. The
     DWZ is computed in the normal way, but of course the birthday is
     missing on the DWZ-report.

  2. The gadget @{b}Modify@{ub} allows to modify the player's data, include the
     birthday and continue computing the DWZ.

  3.     @{b}Drop@{ub} tells the program that this player should not be included in
     the DWZ-report.

  4.     @{b}Cancel@{ub} breaks creating the DWZ-report.

   The DWZ-report contains the following values:
@{i}Ro@{ui}
     is the old DWZ. It should be entered in a form like 1834-23, where
     1834 is the old DWZ and 23 is the number of rated tournaments.
     However, it is possible to enter the DWZ in the short form 1834.

@{i}W@{ui}
     are the points scored in games against opponents who already have a
     DWZ.

@{i}n@{ui}
     is the number of rated games.

@{i}We@{ui}
     is the win expectancy, that is the number of points the player is
     expected to score in order to keep the DWZ.

@{i}RH@{ui}
     is the so called H-number, the performance rating.

@{i}Rn@{ui}
     is the new DWZ in the same form as Ro. Previously unrated players get a
     provisional DWZ like 1457-(4), where 4 is equal to n. This provisional
     DWZ will be used in future tournaments. Once a player accumulates 9
     games, his rating is established.

Possible ARexx commands
=======================

   The ARexx commands correspond to menu items, you should therefore
understand them immediately. Of course you cannot use an ARexx command,
when the corresponding menu item is disabled. For example it is not
possible to sort the table due to Buchholz points in a round robin
tournament or make new pairings while the user enters results.

   This are the commands:

 - : NewTournament @{i}NAME/A,@{ui}  @{i}FORCE/S@{ui}
     Creates a new tournament with the given name. You are asked for
     confirmation, if the current tournament isn't saved. This can be
     suppressed using the FORCE option. See @{"Project-New" Link "Project"}.

 - : LoadTournament @{i}FILE/A,@{ui}  @{i}FORCE/S@{ui}
     Loads the given tournament. FORCE works like above. See @{"Project-Load" Link "Project"}.

 - : SaveTournament @{i}FILE/A,@{ui}  @{i}ICON/S@{ui}
     Saves the current tournament in the given file. You can create an icon
     using the ICON option. See @{"Project-Save" Link "Project"}.

 - : AddPlayer @{i}NAME/A,@{ui}  @{i}STREET/K,@{ui}  @{i}VILLAGE/K,@{ui}  @{i}CHESSCLUB/K,@{ui}  @{i}BIRTHDAY/K,@{ui}
          @{i}PHONE/K,@{ui}  @{i}RATING/K,@{ui}  @{i}ELO/K,@{ui}  @{i}FLAGS/K,@{ui}  @{i}NOUSER/S@{ui}
     Enters a new player. A name must be present. Flags are a string
     containing one or more of the characters s (Senior), j (Junior), w
     (Woman) and a-e (Junior A, ...,  Junior E). RATING is the DWZ or
     another national rating. See @{"Player-input" Link "Player-input"}. See @{"Players-Add" Link "Players"}.  The
     option NOUSER suppresses error requesters.

 - : ModifyPlayer @{i}PLAYER/A,@{ui}  @{i}NAME/K,@{ui}  @{i}STREET/K,@{ui}  @{i}VILLAGE/K,@{ui}  @{i}CHESSCLUB/K,@{ui}
          @{i}BIRTHDAY/K,@{ui}  @{i}PHONE/K,@{ui}  @{i}RATING/K,@{ui}  @{i}ELO/K,@{ui}  @{i}FLAGS/K@{ui}
     Modifies the data of the player whose name is PLAYER. Only the given
     fields are modified, for example

     @{b}ModifyPlayer "Widmann, Jochen" NAME "Wiedmann, Jochen"@{ub}

     modifies the name only. See @{"Players-Modify" Link "Players"}.  NOUSER suppresses error
     requesters.

 - : DeletePlayer @{i}PLAYER/A,@{ui}  @{i}FORCE/S@{ui}
     deletes the given player (or marks him as withdrawn in a Swiss pairing
     tournament). You are asked for confirmation without the FORCE option.
     See @{"Players-Delete" Link "Players"}.

 - : SetPlayer @{i}PLAYER/A,@{ui}  @{i}INIT/S,@{ui}  @{i}FORCE/S@{ui}
     Sets the given player for the next pairings. For example if you want to
     force the pairings of players 3-5 and 2-4 and give player 17 an one
     point bye you execute the SetPlayer command for players 3, 5, 2, 4 and
     17 in that order and call DoPairings after that. You see: It works
     like the interactive setting of games. See @{"Setting games" Link "Setting games"}.

     You can remove the games that have been set so far using the INIT
     option.  This must be called @{i}before@{ui} executing DoPairings of course.)
     You might enter a new player together with the INIT option.

     Chaos declines pairing the same players a second time or giving a one
     point bye to a player who already had one. You are asked for
     confirmation, if players should be paired, who had one and the same
     color in the last two rounds. (This can be suppressed with the FORCE
     option.) Normally Chaos determines, who will receive the white pieces.
     However, this can be changed using the SETCOLOR option. It @{i}must@{ui} be
     given when setting the second player who will receive the black
     pieces. It is ignored when setting the first player. See
     @{"Round-Pairings" Link "Round"}.

 - : DoPairings @{i}SWISSPAIRING/S,@{ui}  @{i}ROUNDROBIN/S,@{ui}  @{i}ROUNDROBINSHIFT/S,@{ui}
          @{i}NOUSER/S@{ui}
     This command creates new pairings. You must give one of the options
     SWISSPAIRING, ROUNDROBIN (FIDE system) or ROUNDROBINSHIFT (shift
     system) before creating the first round. The setting games window will
     be opened without the NOUSER option and allows the user to enter new
     games.

     Chaos declines to draw new games, if you gave a player an one point
     bye, but the number of active players is even, See @{"Pairings" Link "Round"}.

 - : EnterResult @{i}WHITE/A,@{ui}  @{i}BLACK/A,@{ui}  @{i}RESULT/A/N,@{ui}  @{i}NOTPLAYED/S@{ui}
     The result (2 = white wins, 1 = draw, 0 = black wins, -1 = result
     missing) of the match between players WHITE and BLACK is entered using
     this command.  The NOTPLAYED option should be used, if the match
     didn't took place.  See @{"Round-Enter results" Link "Round"}.

   The following output commands need a filename. The given file will
receive the output in Ascii format. You can use the names @{b}prt:@{ub} for output
to the printer in draft mode or @{b}prt:LQ@{ub} for letter quality.

 - : PlayerList @{i}FILE/A,@{ui}  @{i}SHORT/S@{ui}
     Prints the list of players. The long format is used without the SHORT
     option. See @{"List of players" Link "Output"}.

 - : InternalRatings @{i}FILE/A@{ui}
     Prints the internal ratings. See @{"Internal ratings" Link "Output"}.

 - : Table @{i}FILE/A,@{ui}  @{i}TABMODE/K/N,@{ui}  @{i}PLRMODE/K/N@{ui}
     Prints the current table. The table is sorted due to the TABMODE (0 =
     simple, 1 = Buchholz, 2 = extended Buchholz, 3 = Sonneborn-Berger) and
     PLRMODE determines, which players should be included into the table (0
     = all, 1 = seniors, 2 = juniors, 3 = women, 4, ..., 8 = Juniors A, ...,
     Juniors E). Defaults are simpe and all. See @{"Table" Link "Output"}.

 - : Round @{i}FILE/A,@{ui}  @{i}NUMBER/N@{ui}
     Prints the given round; default is the last round. See @{"Round" Link "Output"}.

 - : TableOfProgress @{i}FILE/A,@{ui}  @{i}TABMODE/K/N@{ui}
     Prints the table of progress. See the table command for TABMODE.  See
     @{"Table of progress" Link "Output"}.

 - : CrossTable @{i}FILE/A,@{ui}  @{i}TEX/S@{ui}
     Prints the crosstable. TeX source is created with the TEX option. It is
     possible, to use this option together with the filename @{b}prt:@{ub}, but this
     doesn't call TeX and prints the source on the printer instead, that's
     why this probably doesn't make much sense. See @{"Cross table" Link "Output"}.

 - : PlayerCards @{i}FILE/A,@{ui}  @{i}TEX/S@{ui}
     Prints the player cards. See the CrossTable command for the TEX option.
     See @{"Player cards" Link "Output"}.

 - : DWZReport @{i}FILE/A@{ui}
     Prints the DWZ report. It isn't possible, to suppress the requester
     asking for a players birthday, if this is missing. See @{"DWZ-ratings" Link "DWZ-ratings"}.

 - : Window @{i}ON/S,@{ui}  @{i}OFF/S@{ui}

Inserting ARexx commands into an own menu
=========================================

   Once you have created an own ARexx script you probably wish to execute
this from Chaos itself. This is possible by creating an own menu calling
this script.

   Chaos is looking for a file called @{b}s/Chaos_Menu@{ub} at startup. (This name
can be changed by using the option @{b}MENUFILE@{ub}. See @{"Startup" Link "Startup"}.) If this isn't
found, Chaos is looking for @{b}s:Chaos_Menu@{ub} as well.

   A menu called @{b}Special@{ub} will be created, if one of this files is found.
The file defines some menuitems, which will be inserted into the menu.
Each menuitem is represented by two subsequent lines in the file: One for
the label and one for a shell command which will be executed, if the
corresponding menuitem is selected. (See @{b}s/Chaos_Menu@{ub} for an example.)

   Notes:
  1. Chaos is not ready to receive commands until the Shell command
     terminates.  Especially Chaos cannot execute ARexx commands while your
     Shell command is running! Hence you probably need to use the command
     @{b}Run@{ub}.

  2. Intuition cannot maintain more than 31 menuitems.

   Two scripts are available yet. These should supply you with examples, but
possibly might be useful for themselves. Both contain a description of how
to use them

PrintTable: Formatting own tables
---------------------------------

   A swiss user group wanted a special formatted table: The points should be
behind the players and the chessclub should appear as well. This script
realizes it. It makes Chaos to write the current table and the list of
players into special files. This are read by the script and the modified
table gets printed.

   There should be no problem to understand the script, except for one
point: All this data dosn't fit on one line in any case! (Player and
chessclub names may be up to 30 characters long.) The script solves this by
cutting these names eventually.

UpdateRatings: Exporting new computed ratings into a database
-------------------------------------------------------------

   The menuitem @{b}Import@{ub} makes it possible to have a player database, as
already mentioned. (see @{"Players" Link "Players"}) This script makes it possible, to update
the ratings of the database. You have to supply the script with a database
name, either by calling it with @{b}UpdateRatings.rexx databasename@{ub} (The name
must be inserted in @{b}s/Chaos_Menu@{ub} in that case.) or by selecting the
database with the asl requester, if the script is called without a database
name. (This assumes the existence of @{b}c:RequestFile@{ub}.)

   The script stores the current tournament in @{b}t:CurrentTournament@{ub}, makes
Chaos to write the new ratings into a file and load the database. The ARexx
command @{b}ModifyPlr@{ub} is used to update the ratings in the database which is
saved again finally and the current tournament is restored.

Round-Robin tournament
======================

   In an Round-Robin tournament each player meets all the other
participants in the tournament once. In order to determine the pairings
each player is assigned a random number, his pairing number. Assume that
the pairing numbers are 1,2,...,n.

   If n is odd, we add an imaginary player with number n+1. His opponent
will be free for the corresponding round. Without loss of generality we may
therefore assume that n is even and k = n/2;

   There are two different ways to determine the pairings: The FIDE-system
and the shift-system.

@EndNode

@Next "shift-system"

The FIDE-system
---------------

   This is the system suggested by the FIDE. It is well known, but not very
clear and needs more organization therefore. A player will hardly know his
next opponent or the place where he will play.

   The games of the first round are: 1 - n, 2 - (n-1), 2 - (n-2) and so on.

   In the following rounds we start by getting the opponent of player n.
The opponents are: k+1 (round 2), 2 (round 3), k+2, 4, k+3 and so on.  The
players 2,3,...,k have the white-pieces chessmen, k+1, k+2,...  the black
ones.

   All other players are determined as follows: The next round's opponent
is the player whose pairing number follows after the pairing number of the
last round's opponent. Player n is not included in this and pairing number 1
follows after pairing number n-1. Pairings where a player should play
himself mean that he plays player n instead.

The shift-system
----------------

   This system has a big advantage: Every player will know his next
opponent, the place where they will meet and the colors. The expense of
management will be rather small except for the first round where you need
to tell the players where they should sit down.

   The games of the first round are as follows: 1 - k+1 (board 1), k+2 - 2
(board 2), 3 - k+3 (board 3), k+4 - 4 (board 4) and so on. The lower half
players sit side by side, player 2 to the right of player 1.

   After each round the players are shifted clockwise. The boards remain
unchanged. An exception is the last board when having an even number of
participants: Player n keeps his place and turns his board. (Player n is
the one using the white pieces at the last board in the first round when
having an even number of boards and the black pieces otherwise.) All boards
remain unchanged when the number of players is odd: The opponent of the
virtual player n is free in that case.

   The shift-system isn't very popoular outside Germany, as far as i know.
An example may be useful to illustrate what i mean. Let the first round look
like this:

     				4  5  6
     				1  2  3

(Player 3 might be written alone in the diagram above, if there were only 5
players and he would be free.) When the first round is finished, players
1-5 are shifted clockwise and circular while player 6 keeps his place and
turns his board. This leads to the following position:

     				1  4  6
     				2  3  5

The shift will now be repeated after each round.

Swiss pairing
=============

   The Swiss pairing is needed, if there are more players than rounds. The
principle of the algorithm is to pair players which are approximally of
equal strength. In the end the best player should score the most points of
course.

   Each round begins by building an internal list of rankings. When starting
the tournament, the players are sorted by the DWZ (or ELO-number, if there
is one). Players without DWZ and ELO-number are placed at the end of the
list. Players with equal rating (and players without a rating) are sorted
alphabetically.

   Let n be again the number of players. If n is odd, one player is selected
randomly receiving a full point bye. In the first round this is a player
without DWZ. (If there are fewer than 5 players without DWZ, the weakest
ones are added to the group to ensure that this is a real drawing.) Without
loss of generality we may therefore assume that n is even and k is n/2.

   We start by determining randomly whether player 1 receives white or
black. If he gets white, the games of round 1 are: 1 - k+1, k+2 - 2, 3 -
k+3 and so on. If player 1 gets black the pairings are the same, but the
colors are reversed.

   Beginning with round 2 the players are sorted by points. The group of
players with the same number of points are sorted by the last internal
rankings.  (So the influence of the DWZ on the rankings gets smaller with
every round.)

   Beginning with the highest group of players (those which have the most
points), we try to pair the players of one group against each other. We
divide each group in 4 subgroups: First we divide the group in an upper and
lower half (by using the rankings of the previous round), then we separate
those which had white in the previous round and those which had black.
Let's look at an example:

         Upper half, white       Upper half, black
            1                            2
            3                            5
            4                            6
     				    7
     
         Lower half, white       Lower half, black
            8                            11
            9                            12
            10                           13
     				    14

   We try to pair players of the upper half and players of the lower half,
as we did in the first round. Additionally we would like to pair players of
the left and the right side, because this allows more possible pairings in
the next round. But this is not always possible: In the above example we
need to pair at least two players from the right half.

   We begin by getting an opponent for player 1. As described above, we try
player 11. Player 2 is paired with player 8, player 3 with 12, player 4
with 14, 5 with 9, 6 with 10 and finally 7 with 14.

   This assumes, that all games can be paired. Of course this is not always
true. A pairing is allowed, if
  1. The same opponents have not been paired in the previous rounds.

  2. The players did not have the same colors in the previous two rounds.
     This rules out having three times black (or white) in a row.

  3. It is possible to pair the rest of the players following 1. und 2.
     rules
        It is allowed, that a player has the black pieces 4 times in 5
rounds! (Not my selection, i personally would prefer to prohibit this.  But
i follow the rules of the `Turnierleiterhandbuch'.)

   If the number of players in the group is odd, there is one player left at
the end. This player is moved to the next group. If the number of all
players is odd, one player is left at the end. This player gets a full point
bye. (Of course no player may get more than one bye.)

   If it isn't possible to pair the players of a group, the lowest player
is moved to the next group. This process needs to be repeated possibly.

Late players
============

   When using the Swiss pairing, it is possible to add players after pairing
the first round. If there is only one player to be added, simply enter him.
But be aware that the order in which you input the new players determines
the pairings, if there is more than one new player. In this case you are
encouraged to follow these steps:

  1. If the number of players was odd until now, add the free player to the
     new players.

  2. Build the internal list of rankings of the new players and make the
     pairings as described above. See @{"Swiss pairing" Link "Swiss pairing"}. (If you think, this is
     too silly: Draw lots! :-)

  3. If there was a free player until now, modify his data to the data of
     the first new player. (Not needed, of course, if he himself is the
     first. :-)

  4. Enter the new players. The last player should be the one, which gets a
     bye now. (If there is one.)

(Pre)-history
*************

V1.0
     Initial version (1981) of the program, written on an Exidy Sorcerer
     (Operating System CP/M, Z80-processor) in -- Basic. I admit. ;-) All
     data on disk, so the program was rather slow. Rather simple
     algorithms, which has not changed up to version 4.

V2.0
     My first Computer (a C64) needed a new version, written in Assembler.

V3.0
     My first Amiga, an A1000 (Sigh!) got the next version, written using
     AmigaBasic. First version allowing Round-Robin mode.

V4.0
     Using my first C-Compiler (Aztec-C V3.4a) this version was created.

V4.2
     Some suggestions by Frank-Thomas Elpelt: Adding of late players,
     marking players as withdrawn. But the player's needs are raising: Some
     of them flamed the way of handling the colors. (O.k., they have a
     point.)

V5.0
     Running on Kickstart 2.x only GUI created using GadToolsBox (suggested
     by Kai Bolay). Algorithms now as described in the
     `Turnierleiterhandbuch'.  DWZ-ratings introduced. This was a
     beta-version and never released.

V5.1
     International versison using locale.library. Some minor suggestions of
     the beta-testers introduced.

V5.1a
     Minor bugfixes; localizing for Workbench 2.0

V5.2
     User interface now using MUI; ARexx port, setting of games introduced;
     Cross table and player cards available in ascii format

V5.3
     Bugfixes; using some advantages of MUI 2.0; introduced winner- and
     drawpoints

V5.4
     Swiss pairing algorithm completely rewritten; improved speed and
     result quality.

Future of the program
*********************

   Many things could be done: International ranking-systems like USCF or
ELO, Double-Round-Robin-tournaments. The pairing could be done in assembler
to increase the speed.

   But @{i}I@{ui} don't need these changes. I will not introduce them (nore will I
develop the program any more) without feed-back from the users. (Especially
the international rankings couldn't be done without help because I don't
know the algorithms.) So it is in @{i}your@{ui} hands.
