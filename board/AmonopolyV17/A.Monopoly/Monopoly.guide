Please DO NOT use saved game files or saved preferences files from previous
versions with this version.  They are NOT compatible!

If you do it will almost certainly cause an error!


Also, if you need to switch back and forth to the Workbench screen be sure
to use LeftAMIGA+A instead of the usual LeftAMIGA+M and LeftAMIGA+N

@node "intro" "Introduction"

      Why Monopoly?  I've had my Amiga for years but I've seen no good PD
version of Monopoly for it.  Of the two I've seen one wouldn't run at all
and the other wasn't very good.  Not only did it not have any computer
players, it also had two bugs the author knew about (I found another on my
own).  The author stated in the docs that he wasn't going to make a revised
version.  It was written in C and the author welcomed anyone to revise the
code to improve the game.  While I knew nothing about C, I felt I could make
a better game with AmigaBASIC.  My efforts were stalled when I couldn't get
the sprites to appear on the game screen with AmigaBASIC.  After a while I
bought AMOS Professional.  AMOS has plenty of commands for sprites and bobs
and the included sprite editor makes it easy to pluck sprite shapes from any
IFF picture.  It took me a while but this is the result.  I have tried to
make this as good as possible while staying close to the original Monopoly
board game.  Some improvements over the other version: computer players,
pieces that resemble the real things and options for house rules.  I don't
recall seeing multi-color menus in any other program regardless of what
language it was written in.

@node "wn" "What's New"

* New since version 1.6

More countries!  Added French, Italian, German, Swedish, Star Wars and
NASCAR versions

More options!  Added the following options;

   Quick Start - Eack player gets 2 properties at the start.

   Fast Play - Eliminates most delays in games for quicker action.

   Bankrupt To Bank - Bankrupt player's props go back to bank
                      instead of being auctioned.

   Ownership Indicators - Shows who owns what property without having
                          to use the menus.

More Tokens!  Added a moneybag, piggybank and bi-plane.

More Challenging!  Added 'Expert' computer players.

Added 'Load Old Game' from main screen

Player types are now chosen from the main screen instead of having to
  enter 'Amiga' as the name.

An internal change which should make gameplay quicker when there are a lot
  of houses and hotels on the board.

Bug Fix - When using limited houses and hotels, computer players would
          get caught in an infinite loop when no houses were left.

Minor changes to some of the sounds.

@node "hist" "History"
History:

VERSION 1.0  - First version.

VERSION 1.01 - Slight changes in text files and copyright notice.

VERSION 1.02 - Slight change to intro animation.

VERSION 1.4  - 3 big bug fixes involving a 'houses remaining' that wouldn't
               leave, 'press any key to continue' that would accidently roll
               the dice and a bug involving property that would suddenly be
               owned by no-one when someone went bankrupt.

               I also fixed a minor bug which would display a hotel where
               one of the dice should be if you selected "Quit All" from
               the menu before anyone took a turn.

               Enhancements include:

               You now use left mouse button instead of space bar when done
               looking at who owns what properties.
               Now uses point-and-click to answer opening questions.
               You can now save your pre-game settings.
               You can now click on 'OK' or 'CANCEL' to answer Yes or No
               questions.
               You can now click on a property, the dice, or the 'OK' button
               (but not the 'CANCEL' button) to roll the dice.
               You can now use 'CANCEL' to escape from a buy or sell when it
               asks for the selling/buying price.
               Added 'cannon' and 'train' game pieces as seen in the Deluxe
               Monopoly board game.  I didn't want to be left with an odd
               number of pieces so I added a 'Boing' piece too.
               Now shows who owns other properties of the same color group
               (unless the bank owns them) when one property is auctioned.
               When playing with Playmaster rules and there is a Buyback
               with no singly owned properties of the selected color group,
               the word "None" will appear in the same color as the selected
               color group.

VERSION 1.5  - Private release. 2 minor bug fixes. One corrected the grammar
               of "The property you bought mortgaged is".  The other fixed
               a bug where nothing would happen under certain conditions
               when you tried to trade with a computer player.

VERSION 1.6  - Added Intuition style requesters thanks to Peter Gordon's
               'Reqtools.AMOS'.  While testing the requesters I found a
               terrible bug in the 'Load Game' routine (How'd that one get
               by me?).  Anyway I fixed that bug.  This is now an
               International version!  In addition to the standard US
               board names, there are now British and Australian names too.

               I now have an E-mail address!  See @{" Author " link "me"}.

VERSION 1.7  - This version.  Added French, Italian, German, Swedish,
               Star Wars and NASCAR names.  Also you can load an old game
               and choose player types from the main screen.  Also added
               4 more options from the main screen.  Fixed an infinite
               loop bug involving the computer buying houses too.

               This version also has an option for more advanced computer
               players.

Known bugs:  NONE.  Of course I said that all the other times too!  :-)

@endnode

@node "how" "How To Play"

This file assumes you know the rules for Monopoly and only covers
differences for this Amiga version.  If you don't know how to play Monopoly,
read the Offical Rules file.

Differences between this game and Offical Rules:

1) A player can only conduct business such as buying houses BEFORE he rolls
the dice.  If a player rolls doubles he may conduct business before his
extra roll.

2) When a player owes more than he has in cash, he will owe the difference
until his next roll at which time he MUST pay (by mortgaging properties or
selling houses and/or properties if necessary) in full.  If he cannot pay
when his turn arrives, he will be removed from the game and his properties
sold at auction to the highest bidders (or returned to the bank).

3) When properties are auctioned they are auctioned individually, even under
the Playmaster rules.  This also seemed more fair than one person getting up
to a whole set of properties at once.

4) Rent is collected automatically.

Note:  When using the Playmaster rules, a property may never be mortgaged
after it has had a loan called upon it.

Other notes:

You may hit Return to continue from the main screen.

You may hit Return to pick a random playing piece.

In addition to hitting a key you may also click on one of the dice, the 'OK'
button or any property to roll.

A bell indicates when you have doubles and can roll again.  Other bells are
used in other places but they have different tones.

Computer players will NEVER initiate a Buy, Sell, or Trade.  I've included
special routines to keep the computer players from getting taken during a
buy/sell/trade.

In the event of a tie at the end of a game, the winner will be selected at
random.  Unless you quit very early in a game a tie should never happen
though.

When you are asked a question and one of the options is capitalized,
(e.g."Y/n") the one that is capitalized is the default and will be entered
if you hit the RETURN key.  You can now use the 'OK' and 'CANCEL' buttons
for Y or N answers ('OK' is "Y" and 'CANCEL' is "N").  The default for
numeric entries is 0.

If you need to switch back and forth to the Workbench screen be sure to use
LeftAMIGA+A instead of the usual LeftAMIGA+M and LeftAMIGA+N.

You can instantly quit a game (without seeing who won) by hitting "CTRL-C"
except when saving and loading.

When all the players are computer controlled, hold down "Esc" to quit.

@endnode
@node "ats" "Animated Title Screens"

"ANIMATED TITLE SCREENS" - Clicking 'YES' will show you the animated title
screens.

Default is 'NO'.

@endnode
@node "par" "Property Auction Rule"

"PROPERTY AUCTION RULE" - The official rules say that if a person doesn't
want to buy the property he lands on it must be auctioned off.  The one who
refused the property will get the last bid.  If no-one else bids the one who
refused it won't get any bid and the property will go back to the Bank.  If
'NO' is selected then properties will NOT be auctioned if the person who 
lands on it doesn't want it.


During an auction the minimum bids are as follows:

American   $1
British    £1
Australian $1
Star Wars  $1
NASCAR     $1

German    Dm2
Swedish   Kr20
French    Fr100
Italian    £100 

Default is 'YES'.
@endnode
@node "lhh" "Limited Houses And Hotels"

"LIMITED HOUSES AND HOTELS" - Each Monopoly set comes with only 32 houses
and 12 hotels.  According to the official rules, once the houses are gone,
no-one may build more houses until more houses are turned into the Bank. 
The same goes for hotels.  This is intended to make it easier to force other
players into bankruptcy.  Clicking 'NO' will give you unlimited houses and
hotels.

Default is 'YES'.
@endnode
@node "scc" "Sell Out Of Jail Cards To Bank"

"SELL OUT OF JAIL CARDS TO BANK" - The official rules have no provision for
selling Get Out Of Jail Free Cards to the bank.  If you click 'YES' you can
get half what it cost to get out of Jail ($25 in the USA version) from a Get
Out Of Jail Free card from the 'Sell' menu.  If you click 'NO' you can still
sell them to other players for any amount you can get.

Default is 'NO'.
@endnode
@node "fpj" "Free Parking Jackpot"

"FREE PARKING JACKPOT" - The official rules have nothing special for Free
Parking but many people like a jackpot.  Clicking 'YES' will cause money
from Luxury Tax, Income Tax, Chance and Community Chest to be given to the
next person who lands on Free Parking.

Default is 'NO'.
@endnode
@node "pmr" "Playmaster Rules"

"PLAYMASTER RULES" -Selecting 'YES' will add three things:

1) Random auctions of unowned property every 4-6 turns.

2) Buybacks.  After all properties are owned the computer will buyback
singly owned properties of one random color group every 4-6 turns.  The
owners will get the face value of the properties unless they are mortgaged
in which case they will get 1/2 the face value.  The properties will then be
auctioned off one at a time.

3) Loans.  If a player owns all the properties of a color group and none of
them are mortgaged, he may take a loan out on them.  The player will get the
full face value of the properties.  The player must pay back the loan amount
plus 10% sometime after 7 turns.  The player may not pay the loan back early
or late.  Once a property has had a loan on it, it cannot be mortgaged for
the rest of the game - even if the property is sold to another player.  If a
property is sold the new owner is responsible for the loan.

In case you are interested, The Monopoly Playmaster was an electronic device
made by Parker Brothers that was designed to be used in conjunction with a
Monopoly board in order to make the game play faster.  The Playmaster
controlled dice rolls, turns, auctions, buybacks, loans and more. 

Default is 'NO'.
@endnode
@node "qdr" "Quick Dice Rolls"

"QUICK DICE ROLLS" - By default the dice flash some different values to
simulate actual dice rolling.  Selecting 'YES' will just show the single
values.

Default is 'NO'.
@endnode
@node "qst" "Quick Start"

"QUICK START" - Selecting 'YES' will cause 3 things to happen

1)  Each player will get 2 randomly selected properties and pay the normal
    price for them

2)  You only have to buy 3 houses in order to buy a hotel.  The rent for a
    hotel stays the same.

3)  The game ends after the second bankruptcy.  Of course this only has an
    effect if there are 4 players.

Default is 'NO'
@endnode
@node "fpl" "Fast Play"

"FAST PLAY" - Selecting 'YES' will remove most of the delays from the game
increasing playing speed.

Default is 'NO'

@endnode
@node "btb" "Bankrupt Props To Bank"

"BANKRUPT PROPS TO BANK" - Selecting 'YES' will give all properties owned
by a player who quits or goes bankrupt back to the bank.  The next person
who lands on the properties may buy them as if they had never been owned.

Selecting 'NO' means that when a player quits or goes bankrupt, all his
properties will be auctioned off one at a time

Default is 'NO'

@endnode
@node "oin" "Ownership Indicators"

"OWNERSHIP INDICATORS" - Selecting 'YES' will put a small bar next to each
property showing who owns it.  The color of the bar will match the player's
color.

Default is 'NO'

@endnode
@node "hmp" "Players"

Clicking on the player buttons lets you select the number and type of
players.  The button cycles between "Human", "Amiga", "Expert", and "off"

Human  - Human controls the player.
Amiga  - Computer controls the player.
Expert - Computer controls the player, but is harder to beat.
off    - no player.

Any combination may be used, but there must be at least 2 players.

Default is 4 human players.

@node "nc" "NASCAR Version"

In the NASCAR version the properties are named after teams (and tracks)
  in NASCAR.  I believe they are in the order of the 1996 points standings.

For those of you in other countries, "NASCAR" is a form of auto racing
  that's very popular over here.  It stands for National Association of
  Stock Car Automobile Racing.  They race around in stock looking American
  sedans (currently the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Pontiac Grand Prix and the
  Ford Taurus).  The cars originally were showroom stock but they slowly
  evolved over the years into full race cars. The series is very competitive
  as the NASCAR officials do everything they can to keep things even.

You get $200 when you pass Go.

When you land on Black Flag you have a choice of paying $200 or 10%
  of your total assets.

Luxury Suite is $75.

Note:
  Due to space concerns, I had to shorten many of the property names.
  Here is a list of the full names in order:

depending on which option you selected when you started.

@node "int" "International Version"

As you may have noticed, this is an International version.  In addition to
the standard American version, there are also British, Australian, French,
Italian, German, Swedish, Star Wars and NASCAR versions.

The main difference between them are the property names and the property
values.

In the USA, UK, AUS, STARWARS and NASCAR versions you get 200 for passing
"Go".  The FRA and ITA versions are 100 X this (i.e. you get 20000 for
passing "Go").  The German version is 2 X the USA version (400 at "Go") and
the Swedish version is 20 X (4000 at "Go").  All the property values, taxes,
rent, etc increase accordingly.  In other words, the most expensive property
cost the same money you would get by passing "Go" twice, no matter which
version you are playing.

The American, Australian, Star Wars and NASCAR version give you a choice of
paying 200 or 10% of your assets at the first tax (4 spaces after Go).  In
the other versions you must pay what you would get at "Go".

In the American, Star Wars and NASCAR versions the tax near the end of the
board (2 spaces before "Go") is 75.  In the other versions it's 1/2 of what
you'd get at "Go".

During an auction the minimum bids are as follows:

American   $1
British    £1
Australian $1
Star Wars  $1
NASCAR     $1

German    Dm2
Swedish   Kr20
French    Fr100
Italian    £100

being the first to respond, but also providing invaluable information on the
international games.

@{B} If you find any bugs BLAME THEM!  :-)@{UB}

Seriously, if you find any bugs, let me know.


This Monopoly game was written with AMOS Professional and compiled with the
AMOS Professional Compiler.

The game board is from the Ed Musgrove version.  It has been extensively
modified including the color and most of the special spaces like 'Go To
Jail' and the railroads.  In the process of these modifications it was also
changed from a 320X200 IFF file to a 640X200 one.

The game board and play pieces were designed and modified with The Graphics
Studio and Deluxe Paint IV.

The 'load' and 'save' requesters are from an AMOS program by Peter Gordon
called "ReqTools.AMOS" which lets you use the Reqtools.library from AMOS!
It's much easier than trying to use the AMOS Intuition Extension.

The title animations were created with DPaint IV.

The icon for the Monopoly program was taken from the game board using
Workbench's IconEdit.

The icons for the text files are modified Final Copy icons.

@node "me" "Author"

While this program isn't shareware so you aren't required to send money, I
certainly wouldn't refuse any money, blank disks, diamonds, sports cars,
Amiga 4000's, etc... you would like to send.  Good or bad, let me know how
you like it.  Or if you have any suggestions for improvements send them too. 
I'd love to hear from you!

If you'd like the latest version and you don't have access to the Internet,
just send me a blank floppy with a self addressed mailer with proper postage
(so it doesn't cost ME anything) and I'll send the latest version out to
you.  Naturally I'm not responsible for lost or misdirected mail.
