Primiview stands for primitive viewer - it's purpose is to be a simple
SGF viewer/editor. If you want fancy graphics or a graphical user interface
with millions of buttons, this program is not for you.
Primiview is a freak program! It's powerful but has a simple interface, with
which you can work efficiently, if you get used to all the short-cuts.

@node Starting

Installing
----------

Just drag the Primiview drawer to the desired place on your harddisk.
That's it. No assignments or environment-variables have to be set.

If you are short of diskspace you can omit every file but Primiview.
All that is needed is the program itself - 1 file. But I suggest that you
copy the manual too. Might be useful :o)


Starting Primiview
------------------

Primiview can be launched both from WB and CLI.

For CLI users: Primiview needs some stack-space. The maximum stack depends
on the longest tree in a SGF-file (not on the number of variations). Be sure
to set the stack size of the CLI you're using to a proper value. I suggest
you set the stack size to 20000 as I've never had problems with this size.
Once this is done you can enter at the CLI prompt:  primiview [game-file]

WB users should just double-click the icon and the program starts.
The stack size is already preset to 20000 in the icon info.

Primiview searches for two files in the program directory:

"Primiview.prefs" - The preference file with all settings that
 		    may be customized. Select `Save options' from the
		    `Settings' menu to generate this file.

"Primiview.guide" - The Amigaguide documentation of Primiview
		    (If Primiview can't find this file you don't have
		    access to online help)



Programs Requirements
---------------------

Primiview runs on Amiga computers with AmigaOS 3.0 (V39) or better.
There are no plans to modify the program to run on older versions of the OS.

				b) normal board (IGS/NNGS games with kibitz)

	Take snapshot	    -	Snapshots the positions of all OPEN windows
                                (board windows: only the current [last
				active] board window)

        Save options	    -   Saves all the information one can change
				from the settings menu. Also the current
				directory (the last one from which one
				loaded a file) and the file-pattern

@node Score_Mode

Score Mode
----------

The score mode is a powerful tool for scoring games.

It's based on the idea of influence: every stone influences its direct
neighbourhood (up to 3 points in each direction.) The algorithm sums up
all influences radiated and calculates the color of a given point.

Scoring can even be done during fuseki. But don't expect wonders :o)
It works best in the late middlegame and endgame.

You can interact and support this process by mouse.

Clicking the left mouse button (LMB) on

	an alive group -> marks this group as dead. Note that neighbour
			  groups might change their status too. Click
			  on these neighbour groups to achieve your goal.

	a dead group -> marks this group as alive.

	black or white territory -> remove the territory. The algorithm
			detects only trival cases of dame points.

	an empty point -> LMB: add black territory
			  Shift + LMB: add white territory
			  This can be useful to fill any holes - the
			  algorithm automatically fills any completely
			  surrounded area.

Clicking again on the same point or group undos your previous click.

The result is shown in the comment window. There are two values given for
komi - the left one is used for calculation, the right one (in parenthesis)
is the komi text as given in the file. If the values differ please go to
the root node and correct the komi value.

Press `ESC' to leave the score mode.

@endnode


@node SGF_concept
@TOC Edit_Mode

General Concepts:
-----------------

SGF is a text-only tree based file format.
It consists of nodes which are structured in a tree, i.e. a node has
exactly one predecessor called parent, but may have one OR MORE successors
called children. Thus SGF can store game records (a list of moves) and
variations of the actual line of play.

A node is the smallest unit visible to the user, i.e. the user steps through
the tree node-wise (forward [down the tree], backward [up the tree], etc.).

A node consists of properties. These properties contain a certain kind
of information, e.g. the `B[]' property describes a black move made,
the `C[]' property contains a comment text.

For example: if you step forward and see a new move on the board and a
comment in the comment window plus some markup on the board THEN all this
information is represented by different properties which are parts of the
SAME node.

Thus editing is done in two levels: adding/deleting nodes and adding
or deleting properties.

To make it clear: a move is part of a node and not the node part of the
move. A move is represented by ONE property but a node may contain more
than one property.


`Make a Move' vs. `Place a Stone on the Board':
-----------------------------------------------

SGF provides two ways to add new stones to the board:

a) make a move   (SHIFT+LMB)
b) place a stone (CTRL +LMB)

Making a move is like making a move in a real game, i.e. you can only make
moves on empty intersections, you can only make one move per turn
(here: per node) and you may take some prisoners by making a move.

Primiview marks a move with a blue square.

Primiview doesn't check if a move is correct, i.e. you can make a move
which recaptures a ko.

Placing a stone on the board is like setting up a position, e.g.
handicap stones, setting up a problem or analysis of positions ("this
would work if the position over there would look like this...").
Thus one can place MORE than one stone, stones of different colors,
remove stones, replace stones with that of the opposite color
all in one node.
BUT: there are no prisoners made as these are not regular moves!

@endnode

@node SGF_restrictions
@TOC Edit_Mode

Restrictions:
-------------

It is good style (and will be required in future versions of SGF) to
distinguish between a move and the position arrived at by this move.

Primiview therefor DOESN'T ALLOW mixing setup properties and move
properties within the same node.

Move properties are properties such as a black or white move or
annotations (bad move, interesting move, etc.).
Setup properties are properties used to set up or describe a position
such as place black/white stones on the board or annotations like
`black to play'.

Whenever Primiview denies you setting stones, making a move or adding
an annotation you're most likely to try to mix setup and move properties.

There are some SGF files available which contain nodes where mixing
these properties occurs. Primiview denies you to edit these nodes,
unless you delete either the setup or the move properties in these nodes.

@endnode


@node SGF_style
@TOC Edit_Mode

Style:
------

* The first branch (variation `A') is the main branch.
  Variation `A' should always follow the real game.
  Consider yourself viewing a game where you have to press `b' then `c'
  and then `b' again just to follow the real game - disturbing.

* Length of labels: Primiview is able to display labels of any size.
  The current file format allows only 4 chars - that's why Primiview
  doesn't allow the creation of labels longer than 4 chars.
  Attention: some applications have problems displaying labels longer
  than 2 chars. Use long labels with care!

* Omit extra pass plays and empty nodes at the end of the game.
  The last node of the game should contain the last move on the board.
  Do not put game information such as `Black wins and connects Ko' into
  the comment field, rather add another move to the game which connects
  the Ko.

* Use annotations for standard situations (e.g bad move).
  Annotations are represented by extra SGF-properties and these
  property don't contain the text displayed by Primiview, but the meaning,
  i.e. a multilingual viewer could display these annotations in any
  language requested, or computer programs can use this information for
  their calculations.

Edit keyboard commands:
-----------------------

    Shift + `A'	    -	Insert an empty new node as a child of the
			current node. If you start in an empty board
			window (created by the `New' menu item) you have
			to add the root node first in order to edit e.g.
			gameinfo values!
    Shift + `V'	    -	Insert an empty new node as variation
			(may be child or sibling depending on variation mode)
    Shift + `N'	    -	Delete the current node.
			The root node can't be deleted!
    Shift + `T'	    -	Delete the whole subtree starting with the current
			node. The root node can't be deleted!
    Shift + `R'     -	Reorder variations:
			step 1: press `a'-`z' to select a variation
			step 2: press `a'-`z' for variation AFTER which
				the selected variation should be inserted
			If an error occurs (or if you abort the operation
			by doing anything else than pressing these two keys)
			the display beeps.

    Shift + `C'	    -	Enter @{" edit text " Link Edit_Text} mode.
			You may edit the node-name and the comment text.
    Shift + `I'	    -	Enter @{" edit text " Link Edit_Text} mode.
    Shift + `M'		You may edit almost all game info entries.
			Remember to move into the ROOT node (CTRL+CSR up)
			as game info properties are usually stored there.
			Primiview beeps the display if you're not in the root
			node. Some properties have a @{" required format " Link Edit_GameInfo}.

    Shift + `B'	    -	Set the `move color' to BLACK, i.e. the next move

			inserted will be white
    Shift + `P'	    -	Add a pass move (current color).
			Adding is done like adding a normal move
			(see @{" mouse commands " Link Edit_Mouse}).
    Shift + `D'     -	Delete all move properties
			(move annotations get deleted too)

			If the current node DOES contain a move a new child
			node (or variation!) is created	(for easier input
			of game-records/variations.)
			Note that it is forbidden to make a move in the
			root node (as this is bad style.)

    Ctrl + LMB	    -	Place stones on the board (for setting up positions).
			Clicking again undos the placing.

    Alt + LMB	    -	Mark the current position with the chosen markup type.
			Clicking again removes the markup.

    Alt + Shift + LMB - Same as Alt+LMB, but uses a fill algorithm (only
			orthogonal connections - no diagonal connections).
			Using this function you can easily mark a whole
			group of stones or empty territory.

    Annotation

    Annotations are used for making remarks on the current position or
    the move made (e.g. good or bad move). General annotations and move
    annotations may be emphasized.
    In this case Primiview displays `!!' after the text, e.g.
    `Good for Black!!' i.e. `Very good for Black.'

    You can toggle emphasize by selecting the same menu item again.

	Delete		    -	Remove all annotations from the current node

	Good for Black	    -	General remark (something good for black)
	Good for White	    -	General remark (something good for white)

@node Edit_Text
@TOC Edit_mode

Editing Text:
-------------

Editing text is done in the comment window using the edit font, which
is a fixed-width font that may be set via the "Edit font" menu item.
The text editor is a very basic one (no advanced features).

As it is possible to edit more than one value at a time, each value
(e.g. node name, comment text) is given a caption.

You can't edit the caption. If the cursor is over a caption its
color is set to blue. If the cursor is over a editable value its
color is set to red.

Functions:
----------

Cursor keys	- To move around the cursor
Backspace	- Delete the character to the left of the cursor
Del		- Delete the character under the cursor

CTRL + D	- Delete current value
CTRL + R	- Force a redraw of the text display

ESC		- Leave text edit mode and save changes    (OK)
Shift + ESC	- Leave text edit mode and DISCARD changes (cancel)

If you select a menu item, activate a board window, resize a window
or anything similar Primiview exits text edit mode and saves the changes!

SGF defines that some values may hold multiple lines, others must not.
In the latter case Primiview ignores <Enter> and <Return>.

The text editor isn't able to scroll text.
If the text doesn't fit into the window you can't edit it!

If you delete lines the text that is outside the window is NOT scrolled
into the window. You have to force a redraw with CTRL+R.

The text buffer is currently 10 KBytes large.
Any text larger than this gets cut off!

About Go
--------

Go (or WeiQi as it's called in China) is an ancient chinese board game.
It's played using black and white stones, which are set alternately on
the intersections of the board. The aim of the game is to surround as
much territory (empty intersections) as possible. Placed stones must
not be moved. Stones may get captured though.

For more information have a look at the FAQ posted on `rec.games.go' or

have a look at one of the following:

@node ARexx

AREXX 
-----

Since V39.15 Primiview has an AREXX interface. Now you can use Primiview
in combination with a database program to manage your SGF files.

The documentation isn't as good as it should be. When I've more time
I'll improve it. 

	@{" Configuring the ARexx menu " Link RX_menu}
	@{" Supplied scripts           " Link RX_scripts}
	@{" The supplied database file " Link RX_DB}



Command interface
-----------------

	Only a minimal core right now. Just barely enough to do what
	it was designed for in the first place: work together with a
	database program. Other commands will follow in later versions.

	TYPE AREXX means that this is a unique arexx command

	TYPE INTERFACE means that this command is exactly the same
		as the user-interface function. The action taken is
		the same as if the user had selected this function
		manually.

	Every ARexx command returns `0' in case of success and a non-zero
	number in case of an error.
	`RESULT -' therefore means that no extra data is returned. Just the
	return code (in variable RC) for succesfull completion or error.


	@{" GETSCREENNAME " Link RX_getscreenname} - get public screen name
	@{" LISTWINDOWS   " Link RX_listwindows} - get window id, status and name
	@{" LISTBUFFERS   " Link RX_listbuffers} - get buffer status and names

	@{" OPEN          " Link RX_open} - load a file into current window
	@{" CLOSE         " Link RX_close} - close current window

	@{" GOTONODE      " Link RX_gotonode} - goto specified node

	@{" LISTCHILDREN  " Link RX_listchildren} - list children of current node
	@{" GETBOARD      " Link RX_getboard} - get ASCII board

	@{" SAVEOPTIONS   " Link RX_saveoptions} - save current options
	@{" SNAPSHOT      " Link RX_snapshot} - take snapshot
	@{" SWAPSNAPSHOT  " Link RX_swapsnapshot} - swap snapshots
@endnode


@node RX_menu

Configuring the ARexx menu
--------------------------

- select `Save options' from the menu to get the latest version of
  `Primiview.prefs'.

- start a text editor and load `Primiview.prefs'.
  The first line should be: >V: 3901501< (or a higher number)

- goto line 53 and you'll see ten lines with `-x-', where x is a number,
  separated by newlines.

- the `-x-' lines are the text that is displayed in the ARexx menu.
  Change these lines accordingly.

- every line immidiatly following an `-x-' line contains the name of
  the ARexx script which should be executed. Specify the FULL path!

- A preference file might look like this:
	-1-

	-2-

	-3-

	-4-

	-5-

	Add Record
	Go:arexx/add_record.arexx
	-7-

	-8-

	Start DB (GTL)
	Go:arexx/start_db.arexx Go:Go_Teaching_Ladder/DB
	Start DB (pro)
	Go:arexx/start_db.arexx Go:pro/DB

- don't mess with other lines or add new lines!

- save the file and quit and restart Primiview to load the new preferences.

@node RX_scripts

Supplied scripts:
-----------------

The scripts supplied with Primiview are to be used in combination with
the database program called DB. DB was written by David Ekholm and Marcin
Orlowski. You can find the program on AMINET. Download version 3.5 or later.

start_db.arexx
	This script is used to start DB on Primiview's public screen.
	Correct the path of DB in the script to suit your needs.
	This script should be added to your Primiview Arexx menu.

add_record.arexx
	This script adds a new record to the currently open database.
	If you've multiple copies of DB running, the record is added
	to the first DB with ARexx port `DB.1'.
	Note that the script works only with the supplied database
	file or copies thereof - see database file below.
	This script should be added to your Primiview Arexx menu.

open.arexx
	This script is called by DB, if you double-click on the file
	gadget. It loads the file specified in the currently active
	window of Primiview.
	If you've multiple copies of Primiview running, the file is
	loaded into the first Primiview with ARexx port `RX_Primiview'

index.arexx
	This script is used to add a whole directory (including all
	sub-directories) to the database. Note that you've to have both
	Primiview and DB running when you execute this script. You should
	have loaded the supplied database file or a copy thereof into DB
	before you start the script.
	Open a shell and type `rx index.arexx DIRECTORY' where DIRECTORY
	is the !complete! path of the directory you want to index.
	Wait and see.
	Hints:	- to get rid of non-SGF files sort the database by filenames
		  and delete all empty records at the beginning. You can
		  search for files not ending with `.sgf' or `.mgt' too.
		- minimize the goban window and the comment window of
		  Primiview so that updating the windows after loading a
		  file doesn't take too long.
	Speed: I indexed my collection of ~2000 professional games in about
	       20 minutes. I know that this isn't fast, but I hadn't time
	       to add code to suppress Primiview's output.
@endnode

@node RX_DB

The supplied database file `DB':
-------------------------------

The database file supplied with Primiview is to be used in combination with
the database program called DB. DB was written by David Ekholm and Marcin
Orlowski. You can find the program on AMINET. Download version 3.5 or later.

`DB' is an empty database file. It supplies two views for the data: a
standard one and a compact one. When you double-click on the filename gadget
the script `open.arexx' is called and the file is loaded into Primiview.

Make copies of this file for every new database you want to create.
Don't change the order of items in the first and second line or the scripts
won't work anymore.

You've to change the path to `open.arexx' though. Load the file into a
text editor which !preserves! TAB characters.
Go to the end of the second line. Change the RXFILE entry according to
your installation.

You can type your own comments into the `Comment' field and search for them
afterwards. If this isn't enough, you can add new items - refer to the RFF
file format description in the documentation of DB.
Attention: only add new items at the tail of the current item list.
	   Otherwise the scripts won't work correctly.

You may change the views with the view editor of DB.
No limitations here :o)

@node RX_close

   NAME
	CLOSE

   TYPE
	INTERFACE

   SYNOPSIS
	CLOSE FORCE/S,QUIET/S

	If QUIET is not specified, a save-requester opens up if a file has
	been changed, but not saved yet. If QUIET is specified then no
	requester opens and in case of an unsaved file, the function fails
	(RC is set to 5.)
	FORCE should only be used in combination with QUIET and closes the
	current window, no matter if the files have been saved or not.

   RESULTS

@node History

History
-------


V39.15 (Jan 17th 1998)

	- NEW: AREXX interface and scripts for interaction with DB
	- NEW: Score mode
	- NEW: quick gameinfo (shown in comment window)
	- Primiview searches the program directory (instead of the
	  current directory) for `.prefs' and `.guide' now.
	- NEW: `Show Points' - search the comment for points and
	  mark them on the board
	- starting editing is easier now: if there is no node in the
	  buffer, adding a stone by clicking adds the necessary (two)
	  nodes automatically
	- adding moves to root nodes forbidden now (this is bad style)
	- fixed some bugs (check for OS, CTRL+D)


V39.13 (Mar 1st 1997)

	- Edit / Save functionality added (finally!!)
	- Online help (AmigaGuide)
	- Loading multiple files into a window possible
	  (a window may contain more than one SGF buffer)
	- New variation style: variations shown as siblings (XGoban style)
	- New mouse navigation functions (see @{"Commands" Link Key_Usage})
	- New navigation command: "goto root path"
	- Some functions have a new @{" key short-cut " Link Key_Usage}
	- Capture of suicide moves added
	- Removed "Strip Whitespace" menu item: it is done automatically now
	- And bug fixes (as always :)


V39.10 (July 6th 1996)

	- Primiview is able to keep several SGF files open simultaneously. 
	  (New menu-items: New / Close)
	- Board windows are resizable now!! (as in version 0.1 :-)
	- Added support for different goban sizes (9x9, 13x13, etc.)
	- Final reorganization of internal structure: properties of a node
	  are stored as a list instead of a single string.
	- Many new properties recognized. The most important are:
	  WL/BL (w/b time left), TW/TB (w/b territory), LB (board label)
	- New commands:
		Shift + Help = Previous variation
		Alt + Help   = Goto variation `A'
		Shift + Del  = Goto end of current variation
		F-keys :  Pressing twice jumps back to previous position
			  (for easier comparison of two positions)
		(Shift+)Alt+Space = Same as CSR up / CSR down)
		`Strip whitespace' - See `usage' for more info
		`Snap1 <-> Snap2' - See `usage' for more info
	- Primiview is no longer compiled with STACKEXTEND-option
	  as this SAS-routine is buggy. Be sure to increase the stack
	  to a proper size (e.g. 20000) if started from CLI.
	- Bug fixes, minor enhancements, etc.


V39.8 (Mar 31st 1996)

	- Completely recoded SGF-parsing
	  Now Primiview builds up a real TREE-structure!
	- New commands: CSR down, Shift+Space, LMB, next-variation (Help),
        		redraw (<Return>), bookmarks (F-keys),
			goto (`G'), next/prev-comment (Shift+CSR down/up),
			10 nodes forward/backward (Shift + CSR right/left),
			close unnecessary windows (ESC)
	- Placing stones on board added (Shift+LMB)
	- Output in comment & info-window is word-wrapped now
	- Info-window displays more info on a game-file
	- Variation window is kept open and contains:
	  move-description (number, place), number of black and
	  white prisoners and the node number
	- Again: several bug-fixes, some of them were really tough
          to hunt down - but I got'em ;-)
	- And of course a lot of other minor enhancements, too many to
	  list all of them :)


V39.6 (Dec 2nd 1995)

	- Board-window title shows filename
	- Junk in front of the first "( ;" is skipped
	  (no need to remove mail-headers any longer)
	- Variation handling fixed; is now 100% ok (hopefully ;-)
	- CRSR UP command implemented
	- Nodenames in variation window shown
	- Variation-move look ahead
	  (shows first move of each variation)
	- Documentation now in GUIDE-format
	- Tons of bug fixes; compiled with STRICT option; made Primiview
	  a lot safer; Primiview runs without Enforcer-hits (at least
	  on my machine)


V39.4 (May 30th 1995)

	- Made variation window size itself automatically
	- Fixed the hopefully last enforcer hits and the screen
	  scrolling bug. Primiview _should_ no longer guru and now has
	  at least one goto-instruction in source. :-)
	- Fixed the variations-bug. Now variations _should_ work all
	  the time.


V39.0 (May 11th 1995)

	- Primiview TNG aka Primiview 2.0 alpha was released after a
	  couple days of hard work. :-)
          97% of the code was written from scratch - I only copied and
	  modified a couple routines from the old Primiview.


V36.0 (Late 1993-early 1994)

	- The first generation primiview was being coded and released.
	  God it was awfully primitive.

@node Limitations

Limitations
-----------

 - If a node has lots of comments some of them won't fit into the comment
   window and won't be shown. Usually this is no problem, but if you
   review a game with lots of kibitzes some of them may not show up.
   I have NO plans to include any kind of feature to go around this.
   Primiview is primitive. You get what you pay for.
   If this is a problem use larger screen and smaller font. :-)

 - Don't really know what Primiview does if it gets low on memory.
   Better not to find out. :o)

 - Primiview expects a valid, syntactically correct SGF-file.
   Some errors in a SGF-file don't disturb Primiview, others do.
   It may even be possible that an incorrect SGF-file crashes Primiview!


Known Bugs
----------

Currently I'm not aware of any problems using Primiview.
If you discover a bug please don't hesitate to contact me at:

Arno Hollosi <hollosi@sbox.tu-graz.ac.at>

Please don't forget to mention the version of Primiview you're using.
If possible supply the SGF-file and indicate where the error occurs.
Thanks!

@endnode


@node ToDo

ToDo
----

o Support of FF[4] (the latest SGF standard)

o An improved (error-tolerant) SGF parser

o More sophisticated edit functions

o enhance AREXX support

o Improve the look of Primiview (nice goban & stone graphics)

o Database functions (joseki / fuseki / pattern)
