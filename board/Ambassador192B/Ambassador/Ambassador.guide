              Ambassador V1.92ß - Amiga Internet Go Client
    

                Copyright © 1998-1999 Jarkko Lindblad


     Ambassador is a program that allows relatively easy access to the
     Internet Go Server, IGS.  At this stage the program is still in
     developement, however, due to certain developements in my life, I will
     no longer have an internet account.  I will eventually regain
     connection to this alternative universe, but that will take some time.
     So I decided to release this program now so that the remaining
     few Amiga using go players can enjoy their favourite board game on the
     internet.

        Backgroud information

I used AmigaIGC a lot for a few years, played thousands of games, but always found
it lacking in capability. It is a good basic client, but try to observe two games at
once with it.... 
    So, once I knew my internet account would ceace to exist in a short time some
while a go, I decided to write a new IGS client for Amiga.  And here it is.
    It has multiple board windows, lots of gadgets and stuff, and at least at the
time I write this, a whole bunch of bugs and some missing features. But at the
moment it basicly works.

The work name for this masterpiece of programming was AIGC - I much rather have a
real name for a program than a stupid acronym, so the name had to change: first I
though of a stone related game, after all, the game of go is played with stones. The
problem with name like "Stone Age" or "Stonehenge" or "Blackstone" is that none of
those starts with an 'A'. This is after all an Amiga program in a field where most
programs are not Amiga programs. So I needed an A. The next thing I knew was that I
browsed through my "Webster" for wrds starting with "Am"....and there it was -
Ambassador - a high ranking diplomat negotiating with foreign servers for the user.

@node "AvsA" "Ambassador vs. AmigaIGC"
    Advantages over AmigaIGC:

    - Uses bsdsocket library (AmiTCP or compatible), not serial device
    - Multiple board windows (observe 42 games at a time and pray for guru
      meditation)
    - A good scoring mode - it is hard to make an error here
    - Multiple talk windows & multiple match request windows
    - Working and intuitive games- & player list-windows
    - The above windows are automatically updating
    - Much more easy to use
    - Many more features
    - Better looks (at least if you have 32+ color, 800*600 screen)
    - Speech option (or is it crash option...well, speech should be quite
      stable now as I threw asyncronism away...) 
    - Developement continues
    - Score estimation mode
    - All kind of fancy windows, gadgets and stuff...

    Disadvantages over AmigIGC:

    - Likely to be less stable under for example low memory situations
    - Ambassador is less likely to survive changes in IGS protocols or
      transfer errors
    - Only supports boardsize 19
    - Ambassador only works with OS3.x or better
	- Uses a whole damn lot more memory

@node "vaatimukset" "Requirements"

    @{u}Requirements@{uu}

    - OS3.0 or newer required
    - Internet connection via AmiTCP/IP or compatible
    - Fast CPU, AGA/GFX-card, hard disk, etc. recommended
    - if you want sounds, you also need @{i}Upd@{ui}-daemon. You can find it from
      both @{i}Aminet@{ui} and this archive.
    - Xen-font. This is hardcoded into the program. This is likely to change in
      the future. Xen-font can be found from @{i}Aminet@{ui}. Size 9 needed.
    - XHelvetica-font. Also hardcoded. Sizes 11 and 13 needed.


    @{u}Installation@{uu}

    Just drag the program and other files into a directory of your choice.
    Remember to set stack to at least 10kB - I use a 100kB stack!

    Copy the needed fonts into your FONTS: directory - you must get them
    yourself frm the Aminet. As far as I know, they are within the
    MagicWb-package.

   @{i}In order to hear other sounds than DisplayBeeps, you must also install
    Upd daemon. Unpack file Upd140.lha and follow the instructions in that
    archive.@{ui}


    New to IGS?
    -----------

    Before you connect to IGS for the very first time with this client, I
    would use telnet to connect there and read some help files over there.
    Try typing the following command: "help register" - now register an
    account to yourself. After you've received the password, use telnet
    again (always remember the correct port number, which is either 6969 or
    7777 at the time this document is written) and type in the following
    commands:

        toggle client 1
        toggle quiet 0

    Now log out and start the Ambassador with correct parameters and drink
    some good beer or something.

    IMPORTANT: The above information for new users may or may not be needed
    - you can try to use Ambassador from the very start, however I do not
    quarantee that Ambassador does handle everything fine if "toggle client
    1" command has not been previously issued on the IGS. I am just too
    lazy to check if everything is ok.


    @{u}Troubleshooting@{uu}

    There are not too many error messages available so if the program does
    not start up too well, you're probably missing some fonts (Xen 9 and
    XHelvetica 11 & 13) or are out of ram (actually that might crash the
    machine :) or something...

    If the program seems to start up properly, but you see no text on the
    window that opens, then there are net problems. Try again later.
    If your computer is very slow, it can take several seconds before
    Ambassador has performed all the initialization procedures, so don't
    worry about that.

    If you seem to have random problems, try increasing the stack - I've no
    clue about the stack requirements, but 10kB should be enough. I would
    play it safe myself and set it at 50kB or more, as there is some
    recursion in the code, so the program may need a larger stack than usual
    applications.

    One problem can always be memory. Ambassador currently does not do too
    much checking if allocation of memory failed or not, so try to avoid
    low memory condition when usign Ambassador. Be careful if in shortage of
    either kind of memory (chip & fast). A new board window can eat up
    suprisingly large amounts of chip memory, so beware.

    If the games and player list windows do not automatically update themselves
    when you're connected to IGS, you probably do not have correct items
    selected. Try toggling quiet off. See if anything is
    different. You can do this from IGS prefs window. Although, it is also
    possible that there is something wrong with my code since it has not
    been tested too much.

    There are problems with the player list window: usually if the net is
    ok, it seems to work relatively well, however, especially if the net is
    bad, the list may not be totally correct. Also if someone decides not
    to accept games and does "toggle open 0" command (see IGS help files
    for more info on toggle-command), there is no way for your client to
    know about it unless you refresh the whole player list.

    If you try NNGS or some other non-IGS go-server, everytnign may or may
    not work just fine - this program is intended to be used with IGS, so
    if you're a NNGS user, you may or may not be out of luck.

    If your commands to not seem to have any effect (you press some gadget
    and nothing happens), one possible cause is netlag. Even slight netlag
    may be a problem if you have full autoupdating in use, ie. at this time
    you have the IGS flag quiet set false (ie. toggle quiet 0) and have the
    player list open. You have to options: close the window or toggle quiet
    1. Or you can keep going as you are - just click the buttons or
    whatever again and again.


    @{u}Netlag@{uu}

    Netlag is a bigger problem for the Ambassador than it is for some
    simple IGS clients due to it's complexity. The main problem is slowness
    - in addition to slow net, Ambassador will ask IGS to send some data
    more than once, and in some cases, like for example when one begins to 
    observe a game, it is likely that Ambassador will send possibly several
    moves- and status-commands and their output can be very long and very
    very slow if under moderate netlag.

    Also some players/games may not be included in your player list and/or game
    list. In any case, you can always open the RawIO-window from the main
    window's menu to see what's happening if anything. The solution is to
    refresh the player list window every now and then.


    @{u}Usage@{uu}

    At the moment you can only use Ambassador from Shell or Cli and you
    must always provide several (4) parameters.

    @{i}Ambassador <login> <password> <server> <port>@{ui}

    <login>     = your login name. If you've never been to IGS, use guest.
    <password>  = your password. If you're new to IGS, use guest.
    <server>    = igs.joyjoy.net (or whatever the address of the server you
                  plan to use).
    <port>      = 6969 (or whatever the port of the server you plan to use
                  is).

    Example: Ambassador guest guest igs.joyjoy.net 6969

@node "pääikkuna" "Main Window"
This window is the one you see first when you run the program.  The string gadget
in this window is used to send direct commands manually to IGS. If you close this
window, you will quit the program.

@{u}There are the following menus available:@{uu}

@{i}Project/@{ui}
    Connect:        If for some reason you get disconnected from IGS, this
                    will get you back there. At the moment Ambassador quits
                    if the connection suddenly dies.

    Disconnect:     Disconnect from IGS.


    Debug:          Toggles a flag. When the flag is set, everything you
                    write with the gadget in the mainwindow is actually not
                    sent to IGS as usually, but instead it is sent to the
                    internal IGS parser. No normal user should ever need
                    this menu item - actually checking this item can be
                    dangerous.

    Capture:        Toggles a flag. When the flag is set, everything the
                    program reads from the user or from IGS is stored on
                    two files. One file has only the data IGS sends (mainly
                    for local debugging purpouses), the other one has both
                    input and output. This item is not really useful for
                    normal users. If you encounter problems with the IGS
                    parser or something, you can take a snapshot of the
                    problem with this and mail it to me with the bug report.

    Run Capture:    Searches for file "ram:igs.data" and acts as if IGS had
                    sent it. This item is not really useful for normal
                    users, although you can use this and the previous two
                    items to track down bugs if you like to.

    About Ambassador: The most important menu item.

    Quit:           Exits the program.


@{i}Commands/@{ui}
    Player List:    Opens a player list window. You can also open this
                    window by a who command manually from the main window
                    by typing for example "who 3k-5k o". This is however
                    NOT recommended as the internal player list handler can
                    take care of the needs of most users.

    Game List:      Opens a game list window. Can also be open manually
                    just like the player list window.

    Channel List:   Opens a channel list window showing all the channels
                    existing at the moment.

    Help Index:     Tries to open IGS Help Index ("help commands"). You can
                    take advantage of this index by double clicking on
                    commands you'd like to see more information on.
                    Browsing through IGS help files should be relatively easy
                    this way. Help key should also perform the same
                    function.

    Read messages:  You can read messages by selecting this menu item.


@{i}Preferences/@{ui}
    Player List Prefs:
                    Selecting this item allows you to modify the contents
                    of the Player List window.

    Local Prefs:    This item will open a preferences window.

    IGS Prefs:      Select this item to configure your IGS settings. You
                    can only do this if you're connected to IGS. You MUST
                    set these settings. When setting these items, do not
                    hurry as there is little or no buffering in IGS (or in
                    the client) - if you click lots of gadgets in a short
                    period of time, the settings in IGS may end up being
                    different than what you'd think.

    Screen mode:    You can change the screen mode here. You must quit and
                    restart to use the new screen mode. Also you need to
                    save the preferences if you want this to happen.

    Snapshot Windows:
                    In the submenu you can choose which windows you want to
                    snapshot. You must have that kind of window open. If you
                    have multiple such windows, the last one opened is the
                    one that is used by the snapshot routine. Please
                    remember to save the setting after the changes if you
                    want to use them in the future as well. If you snapshot
                    the match window, the contents of it will also be
                    snapped.

    Sounds:         Here you can toggle what kind of sounds you want to hear.
                    If an item is toggled, it is played, if not, then no
                    sound is made when this event happens.

                    Some sound options may not yet be implemented, so don't
                    be surprised if you don't hear some option. Please
                    inform me if you find such item.



            Below are all the sound events explained

            - Talk               : Someone is talking to you with 'tell'
            - Newtalk            : Someone talks to you for the first time
            - Beep               : IGS Beep sound
            - Match              : 
            - Move               : When a move is made, this is played
            - Game Lost          : If you lose a game, this sound gets played
            - Game Won           : If you win a game,...
            - Game Adjourn       : When the game is adjourned, you'll hear this one
            - Say                : If your opponent says something to you...
            - Pass               : When the move is pass, this sound is played
            - Done               :
            - Kibitz             : Sound to play when one 
            - Time Trouble       : If you are in time trouble, you'll hear this
            - Shout              : Regular shout messages play this sound
            - System Shout       : IGS server shouts cause this sound to be played
            - Notify             : All user definable notify events play this
                                   sound when the notify condition is fullfilled
            - Yell               : Sound to play when someone yells.



    Choose Sounds:  Choose sound samples for different sounds. If not set,
                    DisplayBeep() routine is used instead. See
                    @{i}Upd@{ui}-documentation for information on what kind of
                    Samples are ok. After you've chosen a sample, it will
                    be played once to let you choose suitable sounds with
                    ease.

    Speech Options: You can force the program to speak up a bit. Enabling
                    these options may endanger the stability of your
                    computer (even more).

    Use Bad Code:   If you want to have a neat addition to the functionality
                    of string gadgets in the board windows, toggle this
                    option on. However, by doing so, you allow the program
                    to break the conding standards set by Commodore ages ago.
                    If you have problems with some future OS version, turn
                    this one off. At the moment is should be turned on all the time.

    Auto String Activation:
                    If this item is enabled, clicking on a window with the
                    left mouse button will activate the windows string
                    gadget if one exists in the window.

    Word Wrap:      Enables or disables word wrapping for all buffered text
                    output (except for help-window)

    Help Line:      Enables or disables a small help area in the bottom of
                    the window.

    Kill Filtering: If enabled, no one you have defined as "Killed" in the
                    player information window (stats window) will be heard

    Match-Match-Close: If enabled, pressing the Match-button in the Match
                       request window will also close the window. Otherwise
                       the window will stay open.

    Save Settings:  Saves the settings into file "s:ambassador.prefs"

    Save Settings As:
                    Saves the settings into any file. ".prefs" will be
                    appended to the end of the filename if needed.

    Load Settings:  Loads the settings file. Loading settings may cause
                    Ambassador to do something silly in some extreme cases.

@node "lautaikkuna" "Board Window"
This is the window you'll probably use the most. You can observe any number of
games - although at the moment Board window is a SMARTREFRESH-window and chews
up some graphics memory...

You can also play numerous games at the same time if IGS supports it.

Playing a game while observing several others is supported by Ambassador.
It may or may not be supported by IGS.

There are several gadgets and menus in this window as well as some information
areas.

If you do not like the way the gadgets, chat area and the board are laid
out, you can try the other lay out the program provides you with. Try
changing the window size so that the window is wider than it's tall. By
doing that the chat area moves from the bottom of the window to the right
hand side of the window. The positioning of some gadgets also change
depending on which lay out system is used.

The looks of the board window depend on the depth of the screen. With 8
colors you get only simple stones and board, with 16 colors you'll get
slightly better looking board & stones. If you can use 32 colors or more,
the board will be as colourful as possible and the stones will look ok as
well. More colors will only have little effect on how the stones look, and
none on how the board looks.


@{u}Information Areas:@{uu}

Just below the bord there are up to 5 boxes with text or numeric
information.  The first one has the players names in it, second shows how
much time is left, the third one shows how many byo yomi stones there are
to play, or a short line if the player is not yet in byo yomi.  The fourth
one shows number of prisoners, and the fifth one is supposed to show
handicap and komi. If the handicap and/or komi is shown incorrectly, you
can try to set them manually by sending "status <game number>" command to
IGS from the main window.
    If your board window is not wide enough, there will be only 4
information boxes shown.


@{u}Gadgets:@{uu}

In the bottom of the window there is a string gadget - if you are playing,
everything you write here is say'ed to your opponent. In the area above you'll see
what he says. If you're observing a game, the same gadget is used to make kibitzes.
Kibitzes are also shown in the area above the gadget. If you were playing a
game and just finnished it, the same gadget can still be used to talk with
your ex-opponent.

Pass/Done-gadget: if you're scoring a game, this gadget will be a "Done" gadget to
press after you've removed the stones. Above the pass/done-gadget there are three
more gadgets. The slider is used to see the history of this game (you know, the
moves). One of the two gadgets with numbers is used to show the current move, the
other one shows what is the last move shown on the board (=slider position).
You can view the move history not only by using the gadgets, but also by
usign the cursor keys with or without @{i}Shift@{ui} and @{i}Ctrl-keys@{ui}.

The scroller gadget can be used to scroll around the kibitz/say buffer. You
can also use the keyboard for this. Unlike for the other text buffers, you
need to press the @{i}alt@{ui}-key as an extra qualifier with the cursor
keys. Pressing @{i}Shift@{ui}- or @{i}Ctrl@{ui}-keys while pressing the
@{i}Alt@{ui}-key and a cursor key allows you to move arpound the buffer
faster.

If you're observing game, and close the window, you will automatically be removed
from the observation list. The game window may at the moment still pop up
after you've closed the window. Just close it again (...and again and
again...:) or type the unobserve-command manually in the main window before
closing the window.


@{u}Menus:@{uu}

There are thee menus with several items and submenus. Most items are self
explaining, like @{i}Addtime@{ui} which adds time to the opponent. @{i}Show observers@{ui} just sends
'all' command and shows who are the observers of this game. @{i}Ayt@{ui} is used to send
ayt-message ("Are you there") to see if there's lag. If there is no lag, you should
see a simple 'yes' appearing on the bottom of the main window almost
immediately.

@{i}Command Menu@{ui}

Selecting @{i}Thank the opponent@{ui} item sends your opponent a message
you've defines in the Local Preferences window.

@{i}Refresh Board@{ui} refreshes the board. You should not need this. It does not send a
moves-command or anything like that to IGS, but instead just refreshes all the moves
made so far from internal buffer.

@{i}Score Estimation@{ui} toggle score estimation mode on or off. If
toggled on, you will see the board divided into spheres of influence, and
you will be informed of the current score (or what Ambassador estimates it
to be - sometimes it is 100% correct, sometimes not. Life is tough.

@{i}Force win on time@{ui} sends command "refresh" to IGS - if you or your oponent in on
negative time, the game will end with this command. If not, nothing will
happen.

@{i}Adjourn@{ui} asks for adjourning. @{i}Undo@{ui} undoes, and @{i}resign@{ui} is for those times you don't
think you're going to win.

@{i}Save Game@{ui} is used if you'd like to save the game as a SGF-file.
You can investigate these files afterwards by using for example Primiview
(© by Arno Hollosi and me).



@{i}The Black & White Menus@{ui} have sevral items with which you can
easily get information on the players playing the game.


@{u}Board:@{uu}

Moves are made by clicking on the board.

If you're observing, clicking adds the coordinates into the string gadget. If you
have allowed bad programming, the cursor will also move to reflect this. To do this
certain programming guideline is violated, so future OS versions may not be compatible
with this kludge.  When playing, you need to press shift while you press the left
mouse button.

If you're observing and make shift-click, a bet-command with the
coordinates is send to IGS - see IGS help file 'bet'.

@node "juttelu" "Talk Window"
This is for chatting with friends. It opens whenever someone talks to you or if you
select someone in the player list-window and decide to talk.

The string gadget sends your messages to the opponent in question, the small buttons
'M', 'A' and '?' are there to make your life a bit easier.

The 'M' button opens a match window and gives you a chance to match the opponent
with the parameters you decide.

The 'A' button challenges your opponents with the 'automatch' command.

The last button at the moment only asks for the players stats - after it
has received the information from IGS, it opens a stats window.
will open an information window.

@node "matsi" "Match Window"
This window is opened when you challenge someone to match you by pressing a button,
or if someone else matches you.  If someone automatches you an automatch (of course
unimplemented as of now) window will open. At the moment automatches, tem games etc.
must be started manually.

You can change the parameters by clicking on the gadgets. The one parameter you can
not change is the board size since Ambassador so far only supports board size of
19x19.

After you've set the parameters you can set (time, byo yomi time, color), you can do
three of four things. You can close the window which essentially is a quiet decline
- your opponent will receive no messages from this. If you select the @{i}match gadget@{ui},
you will either ask for a match or accept a match offer. If you press the @{i}info
button@{ui}, you'll see stats of the opponent. (in the future a player information window
will open.) If the @{i}decline button@{ui} is not shadowed, you can decline a match offer of
somebody.

@node "kukakohan" "Player List Window"
The Player List window can be opened in two different ways. You can either type a who
command manually in the main window, or you can select menuitem from the main
menu. The latter method is recommended.

In the window you see a big list of names - for explanations of the symbols next to
the names, please see IGS documentation for the who command (type "help who"). If
you press the left mousebutton on this list, you'll select a player, and afer that
you can press any of the buttons on the bottom of the window. The buttons are quite
self explaining. You can challenge someone too a match, open a talk window to talk
to someone, or you can get some information on the person in question. Please always
ask for a game before matching if the opponent seems to understand any
language you write.

If you want to see only only for example those players who are open for
match requests and are between 4 kyu and 17 kyu, you should open the Player
List Prefs window using the main window's manu.

@node "pelit" "Games Window"
The Game window is very simple one. You can open it from a menu or by typing a
games command manually in the main window

The window itself has one one big list of games and if you click your mouse over one
of them, a board window will open and you'll start observing the game.

@node "äänestä" "About Sound"
I suggest you install @{i}Upd@{ui}. Without @{i}Upd@{ui} you will only hear DisplayBeeps (unless you
disable all sound, of course). With @{i}Upd@{ui} you can easily set which samples should be
used for what actions. As far as I know @{i}Upd@{ui} only understands 8SVX samples. The sound
samples you must get by yourselves.

If several sounds are to be played at the same time, only one of them will
be played. If a new sound is to be played, and another one is playing, the
old sound will be interrupted. Sound playing is totally asyncrnous to the
rest of the program, so you can play big samples w/o stopping the program.

You will find @{i}Upd@{ui} archive in this archive.  Some suitable samples can be found from
ftp.nuri.net in AmigaIGC's add-on archive. You can also find @{i}Upd@{ui} from
@{i}Aminet@{ui}.

@{b}Upd is © 1991-1994 Jonas Petersson & Absolut Software (aka Sirius Soft).@{ub} Ask
him/them if you want to know more about it.

Ambassador is also capable of producing speech output if you have both the
translator.library and the narrator.device. Any version should be ok. You
can select the speech options from the main menu, however, speech is mainly
there for kicks, and is likely to be buggy, so beware...

@node "pukit" "Bugs"
There are bugs in this program.

Some bugs I know

    - One has to activate the window of which gadgets one want help on. With
      V39 WA_HelpGroup one should be able to group many windows into a
      common help group so that activating any of those windows would be
      enough to enable getting help from any gadget on any window belonging
      to that group. However.... the damn OS3.x is buggy. In principle all
      this works nicely, but activating a string gadget and moving mouse
      over another window in the same help group "transfers" the editing of
      the string into another window! Relly annoying...

    - When you do a 'time' command and are in negative time (for example a
      player is just going to byo yomi for the first time), the contets of
      the time information area are not updated properly. This is not
      serious since the next move will correct things. I have no idea why
      you'd like to use the 'time' command as it is totally unnecessary, so
      this will probably never be fixed.

    - String gadget clears up when a window is resized. Probably will not
      fix this one any time soon unless someone asks me to :)

    - If you have very large board window with v-e-r-y large stones and
      you use deeper than 8 color screen, rendering of the stones will fail.
      This will probably be fixed someday, but since this problem can only
      occur if you use screen with more than about 2000 pixels in either
      direction, I probably won't be in any hurry to fix it. If you'd like
      to use such screen mode, let me know and I'll fix the bug.

    - If you are running under low memory conditions, anything can happen.
      I have added some support for low memory situations, but still, as I
      said, anything can (and usually will) happen. If you have a pathetic
      system you can always use AmigaIGC instead...:)

    - At least the compilers resource tracking features dislike using
      translator.library, possibly narrator.device as well, so don't
      be surprised if something breaks. Seech output is at the moment
      syncronous as the machine seems to became very unstable is I enable
      asyncronous speech. 2.0 narrator might work better, but as I don't
      have it, I don't dare to enable asyncronous speech. (in the future I
      may launch a separatetask to take care of this, but I am so lazy...)

    - I would not try to exit Ambassador while some other utilities have
      windows open on the same screen. I have no idea what will happen if
      you do this.

    - If you have activated the Player list window's listview-gadget (ie.
      chosen a player), and (s)he suddenly logs out, instead of
      deactivating the gadget, the active item will now be the topmost item
      in the list.

    - Player information storing and statistics code have a serious bug. It
      thinks that players PERKELE ja perkele are the same. I'll fix this
      someday.


If you find others (it @{u}is@{uu} likely), you can try to @{"contact me" link "author" 0} although I know it is

@node "tehtävää" "Todo"

    From now on I will put this project into freezer for a while - I will
    only do bug fixing and possibly add some features I need myself or
    if I really like some idea tossed at me.

    o Bugfixing
        * This I will try to do when ever I get bug reports

    o History for string gadgets
        * I don't need this - I use a snapping program if I need to repeat
          some strings. Low priority.

    o Buffer for the main window
        * Is this really needed? I don't need it. Low priority.

    o More items for local preferences window
        * I will try to add some minor graphics options page

    o Font independend windows
        * Low priority - although most if not all rendering is already font
          sensitive, there is still some work left (defining window sizes),
          and I really have more interesting projects to do than this.

    o Wb compability
        * Icon compability (tool types?)
        * Ability to open the windows on WB-screen.
        * Neither is important to me, so....

    o ARexx
        * This is the most interesting ToDo-item, however it is a heck of a
          lot work and studying for me and I am very lazy, so it has a low
          priority.


If you have any ideas, I'd like to hear about them. @{"Contact me" link "author" 0} if you feel like
you're missing some features or some nasty (Ambassador related :) bug is
bothering you.

@node "tekniikka" "Techical information"

If you would like to see for example better looking board and stone
graphics, mail me your alternatives and I'll see what I can do. However,
Ambassador always allocates 8 colors for gadgets, text, etc., so if you
want to have pretty board & stones on a 16 color screen, you can only set 8
colors into whatever you wish to. 

The board data should be 159 pixels wide, and the height should be 290 pixels.
The stones are both 101*101 pixels in size. The board data should be
seamless.

I'd like to thank Bob Carter for being a patient beta tester - I hope
his machine hasn't crashed too often with these never ending betas.
