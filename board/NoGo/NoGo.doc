0. Introduction
---------------
Go is a very old Asian board game. Although the rules are very simple, the
game can be very interesting and difficult. Of course Go is most enjoyable
when played against a human opponent. But finding a playing partner is
sometimes difficult, so I started searching a computer program playing Go.
I found AmiGo, GNUGo and Wally from which the last was supposed to be the
strongest. Unfortunately it had no GUI and was not much fun to play. So I
started writing a MUI-GUI. I have to say that Wally is still a very weak
player and games are only interesting if you give him handicap stones.

1. Requirements
---------------
NoGo should run on any Amiga with MUI installed.

2. Usage
--------
Starting the game from Workbench or Shell should be straight forward :-)
The meaning of the menu items should also be clear, but a few notes have to
be made:

o Wally always begins the game (to get a little advantage)

o Handicap stones are only possible on 9x9, 13x13 and 19x19 boards

o Wally is much better on smaller boards

o At the end of the game you will be asked to remove dead stones and fill
  the neutral points (the computer trusts you, so don't cheat here)

4. Future
---------

o GNUGo is much better structured than Wally and I think about giving
  GNUGo 1.2 the same MUI-GUI. Including the source code will be more
  likely then.

o Of course it would be nice if the program would be a stronger player.

o Bill Newman (newman@tcgould.TN.CORNELL.EDU) for the original wally.c
  whom I was unable to reach. 

o Stefan Stuntz for MUI, which makes programming a lot easier.

o SAS for still supporting the Amiga
