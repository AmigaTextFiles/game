@NODE int " Introduction "

The goal of this game is to place 4 stones horizontaly, verticaly or diagonaly
in one row.
You play against Amiga while both players set their stones by turns.
The winner is the one who manages to set 4 stones in a row first.
If all fields are occupied by stones and nobody has 4 stones in one row then its a
draw game. You only can play on the bottom of the playfield or on top of another
stone, because the stones "fall" down.

@NODE how "How to play ? "

When you have startet "4 Wins" a requester opens. Please register yourself for
free by sending an E-Mail to me and receive a keyfile to avoid the appearing of
the requester.

After closing the requester there is the main window. Please select a level from
the menu. I suggest 2 or 3 for the beginning.
Then you have to select "New game" from the project menu.
Now you can set your "stone" by clicking gadgets 1-7. When you did so Amiga will
start thinking and after a while set its stone. Thinking may be aborted by
pressing esc.

Read "Introduction" for the rules.

@ENDNODE

@NODE req "Requirements "

Nothing special. Just AmigaDOS 2.04 and "reqtools.library" for the requesters.

@NODE tech "Technical"

Sadly I must say that my game plays not as strong as I would like :)
I am not quite sure why because I am using a rather complex valuation of the
playfield. Maybe I should not.
As you might have guessed the game chooses its move by minimax algorythm. But
because of total lazyness I am not prunning the tree by alpha-beta, but I am planning
to implement one.
I think this could speed up thinking by factors and game level will be improved
by that.

Game level represents search depth. That means if you select level 5 Amiga will
calculate 16807 possible situations.

@NODE auth "Last words "

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any ideas for improving this game. I
know that there is very much I can do such as Amiga-Amiga playing, saving games,
improving game level ... and much more. But I wont do anything if there is nobody
interested in.
So if you are interested in further versions: say it.
