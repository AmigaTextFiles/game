Solit is a card game that consists of 18 stacks of cards:  4 ace stacks, 4
temporary stacks and 10 card stacks.  The game starts by dealing all 52
cards out and placing 1 card in two of the temp stacks and then five cards
and each of the 10 card stacks.  The goal of the game is to get all the
cards in the ace stacks by suite in ascending order.

Cards may be moved with the following restrictions:

   1)  only one card may be moved at a time from one of the temp stacks or
       from the bottom of one of the card stacks

   2)  cards may be added to the card stacks as long as they are in the same
       suite as the bottom card and are the next card in descending order
       (i.e., a 9 of hearts can be placed on a 10 of hearts but not on a 8
       of hearts or 3 of diamonds)

   3)  kings may be moved to empty card stacks

   4)  only one card may be placed on each of the temp stacks

Cards are moved by pointing to them with the cursor and pressing and
holding the left mouse button.  Cards are placed on a new stack by moving
the card to that stack with the mouse and then releasing the left button.
The card with either be added to the new stack, or, if the move is illegal,
it will jump back to its original position.  Multiple cards in a run of the
same suite may be moved if spots are available in the temp stacks to place
the extra cards.  This eliminates the hassle of moving the cards to the temp
stacks, moving the bottom card and moving the cards back from the temp
stacks.

For the convenience of the player, the computer manages the ace stacks.
After every move and at the start of the game, the computer scans all the
cards and checks to see if any cards may be moved to the ace stacks, if so,
it automatically does.  So, for example, if an ace is uncovered by moving
the card on top of it to a temp stack, say, the ace will automatically move
to its preordained position on one of the ace stacks.  If the two of the
same suite as the ace is visible, it will also move to be on top of the ace.

The strategy of the game, therefore, is to uncover the aces as soon as
possible so cards are removed from play quickly.  Then, using the temp
stacks as temporary storage area, the cards are jockeyed around into runs
of particular suites.  Note that, although any card may be placed on a temp
stack, they can only be returned to the card stacks subject to rule #2
above.

Finally, note that some shufflings of the cards may produce situations in
which it is impossible to win.  Also, bad choices of card movements can
also make the game impossible to win.  For example, placing a run of 5 or
more cards of a suite on top of a lesser card of the same suite (e.g.,
placing the run of king of hearts through 9 of hearts on top of the 8 of
hearts) will make the game impossible to win.  In these cases, use the
"Restart" menu option to restart the game or just give up and quit.
