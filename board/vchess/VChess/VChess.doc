  This release of  VChess  is  again  freely  distributable.  Permission  is
  granted to include this package in free "Public-Domain"- collections, like
  the good old Fred  Fish's  Amiga  FD-Disk  Library  or  the  great  german
  "Berliner Spielekiste". The prefered way of distribution is by AmiNet  and
  other free FTP-Servers!

  Distribution of VChess is only allowed if  the  following  conditions  are
  fulfilled:

  All these files must  remain  unmodified.  None  of  these  files  may  be
  distributed on its own, the entire package must be distributed together.

  (It is allowed to archive these files  with  archiving-programs  like  LHA
  (© Stefan Boberg) if it is possible to retrieve the files from the archive
  in their original state.)

  The complete package may be (in archived form) uploaded to Bulletin  Board
  Systems or FTP servers.

  PD-dealers and other people who want to distribute VChess are only allowed
  to take money for the floppy disk and copying  efforts.  Nobody  may  take
  more than $3(US) or DM 4 for the disk with VChess. This is also  valid  if
  there is other software besides VChess on the Disk.

  The distribution of VChess in "Software Packages"  (more  than  one  disk)
  together with other Software is only allowed with my written permission.

  The distribution of VChess on CD-ROM is only allowed if the price  of  the
  CD-ROM in not greater than US$0.2 per megabyte. This  means,  that  nobody
  may sell a CD-ROM containing VChess and 100 Megabytes  of  other  software
  for a price greater than US$20.

  Distribution of VChess together with commercial software is forbidden.

  Distribution of VChess 4.1 on "Coverdisk" of Computer  magazines  is only
  allowed with my written permission!

  (Some Computer-Magazines put older releases of VChess on their  coverdisc,
  without  asking me for permission. And they don't gave me anything for it.
  I will not tolerate any more, that magazines make so much  money  with  my
  work.  I know that they make much money, because some weeks ago a magazine
  called me and offered 2000 DM for using release 4.0  on  their  Coverdisc.
  But  please  regard  this:  If  you  should  get  release  4.1 from such a
  coverdisk, you can suppose that they gave me some money for it.  But  this
  means  not  that  release  4.1  is  commercial software now! VChess 4.1 is
  freely distributable, it is your decision if you take it from a coverdisk,
  or  free  of charge from AmiNet or friends! So even people, who got VChess
  from an expensive Coverdisk, have to pay their shareware-contribution.)

  Of course it is reserved for me to forbid single companies or persons  the
  distribution of VChess.

  Starting with release 4.0 it is forbidden for  the  following  persons  or
  companies to sell or distribute VChess:

  They put my VChess 3.5 on their Time 493 disk.
  On their disk is following text:
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Diese TIME kostet DM 5.--. Verschiedene Autoren/Programmierer sind/werden
  finanziell beteiligt,  so daß andere Händler bitte ebenfalls diesen Preis
  berücksichtigen mögen.
  Eine Kopiergebühr unter DM 5.- (incl. Disk) ist zwar aus Wettbewerbssicht
  sicherlich überlegenswert,  doch damit werden die Autoren um Ihren Anteil
  betrogen ..., während ein Preis über DM 5.- die Bezahlung etwaiger Share-
  ware-Gebühren an die Autoren beeinträchtigen dürfte.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Some people read this  text  and  thought  that  I  got  money  from  this
  company! This is not true, they just sended me 4 disk of their time-disks.
   
  User of VChess should regard this: An empty Floppy-Disk  costs  less  than
  US$1, and copying VChess takes less than two minutes.  If  you  paid  more
  than US$2 for the disk with VChess, then this was quite expensive. But  if
  you have paid more than US$3, this was too much. Try  to  get  your  money
  back, and tell me about it.

What is new in release 4.1 ?
============================

  Release 4.1 is a bugfix for  release  4.0  and  4.0a.  With  V4.0  it  was
  possible  to  load  old  V3.5  games, and to save the game in the new V4.0
  format. But then it was impossible to load the game again. This  is  fixed
  now.  Additional,  there  was  an  very ugly bug in all former releases of
  VChess. I discovered this bug in late November 1996 for  the  first  time.
  This  bug  causes  a memory-corruption after termination of VChess in very
  rare and special cases. It was very difficul to fix this bug, but  now  it
  is fixed. The reason for this bug was this: While termination of VChess, I
  called DeleteLayer() to free an used layer, and direct after this I called
  FreeRaster()  to deallocate the BitPlanes of this layer. But DeleteLayer()
  V40.1 uses the blitter to clear the planes of the layer. So it occured  in
  very  special  cases,  that  the  CPU deallocates the BitPlanes, while the
  blitter was clearing it. This can give memory-problems,  lost  of  chipmem
  and  GURU  0100000C  (Sanity check on memory list failed during AvailMem).
  There must be a WaitBlit() between DeleteLayer() and FreeRaster()!

  There are no other differences between V4.0 and V4.1.

What is new in release 4.0 ?
============================
   
  There are a lot of improvements: Opening-Library and saving  of  Games  is
  fully rewritten. Now the Opening-library takes less space on Disk  and  in
  RAM, and is more powerful. You can assign a quality (!!,!,!? and ?) and  a
  textual comment to single moves. You can use a new String-Window  to  type
  in moves instead using the mouse.  Computer  can  take  advantage  of  the
  thinking-time of the human player, so often the computer may do  his  move
  at once. Pieces are beamed (© by Scotty) from one  square  to  the  other.
  Custom sounds can be played if datatype-library is  available.  Games  are
  saved in a new,  more  compact  format,  which  needs  only  2  bytes  per
  halfmove. This means, that most games takes not more  than  400  Bytes  on
  disk, and are stored on one  single  disk-sector.  There  are  again  some
  modifications in the  playing-algorithm,  I  hope  playing-strength  is  a
  little bit improved, but I am not sure.

  But there are some disadvantages in this  release  too:  In  the  last  12
  months I got only 8 new registrations.  This  is  too  many  to  cover  my
  expenses. So I wrote this release more for myself and some friends of mine
  than for the public. To not waste too much time, I have produced  only  an
  english  documentation  and  english  program-text.  (And   this   english
  documentation may contain very strange sentences!) Locale-library is still
  supported, but I have not updated the german catalog, and I have not asked
  the authors of the other catalogs to adapt their  catalogs.  Further  this
  release in not tested very well. I was not ready to waste a dozen of hours
  for testing it, and I have distributed only a few  betarelease  of  Vchess
  4.1 to waste not too much postage. This release has many new features,  it
  takes much time to test all of them. Now the  sourcecode  has  a  size  of
  600k, and the structure of the source-code is not very  simple.  There  is
  much room for bugs to hide! If you find bugs, and you want that this  bugs
  will be fixed, than you should send me a note.

  Opening-library, Games and Configurations have  a  new  format  now.  This
  release can load  Games  stored  with  releaee  3.5,  and  can  import  an
  Opening-library stored with VChess 3.5. This  release  can  not  load  old
  configurations - but it is really not much work to create a new  one.  (In
  release 3.5 there was a little bug: When saving a game, an  empty  comment
  was not accepted. This gave trouble, when a game was saved and loaded many
  times. This is fixed now, release 4.1 can load these games again.)

  Additional there may be again a greater  Opening-Library  created  by  Uwe
  Zedtler in this package. This big library is copyright by Uwe Zedtler, and
  Shareware. For more information about this library see  the  documentation
  of that package. Till now I have not used this large library, but I  guess
  that it may be useful for strong players. To use it, just replace my small
  library with that large one. To say it again: This large library is  ©  by
  Uwe Zedtler, I may have only included it (with permission of Uwe  Zedtler)
  in this package. If this library is not part of  this  package,  then  you
  should find it in AmiNet,I guess the name is game/board/VChessOpenings.lha.

Introduction
============
   
  VChess   is   written   fully   in   Oberon   language   (with    a    few
  Assembler-routines), and was developed on an Amiga 3000 using Amiga Oberon
  V 3.11d   (© Fridtjof Siebert).   With   the   help   of   OS 2.0   (3.1),
  ReqTools.library and Amiga-Oberon, I have produced a compact, powerful and
  easy to use program. To run this program, you need an Amiga with OS 2.0 or
  greater,   and   additional   the    ReqTools.library.    ReqTools.library
  (© Nico Francois,Magnus Holmgren) is  not  part  of  this  package,  every
  serious Amiga user should possess it. If  not,  take  a  look  to  AmiNet.
  Please note that there exists a Preferences-Editor  for  ReqTools.library.
  You can use this Editor (not part of this package) to modify the behaviour
  of the ReqTools.library. VChess needs not very much memory. With  a  small
  Opening-Library it should be possible to use VChess on an Amiga with  only
  1MB. The stacksize should be at least 8k, but if you  have  any  problems,
  try a larger stack. The Opening-library uses recursion, so a large library
  may need a larger stack.

Installation
============
   
  Copy, if not already installed, the ReqTools.library  to  LIBS:.  This  is
  all. Now you can start VChess from Workbench  with  Double-Click.  If  you
  want to install VChess on your hard disk, it is best  to  copy  the  whole
  VChess-Drawer  to  hard   disk,   because   this   drawer   contains   the
  Opening-Library and other things. VChess can use  Catalog-files  to  adapt
  itself  to  other  languages  than  English.  VChess  searches  for  these
  catalogfiles in PROGDIR:Catalogs/language. Where PROGDIR: is the directory
  in which VChess resides. If, for example, your  preferred  system-language
  is        "deutsch",         then         VChess         will         load
  "PROGDIR:Catalogs/deutsch/VChess.catalog". You can copy the catalogfile to
  LOCALE:catalogs/language, VChess will find it there too, but I think  it's
  better to leave the catalogfiles in the VChess-Drawer. (You can use VChess
  without its VChess-Drawer,  but  this  is  not  recommended  because  many
  additional files like the opening-library, saved games, Icons  and  so  on
  belong to VChess.)

Starting VChess
===============
   
  The easiest way to start VChess is with a Double-Click on its Icon. But of
  course you can start it from Shell by typing its name  and  then  pressing
  the <Return>-Key. (VChess needs no  parameters.)  If  there  is  the  file
  VChess.config or Configs/VChess.config in the Drawer of VChess,  then  the
  program uses this file for the startup-configuration,  otherwise  defaults
  are used. It is possible to make VChess resident  with  the  shell-command
  RESIDENT. This can be useful for a few people,  who  need  more  than  one
  board. For example type in the shell

  STACK 12000
  CD VChess
  RESIDENT VChess
  RUN VChess
  RUN VChess
   
  to get two boards without wasting too much memory. This is not very  nice,
  because both boards appear at the same position, and you have to save  and
  load a game to exchange games, but it is possible. And most  players  will
  only need one board!

First Steps
===========
   
  Before you go on reading this text, it is better to start VChess  now  and
  try it out. When the program has started, you can see  five  windows.  The
  big one with the chessboard is the main-window. The other windows are only
  help-windows for showing some information. If one of these five windows is
  active, then you can press the right mousebutton to take  a  look  on  the
  Pulldown-Menu. (Don't be sad if the display looks ugly at this time.  Many
  things like colors, fonts  and  screen-resolution  can  be  changed.)  Now
  select the menuitem "Config/Reset to defaults" to reset all adjustments to
  defaults. Start the game by selecting "Project/NewGame". Now you play with
  the white pieces against the computer. To move a piece, simply click on it
  with the left mousebutton. (To click means:  Move  the  pointer  over  the
  chessman, and then press and release the left mousebutton.) Now this piece
  is marked. Now click on the destination-square. If this was a legal  move,
  the piece will move from source to  destination,  and  the  computer  will
  answer with its move. Now it's again your turn, and so on. Don't  hesitate
  to test some of the menu-functions. The meaning of most of them should  be
  clear, just try it out. Of course you can re-size the  windows,  or  close
  the helpwindows.

Shareware-Contribution
======================
   
  I started the development of VChess in summer 1992, and  now  in  December
  1996 version 4.1 is finally (nearly) finished. I guess, that this  program
  took more than 2000 hours of work till now. I think you  can  imagine  how
  much  money  the  development  of  this  program   would   have   cost   a
  software-company, or how much money I could have earned  if  I  had  spent
  this  time  somewhere  else.  And  last  not  least  the  costs  that  the
  development of software causes are not negligeable.

  At the beginning I planed to sell VChess in a commercial way. But  because
  even with a commercial distribution it is not secure that the author  gets
  a justified amount of money for his work, I decided to  distribute  VChess
  as Shareware. Shareware means, that the program can be freely  copied,  so
  that everyone can get it (nearly) free of charge from friends,  PD-Dealers
  or by BBS-Systems. But when you like the program, and you want  to  go  on
  using it, you have to send a donation to the  author.(  Some  people  call
  this sort of software giftware)

  VChess 4.1  is  true  shareware  again.  This  means  that  there  are  no
  restrictions in this version. I emphasize this, because many authors  have
  decided to release only restricted versions of their software  for  freely
  distribution. But there are no restrictions in VChess 4.1. This means that
  you can test all functions of VChess, and you  don't  have  to  wait  many
  weeks after paying the contribution to get the  fully  functional  version
  from the author. And I have the advantage that I  save  some  mailing-work
  and postage.

  So if you like VChess and want to go on using it,  please  send  US$15  or
  DM20 to the following address:

                               Stefan Salewski
                                Stolper Weg 3

                           D-21680 Stade (Germany)

  Please compare this address with the text that you can see if  you  select
  the  menuitem  "Project/About".  If  there  are  any  differences  in  the
  addresses, this means that somebody has  made  illegal  modifications.  In
  this case try to get a clean, unmodified version of VChess. If you live in
  Germany, you can send me a "Verrechnungsscheck" or make  an  "Überweisung"
  to:

                            Stadt-Sparkasse Stade
                            Bankleitzahl 24151005
                              Kontonummer 823864

  Otherwise I think the best way is if you send me the money in cash. It may
  be possible to send an EuroCheck (only in DM !) or to send me the money by
  postal money order. (But it is  impossible  for  me  to  cash  in  foreign
  checks, even if the amount is in DM. I got a check from  an  English  bank
  (DM 20), but I had to send it back because the banks in Stade charge DM 27
  to cash it in.)

  All people, who send me the contribution, will get a postcard,  letter  or
  EMail from me, so that they know that I  really  got  the  money.  If  you
  should not get this notification after  six  weeks,  then  something  went
  wrong. (Please don't forget to give me your FULL postal address.)

Playing-Strength
================
   
  Of  course  it  is  a  big  difference  if  you  play  with  a  68000-  or
  68060-processor. On my A3000 I lose most games against the computer, if  I
  play with fair conditions. Fair conditions means, that I don't  take  back
  moves, and that I don't use more thinking-time than the computer. I  can't
  make precise statements about it, because I have too many possibilities to
  compare VChess with. The playing-strength of  version  2.0  was  not  very
  great, but I think that in Version 4.1 the playing-strength  is  not  bad.
  The playing-algorithm is completely a  development  of  my  own,  I  spent
  approximately 1000 hours on it. I guess that  other  people  thought  more
  about it. The best way is if you test  the  playing-strength  yourself.  I
  think, if you lose more than 50% of all games, then  the  playing-strength
  is big enough for you. Note: If you lost nearly every game,  it  would  be
  very frustrating. Of course, if the playing-strength  was  very  high,  it
  would be possible to degrade it artificially. But if you won  against  the
  computer, you know that the computer  have  played  intentional  bad,  you
  would  not  be  so  glad  about  your  win.  If   you   think   that   the
  playing-strength is too low, you can tell me. If many people think  so,  I
  will try to  increase  it.  For  my  own  games  the  playing-strength  is
  currently big enough. (Sometimes it may occur that the  computer  make  an
  obviously bad move. This can happen for example, if the  thinking-time  is
  short, so that the computer can't see an imminent attack of his  opponent.
  In this case you can do this: Select a longer thinking-time (for this move
  only), and then select Extras/Undo last Move from menu. Now  the  computer
  will take back his bad move. Using a longer thinking-time, he will find  a
  better move in most cases. Now you can use the  smaller  time  again.  For
  example, I use 30 seconds thinking-time on my A3000. If I notice, that the
  computer has done a very bad move, I select 3 Minutes  thinking-time,  and
  Undo. Now I fetch a cup of tea, and when I come  back,  the  computer  has
  found  a  better  move  in  most  cases.  Now  I  select  again  the   old
  thinking-time of  30  seconds.  A  other  way  is  this:  You  can  select
  Playmode/Human-Human, use Undo, and do a better move yourself. Now  select
  Playmode/Human-Amiga again.

  Please don't try to compare VChess running on an A1200 with  an  expensive
  program like "Fritz" on a Penium150. This is not fair. VChess is  designed
  for people like me, who want to play some  chess  sometimes,  who  want  a
  nice, cheap, easy to use program which is not impossible to beat.

The Use of VChess
=================
   
  After starting VChess, you will see the mainwindow, and perhaps  the  four
  other windows. The behaviour of the windows is like  the  windows  of  the
  Workbench. You can  move,  re-size  and  close  them.  If  you  close  the
  mainwindow, the program will terminate. To move a chessman,  simple  click
  on it and then on the destination  square.  (To  make  a  rochade(castle),
  simple move the king. The rook is moved automatically.) If you clicked  on
  a piece, and this click was a mistake, just click again on  it  to  delete
  the selection.

  In the window titled "All Moves" you can see  all  moves  of  the  current
  game. The last performed move is marked with a ">", this is not very nice,
  highlighting would look better, but GadTools-ListView-Gadgets  only  allow
  highlighting  of  a  complete  line.  The  algebraic  notation  is   used.
  "2.Bf1-b5   e7-e5" means, that this is the second move,  White  moved  the
  Bishop from square f1 to square b5, and Black moved a pawn from e7 to  e5.
  The letters behind the movenumber (2.) have the following meanings:

  P  Pawn
  N  Knight
  B  Bishop
  R  Rook
  Q  Queen
  K  King

  The "P" for a move of a pawn is  usually  substituted  by  a  space.  Some
  special characters are used for special moves: "O - O"  or  "O-O-O"  means
  the small or big rochade. "e.p."  indicates  the  special  pawn  move  "En
  passant". "+" and "#" are used  to  indicate  check  and  checkmate.  "#W"
  means, that White is checkmate, "#B3" means, that Black will be  checkmate
  in 3 half-moves. "*W" or "*B" is my own notation  if  White  or  Black  is
  stalemate.

  The third window titled "Thinking..." shows the valuation of all currently
  possible moves. The numbers on the right side are the  valuation  of  this
  move. The number 100 is equal to the gain of a pawn, -25 is equal  to  the
  lost of a quarter pawn and so on.

  "3-3 Be4xd5 50" means the following: If the Bishop on square e4 would  hit
  the chessman on square d5, this would result in the active player  gaining
  of one half pawn. The characters "3-3" describe the deep of  thinking,  in
  this example three half-moves. (A half-move is a move  of  a  white  or  a
  black piece.) In  this  example  the  computer  has  calculated  for  each
  possible move of the active player a move of its opponent, and for each of
  these moves of the opponent again a move of  its  own.  From  these  three
  half-moves the total gain of this move is  calculated,  and  the  computer
  will select the move with the highest total gain. Note that in the average
  a player can make one of 30 possible  moves.  And  for  all  of  these  30
  possible moves there are again 30 moves as a response,  and  so  on.  This
  means, if the computer calculates 3 half-moves  deep,  the  computer  must
  process 30^3=30*30*30=27000 half-moves. You can  think  about  it  as  the
  computer building a tree for each possible move. The  first  half-move  is
  the root of a tree, and from this root there are 30 branches to a opposite
  move, and from each opposite move there  are  again  30  branches  to  the
  opposite-opposite-moves and so on. Of course such a tree doesn't  have  to
  be totally symmetric, some branches can be longer (more nodes) and  others
  shorter. If an entry begins for example with "3-4", then this  means  that
  the basic depth of this tree is 3 nodes, but this branch is 4 nodes  deep.
  Or sometimes you can see entries like "5-3". This  means  that  the  basic
  depth of this tree is 5 nodes, but this branch is  cut  because  it  looks
  like a bad move, or a checkmate will occur in 3 half-moves.

  The fourth window is called "Move-Chain". If you click on an entry in  the
  "Thinking..."-Window, then the movechain of this move is displayed in this
  window. This will help you to understand why the computer  thinks  that  a
  single move is a good or a bad move. The display of this window looks like
  this: 
  ------------
  Gain:  40 +3
  Nb8-c6    50
  e4xd5    240
  Qd8xd5   300
  Nf3xe5    70
  ------------
  This means: If the active player made  the  move  "Nb8-c6",  his  opponent
  would react with e4xd5 and so on. The real gain of the  move  "Nb8-c6"  is
  50-240+300-70=40. The +3 is a random-number added to the gain, so  in  the
  "Thinking..."-window the displayed gain is 40+3=43. (The displayed gain in
  the "Thinking..."-window may differ a little  bit  from  the  sum  of  the
  movechain. This is not a bug, but occur because moves at the  end  of  the
  chain are less weighted.)

  The last window titled "String-Input" can be used to set  or  move  pieces
  instead of using the mouse. This can be very useful if you want to type in
  a game, opening or position from a book or newspaper. In playing-mode (see
  below) you can type in moves in algebraic notation to do  your  move.  You
  can use the abreviated algebraic (PGN-like) notation too.  Here  are  some
  examples:

  Pe2-e4 or e2e4 or ee4 or 2e4 or e4 or e or 4 may move the pawn.

  Use  lowercase  letters   for   positions!   And   capital   letters   for
  chessman-identifiers.  It  may  be   ok   to   enter   only   source-   or
  destination-coordinate, if this is a definite move. (If there is only  one
  legal move with this coordinate.)

  Don't type O-O or O-O-O to do a rochade (castle), just move the king  like
  "Ke1g1". For an "En Passant" move just move your pawn, and for  converting
  a pawn to a queen just move the pawn.

  After the move-coordinates  you  can  enter  a  quality.  There  are  four
  qualities, !!, !, !? and ?. !? and ?! are identically,  and  you  can  use
  simple numbers too, !!=1, !=2, !?=3, ?=4. If you don't  enter  a  quality,
  then the default quality (see below) is used. Please note, that only moves
  with quality !! or ! can be added to the opening-library.

  Additional, you can enter a textual comment behind  each  move.  Here  are
  again some examples:

  Re4xh4   !!   This is a very good move
  ef3!!
  e2e4A usual opening
  Qh ? It was not a good idea to move the queen to h
   
  I hope this is clear, try it out.
   
  In Buildup-mode, you can use this window to set up a position. First  type
  one single letter to indicate the color, for english language type "W"  to
  select white pieces, or "B" to select black pieces.

  Now type just a coordinate  to  set  a  pawn,  or  a  chessman  identifier
  followed be a coordinate to set a chessman.

  "e4" or "Pe4" will set a pawn on square e4.
  "Ka1" will set a King on square a1.
   
  You can use a coordinate with a capital letter to  clear  a  square.  "G5"
  will clear g5.

  In setup-mode, spaces are not allowed. You have to type  in  one,  two  or
  three characters, no spaces.

  You can deactivate the String-Gadget, if you just type Return without  any
  input. This can be useful,  if  you  want  to  do  a  Menu-Operation  with
  Menu-Shortcuts.  (If  the  String-Gadget   is   active,   you   can't   do
  Menu-Operations with Shortcuts.)

Playing- and Buildup-Mode
=========================
   
  There are two modes: Playing-Mode, and Buildup-Mode. In  the  Buildup-Mode
  you can move pieces without any restrictions. In Playing-Mode you  can  do
  only legal moves, and the  chess  clocks  are  running.  The  Buildup-Mode
  contains a special sub-mode, called Replay-Mode. Replay-mode  means,  that
  there is a game in memory (just played or loaded). In this  case  you  can
  use the menu items "Next Move", "Previous Move" etc. to replay it, and you
  can save the game. If you are in  Replay-Mode  and  modify  the  board  by
  moving pieces, you will go to the plain Buildup-Mode. If you  are  in  the
  plain Buildup-Mode, then you can save  only  the  contents  of  the  board
  without any moves.

Titleline of the Mainwindow
===========================
   
  The windowtitle is used for displaying various  information,  for  example
  error-reports or the last move. If the computer has done a move,  you  can
  see in () the computing-power of the computer in  moves  per  second,  Mps
  (really Half-moves). Additional, at the beginning of a game  the  name  of
  the used opening is displayed.

Chess clocks
============
   
  At the top of the board window you can see three chess clocks.  The  clock
  on the left displays the total time for the white player, and the clock on
  the right the time for the black player. The clock in the middle shows the
  time for the active player.

The Menu
========
   
  If one of the five windows is active, then  you  can  select  one  of  the
  following functions with the right mousebutton:

  Project
  -------
     
    "New Game"
       
      With this item you start a new game. All pieces are built up on  their
      initial position, and it is white's turn.

    "Start Game"
       
      With this item you also start playing, but the pieces  stay  at  there
      former places.

    "Solve for Mate"
       
      With this item you can activate a special playing-mode:  The  computer
      will  go  on  thinking  until  the  computer  sees  a  checkmate. Mate
      in one move means, that the active player makes a move, and  then  his
      opponent is checkmate. This is trivial. Mate in 2  Moves  means,  that
      the active player makes a move, then his opponent makes any move,  and
      then after the second move  of  the  active  player  the  opponent  is
      checkmate. The Computer will start calculating all moves one move deep
      searching for a mate in 1, then he will extend some interesting  moves
      to a greater depth. If no mate is found, he  will  calculate  2  moves
      deep, first without depth-extension, then  with  depth-extension.  You
      can monitor the progress in the Thinking-Window.

      You can stop the solving for mate, if you select "Stop Game" in  menu.
      This can be necessary,  because  there  exists  many  chesstask  which
      VChess can not solve in short time. If there are  no  changes  in  the
      Thinking-window for long time, then this  task  is  to  difficult  for
      VChess, and you should select  "Stop Game"  in  menu.  (All  tasks  in
      drawer Checkmates/Solved are solved in less  than  20  minutes  on  my
      A3000. But the tasks in the drawer Unsolved my A3000 can not solve  in
      some minutes.)

      When the computer has found the way to checkmate, he makes  the  first
      move and stops the game. (If  the  computer  has  found  a  mate  with
      depth-extension, then he will go on with the next level. There may  be
      a shorter way to mate, or there may be more ways to mate.) You can see
      all moves to mate in the MoveChain-Window. In general case,  the  next
      move is not clear, the opponent can react with more  than  one  single
      move. This is the reason why the computer will not  do  all  moves  to
      mate. But if you think that it is useful to save a special way to mate
      then you can do  this:  Select  "Thinklist/Update Movechain/No Update"
      and  "Playmode/Human-Human"  from  menu.  Now  start  the  game   with
      "Project/Start Game" and play the moves  which  you  can  see  in  the
      Move-Chain-Window.  Then  you  can  save  this  way  to  checkmate  by
      selecting "Project/Save Game".

    "Stop Game"
       
      Terminates the current game (or solving for mate).

    "Load Game... (or Set Up/Load Game...)"
       
      With this function you can load a game, to analyse it or go on playing
      it. For example you can select the menuitem "Setup/Next Move" multiple
      times to go  to  a  desired  position  in  a  game,  and  then  select
      "Project/StartGame" to start playing from this position. If  you  have
      loaded a game, then the position is at the beginning of this game.  So
      if you want to continue a loaded  game,  it  is  necessary  to  select
      "SetUp/Last Move" before starting the game.There is a good reason  why
      we don't jump to the last move automatically: Maybe you got  a  solved
      Chesstask on disk, for example  a  "mate  in  3".  If  you  load  this
      chesstask, you probably will try to  find  the  solution  by  yourself
      first. Only if you can't see it, you will use "Next Move" from menu to
      display it. (It may be a good idea to  close  the  "All  Moves"-Window
      before  loading  a  solved  Chesstask,  otherwise  you  will  see  the
      solution.)

    "Load quick"
       
      This function will load the last saved game. This may  be  useful  for
      people who save and load the same game many time. (Playing letter-  or
      email-chess.) The name of the last game (and  the  directory-name)  is
      saved in the configuration-file. You may proceed like this. Save  your
      game with "Project/Save Game..."  for example with name "MyGame".  Now
      select "Config/Save" from menu. Now "MyGame" is the default game-name.
      When you start VChess the next time, you can select this item to  load
      this game. This is very fast.

    "Save Game..."
       
      With this function you can save a game, to go on playing it later,  to
      analyse it  later,  or  just  to  archive  it.  You  can  save  it  in
      Buildup-Mode and in Playing-Mode. If there is no game  in  memory,  or
      the board is modified, then only the board is saved. If  you  want  to
      save not the complete game, for example not the last bad move, then do
      this: Go to the move, which is the last move which  should  be  saved.
      Now select "Extras/Delete Successors" from  menu.  Now  the  following
      moves are erased, and you can save the game. For  each  game  you  can
      enter a textual comment. This comment can be up to 79 characters long.
      I use  Dos.SetComment()  to  store  this  comment,  so  no  additional
      diskspace is used, and you can see this comment, if you type  LIST  in
      the SHELL.

    "Save quick"
       
      Saves the game with the default name, see  "Project/Load Quick".  Will
      work only if there is a default name.

    "Save Movelist..."
       
      The actual game is saved as a text file in algebraic notation.

    "Print Movelist"
       
      The actual game is printed as a text file in algebraic notation.

    "Give Up..."
       
      A Requester will ask you if you really wants to give up. If  so,  then
      the game will stop, and the default  comment  to  this  game  will  be
      "White/Black gave up".

    "Offer Draw..."
       
      Use this to propose a draw. In release 4.1 a draw is always  accepted,
      if    the     current     position     has     occured     3     times
      (Position-repeatition-rule) or if there was no progress in the last 50
      moves (50-moves-rule). (The game ended in a draw, neigther  side  won.
      In german we use the word Remis, I think it's a french word.)

    "About..."
       
      This item displays the address of the author of VChess.

    "Quit"
       
      Terminates the program.

  Players
  -------
     
    "Human-Human"
       
      Two human players play against each other.

    "Human-Amiga"
       
      A human player plays with the white pieces against the computer.

    "Amiga-Human"
       
      The computer plays with the white pieces against a human player.

    "Amiga-Amiga"
       
      Computer plays against computer.

  Time
  ----
     
    With this menu you can change the thinking-time of the computer:

    "10 Secs, 20 Secs, 30 Secs"
       
      Thinking-time is 10, 20 or 30 seconds.

    "1 Min, 2 Mins, 3 Mins, 5 Mins, 10 Mins, 30 Mins"
       
      Thinking-time is 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 or 30 minutes.

    "1 Hour, 3 Hours, 8 Hours"
       
      Thinking-time is 1, 3, or 8 hours.

    "Infinite"
       
      The computer calculates until a mate is found,  or  until  you  select
      "Extras/Break" to force the computer to make his move.

    "Custom"
       
      With this function you can enter a custom thinking-time. With the four
      gadgets you can determine if your input  is  in  seconds,  minutes  or
      hours. If you only press <Return>, then your input is assumed to be in
      seconds. 

    "Equal ?"
       
      If this item is marked, then the computer will adapt its thinking time
      to the thinking time of the human player.

    "For 1  Move"
       
      The above time is used for a single move

    "For 30 Moves"
       
      The above time is used for 30 moves

    "For Game"
       
      The computer will try to finish the the whole  game  in  the  selected
      time.

    "Reset"
       
      Resets the chessclocks to zero

  Thinklist
  ---------
     
    "Refresh"
       
      The computer is always thinking for the active  player,  even  if  the
      active player is a human player. If you select  this  item,  then  the
      list of all currently possible moves together with their valuation  is
      displayed. Of course the valuation may change with time,  because  the
      computer is thinking deeper and deeper. So if  you  select  this  item
      after some time again, the valuation will be not  the  same.  You  can
      also select this item if the computer is the active player, to see how
      the computer evaluates the different moves.

    "Refresh & Sort"
       
      Like "Refresh", but the moves are displayed sorted by gain, best  move
      at the top.

    "Show old List"
       
      This item is similar to "Refresh", but it  displays  not  the  current
      (active) list, but the old list containing the last move. Sometimes it
      is necessary to take a look on  the  old  list,  for  example  if  the
      computer makes a strange move, and you want to find out  why  he  made
      such a move. If the list containing this strange,  last  move  is  not
      visible, then select this item to display it again.

    "Show old List sorted"
       
      Like "Show old List", but the moves are displayed sorted by gain, best
      move at the top.

    "Show best Chain"
       
      Displays the Movechain of the currently best move. (You can  use  this
      item or "Refresh & Sort" to get help from the computer.) Please  note:
      The best move is not always the one with the  highest  valuation!  The
      computer may prefer a move  with  a  smaller  valuation,  but  with  a
      greater depth!

    "Beep if updated ?"
       
      If this item is marked, then the computer makes an audible beep if the
      Thinklist- or MoveChain-Window is updated.

    "Show sorted ?"
       
      If this item is marked, then the  Thinklist  is  displayed  sorted  by
      gain, otherwise sorted alphabetically.

    "Update Display"
       
      "If changed"
         
        Update Thinklist and Move-Chain whenever there are changes. This may
        slow down the calculating  power,  because  in  early  states  of  a
        thinking- process (the first seconds) there  are  many  changes  per
        time interval.

      "Automatic"
         
        Update Thinklist and Move-Chain if it is useful, for  example  after
        2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60 seconds, and then whenever there are changes.

      "No Update"
         
        Only    update    the    display,    when    the     user     select
        "Thinklist/Refresh & Sort" or an equal item. The "Move-Chain"-window
        is updated, if the user clicks on an entry in the Thinklist.

    "Refresh if"
       
      "It's Computer's turn"
         
        Refresh Thinklist and Move-Chain, if  the  computer  is  the  active
        player.

      "It's Your turn"
         
        Refresh Thinklist and Move-Chain, if a human is the active player.

    "Update MoveChain"
       
      "Best Move"
         
        Display in the Movechain-Window the best move.

      "Current Move"
         
        Display in the Movechain-Window the current (last calculated)  move.
         
      "No Update"
         
        Don't update the Move-Chain-Window automatically. The  "Move-Chain"-
        window is updated, if the user clicks on an entry in the  Thinklist.
         
  Display
  -------
     
    "Show Movelist"
       
      The helpwindow, which shows the moves of the current game,  is  opened
      or brought to the front.

    "Show Thinking"
       
      This function will open the window, which shows the valuation  of  all
      currently possible moves, or brings this  window  in  front  of  other
      windows.

    "Show MoveChain"
       
      If you select this item, then the window, which displays the movechain
      of a special move, is opened or brought to the front.

    "Open String-Window"
       
      Opens the  window  for  string-input,  or  brings  it  to  front.  The
      String-Gadget should become active too. This can be  useful,  if  this
      Menu-Item has a Shortcut. So you can activate  the  Input-Window  with
      the keyboard. I am  not  sure,  if  this  really  works  ever.  I  use
      ActivateWindow() and ActivateGadget(), maybe more code is necessary.

    "Rotate"
       
      "90+, 180, 90-"
         
        With these items you can rotate the board.

    "Change Colors"
       
      If you select  one  of  the  following  eleven  items,  then  a  Color
      requester is opened. Click on the color, which should be used for  the
      drawing. If you use a custom-screen, you can use the sliders to change
      the color-values. But if you play on a public-screen, it's  better  to
      only select a color instead of changing the value. You can only select
      one color at a time. If you click on "Ok", then  the  board  is  drawn
      with the selected color. For pieces and squares  you  can  select  two
      colors, A and B. Color B is used for the border  of  the  pieces,  and
      although if the squares are not monochrome (pattern).

      "White Pieces A"
         
        Color A (inner) of white pieces.

      "White Pieces B"
         
        Color B (border and pattern) of white pieces.

      "Black Pieces A"
         
        Color A (inner) of black pieces.

      "Black Pieces B"
         
        Color B (border and pattern) of black pieces.

      "White Squares A"
         
        Color A of white squares

      "White Squares B"
         
        Color B of white squares

      "Black Squares A"
         
        Color A of black squares

      "Black Squares B"
         
        Color B of black squares

      "Board-Border"
         
        Color of the border of the board.

      "Board-Text"
         
        Color of the text of the board. (1..8, a..h, and chess clocks )

      "Rectangle"
         
        Color of the rectangle, which is drawn around a  selected  piece  or
        square.

    "Change Patterns"
       
      You can select between four different patterns  for  the  squares  and
      pieces: Mono (only color A), points, lines up and lines down.

      "White Pieces"
         
        Pattern for white pieces

      "Black Pieces"
         
        Pattern for black pieces

      "White Squares"
         
        Pattern for white squares

      "Black Squares"
         
        Pattern for black squares

      If the display looks ugly on your screen, you should try other  colors
      and patterns. The defaults look nice on an hires-interlace-screen with
      OS2.0-colors, but  if  you  have  to  play  on  a  screen  with  lower
      resolution or different colors, then it's a good  idea  to  try  other
      color-selections and patterns.

    "Beam time"
       
      With these items you can control the speed with which the  pieces  are
      moved from one square to an other square.

      "0"
         
        Pieces are moved at once.

      "1"
         
        Pieces are moved very fast

      "2"
         
        Pieces are moved fast.

      "3, 4, 5"
         
        Moving takes about 3, 4 or 5 seconds

    "Setup Mode ?"
       
      The board gets a border on the left and right  side.  On  this  border
      rest some chessmen. In the Buildup-Mode, you can select  these  pieces
      and use them to build up a position. Also you can move pieces  on  the
      border to throw them away. In playing-mode the border has no function.
       
    "Coordinates ?"
       
      If you turn off coordinates, you have more room for the pieces. But  I
      think this is only necessary if you have to play on a screen with very
      low resolution.

    "Chess Clock ?"
       
      You can turn off the clock. If you have turned off coordinates,  clock
      is always turned of too.

    "Draw beam frame ?"
       
      If this item is marked, then a border is  drawn  around  pieces  while
      beaming. So it is easier to see which pieces are moving.

    "Show Quality ?"
       
      Starting with release 4.0 of VChess,  to  every  move  is  assigned  a
      quality from 1 to 4, or !! to ?. Quality is important if you  want  to
      add moves to the opening-library. You can ignore the quality,  if  you
      deactivate this item.

    "Print Space for !?"
       
      For most games !? will be the default quality, so most moves will have
      quality !?. Then it is optically more nice if a simple space  is  used
      instead of !?.

    "Squareframes"
       
      "White ?"
         
        Draw a frame in color A around white squares

      "Black ?"
         
        Draw a frame in color A around black squares

    "Change Screen..."
       
      With this item you can select if you  want  to  play  on  the  default
      public screen, on a public screen or on a custom screen. If  you  want
      to play on a public screen, you have to type in its name. If you  want
      to play on a custom screen, it is recommended to  use  a  screen  with
      four or eight colors. It is possible to use a  screen  with  only  two
      colors, but this will not look very nice. More than eight  colors  are
      not recommended, because VChess currently doesn't use more than eleven
      different colors. Please keep in  mind,  that  screen  resolution  and
      number of colors may affect the calculating speed  of  your  computer.
      For example on my A3000 calculating speed is degraded about 50%  if  I
      use a hires-16-color-screen or Productivity-Mode. Note that  parts  of
      the pulldown-menu may be invisible if you use a large screenfont and a
      screen with a low horizontal resolution.

    "Screenfont..."
       
      If you play on a custom screen, then you can select a  font  which  is
      used for menus and windowtitles.

    "Textfont..."
       
      With this function you can select a font which is used in  the  active
      window. First click in the desired window to make it the  active  one,
      then select this item. So you can  select  different  fonts  for  each
      window.

  Set Up
     
    You can access this menu only if you are in Buildup-Mode, maybe you have
    to select "Project/StopGame" before.

    "Load Game..."
       
      See "Project/Load Game..."

    "First Move"
       
      Jumps to the beginning of the game.

    "Next Move"
       
      The next move is performed.

    "Previous Move"
       
      Takes back the last move.

    "Last Move"
       
      Jumps to the last move of the actual game.

      In Playing- and Buildup-Mode, you can use the Scroller and  associated
      Arrows in the board-window  to  move  in  a  game,  too.  And  if  the
      boardwindow is active, you can use the Cursor-Keys too:

      Cursor Left:  Move to beginning
      Cursor Right: Move to the end
      Cursor Down:  Do next move
      Cursor Up:    Go back, or undo
       
    "Clear Board"
       
      All pieces are removed from the board.

    "Build Up"
       
      All pieces are moved to their start-position.

    "Reset"
       
      Resets a modified board. This is useful, if there is a game in  memory
      (just played or loaded), and you have modified  the  board  by  moving
      pieces (or changed the active color with the following two items).  In
      this case it is not possible to  go  on  playing  this  game,  to  use
      "Next Move", "Previous Move" etc. Instead of pushing  back  all  moved
      pieces, you can use this item to reset the board and active color.

    "White's turn"
       
      The white player has to do the next move.

    "Black's turn"
       
      The black player has to do the next move.

  Config
  ------
     
    You can save all settings in a configuration-file.

    "Create Icons ?"
       
      With this item you can select if the program shall  create  icons  for
      saved files. If the program  has  to  make  Icons,  then  one  of  the
      following icons is copied if it exist, or defaults are used.

      Filetype          Used Icon (if it exists)
      ------------------------------------------
      Game              "Icons/GameIcon", "GameIcon", "Games/Game1", "Game1"
      Configuration     "Icons/ConfigIcon", "ConfigIcon",
                        "Configs/VChess.config", "VChess.config";
      Textfile          "Icons/TextIcon", "TextIcon", "Text/Text1", "Text1"

      Additional, if using Locale.library, for each filetype there  are  two
      language-dependant Iconnames. For "deutsch" these are:

      Filetype          Icons for deutsch language (if it exists)
      ------------------------------------------
      Game              "Spiele/Spiel1", "Spiel1"
      Configuration     "Configs/VChess.config", "VChess.config";
      Textfile          "Texte/Text1", "Text1"

       
    "Use opp. Time ?"
       
      Starting  with  release  4.0  VChess  may  take   advantage   of   the
      thinking-time of the human player. This can be useful if the  computer
      has only a short thinking-time, while the human  player  take  a  much
      longer time. If this item is activated, the computer may do  his  move
      at once. If a weak human player plays against a fast computer, then it
      may be necessary to deactivate this item. Otherwise the  computer  may
      always win, even if the thinking-time is only one second.

    "Teaching ?"
       
      With this function you can switch  on  a  teaching-mode.  If  you  are
      playing and it is your turn, and  you  click  on  a  piece,  then  all
      squares on which the chessman can be moved are marked.  This  is  very
      useful for children learning chess.

    "Set Sound Volume..."
       
      Type in a value from 0 to 64. 0 means no sound, 64 maximum volume.

    "Set Error-Sound..."
       
      Now VChess can play extern soundfiles  using  datatypes.  This  should
      work with OS 3.1 if DataTypes.library is  availiable.  The  sounds  in
      drawers   "Sounds"   are   8SVX-Files,   I   found   them    in    the
      Term4.7-Distribution of Olaf Barthel. Other soundfiles may  work  too,
      if corresponding datatypes are installed on  your  computer.  You  can
      select a file from drawer "Sounds", or you can type in an empty string
      to get a simple DisplayBeep.

    "Set Update-Sound..."
       
      Here  you  can  select  which  sound   should   be   played   if   the
      Thinking-Window or MoveChain-Window  is  updated.  Type  in  an  empty
      string to get a simple beep.

    "Set Move-Sound..."
       
      This sound is played if the computer makes a  move.  An  empty  string
      will give a simple beep.

      If you have any trouble with the sounds, try to enter an empty  string
      (just press Return) for all three sounds. Or set Sound-Volume to 0, or
      delete the whole "Sounds"-drawer.

    "Load..."
       
      Loads a configuration and activates it.

    "Save"
       
      Saves the actual settings as defaults.  The  program  will  use  these
      settings at the next start.  The  settings  are  stored  in  the  file
      VChess.config, or if the drawer Configs exists, in this drawer.

    "Save As..."
       
      With this function you can save additional configurations,  which  you
      can load and activate again with "Config/Load" .

    "Last Saved"
       
      This function activates the configuration which was used at the  start
      of the program, or which was saved with "Save". This is the file named
      Configs/VChess.config or VChess.config.

    "Reset to defaults"
       
      Resets all settings to defaults.

  Extras
  ------
     
    "Store this Pos."
       
      Stores the current position. You can use this function in Playing- and
      Buildup-Mode. This is very useful, if you try to solve a  chess  task,
      or to develop  new  openings  or  if  you  are  playing  letter  chess
      (exchanging single moves with a friend by letters, EMail or phone.)

    "Restore old Pos."
       
      Restores the stored position.

    "Set White's Aggr., Set Black's Aggr."
       
      With these two items you can change the aggression of the computer. If
      you enter the number N, then this means that the computer will  assign
      the pieces of his opponent a new value: 
      NewValue:=(RealValue + (RealValue*N/100).
      The values of his own pieces remain unchanged. So, if  you  entered  a
      positive value, then the computer will  give  the  opposite  pieces  a
      greater value than his own pieces, and will  play  a  more  aggressive
      game, maybe he will try to exchange a pawn of his own with a  pawn  of
      his opponent. If you enter a negative value, then  the  computer  will
      play a less aggressive game, he will try to prevent  the  exchange  of
      equal pieces.

      White's aggression is only important if the computers plays  with  the
      white pieces. If the computer plays with the black pieces, you have to
      use "Set Black's Aggr.". You will only have to use both items, if  the
      computer plays with white and black pieces (Playmode Amiga-Amiga).  So
      you can see what happens, if a aggressive computer player plays  again
      an un-aggressive computer player.

    "Valuation"
       
      The computer will evaluate the current position. In Buildup-Mode  this
      valuation is only an approximation, only the pieces on the  board  and
      their strategic positions are taken into account. It is  not  regarded
      if one chessman can capture an other chessman, or if a mate will occur
      after some moves. In playing mode, the gain of the next move is  added
      to this valuation. This gives a more precise result.

    "Break"
       
      With this function you can force the computer to make his move. Useful
      if you are not very patient.

    "Undo last Move"
       
      With this function you can take back the last  move.  The  chess-rules
      don't allows this, but I think some  people  will  use  this  function
      sometimes. Of course you can take back many moves  by  selecting  this
      function again and again. (There may be a little problem: If you  take
      back an "En Passant"-Move, you (or the computer) can not do this  move
      again. In this case go back two moves, and then go forward again these
      two moves.)

    "Redo the Move"
       
      The move which you have taken back is again performed.

    "Delete Successors"
       
      With this function you can delete all successors of the  actual  move.
      This can be useful if you want to save or print only the beginning  of
      a game. Go to the desired position, then select this item.

    "Pause"
       
      This function stops the chess clocks, and sets the thinking-process to
      a very low priority, so no  computing-power  is  consumed.  The  break
      automatically ends, if an user input is registered.

    "Set Task Pri. ..."
       
      With this function you  can  modify  the  priority  of  this  program.
      Generally you  will  not  need  this  function.  Because  a  permanent
      modification  of  priority  is  not  useful,  it  is  not  stored   in
      configuration files. At the next start of VChess, the priority will be
      again zero (if started from workbench) or equal to the priority of the
      shell-process  (if  started  from  shell).   The   priority   of   the
      thinking-process is always one point lower than the  priority  of  the
      main process. So user input is always processed in real-time.

    "Default Quality"
       
      Whenever a move is performed, a quality is  assigned  to  it.  If  the
      moves originates from the opening-library, then the quality  is  given
      by the opening-library, !! or !. If the computer calculates the  move,
      or if you do the move with the mouse,  then  the  default  quality  is
      used. Default quality can be !!, !, !?=?!  or  ?.  There  are  only  4
      different qualities, because one move is stored  on  disk  in  only  2
      Byte. There is no more space for other qualities. I think 4  different
      qualities are enough, it is not useful to waste  one  additional  Byte
      for each move.  It  may  look  strange  that  moves  originating  from
      opening-library have quality !! or !,  for  example  e2-e4!!.  If  you
      don't  like  this,  just  turn   of   displaying   of   quality   with
      "Display/Show Quality". In the general case,  you  should  use  !?  as
      default quality, and activate "Display/Print Space For !?".  Then  you
      can mark good moves with !! or !, and bad moves with ?.

      "!!"
         
        Default Quality is !!

      "!"
         
        Default Quality is !

      "!?"
         
        Default Quality is !?

      "?"
         
        Default Quality is ?

    "Random"
       
      With this item you can make the play of the computer more interesting.
      Principle the computer would do always  the  same  move  in  the  same
      situation, because he calculates the best move. But to the  result  of
      the calculation a random number is added. With this function  you  can
      select the upper border of this number. 100 points are  equal  to  the
      (virtual) win of a pawn.

      "0, 25, 50, 100"
         
        The random value is in the range between zero and 0, 25, 50 or  100.
        If you select "0", then the computer always will do the same move in
        the same situation. If you select "50", then to each calculated gain
        a random number between 0 and 50 is added.

        In late endgame, i.e. King vs (King+Bishop+Knight), it may be useful
        to select a smaller Random-Value, i.e. less than 16. Otherwise, with
        Random-Value >=25, it may occur that the Computer can  not  force  a
        mate in less than 50 moves. Large Random-Values in conjunction  with
        small thinking-time in  Endgame  sometimes  gives  strange  results,
        because the computer will always try to prevent a  repetition  of  a
        position.

      "Custom"
         
        With this function you can enter a custom  upper  boundary  for  the
        random number. If the boundary is high, then the playing-strength of
        the computer will decrease. But maybe this is what you want.

    "Set Comment..."
       
      With this function you can enter or modify a textual  comment  to  the
      actual  move.  The  actual  move  is  marked  with  a   ">"   in   the
      "All Moves"-Window.

    "Set Quality..."
       
      With this function you can modify the quality of the actual move.

    "Show Comment"
       
      Displays the comment of the actual  move  in  the  Board-Window-Title.
      This may be useful, if the window titled "All-Moves" is closed, or  if
      the  comment  is  very  long.  (In  the  "All-Moves"-Window  only  the
      beginning of a long comment is displayed.)

    "Show Game Com."
       
      Displays the comment to this game.

  Openings
  --------
     
    The computer can use an Opening-library for the first moves of  a  game.
    (Please don't be confused, the Opening-library is  not  a  Library  like
    ReqTools.library, but just a collection of openings.)  The  filename  of
    this library is VChessOpenings.  This  file  must  reside  in  the  same
    directory as the program VChess (PROGDIR:). (I think there is no  reason
    to hide it in sub-directories, or to use more than one Opening-library.)
    Using this library means that the computer needs no  thinking  time  for
    the first moves, and the playing-strength of the computer is greater. Of
    course the library can only be used, if the  game  starts  from  initial
    position. (Now it should work too, if Black starts the game.) Note  that
    the opening-library is loaded if playing  starts.  This  means,  if  you
    select "Openings/Use not" before you start playing, the library will not
    be loaded in memory. In release 4.0 one Halfmove of the library needs  2
    Bytes on disk, and 16 Bytes in  RAM.  This  means,  that  a  very  large
    Library of 10^5 = 100000 Halfmoves will need 200K  on  Disk,  and  1.6MB
    RAM.

    "Show Name"
       
      Displays the name of the used  Opening.  For  Example  "King's  indian
      defence (3)" means, that the three first moves of this game are called
      "King's indian defence", the fourth and the following  moves  have  no
      name.

    "Show Moves"
       
      This function looks like a simple  chess-database  for  openings.  All
      moves of the  opening-library,  which  can  be  used  in  the  current
      situation,   are   displayed   in   the    "Move-Chain"-Window.    Try
      "Project/New Game", and then select this Item. You  will  see  "e2-e4"
      and some other good starting-moves.

    "ShowNumber"
       
      Displays the total number of moves (halfmoves) in the Opening-Library.
       
    "Use !!"
       
      Computer shall use only !!-moves of the opening-library.

    "Prefer !!"
       
      Computer shall prefer !!-moves, but may used !-moves (second class) if
      no !!-move is available.

    "Use !! and !"
       
      Computer may use both classes.

    "Don't use"
       
      Computer shall not use the Opening-Library.

    "Delete actual"
       
      Which this function you can delete the  actual,  last  performed  move
      from opening-library. For example, if the computer has done  the  move
      a2-a3, and you think that this is a bad move, just select this item to
      delete it and all successors of this move in opening-library. You  can
      use this function to delete any opening. For example, you suppose that
      1. e2-e4  b7-b6 is stored in Opening-Library, and you think  that  the
      second halfmove is a  bad  move.  Select  "Playmode/Human-Human"  from
      menu, and then "Project/New Game". Now do these two  moves,  and  then
      select "Openings/Delete actual" to delete b7-b6  and  all  successors.
      e2-e4 will remain unmodified.

    "Cut Tree..."
       
      This  may  be  useful   if   your   Opening-Library   is   to   large.
      Opening-Library builds a tree, and with this function you can cut  all
      branches which are longer than the  number  which  you  enter  in  the
      string-gadget. This works like hedgeshears!

    "Delete all !"
       
      This may be useful if your Opening-Library is to large. It will delete
      all second-class moves.

    "Dump to File..."
       
      This function writes all moves to a file in  algebraic  notation.  The
      resulting file may become very large, because the three-structure  has
      to be converted to a linear form.

    "Add this Game"
       
      Adds the current game to the library. Please note,  that  only  first-
      and second-class moves can be stored in the library. Of course you can
      add only regular games, this means games started  from  their  initial
      position and white as active player. If you will add an opening from a
      chess  book,  it  is  recommended  to  do  it  in  this  way:   Select
      "Players/Human-Human" and now "Project/NewGame". Now you can play  the
      opening from the book, and then select this item  to  add  it  to  the
      library. You should only add your own openings (games) to the  library
      if you are a strong player, because an  opening  should  contain  only
      very strong moves. If there is only one weak move, then  the  computer
      may do this weak move and the playing-strength decreases. Please  note
      the following: If you want to add new entries to the  Opening-Library,
      it is necessary to load the existing library in memory before you  add
      new  entries.   To   test   if   the   library   is   loaded,   select
      "Openings/Show Number",  or  just  use  "Openings/Load"  to  load   it
      (again).

    "Correct Quality ?"
       
      If this item is marked, then the quality  of  existing  moves  in  the
      library may be overwritten if you add new moves. In general case  this
      item should not be activated. But it may be useful, for example if  1.
      e2-e4! is stored in the library, and you want to modify it to e2-e4!!.
       
    "Max Depth"
       
      With the following items you can set the maximum depth,  up  to  which
      moves can be added to the library with "Openings/Add This Game". It is
      not useful to add all moves of a game to the library. 18  Moves  =  36
      Halfmoves are a good depth. But of course  you  can  add  the  maximum
      value, 64 halfmoves, and use "Openings/Cut Tree" if the library  grows
      to big.

      "24"
         
        Don't add more than 24 Halfmoves.

      "36"
         
        Don't add more than 36 Halfmoves.

      "48"
         
        Don't add more than 48 Halfmoves.

      "64"
         
        Add up to 64 Halfmoves, this means up to 32 Moves.

    "Load"
       
      Load the Library again from disk. This can be useful if you have  done
      an operation like "Openings/Cut Tree", and you have  deleted  to  many
      moves.

    "Import V3.5..."
       
      This function is for people who have created a  large  Opening-Library
      with VChess 3.5, and want to use it with VChess 4.1.  You  can  import
      more than one V3.5-Library. Proceed as following:  Start  VChess,  and
      select this function. Now select the  (first)  V3.5-Openings-file.  It
      will be imported. Now you can select further  V3.5-Openings-files.  If
      you are done, you may select "Openings/Show Number" to  see  how  many
      Moves you have imported.  Now  select  "Openings/Save all Entries"  to
      save the library in the new format. This  function  will  destroy  the
      currend game!

    "Flush"
       
      This function will remove all moves from RAM. This can be  useful,  if
      you don't need the library any more, and you have not much RAM.

    "Save all Entries"
       
      If you select this item, then the opening-library  is  saved.  If  you
      forgot this, all modifications are lost. 

Menu-Shortcuts
==============

  Some people like many Shortcuts, other not. The menu is very large, with a
  large  screenfont  a  menu  with  much shortcuts may look not so nice. The
  english VChess.catalog will give you many shortcuts. If you don't like  so
  much shortcuts, then you can delete (or rename) this catalog, and you will
  get only a few shortcuts in the "Project"-menu.

Advanced Topics
===============

  If you want to start a game with a definite opening, then you  can  do  it
  this   way:   Select   "Players/Human-Human"    in    menu,    and    then
  "Project/New Game".  Now  do  the  desired  starting-moves,  for   example
  "1.e2-e4  e7-e5". Now select "Players/Human-Amiga". Now do your next move,
  for example 2.g1f3. Now the computer will do the next move, using  a  move
  from Opening-library if present. But you have to take care about this: You
  should switch  from  "Players/Human-Human"  to  "Players/Amiga-Human"  (or
  Players/Human-Amiga) only  if  it  will  be  your  turn  after  switching.
  Otherwise the computer is already thinking for his own move, and  he  will
  use the result of the thinking-process instead of a move from library.  If
  you want to use the same opening many  times,  then  do  the  first  moves
  (until it is your turn), and  save  the  game  ,  for  example  with  name
  "MyPreferedOpening". Now  select  "Config/Save"  to  make  this  name  the
  default  game-name.  If  you  start  VChess   again,   do   this:   Select
  "Project/Load Quick", "Setup/Last Move" and "Project/Start Game".  Now  it
  should be your turn, and you start the game  from  the  desired  position,
  while the computer can use the opening-library.

  If you enter additional openings, then it is not necessary to  enter  each
  opening from the beginning  again.  If  you  want  to  add  openings,  all
  beginning with e2e4,e7e5,g1f3, then you have to type in  the  first  three
  halfmoves only ones. You can use cursor-keys, scrollergadget or  the  menu
  to go back some moves, and then type in  the  new  way.  Or  you  can  use
  "Extras/Store Position" and "Extras/Restore Position" too. This  may  save
  some work, or it may confuse you. 

Now, at the end of this text, some general remarks:

Errors or bugs in VChess
========================
   
  I'm sure that there are some small bugs in this version of  VChess.  Don't
  hesitate to write to me if you find bugs or have  comments  about  VChess.
  But please don't expect a (long) response to each of your  short  letters.
  Till summer 1997 you may reach me at this EMail-Adress:

  SALEWSKI@PHYSNET.UNI-HAMBURG.DE
   
  But please don't send mail just for fun!


New releases of VChess
======================
   
  There are still  some  things  which  may  be  improved.  Transfering  the
  thinking-algorithm  from  Oberon   to   Assembler   would   increase   the
  calculating-power by a factor 2, and it  may  be  useful  to  use  special
  algorithm for special situations. An ARexx-port, a  Database  (Hash-Table)
  for endgame, PGN-Format-Support may be useful. Using a  (MUI)Control-Panel
  instead of such a large Pull-Down-Menu would make it more easy  to  change
  settings, and some people would like a board with 3D-Graphics. But I think
  that there will be no major Updates of  VChess  on  the  Amiga.  Till  now
  (27.12.1996) only 70 VChess-user paid their contribution. And in  the last
  12 months I got only 8 new regitrations. This is not enough  to  cover  my
  expenses. If this release should contain serious bugs, then you may find a
  bugfix in AmiNet in some months.

  Maybe there will be a transformation of VChess on a Pentium-  or  RISC-CPU
  in the far away future. But that release will not be Shareware again!

VChess and other languages
==========================
   
  It is allowed to make verbatim translations of this  documentation  or  to
  produce new catalog files for other languages. You  can  distribute  these
  translations (together  with  the  VChess-package)  in  your  own  country
  without asking me for permission, but please don't make free, shortened or
  buggy translations. You should only make translations, if you  are  really
  using VChess, so that you can verify your work. (I think no translation is
  better than a bad one.) Making a translation is a lot of work, so  it  may
  be useful to contact me before starting with the translation. Maybe  there
  is already a new release of VChess, or someone else has already  made  the
  desired translation. If you have produced a really good translation,  then
  you can send it to me. Maybe I will add it to the VChess-package.

  By using the Locale.library, VChess can adapt itself to other languages if
  running under OS2.1+. Currently only english is supported.  But  the  file
  VChess.cd is part of this package. So if you have the program  CatComp  (©
  CBM) (or a FD-Program which works like CatComp) and you know  how  to  use
  CatComp, then you can produce Catalogfiles for  your  preferred  language.
  Although English is the built-in  language  of  VChess,  there  exists  an
  English VChess.ct-file. You  can  use  this  (together  with  CatComp  and
  locale.library) to adapt the English text to your own desire. (Modify  the
  VChess.ct-file, use CatComp  to  create  the  VChess.catalog-file  (Usage:
  CatComp VChess.cd TRANSLATION VChess.ct CATALOG VChess.catalog)  and  then
  copy the VChess.catalog-file to  Catalogs/english/VChess.catalog.  If  you
  now start VChess again (after a reset or "avail flush"),  you  should  get
  the new text.)

  (There exists an english Catalog (Drawer  Catalogs/english/VChess.catalog)
  too.  If  you  use  this catalog, you will get many Menu-Shortcuts. If you
  don't like so much shortcuts (like me), just delete this catalog. Then you
  will get the built in strings, with only very few Shortcuts.)


  If  you   modify   Catalog-translations   (VChess.ct),   or   create   new
  translations, please note this: Menu-Shortcuts are localized too. This  is
  suggested in the Amiga-Style-Guide-manual, although many programs don't do
  this. For most menutexts, there  is  a  corresponding  Shortcut-text.  Use
  "\x00" to get no shortcut, or a single character to use a  shortcut. (This
  is much overhead, Nico Francois used  an  other  way.  He  integrated  the
  shortcut into the menutext. I used this way in release 3.5 too,  but  this
  was diffical to handle  for  translators.)  In  the  Catalog-translations,
  there are some strings which contains vertical bars, "|". These characters
  have a special meaning for ReqTools.library.  They  divide  the  text  for
  different response-gadgets, so don't delete these characters.  If  such  a
  string contains any number of these characters,  the  number  must  remain
  constant. Some strings may contain the characters "%ld". This is  used  to
  insert a number, so don't delete this. Some strings contain  "\x20".  This
  is only a space, you may delete it, but  this  is  not  recommended.  Some
  strings must have a special length, look at the  file  VChess.cd  to  read
  this length. (/6/8) for example  means,  that  the  minimum  length  is  6
  characters, and maximum length is 8 characters.  Some  strings  contain  a
  "\n". This is only to write the following text on a new line. Most strings
  have no limitations in length, but if you create too long strings, it  may
  look ugly.

  And now I hope that you enjoy this game.
