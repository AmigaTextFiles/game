Welcome to Amiga Draughts by S.Hargreaves.


This is the full licenseware version of the game, and functions
without restriction. This game is copyright S Hargreaves and may
NOT be reproduced without my express permission.

First some info regarding updates since the demo:-

   1. Improved graphic routines means that the pieces always move
      at the same speed (in the demo they would move slower at the
      start of the game when there are more pieces on the board.)

   2. Sound effects when taking pieces (though no music I'm afraid.
      I can't write music and I couldn't find an Amiga musician to
      do any for me. If anybody offers I'll let registered users
      have a free update.)

   3. Not a bug, but an error corrected. In the demo you could continue
      taking multiple pieces after earning a crown all in the same move.
      This is at odds with the correct draughts rules. In this full
      version your move ends if you earn a crown.

   4. Some slightly improved algorithms for the computer move, giving a
      small speed increase. (You may or may not notice this).

   5. A game end bug. The program should have tested for the current
      players ability to move, and if he was unable to, would award
      the game to his opponent. It didn`t. This has now been fixed.
      Thanks go to D Hardy of Middlesex for reporting this to me.

Normal Draughts rules apply with the exception of the hufting rule,
which I think is unsportsmanlike. If you are able to take a piece
then you must.

Control is a piece of cake. Simply click on the piece that you want
to move, and then on the destination square. Providing you have not
attempted an illegal move then all will be well. If you are taking
multiple pieces on one go, then control will be returned to you after
each piece is taken. You only need to click on the destination square
for the 2nd and subsequent moves.

The game is over when one player has lost all his pieces, or is unable
to move.

The computer skill level can range from 0 to 9. The higher the level the
longer the computer takes to make its` move. You will have to experiment
to see how far you can push it on your system. but I wouldn`t recommend
above level 4 on a standard 1 meg A500 for instance.

Right clicking the mouse on the main game screen will bring up a requester
where you can end the game, change the level (this change is effective from
the computers NEXT move), change the colour of the pieces (see below) or
quit the program altogether.

When changing colours you should click on a piece of the colour that you
want to change, and then on the base colour required on the colour chart.

Please remember that many hours of work have gone into developing this
game, and as such I expect people to pay the asking price for its` use.

I hope you have a lot of fun with this game.
