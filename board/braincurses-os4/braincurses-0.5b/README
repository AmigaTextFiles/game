The quick-n-dirty rules:

Braincurses is a game of cunning.  The point of the game is to uncover the
secret 4 color code.  The secrect code is chosen randomly by the computer
then the player has 10 (10 is the default, you can change this now at
the command line) tries to guess the correct code.  For each correct
color you'll get a white peg on the left panel.  If you get a correct color
in the correct place you'll get a red peg on the left panel.  The order of
the white and red pegs has no correlation to the user guessed pegs.  (In fact,
the red pegs will always be put first if there are any.)

The player has 6 different colored pegs to chose from:  red, white, blue
green, yellow and purple.  The game will take those colors in the bottom
panel.  Important note, to move into the next field press the *enter* key
not the spacebar!  If you happen to misspell a word it will go back and wait
for you to retry and spell it correctly.  Once you have input your four color
choices and hit enter it will display colored pegs in the center panel
matching your color choices.  If any of your guesses are correct there will
be on the left panel a corresponding white or red peg.

** NOTE **
You may use shortcuts for the colors now!  "r" for red, "b" for blue, etc.

There are more features coming (such as a GTK interface) but since this game
is being done in my free time it takes a while to get things done.  If you have
any suggestions or comments feel free to e-mail me.  I would appreciate any
feedback you are willing to part with.  :-)
