@NODE Introduction

@{b}Introduction:@{ub}
-------------
        
Have you tried playing computer backgammon before?  Were you a little
disappointed?

In the long run, most users will find that this program plays a very
competitive game of backgammon.  Anyone from beginner to expert will 
improve their game by playing and using ProGammon.

This program keeps track of your wins and losses as well as gammons and
backgammons.  The Statistics Page also tabulates each dice roll so you 
can examine the dice for randomness and fairness.

ProGammon works in most any screen mode, it's operating system friendly
yet remains small and very efficient.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Requirements

@{b}Requirements:@{ub}
-------------
       
The screen mode requester that ProGammon uses requires version 38 
of the asl.library which was included with Amiga OS 2.1.

Kickstart 2.04 users can use either the WORKBENCH tool type or the
SCREEN tool type to select their preferred screen mode.

The latest version of this program was developed on a PC using 
@{" WinUAE " LINK WinUAE}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE New "What's New"

@{b}What's New:@{ub} 
-----------

Version 2.91:
      
      -eliminated an Enforcer hit and fixed a bug when screens too 
       large for the available memory were selected.

Version 2.9:
      
      -a complete reworking of the board evaluation routine based on
       years of ProGammon and Yahoo! backgammon experience.
              
      -added a screen mode requester as well as a @{" SCREEN " LINK Tool} tool type.
       This program can be used in most any screen mode now including  
       common UAE graphics modes like  800x600  or  1024x768.  AGA
       color support has also been added.
       
      -added movement dots to the board like Yahoo! uses so you can see
       where to move a stone after selecting it.
       
      -added a rating system similar to what Yahoo! uses.
       
      -also added a @{" NUMBERS " LINK Tool} tool type which will number the board
       from 1 to 24.  This should make it easier for new players to 
       understand the suggested moves feature.

      -reduced the number of stones displayed on each point to 5 and
       added user definable fonts for the GUI.
       
      -improved random number seed value selection when using WinUAE  
       and also added a shuffling technique for improved randomness.  
      
      -fixed a minor bug when selecting and saving Acey-Deucey options
       as well as a million and one other tweaks and fixes which I have 
       long since forgotten about.


Version 2.89:

      -special Amigactive edition.
      
      -added a @{" Resign " LINK Menus} menu item for Nils Goers so he doesn't have to
       play the complete game when he knows that he's already lost it.

Version 2.88:

      -a significant rewrite of the board evaluation routine.  It seems
       to do a better job with many complex endgame situations.
       
      -added a couple of @{" Pip Count " LINK Pip} features. 
        
      -a minor fix that forces users to make both moves whenever possible
       while bearing off.

Version 2.86:

      -a dozen tool types have been replaced by a new @{" Game Options " LINK Options} 
       window.  
     
      -added an @{" Acey-Deucey " LINK Acey} option so users can play some of the more
       popular versions of this backgammon game.

      -the @{" Start On Bar " LINK Options} option will start the game with 15 stones on 
       the bar.

      -the @{" Doubles Bonus " LINK Options} option will let players have an extra move 
       everytime they roll doubles.
        
      -my opinion on what the best @{" Opening Moves " LINK Open} are.
          
      -registration info is now displayed in an Amiga style requester.
      
      -the usual minor change or two in game play.   

Version 2.83:
     
      -the random opening moves feature has been fixed so it finally works
       the way I intended.  It also works in  TRAINER  mode now.
       
      -an optimized version for users with a 68020 or better is included. 

Version 2.82:
     
      -fixed a minor bug that sometimes caused stones to be created just
       outside the main board when using  Undo Move.
       
      -fixed the stats screen text color so it should now be the same 
       color as used elsewhere.
      
      -changed the menu background color so it's easier to see.
      
      -added a @{" No Border " LINK Options} feature.

      -a couple of very minor changes in game play.
       
      -changed the default palette.  Thanks go to Tomas Amsrud for this 
       combination of colors.  Now it looks as good as it plays!

Version 2.8:

      -the way the dice are rolled has been changed.  If you think this
       program cheats then read @{" The Dice " LINK Dice} section.

      -lots and lots of new  Tool Types.  Also check the @{" Advanced " LINK Advanced}
       section for their use.
      
        USERDICE makes it simple to use your own dice by entering in each 
        roll from the keyboard.
        
        SHOWMOVE displays the previous Amiga move. 
      
        JENA allows you to play the game the way Volkmar does in Jena,
        Germany.  Players are limited to a maximum of 5 stones per point
        in Jena.
      
        RANDOM enables random opening moves.  Another Volkmar suggestion
        which results in a variety of opening moves, including some
        non-traditional ones.   
        
        CPU
        MAN
        These two allow you to set the board up however you like.
       
        CPUFIRST
        MANFIRST
        These last two allow either player to have the first move 
        regardless of the opening role.
      
      -a new @{ " Auto Play " LINK Auto} feature.  One mouse click in the lower right
       corner of the board and the Amiga will move your stones for
       you.  An Amiga vs Amiga match can be kind of interesting.

      -also added a second set of dice to the board.  Should be a
       little easier to understand and review previous moves.

      -another 101 changes in the AI, some good some not so good!
       This version plays a little different style of backgammon compared
       to previous versions so try playing a few hundred games before
       passing judgement.  It's a work in progress!

      -a new  [ Clear Stats ]  button in the  Color Window  so you can 
       reset your statistics without changing the board colors that you 
       have saved in your  gammon.prefs  file.
      
      -and finally, a slightly redesigned, recolored icon.

Version 2.7:

      -added a tool type called TRAINER.  This allows the user to
       ask ProGammon to suggest a move anytime during gameplay.  A
       second opinion is useful, even if you don't agree with it!
       
      -finally, a PAL tool type so the program will now work in
       640 x 256 hi-res PAL mode if needed.
      
      -the last release introduced a major change in game play.  This
       version merely contains some minor adjustments.

      -added a new section on interpreting the winning percentage.

           Your  HOME  area is positions 1 to 6.



There are 24 positions on the board and each player begins with 15 stones.
'X' represents your stones and the 'O' represents the Amiga's stones.  In
the diagram above you have 2 stones on position 24, 3 stones on position
8 and 5 stones each on positions 6 and 13.  The 3 and the 5 in the middle
right side of the board represent your dice roll.

Each player takes turns rolling the dice and moving their stones an amount
equal to whatever was rolled.

The object of the game is to move your stones in a clockwise direction
into your home area.  When all 15 stones are home you can remove them from
the board depending on what you roll.  The first player who removes all of
their stones from the board wins the game.

The game starts with each player rolling one die to determine which player
gets to go first.  For example, if the Amiga rolled a 3 and you rolled a
5 then you would start by using this combination for your first move.
Here is one possibility:

With the 3 I moved one stone from position 24 to position 21.  For the
second move I moved a stone from position 13 to position 8.  After the
opening move each player alternates rolling the dice.

Either player can move to any position as long as it is not blocked by 2
or more of the opposing players stones.  In the above example I would not
have been allowed to use the 5 to move a stone from position 24 to
position 19 because the Amiga has position 19 blocked.

It is possible to move to a position that has only 1 Amiga stone on it.
When this happens, your stone will take possession of that point and the
Amiga stone will be knocked off onto the center bar.  Any stone on the
bar has to enter the board in the opposing players home area.  You must
get back on the board, on a point that is not blocked, before any further
moves are allowed.  If you cannot make a move just click once on the dice
to give up your turn and resume play.

When all of your stones are home, you can start removing them from the
board.  This is called bearing off.  If, for example, you rolled a 6 and
a 2, you could remove one stone from position 6 and another one from
position 2.  If you rolled a 6 but didn't have any stones on position 6
to remove then you are allowed to take one stone off the next highest
position.  It is also legal to move stones within your home area rather
than bearing them off.  It might be an advantage to do this if the Amiga
still has some stones in your home area and is trying to knock you off
onto the bar.

The only other rule is that both players must use as much of what they
rolled as possible.  If you rolled a 5 and a 3 and it is possible to use
both the 5 and the 3 then you must make both moves.  If you can only use
the 5 or the 3 but not both then you are required to use the higher
amount, the 5 in this case.

@NODE Game "Game Play"

@{b}Game Play:@{ub} 
---------- 

To move a stone just click once on the stone and then once on the spot
where you want it to go.  If you did it right then the stone should move 
to the new location or else a message will appear to help you out.

If you roll doubles ( i.e. two 3's ) then instead of getting two moves
of 3 you get four moves of 3.  

Anytime during a move you can get an update to how many moves you have
left by clicking anywhere outside the main board area.  In the message
area will be displayed the dice values that have not been used yet.

You can also make multiple moves.  If, for example, you roll a  3  and
a  4  then you are allowed to make one move of  7  as long as both points
between your present location and your destination are not blocked.

If you are unable to make a move then just click once on the dice to
continue with the game.  If you select a stone by mistake then just click
on that same stone to start your move over again.

Once all your stones are in your home area, you can remove them from the
board by double clicking on them.

A gammon will be declared if one player is able to get all his stones off
before the other player has removed one.  This is equivalent to winning 2
games.  

A backgammon occurs when one player gammons the other player plus he traps
at least one of the opposing players stones in his home area.  This is
worth 3 wins.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Acey "Acey-Deucey"

@{b}Acey-Deucey:@{ub}
------------

The rules of backgammon are more or less written in stone but there is a
lot of different ways to play the game of Acey-Deucey.  I've implemented
some of the more common versions.

An acey-deucey is any roll of (1,2) or (2,1).  If you are able to use 
both the 1 and the 2 then you are entitled to roll again.  Acey-Deuceys
are not awarded on the initial roll since both players are only rolling
one die.

Selecting  Acey-Deucey  in the options window will allow you to play one 
of 3 versions.

 GameTypes:

   1)  one additional roll.
 
   2)  one additional roll of doubles.  The player gets to select 
       whatever double would be most to their advantage.
     
   3)  the same as game #2 but after moving your double,  you also get 
       to re-roll the dice.  If you're lucky you might roll another 
       acey-deucey so you can repeat this process again!
     
     
I have found that #3 seems to be the most widely played version.  Most 
players also play Acey-Deucey by starting out with 15 stones on the bar.
To play a version like this:

    1)  Select  Options  in the menus.
    2)  Select  Acey-Deucey and set it to  3.
    3)  Select  Start On Bar.

Many thanks to Dennis Vasile for helping me with the above rules and for
his encouragement.  Though not optimized to play Acey-Deucey, ProGammon
manages to play a half decent game anyhow.

Send me your rules for Acey-Deucey if they differ from the above.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Options "Game Options"

@{b}Game Options:@{ub}
-------------

Selecting  Options  in the main menu will now bring up a window where 
you can adjust and set any of the following parameters:


[ Start On Bar ]

Both players start the game with all 15 of their stones on the bar.


[ Doubles Bonus ]
        
This variation gives players an extra move every time they roll doubles.


[ User Dice ]

You can use your own dice and enter values in from the keyboard.


[ Suggest Moves ]
        
With this option set, the Amiga will suggest a move for you to make by
clicking anywhere on the lower part of the board.  For example, if the 
opening roll was  ( 2 - 3 ) then the Amiga might display this:

    13/11  24/21
    
This means move one of your stones from the 13 point to the 11 point and
move another stone from the 24 point to the 21 point.  The points are
numbered from 1 to 24 with 24 being the farthest point away from your home
area.  See @{" The Basics " LINK Basic} for further board numbering 
information or use the NUMBERS tool type.

A display of  Bar/23  means move a stone from the Bar to point 23 and
5/-  suggests that you should bear a stone off of the 5 point by double
clicking on it.


[ Show CPU Move ]
        
This one displays what the previous move for the Amiga was in the upper 
left portion of the screen.        
    
    
[ Confirm Move ]
        
With this option you will have to click on your dice after each move to
signal to the Amiga that you are done.  Some users like to be able to see
how a move looks before having to commit themselves to it.


[ Reverse Board ]
        
I prefer setting up the board so that you move your stones from the
upper left part of the screen to the lower left in a clockwise direction.
If you would prefer that the board was set up so that your stones move
from the upper right part of the board to the lower right in a counter-
clockwise direction then use this option.


[ Random Moves ]
        
Starting with v2.8, the first/opening move is somwhat random.  Of the 15
opening moves, 9 of them have 2 or 3 unique possibilities.  For example,
if the Amiga rolled a 6 and you rolled a 4 it might make one of the
following moves:

       a)  1 / 7      7 / 11
       b)  1 / 7     12 / 16
       c)  1 / 5      1 /  7
       
This option only applies to the opening move and has no effect during
the game.


[ 5 Stone Max ]

You'll be limited to a maximum of 5 stones on each point at any one time
with this option.  Six or more stones on a point is not allowed.  A good
option to encourage players not to stack all their stones on the same
point.  This game type should work better in version 2.9.


[ No Borders ]

This will cause the border around the board to be the same color as the
outside board color which will eliminate the border.        


[ Amiga Starts ]  or  [ You Start ]

Either of these can be used to force the program to let you or the Amiga
start first regardless of who wins the opening role.

@NODE Menus

@{b}Menus:@{ub}
------ 

@{u}Undo Move@{uu}        

 You can restart your move from the beginning by selecting this from the
 menus.  You could also accomplish the same thing by clicking on the
 stone and putting it back wherever it came from.

@{u}Auto Finish@{uu}
        
 Selecting this will place the game into automatic mode and finish the
 game for you.


@{u}Stats@{uu}

 This menu item will display a table of what you have rolled so far as
 well as what your average roll has been.  A long term average roll of
 about 8.144 should be expected.
 
 Statistics on wins/gammons/backgammons are now also displayed within
 this window.
 
 Clicking on the left side of the stats window will show the statistics
 for the present series of games and clicking on the right side will show
 the overall statistics for all games that have been played, including 
 previous games stored in the  gammon.prefs  file.

@{u}Options@{uu}
 
 This will open a window where you can adjust various @{" Game Options " LINK Options}.

@{u}Colors@{uu}

 Selecting this will allow you to adjust both the board colors as well
 as the speed of the game.  


 @{b}IMPORTANT  STUFF@{ub} ------------------------------------------------------

 If you select  @{b}Save@{ub}  in the Colors adjustment window then your game
 preferences will be saved to a 390 byte file called  gammon.prefs  in 
 the current directory.  The program keeps track of the AMIGA's winning
 percentage in this file as well as statistics on the dice.
 
 If you want these features then remember to click on  @{b}Save@{ub}  before the 
 end of the first game.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
@{u}Resign@{uu}
        
 This will stop the present game and award the victory to the Amiga.  
 Obviously, the only time that you would think about using  Resign  is
 when you are way behind and have absolutely no chance of winning.
 
 After you select  Resign  a requester will tell you how many games it's
 going to cost you.  The Amiga will get 1 win if you  Resign;  2 wins if
 you haven't removed any stones and 3 wins if you still have one or more
 of your stones trapped in the Amiga's home area.
 
 You also have the option of continuing the game if you think you can do
 better.

@NODE Tool "Tool Types"

@{b}Tool Types:@{ub}
-----------

    FONTNAME=topaz
    FONTSIZE=8

These 2 tool types allow you to use any reasonably sized font for your
menus, message display and window title in VGA mode.  If the program is
unable to find this font then it will use topaz 8 as the default.


    GUIFONTNAME=topaz
    GUIFONTSIZE=8
    
This font will be used in the Options window, the Color adjustment window
as well as in the statistics window.  The GUI font has to be proportional
in order for the statistics page to be properly formatted.  The included
gammon font works quite well at 800x600 or 1024x768.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
If there are any problems with option windows not opening up then it is
likely because the GUI font you are trying to use is too BIG.  Using a 
24 point font on a 640x200 NTSC screeen is not going to work properly.   
------------------------------------------------------------------------



    NAME=

Use the above so you won't be called Buddy anymore.  My dog appreciates
it.  Name lengths can now be as long as 19 characters including spaces.


    NUMBERS
    
This will number the points on the board from 1 to 24.   


    SCREEN=
   
This tool type will bypass the initial screen mode requester window.
Simply use any 8 digit hexidecimal screen mode code.  After you have
found a screen mode that you like you can run the included program  
ScreenTool  to find the appropriate code. 

SCREEN=50041000  will automatically open up an 8 bit - 800x600 UAE 
SVGA screen.  SCREEN=29000  or  SCREEN=00029000 will open up the 
default PAL High Res screen with a resolution of 640x256.


    WORKBENCH
    
If 8 digit hexidecimal screen mode codes are hurting your brain then
simply use the WORKBENCH tool type.  ProGammon will now try and use
a screen mode the same as what you are presently using for your main
Workbench screen.  Very simple.    


    CUBE
    
This is the start of a doubling cube.  So far, it only doubles the stakes
of the game when both players roll the same thing on the opening roll.
A mouse click in the upper right hand corner will show you the present
status of the cube when this option is activated.

    

    CPU=
    MAN=
    
These two tool types will allow you to set the board up any way you wish.
The format for version 2.9 has changed and is more flexible.

Here's how it works:

    CPU=02000000000050000305
    MAN=0000005030000500000000002
    
Those 2 lines entered as tool types would allow you to set the board
up in the traditional manner.  The first digit corresponds to the number
of stones on the bar.  The next 24 positions on the board correspond
to the next 24 digits after the first zero.

The board is numbered from 1 to 24.  See  @{" The Basics " LINK Basic}.  The first line 
translates as follows.  The CPU has 0 stones on the bar, 2 stones on the
1 point, 5 stones on the 12 point, 3 on the 17 point and 5 more on the 
19 point.

Both tool types are not required.  You can use either, neither or both.

The letters A through F are also available to place between 10 and 15
stones on any point.

Another example: if you wanted to set the board up so that the game starts
with 15 stones on the bar for the Amiga and 10 stones on the bar for you
then use the following:

    CPU=F
    MAN=A


The first digit represents the bar so CPU=F will place 15 stones on the
bar and MAN=A places 10 stones on the bar for you.  There is nothing
else after the F or the A so nothing else will be placed on the board.


    NODICETABLE
    
This program normally rolls the dice 1024 times and then saves the
results in a big look up table.  If you would like to have the dice rolled
in real time then use the above tool type to prevent the dice table from
being created.


    DOUBLETEST
    
Some people complain that there are either too many or not enough doubles
rolled in a game.  The above tool type will keep track of how many
doubles are rolled each game and then a small table will be created in a
file in your RAM: directory called  doubles.txt.  There will most likely
be 8 doubles rolled during a game but there may be games in which no 
doubles are rolled for either player.  There may be other games where 
a total of more than 25 doubles occur.  These events though are extremely 
rare.
  
There is a 95% probability that between 4 and 15 doubles will occur during
a traditional game of backgammon.  I have included a sample  doubles.txt  
file that was output after a set of 100000 games showing the outcomes.  


    REGISTER=
    
This tool type is used to register the program.  You can register this
program by sending me an e-mail and telling me what you think.  This will
remove the About nag requester when the program first starts and motivate
me to add another feature or two someday like a real doubling cube.    

@ENDNODE

@NODE Auto "Auto Mode"

@{b}Auto Mode:@{ub}
----------

Clicking the mouse in the lower right portion of the board will start
automatic game play.  The center portion of the bar will change colors
while you're in Auto Mode.  The Amiga now takes over rolling the dice
and making moves for both players.

Basically, this turns the program into Amiga vs Amiga game play.

Let the computer play overnight and then you can check the  Stats  screen
to see if the dice really are random.  Also check for wins/gammons etc.

Novice players may learn a thing or two by watching the game play against
itself.

A single click of the mouse anywhere should return control to the user.

This feature is handy when you are way ahead or behind in a game and the 
outcome is obvious.  Put the program into Auto Mode and then sit back 
while the Amiga completes the game for you.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Open "Opening Moves"

@{b}Opening Moves:@{ub}
--------------

There are 15 unique opening moves possible in the game of backgammon.
For thousands of years there has been the ongoing debate of what is the
best way to play each one.

I did some extensive Amiga vs Amiga testing to try and compare some of
the moves that are recommended in various backgammon texts.

In real backgammon situations where you need a gammon to win a multi-
point match then it's possible that some opening moves with a poor 
overall winning percentage might actually be preferred because they have 
a better gammon winning percentage.  A doubling cube could also change
these results significantly.

I am not here to claim that the moves found are the ultimate opening 
moves.  If the level that PG plays at is not strong enough then these 
results may be meaningless.  If your style of game play is significantly
different than how ProGammon plays then your opening moves are also
likely going to be different.

The following opening moves are recommended when playing single point 
games against ProGammon and make a good starting point for most players.

Version 2.9 Update:  This program plays more of a running game compared
to previous versions.  Some of the opening moves that ProGammon uses
have changed based on the following tests.  Previous test results are 
listed in the right hand column for comparison.  

The initial results were based on 20,000 game sets and to improve 
accuracy I used sets of 40,000 games.  There is a 95% probability that
these results are accurate to within plus or minus ( +/- 0.005 ).
Previously, using 20,000 game sets, there was a 95% probability that
the results were accurate to witin plus or minus ( +/- 0.007 ).

When two moves are within 0.010 of each other after 40 000 games then 
either one could come out on top during a larger set of games and 
should be considered equal.  

After 2 million games of Amiga vs Amiga, here are the results:


ROLL     YOUR MOVE         RESULTS        OLD

2-1     13/11, 24/23  PM    0.503        0.495
        24/22, 24/23        0.494        -----
        24/21               0.493        0.500
        13/11,  6/ 5        0.470        0.460
        
New testing shows that the first move is slightly superior to the
other ones.  The last move is recommended in many aggressive backgammon
books but it has yet to prove it's worth during testing.


3-1      8/ 5,  6/ 5  PM    0.569        0.575

No one in their right mind would disagree with this opening move.


3-2     24/21, 24/22        0.516        -----
        24/21, 13/11        0.510        0.510
        13/10, 24/22        0.496        0.490
        13/ 8               0.489        0.480
        13/10, 13/11  PM    0.475        0.460

I decided to test running both stones off of the 24 point this time
around and it has turned out to be the best opening move for a 3-2.
I call this move the double run and it is even more effective when
you open with a 4-3.  The second and third moves are similar in style 
with the advantage going to splitting your 24 point as far as possible.  
The fourth and the fifth moves should be avoided.

I had a chance recently to re-read the most respected backgammon book,
Backgammon by Paul Magriel.  He recommends running 2 stones off of the
13 point for both this move and for an opening 4-3.  My program rates
both of these moves at the bottom of the heap.

Some players defend these moves by saying that they result in more
gammon opportunities.  My testing showed that you will win a gammon or
a backgammon 11.3% of the time but you would have an 11.4% chance of a
gammon if you opened with the second move.  There was virtually no 
difference. 

Percentage wise, you're better off trying to win 2 single games back to 
back compared to setting out to win a gammon.         

Read Paul Magriel's book.  I may not agree with his opening moves but
overall his book is excellent and well worth reading.  The initials PM
in my charts represent the moves that he recommended back in 1973.


4-1     13/ 9, 24/23  PM    0.494        0.490
        24/20, 24/23        0.491        -----
        13/ 8               0.489        0.480
        13/ 9,  6/ 5        0.461        0.455
        
A 4-1 roll was the worst opening move found.  In a real game of back-
gammon perhaps you could be generous and offer it to your opponent.  
The first move is recommended and the second and third moves are also 
ok.  The last move might work against a weak opponent but it should 
generally be avoided.


4-2      8/ 4,  6/ 4  PM    0.543        0.545

An excellent opening move.  Nothing else for a 4-2 is as good.


4-3     24/20, 24/21        0.523        ----- 
        24/20, 13/10        0.506        0.510 
        13/ 9, 24/21        0.505        0.510  
        13/ 9, 13/10  PM    0.464        0.455 
        
Once again the double run is the best way to play this move.  This puts
a lot of pressure on your opponent and hinders their ability to build 
up a wall.  The second and third moves are quite similar but neither 
one is as good.


5-1     13/ 8, 24/23  PM    0.506        0.505
        24/18               0.506        0.495
        
The first move is the generally recommended one but the second move has
now pulled even with it.  Backgammon legend Kit Woolsey calls the second 
move "horrible" but I can think of some other opening moves that are far 
more horrible than it.


5-2     13/ 8, 24/22        0.507        0.495
        13/ 8, 13/11  PM    0.485        0.480
        13/ 6               0.473        0.475

Once again, splitting the 24 point seems to work.  The third move is 
considered too conservative.


5-3     13/ 8, 24/21        0.514        0.510 
         8/ 3,  6/ 3        0.500        0.515
        13/ 8, 13/10  PM    0.472        0.470
        
There is a slight advantage here to splitting the 24 point as opposed to
making an inner board point.  Kit calls the third move "vastly inferior" 
and I agree.


5-4     24/15               0.516        0.510
        13/ 8, 24/20        0.502        0.540
        13/ 8, 13/ 9  PM    0.480        0.470
        
Running from the 24 point is a good move but slotting your opponent's
golden point might be better if you use a holding type of game play.
Once again, running two stones off of the 13 point proves to be a 
weak move.


6-1     13/ 7,  8/ 7  PM    0.585        0.545

Securing the bar point is the best move for this combination.  Now that
ProGammon depends on a running game, it is best to block this key point
as soon as possible.  This move has overtaken a 3-1 as the ultimate 
opening move.


6-2     24/18, 13/11        0.526        0.515
        24/16         PM    0.516        0.505
        24/18, 24/22        0.513        0.520
        13/ 5               0.475        0.470
        
The first move for a 6-2 is quite common and either the straight run or
a double run are viable alternatives.  I decided to try the fourth move 
after reading about it in many books written in the early seventies.  I 
can think of 3 other moves that I would be using first.


6-3     24/15         PM    0.521        0.510
        24/18, 24/21        0.519        0.525
        24/18, 13/10        0.514        0.515
        
All three of these moves are very competitive with a slight advantage to
either the straight run or the double run.  


6-4     24/14         PM    0.520        0.510
        24/18, 13/ 9        0.516        0.525
        24/18, 24/20        0.509        0.535
         8/ 2,  6/ 2        0.466        0.490
        
Very similar to the previous move.  The straight run is now followed by 
a traditional move where you move one stone off of your 24 point and one
off of the 13 point.  The double run for this move is ok but it is obvious
you should avoid making your 2 point this early in the game.


6-5     24/13         PM    0.560        0.545
        24/18, 13/ 8        0.526        0.535
        13/ 7, 13/ 8        0.470        0.455

During original testing the second move was competitive with the first
move but the traditional first move is clearly the only one that should 
be considered.

Finally, the last move was recommended in everyones favorite backgammon
book, Backgammon for Blood by Bruce Becker.  The author thought the first 
move, "the lover's leap", to be way too conservative.  Good luck making 
this move work!


The above results correspond well with modern backgammon thinking. Start
your games with the above moves and you will be well on your way to 
becoming a better backgammon player.

@NODE Close "Closing Moves"

@{b}Closing Moves:@{ub}
--------------

Everyone studies and debates the opening moves in backgammon but what
about the closing moves.  I am referring to positioning your final two
stones to maximize the probability that you will get both of them off
with your next roll and win the game.

Many inexperienced players can make a mistake here and end up losing
a game that they should have and could have won.

Example time.  Suppose you have two stones left, 1 on your 6 point and
the other one on your 4 point.  Now suppose you roll a ( 1, 2 ).  You
can't bear anything off with this roll but how should you position
yourself to better your chances of winning with your next roll?

If you moved the stone from your 4 point to your 1 point then you would
be left with stones on the 1 and the 6.  You could also choose to move
the stone from the 6 point down to the 3 point leaving you with stones
on the 3 and the 4 point.  The last possibility would be to move the
6 stone to the 5 point and to move the stone from the 4 point to the
2 point.  


STONES LEFT    WINNING MOVES    PERCENTAGE
    1-1              36           100.0%
    1-2              36           100.0%

    1-5              23            63.9%
    1-6              15            41.7%
    2-2              26            72.2%
    2-3              25            69.4%

    3-6              10            27.8%
    4-4              11            30.6%
    4-5              10            27.8%
    4-6               8            22.2% 
    5-5               6            16.7%
    5-6               6            16.7%
    6-6               4            11.1%


When you roll a set of dice there are 36 different possiblities.  In the
chart above 1-1 means you have two stones left and they are both on the
1 point.  With your next roll of the dice there are 36 of a possible 36
rolls that will win the game for you.

In my example you are left with the choice of leaving your stones on 
either the 1 and the 6, the 2 and the 5 or the 3 and the 4 point.

1-6 = 0.417
3-4 = 0.472
2-5 = 0.528


It is obvious from the above that leaving your stones on the 2 and the 5
is the best move.  Correctly playing your closing move can be far more 
rewarding to your winning percentage than correctly playing your opening 
move.  Unfortunately, games are often times decided before this stage.
Version 2.9 of ProGammon does a better job setting up for the close.


If you can't memorize the above table then simply remember to space out 
your last two stones by 2 or 3 positions and avoid stacking them on the 
same point.

@NODE Pip "The Pip Count"

@{b}Counting Pips:@{ub}
--------------

Backgammon strategy depends on whether you're ahead or behind in the race
home.  It's not smart to make overly risky moves when you are way ahead 
but you better start making some aggresive moves if you've fallen behind.

One way to determine if you are ahead or behind is called counting pips
or points.  At the start of a normal game of backgammon, each player will
have to roll 167 points to bring all their stones home and bear them off.


    Stones      Point       Pips
       2    x     24    =    48
       5    x     13    =    65
       3    x      8    =    24
       5    x      6    =    30
                           ----
                            167
                            
                            
At any time during the game you can go through the board and do this
calculation.  If the Amiga's pip count is 120 and yours is only 90 then
you are leading the race by 30 points.  A positive difference means that
you are leading and a negative difference means that you are behind.

The Amiga will calculate the pip count difference and display it at the
lower left part of the screen.  During game play, simply click the mouse
once on the Amiga dice to display this information.


My Method:
----------

Most backgammon books use the above method for counting pips but I found
that the number returned isn't always meaningful, especially when bearing
off has begun.

For example, who's winning if you have 12 stones left on your 1 point and 
the Amiga has 2 stones left on its 6 point (point 19 on the board).  Both 
players have a pip count of 12 points but it is obvious that the Amiga is
going to win most of the time.  Even if you get to roll first, the Amiga
will win 99.9% of the time so a net pip of 0, which suggests that the game
is even, is completely misleading.


RollPip:
--------

I decided to come up with a slightly more complex calculation that takes
the above situation into account.  My pip count is called the RollPip or
Rolls for short.

It measures how many rolls of the dice are required for each player to
bear all their stones off and then displays the difference.  Once again,
a positive number means that you are leading and a negative number means
that you are behind.

Click on the Amiga dice to get this number displayed in the lower left
part of the window.  A display of  Rolls = 3.0  means that the Amiga will
need approximately 3 extra rolls of the dice to get back in the race.  
A large double or knocking one of your stones off to the bar will even 
things up in a hurry. 

If  Rolls = 0.0  is displayed then the Amiga has determined that the 
race is about dead even.  If this is displayed before you make your move 
then you are probably slightly ahead since you have control of the dice.
A poor roll like (1,2) means that you'll likely be behind after your turn
is complete whereas an above average roll like double sixes (6,6) will 
definitely put you clearly ahead in the race.

In the above example, the Pip is 0 but Rolls = -3.7. This suggests that
you don't have a snowballs chance in hell of winning the game which was
proven correct.


Conclusion:
-----------

Both of these methods of counting pips are only simple approximations of
who is winning the game.  They don't take into account good positions like
having some stones trapped behind a prime of 6 or having one of your
opponents stones on the bar while you have a closed inner board.

@NODE Dice "Testing the Dice"

@{b}The Dice:@{ub}
---------

The dice are generated using the SAS/C random number generating function
called drand48().  I have done a 1001 tests and rolled these dice a 100
million times and I am thoroughly convinced that the numbers returned by 
this function are 100% random.  There is no difference whatsoever between 
the randomness of the dice in ProGammon compared to a real pair of dice 
rolled by the typical user. 

Most computer backgammon players are very suspicious of the dice, never 
when they win but always when they lose!  The dice are now pre-rolled
before the first game.  There are enough pre-determined dice rolls for 
approximately 20 complete games.  No program can predict what moves you
are going to make so it is absolutely impossible to arrange the dice file
to the advantage/disadvantage of either player.
       
If the Amiga rolls double 6's for it's last roll and wins it is because 
it got damn lucky!

You can now see exactly what dice rolls are coming up.  At the start of a
game when it says,  Click Mouse To Roll  , just click the mouse in the 
lower left corner of the board.  This will create a file called  dice.txt  
in your  RAM:  directory.  This file contains what the dice are going to 
roll for the next, approximately, 20 games.  Any statistical analysis on 
this file will prove to you the 100% randomness of the dice.  

No more suspicious, surprise, miracle rolls for the Amiga!


Every roll of the dice is also kept track of in the  gammon.prefs  file 
after you select  Quit  in the menus or close the game screen.  

During the game, you can select  Stats  in the menus to see the averages 
for the games that you are presently playing.  By clicking on the right 
portion of the statistics screen you can also examine the stats saved in 
the  gammon.prefs  file.


Is there any way now that ProGammon can cheat?  Sure.  The program could
cheat by looking ahead in the dice file.  It's obvious that the Amiga
could make a risky move if it knew for sure that your next roll would
not give you the opportunity to make contact.  It could also avoid risky
moves if it determined that your next roll would make contact.

Does it cheat like this?  Certainly not, and I can prove it!

After the first roll, every move is predictable and repeatable.  What 
this means is that if the board is set up in a certain way and a certain
number shows up on the dice then it is always going to make the exact
same move regardless of what's in the dice file.

If you witness a very suspicious looking move during game play then stop
and do the following.

There are now @{" Options " LINK Options} and @{" Tool Types " LINK Tool} available for you to recreate 
the exact same situation.  Once you have recreated the position of the 
stones on the board, you can then use the  User Dice  option to enter in 
what the dice roll was.  Turn off the  Random Moves  option and the Amiga 
should now proceed to make the identical move to what it made during game 
play.

This proves that the dice file is not being used in any way to gain an 
advantage over you.  It would have made that exact same move anyhow.


I have done everything I can think of to prove that ProGammon does not 
cheat.  I really have nothing to gain by writing such a program.

If you don't trust ProGammon rolling the dice this way then you can use
the tool type  NODICETABLE  and the dice will be rolled in real time as
they are needed.  If you don't trust the internal random number generator
then you can always use your own dice with this program by selecting the
User Dice option.

If you have any other "it cheats" theories then let me know and I will
be happy to prove to you otherwise.  My butt is covered!


Remember, winning against this game is easy.  Don't use "bad dice" as an 
excuse for playing a "bad game"!

@NODE Math "Interesting Stuff"

@{b}Math Facts:@{ub}
-----------

This section is optional but if your background in mathematics is fairly
strong then you may find what follows very interesting.


Let's say there are 2 computer backgammon players that are completely 
equal. They use the exact same algorithm.  In the long run, they will both
win 50% of the games that they play against each other.

Now, you know from playing ProGammon that in a short set of games you can
be either a hero or a bum!  Recently, I went 1 Win and 9 Losses during a
set of 10 games.  At other times, I have gone 9 Wins and 1 Loss.

The point I'm trying to make is that you can't judge a player or a game
over a small set of games.  A 10 game set neither proves that a player
or program is stupid or brilliant.  There is a lot of luck involved in a
game of backgammon.  This is why you have to play a large number of games
before the winning percentage starts to have some real meaning.

So, the question is, how many games is enough?  Is 100 games enough, or
300, or 500, or perhaps even 900?  I have played a couple of 300 game
sets and by then the average dice rolls for both players were nearly even.
I used to think that at this point the winning percentage would start to
have some real meaning.

Guess what?  Mathematically, or scientifically speaking, this number
really doesn't mean as much as you might think.

Even after playing 500 games, 2 completely equal players can have their
winning percentage vary between 0.400 and 0.600.  Most of the time they
are going to win about 250 games each because they are equally skilled.
However, one player may get extremely lucky over a 500 game set and end 
up winning 300 games and the other player only 200.  Believe it or not,
this can happen even though they are completely equal.

I've included a computer generated chart to help explain this further. 


The implications are kind of interesting.

The amount of variation quoted above is between 2 players that play
consistent backgammon.  They never get tired and they never learn from
their mistakes.  The moves they make never change or evolve.

People, on the other hand, as they learn are constantly changing how they
play backgammon.  They find a particular style of play that seems to work
over 100 games and they stick to it.  What doesn't work is abandoned.

There is so much variation in a game of backgammon, that coming to any
conclusions concerning what works and what doesn't is often times wrong! 
The amount of variation increases when you add in the fact that people
get tired and the decisions they make concerning when to run, when to 
hit, etc., etc. are constantly changing. 

 
Have a look at the following chart:

    0.700  ->          0         0         0         0


Ok now, what do all these numbers really mean??

I wrote a program to simulate 2 Amigas playing backgammon against each
other.  I've also subsequently used Amiga vs Amiga mode to confirm these
numbers.  They are both using the same algorithm and are both as equal as
can be.

The first column is the winning percentage just like what is displayed
in ProGammon.

The second through fifth columns represent sets of games that they played
against each other.  The two Amigas were always fighting about who was the
better backgammon player so they started by playing sets of 100 games.
At the end of each set of 100 games, Player A would see what his winning
percentage was and then he would add 1 to the appropriate row.

The first time they got together to determine a champion they played
10,000 sets of 100 games each.  (i.e. 10,000 x 100 = 1,000,000 games)
If you look at the table you will see that they played dead even at
( 0.500 ) 824 out of the 10,000 sets they played ( 8.24% of the time ). 

If you look up at the 0.350 level you will see that on 10 occasions
Amiga A had a winning percentage of only 0.350 after a 100 game set.
These two players are totally equal but because of the luck of the dice,
look how poorly Amiga A did on 10 different occasions.

There was also 13 other times when his winning percentage was worse.  On
those occasions Amiga A only won between 0.300 and 0.340 of the time.


What this proves is that if you play 100 games and you think the winning
percentage is telling you whether you're a good player or ProGammon is a
good program is nonsense.  You can't come to any conclusions whatsoever.


On one occasion Player A won only 30 of 100 games and at the other extreme
one time Player A won 69 out of 100 games.  This large variation isn't
because Player A or B were playing tremendously or lousy.  They were
always playing equally intelligently.  The variation is due solely to
the randomness of the dice.

If you look at the other columns you will see that there is still a lot
of variation even when they sat down and played 300 game sets, 500 game
sets and finally they played a 900 game set 10,000 times.

Even after playing a 900 game set of backgammon, the winning percentage
varied between 0.440 and 0.560.  If your winning percentage is 0.560
after playing 900 games, you have not proven that you are clearly 
superior. 

Though unlikely, it is still possible that you were just lucky.  It is
possible that you could play another 900 game set and the Amiga could
come out on top.

Give the above some thought after you win or lose 10 games in a row!


Version 2.9 Update:

I finally found a book on statistics so if you think all of the above
is a bunch of bunk then read on.


The above chart represents a Binomial Distribution.  

Knowing that, it can be shown that in a 100 game set, 2 equal players 
should win between 45 and 55 games 72.9% of the time and should win 
between 40 and 60 games 96.5% of the time.

The factorial of 100, used for this calculation, is a 157 digit long 
number.  It's not practical to work with such huge numbers so the
normal distribution is usually used to approximate the results when
dealing with larger sets of games.    

Using the normal distribution, 95.4% of the time the winning percentage
will be within plus or minus 2 standard deviations of the mean.

For a 100 game set with a probability of 0.50, the mean equals 50 and
the standard deviation is equal to 5. In other words, 95.4% of the 
time, when two equal players play a 100 game set they can expect to 
win 50 plus or minus 10 games.  The winning percentage will therefore 
be between 0.400 and 0.600 which is a very good approximation to the 
actual results above.  

Here are some calculations for larger sets of games using the normal
approximation method:


GAME SET    STANDARD DEVIATION     WINNING PERCENTAGE
  100              5.000             0.400 - 0.600
  300              8.660             0.442 - 0.558
  400             10.000             0.450 - 0.550
  500             11.180             0.455 - 0.545
  900             15.000             0.467 - 0.533
  

What this all means is don't get too excited when you have a bad night
playing Yahoo! backgammon.  I have found that most highly ranked players, 
who have earned their rankings honestly by playing against other highly 
ranked players, are not winning more than 55% of the games they play.

In fact, I found one player with a ranking of over 3500 points yet his 
winning percentage was only 0.504.  The Yahoo ranking system is mostly 
based on the number of games completed.  If you play 10,000+ games and 
you win half of them then you can have a top ranking at Yahoo too.


I decided to create a somewhat similar rating system in ProGammon.  Win 
some games and your rating will go up, lose some and it will go down.  
After you have completed 100 games you will be able to see how you are
doing by clicking on the Amiga's dice a couple of times.

A long term 2000 point ProGammon player should be competitive with most 
any player they meet at Yahoo! or anywhere else.

Unlike Yahoo, the ProGammon rating number should become more meaningful
as you play more and more games.  The Yahoo number seems to become 
completely meaningless after playing thousands of games.

@{b}Backgammon Simulations:@{ub}
-----------------------

During a game of backgammon you often times get to a stage when you have
to make a decision about whether to run home, make a hit, hold on to a 
key point or whatever.

One way to compare 2 moves is to write down what the board would look
like after each move.  Now, let the computer play against itself a few
thousand times for each version.  Compare the resulting 2 different
winning percentages and you might get some more insight into what the
best move to make is.

You can also do this sort of testing on moves recommended by the experts.
You will find that PG still has plenty of room for improvement!

In order to be able to do this kind of testing then you are going to 
need the following tools:


    CPU=
    MAN=
    
These two tool types will allow you to set the board up anyway you wish.


    [ Amiga Starts ]
    [ You Start ]
    
In the above situation you would be using the  [ Amiga Starts ]  option
because you just finished your turn and the Amiga will be rolling the 
dice next.    


    [ Random Moves ]
    
To make sure that your tests are consistent, you should eliminate the
random opening moves by turning off the above  Option.    


    TEST
    TEST=1000
    
This tool type turns off the majority of the graphics, sets the speed at
15 and automatically starts playing against itself.  This greatly 
increases the number of games/hour that the Amiga can complete.  The 
more games played, the more meaningful your results will be.  My A1200
with a 28mhz 68030 is good for about 1900 games/hour.  My Dell 866 mHz
Pentium III laptop running WinUAE can finish about 40,000 games per hour
and an AMD XP-2400+ will play over 100,000 games per hour.

You can use the TEST tool type to play an infinite number of games or 
you can use it with a condition like TEST=1000 to play exactly 1000 games.

Remember to make sure that the boards being compared are set up properly
before doing any long term testing.

The stats can be examined at any time during testing and then you can 
continue on by resuming Auto Mode.

After 40,000 games there is a 95% probability that the results will be
accurate to within plus or minus 0.005.  Two equal players should have
winning averages somewhere between 0.495 and 0.505.

Give me access to a supercomputer and I'll give you a better backgammon 
algorithm!

The gammon font started life as the Aberdeen_Oblique font and was then
reworked using the great font editing program, TypeFace by David Kinder.        


Without the contributions from all of the above, this program would not
have reached it's current level.

Special thanks to Toni Wilen and everyone else that has contributed to
the Ultimate Amiga Emulator, WinUAE.  

I am presently using version 0.8.22 Revision 8 which is very stable and
reliable.  I highly recommend it.  You can download a free copy at:

All recent updates to ProGammon were done using SAS/C while working on
my laptop Intel PC.

You will be hard pressed to find a significantly better playing, more 
configurable game of backgammon at any price.

Your questions and comments are always welcome.


Long live the classic AMIGA!
