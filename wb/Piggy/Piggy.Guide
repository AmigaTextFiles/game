Back in the old days, prior to the internet, Bulletin Boards (BBS) were the way
that you communicated with a computer through a phone line.  BBS'S were and
still are fun; and for those that still run them here is to you.

Most BBS's had on line game that the user could play.  One of my favorite on
line games was called Piggy and was originally created by @{b}Basil Barnes@{ub}.  For
some reason I just loved playing this game.  One reason could have been you
could win extra on-line time so it catered to my gambling side.  At any rate the
one BBS that had the game changed BBS software and Piggy was not ported to that
software.

Alas I longed to play Piggy again so since I was just learning Arexx I thought
that this would be a perfect game to make in Arexx.  I tried to recreate
everything that I could remember about the on-line Piggy and put it in the Arexx
version.  I was even able to talk to Basil Barnes in the Arexx Fidonet echo and
got some help from him.  I posted the completed Arexx Piggy game in the Arexx
Fidonet echo and it was discussed for a while and a few improvements were
suggested.  I had planned on putting the Arexx version up on Aminet but never
got around to polishing the script and uploading it.  I came across the script
again and finished off everything and I sent Piggy off to be added to the Aminet
Archives in May of 2001.  Then I got a suggestion to add a few more features.

This version includes some improvements. Such as:

* The ability to have up to five players!
* Each player can be a human or the Amiga.
* The playing order is randomly generated.
* Scores are listed in order at the end of the game.
* Game board lists first player, last player, current high score, and current
  player.

You need an Amiga;
RexxMast should be running;
And the rexxsupport.library which comes with Arexx and should be installed in
the libs directory.

@{b}THE GAME:@{ub}  Piggy is a dice game for 2 to 5 players.  You can play against the
computer, friends, your self, or any combination there of.  The object is
simple, be the one with the most points at the end of the game.  The game is
played to a minimum of 150 points.

@{b}BEGINNING:@{ub}  You can start the game by double clicking the icon or you can start
it from the CLI.  When Piggy starts you are asked if you would like some help,
to quit, or continue.

@{b}PLAYERS:@{ub}  You then are asked how many players you want for this game.  Any
number between and including 2-5 are accepted.  You are then asked for each
players name.  If you leave the line blank then that player will be the Amiga.

@{b}TURNS:@{ub}  Playing order is randomly generated.  Each player gets the same number
of turns.  So the player that starts last will always be the last to roll.  So
if you were the first to roll and you get to 150 or greater the other players
will have one more turn in which to beat you.  Ensure that you have sufficient
points to make it tough on your opponent(s).  However if you were the last in
the playing order and on your turn you reach 150 or more points you will win
simply by ending your turn at that point.  Turns last as long as the player
wants it to and as long as the player does not roll any ones.

@{b}POINTS:@{ub}  Points are gained by adding the roll of the dice to the players current
roll total which is then added to the players accumulated total when the player
successfully completes their turn.

@{b}ONES:@{ub}  To make it a little more interesting; during a players turn if a one is
rolled on EITHER dice then that player loses their turn and all points that were
accumulated during that turn.  But they retain their total accumulated points.
If BOTH dice are one then the player not only loses their turn and all
accumulated points in that turn, but also loses their total accumulated points.
(@{i}If you roll snake eyes you start from scratch@{ui}.)

@{b}STATS:@{ub}  The stats are displayed throughout the game showing who was the first
player, who is the last player, who is the current highest scorer, the current
highest score, who is currently rolling and their total current score.  During
each roll you are showed what was rolled, the total of the roll and what your
total would be if you stop your roll.  At the end of the game you are presented
with a list of the players, their totals, and who the winner is.

Many thanks to Basil Barnes for writing the original and for his help with the
creation of this script.

Many thanks to those that frequented the Amiga Arexx Fidonet echo and for those

And thanks to Pretzel Logic BBS in San Antonio Texas where I first stumbled on
to Piggy.

None really.  I mean it seems to work fine and you can always change it as you
want.  I had thought about adding some improvements such as:

- Have a separate quote file that is read in allowing more quotes to be added
  easier.

- Use the translator.library for the quotes and to speak the score.

- Create a High Score list.
