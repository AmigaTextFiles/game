@node intro  "Introduction to BlockOut"


                                 @{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}


BlockOut is an Amiga conversion of an Amstrad CPC PD game written by Ben
Abbott.  It is a simple platform/puzzle game in which you must simply reach the
exit to progress to the next level.  In order to help you reach the exit you
may push blocks around, down slopes or off the side of walls.  BlockOut is
fully multitasking and plays in a workbench window, it should use very little
cpu time and can adapt itself to different resolutions.  Also the BlockOut
graphics are replaceable if you think mine are too ugly :) four graphic sets
are included by me :

		LowresGfx -	Standard gfx for normal PAL/NTSC Hires
				workbenches (or any with an aproximate 2x1
				pixel aspect). It uses only four colours so
				should look ok on most workbenches (unless you
				have a realy strange palette or use two
				colours :)
		AltLowresGfx -	An alternative 2x1 aspect gfx set. I did this
				because the standard set is so ugly but I think
				these are even uglier ! Anyway the 2x1 are
				destined to be pretty ugly but at least there
				is a choice :) (If anyone creates a nice
				looking set pleeease cantact me :)

		HiresGfx -	This is a MUCH prettier set intended for
				screens with a 1x1 pixel aspect and four
				colours.

		MWBHiresGfx -	For 1x1 screens with the Magic Workbench
				palette (or a similar one) Uses 8 colours.

Also included is a level editor/designer so anyone can create lots of lovely
new, wonderfull levels :)

@node requirements "System Requirements for BlockOut"


                             @{b}@{u}Systen Requirements@{ub}@{uu}


The  system requirements for BlockOut are quite low.  You will need Workbench 2
or  better  and  about  190k  free  memory.  For best use you should have a VGA
monitor or better running in a resolution with approximately 1x1 (square)
pixels such as DBLPAL:Hires No Flicker (640x512 or higher).  On normal PAL/NTSC
monitors using Hires the graphics used are MUCH uglier, to use the nicer
graphics run your workbench in a resolution with a 1x1 aspect such as Hires
Laced or even Lowres (but you will need a larger autoscroll screen to fit the
whole window on :) I have plans to make BlockOut run on it's own screen in the
future and also in any aspect which would mean it can look pretty on any
display :) although really the graphics are not very important to the gameplay
anyway.
You will also need to have the reqtools library installed in your libs.
BlockOut MAY work on KS 1.3 machines using some of the 1.3 compatible
replacement libraries that are around but I'm not sure about this, the
editor will also need a 1.3 compatible gadtools.library clone.

@node install "BlockOut installation"


                           @{b}@{u}BlockOut Installation@{ub}@{uu}


To install BlockOut just drag the draw wherever you want it.

BlockOut requires the reqtools.library to be in your libs: assign. If you
don't have reqtools already there is a copy in the BlockOut archive.

Just in case you want to know here is a list of the files blockout
needs....

BlockOut         - Obviously :) this is the main executable
BlockOut.data    - This is the preferences file and MUST be in the save
directory as BlockOut.
BlockOut.bog     - This is the standard game file. The default setup
requires that this is in the same directory as BlockOut.
LowresGfx        - The standard graphics file for screens with a 2x1 pixel
aspect. The standard setup requires this to be in the same directory if you
run in a 2x1 aspect such as 640x256.
HiresGfx         - Graphics for 1x1 screens (640x512). Must be in the same
directory if you are usind the default setup and using a 1x1 screen.
BlockOut.info    - If you want to run it from workbench.

@node howtoplay "Brief Playing Guide"


                              @{b}@{u}Playing Guide@{ub}@{uu}


BlockOut  is a simple game although the controlls can seem a bit fiddly and
take some getting used to because they try to stay true to the original CPC
version, once you are used to the controlls however you should have no
problems. The default controlls are the cursor keys but this is
configurable from the main menu.

@{u}Playing BlockOut@{uu}
The basic idea of BlockOut is to escape a system of rooms in which you have
become trapped so that you are free and can go back home :) That will do as
fas as a story goes since it's just about all I can remember and it isn't
very important.

There are several things found in a level that you can interact with in
some way:

     Blocks         - Can be pushed about by walking into them.
     Conveyor belts - Carry you or a block along, be carefull you can't
                      jump off until you reach the end!
     Mines          - Don't step on these, they will destroy any blocks
                      dropped on them.
     Teleporters    - This will teleport you to somewhere else on the
                      current level. There may be many teleporters in a
                      level but only one destination.
     Exit           - Get here to complete the level

For a list of all blocks press 4 at the main menu.

@{u}Solution to level 1@{uu}
Here is a quick soultion to the first level of the default game. This level
is not in any way difficult and is only intended as a sort of tutorial.

- Press 1 from the main menu to start the game.

- Press any key to start the level.

- Jump up onto the platform abover the start position and push the block
off the left side.

- Drop down ontop of the block, move to the left of it then push it as far
right as you can.

- Jump on top of the block then up onto the ledge above and walk into the
exit.

That should give you a basic idea of how the game works. The first few
levels are very simple and intended to introduce the basic features of the
game.

@{u}1. Start Game@{uu}

This should be obvious :)


@{u}2. Load New Game File@{uu}

This loads a new .bog game file as created by the game editor.


@{u}3. Load New Gfx File@{uu}

Loads a new graphics file. The default is HiresGfx for 1x1 screens and
LowresGfx for 2x1 screens. If you have a Magic Workbench of simmilar
palette you may want to change this to MWBHiresGfx. This will probably look
better that the standard set on most 8 colour screens but it depends on the
palette. The 4 colour graphics files were drawn with the standard 4
workbench colours in mind so should always look ok.


@{u}4. View Help Screen@{uu}

View all the game blocks of the currently loaded graphics file.


@{u}5. Redefine Keys@{uu}

Just like is says :)


@{u}6. Enter Level Code@{uu}

Allows you to start a game from any level if you know the code for that
particular level.


@{u}7.Quit@{uu}

@node editor "The BlockOut level editor"


                            @{b}@{u}The Level Editor@{ub}@{uu}


The level editor is an easy to use tool intended to allow you to create
your own game files.  Each BlockOut game file contains 32 levels and data
for each levels name and password.  Also you can define a password for the
actual game file which will be needed to load it into the editor.  This
will prevent anyone else loading up your games and looking at all the
levels.  You may also attach an Author name to the game file although this
isn't currently displayed by BlockOut, I recomend that you put you name in
here though because future versions will certainly credit the Author when a
new game is loaded.

I recomend using a utility such as cycle to menu since it makes tile
selection MUCH easier.

When pointing at the main map window the left mouse button pastes down the
current tile while the right mouse button will blank anything under the
mouse pointer.

		@{"  -> Buffer  " link buffer}
		@{"  Buffer ->  " link buffer}


NOTE:  At the moment there is no proper error checking to see if the player
falls off the bottom or jumps off the top of the screen.  If this happens
then BlockOut may crash.  Sorry about this, it should check but doesn't
seem to work :( I will fix it as soon as I can see what I have done wrong.
For now though you MUST ensure that it is impossible for the player to jump
off the top of the screen (A row of walls across the top will work) and
can't fall off the bottom.  If you want the player to fall off the bottom
then put a mine at the bottom of the screen wherever it is possible for
them to fall, this will work the same and means that the level can't crash.
Sorry about this bug, it is the first thing on my fix list.

In order to create a new graphics file you bust first save out a series of
iff brushes using an art package such as DPaint or PPaint.  The exact
dimensions of these brushes can be found by examining the ILBM picture
"Gfx.iff" which is in the main archive.  When You have created all your
brushes (Including and ending picture) run the MakeGFX program and you will
be prompted with a file requester for each brush one at a time.  When all
the brushes are loaded You will be asked for a destination file name and
then a new graphics file will be created.

You can make use of your new graphics file by selecting option 3 from the
BlockOut main menu.

@node bugs "Known bugs and things to do"


                              @{b}@{u}Known Bugs@{ub}@{uu}


Here is a list of bugs that I know about. If you find a bug please contact
me, preferably by email, with any relevent or usefull details that you can
think of.

- Currently jumping off the top of the screen or falling off the bottom
will probably crash the program. I have put checking into the code but it
doesn't seem to work :( This means that the error is most likely just a
stupid mistake (probably a typo) on my part. Anyway it will be fixed soon.

- After closing BlockOut the most preferences programs refuse to change the
worbench screen claiming there is a window open that you must close. I am
not sure exactly what causes this and I have known other programs to cause
the same problem but I suspect it is due to me not tidying up properly
after myself.

- Occasionaly during play the time limit jumps up to about 1700 seconds! I
have not isolated this bug yet so if anyone finds a way to reproduce it
pleease let me know.

- Possibly the biggest problem with BlockOut at the moment is that I
(pretty stupidly) used timings based on the screen refresh. This means that
BlockOut feels completely different when run on screens that refresh at
different rates, in fact it is pretty unplayable in some screen modes :(
BlockOut was developed with DBLPAL screens in mind (Which luckily seem to
be the most popular) but should also be perfectly playable on PAL, NTSC and
DBLNTSC. Other screen modes will probably make BlockOut too awquard to
controll. I will fix this problem as soon as I can.

- There are a few things in the way the main character interacts with the
enviroment (platforms and slopes etc...) that I'm not sure about. If you
find the movement (Especialy up/down slopes in crowded areas) odd or
strange and think it should work differently then email me and tell me how
you think it should work.




                            @{b}@{u}Things to do....@{ub}@{uu}


List of things I would like to do to BlockOut......

- Get it to run on any public screen. This is a priority since BlockOut is
intended to be a fun little thing to pass a few minutes when you are bored
programming, drawing, rendering or whatever you do on your Amiga.

- Make it a commodity. This kinda mixer with the above todo. I would Like
BlockOut to be a tiny commodity that loads up it's data and adapts itself
to the current screen at the touch of a hotkey, allowing you to continue
where you last finished.

- Add a pause function when the window is deactivated. At the moment the
game can't be paused which is a pain if you're formatting disks or
something like that which may cause requesters to pop up occasionaly.

- Adapt to ANY aspect. Currently BlockOut has two aspects either 2x1 or 1x1
pixels, when run BlockOut checks the screen and uses the closest mode which
looks very wrong if you are running a PAL:SuperHires screen :) The option
to create graphics files is the first step to making blockout run on user
definable screen aspects.

- Run on a custom screen. This may be nice if the last todo is done well so
that you could configure BlockOut to run on a full Hires screen with 256
colours, or just run it on it's own screen because it doesn't fit well on
your normal one.

- Add some sound. Probably just a few small sampled bleeps or something.

- Just make it all generally prettier and more configurable and most of all
fun to play :)

- No fee may be charged for distributing BlockOut other than to cover costs
the only exception to this is CD ROM distribution since CD distributions of
PD are such good value as long at the CD is sensibly priced. The Aminet
range of CD ROMS may be used as a guideline for CD ROM pricing.

- I have the right to stop anyone from distributing this program if I feel
they are making money from it and they shouldn't be. If you are in any
doubt then contact me first.

- If you like this game then please send me an email if you can saying what
you think about this game and why.

- Magazines may distribute BlockOut on covermounted disks or CD ROMS but they
must email me first. This way I can make sure you have the latest version
and I will probably buy your issue :)
