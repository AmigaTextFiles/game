This is an implementation of the game "Mastermind" the rules are the same, you must
deduce the combination of images that the computer has randomly picked, every time
you complete filling in a row the computer will inform you whether you have got a
correct peg in the correct place or if you have got the correct peg but in the
wrong place.
The score is calculated by number of tries -1 x time taken.

Correct   peg Correct place   = filled circle.
Correct   peg Incorrect place = Outlined circle.
Incorrect peg Incorrect place = Blank.

The controls are as follows:

Use the left mouse button to select the image you desire by clicking on the
corresponding button at the top of the board, then place the image by clicking
on the desired box.
When the last image is placed in the current row, it will sink and the next row
will rise.
The game options are handled via the menu.

This program will only work on WB 2.0 and above.

This program was written on an Amiga A1200 68882 6MB.

This program was intended to be used with the workbench in 8 colour
mode although it can be used in 4 it won't look as good!

The high score table will be loaded and saved from the directory in which
the game is stored if the file is not there a default table will be used.

The sound can be turned off and on by altering the tool type.

The game window graphics will scale themselves to your screens aspect ratio.

BUGS!!!!!!!
