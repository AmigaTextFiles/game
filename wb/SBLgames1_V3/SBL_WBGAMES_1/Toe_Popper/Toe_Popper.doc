1. Rules

If you have never played Mine Field on a PC (Piece of Crap) then you had
better read the next few lines !
The idea of this game is too locate and mark all the mines which are
randomly placed over the field, you must also uncover all of the ground
which does not contain a mine, you should do this as quickly as possible.
When you uncover a square, the number that is underneath tells you how
many mines there are in the surrounding eight squares, if you uncover a
mine you can have permission to jump 6ft. into the air and distribute
pieces of yourself over a large area.


2. Controls

The controls are as follows:

  p to pause/unpause the game.

  RMB on unmarked covered square = mark square
  RMB on marked   covered square = unmark square
  RMB on uncovered square        = uncover unmarked squares
                                   around square
  LMB on covered square          = uncover square

If you use the RMB to uncover the surrounding squares and you have marked
too few or too many then these will be flashed.

3. Additional Information

This program will only work on WB 2.1 and above.

This program was written on an Amiga A1200 68882 6MB.

This program was intended to be used with the workbench in 8 colour
mode although it can be used in 4 it won't look as good!

The high score table will be loaded and saved from the directory in which
the game is stored if the file is not there a default table will be used.

The first move is always safe!

The difficulty levels were copied from the PC mine field ( easy & normal
have identical square to mine ratios ).

The custom level mine ratio is set at 5:1 although you can enter your own
number of mines.

The sound can be turned off and on by altering the tool type.

The game window graphics will scale themselves to your screens aspect ratio.

A toe popper is a form of land mine that will shatter a soldiers foot
and so cause at least another soldier to be removed from combat to help
the wounded soldier walk back to camp (Two Birds ,One Stone).
