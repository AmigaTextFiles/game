1. Rules

The idea of this game is to keep the water flowing along your pipe for
as long as possible.
You will get 5 points for each piece of pipe laid down.
You will get -10 points for placing a new piece of pipe over an old piece.
You will get -10 points for any piece of pipe that is not flowed through
when your game is finished.


2. Controls

The controls are as follows:

Use the left mouse button to select a piece of pipe from the four available
pieces at the top of the board, then click where you want it to be placed.

If you have got stuck and want to finish quickly select "speed up" from the
menu.
