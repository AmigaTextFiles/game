The idea is to rearrange the pieces on the right hand part of the board onto
the left hand side so that all the adjacent edges match.

This program will only work on WB 2.0 and above.

This program was written on an Amiga A1200 68882 6MB.

This program was intended to be used with the workbench in 8 colour
mode although it can be used in 4 it won't look as good!

The high score table will be loaded and saved from the directory in which
the game is stored if the file is not there a default table will be used.

The sound can be turned off and on by altering the tool type.

The game window graphics will scale themselves to your screens aspect ratio.

BUGS!!!!!!!
None known at present.
