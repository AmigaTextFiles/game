INTRODUCTION
============

SnakeByte is a different type of Workbench snake game, reminiscent of the
classic snake games that you used to get on the PET or the Vic 20.

Our snake finds itself living in an enclosed garden, which is inhabited by
a collection of rather tasty beetles - beetles which are extremely easy for
the snake to catch because they just sit in one place and never try to move
around. However, the garden also contains a number of mushrooms, which are
deadly poisonous to the snake...



REQUIREMENTS
============

The game should work on any Amiga fitted with Kickstart 2.0 or better.

Hard drive installation is simply a matter of dragging the icon into an
appropriate place on your HD - no extra files or libraries are needed.

You can set the following tooltypes in the icon:

    XPOS    Set the x-position of the window on Workbench.

    YPOS    Set the y-position of the window on Workbench.



PLAYING THE GAME
================

Just double-click the icon, and the SnakeByte window will appear.

Use the cursor keys to control the snake - like with all snake games, once
the snake has started moving it will automatically carry on moving in that
same direction until you either change direction or pause the game.

You can pause the game at any time by simply pressing any other key on the
keyboard, and it will also automatically pause itself if the window is ever
de-activated for any reason. To restart, just press one of the cursor keys
to start the snake moving again.

The object of the game is to eat all the black beetles, while avoiding the
deadly blue mushrooms - but each time you eat one of the beetles, the snake
will grow slightly longer. If you succeed in eating all the beetles, then
more beetles & mushrooms will appear - with the snake remaining exactly the
same length as before...

It looks easy at first, but after a couple of levels you'll find that it
quickly starts to get very tricky avoiding your own tail at the same time
as trying to reach the remaining beetles - the game ends when you either
bite into your tail, or eat one of the deadly mushrooms.

You can prematurely end the game by selecting "Game/End" from the menu. To
start a new game, select "Game/New" (there are keyboard short-cuts for both
of these, too).

Good scores are over 100 points, and excellent scores are over 150...
