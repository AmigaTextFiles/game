CWP -- A crossword puzzle time-waster  by Mike Epting, Cupertino, CA.

I can't imagine that you really need any documentation to use this 
program with the puzzles provided, but it is possible that you could 
have trouble getting started.  There are four possible ways to 
successfully run CWP:

1.  Click on a puzzle file icon, hold down the shift key, and double click 
    on the CWP icon.  The selected puzzle will appear.
    
2.  Double click on a puzzle icon.  This approach works if the icon's tool 
    type is CWP, as with the puzzles provided.
    
3.  Double click the CWP icon and choose a puzzle file by using the ARP 
    file requestor.  This method is available to you only if you have 
    arp.library installed in your LIBS: directory.  If this makes no sense,
    forget it or get ARP somewhere.

4.  From the CLI, use "CWP filename".  You don't need to type the ".cwp" 
    part of the filename.  Note that if you omit the filename and have 
    arp.library, the arp file requestor will appear.

You'll note that small puzzles open up on the Workbench screen, but larger
ones get a custom interlaced screen.  I'm sorry about the crummy colors on
the latter -- I don't have a flicker-fixer and these colors are tolerable
on my Amiga.

Once you have a puzzle, just type your guesses.  You can move the cursor 
around by using the keyboard cursor controls or by pointing and clicking.
You can get a single letter hint or check your solution at any time by
using the menu or keyboard substitutes (right-Amiga-H or -C).  If you wish
to save a partial solution, use the menu or right-Amiga S.  Later, you can
bring up the blank puzzle and use Restore to get back to where you left 
off.

I wrote the program (it's my first C project -- I hope you can't tell), but
the puzzles are from here and there.  As the author, I guess I have the 
right to make the program public domain, so use it any way you please.  

You can enter your own puzzles using any text editor, but I'm real picky 
about format.  Take a look at any of the provided puzzle files to see how 
yours needs to look.

The first line is the height and width of the puzzle, in squares, separated
by a comma (e.g. 13, 13).  

The next lines are the puzzle solution.  You can use either upper or lower 
case letters, but be careful about spaces.  To make this thing square you 
probably need spaces at the ends of some lines.

After the solution, you need a line that says only:  Across:

Next are the coordinates and text of the across clues.  First enter the 
horizontal and vertical coordinates; for example, the upper left hand 
square is 1,1.  The fifth square from the left, four down is 5,4.
The clue itself may include any text you wish, but must fit on one line. 
The total line must look like:
x,y,Here is the across clue for square x,y.

After all the across clues you need a line with just:  Down:
Then enter the down clues in the same format as the across clues.

After you enter a puzzle file, you need to carefully debug it by running 
CWP, positioning the cursor on each square, and checking that the proper 
across and down clues are displayed.  Check especially for blank clues, 
because they suggest that you made a mistake on the coordinates.  I admit
that I have not thoroughly tested CWP with every kind of possible error
in puzzle files, so you might meet the Guru if you are careless with
your puzzle entry.

Note that if you want to use method 2, above, you need to either copy my
puzzle icon for your file or edit your icon's tool type.

When you have a few good legal puzzles, I'd appreciate it if you make them 
available to the rest of us.  If you upload them to Genie, the Mission 
(415-967-2021), or BBS-JC (415-961-7250), I will get them, consolidate them
and pass them along.  

The same three places are also good ways to let me know about bugs.  This
stuff has been tested only on my A1000 so far, so there might be some.
