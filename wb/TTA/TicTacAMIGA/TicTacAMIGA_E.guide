TTA is a little @{"game" link "game" 0} for workbench. I tried to make it fontsensitive and I
think it is (thanx Jan).  TTA was written in  Assembler (sometimes a tricky
job...) and that means it is very short and fast. I hope this.

TTA is @{"Freeware" link "freeware" 0}.

Freeware is a part of Public-Domain-Software, that is freely distributable,
but still copyright by the author.  That means, you can copy TicTacAMIGA as
long as you  want, but you MUST NOT change  it anyway. I want to please you
to keep  this guide and the @{"game" link "game" 0}  together if you copy TTA.  So the others
will know, @{"how to play" link "how2play" 0} TTA. Thanx !

@node "how2play" "How to play TTA"
Once  uppon a day, in a  boooooring lesson at  school, my friend Ronny (hey
Ronny, hope you have fun these days...) tought me a simple and  funny game.
Now, an eternity later, I wrote this game on my AMIGA: TicTacAMIGA.

Maybe you know how  to play it, but if not, read this: all you need are two
players (or  one - the other is your machine),  one does play the cross and
the other the circle.  Both try to build a row of their symbols alternate -
horizontal  or  vertical or diagonal.  The problem ?  The problem  is, your
opponent  tries to  block up  your  rows.  All clear ?  Not ?  Then  select
AMIGA-AMIGA in Mode-@{"Menu" link "usage" 0} and start the game. You will see, how to play...

@node "install" "Install TTA"
@{b}FIRST WAY (simple)@{ub}
Use the Installer-Script, so TTA will be installed completely.

@{b}SECOND WAY (by your own)@{ub}
#?:                         TicTacAMIGA (.info)
LIBS:                       locale.library
LOCALE:catalogs/deutsch/    TicTacAMIGA.catalog
ENVARC:                     TicTacAMIGA.config

@{b}INDICATION:@{ub} TTA does not need any extern file to run, but you loose a lot of
comfort if you do so (e.g. localized layout).
@endnode

@node "usage" "How to use TTA"
The menus are easy to use:

@{b}Project@{ub}
   About:  opens a simple about-window
   Quit:   you will leave the game (or press the CloseGadget)

@{b}Game@{ub}
   Mode    Player-Player: Two player can play.
	   AMIGA-Player:  Player against AMIGA. AMIGA will start.
	   Player-AMIGA:  Player against AMIGA. Player will start.
	   AMIGA-AMIGA:   AMIGA fights itselfs. Use this for demo !
   Start   This will start the game in selected mode.
   Stop    Stops a started match.
   New     The started game will be stopped and restarted.


@{b}NOTES@{ub}
To set a field click on it or use the number-block (1..9) at the right side
of the keyboard.

Use  the SizeGadget  to size the window.  This is useful if  you use a high
resolution and a small font. Thanks Oliver Reiff for this suggestion.

Pressing the [S] key at anytime TTA will save game window`s actual position
and dimension to file  "ENVARC:TicTacAMIGA.config".  Next TTA will consider
these datas.   If these position/dimension are wrong, TTA will  use default
data and  open a  fontsensitive window.   The result of save-action will be
shown in window`s titlebar. Save-failure can be caused by:
     (1) The file was opened and not closed (there is a lock)
     (2) Disk is full. This is nearly impossible, but this can be appear.

If you want TTA a new language, translate TicTacAMIGA.CT into this language
and "compile" it with maybe  MakeCat by PALADIN SOFTWARE.  If you created a
new catalog I want to please you to send this catalog to me so I can put it
into the TTA-package and release it.

When mode AMIGA-AMIGA is on use the Space-Bar to step on.  So it schould be
easier to find out how to play.

@node "history" "Revision history"

      v1.0  - never really written (only tests, GUI-games and ideas...)
      v1.1  - First full  working version.  I tried to  remove all  bugs of
	      beta-testing.
      v1.2  - Bug appears but I can`t find it. Using Numberblock to set the
	      fields.
      v1.3  - Bug removed.  Painting winner-row  in a different color, code
	      optimised.
      v1.3a - New Startup-Code. More code optimised.
      v1.4  - Now using SizeGadget. Terrible MemLeak-Bug removed. TTA works
	      now  good with memory-allocation/-freeing  (Thanks to Jan van
	      den Baard for saying this  and thanks  to Devitt for the tool
	      MemLeak)
      v1.4a - Press  the [S] key  to save game window`s actual position and
	      dimension. Next TTA will consider these datas.
      v1.5  - Using now locale.library, that means, you can learn TTA a new
	      language. Menus got the OS3-NewLook.
      v1.5a - Way of AMIGA`s thinking is now a little bit better.
      v1.5b - Big Optimisation-action done and won 2kBytes !
      v1.5c - Horrible Bug removed (thanx "PackMAN" for your AMIGA) - crash
	      on A500/1MB CHIP,1.5MB FAST/1 ext. Floppy/KS37   (LockIBase()
	      causes a guru - impossible, but possible...).
	      More code optimised (Thanx Werner Hilf for your book  "Mikro-
	      prozessoren in 32-Bit-Systemen" -> a great book)
      v1.5d - After  closing the AboutWindow  the GameWindow now appears on
	      old Possition using the old Game-mode; *NOT* reading the file
	      ENVARC:TicTacAMIGA.config again. More code optimised.
      v1.5e - Tried to remove crash on Blizzard (but no chance to test it).
	      Using  WindowLimits()  instead  of  removing  Size- and Zoom-
	      Gadget. New About-Text.
      v1.6  - AMIGA "thinks" much better now...
      v1.6a - Use Space-Bar to step through AMIGA-AMIGA-Mode.
