 ›1m* INTRODUCTION:›0m

LittleSnake is a multitask game as I like to play, when I format disks,
calculate some 3D-pics/anims,... 
The nice language Blitz has been used to program it. It's so nice to
program with it! 
Compiled with Blitz2 version 2.1 . 


 ›1m* SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:›0m

LittleSnake requires KickStart 2.0 or + to run. So just upgrade if you
still have an old ROM in your Amiga...
You MUST have the font : Topaz/11 in FONTS:


 ›1m* RULES :›0m

It is just a remake of an old game that exists on all 8bits machine when
I was young... You just have to control your snake between the numerous
blocks which appear during the game. You musn't also not hurt the walls
(aïe my head!). And you are not allowed to touch yourself (erotic ways
are prohibited).


 ›1m* PLAYING THE GAME :›0m

Before you start, you can modify the size of the window to play in.
Select the difficulty in the menu.
To start, you press SPACE key or select 'New Game' in the menu.
You use the keys <- & -> to control the head of your snake. You can also
use your joystick if you prefer...
The frequency of the apparition of the blocks is fonction of the size
of the window.
When you are 'Game-Over', if you make a high-score, you will be prompted
to enter your name :  ›4mYou must press 'ENTER' when done!!! ›0m
If you play LittleSnake and a soft is eating all the CPU time in the
background, set a higher task priority to play at full speed.
When you save the preferences, you save : the size and position of the
window, the difficulty level and the task priority.
