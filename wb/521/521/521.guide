                        521 v1.00 (12/08/96)
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

521 was programmed by urchin. it is public  domain  and  may  be  freely
distributed. 521 may be placed on compilation/cover disks (yeah right!),
but i'd like to know in advance...

   @{" introduction          " link "intro"} - what is 521??
   @{" system requirements   " link "sys_req"} - which awesome amiga do i need?
   @{" ok, so how do i play? " link "the_game"} - it's not that hard :)

   @{" info & credits        " link "info"} - helps & hinderances...
   @{" game history          " link "history"} - what went wrong before...
   @{" the author            " link "urchin"} - if you really wanted to know...
   @{" registration          " link "giftware"} - GIFTWARE!!!

521 is a workbench/intuition friendly puzzle game that multitasks properly
(no busy-waiting). despite being based on a simple  concept,  and  looking
easy at first, it is deceptively difficult (or it could be that  i'm  just
a bit thick:)

@Node "sys_req" "system requirements"

hopefully, 521 should work on any machine 2.04 and above. although written
on an a1200, it was compiled using  any  processor  options,  and  no  3.1
specific calls were used (i  don't  think).  feedback  on  this  would  be
grateful. (see author bit)

if it doesn't work on 1.3 machines, then tough! you  really  can't  expect 
developers to keep writing  for  older  operating  systems  and  not  take
advantage of nice features in the newer ones. ok, so you're not  a  fickle 
peecee owner who upgrades their machine  every  20  seconds  beacuse  bill
'666' gates tells them to, but hell, you don't know  what  you're  missing
with aga, big fast processors, 32-bit fast ram and cd/hd drives...

@Node "the_game" "so how do i play?....."

on starting the game, you  are  presented  with  the  main  menu.  use  the
proportional gadget to select which level to start on, (start very low  and
then press the start button.

you will then be presented with a 3x3 grid filled with numbers ranging from
1 to 5. clicking on a tile with the left mouse button  will  increment  all
tiles in that tile's row and column.  any  tile  incremented  past  5  will
return to 1. the aim of the game is to fill the grid with 1's.... 

(it is possible to complete the puzzle in the number of moves designated by
the level number... ie. level 6 can be completed in 6  moves,  although  it
can also be completed in a lot more.

thanks to:

 the_don --- for running the amiga section on mono, and generally  knowing
             an awful lot about amigas (and every other computer under the
             sun)... also for playtesting (and completing it on level 24!)
 recoil  --- for being recoil :)
 madbob  --- for being a loony and lying about failing physics....
 nige    --- for being a loony and actually failing physics....
 emma    --- for holding my hand preventing me from typing....
 fran    --- for being a noisy cow....
 imp     --- for his ability to break computers at 50 paces....
 C=      --- for making my favouritest computers - amiga + c64....

@Node "history" "cockups so far...."

v0.01  (07/07/96) - first real working incarnation. wrote the main enginey
                    bit, but output  was  to  console  window  only,  with
                    numerical input for grid selection.

v0.02  (09/07/96) - first intuition version with gui and mouse  selection.
                    not very nice to look at though.

v0.97ß (11/07/96) - first  releasable   version   after   wrestling   with
                    proportional gadgets (not helped by crap  code  in  C=
                    autodocs replying to intuimsgs too late) 

v0.98ß (12/07/96) - weeded out a nasty little bug that prevented the level
                    indicator from going fully  up  to  24  if  the  mouse
                    pointer was moved quickly out of the right side of the
                    window (been annoying me for a while that one)

v0.99ß (19/07/96) - added a well done acknowledgement when each  level  is
                    completed. tidied up the code, and dropped some of the
                    images from 3 bitplanes down to  2  (i  was  too  lazy
                    before) saving blank bitplane space. changed the level
                    display routine  to  stop  the  text  flickering  when
                    moving the prop gadget.

v1.00  (12/08/96) - finally get round to uploading to the aminet.

@Node "urchin" "stuff you didn't really want to know..."

well, i'm (soon to be) a third year physics student at umist,  manchester.

i based 521 on a program listing i saw for the c64, and thought  it  would
make a nice intuition game. little did i realise how difficult it actually
was until i'd finished writing it.

521 has been tested so far on my machine:

 a1200 - viper030(28mhz), 68882(33mhz), 2mb chip, 8mb fast, 270 mb ide hd,
         vertos 2x ide cdrom, quadram multisync (ie. dblpal)

 and so far, it's produced no enforcer hits while testing....

and the_don's:

 a1200 - 020(14 mhz), 68881/2(14mhz), 2mb chip, 4mb fast, lots mb ide hd,
         surf squirrel scsi interface.. + some other bits...

if you want to drop me a line about the game, or just things in general, i
can be contacted on monochrome bbs (message urchin) or  through  email  at 
mccx4ad@fs2.ee.umist.ac.uk
   
previous "efforts":

slider     - just your run of the mill intuition slider puzzle....
sheepbench - i think the less said the better....

work in progress:

workbench friendly endorphun rip off. (nearly finished)
workbench friendly trouble bobble (?) rip off. (nowhere near finished)

@Node "giftware" register today....

this program is GIFTWARE!!.. i hate nasty shareware,  with  bits  crippled
here and there, so if you enjoyed playing 521 you might like  to  consider
sending me a small gift of some sort.

  ideas:

  letters, postcards, cookies, hardware, software, 060's, anything...

registration can be sent via _@'' to.. urchin,
