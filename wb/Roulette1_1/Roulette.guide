 This program is "anythingyoulike-ware".  Feel free to send me stuff such
 as keyfiles for programs you've written, roulette strategies you've
 discovered, e-mail saying "it worked" or "it didn't work", anything, or
 nothing at all.  I (David Jackson) can be contacted at

        dj@coventry.ac.uk (preferred)

 but failing that,

        dj@spuddy.mew.co.uk will do (but only checked every couple of months or so,
                                      unless the above account dies!).

@node Disclaimer "Disclaimer"
@{b}Disclaimer@{ub}

 Use it at you're own risk etc.  And don't come crying to me when a
 "fail-safe" strategy you've worked out using this program fails for real
 down at the casino!  But do come to me when it works out by all means.
@endnode

@node Requirements "Requirements"
@{b}Requirements@{ub}

 Minimum requirements are OS3.x, some RAM, some sort of processor too
 probably.  Yep, a 68000, so it should work on older amigas with upgraded
 ROMs or soft-kicked O/Ss.
@endnode


@node Roulette "Roulette"
@{b}Roulette@{ub}

 But it's all random isn't it?
 Yep, it sure is.

 This game is a representation of the "Single Zero" variation of roulette, and
 gives a greater chance of success against "American Roulette" which has both a
 Zero and a Double Zero.

 The rules are based on the roulette rules at my local casino, the Rainbow Casino
 in Edgbaston, Birmingham (England!) where I am a member.

@node Suggested "Suggested usage"
@{b}Suggested usage@{ub}

 Play whilst rendering, compiling, uploading, downloading, mod-playing,
 revising or all on it's own.

 You could use it to test gambling strategies (hah!), using the four
 "players" to test alternative strategies simultaneously, in the comfort
 and relative safety of your own, or indeed somebody else's home.

 Use it to make money off your friends and family.
@endnode

@node How "How to play"
@{b}How to play@{ub}

 Start off by buying some chips.  Each chip is worth 25p, 20 chips = £5.
 Chips are bought by clicking on BUY, and this gives you £5 worth of
 chips.

 Moving the mouse around the table area shows you the odds for each
 position.  Directly below that is the number of chips for each player,
 with the right column of numbers representing the amount of chips placed
 for any given position.

 Now place some bets using the left mouse button to add a bet, and the
 right mouse button to remove a bet.

 Minimum bet on any 2-1 bet or lower is four chips, £1.  This means any
 bet not placed on the main numbers section, i.e. Red/Black or 2nd 12 or
 the centre column etc.  All other bets can be as little as one chip, 25p.
 The placing of correct bets is handled automatically by the game.

 Click on CLEAR to rake back all your chips currently on the table.

 INFO lets you know how much you're winning or losing, taking into account
 the amount you have on the table as well as the amount in your virtual
 hand.  The first line shows how many chips you have in stock @{b}+@{ub} how many
 you have on the table. 

 Pressing SPIN produces a random number (unfortunately) between 0 and 36,
 and chips are given or taken according to the outcome.  Winnings are
 added to your total and placed bets are left on the table for you to
 collect, or you may let them "ride".

 Pressing EXP. shows the @{"Expected Value" link Expected} of the current player's bets. 


@{b}Special case, green zero@{ub}

 Should green zero come up, evens bets are only half lost.  So if you
 have four chips on red, and green zero appears, two chips are returned to
 you.  This occurs for all evens bets in this circumstance, i.e. red,
 black, odd, even, 1-18 and 19-36.
@endnode

@node Expected "Expected Value"
@{b}Expected Value@{ub}
 The @{i}Expected Value@{ui} of a bet is a measure of what can be expected to be
 gained (or lost) on average, in the long run.

 The first value is the expected return of your bet, per spin, if you
 were to leave that same bet on for an infinite numbers of spins.  E.g.
 A single chip left on a number would expect to make -£0.006756p per spin,
 or -0.6756 pence per spin in the long run.  The value directly beneath
 this value is the expected return per chip.

 Using this feature you can see that all bets will lose @{i}in the long run@{ui},
 because of the (small) mismatch in returns versus actual odds, i.e. you
 win a 36-1 bet and only get 35-1 odds.  In fact the best bet possible on
 the roulette table has an expected value of 0p (meaning neither winning
 nor losing) and is simply not to play!  However, the next best odds come
 from any evens bets, as these make an expected return of -0.3378p per
 chip per spin. This is because you get to keep half your stake if Green
 Zero comes up, but it's still not fair!

 The average loss is even greater on roulette wheels having both a zero and
 a double-zero (American Roulette).
@endnode

@node Systems "Betting systems"
@{b}Betting systems@{ub}

 After reading the section on expected value, you'll know that any system
 that tries to win based on the mathematics of the "long run" will fail,
 as the moment you put a bet on it loses some of it's face value.

 The only system to use or invent therefore is one based on voodoo and/or
 mystisism!  Perhaps based on the previous number or numbers, or the
 position where the croupier releases the ball at the start of a spin.

 Neither of these will work on a computerised version such as this of
 course!

 Unless you know different...
@endnode

@node ToolTypes "ToolTypes"
@{b}ToolTypes@{ub}

 You can set the colours of various things through the ToolTypes, but bear
 in mind that they are simply matched to the closest colour on the screen
 used:

    COLOUR1
                          Set the colour of player 1's chips (in C style 24-bit hex)
    COLOUR2
                                    "              2's               "
    COLOUR3
                                    "              3's               "
    COLOUR4
                                    "              4's               "
    RED
                          Set the colour for red numbers on the cloth
    BLACK
                          Set the colour for black numbers on the cloth
    GREEN
                          Set the colour of the cloth
    SHADOW
                          Set the colour of the shadow (can make numbers stand out)

 You can change which screen to run the game on:

    PUBSCREEN
                          Name of the public screen on which to open the display.

 @{b}Note:@{ub} The icons for Roulette and the AmigaGuide file are NewIcons, so you
 won't be able to see them if you  aren't running the NewIcons program.
 The gobbledegook in the tooltypes after "DON'T EDIT THE FOLLOWING LINES" is
 where the NewIcons images are stored (you can't see those lines when running
 NewIcons).
@endnode

@node ScreenMode "ScreenMode"
@{b}ScreenMode@{ub}

 This game was developed with a 1:1 (or near enough) pixel aspect ratio
 screen in mind, such as MULTISCAN:Productivity, so it'll probably look
 bad on a screen with a different ratio, such as a PAL:High Res style
 screen for instance, or it may not work on such a screen at all.  Ways
 around this are:

    Use a higher resolution screen, which means the dreaded interlace mode
    on systems without a VGA or a Multiscan monitor.  Using this method
    retains the 1:1 pixel aspect ratio.

    Use a smaller Screen Text font, so that the window's drag-bar is
    shorter, although the screen may still be too short.

    Use an autoscrolling screen with a larger height than it's default,
    large enough to accomodate the game's window.

                  Removed extraneous debugging statements.
                  Drew some icons!  (Using the indispensable NewIcons system)
                  Changed info to show chips not on table + chips on table.
