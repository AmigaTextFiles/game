THE GAME
========

SuperWorm II is a classical worm-style game with gradual steering,
without 90° turns. The idea is to eat the small squares. You'll 
get points for each square you get, and if you do it quickly you'll 
get even more points. After eating each of them, you'll grow longer.
If you hit the walls or yourself, it's game over man.

THE 2 PLAYER MODE
=================

In the 2 player mode the player who dies first, loses
the match, and the other player wins. For winning a match you
get one point. You can reset the counter by pressing the key '2'
in the title screen again. The counter is also reseted after one
of the players gets 5 points.

SPECIAL SQUARES
===============
There are also two kinds of special squares (changing their color):
1) Shrinkers [|] : make the worm shorter, and
2) Doublers  [+] : turn on the 2x mode. In this mode all the
   squares change their color and give double the normal score. Hurry
   up, the 2x mode only lasts a short time.

INSTALLATION
============

Just unpack the archive where you want, and that's it.
Highscores and settings will be saved in that directory.
Double-click on the icon. If the window isn't square formed
(it's flat in either direction) make it square with the
function keys:

    F1  -  Double horizontally
    F2  -  Double vertically
    F3  -  Halve horizizontally
    F4  -  Halve vertically


CONTROLS
========

While playing:

<- and ->   Turn the worm left and right
Arrow up    Double speed (use with care)
Z and C     Turn player 2
X           Double speed player 2
P           Pause mode
+ and -     Change the number of different colored worm sections
            (decrease them if the game is too slow with your Amiga)

Player 1 can also use joystick to control the worm.

In the title screen:

D           Toggle detail level (high/low)
M           Toggle music (normal(+fx)/off/continuous)
HELP        Show keyboard control help
DEL         Show highscores
1 and 2     Select number of players, reset the counter in 2 player mode
RETURN      Start a new game

and other Amiga software as well.
