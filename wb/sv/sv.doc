Otherwise Topaz 8 will be used.

It's the german version, but I will explain the important words:

schummeln (In the Projekt-menu): You can see were the computer has set his
                                 ships.

Bugs: The computer is not able to keep hits on more than two different ships
      in mind. So if you have set your ships with more than two touching 
      eatch other, the computer may get confused. (May, not will) I was 
      too lazy to correct this because you should not let your ships touch 
      unless you want to make the computers life easy. And who wants this. 
      
If you want to contact me, to send bugreports or to send the correct
translation so I can make a english version, use:
