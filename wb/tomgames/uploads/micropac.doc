    Micropac

This little game was written in Lattice C 5.04 on an Amiga 1000 with 2.5
megs of memory under Workbench 1.3.

The men are sprites, as you could probably tell.  The good guy is sprite 1,
and I change his color, so your pointer will change color too.  Sorry about
that.

Micropac runs on the Workbench screen.

To play, click the Micropac icon, or type "micropac" from the CLI.  When
the game window appears, control your man with the arrow keys.  Move him
around the maze to avoid the bad guys and eat up all the dots in the maze. 
When all dots are eaten, the maze will be reset, and the bad guys will come
out sooner.  The game is over when you die three times.


I made this game because I wanted a compiler-time game; that is, a game that

1. runs on the workbench screen
2. uses little memory or processor speed
3. is very polite, multi-tasking-wise
4. is at once fun and mindless

and I think Micropac fills the bill nicely.


This program was created by me, Thom Robertson.  I take no responsibility
whatsoever for damage done to anyones computer or disks or data that occurs
through use of this program.  I have satisfied myself that it works fine on
the system I developed it on, and I believe it will work equally well on all
other Amiga computer systems.  Liability-wise, though, you are on your own.

I give anyone the right to use and copy this program, Micropac, for
non-commercial purposes only.  Just keep the .info and .doc files with it.
However, this program is shareware.  The price is a letter, from you to me,
telling me how you like it, how you use it, what could make it better, etc.

If you have any problems, comments, or questions, please feel free to
contact me by U.S. snail.
