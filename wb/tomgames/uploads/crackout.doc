    CRACKOUT

    by Thom Robertson

    8/2/90


This little game was written in Lattice C 3.10 on an Amiga 1000 with 2.5
megs of memory under Workbench 1.2 and subsequently upgraded with Lattice C
5.04 in Workbench 1.3.  It takes up just over 19K on disk and
uses 24k fast RAM and 15K chip RAM when running.  It also uses around 15
percent of your processor time (unless its window is in-active, in which
case it uses next to none).

The ball is sprite 2, and the blocks are RectFills.  I used to use sprite
7, but for some reason, my Amiga 1000 cannot properly display sprite 7.  I
am convinced this is a hardware breakdown.

Crackout runs on the Workbench screen.

I made this game because I wanted a compiler-time game; that is, a game that

1. runs on the workbench screen
2. uses little memory or processor speed
3. is very polite, multi-tasking-wise
4. is at once fun and mindless

and I think Crackout fills the bill nicely.

There are 10 levels, which should keep nearly everyone busy for a while.

When you run Crackout, you will notice that the pointer disappears.  This
only means that it is invisible; you can still use it to select different
windows.  When you select another window, Crackout will freeze and your
pointer will re-appear.  Crackout will stay frozen (in a state that uses
minimal processor time) until you click on its window again.

All seriousness aside, though;

This program was created by me, Thom Robertson.  I take no responsibility
whatsoever for damage done to anyones computer or disks or data that occurs
through use of this program.  I have satisfied myself that it works fine on
the system I developed it on, and I believe it will work equally well on all
other Amiga computer systems.  Liability-wise, though, you are on your own.

I give anyone the right to use and copy this program, Crackout, for
non-commercial purposes only.  Just keep the .info and .doc files with it.
However, this program is shareware.  The price is a letter, from you to me,
telling me how you like it, how you use it, what could make it better, etc.

If you have any problems, comments, or questions, please feel free to
contact me by U.S. snail.
