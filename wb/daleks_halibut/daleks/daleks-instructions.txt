DALEKS Amiga ... By John Girvin

INSTRUCTIONS

You are The Doctor (who?), and you
are trapped on the Dalek planet. Your
only hope of escape is to destroy
all the Daleks on each level.

This genocide is made possible by
the Daleks total stupidity. You kill
them by crashing them into each
other, since they are too stupid to
stop themselves !

Daleks exist only to kill you,
and will move directly towards
your current position - use this
fact to direct them into each
other and the wrecks of ex-daleks.

INSTRUCTIONS

You have two weapons (apart from
terminally thick enemies): your teleport
and famous Sonic Screwdriver. Use them
to get out of otherwise bogus situations.

The teleport instantly moves you to
another place on the surface. But it
is only an experimental model, and
occaisionally puts you right beside
one of the metal muthas. It also becomes
more unreliable with continuous use...

The screwdriver destroys any dalek
immediately next to you when it is used.

The teleport may be used any number of
times, but the screwdriver may be used
only once per level.

INSTRUCTIONS

If you are in an unassailable position
at the end of a level, you may use the
LAST STAND gadget. Once this is selected
you may take no further action for the
remainder of the level. But you get a
major bonus, so its not all bad !

Bonuses are also given for NOT using
the screwdriver, killing LOTS of daleks
QUICKLY and generally excellent play
(NOT littering the surface with loads
of Dalek wreckage, using the teleport
as LITTLE AS POSSIBLE, using laststand
with LOTS of SPREAD OUT Daleks etc.)

The high score table can be saved (if
you like) to SYS:daleks.hiscore

The Doctor, or these keys...

Other gadgets can be selected by

Don't feel like you have to, but if you
like Daleks enough then throw a few shiny
pennies my way. No obligation, but it
would be nice to know there are a few
caring souls out there in userland :-)
