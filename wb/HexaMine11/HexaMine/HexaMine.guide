                           @{b}1.2 Game Principles
                          =====================@{ub}


  @{b}HexaMine@{ub} is a hexagonal clone of the  wellknown game 'MineSweeper'. You
  have to find a given number of hidden mines and mark them with a little
  flag in the shortest possible time.  If you uncover a field with a mine,
  the game is over.

  The numbers in the uncovered  fields represents  the number of mines in
  the six fields around. With help of these numbers you should be able to
  uncover the right fields.  The first move in  every game is @{b}always@{ub} save,
  that means there'll @{b}never@{ub} be a mine under the first uncovered field!

  If you like  this game in the  unusual  hexagonal grid, you  should try
  @{b}Hexagons@{ub}, which you can find e.g. on @{b}AMINET@{ub}  in  @{b}game/wb/hexagons22.lha@{ub}.
  It's a very nice hexagonal clone of Tetris.

                                button down.  So you don't have to  finish a  perhaps 
                                wrong move.

                                immediately  after pushing  down a mousebutton.  This

                                result in some mistakes if you're a rookie.

                             ================@{ub}

   There are six different highscoretables. One table for the small, medium
   and big playfield with a few or many mines each.

   The table entries are sorted by game time (shortest at the top) and date
   (oldest dates at the top).

   You can load, save, delete and merge your  highscoretables with these of
   your friends. These functions appear in an own menu which will be active
   if the highscore-window is active.

                    @{b}HexaMine@{ub} supports the following tooltypes:

  @{b}ENDREQUEST@{ub}     -  If this  tooltype  is active,  there appears a  safety-
                    requester when leaving the game.

  @{b}NAME=Name@{ub}      -  This name will be used  as default name for all entries
                    in the highscoretable.

  @{b}MAINWINDOW=x,y@{ub} -  Coordinates of the left upper window corner. By default
                    the window is centered above the actual screen.

  @{b}NOCTMKILL@{ub}      -  @{b}CycleToMenu@{ub} will not be removed automatically.

  @{b}NOCTMREQUEST@{ub}   -  There will  be no  warning, if  @{b}CycleToMenu@{ub}  has  to be 
                    removed.

                          @{b}2. System Requirements
                         ========================@{ub}


   You can run @{b}HexaMine@{ub} on any Amiga with Kickstart >=2.04 and 512kB ChipRAM.

   You need a screenmode  with at least 400 lines  and a minimum of 4 colors. 
   A 68020 processor with  at least 14MHz is strictly  recommended. You  can
   use a  68000 processor, but the  game  might be  unplayable  with the big
   playfield.

        @{b}HexaMine@{ub} was tested with the following system configurations:

            A4000/040, AGA, Kick 3.1,  2/18MB
            A4000/040, AGA, Kick 3.0,  2/24MB
            A2000,     ECS, Kick 3.1,  1/12MB, GVP Combo-30 (030/882)
            A2000,     ECS, Kick 3.1,  2/ 8MB, A2630/882
            A2000,     ECS, Kick 2.04, 1/10MB, A2630/882
            A500+,     ECS, Kick 2.04, 1/ 0MB


   @{b}@{u}Limitations:
@{uu}
   HexaMine@{ub} doesn't work together with @{b}CycleToMenu@{ub} by Federico Giannici. This
   results  in a  system crash  after  leaving  @{b}HexaMine@{ub}.  That's @{u} no @{uu} bug in 
   @{b}HexaMine@{ub}, but a wrong handling of the generic-gadgets by @{b}CycleToMenu@{ub}.

   In this Version of @{b}HexaMine@{ub}, @{b}CycleToMenu@{ub} will be removed automatically, so 
   there  shouldn't be any  further  problems left.  Look at @{" Tooltypes " link tooltypes}  for 
   details.
