   @{b}Introduction to BSnake@{ub}


   Well, once upon a time there was this game
   called "ESnake" by Erik Johannessen.
   It was very, very simple in gfx and sound
   (it didn´t even have sound).
   But I used to play it very often and so
   I started thinking `bout coding a similar
   game in Blitz2.
   It was my first bigger project in Blitz2.
   That´s why it took me much longer to
   finish the game than I had ever thought.

   But here it is ***  @{b}BSnake@{ub}  ***.

   It´s fully OS 3.1 compatible, uses inter-
   laced or hires screens (640x512), utilizes
   the joystick if wanted, saves hiscores and
   plays some music and sfx.
   Another positive effect is the adjustable
   speed of the game (Novice to Crack).

   I hope you´ll like this game and play it
   very often. It´s optimal for inbetween.

   Bye-bye for now...

   @{b}Playin´ BSnake@{ub}


   @{u}Starting a game@{uu}

   Pressing `Return´ or the `New Game´ gadget will
   start a new game even if one is still running.
   Pressing `RAmiga N´ or selecting `New Game´ from
   the `Project´ menu will only start a new game
   if none is running.
   You can pause a running game by hitting the
   `Playin´´ cycle-gadget or clicking with
   your mouse pointer outside the BSnake window.
   Continuing a paused game can be done by clicking
   at the `Paused´ cycle-gadget, hitting `RAmiga P´
   or selecting `Paused´ from the `Project´ menu.
   Before starting a new game you can choose what
   skill-level you wanna play from the `Project´ menu.
   There are 4 types available:
   · Trabant (stands for a tiny German car) - slowest,
   · Käfer   (=Beetle)                      - a bit faster,
   · Audi    (luxury car)                   - even faster,
   · Porsche (no comment)                   - fastest.
   Every level got its own hiscore-list.


   @{u}Controlling your snake@{uu}

   It´s quite simple. Just use the 4 cursor keys
   to direct your snake. But you can of course use
   the joystick, too. All you have to do is marking
   `Joystyx´ in the `Options´ menu.
   `Return´ or the joy-button start a new game even
   if one is still running.


   @{u}Scoring points@{uu}

   You start with a length of 20 units.
   From time to time there appears and disappears
   food for your snake. Collecting the food by
   going over it will enlarge the snake by ten
   times the units that are shown on the food.
   Example: food says 4 then value will be 40.
   Your goal is to eat as much food as possible,
   not running in your own snake or the playground
   border and to achieve a new hiscore.
   After doing so you´ll be asked for your name
   to be put in the hiscores.
   Making any mistake will lead to a nice death
   sequence (you´ll definitly see it !!!).


   @{u}The gadgets@{uu}

   · About    - some info `bout the author and your computer,
   · Hiscore  - shows the top ten players for each skill-level,
   · Paused/
      Playin´ - indicates the current status of the game,
   · New Game - starts a new game if none is running,
   · Quit     - opens a Pentium 200 MHz emulator or something
                like that...
                actually this gadget will end the game and save
                the hiscores and other game-related datas.


   @{u}The menu / hotkeys@{uu}

   The `Project´ menu:
   · Paused   / RAmiga P  )
   · New Game / RAmiga N  )
   · Trabant  / RAmiga 1  ) -=> `Starting a new game´

   · About    / RAmiga ?  ) -=> `The gadgets´
   · Quit     / RAmiga Q  )

   The `Options´ menu:
   · Sound    / RAmiga S  - some annoying sfx will appear here
                            and there,
   · Music    / RAmiga M  - there will be music loops while no
                            game is running,
   · Joystyx  / RAmiga J  -=> `Controlling your snake´.

   If you can´t even use Multiview
   then it might be better for you
   not to play this game.
   I must say this because in the
   game you have to press several
   keys to achieve your goal!

   Practise a bit with Multiview
   and then we talk `bout playin´
   my game.
