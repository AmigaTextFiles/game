                               1/17/1993


  Here is the fifth edition of WBGames. It includes:
                             
                             WBTetris       1.5
                             WBColumns      1.4
                             WBMineSweeper  1.4
                             WB15           1.2
                             WBBoxMan       1.2

  Now, let me answer to most commonly asked question: What is the
difference between these and previous versions? 
  
  1. There was a terrible bug in all previous WBGames. It can be
     seen in the old MineSweeper: after you try to resize its
     window, Intuition will update its Close/Zoom/Resize/TopBottom
     gadgets every time you use any menu (even if it is the menu
     of different program). Doesn't look dangerous, does it?
     Nevertheless, this thing is capable of causing gurus and
     screwing up the system.
  2. WBColumns was starting with the same piece every time you ran
     it. Now it selects the random piece.
  3. I'm terribly sorry for the random number generator I use.
     The rand() function in my C compiler is extremely bad; it
     causes all those strange mines layouts in MineSweeper and it
     also doesn't mix the pieces in the WB15 enough. In the new
     versions I have improved it a little, but don't expect good
     randomization.        
  4. WBTetris and WBColumns are FASTER now! Yes, level 5 became too
     fast for me and I went to the level 4!
  5. ONE BIG IMPROVEMENT:
     WBGames are still WB-Games, but now they can be played on ANY
     public screen. You can also change window coordinates, levels
     and field sizes on startup. Read the rest of the manual for 
     instructions!
  6. Another, quite obvious improvement: I have a tradition to add a
     new game to each edition. This time it is BoxMan - the Soucoban
     (a.k.a. Boxxle) clone. Unfortunately, there are only 7 levels 
     ready. If you need more - feel free to modify Levels.Dat file.
     Just don't forget to send your masterpiece to me, I also like
     to play this game!
     
     
     
  I. Copyright
  
  You can use the games as long as you want and don't make any profit
from it. If you feel obliged (which is unlikely) or want MOST RECENT
VERSIONS of WBGames, you have to send me $15 US. I also can send the
SOURCES and CISTOMIZED VERSIONS (just write me what you want to be
changed). If you aren't interested in getting the newest versions of
WBGames - use those you have for free, I don't mind, but I change the
package and add new games every 2-3 weeks. C source codes of these
games alone are worth those $15.

                      great games!  




  II. Instructions
  
  All games have common interface. So, you can stop the game (Game|Stop
menu option), start it (Game|Start option), begin a new game (Project|
New option), and, obviously, quit the game (Project|Quit). There is also
level selection (Game|Level) and "About" option (Project|About).

  ToolTypes:
  SCREEN=<PubScreenName> - the name of public screen you want to
                           play the game on
  LEVEL=<1-5>            - the level number

  LEVEL=<1-5>            - the level number
  X=<XCoordinate>        - the coordinates of the left-upper 
  Y=<YCoordinate>          corner of the window
  
  5. WBBoxMan
  
  Start:
  From CLI: BoxMan <FileName> [ToolTypes] where the file
            FileName contains the levels you want to play at.
  From WB:  Use BoxMan as a tool for a file containing the
            levels. As example, I included a couple of these
            files.

  Keys:  
  [LEFT ARROW]  - move the arrow to the left
  [RIGHT ARROW] - move the arrow to the right
  [UP ARROW]    - move the arrow up
  [DOWN ARROW]  - move the arrow down

  The goal is to put all small boxes on their places. Remember
  that you can push only one box! This game needs a name of the
  file containing the levels. Otherwise, it will try to open the
  file called "BoxMan.Dat". You can change the levels and create
  new ones editing data files. Their format is self explanatory:
  just type "more Levels.Dat" to see those 7 levels I made, and
  you will get it!     

  ToolTypes:
  SCREEN=<PubScreenName> - the name of public screen you want to
                           play the game on
  LEVEL=<1-25>           - the level number
  X=<XCoordinate>        - the coordinates of the left-upper 
  Y=<YCoordinate>          corner of the window 

  All games were written for HIRES NON-INTERLACED SCREEN, so all pictures
have X:Y ratio 2:1. Because of this, games won't be looking so nice on the
different type of screen (interlaced, for example), but you can use the 
screen with the ratio near to 640:200. For example 800:250 would be OK.
Of course, if you use 640:200 screen for your WorkBench, you won't have
this problem at all.
  WBColumns also needs not less than 8 colors to work. In fact, its icon
is done in 8 colors. Other games work with standard 4 colors.
