@{fg shine}@{b}     AmiPet Version 1.14@{ub}@{fg text}

@{b}Introduction@{ub}

AmiPet is just a small program which provides a 'pet' type thing on your
workbench.  You know the type of thing I mean.  There seems to be a number
of these popping up which are just straight emulations of the keyring pets.
This isn't a clone of these keyring pets and should be compared with them :)

I have so far tried 3 of these other programs, all are strange.  All seem
to run as a program in themselves and not a background process therefore
eating up my processor time.  So I decided to continue with the project and
complete it.

I began writing this thing when the original keyrings first appeared.  I
got a picture in a window which didn't do a thing and then forgot about it.
Then 3 weeks ago I took another look at it and rewrote it.
Since then I have modified it quite a lot since the first version.

@Node "REQUIREMENTS" "Requirements"

When you run it for the first time a file is created: "S:Pet.cfg"
This file holds information about the current pet.  It is updated every
time AmiPet is executed and exited.

In order for Amipet to work properly in needs you to have a hardware clock
( Most people have a clock don't they? if not, what are you playing at?)
AmiPet 'remembers' the time it was 'born' and the last time it was
started/closed down so leaving it for a few days will kill it off!

Amipet runs from Workbench and no extra libraries are needed (from disk
that is)
You will need OS 37 or above and once running the pet requires about 100k of
memory. 

Amipet requires you to have set the path for the @{"graphics" link "GFX"}
in the icon's tooltypes and also the sound file if required.

@Endnode

@Node "OPTIONS" "Options"

There are some options available which are configured from the icon's
tooltypes :-

@{b}GFX=string@{ub}
Must always be set to the current GFX file to be used.
e.g.
      GFX=Work:Project/Pet/PetGFX/fishgfx.raw

@{b}FRONT=YES@{ub}
Pops the AmiPet window to the front every 5 seconds.

@{b}MODE=BIG@{ub}
Replaces the previous menu item 'mode'. MODE=BIG sets the double size mode.

@{b}SFX=string@{ub}
Specifies the path and file to use for the sounds.  This sound file must
be one generated by the accompanying AmiPetSound program.
e.g.
      SFX=Work:Projects/Pet/Pet.SFX

This is optional and leaving it out wont play any sounds.

@Node "USAGE" "Usage"

All you have to do is look after your pet and make sure conditions don't
become bad enough for it to die. Feed and clean your pet and make sure it
doesn't get too sad or ill.

If you are running on a large screen size you can change the double size
tool type. Amipet will now be twice as big so you can see it better.

If you haven't looked after your pet and it has died you can start again by
selecting New pet (duh!).

You can also create and use different graphics sets. See @{"GFX" link "GFX"}
section.
@ENdnode

@NODE "SOUND" "Sound FX"

If the sound file is specified in AmiPets icon's tooltype it will be loaded
up when AmiPet is started.  This file will be stored in FastRAM if it is
available.
The sound file should be created using AmiPetSound which should be in this
archive.
AmiPetSound uses RAW samples at the moment.
To create your sound file run AmiPetSound and select the pet states which
will have sound.  States can if desired be left without sound.
Select the sound file and set the playback frequency.  Play sample will
erm play the sample at the specified frequency.
When you have done this for all the pet states you want to have sound
select make sound file (or whatever I have called it). Select the
destination file to create.  Each sample you have chosen will be loaded
and then placed into the new sound file.

AmiPet will open the audio.device before any sound is played.  If it cant
be opened, no sound is played.
audio.device will be closed after the sound.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "GFX" "GFX"

In this archive you will find PetGFXConv and grid.pic
Grid.pic is the template for the graphics and you can change these using a
GFX program such as PPaint. Once you have changed the GFX use PetGFXConv to 
convert the graphics into a graphics file for AmiPet to use.

PetGFXConv is not very sparkly since it was knocked up in Amos in very
little time.  Anyway it does the job.  Just answer the questions it asks
you (Just file names and directories 'n' stuff)

This is what makes AmiPet unique (so far). You can design your own pet.
You can attatch a message (30 chars) to your GFX which will be displayed
when stats is selected.

You can upload your graphics to Aminet in game/wb/ so others can use them.
