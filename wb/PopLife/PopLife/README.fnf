This material was submitted to me on disk directly by the author, Olaf
Seibert, for inclusion in the library.  

	o	To activate click on WorkBench icon and then press
		Left-Amiga-Key & F6.

	o	To deactivate, press Left-Amiga-Key & F6 again.  To
		deinstall, click on WorkBench icon a second time.

Note:  I was never able to get PopLife to behave exactly as advertized,
but it looked interesting enough to include anyway.
