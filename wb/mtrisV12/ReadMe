Short: WB game V1.2, tetris clone, Kick 1.3

Mtris is another version of tetris. There was a bug in V1.0 with messages
handling, which caused the program to takes a pice of memory each time you
pressed a key. It is now removed.

New in this version:

- Removed bug with memory handling
- You can switch off display of Next piece. (This will bring you more
points)
- If the program can't change score file, it will prompt you only the first
time with the requester, and if you select CANCEL, you'll disable saving
for all the time (until you restart the program).
- Some cosmetic changes have been made

This program is freeware. But, if you like it, you can send me a nice
postcard. Any suggestions, bugs, etc. send to address:
