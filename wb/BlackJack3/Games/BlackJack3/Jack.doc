                               * Upgrades * 
    Version 3.0:
        1. Added 24 bit color.
        2. Added keyboard controls.
    3. Modified windows to size themselves automatically.
        4. Converted assembler routines to back to c, because I don't know
           and won't learn assembler and because computers are fast enough
           today. :p
        5. Added additional ToolTypes: BETMIN, BETMAX, BETCURR, DECKLOC
            CARDWIDTH, CARDHEIGHT, LOANAMT, TABLEWIDTH.

    Note: Version 3 has the abililty to use alternate decks to play with. To
            accomplish this, several things are required. First, each card must be
            individually stored, using the raw (RGB) format. Each card must be
            numbered from c00 to c51, representing each suit in this order (D,C,H,S) 
            and ordered from Ace to King. Each card must be the exact same size. 
            An image for the back of each card is also required and must be named
            "c52". A file called "CardSize" is not required but is recommended.
            It must contain two variables in the following fscanf format: "%d, %d", 
            where the first is the card width and the second is the height. If this file 
            is not provided, the tooltypes CARDWIDTH and CARDHEIGHT must be 
            used.
    
    Version 2.1:
        1. Some of the code was re-written in assembler and is now much
           faster - especially shuffling.
        2. Win percentages are now printed.
        3. Tool-types are now used that let you set the default number
           of decks, size of your bank, and whether the statistics
           window will open.
        4. Note to v1.7 users the HIT, STICK, and SRNDR gadgets have
           been rearranged.
    
    Version 1.7:
        1. You can now Double Down on any hand.
        2. You can now Surrender on any hand.
        3. Aces are automatically calculated for you.
        4. A tie is now considered a Push.
        5. You now win with Black Jack (ooops :)
        6. 5-Card-Under is no longer allowed.
 
                               * Bug Fixes * 
    Version 1.7 failed to properly calculate the size of the window's
    title bar. It also was not very font-sensitive.
    Version 1.7 would lock-up if you did not use a decimal point in
    your wager: entering 10 instead of 10.00 would cause this.

    Version 1.0 contained a fatal bug that no body (hopefully) ever  found:
    the program tried to access an Intuition Message AFTER replying to  it!
    It don't do that no more.
    Version 1.0 miscalculated the stats, but not any more.
    Version 1.0 mis-shuffled when eight decks were used.


                               How to Play 

                               Object of the Game
    The goal is to score more points than your opponent, the Dealer;  with-
    out scoring score more that 21 points. Points are gained by summing the
    values of cards which you are dealt. To make things more interesting, a
    wager is placed on each hand.

                                  Terminology
        Hit           - to ask for another card
        Stand         - to take no more cards
        Bust          - to go over 21 points
        Blackjack     - an Ace and a 10-Card
        Hole Card     - the Dealers second card
        Card Counting - a method of memorizing cards that have been dealt
        Split        \

        Insurance     - Protection against Black Jack.


                               Getting Started
    Using the tool-types:
    None of these tool-types are required, as they all have default
    values. They can be used from CLI and they must be capitalized.

    COUNT
        This switch will force the Count window to open automatically.

    NODELAY
        After a card is dealt the program pauses ever-so-slightly and  this
        lets you see the cards as they are being dealt.  If  you  want  the
        game to move faster, use the NODELAY switch and the cards  will  be
        dealt as quickly as possible.

    BANK=<n>
        This will set your bankroll to <n> dollars. Valid range is 0.10
        through 1.701412E+38.
        Default = 100.00.

    DECKS=<n>
        This will determine the number of decks to be used. You may, at any
        point in the game, change the number of decks to use.
        Valid values for <n> are: 1, 2, 4, 8.
        Default = 1.

    BETMAX=<n>
        This sets the maximum allowable bet in the game. Default = 500.

    BETMIN=<n>
        This sets the minimum allowable bet in the game. Default = 2.

    BETCURR=<n>
        This sets the current  bet in the game. Default = 2.

    DECKLOC="Directory" 
        This points to the directory that contains the cards to be used.

    CARDWIDTH=<n>
        This defines the width of each card and the back image. Must 
        be greater than zero.

    CARDHEIGHT=<n>
        This defines the height of each card and the back image. Must 
        be greater than zero.

    LOANAMT=<n>
        This defines the amount of money the game will loan you should
        you go bust. But this will never hapen, right? Must be positve.

    TABLEWIDTH=<n>
        This sets the width of the playing table in cards. I.e. the pixel 
        width will be equal to this number times the pixel width of each
        card. If the resulting pixel width is less than 380, this will be 
        calculated automatically to ensure that the window is wide
        enough for all the windows gadgets.


                                Playing a Hand

    When you're all set to play, click  the Deal gadget, or press the space
    bar to start a new hand. Four cards  are then dealt: two to you and two 
    to the Dealer. Also, the Deal and  Wager gadgets are turned off and the
    Hit and Stick  gadgets are turned  on. An  amount equal to  your Bet is
    removed from your Bank.  After that, if  your Bank is half  as large as
    your Bet the Srndr gadget is turned on. Also, if your bank is as large
    as your bet, the DD gadget is turned on.

                                 Taking a Hit
    If the sum of your first two cards is less than 21 you have  have  many
    options. One is to take a Hit: click the  Hit gadget or hit H. You will 
    be dealt another card  and your score will  be  re-calculated.  You may 
    continue to Hit until your score is greater than or equal to 21.

                                   Standing
    If you are happy  with your hand click  the Stand gadget or  press S to
    notify the dealer that you do not want  any more cards. The dealer will
    then  take his turn.

                          Special Bet #1: Double Down
    After the initial deal (when you have only two cards) and if your  Bank
    is greater than or equal to your Bet you have the  option  of  Doubling
    Down. To Double Down click the DD gadget or press D. You will be  dealt
    only ONE more card and your turn will end. Also, your bet is DOUBLED.

                           Special Bet #2: Surrender
    After the initial deal and if your Bank is greater  than  or  equal  to
    half of your Bet, you have the option  of  Surrendering.  To  surrender
    click the SRNDR gadget  or press S.  You will be refunded  half of your 
    original bet, your hand will be removed and you will be dealt two fresh
    cards. Last, a sum equal to your original bet is removed from your Bank
    and your turn continues normaly. Essentially, for the cost of half your
    original Bet you get to throw out your  first two cards and get two new
    ones.

                             Special Bet #3: Split
    If your first two cards are equal (i.e. 2 Jacks,  2  nines,  etc.)  you
    will be offered the option to Split. A requester will appear and if you
    want to Split click  Yes, else click No. If you  choose to split one of 
    your cards will  be put aside temporarily  and you will  be dealt a new
    card. Play the hand as normal. When you have finished the  first  hand,
    those cards are discarded and the  card  that  was  put  aside  earlier
    returns. You are dealt another card. Play the second  hand  as  normal.
    You bet seperately on each hand and each hand  is  scored  individually
    against the Dealer's. Thus, if  your  original  bet  was  $10.00,  your
    second bet will be $10.00 also. Let's assume you score 20 on the  first
    hand and 23 on the second and the Dealer scored 19. You  will  win  the
    first hand and collect $20.00 but will lose the second  hand  and  lose
    $10.00. Note: you cannot Surrender on a Split.

                          Special Bet #4: Insurance
    If the Dealer's first card is an Ace you will be offered the option  of
    an Insurance bet. A requester will appear and if you want to place  the
    Insurance bet click  Yes, else click No. If you  want the  Insurance an 
    amount equal to  half of your original  bet will be  removed  from  the
    Bank. If the Dealer's  hole card is a 10-card he  will have a Blackjack
    and you will lose your original bet  (unless you also have a Blackjack,
    in which case you Push). However, you will win the  Insurance  bet.  On
    the other hand, if the Dealer's second card is not a 10-card  you  lose
    the Insurance bet and play resumes as normal.


                                  Scoring

    The point values for the cards are:
            Cards 2 thru 9 - their value is equal to their number.
                             i.e. a nine-of-spades has a value of nine.
            '10-cards'     - 10's, Jacks, Queens and Kings all have a
                             value of ten points.
            Aces           - can be either one point or eleven points.
    Note: suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades) have  no  bearing  on
    the score.

                                     Aces
    When you are dealt an Ace the computer automatically determines whether
    the Ace will have a value of one or eleven.  Let's  assume  your  first
    card is an Ace. The computer will score it  as  eleven.  Then  you  are
    dealt a four. The computer will score your hand as 15 (11 + 4). This is
    known as a 'Soft Hand' because it has a hard value of  15  and  a  soft
    value of 5 (1 + 4). Let's say you to take a hit and are  dealt  a nine.
    The computer will re-calculate your score as  14  (1 + 4 + 9).  If  the
    computer wasn't very smart and calculated the score as 24  (11 + 4 + 9)
    you would have tapped. That's no good!

                                    Blackjack
    Black Jack happens when you have two cards and one of them  is  an  Ace
    and one of them is a 10-card (10, Jack, Queen or King).


                                Winning and Losing

    After your turn ends the computer goes. When he is finished the  winner
    is determined. You WIN if:
            1. Your score is 21-or-less and greater than the Dealer's.
            2. Your score is 21-or-less and the Dealer busts.
            3. You have a Blackjack and the Dealer doesn't.
    You LOSE if:
            1. Your score is 21-or-less while the Dealer's score is
               greater than your score but not busted.
            2. Your score is greater than 21 (busted).
            3. The Dealer has Blackjack and you don't.
    You PUSH if:
            1. Your score is equal to the Dealer's score.
            2. You and the Dealer both have Blackjack.


                                 Wager Payoffs

                                 Standard: 1-1
                                Blackjack: 3-2
                                Insurance: 2-1

    Whenever you win or push you automatically get your bet  back.  If  you
    win you get your bet plus an amount equal to your bet. If you win  with
    Blackjack, you  get your bet plus an amount equal to  one  and  a  half
    times your bet. If you collect an Insurance bet, you get your insurance
    bet plus two times your insurance bet. For instance, if you bet  $10.00
    and win, you collect  $20.00. If bet $10.00 and  you win with Blackjack
    you  collect $25.00. If you have a bet of $10.00 and an  Insurance  bet
    of $5.00 and the Dealer has  Black  Jack  you  collect  $15.00  on  the
    Insurance, but lose your $10.00 bet (you break even).


                                 Strategy

    * The Dealer must follow these rules:
        1. He must Hit when he has 16 points or less.
        2. He must Stand when he has 17 points or more.
        3. He must Stand on a 'Soft-17' (an Ace and a 6 - 9).

    * Keep in mind that the odds of you or the  Dealer  getting  a  10-card
      are better than getting a low card. In each deck there are only  four
      of each low card (four 2's, four 3's, four  4's  ...  four  9's)  but
      there are sixteen 10-cards. So, given a fresh deck, the odds of  get-
      ting a low card are 4/52 = 7.7%, but the odds of  getting  a  10-card
      are 16/52 = 30.8%. Of course these odds change  as  cards  are  dealt
      from the deck. Thus, if the Dealer has a 7, 8 or  9  showing,  it  is
      usually safe to ASSUME his hole card is a 10-card. So, if  your  hand
      is less than the Dealer's up-card plus ten, you should probably  take
      a Hit.
      For those of you who might find this logic a bit convoluted, think of
      it this way: there are 13 cards per suit and 4 suits per deck.  Thus,
      given a fresh deck the odds of getting any given card are 4  /  52  =
      7.7%. However, the odds of that card being a 10 card are  4  /  13  =
      30.8% because 4 of the 13 cards in each suit are 10-cards (10,  Jack,
      Queen and King).

    * To get a better grasp  on  these  odds,  open  the  Count  window  by
     selecting the Game->Count menu-item. This window prints out info about
     how the cards are being dealt. (Though, currently this info is  a  bit
     limited.)

    * Use the Surrender option cautiously! Only use it when  you  are  sure
     that the Dealer has a great hand that you can't beat.

    * Many pro's think that Insurance  bets  are  'bad'  bets.  You  should
     decide for yourself.

    * The best time to Double Down is when you have a  10  or  11  showing.
      This is because the odds are, if you take one more card, it will be a
      10-card.


Well, I hope you enjoy the game. As always, if you find any bugs, or can
