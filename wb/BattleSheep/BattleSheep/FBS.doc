************************
*      Overview        *
************************

What you have here is your classic 'search and destroy' type game. It's
 you against your Amiga in a battle to the Death! Sort of...
 The object of the game is to find (I prefer 'destroy') all of the
 computer's wolves. While you're busy doing that, the computer is looking
 for ('hunting down in cold blood') all of your sheep.

************************
*     How to play      *
************************
Step 1: Turn on your computer ;)
 Then, load the game (the 'Sheep!' file) via WorkBench or CLI. When you
 do this a window opens on the default public screen. Inside this window
 are two grids: the top grid is yours and the bottom grid is the computer's.
 To start a game click the gadget labeled 'Set Up' and the computer's
 grid will be replaced by a set of gadgets that you use to position your
 sheep.

About sheep and wolves...
 You have five sheep and the computer has five wolves. The largest animals
 occupy six adjacent blocks on the grid and the smallest uses two:
         Sheep            Wolf              Size (in blocks)
         -----            ----              ----------------
         Big Daddy        Mr. Big            Six
         Mathilda         Sheba              Five
         Lamikins         Wolfy              Four
         Lil' Sis         Mutt               Three
         Baaa-by          Puppy              Two

Positioning your sheep...
 Initially, your sheep will be located in the upper-left-hand corner of
 your grid. One sheep, 'Big Daddy', will be highlighted in color 2 (on the
 standard 2.0 WB screen color 0 is grey, color 1 is black, color 2 is
 white, and color 3 is blue). Below your grid are four gadgets labeled
 'Up', 'Down', 'Left' and 'Right'. Use the gadgets to move the highlighted
 sheep in one of the four directions. There is also a 'Turn' gadget that
 allows you to rotate a sheep 90 degrees. Select which sheep the position
 gadget affects by selecting the gadget on the right with that sheep's
 name in it. 
 If your as lazy as me you'll most likely and up using the 'Rand' gadget
 which lets the computer place your sheep for you (don't worry, after the
 computer places your sheep it 'forgets' where they are!). You can use any
 of these gadgets as often as you like and in any order. Note: Sheep cannot
 sit on top off on another!! If you try to move one sheep over another,
 the game won't let you.
 Once you have the sheep in the places you want them, click the 'Okay'
 gadget to start the game.

You go first...
 Once you click the okay gadget, the computer's grid returns. The computer
 will decide where he wants his wolves automatically (of course you won't
 see them!). You will still see your sheep in the upper grid, but that's
 only for your benefit: the computer has no idea where they are!
 To start playing click on any square in the lower grid - remember, you
 are trying to find the wolves and they are hiding in the lower grid. If
 the square you choose does not have a wolf hiding under it, it will
 dissappear. If there is a wolf there, it will turn white (color 2).
 After you take your turn, the computer automatically goes - you will
 see the result in the upper grid.

Go for the throat...
 If you find a wolf (i.e. get a white square) on your next turn continue
 to search in that area. You will probably see a pattern develop as wolves
 (and sheep) can only sit horizontally or vertically. Once you've figured
 out the pattern continue searching in that direction until either you
 miss or you uncover the whole wolf. If you miss, reverse direction but
 keep in mind that wolves (and sheep) can sit adjacent to one another -
 so you might be attacking two or more wolves at once! Once you've
 uncovered the whole wolf, the computer will let you know (the wolf will
 will turn black). That wolf is the considered dead and you can continue
 searching elsewhere.

Game over, man...
 The game ends when either you've found all the wolves or the computer
 has found all your sheep. To play another game click the 'Set Up' gadget
 and re-position your sheep (or just click the 'Okay' gadget to leave
 then where they are).

********************
*      Sound       *
********************

The game uses some pretty silly sounds. If you don't like them you can
 turn them off by selecting the Game->Sound->Off menu. To turn them
 back on select Game->Sound->On.
 Or, if you really don't like them you can replace them with your own
 sounds. To do this get/create an 8SVX sample and copy it to the same
 directory that the 'Sheep!' file is in. Then rename or delete the sound
 file that you want to change (see below) and rename your sample to what
 the original was named. Here are the original sample names:
            Name           Effect
            ----           ------
            sound01        A hit on a sheep or wolf
            sound02        A player miss
            sound03        A computer miss
            sound04        A wolf has died
            sound05        A sheep has died

 Example: if you want the game to play a sample called 'Arghhh' when a
 sheep dies do this:
     1) Make sure 'Arghhh' is an 8VSX sound sample.
     2) Rename 'sound05' or delete it.
     3) Copy 'Arghhh' to the drawer that 'Sheep!' is in.
     3) Rename 'Arghhh' 'sound05'.
 NOTE: Keep the samples short!! If they are too long they will slow the
 down.


*************************
*   What's so fuzzy?    *
*************************

Just so you know, the 'Fuzzy' in 'Fuzzy Battle Sheep' does not refer to
 wool! It actually refers to the fact that this program was written using
 the basic precepts of Fuzzy Set Theory - or, Fuzzy Logic. You've most
 likely heard the term but now you meet it face to face. I DO NOT claim
 to be an expert in the field (I've only read one book!) but I have to
 say that I had originally written this program using standard logic -
 probability and it just didn't work and was really long! Then I re-wrote
 the main algorithm using a few IF...THEN directives (vis a vis Fuzzy Sets)
 and voila! the code worked great! I replaced a hundred lines of code
 with about ten IF...THENs and the computer no longer crashed or got
 confused! Best of all I rewrote a months worth of coding in one night.
 Thanks Zadeh!

Enjoy the game!
