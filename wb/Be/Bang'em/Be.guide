    @{i}Why this game?@{ui}

 I am (was?) currently writing a car game but since I got stuck and haven't
been able to figure out the problem for two weeks now which is why I decided
to take my mind of it for a while. So I wrote this game, it is nice to play
while downloading, in case of extreme boredom or just while just generally
waiting for something.

       @{i}How to play:@{ui}

 I take it you have all seen those machines at the amusement parks where you
have to hit the up-popping figures with a rubber hammer as fast as you can.
This is what you might call a computer version of it :-)

 You have a certain amount of time to @{b}@{i}hit as many faces@{ub}@{ui} (or circles if you've
selected it in the settings-menu) @{b}@{i}as you can@{ub}@{ui}. Depending of how many faces you
hit when the time is up you get a score; if it is higher than the current
highscore it will be saved when you exit the game. If you want to alter the
amount of time feel free to do so. However, giving yourself more time doesn't
necessary make it easier to get a higher score; the score is relative to the
amount of time..

 Easy eh? Yup. But please keep in mind that this a BETA-release!

    @{i}What will be included in the next version?@{ui}

 This is only a beta-release of the game. A full release; v1.0 will be
released within a short time. It will contain several faces popping up at the same
time, disappering faces, more graphics to choose from, a hammer mousepointer,
gore and non-gore version, resizeable board and maybe some sounds too.

 Please feel free to @{b}@{i}send me sounds@{ub}@{ui} or graphics that you think would fit in
the game!

@node "about" " About me"

  This program was written by Gustav "Gosweede" Gnosspelius 1997-1998.
 I (Gustav Gnosspelius) take no responsibility for any damage Bang'em may
cause you or your computer. (It won't hopefully).

 You may contact me by email at @{b}gosweede@lindesign.se@{ub}. Please send me all kind
of suggestions concerning Bang'em and of course also criticism. If you
discover a bug; PLEASE TELL ME!

 Finally, I'd like to excuse for messy layout of the guide, layout isn't my
greatest talent. 


 Thanks to everyone on the Blitz-list!
 
 
  Bang'em was made in Blitz Basic 2.1 in 1998.
