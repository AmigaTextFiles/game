     Introduction

     The  setting of Gladiator is personal combat in an ancient Rome arena.
     In addition, some science fantasy elements will be recognized (such as
     magic,  Elves, and Dwarves).  Medieval weapons such as swords are used
     to  destroy  the  enemy.  The level of detail is high such as choosing
     which  character  attacks with what weapon.  Enemies start at opposing
     ends   of   the  arena  and  combat  continues  until  only  one  side
     remains.   Experience  is attributed to the survivors and the defeated
     lose  any experience.  Experience allows a successful player character
     to  become more strong, more agile, and able to withstand more damage.
     Gladiator  is a simulation of a boardgame or war game.  A war game can
     work  well  using simple text graphics and does not require animation.
     Gladiator  allows  each  character a turn one at a time while everyone
     else  waits.   Therefore  gladiator  is  not  a  "real  time" hand-eye
     coordination   game  but  a  turn-by-turn  strategy  game.   Simulated
     six-sided  dice  contribute  the random factor needed to determine the
     outcome  of  events  (just like a boardgame, but automated).  Here are
     some  estimates  on  the  time  involved for learning and excelling at
     Gladiator.

       Game time for a learning game:  5-20 minutes
       To learn the game:              play 10 games (and read the manual)
       To excel at the game:           play 100 games or more
       Games to make a "super hero":   about 250 games
       Game time for an advanced game: about 1-3 hours

     A  "super  hero" is a player character that has achieved an experience
     level  that  gives  him  or  her  the ability to use the most powerful
     weapons, armor, and spells.  Since the game is balanced automatically,
     playing a game with a "super hero" requires killing many more monsters
     (or  more advanced monsters) and extends the time required to finish a
     game.

     This  user's  manual  is  intended to be used solely for the Gladiator
     game  and  may  not  be  modified.   Permission  is  given  to copy or
     distribute  hard  copies  of  the  user's  manual  (use  the  original

     large (40+ pages). 








                                                                     PAGE 3

     Player Characters

     Attributes

     Player  characters  are made up of what they carry (armor and weapons)
     their  race  (such  as  Human,  Elf,  Dwarf,  Orc,  or Mage) and their
     attributes.   The  attributes SH and AG are adjustable when creating a
     character  to  achieve  a certain mix of weapons carrying ability (SH)
     versus  accuracy  (AG)  for  a particular strategy (such as the "human
     tank" character who has high AG to offset massive amounts of armor, or
     the  "Hulk" character who has high SH to carry the biggest weapons and
     is too clumsy for armor).

     SH = Strength / Health

          SH determines which weapons can be  carried.  Higher SH allows
          the heavier and deadlier weapons to be used.   Enemy damage is
          accrued directly to SH. When SH is zero, the character dies.

     AG = Agility

          AG  determines   what the  basic  odds are   for  successfully
          damaging an opponent.  The  higher the AG the  better.  The AG
          number must be  equaled or less on three   dice in the  normal
          instance for a successful attack.

     IQ = Intelligence Quotient

          This  is   the last   of  three  "skill"   attributes.   Skill
          attributes  can change  as the character gains skill in combat
          whereas movement speed  and  armor are constant  regardless of
          experience.  IQ is  only applicable  in combat that deals with
          magic.  IQ  determines what  spells   a Mage  can    use   and
          determines how easily a  character can "see through" a magical
          illusion.

     MP = Movement Points

          Maximum number of squares moved per  turn.  Armor and possibly
          race have an effect on MP (usually 10 squares).

     AR = Armor

          The number of points subtracted from each incoming hit  before
          applying damage to SH.  Armor typically consists of a  suit of
          armor  and  possibly a  shield.   Some creatures  have natural
          armor  that  is always   applied  in  addition to  worn armor.
          Shields  are only  effective on the  side they  are  on.  If a
          shield is ready it applies to frontal armor, if it is slung it
          applies to  rear armor.  AR  6/4 means the  player has a front
          armor that absorbs 6 damage  points and  a side and rear armor
          that absorbs 4 damage points.

     Weapons Table Legend

     SH :           Minimum Strength/Health to carry or   use a  weapon.
                    The Goblin race SH  is  4 points higher in  strength
                    than health.  The Goblin ability to carry weapons is
                    4 points greater than their recorded SH value.   The
                    displayed   Goblin  SH  reflects  their  ability  to
                    receive wounds.

     Pole Arm :     If the item is  allowed pole arm bonuses.  Pole arms
                    get double damage when giving or receiving a charge.
                    Receiving a charge also gives a +2 "to hit" bonus to
                    the charging player.  To give  a charge the  charger
                    must have  moved 2 or  more   squares.  To receive a
                    charge the receiver must have moved 1 square or less
                    and his opponent must have moved  2 or more squares.
                    Pole  arms that cannot be thrown are denoted  with a
                    "P!"  and  are especially long.   These  weapons can
                    attack the square behind the direct front square  if
                    an enemy is not in the direct front.  See Strategy.

     Slash :        Large  bladed weapons  such as  axes  and swords are
                    allowed a special type of attack called a "slashing"
                    attack.  This  attack targets everyone  in the front
                    squares of  the attacker  in clockwise   order.  The
                    first target  is -2 to hit and following targets are
                    -4 to hit.

     Bow :          If the item is a long range  weapon.  Some bows have
                    to be reloaded.  "B1" takes a turn  to reload.  "B2"
                    takes two turns to reload.  Elves get a  +1 bonus to
                    hit and damage with bow weapons.

     Throw :        If the  weapon can be thrown.  Elves  get a +1 bonus
                    to hit and damage with thrown weapons. Dwarves get a
                    +1 bonus to hit  and  damage for thrown hammers  and
                    axes.

     Hammer/Axe :   If the weapon is a hammer or axe.   Dwarves get a +1
                    bonus to hit and damage with hammers and axes.

     2H :           A two-handed weapon.   A secondary  weapon or shield
                    may not be held when this weapon is being used.

     No Shield :    This  weapon is not affected  by  an enemy's shield.
                    Damage against a foe caused  by  a morning star  for
                    example  will not be  reduced  by  the foe's shield.
                    The morning star has a chain which carries a  spiked
                    ball over and around a shield to  hit  the  opponent
                    directly.   The scorpion sting and flail weapon also
                    work this way. 




                                                                     PAGE 6

     Damage :       The number of dice and modifier that will be accrued
                    to the   target if a  successful   hit is  achieved.
                    After the target's  armor is applied  the  remaining
                    damage  is applied   to the target's  strength.  The
                    damage taken by a shield hitting  a foe with leather
                    armor is   determined   by rolling   one   die   and
                    subtracting 4 points (1d -  2 for the shield  damage
                    and  -2  for the leather  armor).   Thus the  attack
                    would do from 0 to 2 points of damage. 

     (*)  Caltrops become a form of  terrain  when dropped.  These are
          four spike  anti-personnel  obstacles  about the size  of  a
          softball.  A single "Caltrops" weapon is actually made up of
          two or more of the devilish devices.  See Terrain. 

     As wounds are accrued  to a character's SH  his AG is  affected but
     his weapons carrying ability remains the  same.  When your strength
     is reduced  it reflects ill health (not weakness) and does not mean
     you will have to drop your current weapon. 

     Weapon Capacity

     Each  character  can  carry four items which may be any combination of
     weapons  and  shields.   If  a  two  handed weapon is readied then the
     second  hand  will drop or sling (if possible) whatever was secondary.
     In  other words, if you wish to start the game with a bow ready (a two
     handed  weapon)  then  you will only be able to bring a total of three
     weapons into the game. 

     Armor

     Each  player  character  may  wear  one  suit of armor.  Armor absorbs
     incoming  weapon damage so it does not hurt the character.  The amount
     of  damage  absorbed  is  determined  by the type of armor worn.  Some
     blows  are too great for armor to completely absorb and some damage is
     applied  to  the character.  Armor reduces the wearer's agility due to
     the  armor's  bulk  and  weight.   Suits  of heavy armor are a dubious
     proposition  usually  left  to  those  who  have accumulated mounds of
     experience  (and therefore have lots of AG).  Start out with a suit of
     plate  and  you  will  be  spending a lot of time swinging at air.  In
     addition, armor limits your movement.

     MP :  This is  the base movement  points  for  a human  wearing the
     armor.  A "-" is a "no effect."   Race can enhance or  reduce MP in
     addition to armor.

     Min SH : The minimum SH needed to use or wear.

     AG Modifier : Applied to  the wearer's AG this  penalty effects all
     agility tasks including  action  turn order.   Shield AG  penalties
     only apply if the shield is "ready."

     Damage Taken  :  Amount  subtracted from   incoming  damage  before
     applied to the character's SH.  Shield damage  taken applies to the
     side the shield is worn  on.  A shield may be  in front  (ready) or
     in back (slung). 

     Facing

     For  the  purposes  of  explaining  the  character positioning in this
     manual,   characters  are  shown  here  as  a  letter  and  a  pointer
     (indicating  their  facing,  instead  of a graphic representation that
     points  in  the  appropriate direction as in the game).  The letter is
     the first letter of the player character's name (a "C" is used for the
     character  "Conan").   The  pointer denotes which way the character is
     facing:

     The  player  is marked with a "C" and is facing towards the East.  The
     squares  marked with "f" are front squares.  The player can engage and
     attack  opponents  in  the  front squares.  The squares marked "s" are
     side squares.  Opponents attacking the player from the side are have a
     +2  "to  hit"  bonus.   The  square marked "r" is the rear square.  An
     opponent  attacking  the player from the rear has a +3 "to hit" bonus.
     Prone  players  are  +4 to hit.  Missile and thrown weapons do not get
     facing  "to hit" bonuses.  In addition, missile and thrown weapons can
     be used to attack distant opponents in the frontal area of the player.

     If  a player is in the front square of a standing enemy he is engaged.
     Engaged  players  must  remain  adjacent or next to all engaging enemy
     characters  during  movement.   In  addition,  players may attack only
     those  enemies  which  are  in  their adjacent front squares (they may
     attack targets farther away if they are using a bow or thrown weapon). 

     Example:   Conan and Draco are fighting Tarna and Garth.  Conan "C" is
     in  Tarna's  "T"  front  area and Draco "D" is in Tarna's side square.
     Draco  can  attack  Tarna  at +2 AG without Tarna being able to attack
     Draco back.  In addition, Draco is in Garth's "G" front area and Conan
     is  in  Garth's  side square.  Conan can attack Garth at +2 AG without
     Garth  being able to attack Conan back.  Conan decides to attack Garth
     instead of Tarna and Draco decides to attack Tarna instead of Garth.

     Race

     Character  race  can  have  an  effect on many facets of the Gladiator
     game.   Some effects of the race modifiers are subtle.  The minimum SH
     and  AG  only come into play when creating the character.  The maximum
     SH,  AG,  and  IQ  only  come  into  play  when  the character reaches
     super-hero experience.

     SH/AG/IQ Base  Attributes given to a new character.  In the case of
                    the  fighter types   (Human,   Dwarf, Elf,  Orc, and
                    Goblin) the  SH and  AG  may be adjusted (by trading
                    points between them).  In the  case of the Mage race
                    all three may be adjusted.

     SH/AG Min      The minimum  allowed during adjustment.  This  keeps
                    Dwarves strong and Elves agile.

     SH/AG/IQ Max   The  maximum  limits   encountered   by  experienced
                    characters. The attributes may increase only so far.

     AR/MP          AR: Any "skin" natural armor the race may have.  MP:
                    the base movement for the  race.  Elves and  Dwarves
                    have  unusual movement  changes  in  that Elves  are
                    quick  except in plate mail and  Dwarves  are always
                    the same moderate speed regardless of armor worn.

     Creatures      Non-intelligent beings.  Cannot carry or use weapons
                    or armor.  Do not accrue experience points.

     Character  races other than Humans (Orcs, Dwarves, Elves, and Goblins)
     have  a  variety of advantages and disadvantages that include improved
     combat  prowess  to  natural armor.  All non-human races pay for their
     advantages initially in terms of a modified attribute total (Agility +
     Strength/Health + IQ is different). 





























                                                                     PAGE 11

     Experience

     Humanoids  (not  creatures)  may accrue experience.  Experience points
     (EXPs)  reflect  skill  in  combat.   Experience is awarded for damage
     inflicted on the enemy and winning battles.  One half experience point
     is  awarded  to  the  attacking  humanoid  for each point of damage he
     inflicts on an enemy.  A bonus of half the total of the enemy's AG and
     IQ  is  awarded  to  the  attacker  that  deals  the  death blow.  One
     experience  point  is  awarded  for  each  SH spent casting successful
     spells.   In  addition,  20  experience  points  are  awarded  to each
     character  that is on the team that wins.  Killed characters loose any
     experience  they  have  acquired  (exception:   see  Altar  Of  Life).
     Experience  can  increase  a  humanoid's  SH and AG.  Every 50 EXPs is
     worth  one SH or AG point experience bonus (Humans).  The extra points
     are  alternately  awarded  to  the SH and AG (fighters).  When a Human
     accrues  50 EXPs his SH will increase by one.  When a Human accrues 50
     more  points to a 100 EXP total his AG will increase by one also.  The
     point  increases  alternate in this manner.  Race has an effect on the
     advancement rate.  This helps to balance the races.  Especially gifted
     races  are  penalized with high experience point bonus levels to limit
     their  dominance  of  the  game.   On  the  other hand, Goblins have a
     reduced level to encourage their advancement.

          Race           Experience Points Advancement Bonus Level

          Goblin                         30                 (  60% )

          Elf                            70                 ( 140% )

     Magi  increase  slightly  differently  than the other races.  Fighters
     (Orcs,  Goblins,  Dwarves, Elves, and Humans) increase one IQ point in
     lieu of  a  SH  or  AG  increase  every 5 increases.  Magi alternately
     increase between all three attributes equally, starting with AG. 



















                                                                     PAGE 12

     Mage Weapons

     Magi  may  only  pick up or obtain certain weapons.  This reflects the
     Mage discipline.  Magi can only use the following weapons:

               Dagger
               Staff
               Caltrops
               Mace
               Flail

     Spells

     Spell  casting  is  achieved by expending a predetermined amount of SH
     points  and  making  a successful AG roll (similar to an attack).  The
     caster  "uses"  his  strength  as  "mana"  to give the spell power and
     effect.   The  more powerful the spell, the more strength is required.
     The  "to  hit"  roll  becomes  a  "to  succeed" roll.  When rolling to
     succeed,  a  roll of 4 results in only half the SH cost being applied,
     and a roll of 3 results in no SH cost being applied (a free spell). 

     Magi have the ability to regenerate one SH point every three turns.  A
     Mage will heal up to his full SH if possible. 

     There  are  three  types  of  spells...   1) missile spells, 2) thrown
     spells,  and 3) special spells.  Missile spells are long range spells,
     thrown spells are short range spells, and special spells are weird. 

     Missile Spells

     Missile  Spells  are  long-range  high-cost  spells.   The SH cost for
     missile  spells  can  be  adjusted  by the casting Mage.  The Mage may
     choose  to  "pump  up"  the  spell  with  a  lot of SH to make it more
     effective.   Missile  spells do the number of dice damage per increase
     in  allotted  SH.   This  is  risky because all allotted SH points are
     spent even if the spell misses.  Missile spells are subject to terrain
     modifiers  just like bows.  In contrast, missile spells may be cast at
     invisible  targets,  unlike normal bow or thrown weapons.  All missile
     spells have a maximum SH spending limit.

(+)  Drain  Life  is  unusual  in three ways.  The first is that the damage
     accrued  to  the  target is not affected by armor.  The second is that
     the  casting  mage will receive in return the amount of damage he does
     to the enemy as Healing SH points.  Healing spells are limited so that
     a  character  can  only  heal above his normal SH by two points (Drain
     Life and Heal-Strength).  The third is that the cost per die damage is
     2  SH.   The SH cost is applied before the healing SH from the target,
     and could leave the mage prone if he visits 1 SH left. 

     Thrown Spells

     Most  thrown  spells  come in two flavors...  "bulk" and "per turn" SH
     cost.   "Bulk"  spells  cost  a  large  amount up front and "per turn"
     spells  cost  a little but have to be paid for on a turn by turn basis
     to  keep  the  spell  in  effect.   Some  thrown spells are similar to
     missile  spells  in  that  the spell may be "pumped up" at the time of
     casting.   A  "nice"  spell  may  only be cast on friends of the Mage.
     Spells  that  are  not "nice"  may only be cast on enemies of the Mage
     (exception:   "teleport  away" and "ESP stats" can be cast on anyone).
     Thrown spells are subject to range and obstacle "to hit" penalties the
     same  as thrown weapons.  Missing a thrown spell only costs 1 SH point
     no matter how much SH had been allotted.

(*)  Agility Magic's effect lasts the entire game.
(+)  Missile Return causes a  friend to become  missile  repellent.  All
     missile or thrown attacks  (including spells) are  sent back to the
     caster.  This doubles the range to hit.  If the enemy rolls a  5 or
     less the  missile weapon hits  the  missile repellent friend anyway
     but the weapon will not  do double  or triple damage.  If the enemy
     rolls 6 or greater and hits, he hits himself.
(-)  Ring of Fire  will  not create  fire  squares  on friends but  will
     create fire squares on enemies.  Magic fire lasts the entire game.

     Adjustable Spells
     Spells  with a "+" modifier in Cost are adjustable and increase in the
     Cost  increment.   For example, "pumping up" an Iron Flesh spell is in
     increments  of  1  SH  but  "pumping  up" an Agility Magic spell is in
     increments of 2 SH. 

     Spell Duration
     Spells  with a "+" modifier in Turn Duration last a number of turns in
     this  increment determined by the number of times the spell is "pumped
     up". 

     Special Spells

     All  other  spells  fall  into  this category.  These spells are quite
     varied  and  are  broken  down here by functional groups.  All special
     spells  cost  the  spell cost -1 point when they fail.  Special spells
     that have a cost of 1 SH or zero SH and fail do not cost anything. 

     Summon Spells
     These  spells  summon  a  creature  to be controlled by the Mage.  The
     spell  has  to  be  renewed  (costing  1 SH point) or cancelled at the
     beginning  of  the  Mage's  action  every  so  many  turns.   Summoned
     creatures  are  real in all regards but will vanish when the Mage dies
     or  cancels the summon.  The creature will appear at a random location
     around the Mage facing the direction the mage is facing.

     Illusion Spells
     Illusions  are  identical  to  summon  spells except that the illusion
     creature  may  be "disbelieved" and that the illusion does not have to
     be renewed (they do not require any SH to maintain).

     Terrain Spells
     The  following terrain spells create one terrain item in a location on
     or around the mage.  The target location is chosen by the mage and may
     be  in  any  unoccupied  square  (friendly  squares are permitted when
     creating  Shadow  or Exit).  Spell cost for terrain is a fixed cost up
     front like illusion spells.

     Terrain blocked by walls or off the map will not be created.  The size
     shown is the absolute maximum.  The spell will tend to fit the area it
     is  in  and "flow" out to create the size shown.  Fire and shadow will
     pile on top of themselves making dense terrain.  Fire terrain will not
     be created on friends. 

     Other Special Spells

     Dazzle              IQ: 11    Cost: 3        Duration: 3 turns

     This  spell  is  a  bright flash emanating from the mage.  All enemies
     able  to see the Mage are -3 AG for 3 turns after this spell goes into
     effect.   Characters  able to see the mage are characters that are not
     prone, have the mage in their front side, and are not behind a wall. 

     Psychic Blast       IQ: 11    Cost: 3

     This  spell does 1d damage to all enemies within 5 squares (inclusive)
     of  the  mage.   The  mage  and his friends are not hurt.  The psychic
     quality  of  the  spell  causes  the damage to be imparted without any
     armor effect (like terrain and Drain Life damage). 

     Snake Staff         IQ: 8     Cost: 1xN      Duration: 5 turns

     This  spell  requires  a ready staff to work.  The staff may be turned
     into 1 to 3 snakes depending on the SH put into the spell.  The snakes
     are controlled by the mage and last five turns. 

     Image               IQ: 9     Cost: 2        Duration: 4 turns

     This  spell  creates  two  duplicates  of the Mage around the Mage and
     moves the mage in one random square.  The two images are insubstantial
     and  will  vanish  when a successful attack or spell is carried out on
     them.   This spell is purely defensive and works like the "shell game"
     if played well.  Images last four turns. 

     ESP Stats           IQ: 8     Cost: 0

     ESP  Stats  is  unlike  any  other  spell.   ESP  Stats can be used to
     determine  the  location  of  an  invisible enemy, or to determine the
     actual attributes or wounds of an enemy.  ESP Stats is rolled for like
     a Special Spell.  If successful, the casting mage will be able to view
     his choice of up to three enemies.  The number of enemies to view is a
     random  number  between  one and three.  Because the cost is 0 SH, ESP
     Stats  may not be aborted by adjusting spell cost to 0 (the spell cost
     adjustment step is skipped).

     Fighter Spells

     After  attaining  an  IQ of 10 or higher fighters may use spells.  The
     mix  of spells is random and provided when fighting starts.  A fighter
     will have roughly half of the spells available to his IQ.  The odds of
     getting  any  one  spell  is 50%.  In addition, when a fighter casts a
     spell he has a reduced agility as a penalty.  The agility of a fighter
     casting  a  spell  is the average of his AG and IQ.  Keep in mind that
     fighters  DO NOT REGENERATE and each SH point lost to spell casting is
     permanent for the duration of the game.  These are the spells fighters
     can use:

     Robot Characters

     Certain  races  cannot  be  controlled  by  the players and are played
     solely  by  the computer.  These are the robots.  These characters are
     added  to  even  the  East  and  West  sides arbitrarily when the game
     starts.   Robots  will  tend  to  out  number  the  player  controlled
     counterparts  as  they  are  not  as flexible in strategy, weapons, or
     spells.

     Needler Bush Tactics

     Basically,  these  bushes  are stupid.  They will come at you and pelt
     you  with  their  needles until they are killed.  Once they get within
     firing  range  they  will  slow down their movement (no more running).
     They  will  always  avoid  fire  terrain,  and  will avoid caltrops if
     wounded.   They  will  first shoot at whoever engages them, or failing
     that,  the  closest target (even if it is evading).  They do not evade
     unless  they  have  nothing  to attack.  Occasionally they will become
     wounded  badly  enough  where they will start charging for the exit to
     escape (unless they are engaged). 

     Giant Amoeba Tactics

     Another  simple,  brainless  race.   The  Amoeba will come at you full
     steam  and attack you until it is killed.  Like the Needler, they will
     always  avoid  fire  terrain  and  will  avoid  caltrops  if  wounded.
     Occasionally  it  will  try  to  jump you (attempt hand combat).  They
     usually do not repel anyone that attempts hand combat with them.  They
     do  not evade unless they have nothing to attack.  These too will make
     for the exit if severely wounded (unless they are engaged). 

     Fire Spirit Tactics

     Similar  to  Amoebas,  Fire Spirits will come at you full steam.  They
     will  never  avoid  fire terrain (they are immune to it) and will only
     avoid  caltrops  if  they are worse than half dead.  They have but one
     thought:   envelope  you  with flame.  It's a barbecue, and you're the
     meat.   When  they  get up to you they will continually try to get you
     into  hand combat.  Once in hand combat, you will be in for a hot time
     as  the  Fire  Spirit's  attack  becomes  6 points damage and the fire
     terrain  he  creates  will  do an additional 3 points of damage, for a
     total  of  9  points  per  turn.   If they charge up to you, they will
     attack  that  turn with fire as they cannot attempt hand combat unless
     they  shift  (like  everyone  else).   If  you  are  strong  enough to
     consistently repel their hand combat attempts, you can ignore them and
     the  fire  terrain they create (one per turn, where they are standing)
     can  help  you  toast other foes.  They are smart enough to evade when
     threatened with a death blow, and will make for the exit when severely
     damaged (unless they are engaged).

     Phase Spider Tactics

     Things get tougher when you start seeing the Phase Spiders.  They move
     quite  differently  from  virtually  all  other  robots.   They have a
     limited  range teleport they use to move (a "phase shift") and they do
     not  have  to  stay  engaged when they move.  The exception to this is
     when  they  are in hand combat during which they cannot "phase shift".
     The  "phase shift" movement makes them hard to corner, and they have a
     tendency  to  get  behind you.  They will generally avoid caltrops and
     fire  terrain.  Once suffering from heavy wounds they will make a "bee
     line"  for the exit (although they will only be able to move 4 squares
     per  turn).  If they have no adjacent enemy, they will throw a caustic
     stream  of web material at the closest target (even if it is evading).
     If  they  have  an  adjacent  enemy they will generally attack it with
     their  deadlier  weapon (the bite), but will occasionally attack using
     only  the  web,  or  attack  with both the web and the bite.  They are
     smart  enough  to  evade  when  threatened with a death blow, and will
     evade if they have no targets within range. 

     Imp Tactics

     Imps  can  be  deadly,  but  are  generally  a  nuisance.   The  Imp's
     invisibility  coupled with its  regeneration makes it fairly difficult
     to  kill  (nearly  an impossible task for a low experience character).
     The  Imp  will come at you full steam, and will not avoid fire terrain
     or  caltrops  unless  it  is  suffering  from  wounds.  The Imp has an
     annoying  habit of  stealing weapons.  If you have enough armor (where
     the Imp's fists won't do much) or are just plain unlucky (about 1 turn
     out  of  3)  the  Imp  will  try  and  swipe your ready weapon.  If he
     succeeds  in  his  attack,  he  will take your weapon and sling it (he
     won't  be  able to use it on you).  If he has a weapon and is engaged,
     he  will  disengage  if he can get out of all enemy front squares.  He
     will  attempt  to  take  the  weapon  away (generally toward the exit)
     during  movement  and he will drop it as soon as he has an attack turn
     in  which  he  is disengaged.  If he does not try and take a weapon or
     get  away  with one,  he will dual attack an adjacent target with both
     fists.   The Imp is smart enough to evade when threatened with a death
     blow, and it will head for the exit when severely damaged (although it
     may  regenerate  and  return  to  the  fight).  For Magi,  the Imp may
     disbelieve  illusions  depending  on  how  many  there  are present (1
     illusion  will  be  ignored,  more  illusions  increase the chances of
     disbelief).

     Slayer Tactics

     The  Slayer  can be very deadly, as he has a pole arm and knows how to
     charge  and receive charge for double damage.  The Slayer will come at
     you  full  steam  until  he  is  within  shooting  distance  (about 25
     squares), then slow down.  He will then generally charge or shift.  If
     he  shifts and is disengaged he will use his Krill as a missile weapon
     and  shoot  the  nearest target (even if it is evading).  If he shifts
     and  has  a  foe  who  charged up to him in his front, he will receive
     charge.   If  he  charges  up to a foe, he will impale the foe.  If he
     shifts and does not have a charging foe, he will generally attack with
     either  the  Krill  Bolt  or  Krill  Stab (50% chance of either).  The
     Slayer  may dual attack if the conditions are favorable (the target is
     neither invisible, evasive, or a snake).  The slayer will head for the
     exit if heavily damaged, and is smart enough to disengage if necessary
     to  get  there.   The  Krill  weapon can be dropped, and if the Slayer
     losses  his  Krill  he  will  make  an effort to recover it (including
     disengaging if necessary).  If he has no Krill and cannot disengage or
     pick  one  up,  the  Slayer will attack with a right cross (his fist).
     Like  Imps,  the Slayer may disbelieve illusions depending on how many
     there are present (1 illusion will be ignored, more illusions increase
     the chances of disbelief). 

     Behemoth Tactics

     Behemoths  are  simple  but  effective.   They always come at you full
     steam, and plan on eating you for lunch.  They only evade if they have
     no  enemy to attack.  They only avoid fire terrain or caltrops if they
     are  mostly  dead.  They will usually attack with their craw, but will
     occasionally  (1  out  of  3) attack with their crush.  Behemoths will
     sometimes  (1  out of 6) dual attack using the craw and crush provided
     the  target is not hard to hit.  In addition, Behemoths will sometimes
     attempt  hand  combat  with  their  target.   If  severely  wounded, a
     Behemoth  will  make  for  the  exit, although they have been known to
     wander around it without exiting, serving as a guard. 




















                                                                     PAGE 22

     Evil Mage Tactics

     The  Evil  Mage is the most deadly and most cunning of the robots.  As
     such,  his  tactics  are  far  more  varied  than  the  other  robots.
     Therefore,  this paragraph will attempt to define only the basics, and
     not  the total package as it would become too complicated (and detract
     from  the  challenge  of  the  game).  The Evil Mage moves in a manner
     similar  to  the Phase Spider, but instead of heading for you the Evil
     Mage  heads  for  the  nearest strongest robot (typically a Behemoth).
     The Evil Mage's primary function is to boost the Behemoths capability.
     It  can  do  this by (1) giving the Behemoth additional agility points
     (see  Agility Magic spell), (2) speeding the Behemoth (see Magic Speed
     spell), and (3) give the Behemoth a Death Sword (a SH:30 5d+5 slashing
     weapon  which  you  can  have  provided  you  can get it away from the
     Behemoth).   Secondary  to boosting the Behemoth is killing you.  This
     can be accomplished by a couple of ways:  Psychic Blast and Drain Life
     (which is limited to 2d damage).  Which one the Evil Mage chooses will
     depend  on  how  many  are  close to death and how close they are.  In
     addition,  the  Evil Mage will attempt to thwart you.  He does this by
     using Dazzle, Lose Weapon, Clumsiness, or Curse Armor spells.  He will
     dazzle  if three or more of your party can see him and are not already
     dazzled.   Lastly,  he  will attempt to keep himself alive.  This will
     sometimes  require  a  Drain  Life  to boost his SH back up.  For self
     preservation  he can (1) armor himself with Steel Flesh, (2) Teleport,
     or (3) Teleport you Away (remember that he has constant Missile Return
     which  makes  him immune to being targeted by spells, missile weapons,
     and  thrown weapons, and he regenerates 1 SH every turn).  He is smart
     enough  to  evade when threatened with a death blow, and will head for
     the  exit  when severely wounded.  In addition, the Evil Mage has much
     better  target  selection  than  the other robots.  The Evil Mage will
     target  someone  he can kill AND hit and will generally NOT target the
     closest enemy, or an enemy that is evading. 

     Terrain

     Eight  types  of  terrain  exist:   open,  fire,  pit, caltrops, wall,
     shadow, exit, and the Altar Of Life.  Open terrain is shown as a patch
     of dots.  Fire terrain is shown as spiked waves.  Pit terrain is shown
     as  a  rounded  box  with  lines in one corner.  Caltrops are shown as
     three  spiked  stars.  Wall terrain is shown as brick.  Shadow terrain
     is shown as a sponge.  The exit is shown as a door.  The Altar Of Life
     is  shown as a box with a cross on it.  Some types of terrain make you
     harder  to  see  or  can  hurt  you.   All terrain damage and "to hit"
     penalties  are  cumulative.  A character standing in two fires will be
     harder  to  shoot at and will take twice the normal fire damage at the
     end of the turn.  Armor does not protect against terrain damage. 

     Fire  :  Fires may be crossed or entered.  A character ending the turn
     standing on a fire will take 3 points of damage.  In addition, missile
     attacks obstructed by fire are penalized for the lack of visibility...
     -1 to hit per fire. 




                                                                     PAGE 23

     Pit   :   May not be crossed or entered.  The exception to this is the
     troll,  who  may  move freely in and out of pits without falling down.
     Another  exception  is  the  shield rush which may be used to force an
     enemy  to  fall  into a pit.  Falling down in a pit causes 4 points of
     damage.   Going  into hand combat with a troll causes pit damage also,
     as both parties will be going "prone" or falling down. 

     Caltrops :  Like fire, the caltrops terrain can be crossed or entered.
     A  character  ending  the  turn  on  caltrops takes damage (2 points).
     Caltrops do not obstruct missile attacks (bow shots). 

     Wall  :   Walls  are  impervious...   they  cannot  be entered, passed
     through, or shot through.  Walls are not a natural form of terrain and
     are  created  by magic users.  If a Wall is created on a square with a
     pit the Wall and Pit cancel each other, leaving open terrain. 

     Shadow  :  This form of terrain is a magical enchantment.  The purpose
     of  Shadow  is  purely  defensive.   Shadow  may  be entered or passed
     through.   Anyone  standing  in  Shadow  is  invisible  and may not be
     targeted  by  bow  or  thrown weapons.  In addition, attacks against a
     person in Shadow are -2 to hit.  Shooting through Shadow receives a -4
     to hit penalty per shadow.  Shadow does not cause damage. 

     Exit  :   Using  the exit can allow you to escape death (and keep your
     accumulated experience).  Ending the turn standing on an exit will get
     the  character  out  of the game.  The game starts with one exit along
     the  center North or South wall of the map.  Being forced onto an exit
     will also cause the character to leave the game. 

     Altar Of Life :
     When  a  player  character  is killed he becomes a pile of bones.  The
     bones may  be picked up by another player character and dropped on the
     Altar  Of  Life to resurrect the dead character.  To drop the bones on
     the  Altar,  get  adjacent  to  the Altar with a shift or shuffle move
     holding  the  "bones"  in  your ready hand and use the "throw" option.
     Respond  with  a "n" to the query to throw the bones at a target until
     all  targets  are  exhausted  and  the  query "Do you wish to drop the
     bones..."  appears.  Answer "y" to start the selection of the adjacent
     square to drop the bones in.  Answer "y" when the bones are shown over
     the  Altar.  The resurrected player will have a 20% penalty applied to
     his  experience  points  for  having died (the resurrection process is
     imperfect).   The  resurrected  character  will  appear  in  a  random
     location near the Altar with no weapons, no armor, and little strength
     (SH  3).   Also  note  that  you  do  not  have  to resurrect the dead
     character the game he or she is killed:  the bones will keep returning
     to the arena in future games until they are resurrected.

Your choice?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The  area  with  dots in it is the arena and the bottom five lines are
     used for menus (as above), messages, and simulated dice throwing.  The
     arena  area is a top view:  you are looking down onto the arena from a
     vantage  point  in  the  sky.  The arena consists of a grid of squares
     (denoted with one dot per square above, but in the game each square is
     a patch of dots).  Each square holds one character or item of terrain. 


















                                                                     PAGE 25

     Menus

     The  primary  Gladiator  user interface is by multiple-choice menus in
     the  message  area (the area below the arena).  Each menu choice has a
     single   capitalized   letter   which  selects  it.   This  letter  is
     high-lighted  for  easy  reading.   A menu choice is confirmed with an
     "enter" or "return" key press.  To negate a selection during "Confirm"
     any keys but the menu letter for that selection and return will result
     in  the  selection  being  aborted.  In this way you can type the menu
     letter (such as V for View hi-scores) many times and then confirm with
     a return key press.  Here is the initial menu once again:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------.

     The player then presses the "m" key...

     The player then presses the enter or return key...

     At  this  point,  a  new  character  has  been  created.  The starting
     character  created  is  a  Human with average attributes, weapons, and
     armor.   In  addition,  the  character  will  have  to be named as the
     default name (the 000 above) will not be accepted. 











                                                                     PAGE 26

     More Interface

     In  most  gladiator  messages  the  information  on the screen will be
     displayed  until  the  player is done looking at it.  In this case the
     "<more>"  box  will  appear in the bottom right corner indicating that
     Gladiator  is  waiting  for  you  to  finish  reading.   When you have
     finished  reading press a key.  In some instances, special keys may be
     used  to  determine  what  is  displayed next (like the "weapon info",
     "spell  info",  and  "look  around" menu choices).  In these cases the
     space bar causes the information to cycle.  The return key or 'q' will
     usually terminate a cycling set of messages.  Plus, minus, or tab will
     usually  work,  with the minus key going backwards, the plus key going
     one forwards, and the tab key advancing five ahead. 

     View Stats Display

     This  message  display  is  shown when you use the "show character" or
     "view  stats"  menu  options.  Unless you use magic, you may only view
     your  own  characters.   The  cursor  is placed on the character being
     featured.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------'

     This  display is private because it shows exact status which would not
     be  apparent  from  just  looking  at  the  character.  The numbers in
     parenthesis are the normal values and the numbers to the right are the
     current  adjusted  values.   The current values reflect the effects of
     wounds,  armor,  and  magic.   In  the  example  Grim  has  taken 2 SH
     (strength/health) points  of  wound  damage.   Grim's  AG (agility) is
     reduced by one because he is wearing his shield. 

     Set up

     One  character  at a time is created or loaded and is to be set up for
     combat.   A  choice  of  available  weapons and armor is given and the
     player may arrange those to prepare for the start of combat.  Any time
     a  character  is  not being created or loaded the characters currently
     set  up  may  be  viewed  or  removed  from  the team (using the "dump
     character" option). 










                                                                     PAGE 27

     Phases

     Once  you  select "Begin Game" the game will start.  The computer will
     lay  out  random  fire  terrain, pit terrain, and locate an exit.  The
     computer  will  create  a group of robots for you to fight.  Each game
     turn consists of three phases:

          Incentive Phase     : Someone gets to decide who moves first
          Movement Phase      : First team moves, Second team moves
          Actions Phase       : Each character takes action in AG order

     The  first  phase  is  skipped  if one team (East or West) cannot move
     (either  prone  or  unconscious).   In  addition,  terrain effects are
     applied immediately after the last phase (actions). 

     Incentive Phase

     You  and the computer will each "roll" a die for incentive.  Whichever
     team  gets  the  higher  number gets to choose who moves their players
     first.   If the numbers are equal Gladiator arbitrates which team gets
     the  incentive.   Gladiator gives the incentive to West on even turns,
     East  on  odd turns (when the rolls tie).  The computer always chooses
     to move last (provided it wins the incentive). 

     Dice

     Simulated  six-sided  die  throwing is common in Gladiator.  Gladiator
     "rolls"  the  die on the screen and the user presses a key to stop the
     rolling.   The  die  is  actually  rolled one last time after a key is
     pressed so the outcome cannot be anticipated.

     Looking Around

     This  message  display is shown when you select the "look around" menu
     option.   Looking  Around is available in both the Movement and Action
     phases  and  can  help you plan your moves and actions.  The cursor is
     placed on the character being featured.  Hitting the space bar or plus
     key  will  cycle  through  all the characters in the arena (or you can
     select  the one you want by left mouse button clicking it).  Press the
     enter or return key when done.

     Ready refers  to the weapon that the  character has ready  to  use.
     Also refers to a weapon that the character  has  in addition to his
     primary or Ready weapon  that may be  used  in some  special cases.
     Slung weapons are two weapon holsters that are used to hold weapons
     not  ready  for use.  The  option  to  change  weapons  allows  the
     character to switch from a long bow  for attacking at a distance to
     a sword for close-in hacking.  The numbers 1 and 2 for  the "Slung"
     items are used to distinguish between the slung items when changing
     weapons.  The top "Slung" is number 1, and the bottom is number 2. 

     #Crossbow shows  that the crossbow  has been  fired and needs to be
     reloaded.  Crossbows must be loaded to be fired and  take a turn or
     more  to reload.  The "#"  in front of  the crossbow shows that the
     crossbow is unloaded and may not be used to attack. 

     The stuff along the right margin indicates that the player is standing
     in  a  square  that  has  items  or terrain in it.  The terrain or top
     weapon  is shown on the arena in the event there is more than a single
     item  in  the  square.   When a character is standing on a square with
     terrain  or  weapons  the  items  will show up in the "looking around"
     display.   A  maximum of three items are shown on the display although
     more may be in the square.  The top item in the square is shown on the
     top.   The  bottom  item  is  shown on the bottom.  If more than three
     items are in the square the items between the top and bottom items are
     represented  by  dots  in  the  middle.   In  the  example  above, the
     character  is standing in shadow terrain and a Short Bow and Spear are
     on  the bottom of the pile.  Three unknown items are between the Short
     Bow and the Shadow (the three dots). 

     In  addition to the above displayed items, the words "Prone," "HandC,"
     or "Dazed" may be displayed.  These indicate the following:
     Prone : the character is flat on the ground or otherwise disabled.
     HandC : the character is in Hand Combat with an enemy or enemies.
     Dazed : the character is suffering a reduced agility due to wounds. 

     Movement Phase

     Each  player  character  is  moved  one  at a time in the order of the
     fastest  player  to the slowest player (highest MP to lowest MP).  All
     of  one  team  is  moved before the other team moves (which team moves
     first  is based on who won the incentive).  A player is given movement
     choices based on whether or not he is prone, engaged with an enemy, or
     out  in the open.  The distance a character moves will determine which
     options  are  open...  the shorter distance a character moves the more
     he will be able to do during the actions phase. 


                                                                     PAGE 29

     Movement Interface

     -----------------------------------------------------------------.
      Moves Left[10]  ^C < Conan >                                    |
                  Arrows = Move Player  'R' = Rotate (change facing)  |
       'J' = Jump    Esc = Start Over   Return = Finished             |
                                                                      |
     -----------------------------------------------------------------'

     As  an  arrow  key is pressed the player is moved on the arena and the
     number  of  moves  is  reduced.   When the number of moves is zero the
     arrow  keys  will  have  no  effect.  At this point the player may 'R'
     rotate, 'ESC' escape (start over), or 'Return'.  Rotate and escape may
     be  used  at any time.  Rotate will change the character's facing.  If
     the  character  is  invisible  or  prone the character's facing may be
     determined  by  looking  at  the  character  graphic shown between the
     "moves  left"  and  the character's name.  Hitting the escape key will
     put the character back in his original position and facing so the move
     can  be  started again.  Pressing the return or enter key confirms the
     move and ends the character's movement.  Every square is counted as it
     is entered.  Stepping forward and then back will reduce the moves left
     by  2  (as opposed to not reducing the moves left at all).  Moves left
     will  also  be  affected by entering an enemy's front square (becoming
     "engaged").   In  this case, moves left is reduced immediately to zero
     indicating  the  character's attention is riveted on the enemy at this
     point.   In  this case, the player may wish to start the move over and
     side-step  the enemy to get around his front squares.  It is generally
     a good idea to use the escape key and try-out several moves. 

     Jump Movement Option

     Movement  has  the option 'J' for jumping (theoretically to be used to
     jump over pits or jump over people but any square may be jumped).  The
     Jump  can  be  useful  for  bypassing  obstacles.   The jump moves the
     character  the  direction  he  is  facing  two  squares  costing three
     movement  points.   The  first  square  is jumped over and may contain
     "unenterable"  terrain  such  as a wall or another player.  The option
     works  provided  you  have  at  least  3  moves left to expend and the
     landing  square  is  enterable.  The direction jumped is the direction
     the  character  is  currently  facing.  The next or adjacent square is
     "jumped  over"  and  the  character  lands  in the second square away.
     Moves  left  is  decremented  by 3 for every jump.  Jumping a pit will
     save  one  movement  point  compared  to running around a pit (the "#"
     character):

     Action Phase
     Actions are done in current agility order regardless of side.  Current
     or adjusted agility  means  the AG after the effects of wounds, armor,
     and magic.  Agile characters get to act first, and slow characters act
     last.   What  action can be taken is determined by how little time was
     used  moving.   If the player moved a great distance (running) then no
     time  is left for an action.  If the player waits then all actions are
     available  (unless  prone).  Keeping this in mind the player will only
     go  as  far as a charge when he wants to attack with a hand weapon, as
     far  as  a  shuffle when he wants to change weapons or throw a weapon,
     and up to a shift when he wants to shoot a bow or cast a spell.

(*)  When you are prone this is all you can do.
(+)  Changing your facing is limited on a SHIFT when you are engaged.
($)  Attack also includes the options of Slash,  Shield Attack, Dual
     Attack, Impale, and Shield Rush.
(~)  Evasion  causes  all  incoming attacks to  be  rolled on four  dice
     instead of three (making it more difficult to be hit).
(=)  Receiving  a charge or impale only  applies  to  those players that
     have  a   ready pole arm.   With  Impale   the  player must move 2+
     squares.  With Receive  the   player  must Shift or  less.    These
     options do double damage.  Receive is +2 to hit a charging enemy. 

                                                                     PAGE 31

     Movement Explained

     WAIT or
     SHIFT  (Always)
     During  this  turn  the player did not move at all or moved one square
     during  movement  phase.  During a SHIFT an engaged player will not be
     allowed  to  "about face" his facing.  During actions phase the player
     has  the full range of options open.  This does not mean he may do any
     option  he  chooses.   The  player  will  be presented with only those
     options  that  make  sense  for  his given situation (for example:  no
     shooting  unless you have a loaded bow of some kind).  This is true at
     all times. 

     SHUFFLE (when not engaged)
     During  this turn the player could have changed facing and moved up to
     two  squares.   During  actions  phase  the player will have a reduced
     range  of options if he moved the full two squares.  On the other hand
     he must move the full two squares if he wishes to establish "charging"
     status.   Charging  is  required  for  the  "shield rush" and "impale"
     options.   Moving two squares (the minimum for "charging" status) will
     also  entitle  an  enemy to the "receive charge" option (provided they
     choose  to  face you, have done no more than a shift, and have a ready
     pole arm).   If the two squares are moved, the player will not be able
     to shoot, disengage, cast, or attempt hand combat. 

     CHARGE (when not engaged)
     During  this turn the player could have moved up to one-half his MP in
     squares.  During actions phase the player will have a reduced range of
     options  depending on how many squares he travels.  If he travels none
     or  one  square,  the  move  is considered a SHIFT (see above).  If he
     travels  two squares the move is considered a SHUFFLE (see above).  If
     he  travels more than two squares, he will have the reduced options of
     a SHUFFLE plus he may no longer reload, get a slung weapon, or throw a
     weapon.   He  is able to swap "ready" and "also" weapons and or pickup
     or drop weapons with the DROP/PICKUP WEAPON option. 

     RUN (when not engaged)
     During  this  turn  the  player  could have moved up to his full MP in
     squares.  During actions phase the player will have a reduced range of
     options depending on how far he actually moved.  If he moves less than
     or equal to half his movement see CHARGE above.  Moving more than half
     of your MP allowance consumes your turn completely and no options will
     be available in the actions phase. 

     Engaged :  A player is engaged when he is standing in an enemy's front
     square.   When  engaged, a player must remain adjacent to all engaging
     enemies and may only use Shift or Wait moves. 








                                                                     PAGE 32

     Actions Explained

     STAND (Always)
     This  action  is a "do nothing" provided the character is not "prone."
     If  he  is  prone, he will "stand up" by taking this option.  If he is
     not  prone  he  "waits"  with  this  option.  Standing up from a prone
     position  will  allow  the  character  to  change  his facing with the
     restrictions of a SHIFT (if engaged, no "about face"). 

     CAST MAGIC SPELL (shift or less)
     This  action  requires a shift or wait move.  A spell is successful if
     you  roll  your AG or less on the dice with any "to hit" modifications
     applied.  In addition, a spell cannot be attempted without sacrificing
     some strength points.  See Spells. 

     DISENGAGE (shift or less)
     This option is open to those that have shifted or waited.  This option
     is  used  to  retreat  (and  stand  up  if  prone) from combat.  For a
     successful  disengage  from hand combat the player must make a roll of
     his  AG  or  less.   If  successful  the player is allowed to move one
     square (exception: Orcs can disengage 2 squares). 

     SHOOT BOW or
     SHOOT CROSSBOW (shift or less)
     This  action is open to those characters that have moved one square or
     no  squares and have a ready bow weapon.  A crossbow must be loaded to
     shoot (no "#" in front of the name "Crossbow").  In addition, an enemy
     target must be to the front of the firing character.  Crossbows may be
     fired  and  loaded while prone.  Firing a crossbow prone gives a +2 to
     hit  bonus  for added accuracy.  When selecting a bow target, you will
     be given a message "shoot at ..." for each possible target on the map.
     Enter  "y" for your desired target.  Enter "n" or hit the space bar to
     go to the next target.  You may also select your target by clicking it
     with  the left mouse button.  If you enter "n" to the last target (the
     bottom  right  one)  then the shot will be aborted and the action menu
     will be redisplayed. 

     RECEIVE CHARGE (shift or less)
     This  option  is  open to players that have an enemy that charges them
     and  the  player  is holding a pole arm.  This option reflects bracing
     the  pole  arm  butt against the ground and receiving the enemy charge
     with  the  pole  arm  blade.   If  the  enemy  moves  2+ squares he is
     considered  to  be going fast enough.  Receive charge gives the player
     +2 to hit bonus and does double damage on a hit. 

     TRY HAND COMBAT (shift or less)
     Hand  combat  (a deadly form of wrestling) is initiated by this option
     and  is  successful  if  the  defender chooses to be in hand combat or
     fails  a  roll  to  repel the attacker.  The roll made to repel a hand
     combat attempt is against the defender's AG modified by the difference
     in  strengths  of  the  attacker  and  defender.   When hand combat is
     initiated  any  weapons  in  "ready"  or "also" are dropped.  See Hand
     Combat. 


                                                                     PAGE 33

     THROW WEAPON/DROP NEARBY (shuffle or less)
     This option allows the player to throw his ready weapon at a target he
     is  facing.  Range affects the ability to hit by -1 to hit per square.
     Another  single  handed  weapon  will automatically be readied after a
     throw.  The new weapon will be the first found in the order of "slung"
     (top),  "slung" (bottom), and "also".  If you do not throw (say "n" to
     all  targets)  you can place the ready item on an adjacent square (see
     Caltrops). 

     IMPALE (shuffle or more)
     This option is open is to players with a ready pole arm that move 2 or
     more  squares.   Similar  to  Receive  Charge,  the attack does double
     damage  if it hits.  This reflects the ability of a piercing weapon to
     do great damage when enough momentum is applied. 

     SHIELD RUSH (shuffle or more)
     This  option  is open to players that have a ready shield.  The Shield
     Rush  is  just  like a Shield Attack except the player has a +2 to hit
     bonus  and  the  defender  has  a -2 fall down penalty.  If the player
     hits,  the  defender must roll to keep from falling down.  The roll is
     his  agility  or  less  modified by the difference of the attacker and
     defender's  strength.   If  the  defender  falls  down the attacker is
     allowed  to choose the adjacent square the defender falls in (possibly
     a pit or fire terrain). 

     CHANGE WEAPON/SHIELD (shuffle or less)
     This option allows the player to move his weapons around, pick weapons
     up, or drop weapons.  Shields are treated as weapons. 

     RELOAD CROSSBOW (shuffle or less)
     This  options  allows  the player to reload a unloaded crossbow.  This
     may be done while prone. 

     ATTACK (charge or less)
     This  option  is open to a player with a ready hand weapon (or natural
     weapon  such as Fists).  An attack will hit if the total of three dice
     equals  to or is less than the attacker's agility.  This "to hit" roll
     may  be  adjusted  by a variety of modifiers such as facing (attacking
     from  the  rear  or  a  prone  opponent),  being  dazed,  attacking an
     invisible  target, or attacking in hand combat.  The purpose of Attack
     is to damage or kill the enemy.  If the to hit roll is successful, the
     attacking weapon damage is applied to the enemy's SH minus enemy armor
     (see Wounds). 

     Slash Attack (charge or less)
     Slashing  is  a  form  of  attack in which the attacker can attack all
     enemies  in his front squares.  The attacker must have a slashing type
     weapon  (sword or axe) ready.  The defenders are attacked in clockwise
     order.   The  first  defender is attacked at -2 to hit.  The following
     defenders (up to five total targets) are attacked at -4 to hit. 

     Shield Attack (shift or less)
     This is identical to a Shield Rush but is less effective (no +2 to hit
     bonus  and  no  -2 fall down penalty).  When moving more than a square
     this option becomes the Shield Rush. 
                                                                     PAGE 34

     Dual Attack (charge or less)
     This  option  is  open  to  players  that are not holding a two handed
     weapon.   Any two opponents in the frontal area can be attacked (or an
     opponent  can be attacked twice).  The attacker chooses which enemy is
     attacked in what order.  The first attack is with the ready weapon and
     is -2 to hit.  The second attack uses the "also" weapon at -3 to hit. 

     EVADE (charge or less)
     This option makes the player harder to hit by causing incoming attacks
     to  roll "to hit" on four dice instead of three.  This option reflects
     a defensive posture such as parrying or dodging. 

     DROP/PICK UP WEAPON (charge or less)
     This becomes the Change Weapon option if the player moves 2 squares or
     less.   Moving  more than two squares limits the change weapon ability
     so  that  weapons cannot be slung.  Any unslung weapon must be readied
     or  left on the ground.  Items can still be picked up or dropped.  You
     must  empty  both  hands  (drop everything) before you will be able to
     unsling a weapon. 

     DISBELIEVE/ZAP ILLUSION (charge or less)
     If  a  magical  illusion  is  present and the "disbelieving" character
     successfully  rolls  his  IQ  or  less  on  three dice the illusion is
     dispelled  (removed  from  play).  When multiple illusions are present
     the  closest  illusion is dispelled.  If no illusions are present this
     action has no effect. 

     GO PRONE (charge or less)
     This option is generally reserved for players with crossbows that want
     the  prone  +2  to  hit  bonus  with  a  crossbow.   Being  prone is a
     disadvantage as it limits your options and makes you easy to hit. 

     VIEW STATS (Always)
     This  option  costs  nothing  in  terms of time or options.  The stats
     display  can be used to see how your weapons are situated or what your
     wounds are. 

     LOOK AROUND (Always)
     Like  "view-stats"  this  is  free  and  may be used repeatedly before
     making your action.  Looking around can tell you if someone has moved,
     has  attacked,  or when someone is going to move or attack.  The order
     people  are  shown  is  the  order  they will take their turn in.  See
     Looking Around. 

     Gladiator  will  only offer the options available to the player at the
     time  so  it is not possible to break the rules.  This makes Gladiator
     easier  to  play  but  does  not  relieve  the need for written rules.
     Gladiator  has many subtle strategies which become apparent only after
     careful  observation.   This  is  especially true in the actions phase
     when the options available are based on what has gone before.

     Missile Obstacles

     Currently  obstacles  for missile weapons (bow shot or thrown objects)
     are  characters,  shadow squares, fires, walls, and the Altar Of Life.
     Each  character  or  fire in the missile track is a -1 to hit penalty.
     Each  shadow  in  the missile track is a -4 to hit penalty.  Walls and
     the  Altar  Of Life block missile shots completely.  Remember, you can
     only shoot at enemies you are facing.

     Wounds

     The  following describes the effects of wounds.  These effects are for
     most  races  (such  as Humans).  Other races can withstand more damage
     before  being  effected.  Some races are immune to these effects.  All
     the  wound  effects are cumulative but not additive.  In other words a
     knocked  down  player  will be dazed but additional 5 point or greater
     hits  will  not  make  the humanoid "dazed dazed" and will not further
     reduce his AG.

     Knocked Down : A single blow of 8 or more SH points will knock down
     a character.  Prone characters  may  only WAIT, SHOOT CROSSBOW,  or
     RELOAD.  Some creatures cannot be knocked down (such as Amoebas).

     Dazed  :  A single  blow  of 5  or  more SH  points  will "daze"  a
     character.   A dazed character will have  a -2 AG   penalty for his
     next action (be it this turn if he has not acted yet, or  next turn
     if he has already acted).

     Permanently Dazed :  A character  that has his SH reduced  to  3 or
     less is always dazed.  In addition, the character will not  be able
     to RUN.

     Unconscious : A character that has his SH reduced to 1 is virtually
     dead.  He will  collapse every turn  until killed or the game ends.
     Some races regenerate SH points and will be able to return to play.

     Dead : A character that has his SH reduced to 0 or less is dead and
     is removed from play.  This character loses any gained experience. 

     Agility Rolls

     All  agility  rolls  are  limited  so any attack may hit and may miss.
     This is done to avoid "automatic kills" and "automatic misses." A roll
     of  5  or less always hits.  A roll of 16 or better always misses.  In
     addition,  a  roll  of  4  does double damage, a roll of 3 does triple
     damage,  and a roll of 17 or 18 causes the attacker to drop his weapon
     (if the ready weapon is a hand weapon). 








                                                                     PAGE 36

     Dice Odds

     A  test  was  done that involved duplicating the Gladiator die rolling
     for  10,000  rolls and recording the results to see the odds of making
     various  agility  rolls.   The  totals of each number was kept and the
     number  of  rolls  required  to  make  a  certain  AG  "or  less" roll
     calculated.  The numbers reflect the number of rolls needed on average
     to  make  a  specific  AG roll.  For example, a 5 or less is typically
     rolled  once  every  21  throws  (3 dice).  A 7 or less is rolled once
     every  6  rolls (3 dice).  The exception to the reading method are the
     values  above  15  which  are  numbers  to  miss due to the fact 16 or
     greater  always  misses.  For example, a 16 or greater is rolled every
     23  rolls  and an 18 is rolled every 250 rolls causing the attacker to
     drop his weapon (3 dice).

     Strategy

     Who Moves First

     Wining  the choice of who moves first with the movement incentive roll
     can  be significant.  In most cases it is a good idea to let the enemy
     move first.  This allows you to 1) see their final position before you
     make  your  move  and 2) possibly run around behind them.  Choosing to
     move first is generally reserved for catching enemies that are running
     away, running away, or charging attacks. 

     Who Attacks First

     Attacks  are  in  agility  order  but you can DECLINE and wait for the
     remaining  characters  to  take  an action.  The last character in the
     "turn"  is  not  allowed to decline.  When the action turn is over the
     "declined"  characters  get to take actions in agility order.  This is
     sometimes  desirable to see what the other characters do, or to ensure
     that a possible daze or knock down will carry over into next turn. 

     Evading

     Each  character  may act only once each turn and will typically act in
     adjusted AG order as stated above.  The exception to this is the evade
     action.   A character that is attacked may make a preemptive action to
     evade.   In  other words, any character that has not yet acted will be
     able  to  evade  if  he  is  capable  of  evading  (movement and prone
     restrictions)  at  any time he is attacked and he wishes to do so.  If
     he  chooses  to evade his action is "spent" and he will not be able to
     take  other action.  Evading is a good idea when you are the target of
     a pole arm  double  damage  attack  (impale  or  receive  charge enemy
     actions).  Evading can also be used to charge through enemy bow shots. 

     Missiles

     Higher  AG types are more effective with missiles as range and evasion
     can  have  a  dramatic effect on the success of a missile attack.  The
     range  penalty  for  bows  is -1 per 5 squares.  The range penalty for
     thrown  weapons  is -1 per square.  In addition thrown weapon range is
     limited to your SH in squares. 

     Using a arrow type bow weapon is simple...  stand and shoot as long as
     possible.   Shuffle and switch weapons to a hand weapon that does your
     maximum  SH bracket damage when the enemy is within charging distance.
     Arrows can be used against an enemy at any distance effectively but do
     less damage than hand weapons in the same SH bracket. 








                                                                     PAGE 38

     Crossbows  do  reasonable damage but have to be reloaded and can leave
     the  user  foolishly  reloading  or  changing  weapons  when the enemy
     attacks.   Careful  planning  and  luck  are  needed to use a crossbow
     effectively.   Generally, a character will only have time for one shot
     with  a  crossbow and will not take the time to reload it.  If this is
     true the character will probably want to charge and go prone the first
     turn  to  close  with  the  enemy and get the +2 "to hit" AG bonus for
     firing  a  crossbow prone.  The character will then spend the next two
     turns  after firing standing and changing weapons.  When the character
     is  ready  to attack with his hand weapon the enemy has had a total of
     four  turns  to  close  the  distance and attack.  Crossbows cannot be
     relied  on  and  will  only  occasionally  hit.   That hit however can
     deliver a telling blow and will help decide the fate of the combat. 

     Thrown  weapons are a dubious proposition indeed.  These are generally
     reserved  for disengaging enemies who keep stepping back before we can
     get  a  swing in.  Two squares is about as far away as you want to get
     with a thrown weapon.  In addition, throwing a weapon can leave you in
     a  bad  way  if  you  have  no  secondary or slung one-handed weapons.
     Throwing  will automatically ready a one-handed non-shield weapon from
     top  "slung",  bottom "slung", and the "also" weapon, in that order of
     precedence.   If no weapons are left then the attacker will have to go
     pick something up.  If only two-handed weapons or shields are left the
     attacker  will have to take a turn to change weapons or pick something
     up.  The attacker of course can always duke it out with fists but this
     is  only effective for very high SH types (SH=17 fist does 1d+2, SH=11
     or less does 1d-4). 

     Hand Combat

     When  an  enemy  can  be  attacked and the character moved none or one
     square  (WAIT  or  SHIFT)  then  "try hand combat" is an option.  Hand
     Combat is when two or more enemy characters are battling it out on the
     ground  with fists or daggers.  The prone bonus of +4 to hit is gained
     so  all attacks are likely to hit (except in extremely poor AG cases).
     In addition, all damage inflicted is +3 points of damage.  Hand Combat
     tends  to  do more damage in less time to both parties than in regular
     combat.   Getting  into  hand  combat  with  a creature is generally a
     mistake,  especially  with  a bear.  The bear will miss often swinging
     from  a  distance but he will likely tear your face off the first time
     he attacks in Hand Combat. 














                                                                     PAGE 39

     Hand Combat Attempt

     This  option  will always check to see if the opponent will repel you.
     The enemy may also choose not to repel you (in which case you may have
     made  a  mistake).   If  he does attempt to repel you, he will have to
     roll  his AG or less on three dice with the additional modifier of the
     difference  of his and your strengths.  For example, "Thor" SH:16 AG:8
     "June" SH:10 AG:14.  Thor trys Hand Combat with June.  June chooses to
     repel  and  has  to  roll  a 14-(16-10) or 14-6 or 8 or less.  If June
     attempted  Hand  Combat  with  Thor  then  Thor  would have to roll an
     8-(10-16)  or  8+6  or 14 or less.  The ability to enter or repel Hand
     Combat  is  heavily biased toward the strong.  Bears often prefer Hand
     Combat  and there is little humans can do to keep them off.  The repel
     check  does  not  cost  the enemy his action and the enemy may attack,
     evade,  or disengage in the same turn Hand Combat was started.  In the
     event  that  you  come  on the opponent from the side or the rear, the
     facing  bonus  to  hit  is  applied  (+2 from the side and +3 from the
     rear).  The bonus is applied as a penalty to the opponents repel roll.
     A hand combat attempt is automatic if the defender is already prone. 

     Hand Combat Weapons

     When  Hand  Combat  is successful the attacker as well as the defender
     drop  any  weapons  they  have in their ready or secondary hands.  The
     exception  to  this  is  the dagger, which is kept.  In addition, if a
     dagger  is slung it will be readied.  It is important then to remember
     if  your  strength  gives  you greater damage when using a fist than a
     dagger,  DO  NOT  carry  a  dagger.   It  will  jump  into  your  hand
     irritatingly whenever someone enters Hand Combat with you.

        SH                Fist Damage       Dagger Damage      Use
       ----              -------------     ---------------    ------
        11 or less          1d-4                .             dagger
        12                  1d-3                .             dagger
        13                  1d-2                .             dagger

        15                  1d                  .             fist
        16                  1d+1                .             fist
        17 or more          1d+2                .             fist

     Remember that damage in Hand Combat has 3 added to the above values. 

     Hand Combat Disengage

     This option is available during Hand Combat when  the character has
     not moved or evaded.  The character will successfully  disengage on
     a roll  of  his AG or less.   If successful, the disengaging player
     will be able to stand up in an adjacent square. 







                                                                     PAGE 40

     Pole Arms

     These  do  less apparent damage than other weapons if you consider the
     weapons  chart alone.  In actuality the pole arms allow a character to
     do  more  damage  in a single hit than any other type of weapon in the
     same  SH bracket.  This is possible with the IMPALE and RECEIVE_CHARGE
     actions which do double damage.  On the other hand, the character will
     have  to  be  particularly  sly to take advantage of the double damage
     attacks  on  a  regular basis.  He will have to disengage often to get
     charging  room  or  disengage  and run so the enemy charges after him.
     The  latter is more desirable as standing to receive a charge (a shift
     move)  not  only  does  double damage but gets a +2 "to hit" AG bonus.
     Note  also  that  the  larger pole arms  can attack an opponent from a
     distance  of  two  squares.   This  aids  the  "hit  and run" pole arm
     strategy, making a very potent combination. 

     Shield Attacks

     Shields can be used to damage an opponent and/or knock him down.  If a
     shield hits it does damage to the defender (see the weapons table) and
     the  defender  has  to  roll  to  keep from falling down.  The roll is
     against  the defender's AG just like an attack roll but is adjusted by
     the  difference  in  strengths  of  the attacker and defender.  If the
     attacker is 2 SH stronger than the defender then the defender has a -2
     AG  penalty.   If  the  attacker  is 1 SH weaker than the defender the
     defender  has  a  +1  AG  bonus  when  rolling  to  keep standing.  In
     addition, a shield rush (a shield only attack from a charge) gets a +2
     AG  "to  hit"  bonus  for  the attacker to hit with the shield and the
     defender  gets  a  -2  AG  penalty when rolling to keep standing.  The
     attacker  gets  to  move  the  defender one square (like a shift move)
     indicating  the  direction of the desired push.  If the defender falls
     down  he will fall down in that square.  If not, the defender stays in
     his original square.  Knocking down an opponent is useful in two cases
     in  particular.   1)  Gang attack scenario...  one attacker knocks the
     defender  down  and other attackers pummel the prone defender at +4 AG
     "to hit".  2) Forced retreat scenario...  the attacker uses the shield
     push to land the defender on inhospitable terrain...  a fire or a pit.
     This  is  the only way someone can get into a pit (see Terrain for pit
     damage). 
















                                                                     PAGE 41

     Dual Attacks

     The  "Dual  Attack"  option  is  available  when  you  do  not  have a
     two-handed  weapon ready and you can attack.  The second weapon attack
     is  the "also ready" weapon which is a weapon, a shield, or a fist (no
     weapon  in  hand).   This is generally the only way to use a shield to
     attack  besides doing a shield rush.  This is a way for a high AG type
     "black  belt"  to do a good bit of damage in a single turn.  The first
     attack of a dual attack (which is the main weapon "ready") has a -2 AG
     penalty  to  hit.   The  second  attack of a dual attack (which is the
     second  weapon  "also ready") has a -3 AG penalty to hit.  This method
     is  not to be used by low AG type "barbarians" unless they are getting
     a  facing bonus such as attacking the defender from the rear.  Also to
     be  avoided  against  creatures  that  do  not  have enough SH left to
     warrant  both  weapons.  Of course, this is only an issue provided the
     difference between a single attack and a dual attack is the difference
     between  maybe  hitting  (10  or  less)  and missing twice (7 and 6 or
     less).   If  the  AG  is reduced to 5 or less the attacker may as well
     dual  attack  due to the fact the AG penalties are nullified by the "5
     or less always hits" limit.

                     |      KHAN the HUN        |
                     `--------------------------'
     Human     SH:  11        AR:  - / -          Long Bow  1d+1
               AG:  13                            Spear     1d+1
               MP:  10                            Dagger    1d-1

     Hit and run tactics.  Shoot from afar as long as possible, switch
     to spear when  the  enemy closes.  Stand and receive enemy charge
     or charge enemy for double damage with spear.  Disengage enemy to
     get  distance  for  another charge.  Continue  spear  charge  and
     disengage in alternating turns.  Moving  first  after disengaging
     is the key to success  because  Khan must move at least 2 squares
     (back up then charge forward) to  get the  double damage pole arm
     bonus.  This will  not be  possible if the enemy moves  first and
     steps forward one to engage Khan again. 

















                                                                     PAGE 42

     Khan as an Orc...
               SH:  11        AR:  1 / 1          Spear     1d+1
               AG:  12                            Long Bow  1d+1
               MP:  10                            Dagger    1d-1

     Emphasize the  spear attack as the reduced agility will  make the
     bow tactic suffer.  Natural armor supports this also.

     Khan as an Elf...
               SH:  11        AR:  - / -          Long Bow  1d+1+1
               AG:  12(13)                        Spear     1d+1
               MP:  12                            Dagger    1d-1

     Emphasize  bow  attack.  If  the enemy  is  slow  enough consider
     running from arena side to arena side to keep out of  engagement.
     If the enemy is in plate mail and his MP is 6, running across the
     arena will leave Khan two turns to fire before  the enemy catches
     up.  In addition, avoiding  the spear will  make an Elven Khan as
     good as a Human one as far as AG and better in terms of damage. 

     Khan as a Goblin...
               SH:  7         AR:  - / -          Long Bow  1d+1
               AG:  12                            Spear     1d+1
               MP:  10                            Dagger    1d-1

     Stick  with the bow and  don't  risk  closing  with the enemy (in
     other words, don't get hit).  Evade  when attacked.  Winning your
     first  combat will likely  advance the Goblin Khan  a point of SH
     and  AG at  once.  At  this  point  he could  have  a variety  of
     options...

          1.   Get a flail instead of the spear.  No x2 pole arm damage
               but it negates  an  opponents  shield.  Wear a  leather
               tunic to help fend off the opponents blows.
          2.   Get a crossbow in place of the  dagger.  Fire once then
               switch back to the long bow. 

                      .--------------------------.
                      |   SLAYER the GLADIATOR   |
                      `--------------------------'
     Human     SH:  10        AR:  1 / -          Trident        1d
               AG:  14                            Buckler        1d-3
               MP:  10                            Dagger         1d-1

     In and  out  charge attacks.  Similar  to  Khan when  he uses his
     spear but able to make up for the lack  of double damage on turns
     when  the enemy gets to move first  by making a  dual attack.  In
     addition, the shield  attack  will occasionally knock an opponent
     down and possibly into a fire or a pit (see SHIELD RUSH).  Slayer
     is better  equipped to  handle  close  fighting  as the  shield's
     protection  will  make Slayer's SH  look  inflated by  one  point
     every hit when compared to Khan in the same situation.

     Slayer as an Orc...
               SH:  10        AR:  2 / 1          Trident        1d
               AG:  13                            Buckler        1d-3
               MP:  10                            Dagger         1d-1

     The Orc's  natural armor  will make the Orc Slayer  better than a
     Human one if the incoming attacks are many and light damage (such
     as another Slayer character as an enemy). 

                      .--------------------------.
                      |     GIMLI the DWARF      |
                      `--------------------------'
     Dwarf     SH:  14        AR:  - / -          Battle Axe     2d+2+1
               AG:  9 (10)                        Battle Axe     2d+2+1
               MP:  8                             Battle Axe     2d+2+1

     Three Battle Axes?  That's because  a dwarf gets +1 to hit and +1
     damage with hammers and  axes even if they  are thrown.  So don't
     be afraid to SHUFFLE / THROW one turn and SHIFT / TRY-HAND-COMBAT
     the next.  With a  SH of 14 Gimli's fists are as good as daggers.
     He can  dual attack in Hand  Combat  with AG: 11 and  AG: 10  for
     1d-1+3 or 1d+2 per fist (2d+4 per turn if he gets lucky). 

                      .--------------------------.
                      |   THUNDAR the BARBARIAN  |
                      `--------------------------'
     Human     SH:  13        AR:  3 / -          Morning Star   2d
               AG:  11(10)                        Large Shield
               MP:  10                            Dagger         1d-1

     Thundar is  a gladiator  killer.  He  likes  to  close  with weak
     shield carrying types.  The  morning  star negates the effect  of
     the enemy shield  and the  resulting  damage can knock the  enemy
     down  spelling  his  doom.  He  also  likes to  shield rush  weak
     enemies or weak  creatures into pits and  fire.  Thundar  CHARGEs
     Slayer and does a  SHIELD-RUSH...  AG:  12  or less to hit, if he
     hits Slayer has  to roll an 8 or less to  stay upright and out of
     the pit. 

















                                                                     PAGE 44

     Hi-Scores

     The  high  scores  listing  shows  the  characters in order of highest
     experience  points.   The  character  name  and current attributes are
     shown.  Additional columns show if the character has been killed (RIP)
     or how long the character has been without playing a game (relative to
     the  other  characters  that  played last).  The high scores list will
     drop  characters  who have a "games rested" count of 50 or more.  This
     allows  characters  that  go into retirement to fade from the picture.
     In  addition,  characters that have "break outs" are exempt from being
     included in the high scores list.  A "break out" happens when a player
     does  not  complete a game (such as quitting).  This could also happen
     if  you save a game and start another with the character who is in the
     saved  game.   Be  sure and finish any saved games before starting new
     ones unless you are absolutely sure the characters you will use in the
     new  game  are not in the saved game.  The break out status shows as a
     "B#" in the right margin of a character's stats.  If you wish to reset
     the  break  out  status on a character, look for an extra text file in
     the "Gladiator!" directory for instructions. 

     Cheats!

     With  a little experience with Gladiator, you will certainly learn how
     to  succeed.   If  you  are  not  patient, then read the following for
     a recipe that will ensure victory (sounds like cheating, doesn't it?).

     For starters:

     Make a Goblin with Agility 13 and the biggest single handed weapons he
     can carry (four Axes would be perfect).  Make a couple of snakes.  Use
     the snakes to tie up the enemy while you charge around behind them and
     dual  attack.   Stay safe and disengage to keep from getting hit if an
     enemy  manages  to  face  you.  When starting the turn adjacent to the
     enemy,  move first to back away.  When starting the turn away from the
     enemy,  let  the enemy move first and charge in behind them.  Have any
     snake  that  is  attacked  evade.  Goblins advance so quickly that you
     will  be  able  to  carry bigger axes and have a greater agility after
     winning your first battle.  Repeat this strategy for one more battle. 

     To get ready for bigger things:

     You  will  need  a  Mage  to help your Goblin do battle with the truly
     nasty  things (Evil Magi).   Make a mage, set his SH to 9, his agility
     to  13,  and  his  IQ to 10.  Load him up with staffs.  Get the spells
     "Illus.   Wolf"  and "Snake Staff" in addition to any others you want.
     Keep  using  "Illus.  Wolf" until you run out of SH for the spell.  By
     this  time  you  should  have  a  pack  of wolves.  Beware of Imps and
     Slayers,  as  they can disbelieve.  If this happens, either wait until
     they  are  close (they rather fight than disbelieve, usually), or make
     snakes  to  cover  a  retreat to the exit.  Repeat this strategy until
     Slayers and Imps keep showing up.

     Teaming up:

     When  you team up your Goblin and Mage you will probably be seeing one
     or  more Behemoths.  These you treat with respect.  Load up the Goblin
     with a big slashing weapon, a big pole arm, and a bow.  Start the game
     with the Goblin shooting the bow and the Mage making wolves or snakes.
     If  a  Behemoth shows, have the Goblin switch to the pole arm when the
     Behemoth  gets half way to you.  If not, have the Goblin switch to the
     slashing  weapon  when they get close.  Have your Mage put magic armor
     on  the Goblin if the Goblin is going to be slashing.  Do not engage a
     Behemoth:  use the pole arm to impale him from two squares distance.
