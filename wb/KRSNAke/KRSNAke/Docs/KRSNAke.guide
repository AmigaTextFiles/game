                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                            Version 2, June 1991
     
      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                               675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     
                                 Preamble
     
       The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
     License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
     software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
     General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
     Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
     using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
     the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
     your programs, too.
     
       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
     if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
     in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
     
       To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
     anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
     These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
     distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
     
       For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
     gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
     you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
     source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
     rights.
     
       We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
     (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
     distribute and/or modify the software.
     
       Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
     software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
     that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
     authors' reputations.
     
       Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
     patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
     program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
     program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
     patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
     
       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.
     
                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
     
       0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
     a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
     refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
     means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
     that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
     either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
     language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
     the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
     
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
     is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
     Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
     Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
     
       1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
     and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
     along with the Program.
     
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
     
       2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
     
         a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     
         b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
         whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
         part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
         parties under the terms of this License.
     
         c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
         when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
         interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
         announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
         notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
         a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
         these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
         License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
         does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
         the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
     
     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
     
     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
     collective works based on the Program.
     
     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
     the scope of this License.
     
       3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
     
         a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
         source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
         1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
     
         b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
         years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
         cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
         machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
         distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
         customarily used for software interchange; or,
     
         c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
         to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
         allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
         received the program in object code or executable form with such
         an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
     
     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
     code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
     special exception, the source code distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
     operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
     itself accompanies the executable.
     
     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
     
       4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
     However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
     this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
     parties remain in full compliance.
     
       5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Program or works based on it.
     
       6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
     these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.
     
       7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
     
     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
     any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
     apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
     circumstances.
     
     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
     integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
     to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
     impose that choice.
     
     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
     be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     
       8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
     may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
     those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
     countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
     the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
     
       9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
     of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.
     
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
     later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
     either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
     this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
     Foundation.
     
       10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
     to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
     Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
     make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
     of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
     of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
     
                                 NO WARRANTY
     
       11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
     FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
     OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
     
       12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
     INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
     OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
     TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
     
                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     
             Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
     
       If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
     
       To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
     
         <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
         Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
     
         This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
         it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
         the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
         (at your option) any later version.
     
         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
         GNU General Public License for more details.
     
         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
         along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
         Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
     
     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
     
     If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
     when it starts in an interactive mode:
     
         Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
         Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
         This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
         under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
     
     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
     parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
     be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
     mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
     
     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
     school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
     necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
     
       Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
       `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
       <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
       Ty Coon, President of Vice
     
     This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
     proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
     consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
     library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
     Public License instead of this License.

Introduction
************

     *snake* /sneik/ *n* *1* any of various types of long, legless
     crawling reptile, some of which are poisonous.
                               - `Oxford Dictionary of Current English'

   Arjuna was surprised.

KRSNAke - the definition
========================

   "KRSNAke" can be considered one of a number of things.  If you strip
away the philosophical considerations and the fancy evasions of the
thruth about the matter, I suppose you could call it a game.  However,
for the sake of argument, let us say that "KRSNAke" is not justified by
the simple definition "game" and the negative associations this word
generates in intellectual circles.  Indeed, given enough ingenuity, one
could quite possibly argue that "KRSNAke" can be anything whatsoever,
including a cabbage.

   This is, however, not the point I desired to make.  While the
question of "KRSNAke"'s vegetable status may well give rise to terrible
philosophic strife, factionism, and eventual Hegelian compromise, I
would rather prefer to focus on the therapeutic abilities of said
ophidian.  This would seem a revolutionary and, indeed, outrageously
pointless approach to the military men and CIA directors of our age,
but, knowing full well that I face ostracism and possibly even
persecution, I wish to direct the world's attention to the virtues of
this wonderful legless vertebrate.

   Or perhaps, on second thought, I won't.  Suffice to say that playing
KRSNAke is a worthwhile pursuit given the fact that more pointless
things, like existence, have been known to happen.

   There are religious issues as well concerning this scaly animal.  For
the judeo-christian tradition, in particular, the snake possesses a
special meaning.  If you are a devout Jew or Christian and worry about
playing a game where a snake plays the leading role, don't worry.  You
don't have to play a snake.  You can play anything your mind could
conceive, from an earthworm (which is included in the distribution) to
a field of static (which you will have to design yourself) or a giant
penis (in which case it might be wise for you to see your
psychiatrist).  For further debate on the subject of snakes and
religion, refer to the "KRSNAke Web page", of which you will find more
information below.

The KRSNAke Web page
====================

   If you really want to read in-depth about advanced ophiolatry, you
can check the "KRSNAke home page" (where you can also get the latest
beta version of the legless reptile). (1)

Hegel
=====

   Suppose you claim that the snake must be an animal, because if it
needs to eat, it demonstrates a lack of photosynthetic ability.
Consider this the original thesis.

   Then suppose I claim that the snake must, on the contrary, be a
vegetable, because some species of snake are demonstrably green of hue,
indicating the presence of chlorophyl, and that the consumption of
edibles is meant only to throw us off the track.  Consider this the
antithesis.

   There is immense debate around this issue, especially given that both
arguments seem entirely valid(2).  Two warring schools of thought
develop, and people are generally very upset about the question. (3)

   Well, according to this fine fellow Hegel, eventually there will be a
synthesis of these two ideas, meaning that the snake is believed to be
*both an animal and a vegetable at the same time*.  Now isn't that
awfully nice?  A perversion of philosophy, perhaps, but it certainly
makes people get along better.  And after all, that's what philosophy
really is all about. (4)

beta version will be available at this site, or indeed that there will
*be* a new beta version. I do, in fact, have better things to waste my
pointless life on than a snake with a fruit fixation. You are hereby

*very* valid. Trust me on this.

Clients
*******

   "Clients" are programs that work in cooperation with "KRSNAke" to
provide the user with extended functionality or additional information.
"KRSNAke" is the "server" in this connection, and the clients
basically receive various types of information from "KRSNAke", which
they may choose either to ignore or to act upon in a given way, usually
defining the function of the given client.

   When KRSNAke starts, it looks for a subdirectory called `Clients' in
its home directory.  All files found in this directory will be
launched.  If they are KRSNAke clients, they should attach themselves
to KRSNAke and function as they're expected to.  If they're other
programs, they'll be started too - but generally you shouldn't put
anything besides KRSNAke clients in the "Clients" directory.

   At present, there are two KRSNAke clients available; the `Hall of
Fame' and the `Action Replay'.  The former records high scores, the
latter records games for subsequent replay.  See their individual
descriptions for more details.


Available clients

 @{" Hall of Fame " Link "Hall of Fame"}                   High scores

@EndNode

@Toc "Clients"

The Hall of Fame
================

   This client keeps track of high scores.  Each player has only one
entry - this is contrary to most high score tables, but as the Hall of
Fame can handle an unlimited number of entries, this helps cut back a
little on the table size.

   The default name offered the player the first time the Hall of Fame
registers a high score is taken from the system variable USER.
"MultiUserFileSystem" and similar applications usually maintain this
variable.  If it is not present, the "Hall of Fame" reverts to
`Crassus'.  The default name is stored in the snapshot file whenever
the "Hall of Fame" exits, and the name stored here is used if it exists.

   If you're intimidated by the default entries, being such
conspiratorial characters as Templars, Masons and Rosicrucians, you can
replace the file `ENVARC:KRSNAke/HallOfFame.data' with an empty file,
and you'll have a blank Hall of Fame.  But really, that's being rather
paranoid.

The Action Replay
=================

   This client records your games and lets you replay them at any speed.
Use the keyboard to control it; when the "Action Replay" window is
active, press the `R' key to begin the replay (even if you're still
playing; though it's a good idea to pause the game before doing this
...).  Press a numeric key to adjust the speed - as you'd do with
"KRSNAke" itself.  When replaying, you can press `SPACE' to abort.

   Eventually you can load and save replays.  At present, I haven't even
begun programming this.  Don't hold your breath for it unless you can
survive for indefinite periods without air.

Sounds
******

   "KRSNAke" can be set to play given sounds with given events.  At
present, these events are at the start of each game, each time the
snake eats a fruit, and when it crashes or bites itself.

   I think I ought to mention what kinds of sounds can be played by
"KRSNAke".  At present, it supports any sounds you've installed
"datatypes" for, "ProTracker" modules (through `protracker.library'),
"MED/OctaMED" modules (only 4-channel, through `medplayer.library'),
"Player 6.1" modules (with "P61A" headers only, through
`player61.library'), and "PlaySID" modules (only one-file, through
`playsid.library').  With the exception of `protracker.library' and
`player61.library', these libraries are not included in the "KRSNAke"
distribution, mostly for the purpose of evading any legal action
resulting from possible copyright infringements, but also because it's
really fun to turn the AmiNet upside down trying to locate them.  (You
don't think so?)

Graphics
********

   Does a snake have to be a snake?

System pens
===========

   In KRSNAke, you can define several ways of rendering the snake and
its surroundings.  The default method is by using the appropriate
system pens.  This produces an exceedingly dull but completely
compatible set of blocks meant to symbolise a snake.

RGB colours
===========

   Number two, moving up on the complexity ladder, is where you pick an
RGB colour from the 16.8 million colours available on the Amiga.  The
result is, essentially, more colourful dull blocks.

Datatypes
=========

   Then there is the datatypes option.  Here you select a graphic image,
which can be in any format you possess datatypes for, which will be
rendered inside the dull blocks or as the background.  For the
background, this will probably be the most interesting option - and
besides, this is as high as it goes for the background.

KRSNAke graphics
================

   Finally there is the big one.  For the snake itself, and for the
fruits (or whatever you want them to represent), you can choose special
graphic images that will be scaled and remapped to fit your playing
area, and that will, more importantly, *not* be dull blocks.  These
graphics must conform to certain specifications (see
@{"Designing Graphics" Link "Designing Graphics"}), but are really very flexible, and above all, very
*attractive*.

Designing Graphics
==================

   Generally, you'd be well advised to sit down and create your own set
of graphics for the "KRSNAke" game.  Given my own skills as an artist,
the graphics accompanying the distribution are somewhat lacking.

   And before I say anything else, I have to mention the *number one
restriction*.  This is that *all KRSNAke graphic files must be IFF ILBM
files with a CMAP chunk*.  Fair enough?  Anything else will fail to
load.  You should also be aware that "KRSNAke" sometimes needs to write
to these files, so they should not exist on a read-only medium, like a
CD.

   There are two types of graphics, the snake and the fruit. The fruit
is the easiest to create - this is simply a picture of whatever fruit
you're implementing.  It will be scaled and remapped to fit into a
block in the playing field.  The block size is displayed in "KRSNAke"'s
status bar immediately after loading. The fruit file name must end in
`.f1', to identify it as a fruit file.

   Then there is the snake.  This is a lot more complex.  The snake
graphic consists of twenty consecutive images, each of the same size,
one beneath the other.  They will be remapped and scaled just as the
fruit graphics. The snake file name must end in `.s1', and the order of
the images is as follows, with `*' representing the part of the image
moving in the forward direction, and `-' representing any other part of
the snake.  I hope you get the picture - if you don't, try looking at
the included snake graphics.

   Here goes:

ARexx commands
**************

   I'll be brief about this, as you can really only write rather silly
scripts for "KRSNAke" anyway.

`UP'
     tells the snake to move upwards

`DOWN'
     what you'd expect

`LEFT'
     ditto

`RIGHT'
     ditto

`QUIT'
     exits KRSNAke

`NEWGAME'
     starts a new game if no game is playing

`VERSION'
     returns the version string

`HIDE'
     hides KRSNAke

`SHOW'
     shows KRSNAke

`WAIT FOR n'
     waits n snake moves

`WAIT UNTIL X n'
     wait until snake reaches x position n

`WAIT UNTIL Y n'
     wait until snake reaches y position n

`SET SPEED n'
     sets the speed to n

`GET LENGTH'
     returns the snake's length

`GET PLAYING'
     returns 1 if a game is playing, 0 otherwise

`PAUSE'
     pauses the game (a move resumes)

`GET HEAD X'
     returns the x pos of the head

`GET HEAD Y'
     same with y pos

`GET FRUIT X'
     returns the x pos of the current fruit

`GET FRUIT Y'
     you guessed it

`CHECK X Y'
     returns 1 if (x,y) is occupied by the snake, 0 otherwise

   That's all. Check out the example script for an example.

The Plot
********

   You are a snake. You are hungry. Eat the fruits.

   OK, so that's not a very deep plot.  But at least even a six-year-old
can understand it.  And everyone besides a six-year-old has played a
game like this before.  This may sound pathetically nostalgic, but I'm
of the opinion that KRSNAke is a damn sight deeper than Super Mario.
Any six-year-olds out there are welcome to disagree. Fnord.

   Sorry there's no Windows version.  We all know full well if there's
no Windows version the game isn't worth anything.  Even Doom, an
operating system in its own right, has a Windows version these days.
What a shame.

`Elvis Masterminds All Computer Snakes'), but I found out someone has
already made a program by that name.  It's just a text editor.  What a

Bugs

   Well, I suppose it happens even in the best of families...

   * KRSNAke is not too thrilled about the Picasso II card, and quite
     possibly about other graphics boards as well, though it's yet only
     been tested on the Picasso II. We haven't been able to pin this
     bug down yet, but it appears that after a while of playing KRSNAke
     on a Picasso screen, *something* locks up the machine.  I wish I
     knew what it was - I suspect the ActionReplay, but I don't
     actually know yet. This is a priority, though - I'll get down to
     fixing it as soon as possible.

   * Also, the ActionReplay client isn't too stable - or perhaps it's
     the krsnake.library, who's to say... Anyway, ActionReplay is to be
     used with caution. Well, it works most of the time, but sometimes
     it just goes and crashes.

   Now that was very helpful, wasn't it? Fnord. Well, if *you* can find
a bug, mail us and we'll put your *very own bug* on this list! Lucky
you... If you're *really* lucky I might even *fix* the bug!

Future
******

   The future will be KRSNAke 2.0 the BOOPSI gadget. Well, perhaps.
That's an idea I had anyway... What will definitely be implemented is a
very advanced multiplayer mode - play against a friend on your machine,
against a friend over a serial, parallel or network link, or against
one of several computer AI routines. And possibly several modes of
play, like a snake that shrinks when it grows hungry, or fruits that
disappear after a while, or what have you.

   And of course I'll probably code it all from scratch again,
introducing a whole ecosystem of new bugs and inadequacies. But aside
from that, it should prove to be an interesting experience, both for me
as the programmer and you as the player. Now if I could only get
started...

*********************

   I myself is a bit hard to reach by email right now, as I'm about to
get myself a new account, and I don't currently have one that's usable.
So if you want to get in touch with me by email, you should write to
one of my friends and ask them to forward the mail to me.  The
addresses you can try are as follows:

   * morsteen@login.eunet.no (might not be valid for long, but likely
     the fastest)

   * kurtro@login.eunet.no

   * arildsat@stud.unit.no (will be valid for a long time, but try the
     other ones first)

   If you want to punish yourself, or if you don't have access to the
Internet, you can write me a letter and snail-mail it to me, in which
case you would write to:

        Petter E. Stokke
        Kaptein Bothners gate 18
        N-6500 KRISTIANSUND
        Norway

   Or, if you have money to throw around, or just happens to live
somewhere nearby, you could phone me at +47-71672107 (chances are
you'll be talking to someone who thinks English is a type of small
furry animal, but if you keep asking for me you'll undoubtedly get
through).

   Finally, there's the KRSNAke support BBS. You can reach this by
dialling +47-71671605, and it is called Boss BBS. Join the KRSNAke
conference on this board and drop me a line.

   And, although by this time it's rather a bit of a cobweb site,
there's always the KRSNAke Home Page (I promise I'll update it *real
soon now*):

         http://login.eunet.no/~morsteen/krsnake/

   Now if that's not enough information for you to get hold of me, it's
certainly not my fault!
