presents DOORS

Creative Computing Morristown, New Jersey the USA

In this cute little game, there are four doors in succession and you must open them to get the prize behind the last one.
You have a key ring containing 10 keys numbered 1 to 10 and you have 13 tries to open all four doors.

As an added hooker, some keys may open more than one door.
If at first you do not succeed try, try again.
The prizes behind the fourth door are well worth the patience in trying to get them all open.

Doors was conceived and written by Bill Ingram.
The today 2012 graphic version was done by KeHo Software. The game is still Freeware.

How do I play this game ?

After starting and drawing the game screen - press the big blue button to start a new game.
Now - in the first round you must open door 1 at first.

Press any key you think this is the right one.

A selected key goes on status

- red condition, if the key can not open this door
- yellow condition, if this key can open another door
- green condition, the door opens and you are in the next round.

If it was the last door (4) - oh happy day - you really made it !

If the key was wrong - I show you a short failure text and you have to select another one.
You failed - if you need more than 13 tries !

Good luck my friend..
