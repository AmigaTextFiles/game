                               @{b}1.1 Idea
                              ==========@{ub}


 The basic idea of  Hexagons is very similar  to that of the  wellknown game
 Tetris. So it's unnecessary  to describe the games principle in detail. You
 have to place downfalling pieces skilfully, by shifting  them left or right
 and rotate them, so that they completely fill the floor of your  playfield.
 Every  complete line in the playfield  will be removed immediately, so that
 the  pieces  above can  succeed. The  more  pieces you  can place, the more 
 @{" points " link scoring} you'll get.

 After Tetris was getting boring  even in it's fastest  level, and even it's
 three-dimensional  version was too easy, we decided  to convert  this games
 principle  to a  hexagonal  playfield. We kept the  number of  single parts
 (four) each  piece  consists of, but  there  are now 10  different  pieces,
 because of the hexagonal structure, instead  of the 7 wellknown of  Tetris.
 Of course, the rotation angle is  now 60 degrees, which makes the game much
 more  difficult, because it  differs  from  the usual  rectilinear  view of
 things.

 In other words: Hexagons is a game for all these, who get boring by playing
 Tetris. But you shouldn't  expect to get @{" top-scores " link scoring} at once, even if  you
 are a Tetris-wizard.

    Arranged         -  Each piece has its own, invariable  colour. If there
                        are less  than 10 colours  available, Hexagons  uses 
                        ordered dithering to create additional colours.

    Random           -  The colour for each piece is choosen randomly.

                            =============@{ub}

  1. For each wellplaced piece you'll get a level-specific amount of points.
     The higher the level is, the more points you'll get.

  2. For each  completed  line you'll get a  relative high amount of points.
     If you complete two lines at the same time, the amount will be twice as
     high. For three completed lines, the amount will be four times, and for
     four  lines (Wow !!) it'll  be eight times of the  original value. Even 
     here the scoring is level dependant.

  3. If you  don't use the @{" Preview " link prefs} option, you'll  get three  times of the
     basic amount of points for each dropped piece.

  4. If the @{" Random-Color-Mode " link prefs} is  active  you'll get twice as  many points
     for each dropped piece.

  5. Deactivated @{" Preview " link prefs} and  activated @{" Random-Color-Mode " link prefs} will result in
     a four times scoring.

  6. For each line, a piece is pulled  down (or dropped) with the SPACE-Key,
     you'll get extra points.

    The statistics-window informs you, how often each hexagon appears during
    the game. You can choose between a statistic since the last start of the
    program and an  all-time-statistic. Moreover you can  choose between the
    normal and the extended hexagon set. The percentage  values are  rounded,
    so their sum may be unequal to 100%. The  difference will be neglectable.

    Moreover there appears the number of  played games since  the last start
    of the program and the number of games ever played.

    The  statistics-window  can  stay  opened  during  the game  and will be 
    actualized permanently !!!

                 Hexagons supports the following tooltypes:

   @{b}NOLACE@{ub}     -  Hexagons uses automatically the correct aspect ratio for
                 the  selected  screenmode. If it  should use  the  wrong
                 ascpect ratio  just  for  once, you can  force  the non-
                 interlaced mode by using the tooltype NOLACE.

   @{b}ENDREQUEST@{ub} -  If this  tooltype  is  active, there  appears a  safety-
                 requester by leaving the game.

   @{b}NOJOYSTICK@{ub} -  Prevents the  reservation of the  gameport.device and so
                 the usage of a joystick.

   @{b}MAINWINDOW@{ub} -  Position of the mainwindow. You can use absolute coordi-
                 nates (e.g. MAINWINDOW=100,80)  or CENTERSCREEN. Default 
                 value is CENTERSCREEN.

   @{b}SUBWINDOWS@{ub} -  Position  of  the  different  subwindows.  You  can  use 
                 absolute  coordinates  (e.g. SUBWINDOWS=100,80), CENTER-
                 SCREEN or CENTERMAIN for centering above the  mainwindow.
                 Default  value is CENTERMAIN.

   @{b}PREFWINDOW@{ub} -  Position of the preferences window. You can use absolute
                 coordinates (e.g. PREFWINDOW=100,80),  CENTERSCREEN,  or 
                 CENTERMAIN for centering  above the  mainwindow. Default
                 value is the upper left corner.

   You can run  Hexagons on any Amiga with Kickstart >=2.04 and 512kB ChipRAM.

   A screenmode  with at  least  400 lines and  a  minimum  of  8  colours  is 
   recommended, but you  can use  any  other, even  non-interlaced, screenmode
   with 2 or 4 colours. In this case you have to make some cuts  regarding the
   graphics quality.

         Hexagons was tested with the following system configurations:

         A4000/040, AGA, Kick 3.1,  Cybervision 64, Cyberstorm060
         A4000/040, AGA, Kick 3.0,  Hardital Powerchanger 040/28MHz
