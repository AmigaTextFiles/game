| Introduction |
+--------------+@{ub}

There can be few Amiga user who have not also used a PC running
Windows 95. Those that do will be familiar with FreeCell, one of the
giveaway games. I have played FreeCell a lot on the PC but
surprisingly I have not seen a version on the Amiga - until now !

For those not familiar with FreeCell it's a card game. It is similar
to Solitaire but I prefer it because it's easier to win but requires
more skill than luck.

+---------------------+@{ub}

To fit all the cards on screen and make them look reasonable the
program opens a Hi-res Interlace screen with 16 colours.

The programs looks best if you have a multisync monitor.

It takes a fair bit of chip memory to display this screen so whilst
the program will run on an unexpanded A1200 a bit of extra memory
will help if you want to multitask.

The program will not run on my A500, I assume because of the memory
requirement.

Requires Workbench V2.0 or higher.

@NODE "Installation"
@{b}+--------------+
| Installation |
+--------------+@{ub}

FreeCell can be run from Floppy or Hard Drive.

To install simply drag the FreeCell drawer to the desired location.

Note: FreeCell will not run from a root directory, the program file
must be in a drawer.

The program saves game play statistics in the same path as the
program file so it is advisable to run the program from a write
enabled drive ( i.e. not CDROM ).

@NODE "How to Play"

The game starts with all 52 cards, arranged randomly in 8 piles.
The object of the game to rearrange the cards into 4 piles, one for
each suit, arranged in ascending order. The 4 piles are in the top
right hand corner of the screen.

In the top left hand corner are 4 'free cells' in each of which you
can place one card temporarily whilst sorting cards into their
final position.

You can also move cards between the 8 piles. However, you can only
place a card on a pile if the top card of that pile is the next card
in ascending order and of the opposite colour; exactly the same rules
as Solitaire.

Unlike Solitaire you can only move one card at a time. To save time
the program will allow you to move a pile of cards provided it would
be possible to do so using one card moves. For example, with 4 'free
cells' you can put 4 cards from one pile into the 'free cells' then
move a fifth card from the same pile to a new pile then put the
4 cards from the 'free cells' back on top of the fifth card. With 4
'free cells' the program will therefore allow you to move 5 cards to
another pile at once.

To move a card simply click on it once, drag it to a new location then
click again. To move a pile of cards click on the card that will be
at the bottom of the pile your moving, drag the pile to a new location
then click again. If you try to move a card or a pile of cards to a
location which does not obey the rules the card/cards will snap back
to their original location. If you try to pick up a pile of cards
which do not follow the rules the card you clicked on will be
displayed but not picked up.

The program will automatically move cards to their sorted positions
when it is possible to do so and when they are no longer any use to
you for sorting other cards. You can move cards to the sorted
positions yourself when they at the top of a pile or in the 'free
cells' but this is normally a desperation move !

The easy game is the same as the normal game but without the full set
of cards.

You cannot really lose with this game and so is useful for learning
the rules or for children to play.

Playing the easy game will not affect the game statistics.

If more than one person plays on the same Amiga make multiple
copies of the program in different draws and compare performance !
