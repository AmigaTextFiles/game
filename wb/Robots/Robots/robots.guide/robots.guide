@node intro "the story"
Robots.Bastards are every where taking over the earth with there pointed
sticks and there fruit, leaking there damned oil everywhere. You could take
it when they just cleaned up 'round the house and stuff but now that they've
taken over the world and killed off the human race, well, thats it. As the
last survivor of the human race your job is to reduce the scummy filthy
SMELLY IGNORANT BAAAAASTARDS TO PILES OF RUBBLE, HA HA HAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!
There is one problem though:you have no weapons and if the robots touch you
you are a dead little spiderfan. But luckily for you the robots are intensly
stupid, so you must force them to crash into each other. Then they will
die!!!
Just remember:
 there may not be anyone left alive on the earth except you and it may be
completely hopeless to even consider resisting but hey, it's your earth,
right?
@endnode
@node game "Gameplay"
robots is kind of like a war game in that it is @{"turn based" link turn}.
the robots will always move towards your possition after you've moved so
the best way to end the lives of the scum is to get them into one line and
then move lateraly across that line.
robots is pretty simple so if you do succede in getting a very high score
then you will be asked to enter your name on the score table. This signifies
your vague ability.
@endnode
@node turn "arctic?"
moving in sequence, so that you take a move and they follow.

@node furth "thankyou one and all"
- i'd just like to take this opportunity to thank my parents and colleages for a wonderful opportunity to learn about life
@endnode
@node reg "ooh you'd better register"
this program is freeware ie: it is free and you can ware it. Ohh no wait a
minute, thats not right is it? Um, oh yeah i know!! whilst it is copywrited
to stewart it is free and you can pass it around to all your friends(perhaps
have a party and put it on a plate with the cheese nibbles). But, should you
alter it (or anything else in this budget sized pack-o-fun) then we will
find you and rip off your head, just prior to sucking out your lungs.

Howeverif you'd like to send some cash then you can send it to @{"me" link dave}
.
