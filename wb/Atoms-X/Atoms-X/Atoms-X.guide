@{b}Introduction@{ub}

Atoms-X is my own take on the classic PD game Atoms. Something reminded me of Atoms a few weeks ago, so I went home and started writing my own version.
The original version was on a magazing coverdisk about 20 years ago, and I'm sure I still have that disk somewhere, but I decided it would be better to start from scratch with a modern, Workbench-compatible version which will work on OS4 as well as OS3 machines.

Atoms-X is a board game in which players take it in turn to try and eliminate the opponents and be the only player with pieces remaining on the board. Enemy pieces are taken by filling an adjacent cell with atoms until it is overfull and bursts, overflowing into the enemy's cell and taking their atoms over. This can lead to large chain reactions, often swinging the game dramatically towards to end.

@NODE "requirements" "Atoms-X - Requirements"

@{b}Requirements@{ub}

Atoms-X has the following requirements:
  - 68020 or better
  - About 1.2MB free chip RAM on AGA classics, 400k free Chip RAM on OCS/ECS classics, or 4MB on NGs or classics with graphics cards and AHI
  - AmigaOS3 or AmigaOS4

Atoms-X has been tested on the following machines and found to work fine:
  - AmigaOne XE-G4, OS4.1 update 6
  - Amiga 1200 060/66, 192MB, Voodoo 3-3000, OS3.9
  - Amiga 1200 030/50, 32MB, AGA, OS3.1 & OS3.9
  - iBook G4, MorphOS 3.3

If a graphics card isn't detected, the user can choose a screenmode when Atoms-X starts.

AHI is used for sound effects, but if it's not found, reduced-quality sound is used instead through the standard classic chipset.

@{b}Installation@{ub}

Atoms-X doesn't really need "installation" - just unpack it and put the drawer wherever you want it. And if you're reading this you've already sorted out the first bit!

Alternative icons (OS4 32-bit and NewIcons) are included as well if you'd prefer to use either of those... Just copy over the icon if you like.

Many thanks to Stellan Pistoor for his NewIcons!

If someone would like to send me alternative icons to include for any OS, feel free to @{"contact me!" LINK "aboutme"}

@{b}Starting Atoms-X@{ub}

Launching Atoms-X for the first time on a classic will give you a screenmode requester. Pick a screenmode and the appropriate graphics will be loaded. Please note, the high-resolution modes (anything 640x480 or above) will not work on OCS/ECS machines. If you select this, you'll get an error message, but re-run Atoms-X and you can pick again.

If a valid screenmode is selected, it will be saved in the @{"Tooltypes" LINK "tooltypes"} of the Atoms-X icon and you won't be asked again. If you do need to change the screenmode later on, you can either delete the NATIVESCREENMODE Tooltype, or hold down shift as Atoms-X starts and you'll be given the screenmode requester again.

On systems with a graphics card, no requester will be shown, and the game window will just open on the Workbench screen.

There are some extra configuration options available via Tooltypes in the Atoms-X icon - see @{"Tooltypes" LINK "tooltypes"} for more information.

@{b}Playing@{ub}

The Atoms-X start window allows you to choose various parameters for your game. Tick the checkbox beside any players you want to participate. Any combination is valid so long as you pick at least two! You can edit their names or leave the defaults, and you can alter the type of player, picking from "Human" and three different computer components ranging from easy to hard.

The speed of the explosion animations can be controlled with the "Low Speed" or "High Speed" options. On high-end Amigas, the "Low Speed" option should be fine, but classics with native graphics might benefit from the "High Speed" option.

On RTG systems the graphics size can be changed using the graphics size cycle gadget. This will normally be set to the largest option your screenmode allows, but you can adjust it as desired.

The "Lose Excess" or "Keep Excess" option changes the gameplay slightly by selecting what happens when a cell is over-full. More on this option below! "Lose Excess" is the default behaviour from the original version of Atoms.

When you're ready to go, click the "Start!" button! Pressing space or enter on your keyboard will also start the game.

Each player take a turn to place an atom in one of the board's cells. Place an atom simply by clicking in the square. You can only place an atom in an empty cell, or a cell which already contains atoms your own colour.

A cell which becomes full will burst and add one atom to the first cell in each direction, regardless of the colour of any atoms in those cells. It takes 4 atoms to make the middle cells burst, but only 3 for the edge cells (since they only have 3 adjoining squares), and only 2 for the corner squares. Since the cells which these burst atoms move into might already be nearly full, a chain reaction can be set off.

Occasionally a cell might end up with more than the maximum number of atoms it can hold. If the "Lose Excess Atoms" option is used when starting the game, any extra atoms are simply lost and the exploded cell is left empty. This is the behaviour of the original Atoms game. If the "Keep Excess Atoms" option is selected, any extra atoms will remain in the exploded square afterwards, which can give a small advantage to the current player. Of course, the same rules apply to the other player also.

Once all the reactions are finished, it's the next player's turn to play - unless, of course, they don't have any atoms left, in which case they're out of the game.

The last player left with atoms remaining on the board is the winner.

You can quit the current game at any time by clicking on the window's close gadget, or by pressing escape on your keyboard.

@NODE "tooltypes" "Atoms-X - Icon Tooltypes"

@{b}Atoms-X Tooltypes@{ub}

Atoms-X supports some tooltypes for advanced configuration of the game. Normally you shouldn't really need these but just in case, here they are:

@{b}SOUND=(DISABLED|OFF|NATIVE|AHI)@{ub}
If the SOUND tooltype is not set (default) or set to AHI, Atoms-X firstly tries to use AHI for sound, and if that doesn't work, falls back to using native (Paula) sound directly.
Setting it to OFF starts Atoms-X with sound enabled but turned off. Sound can later be turned on in the start window.
Setting it to DISABLED causes Atoms-X not to initialise the sound routines or load sound files, therefore it is not possible to turn it back on without changing the tooltype and restarting Atoms-X. You should only need this option if Atoms-X appears to cause problems with other applications using sound.

@{b}NORTG@{ub}
Enabling this tooltype overrides the automatic selection of graphics type and runs Atoms-X on a native screen, as if the Amiga does not have a graphics card installed. This can be used on classics with graphics cards to force the output onto a native screen. @{b}NOTE:@{ub} This will cause graphics corruption if used on Amigas without a native chipset (i.e., AmigaOne or MorphOS machines). It won't crash, but it will be unplayable.

@{b}NATIVESCREENMODE=<ModeID>@{ub}
This tooltype is used to remember the screenmode selection when Atoms-X is running on the native chipset. If it is not present or set to 0, a screenmode requester will open when Atoms-X is started on a machine with no RTG. Delete this tooltype to force this requester to appear the next time Atoms-X is started.

@{b}NATIVESCREENDIMS="<width>,<height>,<depth>"@{ub}
This tooltype goes hand-in-hand with the NATIVESCREENMODE, and saves the dimensions of the screen chosen. These can be modified as required, and will be adjusted to the nearest valid value if incorrect values are entered or the Tooltype is deleted. Again, this setting can be reset by holding down shift as Atoms-X starts.

@{b}ANIMSPEED=(OFF|SLOW|FAST)@{ub}
This tooltype selects the speed of the animation for the explosions in the game. Normally SLOW is fine and is the default if this tooltype isn't present, but on some slow machines, setting it to FAST or OFF should speed things up a little. This settings can also be changed from the start window.

@{b}GFXSIZE=(0|1|2)@{ub}
This tooltype sets the size of the graphics used on RTG systems. 0 is the smallest, 2 is the biggest. This tells Atoms-X which size to set the cycle gadget to in the start window. If the screen size doesn't allow a chosen size to fit, the next size down will be selected instead.
This option has no effect on native screens as these use fixed size graphics.

@{b}PLAYER1="1,Player 1,0"
PLAYER2="1,Player 2,2"
PLAYER3="0,Player 3,2"
PLAYER4="0,Player 4,2"@{ub}
These tooltypes save the details of each player from the game start window. The format is: 
  1 for the player being picked to play, 0 for the player not being picked
  The name of the player
  0 for a human player, or 1-3 for CPU player with difficulty of easy, medium of hard respectively.
These tooltypes are probably best left alone - you can edit the player names in the game's start window and it will save them here automatically if the SAVESETTINGS tooltype is enabled.

@{b}EXCESS=(KEEP|LOSE)@{ub}
This tooltype enables the "Keep Excess Atoms" option during gameplay. See @{"Playing" LINK "playing"} for more details. This settings can also be changed from the start window.

@{b}SAVESETTINGS@{ub}
When this tooltype is enabled, all the game settings (player settings, excess, sound and graphics options) are saved to the Atoms-X icon tooltypes. If it is disabled or not present, settings will not be saved and will return to their default values the next time Atoms-X is run.
