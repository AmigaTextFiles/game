Pookah Dice - v2.
-----------------

	A Silicon Implants Production - 1996.


Warning.
--------

	I've never written a doc before, so this is probably gonna be well
dodgy, hopelessly inaccurate, and missing half the info. Ain't life a bitch!

	(Actually, that last bit was a lie, since this is version 2 of Pookah,
this is now version 2 of the document also. However, I haven't learnt
anything since then, so the bits that I've added to this doc are probably
indistinguishable from the original bits. Hopeless maybe, but consistently
hopeless at least!)

Copyright stuff.
----------------

	It`s public domain, and freely distributable, and copyright Mark
Neesam 1996. If you like it then that's cool (I'm not averse to complimentary
Emails!). If you don't, then I'm very sorry, and I'll try harder next time.
I think that covers everything.

	
	
Introduction.
-------------

	I wrote this game because I needed to write something easy whilst
I learnt to program in Blitz Basic. Simple as that really. I kinda like
it though.


Stuff what you should now have.
-------------------------------

	Included in Pookah Dice are the following files:-

		Pookah_Dice	  - the game itself
		Pookah.prefs	  - a small prefs file
		Pookah.scores	  - the hi-score tables
		Pookah.doc	  - what you're now reading!
		mwb_dice.bsh	  - some nice dice gfx
		dodgy_dice.bsh	  - ditto
		click.snd	  - the click sound
		roll8.snd	  - the dice roll sound
		cash2.snd	  - the win sound
		dice_template.iff - piccy template of gfx layout
	also:-
		The Pookah.font files

	If the .snd files, font and prefs file aren't there Pookah Dice will
fail. Also, having the gfx file named in the prefs file would probably be a
good idea. 


Requirements.
-------------

	An Amiga.
 
	I've tested it on an A1200, and an A4000/40. It'll run from either
floppy or hard drive on both these. Anything else and you're on your own
really. I suppose you could get in touch with me at the address at the end
of this file if you're really desperate. Likewise, for any bug reports.


Installation + running Pookah Dice.
-----------------------------------

	Firstly, copy the font stuff to your font directory. If you're 
installing Pookah Dice to a hard drive, simply copy all the files listed
above (except the font stuff) to wherever you want it. Then double-click the
Pookah_Dice icon.


Screen stuff.
-------------
	
	It really needs a Magic workbench type screen to run properly.
		i.e. 8 colours and kinda squarish (e.g. 640 * 512). 
	The 8 colour thing is a necessity -although a MWB type palette isn't.
	As long as colour five is different from colour 1 it should be fine.

	The screen size needs to be at least 640 pixels wide. Since v2 it should
	now work on NTSC non-interlaced displays.
	

How to play Pookah dice.
------------------------
	Pookah dice is a gambling game based on poker, but played with dice.
The object of the game is to get filthy stinking rich by rolling, decent
poker-style scores using ordinary household dice. You get five dice to
throw, and two rolls if needed, and can keep as few or as many dice from the
first roll as you wish. Before the first roll you may alter the stake using
the gadgets provided (or the handy menu options), so that you can play safe
or go for the big win, or even stake it all on one throw. The choice is
yours.


Scoring.
--------

	The following scores will win money in Pookah dice:-

		      Two pairs ... 1 * stake.
		Three of a kind ... 1.5 * stake.
		     Full house ... 2 * stake.
		 Four of a kind ... 3 * stake.
		       Straight ... 4 * stake.
		 Five of a kind ... 5 * stake.


	For those unfamiliar with poker:-
		
		A full house is three of one score + a pair of another.
		A straight is an unbroken run of numbers
		    in Pookah dice either 1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6
			(in any order!)

	For those unfamiliar with common sense:-
	
		A pair is two of the same score.
		Three of a kind is three of the same score.
		Four of a kind is ... oh, figure it out!


Limits.
-------
	The game will end should your score go over $300,000,000. See the
history section for the sketchy reasoning behind this.

Hi-scoring.
-----------

	There are two high score tables in Pookah dice - one main table, and
a secondary one, just for good measure.
	The main hi-score table	records highest finishing scores - that is
the money you have left at the end of the game (hence the retire option in
the project menu). Just as in real life, it`s what you leave with that
counts here.
	The second table records the highest scores ever achieved. I put
this here so that we might all learn from past mistakes, and get out whilst
ahead. Fat chance. This table is not nearly as valid as the first one
though, even if you have got 14 squillion quid as a hi-score here. As a kid
I once won £50 in an amusement arcade, and I only went home with a tenner - 
oh yes, I've learnt the hard way!

	Hi-scores are saved after any new hi-score is achieved.


New dice please.
----------------

	You can draw new dice for Pookah dice if you want. All you have to
do is load up the template screen included and draw the relevant items in
the spaces provided. Next save the indicated section as a normal IFF brush.
Then, run the game and choose "Pick new dice" from the options menu. Choose
your new file in the file requester and hey presto, Pookah now sports your
own groovy graphics. Spanking! This will automatically change your .prefs
file to match the new dice too. Bonus!

	Included with Pookah Dice should be two sets of dice anyway. The
default set (mwb_dice.bsh) are quite nice, wheras the other set
(dodgy_dice.bsh) are stylishly shoddy. Take your pick.


History.
--------

	Version 1.
		Not actually named as version 1, but I guess it must have been, coz
it was the first anyone except me saw of it. It probably wasn't officially
version 1 coz I had no intention whatsoever of ever updating it. However...

	Version 2.
		Not for me the timid little .1 increments in version number, oh no!
This is version 2 goddammit! (despite the fact that it is little more than a
couple of bug fixes, a couple of ideas more fully implemented and a slight
tweaking here and there). Version 1.014a this most certainly isn't!


		Bugs fixed:-

			The "Raise by" menu bug, whereby the checkmark next to the 
selected stake increment in the menu was not reset to 5 at the start of a new
game, even though the stake increment was.

			The rather dim floating point money bug, which meant that at a
certain score the display and hi-score tables started printing complete
hogwash (technical term!).


		Ideas more fully implemented:-
			You can now change dice whilst playing the game. Version 1
needed the .prefs file to be manually altered.

			Maximum score incorporated. Inspired by the rather dim
floating point money bug, a score ceiling has been implemented, bringing
about the end of the game when a score of $300,000,000 is reached. Some
people might not like this, but that's tough. Beyond this ceiling things just
get silly. In fact, a fairly long time before the ceiling it starts getting
silly, when it gets past it, it's bloody ridiculous. However, this also adds
a new challemge. The game ends only when a win takes your score over
$300,000,000. Therefore, a maximum score of $1.8billion is possible (that's
$0.3bn stake + (5 * $0.3bn) winnings). See how high you can score!


		Things that were slightly tweaked:-
			Alternate Roll gadget image incorporated. I don't know why
this wasn't done before. There was a convenient hole in the bitmap anyway.
			Gadget disabling/enabling done at nicer times.
			Text flickering reduced. (Note - reduced, not removed. Am I
hopeless or what?)
			Window height shrunk to 200 pixels so that awkward NTSC
people (only kidding) can run it now. (Pookah dice - the transatlantic dice
game!) 			



The end (of a thoroughly professional doc file).
------------------------------------------------

	That`s about it really.
	Pookah dice is copyright Mark Neesam 1996.
	It`s also public domain and freely distributable and all that kind
	of malarkey. So there.

		Ta to Gez for the sound.
