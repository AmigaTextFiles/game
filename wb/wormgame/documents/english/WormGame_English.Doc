Wormgame V1.10 - Documentation  
------------------------------ 
 
 
Introduction 
------------ 
 
WormGame is a replacement for all the other workbench worm games around. 
 
It is fast, has all the best features, and can even play your music mods for you! 
 
WormGame was programmed in AmigaE V3.1i. 
 
 
System Requirements 
------------------- 
 
This game will run on any Amiga running kickstart 2 and above. You must have the DiskFont.Library (It should be on your WorkBench disk). It automatically adjusts its display to the following screenmodes: 
 
 
 
* All PAL/NTSC Hires and S-Hires modes 
 
* All Euro36 Hires and S-Hires modes 
 
* All Super72 Hires and S-Hires modes 
 
* All Euro72 modes 
 
* All Multiscan modes 
 
 
The faster speeds may appear jerky when performing processor intensive operations e.g. ray tracing. Sorry, but this is unavoidable! 
 
 
The Game 
-------- 
 
The aim of the game is to collect as many white blocks (food) as possible, while avoiding dying either by hitting the wall or yourself. As you collect the white blocks, your length increases, and the idea is to eat as many blocks as you can, while avoiding becoming trapped by your tail. 
 
 
Control 
------- 
 
You control the worm with the arrow keys. Press a key and the worm will go in that direction. Press `P' or space to pause the game. Press an arrow key to unpause. The game will automatically pause if its window is deactivated. Press Escape or click the close gadget during play or when paused to return to the title window. 
 
 
Window Layout 
------------- 
 
The top of the window is the play area where you and the white blocks appear. The bottom quarter of the window shows your score represented as a fuel gauge. The highest and lowest hiscores are marked in this as black bars. `Score:' is your current score, and `Next:' is the value of the next block. When on the title window, the highscore window opens and gives extra information. 
 
 
Highscores 
---------- 
 
The game retains the top ten highscores, and if you score highly enough, it will automatically prompt you for your name. 
 
 
Options 
------- 
 
On the title display, the following options are available: 
 
1-3 : Pressing these keys will change the speed from 1-Fast to 3-Slow. 
 
T : This toggles whether you can perform kamikaze 180 turns, which kill you. 
 
L : Load a Protracker module to listen to. (Requires ASL library) The program remembers the last directory and module used. 
 
P : Turn the module on/off. 
 
A : Display an information window about the game. 
 
I : Iconify the main window. 
 
M : Turn mouse blanking on/off (Hides the mouse pointer when playing). 
 
S : Save current highscores. 
 
+/- : Change scroller speed. 
 
CtrlC : Clear the highscore table. 
 
ESC : This or the close gadget quits the game and saves the hiscores.
