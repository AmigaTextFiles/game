 Hi!

 I've used two commands to display graphics on AGA machines.
 They are: BLIT and BBLIT.The program used to be compiled without using
 any BLITZ mode.
 I don't have any graphics card, so I don't know what
 rechange BBLIT with... Pure me...;)

 All contents in SDK directory are for all people KNOWN BLITZ.
 If you're good enough, code and send to me source where the transparity
 problem gone. All I need is source code for remapping picture
 without 1 colour. Also, if You are a good programmer, make this source
 working on GFX cards too.

 Ok. Take your best editor (AmiBlitz's TED? PED...?:)) and code, code, code...
 I am waiting for your work.

 Raziel.
