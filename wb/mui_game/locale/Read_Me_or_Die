At the moment only two languages are supported:

   - English as builtin-language and
   - German.

If you think you are able to translate Schlawiner into another language
dont't wait - do it.
Therefore we added the Schlawiner.cd and an empty Schlawiner_empty.ct file to the
archieve. If you are not so familiar with the locale system don't panic it's
really easy:
All you have to do is to fill the empty lines in the Schlawiner_empty.ct file with
the strings in your language (the English strings stand one line after the
empty lines)
Finaly you have to insert your language in the second line of the file.
That's all - save the file and send it to us either via mail or via e-mail.
(read the guide to get in contact with us).

Moreover there is the File Schlawiner_Deutsch.ct which contains the German catalog.
You can use it to learn, how to write another catalogs for Schlawiner.
