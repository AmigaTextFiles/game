@NODE Anleitung "Introduction"

                           Introduction to Schlawiner
                           ==========================

   First at all you can define some number from 1 to 100 (by default 8 numbers
   are generated and intitialized randomly).
   This numbers have to reached by the players as close as possible.

   You have to dice with three dice and you can multiply every number diced
   with 10, 100 or 1000

   Examples:
                Diced   |  Possible Numbers
              ----------|-----------------------
                  2     | 2  20  200  2000
                        |
                  4     | 4  40  400  4000
                        |
                  6     | 6  60  600  6000


   Using this numbers and the operatores +, -, * and / you have to try
   to reach the given numbers as close as possible.
   In addition to that you have to use every number diced once. Also you
   can use brackets.
   The score is the difference from the solution found and the given number.

   Examples:

      Number Searched |   Diced    |  Possible Solution |     Score
      ----------------|------------|--------------------|-------------
         53           |  4  6  1   | (4+60)-10 = 54     |       1
                      |            |                    |
         40           |  1  2  2   | 2*(20+1)  = 42     |       3
                      |            |                    |
         22           |  2  1  3   | (30+2)-10 = 22     |       0
                      |            |                    |
         96           |  5  1  5   | (500-10)/5= 98     |       2
                      |            |                    |
         42           |  6  6  6   | (6*6)+6   = 42     |       0
                      |            |                    |

   You have to dice in turn and the score is added at the bottom of the list.
   At the end the player with the least score wins the game.

   Example:

      Numbers  |  Uwe    Harald    Flo    Leo    Martin    Kindy

        100    |   1        1       0      0        1        0
               |
