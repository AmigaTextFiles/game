  It is the seventh edition of WBGames. It includes:
                             
                             WBTetris       1.7
                             WBColumns      1.6
                             WBMineSweeper  1.6
                             WB15           1.4
                             WBBoxMan       1.4
                             WBBoulder      1.1

    I. History:

WBGames 1.7:
  1. New game called WBBoulder is added to the package. It
     is a clone of BoulderDash. Usage and editing of levels 
     is similar to WBBoxMan. The Boulder.DAT file contains
     6 levels only. SOMEBODY, MAKE MORE LEVELS!
  2. I took the level selection out of WB15. It is not needed
     in there anyway. I also changed "End of Game" message
     in WB15.
  3. All games are rewritten so that they better adapt to
     different screen and window types.
  4. I changed several things so that next versions can be
     easily adapted for both 2:1 (640*200) and 1:1 (640*400)
     screens. This capability isn't used yet, but it will be
     used in the next release!
  5. In both WBBoulder and WBBoxMan the "Level" menu is used
     to browse through the levels, not to set some certain level
     number.
  6. I changed the icon for WBBoxMan executable.
  7. My E-Mail address has changed (notice this!).
          
WBGames 1.6:
  1. All games were recompiled with the updated C compiler
  2. Prevoius versions didn't check the height of the window
     title bar. So, if you try to use something like Times 24
     as the title font, old WBGames looked ugly.
  3. WBGames 1.5 didn't open Topaz 8 font in order to use it.
     I assume that it is always opened anyway, but being nice
     I added OpenFont()/CloseFont() calls ( On other hand, who
     knows, what CBM will come up with... ).
  4. The look of the games has improved ( Well, it CHANGED. ).
  5. WBBoxMan now counts number of pushes, not the number of
     arrow movements.  
  6. I added one more tooltype to all of the games: PAUSED.
     It defines if the game will be paused on startup.
  7. Because of frequent updates, I put the date of the last
     modification in the title bar.
  8. After I found ASokoban by P.J.Christias I stole couple of
     ideas from it, including the set of the mazes. This set is
     called Sokoban.Dat. Sorry for this, but ASokoban looks so
     nice...  
  9. Manual has improved one more time ( Don't say it is still
     unreadable! ). So, the last version of the manual didn't
     tell you that you can use SHOWNEXT tooltype in the Tetris
     and Columns.
 10. Number of levels in BoxMan isn't limited anymore. You may
     have hundreds of levels in a single file, if you desire.
     Just remember, that any time when BoxMan can't open the
     level, it will begin the game from the level 1 assuming
     that there are no more levels in this data file.  
  
WBGames 1.5:  
  1. There was a terrible bug in all previous WBGames. It can be
     seen in the old MineSweeper: after you try to resize its
     window, Intuition will update its Close/Zoom/Resize/TopBottom
     gadgets every time you use any menu (even if it is the menu
     of different program). Doesn't look dangerous, does it?
     Nevertheless, this thing is capable of causing gurus and
     screwing up the system.
  2. WBColumns was starting with the same piece every time you ran
     it. Now it selects the random piece.
  3. I'm terribly sorry for the random number generator I use.
     The rand() function in my C compiler is extremely bad; it
     causes all those strange mines layouts in MineSweeper and it
     also doesn't mix the pieces in the WB15 enough. In the new
     versions I have improved it a little, but don't expect good
     randomization.        
  4. WBTetris and WBColumns are FASTER now! Yes, level 5 became too
     fast for me and I went to the level 4!
  5. ONE BIG IMPROVEMENT:
     WBGames are still WB-Games, but now they can be played on ANY
     public screen. You can also change window coordinates, levels
     and field sizes on startup. Read the rest of the manual for 
     instructions!
  6. Another, quite obvious improvement: I have a tradition to add a
     new game to each edition. This time it is BoxMan - the Sokoban
     (a.k.a. Boxxle) clone. Unfortunately, there are only 7 levels 
     ready. If you need more - feel free to modify Levels.Dat file.
     Just don't forget to send your masterpiece to me, I also like
     to play this game!
     
     
     
  II. Copyright
  
  You can use the games as long as you want and don't make any profit
from it. If you feel obliged (which is unlikely) or want MOST RECENT
VERSIONS of WBGames, you have to send me $15 US. I can also send the
SOURCES and CISTOMIZED VERSIONS (just write me what you want to be
changed). If you aren't interested in getting the newest versions of
WBGames - use those you have for free, I don't mind, but I change the
package and add new games every 2-3 weeks. C source codes of these
games alone are worth those $15. 

        To register WBGames and get newest versions of them:

                      great games!  




  III. Instructions
  
  All games have similar interfaces. So, you can stop the game (Game|Stop
menu option), start it (Game|Start option), begin a new game (Project|
New option), and, obviously, quit the game (Project|Quit). There is also
level selection (Game|Level) and "About" option (Project|About).

  5. WBBoxMan
  
  Start:
  From CLI: BoxMan <FileName> [ToolTypes] where the file
            FileName contains the levels you want to play at.
  From WB:  Use BoxMan as a tool for a file containing the
            levels. As example, I included a couple of these
            files.

  Keys:  
  [LEFT ARROW]  - move the arrow to the left
  [RIGHT ARROW] - move the arrow to the right
  [UP ARROW]    - move the arrow up
  [DOWN ARROW]  - move the arrow down

  The goal is to put all small boxes on their places. Remember
  that you can push only one box! This game needs a name of the
  file containing the levels. Otherwise, it will try to open the
  file called "BoxMan.Dat". You can change the levels and create
  new ones editing data files. Their format is self explanatory:
  just type "more Levels.Dat" to see those 7 levels I made, and
  you will get it! Also, take a look at Sokoban.Dat.     

  Data file format: (for those who can't figure it out)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  : Name of Level        The map uses these characters:
     Level Map           [.] - place for the box
     ...                 [#] - wall
                         [*] - box
  : Next Level                         
     ...                 [@] - starting position
  ---------------------------------------------------------- 
  Notice that if you don't enter the level correctly, game
  will display "End of Game?" message and reset to the first
  level. The most common error is omission of the starting
  position from the map.

  ToolTypes:
  SCREEN=<PubScreenName> - the name of public screen you want to
                           play the game on
  LEVEL=1...             - the level number
  X=<XCoordinate>        - the coordinates of the left-upper 
  Y=<YCoordinate>          corner of the window 
  PAUSED=<ON>/<OFF>/<YES>/<NO>   - Pause/Unpause game on startup

  6. WBBoulder
  
  Start:
  From CLI: Boulder <FileName> [ToolTypes] where the file
            FileName contains the levels you want to play at.
  From WB:  Use Boulder as a tool for a file containing the
            levels.

  Keys:  
  [LEFT ARROW]  - move the arrow to the left
  [RIGHT ARROW] - move the arrow to the right
  [UP ARROW]    - move the arrow up
  [DOWN ARROW]  - move the arrow down

  The goal is to collect all crystals and not get caught under the
  boulders. Falling crystals or boulders kill you. This game needs
  a name of the file containing the levels. Otherwise, it will try
  to open the file called "Boulder.Dat". You can change the levels
  and create new ones editing data files. Their format is self
  explanatory: just type "more Boulder.Dat" to see those 6 levels I
  made, and you will get it!     

  Data file format: (for those who can't figure it out)
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  : Name of Level        The map uses these characters:
     Level Map           [.] - terrain
     ...                 [#] - wall
                         [o] - boulder
  : Next Level           [*] - crystal
     ...                 [@] - starting position
  ---------------------------------------------------------- 
  Notice that if you don't enter the level correctly, game
  will display "End of Game?" message and reset to the first
  level. The most common error is omission of the starting
  position from the map.

  ToolTypes:
  SCREEN=<PubScreenName> - the name of public screen you want to
                           play the game on
  LEVEL=1...             - the level number
  X=<XCoordinate>        - the coordinates of the left-upper 
  Y=<YCoordinate>          corner of the window 
  PAUSED=<ON>/<OFF>/<YES>/<NO>   - Pause/Unpause game on startup


  All games were written for HIRES NON-INTERLACED SCREEN, so all pictures
have X:Y ratio 2:1. Because of this, games won't be looking so nice on the
different type of screen (640:400, for example), but you can use the 
screen with the ratio near to 640:200. For example 800:250 would be OK.
Of course, if you use 640:200 screen to open the games on, you won't have
this problem at all. Next version will probably include the bitmaps with
1:1 ratio.
  WBColumns also needs not less than 8 colors to work. In fact, its icon
is done in 8 colors. Other games work with first four standard colors.


  IV. Known Bugs:
   
      1. BoxMan and Boulder sometimes don't draw entire maze
         on startup, especially if it is the large maze and
         machine is too busy. They also "forget" to display
         info line in this case. I don't know why it happens.
         If you get something like this, select "New" from the
         menu and everything will get normal.
      2. I suspect that Columns sometimes doesn't collapse
         lines right. I can not prove it, because as soon as I
         react the line is already gone. If you notice something
         like this, send me a letter.
      3. Some of WBGames may cause Enforcer hits. If you notice
         such hit, tell me about it.
