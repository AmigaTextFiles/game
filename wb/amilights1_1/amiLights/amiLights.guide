This game served three purposes for me:
1) To experiment with the ClassAct GUI system
2) To provide my user database with a game based on this GUI system
   before I convert my main applications over (to discover any
   environment conflicts early and to design a complete application
   under this system).
3) I like games that run on the workbench

Its small, simple, and it comes with source. What more could you want :)

The game is based on the handheld game "LightsOut"(TM) by TIGER®. Its a popular
tetris-type puzzle game. I got it as a present and immediately thought it
would make a cute workbench game.  My conversion is not exactly based on
the handheld.  I generate random puzzles each game, whereas LightsOut(TM)
has fixed puzzles.  It also has a limited help feature which would not be
hard to add.

I recommend the game to anyone who likes puzzles.

The following may be either command line parameters or tooltypes:

LIGHTCOLOR=x    where x may be 0-255.  This is the color used to
    identify the buttons that are lit. Default is 7.

DARKCOLOR=x     where x may be 0-255.  This is the color used to
    identify the buttons that are turned off.  Default is 0.

DIFFICULTY=x    where x may be 1-25.  This is the complexity of the
    puzzle.  If you select 10, then ten steps (at least) are required
    to complete the puzzle).  Its possible to do better, though.


The window is iconifyable by clicking on the third from the left
button in the top window border.  De-iconify by double-clicking on
the new "amiLights" icon on your workbench.

How To Play:

The main window consists of a grid of buttons, two numbers labeled
"points" and "score" and two buttons, "New Game" and "Restart Game".

Clicking on "New Game" will at any time start a new game by randomly
lighting buttons on the grid (this is the main play area).  Your
job is to TURN OFF ALL THE LIGHTS.  You do this by clicking on any
button you wish.  

Clicking on a button will toggle it on or off and it will also
toggle its immediate neighbors above, below, left, and right.
So if we have the following (with X = lit):
	O O O
	X O O
	O O O
and we click on the middle button, the result would be:
	O X O
	O X X
	O X O
(notice the lit button in the first example was toggled off).
So clicking on a button it affects the buttons around it. A bit
of strategy is in order to solve the more complex puzzles.  You
may find yourself turning on many lights to set yourself up with a
solution.

Eeach time you click on a button, this counts as a "move".  The points 
field contains the number of points you would score if you turned out 
all the lights, and of course drops as you expend your moves.

If there are three lights, and the points field has 9 in it, and with one 
click you finished the puzzle, you will be rewarded with 8 points.  When 
the points field reaches zero you can still play, you just won't increase 
your score when you complete it.

Clicking on "Restart Game" will (at any time) restart the puzzle
to the beginning of whatever puzzle you happen to be working on.
The points field will be reset as well.

If you finish the grid, whatever is left in the points box is added
to your score when you click on "New Game".  The score box may be
interpreted as:  points gained / games played.

Remember: Its ALWAYS SOLVABLE :)
