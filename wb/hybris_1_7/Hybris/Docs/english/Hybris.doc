intro "What is Hybris ?"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hybris is another 'Tetris'-'clone' to  be  played  on  the  Workbench-
    Screen.
    By the way: It's Freeware.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
tetris "What is Tetris ?"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Tetris is a meanwhile pretty old  thinking-game.  You  play  in  a
    rectangular playfield divided into small squares. The player  gets
    tiles composed of four  squares  in  contact  which  are  dropping
    slowly, but can't be stopped. When a tile hits the borders of  the
    playfield or previous dropped tiles, it is laid down, i.e.	it  is
    fastened in the playfield, and the player gets another  tile.  The
    game ends, when you can't get a new  tile  for  it  would  overlay
    tiles laid down before. If you manage to fill one row  completely,
    all its squares vanish and the sqaures  atop  drop	one  position.
    This way the player gets new space. The  player  may  control  the
    dropping tile by shifting it to the left or right and he can  drop
    it faster (in order to avoid boredom) or rotating it clockwise.

    Objective of the game: First, to play as long as you can. Advanced
    players may create their own tasks, i.e. first drop some tiles
    without watching them and then cleaning up the mess.

hybris "What are the differences between Hybris and Tetris ?"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - There is	a  two-player-mode  with  both	players  in  the  same
      playfield.
    - You man have a break.
    - The player(s) can set the size of the playfield in a wide range.
    - The player himself/herself controls, how fast or slow the  tiles
      shall drop.
    - There are not only tiles of four squares, but also from  one  to
      six squares.
    - The player can control, how often tiles of different sizes shall
      occur.
    - The player can mirror  the  tile	horizontally.  (But  not  both
      players of a  two-player-game.  I  simply  found	no  reasonable
      joystick-command for this.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
files "Files / installing"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The package consists of the following files (icons not listed):
    - Hybris: the program itself
    - Catalogs/*/Hybris.catalog:
      Translations of the programs texts (for now only 'deutsch')
    - Docs/*/Hybris.guide, Docs/*/Hybris.doc:
      The dokumentation each in Hypertext-format and "raw".
      For now only english and german
    - Hybris.cd:
      A cd-file for CatComp (for creating 'further translations')
    - tracker.library:
      A shared-library which is required by Hybris.

    It is not necessary to install 'Hybris'. Who likes, may  move  the
    Catalog(s) to 'LOCALE:' and the library to 'LIBS:'.
    The 'Docs'-subdirectory must stay where it is, but you may  delete
    all icons and the guide-/doc-files you do not (want to) use.
    The cd-file may be deleted, if you don't want to create  your  own
    translation.

    Concerning the help-function see 'technical information'.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage_1 "How to control Hybris (outside the game)"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - The gadgets are to be used as usual.
      The gadgets '1s' to '6s' control the frequency of the  tiles  of
      1 to 6 squares. 0 means the certain group is not	used  at  all.
      The frequency refers to the whole  group.  If  for  example  all
      groups are chosen equally, the 4s-squares will occur  much  more
      seldom than single squares.
      To whom this is to obscure: just try. After all, the tiles are
      chosen by the (pseudo-) random-generator.
    - The cursor-keys alone control the size of the playfield:
      - <up>: decrease the number of rows by one.
      - <down>: increase the number of rows by one.
      - <left>: decrease the number of columns by one.
      - <right>: increase the number of columns by one.
    - The cursor-keys with <SHIFT> control the falldelay:
      - <up>/<right>: increase the falldelay by one.
      - <down>/<left>: decrease the falldelay by one.
    - The function-keys control the frequency-gadgets as follows:
      - <F1> is related to the '1s'-gadget and so on.
      - The function-key alone increases the frequency by one.
      - <SHIFT> with the function-key decreases the frequency by one.
      - <CTRL> with the function-key sets the frequency to zero.
      - <ALT> with the function-key sets the frequency to one.
    - The game is started with fire on the joystick or the <S>-key.
    - Using the <ESC>-key you may leave the program after a  security-
      request.
    - <#> toggles between one- and two-player-mode.
    - <V> toggles the preview of the next tile(s) on or off.
    - <HELP> gets you a help-file in your current language or, if this
      is not available, in english.
      If this fails: see 'technical information'.
    All the control-values are read from the environment-variable
    "Hybris.setup" during the program start and are written there at
    the end of the program.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage_2 "How to play Hybris"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the two-player-mode player 1 (blue tiles)  plays  via  joystick
    (in port 1) and player 2 (grey tiles) plays via keyboard.  In  the
    one-player-mode the player may use the joystick  as  well  as  the
    keyboard. (Suggestion for advanced players: play  the  two-player-
    mode alone) Commands:

    - joystick left, <4>, <cursor left>:
      Shifts the tile one square left (if possible).
    - joystick right, <6>, <cursor right>:
      Shifts the tile one square right (if possible).
    - joystick down, <2>, <cursor down>:
      The tile is dropped fast. In the two-player-mode it may  happen,
      that the tile is hold by the tile of the other player.  In  this
      case you can control it again.
    - joystick fire, <5>, <return>, <space>, <enter>:
      Turns the tile a quarter clockwise. If that is  impossible,  the
      tile is turned again - if necessary, up to four times.
    - joystick up, <8>, <cursor up>:
      Pause. May be finished by pressing a key,  using	the  joystick,
      the mouse-buttons or clicking the close-gadget.
    - <M>:
      The tile gets mirrored vertically.
    - <ESC>:
      After security-request: stops the game.
    - Gadgets, function-keys, <Help>: see 'control'.
      (as far as freed)

tech "System requirements / technical information"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hybris runs only under kickstart 2.0 (and above ?) for  using  the
    gadtools.library extensive.
    The  help-function	requires  one  of  the	programs  'Multiview',
    'AmigaGuide' or 'More', either in 'Utilities:' or somewhere, where
    it is found automatically.
    The program was written on	a  2000B  with	A2630  (4MB).  It  was
    (superficially) tested with the 68000 and is  concerned  to  work,
    too.
    As far as i guess, the program  should  work  on  any  Amiga  with
    Kickstart 2.0 (or above). I don't know much  about  Kickstart  3.0
    since i don't have it, but i see no reason for problems.
    Hybris needs about 110KB on Disk and about 90KB ordinary and  75KB
    graphics memory to work completely.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
legal "Copyright, Warranty"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hybris is Freeware. It may be distributed and given  away  in  any
    number. Exception: It is prohibited  to  distribute  Hybris  (also
    together with other data), if the costs  exceed  3$  (postage  not
    included). (On CDs: max. 13$)
    Im sorry, but i can't guarantee that my program causes no harm  to
    the computer, existing data or the user (better:  player).  I  can
    only promise that i have not intended to creat a trojan horse.

misc Miscellaneous
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I am thankful for
    - Bug-reports. Please, with exact description
	a) on what kind of Amig and width  which  extensions  the  bug
	   occured
	b) how to produce the bug
	c) how the bug shows
      I will try to fix the problem, but if it does not happen	on  my
      2000B with (or without) A2630, i'm rarely able to do anything.
    - a GUARANTEED complete listing of all corresponding  7s-tiles  to
      be able to include them into the game.
