@node intro "TinyInvaders - Introduction"

@{u}@{b}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

Welcome to the world of Tiny Workbench Games!

Tiny Workbench Games bring you all the fun of the arcade to a tiny little
window upon your workbench. Why would anyone want to do this? Because its
cool, thats why!

These games were inspired by the Tiny Windows Games series, available from
http://www.tinywindowsgames.com

Enjoy!

@node instl "TinyInvaders - Installation"

@{u}@{b}Installation@{ub}@{uu}

Installing TinyInvaders to your harddisk is very easy, simply copy it. The
minimum required specification to run it is WB3.1 and 68020, but it has
been optimised for graphics card users.

If you are only using AGA or ECS, you'll need to install a WritePixelArray
patch like BlazeWCP.

If you are using a highcolour or truecolour screenmode, TinyInvaders won't
steal any screen pens.

There are some options you can set via tooltypes or CLI arguments:

OPAQUE

If you set this flag, window dragging will be "opaque" instead of the standard
bounding box dragging. This is usually very fast, but can be slow when
dragging over programs that refresh themselves slowly (such as Blacks Editor).



PUBSCREEN

Use this if you want TinyInvaders to open its window on a screen other
than workbench. Example:

PUBSCREEN=AWeb



AHIUNIT

By default, TinyInvaders attempts to open ahi.device unit 0. Use this to
specify a different unit, if required.
