@node usage "Usage.."

  @{fg shine}@{b}Usage
  ~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   This will explain the different settings in Detris so that you
   can get the most out of it.

   But first I will explain two different things; blocks and pieces.
   A block is a square of which pieces are buildt with.
   Pieces are the things in different shapes that falls down on
   the screen and that you are supposed to control and place right
   on the playfield.
   The standard tetris pieces consists of 4 blocks each.

@endnode

@node mainwin "The main window.."

   @{fg shine}@{b}The main window
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

  @{u}Score@{uu}
    This will show your current score while you are playing.
    You get 1 point if you move a piece down the screen.
    You get 10 point if you place a piece somewhere.
    You get 100 points for every line you clear and another
    200, 500, 1000 or 2000 points if you clear 2, 3, 4 or 5
    lines at once.
    You get 3000 points if you manage to clear the whole playfield.

  @{u}Level@{uu}
    This is the current level which reaches from 1 to 10.
    The higher the level the faster the pieces drop.
    The increment of the level is base about 90% on how many
    points you have and 10% on how many lines you have cleared.

  @{b}New game@{ub}
    This will reset Detris and make it ready for a new game.
    The "n" key also work if the game is stopped or paused.

  @{b}Start@{ub}
    Press this to start playing the game after you have pressed
    @{b}New game@{ub}.

  @{b}Pause@{ub}
    You can press this button to pause the game whenever you are
    playing. It will change and say @{b}Continue@{ub}. Press this
    to keep on playing. The "p" key also works.

  @{b}Quit@{ub}
    This will exit Detris.
    You can also set the Esc key to be used as "quick quit". See prefs.


@endnode

@node prefs "The prefs window.."

   @{fg shine}@{b}The preferences window
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

  @{u}Game page@{uu}

    @{b}Player experience@{ub}
      Here you can set how hard the game will be to play.
      "Child" will make the pieces drop very slowly and "Elite"
      will make them drop very fast.

    @{b}Use these pieces@{ub}
      Here you can set which pieces you want to use.
      "Standard" is the standard tetris 4-block pieces.
      "Smaller" is the 4 new non-standard 3-, 2- and 1-block pieces.
      "Larger" is the 18 new non-standard 5-block pieces.
      "All" will use all pieces.

    @{b}Show preview piece@{ub}
      This will make the next coming piece in the game visible in the
      little square in the main window while playing.

    @{b}Nudge pieces over when rotated at an edge@{ub}
      If you have a long piece falling that is placed vertical and
      at an edge you normally cannot rotate it because it would
      rotate partly outside the playfield, but with this switch it
      will be automatically moved when trying to rotate it so that
      it can be rotated at an edge or at the top.

    @{b}Equal number of std<->non-std pieces@{ub}
      If you use f.ex standard pieces and larger pieces, the amount
      of larger pieces is much more and therefor you will rarely get
      any standard pieces. With this switch however, there will always
      be 50% standard pieces and 50% larger pieces.

    @{b}Insert random lines at start@{ub}
      This will enable the random lines which will be generated when
      you press @{b}New game@{ub}.

    @{b}Number of random lines@{ub}
      This will set how many lines from the bottom of the playfield
      you want to be filled with random blocks.

    @{b}Percentage of blocks in the lines@{ub}
      This will set how many blocks by percent you want to fill the
      random lines with.

  @{u}Playfield page@{uu}

    @{b}Number of blocks horizontally@{ub}
      Here you can set how "wide" you want the playfield to be
      horizontally. To make the playfield visually bigger you
      can just resize the whole main window.

    @{b}Number of blocks vertically@{ub}
      Here you can set how "high" you want the playfield to be
      vertically. To make the playfield visually bigger you
      can just resize the whole main window.

    @{b}Outline on blocks@{ub}
      Here you can set the level of "3D" for the blocks.
      If you set it to "None" the blocks will just be plain squares.
      With Single you will get a 1-pixel wide 3D-line around every
      block. With "Double" you will get a 2-pixels wide 3D-line.

      You can also set if you want the outline to be around the
      blocks or around the whole pieces.

    @{b}Invert outline@{ub}
      This will make the outlines give a recessed look.

    @{b}Do not fill blocks@{ub}
      This will ignore all colour settings and make all pieces (and
      blocks) transparant to the background in the playfield.

    @{b}Full-line scroll method@{ub}
      Here you can set how you want Detris to clear full lines
      when you play. Try out the different methods :)

      "Sweeping" and "Fast sweeping" are two new (v3.1) methods
      that doesn't smear out the background.

    @{b}How to manage backgound@{ub}
      This option is really only useful if you have a background-
      pattern in the main window defined in the MUI-settings.
      If you don't want the pattern to be used in the playfield
      you can set this to "Use colour 0".
      If you have a quite differing background you will see it
      get quite distorted when you clear full lines. You can then
      set this to "Background with redraw". This will however
      introduce a slight flicker, especially if you have
      @{b}Full-line scroll method@{ub} set to "Linear" or "Logarithmic".
      Don't use "Background with redraw" if you use one of the
      two sweeping full-line scroll methods.

    @{b}Resize window to fit@{ub}
      When you change playfield either by changing the number of
      blocks in x and y size or resizing the main window you
      will see some bars that will fill out the space that get
      "left over" after the scaling in the playfield. With this
      switch Detris will try to resize the main window so that
      these bars will disappear.
      However, the balance objects in the GUI might cause this to
      resize the window forever.

    @{b}Make "Speed Down" visible@{ub}
      When using the key that makes a piece drop immediately
      you can use this switch to make this drop visible.


  @{u}2-Player mode@{uu}

    @{b}Enable 2-player game@{ub}
      This will open the playfield for player 2 and enable you to
      play 2 players at the same time. Be sure to see the Input Control
      for player 2 so you know which keys (player 2 can only use the
      keyboard) to play with if playing locally.

    @{b}One player game over makes both game over@{ub}
      Usually when one player gets game over in 2-player mode the
      other player can continue until (s)he is also game over.
      This switch however, makes both game over when one player
      becomes game over so the other one does not have to wait.

    @{b}Show the chat line in the main window@{ub}
      When playing 2 players over the net you might want to throw
      a line at the other player during the game. But if you use
      the Chat board window the game will be paused while writing
      and this can be annoying, that's why the ability to get the
      chat line in the main window instead to prevent the game from
      being autonmatically paused whenever you write a line.

    @{b}Competition@{ub}
      When playing 2 players you can have competition which in
      different ways will make the life misserable for the other
      player :-)
      @{i}None @{ui}- No competition, just playing at the same time.
      @{i}Score battle @{ui}- When one player removes a line the other
       player get minus points. More minus point for more lines
       removed at the same time.
      @{i}Random lines @{ui}- Whenever one player removes a line the other
       player gets a new randomly generated line at the bottom.
      @{i}Random block @{ui}- Whenever one player removes a line the other
       player gets a single block somewhere in the playfield.

    @{b}Environment@{ub}
      Here you can set how 2-player mode shall behave. This setting
      has nothing to do with you being connected or not, except that
      you cannot play 2-players over Internet without being connected
      ofcourse.
      With Locally you will play 2 player on the same computer and
      with Internet (TCP/IP) you will play one player on each computer
      and the two computer must be connected.

    @{b}Mode@{ub}
      Set the mode for this Detris. One is Server and the other one
      is Client. The server must Connect first and the Client secondly.

    @{b}Connect@{ub}
      Click this button to connect. If you are server this will make
      Detris to wait for another Detris to connect to you as a
      client. If you are a client there must be a running Detris in
      server mode on the address (Remote IP and Port) you specified.
      This buttin will change to Disconnect when pressed and nothing
      goes wrong. This means you can press it again to disconnect.

    @{b}Get prefs@{ub}
      When connected you can get the prefs that is need to be the
      same when playing 2 players over the net from the other Detris.

    @{b}Remote IP@{ub}
      This is the IP-address of the computer you want to connect
      to as a client. It can also be a name of that computer like
      f.ex. deniil.dyndns.org. This is ignored if you are a server.

    @{b}Port@{ub}
      This is the port to use. You can use any port here as long
      as you use the same on both sides. Don't use ports like 21 or
      80 or 6667 as they are usually used by FTP, HTTP and IRC.


  @{u}Other page@{uu}

    @{b}Show the image at startup@{ub}
      With this checkmark switch on you will see the Detris logo
      every time you start Detris.

    @{b}Automatically connect TCP/IP at startup@{ub}
      This will make Detris to automatically start listening for
      another Detris if in server mode, or start trying to connect
      to another Detris if set to Client mode.

    @{b}Ask before activating input at startup@{ub}
      If you have selected something else than the keyboard as input
      device you can enable this switch to be able to confirm the
      initiation of this input device every time you start Detris.

    @{b}Generate a new game when Detris is started@{ub}
      Normaly you have to press "New game" in the main window
      before you can press "Start" and begin to play.
      With this switch you don't have to do that the first time
      Detris is started.

    @{b}Pressing New game automatically starts the game@{ub}
      If you are confident that you will only press "New game" once
      before every game (sometimes it might be nice to be able to
      press "New game" multiple times to get a different first piece
      or a different random pattern) you can enable this switch which
      will automatically start the game when you press "New game".

    @{b}Only update score when getting new piece@{ub}
      Normally Detris will update your score everytime a piece moves
      down on the playfield as you get 1 point for every downmove.
      With this switch however Detris will only update the score
      when a piece lands at the bottom. This will make the game run
      a bit smoother on slower systems.

    @{b}Auto open chat window on incoming message@{ub}
      Set this switch if you want to be notified when the other user
      throws you a line using the chat and you chat window is not
      currently open.

    @{b}Hide the balance object bars@{ub}
      With this switch you can hide the bars in the main window which
      you can use to control the size and shape of the playfield and
      preview window with.

    @{b}Do not open highscore window when game is over@{ub}
      When you get gameover the highscore window will normally open
      letting you enter a name in the highscore. You can prevent
      this window from popping up with this switch.

    @{b}Show the game over image when game over@{ub}
      When a game is over and image will show in the highscore window.
      This switch will prevent this image from showing up.

    @{b}Enable Escape key for quick quit@{ub}
      With this switch you can select if you want the Esc key to
      quit Detris immediately. No warning requesters will pop up
      even if you are in the middle of a game!


  @{b}Save prefs@{ub}
    This will save all settings including keys- and colour-settings.

  @{b}Save game@{ub}
    This will save the game you are currently playing.
    If the same game has been saved earlier you will be asked if
    you want to save over the same game or to save a new game.
    About the same question will be asked if the game was loaded
    from the gamefile.

  @{b}Load game@{ub}
    This will open a window with all the different games you have
    saved. Note that if you are in the middle of a game, this game
    will be terminated whether you decide to load a game or not.

  @{b}Use@{ub}
    This will use the current settings in this prefs window.

  @{b}Cancel@{ub}
    This will reset to the setting that were set right before
    you opened the prefs window.

  This window will open when you select Load game somewhere in
  the program.

  If you have any saved games their Score, Level, Playfield size,
  Pieces and a name you specified when you saved the game will be
  shown in a list. To see a game you just select the game in the

    The game will then be paused, so just press @{b}Continue@{ub} in the
    main window to start playing the game where you last left it.

  @{b}Use settings only@{ub}
    If you have selected a game but you don't want to play it, only
    use it's settings you can press this button.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

  @{u}Set input@{uu}

    Here there is a list with all six input event;
    Move left/right/down, Rotate left/right and Move fast
    down i.e. immediately place a piece.

    To change an even you just active the even in the list, then
    press the key/move the joystick or whatever to get the input
    into the list. If you select the first event (Move Left) and
    press a key then the second event will automatically be
    selected and so you can easily select input for the whole
    list without the need to activate every even with your mouse.

  @{u}Select input@{uu}

    If you intend to use something more/else than the keyboard
    for input you have to select it here.

    @{b}Input handler@{ub}
      Here you select if you want to use the lowlevel.library
      or the gameport.device. They have a bit different
      characteristics. Gameport is much more responsive than
      the lowlevel so I'd recommend that first, but feel free
      to try out both.

    @{b}Port number@{ub}
      This is the number of the joy-port you intend to use.
      0 is the standard mouse-port and can only use the mouse
      through the system as the system has allocated it.
      1 is the standard joystick-port and 2 and 3 are extra
      ports that usually are not available on standard Amigas.

    @{b}Input device@{ub}
      Here you select what you want to use on the port you
      chosed.
      If you intend to use the mouse you probably should use
      the gameport.device as lowlevel.library doesn't handle
      mouse movements very well.

    @{b}Repeat speed@{ub}
      This is the repeat speed for the movement and the buttons.
      It is also the polling interval for the lowlevel.library.
      1 is one second between the repeats or the delay between
      lowlevel reads new input. 60 is 1/60 second.

    @{b}Activate@{ub}
      After you have set all the obove and decide that you
      will be able to use the input you selected you must
      press Activate to activate this device for input.

    @{b}Deactivate@{ub}
      If you don't want to use an input device any more you
      can deallocate it with this button. This is also needed
      if you want to change input device.


  @{b}Use@{ub}
    Press this if you are satisfied with your new key settings.

  @{b}Cancel@{ub}
    Press this is you are not satisfied and want your old key
    settings back.


@endnode

@node colour "The colour window.."

   @{fg shine}@{b}The colour editing window
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

  In this window you can change the colours of all pieces.

  To change a colour, just press the piece you want to edit
  and then use the Pen-slider or the colourwheel gadget to
  change the colour.

  The cycle-gadget that can be set to "<< Pens" or "RGB >>"
  selects if you want to use colour pens or true-colour RGB
  for the pieces.

  It's recommended to use Pens if you have less than or equal
  to 256 colours on the screen. AGA/ECS should use Pens.
  If you have a GFX-card with High- or True-colour (15bit+)
  you should use RGB ass it is much nicer and gives you exact
  control over the colours.

  When using RGB, only one pen is used to draw all colours.
  The problem with AGA/ECS is that if you change the colour of
  a pen, all colours on the screen that was drawn with that
  pen will also change in an instance. That is not the case
  with RGB-based GFX-cards.

  If RGB works with your display-circuits then use it, if it
  doesn't, then use pens.

  @{b}Use@{ub}
    Press this if you are satisfied with your new colours.

  @{b}Cancel@{ub}
    Press this is you are not satisfied and want your old
    colours back.

  @{b}Fly through@{ub}
    With this feature Detris will step through the different
    pieces in the colours editing window at the same time that
    you can hold the colourwheel and specify colours on the fly.
    Practical if you want to set the colour of all pieces on
    some kind of fading scale or something :)

    @{b}Save the game@{ub}
      This will save the game you are currently playing. You will
      be asked for a name for the game.
      If the same game has been saved earlier you will be asked if
      you want to overwrite the same game or to save a new game.
      About the same question will be asked if the game was previously
      loaded from the gamefile.

    @{b}Load an ASCII-game..@{ub}
      Here you can load a game which is in a special ASCII-format.
      With this feature you can load a game you have designed yourself
      or to load one of the predefined game supplied in the package.

    @{b}Save as ASCII-game..@{ub}
      Here you can save the game you are currently playing in the
      special ASCII-format so that you f.ex can edit the playfiled
      and then load the game a continue. Ofcourse the score of level
      will not be in this file as it then would be very easy to cheat :)

    @{b}Save ASCII-template as..@{ub}
      If you're thinking of making your own predefined game you should
      first save a template and make your game based on that. It is much
      easier than to write from scratch.

@node news "News.."

  @{fg shine}@{b}News and Changes
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

  @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} Now you can play 2 players against each other, or just at the
          same time! There are 3 different ways of competing while
          playing.

  @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} You can also play over internet (TCP/IP)!

  @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} You can chat over internet! Detris v3.2 has a built-in chat
          feature!

  @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} A switch so that the score only gets updated when you place
          a piece somewhere and not after every move. This should make
          it feel smoother on slower machines.

  @{fg fill}* FIX *@{fg text} It was impossible to read KeyPresets sometimes.

  @{fg fill}* FIX *@{fg text} Using Mouse as input on port 0 didn't work.


@{b}v3.11
~~~~~@{ub}

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The search path for the XyzPreset directories was not set
    from ProgDir: but from current dir which caused Detris to
    search for these directories in SYS: if Detris was started
    from Workbench.

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Use background with colour 0 didn't work as expected for some
    people. Fixed (I think)

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Trying to use Input port 0 crashed with certain config. Fixed.


@{b}v3.1
~~~~@{ub}

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now the colours are actually reloaded!

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now the size of the preview and playfield are saved!

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now you can also save games in an ASCII-format so that you
    can edit them by hand and then reload them! A few ASCII-games
    are already predefined.

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now you can play with your mouse or joystick if you want!

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now you can save any number of keysettings so that many
    people can play with their personal keysettings without
    the need to reconfigure all the time! Some are already
    predefined.

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The input editor has been totally remade.

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} You can also save any number of coloursetting and a few
    are already predefined!

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} There is now two new draw methods that doesn't smear out
    the background or makes a flick!

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now you can select if you want the outline to be drawn
    around the whole pieces instead of around every block as
    before!

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now you can enable Esc key for quick quit and "p" is now
    used for pause/unpause and "n" for New game!

  @{fg fill}*@{fg text} I have removed alot of enforcer hits.

@node reg "Registration.."

  @{fg shine}@{b}Registration
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   Please use the internal "Easy register" that pops up
   when you start the program! You can also reach it from
   the Project menu.
   It's no online full-auto thing that might scare off some ppl..!

   Detris is Key-mail Ware which means that you have to
   send me an e-mail with your name to get a key-file so
   you can get rid of all annoying requesters! :-)
   It's absolutely free, I just want to see what program
   is most popular! Now TheMPegEncGUI seems most popular..

   Your name will ofcource not be used for anything else
   than to create your personal keyfile which will be sent
   back to you ASAP.

   - And don't forget your NAME! Otherwise I can't generate a keyfile!

   There is also one limitation if you do not register!
   - You cannot change the playfield size.
