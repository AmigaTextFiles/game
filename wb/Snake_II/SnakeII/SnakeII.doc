INTRODUCTION

 There is a nice WB Game called Snake. It´s really great. But there
 are several features missing:
 - Font sensitivity
 - User defined magnification
 - User defined game field size
 - User defined keys
 - Highscores
 Now, there is Snake II. It offers all these features and some more.


REQUIREMENTS

 Snake II requires Workbench 2.0 (or higher) and
 reqtools.library © by Nico François.


INSTALLATION

 Simple. The only file needed is the program itself. When highscores
 or settings are saved first time, a file ENVARC:snake.prefs is created.
 It will be updated every time you achive a highscore or save the
 settings.


USAGE

 You have to move the snake through the game field using the keys
 defined in settings. Default are cursor keys and `P` for pause.
 There are stones appearing on the screen. After a while they will
 disappear. Their functions are:

 White stones:   If you eat them, the length of your snake and your
                 score will grow.
 Black stones:   They will kill you immedately.
 Special stones: The colour of these stones is the last of your
                 Workbench palette.
                 There are two kinds of specials:
             SpeedUp    : Increases game speed for a little time.
             KeySwap    : Swaps control keys for a limited time.
                 Each Special comes with a scoreup of 10000 points.

HIGHSCORES

 The highscores display may be toggled on/off by pressing
 right Amiga + `H`.

OPTIONS

 Window Size  : Set game field magnification to allow playing
                on a 1280x1024 WB too.
 Resolution   : Size of game field.
 Settings     : Define key assignments by pressing the buttons
                followed by the key to assign.
                Prevent reverse: If enabled, you cannot run backwards.
                Deadly bounds: If disabled, bounds are skipped.
                PubScreen: If enabled, You will be asked for the name
                         of the pubscreen to open SnakeII on.

SCORING

 The scoring depends on:
  - Resolution (higher - more score)
  - Deadly Bounds (on - more score)
  - Prevent reverse (off - more score)
