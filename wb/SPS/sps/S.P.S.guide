@node FM_What "What is S.P.S?"
@prev Main

S.P.S. stands for Scissors, Paper, Stone. If this doesn't ring any bells then, quite frankly, I'm amazed.

Scissors, paper, stone is a game of chance. In a nutshell, two players choose one hand signal from the three available (the eponymous scissors, paper and stone) and compare them. Each signal beats one other, loses to one other, and draws with the third. Here's how they line up:-

Scissors cut paper (win), but are blunted by stone (lose).
Paper wraps stone (win), but is cut by scissors (lose).
Stone blunts scissors (win), but gets wrapped by paper (lose).

The game usually takes place as a "best of 3" affair, however, it is customary for the loser at this point to suggest an upgrade of the competition to "best of 5", then 7, then 9 etc...

S.P.S. faithfully re-produces all this excitement.

S.P.S. is a Silicon Implants Production.
S.P.S. was written by me, Mark Neesam in 1997. It was lovingly crafted from purest Blitz Basic 2, and isn't at all badly designed, inefficiently programmed or hopelessly shoddy in any way, shape or form. Oh no! Any illusions that you might harbour to the contrary are well wide of the mark, let me assure you!

S.P.S. is copyright Mark Neesam 1997. It is Freeware (like I'd ever be able to charge money for such a hopeless, useless, waste-of space of a program!) 

Feel free to express your thoughts about S.P.S.

I'd prefer Email because it's so much easier to ignore. Oops! I didn't mean that. Seriously, I like getting Email. (it makes me feel popular!)

@node FM_Why "Why bother writing S.P.S?"
@prev Main

I'm still not sure. The idea just occurred to me one day, and then refused to go away. I think the challenge of creating possibly the most pointless computer game ever appealed to me. I suppose I was also intrigued to see if it would, against all odds, actually turn out to be at all worthwhile. I'm still not sure.

At this point I'd just like to argue the case for S.P.S. being the most pointless computer game ever, and possibly the most pointless computer game possible. I have tried to think of an existing computer game less worthwhile than this, and have failed. I then considered the possibility of writing a computer simulation of coin-tossing (the first game I thought of with less to it than S.P.S), but even this would have more merit, because it would allow you to simulate a coin toss when you didn't have access to a coin, wheras SPS serves no such purpose (OK - I'm assuming you've got hands here!). The only merit to SPS on computer is the addition of the computer opposition, but this, by my reckoning, is a fairly pointless extra, since in reality scissors, paper, stone is only ever played to, for example, settle an argument, decide who goes first, etc... If you feel the need to do that with a machine then you really are very strange indeed.

@node FM_How1 "How do I install S.P.S?"

To install simply drag the drawer to wherever you want it. All necessary files are kept safely in the SPS directory so as not to contaminate your hard drive/workbench disk/whatever.

@node FM_How "How do I play S.P.S?"

To start a game, use either of the options in the Project menu. If you select a one player game the computer will play as your opposition.

Once you have started a game, press space to start the first round. Once a round is underway you have a short time (until the animated hand finishes the third sweep) to choose your signal. For player one (on the left) the keys 1, 2 and 3 correspond to scissors, paper and stone. Player two uses 1, 2 and 3 on the numeric keypad. (I've just realised that this will annoy A600 owners, but I don't actually care. This is a fundamentally pointless program, and I've wasted too much time on it already. So there!)
If no key is pressed in time the choice will default to stone.

New for version 2 - mouse/joystick control:-
Instead of using keys 1, 2 and 3, player one may use LMB for scissors and RMB for paper. Stone will obviously then be selected if no mouse press is detected. Player 2 may use a second mouse or a 2 button joystick for his or her selections, with button 1 being scissors, and button 2 being paper.

Scoring takes place at the end of the round, and the game continues until one player reaches the target score. At this point, the winner will be given the option to claim his victory, or to give in to the losers pleas to raise the target. This decision can be made either using the gadgets provided, or your scissors (claim victory) and stone (raise target) keys. The choice is yours.

Mouse/joystick control differs slightly here, with LMB/button 1 selecting claim victory and RMB/button 2 selecting raise limit.


A victorious computer opponent will occassionally raise the target score. There is a greater likelihood of this when the computer is a long way ahead.

Additional:

Menu options allow player names to be changed and the initial game target to be
altered. Comprehensive stuff, I think you'll agree.
