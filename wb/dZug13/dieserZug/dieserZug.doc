                 Dieser Zug v1.2a, December 1993 - Juha Vehviläinen
                 ==================================================


    Short Description
    =================

    dieserZug (dZ) is a traingame, similar to the kind of games where
    you control a worm, trying to eat pieces which make you longer.
    However, the main difference is that dZ is perfect. There's no need
    for feature-list, just play the game and see for yourself. 

    The Main object of the game is to use a good strategy to get your
    train as long as possible. Due to the strategical nature of this game,
    only one hiscore-list is used, though there are three possible values
    for the speed. Just use the one you're best at.

    The main window's title has two numbers in it. The first one shows the
    value of the next wagon you must collect. The other one is your total
    length / score.


    How?
    ====

    Arrow keys      Movement.
    Keypad          - " -
    'p'             Pause.
    '5' (keypad)    - " -
    '1' - '3'       Finetune the speed.
    ESC             Quit the game. During shutdown the hiscores,
                    window positions and other data will be saved to
                    "PROGDIR:dieserZug.data". PROGDIR is the directory
                    where dieser Zug (or any other program for that
                    matter) is started.
    DEL             Close/Open Top Ten window.
    HELP            (on the startup-logo) Will show the keys used, and if
                    pressed twice, the Author Gallery.


    Command Line Options:

    These are case sensitive. Valid entries are, for example:

    "dieserZug -a -d -t"
    "dieserZug -lsd"


    ?               Show the usage.
    -a              Show The Author Gallery.
    -l              Force to Lace Mode. This may be used if for some
                    strange reason dZ wouldn't detect that you're using
                    an interlace screen. (looks pretty weird on a non-
                    interlace screen..)
    -s              Disable Scaling. Scaling takes place only in the Lace
                    Mode. It makes the Author Gallery and the gameover
                    graphics look "right", but slows down a bit.
    -d              Disable the irritating text below the dZ logo.. :-)
    -n              Don't activate the main window. VERY useful when
                    you put dZ to your startup-sequence.. :-)
    -t              Use the Tumpelo Mode. This is for people who are
                    pissed of with those fatal 180 degree turns..
