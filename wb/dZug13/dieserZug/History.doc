    1.0         The first release. No known bugs.

    1.0a        '5' from keypad is also used to pause the game.
                Forgot to include that to v1.0. v1.0a was never
                actually released, nothing too outstanding invented.. :)

    1.2         Note 1: First version which requires KS2.0 or later.
                Sorry, 1.3 users! Time to upgrade.. :)

                Note 2: The datafile structure has changed. If an old
                datafile is found, it will be converted. Just copy your
                old datafile to the directory where dieser Zug is located.
                (no more using s: ...)

                Added detection of interlace-screen. dZ will now
                double the y resolution if opened on interlace screen.
                With the -s flag, the Author Gallery and the GameOver
                graphics will also be scaled to match the window size.

                dZ now uses the topaz 8 romfont for text, ignoring the
                system font. If you hate this font.. sorry. Note: The
                screen default font will (of course) be used for the
                window title. With previous versions, this screwed up
                the playfield if screen's font was taller than 8 pixels.
                The window is now adjusted to the font size.

                The train's head will be colored with color 3 when
                paused. I always forgot which one was the head if I stopped
                playing for a while.. :)

                The string gadget should work now.. Sometimes it missed
                the <ENTER> keypress.

                The DEL key will toggle the ScoreWindow Open/Close. The
                state of this window will also be saved to the datafile.

                Added help page.. Its main purpose is to show all the
                available features for people who don't bother reading
                docs.. :)

                Added the -n flag.. :)

                No menus in this version. Still don't think it's necessary.

                A known bug: Sometimes the train starts with rand() wagons
                which are not added to the score. This "bug" will be fixed
                as soon as possible, until then we'll consider it as a
                feature.

                If the main window is deactivated, the game will be paused,
                not just halted until the window is activated again.

                + several other modifications which I might have forgotten.
                See for yourself.

    1.3         Added the Tumpelo Mode.. In this mode it's impossible to
                make a fatal 180 degree turn. 

                Fixed the "train starts with rand() wagons" - bug!
