Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Snakes & Adders is simply a variation of the `worm' type game.  You 
move around the screen using the cursor keys and gobble-up the numbers 
which will appear before you.  The larger the number, the more your snake
will grow.


Numbers
~~~~~~~
   The numbers 1 to 9 will appear at random points across the screen 
during the course of game.  It is suggested that you eat these numbers, 
otherwise there is not much else you can do.  Occasionally a question mark
`?' will appear.  These contain mystery numbers.  Only when you eat one, 
will you know how large a number it was.  The number can range from 1 to
25.

   On some levels upto 3 numbers on screen will appear just to add some
`variety' (read as confusion.. ;) ) into the game.  The chances of
multiple numbers appearing on-screen will be determined by the current
level.

   In later versions we plan to have additional attributes for question 
marks `?'.  We hope to include speed up, slow down and reverse control 
to make things.. interesting.



Speed
~~~~~
   As you progress, your snake will start to get extremely long.  When 
you have eaten all the numbers available, you will proceed to the next 
level and your snake will have returned to its default size.
   But as we're 'kind' games programmers, you will have to complete it at
a different speed (probably) than on the previous level.  In addition the
numbers (might) decrease faster.  (Sighs of `oh - wonderful' abound) :)


Other keys
~~~~~~~~~~
   As far as I know the A600 and A1000 have its cursor keys awkwardly  
placed so you can use other keys for movement.  This is achieved via  
Tool-Types settings on the Snakes&Adders Icon.


Tool-Types
~~~~~~~~~~
   I prefer a,s,p,l for movement, so in my tool-type information I have 
the following settings:..

   LEFT=a
   RIGHT=s
   UP=p
   DOWN=l

   If you're not sure how to change tool-type settings simply click on the
Snakes&Adders icon once and then select from the Workbench menu 
'Information..' or use 'RtAmiga-I'.  Then select the tool-type you want to
change by clicking on it.  Change the value after the '=' to whichever key 
you wish to use.  Standard typewriter keys (The light coloured ones in the 
main keyboard area.) are entered by pressing the key on its own. 
(UnShifted.)  
   Any of the other keys require their name to be entered, for example
"Right Shift", or "Help".  A complete list of all key names accepted is
listed at the end of the document.
   The Cursor keys can be entered as follows, but there is little point, 
since the cursor keys are the default values, so the same effect can be 
obtained by leaving the options blank.

   LEFT=Cursor Left
   RIGHT=Cursor Right
   UP=Cursor Up
   DOWN=Cursor Down

   Quotes are not required, but can be used.

   LEFT="A"
   RIGHT='Numeric Enter'

   If you are still unsure how to use tool-types consult your Workbench 
manual, or some dedicated Amiga owner who will definitely know. :)

Going Back on yourself
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There is one more tooltype available for use in the game.  This
tooltype is called 'BACKONSELF'.  The 'BACKONSELF' tool type takes one of
two values, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'.  Its structure is as follows:..

   BACKONSELF=FALSE    ;this does not allow your snake to go back on itself
                       ;and cause you to crash during the game.. (Default)

   BACKONSELF=TRUE     ;this allows your snake to go back on itself and
                       ;cause you to crash during the game..

   The purpose of this tooltype is for mainly to add/omit difficulty from
the game, for the more 'hardened' games-player.. ;)


Quitting the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   To quit the current game press the Escape key.  This will produce the 
"Game-Over" message, from there, Escape again will take you to the titles.
Pressing Escape on the title screen will close the game.


Running the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   DoubleClick on its icon from your Workbench.  Or run it from the CLI 
if you prefer.  The game is intuition-based, so don't expect a ray-traced 
snake in HAM-8, and you don't get a twenty minute kick-ass soundtrack!!! 
However, you can run the game easily from a menu or a keyboard-shortcut 
using programs like Toolsdeamon v2.x if you so desire it!!!
   In addition, you can run music in the background on programs like 
Delitracker etc., so you can effectively have your 20 minute kick-ass 
soundtrack playing away in the background; just contradicting what I've 
said :)

   When on the title screen, start the game by pressing the SPACE-BAR..


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   An Amiga of virtually any type from one of the following:..

   A500,A500+,A600,A1000,A1200,A1500,A2000,B2000,B2500,A3000,A3000T,
   A4000/030,A4000/040,A4000T,A4000/060,CDTV & CD32 with a keyboard.

   As for future RISC Amigas, it'll work on 'em !! ;) as long as the 680x0
is emulated correctly. 

   OS Friendly code... Written in Devpac 2 & 3

   Memory required: about 10K of Chip RAM, and 30K of anything else.

   ..and should work on any Amiga with KS2.04/WB2.04 and above.
   
                 If you have got less than KS2.04/WB2.04..
                    Upgrade, it makes life easier.. 8^)

game, we would like a Gift of some nature in return.  A Postcard with a
greetings message on it, money (of course), disks (blank or otherwise),
games u don't want, computers & peripherals u don't want, duff Amigas and
state of the art DOOM & F1GP routines are especially welcome.  Oh and any
rather sexy females out there ;)

Remember
~~~~~~~~
   We programmers cannot be held responsible for user's incompetence and
we will not be bullied into compensating `Joe Bloggs' who's just gone and
blown his beloved Amiga into bits (for whatever reason it may be).  But 
we'll have your spare parts. :)


REFERENCE: Key Names.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Here are the names of the non-typewriter keys which can be used in the
tool-types. (In roughly the order that they appear before me ;-)

     F1  F2   F3   F4   F5   F6   F7   F8   F9   F10
                                                   BackSpace  Delete  Help
Tab                                                Return
Ctrl                                  Right Special
Left Shift  Left Special              Right Shift
Left Alt    Left Amiga      Space     Right Amiga  Right Alt


Numeric (   Numeric )   Numeric /   Numeric *
Numeric 7   Numeric 8   Numeric 9   Numeric -
Numeric 4   Numeric 5   Numeric 6   Numeric +
Numeric 1   Numeric 2   Numeric 3   Numeric Enter
Numeric 0   Numeric .


If that looks gibberish, you're probably viewing this document in a 
proportional font. Try Topaz.font, you'll have it somewhere.

NOTE: Left Special, and Right Special are the little blank keys, One next
to left shift, and one next to return. If you have a foreign keyboard, or 
an older machine, these keys might not be present, or they may have 
something printed on them. If they're not there, don't use these 
tool-types, or you'll have a non-movable snake ;-)
