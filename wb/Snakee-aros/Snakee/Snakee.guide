 @{b}@{u}Introduction@{uu}@{ub}

 Snakee is just a little test project (worm game) I did to learn todo my own MUI-class in C.
 I know that it's not perfect in many ways, but it should be sufficient for starters to see
 how stuff can be used while playing in MUI.

 The new source code is completely re-written and is using SDI-includes by Dirk Stöcker
 to be able to easy make the binary target to all different Amiga-systems (ie. OS3, OS4, MorphOS and AROS).

 In case you found some serious flaws in the code or has tips on better solutions,
 please contact me so I can update it =)

@ENDNODE

@NODE "req" "Snakee 0.2 - Requirements"
@PREV "intro"
@NEXT "install"

 @{b}@{u}Requirements@{uu}@{ub}

 This program needs at least following stuff:

 · MorphOS 1.x or AmigaOS 4.x
 · (Shall work when compiled with OS3 and AROS aswell)
 · Magic User Interface (MUI).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "install" "Snakee 0.2 - Installation"
@PREV "req"
@NEXT "usage"

 @{b}@{u}Installation@{uu}@{ub}

 This program doesn't need any installation and because of that doesn't come with
 any form of installer script. Just place it where you want and run it from there! =)
 
@ENDNODE

@NODE "usage" "Snakee 0.2 - Usage"
@PREV "install"
@NEXT "faq"

 @{b}@{u}Usage@{uu}@{ub}

 There is not much to say about the usage, just use the cursor keys to make the
 worm to go in desired direction to eat the "food" on the play field.
 Once eaten enough food, you'll be off to next level which has a worm speed that is
 slightly faster than before...

 That's all folks! =)

@{b}@{u}FAQ - Frequently Asked Question@{uu}@{ub}

* @{b}Q = Question@{ub}
* @{b}A = Answer@{ub}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q - Why is it pixel left on the playfield after the worm sometimes ?

A - We have seen this effect on AmigaOS 4.1 when using the composition engine.
    using the game on screens w/o this effekt works as intended.

==============================================================================

Q - Why don't you include 68k and/or AROS-binaries in this release ?

A - Due to a pressed schedule from Deniil I had to release this right now
    so I didn't had time to produce binaries to other systems than MorphOS
    and OS4. But the included makefiles should be able to produce working
    binaries IMO. (I cannot guarantee since it's untested atm)
    Well include all binaries in the next release (when I have more time)
