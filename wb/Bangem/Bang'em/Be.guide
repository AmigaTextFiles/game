    @{i}Why this game?@{ui}

 I am (was?) currently writing a car game but since I got stuck and haven't
been able to figure out the problem for four weeks now I decided to take my
mind of it for a while. So I wrote this game, it is nice to play while
downloading, in case of extreme boredom or while just generally waiting for
something.

       @{i}How to play:@{ui}

 I take it you have all seen those machines at the amusement parks where you
have to hit the up-popping figures with a rubber hammer as fast as you can.
This is what you might call a computer version of it :-)

 You have a certain amount of time to @{b}@{i}hit as many faces@{ub}@{ui} (or circles if you've
selected it in the settings-menu) @{b}@{i}as you can@{ub}@{ui}. Depending of how many faces you
hit when the time is up you get a score; if it is higher than the current
highscore it will be saved when you exit the game. If you want to alter the
amount of time feel free to do so. However, giving yourself more time doesn't
necessary make it easier to get a higher score; the score is relative to the
amount of time..
 You can also set how long the figures should stay (in seconds) before going to a
new place by selecting "Speed" in the settings-menu. The longer the figures
stay, the less score you get for the ones you hit!

 If you get a hiscore you can choose to gamble it. You then have to guess a
number between 0 and 99. Everytime until you get it right a sum is deducted
from your score. When you've finally guessed it your score is multiplied with a
random factor.

 Easy eh? Yup. But remember that a small sum is deducted from your score when
you click in box that doesn't contain a face!

 v1.0b
  First release

 v1.0
  -Several faces now appear at the same time.
  -The faces disappear after a while.
  -A small sum is now deducted from your score everytime you miss a face.
  -The intro screen is now more flexible, you can access the menus and so on
   without having to click away the introscreen first.
  -Fixed the time bug which prevented games to last more than 60 seconds.
  -Scrolling text at the intro screen added.
  -The settings-menu now looks better with the ">>"-sign.
  -The time could sometimes be several hundered seconds when your score was
   very high. This has now been fixed.
  -Fixed colour-bug when entering highscore (I hope!).
  -Cleaned up the code by removing some unused variables.
  -Fixed the "Bamg'Em" screen title. "Bang'Em" is what is says now.

  -Wrote a better wait_for_mouse routine after entering your name.

    @{i}What will be included in the next version?@{ui}

 I have started on a new project, which is pretty big and which hopefully will
be finished someday too (It is currently called Sozenes). Until it has benn
released (or thrown away), any new versions of Bang'em will probably have to
wait. This means, that this is more or less the final version for a while.
However, the next version will hopefully contain more graphics to choose
from, a different mousepointer, gore and non-gore version, resizeable board
and maybe some sounds too.

 Please feel free to @{b}@{i}send me sounds@{ub}@{ui} or graphics that you think would fit in
the game!

@node "about" " About me"

  This program was written by Gustav "Gosweede" Gnosspelius 1997-1998.
 I (Gustav Gnosspelius) take no responsibility for any damage Bang'em may
cause you or your computer. (It won't hopefully).

 You may contact me by email at @{b}gosweede@lindesign.se@{ub}. Please send me all kind
of suggestions concerning Bang'em and of course also criticism. If you
discover a bug; PLEASE TELL ME!

 Finally, I'd like to excuse for messy layout of the guide, layout isn't my
greatest talent. 


 Thanks to everyone on the Blitz-list!
 
 
  Bang'em was made in Blitz Basic 2.1 in 1998.
  With comments, unused code and so on the program is 416 lines long.
  The small face was drawn in PPaint 6.4 (Thank you Cloanto!)
