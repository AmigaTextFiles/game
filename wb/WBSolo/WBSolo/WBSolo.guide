using the mouse.

on the board.

@NODE Rules "Solo Rules"

RULES

Solo is played on a cross-shaped board, like the one shown below.

                    o o o
                    o o o
                    o o o
              o o o o o o o o o
              o o o o . o o o o
              o o o o o o o o o
                    o o o
                    o o o
                    o o o

As you can see there are 44 pawns on that board and only one emply place.
Every time you move one pawn, an other pawn is removed from the board.
You can move a pawn only two places horizontaly or verticaly. The new
place for the moving pawn must be empty and it must jump over an other
pawn. The game is over when you can't make any other valid movements.
The major goal is to leave only one pawn on the board. Can you do it?

@TOC Description

MOVING

Before you move a pawn you must first select it. The selected pawn is
highlighted. You select a pawn by clicking the mouse on it. If you
click on a pawn that cannot be moved, it won't become highlighted.
If there is a selected pawn on the board and you click on an other
pawn, the new pawn will become selected and the other will be
deselected.

When you cannot make any other valid movements then the game is over.
The program will notice it and a requester will appear telling you how
many pawns are left on the board.

WBSolo uses a buffer where it stores the movements that you have made,
so that you can save them on the disk and restore them from disk later.
This option lets you cancel some movements that you have made, without
restarting the game.

@TOC Description

BUTTONS

There are some buttons on the window of WBSolo. The tytle bar of the
WBSolo window looks like this:

           move backward
                       | move forward
  close gadget         | |  depth gadget
             |         | |  |

            +-+-------+-+-+--+
            |*|WBSolo |<|>|[]|
            +-+-------+-+-+--+

As you see there are four buttons:

HISTORY

WorkBenchSolo is my first program written in C for the Amiga.

 Version 1.0 (18.12.95) Initial release

 Version 1.2 (16.3.96) Current release
New features:
* Now uses a buffer to keep the movements and store them on disk.
* Move buttons added on WBSolo window.
* Pawns can now get highlighted only if they can be moved.
* Some stupid bugs fixed.

I don't think that such a program accepts any impruvements.
If you have anything in mind just let me know.
