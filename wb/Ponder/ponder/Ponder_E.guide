        This world is crying to be free
        This world is dying can`t you see
        We need a turn to do it right
        We need a mind-revolution
        To get away from this selfishness
        Stop playing blind - break free

Ponder is a little @{"game" link "game" 0} for workbench. I tried to make it fontsensitive and
I think it is. Ponder was written in Assembler and that means it is very
short and fast. I hope this. I kept care for the Amiga-Style-Guides and I
never had any problem with Ponder.

Ponder is @{"Cardware" link "cardware" 0}.

If you`ll put Ponder to a PD-Disk so you have to use the whole package and
you must contact me and send me this disk. The actual Ponder-package owns

You don`t know what a game is ?! So meet your next PC-Distributer and he can
tell you!

@node "cardware" "Cardware"

Cardware is the same as Freeware (see below) but now I please you to send
me a postcard of you hometown (cause I like to get postcards and I`m
collecting stamps ;)

Freeware is a part of Public-Domain-Software, that is freely distributable,
but still copyright by the author. That means, you can copy Ponder as long
as you want but you MUST NOT change it anyway. I want to please you to keep
this guide and the  @{"game" link "game" 0} together if you copy Ponder. So the others will
know, @{"how to play" link "how2play" 0} Ponder. Thanx !

@endnode

@node "how2play" "How to play Ponder"

The sense is: rebuilt the left field using the right one. But it`s not as
simple as it seems: you can click every button only once a time. If this
button has a neighbour, this neighbour  will be changed. The way of this
change you can define using the game-menu. Klick @{"here" link "usage" 0} to get more about this.

Well, thats all. But try it so you will love it...  ;)

@{b}NOTE:@{ub} the statement down in the About-requester was taken from the song
"Your turn" by Helloween. Listen to their music (better their older lp`s)
and keep care for their texts! And if you like good witty music listen to
"Instant clarity" by Michael Kiske (Ex-Helloween) - this is a really genious
CD.

@node "install" "Installation of Ponder"

You  can copy Ponder where  you want to - it does not require any external
ressources or files. But if you have installed the locale library you may
copy the catalog files (your prefered language) to their default directories.

If possible please put asl.library and icon.library (both are AmigaOS
system-files) to your LIBS: directory.

@node "usage" "How to use Ponder"

@{u}The menus@{uu}

@{b}Project@{ub}
   About       opens a simple requester
   Font...     lets you select a font for the playfields, not the state-line
   Quit        you will leave the game (or press the CloseGadget)

@{b}Game@{ub}
   Width       sets the width of the playfield
   Height      see Width
   UnDo
      Off      switch off the UnDo gadget
      Last     enable UnDo, but only the last click
      All      so you can UnDo all the steps you made
   Step
      1/2/3    if you click a button and this button has already set neighbours
               these will be decremented (or incremented... see below) by this
               value
   Limit
      4        set the upper limit of the counts; if you set step '1' and Limit
      ...      to '4' a button will count 1-2-3-4-1 (as you may know of the
      9        older versions of Ponder); step '2' and limit '5' will cause
               this: 1-3-5-2-4; step '3' and limit '5' this way: 1-4-2-5-3;
               if you cross the limit with e.g. 2 this remainder will be
               the new button value
   Reverse     usual Ponder will add the step-value starting with '1'; if you
               switch on Reverse Ponder will subtract the step-value beginning
               with the limit
   Cycle       (this is for the Freaks of you) switch this on and Ponder does
               not count the Step value but it "cycles" through its values, so
               with the next click the count-value is decremented by 1; is
               the value greater then 3 it will be reset to 1; with the first
               click the value is what you set in Step (maybe set Step to '2'
               will start counting with 2 (has no effect with the first click)
               and next click 3 - next 1 - next 2 - etc.....  )
   Allaround   normally only left/right/upper/lower neighbour of a clicked
               button will be count  ---  here you say that these AND upper-
               left, upper-right should be count
   Time        -
   Retry       you can retry  ;)
   New         shuffles a new source field


@{u}Gadgets@{uu}

With version 1.1 you are able to undo the last click(s). For this use the
UnDo gadget placed in windows top border, left of windows zoom gadget.

And the playfield gadgets: left the source field and right the field where
you must rebuild the left source field.

@{u}Tooltypes:@{uu}

   FONT     specify the playfield font
   SIZE     specify the fonts size

   You don`t need to set both, if you use only one or none of them Ponder
   uses for the other one the screenfont-name or -size or both!

   WWIDTH   set the _INNER_ width of the Ponderwindow
   WHEIGHT  set the _INNER_ height of the Ponderwindow

   These values are used for windows minimum dimensions too!

   GWIDTH   width of playfield  (1-10 allowed!!)
   GHEIGHT  height of the playfield (1-10 allowed!!)

@{u}Additional@{uu}

Use the SizeGadget to size the window. Now it`s special that Ponder tries
to open a bigger playfield-font and scales this font to the optimale size!

If you want Ponder a new language, translate the ponder.ct file (placed in
the locale dir of the ponder archive) into this language  and "compile" it
with maybe MakeCat by PALADIN SOFTWARE. If you have created a new catalog
I want to please you to  send this catalog to me so I can put it into
the Ponder package and release it.

As you may have noticed there are some disabled items in the game-menu. So
look out for later versions...

@endnode

@node "knownbugs" "Know bugs"

Here I listed errors caused by Ponder but which I cannot fix. If there is
someone who knows about them - please let me know this.

  - runnig Ponder from DOpus will cause the Guru 0x87000004 (Unexpected
    packed received)          [cause of the new 68060.library ???]


@{b}MCP Note@{ub}
Since Ponder uses a little hack to set its button texts (under Kick 36/37
it is impossible to 'legal' modify the text of a button), the Gadtools-Patch
of MCP does not work.
Set the Ponder windowname in the button patch of MCPPrefs and now all
worx.
