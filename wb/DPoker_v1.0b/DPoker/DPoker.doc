[1] System requirements
-----------------------

  DeLuxe Poker requires version 2.1 of the Amiga operating system or higher,
  and *muimaster.library*.

  You can find muimaster.library in the Stefan Stuntz's MUI package,
  see paragraph "...MUI_MUI_MUI_..."



[2] Installation
----------------

  Simply copy the DPoker drawer wherever you want.
  Start it, by double-clicking on its (nice MagicWB :-) icon.

> NOTES:
>
> DPoker looks good on an 8-color Workbench with the MagicWB default palette.
>
> If your Workbench has 8 colors, double-click on palette8.pre icon (or load
> it through the Palette preference program) before starting DPoker.
>
> If your Workbench uses only 4 colors, double-click on palette4.pre icon (or
> load it through the Palette preference program) before starting DPoker.
>
> However DPoker looks nice even when black cards are not so black and red
> cards are not so red ;-P



[3] DeLuxe Poker is a Video Poker ...
-------------------------------------

  You know Poker rules, don't you? ... No? ... Sorry, you lose!

  A "hand" in DPoker is made up of three phases:

  PHASE I: BETTING
  ----------------

    Click on <Bet> button to bet one credit; click on <Bet 10> button to
    bet 10 credits (the greatest bet allowed).

    The bet credits will be displayed above the <Bet> button (BET SUM).

    When you've made your bet click on <Deal> button and ... good luck :-!


  PHASE II: CHANGING YOUR CARDS
  -----------------------------

    If you want to hold one or more cards, click on button <1> ... <5>,
    the word "hold" will appear under the selected cards.
    If you want to un-hold a selected card, click on the corresponding
    button again.

    When you are satisfied of your choice click on <Deal> button to change
    the cards that are not holded.


  PHASE III: LOSE OR WIN & RISK
  -----------------------------
  
    If your cards form a winning combination (see below), you'll win some
    credits (displayed above <Deal> button); otherwise you'll lose the
    credits you bet.

    Now you can gamble your winnings:

    - click on <5> button if you *don't want* to gamble; the winnings
      will be added to your current credits.

    - click on <1> button if you *want* to gamble:

	the leftmost card is the dealer's card, in order to double your
	winnings you must choose one of the remaining four cards, if the
	card you choose beats (i.e. is greater than) the dealer's card
	your winnings will be doubled, otherwise you'll lose them.
	If you succeed in doubling them, or your card is equal to the
	dealer's card (i.e. same number), you'll be asked if you want
	to gamble again, and so on.



  JACKPOT
  -------

    Each combination has its own jackpot which icreases while you play
    DPoker (every 4 hands a credit is randomly added to one of the 9
    jackpots).
    In order to win a jackpot *you must bet 10 credits* and obtain the
    corresponding winning combination!!!

    Click on <Statistics> button to view jackpots.



  Other gadgets
  -------------

    - *When you've spent all your credits*, click on <New game> to obtain
      10 more credits.

    - Click on <Statistics> for some statistical-stuff (jackpots, 
      total hands, highscore, total winnings etc.).

    - <About> button will remember you that DPoker is SHAREWARE!
      ----------------------------------------------------------

    - To quit DPoker click on the CLOSE-GADGET of the main window.



  DPoker saves your credits
  =========================

    When you quit DPoker, it tries to save a file (called "dpoker.dat")
    which keeps track of your credits, highscore, jackpots etc. etc.

    When you start DPoker, it loads dpoker.dat file and restores all that
    information.

    Don't try to modify dpoker.dat file (i.e. try to get 1000 credits
    for free): it has a checksum that prevents such modifications.

    If you want to start a "completely-new-DPoker-session", delete (or
    rename) dpoker.dat file.



  Winning combinations:
  ---------------------

  Jacks or better	: two jacks, two queens, two kings or two aces.
			You'll win the same credits you bet.

  Two pair		: two cards with the same value form a pair.
			For example, two pair combinations are:
			two 'jack' + two '3', two '10' + two '5', etc. etc.
			You'll win 2 times the stake.

  Three of a kind	: three cards with the same value.
			For example: three 'ace', three '5', three '10', etc.
			You'll win 3 times the stake.

  Straight		: the five cards form a sequence.
			For example: 'ace' + '2' + '3' + '4' + '5',
			'8' + '9' + '10' + 'jack' + 'queen',
			'3' + '4' + '5' + '6' + '7',
			'10' + 'jack' + 'queen' + 'king' + 'ace', etc. etc.
			You'll win 5 times the stake.

  Flush			: the five cards have the same suit.
			You'll win 7 times the stake.

  Full House		: a pair + three of a kind.
			For example: '2' + '2' + '2' + '10 + '10',
			'ace' + 'ace' + '4' + '4' + '4' et. etc.
			You'll win 10 times the stake.

  Four of a kind	: four cards with the same value.
			For example: '6' + '6' + 'queen' + '6' + '6'  etc.
			You'll win 30 times the stake.

  Straight flush	: straight + flush.
			For example: '4' + '5' + '6' + '7' + '8' (all hearts).
			You'll win 40 times the stake.

  Royal flush		: straight + flush + the highest card is an ace.
			For example: '10' + 'jack' + 'queen' + 'king' + 'ace'
			(all hearts).
			You'll win 50 times the stake.

  NOTE: the order in which cards appear doesn't count, i.e.
	'2' + 'ace' + '4' + 'ace' + 'queen' 	is the same of
	'ace' + 'queen' + '4' + '2' + 'ace'.
