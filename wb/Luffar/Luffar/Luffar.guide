@NODE 0. "Introduction"
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This is a game you want to play :)
   A Noughts and Crosses game. 5 in a row. X in a row... whatever :)
   Note, this version is absolutely NOT in any way compatible with old
   versions!!!


@ENDNODE

@NODE 1. "Disclaimer"
Disclaimer
~~~~~~~~~~
   The program is Freeware, so do you want with it (almost), but

   YOU ARE USING THIS PROGRAM ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK ! THE AUTHOR
   CAN NOT BE MADE LIABLE FOR ANY HARM THIS SOFTWARE IS MAKING TO YOUR
   SOFT- OR HARDWARE !

   If you change something in the source to the better? tell me!
   I believe that if anyone likes, uses or does something else with this
   program, I will be told. That would be the right thing to do.
   If you put this on a CD or review it or something like that, I would
   also like to know.

@NODE 2. "Requirements"
Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will need the following things to run the program:

   - Kickstart 2.04 or newer

   - A TCP/IP stack

@ENDNODE

@NODE 3. "Installation"
Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Just see to it that you have Luffar and the gfx dir in the same place.

@ENDNODE

@NODE 4. "Usage"
How to use it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   I have made some scripts for AmIRC now. If you install them it will be
   quite easy to start Luffar.
   otherwise
   To run it:
   on the serverside, run Luffar S P=port T=Tiles W=Wins in a row Nick=Nick.
   on the clientside, tun Luffar H=serverhost P=port Nick=Nickey.
   For example:
   If using all default values...
   On server amiga:
   Luffar S Nick=Guy1 ; planesize 18x18 and 5 in row to win. (default)
   On other amiga:
   Luffar guy1.host.com Nick=Guy2

   To use your own values:
   Luffar S P=2345 T=18 W=5 Nick=nick ; will be as default values...
   Luffar H=server.host.com P=2345 Nick=nick ; like default

   To open on a pubscreen:
   Add Pub=AmIRC on the argument line.
   Example: Luffar server.host.com Pub=AmIRC

   To check what the screens are named, go to MUI->Settings->System.
   Or use some other Screeninfo program...

History
~~~~~~~

   20-Mar-99   V2.03
   o Some minor things... Aminet upload.


   17-Mar-99   V2.02
   o Had some problems with MiamiDX. It seems it was MiamiDX fault.
     This realease won't work with MiamiDX...yet.
   o Remade the No Graphics version to be compatible with this one.
     And put it in the same archive.
   o Other minor fixes. Won't draw your cps down now...


   13-Mar-99   V2.01
   o ReMade the transfer method again :) = incompatible with old versions.
     This should be the last time though. Now I got a nice protocol :)
   o Chat gadgets now implemented.


   07-Mar-99   V2.0
   o Got some new energy so I'll start working on it again maybe :)
   o Rewrote the TCP/IP transfer from ascii to binary.
   o Removed a "bug". Never Trust TCP/IP :) This was a transfer
     bug, so If you had problems, try this out.
   Note, this version is absolutely NOT in any way compatible with old
   versions!!!

   o '-' in nick was bad... now fixed.

   10-Dec-98   V1.31
   o Oh, a bug that could sometimes plot a X/O when you dragged the window.
   o Accidently also had the 1.3 date to 12-Dec.. hm, was tired :)


   08-Dec-98   V1.3
   o Added graphics. Though this made it non-scalable. You can not resize
     the window now.
   o Removed a bug I accidently put in 1.2. You couldn't click in column
     0 or row 0.


   22-Nov-98   V1.2
   o Added a Nick option (required!) for the saving. Now the "score" is
     saved in the file Luffar.stat. It is "ascii" so it is readable.
     However, please do not manipulate it. If you do it wrong things can
     get ... not so good.
   o Removed a bug, that might have been in 1.1 don't remember :)
     You could sometimes put a cross in the dragbar.
   o You no longer have to start the program again if you want to play
     again. Added an EasyReq requester asking if you want to play again.
   o Removed another "bug" in the Plotting function.
   (o The source is now more "modulated" in seperate files)


   14-Nov-98   V1.1
   o Made it ReadArgs() instead. That is standard AmigaDOS argument handling.
   o Let the user close the window on  wins/loss.
   o PubScreen to open the window on via 'Pub=PubScreen Name' switch
   o Default values: Port=666, Tiles=20, Wins=5.
   o Latest brick laid is shown in white.
   o Bugs in the zone and checkwinner routines removed.
     One that COULD be fatal if you were unlucky.


   13-Nov-98   I think I made it thruh this day :)


   12-Nov-98   V1.0b
   o Change color.


   10-Nov-98   V1.0ß
   o Configurable number of squares and number of squares in a row to win.
   o Better zone-handling.


   07-Nov-98   Initial release. V0.99ß :)
