===== Forward ===========================================================
@NODE forw "forward"

@{BG BACK}
One of the best known of all puzzles is the Fifteen Puzzle, which was invented by Sam Loyd the elder about 1878. It is also known as the Boss Puzzle, Jeu de Taquin, and Diablotin. It became popular all over Europe almost at once. It consists essentially of a shallow square tray that holds 15 small square counters numbered from 1 to 15, and one square blank space. With the 15 squares initially placed in random order and with the blank space in the lower right-hand corner, the puzzle is to rearrange them in numerical order by sliding only, with the blank space ending up back in the lower right-hand corner. It may overwhelm the reader to learn that there are more than 20,000,000,000,000 possible different arrangements that the pieces (including the blank space) can assume.

In 1879 two American mathematicians proved that only one-half of all possible initial arrangements, or about 10,000,000,000,000, admitted of a solution. The mathematical analysis is as follows. Basically, no matter what path it takes, as long as it ends its journey in the lower right-hand corner of the tray, any numeral must pass through an even number of boxes. In the normal position of the squares, regarded row by row from left to right, each number is larger than all the preceding numbers; i.e., no number precedes any number smaller than itself. In any other than the normal arrangement, one or more numbers will precede others smaller than themselves. Every such instance is called an inversion. For example, in the sequence 9, 5, 3, 4, the 9 precedes three numbers smaller than itself and the 5 precedes two numbers smaller than itself, making a total of five inversions. If the total number of all the inversions in a given arrangement is even, the puzzle can be solved by bringing the squares back to the normal arrangement; if the total number of inversions is odd, the puzzle cannot be solved. Theoretically, the puzzle can be extended to a tray of (m x n) spaces with (mn - 1) numbered counters.

In order to stop impossibilities from occurring, I have added a "placement" function into WBPerplexity which allows you to select either "Jumble" and "Randomized". Jumble takes the completed puzzle and moves the tiles around for a short period of time, which makes it entirely possible for the puzzle to be solved. Randomized, however will cause the tiles to be placed regardless and therefore impossible solutions may occur.

===== Installing ======================================================

@NODE inst "installing wbperplexity"
@{BG SHINE}
    installing wbperplexity
@{BG BACK}
To install WBPerplexity, double click the Installer Icon and follow the
instructions and prompts provided. If you require assistance during the
installation, simply click the "Help..." gadget.

The WBPerplexity installer enables you to install the components you
wish to install, however we strongly recommend that you select those
components that are already checked marked.

Before installing, please ensure that you have an up-to-date copy of
the Installer program that should be located in your System:C
directory. The install script has been fully tested on Installer v43.3.

The installer allows you to install either MagicWB or NewIcons. I
personally prefer NewIcons as it looks much nicer ;D (Any one wishing
to do a new MagicWB Icon set for WBPerplexity is most welcome).

Play16 is now included in the WBPerplexity archive for anyone who does
not have a copy already. It is one of the best CLI based sound players
for the Amiga, so lots of respect to Thomas Wenzel.

I have made every attempt to ensure that the installer will work with
as little trouble as possible, however if you notice any bugs in the
installer script then please contact me.

===== Program Info ======================================================

@NODE info "program info"
@{BG SHINE}
    program info
@{BG BACK}
WBPerplexity is a workbench* puzzle game in which you have to rearrange a picture which has been split into a certain amount of sections. In the case of this game the amount of sections is @{b}8, 15 @{ub}or @{b}24@{ub} with one left over square in which you can move your pieces in and out of.

This game now features a new animated puzzle format called ".APuz". Unfortunately, APuz does not fully support amigas with graphic cards at the moment. Using "Animation Rate" in the Preferences menu, you can define the playback rate of the puzzle.

WBPerplexity is ideal if your bored whilst waiting for something to download or process as this game uses very little CPU (upto less than 0.30%) when its window is inactive or if it is Iconified.

*Also compatible with Directory Opus and Scalos.

===== Usage =============================================================

@NODE play "how to play"
@{BG SHINE}
    how to play
@{BG BACK}
To play WBPerplexity, slide the tiles around by moving them into the gap in order to complete the picture. You can select different puzzles by loading a new game in the pull down menu. WBPerplexity is also an app window, which means that you can drag puzzle and game files into it's window for them to load. 

If the puzzle you are trying to complete is too difficult for you, press the help key for a preview of what the completed picture looks like.
@{BG SHINE}
    saving your game
@{BG BACK}
It is now possible to save you game and load it back at a later date by going to "Save As..." in the pull-down game menu. Saving your game will record the positions of your tiles, the puzzle file loaded and the moves and time taken.
@{BG SHINE}
    additional puzzle sets
@{BG BACK}
Additional puzzle sets for WBPerplexity can be found on the engine nine design web site ( http://www.engine9design.co.uk ) or from Aminet. Most puzzle sets are in standard IFF ILBM format, however some may be in either PNG, JFIF/JPEG or GIF format, in which case you will require additional system datatypes to be installed for you to be able to play them.
@{BG SHINE}
    make your own puzzles!
@{BG BACK}
If you would like to produce your own puzzle sets for WBPerplexity, then please read the text file found in the Puzzles drawer. Don't forget to send us a copy of your set(s)! :)
@{BG SHINE}
    additional information
@{BG BACK}
Some puzzles may be extremely difficult to complete in 4x4 or 5x5 grid modes as they may contain identical tiles e.g. two or more blank (white/black) tiles. New puzzle sets may contain warnings if such difficult puzzles are present.
@{BG SHINE}
    and finally

If you enjoy playing this game, please consider registering. Details on how to register this game can be found in the How to register section.

===== Menus =============================================================
@NODE menu "menus"
@{BG SHINE}
    puzzle menu
@{BG BACK}
@{B}Load Puzzle...@{UB}
This menu item allows you to select a puzzle or animated puzzle file for you to load. You can also drag puzzle games into the WBPerplexity App window for then to load.

@{B}Restart@{UB}
This function re-jumbles the puzzle and resets the move and time counters to zero.

@{B}Help...@{UB}
This item shows you what the completed puzzle looks like, however you will lose a move for doing this. You can also press the @{B}Help@{UB} key on your keyboard to do this. The help function in a way is classed as cheating, and therefore you should avoid using this too much ;P

@{B}How To Play...@{UB}
Displays playing instructions for those strange people who do not read program documentation!

@{B}Puzzle Info...@{UB}
Displays information about the currently loaded puzzle.

@{B}About...@{UB}
Displays the "about WBPerplexity" requester

@{B}Iconify@{UB}
This allows you to iconify the WBPerplexity window so that it appears as an icon on your Workbench screen. To re-open the WBPerplexity window once again, simply double click the App icon.

@{B}Quit@{UB}
Exits from WBPerplexity. You can also quit the game by clicking the close gadget on the game window. If you have the "Save Prefs On Exit" item checked, your preferences will be saved before the game quits.
@{BG SHINE}
   puzzle hotlist
@{BG BACK}
New to WBPerplexity v1.6 is a puzzle hotlist which can be found at the bottom of the Puzzle menu. The hotlist is a clever stack system that displays the last five puzzles that were loaded. To load one of these puzzles quickly, simply select one of the puzzle names from the hotlist.
@{BG SHINE}
    game menu
@{BG BACK}
@{B}Load...@{UB}
This menu item enables you to load a previously saved game. Ensure that the "Load Puzzle" item is checked if you are wanting to open the puzzle file with your saved game.

@{B}Save@{UB}
If you have already saved your game, you can then use this menu item to re-save. In doing this, you will not be prompted by a save game file requester.

@{B}Save As...@{UB}
This function allows you to select a destination and file name to save your game to. The grid mode, tile position, moves and time will be saved as well as the location of the loaded puzzle file. When saving your game(s) it is important that you use the ".gam" suffix for your file names so that when loading back your game, it will appear in the file requester.

@{B}Load Puzzle@{UB}
There are two methods of loading a previously saved game. If the Load Puzzle item is checked, WBPerplexity will attempt to open the puzzle file as well as the saved game data. If it is not checked, only the game data will be loaded and the currently loaded puzzle will be changed to suit the grid mode, tile position, time and moves.
@{BG SHINE}
    prefs menu
@{BG BACK}
The preferences menu enables you configure WBPerplexity in many ways, as well as alter the game grid mode. You also can configure the game even further by changing the icon tooltype settings.

@{B}Use Datatypes@{UB}
Use this function for puzzles that are not in an ILBM format. Datatypes also has a scale function which enables you to load any picture you wish and it will be resized to fit the game window (providing you have a compatible datatype installed and enough CHIP mem). 

The Animated Puzzle (APUZ) format is not supported by Datatypes and therefore you will have to use internal image decoding. Internal image decoding can only handle up to eight bit screen-modes and therefore non AGA users may experience difficulties.

@{B}Quick Move@{UB}
When moving more than one tile at once this setting will cause them to move as one block instead of one after another. You may wish to enable quick move when playing animated puzzles.

@{B}Auto About@{UB}
This setting will cause the puzzle information requester to automatically pop up every time a new puzzle is loaded.

@{B}Auto Grid Change@{UB}
Automatically changes grid mode and restarts the puzzle if you select a different grid mode.

@{B}Show Setup@{UB}
Displays the tiles being shifted around if you are in Quick or Long Jumble placement mode. Be warned: This may take some time. You can press ESC at any time to stop this.

@{B}Grid@{UB}
You can select either 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5 grid modes to play. 5x5 is much harder as it takes more time and moves to complete.

@{B}Remapping@{UB}
Selects the quality of puzzle remapping for @{B}internal image decoding@{ub}. The "Best" mode will remap with a much greater accuracy, however it will use more CPU and take slightly longer.

@{B}Placement@{UB}
Allows you to select the tile placement method. Read the @{"forward" LINK forw} for more information on this.

@{B}Sounds@{UB}
Toggle between the sound modes. "None" will turn off all sounds, "Beep Only" will play a system error sound if you make an illegal move and "All" will use an external sound player to play samples.

@{B}Animation@{UB}
Allows you to set the play back rate for Animated Puzzles. Faster playback results in more CPU usage.

@{B}Save Prefs On Exit@{UB}
WBPerplexity will save your preferences when you quit.

===== Tooltype =============================================================
@NODE tool "tooltypes"
@{BG SHINE}
    tooltype prefs
@{BG BACK}
With WBPerplexity v1.5b+ and above you can alter various settings that are not present in the prefs menu of the game. In order to modify these settings, click on the WBPerplexity icon and go to "Information" in the "Icons" menu of your workbench. There you can alter the various tooltypes.

@{B}Browser@{UB}
Sets the location of your default internet browser i.e. "BROWSER=Apps:Internet/Voyager/V".

@{B}Home@{UB}
Sets the location of our home page. Defaults to "www.engine9design.co.uk".

@{B}Email@{UB}
Sets the location of your email client so that you can @{"contact me!!" SYSTEM "Run >NIL: Yam:Yam MAILTO=engine9@ukonline.co.uk SUBJECT=WBPerplexity1.6(g)"}

@{B}Soundplayer@{UB}
WBPerplexity v1.4 orginally used the command Play16 for playing audio samples within the game. This can now be changed to something like "SOUNDPLAYER=C:Playsound".

@{B}WINX@{UB}
Sets the horizontal X position of the WBPerplexity window. If this setting can not be found the X position of the game window will be centered.

@{B}WINY@{UB}
Sets the vertical Y position of the WBPerplexity window. If this setting can not be found the Y position of the game window will be centered.

@{B}XYMOUSE@{UB}
Opens the WBPerplexity window at the mouse cursor location if set to "YES". I.e. "XYMOUSE=YES"

@{B}BLANK@{UB}
Remaps the blank tile to the colour specified in base 16. If this setting can not be found it will default to the colour of pen four. Ideal for graphic card users or those who do not have MagicWB installed.

@{B}SHADOW@{UB}
Same as above, except this sets the shadow colour for 4x4 and 5x5 grid modes.

@{B}GRID@{UB}
Turns off the overlay grid if set to "NO". Defaults to YES. Try this -- Its cool! :D

@{B}FONT@{UB}
Sets the font to be used in the status bar. I.e. FONT=topaz.font

@{B}LANGUAGE@{UB}
This function allows you to set the local language of WBPerplexity and excludes your Workbench Locale settings. I.e. "Language=Norsk" This would cause WBPerplexity to load the Norwegian located in Catalogs/Norsk/WBPerplexity.catalog of the WBPerplexity directory.

@{"<<" link main} go back
@ENDNODE

===== Language ===========================================================

@NODE lang "changing the language"
@{BG SHINE}
    changing the language
@{BG BACK}
It is possible to change the WBPerplexity language in two ways. The first method is via the Workbench Locale preferences. To use this, simply select your "Preferred Languages" and they will be used in WBPerplexity providing the catalog file is available. WBPerplexity catalogs are located in "LOCALE:Catalogs". The second, is using the WBPerplexity icon tooltypes. See the @{"tooltype" LINK tool} section for further information.
