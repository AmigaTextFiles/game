                          SuperSnake V1.1

 Yes,this is another version of the famous snake-game and I hope it`s the
 best Workbench-SNAKE version available.
 The first time I played SNAKE 6 years ago on a good old KC87 computer.
 I was really hooked on the game and since the I ever wanted to make my own
 SNAKE-game,so here it is.

 It make use of the reqtools and stonecracker.library,so make sure you have
 installed both in your LIBS: directory.
 SuperSnake requires AmigaDos 2.0 or higher and a Workbench screen with a
 minimum of 4 colours and a high of 242 pixels.

 This game was tested on an A1200 with 2MB Chip-Ram and an A4000/40. Please
 contact me if it wont run on your machine.
 
 I dont`t think there is anybody who hasn`t played a SNAKE game yet but I
 will introduce the game to you anyway.
 Your task is very simple. Move the snake around by pressing the cursor keys
 and collect the the food (.). After collecting all points an exit will open
 and you can go through to the next level. But beware of the blocks (#).
 If you crash with a block or if you bite yourself you`ll loose one live.
 At the beginning you have 3 lives and after completing a level youl`ll get
 one extra live.
 
 SuperSnake has 55 Levels and you`ll get a password every ten levels to
 continue. To start simply click the "Start" gadget. If you want to,you can
 change the snake-speed by clicking the scrollbar.
 Click the "Code" gadget and enter one of the passwords you`ll get in the
 game to continue the game from a higher level.
 In game you can press the space bar to pause.

 This is Freeware,so copy the game as you want. Please drop me a message if
 you change the code.

 Have fun.
