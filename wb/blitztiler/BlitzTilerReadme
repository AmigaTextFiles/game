-- BlitzTiler Readme --

BlitzTiler is a simple FREEWARE Workbench game written in BlitzBasic2,
without great time spending and without a good knowledge of BlitzBasic.

The game is not configurable, and its graphics and sound effect are very
primitive (originally it was written for my old Apple II...),
but is very simple and can be used on every machine with dbl screens or PAL,
but much better on AGA with Double Hi-Res 32 colors screen.

The game concept is similar to chinese tile games (like Shangai),
where the objective is to clear all the tiles from the table.

To clear two tiles of same type they must be free on a side that can be
reached from the other by a path with a max two corner of 90 degrees.


NOTES

The game window is opened on the Workbench, and although was designed for
double hi-res screen, it can be used on PAL screens (no ntsc... aargh).
You can also have some problem with background color, that depends by your
Workbench palette (re-aargh...). However I have put an option in menu that
fix the correct value of background color.
I would like to use a tooltype parameter for color and screen handling,
but this version of BlitzBasic seems don't work with tooltypes.
I have tested the game on my 1200 060 with many aga screens,
except ntsc(too small for game window).

If you want you can write me comments, suggestions or what about the game.

Enjoy...  and good luck!
