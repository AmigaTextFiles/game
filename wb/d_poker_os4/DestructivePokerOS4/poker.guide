@{b}Version 1.0 (20th February 1997)@{ub}

  1st public release.

@{b}Version 1.01 (2nd April 1997)@{ub}

  Fixed savefile lock bug; File lock wasn't released after save and it made saved file unreadable until reset.

@{b}Version 1.10 (20nd April 1997)@{ub}

  Fixed misfeature in window showing hand evaluation. It now remembers its last position. Added option to enable/disable @{"Double Dialog" link double }. Savefile lock bug detected (again :-( ).

@{b}Version 1.11 (24nd April 1997)@{ub}

  Fixed savefile lock bug by replacing faulty GNU C/C++ libnix ?fstream class by my own cFile class. Changed savefile format. It now saves the most of options.

There are next gadget in the main window:

@wordwrap
  After pressing Done 5 cards are dealed. Dealing to the empty table costs you @{"Bet" link changebet }. Now You may unselect some of them and pressing Done again will through your unselected cards (cover down) to the junk pile and deliver new ones. If it was your last change the messagebox (requester) will show you hand evaluation. If You got hand which is good enough you are able to double your win pot in @{"Double Dialog" link double }.
@EndNode

@Node handevaluation "Hand Evaluation"
@{b}Hands and their evaluation@{ub}

Hands and their victories are:

	Lousy Hand	- 0
	Pair		- 0
	2 Pairs		- 5
	3 of a Kind	- 10
	Straight	- 20
	Flush		- 30
	Full House	- 40
	4 of a Kind	- 80
	Straight Flush	- 160
	Royal Flush	- 320

There are also next special hands and their evaluation depends of @{"preferences" link prefs }

	5 of a Kind	- 140 or 180
	5 jokers	- 0 or 320
@EndNode

@Node changebet "Change Bet"
@{b}Change Bet Dialog@{ub}
@wordwrap

Here you can determine amount of changes and jokers. These values affects the bet. The Bet is Changes+Jokers. Maximum changes is 3 and maximum amount of jokers is 8.

f. e. If you have selected 1 change and 4 jokers, then bet = 1 + 4 = 5.


@EndNode

@Node prefs "Hand Evaluation Preferences"
@{b}Hand Evaluation Preferences Dialog@{ub}
@wordwrap

Here you may select your own evaluation about these hands.

I couldn't get information about the rules of special hands of '5 of a kind' and '5 jokers' and people has different opinions about these hands. That why this preferences dialog is added.

My honest opinion about these hands:
5 of a kind is almost similar with 4 of a kind. Therefore I have set 5 of a kind is lower than straight flush as default value. Also I think that joker is good card only with some real card, otherwice it is junk. So 5 jokers is Lousy hand as default.

@EndNode

@Node double "Double"
@{b}Double Dialog@{ub}
@wordwrap

Here you can double (or not) your win pot. You will see card turned cover down and you must guess is it small (A,2,3,4,5,6) or Big (8,9,10,J,Q,K). Joker is both and 7 is neither. Don't Double will pay win pot and exit the double dialog.

Double dialog can be disabled/enabled from menus.

@Node loading "Loading"
@{b}Loading and Saving the game@{ub}
@wordwrap

  You may save your game by selecting 'Game->Save' from menus. Requester will open and you may save your game.

  To continue your saved game select 'Game->Continue Old' from menus. Requester will Open you may open the game to continue.

NOTE!
To avoid cheating savefile is cypted by filename. It will be also deleted after loading. Saving the game is actually save+finish. I think these changes does not ruin your game pleasure.

@Node tooltypes "Saving Preferences as Icon Tool Types"
@{b}Saving preferences as Icon Tool Types@{ub}

Preferences like @{"Hand Evaluation" link handevaluation }, @{"Change Bet" link changebet } and @{"Double" link double }

	PREFSDOUBLE	- If TRUE Doubling enabled.

Changing Card Graphics

  If You are skillful artist you may want to replace original Card Graphics.

  Destructive Poker uses normal IFF-ILBM-files (923*480). Colors may vary from 2 to 256. Color 0 in Card graphics is used as background color for window. Change @{"Tool Type" link tooltypes } 'CARDS' in program icon to determine graphicsfile.
