 ›1m* INTRODUCTION:›0m

Towers of hanoï is a multitask game as I like to play, when I format
disks, calculate some pics,... 
The nice language Blitz has been used to program it.


 ›1m* SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:›0m

Towers of Hanoï requires KickStart 2.0 or + to run, is there still some
people with 1.3 on Amiga?... They must be crazy...
To start, this little game required 4 Mb of RAM in 4 colors, else 8 Mb...
Of course, ›4mI joke›0m, we aren't on PC !!!
256 Kb should be enough...


 ›1m* RULES :›0m

You just have to make passed all the disks which are on the left tower,
to the right tower. Could it be more easy ?
Well, there is just one thing more : you haven't got the right to put
a larger disk on a smaller disk...
Try to make the least attempts as possible, for a better score.
To move a disk, just click on the tower where it is, then click on the
tower where you want to move it.
At the start, you can choose how many disks you want to play with. (3 is
really easy, 7 is...possible !)
