@NODE Intro "Introduction"

 @{b}Welcome to ACM V0.2!@{ub}

 So, this is an attempt to make a clone of Kennedy Approach, a game known from
 8-bit Commodore and Atari computers.

 This is just a preview, I released this just to know if there are people that
 like it. So, if you want another version, send @{" me " Link Author} a mail.

 Your task is to control air traffic in a 20x12 miles  area  with  one  or  more
 airports.  You have to lead planes from its source to destination, help them in
 emergencies and avoid collisions. Each plane wants  to  fly  according  to  its
 schedule, i.e. it should be in its destination (airport or an exit) on time.
 There may be up to 26 planes in the area.

 A list of orders follows:
 - hold on, no change of heading
 - turn left to xxx degrees
 - turn right to xxx degrees
 - hold on until VOR reached, then hold left
 - hold on until VOR reached, then hold right
 - along with all these commands, you can send the plane to altitude of 1000,
   2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 ft or tell him to get ready to land

 Planes come to map in altitude of 5000 ft and they should depart at 4000 ft.
 When landing, plane has to be in the runway axis at least one mile before the
 runway edge and in the last mile it has to descend below 1000 ft.
 For more info see @{" Main Window " Link MainWin} and @{" Order Window " Link CommWin}.

 There are probably some bugs, if you encounter some, send @{" me " Link Author} a mail.

 This program is a mailware (i.e. E-Mailware or Postcardware). If you want me to
 make  another  version,  please  send  me  a  mail.  I'm  very lazy so I need a
 feedback, I have to know whether there are people that want to play it.

 Please let me know which version you play (e.g. 020+881.NI) as I don't know if
 I should keep supporting the .NI versions

@ENDNODE

@NODE New "What's new in this release"

 I just fixed a few bugs - e.g. Order window did not close when exiting ACM,
 and added the Settings menu. You can:
 - turn the narrator off
 - set a reference rate for the narrator (the higher number the faster it speaks)

 - decide how should the time acceleration behave when editing an order and
   after issuing and order (see the @{" Main WIndow " Link MainWin} section)
   since many people did not like the previous version's behaviour

@ENDNODE

@NODE require "Requirements"

 This game should be OS-friendly and is not written very nice, so it is a bit
 slow. It takes 30-70% of CPU time on my 68030/28 + 68882/40

 @{b}Required:@{ub}
 - An Amiga
 - OS 2.0 (not tested)
 - 1 MB of Chip RAM
 - 68020
 - reqtools.library 37

 @{b}Recommended:@{ub}
 - Fast RAM
 - FPU
 - AGA chipset
 - OS 3.0+
 - VGA monitor - the non-laced version looks quite ugly
 - narrator.device 37+

@ENDNODE

@NODE Install "Installation"

Just choose the executable that matches your computer (NI means non-interlaced,
for PAL and NTSC non-interlaced screenmodes) and copy it anywhere.

@NODE MainWin "Main window"

 Description of gadgets and fields of the main window (top to bottom, left to
right):

- clock: measures the game time, one game takes 20 minutes. You can set the time
  acceleration using the slider below the clock.

- gadgets A-Z: each letter stands for one plane. When you press  a  gadget,  the
  @{" Command Window " Link CommWin} will open. Below this gadget bar, you can see a basic info
  for each valid plane:  one-letter  source  and  dest  IDs  and  its altitude
  in  thousands  feet  or  * for planes waiting for takeoff. If all this infos
  are blue on gray (i.e. WB color 3 on color 0), then this plane is not in the
  area  yet  and  will  come/be  ready  to  takeoff  within  one minute. Blue
  background means that the plane is low on fuel and needs to be landed urgently.
  If the altitude number is black, the plane is delayed.

- Below the time-acceleration slider there is a box where error and warning
  messages are displayed - conflicts and crashes, wrong landings or exits etc.

- In the bar below the plane infos Air Traffic Control's orders and pilots'
  messages are displayed. If you don't like the narrator speaking these messages,
  just rename the narrator.device before running the ACM. I hope there will be
  some narrator settings in next version

- The biggest area in the window is the map. There are planes with one-leter IDs
  and altitudes, airport(s) - planes can take off and land only in one direction
  - there is a short line on the right end of runway. One square of the blue grid
  means one mile. The black dots show standard corridors and small circles are
  VORs. When you send the plane out of the map, it has to get out in the right
  exit, altitude 4000 ft, in direction of corridor. When you click near a plane,
  the Order window appears.

The Game and Speed menus should be self-explaining. In the Settings menu you can:
- turn the narrator on and off
- set the narrator rate
- set the time acceleration behaviour:
    - No changes - the speed doesn't change when opening the Order Window
    - Single at order window - when the Order Window is opened, speed is set
      to normal (this is how the ACM 0.1 behaved)
    - S. @ O.W. & back - speed is set to normal at Order window, when the window
      is closed, the speed is set back to previous value.
- save current settings

@ENDNODE

@NODE CommWin "Order window"

 In this window you can see more info about the plane - an unique ID, source,
 destination, fuel (in minutes) and what time the plane should be on destination
 (i.e. an airport or an exit).

 With the radio button onn right, you can set target altitude of the plane,
 with the gadgets below the infos you set command and target heading of the
 current plane.

@NODE History "History"

 @{b}V0.1@{ub} (11.03.1996)
      - first public release - preview

 @{b}V0.2@{ub} (21.05.1996)
      - a minor bugfix (Order window did't close when exiting program)
      - Settings menu added

@ENDNODE

@NODE TODO "Things to do"

 @{b}Important@{ub} - things I really ought to do

 - bugfixes

 - all Kennedy Approach features (i.e. storm clouds, mountains, ...)

 - more plane types (small jets, props, Concordes, maybe helicopters)

 - more playing areas (Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Washington D.C., NYC)

 - full keyboard control

 - sound effects

 - avoid flickering

 - a Global High Score List on my homepage

 @{b}Further future@{ub} - maybe if I ever have enough time and ethusiasm

 - change behaviour of the narrator - no queue

 - some noise when pilots speak

 - map of the area, elevation map - planes could collide with skyscrapers etc.

 - maybe I'll put it on a separate screen and change the GUI completely

... any suggestions ?

@ENDNODE

@NODE Contrib "Contributors wanted"

As you've probably noticed, I'm not very good at English so I need somebody to
tell me "Hey dude, we don't say shit of paper but sheet of paper" or something
like that. The same problem is with pronunciation so I'm looking for somebody
that can write phonetically for Narrator.

Any aviation and ATC-related advices welcome.
