The idea of this game is to keep the water flowing along your pipe for
as long as possible.
You will get 5 points for each piece of pipe laid down.
You will get -10 points for placing a new piece of pipe over an old piece.
You will get -10 points for any piece of pipe that is not flowed through
when your game is finished.

The controls are as follows:

Use the left mouse button to select a piece of pipe from the four available
pieces at the top of the board, then click where you want it to be placed.

If you have got stuck and want to finish quickly select "speed up" from the
menu.

This program will only work on WB 2.0 and above.

This program was written on an Amiga A1200 68882 6MB.

This program was intended to be used with the workbench in 8 colour
mode although it can be used in 4 it won't look as good!

The high score table will be loaded and saved from the directory in which
the game is stored if the file is not there a default table will be used.

The sound can be turned off and on by altering the tool type.

The game window graphics will scale themselves to your screens aspect ratio.

BUGS!!!!!!!
None known at present.
