Note: @{b}There will be no updates of DaWormy because I have
      lost all the source code ( BIG HARDDISK CRASH ). @{ub}

      I am using the NEWICONS package what means that I
      know that the colors are messy (Try using MWB colors).

Note
****

DaWormy was developed in 'Amiga E 2.1b - 3.0e' by Wouter van
Oortmerssen. Try this wonderful Language !!!!!.

A short description of Amiga E ( taken from the Amiga E doc by Wouter
van Oortmerssen):

`E is an object oriented / procedural / unpure functional higher
programming language, mainly influenced by languages such as C++, Ada,
Lisp etc. It is a general-purpose programming language, and the Amiga
implementation is specifically targeted at programming system
applications. The number of features of the language is really to great
to sum up entirely, and include: speed of >20000 lines/minute on a 7
Mhz amiga, inline assembler and linker integrated into compiler, large
set of integrated functions, great module concept with v39 includes as
modules, flexible type-system, quoted expressions, immediate and typed
lists, low-level and object polymorphism, exception handling,
inheritance, data-hiding, methods, multiple return values, default
arguments, register allocation, fast memory manegement, unification,
LISP-Cells, and much more...'
