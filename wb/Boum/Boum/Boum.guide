@node intro Introduction

    @{i}Boum@{ui}  is  just  another minesweeper, yes; but the other ones I
tried had some problems (IMO):
        - crashes
        - non user-friendly
        - ugly graphics
        - opened interlaced screens
        - aso...

(not all these in just one program though ! ;-) )

    So I decided to make a minesweeper that would please @{i}me@{ui}.
@{i}Boum@{ui} features: - safe start
               - highscores tables
               - system friendly code (works on true colour screens etc.,
                 no enforcer hits)
               - adapts to the screen resolution (eg 640x256 or 640x512)
               - other things you'll see by yourself

    If you don't like the new graphics, send me a mail with your wishes.

    Vu  que  je n'ai pas encore implémenté l'usage de la locale.library, la
version  française  est  disponible ici:  http://off.free.fr/boum/

@node require Requirements

    @{i}Boum@{ui} requires an Amiga with OS 3.0 and a 68020, or better.

    It  should  be  playable on a 2 colours workbench...  but I recommend a
screen  with more colours.  Depending on your background pics, a 32 colours
screen  should  be  okay  (the graphics use 11 different colours).  I'm now
using a 16bit WB, so...

    @{i}Boum@{ui} looks better on a screen with square pixels (eg 640x480).
@endnode
@node freeware "Freeware"

    @{i}Boum@{ui}  is  released  under  the concept of FREEWARE; that is to
say:

    - You are allowed to use this software package for free.

    - You are allowed to distribute this software package ONLY in its
      original, complete and unmodified form, as you got it, with all the
      documentation, icons, etc.

      The "Boum.readme" file should be provided too, but this is not
      mandatory.

      The only accepted modification is the use of an archiver (such as
      lha or lzx) to archive the whole software package (the "Boum"
      directory with all its contents plus the "Boum.info" file). This
      archiver must not modify the data after the process of archiving-
      desarchiving.

      (users of lha should use the -a switch to keep file attributes,
      though this is not needed in the case of *this* distribution of
      Boum)

    - You are NOT allowed to SELL this software package ! This license
      only gives you the right to use and distribute for free this
      package.

      It is however allowed to include this software package on CD-ROMs
      containing freely distributable software, such as Aminet CD-ROMs,
      as long as the price of the CD does not exceed US$20. The same
      applies to floppy disks, but for US$4 maximum.

      Magazines, too, are allowed to include this package on their
      coverdisk/CD, but it would be nice to @{"send me" link contact} a copy of the mag
      if you do so.

      It is allowed to include this software package on freely accessible
      electronic archives, such as Aminet.

    - There is no warranty of any kind related to this software. The
      author(s) may not be held liable for anything that might or might
      not happen before, during or after using this software.

    - Use of the program or one of its related files, as well as
      distribution of this software package, imply the acceptance of this
      license.

    PLEASE NOTE: the sound files were not made by me and their legal status
is unknown to me; so this license does not cover modification and/or
distribution of these sound files alone.

    If you do not agree with this license, delete the whole software
package.

    If you're a layer, you're welcome to make a real usefull license for
@{i}Boum@{ui} out of this one. ;)

@node playing "How to play the game"

    You should know how to play minesweeper, I guess...

    2 remarks:

    To access the menu while playing, you must first move the mouse pointer
out of the window.

    To  get  right  mouse  button  clicks,  @{i}Boum@{ui} needs to have its
window  selected;  so if you go away from @{i}Boum@{ui} to, say, change the
volume  of  your  mod  player, and then return to @{i}Boum@{ui} and want to
mark  a  square,  you  first  have to select the window with the left mouse
button  (click  on  the title bar or on a square already marked or digged).

@endnode
@node sounds Sounds

    If you don't like them, you can:

        - use the menu to disactivate them

        - delete the "Sound" directory... (argl! ;-) )

        - copy your own sound samples other the originals..
           (ButtonClick.8svx = left click
            click2.8svx = right click
            expl2.8svx = explosion)

          You simply must have the datatype corresponding to the format of
          your new samples.

    BTW,  these  sounds  were  not made by me, and I don't know if they are
copyrighted or whatever...

@endnode
@node bugs "Bugs? What's that?"

    Would you find any bug, then @{"contact me" link contact} !

But @{b}don't forget@{ub} to provide me with some informations on your system:
        - @{i}Boum@{ui} version !
        - OS version
        - processor
        - memory
        - ECS/AGA or graphic card (which one, with what graphics emulation
          software ?)
        - on what screen is opened Boum's window (other than WB? laced?
          true colour? chunky?)

        ..and all that kind of stuff that may be in relation with the bug..

@endnode
@node contact "Contact addresses"

    Don't hesitate to drop me a word if you have any suggestion:

    E-mail: @{b}off@free.fr@{ub}

be nice as well ;)

	"Boum" now officialy doesn't work on (at least) some graphic
	boards :-(.

v1.0a - 10 March 97
	Fixed highscores bugs.
	Now saves hiscores and prefs in a single file at exit (Boum.prefs no
	longer needed).
	Little modifs that *might* improve gfx drawing.

	Little checkmark bug in the menu fixed.
	Minor gfx modifs.
	Added a 'New Game' menu.
	Handles big fonts in the highscores name requester.
	Last highscores bug totally atomised !!!  *<8·) (Well, I think. It

	Added some more error checks...
	Changed colours allocation order, in order to make it look a bit
	better when there are less than 6 free colours.

v1.1  - 2 May 97
	In order to make it work under Picasso96 v1.17, no more call to
