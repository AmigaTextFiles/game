@NODE "INTRO" "INTRODUCTION"

Pisti (pronounced "pishti") is a popular Turkish card game, using a 
standard 52 card pack. It is normally played by four people in partnerships, 
partners sitting opposite. The direction of play is anticlockwise. 
Cards are played to a central pile, which can be captured by matching the 
previous card played or playing a jack. Points are scored for certain 
captured cards. The word "pisti", which means "cooked", describes a 
capture of a pile containing only one card, for which extra points are 
scored. 
@ENDNODE


@NODE "CUT" "CUT AND FIRST DEAL"

The dealer shuffles and the player to dealer's left cuts the pack by lifting 
off a part of it and looks at the bottom card of the lifted part of the pack 
(which will become the bottom card of the pack when the cut is 
completed). If this card is a jack, the cutter looks at the next card and 
continues until a card is reached that is not a jack, and places that card 
where it will be the bottom card of the pack. 

The dealer completes the cut, deals the top four cards face down to the 
centre of the table, and then a packet of four cards to each player, 
beginning to dealer's right and ending with the dealer. The remaining stock 
of (undealt) cards is placed face down to one side; the bottom card (the 
one the cutter looked at, which is not a jack) is placed face up at right 
angles under the stock, so that its value can be seen by all. 

The dealer turns one card of the four in the centre of the table face up, to 
start the discard pile. If it is a jack, further cards are turned up until one is 
found that is not a jack. In the unlikely event that all four of the centre 
cards were jacks, there would have to be a redeal. 
@ENDNODE


@NODE "PLAY" "THE PLAY"

The player to dealer's right begins, and the turn to play passes 
anticlockwise. A turn consists of playing one card from your hand face up 
on top of the discard pile. 

If rank of the played card matches the rank of the previous card on the 
pile, the playing team captures the whole pile. The captured cards are 
stored face down in front of one member of the team. The next player will 
then start a new discard pile by playing a card face up to the empty table. 
Playing a jack also captures the whole pile, no matter what card is on top 
of it. 

If the played card is not a jack and is not equal to the previous top card of 
the pile, the played card is simply added to the top of the pile. 
The team which makes the first capture also gets the cards which were 
dealt to the centre of the table. Both members of the capturing team can 
look at these cards, but the other team are not allowed to see them. 

FURTHER DEALS

When all the players have played their four cards, the dealer deals another 
batch of four cards to each player from the stock (but no more to the 
centre of the table) and play continues. When these cards are played, the 
dealer deals a further batch of four cards each. With four players, this third 
deal exhausts the stock (the dealer will get the exposed card from the 
bottom of the pack). When everyone has played their last four cards, any 
cards remaining in the discard pile are given to the last team that made a 
capture. The play of the hand is now over, and the teams score for the 
cards they have captured. 
@ENDNODE


@NODE "PISHTI" "PISHTI"

If the pile consists of just one card and the next player captures it by 
playing a matching card (not a jack), the capturing team scores a 10 point 
bonus for a pisti. The capturing card is placed face up in the team's 
capture pile as a way of remembering the 10 points when scoring. If the 
pile consists of just a single jack and you capture it with another jack, this 
counts as a double pisti, worth 20 points. A pisti can happen at any stage 
of the game, except that you cannot score a pisti for the very first card 
played by the player to dealer's right (capturing the original centre cards) 
nor for the very last card played by the dealer (just before the hand is 
scored). 
@ENDNODE


@NODE "SCORING" "SCORING"

Points are scored for particular cards, for the majority of cards, and for 
each pisti as follows: 

Each jack 	 . . . 	1 point 	
Each ace 	 . . . 	1 point 	
2 of clubs 	 . . . 	2 points 	
10 of diamonds	 . . . 	3 points 	
Majority of cards. . . 	3 points 	
Each pisti 	 . . . 	10 points 	


Normally there will be 16 points to be divided between the teams, plus the 
pistis. However, if both teams take exactly 26 cards, the 3 points for the 
majority of cards is not awarded. 

After the hand has been scored, the turn to deal passes to the right. The 
winners are the first team to have a cumulative score of 151 or more points 
at the end of a hand, or the team which has more points if both reach 151 
on the same hand. 
@ENDNODE

@NODE "VARIATIONS" "VARIATIONS"

Pisti is also commonly played by two players or by four playing as 
individuals. The rules are exactly the same as given above. It is also 
feasible for three people to play, each keeping an individual score. 

A popular variation is to play with bluffing. When there is a single card on 
the table, the next player can play a single card on top of it face down, 
claiming a pisti. If the player of the first card believes this, it counts as a 
pisti for 10 points, and the card played is not shown. If the player of the first 
card does not believe it, the second card is turned face up. If it really 
matches the first card, then the pisti scores double - 20 points. If the 
second card was a bluff, and does not match the first card, the team 
which played the first card scores 10 points for exposing the bluff; in that 
case the two cards remain on the table and play continues. If you bluff 
when the face up card is a jack, then you will score 20 for a double pisti if 
you are believed, and if not the score will be doubled to 40. 

Some descriptions do not mention the possibility of scoring double for a 
pisti made with a jack. It is possible that some players do not count this as 
a pisti at all, or only score it as a single pisti.

@NODE "STRATEGIES" "STRATEGIES AND TIPS"

Never forget the bottom of the stack if you are not dealing and not play a 
card with the same number or picture at the last trick.

Try to memorize as much cards as possible and play the ones which have 
been played before-  trust the propability theory.  Use valets carefully and 
efficiently.  Try to  take the first trick if possible so that you can see the 3 
hidden cards. 

If it is a new trick and you have the topmost card and a valet use the valet 
to take the trick.  If the computer has the same card, it will play and there 
comes a pishti.

If you are sure that you will give a pishti and  you have a valet, play the 
valet.  
@ENDNODE


@NODE "FEATURES" "NEW FEATURES"

BLUFF MODE:
------------

Usage: 
If you want to bluff to opponent (to CPU in this case), press and hold <SHIFT> key and click on the card. You will see a closed card on the center. 
If computer takes the risk and opens the card and you really bluffed, computer takes 10 points (if it is a pair of jacks: 20) otherwise you get the points.
When the opponent (computer) makes a bluff, you will have two choice. 
If you believe the bluff is real, you can click anywhere but the closed card. in this case opponent (CPU) gets the cards and 10 points. 
If you believe the opponent is lying (bluffing), you can open the card by clicking on it. if you are right, you get 10 points otherwise opponent gets 20 points. If the bluffing cards are jacks points are doubled.

@NODE "HISTORY" "HISTORY"

v1.1
-----

Bluff mode added.
A nasty bug about Workbench screens with 64 colours or less (which causes pishti bitmaps drawn off-screen) fixed.
When you play pishti on a 64 colour or less screen mode, the resolution requester only shown once and your resolution information stored in a config file now. The requester never shows up again until <screenmode.dat> file is deleted by user.
Game now finishes correctly when user score reaches finish score.
Majority of Cards 3 Point bug fixed.
Wining percentage added to statisics window.
