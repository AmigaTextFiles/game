               --------------

It's Public Domain-program. Spread it like sand in a sandstorm.

This is really an old game, but I've giving it a new look.
In this version (and it's MY version), the goal is to
bring Yin&Yang (the mark) together in perfect harmony.
Well, you have to move the big square (wich contain the upper
part of the Yin&Yang-mark) down to the bottom of the playboard-
frame (wich contain the lower part of the mark).
This is more easily said than doing it on real.

To move squares or rectangles, just put the mousepointer on
the one you want to move and press either left or right button.
Sometimes a square or rectangle have two different ways you
can move it to; if the empty spaces is upper and left, use left
button to move it left, use right button to move it up.
If the empty spaces is lower and right, use left button to move
down, use right button to move to the right.
If the empty spaces is upper and lower, use left button to move
up, use right button to move it down.
If the empty spaces is to the left and right, there is no doubt.
Sometimes confusing, but nothing is simple until you've
learned it. You can do it, I know.

If, in any way, you don't believe it IS possible to join the
two halves of Yin&Yang-mark (after hours of stubborness?), here
is what you do:
