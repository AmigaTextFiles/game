@node "intro" "Introduction"
 I started programming a while ago. I started out with that unmentionable language SOMA. That was 2 weeks after I got my A1200 (I'd had consoles before that). I began to learn a bit on how to display graphis and stuff oike that (well, after all, SOMA couldn't do OS stuff at the time). I then moved on to Blitz Basic II. Slightly better language? Yes, I think so.

Anyway, I began to write OS stuff after I realised that I was useless at making games. I've made lots of utilities sincw, although ¾ of them I never actually finished. The ones I did finish however were extremely good. I had finally discovered my talent - Utils! So I kept writing and writing.

After a few utils, I thought I'd try combining what I can do and what I can't. And what was that you may ask? Well, a Workbench game! OS stuff mixed with gfx. I decided to work on something that wasn't too complicated, and I came up with the idea of making a Hang Man game. After all, everyone knows how to play HangMan. A few days after I thought of the idea, I was talking to Steve Clack, a guy that runs a @{"BBS" link "bbs" 0} here on the Isle Of Wight. He then came up with the idea of instead of having the usual game where bit by bit, the "death arena" is built, the arena is already built, and the bloke is ready to be hanged. I thought this was a brilliant idea and took it on.

That's how Hang In There! was born.

@node "disc" "Disclaimer"
 This program is E-MailWare which means you have to send an E-Mail to the @{"author" link "credits" 0} telling him what you think of the program, and any comments you may have. This program is freely distributable, as long as the archive is distributed together. 
 
 This program is also part of the @{"E-MailSoft" link "ems" 0} Software group.

@endnode

@node "req" "System Requirements"
 Hang In There needs quite a high spec machine relative to what the game actually is. This is because the amount of animation, and the massive music module:
  These are the minimum requirements:

   - 1.5MB Chip
   - Another 0.5MB (Chip or Fast)
   - Hard Drive
   - ·ReqTools.library
   - ·PowerPacker.library
   - ·XHelvetica.font
   - ·XEN.font
   
    Your best bet to run this program is a A1200 with a Hard Drive.   


· = Supplied with the Archive

@endnode

@node "install" "Installing"
 Installing? Easy!
  There is a supplied Install Script with the archive. Simply click on it and follow the prompts.

The Install Script was designed to be used with the Escom Installer v43.3 and only v43.3. If for some reason the Install script fails at some point, click @{"here" system "Execute VerCheck"} to get the version. If the Version isn't 43.3 or higher, then I suggest you download the latest version from Aminet.

@endnode

@node "play" "Playing"
 The Aim of the game is to get the word before you use up all your attempts. To do this, you are supplied with a little Text Bar which has the word you need to get to win the game. It will start off with ***'s. As you start to click on letters, you will either get the letter right or wrong. If the word doesn't have the letter you clicked on, one of your attempts will be taken away, and the platform the Hang Man is standing on will go down one bit.

If the word does have the letter you clicked on, then the letter will appear on the Text Bar. As you get more and more letters right, the word will start to appear on the Text Bar, making it easier to guess what the word is. There are also "Right" and "Wrong" sounds to make it easier to see whether you got the letter right or not.

If you play over and over again, a highscore will start to mount. If at the end of your playing session (whether quit by choice or by failing to guess one of the words) you have a high enough highscore, a requester will come up asking you for a name. I myself always enter my first name, put a coma, and then enter a kinda nick after it, like "Alvaro, The Great" or "Helen, The Horrid" (my mum :). But that's just me I guess.

At the end of the day... there isn't really an ending, it's just one of those games where you can play while downloading something, or while waiting for a web page to come up. It's certainly not intended as a "9 hour a day" type game :)

@node "cust" "Customising it"
 Hang In There! is actually quite customisable.
  There are several ways in which you can customise Hang In There! for yourself:

 - Data/HIT.med = This is the Music module which Hang In There! uses as the music. you can replace it with any module as long as it is a MED module (I think that's MMD1). If you put any other type, it will quite literally blow up.
 
 - Data/HIT4.snd = The sound that Hang In There! uses as the one it plays when you get a letter wrong. 8SVX Format.
 
 - Data/HIT5.snd = The "You've Won!" sound. 8SVX Format.
 
 - Data/HIT5.snd = Letter correct sound. 8SVX Format
 
 - Data/HIT0snd to HIT3.snd = The 4 sounds for the screaming when the Hang Man dies. 8SVX Format
 
 - Data/HIT.txt = This is the text file that contains all the words that Hang In There! uses. Add as many words as you want, one word per line, and then count how many lines there are. Go to the beginning of the file, and the first line has to be the number of lines that the document has. This way, HIT reads all the lines, containing the words.
 
  @{b}Tool Types@{ub}

Here are the Tool Types available for Hang In There!

 - MUSIC=<YES or NO> = This simply makes Hang In There! play the music, or not.
 
 - WORDSFILE=<File containing the words> = Specify the path and filename of the Words file, as default: "Data/HIT.txt"
 
 - MODULE=<Med Module for music> = This specifies the Module to be played. If it isn't mentioned, the default module is "Data/HIT.med".
 
 - NUMBERATTEMPTS=<number of attempts> = This specifies the number of attempts you have in the game. If it isn't mentioned, the default is 8. However, if you have it set to 15 (min=8 max=15) then you will get ALL the animations. the number of attempts = the number of anims. You can set this option through the game.

@endnode

@node "high" "Highscores"
 The highscores file is set to "Data/HIT.score".
  This section is just a warning who try and mess about with the highscores and want to cheat.

I detest cheaters. They're the worst scum of the universe. That's why I've made Hang In There! Encrypt the Highscores. if you don't believe me, simply have a look at the file itself. If you also try and delete the highscore, Hang In There! will just create a new one, starting from a minimum hoighscore of 100 through to 1000, so don't even attempt it.
