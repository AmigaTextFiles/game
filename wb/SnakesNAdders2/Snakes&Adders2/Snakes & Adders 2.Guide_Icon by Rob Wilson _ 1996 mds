@NODE "intro" "Program Intrdouction.."

 *PROGRAM INTRODUCTION*

 · Snakes & Adders is simply a variation of the `worm' type game.

 · You move around the screen using the keyboard (cursor keys are default)
   and `eat' the numbers which will appear before you.

 · The larger the number, the more your snake will grow.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "displ" "Display"

 *GAME DISPLAY*

 · Below, the Snakes & Adders game screen is represented using ASCII art
   hopefully to clear up any confusion.

           +---------------------------------+


 · The above ASCII art is just a pictorial representation of the game.
   It does look a fair bit better than this.
   
@ENDNODE

@NODE "numbe" "Numbers.."

 *NUMBERS*

 · The numbers 1 to 9 will appear at random points across the screen 
   during the course of game.  It is suggested that you eat these numbers, 
   otherwise there is not much else you can do.

 · Occasionally a question mark `?' will appear.  These contain mystery
   numbers.  Only when you eat one will you know how large a number it 
   was.

 · The number can range from 1 to 25.

 · On some levels upto 3 numbers on screen will appear just to add some
   `variety' into the game.  The chances of multiple numbers appearing 
   on-screen will be determined by the current level.

 · In later versions we plan to have additional attributes for question 
   marks `?'.  We hope to include speed up, slow down and reverse control 
   to make things interesting.  This depends upon demand though.
   See @{"GIFTWARE/AUTHORS" LINK "giftw"}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "speed" "Speed.."

 *SPEED*

 · As you progress, your snake will start to get extremely long.

 · When you have eaten all the numbers available, you will proceed to the
   next level and your snake will have returned to its default size.

 · But as we're `kind' games programmers, you will have to complete it at
   a different speed (probably) than on the previous level.  In addition
   the numbers (might) decrease faster.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "hisco" "High Scores.."

 *HIGH SCORES*

 · As of version 2.00 of Snakes & Adders, a high score table has been
   added for you to keep track of your best top ten scores.

 · If at the end of the game you achieve a high score, then you will be
   prompted to enter your name via the keyboard.
   
 · The scores will be saved out when you decide to quit the game.

 · High Score information is saved into the Snakes & Adders Icon. 
   HS1 and HS2 are for this purpose.

 · If you get fed up with your high scores, you can reset the High Score
   table to its internal defaults.

 · To reset the High Score table, simply delete both HS1 and HS2 from the
   Tool-Tpye information window.

 · You can now achieve new high scores and these will be saved out again
   to the Snakes & Adders icon when you next leave the game.

 · To view High Scores press the 'H' key on the title screen.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "cplay" "Continue Play.."

 *CONTINUE PLAY*

 · As of version 2.00 of Snakes & Adders, you are given the option to
   continue playing from the last level you reached.

 · There are 2 continues available, so you now have 3 lives to play the
   game with effectively.

 · Should you decide to continue however, your score will be reset to
   zero.

 · Of course you do not have to continue.  In such situations, you may
   prefer a higher score rather than a higher level.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "egame" End of the Game.."

 *END OF GAME*

 · Should you manage to complete Snakes & Adders, the end sequence will
   be initiated.

 · You will have to enter your name in the HIGH SCORE table.

 · A surprise may await you. :)

 · Oh and please send your HIGH SCORE once you've finished the game to
   the authors.  See @{"GIFTWARE/AUTHORS" LINK "giftw"}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "okeys" "Other keys.."

 *OTHER KEYS*

 · As far as I know the A600 and A1000 have its cursor keys awkwardly 
   placed so you can use other keys for movement.

 · This is achieved via @{"TOOL-TYPES" LINK "toolt"} settings on the Snakes&Adders Icon.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "toolt" "Tool-types.."

 *TOOL-TYPES*

 · Snakes & Adders supports the use of tool-types.

 · There are two main uses for tool-types:-


     Setting keys for control.  See @{"CONTROLLING THE SNAKE" LINK "direc"}.

     Add/Omit difficulty to/from the game.  See @{"GOING BACK ON YOURSELF" LINK "going"}.


 · It is extremely important that you *DO NOT BY ANY MEANS* alter the
   two lines labelled HS1 & HS2 of tool-type information in the Snakes &
   Adders icon.  This is for use by the game and altering these lines may
   have undesirable effects.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "direc" "Controlling the snake"

 *CONTROLS*

 · I prefer a,s,p,l for movement, so in my tool-type information I have
   the following settings:-

   LEFT=a
   RIGHT=s
   UP=p
   DOWN=l

 · If you're not sure how to change tool-type settings simply:-

    Click on the Snakes&Adders icon once.

    Then select from the Workbench menu 'Information..' or use 'RtAmiga-I'.

    Then select the tool-type you want to change by clicking on it.  

 · Change the value after the '=' to whichever key you wish to use.  
   Standard typewriter keys (The light coloured ones in the main keyboard 
   area) are entered by pressing the key on its own (UnShifted).

 · Any of the other keys require their name to be entered, for example
   "Right Shift", or "Help".  For a complete list of all key names see
   @{"KEY NAMES" LINK "keyna"}.

 · The cursor keys can be entered as follows, but there is little point, 
   since the cursor keys are the default values, so the same effect can be 
   obtained by leaving the options blank.

   LEFT=Cursor Left
   RIGHT=Cursor Right
   UP=Cursor Up
   DOWN=Cursor Down

 · Quotes are not required, but can be used.

   LEFT="A"
   RIGHT='Numeric Enter'

 · If you are still unsure how to use tool-types consult your Workbench 
   manual, or some dedicated Amiga owner who will definitely know.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "going" "Going back on yourself.."

 *GOING BACK ON YOURSELF*

 · There is one more tooltype available for use in the game.  This
   tooltype is called 'BACKONSELF'.  The 'BACKONSELF' tool type takes one
   of two values, 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'.  Its structure is as follows:-

   BACKONSELF=FALSE    ;this does not allow your snake to go back on itself
                       ;and cause you to crash during the game.. (Default)

   BACKONSELF=TRUE     ;this allows your snake to go back on itself and
                       ;cause you to crash during the game..

 · The purpose of this tooltype is mainly to add/omit difficulty from
   the game, for the more 'hardened' games-player.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "quitt" "Quitting the game.."

 *QUITTING THE GAME*

 · To quit the current game press the Escape key.  

 · You may be asked whether to continue or not.

 · If you do not continue you may be asked to enter your name in the
   high score table.

 · The "Game-Over" message will be displayed.

 · From there, Escape or Space will take you to the titles.

 · Pressing Escape on the title screen will close the game.

 · Or you could just click on the close gadget. :)



 · But why on earth would you want to stop playing Snakes&Adders? :(

@ENDNODE

@NODE "runni" "Running the Game.."

 *RUNNING THE GAME*

 · Double-Click on the programs icon from your Workbench, or
 · Run it from the CLI if you prefer.
 · When on the title screen, start the game by pressing the SPACE-BAR.

 · You can run the game easily from a menu or a keyboard-shortcut
   using programs like Toolsdeamon, ToolsManager, etc. if you wish.

 · In addition, you can run music in the background on programs like 
   Delitracker, PlaySID, etc.

 · Snakes & Adders will *NOT* intefere with audio.device.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "requi" "Requirements.."

 *REQUIREMENTS*

 · An Amiga of virtually any type from one of the following:..

   A500,A500+,A600,A1000,A1200,A1500,A2000,B2000,B2500,A3000,A3000T,
   A4000[T]/xxx [substitute xxx with 030/040/060],CDTV & CD32
   with a keyboard.

 · Any of the above Amigas will require KS2.04 and WB2.04 or greater in
   order to run the program.

 · You must be running Workbench in 4 colours or more in order to play
   Snakes & Adders.

 · 8 colours is recommended, as the main Snakes & Adders icon is 8 colour.

 · Memory required: about 40-45K of Chip RAM, and 20-25K of anything else.

 · 68881/68882 are not used!

 · MMUs are not required! - It's only a game :)

 · As for RISC based Amigas based around the Power PC-603 & Power PC-604
   (and any accelerator cards) as long as the 680x0 is emulated correctly,
   the game should work fine.

 · If you have got less than KS2.04/WB2.04 then we think it's about time
   you upgraded your Amiga. 

 · If you don't upgrade, then you are an extremely disloyal Amiga owner.
   Hell, why should us developers hold back for people with low-spec 
   Amigas.  A quick message for those people "Kickstart 1.3 died when the
   A3000 arrived circa 1991/1992!  Even 2.04 is fading a bit these days,
   especially with all the bugs in the ROM.  SO UPGRADE YOUR AMIGA NOW!"
   The standard Amiga Spec these days is an 030 based machine with 6Mb/8Mb
   of RAM, 540Mb IDE and probably a CD-ROM.  Heck, I know people with an
   060/18Mb/1GB IDE/4xCD-ROM and a MultiSync on their A1200's.  Now that's
   Amiga dedication for you!

 *KEYBOARD NAMES*

 · Here are the names of the non-typewriter keys which can be used in the
   tool-types. (In roughly the order that they appear before me. ;)

     F1  F2   F3   F4   F5   F6   F7   F8   F9   F10
                                                   BackSpace  Delete  Help
Tab                                                Return
Ctrl                                  Right Special
Left Shift  Left Special              Right Shift
Left Alt    Left Amiga      Space     Right Amiga  Right Alt


   Numeric (   Numeric )   Numeric /   Numeric *
   Numeric 7   Numeric 8   Numeric 9   Numeric -
   Numeric 4   Numeric 5   Numeric 6   Numeric +
   Numeric 1   Numeric 2   Numeric 3   Numeric Enter
   Numeric 0   Numeric .


 · If that looks gibberish, you're probably viewing this document in a 
   proportional font. Try Topaz.font.

   **************************
   * IMPORTANT NOTE FOLLOWS *
   **************************

 · Left Special, and Right Special are the little BLANK keys, one 
   next to the LEFT SHIFT key and one next to the RETURN key.

 · If you have a FOREIGN KEYBOARD i.e. not a British one (or an older
   machine), these keys *MAY NOT BE PRESENT* or they may have something
   printed on them.

 · *IF* they are not there, *DO NOT USE* these tool-types, or you will
   have a non-movable snake. ;)

@NODE "futur" "Future updates.."

 *FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS*

 · Possible enhancements for v3.00. 

 · These are just ideas.  They should not to be taken seriously. Some
   may be implemented, others may not.  We are rather busy with other
   projects.

   · Attributes for Question Marks.. 

        reverse control.
        speed up.
        slow down.
        level jumps.
 
   · More levels.

   · Increased playing area size.

   · Specify number of colours for WB with more than 4 colours via
     tool-type.

   · Level designer.

   · Scaleable graphics/playing area.

 · It's like we said, adding new features does count on many things, e.g.
   @{"*GIFTWARE DONATIONS*" LINK "giftw"}, encouragement from *YOU* and enough time to put
   them into practise.
