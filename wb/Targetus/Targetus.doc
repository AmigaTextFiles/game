WARNING
"""""""
       I'm not responsible if Targetus causes any damage to your disks,
       your programs or your data. I wrote this piece of code simply
       because I needed it and I decided to put it into public together
       with source code. I'm pretty sure that it hasn't "BURN_YOUR_CPU"
       code included, but if something happens - don't blame me.

GAME
""""
       Targetus is a game. Simple game. Not a big one with turbo fast
       code, amazing graphics and 8-channel sound effects, but small and
       system friendly one. It is made in order to run on every machine.
       
       Back in 1991 when I started making this game I was enjoying and
       learning how to understand and use all those nice intuition and
       graphics functions Amiga makers put into ROM. I also wanted to
       make something for fun. And I have had fun programing it.

       Nowadays, 6 years later, I took Targetus' source code from
       archive and look into it for a while. It looked very bad although
       executable file worked on my OS 1.3 and OS 2.0. I decided to make
       it more system friendly and I also added few things.

RUNNING
"""""""
       Targetus is very simply to play. Just start it and you'll learn
       how to play it. Simply: shoot targets, get score, get into
       highscore, use menus/keyboard to pause, change speed of targets,
       get info and select 'Quit' to exit the game.

REASONS
"""""""
       Here I have to mention some suggestions which I considered but
didn't make. 

       * Hi score table ?

       Well, making hiscore with 5 to 10 names would be too much for
       this simple game.

       * Sound effects instead of calling DisplayBeep() ?

       Many people (including me) use patcher to install a sound to
       DisplayBeep(). So, shooting targets causes a nice beep sound.

       * Nicer exit requester instead of calling AutoRequst() ?

       Same as above. Nowadays all users patched system requesters,
       e. g. with RTPatch or Arq.

THANKS
""""""
       Special thanks goes to Andrew Cavers (don't remember where he
       send me an e-mail from) who wrote me an e-mail about Targetus
       a long while ago.
