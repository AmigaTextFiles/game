WARNING

  Although  this  program  is freely distributable (see COPYRIGHT below), I
would  appreciate  if  you  take the time to write me a line or two (E-Mail
please)  if  you  are  using  any of my programs or if you have any kind of
ideas  or  suggestions  (This is not too much to ask, is it?).  If you feel
particularly  generous,  I  would  like  to  receive a disk with any useful
programs you have written, preferrably with source.  Thanks!


DESCRIPTION

  Snake  is  a very simple game.  A snake-like figure crawls over a surface
where  some  blocks  are  placed.   The  snake  is  controlled by using the
joystick,  and  you  must  avoid all the blocks, except the single one in a
different  color.   The colored block MUST be hit:  when you do so, another
colored  block  will  appear  and your score will be increased by one.  You
must  also  avoid  to hit your own tail - the snake grows as time passes to
make  things  a little more fun.  If you hit yourself or a wall or a block,
the  game  is  over  -  restart pressing fire.  To exit the game, close the
window.   (I  never  thought  it was so hard to describe such a simple game
using  just words!  Forget what you read and just play the game - it is not
that hard, anyway.)  This program works both under WB 1.3 and 2.0.


OPTIONS

  No options.


EXAMPLES

  Sorry, no pictures.


BUGS

  The  joystick  movements  are  read directly from the hardware ports.  If
another program is also using the joystick, conflicts may arise.
