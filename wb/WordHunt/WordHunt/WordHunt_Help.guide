 @{b}Introduction to WordHunt@{ub} =======================

 @{b}What the program does:@{ub}

   WordHunt is a program that lets you create, play,
   and print word puzzle games like those found in popular
   "Word Search" books. This kind of puzzle has a given
   set of words hidden within a rectangular grid of random
   letters.

   The program lets you define the size of the puzzle, the
   font for display or printout, and the words to hide away
   in the matrix. The words are right before your eyes, but
   finding them can be a challenge and will test your pattern
   recognition skills. Use the built-in timer to see how long
   it takes you to find all the words.

   To highlight a word that you find simply click on the first
   or last character of any word from the word list and, while
   depressing the left mouse button, drag the mouse over the
   entire word. When you release the button the program will see
   if you found a valid word and will highlight it for you.

   The program will accept words from terms or phrases that you
   type in a window, copy from the clipboard, or load from
   files you make in your word processor or editor. WordHunt
   will read @{i}any@{ui} Amiga file-- even program code files--
   and will extract the printable words it finds and then tuck
   them away in the puzzle grid for you or your friends to find.
   You can even make puzzles with foreign language alphabets or
   numeric digits if you wish. Teachers will find these useful
   vocabulary teaching aids too.

   If you want 'hard copy' of a puzzle, its word list, or
   its solution, you can 'print' the puzzle to any preferences
   printer as text or graphics, or print to a file or
   the clipboard.

 @{b}About WordHunt's Author@{ub} =======================

  WordHunt version 1.3  October 1996

  WordHunt was written by Robert Dickow, a music professor who
  likes to hack on computers from time to time as well as on his
  French horn.

  He originally started to program WordHunt as a simple CLI
  program for his son, who loves word search puzzles. After a
  short time he added a small graphical user interface, which began
  to grow and grow until it was a full featured program, complete
  with frills such as sound and speech.

  Bob Dickow has released WordHunt free of charge to Amiga users.
  Although it is FreeWare, it is @{i}not@{ui} in the public domain.
  Sale of the software may not be made without making a deal with the
  author, although it may be included freely in public domain/shareware
  collections that are given away or sold for nominal fees or in network
  databases for free distribution.

  it is 100% bug free, but it works ok for me.

 @{b}WordHunt Menus@{ub} =======================

   All of the windows in WordHunt share a common screen menu. There
   are four menus in the menu bar, as listed below. You can get help
   on any item in the menu lists by pressing the Help key while
   the pointer is over a menu item and the menu button (the right
   mouse button) is down.

   The menus:

   @{"Project" link "Project" 0}
   @{"Edit" link "Edit" 0}
   @{"Settings" link "Settings" 0}
   @{"Display" link "Display" 0}

@endnode

@node "Project" "Project"

 @{b}The Project Menu@{ub} =======================

 @{bg shine}New Puzzle@{bg back}

   This menu item has three subitems, 'From File...', 'From Clipboard',
   and 'From UserList'. If you choose the 'From File' subitem, a
   requester will appear. If there is any data in the @{"UserList" link "UserListWINDOW" 0} the
   'From UserList' subitem will be active and will allow you to
   create a new puzzle from the UserList contents.

   Puzzles created with this command will automatically search any
   file, looking for ASCII text data that will fit in the puzzle, and
   extract that data and place it in random locations in the
   puzzle grid.

 @{bg shine}Load Saved Puzzle...@{bg back}

   If you have previously saved a puzzle that was 'in play', this
   menu item will let you specify which file you wish to load. The
   file must have been saved by WordHunt in order to be read using
   this command.

 @{bg shine}Save@{bg back}

   You may save the puzzle that is currently in play by selecting
   this menu item.

   If you have not already loaded a previously saved puzzle or have
   not yet saved a puzzle then a requester will appear asking for a
   file path name to use to store the puzzle.

   If you have previously saved or loaded a saved puzzle then WordHunt
   will immediately save your puzzle using the path name that was last
   used and no file requester will appear. If you wish to save to a
   new file, select the @{"Project, Save As..." link "H_SaveOldAs" 0} menu item.

   The saved puzzle file will contain the words you have found and
   the elapsed play time. You can resume play on the saved puzzle at
   any time.

 @{bg shine}Save As...@{bg back}

   This menu item allows you to save the puzzle to a file name you
   specify. Subsequent 'Save' commands will be directed to this
   file.

 @{bg shine}Print/Output...@{bg back}

   This menu item will open and close the @{"Printout window" link "PrintReqWINDOW" 0} that
   will let you make settings for what and how you want to print.

   Output can be directed to the printer device, a file, or the clipboard.

   The window can be switched with the 'Graphics Menu' or 'ASCII Menu'
   button to display settings appropriate to the type and format of
   the data you want to output. 

   Graphic data cannot be sent to the clipboard in version 1.3 of WordHunt.

 @{bg shine}Hibernate@{bg back}

   This command will close all the currently open windows and place
   the @{"timer" link "TimerWINDOW" 0} in pause mode. You can reactivate the program by
   selecting the program's name in the Workbench Tools menu list, or by double clicking
   on the WordHunt Appicon, if present on the Workbench.

 @{bg shine}About...@{bg back}

   This command opens the @{"About window" link "AboutWINDOW" 0}. To close the window, type '?'
   without the Right Amiga key, or click on the About window's
   closebox gadget.

 @{bg shine}Quit WordHunt@{bg back}

   This will stop the execution of the program. You can set a @{"ToolType" link "ToolTypes" 0}
   argument to enable or disable the warning requester that pops up
   when you ask the program to quit.

@endnode

@node "Edit" "Edit"

 @{b}The Edit Menu@{ub} =======================

 @{bg shine}User List...@{bg back}

   This command will open and close the @{"User List window" link "UserListWINDOW" 0}.
   The User List allows keyboard entry and editing of words
   or lets you edit the puzzle's word list.

@endnode

@node "Settings" "Settings"

 @{b}The Settings Menu@{ub} =======================

 @{bg shine}Dimensions....@{bg back}

   This command will open and close the @{"Dimensions window" link "DimenWINDOW" 0}.
   The Dimensions window allows controlling the size of
   your puzzles.

 @{bg shine}Random Seed...@{bg back}

   This command will open and close the @{"Random Seed window" link "SeedWINDOW" 0}.
   The Seed value determines how the puzzle will create
   your puzzles and allows for some control of repeatability
   of the puzzles.

 @{bg shine}Font...@{bg back}

   This command will open a Font requester. Choose a font and
   font size that you want to use in the current puzzle, if open,
   and any subsequent puzzles that you create or open.

 @{bg shine}Character Set@{bg back}

   This menu item has three subitems: 'English Alphabet',
   'Numeric', and 'Custom'. Only numbers will appear in the
   puzzle if 'Numeric' is chosen, and the program will only
   select numbers from text strings in source files when
   building new puzzles. If you want to make puzzles with other
   character sets, choose 'Custom'. This will set the character
   set to the internal set. You can load in new sets at any
   time.

 @{bg shine}Load Custom...@{bg back}

   Use this command to bring up a file requester into which you
   can specify a file to load a new character set. You can make
   your own custom files very easily in your word processor or
   editor by typing in a set of characters. The list should be in
   a single line without spaces, although the loader will process
   almost any file, looking for printable characters and eliminating
   duplicate letters. The list can be of any size. You could make
   puzzles with only the letters 'ABCD' in it, for example. Store
   your custom character sets in the Custom drawer or in a directory
   of your choice.

 @{bg shine}Restore Custom to Default@{bg back}

   This will restore the custom character set to the internal default,
   which is the international alphabet included in most fonts.

 @{bg shine}Use ToolTypes?@{bg back}

   You may toggle this menu item to control how the program reads the
   icon information when loading new puzzle files. When checked, the
   computer will read the icon @{"ToolTypes" link "ToolTypes" 0} to determine such aspects as
   puzzle size (if Force Dimensions is unchecked), custom character
   set, random number seed, answer key or Word List enabling/disabling,
   and some other features.

 @{bg shine}Create Icons?@{bg back}

   When you save settings or puzzle files the program will make an icon
   to accompany the file, unless you set this menu item to an unchecked
   state. You may edit the ToolTypes stored in these icons yourself using
   the Workbench 'Information' menu command.

 @{bg shine}Force Dimensions@{bg back}

   When this item is checked then the current dimensions as shown in the
   @{"Dimensions window" link "DimenWINDOW" 0} will override any ToolTypes size settings when the
   next icon is loaded in for a new puzzle.

 @{bg shine}Load Settings...@{bg back}

   The Settings files you specify in the file requester will be loaded.
   Settings files store information on window positioning, menu status,
   and other aspects of the current state of the program, such as path
   names and search patterns used in the various load and save requesters.

 @{bg shine}Save Settings As Default@{bg back}

   This @{i}always@{ui} saves to the default settings file. Normally this
   file is found in the same directory as the program, unless you set
   a ToolType specifying the settings file in the icon that started the
   program. In this case, the file you specified becomes the default
   settings file. See @{"ToolTypes" link "ToolTypes" 0} for this and other ToolType control
   variables that you may set in the program tool icon.

 @{bg shine}Save Settings As...@{bg back}

   To specify a file other than the default settings file in which to
   store your current settings, choose this menu item. A requester will
   pop up in which you may  specify any path name you wish.

 @{bg shine}Load Default@{bg back}

   This command will always load in the default settings file, if present,
   in the directory from which the program was first run, or from the
   path specified in the SETTINGS ToolType.

 @{bg shine}Bells & Whistles...@{bg back}

   This menu item has two subitems: 'Speech' and 'Sound Effects (if
   Speech off)'. Speech sets the program to use the Amiga's built in
   speech system to pronounce any word found in the puzzle when using
   the mouse. Sound effects may optionally be used instead of the
   speech feature, if desired.

  The 'Bells & Whistles' menu commands work in a special way:

   If 'English Alphabet' is set as the @{"Custom character set" link "H_PuzzType" 0},
   and if 'Speech' is selected in the 'Bells & Whistles' menu item, then
   the Amiga will speak the word, and the sound effects will not occur,
   regardless of the current status of the 'Sound Effects (if Speech off)'
   subitem. If any other character set is chosen, however, speech will not
   be used and the sound effects will be used if the 'Sound Effects (if
   Speech off)' item is checked. This feature avoids nonsensical words to
   be spoken.

   If you really do want to have numbers or custom strings spoken, you may
   force speech for all puzzle types by setting the SPEAKALWAYS @{"ToolType" link "ToolTypes" 0}.

@node "Display" "Display"

 @{b}The Display Menu@{ub} =======================

 @{bg shine}Puzzle...@{bg back}

   This menu item will open and close the @{"Puzzle window" link "PuzzleWINDOW" 0}. The
   menu item will be disabled if there is no active puzzle.

 @{bg shine}Answer Key...@{bg back}

   This menu item will open and close the @{"Answer Key window" link "AnswerWINDOW" 0},
   unless disabled through a ToolTypes setting. This menu
   item will also be disabled if there is no active puzzle.

 @{bg shine}Timer...@{bg back}

   This menu item will open and close the @{"Timer window" link "TimerWINDOW" 0}.
   The Timer lets you keep track of how long it takes to
   solve a puzzle.

 @{bg shine}Circle Words@{bg back}

   There are two ways in which hidden words are revealed. When
   the 'Circle Words' menu item is checked, any found
   words will be encircled. Depending on the puzzle's size or the
   display font, you may prefer to see the alternate display
   method, which draws lines between letters, which also
   appear in a contrasting color. This method of display may be
   less satisfactory, however, in cases where the puzzle's
   display font does not have a complete set of glyphs for
   showing the horizontal, vertical and diagonal paths through the
   hidden strings.

 @{bg shine}AppIcon@{bg back}

   When this menu item is checked an AppIcon will appear on the
   Workbench screen. Deselecting the menu item will remove it
   from the screen. You may double click on the AppIcon to bring
   all the WordHunt windows forward and also to bring WordHunt
   out of Hibernation. You may also drag and drop file icons onto
   the AppIcon, which will also activate the program and attempt
   to process the file associated with the icon.

 @{b}WordHunt Window@{ub} =======================

   The WordHunt Window is the main window for the program.
   If you click on the close gadget on this window the program
   will attempt to quit, just as if you selected the "Quit
   WordHunt" menu option.

   This window shows a ListView gadget that displays all of the
   words contained in the puzzle. It has two display modes, depending
   on the state of the 'Display' switch gadget. The list can show the
   words still to be found in the puzzle or the list of words
   currently found by the user. Click on the 'Display' gadget to view
   the other list. The number of words in the displayed list is shown
   to the right of the Display button. The total number of words in
   the puzzle is displayed in a text gadget in the lower left corner
   of the window.

   If you click on a word in the 'Remaining' words display listview
   gadget, the word will be highlighted in the puzzle window, and that
   word will be added to the 'Found' words list. This 'cheat' function
   can be disabled by setting the WORDLIST flag in the DISABLE @{"ToolType" link "ToolTypes" 0}
   parameter.

   The Restart button will set the puzzle window and the list contents
   to the same state as a brand new puzzle. The timer will be reset
   automatically and switch to running condition.

   The WordHunt window is an 'appwindow'. If you drag a file icon over the
   window and release the mouse button, the program will attempt to read
   and process the file associated with the icon. If the icon belongs to a
   'prefs' file, the program will load the prefs file as if the "Settings...
   Load Settings" menu item had been chosen. If the icon belongs to a
   'saved puzzle,' the program will load the saved game.
   
   The @{"Puzzle window" link "PuzzleWINDOW" 0} is an appwindow and functions the same way
   as the WordHunt window when an icon is dragged and dropped into it.

   You can bring the WordHunt window to the front of the other windows on the
   display by pressing the Esc (Escape) key on the keyboard.

@endnode

@node "PuzzleWINDOW" "Puzzle Window"

 @{b}Puzzle Window@{ub} =======================

   The Puzzle window displays the puzzle and any words the user
   has found. Words may be hidden in any direction-- horizontal,
   vertical, or diagonal. Letters of words may be in forward or
   reverse order.

   To tell the program where you have found one of the words,
   click on the first or last character of the word and, while
   depressing the left mouse button, drag the mouse over the
   entire word. When you release the button the program will see
   if you found a word from its hidden @{"word list" link "MainWINDOW" 0} and will
   highlight the word on the display.

   The font used in the puzzle can be set using the @{"Font" link "H_Font" 0} menu item
   in the @{"Settings Menu" link "Settings" 0}.

   If you have changed your puzzle display font to a larger size
   after creating the puzzle, the window may be too large to display all
   of the puzzle. Such puzzles will still print out to devices other
   than the video display. To see all of the puzzle, just switch to a
   smaller font size.

   The Puzzle window is an 'appwindow'. If you drag a file icon over the
   window and release the mouse button, the program will attempt to read
   and process the file associated with the icon. Operation of this
   appwindow is the same as for the main @{"WordHunt window" link "MainWINDOW" 0}.

@endnode

@node "AnswerWINDOW" "Answer Key Window"

 @{b}Answer Key Window@{ub} =======================

   The Answer Key window looks like the @{"Puzzle" link "PuzzleWINDOW" 0}
   display window, but reveals where the program originally hid the words. 
   These word positions can differ from the words that the user has actually
   located if there is more than one copy of a word in the puzzle.

   If an Answer Key window is open and the user opens a new puzzle, the
   WordHunt program will automatically close the Answer Key window so as
   to avoid 'giving away' the answers.

   You can prevent the window from opening at any time by setting the KEY
   flag for the DISABLE @{"ToolType" link "ToolTypes" 0} argument.

@endnode

@node "DimenWINDOW" "Dimenions Window"

 @{b}Dimensions Window@{ub} =======================

   This window allows you to set the width and height, in
   characters, for the next puzzle that you create. Two slider
   gadgets let you set each dimension of the puzzle. The
   minimum puzzle size in either 'x' or 'y' dimension is 3 characters.
   The maximum allowable by the gadgets is based on the current
   puzzle font. After playing with these gadgets you can instantly
   return to the current puzzle size settings by clicking on the
   'current' button. Click on the 'default' button to set the current
   dimensions to the internal default values, which can be set in a
   @{"ToolTypes" link "ToolTypes" 0} parameter if you wish.

@endnode

@node "AboutWINDOW" "About Window"

 @{b}About Window@{ub} =======================

   WordHunt's About window displays title and version information
   about the program. The size of the current puzzle grid and the
   attributes of the current font used in the puzzle and answer
   key windows is also shown.

   The opening and closing of this window differs slightly from the
   keyboard command options for the other windows. To open this window
   from the keyboard, type Right Amiga + '?'. To close the window, type
   '?' alone.

@node "TimerWINDOW" "Timer Window"

 @{b}Timer Window@{ub} =======================

   The timer window shows the elapsed time since starting a game
   in HH:MM:SS format, where HH is hours, MM is minutes, and SS is
   seconds. You may pause the timer by clicking on the mutual exclude
   gadget's 'Pause' button. Clicking the 'Run' button will start the timer
   from its current displayed time. Clicking on the 'Reset' button
   will set the timer to 00:00:00 at any time. The timer is restarted
   automatically if a new puzzle display is shown or if the program is
   brought out of '@{"Hibernation" link "H_Hibernate" 0}'.

   The timer is automatically placed in pause mode if the @{"Puzzle window" link "PuzzleWINDOW" 0}
   is closed, when the program is displaying a requester, or when the
   user is playing with the @{"menus" link "Menus" 0}.

@endnode

@node "SeedWINDOW" "Random Seed Window"

 @{b}Random Seed Window@{ub} =======================

   The Random Seed Window has two gadgets, one for displaying the random
   number that the computer uses to create the current puzzle, the other
   for locking the number so that the computer can not change it on its
   own (although @{i}you@{ui} may type in a new number any time you wish). If you
   type a number other than zero in the integer gadget, the next puzzle
   will use that number as the seed for the random number generator.

   The Lock checkbox can be turned on and off from a @{"ToolTypes" link "ToolTypes" 0} icon argument
   by specifying a random number seed. The number will be frozen
   and will not change between puzzle generations. If you feed the same
   source file to a new puzzle of the same @{"dimensions" link "DimenWINDOW" 0} while the seed is
   locked, the computer will generate the same puzzle every time. Changing
   the dimensions or the input file source will create a different puzzle
   even though the seed will stay the same.

@endnode

@node "UserListWINDOW" "UserList Window"

 @{b}UserList Window@{ub} =======================

   The UserList provides a way for the user to enter and edit words for games
   rather than having to create an external file. By clicking on the 'Copy
   WordList' button the user can edit the puzzle list, if active. A new
   puzzle can be made from the UserList, as long as there are words in it.
   To erase all the data in the listview gadget, click on the 'Clear
   UserList' button.

   To enter or edit words, activate the string gadget by clicking in it or by
   hitting the tab key. You may also click on a word in the listview
   gadget and it will be instantly copied into the string gadget ready for
   editing. To move around the list, use the scroll bar knob or arrows. You
   may also hit the Backspace key and then use the arrow keys to move
   through the list. The list will 'wrap around' to the beginning if you
   scroll beyond the last word, or to the end if you scroll up past the
   first word in the list.

   To delete words, select them in the listview and then hit the Del key.
   Alternatively, enter the string gadget while the word is selected and then
   clear it (Right Amiga + X). The word will disappear from the list and you
   can enter a new word into the string gadget.

   You may type single words or entire sentences into the string gadget and
   they will go into the list. Just keep in mind that if you want to make a
   puzzle from your entries, you should only use characters that you
   will have in your specified @{"character set" link "H_Custom" 0} for the puzzle. The program
   will also split any strings that include spaces or non-printable
   characters.

@node "PrintReqWINDOW" "Printout Window"

 @{b}Printout Graphic/Text Window@{ub} =======================

   The Print/Output window can display either of two menus: ASCII (text)
   OPTIONS or GRAPHICS OPTIONS displays. You can set the various buttons
   and other values to control the nature of the printing. Printing
   can be sent to the printer, the clipboard, or a file, depending on
   the choice of item to be output. Click on the 'GRAPHICS MENU' or
   'ASCII MENU' in  order to call up the alternate set of controls.
   Here is a full description of each of the gadget sets for each
   option display:
 ____________________ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 ASCII MENU:

 @{bg shine}Word Columns@{bg back} gadget: This gadget can be set to 'multiple' or
                      'single'. If 'multiple' is selected, the
                      words lists will be arranged in three columns
                      instead of a single column if 'single' is
                      displayed in the button.

 @{bg shine}Output To?@{bg back} gadget:   This gadget selects the desired output device
                      for ASCII text when the 'PRINT TEXT' button is
                      clicked. You may select 'Printer', 'File', or
                      'Clipboard' with this gadget.

 @{bg shine}Spacing@{bg back} gadget:      This gadget can be set to 'spaces' or 'tabs'.
                      If you are planning to output a puzzle or
                      word list to a file for use in a word processor,
                      for example, you may wish to choose 'tabs' if
                      the font you will be using is proportional.
                      Otherwise vertical alignment of the columns of
                      letters or words will be difficult to achieve.
                      The setting of this gadget controls both text

                      will scale the dimensions of the graphics printout
                      in order to maintain an aspect ration close to that
                      shown on the screen. If it unchecked, you can control
                      the proportion of width to height in any way you
                      choose with the %Width and %Height gadgets.

 @{bg shine}Center@{bg back} gadget:       If your printer supports centering commands,
                      checking this button will cause the puzzle or answer
                      keys to be centered between the left and right margins
                      of the page rather than justified left. You can also

@node "ToolTypes" "ToolTypes"

 @{b}Workbench Icon ToolType Arguments@{ub} =======================

   ToolTypes are a standard feature of the Amiga Workbench that allow
   arguments in icons to be passed to a program so as to control
   aspects of the program's operation. To change a ToolType, select
   the icon on the Workbench by clicking on it once, then select
   'Information' from the Workbench menu. You will see a list of
   the icon's current ToolTypes and can then edit them or enter new
   ones. See your AmigaDOS documentation for further information.

   WordHunt supports many ToolType arguments, though some only have
   an effect on the program when it first boots. Other ToolTypes, if
   included in a text file icon, for example, can control the
   aspects of a puzzle created from it at any time. If you want the
   program to read a file but ignore its ToolTypes, uncheck the
   '@{"Use ToolTypes?" link "H_ToolTypes" 0}' menu item in the @{"Settings Menu" link "Settings" 0} list.

   Here is a ToolType-by-ToolType description of arguments and their
   parameters:

   @{i}The following ToolTypes are meaningful only when the program
   is initiated:@{ui}

   @{b}CLIPUNIT@{ub}
     This ToolType, followed by a number between 0 - 255, will set the
     clipboard device unit number that WordHunt will use. Any other
     programs wanting to read clips form WordHunt must use the same
     device unit number for the Clipboard. The default is Unit 0.

   @{b}QUITWARNING@{ub}
     Specify this with or without parameters to prevent the warning
     requester from appearing when you attempt to quit the program.

   @{b}NEWPUZZWARNING@{ub}
     Specify this with a 'YES' or 'NO' parameter to control the
     appearance of a warning requester to let you know that you will
     lose your current puzzle, if present, when creating a new puzzle.

   @{b}PUBSCREEN@{ub}
     Use with the name of a Public Screen (or WORKBENCH) to make
     WordHunt run on your choice of screen. The AppIcon and AppMenu
     item will only appear on the Workbench, however.

   @{b}FONT@{ub}
     Specify a font and font size in the format <FONT,SIZE> after
     this ToolType. The font is the font used to display and print
     the puzzle and answer key windows.

   @{b}ICONPATH@{ub}
     This should be followed by a path and file name that the program
     will use to locate the .info file for the AppIcon that you wish
     the program to use on the Workbench.

   @{b}SETTINGS@{ub}
     Follow this ToolType with the path name of the Settings file you want
     to use when the program starts. The default is WHSettings.prefs in
     the same directory that the program is started from.

   @{b}ICON_X@{ub}
     Follow this with the X position in screen pixels to locate the WordHunt
     AppIcon.

   @{b}ICON_Y@{ub}
     Follow this with the Y position in screen pixels to locate the
     WordHunt AppIcon.

   @{b}WORDFILE@{ub}
     Follow this with the path of any file you wish to be parsed on program
     bootup. The program will attempt to create a new puzzle and display it.
     If the computer can not find and hide any words the program will
     start without an active puzzle.

   @{i}The following ToolTypes are always read, as long as 'Use ToolTypes' is
   checked in the Settings Menu:@{ui}

   @{b}FINALSAY@{ub}
     Follow this ToolType with a string to be spoken (if speech is enabled)
     When a puzzle is solved.

   @{b}SPEAKALWAYS@{ub}
     This ToolType, with or without parameters, will tell the program to
     speak any found string, including numbers and foreign words, if the
     'Speech' menu item is checked it 'Settings...Bells & Whistles.'

   @{b}DISABLE/ENABLE@{ub}
     These two ToolTypes allow you to specify two parameters, KEY, and
     WORDLIST, to enable or disable. Disabling the Wordlist prevents the
     user from revealing words by clicking on words in the @{"WordHunt listview" link "MainWINDOW" 0}
     gadget. Disabling the @{"AnswerKey" link "AnswerWINDOW" 0} will close it, if open, and prevent it
     from appearing on the screen. If specifying both KEY and WORDLIST,
     Separate the two with the vertical line character. You should also note
     that if either feature is disabled when the program is started, the
     disabled state will be restored after a later ENABLE command.

   @{b}CUSTOMFILE@{ub}
     Follow this ToolType with the path name for a file to be read in as the
     character set to be used when constructing CUSTOM puzzles.

   @{b}CHARACTERSET@{ub}
     The parameters for this ToolType may be NUMERIC, ENGLISH, or
     CUSTOM.

   @{b}WIDTH@{ub}
     This argument, when followed by a number, will set the width in
     characters for the 'current' x @{"dimension" link "DimenWINDOW" 0}.

   @{b}HEIGHT@{ub}
     This argument, when followed by a number, will set the height in
     characters for the 'current' y dimension.

   @{b}MAXWORDS@{ub}
     A parameter between 3 and 150 will specify the maximum number of
     words allowed in any puzzle. The default is 150. In practice even
     the largest puzzles will not usually contain more than 60-75 words.

   @{b}RANDOMSEED@{ub}
     Specify a number after this ToolType to pre-load the random number
     generator. This can allow a file to always generate the same
     puzzle.

   @{b}DISPLAYICON@{ub}
     This ToolType may be specified without parameters in order to tell
     the program to display the WordHunt AppIcon on the Workbench screen.

   @{b}ALPHABETIZE@{ub}
     This ToolType can cancel the default nature of the program to display
     a newly created puzzle's word list in ascending ASCII order.
     A ToolType parameter of 'NO' can make puzzle solving slightly more
     challenging.

@endnode

@node "CLI" "CLI Usage"
@next "Main"

 @{b}Using WordHunt from a CLI Shell@{ub} =======================

   WordHunt may be started from a CLI shell. If no command line parameters
   are given then the program will open on the screen just as if you had
   clicked on the program icon. If you use the appropriate command line
   arguments, however, the program can output to the CLI or a redirection
   file, if specified. Other command line arguments can be given to
   control the size of the puzzle, the random number seed, the material
   to output, and other features.

   There are limitations to this mode of operation. You can only output
   ASCII text versions of the word list, answer key, and puzzle matrix.
   You can only use the alphabetic English (default) or the numeric puzzle
   type option.

   ToolTypes arguments are passed to the program if the current directory
   is set to the program's directory and a GUI (Graphic User Interface)
   is requested.

   If you include any command line arguments and want to make the program
   open its graphical interface, you should include the 'GUI' argument
   on the line.

   The command template is as follows:

   FR0M=FILE/K,SET=SETTINGS/K,P=PUZZLE/S,W=W0RDS/S,K=KEY/S,S=SEED/N/K,
   X=WIDTH/N/K, Y=HEIGHT/N/K,NOGUI/S,GUI/S,N=NUMERIC/S:

   @{b}FROM@{ub} (or @{b}FILE@{ub})  followed by a path name specifies the file to be
                   parsed for the puzzle's words.

   @{b}SET@{ub}             followed by a path name specifies the settings file
   (or @{b}SETTINGS@{ub})   to be used if a GUI is desired. The default is to use
                   the settings file (WHSettings.prefs) in the programs'
                   directory.

   @{b}P@{ub} (or @{b}PUZZLE@{ub})   This flag will cause a puzzle to be included in
                   the CLI output, or, if the GUI flag is set, will
                   be used for the puzzle upon startup.

   @{b}K@{ub} (or @{b}KEY@{ub})      This flag will cause an answer key to be included in
                   the CLI output.

   @{b}W@{ub} (or @{b}WORDS@{ub})    This flag will cause a word list to be included in
                   the CLI output.

   @{b}S@{ub} (or @{b}SEED@{ub})     Will load the random number generator for the first
                   puzzle generated.

   @{b}X@{ub} (or @{b}WIDTH@{ub})    Follow this with the desired width of the puzzle, in
                   characters. If the x dimension is specified in the
                   program icon's ToolTypes and you also specified the GUI
                   option flag, the CLI argument will have no effect.

   @{b}Y@{ub} (or @{b}HEIGHT@{ub})   Follow this with the desired height of the puzzle, in
                   characters. If the y dimension is specified in the
                   program icon's ToolTypes and you also specified the GUI
                   option flag, the CLI argument will also have no effect.

   @{b}NOGUI@{ub}           This flag is included for compatibility reasons. It will
                   be overridden by the presence of the GUI flag on the
                   argument line.

   @{b}GUI@{ub}             This will cause WordHunt to open up its normal Graphical
                   User Interface (GUI).

   @{b}NUMERIC@{ub}         This flag will cause the puzzle to only include numbers
                   in its character set. The specified input file will only
                   be parsed for number strings when this option is set.

@endnode

@node "H_New Puzzle" "New Puzzle Menu Item"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}New Puzzle@{ub} Menu Item (Project Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   This menu item has three subitems which allow you to load data from
   three input sources to create new puzzles. You can input data from
   Files, from the Clipboard, and from the User List.

 @{u}From File@{uu} (sub item)

   WordHunt will parse virtually any type of file. If it finds strings
   that will fit in the puzzle's current size, which you can set using the
   @{"Dimension window" link "DimenWINDOW" 0}, and that contain only printable characters defined by
   the @{"Custom character set" link "H_Custom" 0}, the program will create a new puzzle for you.
   When loading files from the file requester, any icon associated with
   that file is ignored. If you want ToolTypes to be read by the program,
   load the program by dragging the icon onto either the @{"WordHunt window" link "MainWINDOW" 0}
   or the @{"Puzzle window" link "PuzzleWINDOW" 0}. When the pointer is over the window, release the
   button. WordHunt will read the data and try to create a puzzle, but
   will also use the @{"ToolType arguments" link "ToolTypes" 0}, if any, to define various
   characteristics of the puzzle. If the icon belongs to a saved puzzle or
   to a preferences file, then the file will be processed for these file types.
   If you really want to load these types of files to use any text strings
   in them for puzzles, try loading them in from the requester rather than
   by dragging and dropping their icons.

   Remember that the current setting of the @{"character set" link "H_PuzzType" 0} will determine the
   kind of character data the program will parse to extract strings. If
   after attempting to load data for a new puzzle you get a requester
   warning that no words could be placed in the puzzle, check the character
   set setting. Select English Alphabet and try making your new puzzle again.
   If the program still can not find any words, the input may not contain any
   ASCII data of the right string length.

 @{u}From Clipboard@{uu} (sub item)

   The option will immediately look to see if the clipboard contains any
   valid text clips and then will try to create a puzzle with that data.
   You can cut or copy text data from your word processor, a CLI window, or
   other programs that support the Amiga clipboard. Graphics may be included
   in such clips, and will be ignored by WordHunt.

 @{u}From User List@{uu} (sub item)

   Select the From User List menu sub item to create a puzzle from the
   data in the User List. The User List is the list of text strings that you
   may enter and edit directly in the @{"User List window" link "UserListWINDOW" 0}.

   This menu item will be ghosted if there are currently no data present in
   the list.

@endnode

@node "H_OldPuzz" "Load Saved Puzzle..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Load Saved Puzzle...@{ub} Menu Item (Project Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   If you want to continue solving a puzzle that you saved previously,
   choose this menu item. A requester will pop up that you can use to
   select a file. If the file is not a saved WordHunt puzzle, the
   program will present a requester allowing you to choose another
   file or abort the command.

   The timer will be updated to reflect the total elapsed time for
   that puzzle as was saved with the puzzle file. The random number
   seed used to create the saved puzzle will also appear in the Seed
   window. The words in the puzzle window will look just as when the
   file was saved.

@endnode

@node "H_SaveOld" "Save"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Save@{ub} Menu Item (Project Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   You may save the puzzle that is currently in play by selecting
   this menu item.

   If you have not already loaded a previously saved puzzle or have
   not yet saved a puzzle then a requester will appear asking for a
   file path name to use to store the puzzle.

   If you have previously saved or loaded a saved puzzle then WordHunt
   will immediately save your puzzle using the path name that was last
   used and no file requester will appear. If you wish to save to a
   new file, select the @{"Project, Save As..." link "H_SaveOldAs" 0} menu item.

   The saved puzzle file will contain the words you have found and
   the elapsed play time. You can resume play on the saved puzzle at
   any time.

@endnode

@node "H_SaveOldAs" "Save As..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Save As...@{ub} Menu Item (Project Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   This menu item will bring up a save requester, allowing you to specify
   the directory and file name to save your current puzzle.

   When you save your current puzzle, the file will contain the words
   you have found and the elapsed time. You can resume play on the
   saved puzzle at any time.

@endnode

@node "H_Printout" "Print/Output"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Print/Output...@{ub} Menu Item (Project Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   This menu item will open and close the @{"Printout window" link "PrintReqWINDOW" 0} that will
   let you make settings for what and how you want to print.

   This window contains gadgets that you can set to configure the data to
   print and its format. Puzzles may be output to the printer, the clipboard,
   or files. Graphic image data may only be output to files or to the
   printer. A button gadget in the window initiates the output of data.

@endnode

@node "H_Hibernate" "Hibernate"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Hibernate@{ub} Menu Item (Project Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   Selecting Hibernate from the menu will close all currently open WordHunt
   windows. The program is still in memory, and will retain any current
   puzzles, window size and positions, and menu settings.

   To reactivate the program, double click on the WordHunt @{"AppIcon" link "H_AppIcon" 0}, if
   present on the Workbench, or select the WordHunt menu item in the
   Workbench Tools menu. Dropping a file icon on the AppIcon or selecting
   the Tools menu item while an icon is selected will also reawaken
   WordHunt. In this instance WordHunt will also attempt to process the
   data referenced by the icon associated with the selected icon.

@endnode

@node "H_About" "About"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}About...@{ub} Menu Item (Project Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   This command opens the @{"About window" link "AboutWINDOW" 0}. To close the window, type '?'
   without the Right Amiga key, or click on the About window's
   closebox gadget.

@endnode

@node "H_Quit" "Quit WordHunt"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Quit WordHunt@{ub} Menu Item (Project Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   This menu command will close all windows and stop the running of the
   WordHunt program. A warning requester will pop up asking if you really
   want to quit, unless this feature is disabled using a @{"ToolType" link "ToolTypes" 0} argument
   when the program is first started.

   Another way to quit WordHunt is by clicking on the @{"WordHunt window" link "MainWINDOW" 0}'s
   closebox gadget in the upper left corner of the window.

@endnode

@node "H_UserList" "User List..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}User List...@{ub} Menu Item (Edit Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

   This command will open and close the @{"User List window" link "UserListWINDOW" 0}.

   The User List window allows keyboard entry and editing of words. You may
   also edit the puzzle's word list as well.

@endnode

@node "H_Dimensions" "Dimensions..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Dimensions...@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This item will open and close the @{"Dimensions window" link "DimenWINDOW" 0}.
  The Dimensions window allows controlling the size of your puzzles.

@endnode

@node "H_Seed" "Random Seed..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Random Seed...@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This command will open and close the @{"Random Seed window" link "SeedWINDOW" 0}.
  The seed value determines how the puzzle will create your puzzles and allows
  for some control of repeatability of the puzzles.

@endnode

@node "H_Font" "Font..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Font...@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This command will open a Font requester. Choose a font and
  font size that you want to use in the current puzzle, if open,
  and for subsequent puzzles, their windows, and their graphic
  output.

@endnode

@node "H_PuzzType" "Character Set"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Character Set@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This menu item has three subitems: 'English Alphabet',
  'Numeric', and 'Custom'. Only numbers will appear in the
  puzzle if 'Numeric' is chosen, and the program will only
  select numbers from text strings in source files when
  building new puzzles. If you want to make puzzles with other
  character sets, choose 'Custom'. This will set the character
  set to the internal set. You can @{"load in new sets" link "H_Custom" 0} at any
  time.

@endnode

@node "H_Custom" "Load Custom..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Load Custom...@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  Use this command to bring up a file requester into which you
  can specify a file to define a new character set.

  You can make your own custom files very easily in your word processor
  or editor by typing in any set of characters. The list should be in
  a single line without spaces, although the loader will process
  almost any file, looking for printable characters and eliminating
  duplicate letters. The list can be of any size.

  You could, for example, make puzzles with only the letters 'ABCD' in them.
  To do this, create a simple text file with only these letters in it and
  store your custom character set in the Custom drawer or in a directory of
  your choice. Later, specify your custom file in the 'Settings/
  Load Custom..." menu item, then switch the 'Settings/Character Set/'
  to 'Custom'. Now any data that you load as a new puzzle will only be
  parsed for the letters in your custom file.

@endnode

@node "H_RestoreCust" "Restore Custom..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Restore Custom to Default@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This will restore the custom character set to the internal default,
  which is the international alphabet. Keep in mind that the display
  font that you choose with the Font menu item should include glyphs
  for any character defined in the custom character set file.

  To set the custom character set to another set, choose @{"Load Custom..." link "H_Custom" 0}
  from the @{"Settings menu" link "Settings" 0} and specify an ASCII text file to serve to
  define the set.

@node "H_ToolTypes" "Use ToolTypes?"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Use ToolTypes?@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This menu item, if checked, will enable WordHunt to read in settings
  information from an icon's @{"ToolTypes arguments" link "ToolTypes" 0} when creating new
  puzzles from an icon. These include puzzle dimensions, the custom
  character set file and menu setting, and random seed values, for example.

  With this menu item unchecked, ToolTypes settings will be ignored when
  creating new puzzles from icons dropped in the @{"appwindows" link "MainWINDOW" 0}.

@endnode

@node "H_CreateIcons" "Create Icons?"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Create Icons?@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  The program can optionally save icons with puzzle projects saved using
  the various save items in the @{"Project menu" link "Project" 0}. These icons can be
  used later from the Workbench for booting WordHunt and opening a previously 
  saved puzzle.

@endnode

@node "H_ForceDimen" "Force Dimensions?"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Force Dimensions?@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  When this menu item is selected it will toggle between a checked and
  unchecked state. When it has the checkmark, whatever the current
  width and height dimension settings for the puzzle will be used as the
  size of the next puzzle created by WordHunt, overriding any ToolTypes
  settings that may be indicated by an icon. If the menu item is unchecked,
  an icon's @{"ToolType" link "ToolTypes" 0} settings for width and height, if given, will be
  used as the dimension settings and WordHunt will ignore the current
  dimensions as shown in the @{"Dimension window" link "DimenWINDOW" 0}.

@endnode

@node "H_LoadPrefs" "Load Settings..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Load Settings...@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  The Settings file you specify in the file requester will be loaded.
  Settings files store information on window positioning, menu status,
  and other aspects of the current state of the program, such as path
  names and search patterns used in the various load and save requesters.

  Path names and search patterns as they appear in the various requesters
  are used only when the program first starts.

@endnode

@node "H_SavePrefs" "Save Settings"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Save Settings@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This @{i}always@{ui} saves to the default settings file. Normally this
  file is found in the same directory as the program, unless you set
  a @{"ToolType" link "ToolTypes" 0} specifying the settings file in the icon that started the
  program. In this case, the file you specified becomes the default
  settings file.

@endnode

@node "H_SavePrefsAs" "Save Settings As..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Save Settings As...@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  To specify a file other than the default settings file in which to
  store your current settings, choose this menu item. A requester will
  pop up in which you may specify any path name you wish.

@endnode

@node "H_LoadDefPrefs" "Load Default"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Load Default@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This command will always try to load in the default settings file, which is
  usually stored in the same directory from which the program is loaded. By
  setting the program icon's ToolType SETTINGS parameter, you can specify a
  different default settings file. See @{"ToolTypes" link "ToolTypes" 0} for more information.

@endnode

@node "H_Bells" "Bells & Whistles"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Bells & Whistles@{ub} Menu Item (Settings Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This menu item has two subitems: 'Speech' and 'Sound Effects'.
  Either or both of these items may be checked or unchecked in
  any combination. If neither is checked, then no sound or
  speech will occur when you find a word in the puzzle. If
  'Speech' is checked and if the character set is set to 'English
  Alphabet', then any found word will be spoken by the computer.
  If the set is numeric or custom, and if 'Sound Effects'
  is enabled, then a brief musical event will sound when you find a
  word. If you want to have numbers or custom strings spoken, you may
  force speech for all @{"puzzle types" link "H_PuzzType" 0} by setting the SPEAKALWAYS @{"ToolType" link "ToolTypes" 0}.

@endnode

@node "H_Puzzle" "Puzzle..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Puzzle...@{ub} Menu Item (Display Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This menu item will open and close the @{"Puzzle window" link "PuzzleWINDOW" 0}. The
  menu item will be disabled if there is no active puzzle.
  
  Whenever you open the puzzle window the timer will be put into Run mode,
  whether or not the @{"Timer window" link "TimerWINDOW" 0} is open at the time. Closing
  the puzzle window pauses the timer.

@endnode

@node "H_Key" "Answer Key..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Answer Key...@{ub} Menu Item (Display Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This menu item will open and close the @{"Answer Key window" link "AnswerWINDOW" 0},
  unless disabled through a @{"ToolTypes" link "ToolTypes" 0} setting. This menu item will also
  be disabled if there is no puzzle currently loaded into WordHunt.

@endnode

@node "H_Timer" "Timer..."

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Timer...@{ub} Menu Item (Display Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  This menu item will open and close the @{"Timer window" link "TimerWINDOW" 0}.
  The Timer lets you keep track of how long it takes to solve a puzzle.

  The Timer will be in pause mode if a puzzle window is not open, or if
  you place the timer in pause mode yourself. Reopening a @{"puzzle window" link "PuzzleWINDOW" 0} or
  bringing the program out of @{"Hibernation" link "H_Hibernate" 0} will automatically start the
  timer, if a puzzle is currently loaded into WordHunt.

@endnode

@node "H_Circle" "Circle Words?"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}Circle Words?@{ub} Menu Item (Display Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  There are two ways in which hidden and discovered words are displayed in
  the puzzle and answer key windows.

  When the 'Circle Words' menu item is checked, any found words will be
  encircled. Depending on the puzzle's size or the display font, you may
  prefer to see the alternate display method, which draws lines between
  letters; the lines and letters also appear in a contrasting color. This
  method of display may be less satisfactory, however, in cases where the
  puzzle's @{"display font" link "H_Font" 0} does not have a complete set
  of glyphs for showing the vertical and diagonal paths through the
  hidden strings.

@endnode

@node "H_AppIcon" "AppIcon"

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shadow}AppIcon@{ub} Menu Item (Display Menu)@{uu}@{fg text}

  When this menu item is checked an AppIcon will appear on the
  Workbench screen. Deselecting the menu item will remove it
  from the screen. You may double click on the AppIcon to bring
  all the WordHunt windows forward and also to bring WordHunt
  out of @{"Hibernation" link "H_Hibernate" 0}. You may also drag and drop file icons onto
  the AppIcon, which will also activate the program and attempt
  to process the file associated with the icon.

  The Workbench Tools menu will also include a WordHunt menu item whenever
  WordHunt is in memory. You can use this menu item in the same manner as
  the WordHunt appIcon to activate the program and to load in files.
