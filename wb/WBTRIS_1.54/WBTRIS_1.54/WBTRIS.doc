      But have also a look at the shellarguments!

      Double-click on its icon.
      WBTRIS is now started.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

   Runs under Workbench 2.04 and newer.
   You need the font 'helvetica 13'!
   You need the following libraries:
      - mathieeedoubbas.library
      - mathieeedoubtrans.library
      - diskfont.library

USING AND PLAYING WBTRIS

   If you have specified an ENV-variable 'WBTRIS' with includes a path and filename
   (for example: 'setenv WBTRIS "S:WBTRIS.scores"'), the hiscore-file will be
   saved to this path/filename.

   In the left upper corner there is a field where you can see the next tile
   while playing. Switch it on or off in the options window.

   Below that place you can find 4 displays to show the hiscore, score, level
   and how many lines you have made.

   Below these displays are some Gadgets.
      Pause/Go on:   When you click on this gadget the playfield will be erased
                     and a little 'pause-picture' will be shown. The gadget text
                     is now 'Go on'. Another click lets you return to your game
                     and restores the playfield.

      Statistic:     You get a little window with a statistic about the number
                     of the tiles fallen down. You can press this button only
                     in pause-mode.

      Options:       See 'OPTIONS WINDOW'

      New game:      The playfield will be cleared, a little window pops up
                     and shows the 10 best players. After closing this window
                     a new game begins.

   To control the tilemovements you have 5 keyboardkeys, which are:
      Return (default):        lets the tile fall down to ground

      Space (default):         lets the tile fall down quicker than normal

      Cursor right (default):  lets the tile move to the right

      Cursor left (default):   lets the tile move to the left

      Cursor up (default):     lets the tile rotate to the right

      Cursor down (default):   lets the tile rotate to the left

   To quit the game click the close-gadget or pres ESC.

   How to calculate the score:
      Score = KilledLines^2 * 5              (Level = 0)
      Score = KilledLines^2 * 10 * Level     (Level > 0)
      Score = FallenPiece * Level

TILEFILE-FORMAT:

   It's just a simple textfile. You can design your own Tiles (7 pieces).
   '1' stands for the visible part of a tile.
   '0' stands for the invisible part.
   You can put comments into the TileFile but never use a '1' or a '0' as
   a comment! Have a look at the file 'Tiles.dat'. It's quite simple.
