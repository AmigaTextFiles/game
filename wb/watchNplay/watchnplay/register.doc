Before looking at this registration doc,
pls make sure you have the latest update
from aminet, as the price may rise.

Since I want every registered user to get the latest versions,
I prefer sending them by Email, and won't send by snail mail.




You can now buy watchNplay through PayPal!


-ETERNAL NON LIMITED UPDATES- costs:

30 US Dollars
(this means you get ALL new versions)


-ONE UP TO DATE FULL VERSION- costs:

5 US Dollars


Make payable to joar.berntsen@netcom.no
www.paypal.com for more info.

You will then receive your very own up to date compiled exes,
and probably very fast too. (0-2 days)




Other Purchase Options:

I have decided that if you live outside of norway, you have to
convert your money to norwegian NOK or Euro before sending them,
im sorry, I know this makes the price steeper for those,
but the alternative is that I spend a well portion
of the fee to actually make it money for me to use.



-ETERNAL NON LIMITED UPDATES- cost:

300 NOK - norske kroner (norwegian crowns)
or 36 Euro

-ONE UP TO DATE FULL VERSION- cost:

50  NOK
or 7 Euro



hide the cash in a letter,
sign a cheque,
or any other way you want,
and tell me by email how you sent it,
so that I know, and can expect it.

someone said that transferring from and to a bank account
is much better, so you can do that too. but I won't
show my account number here, available for every hacker
in the world, so pls ask me by email what my account number is.
When the transfer is complete, you should tell me by email,
so that I can check it as fast as possible,
for then to send your copy.

it takes time to send a letter,
and it may take time before I get my account checked,
so both ways are as fast I think.



-------

You MUST provide your email!

-------



If you send the fee,
and tell me by email that it is on its way,
BEFORE a new version of watchNplay appear on aminet,
( where the price may be higher ),
then your payment will be sufficient!
and you won't have to pay any extra!
because registered users
are not affected by later prices.



 When you register ,you

 -have no startup delay.
 -have no timeout
 -have User defined width and height,Eks: 110*160 or 390*320,..etc
  all modes are relative to size.
 -get new and better modes in updates.
 -support Amiga, because I made this shareware so that I
  maybe could buy a modern Amiga with ppc, gfx, and music card,
  IF I get enough.
  I can then also support that specs.
 -get a hand in development, your suggestions/complaints will be taken
  seriously.
 -will not be affected by later price modifications.
  (Its yours forever)

buying one up to date version has the same things
except you will not get newer versions
unless there are major bugs with it.
