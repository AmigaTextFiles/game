the maps are iff.

the maps can be any size,
ColorLander will convert them into the watchNplay window
and it scrolls around the map while playing.

color register 2 (nr 3) is where the lander starts.
It is where the bottomleft corner of the ship is put.


the color landing pads must form a straight horizontal line
that can have any of the 2 shades in the color.
