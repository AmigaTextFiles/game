History of watchNplay from Version 1.47.

v 1.47:
-silly mistake regarding Points refresh fixed. it wouldn't clear window
 when selected. this could also be seen as a feature ;)
-grey or white tail color only, by choice in snake2.
-rewriting "ff8 cards" to the actual game, Triple Triad.
-added standard rules to triple triad, same, plus, bigger.
-Snake2 now has different speeds.
-added a 'cgx' parameter that MAY work, I cant test it.
-replaced startup with a nicer intro, wont show in registered version.
 got routine from the endtro of Simon Smith's excellent game, Flatmates.
-added timeoutro in the style of the intro.

v 1.5:
-I decided to add former updates in 'History.doc' from now on.
-different ante's and starting pots in poker.
-scrolling log in poker now tells in 'past' instead of the
 'present' formuling of the words. so its the same as
 in the GUI window.
-log window in poker has options in the menu. normal or interesting.
-colors in poker has been reworked. and has now much better
 graphical understandment.
-more draw effects in picture.
-poker AI's acting speeds can now be altered in the menu.
-poker log is now cleared when a new deal is dealt.
 If anyone want this as selective, pls email me.
-no more annoying bright text for boring things in poker log.
-the society in ant commander now grows by making more eggs
 when food is plenty.
-rightforce2 mode removed... Though it could get something,
 I saw it as weed in my code. Just takes up compiling time.
-you can choose the number of AI players in poker. 1-4

v 1.6:
-fixed that colorcycling would'nt restore colors if timeout occured.
-added a new smart colorfinding system.
-Picture have some parts more color variative because of it.
-Fireworks gets better looking sparks.
-added colors for folded AI players on poker.
-hopefully fixed all windowfont problems. the default workbench
 font was used instead of the included <small.font>.
-settings mode now finds some fades of colors to be used in the other modes.
 so that those modes dont have to find them themselves.
-fireworks temporarily uses the gray fade. (sparks fade out)
-triple triad gets solid blocks for its cards.
-colorlines gets better looking squares, like triple triad.
-it now looks nicer when you get a row in colorlines.
-colorlines is now under construction. I intend to make it a columns game.
-added credits section to manual.
-aga is now required in this version.
-changed intro.
-added different resolutions for color finding in settings mode. I dont have a     gfx card, so if someone with 1 could tell me if the highest works, I would        appreciate it.
-I set the default number of pixels in fireworks to 100 instead of 600, wich was   the setting before. hence its faster on first selection. you can select 1000 if   you want to ofcourse.
-made a space "avoid" game on <UC! text> overwriting most code there. The          <spaceascii> game is still under construction.
-worked heavily on columns (formerly colorlines), it still has some small playing  bugs
-removed snapshots from lha file, uneccesary download time when the prog can make  better 1s each update.

v 1.7:
+made the game spaceascii more bugfree. with better
 collision detection.

+columns have correct rules. "columns, by the book."

+added pause features to columns. The default is 
 window inactiveness.

+fixed that columns didn't find rows within rows.
 
+asked a gfx card user to test Emerald, I got some
 interesting info. I hope he continues to test new
 updates.

+emerald is now called watchNplay. emerald was a
 wierd name and should be forgotten. I think the new
 name suits much better.

+I have now made watchNplay to ignore if depth of
 wb is greater than 8,(256) and only make use of the
 first 256 colors on wb. I have yet to find a way
 to make use of cgx.

+drew a newicon for the new name.

+Spaceascii is increasingly difficult as you progress
 (into space)
 
+Increased price of registering. and You can only pay
 in my currency now. sorry. registered users are not
 affected by this.

+nicer use of colors in ant commander (from now on AC)

+ants will eat eachother if you run out of food in AC

+toads and lizards slurps up ants contineously on your
 trails in AC if you dont attack them. AC is just a
 game of survival yet, no goals. feel free to give me
 ideas on this one. remember that I dont update to
 aminet just because I can, but because I want feedback
 in the form of ideas and bugs... etc...

+soundscool, is a new mode where you, can edit a
 looping sound in realtime, and you have some
 helpfull options to do so.

+overhawl of the way Picture handles colors. It looks
 much nicer, but its about 6 times slower between
 draws, and eats cpu cycles while computing colors.

+changed window size of demo to 240*240, mainly to look
 at the new coloreffects in Picture.

+made the new color routine in picture selective, and
 added a 'classic' option using the old way. the default
 is 'both types'.

+soundscool can now change frequency randomly. it sounds
 like an engine, so the option is called 'engine on/off'

+triple triad now displays side numbers of cards close
 to the center, its a little better for overview this
 way. I also want to change the game entirely, tell me
 if you have an idea.

v 1.8:
+fixed a few gfx bugs regarding Soundscool.

+added smooth scrolling to Ant.C's event window.

+Soundscool is now much much faster at editing,
 due to a big rewrite of sample edit code.
 further, the way it was editing before wasn't
 the right way, and samples made with the last
 code had a noise beep.
 
+added operators to Soundscool. currently you
 can noisify and smoothify the whole sample.
 I have also added options of how many times
 it should act per menu hit, and a "continously"
 option wich can do it while you edit with mouse.

-I discovered that you can cheat with block falling
 in columns, and I decided not to fix it until if
 I add a scoring system.

+added simpler way of drawing blocks in columns.
 its much faster on AGA but looks less nice,
 I have therefore made it selective in the menu.
 You can also select what should be drawn
 inside the blocks.

+minimum row length required to remove blocks
 in columns can be raised, for extra difficulty.

+The 13x13 new game in columns was buggy because
 13 is not a paired number. now changed to 14x12.

+added the option of making a big sample out of
 the main small looping one in Soundscool.
 Currently you can make it sound like an instrument.
 and afterwards save it if you wish.
 Its saved IFF, so is usable in music trackers.
  
+added a nosound executable, that does not interfere
 with music, where Soundscool and certain startup
 masking of channels is disabled.

v 1.9
+moved most modes in sub menus.
 <intuiton>, <gfx fx>, <games> and <utilities> 

-removed a complicated, but old and unusable
 mode. (named ??? and pregame).

+replaced <readpixel from bitmap> code with
 arrays in all modes that use this,
 ie:(columns, triple triad, snake2)
 This saves chip mem, and is faster. 

+made Soundscool's instrument generation
 to dim more down in volume. this makes
 it nearly silent at the end of the sample.

+In addition to shareware,
 I've decided to make watchNplay supportware.
 details in support.doc

+added 5 new "drawcodes" to Picture's 4LinesAtATime.
 I don't know any better way to tell you this.

+you can now just push down once in Columns
 and the bricks will be placed at bottom if 
 you select this option from a new menu sub item.

+started on watchNplay.FAQ,
 where common problems should reside.
 
+added a new color option to magicsquare.
 <smooth random change>.
 good if you have many colors.

+added an easy way to resize main window in
 settings mode, for registered users.

+renamed <watchNplay.nosound> to <watchNplay.ns>

+it has been said that paying by transferring
 money from and to a bank account is much better.
 you should be able to pay that way now.
 details in <register.doc>.

+watchNplay can now save window position
 and size to env-archive/
 and it will automatically load the prefs at
 each startup to registered users.
 the demo does not load it.
 I can easily add every other option in all
 modes, but I decided to plan how It should
 be structured first.

+fixed that drawing dimentions was not updated in
 some games when window had been resized. 

+removed the right scrolling in the end
 of the demo intro, because someone reported
 trouble with it. instead, there is a from up
 to bottom clear.

v2.0
+ Soundscool now customizes main window
  to be a better sample editor,
  and will go back to previous settings
  outside of the Soundscool mode.

+ added a window to Soundscool
  wich displays current frequency.
  you can also alter frequency
  in Soundscool with the arrow keys.
  if you choose it from the menu.

+ Added another window to Soundscool
  wich tell you the position
  you are in the sample.
  You can also scroll within the sample
  by holding/clicking mousebutton
  in this window.

- points had a <ground> option
  wich defaultly made a grey ground
  in the window.
  that feature is now completely removed.

+ an old watchNplay.prefs file may have
  incompatibilities with an update,
  so its now deleted if it has a lower
  version number than the update.  
  This is only relevant for Registered
  users.
  A 1.9 prefs file is not compatible
  with version 2.0 and beyond,
  so you have to delete it.

+ The options for what happens when
  the dots in Points reaches a side,
  has been reworked to have independent
  horizontal and vertical menues.
  
+ Soundscool: You can now play the
  small sample just once with a menu
  item or by pressing arrow right key.
     Temporary, it also randomizes the
  period of the sample (pitch).

+ Option to set slide edit's start
  position to beginning of sample
  in Soundscool.

+ <random> item in Points color options
  is renamed to <random at creation>
  because I added an option that
  changes the colors of all points
  at once to random. <all random once>

+ Soundscool now saves samples to ram
  with ascending numbers.
  So if you save three times,
  three files will be made.

+ Its not possible to edit the sample
  in Soundscool without having one of
  the mode windows active.

+ The surviver game in <Gamez> mode
  has a bit larger player,
  and the moving boxes
  are a little smaller.

+ SpaceAscii has some more challenging
  variations, when you get
  further... and further into space :)

+ You can now set priority in Settings.
  -Thanks goes to Peter Thor for this.
  Priority is saved in the prefs file.

+ Started a little on a mode that
  uses the speech on the amiga,
  and is located in Utility menu.

+ Made a new gfx effect mode wich I
  named  <Crystal panorama>.

+ I saw a cool movement effect on an
  amiga web page, where the mouse was
  used to move a whole sentence of text
  with a delay between each character.
     I have now implemented a similar
  effect in Points, called <rope from mouse>
  because it is similar to that of when
  you quickly move a rope end up and down.
  The subitem is placed in
  <gravity/movement> submenu.
     In conjunction with the different
  lines options in points, this feature
  proves indeed to be kewl.
  The downside is that all the other
  movement options in points seem dull
  in comparison. :)

+ Soundscool's slide edit feature now
  requires a mouseclick to start editing
  and another to stop.
  This because I grew tired of holding
  the mousebutton down. :)

+ Right force mode has got a comet like
  tail on the flying bullet,
  and the bullet travels faster.
  This mode also supports leave
  and reenter, fully now.
  
+ <MagicSquare>'s default settings has
  been set to draw the actual square
  instead of the patience requiring
  single dot drawing.
  the <random interval> clear option
  from menu has also been set as default. 

+ Added a <utterly random> color option to
  Fireworks,

+ Fixed a horrible freezing start bug in 
  Ant Commander,
  by increasing a maximum value.
  
+ moved the effects, games, and utilities
  apart from eachother in the Guide.doc.
  I also removed many typos.

- Doubled price of fully featured
  eternal updates (registration).

+ Triple Triad has been named
  <Neverending Qonquest>,
  to avoid any resemblence to the much more
  stylish original version in final fantasy 8,
  and because my version has some other rules.
  
+ watchNplay now checks if the included
  small.font is installed in fonts:
  
+ I discovered that the game
  <Neverending Qonquest>
  got a well established crashing bug when I
  on an earlier version replaced
  ingame mapping, so I have chosed to put
  it out of reach from users until I 
  figure out how to easily fix it.

+ Unregistered users can now choose
  three different window sizes.
     The size can be anything within the
  dimentions of your Workbench
  in the registered version.

v2.1
+ Fixed freeze bug in points's
  <rope from mouse> feature,
  and the rope behaves normally
  beyond the window borders now.

+ Added a <random fade at creation>
  color option in points. 

+ Added star like, 5 pixel, optional
  drawing in Points.
  at the moment, it creates graphical
  bugs when used with fountain, but
  I chose to ignore it because it
  looks nice when Random fade color
  option is enabled. 

+ Changed the names of some menuitems
  in Points.

+ Points now has sound.
  With the menuitem <Sound/solo at bounce>
  the points play nearly like on a piano
  when they bounce at bottom.
  You can replace the solo sound with
  whatever sound you want.
    The executable needs the <sound>
  directory in its root to work.
  
+ If you have had trouble starting
  watchNplay on graphic cards,
  then that may be fixed now.

- note:any patches on your system may make
  watchNplay freeze/crash when using the menus.
  -one of MagicMenu's options may do so.


v2.2

:Misc:

-Removed the game
 formerly known as <Triple Triad>. 

+I think watchNplay will work to most
 gfx card users now,  because I removed
 a very silly simple thing that tried to change
 the workbench screen into an aga bitmap.

+GimmerZero window instead of borderless
 is now selectable on startup.
  GimmerZero windows take up more chip mem,
 but will never have its borders
 graphically bugged.

-removed zoom mode.
 Im going berzerk! 8D

-removed grab from WB feature in Picture mode.
 

:Settings mode:

+Added option to alter background
 color in settings mode,
 wich is saved in the prefs file.

+Thanks to continous development
 of AmiBlitz2,
 I have been able to write a
 much better savefile.


:Points mode:

+Fixed fountain and star field
 leaving gfx unerased
 when star drawing is enabled.

+Made trail feature
 default to on
 when any scroll option is enabled.
 so that it won't use unnecessary time
 to try to erase the points.

+Fixed a typo in placing points with
 the mirror feature.
 now it works correctly again.


:Crystal panorama mode:

+Added smooth change color option.
 

:Ant commander:

+Fixed problems regarding opening
 of windows.
 (doesn't crash or screw up menues)


v2.3

:misc:

+ added a 'pretend' mode;
  pretends to be doing some bad stuff.
  Its intended for Computer Parties
  as it could scare the shit out of people. ;)

+ Enlarged demo sizes of the window
  for those with big big screens. 
   -In the fullversion,
  the size can be changed to anything in your desire.

:in poker:

+ fixed a bug in gadget positions.


:in coloreffects:

+ fixed that it didn't restore old colors
  when leaving the mode.


:in columns:

+ fixed that number typing
  was not alligned on borderless window


:in Ant commander:

+ The scrolling window drew a line
  right through the text.
  Now its better.


v2.4

:misc:


+ You can now buy watchNplay through PayPal!

  www.paypal.com for more info.


  -ETERNAL NON LIMITED UPDATES- costs:

  30 US Dollars
  (this means you get all new versions)


  -ONE UP TO DATE FULL VERSION- cost:

  5 US Dollars


  Make payable to joar.berntsen@netcom.no

  You will then receive your very own up to date compiled exes,
  and probably very fast too. (0-2 days)




- Prefs file changed,
  so registered users must delete their
  sys:prefs/env-archive/watchNplay.prefs file.

  ALL files are now also kept inside the program directory.

+ Activated newlook menues of aos3.0 and up.
  I didn't know this existed until now. :/
   Now the menues will be much more compatable
  with your workbench.

  The menu names are also changed.

+ New game, 'ColorLander'.
  Currently with 2 different gametypes.
   I used spaceascii as a subgame for this new game
  and altered spaceascii to the better.
   This is the first time I have made an automated link
  between 2 different modes/progs.
  And it looks good, so I will probably make more such links.
  
+ I wanted to experiment more on how to make AI,
  and instead of adding a set of rules to a game,
  I made it depend on knowledge (past experience)
  so that it could learn to be good itself.
  I couldn't go for a complicated game,
  so I made a 'tic tac toe' game,
  also known as 'noughts and crosses'
   The learning AI algo finally turned out to be a success
  and the game now has various AI knowledge files
  that can be loaded as wished, anything from easy to impossible.
   It also learns (slowly) while you play it.

+ changed position of the quit menuitem,
  by request from a supporting user.

+ 2 additional new games are 'Under Construction'


:in Columns:

+ Optimized many things, including drawing.
  
+ added 7 different special blocks.
  There was none before.

+ secrets. :)

+ I changed name from Columns to Coolumns
  now that I have made it more than a standard clone.

+ narrowed playfield to half, and added score features.

+ The bricks are now drawn without numbers by default,
  since it can confuse when used with the new special blocks
  that has various symbols on them.


:in Points:

+Added a menuitem that gives the points
 predefined position and movement values.


:in poker:

+Thanks to Thilo Kohler, I have now added card gfx
 with his image.include for amiblitz2.
 
 This gfx can also be replaced or edited.


:in Ant commander:

-I moved all ant commander code
 out of watchNplay.
  This because it had little playability
 and was very large in the source.
 
+I may reinstate it in the future,
 as I have the code stored on my hd.
