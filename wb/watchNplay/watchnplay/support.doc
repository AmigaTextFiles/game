supportware:

In addition to shareware,
I've decided to make watchNplay supportware.

supportware may be a non existent term that means:
  If one use the program and send feedback to the
author, one will get the newest full version.
Feedback can be ideas, bugs, or suggestions to modifications.

This is because I would like to get emails from
those who use it,
because that helps me in making it better for
the users and myself.

if you would like to do this, I would have to make
some stupid rules, so that noone can claim a copy
by typing "watchNplay sucks. bye".

pls:

-make it long  (about 80-200 words...?)
-detailed, preferably without undetailed words like
 "good" and "bad"
-insult me and use bad language if that helps you.


to make it easy. write a review, and receive the latest.


registering rewards you all new versions.
supporting rewards you the newest version.
