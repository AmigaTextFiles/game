 Introduction
 ------------

  Many different small games and graphical
  effects in a window, wich is best served
  with music.
  Also includes some creative utilities.
  
  The whole thing started when I got one
  pixel to bounce in a window. :)

 
 Requirements
 ------------

  -An aga or cgx 68k Amiga with workbench,
   or workbench replacement.

  -Any kind of music.
   The 'watchNplay.ns' exe does not interfere with
   sound output.
    Ok, it doesnt NEED music.. but it adds
   a whole lot to the atmosphere of the graphical effects.

  -Fat agnus, or Paula sound chips
   for the Sound stuff.

  
 Installation
 ------------

  keep everything where it is
  when extracted, and it is ok.

  You can run watchNplay by CLI or WB.
  

 Features
 --------

  + Is in a window on the workbench
    and therefore multitasks
  + Uses random variable generation to
    avoid the same over and over again.
  + Changes menu after which mode is on.
  + Has many options for certain modes
    that strenghtens durability.
  + Doesn't need to obtain pens.
    Searches for adequate colors instead.
  + Every mode will stay as you left them
    if you switch to another one. That way
    you can continue a game of <Poker>
    after you, for instance, have looked at
    <Picture> a while.
  + So much more and more depending on the mode!


 Modes
 -----

  Every mode has its own option set,
  and only the options of the running
  mode will be shown.
   modes or options with "UC!" markings
  are Under Construction, and I reccomend
  you not to select them because they are
  incomplete and almost certainly contain bugs.
   But if you do, you are welcome to give me
  suggestions about it.

 Wierd chars reference:

-  = One or more suboptions for the option above.
*  = An independent switch set in the current menu.
     when one is enabled, all others are not.
x# = # for a number. x4 means that your score gained
     in a game are multiplied by 4 ingame or at gameover.


 I will skip modes under construction. UC! markings.



:graphical effect modes: The Effectroom



  Waveznake 
  *********

   A convolment of My 2 first modes.
   not much to look at, but good for
   relax situations.
 
  Points
  ******

   My favourite. The possibilities of the
   options is endless. Your interaction with
   the mouse is especially fun.
   
   the menu is a key to many wierd and
   abstract shows. 

  Face
  ****

   I've never seen an eyes(follow the mouse)
   program with a mouth , here it is.

  Magicsquare
  ***********

   If you leave this mode with the pixel draw option,
   it will make a (beatifull) mandela picture.
   I always forget how nice this mode is.
   
   Not too cpu consuming either.

  Colorcycling
  ************

   Games often use colorfades and such,so why not
   on workbench.

    Note:

    All colors will be stored first and restored
    if you change mode or quit, however if you
    run a palette program or one that obtain pens,
    complications may occur, also if you have 2 or
    more of watchNplay runned in colorcycling.
    your colors wont be changed as long as you dont
    have colorcycling on both.

    AGA only, maybe cgx.
    256 color registers maximum, is used.

  Picture
  *******

   A range of precoded presets, filled with random
   variables. I have made the code in a matter that
   makes it easy to add new drawing calculations.

    Note:

    Because of the structure in this mode,
    the menu reacts slowly, so have patience.

  FireWorks
  *********

   I've seen many fireworks clones,
   and I wanted to make 1 myself.
   Here's the result.

    Controls:

    Space prematurly sets of any rocket
    wich is currently in the air.

  Crystal Panorama
  ****************

   Uses simple up and down draw methods
   to create the result.

   Looking in the center a longer amount
   of time may increase the feel...



:game modes: The Arcade



  Right Force
  ***********

   Basic "How much power do you need to hit" game

    Controls:

    Hold down "down arrow" or mousebutton
    to increase power.

  Gamez
  *****

   2 small games

    Surviver
    --------

   Avoid the blocks using the arrow keys

    Target
    ------

   Click on the blocks before they move out of display

  Poker
  *****

   I have always wanted to make a poker game with
   AI (Artificial intelligence) players.
   I wondered if I was able to code it, and when
   I got the main pieces at place, it was easy
   to outsmart the AIs. But now I hardly ever win
   a pot.
   I've noticed on other poker games that
   you can bluff out the AIs with big raisings,
   but you ought to be careful here.

   This clone is turn based.

    cards:

  --value--
  2-9 = 2-9           -low
    0 = 10
    J = 11  -Jack-
    Q = 12  -Queen-
    K = 13  -King-
    A = 14 or 1 -Ace- -high

  --sort--
    D = Diamond       -low
    H = Hearts
    C = Club
    S = Spade         -high

    rules:

    If you know yatsy, then poker is easy.

    - if you have 2 or more of a number
 or - 2 of one number and 2 or 3 of another
 or - all cards in one sort ie: (S)pade
 or - all cards in runs ie: 8 9 0 J Q or A 2 3 4 5
 or - the 2 above at the same time.

    Then you have something.
    and its evaluated like this:

     -from lowest to highest-

        1 pair = 2 same numbers
       2 pairs = 2+2 same numbers
   3 of a kind = 3 same numbers
      Straight = a run ie: from 2 to 6
         Flush = one sort on all cards
    Full house = 2+3
Straight flush = a run in only one sort
   4 of a kind = 4 same numbers
   Royal flush = a run from 0(10) to A in one sort

  snake2
  ******

   Dont make a clone without adding a new feature.
   This mode should reflect that.

    WARNING!:

    The zoom feature in this mode may not be suitable for
    people with epileptics or similar, I get rather dizzy
    myself sometimes :)

  Spaceascii
  **********

   Navigate your enterprise back home.
   Home is endlessly far away.

    Controls:

     Arrow keys to move more in that direction.


  Coolumns
  ********
   
   I know of many column games, and I love playing
   them, but I want to make it even more fun with
   more features.
   I can play this one for hours.  

    Rules:

    You have to make a line of 3 or more of one color
    to remove them from the board.

    Controls:

     Arrow up to cycle blocks position.
     Arrow down to move faster downwards.
     Left and right arrows to move them
     left and right.
    
     Or joystick if you wish.

  ColorLander
  ***********

   A lander clone mixed with memory and transport concept.
   
   memory:
   You are given a longer sequence of colors
   when you complete the one you have been given before.   
   -Can you navigate your ship
   while remembering the sequence?

    Controls:
   
     arrow keys to thrust.

   
   This game loads maps from data/colorlander/
   and they are fully editable.
   the iff bitmaps can have any width and height.

   A color 2(white) pixel places the player there like this:
 
                    ooo
                   ooooo
                  ooo ooo 
   white pixel--> wo   oo
  
 
   Send me cool maps, and you receive a full version of watchNplay! 



  TicTacToe
  *********

   also known as 'noughts and crosses'.

   the aim is to get a line of 3 in your symbol/color

   select squares with mouse.



  Ant commander -out of watchNplay for the moment-
  *************

   Take charge of a newly established ant colony.
   Find or raid the forest for food, and defend
   yourself against vicious ant eating creatures. 
   
   The soldier ant is more powerfull than the worker,
   but the worker is needed to take care of larvaes
   and collect food from trails.
   
   there is no higher goal in the game yet.



:utility modes:

 

  Soundscool
  **********

   play with atoms pushing eachother to your ear. (sound)
    
   You edit the main window with your mouse
   What you draw is a piece of wave wich is
   played from left to right.

   The slide edit option should be used first,
   as it makes it easy to make a wave.
   You can select <on center> and <-place at start>
   to create the sound from start to end.

   Soundscool is handy to make small samples for games.
 

    WARNING!

    The sound can get noisy,
    so I dont reccomend listening to much
    to a looping sound,
    since you will get a little wierd afterwards. ;)

  



:::Enjoy.:::


 And dont be afraid to select options in the menu.
 A mode may not be much until you do, IE: <Points>.
 No option will formate your harddisk,
 or push the red button.
 

 Troubleshooting
 ---------------

 It may not work on ppc equipped amigas.

 Your workbench should be more than 240*240.
 
 This program will not work on ECS because it
 uses AGA calculations to find colors.


 Known Bugs
 ----------

 Fireworks draws some ugly streaks on the left in the window.

 or know of a way to make a mode more fun,
 or know where "Amiga paradise"
 is located in the world ;)

 Then PLS write an email to joar.berntsen@netcom.no
