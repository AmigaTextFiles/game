Ever seen a 100k sourcecode for a 10k program with 15k documentation ?
No excuse. Here it is, some nightmare haunting me for 7 years :)

The assembler used is OMA (optimising macro assembler) which was sold
by ICP Verlag at a crowded Cologne-Show years ago. I recently tried BarFly,
but it spits out some error messages.  A68k does't like the local labels.

In AddedValue, you may find some cryptic c-tetris versions which
do the graphics with console-i/o.
