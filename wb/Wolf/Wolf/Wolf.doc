Wolf

Remake of a Soviet electronic game. Very popular in
the middle of 80's. 
Collecting eggs falling in four rows. For every crashed egg
you obtain a chicken. After getting three chickens follows 
game over. When bunny is shown and egg crashes you obtain only
half of chicken (blinking). 

Game modes:     Game A  ... slow for beginners
                Game B  ... more eggs, more speed
                
Game speed and number of eggs increases during a play.
After 200 eggs collected one chicken will be erased, after
500 eggs all chickens disappear. Game finishes after collecting
999 eggs.

If someone can provide better graphics I will remake this game. 
Especially original Soviet wolf and bunny would be appreciated.
