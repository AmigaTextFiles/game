                What kind of stupid game is called 'fifteen'?
               -----------------------------------------------
  This a game you can play when you don't have anything better to do.
  It is very simple. When you start the game you will see a grid of 16 
  squares with the numbers 1-15 in random order and an asterisk (*) 
  marking a blank spot. Your mission is to move the numbers in order 
  by moving one of the numbered tiles to the blank until you've finished.

    See '@{"Playing the game" LINK "playing"}'.

  It is very easy at first but wait until you only have the last row 
  left. This is when it gets really frustrating :->.

                                 -----------
  I'm a poor Swedish student who likes to make small totally
  useless :-) programs for the Amiga (the only computer you 
  can use and have fun doing it), and drive my neighbours mad
  by playing the trumpet without mercy (he he).
  
     NOTE: The language and grammar in this document may
     be far from coorect. This is because since this is 
     one of very few times I get to write in English with-
     out getting it valued by my english-teacher, I don't
     have any intention of making it perfect.
     I hope it will be understandable at least.
     
  I used an Amiga 600 without any expansion except an extra-drive (not 
  even a hard drive) to make this game. If anyone wishes to send me an
  A4000 or a PPC-accelerator I would be truly thankful.
  
  Sad to say, I don't have any connection to the Internet (I don't
  even have a modem) so I can't offer you an E-mail adress to contact
  me on. The only possibility to reach me is by Snail-mail:

                               --------------
From the WB:   Just drag the icon to whatever 
               drawer you want to put it in.

From the CLI:  If you want to use the Shell, 
               I bet you are experienced enough
               to do this without my help.
               
What it takes to run it.
              The game has been tested on the following machines:
                    A500 (1MB) (first versions only)
                    A600  
                    A1200
              but I'm pretty sure it will run on any Amiga.

                             ------------------
  Simple. Just point to the number you wish to move to the blank space
  (marked by a white asterisk (*)) and click the mouse. If it is a 
  legal move (you are allowed to move the numbers wich are raised), the
  selected tile and the blank space will switch places. Do this until all 
  numbers are in order (1-15 and the blank at the end). When this is 
  accomplished you have won the game!
  
  Both the number of moves that have been made and the time taken will
  be calculated but I haven't made a highscore function yet. This means
  that your best scores won't be saved (if it's important to you there's
  always pen and paper).

  Well, there's really nothing special about it.
  Perhaps I'll add something fancy in the future, like a prefs window
  or something.
  Greatful for suggestions...

                       Revision history (very brief).
                      -------------------------------- 
    First version.  (never released to the public)
  CLI-based version. I simply opened a console window and read all
  commands from the keyboard. Extremely boring.

    Number two.     (never released to the public)
  Opened a 'real' intuition window, wherefrom the commands where taken.
  You clicked the number you wished to move and the progress was shown
  in a console window.

    Third attempt.  (first release)
  For the first time the actual progress was shown at the same place as
  you gave your orders. For the first time the game became playable ;-)

    Current version (v3.3).
  I'm rather satisfied with this one, actually. I think the GUI looks
  quite nice and I've tested everything I can think of and I haven't
  found any remaining bugs. (Please report if you find any.)

Perhaps I will add a hi-score feature.

                                ------------
  This program is totally FreeWare, copy it as you like, spread it for
  your friends. The only restriction I want to make is that you mustn't
  alter the program or this documentation and that the program mustn't
  be spread without this file (there are both a Swedish and an English
  version included in this archive, you may leave one out if you like as
  long as the documentation isn't skipped).

  If you spread it, you can charge anything you like for it, I don't care.
  If you can convince anyone that it is worth money, you're well worth it...

  If you have any comments, suggestion, bug reports etc. I would like 
  you to tell me about it.
  Also, if you play the game a lot, I would be greatful if you would 
  send me a postcard with a nice picture and tell me what you think 
  about the game. I love getting pretty cards.
  @{"How to get in touch with me" LINK "author"}
  
  I will not take responsibility for any damage whatsoever that this 
  program might cause to your system (hard- or soft-ware), you use it 
  totally on your own risk.
  ( I really don't think there's any risk that anything will happen, 
  it's been thouroughly tested, but I think it's better to be safe 
  than sorry so I wrote this part as well. )
