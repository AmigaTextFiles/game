                          *****************

Change from 1.3:
---------------
- The score is now saved with the level !
- The difficulty is most linear (from the fourth level) 

Description:
------------

This is Just a little game that has the same principle as a game I play
on an IBM compatable.
It opens a window on the workbench, or in any screen you like (it is MUI).
For the small version of the game the screen has to have at least 256
pixels height.
It uses the eight original WB colors.

You control the mouse with the four direction keys. Try to push the blocks
and trap the cat. If the cat can't move he dies (the mysteries of
physiology !)
If two or more cats are blocked side byside they don't die
The cats try to eat you, so be careful.

Warning ! the cats can move in the eight directions ! (and pass through
two blocks diagonally.)

The programm creates two files named "CatTrap.highscore" and "CatTrap.level",
to save the current level and the best score.
If you displace the program then move this file as well.
