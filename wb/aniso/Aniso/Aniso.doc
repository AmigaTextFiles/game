How to play:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The game may be started from either the Workbench or Shell, and takes no
arguments or ToolTypes. It will run on any Amiga with Kickstart 2.04 or later.
I am not an artist, so I haven't supplied an icon - if you design a nice one
and send it to me, I will include it in a future release of Aniso.

Once loaded, you will see a small window, containing two 3*3 "grids", and
several gadgets. One of the grids is already filled with numbers between 1 and
4; the other grid is empty. The idea behind the game is to form an image of
the first grid by clicking on squares in the empty grid. There are only a
couple of simple rules to follow:

You may only click once in each square (ie. the square has to be empty), and
doing this will place a "1" in this square. If it has any non-empty
neighbours, they will all be incremented by 1, with wraparound after 4 (ie. if
it was going to 5, it will go back to 1 again). It probably helps if you play
the game yourself - you will quickly see how it works.

Of course, there are also a few strategies to follow (useful for the larger
board sizes), but I will let you work them out for yourself!

The gadgets are fairly self-explanatory. The cycle gadget on the right allows
you to change the board size, from 3*3 up to 8*8. Shift-clicking it makes it
go backwards (eg. if you want to go from 6*6 to 5*5). Clicking the "New"
button (or pressing N) creates a new board of that size (or just shuffles the
current board if you haven't touched the cycle gadget). The Retry button
clears the second grid, allowing you to start over if you make a mistake. The
Quit button is something I forgot to remove... :-)

If you complete a "level", you will get a "Well Done" message, and I suggest
you use the cycle gadget to try a harder level. (How quick can you complete an
8*8 board?!) If you have filled all the squares in the wrong order, you will
get a different message, and you can either use the New or Retry buttons to
have another go.

Note: It is possible to complete _every_ board which Aniso gives you - the way
it generates them in the first place is by randomly clicking in each square
itself.

Sorry if the game runs a little slowly on an unaccelerated Amiga for the
higher levels - I developed it with a 40MHz 68030-based A2000...

This game is not an original idea - I saw André Wichmann's game "Brain" on a
recent Fish Disk, and decided to write a version for the Workbench screen (his
used a yukky low-res NTSC screen). I have yet to add coloured squares and an
"Undo Move" button, but they may follow (requires an 8/16-colour WB screen, of
course).

Thanks to Bryan Ford (author of MultiPlayer) for outlining a random number
generator in one of his messages to me.

Thanks to HiSoft for one of the best-written Amiga applications - DevPac
v3.02. Source code to Aniso is included; it may require slight changes for
other assemblers (but everyone should be using DevPac anyway!). One of the
reasons you might like to look at the source is to see how I have handled the
problem of everyone using different fonts for their WB screen. Aniso correctly
handles just about every font combination -  I hope!!
