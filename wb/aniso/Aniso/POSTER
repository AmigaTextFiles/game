Hi Fred. Here's a small game I wrote - this is for your collection...

Aniso:

"Small puzzle game for your Workbench screen - useful for when you get bored
 while downloading, compiling, etc. Same idea as the game "Brain" from an
 earlier Fish Disk. Runs on any Amiga equipped with Release 2."

Cheers,

Barry.
