Amtris is a small Tetris clone, written in C with the PD NorthC v1.3
compiler. There can't be a sentient being in the universe who doesn't know
how to play Tetris, but anyway...

The object of the game is to create complete rows of blocks. Shapes fall from
the top of the window one at a time. The shapes fall to the bottom, and while
falling may be rotated (by pressing <Return>) or moved left and right with
the 'a' and 's' keys respectively. A shape can be made to fall quickly by
tapping the spacebar. If the final position of the shape is such that a
complete row is filled, the row disappears, and to progress to the next level
a set number of rows must be filled (This number is shown on the right hand
side with other status information.).

A summary of the above is available in the game by pressing the <Help> key
at any time. Have fun...

Compilation
-----------

The supplied 'Makefile' can be used with the 'Make' utility provided with
NorthC to recreate the executable. This requires the machine-generated file
'amtris.blink' which can be made by issuing the command

	NorthC:Bin/Make $*.blink

in a directory containing 'Makefile'.
