wACKbAN - jACKmANS brüder (who's actually PacMans brother,  but  that's
another story (play JackMan to know more'bout it!)).

   Anyway... This game was released during the HUGE small little compu-
terparty  somewhere  far  from  the  rest of our world. The name of the 
party was (or actually "is" - as I'm in the  midle  of  it  right  now) 
FRUKTFEST.
   It is probably one of  the  smallest  pacman-clones  ever.  Now  I'm
talkin'in  graphical  matters,  even  though the archive's pretty small
too. It's designed for a 640x256 WB with 4 colours (but there's no  one
running on 2 colours, is there?..).

   Programming and graphics(?) by Mopz, using Blitz Basic and PPaint.
   Music by Maze, using - some version of - Pro Tracker.
   Copyright© 1997 NC.Gamez.  This game is freeware; play it, enjoy it,
but don't change the archive.

   There are some things for ya'to select in the menus during the title
sequences, such as music and gamespeed.
   The game is simple. Move that little jerky dude - yes,  he  is  VERY
small  around  with  your stick (joy ;). Collect the pacs, grab the big
pacs for some moments of immortality.  And  m o s t   important,  don't 
touch  the  ghosts  (they  are silly, and one should ALWAYS avoid silly
things (even ghosts)).

   Only  three  levels are included, but I guess you can figure out how
to make some new on your own. They are simple IFF-brushes which you may
edit in any paintpackage. Wack always starts centred in  X  and  Y.  No
more than 3 enemies may be placed on a level.

   I  have  to  put some greets here too, I guess... So, herewego, man!
Hello Maze (and thanx for doing the muzac), Gosweede, Agnus (I can  see
his rendered halloj-bottle from here; nice one (DL it from my board!)),
Audrey,  Lotuz,  YouZZir,  and  to  all those PC-dudes playing Doom and
Quake on their silly(!) machines.
   Ta ta!.. I guess I'm off now :)
