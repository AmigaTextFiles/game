INTRODUCTION

 There is a MS Windows Game "Fast Sort" included in the game package
 "Brain Box". It¥s really nice. But since i hate Windows, I wrote a
 similar game for Amiga computers.

REQUIREMENTS

 SortTile needs WB/KS 2.0+ and math libs. Also you MUST have at least a
 8-colour WB screen.

INSTALLATION

 None. Copy it to whereever you want it to stay.

USAGE

 There are six boxes in the game window. The recessed one shows up a
 tile with a specific colour. Your task is to find a free place for
 it in one of the five bevelled boxes above. If you manage this,
 you get one point.
 Of course there is a time limit. If the clock reaches 12, a new tile
 will be shown.
 But if you miss, one bonus point is lost. Bonus points are shown
 at the right by blue boxes.
 You can increase count of bonus by collecting tiles of the same colour
 in one frame.

 Game start and operation is done by pressing LMB. If you press RMB,
 a short doc will be shown.

 If the window get inactivated, the game is paused.

TOOLTYPES

 HELPFILE           The name of the Helpfile. Default: PROGDIR:SortTiles.shortdoc
 COL1-              The pens of you WB screen to use for tile colours. Defaults to

BUGS

 There is a problem with resizing of the window. Sometimes SortTiles messes up
 redraw. Simply resize again.
