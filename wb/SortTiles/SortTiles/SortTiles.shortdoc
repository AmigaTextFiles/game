SortTiles V1.00

Find a free place for the tile shown in the lower left corner.
Place it  in one of the five frames above.
Every placed tile gives you one point.
If you miss it, one blue point will be killed. If there are
none left, game over.
You can get bonus points by collecting tiles of the same colour
in one frame.
