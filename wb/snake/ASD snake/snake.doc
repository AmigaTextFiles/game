SHORT: Snakes is a FAST and FURIOUS one-player game in which the object is
to grow as large as possible. The way to do this is eating things in the playing
area. Unfortunately, the snake can be a little overzealous, and may even eat
itself...
    Various options are added for your added entertainment and pleasure.
The controls option is explained below in CONTROLS. Two other options
control the difficulty level of the game, and also how fast you score
(these being quite dependant upon each other). The FAST mode selector
indicates the speed at which the snakes travels (perhaps TURBO mode would
have been more appropriate ;-). The box in selector indicates if the walls
around the playing area are solid or wrap-around .. ie whether you DIE
HORRIBLY if you try to EAT THE WALL.

CONTROLS:
    The gadgets on the screen may be accessed via the underlined shortcuts,
but for those who are BLIND, here's the shortcuts ;-)
   *s - start       .. the ONLY option worth CONSIDERING. In fact, it's SO
                       IMPORTANT that i included it in the MENU as well!
   *p - pause       .. only for WIMPS
   *c - continue    .. after pause
    a - all cursors .. see play controls below
    v - Velocity    .. sets the velocity at which the snake travels. Pretty
                       self-explanatory.
    b - boxed in    .. FOR MEGA-DETH GAMES that the whole FAMILY can enjoy.
    q - quit        .. there was a great debate whether to bother putting this
                       QUIT OUT option in, since NOBODY would want to QUIT this
                       AMAZING GAME!
*NOTE*
    <Enter> acts as a special key. One of the three main buttons (those marked
with an asterix above) in the play window may be highlighted (by a reversed bevel
box). This button will be acitvated upon pressing the <enter> key. The
highlighting moves around as the game enters various modes (startup, pause,
continue). Thus, to start a game while no game is running, press <enter>. To
pause a running game, press <enter>, and to continue after a pause, press <enter>.
So simple!

    Play controls...
    z, <, left cursor  : anti-clockwise
    x, >, right cursor : clockwise

    Alternative play controls ... select 'All Cursors'
    - use all the cursor keys to select up, down, left, right directions of
    travel. No LAME key-checking is made to stop INSTANT DETH if you double
    back on yourself.
    - z, x, <, > still active as clockwise/anti-clockwise keys.

LEVELS:
    Admittedly, they're pretty simple at the moment.. being that every now and
then the game will decide you've collected enough blocks to go up a level. At such
a point, the game will increase your speed a tad, and also clear out your trail
from the play area (so you can start filling it up all over again).

CREDITS:
    A credit must go to the game Syzygy I saw (and played) on a HP
calculator. It was the inspiration for this game.
    Also, a credit to Peter Fregon, for being such an utterly TWISTED
B*$&^#D, and for saying one day "I think I'll write a snake game". Sorry
for stealing your idea Pete... NOT!

DISCLAIMER:
    I take no responsibility for what this code may, or may not do to you,
your computer, your brother/sister/child/parents/cousin, your cat, your
home/business alarm system, your BANK ACCOUNT or the local police. In fact,
I don't know WHY the local police here DON'T JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!

OTHER DRIBBLE:
    Here's how you may contact me, my brother, my dog, my cat, my local
police station and this is where you should send your generous donations of
10 Australian dollars (currently fluctuating between $5 and $8 American),
your virgin sisters (of legal age please) and anything else you might think
worthy of this game...
	Any Game ideas (including upgrades to this game AND new games) are
greatly appreciated.
