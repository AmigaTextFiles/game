2. Another Tetris? What's the use?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I got the idea to write an own Tetris clone when I found myself disappointed
of SizeTris. The idea behind SizeTris, to write a size flexible multitasking
Tetris, was really good, but I felt disgusted by the presentation.
So I took the challenge and wrote my own one, offering the following features,
to name just a few:

  * Multitasking: play WT while making backups, packing data or whatever else

  * Full Kickstart 2.0+ support (including 3D-Look)

  * Flexible field and tile size

  * Preferences Window

  * Configuration, sizes and window positions may be saved to disk

  * Saveable scorelist

  * Complete game status displayed in a separate window

  * Auto-pause when window becomes inactive; useful while making backups etc.

  * Changeable tile colour and pattern

  * Special graphics adaption for non-interlace mode

  * Three different level modes

In fact, I don't know any better Workbench Tetris clone. If you do, why not
send me a copy of it or tell me what to improve - I'll try to do my best to
make WinTris be your choice.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All you need is an Amiga (oh, really?) with Kickstart 2.0 or higher.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Installing WinTris
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just pull the whole WinTris Drawer to wherever you want. Then you must install
"libs20/reqtools.library" to your libs: directory (if you really haven't yet).
That's all.
Note: If you are using ToolManager or any similar tool, remember to set the
      current directory to your WinTris directory, e.g. "dh0:games/WinTris".
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Configuring WinTris
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Sizing the window:
  You may change the window size by using the size gadget in the right bottom
  corner in order to change the tile size. The tile size means the size of a
  single square element in pixels. Minimum is 6, maximum is 64.
  After releasing the size gadget the program reduces the window size to the
  next lower tile size. Only even values are supported, since in nolace mode
  the vertical needs to be divided by two.
  Warning: In the current version, resizing the window will reset the game!

- <PREFS>

* Prefs/StartLevel:
  Well, uh, actually this determines the level to start at.
  Normally, the level is raised every 20 lines you complete. If, for instance,
  you raise the start level to 5, you will have to complete 6*20=120 lines to
  reach level 6. 

* Prefs/HelpLines:
  I couldn't find an advantage in this, but some people liked it.
  Just check it out!

* Prefs/X-Size, Y-Size:
  This is the size of the whole field. Minimum is 4*4, maximum is 64*64.
  Note: The original Tetris size is 10*20 (I guess so), this is the default.
        On Game Boy, however, it is 10*17. Change it if you dare!

* Prefs/Interlace Graphics:
  WinTris was originally designed for interlace usage. If you deactivate it,
  the vertical brick size will be divided by 2, so that the bricks will 
  appear square in normal HiRes mode.
  (Sorry, no adaption for "Next" display yet!)

* Prefs/TaskPri:
  Here you may vary the task priority of WinTris. Since it is a multitasking
  program, this is quite useful. A high TaskPri will make WinTris run
  smoothly in almost every situation. A low TaskPri will give more CPU time
  to other tasks, for instance backup programs or packers.
  A value of 0 is reasonable in most cases.

* Prefs/Level Mode (LM):
  Currently, there are three level modes available.

    Normal - 7 levels to play, no changes afterwards.
    Hard   - (theoretically) 99999 levels to play, after 7th the speed won't 
             rise but you will be tormented by an increasing number of random
             lines falling down like normal tiles.
    Cruel  - like 'Hard', but this time the density of each random line will
             be higher.
             Additionally, each level you gain (below 8th) one single random
             line with level-dependently increasing density will appear.
             
  Note about 'random lines': These lines wear the colour of 'dropped tiles',
  that makes plain that they can't be influenced by any means. Although they
  often consist of several, apparently independent elements, they are ONE
  line. Thus ALL parts will stop falling as soon as at least one element
  touches ground.

* Prefs/Tiles (T):
  In WinTris v1.00, the tiles were built up by using basic square elements.
  In v1.10, I changed this to gain the original Tetris look. Now you may
  choose between both display modes.

* Prefs/Tile Pattern:
  If you change the pattern, remember to choose different A and B colours.
  Otherwise, you won't see any pattern at all.
  Note: If you are using a tile size which is not a multiple of 4, especially
        in non-interlace mode, some more complex patterns may appear
        truncated when used. This is because the graphic elements are not
        filled in realtime. It's not a bug.

* Prefs/Tile Colour:
  Both A and B colours, which are needed to paint a two-coloured pattern.

* Prefs/Tile Size:
  This is for information purposes only. On the left, you can see the current
  tile size, on the right appears a precalculation of the tile size after
  clicking on USE.

- <MENU>

* Menu/Load Config:
  will load and use a previously saved prefs file.

* Menu/Save Config:
  will save the current configuration to (hard)disk. It will automatically be
  loaded on next startup.

* Menu/Default Config:
  restores the original configuration.

* Menu/Reset Scorelist:
  will reset the high score list to its original state (and ask you before).

* Menu/Clear Scorelist:
  will remove ALL names and scores from the high score table.
  Do you really want to start playing with an initial highscore of 0 ...?
  What's the challenge?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Playing WinTris
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Press any key (except Amiga-key combinations) to start from "Get Ready" mode.
WinTris is (at the moment) entirely keyboard-controlled:

A) Cursor Keys (simple)                B) Number Pad (recommended)

             --------                      -------- -------- --------
            | rotate |                    |4 rotate|5 rotate|6 rotate|
            |  left  |                    |   left |   left |  right |
    -------- -------- --------             -------- -------- --------
   |   <-   |  drop  |   ->   |           |1 move  |2 move  |3 move  |
   |  left  |  tile  |  right |           |   left |   down |  right |
    -------- -------- --------             -------- -------- --------
                                          |0                |
                                          |  drop tile      |
                                           -----------------

* To pause the game, simply deactivate the WinTris game window.
  Some multitasking programs automatically activate their own window when
  they have finished working; for example some backup programs do so when
  they want to have more disks to eat. In such cases WinTris will immediately
  freeze and wait until you reactivate its game window. After that, it will
  switch into "Get Ready" mode.
  Cunning, eh?

* The level will be raised every 20 lines you complete.
  There are 8 levels (0-7). The higher the level, the higher is the score you
  get for every achievement.

* No Tetris docs here, I guess everyone knows what it's about. If you don't,
  just check out the game, you'll soon get into it.
  It's SO easy and SO fascinating!

9. Program History
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       b: minor bug fixed        c: minor change        f: minor new feature
       B: major bug fixed        C: major change        F: major new feature
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.0ß: - Initial release (first test phase). Hope there are no more bugs left.

v1.00: b Score measure and level 8 speed were optimized.

       b Graphics were placed wrong on BackDrop WB. Works fine now.

       b Fixed a neglectable timing problem concerning status refresh.

       c Status window now opens after game window. This is useful if you want
         it to overlap the game window's titlebar after restarting WT.

       c Optimized graphics routine; should be a bit faster now.

       f Added "Clear Scores" option, menu was redesigned.

       f Now also the game borders are affected by the Interlace gadget.
         Looks much better in non-interlaced mode than before.

       c Redesigned status window, removed leading zeroes.

       f Added score scrambler to keep lamers from "zapping" the file.

       c Removed slowest level; it was really tooo slow.
         Changed number of lines/level from 25 to 20.
         Again new score measure. (Thanx to Obiwan for these hints!)

       b Menu entry "Quit" didn't work. What a silly bug!

v1.10: F Start level may be selected.

       F Enhanced graphics system.
       
       C Tile size may now be changed via size gadget, field dimensions can
         be set in preferences.
       
       f Up to 32 colours supported - should be enough, even for AGA.
       
       c ReqTools 2.0 used.
       
       f WT will now wait after returning from pause mode until a key is
         pressed.
         
       c Tile size maximum changed from 32 to 64 pixels.
       
       c Field size maximum changed from 35*25 to 64*64.
       
       c Using new prefs will not always reset game; if so, a warning will
         be displayed.
         
       f Mouse blanking after "Get Ready".
       
       c Now any key is accepted to start from "Get Ready" mode
         (except Amiga-Key combinations).
         
       f Game Over requester.
       
       f File ID header on both config and hiscore files.

       C All in all, many routines have been completely rewritten.

v1.11: f Now you may again choose single-brick graphics (known from v1.00).

       f Tile Size Prediction in preferences window.

       c WinTris is no longer auto-detaching! If you really need WT running
         detached from your shell, use "run WinTris".
         As a result, the code is almost 2 kbytes shorter.
         
       f If there exists no config file (yet), WinTris decides whether to use
         interlace graphics or not. This avoids a most ugly game window
         popping up in MedRes Screen Mode on first startup.

       c All requesters now use the preferences system font. Since Prefs only
         allows FixedWidth system default fonts, this solves the problem with
         proportional fonts in the HiScore list.
         
       c Once again: new score measure. Now it's twice as hard to beat the
         high score of 5000. But don't tell me it's impossible! 
         While game-testing I achieved 5200!
         (What a pity you can't recycle old score files :-)

v1.12: b VERY minor bug fixed: screen resolution was not considered when game
         was reset. If that's all bugs...

       c Slight changes to the prefs window.

v1.20: B By mistake, I used the v39 routine ScrollWindowRaster(). Of course,
         this caused the program to crash on kickstart v36-37. Now I am again
         using ScrollRaster(), like in v1.00. Big sorry for this!

       F Now WT offers three different level modes!

       c some old routines were optimized.
       
       c New Config and Score file ID. Sorry- obsolete files would cause WT to
         crash, so this was necessary.

v1.21: c some minor changes

         Since now almost half a year has passed without any bug reports or
         other reactions, I guess that my work on WinTris is now finished.
         So I now call this the "final release".
