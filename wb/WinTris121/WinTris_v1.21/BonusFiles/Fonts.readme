This drawer contains two different fonts: 

  * newstyle.font/8 - my favourite system font (fixed width)
   
  * X-MIX-1.font    - the original X-MIX font (proportional) (updated 12/94)

  * X-MIX-2.font    - much the same as X-MIX-1, but 2 blank lines inserted at
                      the top of each character.
                      This one is ideal for use as screen font.
                   
All fonts were drawn by Gothmog / Spicelab.
