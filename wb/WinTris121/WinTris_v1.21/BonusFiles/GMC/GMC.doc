------ Documentation for GMC v1.06 - Gothmog's MemClock
       by Gothmog / Spicelab

       Since this program is really easy to understand, this doc consists
       mainly of the program history.

------ What's so special about GMC?

In fact, I don't know. It's just another MemClock to decorate your Workbench.
I just wanted to gain some experience points in using C, so I started with
something easy. Since version 1.02 turned out to be really useful I decided to
continue the support for a while. Enjoy!

Note:  Due to the powerful combination of Delay and TaskPri I guess that this
       utility - considered it is configured well - uses only a neglectable
       amount of CPU time. Figure out yourselves!

Another note: If you specify a high Delay value, all events (like closing the
              window and opening the prefs window) will take a while to
              be processed. This is NOT a bug, it results from the fact that
              Intuition doesn't spend too much time watching GMC.
              (I know this is not too professional, but it works :-)

------ Installing GMC

Just pull the GMC icon into your WBStartup drawer. You won't need to add
"DONOTWAIT" since GMC is self-detaching.
Note to 1.3 users: 1.3 is history! You won't regret an upgrade! (because you
may then use GMC ;-)

------ Features which are not necessarily clear at first look:

* Config
GMC tries to save the config file to envarc: or, if envarc: isn't present,
to s:. On startup both paths are searched for the file.

* Delay (preferences window)
The time to wait between two display updates. if Delay is 0, the display will
be updated continuously and thus steal you lots of CPU time! So set this value
carefully. 5-50 is most reasonable.
Intuition will check both menu and close gadget only at display update time,
so don't worry about eventual delays before GMC obeyes your orders.

* AddWith (preferences window)
This is interesting if you are using a proportional screen font. This value
will always be added to the calculated window width.

* CmpV (preferences window)
This one also should only be used in connection with a prop font.
See program history for detailed explanation.

* Separate (preferences window)
This is the character used to separate the display items.

------ Copying GMC

GMC is FreeWare, that means you may do with it whatever you want, except
modify it. If you copy it around, please leave its drawer (icons, docfile)
together. Thank you.

------ Known Bugs

- Sometimes, the size calculation seems to fail. I couldn't find the reason
  for this phenomenon, because it appears REALLY seldom.

- Don't give a damn about what CPU monitors tell you about the time usage of
  GMC. Just tear down the TaskPri value and GMC will release almost all of its
  CPU time as soon as there is another task with a higher TaskPri.

- The timer routine I used continuously writes temporary data into the RAM
  disk. I've tried hard to find a better one, but the Amiga documentation
  seems to be kind of incomplete or, at least, difficult to survey.

------ Program History:

v1.00: First version, never released.

v1.01: Added keyboard support in GUI.

v1.02: Fixed some minor bugs;
       added taskpri slider to gain lots of CPU time;
       first version I spread around.

v1.04: Improved proportional font handling: width of window will no longer be
       different on every startup. This is achieved by saving the width with
       the preferences and then comparing it to the recalculated width on
       every startup. Only if the difference exceeds a certain tolerance level
       the recalculated value will be used.

v1.05: Updated the preferences part to support that certain tolerance level
       named above. It is called "CmpV" (Comparison Value). If you're using a
       proportional font with a very varying character width (like "emerald")
       you will need to raise CmpV and probably also AddWidth in order to
       gain a window with proper size and a fixed placement.
       (I hope the function of CmpV is now clear - it's difficult to explain.)

v1.06: Slight modifications: NewLook menu, minor improvements made in time
       routine. Now GMC is self-detaching and therefore a bit longer - sorry.
