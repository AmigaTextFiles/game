@node "Systemvoraussetzungen" "system requirements"
This game needs the following things:

  - an Amiga
  - AmigaOS 3.0 or better
  - gtlayout.library V32 oder higher by Olaf Barthel
    (is in this archive)
  - some people, who like to play Monopoly
    (computer players are not yet really implemented)

optional
  - openurl.library (can be found on Aminet)
  - bsdsocket.library compatible TCP/IP stack (AmiTCP, Miami, Genesis, WinUAE...)

@endnode

@node "Installation" "installation"
To start the game you don't need any special installation.

It will find the gtlayout.library without installation, but it makes sense to copy the library to LIBS:.

WARNING: Before copying you should test, if there
         is no newer version than V47.1 of the gtlayout.library
         in your LIBS:-directory !!

in this archive there is the 68020-060 version of the library.

Testing:
@{"version libs:gtlayout.library FULL" system "version >CON://250/50//WAIT/CLOSE libs:gtlayout.library FULL FILE"}

installing gtlayout.library 47.1:
@{"copy gtlayout.library LIBS:" system "copy gtlayout.library LIBS:"}
@endnode

@node "Spielregeln" "rules of the game"
First you should select the menu item @{"Project/New..." link MenNeu 0}, to set up the players for the new game.

After that, the information about the players will show in the middle of the game board. The framed token markes the player, the random generator has chosen, to begin.

Every time, when a player is to throw the dice - and in some situations, when the player has to make a decision -, he can do transactions. He can do this by using the @{"transactions" link Geschäfte} menu.

At this time the player can also query information about properties and ownerships. see menu @{"information" link Information 0}.

When the player has finished this, he should throw the dice. This can be triggered with the mouse by clicking on a dice or by pressing the space key.

Now there are the following possibilities, depending on the field the player landed on:

 · The player landed on a property (street, station or utility)
    - property owned by the bank:
        The property may be bought
        The price is the normal @{"value" link MenStrInfo} of the property.

    - property is owned by another player:
        The rent for this property must be paid to its owner.
        How to calculate the rent see @{"information/Property Info..." link MenStrInfo}.

    - property is owned by the player himself or
 · field  'free parking' (the field in the upper left corner with the car)
     nothing happens.

 · 'community chest' or
 · 'chance' (the fields with the big questions marks)
     a random @{"card" link "Karte" 0} appeares in a window
     and the player has follow the instructions.

 · one of the two tax fields:
     The corresponding tax has to be paid:
     income tax:    200.-
     super tax:     100.-

 · jail visit (the field in the bottom left corner)
     When you land on this field you are just visiting your fellows in jail
     and you can move ahead as usual in the next turn.

 · policeman (field in the upper right corner)
     From there you must go directly to @{"jail" link "Gefängnis" 0}.
     Your turn ends even if you threw doubles.


 · On 'GO' you get 200.- salary.
   You also get this money when you pass over 'GO'.

After all actions concerning the field you landed on are done, it's normally the next player's turn. After throwing doubles (both dice show the same number) the player retains the dice and can throw it again. But if the player is so "lucky" to throw three successive doubles, he must go directly to @{"jail" link "Gefängnis" 0} and his turn ends.

During a turn you have unlimited credit. But if you have debts at the end of your turn a warning will show up. When you now press the button 'Give Up' all your assets will be banned from the game board and you have lost the game.

 IMPORTANT:
At this point the player can of course organize some money with the @{"Transactions" link Geschäfte 0} menu, e.g. by selling a property.

When in the end there is only one player left, he is the final winner of the game.

Information/Property Info...

Here you can query information about every single property.

After selecting a property with the mouse, a window opens, that should look like a 'Title Deed'-card of the "real" Monopoly game.

The Information are as follows:

 value:          The price you must pay to buy this property from the bank
 rent:           The rent that must be paid the owner when the property is
                 unimproved
 double rent:    This rent is valid when one player owns all properies of
                 one color and none of these properties is mortgaged.
 rent with       \
   1..4 houses:   > higher rent for improved properties
 rent with hotel:/
 costs of houses:Price for one house
                 (When  @{"selling houses" link "MenHausVerkaufen" 0} the
                 owner gets only half the proce back)
 owner:         'bank' or the name of a player
                 If the property is owned by a player, his token is also
                 displayed here.
 mortgage value: The money you get, when you select @{"Transactions/Mortgage Property" link "MenHypoAufnehmen" 0}.
                 (Half the property value)
                 When the property is already mortgaged, this is displayed here.
                 see also @{"Transactions/Lift Mortgage" link "MenHypoZurückzahlen" 0}

The rent that is valid will be marked with a red frame. If the property is owned by the bank or is mortgaged then you don't need to pay rent and so there is no red frame.

@node "MenVerkaufen" "Transactions/Sell"
Transactions/Sell

A player can use this menu item to sell one of his properties to another player, when he needs money.

The player must give three pieces of information:

  - @{b}Wich property@{ub} does he want to sell?
     The property must be selected with the mouse.

  - @{b}Which Player@{ub} does he want to sell the property?
     The status display of the potential buyer in the middle of
     the game board must be selected using the mouse.

  - @{b}How much money@{ub} does he demand?
     The default is the value of the property,
     if mortgaged, half the value.
     An input of '0' cancels the transaction.

Cpu players almost never agree to an offer.

IMPORTANT:
According to the official game rules, improved properties cannot be sold. If you sell them anyway, the houses are sold automatically (also on other properties of the same color group) and the (previous) owner receives half the price he paid for the houses.

IMPORTANT:
If the property is mortgaged, the buyer must pay 10% of the mortgage value to the bank at once (5% of property value). But the buyer gets the chance to lift the mortgage during the transaction. Then he doesn't have to pay these extra 10% rate of interest. He must only pay the "normal" 10% rate of interest. see @{"Transactions/Lift Mortgage" link "MenHypoZurückzahlen" 0}.

@node "MenHausBauen" "Transactions/Build House/Hotel"
Transactions/Build House/Hotel

To build houses the player must now click the property/ies he wants to build on.

Houses can only be built under the following circumstances:

  - It must be a normal street
    (you can tell it from the colored bar)

  - The player must own all streets of this color group.

  - No street of this color group may be @{"mortgaged" link "MenHypoAufnehmen" 0}.

  - The houses on the streets of one color group must be distributed evenly.
    That means the difference in the number of houses may not be
    more the one.

A hotel is practically the same as five houses on one street. (But it look a bit different.)

The costs for one house you can get from @{"Information/Property Info" link "MenStrInfo" 0} or with this simple rule:

  - On all streets on the bottom of the board houses cost
    50.-

  - on the left hand side they cost
    100.-

  - on the top row
    150.-

  - and on the right
    200.-

To sell houses the player must now click the (improved) property/ies.

You must keep in mind, that sites on street of one color group must be maintained evenly. That means the difference in the number of houses may not be more the one.

The player only gets back half the price he paid for the houses.

When @{"selling property" link "MenVerkaufen" 0} the houses are sold back to the bank automatically, this menu item need not be called in this case.
@endnode

@node "MenHypoAufnehmen" "Transactions/Mortgage Property"
Transactions/Mortgage Property

After Selecting this menu item the player has to choose the property to be martgaged.

This is only possible for properties with these attributes:

  - The property must be owned by the player

  - The property must not already be mortgaged

And for normal streets also:

  - No street of this color group may be improved.

The player then receives half the property value as printed on the game board. (Those who can't read upside down numbers should use @{"Information/Property Info..." link MenStrInfo 0}!)

As long as the property is mortgaged, the player doesn't receive any rents for it, when another player lands on it.

see @{"Transactions/Lift Mortgage" link MenHypoZurückzahlen 0}
@endnode

@node "MenHypoZurückzahlen" "Transactions/Lift Mortgage"
Transactions/Lift Mortgage

When the player has again enough moey to lift the mortgage, he should do so to get the full rents from the other players.

You need not only pay back the mortgage value but also 10% rate of interest.

Example:
The Old Kent Road has a value of 60.-
So you get 30.- for the mortgage.
Then you must pay back 30.- * 1.1 = 33.-.

  - By drawing a @{"'Go to Jail'-card" link Karte 0}

  - By throwing three successive doubles.

You get out of jail:

  - by using a 'Get out of Jail free'-card.
    (You can even buy one when you are already in jail

@node Network "Network"
Since version 2 HBMonopoly can be played over a network. Therefore you have to install an AmiTCP compatible TCP/IP stack on every computer (tested with Miami).


In the @{"settings window" link MenEinstellungen} the network mode must be activated and one Amiga must be declared as the server, the others are clients.

In addition the clients need the information on which computer the server runs. You have to enter the name in the form computer.doomain.co.uk or as dotted decimal (e.g. 156.34.216.93). The port number must be the same on all computers.


New game:

Now a new game can be started on the HBMonopoly server be selecting the menu item @{"Project/New..." link MenNeu}. In the window that now appears only the players that are local to the server machine may be entered.

While now a waiting window can be seen on the server, on the client machines additional players can log in. But once the game has been started on the server no new log ins are possible.

The game now works as usual, but now it's also possible to talk to the other players with the @{"chat window" link MenChatWin}.

Now it's only possible to change game settings (e.g. jackpot, double salary) or save the game on the server side.


Load an old game:

After the saved game file has been loaded on the server side, also the client camn choose the menu item @{"Project/Open..." link MenÖffnen}. Now a window appears where players can be taken to your own computer by clicking on "local". When all players are distributed the game begins as usual.
