     NAME
          Get´em - New Idea of Game.

     SYPNOSIS
          [RUN] GETEM [?][F Filename]

          Or double-click on Icon or LevelFile.

     DESCRIPTION

          Find the matching pieces. Pieces falling downto floor,
          when moved over free space. This is a complete new idea
          of a Game. Nothing common with Tetris or Shanghai.
          There is even an existing Version before Gem'x was ever released,
          With a bit Sound, controlled by Mouse and Keyboard.
          Nice Graphics, completely written in Pascal. (Kick-Pascal 1.0 and 2.03)

     INSTALLATION

          Copy the file GETEM1.0 , GETEM.DOC (GETEM.UPDATES ,GETEM.DOC.GER)
          GETEMLEVELS and the file GETEMSOUND anywhere you want, 
          e.g. Harddisk, Disk or RAM.
          You mustn't put these files together in one Directory, 
          but it would be better.
          The easiest will be to copy the whole Directory.
          
     START
   
      HOW TO START

            Start Getem in the Directory you put it in with the
            Level-File as shown above.  

            (Getem likes to use the CLI ! Please have in mind to have at 
             least a Stack of 5000 Bytes !
            Use:  
                 RUN GETEM1.0 
            as you have a multitasked System !
        
            While using Workbench, double-click GETEM-Icon. 
            (Nice Icon, isn´t it ?)

            If you start Getem from other Directories, where the Level-File   
            is not present (or to start with other, self-made Levels), then 
            you have to add the Parameter F with the name of the Level-File:   
          
            RUN GETEM F PATH_TO_LEVEL_FILE:LEVEL_FILE 

            (e.g. Level-File is in RAM:  RUN GETEM F RAM:LEVEL )

            From Workbench:

            Double-Click GETEM and Shift+LevelFile

            If you add the Parameter " ? " , Getem prints a short help on your 
            Screen, but won´t get start. ( Only CLI )


            If there was any Problem, Getem will open a new Window to 
            run ...
            
 
          Then you will see a chess-alike-field, where there are many little
          boxes in the Window (In the colors of your Workbench-Screen).
          On the top side, you see some Gadgets and the Logo.
          Also there is a Gadget in the top of the Window, in the
          Drag-Bar, named ICON.
          
          Getem will then open a small Window with the Text 
          'Loading: LEVEL_FILE_NAME' 
        
          This will take a while. (Depends on the length of the File,
           the used Computer and the busyness of it...)

          If Getem can´t find the Level-File, there will be the Message:
          'Can´t find the File: LEVEL_FILE_NAME'

          If so, Getem will compute Random-Levels. These Random-Levels 
          can be UNSOLVABLE ! This was build in to play the game
          without any loaded levels and to test the game.

          IF for instance the Levelfile was of wrong Data-Strukture,
          Getem breaks with a warning. ( Thought was usefull to do so)

          Now GETEM loads the SoundFile. This File is a standard
          8SVX-File and can easily replaced. There will be an
          Error-Message if the File couldn't be find. Then GETEM will use the
          Flash instead of the Digital-Sound. When yuo have installed
          'InstallBeep' don´t bother of the new Sounds.


          If all was going wrong or if the Level-File could be loaded,
          then,

     STARTED

          your´re in Demo-Mode. Getem waits for clicking any
          Gadget or Key, while waiting, Getem shows the loaded Levels
          and makes some Graphics FX.

     GADGETS
      
      CLOSE
          
          Must I explain this one ? Ends my Game...


      START
     
          If you click the START Gadget, it starts the
          Game. Only Gadget which is ON when you start.
        
      ReGo

          The ReGo is for playing the same level once more, if you like.
          (And sometimes it is the only way to make the Level...)
          This Function was added to be more succesful, if you made
          an Error. But, beware of the Time ! (Not yet in this Version)
          This Gadget is ON, when the Game was started.

      STOP
    
          The STOP is for stopping the Game. If you can´t see these
          f*@#¡ng boxes anymore, this is the best Gadget.
          Only ON, when Game was started.

      SCORE

          Opens or Close a Window showing the Score of the last 10
          Levels. The higher the Score, the better you are. The less the Time,
          the higher the Score: Score= 60 / Time (s) * 1000.
          Can be clicked anytime. Bool-Gadget.

      ICON
         
          If you click the ICON-Gaget, the Window will be iconified.
          The Window is shrinked and moved to the upper left top of the Screen. 
          If the Window is shrinked, you can Resize it with the ICON-
          Gadget once again. The Game is paused, also the Demo, and
          will be continued at the same Level and build of the Plane.
          This function was build in for reasons of Big-Brothers-
          Watching-You-In-Your-Company...

     KEYS

          There are some Keys always needed and some others...

      ESC

          This key is for quitting Getem while in Demo-Mode, not
          during the Game ! (Security) It is also to quit the
          Help-Window.

      i   (The little 'i')
          
          Boss-Key. Iconifys the Window. (s.ab)

      HELP

          Opens a window with a short helptext like this one...



     HOW TO PLAY

          Well, it is easy. Move your Mousepointer to the box you
          want to move. Then press the RIGHT Mousebutton to move
          Box to right, and LEFT Mousebutton to move Box to the
          left. 

          If there is free space under the box, the box falls automagically 
          to the bottom. 
          
          If it find any neighbour, (Left, right or below)
          having same type then himself, these two (three) boxes disappears. 
          It could be possible, that three boxes at the time
          may disappear ! Say the fallig box finds two (three ?) neighbours at
          the time ! This is important !

          On the right side you see a list of each type of box in
          the game. So there you can look, if there are any triples
          of boxes (Odd Number).

          For the best strategy, you must improve yourself.
          Use unmatching pieces to move other pieces to left,
          right at higher places...
          Before starting a level, look at the list, to detect any
          odd-numbers, look for traps or holes.


     TO BE REMEMBERED

          This is a Start Release of the Game. It is strongly
          recommended to report ANY Bug !!!!!!

     KNOWN BUGS

          In special strange cases, it is possible, that you can´t dis-
          appear three boxes at the time. This depends how you do
          it. I am working on. The problem: complete new Routine...

          Sometimes the sound goes mad... Don't know why...

     LEVEL-FILE

          You can make your own Level-File !! As many as you want. The game
          will not end at the last level, it'll begin at the first level
          again. First, there are the Levels, then you can insert a name for
          every Level. The name should not have more than 50 Chars. You can
          insert any sort of name like these ones: Timecruncher, Old Trap, Big
          Hole, Lonley One.

          Here the structure of a Level:

              00000000000000       14 Rows, and 14 Columns.
              00000000000000
              70000000000000       0 is white Background.
              07000303030300       1 is Quader
              00700202020200       2 is Cross
              00070101010100       3 is Pyramid
              02027007020250       4 is Circle
              03030700030300       5 is Sand
              04040000040400       6 is Rowy
              77777777777077       7 is Black box (Wall)
              00000000000050
              00000000000000
              00000000000000
              77777777077777

          Do not insert the numbers 8 and 9 ! (IMPORTANT)


          Then insert a blank line (CR) or the Level-Name, to seperate two Levels.

          Structure of Level-File:

          0123
          1223       (Yeah, of course 14 Rows and Columns ! )
          7771
          LevelName1
          3232
          3421
          7651
          LevelName2
        
          etc.


     THE SOUND-FILE

         The included Sound-file is GETEMSOUND. This is a Sound wich
         makes a noice like a Drip of Water. If this does not seems to be good
         enough to you, you can change this file. Copy any 8SVX-File you want
         to GETEMSOUND and you get the new Sound! But be care! Don´t use a long
         Sound! This may cause long waits during the game. Because of speed,
         the Sound is played with the double speed than usual.
    
     WHAT LEFT TO DO ?

          Some better Levels.      YOU can make your own ones !
          Better Sound.            Is done with 8SVX-Loader.
          Highscores.              Not sure wheater it is necessary.(implemented)
          Timelimitation.          Must be done, next thing I am doing.
          FASTER.                  Surely posible...
          Perhaps better Gfx.      Yo ! And 4096 colors...
          Levelgenerator and Editor... (Up to 8 Meg of Levels avail...,
                                          just kidding !)  

     
      ENJOY !

(Sorry, no nroff manual-page !)

Oh. When I have time enough, then there will be a version for X11-Windos
for Sparcs and DECs.
