                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


                    "Can you mimic the computer's sequence ?"


Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This game was written on an Amiga1200 with 6MB RAM, a 68881 and a
120MB Hard Disk so it should work with anything like that. It also seems to
run OK (and just as fast !) on my 1.3 A500. The icon was drawn using a
MagicWB type palette and so you may need to adjust it to make it clearer
for yourself, or use my colours. The game IS PAL ONLY I'm afraid as I need
the full PAL screen and it would spoil the look to cram everything in to
and NTSC size display.


Outline of the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This game is a variant on the 'Simon Says' type game in that you
have to copy the sequence that the computer makes. The sequence is a series
of blocks that flash in different colours. The aim is to repeat the
sequence and if it is done correctly then the computer will add another
block to the end of the list. The limit for this is 2000 blocks as I have
to use memory arrays of a finite length to hold the different positions in
the sequence. I don't think that the limit will be much of a problem though
as I can only manage about 10 or so myself, on the large screen that is !! 


Controls
~~~~~~~~

        The game controls are beautifully simple to use. The buttons do
just what they say they do. The size and level can only be altered before
starting a game. The highscores are saved automatically to the drawer the
game resides in and are loaded automatically if they exist. A save button
is provided if you want to save them yourself.


Gameplay
~~~~~~~~

        After setting the required grid size (10 = 10x10, 9 = 9x9 etc.) and
the level (the higher level the faster the sequence is played, but the
greater the bonus !) click on the START button to commence. The computer
will pick two squares at the start (you need TWO squares for a sequence)
and it is your job to copy the positions of these blocks by clicking on
them with the mouse. The unused areas of the board are not detected for
mouse clicks as are the areas along the grid lines and the surrounding
areas of the board. The QUIT button still works and you can halt the game
by clicking STOP. The unused areas are also masked off so you can see where
you are playing on smaller boards.
        If you succeed in repeating the sequence then the computer will
repeat the sequence with an extra block on the end. The sequence gets
longer and longer until you make a mistake. (There is an upper limit of
2000 blocks, when the game will end and you will be awarded the bonus due.
This is UNLIKELY so happen even with the best trained minds). A mistake is
greeted with a callous laugh and a repetition of the sequence (a different
sound accompanies this) to show you where you went wrong. If you have bonus
due then it will be added on to your score. If you done well and have a
high score just enter your name. The scores are saved automatically to the
current directory, where the game loads them in if they are available. The
game is now back in the startup state where you can change the size and /
or level as you wish.


Scoring
~~~~~~~

        The scores for each block correct in the sequence is related to the
size of the grid with additional points for completing a sequence. The
bonus is calculated with the number of blocks in the sequence the grid size
and the level number. Playing on the largest grid at the highest level
yields more points but you may not last long. On a smaller slower game
getting a large is more difficult (it takes longer). Level 1 does not give
bonuses. Can you beat 10000 points ?
