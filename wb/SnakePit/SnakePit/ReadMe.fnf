This material was submitted to me via email directly by the author,
Michael Sinz, for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Michael!

In order to fit everything on one disk, I have archived the source code
with the lharc program, included in the :c directory of this disk.
To unarchive, execute a command of the form:

	lharc -x -a -m x SnakePitSrc.lzh
