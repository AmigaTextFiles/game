SnakePit is a simple and yet addictive game in which you must get the
snake (you) off of the screen.  There are, however, some rough spots
and some obstacles that may need to be overcome.

This game was written as an example of how to do a game that is as
system friendly as possible.  During development, there was joystick
control of the snake and I was able to have my little brother play it
in the top-half of a 400-line screen while I was working on code in the
bottom half.  Since this is a quick (1-week) hack that was done back in
1988 and since it was written in pre-ANSI Manx days, the code looks a
bit ugly.  I hope you can understand.

If you come up with some good screens for SnakePit, please send them
to me.

                            User's Guide

Overview:

SnakePit is a simple action game in which your character (the snake)
must be maneuvered out of the various screens.  You must, however,
realize that a snake can not backup nor can it bit itself.  There are a
few objects on the screen that can cause problems during your attempt
to exit the screen.

SnakePit can take data files which can contain new screens for an
endless supply of screens.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Starting the program:

SnakePit can be started from the CLI or the WorkBench.  In either case,
you may start the program with or without a data file.

From the WorkBench:

If the program is started directly from the WorkBench, all of the
screens, keyboard definitions, and high scores will come from within
the executable file.  Any screens that are modified, keyboard mappings
that are changed, or new high scores will be saved back into the
executable for the next time.

If the program is started from a project icon (there is one provided)
it will use the screens, keyboard mapping, and high scores from that
file.  If that file does not exist, it will create it from the built-in
copy of that data.  All changes to the screens, keyboard, or high
scores will be saved in this data file.

From the CLI:

If SnakePit is started without parameters, all of the screens, keyboard
definitions, and high scores will come from within the executable file.
Any screens that are modified, keyboard mappings that are changed, or
new high scores will be saved back into the executable for the next
time.  This will NOT happen if SnakePit program can not find its
executable.

If the program is started with a filename parameter, it will use the
screens, keyboard mapping, and high scores from that file.  If that
file does not exist, it will create it from the built-in copy of that
data.  All changes to the screens, keyboard, or high scores will be
saved in this data file.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Main Screen:

At the main screen, also known as the title screen, there are a few
menu options.

Project Menu: - This menu contains the following options:

	PLAY							(AMIGA-P)
		This starts the game.  At which point a requester
		is brought up to let you select the starting level.

	DEFINE KEYS						(AMIGA-K)
		This brings up the keyboard definition requester.

	EDIT							(AMIGA-E)
		This puts SnakePit into the LEVEL EDIT mode, at which
		point the level select requester will ask which level
		you wish to edit.

	DRUMS ON/OFF
		This lets you turn off the drum sounds.

	SOUND ON/OF
		This lets you turn off ALL sounds.

	QUIT							(AMIGA-Q)
		Exit SnakePit and save any changes to the screens,
		keyboard, or high scores.

	HIGH SCORES
		This is for information only.  When you are on this
		item, the high scores are display to the right.
		If you highlight a score that is displayed at the
		right and release the menu button, the full high scores
		requester will come up for display only.

Speed Menu:

	This menu contains items 1 to 9 with AMIGA-key 1 to 9 to
	select from the keyboard.  This selects the starting speed
	of the Snake.

Edit Menu:

	This menu is disabled except when in edit mode.  It will be
	described in the edit part of this manual.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               Game Play

After selecting the PLAY menu item from the main screen, you will be
asked to select the starting level.  The level is the screen number at
which you wish to start.  There are 50 screens in a SnakePit "game."

You may select the screen by typing the number of the screen (with a
leading zero for screens 1 to 9) and pressing RETURN or ENTER.  You may
use the LEFT or RIGHT arrows to make the number go UP or DOWN. And you
may use the mouse and click on the left and right arrows.

After having selected your starting level, the screen will blank and
the game will start.

Starting a level:

The level will fade onto the screen and your snake will be in the edge
of the screen somewhere.  It will not move until you press one of the
directional keys on the keyboard.  (As defined in the DEFINE KEYS
requester.  The default to the ARROW keys.)

Object of the game:

The object is to get the snake off of the screen.  This may sound
easier than it is.

One many screens, the way out is blocked by what looks like a solid
brick wall.  In these cases, all you have to do is eat all of the
"grow" food pellets and suddenly one or more bricks will vanish. The
"grow" food pellets (the light coloured round objects) have one major
side effect.  Each one makes your snake one segment larger. When you
exit the screen, you get points based on how long your snake is.  The
longer the snake, the more points.  But, with a longer snake you are
more likely going to get yourself into a position where you can not
move or where you bite yourself.  Both of these mean death.

In order to help, some screens will also have darker food pellets that
will make you shrink by one segment.  While this will reduce your final
score, there are times when you must make your snake smaller in order
to finish a part of the level.  One warning, though:  If your snake
still is very small, you could shrink out of existence.  For each
"shrink" pellet you eat, you must have eaten one "grow" pellet.

Also on some screens are some lighter coloured bricks.  These "pink"
bricks are not fixed in place and can be moved by the snake.  However,
the snake is not strong enough to move one of those bricks if there is
anything on the other side, including another movable brick.

Another obstacles is the POP-UP brick.  These bricks are level with the
ground and are not visible until the snake goes over them.  After the
snake has traveled over the brick, it pops up and is like any other
brick.  This can may for one-time paths and are used in many of the
more complex screens.  POP-UP bricks are also the entrance to the level.

After each level, you receive another life and the next level is
presented.  If you finish level 50, you are restarted at level 1. As
long as you are playing, however, the speed of the snake slowly gets
faster and the second time around (if you can make it the first
time...) will be more difficult.

If at any moment, the snake is stopped and you do not select a new
direction for the snake to go, the snake will pick, at random, a new
direction.

Pausing the game:

During game play, pressing ESC or the MENU button will pause the game
and display a requester.  Pressing RETURN or ENTER will restart the
game.  ABORT will kill the current life and QUIT will quit the current
GAME.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                             High Scores

If your score well enough to have your name on the high score board,
the score board will be displayed with a cursor in the line where you
are to enter your name.  You may type in your name or use the character
gadgets to enter your name.  When done entering your name, just press
RETURN or ENTER or click on the DONE gadget.

When you want the requester to go away press the ESC key.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                          Defining the keys

After having selected the DEFINE KEYS option from the PROJECT menu, a
requester will come up to let you define the keys.

The requester will have the four arrows on it and a box by the arrows
telling what key that is.

Since this requester lets you define the keys, you will need to use the
mouse to select which one you wish to define.  Just click on the
direction you wish to define.  The box will the display ??.  Now, press
the key you wish to define as that direction.  The box will now show
the code for that key.  (If it can find one.)

When you are happy with the selection, click on the continue gadget.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                              Edit Level

After selecting EDIT from the PROJECT menu, you will be asked to select
the level.  This is the same requester as in the game play part of the
program.

Editing a level:

The level selected will be drawn onto the screen and your mouse pointer
will become a BOX.  At this point the EDIT menu will become active.

The EDIT menu contains the LEVEL (save,load,clear) commands, the EDIT
tools, and the END EDIT command.

The LEVEL menu item has three sub-items:  Load, Save, and Clear.
The LOAD item will load a level into the editor.  The levels are
all stored in memory and thus this will be fast.  The SAVE item
will save the current edit level into the level selected.  The
CLEAR item will clear the edit level to a "default" empty level.

The edit tools are the different drawing items.  They are:

	BRICK		- This is the standard brick.
	PINCK BRICK	- This is the pushable brick.
	DROP BRICK	- This is the DROP brick that will vanish after
			  the last "grow" pellet is eaten.
	POP-UP BRICK	- This is the brick that will appear after the
			  snake has travelled over it.
	GROW PELLET	- This is the GROW food pellet.  There should
			  be atleast one on the screen.
	SHRINK PELLET	- This is the SHRINK food pellet.
	ERASE		- To draw blank areas.

You draw the item much like in a paint program.  You can erase an item
by just drawing it again or using the ERASE tool.

Levels are saved and loaded from the in-memory storage.  If you make
any changes to the levels, they are stored on disk when the program
exits.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Level Design Rules and Hints

#1  When designing a level you *MUST* have one POP-UP brick along the
edge of the level.  This is the place where the snake will start the
level at.  It is important that it be in place.

#2  If you have a level in which the exit is a DROP brick, you *MUST*
have atleast one GROW pellet.  The DROP bricks drop when the last GROW
pellet is eaten by the snake.

#3  It is rather easy to make a level impossible.  Make sure that you
play-test the levels as much as possible.  If you can not finish it,
maybe it needs to be changed.

#4  Try to make the levels interesting, with little puzzles that need
to be solved.  Things like PUSH bricks are very useful in these cases.
Also, areas that the snake can go into and solve only if it is small
enough.  Take a look at some of the levels that come with SnakePit.

#5  Remember that if you change a level that it is saved only when
you quit the program.

#6  Remember that if you run SnakePit from the PROJECT icon or via
the CLI without a data file, all changes will happen in the executable.
You could end up losing the screens that come with the program.

#7  Share your new levels with your friends.  Just give them your data
file and they will be able to use the new levels.

#8  If you come up with some levels that you think are good, please
send the data files to me.  I hope to be able to put together a set
of data files for those who get hooked.
