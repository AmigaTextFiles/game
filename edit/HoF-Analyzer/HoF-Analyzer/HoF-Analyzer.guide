@node "intro" "Introduction"

@{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

This program allows you to dissect Alan Strang's HoF (Hall of Fame) files.
It is widely inspired by Michal Janak's @{b}HoFPoints@{ub}. I appreciate much his
program but it doesn't allow a global vision of the standings and the
records encoding is rather boring. That's why I decided to start
programming, with Blitz Basic 2.1 (which is fantastic).

You will be able to view the classifications of each circuit, edit and save
your times. You will also set a position or another driver to reach and
@{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} will show you the needed performance.
You can also see the track were you are the worst, in various ways.

Other features are in development but I'm waiting to see if the program is
appreciated. Suggestions and bugs reports are of course welcome !

@endnode

@node "distri" "Distribution"

@{b}@{u}Distribution@{ub}@{uu}

@{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} is @{b}Moduleware@{ub}. If you like it, I invite you to send me a music
module (mod. ...) of your own, to my @{"E-Mail" link auteur 0} address.

You can copy @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} as many times as you want, as long as it is kept
with the following files:

    @{i}HoF-Analyzer.info@{ui}            Standard 4 colours icon
    @{i}HoF-Analyzer_MWB.info@{ui}        Magic-WB 8 colours icon
    @{i}HoF-Analyzer.guide@{ui}           English documentation
    @{i}HoF-Analyzer_French.guide@{ui}    French documentation

Of course, I cannot be held liable if this program causes any problems with
your system, even if nothing serious should happen. Have a look at the @{"bugs" link "help" 0}
page.

For the rest, I don't advise you to cut this program into 36 pieces, or to
sell it at 30000 pounds. It's up to you...

@endnode

@node "equip" "Requirements"

@{b}@{u}Requirements@{ub}@{uu}

Any Amiga with OS 2.0 or higher should suit. However, @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} has only
been tested on a Amiga 1200 and 4000, both with Kickstart 3.0 and 4Mb Fast.

You also need a HoF AmigaGuide file. @{i}The only valid HoF files are those
published from @{b}October 1996@{ub}@{ui}; the others are obsolete since the (new) 107%
rule.

The @{i}reqtools.library@{ui} and @{i}diskfont.library@{ui} are also required.

I advise you to use the F.Giannici's @{i}CycleToMenu@{ui} commodity (or any
equivalent) to make the circuits choice easier, as well as @{i}Magic Menu@{ui} (by
Martin Korndörfer and Olaf `Olsen' Barthel) to have nice looking menus (they
are still ugly). You can find those tools in the appropriate directory on
Aminet.

@endnode

@node "install" "Installation"

@{b}@{u}Installation@{ub}@{uu}

Installation is very easy. Just copy the @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} executable file into
the desired directory.

@endnode

@node "lance" "Getting Started"

@{b}@{u}Getting Started@{ub}@{uu}

@{i}@{u}From Workbench:@{ui}@{uu}

Just double-click over the @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} icon to open the window.
There are different @{i}TOOLTYPES@{ui} (which are NOT case sensitive):

@{b}ID@{ub}=your_HoF_ID             Ex: ID=CM

This allows @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} to identify you.
If the chosen ID doesn't appear in the HoF, you can still comapre your
perfomances with the HoF by encoding them manually.
If that Tooltype is not specified, the ID @{i}CM@{ui} is used by default :-)


@{b}HOF@{ub}=your_HoF_file          Ex: HOF=Work:Jeux/grandprix/HoF/HOF_APR.GUIDE

The HoF file to work on. The program won't run if it is not a correct file.
If that Tooltype is not specified, a file requester will appear.


@{b}REC@{ub}=your_records_file      Ex: REC=Work:Jeux/HoF-Analyzer/CM_Records

The @{i}Records@{ui} file to load, which contains the @{i}Manual Times@{ui}. That file has
nothing to do with the @{i}Lap Records@{ui} files from F1GP ! It is a file specific
to @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui}.


@{b}SPLIT@{ub}=SplitTime_file       Ex: SPLIT=Work:Jeux/SplitTime/CM_SplitTimes

The @{i}SplitTime@{ui} file to load. It is a 840 bytes file containing the times
recorded by Rene Smit's @{b}SplitTime@{ub}. @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} allows you to compare
your times with the Virtual times, and load your manual track times from it.


@{b}NEEDPOS@{ub}=your_needed_pos    Ex: NEEDPOS=3

Determines the Global position you want to reach (i.e. the slider position).
If that Tooltype is not specified, the needed position is your Global
position minus one.


@{b}MODE@{ub}=mode_id               Ex: MODE=1

This ToolType allows you to start with the NeedTime calculation Mode of your
choice.
        Equal:    mode_id = 0
        Janak's:  mode_id = 1
        Split:    mode_id = 2
If that Tooltype is not specified, the calculation Mode is Equal.


@{b}WORST@{ub}=worst_id             Ex: WORST=2

This ToolType allows you to start with the Worst track detection mode of
your choice.
        Pos:    worst_id = 0
        Score:  worst_id = 1
        Diff.:  worst_id = 2
        Split:  worst_id = 3
        Date:   worst_id = 4
If that Tooltype is not specified, the Worst button in on Pos.


@{b}FONTNAME@{ub}=window_font_name  Ex: FONTNAME=helvetica

The Font to use in the window. This is useful if your screen font is not
cleanly proportional (i.e. the cyphers' width is not constant). If that
Tooltype is not specified, the screen font is used by default.


@{b}FONTSIZE@{ub}=window_font_size  Ex: FONTSIZE=15

The size of the window font. If that Tooltype is not specified, the screen
font size is used by default.


@{b}WINX@{ub}=X_pos_of_window       Ex: WINX=64

Determines the horizontal position of the window.


@{b}WINY@{ub}=Y_pos_of_window       Ex: WINY=64

Determines the vertical position of the window.



@{i}@{u}From CLI:@{ui}@{uu}

Just type @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} after its path. There is no option because the config
is read from the file @{i}HoF-Analyzer.info@{ui}.
So please refer the Tooltypes'descriptions above.

@endnode

@node "circuit" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Select Track@{ub}
This button allows you to choose the kind of @{"classification" link "list" 0} you want to be
shown into the listview. There are two kinds of classification:

  @{i}@{b}Global@{ui}@{ub}:     Displays the general standings of HoF.

  @{i}@{b}Any Track@{ui}@{ub}:  Displays the time classification of the selected track.

Key shortcut: @{b}s@{ub}

@endnode

@node "from hof" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Get Times@{ub}
This button gives you two possibilities:

  @{i}@{b}From HoF@{ui}@{ub}:  @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} will pick your times directly from the HoF file,
             without any modification.

  @{i}@{b}Manually@{ui}@{ub}:  Your "official" times will be replaced by the Manual Times,
             manually @{"encoded" link "time" 0} or @{"preloaded" link "load" 0}.

Key shortcut: @{b}t@{ub}

@endnode

@node "list" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Standings@{ub}
In this listview, you will find either the general classification or the
selected track classification, according to the @{"Track" link "circuit" 0} button.
If you appear in the classification, the line corresponding to your @{"ID" link "id" 0} is
automatically selected.
An asterisc (*) is displayed after every updated records (as in the HoF).

If you select an entry in the listview, an Info Window will appear.

  If your are in @{"Global" link "circuit" 0} mode, you will see:

    @{b}Global Score@{ub}: the global score of the selected driver
    @{b}Score Delta@{ub}: the score difference with the previous HoF
    @{b}Last HoF Pos@{ub}: the global rank in the previous HoF
    @{b}Average Pos@{ub}: the average track position in the current HoF
    @{b}Qualified Tracks@{ub}: the number of tracks records submitted
    @{b}Highest/Lowest@{ub}: your best and worst track positions

  In @{"Manual" link "from hof" 0} mode, these data are re-calculated.

  If any track is selected :

    @{b}Time@{ub}: the laptime made by the selected driver on the selected track
    @{b}Date@{ub}: the date the record was made
    @{b}Options@{ub}: the HoF options - see the HoF documentation for more details
    @{b}Setup@{ub}: the setup used - see your F1GP documentation for more details

  This Info Window allows you to save the setup by clicking the @{i}Save Setup@{ui}
  button. Then a requester appears asking you to select a setup file to
  save. The saved file is the standard 14 bytes F1GP car setup file format
  and can then be used by F1GP or F1GP-Ed.

@{i}Important Note@{ui}: In @{"Global" link "circuit" 0} mode, your score is the only to be updated, the
others don't change (for example when you become first at a track). This
inconvenient may be removed in the future.


Key shortcuts:
   @{b}Up@{ub} and @{b}Down@{ub} arrows to move in the listview, and @{b}Enter@{ub} to select the
   highlighted entry.
   Keys @{b}1@{ub} -> @{b}9@{ub} and @{b}a@{ub} -> @{b}g@{ub} to select tracks (as in SplitTime).

@endnode

@node "id" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}ID@{ub}
This gadget simply reminds you who you are :-). It has not really a defined
purpose - I sometimes wonder why I kept it...
The only way to change your ID is to edit the @{"ID TOOLTYPE" link "lance" 0}.

@endnode

@node "time" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Time@{ub}
This gadget is only active in @{"Manually" link "from hof" 0} mode. It allows you to enter your
record for the selected circuit. Your @{"rank" link "list" 0} will change automatically, as
well as your @{"Total Score" link "score" 0} and the @{"Need Time" link "needtime" 0}.

Note that there is a faster way to edit your times, using the
@{"Get Split Track Time" link "getsp" 0} menu option.

Key shortcut: @{b}i@{ub} to activate the edit zone.

@endnode

@node "score" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Score@{ub}
Your total score is printed here. In @{"From HoF" link "from hof" 0} mode, the score is the same
as in the HoF, whereas in @{"Manually" link "from hof" 0} mode, your score is recalculated using
your @{"Manual Times" link "time" 0}. Note that you always get a point for having times (see
HoF rules).

@endnode

@node "needpos" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Need Global Pos@{ub}
With this slider, you can specify the position you want to reach in the
general @{"standings" link "list" 0}. @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} will show you a @{"Need Time" link "needtime" 0} for each circuit,
using the method specified by the @{"Mode" link "needmode" 0} button.

Key shortcut: @{b}Left@{ub} and @{b}Right@{ub} arrows.

@endnode

@node "needtime" "Utilisation des Gadgets"

@{b}Need Time@{ub}
Printed here is the time, for the selected track, you will need to reach
the position specified by the @{"slider" link "needpos" 0}.
When you have no time at a circuit, the time to reach in mode @{"Janak's" link needmode 0}
represents the best time to get zero point.
When you have not performed many records, the @{i}Need Time@{ui} may seem strange.
This is because @{"Janak's" link "needmode" 0} calculation needs all the track times.

In @{"Split" link "needmode" 0} mode, the Virtual laptime from SplitTime is displayed.

@endnode

@node "diff" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Diff.@{ub}
Shows the difference between your time and the @{"Need Time" link "needtime" 0}. When your
time is better, the difference is negative, and vice-versa.

@endnode

@node "needmode" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Mode@{ub}
This button determines the calculation method to use for the @{"Need Times" link "needtime" 0}.
There are two modes available:

  @{i}@{b}Equal@{ui}@{ub}:    The score to reach is the same for all circuits:

            @{i}need_score_circuit_x = need_total_score / 16@{ui}.


  @{i}@{b}Janak's@{ui}@{ub}:  @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} uses Michal Janak's formula, which is explained in
            @{i}HoFPoints@{ui}'s documentation. Here is its principle:
            The closer your are from the best time, the less you need to
            improve it. So if you have the best time, you don't need to
            improve it. However, the more your time move away from the best,
            the more you have to improve it.

An additionnal mode (@{i}@{b}Split@{ui}@{ub}) allows you to see your SplitTime Virual times,
which must be pre-loaded, either using the @{"SPLIT" link "load" 0} ToolType or with the
@{"Change Split file" link "changesplit" 0} menu option.

Key shortcut: @{b}m@{ub}

@endnode

@node "enemy" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Enemy@{ub}
You can find here the ID of the driver who sits at the @{"Needed Position" link "needpos" 0}.
He is your @{i}Enemy@{ui} !

@endnode

@node "endiff" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Diff.@{ub}
Shows the difference between your time and your @{"Enemy" link "enemy" 0}'s time. When your time
is better, the difference is negative, and vice-versa.

@endnode

@node "worst" "Using of Gadgets"

@{b}Worst@{ub}
This Cycle Button allows you to see the track(s) you are the @{i}worst@{ui}. There
are three ways to do that:

  @{i}@{b}Pos@{ui}@{ub}     @{i}Hof-Analyzer@{ui} will look for the track where your rank is the worst
          (i.e. the biggest), and display its name in the Text Gadget below.
          Note that if your worst position appears twice (or more),
          @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} will return you the @{b}first@{ub} @{i}worst track@{ui} found (in the
          normal track order).

  @{i}@{b}Score@{ui}@{ub}   The program will look for your worst track score.

  @{i}@{b}Diff.@{ui}@{ub}   @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} will compare the time differences between you and
          @{b}your Enemy@{ub} (not the @{"Need Time" link needtime 0}). The biggest difference is kept.

  @{i}@{b}Split@{ui}@{ub}   The track with the biggest difference between your track time
          and your Virtual time will be displayed.

  @{i}@{b}Date@{ui}@{ub}    Searches for your oldest track record, by comparing the dates in
          the HoF. In @{"Manual" link "from hof" 0} mode, the tracks where you have updated your
          laptime are not included in the comparison.

Key shortcut: @{b}w@{ub}

@endnode

@node "load" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Load Records@{ub}
Opens a file requester and asks you to choose a @{i}Records@{ui} file containing
the @{"Manual Times" link "time" 0}. Those @{i}Records@{ui} files have nothing to do with the @{i}Lap
Records@{ui} files from F1GP !
If the chosen file doesn't exist or is incorrect, there is no modification.
For people who are interested, the @{i}Records@{ui} files are just text files,
easy to edit. When there is no time for a circuit, there is a - (dash)
instead.

@endnode

@node "save" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Save Records@{ub}
Opens a file requester and asks you to choose a @{i}Records@{ui} file that will
contain the @{"Manual Times" link "time" 0} currently into memory. You don't need to be in
@{"Manually" link "from hof" 0} mode for this operation.

@endnode

@node "change" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Change HoF File@{ub}
Opens a file requester and asks you to choose a new HoF file to analyze.
If the operation is successful, the program will recalculate some data and
your @{"Manual Times" link "time" 0} will be kept. If not, nothing will happen.
This operation allows you to see what your rank would have been if you had
made some records three months earlier...

@endnode

@node "changesplit" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Change Split file@{ub}
Opens a file requester and asks you to choose a new SplitTime file to load.
It must be a 840 bytes file generated by Rene Smit's @{b}SplitTime@{ub}.
@{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} needs it to work with Virtual times and track times.

@endnode

@node "about" "Using of Menus"

@{b}About...@{ub}
No comments... See the @{"Author" link "auteur" 0} page.

@endnode

@node "quit" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Quit@{ub}
Exits @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} after confirmation. The close window gadget has the
same effect.

Key shortcut: @{b}ESC@{ub}

@endnode

@node "clear" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Clear Records@{ub}
This option allows you to clear the  @{"Manual Times" link "time" 0} currently in memory.
Your @{"Total Score" link "score" 0} will thus be zero and you will only appear in the general
@{"standings" link "list" 0}, with one point. This operation is NOT reversible !

@endnode

@node "paste" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Paste Records from HoF@{ub}
Very useful when using @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui} for the first time, this function allows
you to copy all the HoF times to the @{"Manual Times" link "time" 0}, so you don't have to
type them in.

@endnode

@node "getsp" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Get Split Track Time@{ub}
Enables you to update the @{"Manual Time" link "time" 0} of the selected track from the one
recorded by SplitTime. This is a fast way to update your times.

@endnode

@node "saveneed" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Save Window State@{ub}
This option specifies if the @{i}Need Global Pos@{ui}, @{i}Mode@{ui}, and @{i}Worst@{ui} gadget status
must be saved when choosing the @{"Save Settings" link "settings" 0} menu option.

@endnode

@node "snapshot" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Snapshot Window@{ub}
This option specifies if the window position must be saved when choosing the
@{"Save Settings" link "settings" 0} menu option.

@endnode

@node "settings" "Using of Menus"

@{b}Save Settings@{ub}
Saves the program configuration into the @{"TOOLTYPES" link "lance" }. Here is what is saved:

  - The HoF file name
  - The @{i}Records@{ui} file name
  - The @{i}SplitTime@{ui} file name
  - The ID
  - The @{i}Need Global Pos@{ui}, @{i}Mode@{ui} and @{i}Worst@{ui} gadget status (if @{"Save Need Pos" link "saveneed" 0} is

I think this is the last version of @{i}HoF-Analyzer@{ui}, so I don't think I will
add any new feature to it. But if someone wants something to be changed, it
will still be possible to do it.
