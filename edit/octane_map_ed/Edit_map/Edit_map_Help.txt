High Octane Map Editor,

   by Paul Overy -TEX(94)-


This map editor can only be used for High Octane Maps,
just save any new maps to a disk named "High_Octane".
                                        -----------

The maps must be placed in a directory called "Roads",
                                               -----
these can be powerpacked for use in the game.  But
will need to be unpacked, to make any new changes.

Computer car directions also need to be overlayed on
the map, this takes some time as the CPU cars need to be
tested in the game to make sure they don't get stuck.


Stick will it, map designs take some time to complete.
