Click on BROWN or GREEN square to choose color.

Click on piece to select a piece.


FONTS

The fonts on this disk must be copied into your Workbench or CLI fonts
directory for FME to work.


NEW MAPS

   When starting a new map, 'NEW' in the menu should be chosen to

   initialize a map to either random land or random land with trees.



DRAWING MAPS

   With a piece chosen, click on the map area to place a piece.

   If the same piece already exists on that point, the piece will be
   removed.


DRAWING LINES

   FME cannot draw diagonal lines.

   FME can draw straight lines or it can draw filled rectangles.


LOADING AND SAVING MAPS

   When loading or saving a map, simply provide the full pathname.


HALF MAPS

   This feature is great, since it will allow a player to build
   his/her own half map and join it with another player's half map.
   Neither player will know what the other player's map will look like.

   A full map consists of a grid of 64(hor) by 64(ver) pieces.(4096 pieces)

   A half map consists of a grid of 32(hor) by 64(ver) pieces.(2048 pieces)

   Therefore, the left half map contains lines 1 to 32 and the right
   half map contains lines 33 to 64.

   The point where both half maps are divided is indicated by two lines
   in the menu bar.

   The left line points to the end of left half map (position 32), and
   the right line points to the start of right half map. (position 33)

   Map coordinates are displayed at the bottom of the pieces menu.

   Joining half maps: Once both half maps have been saved, they can
                      be joined together using the JOIN command to
                      make the full map.

              Syntax: JOIN halfmap1 halfmap2 AS fullmap

   ***Both half maps cannot be the same color.***
                       

SCROLLING

   Since the whole map cannot fit on one screen vertically, scrolling
   is used to access the rest of the map.

   Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll the screen up or down.


RULES OF MAP EDITING

   There are three rules to follow in order to successfully create a custom
   Firepower Map, otherwise FirePower will crash.

   1. Each player must have only one Home Garage.
      (When making a map to play the computer, don't give it a Home Garage)

   2. Each player must have at least one Flag Building.
      (When making a map to play the computer, don't give yourself a
       Flag Building)

   3. In the modem game, the full map in directory MAPP3 must be identical
      on both computers.

   Also, there are three pieces that have roads protruding out of them.

   These are:    1. Flag Building (protruding to the left)

                 2. Medic Building (protruding to the right)

                 3. Helicopter Pad (protruding down)

   Roads should be joined to these pieces. It isn't a must, but it
   keeps the map from looking incomplete.


UTILITIES OBJCOUNT AND CHGCOLOR

   Chgcolor: This program will change a brown half map to a green
             half map or vice versa.

   Objcount: This program measures the strength of a player's fortress
             or an opponent's fortress. (to keep from cheating)

             Objcount prints a count of all Fuel Depos, Flag Building,
             and Turrets.

             My friends and I found these counts to be satisfactory:

                          Flags Building - max. 5
                          Fuel Depos     - min. 10
                          Turrets        - max. 200


USING THE MAPS

   Maps on the FirePower diskette are kept in three directories:

    MAPP1 - This directory contains 5 full maps to play against the computer.
            They are named t1,t2,t3,t4 and t5.

    MAPP2 - This directory contains 5 full maps for the 2 player game.
            They are named t1,t2,t3,t4 and t5.

    MAPP3 - This directory contains only 1 full map, it's for the modem game.
            There can only be one full map(NOT HALF MAP) in this directory,
            and both computers must have the same map. The map is named t1.
