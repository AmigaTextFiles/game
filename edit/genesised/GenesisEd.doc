Leveleditor "Genesis"
=====================

This is a level editor for a small Dungeon
Action game developped by Alex Grasso (he
is also the author of the Editor). There
will also soon be a little Converter
that will be able to convert the data
format of the editor to that of my
upcoming Roleplaying Game "Darkchild"
(was called "Derring" some times ago...
Demo of an old version of the engine is
on Aminet).

The Editor only runs on AGA machines,
as Alex used the ChangeScreenBuffer
command, even if i warned him from
the command. My game, though, will
use ScrollVPort for DoubleBuffering
and will run (i will have a demo ready
soon after i come back from holidays)
on AGA, CyberGraphX, EGS and Picasso II,
using my rtgmaster.library. I probably will
update Alex's Editor Sources then, too,
so that the Editor will run under
CyberGraphX, too.

So, if anybody wants to help Alex and me
with our games (a Screenshot of the up to
now Alpha of my game is in that package),
try out that Editor !!!

Sadly, before i went to holiday, Alex only
gave me the disk with Executable and Source,
but with absolutely NO documentation of
the Editor. And he currently has no modem.
Well, i will try to explain you what i found
out myself about the editor. The next version
of it (probably coming with the Beta Version
of my game) will have better Docs.

Assign genesis: to the place where you installed
the Editor. Start it, then press the key "E"
for editing mode. Choose a Texture (up to now
only the 0 and the 1 in the first line of numbers
work). Use the EQ/LA Button for switching between
LA (Laufen, German for "Move" (Alex' English is
not very well, he does everything in German...))
to move around in the dungeon with your mouse
cursor being in the Dungeon Window and EQ (no
idea for what this stands...) to edit. You can
move around parts of the Dungeon (you create such
a part using the red square button) to another
place. Delete a part using the crossed out
square.

Note : The engine of both games is full 3D, so
you can even climb up a shaft or go upside-down
to a hole, or climb up the walls... (you can go
up and down using the right mouse button).
Note: Put that ST Button on the state where it is
coloured GREY, else some stuff will not work....

Alex' game will be a 320x256 AGA game, some sort of
a one-player "Kargon". Mine will be a 640x480
(GFX Boards)/640x512 (AGA) game and a full RPG.
Alex and i both hope to get out demo versions soon.

We are VERY interested in Levels done with Alex'
level editor (the file format of both games nearly
is the same, only the numbering of the textures and
the organization of the 3D array differs a bit...).
Also i MIGHT be interested, if someone would be
interested in doing a PC and/or Mac version of my
game (not sure, if i want this, still... as i
would prefer an Amiga only game, as Amiga fanatic
that i am... but maybe a Amiga/PC/Mac game would
bring more cash... as to the whole game GFX being
chunky it should not be that hard to convert...)

I am also interested, if ANYBODY can do a rtg-sublibrary
for rtgmaster.library for the Merlin GFX Board. Alex
only has a Merlin, so up to now he can't run the Alpha
of my game. Would be great, if some Merlin owner
could do this sublibrary, or at least give me
Autodocs&Includes for the Merlin, so that i or
Alex could do it...

More information about rtgmaster.library (including
a Beta-version for downloading) can be found on
http://www.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/fachschaft/adressen/haeuser.html

Another note : Up to now the Editor only features
ONE texture at a time. This is NOT a problem of
the fileformat, it is a problem of the Editor.
This will change in a future version of the
Editor.

Sorry, if that doc-file is a bit chaotic... i am
going to holidays tomorrow and still have not put
together my stuff... so i did the doc-file in
5 minutes free time :)

oops... noticed, i forgot something... save with s
(will be saved to ram: with fixed filename) and
load with l... future versions of the Editor probably
will be more comfortable...
