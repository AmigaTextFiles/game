        I'm playing UFO for nearly 4 years. It's a very hard game,
        so I decided to cheat to win. The structure of the savegame
        is very easy to analyze so I changed values manually.

        In November 1998 I found the Basiccompiler ACE in the Aminet.
        I tested this tool and wrote this program...

        By reading the word "cheat" you will know what this tool is for.
        Ok, it's a tool to change values of soldiers and bases.

        Now you will ask "Why one more UFO-Savegame-Editor".

        Right, there are a lot of editors in the Aminet. All have one
        disadvantage: they won't work with my UFO version.
        Sure there are some cheat-guides with some addresses of the
        savegame file. But I found out nearly all and it's very time
        expensive to change the values of 20 soldiers manually.
        Then you have to search always the right position to insert
        something. Then happens something like : changed value to get
        65535 Elerium 115 and move 2 Byte to far you have 65535 mind
        probes.
        Here you need this tool. Change the savegame without using
        much time. Cheat the right positions with the right values.
        No longer counting bytes or calculating dec numbers to hex
        numbers to cheat.

          Copy the program file and the documentation to wherever
          you want (I suggest your UFO drawer to have an easy access
          to the savegames).

        Please read @{"Protection advice" link "Sicherheit" 0} before.


        At first you have to load a savegame. If you copied this
        tool to your UFO drawer, you have to change only the dir
        to one of the game_x drawers.

        Data of the game will be read.

        Then the main window appears. There are 6 Buttons for
        the most important data of the game

        SOLDIER  :   A window with the names of your first 20 soldiers
                     appear. You can optimize a soldier by clicking
                     his name.
                     The following values will be set

                     Timeunits     : 200      should be enough
                     Health        : 255      Maximum
                     Energie       : 189      not more possible
                     Reaktion      : 255      Maximum
                     Strengh       : 127      not more possible
                     Shotability   : 255      Maximum
                     Dropability   : 255      Maximum
                     PSI Strengh   : 127      it's enough
                     PSI Ability   : 127      it's enough

                     Injury        : 0        soldier become healthy
                     Armour        : Flying suit


        BASES     :  At first appers a window with all basenames
                     Only existing Bases can be modified.
                     If you click the name you can choose to change
                     the installation or the storage.

          Installations : A window with the 36 fields of the base
                     will appear.

                     AL = Access Lift     PD = Plasmadefence
                     QU = Living Quarter  FD = Fusionsballdefence
                     LA = Laboratory      GS = GravShield
                     WS = Workshop        MS = MindShield
                     sR = small Radar     PL = PSI Laboratory
                     lR = large Radar     HW = Hyperwave-decoder
                     MD = Missledefence   H1 = Hangarfield left above
                     ST = General Store   H2 = Hangarfield right above
                     AC = Alien Cont.     H3 = Hangarfield left below
                     LD = Laserdefence    H4 = Hangarfield right below

                     Click to a field and you can choose a building.

                     When you change a field the time to build is
                     set to 1. (technical reasons)

           Stores  : the buttons Weapons, Munition, other equipment and
                        craft equipment are explaning themselves

                     By clicking an object you can choose the value


            OTHERS :  the Money and the actual day can be changed

                     MONEY : the money is set to 1 000 000 000 through
                             a click (should be enough)

                     DAY  : a number from 1 to 31 can be choosen


        SAVE        :  saves the data back to the savegame

        ABOUT     :  info

        QUIT      :  you can leave this program (hey great)

                          Added a requester when leaving the program

           @{b}DANGER:@{ub} This tool works only with @{b}@{u}one@{ub}@{uu} of the
            ECS versions of UFO. One version and the AGA version
            use a lot of files (base.dat,soldier.dat...) to save
            the data. For these versions you find a lot of tools in
            the Aminet. To use my tool you need the version which
            save all data to one file with the length of @{b}45299 Byte@{ub}
            and the name savegame.sav .

            If the choosen file has no lenght of 45299 the program
            will not work.

            Always use a copy of your savegame.sav file (There are
            10 Slots to save the game in UFO)
