Dune II Cheater V1.00 - By DARK DREAMS DESIGNS


- What is it!?
--------------

It's a saved game patcher...


- Requirements:
---------------

. An Amiga
. Dune II (Ver1.0) - The game


- What does it do?
------------------

The feature is:

. Changes current spice to 30,000 units
(Don't forget you need Spice Storage Silos)


- How to work it?
-----------------

. Run Dune II, start a new game and save it.

. Exit Dune II and run Dune II Cheater.

. Select the directory where the game installed and select the file
  you saved (should be named «Save Name».DAT).

. The program then loads the saved game, patches it and saves it.

. You can also patch old saved games ;)


- How to install?
-----------------

Just copy the icon into the directory you wish (I keep mine in the Dune II directory)

And that's all...


- The Future?
-------------

Well, I've already studied the Napalm file structure and I'm pretty sure i can
hack it (has soon has the *full* game is released).

I already know how Colonization saves the game files, but the cheater for it
will need some extra work because the saves don't have a constant size :(.
