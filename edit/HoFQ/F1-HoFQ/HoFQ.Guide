   order to run the program.

 · A @{b}68020@{ub} or better processor is required.

 · Memory required: @{b}<512K@{ub} of RAM.

@ENDNODE

@REM "********************************************************************"

@NODE "intro" "Program Intrdouction.."

 @{b}*PROGRAM INTRODUCTION*@{ub}

 · The @{b}F1GP HoF Qualifier@{ub} is a program that was designed for keeping track
   of your qualifying lap-times for the @{b}Amiga F1GP Hall of Fame@{ub}.

 · All the vital information that is required for the HoF can be stored in
   a separate (personal) data file.

 · You are allowed additionally to export as many of your qualifying times
   out to a file ready for submission to Alan Strang (the moderator of the
   Amiga Hall of Fame).

 · At present there are few methods of obtaining your qualifying data for
   the HoF.  One is @{b}F1GP-RES@{ub}.  This was written by Edo Nijmeijer in AMOS.
   It is now old and very slow.  A second option is to use @{b}F1GP-Ed@{ub} written
   by Oliver Roberts.  Your setup data can be exported to a file ready for
   the HoF.  This is better than F1GP-RES, its faster for one, however it
   is limited in its use.  A third way is to type your results into a text
   editor, formatting them to look like the HoF.

 · Alternatively you could save yourself the hassle and use a dedicated
   utility like @{b}F1GP HoF Qualifier v2.05.@{ub}  It's just the job for it.
   A well-presented GUI coded 100% in assembler.

 · We hope you like this program, we hope to improve it even further in
   the near future.  We look forward to your comments.

 · Look out for updates and other HoF Qualifier related updates on Aminet,
   Alan Strangs' web site and @{b}soon@{ub} on Rob Wilsons' web site:-

      http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~recoil/

 @{b}*POSSIBLE OPTIONS*@{ub}

 · Options which (can) appear in the option field in the exported records.
 
       Br   Auto Brakes              A    Hard    (A) compound tyre
       G    Auto gears               B    Medium  (B) compound tyre
       Sp   Self-Righting Spins      C    Soft    (C) compound tyre
       L    Best Line                D    V.Soft  (D) compound tyre
       S    Suggested gears          W    Wet     (W) compound tyre
                                     Q*   Qualify (Q) compound tyre

       2    2 button gears           J    Analogue joystick
       H    HP fixed at 716          K    Keyboard
       T    Traction control off

       F    10 frames/sec PAL or NTSC (under F1GP-Ed v3.3x)

 · @{b}NOTE:@{ub} Q tyres are assumed default and will be not exported as an
   option.


 @{b}*PRIORITY OF OPTIONS*@{ub}

 · On exporting of record data, it is important to know that the program
   has been written with a view that some options when selected have a
   distinct priority above others.  For example, the options 'H' and 'F'
   have a priority above all other options.  This is due to the rulings
   laid down in the F1GP HoF.  All competitors are expected to qualify
   with their cars HP fixed at 716 and the frame rate set 10 frames/sec,
   although 8 frames/sec is allowed.

 · If you were to export data with all options set, you will notice that
   not all options will be written in the export file.  This is because
   there is not enough room to print all the options.  Whether this will
   change in the future is unknown.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "runni" "Running the program.."

 @{b}*RUNNING THE PROGRAM*@{ub}

 · Just double-click on the program's icon from Workbench.

 · Alternatively you could run the program from the CLI/Shell.

 · Running the HoF Qualifier with the RUN and RUNBACK commands (which may
   be present) in your Sys:c/ drawer is acceptable.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "toolt" "Tooltypes & CLI usage.."

 @{b}*TOOLTYPES*@{ub}

 · There are several tooltypes which can be set:-

   @{b}EXPORTPATH@{ub}   · Location for your exported HoF record file to reside.
                  e.g. EXPORTPATH=Leisure:HallofFame/

   @{b}FILEPATH@{ub}     · Location where your HoF datafile resides.
                  e.g. FILEPATH=Leisure:HallofFame/

   @{b}FILENAME@{ub}     · The filename given to the HoF datafile.
                  e.g. LapTimes.HoFQ

   @{b}MATCHPAT@{ub}     · The set file pattern match in the load requester.
                  e.g. MATCHPAT=#?.HoFQ

   @{b}AUTOLOAD@{ub}     · Loading of the HoF datafile can be initiated at run-time.
                  e.g. AUTOLOAD=YES (default is NO)

   @{b}ASKOVERWRITE@{ub} · Allows you to disable the requester which confirms the
                  overwriting of a HoFQ datafile.
                  e.g. ASKOVERWRITE=NO (default is YES)

   @{b}QUALKEY@{ub}      · Allows you to disable the use of the Amiga qualifier key
                  for accessing gadgets via keyboard shortcuts.
                  e.g. QUALKEY=NO (default is YES)

   @{b}OLDFRAME@{ub}     · Allows you to use the old (now obsolete 'F5') frame rate
                  option setting.  This has since been replaced with 'F'.
                  e.g. OLDFRAME=YES (default is NO)

   @{b}ZOOMTOP@{ub}      · Allows you to enter the vertical position for the title bar
                  of the HoF Qualifier, when in a zoomed state.
                  e.g. ZOOMTOP=80 (default is 20)

   @{b}ZOOMLEFT@{ub}     · Allows you to enter the vertical position for the title bar
                  of the HoF Qualifier, when in a zoomed state.
                  e.g. ZOOMLEFT=140 (default is 40)

   @{b}ZOOMED@{ub}       · Allows you to run the HoF Qualifier in a zoomed state.
                  You will only see a title bar on your WB.
                  e.g. ZOOMTOP=YES (default is NO)

   @{b}SETUPSPATH@{ub}    · Allows you to set the dir of where your F1GP setups reside.
                  e.g. SETUPSPATH=F1GP:Setups

 @{b}*CLI USAGE*@{ub}

   SETUPSPATH/K

@ENDNODE

@NODE "othe2" "Other Features.."

 @{b}*OTHER FEATURES*@{ub}

 · Minimize Gadget - You can shrink the GUI down to a title bar by clicking
   on its minimize gadget.  Clicking again on this gadget returns the GUI
   to its normal size.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "quitt" "Quitting the program.."

 @{b}*QUITTING THE PROGRAM*@{ub}

 · Click on the close gadget of the GUI.  Pretty trivial really.

 · Note if any changes have been made, a confirmation requester will be
   displayed, asking you if you want to abandon changes.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "insta" "Installation.."

 @{b}*INSTALLATION*@{ub}

 · Just copy the main program and this guide to somewhere appropriately on
   your system.

   e.g.  @{b}Leisure:Formula-1/HoF/HoF_Qualifier@{ub} main program file

   e.g.  @{b}Workbench3.0:Guides/HoF_Qualifier.Guide@{ub} guide documentation

@ENDNODE

@NODE "gui00" "The GUI Layout.."

 @{b}*THE GUI LAYOUT*@{ub}

 · The layout of the GUI for any Amiga Formula-1 addict should be pretty
   intuitive.  In fact it is very similar to that in Amiga F1GP (by
   Microprose) and in certain sections of the Amiga F1GP Editor (by
   Oliver Roberts).

 · The next several sections will describe the buttons and gadgets in the
   GUI window.

 @{b}Load Gadget@{ub}

 · Brings up a requester for loading in a datafile.


 @{b}Load Button@{ub}

 · The @{b}load button@{ub} differs completely from the @{b}Load gadget@{ub} and the two
   should not be confused.  This button allows you to load previously
   saved car setups from the Microprose game @{b}Formula-1 Grand Prix@{ub}.
   You can also press Amiga-S on the keyboard to call up the load requester.

 · @{b}NOTE:@{ub} The @{b}Amiga Qualifier Key@{ub} will only be available if set in the
   tooltypes e.g. QUALKEY=YES, or it has been passed as a CLI parameter
   e.g. Run Leisure:F1GP/HoF/HoF_Qualifier QUALKEY


 @{b}Save@{ub}

 · Save out all the information into a datafile.


 @{b}Clear@{ub}

   edit set-ups for a @{b}wet@{ub} qualifying session, or a @{b}dry@{ub} qualifying
   session.  Just click on the cycle gadget, or, hold Amiga-W.  The 'W'
   stands for 'Weather type' not 'Wet'.

 · This feature has been incorporated, due, to a new option implemented in
   F1GP-Ed v3.34.  You can now qualify in wet conditions and submit new lap
   records via the HoF Qualifier.  See the HoF October 97 (or later) and
   F1GP-Ed 3.34 for more detailed information.

 · @{b}NOTE:@{ub} The @{b}Amiga Qualifier Key@{ub} will only be available if set in the
   tooltypes e.g. QUALKEY=YES, or it has been passed as a CLI parameter
   e.g. Run Leisure:F1GP/HoF/HoF_Qualifier QUALKEY


 @{b}Circuit Name@{ub}

 · The name of circuit currently selected (default is USA)


 @{b}Circuits@{ub}

 · The 16 circuits as listed in F1GP.  Each of these circuits can have
   their own independent setups and options.  After clicking on the
   desired circuit button, you may then edit these setups and options
   using the appropriate gadgets in the HoF Qualifier GUI.


 @{b}Circuit Checkboxes@{ub}

 · By selecting a track via a checkbox, you have nominated a track ready
   for exporting.  The export button will now be available.


 @{b}Export Records@{ub}

 · The export button will become available, only, when one or more circuit
   checkboxes have been selected.

 · When this is the case, you can export all the data to a file ready for
   submitting to the Amiga F1GP Hall of Fame.

 · It is important to note, that, the circuits that have been checked on a
   @{b}dry@{ub} setting may differ from those (if any) checked on a @{b}wet@{ub} setting.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "gui04" "User ID.."

 @{b}ID@{ub}

 · Your HoF qualifier ID is to be entered in the text box on the GUI.

 · Either click in the text box using the mouse to get there, or use

 · @{b}NOTE:@{ub} The @{b}Amiga Qualifier Key@{ub} will only be available if set in the
   tooltypes e.g. QUALKEY=YES, or it has been passed as a CLI parameter
   e.g. Run Leisure:F1GP/HoF/HoF_Qualifier QUALKEY

@ENDNODE

@NODE "gui05" "Qualifying Information.."

 @{b}Score@{ub}

 · Once a qualifying time and a pole time have been entered your score
   is calculated.  @{b}Note:@{ub} The 107% time ruling applys here, therefore
   any times equal to/or outside 107% will not receive any points.

@NODE "futur" "Future updates.."

 @{b}*FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS*@{ub}

 · Standings - In v3.00 we want to implement the Standings list from the
   Amiga F1GP-Hall of Fame.  This could give you a rough idea of where
   you will stand in the next 'Hall of Fame' when you have submitted your
   new qualifying times.  However, of course your final standing will depend
   on all the other competitors scores for that HoF.

 · Font sensitivity - on 1280x1024 size screen, the standard topaz font
   looks a bit small.  So we hope to include code to allow the program
   to use the current screen font, i.e. font sensitive.

 · Probably NTSC support (depending on demand).

 · Possible MUI version (depending on demand).

 · Features that any users can think of will probably be included if we
   like them enough.

 · Plus many numerous things we are thinking of.
