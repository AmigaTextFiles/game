@node Shar "Shareware"

        This program is @{i}SHAREWARE@{ui}. It means you can use it, but
if you find this program useful, you shall pay for it. Recommended price
is $15 or DM20. 

        It is good to pay me for my work. Although has program many buggs,
I had with it a lot of work. I remember as I was printing list of codes
on my Epson LX-850 at 3.45 AM. That was noisy !! :-) . If you decide to
pay it, you can send money to @{"me" link auth}.

@node A "About BIME"

        Battle Isle Map Editor is very useful program, with which you
can create your own map for game Battle Isle (C) Blue Byte. It's simple
to use and if you like BI, you have it for a lot of hours of fun.

        Although I made it for me and my friends, I decided to release
it. That's why I release it so late.
        
        I decide write this program because I have it played with my 
friend and I ever lose. He was better and after some maps was game boring,
So is it. When BIME was ready, we have maked maps, where I had many 
additional units and I have won sometimes. It's also good for testing
your strategy ability in different situations.. 

                @{i}@{b}Requirements@{ub}@{ui}

You need original Battle Isle game (not BI '93 or BI 2) and 
1 MEG of memory (I didn't tested it on 0.5MB, but most AMOS programs 
needs 1 meg).

One remark: I 've lost source :-(((. Oh shit!. Yes. When I bought HDD 
and I copied disc to HDD, I forgot copy the BIME source disc and I have 
formatted it. I recovered only compiled executable and I'm too lazy to
write this again, so this is the last version (but if you want to make
better version, write to me and if you won't be alone, we will see...:-)
@EndNode

@node Inst Installation
        If you have HDD, just copy BIME1.2 and BIME1.2.info into your 
directory, where you wish have this editor and file 00.FIN copy 
to the BI2:Map/ directory.

        If you haven't HDD, copy files BIME1.2 & BIME1.2.info on your
disc, where you wish have this editor and file 00.FIN copy at DISK 2
in directory MAP.

@Node Use "How to use Battle Isle Map Editor"

        When editor is loaded, you can see two pannels and "cursor".
Left pannel shows your map which you're creating, right pannel shows
terrain types, buildings or units (TT), which you can choose and put it 
at your map. Switch "cursor" between pannels with @{i}TAB@{ui} and move
"cursor" with @{i}JOYSTICK@{ui}. At the bottom between the pannels you 
can see TT, which have you selected (here is one bug - this works not 
properly). In left pannel you can put this selected TT in you map by 
pressing @{i}FIRE@{ui}. Pressing @{i}FIRE@{ui} in right pannel you select
TT, which is between the pannels.


        You can (and probably must) control BIME with @{i}PULL DOWN@{ui}
Menus.
