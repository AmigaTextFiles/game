Since we have added several features which aren't entirely intuitive, I am
including this small doc to explain how Carned works.

Basic Operation:  There is an icon palette to the right of the screen.  There
   are 18 different types of 'terrain' in carned, and each of these is
   represented by an icon.  The current icon is shown in a little red box
   directly to the left and by the top of the palette.  This program is all
   point-and-click.  It can be hard to tell exactly what is happening near
   the edges of the screen.  If you select <<Offset Map>> from the <<Project>>
   menu, it will scroll the map, so you can see the edges better.  When you're
   finished, I recommend using <<Correct Walls>> from the <<Project>> menu.
   This will make sure that all the walls 'look right' in the game.


Project Menu:
   About..........The names of the cyber-gods who wrote Carned :)
   Help...........A pretty weak help screen *sorry*
   Restore Load...Restores the level from the original loaded file
   Restore Save...Restores the level from when you last "Saved"
   Save...........Saves the level to a temp file
   Size...........Switch between 32x32s grid and 16x16 grids
   Random Map.....Creates a random map, overwrites current map
   Correct Walls..Error checking to make sure every wall is terminated
	             Properly
   Offset Map.....Shift the map over and down by half, so you can see the
        	     edges of the map and how it will 'tile'
   ReDraw Map.....Once you <<Correct Walls>>, every changed block will be
                     red, this will let you clear it back to white.
   Clear Map......Blank every square in the map
   Undo...........Undoes the last square you changed
   Quit...........Drops out of the map editor and prompts you for a level name.

As was noted in 'Carned.Readme', The Shareware version of Carnage will only
use 2 maps.  You will want to save this level as either "Level.000" or
"Level.001".  Doing this will erase the original level.
