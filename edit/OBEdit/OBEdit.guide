@node intro "Oy, what's this for then?"
@smartwrap
@{jcenter}@{b}INTRODUCTION@{ub}

@{jleft}

OBEdit is a handy little proggy for editing an important aspect of MicroProse's
excellent games @{i}X-COM: UFO Defense @{ui}(or @{i}UFO: Enemy Unknown @{ui})
and @{i}X-COM II: Terror From The Deep @{ui}- The weapons' performances.


Well, what it actually @{u}does@{uu} is read the file OBDATA.DAT and extract
information about the different weapons and other equipment stored there. The
info is then saved to either an ASCII standard CSV (Comma Separated Variables)
or a TSV (Tab Separated Variables) file with or without an appropriate RFF header.


The CSV format (or ADCH, if you are familiar with FinalData) can be read by
most database programs and spreadsheets. This is also true for the TSV format
that uses TABs to separate the variables rather than commas.
The RFF format is identical to the TSV format, except that it also contains
an RFF header that determines how the data will be
presented by the program reading it. There is only one program that reads
RFF headers, as far as I know, and that is DB 3.5 by David Ekholm.


RFF files are by far the best alternative to be mucking around with. To use
them, however, you'll need DB v3.5 or newer. DB is a fully-functional Shareware
program that can be D/L'ed from aminet at biz/dbase/db.lha. You could also
try to get the newest version from the DB homepage at
@{" http://wfmh.man.szczecin.pl/db/ " system "ibrowse:ibrowse URL http://wfmh.man.szczecin.pl/db/"}


At this point you may ask yourself: "Awright, so I'll have a nice and readable
database file with interesting stuff from OBDATA.DAT, but this still doesn't
make the game any different. Surely there has to be more?" And the answer is
Yes, of course there's more!


OBEdit is not limited to just churning out CSV/TSV and RFF files, it can also read
them and apply their data to OBDATA.DAT. The logical editing process will then
be: @{fg shine}Extract data to CSV or RFF file -> Load CSV or RFF file into appropriate
program and make some changes -> Import CSV/TFV/RFF file and apply changes to
OBDATA.DAT => Cool!@{fg text}


Additionally (yes, there is even more!) OBEdit will list records to the console
window in various ways: Index list, single object info and info of @{u}all@{uu} objects.


Now isn't that just dandy...

@endnode
@node motivation "Why bother?"
@smartwrap
@{jcenter}@{b}MOTIVATION@{ub}

@{jleft}

The primary reason I made this program was because I wanted to learn how to
program in AmigaE. I also wanted to learn more object-oriented programming
and file I/O in general. When I decided to undertake this project, I was also
becoming increasingly addicted to X-COM: UFO Defense, and in my search for utils
for this game I noticed that the only weapons editors were for the PC version.
Using AZap and/or FileX I had tracked down the offsets for damage, accuracy and
TU usage. Now, using AZap to change these values is very cumbersome and time
consuming, so I though I'd write my own X-COM editor, me being a student of
computer science and all.


My first major decision was wether to write it in C or AmigaE, or even JAVA. The
latter was ruled out rather quickly, since there were no really functioning
compilers for AmigaOS at the time. Too bad, really, since I do most of my
educational programming in JAVA. Turning to C, I had some basic knowledge of the
language and DICE 1.10 that came with an Amiga Format cover-CD. Unfortunaly,
DICE was too outdated to do the stuff I wanted to, and upgrading it would be too
much of an effort.


Enter AmigaE 3.3: A fully-featured AmigaOS programming environment with 
good documentation and OS 2.0+ support. And well within my price range too...
After skimming through Jason Hulance's beginner's guide and some example source
code, I started programming right away.


To find more info about the OBDATA.DAT file, I turned to Robert T. Scott, the
creator of XCOMUtil for the PC. He graciously sent me the source code of
the part of XCOMUtil that deals with the OBDATA.DAT file, filling out the gaps in my
knowledge about it.


Soon after that, the first test version of OBEdit was compiled and
successfully executed. At this point it could only read OBDATA.DAT and print out
the info it found there to the console. Either as a list of names and indexes,
or detailed information about a specific object. These abilities have remained literaly
unchanged up to the current version.


Then, my education required more of my attention for a while, and the project
was put "on ice" for a couple of months.


Returning to the project, I faced yet another important decision: To GUI or not
to GUI! I could make it a command-line program only, implement some kind of
console, or study MUI or GadTools. Looking over the beginner's guide for some
clue about the use of GadTools, I noticed the string and I/O examples that used
the common CSV format to store data. Something went "ding" in the back of my
head, and I realized that making OBEdit export and import CSV files that could
be edited by dedicated spreadsheet or database programs would save me a shitload of
work!


A couple of hours' worth of programming later, OBEdit exported its first
comma-separated ASCII file that was readable by FinalData. Taking the idea still
further, the cunning implementation of the file's delimiter as an argument to
the procline() method and the insertion of an RFF header enabled the program to
import/export files that were readable by DB as well. And by yet another stroke
of genius, I enabled OBEdit to read this RFF header from an external file,
making it possible for the user to have DB display the data as he/she sees fit.


And the rest, as they say, is @{"history" link history}...

@endnode
@node req "You'll be needing some stuff to use this"
@tab 3
@{jcenter}@{b}REQUIREMENTS@{ub}
@{jleft}
The following is required to use OBEdit:

	- An Amiga, or at least a half-decent PC running UAE.
	- OS 2.0 or higher. (Developed under OS 3.0)
	- X-COM I and/or X-COM II (Any versions)

Also, the following is STRONGLY recommended:

	- A database or spreadsheet program capable of reading and writing CSV files
		- or -
	- DB 3.5 or newer.

	- A hard drive.

It is theoretically possible to edit the CSV/TSV/RFF files with a normal
text-editor, but this is only marginally better than to change the OBDATA.DAT
file directly with f.ex. AZap or some other binary editor.

@endnode
@node install "Gettin' stuff up an' runnin'"
@tab 3
@{jcenter}@{b}INSTALLATION@{ub}
@{jleft}
Installing OBEdit is quite easy:

	- Copy the main program file to anywhere you want to use it from. The
	  easiest would be your c: assign.

	- Copy OBEdit.guide anywhere. Like locale:help or your X-COM drawer.

It is also @{b}strongly@{ub} recommended that you make a backup of your
original OBDATA.DAT file. Under no circumstances should the program destroy the
OBDATA.DAT file, save for the extremely unlikely event that there is a power
failure during the microseconds it takes to write it to your HD. However, you
may one day wish to restore the game's original settings.

@{jcenter}@{b}USAGE@{ub}

@{jleft}

OBEdit is a command-line only program. There is no GUI, no MUI or anything like
that; everything is controlled by the arguments you give it. The arguments are
case insensitive and must be in @{u}exactly@{uu} 
the right order. There's no need to despair, however, as the commands are very
logical, and there's really not that many of them. The commands are: "exportcsv",
"exportrff", "import" and the optional "all". Here's a list of what they do:


	- @{b}exportcsv @{ub}@{lindent 8} Export a comma-separated ASCII
file. The command can be shortened to "c".@{lindent 0}


	-@{b}exporttsv @{ub}@{lindent 8} Export a tab-separated ASCII file.
Short version: T.@{lindent 0}


	- @{b}exportrff @{ub}@{lindent 8} Export a tab-separated ASCII file with an RFF
header. Short version: R.@{lindent 0}


	- @{b}import @{ub}@{lindent 8} Import either a CSV or RFF file (the program will
recognize the format automatically). Short version: I.@{lindent 0}


	- @{b}all @{ub}@{lindent 8} An optional switch that is always the @{u}last@{uu} argument.
When used with @{fg shine}exportcsv@{fg text} or @{fg shine}exportrff@{fg text},
it will cause ALL 80 records in OBDATA.DAT to be exported rather than just the
first 50, which contain the useful stuff. And when used instead of the index
number directly after the .DAT file to scan, it will list ALL records in the
file to the console.@{lindent 0}

	- @{b}verbose @{ub}@{lindent 8} Another optional switch that is always the @{u}last@{uu} 
argument. Used with @{fg shine}exportcsv@{fg text}, @{fg shine}exportrff@{fg text} 
or @{fg shine}import@{fg text} it causes the program to report its
activities to the console window. I.e. it will print the name and index
numbers of the weapons it exports or imports. This command can @{u}not@{uu}
be used with the @{fg shine}all@{fg text} option. Short version: V.@{lindent 0}


To sum it all up, the syntax is:


@{code}@{fg shine}obedit <file to scan> <record number/exportcsv/exportrff/import/all> <file to export to/file to import from> <all> <(v)erbose>
@{fg text}@{body}


At any time during execution you can press CTRL+C to abort whatever OBEdit is
doing. This is most useful during file contents listings, as importing and
exporting normally takes less than one second unless Verbose mode is active.


@{b}NOTE:@{ub} In the Amiga version of X-Com: UFO Defense the OBDATA.DAT file is
kept in two separate directories: GEODATA, where it is read by the GEO program
(including the UFOPaedia) and UFOGRAF, where it is read by the TACTICAL program
(the action sequences). I'm not sure if this is the case with the PC floppy
version, but in the CD version, only the file in GEODATA is read.


Confused? Don't worry, after reading @{"the next bit" link examples}, everything will (hopefully) seem like
a walk in the park.

From v1.2 on OBEdit is capable of scanning exported ASCII files in much the same
manner as OBDATA.DAT. The ASCII-scanning mode is activated when the supplied
#1 file is not 4320 bytes long. The algorithms for viewing ASCII files are
the same as the ones used for import, only the results are printed to the
console rather than written to OBDATA.DAT. This feature is not all that useful
as such, but for all you slightly paranoid people out there it is a reassuring
way to check your files' integrities before using that dreaded "import" command.


	@{fg shine}obedit obdata.csv@{fg text}


This will scan the file "obdata.csv", determine its type and print the records
therein to the console. In this case, it is a comma-separated file, but 
keep in mind that the suffix has no effect on how OBEdit identifies files.
Note that line numbering starts from 1 and not 0. Any records that contain
errors will be printed to the console along with a helpful error message.

	@{fg shine}obedit obdata.dat exportcsv obdata.adch@{fg text}


Scan "obdata.dat" and make a comma-separated ASCII file (with header names)
called "obdata.adch" that contains data for the first 50 (#0 to 49) records in
the data file. This file can be imported and edited by most half-decent database
(f.ex. FinalData) or spreadsheet (f.ex. TurboCalc) programs.


	@{fg shine}obedit obdata.dat exportrff obdata.db@{fg text}


As above, only that the file "obdata.db" will be a tab-separated ASCII file with
an RFF header that will make the resulting file readable to @{" DB " link intro 19}.


	@{fg shine}obedit obdata.dat exporttsv obdata.tsv@{fg text}


Very similar to the @{fg shine}exportrff@{fg text} command, but the RFF-header
will be omitted.


	@{fg shine}obedit obdata.dat exportcsv obdata.adch all
@{line}	obedit obdata.dat exportrff obdata.db all@{fg text}


When used with either "exportXXX"-statement, the ALL switch will cause the resulting
CSV or RFF files to contain ALL 80 records within "obdata.dat". Unless you
REALLY want to make some radical changes that I can't possibly think of as
useful, there is no reason to ever use this option. All the interesting stuff
(as well as a lot of uninteresting), like weapons and ammo is within the first 50
records.

@endnode
@node ex_import "Importing ASCII files"
@tab 3
@smartwrap

	@{fg shine}obedit obdata.dat import obdata.csv@{fg text}


The "import" command is the only one that changes the contents of "obdata.dat".
In the above case, the file obdata.csv would be read to memory, and the data it
contained would be applied to "obdata.dat". As previously stated, the program
will determine wether the file it reads is of RFF or CSV or TSV format itself. If the
file is neither, the program will exit, and nothing will be changed in
"obdata.dat".


@{b}NOTE:@{ub} The OBDATA.DAT file will @{u}always@{uu} be checked for being
@{u}exactly@{uu} 4 320 bytes long. If this is not the case, then the program
will assume it is a CSV, TSV or RFF file and scan this as if it was being
imported, and a brief summary will printed to the console. If the Verbose option
is checked, the program will also list details about the valid objects it finds.


Now that you know how to import and export RFF and CSV/TSV files, let's look at 
@{"how to edit them" link expedit}.

@{jcenter}@{b}Editing exported CSV, TSV and RFF files@{ub}

@{jleft}

Assuming you have successfully extracted a CSV, TSV or RFF file from OBDATA.DAT and
loaded it into a suitable database/spreadsheet program, now there are some things
you should know before you change stuff.


Let's start with a list of the different columns you see, and what can/can not
be written in them:


	@{fg shine}Index@{fg text}

This is the object's logical placement in OBDATA.DAT. Do @{u}not@{uu} change
this number!


	@{fg shine}Name@{fg text}

The name of the object. This is for reference only, and will not be imported to
OBDATA.DAT.


@{b}NOTE:@{ub} If you use DB, both @{fg shine}Index@{fg text} and
@{fg shine}Name@{fg text} will be unchangable. (Another reason to download it.)


	@{fg shine}Damage@{fg text}

The amount of damage the ammo will cause. Must be between 0 and 255. Notice that
this is applicable for ammo types, grenades and laser weapons only. You should
@{u}not@{uu} try to change the damage amount for f.ex. the rifle.


	@{fg shine}Ammo@{fg text}

Potentially, each weapon in X-COM can use three types of ammo. @{fg shine}
Ammo1@{fg text}, @{fg shine}Ammo2@{fg text} and @{fg shine}Ammo3@{fg text}
 are the indexes of three ammo types that can be used. F.ex. the rocket launcher
(index 12) will use small, large and incendiary rockets. These are at index 13,
14 and 15, respectively. As a general rule, a weapon's ammo type(s) are on the
directly following place(s). The exceptions are gauss weapons in X-COM II, which
ammo types are at #47, 48 and 49. A value of 255 indicates that no ammo is
usable in that particular slot.


	@{fg shine}DmgType@{fg text}

This is the damage @{u}type@{uu} of the ammo. Valid types are:


	0	- Armour Piercing

	1	- Incendiary/Phosporous

	2	- High Explosive

	3	- Laser Beam/Gauss Beam

	4	- Plasma Beam/Sonic Beam

	5	- Stun/Freeze

	6	- Hand-To-Hand

	255	- NONE


	@{fg shine}Accauto/Accsnap/Accaimed@{fg text}

The accuracy of the different firing modes are expressed in % chance to hit the
target. This may exceed 100% and is also influenced by the operator's firing
accuracy.


	@{fg shine}TUAuto/TUSnap/TUAimed@{fg text}

This number is the % of the operator's total Time Units that will be required to
fire the weapon. If a value is 0, then the firing mode will not be available.
If a value exceeds 100, the operator will obviously never have enough TUs to
use that firing mode.


	@{fg shine}Rounds@{fg text}

This is the amount of rounds contained within one clip of the ammo type. For
HTH weapons (stun rod/thermal tazer, vibroblade, thermic lance and heavy thermic
lance) this is the amount of damage inflicted to the target.


That just about wraps it up for the things you can edit in the CSV/RFF files.
Also notice that you can delete unchanged equipment from the CSV/RFF file to
save space (and importing time).


Go to the @{"next section" link limits} to learn more about the limitations,
error handling and structures of the CSV/RFF files.


@endnode

@smartwrap
@{jcenter}@{b}Advanced information about the exported files@{ub}

@{jleft}

A lot of work (well, a couple of hours at least) has been invested to prevent
errors in the import files to slip through to OBDATA.DAT. ALL data is examined
very closely by the import routines before it is even read into memory. Then, to
be @{u}completely@{uu} sure, the values are checked again before they are
written to the copy of OBDATA.DAT that is in memory. If everything checks out
OK, the OBDATA.DAT file on the disk is finally overwritten.


Let's look at the whole process of importing CSV/RFF files in detail:


	First, the import file is read into memory. This is when the first error
checking takes place:

	- To determine the file's format, OBEdit reads the first line and then
searches it for a comma. If a comma is found, the file is regarded a CSV file.
If a comma is not found, the program checks if the line contains a tab stop. If
this is the case, then the file is regarded an RFF file. If neither a comma or a
tab stop is present in the first line, then the file format cannot be
determined, and the operation is aborted.

	- In the case of CSV files, the first line is ALWAYS skipped, regardless of
what it contains.

	- In the case of RFF and TSV files, the program will start reading from the first
occurence of a linefeed after a "\@" is encountered. (The RFF header always
starts with a "\@".) If an RFF header is not found, the program will skip the
first line only.

	- In any case, if a line is less than 20 characters long, it will be skipped.
This prevents empty lines (two consecutive linefeeds) from being treated as data
for object #0.

	- If multiple instances of the same object (matching indexes) are found, the LAST one
read will be imported.

	- If an index number is invalid (less than 0 or higher than 79), the program
will inform you about this, and skip the entire line. (No point in reading values
that you don't know where to put, is there?)

	- If any other data is out of range, the program will skip the object (line
in RFF/CSV file) and print it to the console with a helpful error message.
Specific data ranges are:


	- Damagage: 0 to 255

	- Ammo1/2/3: 0 to 79

	- DmgType: 0 to 6 or 255

	- AccAuto/Snap/Aimed: 0 to 255

	- TimeAuto/Snap/Aimed: 0 to 100

	- Rounds: 0 to 255


	- If a line has an incomplete or superfluous set of data (more or less than 14
comma- or tab separated values) the line will be skipped. In practice, this amounts to
checking if there are more or less than 13 commas or tab stops on the line. Two
consecutive commas or tab stops will make the value that was expected
between them be set to 0. This error is not reported, as it also allows comments
within the CSV/RFF files.


Now, there is just one more thing you should know about: the
@{"custom RFF header" link custhdr} feature.

@endnode
@node custhdr "Using custom RFF headers"
@smartwrap
@{jcenter}@{b}Using custom RFF headers@{ub}

@{jleft}

The procedure for exporting RFF files will look for a file called "OBEdit.hdr"
in the S: assign. This file should contain an appropriate RFF header to be
inserted in the exported file. If "S:OBEdit.hdr" is not found, an internal
default header is used.


The big advantage of this is to let you - the user - export RFF files with the
header of your choise. The recommended way to do this:


	- Export an RFF file from OBEDIT.DAT

	- Load the resulting RFF file into DB and use the "Edit design" menu command
to change the appearance of the window to your preference.

	- Save the RFF file and open it with a text editor (f.ex. CygnusEd).

	- Copy the RFF header (the line that starts with a "\@") and make a new file
that contains this header @{u}and one linefeed@{uu}. Save this file to
"S:obedit.hdr".

Just the basic facts:


On the west coast of an utterly insignificant country called "Norway", there is
an even more insignificant city called "Bergen". This is where I live. It rains
a lot here, and that's all there is to say about it, really.


Although this program is freeware, I figure there is a one-in-1200120120^1212
chance that somebody will actually send me a postcard, money, inflatable women
or anything else. So here's the adress:

OBEdit is FREEWARE. This means that you can copy it, use it and spread it around
as long as the original archive is intact. The Copyright remains with me,
however. Disassembling and changing the executable file is a complete waste of
time, since the source code can be downloaded from Aminet in the dev/e directory
anyway. (dev/e/obedit_src.lha)


The only thing I request for this program is that any bugs/errors are reported
to me as soon as possible. In other words: complaints are welcome!

v1.0: (15.05.99) Initial relase. Yay!

v1.1: (28.05.99) Minor upgrade.
	- Successfully implemented "$VER:" version string. (Finally got it working!)
	- Improved import-file exception handling. No longer aborts if procline() or
	  impvalues() encounter out-of-range data, but rather skips the object
	  (line in CSV/RFF file) entirely and prints it to the console.
	- Added the "Verbose" option just for the heck of it.
	- No bugs fixed because: no bugs found.

v1.2: (05.07.99) Minor upgrade.
	- Implemented short versions of most commands.
	- Added the 'exporttsv' argument to export TAB-separated ASCII files without
	  RFF headers.
	- Added the ability to scan exported files and report errors encountered in
	  them. Not terribly useful as such, since the import methods apply the same
	  comprehensive error checking routines. However, it provides a quick way of
	  comparing exported files without actually printing them out.
