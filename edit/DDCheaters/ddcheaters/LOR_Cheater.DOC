Lord Of The Realm Cheater V1.00 - By DARK DREAMS DESIGNS


- What is it!?
--------------

It's a saved game patcher...


- Requirements:
---------------

. An Amiga
. Lords Of The Realm
. LightWave 6.00 - (For a raytraced intro)
. At least 128Mb of Ram
. A hammer (it's always handy!)
  (Don't believe every thing you read...)


- What does it do?
------------------

The features are:

. Your bank account increses a little bit ;-)
. You'll have Iron, Stone and Wood in large quantities 
  (ONLY FOR PLAYER 1)


- How to work it?
-----------------

Select the directory where LOR is installed, then select the file you saved
(it should be *MYFILE*.SAV).

The program then loads the saved game, patches it and saves it.


- How to install?
-----------------

Just copy the icon into the directory you wish (I keep mine in the LOR directory)

And that's all...
