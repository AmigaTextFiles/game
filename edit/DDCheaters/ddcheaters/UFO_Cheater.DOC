UFO Cheater V1.00 - By DARK DREAMS DESIGNS


- What is it!?
--------------

It's a saved game patcher...


- Requirements:
---------------

. An Amiga 
. UFO (IT WILL NOT WORK WITH THE CD32/1200 VERSION)
. Half a pack of cigarrets
. A full tank of gas
. and of course, sun glasses!
  (Love those Blues Bros)


- What does it do?
------------------

The features are:

. All soldiers get their stats up to the limit
. All soldiers get Flying Suits ('cause the program as a BUG!)
. All soldiers that are injured get fit for duty
. Your bank account increses a little bit ;-)


- How to work it?
-----------------

Select the directory were UFO is installed and select one of the 10 save game
directories (They should be Game_01, Game_02,...).

The program then loads the saved game, patches it and saves it again.


- How to install?
-----------------

Just copy the icon into the directory you wish (I keep mine in UFO directory)
Et Voilá!!!
