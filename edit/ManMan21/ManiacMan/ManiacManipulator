@node OVER "ManiacManipulator Overview"

 short: with ManiacManipulator you can patch your saved games and get
        millions of credits...

 ManiacMan was made for the lazy people who don't want (or don't know
 how) to use a hex-editor like AZap, NewZap, Zaphod or similar.

 Imagine you play that rock-hard game and you're out of money again.
 Load ManiacMan and cheat your saved game. Life can be so easy...

 Since V2.0 ManiacMan now comes without an own GUI (Graphical User
 Interface). Instead of that AmigaGuide is used.


 WARNING!!!

 Make backups of your savegames before patching them for the first time.
 If one patch doesn't work (maybe you've got another version of the game)
 I don't want to receive any flames - they'll be ignored!

 WARNING!!!


 ManiacMan (the executable) is FREEWARE, so use and spread it like hell,
 but don't change the code or anything else.

 ManiacManipulator (the file you're reading) is SUPPORTWARE. If you like it
 and use it, please support it with sending either savegames or the Patches-
 file. If you decide to send savegames, please tell me how many money you've
 got in that game (else I can't find the adress where that value is stored).


@endnode

@node INST "ManiacManipulator Installation"

 Installation is easy, of course :)

 Move the ManiacMan-drawer wherever you want.

 That's it !


@endnode

@node USAG "ManiacManipulator Usage"

 After selecting the game you want to patch, a filerequester will appear,
 asking you for the file. Choose the savegame (often ends with .sav or
 can be found in a separate savegame-drawer) and all work will be done
 for you. Easy, isn't it?

 For those who want to write their own patches (everything is possible),
 I now made ManiacMan to be controlled by the commandline.

 For more information about that, start ManiacMan without options.


@endnode

@node CRED "ManiacManipulator Credits"

 Maniac Manipulator was written in ACE Basic V2.4 and compiled with
 PhxAss V4.34 using an Amiga1200 with OS3.1, 68040 CPU and 6MB RAM.

 Thanks to David Benn for ACE

@node HIST "History of the Maniac Manipulator"

 V0.9 - V1.3 ... Sorry, I forgot what changed from the very
                 beginning. Maybe this text will become bigger
                 as days go by ;)

 V1.4 .......... added thinpaz.font to the archive which was
                 missing in V1.3
                 added Speedball II patch
                 changed the guide

 V2.0 .......... totally recoded
                 added commandline-arguments
                 added user-defined memory-allocation
                 changed from 32bit to 8bit POKEing
                 GUI removed
                 lot of work :(

 V2.1 .......... added Hillsea Lido patch
                 added Oldtimer AGA patch
                 added Lords of the Realm AGA patch
                 added Theme Park AGA patch
                 added Christoph Kolumbus patch
                 added Whale's Voyage II patch

@node HILL "Hillsea Lido"

The savegames are stored in Hillsea Lido's -S- -drawer. The name is
xMSAV-3 where x is the save position (1MSAV-3 if you saved at position 1
by pressing F1).

@endnode

@node MECH "Mechforce"

This patch is for the full version. Robert Kawka told me that there are
different savegames. This one's for the single fighter saves (1032 bytes).

If you encounter problems, please contact Robert: roberto@santana.gun.de


@endnode

@node SWOS "Sensible World Of Soccer"

The parameter for the 95/96-version was taken from my old SWOSCheater.
I used to play in AGA mode and I don't know if there's a difference when
saving an ECS game...

Andreas Neumann told me that it doesn't work with his 96/97-version of
SWOS. He gave me the new parameter. It only differs 1 byte.

Please test which one works for you and let me know!

Savegames have the suffix .CAR


@endnode

@node SBII "Speedball II"

Speedball II saves a game to the bootblock of the savedisk. You'll have
to save the bootblock to a file (1024 bytes) to make use of this patch,
and write it back to the disk afterwards. There are many tools available
for this work (most virus-killers have an option to save the BB).

You might wonder why the money is 10240 Credits. Well, there was a little
problem of which I couldn't find the cause. But who cares? It works!


@endnode

@node UFOA "UFO - Enemy Unknown AGA"

This is for the old 4-disk-version of UFO. I don't think anything has
changed with the new 5-disk-version.

The file to alter is 'liglob.dat'
