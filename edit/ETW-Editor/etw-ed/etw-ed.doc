This is a MUI Editor for ETW Teams.

It's fairly complete and easy to use. 

It requires MUI 3.0 or better to work.

It's usage it's quite simply to use, the only thing to know is that
the "Strength" field in the Team Window can be used to initialize new
players/goalkeeper with an initial value in all their stats.

If you want to make a translation please edit the english.ct file
substituting english sentences with the ones in your native language.
