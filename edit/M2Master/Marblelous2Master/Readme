Short:    New Levels and Editor for Marblelous 2
Author:   frank.otto@gmx.de
Uploader: frank.otto@gmx.de
Type:     game/data

To install, copy the directories "MasterLevels" or "DemoLevels" to your
Marblelous-2-directory (you need the original Marblelous 2 on your hard drive)
and rename one of them to "Levels" to play it. Before you should rename the
original "Levels" directory to something else.

I also recommend to install these two new sound files: Sound/gun.iff and
Sound/shoot.iff to your sound directory.
     
The MasterLevels have two new items: The gun and the 'slimer' ghost. If you have
collected the gun, press the right Amiga key to shoot with the blue marble, right Alt
or Shift to shoot with the brown or yellow marble. The grey marble will shoot
immediately. Notice you can only shoot once. The shot will reflect on the walls so be
careful not to shoot yourself! If you've got a shield the shot won't hurt you.

To put the two new items in the editor when making new levels, select the object
editor and press "g" to set a gun and "s" to put one ghost.

And don't forget to upload your new levels to Aminet. Everybody who makes five or more
cool levels will get an original Amiga game from me!!  Mail Me!!!
