HISTORY

V1.20   -  Fixed a bug in the Object Attributes window: if you click
           "kill" gadget without any file, it crashes the machine.
        -  Added a string gadget in the Object Attributes window: now you
           can see the file name that you have selected.
        -  Lister interface completely rewritten.
        -  Dialog Editor now uses the new Lister in all situations.
        -  Now all ListView shows the selected item (OS3.0+ only).
        -  Now Editor and Game screens are attatched, so draggin/moving
           one will move also the second (OS3.0+ only).

        -  NEW TUTORIAL... try to talk with the "Black Hole" in the third
           screen!!!!

V1.11   -  Fixed a small bug in the Path Editor.
        -  Now the "current object" field is updated also when you 
           click on an object on the scene. (Before this fix, the object
