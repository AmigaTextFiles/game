Short:    Patch F1GP-Ed 3.41 to 3.43
Uploader: oliver.roberts@iname.com (Oliver Roberts)
Author:   oliver.roberts@iname.com (Oliver Roberts)
Requires: F1GP-Ed 3.41
Type:     game/misc

The supplied installer will update F1GP-Ed 3.41 to v3.43.  Note that you
MUST already have v3.41 installed somewhere.  Alternatively, you can
download the entire v3.43 archive.  This patch archive is mainly intended
for modem users (ie costs a lot less to download than the full v3.43
archive).

To patch F1GP-Ed, simply double-click on the "Patch_F1GP-Ed" icon and
follow the instructions.  The following files in the v3.41 installation
will be altered:

	F1GP-Ed
	Docs/F1GP-Ed_english.guide
	Docs/F1GP-Ed_deutsch.guide
	History.txt

For the patching to be successful the files above must be the original ones
released by me (ie unmodified).

The following files will be replaced completely:

	1998.f1gp
	1998.f1gp.events
