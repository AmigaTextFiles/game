There is a program that allows packing data files using RNC  algorithm  in
PPClone  directory.  Data file for English league and POOLPLYR.DAT must be
packed when saved to game, because SWOS will crash if  they're  not.  Read
more about ProPack Clone in SWOS Ed's guide.

ProPack Clone is written by Paul Qureshi. Please send  questions  relating
this program directly to him.

Paul let me include ProPack Clone with SWOS Ed archive, but he  said  that
he  doesn't want his program to be further distributed without my program.
So you are not allowed to copy ProPack Clone for anyone in other form than
only with the full SWOS Ed archive.

                                  *****

You'll find some nice NewIcons for SWOS Ed in NewIcons directory.  They're
drawn by Lucy/Philosophy. Thanks.
