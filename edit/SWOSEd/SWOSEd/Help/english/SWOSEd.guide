@node Introduction "Introduction to SWOS Ed"

  @{b}@{u}Introduction@{uu}@{ub}

  SWOS Ed is a team editor for Sensible World of Soccer, which is an
excellent soccer game.  I think it's the best soccer game with management
options available for any computer.  One of its main advantages is the
quantity of data, meaning the worldwide teams and players.  But some of them 
are way out of date.  For example in version 96/97 of SWOS, several names 
in the Polish data file are mispelled and others are just too old.  Some players 
are even in two different teams at once!  Unfortunately there's no team 
editor included with the game, but now using SWOS Ed you can edit your 
favourite team and change the abilities of all players etc.

  Main features of SWOS Ed:
    - It uses MUI (it's font sensitive and easy to use), and multitasks
      well.
    - Uses internal RNC depacking (SWOS data files are packed).  There's no
      need for an external utility to depack the files.
    - It is able to pack data files using ProPack or ProPack Clone (included).
    - It allows you to transfer players between teams and teams between leagues.
    - A multiple data file mode.
    - It is able to print teams' squads.
    - It has an excellent player search facility.
    - It allows you to change game's graphics using any paint program.
    - It's localized with many translations available.

@node Requirements "SWOS Ed Requirements"

  @{b}@{u}Requirements@{uu}@{ub}

  SWOS Ed should run on any Amiga with Kickstart 2.0+ with MUI 3.5 (or
newer) installed on the Workbench, and 1MB of memory.  But since I own a
better machine I can't say for sure.  I have tested my program on an
A1200/Kickstart 3.0/6MB of RAM and Blizzard 1240T-ERC board with MUI 3.8.

  Of course you also need a copy of "Sensible World of Soccer".

  SWOS Ed has been tested with SWOS 1.0, 1.1, 95/96, EC'96 and 96/97.

@node Installation "Installation on HD"

  @{b}@{u}Installation@{uu}@{ub}

  You can install SWOS Ed on your HD the easy way by using the supplied
installer script.  The Installer utility needs to be present somewhere in
your system path to run it.  Although it's not difficult to install SWOS Ed
manually.  All you need to do is, drag the program's icon into whatever
directory you prefer.  If you want to install this guide too, do the same
with the Help drawer.  If you don't, you won't be able to read it by
pressing the Help key.  Program translations are in the Catalogs directory,
so if you would like the ability to run SWOS Ed in different languages,
copy this directory as well.

  If you want to pack data files you should also install ProPack Clone
in your C: directory. SWOS Ed installer script asks whether you want to
do this and helps you in installing ProPack Clone.

@node Usage "How to use SWOS Ed"

  @{b}@{u}Usage@{uu}@{ub}

  @{u}Main Window@{uu}

  If you run SWOS Ed (by double clicking on its icon) the main window will
appear on the screen.  It's divided into three parts labelled:

  @{" File Section " LINK File}   @{" Team Section " LINK Team}   @{" Player Section " LINK Player}


  @{u}Menus@{uu}  

  The menus are divided into five groups called:

  @{" Program " LINK Program}   @{" Team " LINK TeamMenu}   @{" Player " LINK PlayerMenu}   @{" Special " LINK SpecialMenu}   @{" Settings " LINK Prefs}


  Please also read the @{"Important" LINK Important} section of this guide, before you start using
SWOS Ed.
@endnode

@node File "File Section"

  @{u}File Section@{uu}

  Using the "SWOS Data Path" gadget you need to specify the path to the
directory where the TEAM.???  files are stored.  For example if you
installed SWOS on your HD in the directory "Work:Games/SWOS", this string
gadget should contain "Work:Games/SWOS/data".  When you specify a correct
directory path SWOS Ed will automatically scan the data files in it and
display a list of countries found in the files.  You can then click on the
country which you want to edit and the data file will be loaded and
decrunched if necessary.  Below the list there are two very important
gadgets.  If you click on the first of them "Save to RAM:" SWOS Ed will
save the data file (with your modifications) to RAM:.  You can then copy it
to the proper directory manually.  Whereas "Save to Game" saves thr file in
the game's data directory and overwrites the original file.  So you don't
need to copy it to any other directory and can just start playing your new
updated SWOS.
@endnode

@node Team "Team Section"

  @{u}Team Section@{uu}

  This is where you can change the global team parameters.  First of all
you must select a team to edit.  After clicking on the popup gadget you'll
be able to select one from the list which appears.  If you change the
contents of the string gadget, this will change the actual name of the team
in the game.  Below this gadget you can change the coach's name, select the
default formation and the colour of the kits.  Everything should be fairly
straightforward except for the gadgets described below.

The "Pattern" gadget.  This specifies the appearance of the players shirts.
 Solid - means that whole shirt is Shirt 1 colour.
 Sleeves - the shirts are Shirt 1 colour with sleeves Shirt 2 colour.
 Vertical and horizontal stripes - the shirts have coloured stripes, using
                                   both Shirt colours obviously.

The "Division" gadget allows you to change the division which the team
plays in.  Please remember that you can't change the number of teams
playing in a division.  For example if you promote any team to a higher
division you must also relegate one team.  Otherwise SWOS will just crash
at the end of the season or even earlier.

The "Team Grid" gadget opens a separate window, which shows the team's
current formation and the positions of individual players on the pitch You
can change those positions using drag&drop, but the grid data is lost if
you change the number of any player.  Of course you can always set the grid
again.
@endnode

@node Player "Player Section"

  @{u}Player Section@{uu}

The player section is the part of the window where you can change the
individual players data. You can select which player to edit, change his
name, nationality, skin, hair, type and many other attributes. Note that
it's impossible to have a player with black skin and light hair. 
The value bar has a slightly different function depending on whether the
player being edited is a goalkeeper or not. When editing goalkeepers all 
his skills must be set to 1, and only the value itself affects how good a 
goalkeeper is. For all the other players their value is calculated in
real-time when you change the player's skills. You can't change the value
of a non-goalkeeper except by changing his skills.

@node Program "Program Menu"

  @{u}Program Menu@{uu}

    About     - Displays about requester.  Only for informational purposes.

    About MUI - Display info about MUI.

    Quit      - Guess what this does!  I'll let you into a secret, it
                doesn't format your hard drive...
@endnode

@node TeamMenu "Team Menu"

  @{u}Team Menu@{uu}

    Copy        - Copies the selected team's data to the internal team
                  clipboard.

    Paste       - Copies team data from the clipboard into the selected team.

    Exchange    - Exchange the contents of the clipboard with the selected 
                  team's data.

    Load        - Loads team data from a file (created using the Save option)
                  and replaces the current team with the loaded data.

    Save As     - Saves the current team's data to a file, which can be loaded
                  back in later using the Load option.

    Print Squad - Prints a squad list for the current team.
@endnode

@node PlayerMenu "Player Menu"

  @{u}Player Menu@{uu}

    Copy      - Copies the selected player's data to the internal player 
                clipboard.

    Paste     - Copies player data from the clipboard into the selected player.

    Exchange  - Exchange the contents of the clipboard with the selected 
                player's data.

    Search    - Searches for players who match skills set by the user. It opens
                a separate window titled "Search for Player".  In the "Name
                Pattern" gadget you can type an AmigaDOS pattern.  Only players
                whose names match with this pattern will be eventually found.
                For example if you type "#?R#?" you are asking the computer 
                for a list of players with letter "R" in the name.
                There are two listviews below "Name Pattern" gadget in the
                window.  You can select nationality and player type here.
                Entries marked with "+" are selected.  So if you want
                information about Polish goalkeepers, you must select "POL"
                and "G" and leave all the others unselected.  "Invert" button
                inverts the state of all entries in the listview, all
                selected entries become unselected and vice-versa.  There is
                also a group of gadgets on the right side of the window.
                You can set the minimum and maximum values for players' skills
                here.  Only players with every single skill between the min
                and max will be found.  For example, if you want information
                about reserves, set Number min at 12 and Number max at 16.
                Now just two more buttons.  "Search Memory" searches for
                specified players in the memory.  If multifile mode is not
                active it scans only the current league data, if multifile mode
                is active is scans all the leagues currently loaded into memory.
                "Search Files" searches for players in all the datafiles from
                the SWOS data path.  You can see a list of all found players
                in the "Search Report" listview, you can also clear this
                report using the "Clear Report" gadget.

    Find      - This option is very similar to the Search option.  It tries
    Duplicates  to find players with duplicate names in the same data files.
                For example you can check if any player is entered in the data
                files more than once.  If the "Only Surname" gadget is toggled
                on, players like "T.SMITH", "TOM SMITH" and "BEN SMITH" are
                treated as though they have exactly the same name.  "Check the
                Nationality" makes the program additionaly check the
                player's nationality.  The other gadgets and their functions are
                the same as for the "Search" option.

  @{u}Special Menu@{uu}

    Update Cup Teams - This option lets you update the teams playing in european
                       cups easily. Updating the cup teams is highly recommended,
                       because if you don't update them and start a career, the 
                       teams from abroad which you play against in the european
                       cups will still have their old squads. Just make the changes
                       to the squads in the national leagues and then select this
                       option. The old squads in the cup data files will be replaced 
                       by your newly updated ones. You will be warned if a file used
                       to update the cup teams is currently loaded into memory,
                       because if you save the file to disk after updating the teams
                       you'll have to update the data again. When updating the cups
                       SWOS Ed loads the data it requires from the data files on
                       disk and ignores and changes you may have made to the files
                       currently in memory. In the unregistered version of SWOS Ed
                       this option only updates the Champions League.

 Update POOLPLYR.DAT - This option lets you update the POOLPLYR.DAT file, which
                       contains the player's transfer list data. If you don't use
                       this option transfers may not work correctly and may cause
                       SWOS to crash. It's possible to use this option even in the
                       unregistered version of SWOS Ed, but you'll have to cancel
                       some "nervrequesters" which will appear during updating.
                       Warning!! You will need to repack POOLPLYR.DAT. Otherwise
                       SWOS will crash when you start your career.

    Convert Graphics - With this option you can now change the graphics in
                       the rest of the game.
                       First of all, you must set the proper SWOS grafs path.
                       For example, if SWOS is installed on your hard drive in
                       Work:Games/SWOS directory, you should type
                       Work:Games/SWOS/grafs in the box. Then the files which
                       contain the game's graphics will be displayed below.
                       When you select any file and click the "Convert RAM->ILBM"
                       gadget you'll be able to save that file in an IFF ILBM
                       format. Now load the file into Personal Paint or Deluxe
                       Paint etc, make any changes you want to the graphics and
                       save the modified picture as an ILBM file. 
                       If you are a registered user of SWOS Ed you can convert
                       the altered graphic file  back to RAW format. Just click
                       "Convert ILBM->RAW" and select your modified ILBM file.
                       You shouldn't change the size, colour depth or 
                       screenmode of the picture, because it won't let you
                       convert the file back to RAW if you do.
                       Any changes to the palette won't have any affect on
                       the game, since the colour information is stored in
                       the SWOS executable, not in the graphics data files.
                       
                       The graphic converter was tested with the 96/97 version
                       of SWOS and seems to work fine. You don't even have to
                       repack the data files.
@endnode

@node Prefs "Settings Menu"

  @{u}Settings Menu@{uu}

    Multifile Mode - This allows SWOS Ed to load several data files into memory
                     and switch between them without losing any changes.
                     When it is not set, changing the league causes the
                     data in memory to be deleted after loading another
                     league.  If multifile mode is activated when you change
                     leagues, data is not lost, but stored in memory.
                     So whenever you select that league again, the data won't
                     have to be loaded from disk again, but is recovered from 
                     memory and any changes you made will be kept intact.

    Graphics       - If you have an Amiga with Kickstart 3.0 you can show the
                     actual appearance of the kits while editing.  This option
                     will toggle it on and off.  For the colours to be
                     displayed correctly, you need to run SWOS Ed on a screen 
                     with at least 16 colours, preferably 32 if possible.

    Packing        - If you have the ProPack utility installed on your hard
                     disk as "C:ProPack" or you have ProPack Clone saved as
                     "C:PPClone", SWOS Ed is able to auto-pack data
                     files.  "None" means that no compression is used, "Size"
                     means that files are packed using an algorithm that
                     makes them as small as possible, "Speed" - files are
                     packed using an algorithm that makes them unpack
                     quicker.  Speed compression is used in SWOS 1.0 and
                     SWOS 1.1, Size compression is used in later versions
                     of the game.

    Interface      - "Pop-lists" sets the list of teams and players to appear
                     in normal pop-lists.  "Windows" puts the lists in seperate
                     windows which you can move and scale.  What's more, when
                     you select a team or player, the windows are updated.
                     It's much easier to use than "Pop-lists", when you just want
                     to change some skills or make a few transfers without major
                     editing of the data file.

    Save Prefs     - Saves the config file.  It stores information like paths,
                     current multifile mode status and interface mode status as
                     well.  It is pre-loaded whenever you use SWOS Ed.

    MUI Settings   - Calls MUI preferences program.  Changes which you made
                     to MUI configuration will only apply for SWOS Ed.

  SWOS Ed is shareware.  This means you can freely copy it, give it to your
friends etc.  But if you decide to use it, you have to send a small fee
to the @{"author" link Author}.  You are not allowed to modify any file or reassemble the
executables.

  SWOS Ed is a @{"MUI" LINK MUI} application.  @{"MUI" LINK MUI} is copyrighted 1992-96 by Stefan
Stuntz.

  SWOS Ed has been tested for a while and found to be stable in everyday
use.  However the author is not responsible for any loss of data, damages
to software or hardware that may result directly or indirectly from the use
of this program.

  I've worked on developing SWOS Ed for a long time now and I have to spend
a lot of time working on SWOS Ed's sources when I want to improve anything.  
As you can probably understand, I would like some reward for all this work.  
If you find my program useful and you like using it, please register.
The unregistered version has some of the new options disabled and displays 
a shareware reminder when you start the program, which forces you to wait
about 20 seconds.  Please try to be understanding, I dream of PPC board
for my A1200...

  First of all, if you live in Poland it is much easier to register than
all those people who live in other countries.  Read the Polish version of 
SWOSEd.guide for details.  All non-Poles, please, read below for how to
register.

  I feel that the registration fee is not very high.  Earlier versions of 
SWOS Ed were postcardware and those people, who sent me a postcard before 
20th of March 1997 pay even less.

       Currency                                 For people who registered
 (only these from the                            postcardware version of
  list are supported)        "Standard" fee      SWOS Ed before 20.3.97.

  DM  (Germany)                  20 DM                   10 DM


  I suggest that the best way of sending the money is to put bank notes (no
coins!) between two blank pieces of paper (to avoid it being seen) in the
envelope together with the registration form.  If you don't have an e-mail
address, please include an envelope addressed to you and postage stamps for
your letter.  I'll send you the registration number anyway, but you'll get
it faster if you remember to include these things.  I'm not responsible if 
your money is lost in the post.  If you are worried about sending money 
through the post, try to use postal services which allow you to get your 
money refunded if it is lost.

  You should get your registration number in one to eight weeks.
Otherwise, please contact me, and we'll try figure out what was wrong.  If 
you have an e-mail address and type it into the registration form this will 
greatly speed up the process of sending out a registration number to you.

  Spreading of your registration number is not allowed.  Your number will 
be disabled in the next versions of SWOS Ed if I learn that you gave it to 
anyone.

  The unregistered version of SWOS Ed has some limitations:
    - There is a shareware reminder that opens when you start the program.
      It freezes SWOS Ed for 20 seconds.
    - The Player/Find Duplicates and Settings/Interface/Windows menu options
      are disabled.
    - The Special/Update Cup Teams option is limited to the Champions League.
      You can't update teams in the Cup Winners Cup or UEFA Cup.
    - There is a "nervrequest" you must cancel when updating POOLPLYR.DAT.
    - The Special/Convert Graphics option can convert RAW format to ILBM
      (so you can see that you are able to edit the game's graphics using any

@node Notes "SWOS Ed Notes"

  @{b}@{u}Notes@{uu}@{ub}

  The main parts of SWOS Ed are written in C, but there are also routines
written in assembler for better performance. It took me about 10 days to
write the first version of this program and was only possible because MUI
handles all the user input, so I had a lot less work to do than if I had
used gadtools.library. To create the window design I used MUI Builder 2.2.
By now of course, the SWOS Ed source files have changed completely since
the first release. The complete source takes up 283KB and it's stored in
11 modules.

  Whilst sitting in front of the keyboard and monitor, I listened to the
tape "Elf" by Varius Manx.  So you could say their music motivated me to
work!

  I would like to thank some people. First of all, thanks to Piotr Cieniak.
He's my friend from class and suggested that I write a SWOS team editor in
the first place. My greetings also go to all girls that I know. If I
didn't know them, my life would be a mere shadow of what it is now.

  Thanks to Jeff Crawford for being one of the first users of SWOS Ed and
for correcting this guide.  Now it resembles the English language a lot more
than it did to start with.

  Thanks also to Russell Eyre for being the first person who sent me a
postcard and to David Chan for being the first to send a registration fee.

  Thanks go to Aitortxu Garcia (RiPP/GoBLinS) for helping with the data file 
format research. Thanks to him the data files saved by SWOS Ed are more compatible 
with the original ones.

  And one more person to thank him. It's Paul Qureshi, author of ProPack Clone,
who solved the problem of repacking data files.

  I also send greetings to all my friends.

@node Important "Important"

  @{b}@{u}Important@{uu}@{ub}

  SWOS Ed versions 1.4 and above allow the editing of cup teams.  But this option 
has several limitations.  To avoid creating problems for yourself, read these 
instructions carefully.

  You must not:
    - Exchange cup teams.
    - Paste a team from one league into a cup team from another league.

  You may:
    - Update cup teams' squads.  You can even use the team clipboard to do this.
    - Replace a cup team with another team from the same league, but first you 
      must exchange these two teams in their league data file.

  The safest way of updating cup teams is to change squads in national leagues'
files and then use Special/Update Cup Teams option from the menu.

  The team clipboard routines were rewritten in SWOS Ed 1.4 to make them more
useful, but the previous routines were safer.  So please only use the team 
clipboard if you really need it.  This only applies to the @{b}team@{ub} clipboard,  
You can use the player clipboard without any restrictions.


  If you don't want SWOS to crash you must not:
    - Change the number of teams which play in a division. SWOS Ed 1.8 checks 
      for this before saving a file and won't let you save the file if you do.
    - Modify cup teams and break the rules described above.
    - Save the English data file and POOLPLYR.DAT in unpacked form to the game.
      When unpacked these files are too large for SWOS and the game crashes
      when it tries to load them.

  If you don't want SWOS to crash you must:
    - Save all your modfified data files to the game and then update the cup 
      teams and POOLPLYR.DAT (using Update Cup Teams and Update POOLPLYR.DAT
      from the Special menu).
    - Load all your previous updated files, edited with a version of SWOSEd older 
      than 1.8, into SWOS Ed 1.8 and save them to diskthe game (you don't need to 
      modify anything just save them using the newer version).
      Warning!! These old updates must have the correct number of teams in all
      divisions. Otherwise SWOS will still crash.

@node History "SWOS Ed History"

  @{b}@{u}History@{uu}@{ub}

      Version 1.0 (17.1.96) - Initial release.

      Version 1.1  (5.3.96)
        - Support for SWOS 95/96 data files.
        - The ability to transfer players between teams.
        - The ability to transfer teams between countries.
        - Multifile mode added.  You can load several leagues into memory
          at once and switch between them without losing any changes.
        - Config file which stores your SWOS data path and multifile state.
        - GUI redesigned a little (bugfixed).
        - Many changes in internal program structure which users will
          probably never notice.  Now the program is really object
          oriented.
        - Improved documentation.

      Version 1.2  (2.4.96)
        - GUI significantly redesigned.
        - Localization added.  English, Polish and Dutch languages available.
        - Player's numbers editing added.
        - Sorting of players when saving files added.  Players of different
          types are not mixed after loading into SWOS.
        - Small bugfix when loading the same file from different paths.

      Version 1.3  (7.6.96)
        - GUI creation rewritten, now the program works better with MUI v3.
        - Graphic representation of kits added (OS3 required).
        - Packing of files using ProPack added (you need ProPack utility of
          course).
        - Norwegian and German translations added.

      Version 1.4 (4.8.96)
        - Loading and Saving individual teams.
        - The ability to edit cup teams added.  But it has many limitations
          (please, read the @{"Important" LINK Important} section of this guide).
        - Printing the teams' squads.
        - Players searching option added.
        - Team clipboard routines rewritten.  Now you are able to change
          the team's division, using Team Copy/Paste/Exchange.
        - Dynamic Object Linking added.  All GUI elements are created only
          when really needed, so they take up less RAM than before.
        - Many changes in the GUI.  An especially significant change in the 
          players list.
        - Small bugfixes.  Sometimes SWOS Ed didn't free all the allocated
          memory.
        - German translation added.

      Version 1.5 (29.10.96)
        - Team grid editing added.
        - Now you can change the division the team is in by just clicking on
          one gadget.
        - Internal changes.

      Version 1.6 (15.3.97)
        - Registration number decoding and a shareware reminder added.
        - Find Duplicate players option added. (reg. only)
        - Now you can have the list of teams and players in normal windows,
          which can be individually moved, scaled etc. This is very useful
          if you often operate on different teams and players. (reg. only)
        - If you select Search in the files option and any of the files are
          missing from the SWOS data path, you can stop the search now.
        - Some small bugfixes. This version is more "stable" compared to the
          previous version.

      Version 1.61 (26.8.97)
        - SWOS Ed 1.6 and ProPack crashed on 040 and 060 processors which had 
          data caches enabled. So now SWOS Ed 1.61 clears caches when needed 
          and temporarily disables them before calling ProPack.

      Version 1.62 (20.9.97)
        - Major changes to the routines responsible for displaying the team's 
          kit graphics. The remapping routine was rewritten in assembler, so 
          it's about two times faster than before. The new routine requires less
          data to do exactly the same job as the previous version did, making 
          the executable about 6KB smaller. Bitmap manipulations are now done in 
          a more OS friendly way.
        - Changes to built-in English strings. For example the "Find the Same"
          option was renamed to "Find Duplicates".

      Version 1.7 (25.11.97)
        - Now you can change any of the game's graphics using SWOS Ed and any
          paint program, (eg. Personal Paint, Deluxe Paint or Brilliance). 
          SWOS Ed converts the graphics data between the internal format of SWOS
          (RAW) and the IFF ILBM format readable by almost all graphics utilities.
          (this option is fully functional in the registered version only)
        - You can easily update cup teams using the Special/Update Cup Teams 
          option. It should solve the majority of crash problems experienced when 
          updating cup teams. (fully functional in registered version only)
        - The division which the team is from is displayed in the teams list.
          There is no need to select a team to show this information now.

      Version 1.8 (16.1.98)
        - A better and SWOS compatible way of setting the player's value.
        - You can update the POOLPLYR.DAT file now (fully functional in registered
          version only).
        - SWOS Ed checks the number of teams playing in divisions. If you have changed
          the number in a division (you're not allowed to do this), SWOS Ed won't let 
          you save the file.
        - Smaller changes, which should improve the compatibility of data created by
          SWOS Ed with original the SWOS' data. Now SWOS shouldn't crash at all
          (as long as you don't break the rules described in this guide).

      Version 1.81 (14.6.98)
        - SWOS Ed will confirm if the file is saved successfully.
        - Now program asks if you really want to quit SWOS Ed. This means no
          more looses of data.
        - Useful information is stored in data file's comments.

      Version 1.85 (10.2.99)
        - SWOS Ed executable changed a little to make using ProPack Clone
          by Paul Qureshi for repacking data files possible.
        - Changed installer script. Now it asks whether to install
          ProPack Clone.

  Most of improvements discussed below will probably only be available in
the registered version of SWOS Ed.  But some of them (for example bug fixes)
will be added to the unregistered version as well.

  I think that it would be nice to translate SWOS Ed into more languages.
If anyone feels like translating the strings displayed in the program and
it's accompanying documentation, to any other language, please get in touch

@node Problems "Problems with SWOS Ed"

  @{b}@{u}Common problems@{uu}@{ub}

  Q: What is MUI and why can't I run SWOS Ed without it?

  A: MUI is a system to generate good looking, font sensitive and easy to use
     graphical user interfaces.  I think that every Amigan should use it!  
     You can download util/libs/mui38usr.lha from Aminet.  For a more
     detailed description of MUI, see the @{"MUI" LINK MUI} section of this guide.


  Q: I have the floppy version of SWOS.  How can I install it on a HD?  My
     problem is that when I try to save an unpacked data file produced by 
     SWOS Ed, the disk is too full.

  A: Just install ProPack Clone and repack data files.  This should solve
     all problems. But if there is a reason that you don't want to do it,
     you can also solve the problem as follows.

     My SWOS HD installer should be available on Aminet as swoshd.lha in
     game/patch.  If you don't have a hard  disk  (why not ???) you could  
     make enough room by deleting the following files from SWOS disk 2:  

     TEAM.080, TEAM.081, TEAM.082, TEAM.083, TEAM.084, TEAM.085.  

     These files contain the international data, so if you delete them you
     won't be able to play the world cup for example.


  Q: When I try to edit the English teams or I update POOLPLYR.DAT file it
     makes SWOS crash. What can I do to get around this?

  A: The English league data file is the largest and when it's unpacked it's
     about three times bigger!  That's the reason that the game crashes.  The 
     unpacked file is larger than SWOS's internal buffer and the game can't 
     load it properly.  The same problem occurs with POOLPLYR.DAT file. To make
     the game work properly, you have to repack the file using an external packer
     program like ProPack or ProPack Clone.  Everything will then work fine.


  Q: What can I do to encourage the author to write updated versions of SWOS Ed?

  A: It's very simple.  First of all register, then send him a nice postcard,
     suggestions, accelerator boards for his A1200, millions of dollars,
     a few expensive cars etc.


  Please also read @{"Important" LINK Important} section of this guide.

@node PPClone "ProPack Clone and its author"

  @{b}@{u}What is ProPack Clone?@{uu}@{ub}

ProPack Clone (PPClone) is a program that can compress files in a format
compatable with ProPack, a compressor written by Rob Northern Computing. This
packer was used on many commercial games for a number of years, SWOS being
one of the last.

Since the last version was dated 1993 and there does not seem to be a legal
way to obtain this program any more, I decided to write my own clone of it. I
did this for the sole purpose of letting people edit their SWOS data files,
as I know many people (my self included) regard this game as the best
football simulation ever and it is a shame not to have the latest teams for
it.

Therefore, I decided that I should release PPClone with Piotr Bieniek as part
of this exellent SWOS Ed package.

Please note that I am in no way trying to make any finantial gain from
PPClone, nor do I wish it be used for any purpose other than compressing SWOS
data files. There are much better packers in the public domain these days, so
there should be no reason to use PPClone for anything else.

  @{b}@{u}Copyright notice@{uu}@{ub}

PPClone is (C) 1999 Paul Qureshi. It is free, but may only be distributed
with the complete SWOS Ed package by Piotr Bieniek. It may only be used
for compressing edited data files for use with an original (not pirated)
version of SWOS.

Piotr and I take no responsability for anything this program might do,
harmful or otherwise. However, it should work without problems.

  @{b}@{u}About the author@{uu}@{ub}

  @{b}@{u}Paul's look on Amiga and piracy@{uu}@{ub}

First PPC Quake was uploaded to the Aminet. My favorite game is now basically
dead on the Amiga because someone decided to pirate it.

Then, Shadow Of The Third Moon 2 was cancelled because of low sales figures
due to piracy (20,000 copies sold worldwide).

I really makes me sad that there are still people, who after all the Amiga
has been through still pirate software. Anyone with a machine capable
of running Quake at a decent must surely love their Amiga to have spent so
much money on it. Why is it that these poeple can't pay for their software
but instaed have to kill that Amiga.

I hope everyone who uses PPClone has an original copy of SWOS.

Piracy on the Amiga - Please, just don't do it.
