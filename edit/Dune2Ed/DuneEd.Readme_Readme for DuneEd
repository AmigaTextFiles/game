DuneEd - (c)1996, Michael Foreman

Not really a long doc...:-)

Not really a short one either...:-(

** Please read disclaimer at bottom of document. :-)

If you have only a 1MB amiga, you'll probably have to quit DuneII to run this
program.  It IS only programmed in blitz and seems to insist on being at least
50 kb long; how much of that actually resides IN memory when run, I don't know.

To use:

1)  Load DuneII, play it.
2)  When you run out of money, save the game. Remember what you call it.
3)  Goto the mentat screen and select something...doesn't matter what.
4)  Press <L-Amiga>-<N> to bring workbench to the front.
5)  Run DuneEd.
6)  When asked, find the directory you run DuneII from (or a save disk),
    using the (sad) file requester.  Ignore the CD button.
7)  You will then be asked for the name of the saved game. Enter it.
8)  Read the message.
9)  DuneEd will now quit.
10) If you are short on memory, close all the windows before 11)
11) Press <L-Amiga>-<M> until the mentat screen comes up.
12) Return to the game and reload the save game.
14) (I'm superstitious) Look at all the money!!!

Note: I can't be bothered to search for the maximum value of spice a silo can
      hold, so if you only have 3 silos, DuneEd will fill them up and the rest
      of the spice will be lost.

With this wonderful program you can now easily win DuneII using all three
of the great houses.

I doubt this program will ever be that popular but if I get anymore than
say...15 responses I might hack around a bit more, increase tank armour,
weapon power, etc..  Don't expect anything though, I won't.

If you really like this program, i.e. it has saved you from committing
suicide, etc. please feel free to send me money, computers (NOT P.C.s!!!!),
hot women, sports cars, winning lottery tickets, etc..

Other programs to look out for...


Ponga - Pong tennis clone by me (bit crap actually but quite fun!).

ScaleConv - A scale converter written in pascal.  Converts all measurements
             of a the same type to othe scales. (time - seconds -> minutes).
            Covers time, distance (metres furlongs, Nautical Miles, hands, etc),
             speed (mph, kph, knots, etc.), I'm sure you get the idea.
            (By me)

ClockWobble - You set an alarm and the screen wobbles a bit. (Crap really)
               (By me)

F1GP-ED - Wonderful editor for MicroProse F1GP, by Oliver Roberts.
          Get it, it's brilliant...then register it and it's even more fun!


... I also write programs for the Acorn archimedes range (RISC OS3.1 +)
    so if ya want any, contact me and I'll gave ya details ...

Now a request from a friend...

To join CFSFC just E-Mail Mike and ask, he'll send you the logo which
should be included in any CFSFC program you do.

The advantage is, if you have any problems, you have a whole team ready
to help you out!!

CFSFC is already rife in the Acorn world (we deny ALL PC users!!).
Join and get recognition as well as getting your programs spread far and wide!!

Greetings to Sparky of CFSFC, Herman of CFSFC and umm, that's it.
