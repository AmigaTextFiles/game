@node "Install" "Install"
Install:
--------
 - No big deal, just put the editor where you'd like it, you can copy this
   doc if you like it...
 - The Editor is all contained in one file, no external files is needed..
@endnode

@node "requ" "It needs"

   the editor-principle)

@endnode

@node "Load" "Loading A Game"
 Load a save-game
 ----------------
 When entering the startup-screen select 'load' and choose your saved game

 The editor checks the file, and will return to the startup-screen if it's
 not a valid save-game.

@endnode

@node PERS "Changing the Personal Status"

 Activating the 'personal' button takes you to the personal status..

 I think the options explain themselve...

 NOTES:
  - Don't set your reputaion to high, if you do the game will overflow,  and
    you'll get a very low rating.
  - Although you can select a bride, you should  rather  choose  to  improve
    your ranks and finding a bride yourselve.
  - The bride selected here is ONLY relevant when calculating the points  of
    the game.

@endnode

@node PART "Changing the Party Status"

 Activate the 'party' button to get here..

 Options are simple, just explore 'em..

 NOTES:
  - It's possible to place your party in an enemy town..
  - If you want to change the city, then you should  save  the  game  BEFORE
    visiting the tavren or govenour, else you won't  be  able  to  go  those
    places in the new town..
  - If you'd like more ships, then you must first change the number of ships
    before you can choose the ships.
  - A 'fast-galleon' can be chosen as ship, but as far as  I  can  tell  the
    game changes it to a 'pinnace' when choosing to fight in it..

@endnode

@node MAPS "Changing Maps"

 Activate the 'maps' button to get here..

 There's 3 maps, one for treasure, one for family and the last for big gold.

 CI             = Showing the city-name near-by
 UR, UL, BL, BR = Sections of map shown

 Clicking on the location will bring up a  list  of  standard-locations  for
 treasures, I've done that as I can't see if a location is on land..

@endnode

@node CITY "Changing Cities"

 Activate the 'cities' button to get here..

 Click on a city to change options for it

 Fort = Number of forts in city
 Sol. = Number of soldiers in city
 Pup. = Number of people in city

 NOTES:
  - Most of these values is rounded to various hole numbers.
  - Pirates uses a special char-map, so some names looks strange.

@endnode

@node NATI "Changing Nations"

 Activate the 'nations' button to get here.

 Ok, changing nations is not quite right, this is currently just a way to
 alter which countries is in war, and wich are allied..
