@title "XPilot Ship Builder (C)1996 Iain King"

      Just started University - got onto a Unix workstation - and found one
of the best games ever - XPilot.  Its like Gravity Power (Gravity Force 2),
and although GP is the best game of its type on the Amiga (believe me - Ive
tried them all), it pails compared to XPilot.  XPilot has more options - and
if youve ever played GP youll know what this means.  For a start you can
even make youre own ship to fly in XPilot.  This I did.  But I found having
to draw out grids on paper was boring and time consuming, and as I couldnt
get the program to make ships in Unix to compile (In the world of Unix you
more than not download the actual source code for a program and then comple
it yourself - fun eh?), I decided to make my own.  So here it is.  If you
want to use it (If you have access to a Unix machine in other words) then
youll have to save your ships onto disk and port them over to unix -
CrossDOS should allow you to do this.

   NOTE!  This is a far from finished version - it barely works.  There are
many bugs (too many) and some features dont work very well (some dont work
period).  It shouldnt damage youre equipment but I cant be held responsible
if it does. Sorry. Ive only released it to get a response - it works - OK
its usable by me - so I dont need (and cant be bothered) to improve it.  But
if other people happen to have an Amiga and have access to a Unix box and
XPilot and would like me to do more and they email me at given address and I
get enough responses (1 would probably be enough) then I might be bothered
again.  hmmm

   If you cant access Unix then theres not much point using this unless you
just  want to mess around and make up space ships.  Hehe

   I suppose I'd better write a disclaimer. (Just to make sure you got it!)

  I will not be held responsible for any damage caused by this program.
This program is FreeWare.  Anybody who tries to sell it will get a visit
from Da Boys (I have contacts).
It can be distributed freely as long it is distributed completely. I.E.
      Files should be :

         Shipbuilder
         ShipBuilder.info   (You make a better one if you want)
         ShipBuilder.guide
         ShipBuilder.guide.info

   If you don't get these files then send for Da Boys.

                                    Iain King  (iking@cs.strath.ac.uk)

        N.B.  Sorry for being crap at writing docs.

@node EDIT
@title "The Editor"

   The Editor is the main window you see when you run ShipBuilder.  It is
composed of a grid on the right, a row of buttons down the left, and a small
status area below the grid.  Everything you need to design a ship can be
accessed from the Editor.  Ill go through the functions vaguely in order,
starting from the grid.

   The grid is the representation of the ship.  Its what the ship looks like
in the game (scaled up).  The first time you run ShipBuilder you should see
a grid (probably red), with a triangle on it, along with a red circle on the
left and a blue one on the right.  Forget about the circles just now.  The
triangle you see is the ship.  These are the lines visible in the game.  The
bottom left to lines are black, but the top right one is the same colour as
your window.  This is because this is the currently selected line.  You
select lines by clicking on points on the ship.  These are the joints of the
lines, and are coloured white.  Click on the bottom left point with the
mouse.  The highlight should now be on the bottom right line.  As well as
this you should see that the blue circle has changed position.  This blue
circle highlights the currently selected point.  Experiment by clicking on
the other points, then return to the bottom left point.   NOTE - just hit
the mouse button and release - do not hold it down.  Now we will make a
different shape.  Notice the row of buttons down the left - these are the
different things you can do to tailor your ship.  To start with (making sure
the bottom left point is selected) we will hit Add Point (the top button).
Now go over to the bottom right region of the grid and click anywhere.  A
new pint has been added, placed at the end of the highlighted line.  We will
be boring and make a square ship.  Grab hold of the new point (by holding
down the mouse button on top of it), and drag it over to the bottom right
corner of the grid, then release the mouse button.  Repeat for the
right-middle point, dragging it to the top right.  And thats basically it -
this is how you make a ship.  If you want to get rid of a point then click on
Del Point - the currently selected point will be deleted
NOTE : there is a max of 24 points, and a min of 3.

   Below the grid are a few numbers in brackets - these are coordinates.
The grid is a square from -15,-15 to 15,15.  The ship will rotate around the
origin.
   The left hand coords (in square [] brackets) are the coords of the
currently selected points.  The right hand coords (in rouund () brackets)
are the location of the mouse pointer on the grid (these change when the
mouse button is held down over the grid.

   What about the red circle?  Well, every ship has to have an engine, and
this is it.  To position it, click on Engine Pos, then the correct location
on the grid - bingo.

   The same aplies to the Main gun, denoted on the grid by a blue square
(its currently at 15,0).  Click on Main Gun to change it pos.  Clicking on
Left Gun allows you to add the location of the left gun (if omitted it
defaults to the Main Gun coords).  Hit the button then a location on the
grid.  hitting the button again removes the left gun.  Same for Right Gun,
as well as Left Blip and Right Blip (These are small red and blue landing
lights which blink on-off in the game)  Add Rack and Del Rack work in the
same way as Add and Del Point.  A max of 4 missile racks can be added, if
left out the missile launch from the main gun.

         Object          |     Representation
         -----------------------------------------------------------------
         Engine          |  Grid coloured circle, outlined by point colour
         Main gun        |  Blue Square
         Left/Right gun  |  Black square
         Left/Right blip |  small black outline circle
         Racks           |  Window coloured rectangle


NB these colours are from my colour palette and may differ from yours.

@title "Project menu"

   The Project menu.

      Load/Save Raw

         These options allow you to load and save your ships in a compact
file.  Note! these files are useless for the game and are only for working
with in the editor.

      Generate shipShape

   This option allows you to generate a shipShape file for use with XPilot.
   A small window pops up with Author and Ship name, (click in the boxes to
change), and two buttons - "Create New" and "Add to file".  Create new will
generate a completely new ship, while add to file allows you to tack this
ship onto a larger shipShape file.  Hitting the window close gadget cancels
the action

      Import shipShape

         This allows you to load in a file stored as a shipShape, but

   ******* DOES NOT WORK YET!!!   ********


      Save config will save the current options into the config file :

         S:XpilotEd.config

      This saves all your current options, as well as the ship and author
names as defaults

       Clear

   Clears the ship back to the default Dart, but...

   ******Does bugger all just now!!!!*****

      Info

   Allows you to change the name of the ship and the author name.

      About

   Info about me, but..
   ***** Im sure you know what I mean ******

      Quit

      Ermmmmm....

@title "Options menu"

      Options menu:

         Show extras:

            This toggles whether everything except the basic ship (I.E. the
lines) is displayed or not.

         Highlight Start/Line/Current

            Toggles whether the starting point of the ship is circled,
                    whether the current line is highlighted,
                    whether the current point is circled

         Symmetry

            Toggles the symmetry option.  When symmetry is on every point is
mirrored along the x axis.

         Grid

            Toggles whether or not the grid is displayed

         Extra grid lines

            Toggles the extra grid lines - the axis, and a square and circle
of size 8 (see Xpilot docs to understand)

         Colour Scheme

            If you prefer white lines instead of black then hit this.
            Later this will allow you to decide the colours of all the
            extras.

         View mode

            sets the options so that you can see youre ship in all its glory

         Default

            resets the options to defaults.

@node BUGS
@title "Bugs?"

   To many to name,  but here are a few hints:

         The program does not check if your extras are actually sitting on a
line - they have to be in Xpilot

         When using symmetry, add all the points you need first as it dont
work very well.
