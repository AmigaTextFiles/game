@node "Why" "Why, Who and HOW"

Why:
----

 Well I tried to make some levels with the original editor, but I quickly ran
 into  a  bunch  of  errors, besides it was almost imposible to find out what
 options that realy was.. Then I found the source-code  on  a  cover-cd  from
 Amiga Format, so I started to study it and this is the result of that work.


Who:
----
 You can contact me:

                      EMail:      top_cat@post8.tele.dk



How:
----
 This Editor was written using:
   - AMOS Pro      2.00
   - Turbo +       2.00
   - Craft         1.00
   - Easylife      1.10
   - DOOM music    2.00
   - Locale        0.26
   - OS DEVkit     1.61
   - Tools         1.01
   - AMCAF         1.50

   - GoldEd        4.7.2 (With Guide-env-add-on)
   - CatEdit       1.20
   - PPaint        7.0
   - Dopus         5.5


 I would like to pay my respects to the folowing  persons,  without  them  it
 would be imposible to make something like this....

@node req "You'll need"
 The Editor should run on WB2.0 with 4 Mb of RAM, however the  game  requires
 AGA  so  I don't suspect anyone to try and run it on anything older than 3.0
 anyway. It runs on all processors known to  me,  however  030/50  is  highly
 recomended.. The Editor supports locale with KS2.1+.. Please note  that  the
 'new' converters NEEDS AGA and OS 3.0 (with datatypes) to operate...


 The editor relies on several external programs and filez:
 (if you'd installed the original editor + the patch,  the most of  the files
 should be in the right order)

 You'll always need:
  - 'Endcli'  command in your path
  - 'FailAt'  command in your path
  - 'Execute' command in your path
  - 'Delete'  command in your path
  - 'Copy'    command in 'C:'
  - 'T:'      assigned to a directory somewhere
 With a normal WB installed these should not pose a problem

  - 'SBDepack' must be in 'C:' if you want to load packed files..

 The editor needs the folowing on startup:
  - 'Ab3:'                   assigned
  - 'Easylife.Library'       Libs: or path.
  - 'Asl.Library'            Libs: or path
  - 'Gadtools.Library'       Libs: or path (is in ROM for 3.0+)
  - 'Ab3:Includes/test.lnk'  Datafile
  - It needs the files and directories pointed by the 'test.lnk' file too...

 !! If 'Ab3:' isn't set then the editor will try and set it to the current
 directory (The catalog where the editor itselve is located)


 To use the 'pack files' options you'll need
  - the 'Lha3'    program  in 'C:' (Normal)
  - the 'Lhaconv' program  in 'C:' (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
 As standard the 'lhaconv' program is placed in 'S:', however I can't get the
 scripts to work allright with that position.

@node INST "How to Install the Editor"
 Intalling the editor
 --------------------

 I dind't had time to  write  an  install-program,  but  if  you've  got  the
 'original' editor, you've proberly  had  to  use  either  the  shell  or  an
 directory utility to get it running anyway..

 The editor should be installed 'on top' of the old editor to work  best,  an
 alternative is to install on top of the  game  itselve,  thereby  using  the
 original GFX and data files..

 To install:
    Set an assing to 'Ab3:', if you've used the old editor it'll be there..

 That should do it..

 NOTES:
  - If you don't assign 'Ab3:', then the editor  will try and make the assign
    to the directory where the editor itselve is located..

  - The content of the drawer 'C' may be moved to C:, or it should be in  the
    editor's directory.

  - The catalogs can be moved to 'locale:' if you'd like, but it  works  from
    the editorpath as well..

@node TOOL "Supported tooltypes...."
 @{b}@{u}TOOLTYPES@{uu}@{ub} (*NEW in V2.12)

 Tool types is a very convinient way of sending  information  to  a  program,
 they  are set by clicking once on the icon, and then select information from
 the WB menu. Tooltypes can be deactivated by putting () around them..

 The editor supports some tooltypes set  in  the  icon  of  the  editor,  the
 supported ones is as folows, defaults is shown in []..


 @{u}HELP=[LevelED_301.guide]@{uu} (*New in V2.12)
  Should point to an amigaguide file that holds helping texts for the  editor
  this file will be loaded when the user presses help. Normal procedure is to
  point it to this guide. But this option is open in case you'd like  another
  guide (perhaps in another tounge..)

  !! If no path is specified, the editor will  seek  the  file  in  the  same
  directory as the program itselve.. !!

  (This option can be changed from the menu in the editor..)

 @{u}MUSIC=FILE@{uu} [NONE] (*NEW in V2.15)
  Plays  the  selected  musicmodule  (PT)  on  startup,  the  module  may  be
  AB3DII-packed if you like..

 @{u}OldSM@{uu} (*NEW in V3.00)
  Makes the editor open  on  a  Hires-NOlace  screen,  just  like  the  older
  versions. The screen will still be  an  intuition-screen,  and  the  colour
  options is still availeble..
  !! THIS TOOLTYPE OVERRIDES 'AskSM' !!

 @{u}ARC=[LhA a -x %a %f]@{uu} (*NEW in V3.00)
  Sets the custom  archiver  used  by  'build archive', use  %a  to  indicate
  archive name, and %f to mark filename..

@node HELP "Please help the author....."

 In developing the editor further I'd like some help from all  of  you  using
 it, I'm currently looking for:

 - Locales, both guide and catalogs, or just catalogs to  various  countries,
   the .cd and .ct files are included with the program,  but  please  let  me
   know before starting out, course others might be trying to write a  locale
   for the country allready.. When you finish your locale, please send it  to
   me and I'll put it in with the next version of the editor..

 - Vector files, I'm looking for the layout of the vector-data files  as  I'd
   like to be able to show them on screen..

 - New Ideas, if you got any..

@{b}@{u}The history of the Editor:@{uu}@{ub}

@{u}Future plans:@{uu} (In case I decide to make a 'next' version..)
  - Getting level-data back from a save game..
  - Get checker to find 'empty holes'..
  - Get those bloddy vector files to run..
  - Allow define zone to add points 'on the fly', so points can be defined as
    you draw the zones..
  - YOUR IDEAS :)

    to run in a true intuition system, and some preparing routines  has  been

@node "bugs" "Bugs known"
 This section is the worst to write, but I have to admit  that  some  of  the
 problems can't be fixed, due to the way the game works..

 Known bugs in the EDITOR
 ------------------------
 - Entering negative numbers in boxes where they have no meaning will
   change the number to something odd..
 - There appears to be some strange crashes from time to time in the
   object definer..
 - Autolink controlpoints sometimes screws up and crashes..
 - The 'get graphics back to iff' functions  don't  always  hit  the  colours
   that were originaly used (both the sequence and  the  actual  colours  can
   be changed a bit)
 - Sample replayer sometimes screws up with long samples..
 - New converters can't read 24-bit files proberly..
   (This is due to the way these formats work, you can't save a picture  with
   JPG and the bring it back with the accurate palette, this is  due  to  the
   format used.)


 Known bugs in the GAME
 ----------------------
 - I've been told that the palette can't be changed in the game..
   (This is why I haven't written a palette-changer)
 - If defining the last wallGFX (no. 16) the game won't boot right..


 Un-located bugs:
 ----------------
 - Some zone-configurations makes the game look odd:
   - Lifts in 2-level zone.
   - Door in 2-level zone.
   - Door next to 2-level zone.
   - Zones with sharp corners (<90 degrees)
   (I don't know where to find these bugs, and sometimes they don't
    appear when the zones is created ??)

@node OGFX "Object/Aliens BMP graphics"
 @{b}@{u}BitMap Graphics for Objects/Aliens.@{uu}@{ub}

 This is a Wee-bit complicated, but let's give it a shot:


 @{u}Drawing Graphics@{uu}

 Graphics should be drawn in a Bitmap drawing program like DPAINT or  PPaint,
 the  graphics MUST be drawn on a lowres screen using 32 colours. If you like
 to be a little smart (and kind to yourselve), then you should define a  size
 of  each  frame  you wish to draw (note the size down) and use this size for
 each and every frame. And then fill the maximum of frames across the screen,
 so  if your drawing on a 320 pix. wide screen and has each frame 32 pix wide
 then you put 10 frames in each row. This opens up  for  the  possibility  of
 automatic calculating the frames later on. If you're drawing aliens then you
 need to draw frames for at least 4 side-views  (front,  back,  left,  right)
 however  the  left/right  can be combined as the game is capable of flipping
 frames..


 @{u}Converting the graphics@{uu}

 Ok, now you have drawn your graphics as descriped before. Then you  need  to
 convert  the picture into the format used by the game. Enter the 'Set Object
 GFX Frames' and select 'Conv. BMP Frames'. You'll now be asked to select the
 IFF  file,  and then to enter some information about the file (framesize and
 number of frames). Then sit back and wait a while for the  converter  to  do
 it's job..

 Now there's only left to put the converted file into the system and  setting
 up the various frames..

 Make sure that you've got a prober datatype installed on your system, if
 you're in doubt then try playing it with something like 'PlayDT'..

 You have to ensure that the sample is at a rate of 8000, the converter
 will convert it anyway, but it will proberly not sound very good..

@node FGFX "Floor Graphics"
 @{b}@{u}Adding Floor/Roof graphics@{uu}@{ub} (THE OLD CONVERTER WAS REMOVED IN V3.00)


 There's 16 tiles for graphics to be used on  floor/roof,  they  are  created
 with this converter.


 @{u}Drawing & Preparing@{uu}
 This is much simpler, you draw all your tiles on a  single  256-colour  IFF,
 you  may  use  all  256  colours in each tiles (more colours, yes). You MUST
 ensure that you are using the 'brilpal' palette  (In  includes),  if  you're
 editing  a  converted pic, then the correct palette is set by the converter.
 You draw your tiles in rows of 5, each is 64*64, so the first tile starts in
 0,0 the second in 64,0 and so on. Number 6 then starts on 0,64. There's room
 for 16 tiles so you'll have 3 rows of 5 tiles and the last one on it's  own.
 This  means that you have to draw on a screen of 320*256 to make it fit. The
 screen may be in hires-lace or lowres at your desire. Just remember  to  use
 the  right  palette, unlike the old converter, this new don't match colours,
 it takes the drawing direct !!!!!

 @{u}Converting:@{uu}
 Select the 'AGA-IFF -> Floor' in the tools menu, then select  the  IFF-pic..
 The  convertion  takes  some time, but at the end you'll be asked to enter a
 name for the new floor-tile-file :)


 @{u}NOTES:@{uu}
 - The new converter uses DATATYES, this means that you can actualy save your
   pics in a space-saving format :)
 - To use the floors you MUST ensure that the tile-file is  the  one  pointed
   at in the floor-setup..
 - The converter will try and match the colours as good as p osible,  but  in
   certain cases it can be cheated very badly :(..
 - After converting all the tiles is held in just one file..
 - To change to the new format, you should first create a tile-file from  the
   old IFF-files, then select 'Floor -> AGA-IFF',  that'll  also  create  the
   right palette for the file :)

 NB: If you wish to draw 'glare' tiles for the new converter, you  just  draw
 them  on  the  right  place, using the FIRST 32 colours, to make things more
 like the 'old' way you can simply load the 'glare' palette up while  drawing
 the  special  tiles,  and finaly load the 'bripal' back up when you draw the
 others. The converter don't look at the  palette,  it  simply  converts  the
 points..

 Optimize Zones
 --------------

 The game (and the editor) stores zones in a list of structures, when  you've
 worked  for  some  time  on  a  level  and  removed several zones, then this
 structure can get quite messy and filled with holes. This option  runs  down
 the  structures  and  removes  empty  ones.  This causes a faster and better
 working level.

 When ?
 ------
 You should use this option before generating your level ('make'), the reason
 that  I  havn't  included  this  in  'make'  is that this option is not 100%
 tested, so you'll have to call it manualy..

 RMB Click in a zone will copy the current values into this zone.

Menu:
 The '++' will add 8 to the height
 The '+'  will add 1 to the height
 The '-'  will sub 1 from the height
 The '--' will sub 8 from the height

 Holding shift while pressing the buttons above makes the stepvalue *32.

 The 'ALL' function copies the value to ALL zones  currently  defined,  it'll
 not affect future defined zones..

 The copy function referes to the  RMB-click,  when  an  height  is  selected
 it'll be copied with RMB.

 To disable a height simply click on the number showing the height.


 Auto-stair is a help to create stairs, it works  simply  by  each  time  you
 select  a  zone  the  floor+roof  heights will be changed acording to a step
 value set by you, the changes can be made in upper or lower  floor  at  your
 choice,  and it's even posible to change floor in the middle of stepping up,
 so that you can make stairs in two levels, eg. if you need to go quite  high
 up,  you  can save some usefull space by having a two-level stair-case, note
 that when auto-stairs runs it ONLY changes values in the selected level, say
 if  you're  working  in  upper-level  with  a  stair, the lower level is not
 changed at all. When using auto-stair the height of the next zone you choose
 is  shown in the selector, clicking on that will turn the function off (when
 you're done with your stair). The Auto-stair function always uses the values
 currently in the menu to set the starting level.


 Notes:
  - Numbers are working in reverse, meaning the smaler the number, the higher
    the thing get, all references are  absolute,  and  are  NOT  relative  to
    eachother in any way.
  - Try to avoid zone-heights of 32 (eg. Floor=0, Roof=-32), players  can  be
    stuck under it, either make then lower so players can't  get  in, or make
    them higher so that it works normaly.
  - Numbers are checked against eachother by the editor, making sure that the
    roof is heigher that the floor.

 This is the way to alter the lightning in your level, dark, bright or  flash
 for the upper level.

 To alter something, it worth remembering that the brightness referes to  the
 points  in  a zone, in fact there are 4 bright-points pr. point, one for the
 upper-roof, one for the upper-floor, one for the lower-roof and the last for
 the lower-floor, to make it even more complex it's posible for a point to be
 included in several zones, then there's a group of brightsettings  for  that
 point  for  each  of  the zones. The roof and floor points are edited at the
 same time.

 - RMB chooses a zone to edit in.
 - LMB chooses a point in the selcted zone.
 - The 10 presets can be choosen by clicking on them, they'll affect all  the
   points in the zone
 - If the copy button is activated then the current setting of the sliders
   is copied to the point that's selected with LMB.



 -*- THE FOLOWING IS TAKEN FROM THE ORIGINAL DOCS -*-

 NB: In the diagram below, where the two zones  share  two  points,  remember
 that  you  must  define brightnesses for the two shared points in BOTH zones
 individually. This may sound odd and long-winded, but it allows you to  have
 sharp edged bright and dark areas.

 Values:
 -------

  BRIGHT: The default brightness value, ranging from  -20  to  +20.  NEGATIVE
  numbers  represent  the  same on-screen brightness as positive numbers, BUT
  they contribute nothing to the illumination of aliens, vector objects (e.g.
  the  player's  gun)  and  so on. Also, remember that numbers close to 0 are
  BRIGHT, whereas numbers towards -20 or +20 are  DIM.  The  reason  for  the
  positive/negative  values is simple: the light-sourceing of objects doesn't
  work well without it! For example, a brightly lit room with glowing  panels
  on  the  ceiling  means  that the light should be coming from above, and so
  aliens and guns should similarly be lit from above. In this case, the floor
  brightnesses  should  be set to -1, and the roof brightnesses to +1, so the
  room appears uniformly lit BUT aliens are lightsourced from above.

@node B5 "Set pointbright at lower level"
@{b}@{u}Set Lower Point Bright.@{uu}@{ub}

 This is the way to alter the lightning in your level, dark, bright or  flash
 for the lower level.

 To alter something, it worth remembering that the brightness referes to  the
 points  in  a zone, in fact there are 4 bright-points pr. point, one for the
 upper-roof, one for the upper-floor, one for the lower-roof and the last for
 the lower-floor, to make it even more complex it's posible for a point to be
 included in several zones, then there's a group of brightsettings  for  that
 point  for  each  of  the zones. The roof and floor points are edited at the
 same time.

 - RMB chooses a zone to edit in.
 - LMB chooses a point in the selcted zone.
 - The 10 presets can be choosen by clicking on them, they'll affect all  the
   points in the zone
 - If the copy button is activated then the current setting of the sliders
   is copied to the point that's selected with LMB.



 -*- THE FOLOWING IS TAKEN FROM THE ORIGINAL DOCS -*-

 NB: In the diagram below, where the two zones  share  two  points,  remember
 that  you  must  define brightnesses for the two shared points in BOTH zones
 individually. This may sound odd and long-winded, but it allows you to  have
 sharp edged bright and dark areas.

 Values:
 -------

  BRIGHT: The default brightness value, ranging from  -20  to  +20.  NEGATIVE
  numbers  represent  the  same on-screen brightness as positive numbers, BUT
  they contribute nothing to the illumination of aliens, vector objects (e.g.
  the  player's  gun)  and  so on. Also, remember that numbers close to 0 are
  BRIGHT, whereas numbers towards -20 or +20 are  DIM.  The  reason  for  the
  positive/negative  values is simple: the light-sourceing of objects doesn't
  work well without it! For example, a brightly lit room with glowing  panels
  on  the  ceiling  means  that the light should be coming from above, and so
  aliens and guns should similarly be lit from above. In this case, the floor
  brightnesses  should  be set to -1, and the roof brightnesses to +1, so the
  room appears uniformly lit BUT aliens are lightsourced from above.
                
  ANIM: There are several pre-defined lighting animations available:

 Keys:
  RMB Select a zone
  LMB Put current tile on a wall (Wall will flash in a special way..)..
  'f' Will put the current tile onto ALL walls of the selected zone..

 Notes:
  - Tiles are scaled on the screen to alow you to see all of the tile..
  - Stretching a tile means that if the length of the wall  don't  match  the
    length of one or more tiles, the tiles will be streched to fit the wall.
  - Squeezing works like strectching except it will squeeze the tiles to make
    room for one extra tile..

 you'd  like  to hear at the choosen action. When you're done select the zone
 where you'd like to place it with RMB and click on 'place'. Now look at  the
 'top-height' setting, this decides how high the roof of the lift is, normaly
 you'd set this to the height of the roof at the top-floor. Now there's  only
 left  to define the rising walls, you should only set these at the low level
 of the lift, at the top nothing should be done. Select the zone next to  the
 bottom  level  of the lift with RMB, and click on the 'clock-low' end of the

 @{u}Level Directory@{uu}
 The top section of the screen is dedicated to the path of level-data..
 It's possible to have several groups of levels on the game, the  active  one
 is selected with this function, all level-oriented functions of  the  editor

 The create directories function builds the structure needed  y  the  levels,
 you should call this after setting a new directory to be used, or  both  the
 game and the editor is in trouble..

 @{u}Change Level Names@{uu}
 This function is just cosmetic, it decides what should  be  written  on  the
 game's menu when entering next level, normaly this will be something  simple
 like 'Level A' or something, but you can use anything for t his,  if  you're
 building groups of levels you can name 'em 'Start' of 'Begining'....

 @{u}Level-Music@{uu}
 Boom - Boom - Boom, That's about the way it sounds as standard,  with  this

 Before any aliens or pickups can be defined, you must provide  the  graphics
 for  them,  and  before  you  can  do that, they must be converted using the
 appropriate supplied utilities.
        
 1. You will see a list of currently loaded graphics and a  blank  space  for
 inserting  a  new one. Either click on one to replace, or click on the blank
 space. In either case, you must use the LEFT mouse button. Use the requester
 which  appears  to  select  EITHER the '.ptr' or '.wad' file produced by the
 convertors.
           
 2. Assuming all is well, the filename will appear in the list on the screen.
 Now  you  must  define the frames of animation within the file. Click on the
 name but this time holding 'ALT' with the LEFT mouse button.
           
 3. You will be shown a strip of the graphics, in the  height  you  converted
 them.  Do  not worry if the palette is not right; this is a failing of AMOS.
 The following will be shown also, at the bottom of the screen:
           
 X,Y:
  These are the mouse coordinates within the graphic file. Clicking with  the
  LEFT  mouse  button  with  the  cursor  within the graphic file area of the
  screen copies the X and Y value shown into the FRAME  LEFT  and  FRAME  TOP
  values below.
           
 SCROLL LEFT, SCROLL RIGHT
  These buttons can be clicked upon to scroll  the  graphic  file  across  to
  display parts of it currently off-screen.
           
 FRAME NUMBER
  This is the frame number you are currently defining, from 0 to 31.
           
 PREVIOUS/NEXT FRAME
  Changes the current frame number.
           
 FRAME LEFT/TOP/WIDTH/HEIGHT
  These values represent the left side, top side, width  and  height  of  the
  current  frame. You can click upon and type to change any of them, the idea
  being that they  enclose  each  seperate  'frame'  of  animation  you  have
  designed.
           
 GENERATE FRAMES FROM GRAPHICS DATA
  If you have drawn and converted the graphics in line  with  the  guidelines
  set  down  in  the  document  mentioned  below, you can shortcut this whole
  process and click on this button. The position and size of all  the  frames
  will  be  defined. However, you cannot use this function if some frames are
  different sizes, or located at different heights within the  graphic  file.
  In such cases you must simply type or click all the values in manually.

 player enteres the zone, then the SFX will be played.  So  you  can  play  a
 scream,  a  little tune or perhaps a computer voice when the player moves on
 his way..

@node M0501 "Set Bullet Stats"
 @{b}@{u}Define Bullet Types@{uu}@{ub}

 No doubt you will want aliens to shoot at you and vice-versa, and before you
 can  make  them  do  this, you have to define some bullet types. Aliens fire
 selected bullet types, as do the player's guns, and ammo  you  collect  also
 gives you specified ammounts of each bullet type to shoot. The term 'bullet'
 is a bit of a misnomer and should really be 'projectile' since it can  refer
 to  bullets,  mines,  grenades,  rockets, and, curiously enough, the bits of
 splatch that aliens spurt when shot.
                                        
 To define the NAME of a bullet, click on the existing  name  with  the  LEFT
 mouse  button and type in your new name. You can now hold 'ALT' and click on
 the name to enter the status screen.
        
 DAMAGE TO TARGET PER BULLET
    This refers to the amount of damage the target (ie an alien, an object or
    you  yourself)  will  take  on being struck directly by the projectile. A
    value of zero disables collision with other  objects,  useful  for  stuff
    like the blood which spurts out of aliens.

 VISIBLE BULLET OR INSTANT EFFECT
    Bullets can  either  be  visible,  like  grenades  or  plasma  bolts,  or
    invisible and instantly effective like shotgun blasts or rifle bullets.

 GRAVITY VALUE
    ONLY AVAILABLE FOR VISIBLE BULLETS
    This indicates the effect  gravity  has  upon  the  projectile.  Grenades
    should have a value of about 20 or so, with 0 representing gravity having
    no effect. NOTE that negative values are possible,  and  will  cause  the
    bullet to fall towards the roof!
        
 BOUNCE OFF WALLS Y/N
    ONLY AVAILABLE FOR VISIBLE BULLETS
    Toggles bouncing off walls on/off.  NB:  Bullets  which  are  subject  to
    gravity  will  be slowed down by contact with walls, but those unaffected
    by gravity (Gravity Value = 0) are assumed  to  be  some  sort  of  lazer
    weapon and are not slowed down.
        
 BOUNCE OFF FLOORS/CEILINGS
    ONLY AVAILABLE FOR VISIBLE BULLETS
    Toggles bouncing off floors and ceilings. Slowdown rules same as above.
        
 BOUNCE NOISE
    NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THIS VERSION.
    This setting has no effect at present, although updates may rectify  this
    absence.
        
 BULLET LIFETIME
    ONLY AVAILABLE FOR VISIBLE BULLETS
    Bullets may last forever (a value of -1 denotes this) or may  fizzle  out
    or  detonate  after  a certain time. This value is measured in 50ths of a
    second. Projectiles not defined  as  bouncing  will  detonate  or  fizzle
    prematurely  if they strike a wall, and will detonate in any case if they
    strike an enemy target (either you or an alien depending upon  who  fired
    it).
        
 EXPLOSIVE FORCE
    ONLY AVAILABLE FOR VISIBLE BULLETS
    When the bullet runs out of time  or  hits  an  alien  or  wall,  it  may
    explode.  A  value  of  zero  represents  no  explosion, with about 40-50
    representing a reasonably powerful blast. NOTE: The visual effect  of  an
    explosion  is  created by producing several copies of the 'impact' frames
    of animation around the central blast area, so if you have  an  explosive
    bullet,  ensure  that  the  impact  frames are of a suitable type to look
    right when the explosion occurs.

 MOVEMENT SPEED 0-7
    ONLY AVAILABLE FOR VISIBLE BULLETS
    The speeds of bullets are not measured linearly, but in  powers  of  two.
    Thus  '0'  is  very,  very  slow  (in  practice,  not  movement  at  all,
    particularly if you use it for mines  which  drop  and  hit  the  ground,
    slowing  down  and therefore stopping entirely) and 7 is, well, 128 times
    faster than that! A speed of 7 is extremely fast, with speeds of 5 and  6
    more suitable for standard fireballs and so on.

 IMPACT NOISE
    ONLY AVAILABLE FOR VISIBLE BULLETS
    Click on this and you will be presented with  a  list  of  the  currently
    loaded  samples. Select one to make the bullet trigger that noise when it
    hits, or click at the top of the screen to select 'none'.


 BULLET GRAPHIC TYPE
    There are three options, which should be selected according to what  sort
    of graphic you have drawn:
    BITMAP:
       Simplest option of the three, this  just  draws  the  frame  onto  the
       screen scaled appropriately.
    GLARE:
       Uses the 'GLARE/SHADOW' rules to either brighten  or  dim  the  screen
       behind. See 'HOW2-Draw_And_Convert_Glare_Graphics' for instructions.
    ADDITIVE TRANSPARENCY:
       Uses a different routine again to 'add' the graphic in  a  transparent
       fashion  to  the  graphics already on-screen, thus giving a 'firey' or
       'smokey'   or   'blazing   plasma   death   bolt'   impression.    See
       'HOW2-Draw_And_Convert_Additive_Transparency_Objects'              for
       instructions.
        
 IMPACT GRAPHIC TYPE
    Same as above, but for the impact frames.

@node M0601 "Set Guns"
 @{b}@{u}Define Player Guns@{uu}@{ub}

 The player is likely to feel a little defenseless without guns to shoot, and
 indeed  you  MUST have the first weapon defined before you can play the game
 (the default game link file contains one pre-defined weapon, the shotgun).
        
 You will  be  shown  a  list  of  10  guns,  along  with  various  items  of
 information:
        
 <GUN NAME>
    Click to type a new name for the gun.
        
 <BULLET TYPE>
    Click, and then select a bullet from the list shown. This is the type  of
    bullet the gun will fire.
        
 Bullets Fired/Shot
    Click and type a number from 1  upwards.  Only  used  by  instant  effect
    bullets, so shotguns can be double-barrelled and fire two bullets (either
    of which has an independant chance of hitting the target).
        
 Delay between shots
    A value in 50ths of a second  representing  the  delay  between  the  gun
    firing  successive  times.  Thus a machine gun might have a value of 5, a
    rocket launcher a value of 50 or 100. Of course, you could always have  a
    rapid-fire rocket launcher....

@node M0701 "Aliens"
 @{b}@{u}Define Aliens@{uu}@{ub} (This is taken from the original docs)

 This is probably the most arduous task facing the prospective game designer,
 as it requires the most data to be input.
        
 You will be shown a list of aliens to define. To change their name, click on
 the  existing  name  and  type  the new one.

 Holding 'ALT' while clicking will bring up these options:

 GRAPHIC TYPE (This can be one of three main types):
  - BITMAP
    The  alien  will  use  standard  bitmap   graphics   converted   by   the
    OBJECTCONVERTOR program. The alien will only be lightsourced so far as to
    be made brighter in bright rooms and dimmer in dark rooms. This option is
    the one used in all other games of this sort.
        
  - VECTOR
    If you have designed animation frames for a vector alien, you can specify
    that you wish to use them by selecting this option.
        
  - LIGHTSOURCED PALETTE 1/2/3/4
    These options can be selected, but you won't be able to use them  because
    the  support  programs  for  producing  lightsourced  graphics  were  not
    included in this package. Look out for a  coverdisk  with  tutorials  and
    support  programs  soon!  For  now,  you'll  have  to be content with the
    options above.
                
 DEFINE ANIMATION FRAMES

        If you are designing a BITMAP alien, consult the file
        
        HOW2-Define_Alien_Animations
        
        otherwise check out
        
        HOW2-Define_Vector_Alien_Anims
        
        AFTER YOU HAVE READ THE REST OF THIS FILE!!!
        
 Default Behaviour:
    Aliens can either walk, or fly. This can  be  indicated  by  either  WALK
    RANDOMLY or FLY RANDOMLY being selected (click to toggle)
        
 Reaction time
    This is the amount of time the alien must  see  you  for  (uninterrupted)
    before  it  will  notice you and take appropriate action. If you shoot it
    and it doesn't die, it will immediately spot you. This value is  measured
    in  50ths  of  a second. If your aliens are too easy, try decreasing this
    value rather than increasing hit points or whatever.
        
 Default Movement Speed
    This is the speed which the alien wanders around at when it can't see you
    and is not attacking. 5 is an average sort of speed, 10 is zippy and more
    than 10 is ludicrous.

 Response Behaviour
    This is what the alien will do when it notices you; either:

 Response Movement Speed
    Only used in charging aliens, this governs how  quickly  the  alien  will
    charge.
        
 Response Timeout
    You can make the alien 'get bored' and  stop  charging  after  a  certain
    amount  of  time.  IF  you  don't want this to happen, type in a nice big
    number like 10000, representing over three minutes! Value is measured  in
    50ths of a second.

 Damage Taken Limit -> Retrest
    NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THIS VERSION
        
 Damage Inflicted Limit -> Followup
    NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THIS VERSION

 Followup Behaviour
    Once the alien has executed its attack animation, or has timed out of its
    response counter, it will 'followup'
        
 Followup Movement Speed
    The speed at which the alien will approach you (if at all)
        
 Followup Timeout
    Assuming the alien can still see you once this  timer  expires,  it  will
    attack again. This value is measured in 50ths of a second.

 RETREAT BEHAVIOUR/RETREAT MOVEMENT SPEED/RETREAT TIMEOUT
    NOT IMPLEMENTED IN THIS VERSION.
        
 NUMBER OF HIT POINTS
    The 'toughness' of the alien. Think about how tough you want the alien to
    be  relative  to  each  of your guns. Do you want it to keel over after a
    single shotgun blast? Then make its hit points less than the damage  done
    by  your  shotgun  rounds. Want it to soak up rockets and laugh chestily?
    Then make its hit points HUGE, so that the damage of the rocket PLUS  its
    explosive  force  (the  maximum amount of damage it can do to an alien or
    yourself) is much less.

 Physical Height
    How tall is your alien? To make it walk on the ground, a good  height  to
    use  is  TWICE  the  SH  (Scaled  Height) of the animation frames you are
    using. Notice that aliens CANNOT  WALK  into  rooms  whose  floor-ceiling
    height  is  LESS  than this value, and CANNOT MOVE in rooms which are too
    short if you plonk them in there to begin with.

 Minimum distance to walls
    Small or thin aliens can get quite close to walls, so a value of  0  will
    suffice.  But  if  it's  a  fat beasty, a value of 1 or 2 will prevent it
    squeezing unrealisically into narrow tunnels.
        
 Projectiles Ejected Upon Death
    Clicking on this will bring up a list of projectiles (bullets) which  the
    alien  can  splurt  out when it dies. Interestingly, you can make it spit
    out actual bullets (as long as they are VISIBLE ones) when it dies,  thus
    allowing  sneaky  aliens to hemmorhage grenades as their innards rupture,
    which makes the player's situation just a little dicey...
        
    Alternatively, you can choose to click on 'Select Alien to spawn instead'
    and  pick  a  type of alien. Upon death, the alien will spawn FOUR of the
    aliens you  selected.  Please  don't  be  silly  and  make  aliens  spawn
    themselves,  or  make  them  spawn  other aliens which in turn spawn them
    back. You'll only get annoyed playing the game as hordes  of  replicating
    aliens engulf you mercilessly.
        
 Auxilliary Object Type:
    Click on this and  select  an  object  whose  frames  have  been  set  up
    correctly.
        
    By 'correctly', what do I mean? Well, if you define a DECORATION  object,
    and  make it look like an animation of a gun barrel flash, you can use it
    as an AUXILLIARY OBJECT. At any point in any animation sequence  for  the
    alien,  you  can  make  the game paste a frame from the auxilliary object
    somewhere over the top of the alien  graphic.  This  is  how  the  muzzle
    flashes  and  glaring  lights  of the various alien guards were produced.
    Auxilliary objects may be BITMAP or GLARE/SHADOW, but not VECTOR. If  you
    are  not  using  any  auxilliary graphics on the alien, you don't have to
    define this value at all.

 Torch Brightness
    Aliens can carry 'torches', illuminating the level in front  of  them.  A
    value  of  30  is  a  reasonable  torch  brightness,  whilst a value of 0
    indicates no torch.
        
 Bullet Source X and Y offsets.
    These value indicate how far from the centre of  the  alien  its  bullets
    should  originate.  This  is  largely  a  matter  of trial and error, but
    remember that negative values mean the bullet comes from the left or  the
    top, whilst positive values mean the right or the bottom.

@node M0801 "Objects"
 @{b}@{u}Define Objects@{uu}@{ub} (This is taken from the original docs)

 The term 'Object' in AB3DII has quite a broad meaning.  Basically,  anything
 which  isn't  a  bullet, a player, an alien or background (walls, floors and
 ceilings) is an object. 

 Click on an empty space or an object you want  to  redefine  with  the  LEFT
 mouse  button,  and  type the new name. Clicking on the object while holding
 'ALT' takes you into the actual definiton screen.

 There are several various object-types, those are listed here in  top-bottom
 order:

 Collectable
    The object may be collected by the player. When this happens, the  player
    will  recieve whatever ammunition or other supplies the object is defined
    to provide, and the object will remove  itself  from  the  map.  Once  so
    removed it will also cease to hold any doors and lifts.
                
 Activatable
    The object can be 'activated' by the player being within  its  activation
    radius  and pressing the space bar. When this happens the object switches
    to 'active mode'. The player can switch it back, or it can 'timeout'  and
    return to its inactive state. Whilst active the object will cease to hold
    any doors or lifts.
                
 Destructable.
    The object  can  be  damaged  by  player  bullets  and  explosions.  Once
    destroyed  it  will  cease to hold any doors or lifts, and will no longer
    impede the player.
                
 Decoration
    The object cannot be interacted with in any way  and  simply  sits  there
    playing through its animation sequence.
        

 When entering the stats-screen these are the options:
        
 Type Of Object
    Click to cycle through the four types above.

 Graphic Type
    Click to cycle through:
    BITMAP
       Simplest type of object; uses ordinary bitmap graphics
    POLYGON
       An object of this type  uses  frames  of  animation  from  3D  objects
       designed using the ANIMEDITOR program.
    GLARE/SMOKE
       The object  is  drawn  transparently,  brightening  or  darkening  the
       graphics behind it. See HOW2-Draw_Glare_Objects for instructions.

 Deactivate after..
    ONLY FOR ACTIVATABLE OBJECTS
    This value is the time in 50ths of a second between the player activating
    the object and it deactivating automatically.

 Number Of Hit Points
    ONLY FOR DESTRUCTABLE OBJECTS
    The number of damage points the object can take before it is destroyed.

 Explosive Potential
    ONLY FOR DESTRUCTABLE OBJECTS
    The explosive force with which the object detonates upon its destruction.
        
 Impassable in default state
    DESTRUCTABLE AND DECORATION OBJECTS ONLY
    Does the object obstruct the player until destroyed? This value gives you
    the answer.
        
 Define Guns/Jetpack/Shield Given
    Clicking here brings a list of toggles as to what the object provides the
    player with when he collects or activates it.
        
 Define Ammo/Fuel given
    Clicking here gives a list of what ammo and health is given by the object
    when  collected/activated. Hence a 'gun' object would give the player the
    appropriate gun, and also some of the ammo that the gun fires.

 Collision cylinder radius
    This is the distance a player has to be within to collect or activate the
    object. About 100-150 is usually about right.

 Collision cylinder height
    This is the height within which the player must be to collect the object.
    About 100 is usually ok.
        
 Position vertically relative to:
    Either the FLOOR or the CEILING can be  toggled  between  here,  and  the
    object  will  be  positioned  next to the one selected. Thus the Vertical
    Offset in the animation data is important to pull the object up  or  down
    into the room.

 Lock to nearest wall?
    If this is enabled, then the object will 'snap' to the nearest wall  when
    placed  in the level and will face outwards into the room (vector objects
    only)
        
 Activation/Collection/Destruction sound effect
    Click here to set the appropriate sound effect  for  whatever  action  is
    appropriate to the type of object.

@node BuildArchive "Build Distribution Archives"
 @{b}@{u}Build Distribution Archives@{uu}@{ub} (*NEW in V3.00)

 This function was suggested by Tiziano, thanks for the Idea..

 Use this to build an archive containing all needed files to play the  levels
 you  make. You can use this mainly for sending levels to AmiNET or to put on
 homepages/cd's etc..


 NOTES:
  - The function does NOT check for what actual GFX files is  needed  by  the
    single level, this would have NO meaning 'course the game won't start  if
    any of the files pointed by the setup are missing..
  - It is perfectly legal to create an archive with NO levels,  that'll  only
    include the setup-files..
  - The 2 standard packers uses calls that keeps the paths of the files,  you
    should ensure that the custom call also does that if you use it..
  - The editor compares for new/changed files relating to the original  GAME,
    NOT the original editor config, this  mean  that  the  levels  should  be
    installed 'on-top' of the game to run..
  - The function should find files that have been changed and saved under the
    same name, it does NOT rely on filenames or sizes only, the editor  tries
    to find changed files using a 'checksum' of the file..
  - The function is based on DISC files, that means you  MUST save your setup
    and/or level BEFORE packing the archive if you'd like it included..
  - The function is NOT erasing any previous archive with the same  name,  so
    ensure that the filename is NOT present before packing..

 Options:
  - 'Levels'
      Hehe, tricky ey ?. Simply tick the ones you'd like to include.

  - 'Include Developer files'
      Ticking this will include the special  files  needed  for  editing  the
      level later on, this mean included 3 aditional files for each level..
  - 'Include Game-SetUp'
      Ticking this includes any changed/new gamesetup files in  the  archive,
      this include texts, GFX, SFX, Vector, Objects, etc..

  - 'Archiver'
      Select what archiver you'd like to use:
      'LhA' will use 'LhA a -x %a %f' as command for packing
      'LZx' will use 'Lzx a -x %a %f' as command for packing
      'Custom' uses the command set by a @{"tooltype" link TOOL}..

@node WGFX "Converting Wall-graphics"

 Wallgraphics was  originaly  converted  with  the  '256wall'  program,  I've
 included it in the main editor and rewritten it a little bit, so here's some
 new instructions:

 Drawing graphics:
 -----------------
 Graphics are drawn in a normal drawingprogram, and must be saved as IFF, you
 can  use  2->32  colours  in  the  drawing  process,  but  remember that the
 converter changes the colours to match with the internal palette used by the
 game,  so  the  colours  might  not  be excatly the same as the one's you've
 choosen, the converter makes a match to try and  find  a  colour  that's  as
 close  as  posible,  but  some  times it misses a bit.. Several tiles can be
 drawn next to eachother, but don't make the screen width more that 640,  the
 game  can't handle it. Each tile should have a width of 16,32,64,128 or 256,
 if you use other sizes you'll get in trouble when including them, the height
 of  the  tiles  is  less sensitive, but should be at least 8, to make things
 more easy you should try to hold the values at 8,16,32,64,128,256 or 512, if
 you  choose  to  use  other  heights make sure the height is even, or you'll
 proberly have something looking quite odd..

 Converting:
 -----------
 The converter can be found in the 'Define walls'  section,  simply  hit  the
 function, and choose your IFF-file, unlike the 'old' converter this will try
 to figure out the width and height of the file, these will  be  the  default
 values,  so  when  the  converter  asks for 'width' and 'height' the numbers
 shown are the defaults and will be  activated  if  you  just  press  'enter'
 without any number.. The converter will start out by getting the palette and
 then getting the drawed data, if you think that  the  palette-generation  is
 taking  longer  than before, you're proberly rigt, I've tried to enhance the
 selection of colours to make it hit better, and it takes a  little  longer..
 When  saving  the  file simply enter the name you'd like, the converter will
 add '.256wad' if you don't..

 Notes:
 ------
 - If you're changing a wall defined in the list (converting again  with  the
   same name) and you have changed the height of the chunck you MUST reselect
   the file, if you don't the graphics will screw up..

@endnode

@node LMUC "Converting LevelMusics"
 Each Level can have  an  exclusive  Music-file,  the  file  is  set  in  the
 'game-setup' menu, sub point 'Set Level Music'...

 Creating Music.
 ---------------
 As this is not a guide to writing music, I'll simply say that the  basic  is
 to get hold of some music in  '.mod'  format,  say  either  Soundtracker  or
 even better, ProTracker, I'm not sure if the game supports the  latest  news
 in ProTracker, but check it out.. Unforturnaly it appears that the original
 game is disabeling some of the sound channels, and with some settings you'll
 only hear the sound on 'track 1' of the module.. :(

 Converting.
 -----------
 Ehh, Well, converting is perhaps a little over the top to say, what is  done
 is simply a packing of the file. So copy our music-module where  you'd  like
 it to be ('Ab3:Music/' would be the place), and select  'Pack file'  in  the
 'Tools' menu, select your module and wait, that should be it...

    - Locks on doors/lifts is defined along with the object that you'd like
      to lock the door, when the object is destroyed/picked-up then the lock
      will be broken, choose 'C1' (Add object) and pick the locking object
      select what door/lift should be held (locked) and set the rest the way

@node CTPT "How 2 use controlpoints"
 Add Control Points to Levels (This is taken from the original docs)
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
                                
 Control points are a wonderful new invention which allows aliens  to  follow
 you all over the level without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.
 Erm.

        
 Ok, what control points actually do is give the aliens a 'road map'  of  the
 level; sort of invisible lines on the floor for them to trundle around. Such
 paths  have  been  used  in  other  games  to  make  aliens  patrol   around
 convincingly.  The  difference with AB3D is that the aliens can use this map
 to get to you, if they know where you are, from the other side of the level,
 assuming  there is a path from where they are to where you are. Also, if you
 make a sound somewhere near to an alien which is active, it will  'hear  it'
 and run to the control point it heard the sound coming from. If you continue
 shooting, therefore, it will eventually make its way all  the  way  over  to
 where  you  are!  In  the diagram below, for example, the player is standing
 near control point A. He has just fired his gun, and the alien  at  point  C
 will  therefore  run  to control point B, which is the one towards where the
 player is. When the alien reaches point B it will listen for the  player  to
 make  more  sounds, trying to see if it can track him further. If it doesn't
 hear anything, it will wander off looking for him.

                                +---------------+-----------+
                                
PLACING CONTROL POINTS
----------------------

 Control points must be joined with straight lines and MUST NOT  cross  walls
 which  the aliens cannot climb over. Therefore control points must be placed
 at all junctions and corners so that aliens can navigate properly. Also,  if
 you  want aliens to venture into a dead end, even if it is only a short one,
 you must put a control point near the end of the dead end.
        
 1. To place control points, select the icon on the right  hand  end  of  the
    scrollable icon bar; it looks like the 'add point' icon only with a  pink
    dot rather than a green one.
        
 2. Move the cursor into the edit area and click where you want to position a
    control point with the mouse buttons. If you click the LEFT mouse button,
    the control point will be pink, indicating that it is in the  LOWER  part
    of a zone. If instead you use the RIGHT mouse button, the  control  point
    will be BLUE, indicating that it is in the upper part of the zone.  Hence
    you can cause aliens to navigate across winding gantries without  falling
    off.
           
NB YOU CAN ONLY HAVE 100 CONTROL POINTS PER LEVEL SO USE THEM WISELY!

 You can also MOVE control points by clicking on the 'O->' icon,  grabbing  a
 control point by moving the cursor over it and pressing 'g', then placing it
 somewhere else by clicking with the left or right mouse buttons as above.

           
LINKING CONTROL POINTS
----------------------

 So that the aliens can  move  around,  you  must  link  the  control  points
 together.  There  are  two  ways they can be linked: PHYSICALLY or VISUALLY.
 Points linked PHYSICALLY describe a route for walking aliens. Points  linked
 VISUALLY  describe extra routes for flying aliens. Hence if you have a chasm
 with walkways on either side, the control points on each  walkway  would  be
 linked  visually,  because flying aliens could get across but walking aliens
 could not. Control points which are linked PHYSICALLY are assumed to also be
 linked VISUALLY (but not the other way around).
 PHYSICAL links may be one-directional or  two-directional.  ONE  directional
 links  may  only  be walked in one direction but are linked VISUALLY in both
 directions; TWO directional links may be walked in both directions.
        
 NB: If an alien cannot physically reach you (eg an impassable  chasm  or  an
 unclimbable  cliff),  but DOES know where you are, he may attempt to reach a
 position linked VISUALLY to your position so he can take pot shots  at  you.
 To  take a simple example: say the player is on top of a cliff. Below him is
 a gorge, across which there is no bridge. There is a staircase leading up to
 the  OTHER  side  of  the  gorge from the bottom, but not up to the side the
 player is on. Imagine there are several walking  aliens  with  guns  in  the
 bottom  of  the  gorge. The player doesn't want to jump down with them still
 there, so he keeps popping out and shooting, then ducking back out of  harms
 way. The aliens cannot reach him, and nor can they see him properly from the
 bottom of the gorge. They will therefore climb the staircase  to  the  other
 rim of the gorge where they can see the player and shoot at him!
        
 1. Select the 'link control points' icon. This is near to the  'add  control
 point'  icon and looks like a pink dot with three black lines radiating from
 it.
           
 2. Clicking on a control point (say point A) and then on another (say  point
 B)  with  the  LEFT  mouse  button  toggles  the  PHYSICAL LINK from A to B.
 Clicking on them in the opposite order toggles the link from B to A. To link
 them  two-directionally, therefore, it is necessary to click A, then B, then
 B again, and finally A. One-directional links are indicated by a  red  arrow
 indicating  the  possible  direction  of  travel;  two directional links are
 indicated by a blue, unarrowed line.
           
 3. Clicking on a control point (A) and then on another (B)  with  the  RIGHT
 mouse  button  toggles  the  VISUAL  link between the two points. If the two
 points are already linked visually, the link will be removed.  If  they  are
 linked  physically  in  one  or  two  directions,  or not linked at all, the
 existing link (or lack of it) will be replaced by a purple line indicating a
 VISUAL link.

        
OTHER TOOLS:
------------

 Obviously it is unreasonable to expect someone  to  click-click-click  their
 way  through  a  room containing 20+ control points, so it is only (usually)
 necessary to define the PHYSICAL links by hand.  The  VISUAL  links  can  be
 auto-generated  by pressing RSHIFT and V together, with the cursor somewhere
 in the edit area. Visual links will be  automatically  created  between  any
 points  with  a  line  of  sight  between  them which are not already linked
 physically. This takes a little while, but console yourself with the thought
 that it's about 250,000 times faster than you could do it by hand.

 NOTE: If you have a tall pillar with a control point on  either  side,  then
       the autolinker WILL link the two points, because there is no  hole  in
       the map seperating them. The ONLY time the autolinker  will  not  link
       points across a zone is if that zone's  roof  and  floor  are  at  the
       same height; ie no travel across it is possible at ANY height.
              
              
ASSOCIATING CONTROL POINTS WITH ZONES:
--------------------------------------

 Since you can have up to 256 zones but only 100  control  points,  it  seems
 fairly  obvious  that  not  all  zones  can  have  a  control point in them.
 Therefore the question of which control  point  an  alien  is  nearest  when
 standing in any particulat zone must be decided by you in advance.
        
 This can be done in two ways,  both  of  which  begin  by  clicking  on  the
 'associate  zone  with control point icon (which looks like a small triangle
 near to a pink dot). Next, you either
        
 1. Select a zone with the RIGHT mouse button and click on the control  point
 you  want  to  associate  with  it  with  the  LEFT  mouse button. Make it a
 reasonable choice, ie don't pick a point on the other side of a solid  wall.
 Repeat this process with each zone until you have covered the whole level.
           
 UPPERS:     This process is VERY accurate and yields the most bug-free maps.
           
 DOWNERS:    It takes AGES, and it's easy to forget to do certain bits of the
             map.
           
 2. Press RSHIFT and A together with the cursor on the edit area.  This  will
 auto-associate  zones  and  control points. Again, this takes a little while
 but speeds things up a lot.
           
 UPPERS:     Takes no effort and doesn't miss anything out
           
 DOWNERS:    It can quite often make mistakes; linking zones to points not in
             visual sight of them.
                        
 I prefer to initially use method 2, then tidy up with method 1 if  I  notice
 any aliens stuck in corners or walking into walls.
        
 You must also link any upper parts  of  zones  (eg  gantries)  with  control
 points,  and this must be done manually because of the error-prone nature of
 the process. Select the 'link upper zone to control point'  icon  (like  the
 other one but with a double-triangle) and associate as before.
        
 It is perfectly OK to link a lower zone to an  upper  control  point  or  an
 upper  zone  to a lower control point. See diagram for an explanation of why
 you might want to do this.

 In the diagram point 2 (+) is a blue (upper zone control point), and point 1
 (*)  is  a  pink,  lower zone control point. Zones B and C comprise a gantry
 above a large room, whilst zones A and D are corridors leading out onto that
 gantry.  As you can see, given the arrangement above, the upper part of zone
 C and the lower part of zone D should BOTH be linked to  point  2,  and  the
 lower  part  of zone A and the upper part of zone B should both be connected
 to point 1.

@node H001 "How 2 create challenging levels"
 Create Challenging Levels (This is taken from the original docs)
 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 There are an awful lot of features in TKG, and how to use them all  together
 may  not  seem  obvious  at  first.  This  document tries to show how to use
 features to create levels which are challenging  for  the  player  by  being
 well-designed, not simply by having lots of aliens and no health packs!

        
1. Layout of the level
----------------------

 Before putting mouse to screen, draw out your level on paper. The worst  way
 to do this is to just draw a room, then a corridor, then another room with a
 couple of corridors, then another room and so on.  Levels  drawn  like  this
 tend to be dull and samey. Instead, try one or more of these techniques:
        
a) Designing to a purpose.

 Think of a function the level might serve. It could  be  a  hospital,  or  a
 training  camp,  or  a  sewage system, or perhaps two areas linked together.
 Once you have an idea  in  mind,  layout  ideas  will  usually  follow.  For
 example,  the sewage system would have a lot of tunnels, with steps or lifts
 leading up into various buildings, perhaps.
        
b) Designing to fit a space

 Draw an outline on you paper, a 'perimeter wall' which your level  must  fit
 into.  Make  it  excitingly  chunky and purposeful. I find this helps a lot;
 having to fit your level into the shape prevents it sprawling  like  a  very
 old bag of potatoes.
        
c) Designing to suit an alien

 When you design your aliens you are probably going to have one or more  big,
 tough critters that are going to severely impede the player's progress. Such
 aliens should have levels custom-designed to suit their abilities.

        
2. Useful level building blocks
-------------------------------

a) Did I just step on something...?

 A very useful thing to define is an 'invisible trigger'. This can be used to
 set off messages and trigger doors and lifts, preferably with lots of aliens
 behind/on them. Simply place the trigger somewhere the player has to go  and
 arrange for it to dispense aliens at the most inconvenient moment possible.

        
b) They're appearing out of thin air! AAARGGHH!

 This is a good one. When the player picks up  a  gun,  shoots  a  particular
 alien  or  whatever,  this can trigger several aliens to teleport from their
 'homes' outside the level, into the room the unlucky player is standing  in.
 How  to  do  it? Well, first of all, define several alien 'houses'. An alien
 'house' is a pair of zones not connected in any  way  to  the  rest  of  the
 level:
        
        *------*
        |      |
        |      |
        |      |
        *======*
        |      |
        |      |
        |      |
        *------*
        
 Define one zone as a lift and the other as a teleporter. Put  your  alien(s)
 on the lift, making sure that their 'permanent calculation' flag is ON. Make
 sure the lift starts at the TOP of its movement, and that at that height  it
 is  ABOVE  the ceiling height of the teleporter (this prevents flying aliens
 making their way into the teleporter before the lift is triggered).  Arrange
 the  alien/gun/health pack/key or whatever so that it triggers the lift into
 falling to the same height as the teleporter. Place a control point in  each
 zone  and  link  them together. This will ensure the aliens will wander onto
 the teleporter as soon as they can.

        
c) Smithers, did you just press that big, red button?

 Even more annoying to the player than tripping invisible triggers is when he
 voluntarily  pulls  a large, inviting lever only to discover that it removes
 the only barrier between him and an alien horde. Don't over-use this one.

        
d) We're going to need BIGGER guns.

 The 'immensely powerful-looking gun' trick is so ludicrously  annoying  that
 it  should  only  ever  be  used  once,  if  at  all. Define a really really
 impressive looking weapon and  place  it  somewhere  obvious  but  extremely
 difficult  to  reach.  Only  when the player, after hours of trying, finally
 manages to pick it up,  will  he  discover  that  it  does,  in  fact,  fire
 ping-pong  balls.  For  real  humiliation  make it trigger a horde of aliens
 which the player will confidently attempt to dispatch, failing miserably and
 probably dying in the process.


e) Neighbourhood Watch.

 You've all got one; a weird neighbour who 'keeps  himself  to  himself'  and
 watches  people  through  his  bedroom  window. These slightly disconcerting
 people can now be put to good use  in  TKG.  Stick  one  up  in  an  alcove,
 preferably  near  a  door  the  player will come through. Make him part of a
 team, the rest of whom are waiting in a room down a side corridor.  As  soon
 as  the  watcher sees the player, it will trigger the others. If the watcher
 can shoot, too, it will usefully distract the player while the bulk  of  the
 squad  come running. However, if the player is good (or has played the level
 before), he will pop out and shoot the watcher before he is seen,  then  run
 down and lob a grenade or seven into the room with all his mates in.

        
f) I'm gonna get my big brother on you *sniff*.

 Fill a maze of corridors with small, useless aliens and one  big,  dangerous
 one,  making  them all part of the same team. If the player is seen, all the
 little aliens will converge on him, reporting his position to the big guy.

@node H002 "Zone-rules & Regulations"
 RULES and REGULATIONS for zones.
 --------------------------------

 Please note that these rules is sometimes broken, so that you  can  in  fact
 create zones that breaks these rules. But try and avoid it, they often gives
 problems with the zones.. Please also note that  the  editor  will  try  and
 catch zones breaking most of the rules, but don't be tempted..


1.  Zones MUST ALWAYS be defined by selecting points in CLOCKWISE ORDER.


2.  Zones can have a MAXIMUM of ten sides.

        
3.  Zones MUST ALWAYS be convex.
        
     Definitions of convexity:
      a. A convex shape is one where you can walk all the way around the edge
         and only have to turn in ONE direction.
           
      b. If you draw a straight line between  any  two  points  in  a  convex
         shape, that line will always lie ENTIRELY within the  shape,  ie  it
         will never cross out of the shape and back in again.

        
4.  No zone must ever be visible on more than ONE side of a hole in  the  map
    from any other zone.

    This is a bit trickier to explain, but I'll do my best:
        
        *------------*
        |            |
        |     A      |
        |            |
        *===*----*===*
        |   |    |   |
        | B |HOLE| C |
        |   |    |   |
        *===*----*===*
        |            |
        |     D      |
        |            |
        *------------*

    The shape above consists of FOUR zones A,B,C and D; a large  one  at  the
    top  and  at  the bottom, and two smaller connecting ones on either side,
    with a hole inbetween. The hole DOES NOT count as a zone, even though  it
    is completely surrounded by zones. You can tell that it is a hole and not
    a zone in the level editor because the walls around it are BRIGHT  WHITE,
    indicating  impassable walls, whereas the borders between zones (shown as
    double lines '=' above) will be in grey. The above design is NOT ALLOWED,
    because  zone  A  is visible from zone D on both sides of the hole. There
    are TWO ways of fixing this situation:
        
    a. Delete zones A and D, then add points and zones to get the following:
        
        *---*----*---*
        |   #    #   |
        | A # D  # F |
        |   #    #   |
        *===*----*===*
        |   |    |   |
        | B |HOLE| C |
        |   |    |   |
        *===*----*===*
        |   #    #   |
        | G # H  # I |
        |   #    #   |
        *---*----*---*

    This is legal, because no zone is visible on either side of the hole from
    any other zone.
        
    b. Add one extra zone, covering the hole:
        
        *------------*
        |            |
        |     A      |
        |            |
        *===*====*===*
        |   #    #   |
        | B # E  # C |
        |   #    #   |
        *===*====*===*
        |            |
        |     D      |
        |            |
        *------------*
        
    then change the floor height of zone E to be the same as its roof height,
    or vice versa.
        
    Method a. is good because HOLES in the  map  allow  the  game  to  ignore
    anything  on the other side. Thus, if the player stands in zone H, zone D
    will not be drawn because it  is  invisible  from  anywhere  in  zone  H.
    However,  method  a.  is  not  always  feasable  except in very simple or
    regular patterns of holes. The difficulty involved in  making  sure  this
    rule  is  obeyed in complex rooms is prohibitive. That is why method B is
    often used, despite the  fact  that  it  prevents  the  game  eliminating
    invisible zones; in this case, zone C would be drawn if the player was in
    zone B, despite the fact that zone E completely obscures it.
        

5.  Try to avoid using sharp, pointy zones  when  designing  the  level;  for
    various reasons the game doesn't really like them. If you  find  yourself
    about to add an excessively pointed zone, try rethinking the way you have
    designed the room.

        
6.  Zones MUST NOT contain within them any other zones, or any points be they
    connected or not. One of the most tempting things people try to do is  to
    create a raised pedastle in the following manner:
        
        *-----------------------*
        |                       |
        |                       |
        |     A                 |
        |                       |
        |                       |
        |     *-----------*     |
        |     |           |     |
        |     |           |     |
        |     |    B      |     |
        |     |           |     |
        |     |           |     |
        |     |           |     |
        |     *-----------*     |
        |                       |
        |                       |
        |                       |
        |                       |
        |                       |
        *-----------------------*

    This WILL NOT WORK. If you want such a pedastle you must create it in the
    following way:

        *-----------------------*
        |#                     #|
        | #                   # |
        |  #        B        #  |
        |   #               #   |
