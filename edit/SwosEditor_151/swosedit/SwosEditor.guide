Introduction...
---------------

    This program is a save game editor for the excellent Sensible World of
    Soccer or SWOS as it is better known.

    It has been programmed and updated over the past 18 months.

    I am no longer going to improve this version, instead I have started
    V2.0 which will have many more features and a better interface.

@endnode

@node OTHER

Other SWOS editors Available.
-----------------------------

    To my knowledge there are 2 other editors available. They are SWOSED by
    Piotr Bieniek and SWOSEDIT (Unsure who its by). Anyway these editors are
    different to SWOSEditor because they actually edit the team files which
    come with SWOS, SWOSEditor alters the save-files. All three programs
    have their own advantages and disadvantages, SWOSED & SWOSEDIT don't
    re-crunch their files after editing (It needs Propack which to my
    knowledge has to be bought from Rob Northern computing), which means
    that floppy users need to either have less teams or they need to re-crunch
    it themselves. SWOSEditor doesn't need to re-crunch because the
    save-files are not crunched. Secondly the SWOSED & SWOSEDIT can alter
    files in ANY versions of SWOS where-as I need to keep updating
    SWOSEditor because each save-file has it's offsets at different
    loccations. Finally SWOSEditor can't edit more than one team (Even
    though this will be rectified in version 2.0) only the players team.

    My advice to anybody who is unsure about which they should use then why
    not keep both or all three. I use SWOSED and SWOSEditor. That way you
    have the best of both worlds.

@node REQUIRE "Do I need a Super Amiga?" 
SWOSEditor and SWOSKitEd require:
---------------------------------
       These Editors require the following:

   An Amiga (A bit obvious Really)
   Kickstart v2.04+
   1MB of Chip Memory
   The SWOSED.FONT in FONTS:
   The ReqTools.Library V38+ in LIBS:
   The Diskfont.Library in LIBS: 
   A Sensible World Of Soccer Save Game File.


   All those Kick 1.3 owners out there had better upgrade.
   If I get Enough interest I MIGHT consider doing a 1.3 compatible version

@node WHAT "What the hell does it do then?"

What does it do?
----------------

    This editor allows you to alter various things within your SWOS team.
    Here is a list of things that can be changed. Any option with a + will
    probably have a button within the editor but it won't do anything yet.
    This is because I might not include it.

    The Following can be changed:

        Team Name
        Mangers Name
        Players Names
        Players Attributes
        Players Position
        Players Nationality
        Players Skin/Hair colour
        Money in bank 
        Players values
      # Kit Editor
      + Tactics Editor  (I can't see much use for this but I might write it)

      # Kit Editor is included as a separate program.

    The Following Players Attributes can be changed. The range is 0-15 with
    15 being the maximum.

        Passing
        Shooting
        Heading
        Tackling
        Ball Control
        Speed
        Finishing  (Shot Power)

    I could have included the following but I decided they would probably
    totally spoil the playability of the game:

        Number of Goals Scored by a Player
        Number of Games Won/Drawn/Lost
        League Position
        Points on League Table
        Whether a Player is on LOAN (May be included yet)

    If you would like any of the above including, then write or EMAIL me. If
    I get enough interest in any of the above I will then include it in the
    next version. Also if you have any Ideas on new features then don't
    hesitate to let me know.

@endnode

@node USAGE "So.....How do I use it then?"

How do I use it?
----------------

    Erm. Simple really, you shouldn't need to read this!

    You will be presented with a file requester to select your save game
    file. Select your file it will then be loaded.

    The editor now checks to see which version you are trying to load. if
    it comes across an unknown version then i'd like to know. Then look at
    the following and then contact me. @{" My save-file doesn't load " link PROBS}

    You will now notice 30 buttons arranged into 2 columns on the left
    side of the screen. Next to these buttons are the players names. To
    edit a player depress the button to the left of his name. All his stats
    will then appear in the gadgets in the box on the right.

    The string gadget at the top of this box allows you to edit the players
    name. The next 7 gadgets allow the players personal attributes to be
    changed. The 3 buttons below allow you to change face/hair, position
    and, select what nationality a player is. Clicking on one will bring up
    a window to which you can change the required setting. The nationality
    will firstly let you select the continent and then the country.
    The last button allows you to remove any injuries and/or cards the
    player may have incurred.

 
    The gadgets located along the bottom/right of the screen allow you to
    edit the team name, and money. There are also 4 other buttons:

        Load     - Load a save game file (Will also bring up requester to
                   select version being used).
        Save     - Save a save-game-file
        About    - About the editor
        Iconify  - Iconifies SwosEditor
        Quit     - Oh come on it's obvious


    Finally there are 2 string gadgets located in the bottom right corner.
    These enable you to edit your managers name. The top gadget alters
    his/her forname (Max 8 chars) and the lower gadget alters his/her
    surname (Max 12 chars). I haven't added the option of altering the
    managers nationality (Next version perhaps).

    All the above buttons are also present in the menus.

    
    The two gadgets that were located near the bottom of the screen have
    been replaced with a single burron.

		Change ALL Stats   - Brings up a requester and allows user to enter
                             a new value for the players. This will make
                             ALL the attribtutes of ALL the players
                             whatever the user selects.

@node SWARE "What's Shareware then Bob?"
The Shareware Concept:
----------------------

    Shareware is a concept where you may try a program before registering
    (Paying). This program is shareware but unlike other shareware programs
    it isn't limited in any way. All I ask is if you use it regularly and
    get some enjoyment out of it you to send me something (Anything from
    a postcard to cash, I don't really mind).

    The more people who send me a donation will give me an inclination of
    the size of the Amiga community, I will then decide whether it's worth
    writing more programs.


    (Email is also a good way to register, as it makes me feel good, if you
    like my program.)

@node HISTORY "What has been changed and added.."
SWOSEditor Version History
--------------------------

(20/05/99)
   V1.51 Released

   1). Fixed a bug in the Money Editing (Thanks to Martin Persson)
   2). Code is now 340 Bytes smaller :))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(21/01/98)
   V1.5 Released

    1). Added support for a Very Old version of the game that I was given.
    2). Editor now checks memory to ensure that enough is available for the
        program (Needs about 500k).
    3). Optimised a-lot of the code and replaced it with more compact code
        and some assembler.
    4). Replaced the two buttons at the bottom of the screen with one
        button. This new button brings up a requester for a value between
        1 & 16.
    5). Reworked the Nationality functions. I have removed all the windows
        and buttons that was in earlier versions. These have been replaced
        with a GTListview.
    6). I decided the editor looked a little drab, so it now opens on a
        hi-res, 8 colour screen.
         i).  Changed the SWOSED logo again. Now more colourful
        ii).  Also instead of telling you what colour face or hair you have
             it now displays a little picture.
       iii). The face selection window has also changed, it now displays a
             graphic representation of the face. Simply select the button
             opposite the face you would like.
    6). Added Xtractics to the archive. This allows user to extract tactic
        files from their save game and save it to ram.

    After all the optimisations, additions etc.. the program is a staggering
    26552 bytes smaller before crunching :-)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(13/12/97)
   V1.4a Released

    1). Fixed an unseen bug in v1.4 only; which crashes the machine when a
        continent was selected. The program was tring to free unused GadLists :(
        Now works fine ;-D

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
(17/09/97)
   V1.4 Released

    1). Added support for the '96/'97 version
    2). Editor now checks to see which version of the save-file you use.
        This removes the requester at the beginning, making it easier to
        use. If it finds a version it doesn't recognise then it will tell
        you.
    3). Removed 2 bugs associated with the managers name.. You would enter
        the name and the editor would place the new name at the beginning
        of the file. This was a stupid error on my behalf, and has now been
        completely eradicated (well I hope so anyway).
    4). Replaced some of the code with asm instructions and also optimised
        the code slightly.
    5). Changed the logo on the panel at the bottom of the screen.
    6). Added two new buttons which allow you to put All Player attributes to
        a maximum or minimum. (will add option of setting the value in
        next update (v1.5))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(20/06/96)
   V1.31 Released

    1). Added the option to edit the NEW Swos 1995/1996 European
        Championship Edition.
    2). Removed a incy wincy little bug -- When you select to load a save
        file and then press cancel in the file-requester, another requester
        pops up asking if you would like to try again or CANCEL. Upon
        selecting CANCEL the editor used to quit. It will ONLY quit if you
        have not previously loaded a save file. It will return you to your
        previous file if you have one loaded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(16/04/96)
   V1.3 Released

    1). Players Values can now be edited ( At Last :-D )
    2). Added Iconify button. (Maybe pointless but all other progs have
        them).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(14/03/96)
   V1.22.1 released

   No major update. I just positioned and resized some of the gadgets.
   When Sysihack, Framihack and Urouhack are used the text is now properly
   positioned. Simply cosmetic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(11-02-96)
   V1.22 released

    1). Replaced the cruddy ASL requesters with Nico François' excellent
        Reqtools Requesters.
    
    2). The file SWOSEdInc is no longer needed instead it has been included
        within the executable binary.

    3). Added more gaming information to the About requester. 

    4). Finally Finished the Kit Editor. Included within the archive as a
        separate file. Sorry to say it doesn't work on pre-aga machines yet

    5). Because of some stupidness on my behalf all versions prior to this
        one wouldn't work on a 500+ or 600. This has now been fixed and the
        program should now run on all Amigas' with Kickstart v2.04+

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(03-01-96)
   V1.21 released

   Fixed a couple of silly bugs:

   1). ASL File Requester opened on Workbench instead of the SWOSEditor
       Screen. Now opens on the SWOSEditor screen.

   2). A Small bug in the editing of the team name caused the team name to
       have the letter of the original name remaining. EG. If you changed
       NEWCASTLE UNITED to SPLOGS ATHLETIC the editor would save the name
       as NSPLOGS ATHLETIC.

   3). Checks to see if the SWOSED.font is in FONTS: and the ASL.LIBRARY is
       in LIBS:

   4). A small oversight on my behalf meant that any save file which is
       embedded deep within a directory structure would cause the
       information within the Info box to spread out into the gadgets on
       the right. So I have removed the information box. Instead I have
       replaced it with a logo. The information has not been deleted it
       has simply moved into the ABOUT requester.

   5). Removed the INSTALL program from the archive. Now uses Commodore's
       Installer utility.

   6). Included AmigaGUIDE documents.

   7). Cursor now moves into the next string gadget when changing stats.
       This removed the need to select each one with the mouse.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(27-12-95)
   V1.2 released

   Combined V1.1 and V95/96 into one program. It is now about 10k larger
   than either of the other versions and about 85k smaller than the other
   versions added together.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(25-12-95)
   V95/96 released:

   A version specifically for the 95/96 version of SWOS. Otherwise the same

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(23-12-95)
   Bought SWOS '95/'96 update and played with it.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(12-12-95)
   V1.1 released.

   Added the info box at the bottom
   Fixed another bug with the save option.
   Allows user to save a file with LOWERCASE letters and it converts it to
   UPPERCASE
   Adds the .CAR to the Save file if user forgets it.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2-12-95)
   V1.0 finished added the following:

   New screen layout.
   Ability to alter managers name
   alter player attributes
   remove bookings/injuries
   change money
   rename team
   Automatically converts all data to UPPERCASE (This was important)

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(27-11-95)
   Removed a save bug (Sometimes wouldn't save)

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(25-11-95)
   Beta test version (v0.9) finished. (Not Released)
   Could only alter player names

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

(22-11-95)
   Idea concieved. Preparation and ideas

@node FUTURE "What's on the horizon now?"

The Future.
-----------

    I am currently working on a couple of new projects they should be
    finished shortly, they are:

    SwosEditor v2.0   -  New version featuring a newer better interface
                         that uses Listviews and Cycle gadgets. It will
                         also have all the things I couldn't fit or be
                         bothered to include in the current versions.
                         (About 15% Complete (Just implementing the GUI).

                         I have stopped all development on this version as
                         SWOSEditor fulfills all of my needs.

                         If anybody would like me to finish this then
                         please write to me. If I get 30+ letters I will
                         CONSIDER finishing it.

                         I have included a VERY EARLY demo version for
                         viewing

                         Feature List:

                       - Edit any team within the save file
                       - Edit abilities for Every Player in Save file
                       - Edit values, Goals scored, Injuries & Bookings for
                         every player
                       - Swap players from team to team
                       - option of adding/deleting players
                       - editing of games pld,won,drawn,lost & points
                       - Editing ALL manager stats (Including Managers
                         Record).
                       - and lots, lots more.

    Remeber I will ONLY finish this if I get enough interest.

    Finally Thanks to Martin Persson for the Cash bug :))

    And to all the Amiga owners who have helped keep the machine alive. If
    it wasn't for people like you the Amiga would be dead. Stick with the
    Amiga and if a Software House stops supporting the Amiga then write to
    them. If they still say NO then it's their loss.

    If you have this program yet you don't possess SWOS then buy it NOW.
    You don't know what you're missing.

@node PROBS "I've got a different version"

    There are a few versions of SWOS floating around this editor currently
    only supports four versions. The version numbers are held within the
    save game file and the main SWOS files. The editor currently supports
    the following versions:

    CJ0612235###    Original
    CJ0112114###    95-96
    CJ1804215###    European
    CJ1061114###    96-97

    The hashes are not important they have something to do with what
    machine the game was loaded into.

    If you have a different version to those supported the editor will tell
    you. Send a copy of your save game file and 3 pounds Sterling to cover
    postage and packing @{" to me " link CONTACT}.
    also include the following information:

    Name of your team.
    Name of the Manager.  (Important for finding location of team)
    Amount of money in your bank account


    I will then update the editor and send you the new version which will
    enable you to edit your save files.

@node TECH "Some intiguing info"

Technical Information
---------------------

    There seems to be a problem with the WTITLE command in Blitz. It
    doesn't seem to want to work on any Kickstart v2.04 machines. If
    anybody has any idea why I would be eternally grateful if you let me
    know.

    Blitz 2 was used to program this editor (don't knock Blitz it's great)
    Deluxe Paint 4/5 was used to create the Graphics and design the
    interface.
    Personal Fonts Maker v2 was used to create the Swosed Font.
    Zap was used to suss out the save files.


Information on the Swos-Save files

    Each player in Swos is allocated about 38 bytes. These 38 bytes hold 
    all the details about a player i.e. Shirt number, value, attributes
    etc.... Below are some values I've used within the editor.

    The position of the first player is actually the players nationality if
    you move 38 bytes through the file you will be positioned on player 2's
    nationality. The attributes are about 22 bytes in from the start of a
    players data. it can be recognised if the player is not injured or
    booked by the following ##000#######?? the first two hashes are the
    players skin/hair colour and also his chosen position. The next two
    numbers (Usually 0) hold details on whether a player is booked or
    injured, and finally the 7 hashes that follow are the players
    attributes. Straight after the attributes you have got the players
    value (represented by ??). I haven't figured out exactly how swos
    handles the values yet but as-soon-as I do I will incorporate it into
    the editor.
    
    I will put kit info in when I have more time it's 4.55am and I'm
    knackered :(

    Well this is all I can be bothered to type for-now below are the file
    offsets for the players details.

@toc KITED
Introduction.
-------------

    The SWOSKitEd has been written to allow the user to easily change
    his/her teams kits for the game SWOS.

    It has been included as a separate program to the main editor as to
    allow easier and quicker access and usage.

@endnode

@node USAGE2 "How to use the Kit Editor"
@toc KITED
Usage.
------

    when you first load a  file-requester will appear for you to select
    your CAREER. Once loaded you will be presented with 8 buttons (4 have
    pictures of shirts on them). A palette selecter, a display of the kit,
    and a cycle gadget.

    They do the following:

    Cycle Gadget:    Change between editing your Home/Away kits
    Shirt Gadgets:   Choose the different types of shirt supported by SWOS
    Load Gadget:     Load another career for editing
    Save Gadget:     Save career with new kit colours
    About Gadget:    Some info about program
    Quit Gadget:     Quit program

    Palette:         On selecting this you will be presented with another
                     requester. The requester allows the following:

               Shirt:    Select shirt as the chosen colour
               Stripe:   Select the Stripe (2nd shirt colour) as the chosen
                         colour
               Shorts:   Select chosen colour for shorts
               Socks:    Select chosen colour for socks
               Cancel:   Forget operation

                      Also only the last 9 colours on the palette can be
                      selected. This is due to the fact SWOS only allows
                      editing of 10 colours. I have scrapped the Grey
                      colour. (I will return it later I promise)

History.

(11-02-96)
   V1.0 Initally released.

(14-03-96)
   V1.01 released.

   Minor update. Changed the size and position of the gadgets. The program
   now looks okay if used with Sysihack, Framihack, and Uroukhack

(20-06-96)
   V1.1 Released.

   Supports the New 1995/1996 European Championship Edition

(30-10-97)
   V1.3 Released (Where's v1.2 ????)

   After 1 year and 4 Months I finally update it :)

   1). The code is tidier and smaller 1356 bytes to be exact (and it has
       more features :D)

   2). Works with the 1996/'97 version now  (all versions supported by SWOSEditor)

   3). Checks to see which version is loaded (No longer asks user)

   4). Used some Assembler to speed things up

   5). V1.1 didn't actually work properly, for some reason the file offsets
       from v1.0 to v1.1 had changed ?? very strange that!!

       It's taken me 4-5 hrs to update this cuz my HD went down about 6
       months ago, and although I thought I'd recovered most of it I lost
       ALL the Graphic files for this editor. I spent most of the night
       trying to figure out how I did it.. (I don't document my code ; I'm lazy)
