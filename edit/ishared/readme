This is the Ishar III save file editor.

With this you can edit atributes of your persons in Ishar III.
(level,gold,experience ...)
It can be very usefull for people who can't end this game or who would't
train his party ( it can take a long time)

Till now I don't know,how to find the race & the class of characters
in the save file,so this is not implemented in this version of editor.

By the wizards & clerics don't set the level 30 because they can cast spells
with a high level and this take o lot of psychic energy.
The recommended level is about 24 and 25.
