                COLONIAL CONQUEST II - PLANET EDITOR
                ====================================

    Colonial Conquest II - Planet Editor was written and compiled in AMOS
    by JIPsoft alias Joona Palaste in 1995.
    Colonial Conquest is (C) copyright 1993, 1994 by Christian Mumenthaler.
    This is not the official planet editor, but a "pirate" version.
    The author of this editor is not responsible from any physical/logical
    damage this program and/or Christian Mumenthaler might cause to anyone.


Some time ago, I found out the structure of Colonial Conquest II's planet
files. And I thought that I'd make a planet editor. So I did. Here are the
instructions.

When you first boot the editor (hereafter known as CC2_Ed), you will see its
main (and only) screen. Here you can edit/create a planet, save/load planets to
disk, and quit the program.
  To edit planets, all you need to know is:
    - You can select your terrains for the left and right mouse buttons from
the block of terrains to the right of the edit area. (But why did Christian
include two versions of the oily swamp?)
    - You can draw points and filled/unfilled squares. To draw points, just
click on the edit area. To draw squares, first click on one of the corners and
then the opposite one.
    - Drawing modes are selectable from the Icon Control Panel. Choosing any
drawing mode erases any selected square corner from memory.

To save/load planets, click on the disk buttons and choose the filename. If you
are saving a planet that does not exist yet on the disk, you are given the
oppoturnity to automatically add it to the Planetlist. Just press Y and the
program will take care of it.
  You can, of course, add the planet to the Planetlist manually. Here's how:
  The Planetlist is a simple ASCII file made of rows. The first row begins with
a space, and then comes the number of planets in the list (in decimal). Then
come the names of the planet files. They should be in the same directory as the
Planetlist. Notice that the EOF characters must be CRLF, instead of standard
Amiga LF.

To quit, just click on the skull button and press Y. The ? button displays
CC2_Ed's copyright message.

NOTE: I know that by distributing a "pirate" planet editor, I am robbing poor
Christian Mumenthaler of his bread, because now his official editor won't sell
so much.
  So I give something to Christian in return: I hereby announce that Christian
Mumenthaler has the freedom to hack into any of my (JIPsoft's) games' files and
customise them. He is free to distribute any editors he might choose to make of
my games' files on AmiNet or PD libraries, and charge as much as he likes.
  IMPORTANT: This offer ONLY concerns Christian Mumenthaler (and me of course).
If you are one of the 4'999'999'998 people that are not either of us, you won't
be allowed to hack into my games' files.

CC2_Ed is freely distributable, but it remains under my copyright. No one
(except Christian Mumenthaler) is allowed to change it without my permission.

Bye then, luvvies. My address is as follows:

I won't include Christian's address. To see that, check the Colonial Conquest
II docs.
