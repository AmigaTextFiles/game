- AB3D II - The Killing Grounds Scenario TEXT editor by David Gibbs -
    - This is for use with the editor package supplied with TKG -


Using TEXTED
-------------------
To use the program you will need to UNCRUNCH the file TEXT_FILE in the
ab3:Includes/ directory. by typing DTF <RETURN>.  This script file will
run the XFDDECRUNCH program on the file.

now use the TEXTED program, it looks for 
 
  (1)  AB3:Includes/TEXT_FILE
  (2)  AB3:Includes/TEST.LNK  (just looks for LEVEL names)

Use the CURSOR keys OR Mouse to select level.
You will be then shown the text for that level..use cursor/mouse to select
line you wish to either DELETE (press D) or CHANGE (click LMB or ENTER).

Once you have finished, Press ESCAPE, if you HAVE changed, a requester
asking you to either set the changes or abandon them.

Press S on the Level Selection screen to SAVE (auto quits)..
Once you have done this, re-pack the archive using 

PACKLHA includes/TEXT_FILE

Now your text will be added to each level description/scenario.
Thats it....  


AB3D editing NOTES..

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LEVED
-----
If LEVED crashes when you either try to CLIP your level or SAVE it, you have
a problem with the LAYOUT of your level (walls not set either side).  This is
not a bug with it, its you layout at fault..

To position the EXIT (end) at any zone press E in the selected zone.
To Position P2 (linkup) right mouse button in the required zone, it DOES
NOT show you where it put it. (Andy Clithroe told me this was so...)

The DELETE points does not WORK for a reason (andy again..) creates more
havoc than its worth (just move points to a empty section.

Other
-----
You can use the ORIGNAL VECTOR OBJECTS in the game (4Mb) but you cannot
edit them..!!!!

To convert BITMAP object graphics, use 256obj, using FRAME sizing (128x64)
for left to right..

Extra notes.
------------

When viewing them in the GAME, they will be CENTRED automatically.

Please Note : I have noticed in the README file of XFDDECRUNCH archive, 
that he doesnt mind non-commercial use of XFDDECRUNCH, I havent included
the other files, as to try and conserve space and make this a small LHA
archive to download.  For the full package see AMINET/util/pack/XFD113.* !


Non-commercial use of these programs is due to that they are intended to
help users of the AB3D II-TKG editors package, to get greater customization
of their levels.  The editors and convertors are so UN-Friendly !!!..
