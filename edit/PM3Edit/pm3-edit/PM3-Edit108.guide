@endnode

@node "Moti" "Motivation"
What will it do ?
-----------------
 - You can change names, skills, ages, etc. of players.
 - You can change club-data (Names, Money)..
 - You can change your stadium equipment..
 - Changes your workers data..
 - Works on both managers in 2-player mode..
 - Quick-functions to make team perfect/useless..

Why will it do it ?
-------------------
 Well I got anoyed with the 'official' editor as it screws up my stadium
 every time I use it, also I hate Man.Utd. (That arrogant goalkeeper) and
 it takes a heck of a time to knock that team down with the editor. Also
 the 'official' editor only works at the start of season, but when 7 players
 in my team was injured mid-season I almost lost everything... So that's
 why I made up my own editor, as it works all times at season than you
 can't swap teams in the league (yet), but it won't destroy your stadium,
 and it'll make a team useless with a single click (or perfect)..
@endnode

@node "Load" "Loading A Game"
 Load a save-game from HD.
 -------------------------
 Select the 'HD-load' from the menu then you'll be asked to select the save-
 game from disc, the editor will try to find the AGA-verz of the game on a
 harddrive, the game has to have be run before to make this work, (The
 editor looks for the assign to the AGA-game) If not found the editor will
 start out in it's own directory simply find the right one and select your
 save-game.
 The pattern of the selector is set to only show the savegames, you can change
 this if you'd like.
 If the game is loaded correct you'll enter the Team-selection screen.. If not
 the editor will exit to the front screen.

 Loading A Disc-saved game (*NEW in 1.08).
 -----------------------------------------
 PM3 saves it's games to floppy in a non-standard format, it took some work
 to get it right but here it works. Select the drive you wish to load your
 game from, then you'll be prompted to insert the save-game disc into the
 drive, select the savegame you'd like to edit, then just sit back and wait
 for the thing to load..
@endnode

@node "Team" "The Selecting a team"
 The Team-selection screen.
 --------------------------
 Here you simply select a team to edit, you can't do much else here, at the
 top of the screen is 3 buttons to choose various menus for the Manager(s)
 in the game. If you select a team you'll be taken to the club-edit screen.
 The save-functions is also on this screen, simply save the game when you're
 done and the editor will exit to WB. If you'd made a mistake in the editor
 then quit the editor and restart it again. Note that the list of teams is
 shown in the order they're found in the data-files, this is often quite a
 mess, I hope to include some sort of sorting procedure soon.
@endnode

@node "Club" "The club edit screen"
 The Club-Edit screens.
 ---------------------

 Top-line Buttons:
  - X       : Returns you to the team-selection screen
  - Club    : Does nothing, as this it the screen you're watching
  - Player  : Calls the @{" Players edit screen " link "Play"}

 The Editfields:
  - Team    : Name of the club
  - Manager : Name of the manager
  - Stadium : Name of the home-field
  - Capacity: The capacity of the stadium (0->99999)
  - Average : The average crowd at matches (0->99999)
  - Money   : The acount of the club.

 NOTES:
  - If you're editing your own club, note that you can change manager-name
    in the @{" Manager screen " link "Mana"} too..
  - When changing the capacity of your own club, thet won't have any effect
    on the actual crow at your games, as they are calculated from the
    installed seats, not the number on this screen, so if you have made many
    seats without changing the capacity, you might end up with an average
    larger than the capacity in the match-status. The seats are changed
    using the @{" Manager screen " link "Mana"}..
  - The amount of money may be less than 0..
  - By raising the average number, you'll get more people to watch your
    matches

 The second is the players-screen, you can edit their skills and names as
 you like, select a player and enter the new values, if you know the game
 you should know what the various letters means. There are 2 special buttons
 at the top-right that alows you to make the team perfect/useless, Note that
 the perfect-button ALSO removes injuries and bannes. Note that it takes a
 match before some of the information is active, eg. the top-scorelist is
 only updated after matches..
@endnode

@node "Play" "Players screen"
 The Club-Edit screens.
 ---------------------

 Buttons:
  - X       : Returns you to the team-selection screen
  - Club    : Calls the @{" Club-edit screen " link "Club"}
  - Player  : No action, calls the screen you're watching
  - Perfect : Makes all the players perfect (see notes)
  - Useless : Makes all the players useless (see notes)

 Select a player to activate the edit-fields below the selector, then
 enter the new skills you'd like the player to have..
  - Name
  - HN      : Handle skill   (0-99)
  - TK      : Tackle skill   (0-99)
  - PS      : Pasing skill   (0-99)
  - SH      : Shooting skill (0-99)
  - HD      : Heading skill  (0-99)
  - CR      : Controle       (0-99)
  - FT      : Fit            (0-99)
  - AG      : Age            (0-60) (17-30 is recomended)
  - A       : Agression      (0-9)
  - M       : Morale         (0-9)
  - F       : Foot (Circle field: L(eft), R(ight), B(oth), A(ny))
  - GAM     : Games played this season
  - GOA     : Goals this season
  - CNC     : Conceeded this season
  - C       : Contract       (0-7)
  - WAGE    : Pay him off ;-)

 NOTES:
  - Don't know what they mean by any foot, but it works well
  - USELESS sets: All skills to 1, agression & morale to 1, Foot to right
                  and wage & insurence very high
  - PERFECT sets: All skills to 99, agression & morale to 9, Foot to any,
                  Age to 20, Contract to 7, best insurence (at a price of
                  20), wage to 100 and removes injuries and bannes.
@endnode

@node "Mana" "The manager-editor"
 The Manager screen.
 -------------------
 There are 2 managers availeble, but if only one is active, choosing the
 other will simply end up with an empty screen.
 First you have your name :-), as a reminder the editor shows what team
 you control, you can't change that (yet.) as it seams to screw up the
 game..
 Then your workers, assistant etc. this editor can't create new workers
 for you but you can edit the ones you have. If a name-field is empty
 then there won't be a worker in that position. The skills are entered
 just as the players (1=Fair, 99=Ultimate), while the ages are a little
 more spooky, they only range from 40->56. The type of worker is only
 shown for information (When changed the game crashes, so I disabled that).
 Note that you can't define the wage of the workers, it's calculated from
 the skill of the worker, so making the workers better, also rises the
 amount you have to pay them.
 The rest of the screen is dedicated to the facilities of your stadium,
 seats, type of seats, lights etc. Simply change them as you'd like, note
 that it takes a match (at the field) before the changes are reflected in
 the rating of the stadium. Also notice that changing the capacity of the
 stands don't change the number set it your club-info, see the club-edit
 screens for more info on that, but you'll still be able to fill your field
 with people. There is a funny thing about the stadium, you can actualy
 change the name of the stands, instead of North, South, etc. you can make
 up your own names..

 *NEW in 1.08: Click the club name to go to the edit-club-screen..

@endnode

NOTES:
------
 The editor is programed to be 'inteligent' and thereby cutting wrong values
 to legal values, so if you enter something wild the editor will put it
 inside the limits set by the game. I've tried all options on my own games
 and they work just fine, but that does not cover for unseen trouble..
 The editor does not try and alter to deep in the data, and preferes to let
 the game update it's own data, that means some consequences may not be seen
 until a match has been played..
