V1.00 05-01-94
--------------
A crude text version of the editor. Does not allow editing of team names,
only player names, height, number and attributes. Routines are poor and slow
but it does work and does allow editing of teams. Doesn't do any checking of
input values.

Not released.

V2.00 05-01-94
--------------
First GUI version. Very slow! Uses doublebuffering and redraws the entire
screen after very change. It does work and provides the screen layout for
future versions. Team names can also be edited.

Not released.

V2.01 05-01-94
--------------
Still very slow but has improved team and player name editing routines but
does not have any backspace nor return for editing.

Not released.

V2.10 06-01-94
--------------
That's better! A bit of speed now makes the program usable. Instead of doing
complete screen redraws it undraws highlights and then redraws the new
highlights. It is not perfect but is a huge improvement. Still not very good
name editing. Also has some bugs which may allow a faulty data file to be
written which will produce unpredictable effects within the game.

Not released.

V2.11 08-01-94
--------------
Slight improvement with highlighting - doesn't unhighlight then rehighlight
the same selection. No bugs in the data file anymore.

Not released.

V2.12 18-01-94
--------------
Improved highlighting a bit more. Name editing is now perfect although
selecting a name to edit does clear the name which may not suit everybody.
Redefined control keys, added coach name and placed labels next to attributes
and for player positions. Also has the option to quit without saving.

Not released.

V2.20 17-07-94
--------------
Decided to change the screen layout so now the attributes of all the players
in the chosen team are displayed at the same time - this slows updates
marginally. Keys are redefined to be much more intuitive. Labels of
attributes have disappeared but will return. Now has a save button rather
than the choose of exiting or exiting and saving.

Not released.

V2.21 21-07-94
--------------
Has a better and more compact screen updating routine which is faster and
provides for future additions to the GUI.

Not released.

V2.22 31-07-94
--------------
Labels have returned to attributes.
