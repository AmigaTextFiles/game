                            What is ReunionEd ?
                            -------------------


With ReunionEd you can change your savefiles to the game Reunion.
You can easily add money, ships, lasers and more with just a few mouseclicks!


                               Installation
                               ------------

Just copy the main program to anywhere you like, C: recommended and you're
done. Easy huh? :-)



-----
Usage
-----


   To start ReunionEd simply doubleclick it's icon or type `run ReunionEd'
from a Shell. After ReunionEd has started you must choose a savefile to load
(Reunion/Save/SaveGame.???).

These are the things you can alter with ReunionEd:

AirCraft             Battle Tank             Cruiser
Destroyer            Detoxin                 Energon
Galleon              Hunter                  Kremia
Laser Cannon         Lepitium                Miner Droid
Miner Station        Missile                 Missile Launcher
Money                Pirate Ship             Plasma Gun
Raenium              Satellite               Satellite Carrier
Solar Plant          Space Station           Spy Satellite
Spy Ship             StarFighter             Texon
Trade Ship           Transfer Ship           Trooper
Twin Laser Gun

As you can see you can alter just about anything within the game.
However, if you save early in the game, and you try to add things which
you haven't developed yet the requestor will tell you that. And the new
value you typed will _not_ be available to you until you develop the item.
So, it's vital that you first develop the item, then alter how many you have.

When you're ready, just press the `Save' button. Now you can start Reunion
again with lots of things! :-)
