  My first missions on GunShip2000 were terrible; 2 missions and a long distance to go.
  Because I was flying alone, I was shot down very soon. And unless you got promoted to 2LT,
  you still had to fly alone, instead of doing a fast mission with 5 men.
  Somehow I discovered how to change the bits in the roster.dat file and changed it with a Filezapper.
  It was going very well, but I still wasn't satisfied (every time I promoted to BG, I had to load the
  zapper and change it AGAIN :). Then I 쳀inally decided to make an editor for it in AmosPro.
  After about 2 weeks, I started programming this editor in C, from scratch.
  It's now a lot faster, smaller, easier to use and there are more options.

@{JCENTER}And @{i}hastalafiestababy@{ui} here it is.

@{b}GSEditor@{ub} requires an Amiga (surprise,surprise) with at least V37 and a Gunship2000 roster file.
It also needs the @{b}asl.library@{ub}, @{b}gadtools.library@{ub} and @{b}ReqTools.library@{ub}.

With @{b}GSEditor@{ub} you can change the Name, Unitname, ranking and the medals of the @{b}active@{ub} pilot.

You can control the editor by pressing a few buttons or selecting a menuitem.
When starting, there are only a few options available:
@{i}* New @{ui}
@{b}* Load @{ub}
@{i}@{b}* About @{ui}@{ub}
@{u}* Quit @{uu}
      
When starting the default path/filename is @{i}dh1:gs2000/roster.dat@{ui} and
the default save path/filename is @{u}@{b}RAM:dumroster.dat@{uu}@{ub}
but you can change this by editing the @{"ToolTypes" link ToolTypes}.
After loading all the options become available, including:

@{b}*Save
*Name
*Unitname
*Rank selecting
*Medal sliders@{ub}

  GSE has as loading default 'DH1:GS2000/roster.dat' and as saving default 'RAM:dumroster.dat'.
  This is done to ensure that the original file isn't overwritten. Better save it to ram:,
  change the original filename and copy the modified file from ram:.
  You can set your own setting by changing the @{b}TOOLTYPES@{ub}.

  @{b} LOADNAME@{ub}  Set a path & filename for loading.
  @{b} SAVENAME@{ub}  Set a path & filename for saving.
    You should ALWAYS give the path and filename.
    Ex: @{i}LOADNAME=DH1:GS2000/roster.dat@{ui}
  @{b} AREA@{ub}  Set the BackFill Area. You can choose from 0 - 2. TRY IT !!! (>8-))
  @{b} SCREENFONT@{ub} Set to TRUE or something else. This is handy if your screenfont
    is larger than 8 or 9 (or crashes), so you don't have to set the prefs to a smaller one.

  I've tried GSE with Sapphire/19 as ScreenFont. It crashed !!!
  Solution:
  Set the @{"ToolType" link ToolTypes} SCREENFONT to FALSE. Now it should work.
  Blame the manufacturer, The System or whatever for this (but not ME !!!).
