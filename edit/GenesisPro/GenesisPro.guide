@{b}What is GenesisPro ?@{ub}

GenesisPro is a 3D Level Editor, that is usable
for Dungeonmaster style and Wolfenstein 3D style/DOOM
style games (it does not feature not-rectangular walls,
but it DOES feature floors of different heigh).

This Editor was mainly done out of three reasons. The
original version was done to create levels for the
never finished game "Genesis" of Alex Grasso. This
version was done to create levels for my game "Darkchild"
and to show the features of the rtgmaster.library


@endnode

@node inst "Installation"
@toc Main

@{b}Installation@{ub}

1. Copy all .GIF and .IFF files to a directory
2. Copy the files GenesisPro and Data.AGA (and
   their .info files) to the same directory.
3. Copy these Docs to the Directory.
4. Install the font that is in this archive to fonts:
5. Install the libs in this archive to libs:, if you
   do not already have later versions.

   rtgmaster.library V9 (and sublibraries and c2p
   algorithms)
   iff.library V23
   superview.library V11
6. Assign Genesis: <Directory of GenesisPro>
7. Installation finished :) (Well, if you are
   an AGA user, then get sure, that devs:monitors/PAL
   is installed). If you want to use anything else than
   320x256 8 Bit for GenesisPro, you will have to use
   NewMode to promote it to your ScreenMode. Promotion
   under CyberGraphX might give you some really strange
   results :).

@endnode

@node first "First Steps"
@toc Main

Start GenesisPro. You will see a Screenmode Requester,
where you can choose a Screenmode. Ignore the c2p Settings,
they are not needed for this Program. After you saved the
Screenmoderequester Preferences, the Screenmode Requester
only will appear again at startup, if you press SHIFT,
when you start the program, like usual for rtgmaster.library.
Note, that the programs stores its Screenmode information
in the directory, from where you started it, so you should
ALWAYS start it from the directory where it is installed,
else the Screenmode-Requester will appear, even if you
already configured it. The Screenmode Preferences are
saved in the file Screenmode.Prefs.

You can start GenesisPro from Shell or from Workbench.
AGA-Users should take care, that the devs:monitors/PAL
and/or devs:monitors/NTSC files are installed, else
GenesisPro won't run. GenesisPro runs on AGA systems
and on CyberGraphX systems. CyberGraphX users have
to define a 320x256 8 Bit Screenmode.

Now, if you finally entered GenesisPro, you will see
a Lowres Screen with the following parts :

- A Dungeon Window
- Some more Windows, that do not have a function
  up to now (might change in future versions, though)
- A bank of gadgets

  * The buttons from 0 to 6 are for choosing a wall
    texture. Up to now textures 2-6 are not defined
    and will create invisible walls. Will change in
    the future.

  * The buttons from 0 to 9 are for choosing object
    and monster graphics. Not yet implemented.

  * The GO/ED button is for switching between GO and
    EDIT mode. More on that later. Default is EDIT
    mode.

  * The FL button (default : OFF) is for entering
    floor mode. If you activate it, you only can
    walk on places where a floor is already set.
    Also, you can't fly (see below).

  * The LL button determins the state of the LET LIVE
    flag. See below. Its default is OFF.

  * The KO button determins the KOLLISION STATE (see
    below). It's default is ON.

  * The Square Button is used to create a square in
    front of you (a dungeon consists of a LOT of
    squares).

  * The crossed Square Button is used to delete the
    last set Square again. You can't delete the last
    two of them by pressing it twice, though.

- By moving around the mouse pointer in the Dungeon Window
  you can :

  * GO mode : Walk around
  * EDIT mode : Shift the last created Square around

- By pressing the texture buttons, you can modify the
  texture of the last created square, and of all squares
  created LATER.

- You will see coordinates for your position and the
  position of the last created/deleted Square at the
  low part of the Screen.

@node fea "Expanded Features"
@toc Main

@{b}Expanded Features@{ub}

GenesisPro contains some features to make editing
easier.

- If you enable the LET LIVE mode, using the LL Gadget,
  and move around Squares, the Square will be set at
  the NEW position. but it won't be deleted at the OLD
  position anymore. This way you can do a whole WALL or
  ROOM in very short time.

- The KO button determins, if the KOLLISION CHECK is turned
  on. If you turn it OFF, you can shift Squares over each
  other. LL ON and KO OFF sometimes are useful.

- If you are tired by one-level rooms, try pressing the
  right mousebutton, while you are in GO mode and while
  the pointer ponts up or down. And you will fly up or down.

  Note that it is possible to create an engine where you
  can turn around in full 3D with GenesisPro Level files.
  The Engine integrated in the editor does not feature it,
  that's all :)

- With turning ON the FLOOR MODE (FL button), you only can
  walk where already a floor texture is. Useful to prevent
  going off beyond the dungeon, with some misplaced mouseclicks.
  I usually let it turned off, though.

- Have a look at the keyboard shortcuts. Especially the possibility
  to walk around in EDIT mode with the keyboard and set and delete
  Squares with the + and - keys are quite useful.

@endnode

@node keys "Keyboard"
@toc Main

@{ub}Keyboard@{uu}

Shortcuts and Keyboard stuff :

q = Quit
s = Save
l = Load
o = Load a dungeon in the format of the OLD
    Genesis Editor (looked a bit different).
    When you save it again, it will be saved
    in the new format.
c = Clear the Dungeon.

Saving and Loading now uses Filerequesters.
You will be asked, if you really want to overwrite
an already existing file/quit/clear the Dungeon.
your filenames should end with .DAT, or you will
get strange results. (There are three files, that
will be saved, the mainfile with .DAT and two
small data files with .DIR and .POS, where Direction
and Position are saved).

+ = Create a Square (like the button)
- = Delete last Square (like the button)

Numberblock :

 7                   8                9

 Turn Left     Walk Forward      Turn Right


 4                   5                6

 Sidestep Left   Turn around     Sidestep Right



                     2

               Walk Backward


These keys will ALWAYS work in GO MODE, EVEN in EDIT
MODE (for walking around in EDIT MODE). They are also
available with the normal number keys.

Arrow Left  = Sidestep Left
Arrow Right = Sidestep Right
Arrow Up    = Fly Up
Arrow Down  = Fly Down

F1          = Display Background0 (won't be saved up to now)
F2          = Display Background1
F3          = Display Background2
F4          = Display Background3
F5          = Display Background1 (for Alex, his F2 Key is out of order :) )

@endnode

@node imp "Implementation Notes"
@toc main

@{b}Implementation Notes@{ub}

This program is definitely NOT, how an rtgmaster.library
program should look. It is a DIRTY HACK, messing around
with private rtgmaster structures. DON'T DO THAT, if you
code using rtgmaster yourselves... i created it, i CAN
do it :) But it's not nice...

Also, the AGA Support is not integrated in the main file,
but a seperate program instead... well, the original
Genesis editor source looked like a real MESS, not commented
and all... i REALLY had some problems porting it to rtgmaster,
and that's why it is the way it is.

Don't look at this as a perfect example of rtgmaster
programming. It is NOT (it even does slow p2c garbage
and all other sorts of things that one should NOT do).
But it does the job, and for an engine with THAT SMALL
Dungeonsize the p2c does not create a noticable slowdown.

My game "Darkchild" won't be done this dirty way. It will
be done fine (and supporting ALL Workbench Emulations,
not like this editor that only supports AGA and CyberGraphX).

@endnode

@node data "Data Format"
@toc main

@{b}Data Format@{ub}

The Data Format of GenesisPro consists of three files :

Dungeon.DAT

a 60x60x60 Array (you can't reach the very corners of
the thing, though. You HAVE 49x49x49 for usage).

Dungeon.DIR

contains the direction in that the player is looking,
as simple char ("N","S","W" or "O"). (O is "Osten",
the german word for "East", and i did not change this
to English from Alex Grasso's original Genesis Editor).

Dungeon.POS

The position of the player in the array (if the player
is at (10,12,13), it is 10*3600+12*60+13-1. (x,y,z),
where x is from west to east, y from south to north,
z from down to up.

@node lic "Licensing the Engine"
@toc main

@{b}Licensing the Engine@{ub}

Well, in case someone is interested in licensing this or
the big engine on that i am working currently : It is
possible !!! (Mail me at MagicSN@Birdland.es.bawue.de for
details).

Features of the still unfinished "big" engine :

- 640x480 or 640x512 Screensize
- Dungeonsize 460x298
- Free 3D Movement (but no Texturemapping)
  Climbing, Flying, Turning around, everything
  is possible
- Runs on CyberGraphX, AGA, EGS and Picasso II
- Easy to put in own code
- 256 colors
- uses rtgmaster.library

Of course i won't sell "exclusive rights", as i
want to put it in my OWN game. But probably nobody
is interested, anyways...

I have also source for a 640x256 Dungeon somewhere...

If someone wants the small engine, he can get it for free,
but he probably has to talk with the authors of
iff.library and superview.library, if he wants to do
a game with it and does not replace the GFX Loading
code...
