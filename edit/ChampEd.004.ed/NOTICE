                 Note to all Adventure and RPG gamers !!!
                ==========================================

       We the DRAGON SLAYERS, through our friend Craig Knowles,
       are going to run a request service for this BBS.
       
       If you have any requests for solutions, maps, editors, hints,
       spell lists etc (anything at all) please don't hesitate to lodge
       your request.  Forward the request either to Craig Knowles's
       personal mail box or leave a message to Craig Knowles in the 
       General messages section...

       Already, The Thief and The Assassin, we have uploaded various 
       Bards Tale II stuff, including an excellant Bards Tale II 
       character editor, complete maps for all levels of every dungeon,
       maps for all the cities and a map for the wilderness.  Also you 
       should find a complete solution written by The Thief including 
       various tips for the snares etc.  You will also find a Heros Quest I 
       map and a Phantasie III party editor.  If you have World Class 
       Leader Board, you might want to know that The Thief has also 
       uploaded two very challenging but good courses.
 
       Be looking forward for the following to be uploaded soon :

       Champions of Krynn Character Editor ... Half finished.
       Pools of Radiance Character Editor... Possibly.
       Curse of the Azure Bonds Character Editor.
       Solutions to the three above.
       Solution for mean streets.

       **************************************************************** 
       * Note if you ever find any bugs in any of our software,       *
       * PLEASE I urge you to leave a message for Craig Knowles.      *
       * He will then pass on the message to either The Thief, me or  *
       * The Assassin, sitting next to me.                            *
       ****************************************************************

       Remember keep those requests coming in and if we have the game
       we will try to satisfy your wish ASAP (As Soon As Possible !).

       No matter how ridiculous you believe the request is, make it 
       anyway.  When you make a request please include the following
       in the message :
  
            Your name/alias ... so we can send a reply to you.
            
            A description of what you wish us to do.
 
            If we cannot meet your request or if it will take a while
            we will leave a message for you anyway (we wont leave you
            in the lurch !!!)
