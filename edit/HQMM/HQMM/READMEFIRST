About Installing:

In order to install HQMM, two install scripts are created: one for use with
the Commodore Installer, which will give you a user-friendly and standard
install procedure. The other script is a script with AmigaDOS commands that
does the same, but with less options to choose by the user. So if you have
the Commodore Installer (distributed with the system software since Release
2.1 and also on Fred Fish's AmigaLibDisk 870) I recommend you use
'Install_with_Installer', else use 'Install_with_IconX', which should
always work, if you have installed your system software properly.


About HQMM and fonts.

HQMM uses a special font named "heroquest.font". This fonts must be
installed into the FONTS: assignment, before HQMM can be run. So in order
to work with HQMM, you MUST run the install program first. You may choose
then, to install the executables to disk, to RAM: or even not install the
executable files, as long as you make sure that the font is installed.
Also the fonts Times/18 and Times/24 are required. These are supplied by
Commodore on the Amiga Fonts disk. Make sure that on your boot drive or
(if you use a seperate FONTS: disk) your fonts disk, these fonts are
installed.
