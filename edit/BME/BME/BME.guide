@ENDNODE
@NODE start "How do I start?"

OK. So how do I start? Launch the program by clicking on the BME icon.
Now if all goes well you will be presented by a black screen with blue
title bar, and big bottom scroller. This @{B}bottom scroller@{UB} is used
to scroll around the whole map. Now you are ready to edit the smallest
possible map which is 22-icons wide. Notice that the background is grey
and covered by a black grid.

The grid can be disabled by @{B}AMIGA + G@{UB} combination or "Mode->Show Grid" option
in Menu. Each map consists of three layers which are:

1. Icon Map  - the map built from icons (small pictograms)
2. Objects   - the dynamic elements of map like keys, gems, doors etc.
3. Merry-Men - the creatures rescued by a hero in the game

Each of these layers are edited separately in the editor. To switch to
particular layer use Mode menu options.


@ENDNODE

@NODE how2editiconmap "How to edit iconmap?"

To edit iconmap just hit @{B}AMIGA + 1@{UB} combination or choose
"Mode->Edit Iconmap" option in Menu. Now you are ready to edit iconmap.
When you move the mouse cursor over the map the current icon is shown
with the white frame. Once you click the left mouse button the icon is
placed in the position of the mouse cursor.

To select another icon hit @{B}S@{UB} key. You will be presented by
a half of all available icons for this world. To change to another half
select right mouse button. To select the icon click left mouse button when
mouse cursor is over desired icon.

To copy existing icon from one place to another hit @{B}C@{UB} key.
This will make the icon under the cursor the current one.

It will take you some time to complete the iconmap. Prepare it well so
the map will be presenting very good :-)
@ENDNODE
@NODE how2editobjects "How to edit objects?"

To edit objects hit @{B}AMIGA + 2@{UB} combination or choose
"Mode->Edit Objects" option in Menu. Now you are ready to add new objects
as well as modify and delete existing ones.

To create new object select "Edit->Add Object" option in Menu.
Now you are presented by a object type list. Select the type of your choice,
for example "Gold key". The new object of that type will be created and you
will be able to edit properties of this new object. Notice that the
properties in v2.0 are easily configured and self-explaining.

To the right of each property is the checkbox, a number indicating trigger
number associated to this property and a "Unbind" button (initially
disabled). To assign a trigger to this property click on a checkbox. The
number of the trigger will show next to the checkbox. If you wish
to unassign the trigger hit the "Unbind" button. When the trigger is
assigned to a property the two states of this property can be edited - one
when the checkbox is off and one when the checkbox is on. Additionally the
trigger number can be used wherever the trigger is required.

To delete this object hit "Delete" button. To move objects around hold
down the left mouse button and move the mouse cursor. If you wish to edit
object's properties double-click on that object.

OK. So here's a list of available objects in current release.

are not defined for all objects yet but it is safe to add such objects.

Example of use of a trigger:

To make a lever<->platform connection add these objects to map then enter
platform's properties. Now select checkbox next to State property. This will
assign a trigger to this property. Note the number which appear next to
checkbox - this will be our trigger number. Now enter the number 1 in the
text field and exit platform's properties. Now enter the lever's properties
and type our trigger number in the Trigger field of the lever. And it's done!

@NODE whatsmissing "What's missing in version 2.0?"

The object database in current version contains less than 50 objects
which is insufficient to make maps for all worlds. For now only Underworld
and Tombs of Egypt worlds are supported which is a subject to change
(the program is ready to support the rest of the worlds).

Additionally there is no possibility to define sky and water. All these
features will appear in next release.
