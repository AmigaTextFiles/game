==============

In this beta release of version 2.0 the export to Benefactor map is not
possible. The map are only written in internal IFF format. Additionally the
database contains less than 50 objects and not all properties are specified
and handled yet. All these will be addressed in full v2.0 release which will
contain scripts used to build a Benefactor data-disk.
