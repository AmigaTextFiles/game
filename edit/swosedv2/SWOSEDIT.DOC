                              WHAT iS THiS???

With this little tool, you can edit the data files in SWOS. You may edit the
players names, skills, values etc.

                                WHY THiS???
                                -----------
I made this because some of the datas in SWOS are really crap. Take a look at
Brondby, Denmark. S.Colding is valued at 600k, while M.Krogh is valued at 250k!
Furthermore some stats are totally stupid! Eg. O.Bjur is great at heading, but
poor at passing. Hmm...

                            HOW TO USE THiS???
                            ------------------
Since the datas on the SWOS-disks are RNC-packed, you need to unpack them
first. A depacker is included in this archive, and it works fine.
First select a TEAM.XXX file from the SWOS:data/ directory and decrunch it
with the included Depack command. Now run SWOSEDIT.
You'llnow be presented with the main menu. Here you should select the 'LOAD
NEW TEAMS' button, and enter the path for a TEAM.XXX file. Now press the
'EDIT TEAMS' button and select a team to edit. Now you may edit the name of
the team, the managers name, the home/away kit or edit a player. When editing
some kind of numbers, press left mouse to increase and right mouse to decrease.
Once you've done all changes return to the main menu, and save your teams. You
do not have to RNC-pack the teams again. SWOS will happily read the files
anyway.
