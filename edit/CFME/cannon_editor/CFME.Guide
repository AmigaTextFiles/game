@Node news "News about CFME"

 From 1.80 CFME will become a package of various things:
 There will be:

 - CFME: the main editor

 - example drawer: a directory containing some maps and other files

 - exe drawer: a directory containing an executable file to make some
               CFME's feature available. You have to put it on your Cannon
               Fodder drawer.

 - Utility drawer: this will contain some utilities (like graphics
                   converters - BLK2IFF_IFF2BLK) that allow you to
                   change graphics and (later) sounds of CF.

 CFME, as archive, will have two version numbers: one referred to CFME main
 editor (the file named "CFME"), and the second will be referred to the
 version of the content of Utilities drawer. Note that Utilities dir will
 have, as version number, the sum of ALL utilities' version numbers

 How do the version numbers mean:

 EXAMPLE: V5.43/2.10

 The value 5.4 means great amount  of new options (like objective editor
 preferences, diff. editor, block editor, grids, etc: all these are new
 options.). The Number 3 means that I made to the current version (5.4)
 3 small improvements or bug fixes. A value of 4 (in the same place - second
 decimal digit) means a four bug fixes and so on.

 Number 2.10 may mean that:
 - there is only one utility which has been changed many times with many
   and important options (Example: it could be a sprite editor option added
   to IFF2BLK_BLK2IFF file ...). No bug fixes.
 - there is more than one utility and the sum of it's version number is 2.1
   (example IFF2BLK_BLK2IFF V1.00 and a sound editor V1.10)
   Maybe no bugfixes. (2.10 may be the sum of 1.08 and 1.02... and so on)

@endnode

@node chgra "Changing / converting CF graphics"

 How to change CF icon graphics:

 Double click on the BLK2IFF_IFF2BLK file in the utilities drawer (very
 difficult!)

 This name means "Cannon Fodder .blk files to IFF and vice-versa"

 NOTE: This utility can't read RNC crunched files. If your .blk files are
 crunched you have to decrunch them manually

 BLK to IFF:

 Load a BLK file and then its palette. (By using the menu)
 Save the IFF file and then modify it with any program like PPAINT, Dpaint
 etc. DON'T CHANGE THE IMAGE ATTRIBUTES! (ie size and depth)

 IFF TO BLK:

 Load the iff file then save it the .BLK  format. IFF and BLK Attributes
 must be the same (ie you can't save a morsub.blk file on a morbase.blk)
 Save the pal file if you made any change to the palette. (I suggest you to
 not to modify palette until I make a complete graphics editor.)

 IFF TO CFME:

 To be able to use the new graphics in CFME you have to change CFME data/
 files. You'll may do it by hand but I don't suggest you it.
 So I made a little feature on this utility.
 You have to:
 -Select Save as CFME in the CFME menu. A window will appear.
 -Select the name of the file you want to change. (ie if you have converted
  the file icesub.blk to iff, then you changed it, so you want to edit maps
  with the new graphics, select the "icesub" button.)
 -Select SAVE AS CFME IFF in the project menu.
 -Select the CFME Data/ dir

 Now should be able to see in CFME your new graphics.

@endnode


@Node requirements "Requirements"

 Requirements

 CFME needs to run:

 -An Amiga ;-)
 -at least 1MB of free mem (at least 300-400 k must be of chip)
  If you are using resolution higher than 320x256, 2 MB are the minimum  
 -Os 2.0+  (sorry only now I discovered that  it crashes on 1.3!)
 -Cannon Fodder installed on HD

 That's all.

@EndNode


@Node installation "How to install it"

 Once unpacked it's ready to use. But I made an installer (so you can unpack
 it into ram: and install it on HD - suggested)
 
 It's better to add to user startup the following line:

 assign CF: <path where CF maps file are>

 It's not necessary but it's suggested since I use this assignment as default
 in .config file.
 
 If you have WB2.1 or greater (with the env variable "language" in ENV: ) the
 language chosen will be (if available) the same of your WB.

 If you have WB2.0 OR your language isn't supported you can select it using the
 @{"ToolTypes" link tool}.

 You may also select the directory where are the catalogs file installed in
 by using the tooltypes. (so you can move the catalogs dir in DATA/ in your
 LOCALE: directory.)

 NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM IS LOCALIZED EVEN IF YOU DON'T OWN WB2.1+: it has a
 locale.library emulation.

 Currently supported languages:

 English (Default)
 Italian


 *** NOTE: ***

 Remove the LANGUAGE TOOLTYPE if you want to select WB's language.

 (ToolTypes have more priority than ENV: settings)

@EndNode


@Node distribution "Distribution"

 You can (and you are encouraged to)  spread the ORIGINAL ARCHIVE all over the world!!
 You must distribute it freely (you can charge the cost of a disk or a CD of PD-free-shareware programs)
 Spread it on Aminet BBS, Web Sites, CDs (for example: Aminet, Amy Resource, EAR-CDs etc..)  etc...


 IT MUST BE AS THE AUTHOR PROVIDED IT. IT CANNOT BE CHANGED OR DISTRIBUTED ONLY IN PART.

@EndNode


@Node blocks "How to put Block"

 Blocks are groups of icons predefined by the user.
 They speed up the building of the map because some elements (like buildings
 trees) are repeated on the map. So user can make a block and put it
 (instead of single icons) on the map just like if it would be an icon.

 You can define 10 blocks and you can save/load them. They have size from
 1x1 to 5x5. You can copy icons (for example those ones which are very used
 but are difficult to find out from icon window) in a block with 1x1 size.

 You can add a name to your blocks (maximum 9 chars)

 HOW TO BUILD BLOCKS:

 - Select in the @{"Program menu" link program} "User Blocks".
 - Two windows will open - work on the bigger one
 - Select the block you want to change/create and select the size (Note
   you can change size of a block without losing your work)
 - Add it a name (if you want) in the string gadget (press return once
   you have finished, otherwise name won't be saves)
 - Build the block as you would be building a map.

 HOW TO PUT:

 - If the smaller one "User Blocks" window isn't open, select "User Blocks"
   in the "Program" menu.
 - Select the block you want (here's the usefulness of the names...)
 - click on the map icon to put the entire block

 number of colour on screen) and a listview. To change a screen pen you
 have to:
 -select a pen in the listview (it becomes the currently used pen)
 -select the colour box you want (so the pen you chosen will use this colour)
 -Save, quit & reload CFME
 
 To change palette you have to choose the "Palette" menu in the prefs
 window. So you will see 3 slider and the usual coloured boxes.
 Select the colour you want to change (It must be a colour NOT used by CF)
 and select the amount of red green and blue.
 
@endNode


@Node chpro "Changing icons properties"

 HOW TO CHANGE ICON PROPERTIES:

 There are several properties of CF icons.
 By selecting "Icons prop editor" in the "Program" menu you can modify
 how icons change when they are hit by rockets, bombs etc...

 Once you have selected "Icons prop editor" you will see a new window.
 Every icon can have two states: normal and destroyed states.
 Of course, the destroyed icon can have a normal and destroyed states and
 so on.
 If the destroyed state is equal to the normal one, that kind of icon can
 be hit infinite times and it will explode every time it's been hit.

 To load the file which contains those information select the new window
 and, in the project menu choose "load swp". Then you have to enter a
 name in the file requester.

 NOTE: The name can be:

 -first three letters of the terrain type (es: ICE or MOR or INT etc..)
 -one file which has the first 3 initial equal to Ice, Jun, etc...

 We can modify the destroyed state by selecting "show destroyed" in the
 "Window" menu and putting icons on the grid. (get the from the icon window)
 Note: black icons (you can get it from the icon window: it's at the right
       bottom corner) mean a indestructible icons.

 To save choose "save" or "save as" (to change name) in the project menu.

 NOTEs:

 -Only first 3 chars of the names are considered. This prevents errors.
 -There are two types of jungle: jungle0 and jungle1. To choose which one
  to edit you must select file: junsub0.swp or junsub1.swp.
 -Always edit the .swp file of the same terrain type chosen in the Base submenu.
  Ie if you chose "desert" you must edit the "des" .spt file

@Node spico "Selecting and putting an icon in the map"


 To put an icon you must firstly have done one of these operations:

 - @{"Set map dimension " link cmdim }
 - @{"Loaded a map      " link lsmap }
 - @{"Loaded a phase    " link lspha }

 Once you have done one of the previous operation then you can select an icon by clicking over it
 in the @{"Icon Window" link iconwnd}. Note that icons are 16x16 pixel.
 From now that icon becomes the currently used icon.

 To put an icon in the map you simply have to click in the map window. The icon will be placed
 where you clicked.

 To be precise icons aren't placed just where you clicked. They are placed in the nearest multiple
 of 16 coordinates. For examples if you click on the coord. 20,37 the icon will be placed at 16,32.

@EndNode


@Node spspr "Selecting and Putting sprites"

 To put a sprite you must firstly have done one of the following operations:

 - @{"Set number of sprites " link cnspr }
 - @{"Loaded a spt file     " link lsspr }
 - @{"Loaded a phase        " link lspha }

 After that you have to do a slightly more complex operation than selecting and putting an icon.

 SELECTING SPRITE:

 Make sure that the @{"Sprite Window" link sprwnd} is open.
 You can see tree gadget over a series of images in a grid.
 At the top of the window there are "Sprite" and "Max" signs.
 Both are followed by a number. The number next to "Sprite" means the number of the sprite (not
 the image) you are attaching the image. In a map you can select a limited number of sprites
 (33 - from 0 to 32).
 It may change color:

 - green (or any non-red color): You can use/place/change its image.
 - red: the sprite is used by a previous sprite. It's forzen: this because some objects like tanks
        chops use more than one sprite. For examples an enemy Tank uses three sprites:
        one for the body, one for the turret and one for the light.
        You can free those sprites by changing the sprite which is using them. (its number appears
        in a requester if you try to use a frozen sprite)

 The number next to "Max" tells you how many sprites are present in the map. You have to assign for
 each sprite an image and you must place it in the map.

 You can select the number of the sprite currently used by clicking on the PREV (previous) or Next
 gadget.
 Currently used sprites will have their sprite number on the map marked in red. (in sprites text are
 enabled)
 Clicking on the FIND gadget the currently used sprite will be found in the map.

 To select the image (or better, the kind of the object you're placing) you have to click over the
 image in the sprite window. The selected object will become the currently used image.
 Make sure you have enough sprites left.


 TO PUT THE SPRITE:

 Click in the map and the sprite will be placed EXACTLY where you have clicked.

 CHOPS:

 There are four types of Choppers:

 - Unarmed
 - With Bomb
 - With rockets
 - With IR missiles

 They are marked by the color of the tail (sorry I couldn't find better way)

 Note: last chops images are for the Helicopters which aren't available unless you haven't activated
 all the switches.

@Node Bugk "Bug"
  Limitations/Bugs

  Bugs:
  -... sometimes ... it crashes !!! (Therefore I suggest you to save your
   work on RAM: and not directly on HD)
  -if you haven't got enough ram it can crash. Don't run many applications
   if you can run out of memory. (I will fix it next)

  Limitations
  -CFME can't edit RNC crunched files. If your *.Map files are crunched
   you have to decrunch them manually.
