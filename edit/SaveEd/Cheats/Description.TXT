;--- Header

;Name = Str: Name of cheat

;Author = Str: Author of cheat

;--- Recognize file

;Filename = Str: Filename (if exact, allows wildcards)

;Size = Val: Size of file (if exact)

;Match = Str: String to match (may be given in the form of $xxxxxx if unprintable characters)

;Position = Val: Set position for match

;And: The following must also be true

;Or: The previous or the following must be true

;End: End file recognizing

;--- Options

;Option = Str: Name of option (this specifies the beginning of a new option - maximum number of options is 48)

;Info = Str: Info to this option

;Address = Val: Address to change

;Length = Val: Length of value (1=byte, 2=word, 4=long word)

;Value = Val: Type of value (1=Positive value 2=Value 3=String 4=String value 5=Dec value/Speris 6=Predefined value 7=Predefined string by value)

;Min = Val: Minimum value

;Max = Val: Maximum value

;ValueName.X = Str: Name of the chosen value (X must be between 0 and 255)

;PreValue.X = Val: Predefined value (X must be between 0 and 15)

;PreString.X = Str: Predefined string (X must be between 0 and 15)

;--- Additional commands

;Base = Val: This base value is added to all addresses

;Group = Str: Name of the following group

;Do = Val: Begin loop (number of times to loop, must be between 2 and 16 for first group and 2 and 8 for subgroup)

;Step = Val: Size of each step in bytes

;Loop: Return to Do statement (loop the code inbetween)

;Read = Val (0-9): Read data (Length = 1 for byte etc.) into variable V

;--- Notes

;Math is done straight from left to right. This means that the following line:
;Address = 37+V0*4-V1/3
;will be read and performed as:
;Address = (((37+V0)*4)-V1)/3
;You would probably want the above line to be calculated as:
;Address = 37+(V0*4)-(V1/3)
;This could be achieved by something like:
;Address = V0*4+37*3-V1/3
