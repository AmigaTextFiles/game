@node "Introduction" "What to do with it"

  @{b}Introduction@{ub}
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
SaveEd is a tool for editing files. The main purpose is to cheat with savegames,
but it may be suitable for many other things. SaveEd can both be used by
complete beginners and experienced cheaters.

WARNING! This tool changes your files. ALWAYS make backup of any files you plan
to edit. Even though you know what you do, SaveEd may crash, cheat files may be
faulty or you could have a power shutdown! ALWAYS make backups :)

Simply copy all the SaveEd stuff into a directory of your own choice.

@node "Usage" "How to use it"

  @{b}Usage@{ub}
  ~~~~~
SaveEd has four main windows.

@{b}File@{ub}

In this window you can load the main file you want to edit. If you want to do
cross-searches etc. you also need to load a swap file.

When loading the main file SaveEd will automatically try to pick the correct
fileformat. If this was wrong or did not happen, you can select it manually by
using the Set button.

At the bottom of the window you can open or activate the last three windows.

@{b}Options@{ub}

This function is only available if a fileformat has been recognized or selected.
This window will then list all the built-in cheats that exist for this format.

Everything in this window should be pretty self-explanatory. The Group slider
appears when the file has several alike options (like the same options for all
characters in a party in an RPG). There can also be subgroups.

You must press Change when you want to perform the changes. If you do not
click Change nothing will happen (unless you have selected Auto Change from the
menu). Reset will change anything you have altered back to the original (since
last load).

@{b}Search@{ub}

The most complex window. The upper half is used to search for strings or values.
The X-buttons are for cross-searching: Say you have two different savegames -
you have got 600 gold in the first (main) and 750 in the second (swap). Now
enter 600 in Main Value and 750 in Swap Value. Finally press X-Long or X-Word
to find the exact address where both of these match.

S-Search is used to Step-Search. The step value is entered in the Step box and
the values searched for is the ones in the normal Value and Swap Value boxes.
Say you have a savegame which have several alike values (like characters in a
party in a RPG game). You must find the step in bytes between each character and
enter this as the step. Now pressing S-Byte will find addresses with search for
the Main value. When this is found the routine jumps Step bytes forward to check
for the Swap value. This is repeated until the end of the file. If both the Main
and Swap value was found, the search was succesful.

Occurence will tell all the results of the search and Address the exact adresses.
At the bottom you can now poke a new string (Length is the max length of the
string) or value.

You should ONLY poke to addresses you are sure of. If a search reveals 17
occurences you need to try more searches. It is also important that you always
choose the corrent length (Length for strings and Poke/Doke/Loke for values).
If you poke to a wrong address, you savegame will 99% not work anymore.

@{b}Hex Display@{ub}

This window display the hexcodes of the loaded file. You can enter the address
(start with a '$' to use hex) and then change a value using the Poke button.

The Hex Display is very simple and early. The display may look weird (depending
on your font settings).

@node "Cheats" "What about cheat files"

  @{b}Cheat files@{ub}
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
The directory Cheats includes several built-in cheat files that allows for easy
use with the Cheat Options window. With the slightest skills you can create your
own. I'm not gonna explain how they work here, but take a look at the file
Description.TXT and you should be able to figure it out.

Please upload any cheats you may create to AmiNet. If you send them to me aswell
I will include them in the next update of SaveEd.

Please note that some of these savegames (mainly PSX-ones) uses checksums. This
means that the savegame will be messed up once you change something. When I
figure these checksums out I will improve the cheats to handle this. Until then
those cheats are marked (Checksum missing).

Also note that beta-versions (x.xﬂ) have not been tested at all!

@node "Info" "What you just have to know"

  @{b}Info@{ub}
  ~~~~
This is some basic information for complete beginners.

Data basically exists in two types: strings and values. Strings are sentences
of letters and can come in any shape and length. In save games you will probably
only find strings when it comes to names of cities, characters and so on.

Values are numbers. These come in three lengths:

1 byte  =  8 bits = Byte/Peek/Poke = 2^8  = 0 to 255
2 bytes = 16 bits = Word/Deek/Doke = 2^16 = 0 to 65535 or -32767 to 32767
4 bytes = 32 bits = Long/Leek/Loke = 2^32 = -2.1 billion to 2.1 billion

To Peek/Deek/Leek means to read a value and to Poke/Doke/Loke means to write a
value.

There exists three (well, basically) ways to write a value:

Binary      = 0 to 1
Decimal     = 0 to 9 ("normal" numbers)
Hexadecimal = 0 to f (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f)

Binary is represented by a % (eg. %11010 = 26) and hexadecimal by a $ (eg.
$1a = 26).

Addresses are normally always written in hexadecimal.

@node "Future" "What will there be in the future"

  @{b}Future@{ub}
  ~~~~~~
SaveEd could be improved in several ways:

- MUI interface

- Better Hex Display

- Read and write PSX memorycards (via parallel port)

- Options to de/crypt SNES and other crypted save games

- More cheat files

Which of these I will do is currently unknown, though.

@node "History" "How did it grow up"

  @{b}History@{ub}
  ~~~~~~~
- 1.00 (99/08/02)   first public release

- 1.01 (99/08/??)   public release

  FIX! The text string at the Main file was displayed wrong.

  FIX! You no longer have to press return after a input.

  FIX! Read command did not get the correct Length and thus always returned 0.

  FIX! Using Read in loops only returned the value of the first loop.

  FIX! Min and Max values were automatically set to 0.

  NEW! Value type 6 and 7. Added for use with country codes of PlayStation games.

  NEW! PreValue.X and PreString.X options added for use with Value type 6 and 7.

  NEW! Step Search option in Search window.

  ADD! Now more than 45 cheat files, including PlayStation games.

- 1.02 (00/02??)   public release

  NEW! Auto Change option for faster, but more dangerous updating.

  NEW! Loop inside another loop is now supported (ie. both groups and subgroups).

  NEW! Value type 6 and 7 now presented by sliders for faster use.

  ADD! Source code (AMOS Asc-format) now included in archive.

  ADD! Added WipeOut cheats and updated other cheats.
