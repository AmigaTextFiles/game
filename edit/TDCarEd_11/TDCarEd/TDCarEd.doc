Purpose:
~~~~~~~~
This program is a simple editor for the cars in Test Drive 1 and 4D Sports
Driving. With this program, you can change the gear ratios and acceleration
of all cars in TD1 and 4D SD.

Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program requires v2.04 or higher of the operating system to run. To
actually have any use of it, you must have a copy of TestDrive 1 (TD1)
and/or 4D Sports Driving (4D SD).

Usage:
~~~~~~
This program can be started from both Workbench and CLI. Double-click on
its icon to start it from Workbench. To start it from CLI, you must enter
the full path and the name of the editor (TDCarEd) and press return. If
you are going to change the cars for 4D SD, you may change the current dir
to the one that contains the game. This makes it easier to find the car
data files. Test Drive 1 uses an absolute path for its files, because it
isn't programmed to be installed on a hard drive.

Gadgets:
~~~~~~~~
Once started, the program will open its window, that contains a lot of
(disabled) gadgets. Here is an ASCII picture of something that should
look a bit like the window.

All gadgets except the Load, Quit and About gadget are disabled when
there is no car in memory.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All gadgets from top left to bottom right:

Max rpm:    TD1 only. Specifies at which rpm the engine should burn.
            If this gadget is set to max, the engine will never burn.

1:st gear:  Gear ratio for the first gear. All these gadgets specifies
            the engine's rpm at about 200MPH.

2:nd gear:  Gear ratio for the second gear.

3:rd gear:  Gear ratio for the third gear.

4:th gear:  Gear ratio for the fourth gear.

5:th gear:  Gear ratio for the fifth gear.

6:th gear:  Gear ratio for the sixth gear. 4D SD only, since no TD1 car
            have more gears than 5.

Load car:   Load a car data file. The type is specified below. If you have
            a loaded and changed car data file in memory, it will be loss
            without warning.

Save car:   Save a car data file. You must overwrite the old file, so make
            sure you are using a backup copy of your original disks. If
            you have the game installed on the hard drive, and you haven't
            lost your original disks, it's safe to overwrite the old file.

            TD1:   This game could be installed on a hard drive, but you
                   have to assign "Test Drive:" to the drawer that contains
                   the game. If you don't install it, make a copy of the
                   Test Drive disk and save your edited files on that disk.

            4D SD: This game is directly hard drive installable, and you
                   should install it if you have a hard drive. If you don't
                   install it, make a copy of the SECOND disk for this game
                   and save your edited files there. The first disk have no
                   car data files, and you can use your "normal" disk 1.

Quit:       Exits the program to where it was started from. You can also
            exit the program by clicking on the close gadget in the upper
            left corner of the window.

Edit Acceleration:
            Allows you to edit the acceleration curve for the currently
            loaded car. This gadget will open another window, that,
            depending on the selected game, will contain a lot of gadgets.
            Test Drive 1 uses a maximum of 80 values to specify the cars
            acceleration, while 4D SD uses up to 100 values. Don't edit
            values that may not be in use.

            You can see the values that is in use by looking at the curve.
            The used values begins with a rising curve to then slowly go
            down to zero again. Editing values outside the curves range
            may crash the game when that car is used.

            The acceleration values seems to be more sensitive in 4D SD
            than they are in TD1. Be carefully to not move the gadgets
            too much, since it can destroy that car.

            The window's title will change to show you the current value
            of the gadget you are working with.

            If you destroy a data file, just replace it with the original
            file and start over.

Game:       This gadget allows you to select which game to edit a car data
            file for. Currently available games are only Test Drive 1 and
            4D Sports Driving.

            If you select 4D Sports Driving, the window be a bit higher to
            make space for some new gadgets. These have something to do
            with 4D SD:s automatic gear system. The values tells the game
            when to shift to the next gear, but I haven't quite figured it
            out how these works. Generally the first value should be the
            smallest one, the next one a bit higher and so on.

Edit Info:  4D SD only. Allows you to edit the text that is displayed while
            selecting a car. This gadget opens a little window with the
            current text. The string gadgets can contain any text, but the
            labels gives you the default contents type. The last line is for
            the highscore list. The first string is the car name that should
            be shown as the car you used, and the second string is the short
            name that shows which car the opponent used.

About:      Gives you some information about the program and my address. My
            address can also be found below.

Some things to try (4D Sports Driving):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Lamborghini LM-002:   (filename: carlm02.res)

        1:st gear   31744
        2:nd gear   25384
        3:rd gear   20116
        4:th gear   15966
        5:th gear   12676
        6:th gear   10852

        Auto gears: 2016, 8416, 12016, 13344

        Acceleration: All gadgets at $FF (all the way up)

        The LM-002 has only 5 gears, but maybe I will make it possible to
        change the number of gears in the next version of this program.
        Use only gears 1 to 5 to test this configuration.

    Audi Quattro Sport:   (filename: caraudi.res)

        1:st gear   32496
        2:nd gear   25996
        3:rd gear   19768
        4:th gear   14352
        5:th gear   11914

        Auto gears: 1082, 3520, 7310, 10560

        Acceleration: All gadgets at $FF (all the way up)

    Note:
        The file format of a saved replay file depends on the time. I don't
        know the format of the replay file, but if you have changed a car
        between saving and loading a replay file, the replay will not look
        like the one you saved. Include the used cars with the replay file
        whenever spreading a replay file to friends etc.

Some things to try (Test Drive 1):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    All cars:

    Set max rpm to 32766 (max) and leave everything else. This will make
    the engine impossible to burn. For best effect, pull the joystick
    forward in about 5 seconds before start driving. To make the car go
    faster, without changing the gear ratios, shift the gear one step back
    at a high speed, and continue to drive.

    Acceleration curve:

    Change to whatever you want. The acceleration for TD1 is less sensitive
    than it is for 4D SD.

    Lotus:
        Gears:      65523, 34392, 17330, 8124, 3248
