@node linkUsage "Usage"
Usage
----------

@{I}The Main Menu
@{UI}When starting HSM_Ed you get directly into the main menu.
Whenever the mouse is placed over an button a help text is shown on the bottom of the display.
The top row contains of the filebased options:
Load, Save, Import, New Project

@{I}Load
@{UI}You get prompted for a file.
The requester expects the file to have the suffix ".hsmdb" which is for "HollywoodSoccerManagerDataBase".
When loading a file you might lose data you previously entered, so it is a good idea to save first.

@{I}Save
@{UI}When you are finished with editing the data you should save it.
Depending on previous steps you are asked for a filename or confirmation on overwriting a file.

@{I}Import
@{UI}A requester pops up as if you want to load a project. The selected project will be appended to the current one.
There are several securitychecks before appending a project.
	There has to be a current project, otherwise it would be enough to just load a project.
	The project to import has to be another one than the previously loaded one.
What the importfunction does not check is for doubleentries. It is up to you to find out if there are some entries with the same name.
As these dupletes are technically fine you should check the result because of \"estethic\" reasons.
When importing an project please bear in mind that this may take some especially when the projects are big it is relatively timeconsuming to fix references.

@{I}New Project
@{UI}This will reset the entered data. All internal tables will be blanked out and counters will be reset to \"0\".

@{I}Default Editing options:
@{UI}In the top left area you have the option to go back to the main menu.
The second row contains of the default editing options:
Add, Edit, Search, Remove, Previous Page, Next Page
When adding or editing an entry you get prompted for the values of the entry.
The datamodel allows a wide range of allowed entrys, e.g. there is no limit for the length of strings.
Furthermore for editing purposes every item is saved as a string.
When you are prompted for a reference you need to enter the ID of the respective entry.
If this ID does not exist it is replaced by a \"0\".
Selecting an entry works via it's ID. When you want to edit a specific entry you get prompted for it's ID.
Afterwards you cycle through some requesters with either the old values or the available options.
When you are searching for an entry you need to know it's ID. When the entry is found the display is changed to the respective page and the entry is highlighted by a green box.
To remove an entry you are prompted for the ID of that item. If the item got found the references are reset to \"0\".
Browsing through pages is only made available when the items don't fit on the first page.
@{I}Editing Clubs
@{UI}You can select the name for the club. Cashamount is the current balance for the club.
The income and expenses are suposed to be stated for a monthly rate. Keep in mind that wages for players and the coach go on top of that. On the income side there is the value from gamevisitors and alike.
Next is the name for the stadium, it's capacity and the ticketprice.
To link a coach to the club enter the coachreference or leave it as \"0\".
When entering a leaguereference the nation of the league is given to the club too, else leave the leaguereference blank and set the nation solely.
@{I}Editing Players
@{UI}Enter ID of clubreference,name for player and nationkey.
To distinguish entries with the same surname please enter a capital letter and a . then a blank followed by the surname. This should look like this:
\"A. Anderson\"
When prompted for age, enter a value between 17 - 42.
Available Positions:
   GK-Goalkeeper
   LI-Libero
   CB-Central Back
   LB-Left Back

   LW-Left Wing
   RW-Right Wing
   DM-Defensive Midfielder

Closing the playerdefinition with his abilities.
The numerical values can range from 0 - 99 and default with 50.
The value for the player is calculated internally.
@{I}Editing Referees
@{UI}Enter a name for the referee, select his type and the competence of that type. This value can range from 0 - 99 defaulting to 50.
@{I}Editing Coaches
@{UI}Enter a name for the coach, select his type and the competence of that type. This value can range from 0 - 99 defaulting to 50.
Enter the clubreference. When you select an reference <>\"0\" the club is linked to the new coach and if the club already had an coach that coach's link gets removed.
As the next value the prefered tactic of the coach can be defined. Enter a value for coachwage on a monthly base.
@{I}Editing Leagues
@{UI}Enter a name for the league.
Link the league to a nation via the NationID.
The hierarchy goes from 0 - n. Leagues like \"Bundesliga\" or \"Premier League\" should get a value of \"0\".
Points for victory are 3 by default. Number of games/team should be an even number. The number of teams for relegation influences the league itself and the next hierarchylayer.
The relegated teams leave the league and teams from the lower layer get their place.
@{I}Editing Events
@{UI}Enter a name for the event and select the affected object.
The selection of the target can be used to make sure that objects linked to a humann player are affected.
To make clearer what the event is about you can enter a message. Notice the desired format with nationflags and pipes.
Following this way makes it possible to get multilingual events.
The probability has to be numerical and shall be a value between 0 - 99.
Via requester the property to be affected can be defined.
In a last step the effect can be weight. You can enter a value which can will be added to the selected property.
Example:
If you want to create an event affecting any player and reducing his ability of passing by \"10\" you would go through this steps:
Name:        \"M1\"
Object:      \"Player\"
Target:      \"Any\"
Text:        \"EN|foo|DE|ba\"
Probability: \"50\"
Effect:      \"Passing\"
Value:       \"-10\"

If that event gets triggered during the game the value of that player get's recalculated and it might have an effect on the squad of his team and even the upcoming matches.

Be careful with defining events especially when setting negative values!

@{I}Editing Nations
@{UI}Enter the name for the nation.
The name should be denoted as the messages before. Say you want to enter the nation \"Germany\" you should do it this way:
\"EN|Germany|DE|Deutschland\"
