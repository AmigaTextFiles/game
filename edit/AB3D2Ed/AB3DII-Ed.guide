 Welcome to the @{fg shine}ULTIMATE@{fg text} Alien Breed 3D II - TKG Save Game Editor, as you
have probably already guessed this program allows you to edit the saved game
data used in Alien Breed 3D II - TKG.

 With the editor you are able to alter the following parameters;

  Playing level
  Players health
  Players weapons
  Weapon ammunition
  Whether player has the jet pac

 The editor is now a fully functioning commodity, and therfore with a
utility like `Exchange' you are able to;

  Show/hide editors interface
  Remove editor
  Activate/Deactivate the editors interface
  Use the editors hotkey to show the interface

 Tooltypes are NOT supported in this version of the editor and so you will
not be able to use CX_POPUP, CX_POPKEY etc...

 The editor was written using Blitz Basic 2.1 and the Blitz Support Suite
on an Amiga 1200, Blizzard 1260/50, 18MB RAM, workbench 3.1.

 Note : Team 17 have been rather sneaky with the way that the save game
data works, when you choose the load game option you have the choice of
five game slots and a `New Game' option, this `New Game' option is actually
game slot 0!  As such with the editor you are also able to change this,
however when Alien Breed 3D II - TKG first loads it does not use this `New
Game' to set up the defaults, so you will have to load it in for it to take
effect, (another poor programming technique employed by the game writers).

@node "insta" "Installation"

@prev "intro"

 To install the editor to your harddisk, just copy the executable to where
you want it.

 As the guide now uses imags to aid in the description on how to use the
editor if you want to keep the guide, you should also copy the `images'
drawer to the same directory on your hard disk as the guide.

 Loading The Editor
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 On double clicking the editors icon will cause the editor to load.  When
loading from workbench the editor will automatically try to use the
tooltypes.

 The editor opens up its orginal interface on the frontmost screen (normally
the screen that you double clicked the icon on, if you have not defined one
with the tooltypes).

 Using The Editor As A Commodity
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 As the editor is now a fully functioning commodity you are able to control
it using the @{"exchange" link images/exchange.iff/main} (or similar) utility supplied with workbench.

 However tooltypes CX_POPUP, CX_POPKEY etc. are not supported in this
version of the editor.

 @{"Fig 01" link images/showhide.iff/main} @{b}Show/Hide Interface@{ub}

 Clicking on the `Show Interface' will open up the editors interface if it
is hidden, otherwise it will do nothing.  If you have `Inactivated' the 
editor it will be made `Active' on showing the interface.

 Clicking on the `Hide Interface' will close down the editors interface if
it is open, otherwise it will do nothing.

 @{"Fig 02" link images/activeinactive.iff/main} @{b}Activate/Inactivate Interface@{ub}

 This is a cycle gadget and so you every click will rotate between `Active'
and `Inactive'.  The editors status is whatever the cycle gadget is
showing.  Making the editor `Inactive' will cause the editors interface to
become locked.   When clicking on the editors interface your mouse pointer
will show the busy state and none of the buttons highlight etc.

 When making the editor `Active' it causes the editors interface to become
unlocked.  The editors interface automatically becomes `Active' when you
show the editor.

 @{"Fig 03" link images/remove.iff/main} @{b}Remove Editor@{ub}

 Clicking the `Remove' gadget closes down the editor, it does the same as
clicking on the windows close gadget.

 @{b}Hot Key <ctrl alt b>@{ub}

 If the editors interface is hidden and you press the hotkey <ctrl alt b>
the editors interface will appear, otherwise it will do nothing.  It does
the same as clicking on the `Show Interface' button.

 Using The Editors Interface
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 @{"Fig 04" link images/tkg2path.iff/main} @{b}TKG2: <P>ath@{ub}

 Use the string gadget to type in the path to the tkg2: assign, or location
of the `boot.dat' file.  Or use the `^' gadget to select a path using a
requester.  (Note, tkg2: is the default path, even if it does not exist!)

 If the string gadget is empty the `Load' and `Save' gadgets will be
ghosted.

 @{"Fig 05" link images/playinglevel.iff/main} @{b}Playing Level@{ub}

 This cycle gadget denotes the level that the save game will start on, this
currently only supports levels `A-P' not having tried the level editors I
am unsure whether you can create levels past `P'.

 @{"Fig 06" link images/gameslots.iff/main} @{b}Game Slots@{ub}

 Select a game slot to edit, once selected the gadgets will be updated with
that slots data.

 @{"Fig 07" link images/weapons.iff/main} @{b}Weapons@{ub}

 Click the checkboxes to select which weapons the player is to have, once a
weapon is selected you will be able to alter the ammunition for that weapon.
(Note, Shotgun is always selected!)

 @{"Fig 08" link images/health.iff/main} @{b}Health@{ub}

 Move the scroll bar to alter the amount of health the player will have
from 0-10000.  (Note, if you choose `0' the player will start off dead!)

 @{"Fig 09" link images/options.iff/main} @{b}Options@{ub}

  Load <L> - This loads the `boot.dat' file from the selected path.
  Save <S> - This saves the `boot.dat' file to the selected path.
 About <A> - This displays information about the editor.

 @{"Fig 10" link images/ammunition.iff/main} @{b}Ammunition@{ub}

 Move the scroll bars to alter the amount of ammunition for each weapon the
player will have from 0-10000.  (Note, during the game `Laser' and
`MegaLaser' both use the same ammunition therefore there is only one scroll
bar.  This is also the same for `Single-Plasma' and `Multi-Plasma'.)

 As far as I know the editor does not have any bugs at all!  However if you
do find some bugs please do not hesitate to contact us via one of the means
in @{"Authors" link "autho"}.

 Note : There is quirk in reqtools.library, the @{"about" link images/about.iff/main} requester for the
editor is quite large and if you are only running a screen which is 256
pixels or less high and your screen font is larger than `topaz 8', you will
find that the `okay' button is inside the window and that some of the text
is possibly missing!

 My only suggestion is that you temporarily open a screenmode that is 512
pixels high `hires laced' this way you will be able to open the about
requester and view all the information.

 Unlike previous version of the editor I now have proper InterNET access
and so will be uploading the editor to the AmiNET myself from now on.  Also
my EMail adress is actually mine and not somebody elses account so you can
write mail to me directly (Amiga Format).

  As you may be aware other editors have been poping up from all over
   Europe, from the response I have recieved and from the number of
   different PD disks and magazine cover disks/CDs that this editor has
   appeared on compared to the rivals, this editor is the BEST!

  As I mentioned above this editor has appeared on so many PD disks and
   magazine coverdisks/CDs that it would be nice to get something for my
   hard work!  The editor is `Freeware', however it would be nice if the
   users of the program sent me some of the following to show their
   appreciation;

    Cash (any currency, though English sterling will be more welcomed).
    Erasure's Wonderland CD album.
    Erasure's Crackers International CD EP.
    Any other Erasure CD singles.
    Plugins for Lightwave.
    Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (the adventure game).
    Any other software that you would like to give me, however make sure
     that it works on a machine with Workbench 3.1, and is compatible with
     an 060, or does not need fast ram if it is not compatible.
    Playstation games.

 Version   Date         Comments

 1.00      10.08.1996    First public release.

 1.10      11.08.1996    Removed the bug which stopped the jetpac being
                          detected and enabled if it had been used during a
                          game.
                         Released on Amiga Format cover disk AF90b.
                         Released on Games Blaster (Online PD).

 1.15      19.08.1996    Uses a new method of determining whether
                          reqtools.library exists, so as not opening the
                          library twice and so saving memory and creating a
                          smaller executable.
                         Added keyboard shortcuts to <L>oad, <S>ave and
                          <A>bout buttons.

 1.16      16.10.1996    Removed the bug with the rendering of the GUI
                          using a font other than topaz 8 as a screen font.
                         Released on Amiga Format cover CD 10.

 1.20      21.12.1996    After a large response of floppy disk users to the
                          program the default path of the requester has been
                          altered to default to `TKG2:' as this is where the
                          `boot.dat' file is for floppy users (or that is
                          what I have been told as I don't actually have the
                          game myself).
                         Added a keyboard shortcut key to the `TKG2:'
                          <P>ath to activate the string gadget.
                         Added a proper version string to the executable so
                          that if you are using a program like DOpus you can
                          copy the new file over properly.
                         Changed the file requester gadget size so that in
                          the future the proper workbench file requester
                          image can be used.
                         Changed the keyboard reading routine so that it
                          uses vannila keys and not raw keys, this does not
                          rely on keyboard layout and so any keymap can be
                          used correctly.
                         Changed the about window so that it included my
                          telephone number and address so that you know how
                          to contact me with out having to keep the guide.
                         Removed the bug where if you chose an option that
                          has a keyboard shortcut with the mouse or key and
                          then chose another option with a keyboard shortcut
                          the last option you chose would also be activated.
                         Removed the bug where if you entered a new `TKG2:'
                          path in the string gadget before ever using the
                          file requster, the requester uses `TKG2:' and not
                          the entered path.
                         Removed the bug where if you clicked any of the
                          option buttons with the mouse they highlighted
                          twice.

 1.21      13.04.1997    Recompiled with the awesome Blitz Support Suite.
                         Changed the email address and BBS number to the
                          new correct ones.
                         Made the editor a fully functioning commodity.
                         Added images to the guide.
                         Optimised the code making the final executable
                          require fractionally less memory and slightly
                          smaller in size.
                         Removed the bug where if you deselected one of
                          either the `laser / mega laser' or `plasma /
                          multiplasma' while one of each was selected the
                          ammunition bar did not ghost.
