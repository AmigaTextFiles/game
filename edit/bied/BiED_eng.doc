                                                   version 1.1


                            Instructions of use
                               (quite short)



                              I. Installation
                              ---------------

                         1.Change working directory

 The Editor ('BiED') itself uses the following files:

			LIBS:	arp.library
			LIBS:	req.library
				DESERT.SET
				NORMAL.SET (in known directories)
These have to exist on the maindisk.

 Hardware limits: Kick 1.2+, 512+k RAM.
It might be useful to copy these files, too:
			S:	SetUp.DEF
			S:	Reset.DEF

Use the installation script 'BIED/BIED.init' to copy the Editor & files
to a new device: Usage:

                    BiEd.init <sourcedevice> <targetdev>



                          2. Further preparations

 To play your own levels, you have to copy your Battle Isle original,
that gurantees that the old original levels won't get lost.
Use		diskcopy BI2: DF0:	to copy your maindisk (disk 2).
If you use a HD, cd into DHn:BI/, rename 'maps' into 'old_maps' or anything,
and create a new directory 'maps' by 'makedir maps' where you can save
your new levels to.


                             3. Getting started

       Just start 'BiED1.1', or 'BiED1.1X' if you're not registred...
NOTE: Some pathes may point to unknwon/wrong directories. Just reset them,
and save setup. Next run, they'll be set as you set them.




   (this is just a little introduction, the full documentation is written
       in German and named 'BiEd_dt.doc'... sorry, but I'm German...)


                                II. Editor
                                -----------

                              1.Main Display

 The main display contains the edit field and 4 available additional
tool windows. Those additional toolwindows migth be closed using the close-
gadget or selecting their menuitem, again.

                              1.1. Edit field

 A klick onto one of the hexfields will place either the actual unit (edit-
more: UNIT) or the actual landscape (editmode: LAND) at this position.
 You can change 'editmode' using SPACE, Tools/Editmode or the right mouse-
button (optional, if 'Setup/Right MB' is selected). Furthermore the mode
will change to LAND, if you select a LAND piece, or to UNIT if you select
a unit.

                             1.2. LANDS Window

 Open it by 'Windows/Lands'. Use it to select a new landscape to set into
the map. Change its layout and optional keydefinitions by 'Setup/Landeditor'.
You may scroll through the whole piece list using the cursorkeys WITHOUT
shift or CAPS, WITH caps & shift together or none of them.

                             1.3. UNITS Window

'Windows/Units' enables you to get a new actual unit. Change settings by
'Setup/Landeditor'.
 Scroll contence by SHIFT OR CAPS + Cursorkeys.

                             1.4. STATS Window

'Windows/Stats' shows current BiED status: Actual landscape & unit, position
of the most left, top brick in the whole level, coordinates of the last
edited piece and the current editmode (UNIT/LAND).

                              1.5. MOVE Window

'Windows/Move' offsers a movewindow. Use gadgets to move visible part of
the level (8 direction gadgets around, and one proportional inside).


                             2. Menues

How to call a function:
e.g:		'Project/LoadLevel¹ [A]L'
		 |		  |   |
		 a)		  c)  b)

You select it by	a) by selecting the menuitem (oups! :-)
			b) by right AMiga + L
			c) by L without any qualifier (if Setup/Direct is
			   enabled).
All functions which have a ¹ behind their names can be called by right-
Amiga + KEY or by the KEY alone, if Setup/direct is been selected.
If Setup/Direct is unselected, you can alloc these keys with landscapes/
units.

                             2.1. Projekt Menu
