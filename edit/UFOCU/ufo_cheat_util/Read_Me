Introduction [and NTSC users]

  UFO_Cheat_Util is a program I made a long time ago for my own needs.
  Since some UFO fans requested this cheat utility I decided to fine tune
  it a little bit and release it. However, NTSC users will notice a bit
  unusual support for their screen modes. Instead of displaying only 200
  lines you get the usual 256 PAL-lines (of which only 200 are visible) and
  are then able to scroll the screen up and down using the mouse pointer.

  This is just a quick and dirty support for NTSC users since I didn't have 
  time to do it like I really should. Hope it's enough.



Running UFO_Cheat_Util.

  When you run UFO_Cheat_Util it will make modifications to the files
  in the save game drawers, Game_1 -> Game_5. Once you have used this
  cheat you can never get the old information in these drawers back.
  So I suggest you make a backup of these drawers in case you decide
  you don't like the new configuration made by this program.



What can you do with UFO_Cheat_Util?

  You can configure the following things:
  
  Time Units through Psionic Skill
  Funds
  Elerium-115
  Rank
  Armour
  Dead or Alive



Known Bugs.

  If you select 'Dead' on a soldier who is Alive, the soldier will still
  be alive.
  The 'Alive' button is used to bring dead soldiers into life.
  The 'Dead' button is just to display if a soldier is dead.



Additional

  When running UFO_Cheat_Util any wounded soldiers will be recovered.
