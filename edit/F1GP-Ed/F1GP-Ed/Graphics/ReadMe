EXAMPLE BACKDROP PICTURE

   Filename               Prepared by      Notes
   --------               -----------      -----

   c_champ_ferrari.ilbm   Oliver Roberts   Replacement for c_champ.bkg
                                           Converted from a JPG of
                                           Ferrari's new 1997 engine


I don't plan to include any more example backdrop pictures with F1GP-Ed,
because they use up too much space.  I could have filled the drawer with
30 or so examples, but that would have made the archive huge ;-)  I'm
sure people will make their own backdrop files - there are plenty of
high quality pictures to choose from on the internet.  Personally, I
use Photogenics 2a along with PPaint 7.1 to convert the pictures into
the required format.
