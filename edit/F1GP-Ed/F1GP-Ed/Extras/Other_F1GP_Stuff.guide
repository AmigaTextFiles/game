All the programs described in this guide can be found on the Amiga Formula
One Web Site (http://www.nanunanu.org/~oliver/AmigaF1.html), and some of
them are also available on Aminet (in the locations shown).

Most of these programs are also available on the "F1GP Accessories" disk.
I used to send regularly updates of this disk to 17 Bit Software (PD library
in the UK), but as 17 Bit (and many other PD libraries) aren't as interested
in selling floppy disks nowadays I don't send them updates very often :(

SplitTime is a utility that displays split times at every quarter of a
track while you drive F1GP (so you need that game to use it). Not only
the splittimes are displayed, but also the best splittimes before they
show up (like on TV).  There are 3 split times on every track and
they are at exactly 25%, 50% and 75% distances, while on TV they now
use only 2 split times (intermediates) at specific points on the track.

   Aminet:  game/misc/AGPPerf.lha
      WWW:  http://www.nanunanu.org/~oliver/utils/AGPPerf.html

This program is based fairly loosely on the PC version of GPPerf.
It records telemetry of your F1 car as you drive around the track in
F1GP, and allows you to then save it to disk for viewing with some
other displaying utility (ie @{"GPDisplay" link GPDisplay}).  It also puts some cute extra
little lights on the dashboard.

            game/misc/GPDisplayTrack.lha
      WWW:  http://www.nanunanu.org/~oliver/utils/GPDisplay.html

This program will display perf files saved from @{"AGPPerf" link AGPPerf}, or directly
from AGPPerfs memory.  It allows comparison and analysis of up to 4
perf files at once, plus it has some (very) rudimentary editing
facilities.

      WWW:  http://www.nanunanu.org/~oliver/utils/AGPLapTime.html
            http://www.xs4all.nl/~rsdi/

This program can record various things whilst you are driving.  It can
be set up to record a whole race.  The resulting log file can be
viewed by an appropriate displaying utility (eg @{"AGPLap" link AGPLap}).  During a
race for example all fastest laps are recorded along with speed
factors, driving aids and the horsepower.  Pit stops, damage, crashes,
setups and many other things are logged.

Processes log files created by @{"AGPLapTime" link AGPLapTime}, and produces text describing
virtually every aspect of the race in detail.  Here is a brief snippet
of output from a Brazil race log file:

Merges separate @{"AGPLaptime" link AGPLapTime} log files together in one log file.  For example,
in the @{"Internet F1GP Championship" link IAF1GPC} all the drivers could send in log files
of their races.  This program can then take all these log files, an
recreate the race as if everybody was racing together.

  driver
· The names of every Team, and also their Engine names.  You can also
  change which driver drives for them.

   WWW:  http://www.nanunanu.org/~oliver/utils/F1GP-HFED.html

Allows you to alter the helmet images on the driver selection screen in
the game.  Simply design your helmets in any decent paint package and
use this program to convert them into the game.  Maybe useful to some
people I guess, but depends on how often you visit the driver select
screen (ie me -> very rarely :-)

option which automatically stores multiple successive frames from the game
which can then be used to make an animation
