@node "Intro" "Introduction"
With this editor you can customize your copy of MicroProse's Formula One
Grand Prix (or World Circuit).  Originally, I intended just to make an
editor similar to the ones for the PC which would simply allow you alter
the colours of cars, pit crews and helmets and change the way the computer
drivers drive and respond, making F1GP more difficult. But, as you will
discover, F1GP-Ed can do a whole lot more than that.  In fact, it is safe
to say that my editor is the most powerful F1GP/WC editor in existance,
easily out-performing the editors for the PC version.  Hence, the revised
aim of F1GP-Ed is to allow users to make F1GP more realistic and more
playable, by using a familiar easy-to-use interface.  This is how it all
started:

In February 1994, I discovered that editors were available for the PC
version of F1GP, and after asking everywhere I could think of, I could not
find an Amiga equivalent and I started to get jealous.  By coincidence, I
had just started a C course at Uni, so I decided to get the Complete Amiga
C package.  I then started work on an Amiga version, while learning how to
program the Amiga OS.  Then in April 1994, I released the first ever test
version to about 10 willing F1GP players.  From then, onwards F1GP-Ed has
been updated regularly. In April 1995 I began work on a major overhaul of
the editor resulting in F1GP-Ed 3.0.  What you have here is the latest
update of the V3 evolution :-)

I have supplied an example datafile which will convert your copy of F1GP,
so it plays like the real-life 1999 season, with the computer cars driving
at a more competitive speed!  This is the datafile I use myself, so you may
need to adjust a few things to suit yourself.  The lap-times churned out by
the computer cars will be alot faster than before and much faster than in
real life - the performance of your car is not modified (it would be
possible to make the computer cars travel the same speed as in real-life,
but your car would also have to be slowed down if you you didn't want to
win all the time!). It also contains some of my recent car setups and lap
records.

Some of the features in F1GP-Ed wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the
cooperation of fellow F1GP hackers - see the @{"Acknowledgments" link "Acknowledgements" 0} section.

For those of you who are interested F1GP-Ed was written in C and Assembler.
It was compiled with DICE 3.20 and Devpac 3.

@node "Distribution" "Distribution"
F1GP-Ed is DONATIONWARE.  It is NOT Public Domain or Freeware.  However, it
may be freely distributed legally providing:

   (1) None of the distributed files are changed in any way
   (2) F1GP-Ed is not sold for profit and it is not included on any disks
       that are sold solely for profit (includes magazine coverdisks)
   (3) No more than £2 (inclusive) may be charged for a copy of F1GP-Ed
       by PD libraries
   (4) Registered user keyfiles are @{b}NOT@{ub} distributed with copies of
       F1GP-Ed, with the exception of the special FREE keyfile supplied as
       of November 2010 (filesize 315 bytes)

If F1GP-Ed is to be sold for profit, permission must be obtained from me,
the author (Oliver Roberts).

Permission is granted to distribute this version of F1GP-Ed on Aminet CDs
and magazine coverdisk CD-ROMs.

F1GP-Ed @{b}MUST@{ub} be distributed with @{b}ALL@{ub} the original files, and no files may
be omitted in any redistribution!
@endnode

@node "Registration" "Registration"
F1GP-Ed was originally a shareware product, and cost 6 UKP / US$ 15 to
register.  Due to the lack of updates over past years, general lack of
interest from both users and myself, I decided long ago to release a free
keyfile - it just took me a couple of years to actually get around to
sorting it all out :-)

@{b}HOW TO REGISTER@{ub}

Registration is no longer necessary, and all features are enabled via the
free F1GP-Ed.key file supplied in this archive.

However, should you wish to make a donation, please visit
http://www.amigaf1.co.uk/F1GP-Ed/ and find out the options available.


@{b}LIMITATIONS OF THE UNREGISTERED VERSION@{ub}

A requester will appear whenever you start and exit F1GP-Ed, reminding you
that you should register.  Also, some of the features are disabled
including:

 * Palette, car setup and lap record editors
 * Some of the memory patches
 * All of the "Other" windows (i.e. sound, graphics, backdrops, stats
   and the calculator)
 * Saving to / loading from memory

The absence of these features doesn't make F1GP-Ed unusable!  Most features
that I will add in future versions will also be disabled.
@endnode

@node "Disclaimer" "Disclaimer"
I cannot guarantee that every possible combination of the settings in
F1GP-Ed will affect F1GP as intended.

I cannot be held liable if this program causes your copy of Formula One
Grand Prix / World Circuit to become corrupt, nor can I be blamed if this
program causes any other problems with your system.  Any problems are
entirely the user's responsibility.

@{b}Do not@{ub} attempt to tamper with F1GP-Ed keyfiles and/or the executable. Doing
so will cause problems and you may find things start going wrong!

@{b}*** IMPORTANT ***@{ub} Please use a backup of the game, before you start
altering the binary. Then you will have another copy of the game if it gets
corrupted (ie power failure when saving). Never use F1GP-Ed on your
original copy of the game.

F1GP-Ed is NOT officially endorsed by MicroProse Software.

INSTALLER SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS-IS" AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE; NO WARRANTIES
ARE MADE.  ALL USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.  NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY IS
ASSUMED.
@endnode

@node "Requirements" "System Requirements"
Any Amiga computer and an original copy of Formula One Grand Prix / World
Circuit by MicroProse - this must be version 1.02 (this is the only version
in existance as far as I know - see the @{"F1GP Versions" link "F1GPVersions" 0} section).

Registered users should make sure the "F1GP-Ed.key" file is in the current
dir, or the location specified by the @{"KEYPATH tooltype/cli option" link "Args" 38}.

Disk based libraries that should be in the LIBS: drawer on your boot disk.
Libraries marked "required" must be present for F1GP-Ed to run, while
"optional" libraries don't have to be present, but certain features will
not be available:

   @{b}Kickstart 1.x:@{ub}
      gadtools13.library                (required)
      reqtools.library                  (required)

      datatypes.library                 (optional)
      picture.datatype                  (optional)

More than 1Mb of free ram is needed, if you want to use the @{"memory patches" link "MemPatches" 0}
or memory @{"load" link "Menu_Load" 0}/@{"save" link "Menu_Save" 0} features.

The stack needs to be set to at least 4000 bytes either from the icon
information or from the CLI.  KS 2.0+ owners will get error messages to
remind you to set the stack.


@{b}@{u}COMPATIBILITY@{ub}@{uu}

F1GP-Ed will work on all Amigas, and this version has been tested on a
A1200.  With the following kickstarts being put to test: 1.3, 2.05, 3.0,
3.1

A number of memory configurations, accelerators, HDs, etc, were also used.

F1GP-Ed will work fine on all Kickstarts, but it works best with KS 3.x, as
KS 3.x includes various changes which F1GP-Ed takes advantage of. KS 1.x
users may notice slight irregularities - this is due to the imperfect
GadTools emulation.
@endnode

@node "GettingStarted" "Getting Started"
For hard drive installation - just double-click on the "Install_F1GP-Ed"
icon from Workbench, after booting from your hard drive as usual and
inserting the F1GP-Ed disk.  All necessary files will be installed,
including system libraries (only if no versions exist, or the existing
versions are old). Commodore's Installer program must be accessable.

There are two ways of running F1GP-Ed from Workbench:

  (1) Double-click on the F1GP-Ed icon.  
  (2) Double-click on a F1GP-Ed datafile icon.  F1GP-Ed will be loaded
      and the selected datafile will be loaded automatically.

You can also start F1GP-Ed via a @{"CLI or Shell" link "Shell" 0} if you prefer.
@endnode

@node "Shell" "Starting F1GP-Ed from a Shell"
F1GP-Ed command-line processing is carried out in the standard KS 2.0 way
(ie using ReadArgs()).  Users with previous kickstart versions are forced
to customize soley via tooltypes, as the cutdown usage is:

   F1GP-Ed <datafile> 
     where datafile is the name of a datafile you wish to load

Now that's out of the way those of you with KS 2.0 or higher may read on :)
Each parameter specified overrides the corresponding tooltype value (if it
exists) in the F1GP-Ed icon.  The parameters are identical to the tooltypes
and are NOT case sensitive and can be specified in any order. The template
is:

   @{"DATAFILE,LOADF1GP/S,DELAY/K/N,SAVETOMEM/S,PATCH/S,QUIT/S,FONT/K," link "Args" 0}
   @{"FONTSIZE/K/N,PUBSCREEN/K,KEYPATH/K,HELPFILE/K,NOACTIVATE/S,NOGUI/S" link "Args" 0}

Examples of running F1GP-Ed from a Shell (note that the actual result can
depend on what tooltypes you have set in the F1GP-Ed icon):

   F1GP-Ed ?

Displays the template that is shown above and waits for you to continue
entering parameters.

   F1GP-Ed DATAFILE=1995.f1gp PATCH NOGUI LOADF1GP

Load F1GP-Ed with settings from the 1995.f1gp datafile, then attempt to
load F1GP, enable all memory patches and wait until F1GP is quitted before
exiting.  No windows will be opened.

   F1GP-Ed 1994.f1gp FONT=topaz.font FONTSIZE=8

Load F1GP-Ed with settings from the 1994.f1gp datafile and open windows
using the topaz 8 font.

   F1GP-Ed DATAFILE 1995.f1gp KEYPATH PROGDIR:

Load F1GP-Ed with settings from the 1995.f1gp datafile and load your
personal keyfile from the same directory that F1GP-Ed is located in - not
always the same as the current directory!

   F1GP-Ed SAVETOMEM 1995.f1gp NOGUI

Load F1GP-Ed and save the settings from the 1995.f1gp datafile to the copy
of F1GP currently running in memory, and then quit.
@endnode

@node "QuickstartGuide" "Quickstart Guide"
If you want to convert your copy of F1GP so that it uses the 1999.f1gp
datafile supplied with F1GP-Ed, then here is one way to do it (after you've
made sure you have a backup of F1GP, of course):

 o @{"Load F1GP-Ed" link "GettingStarted" 0}

 o Select @{"Load from >> Datafile..." link "Menu_Load" 4} from the "Project" menu

 o Select the "1999.f1gp" file and click on "Load"

 o Make sure the @{"F1GP Binary" link "WinMain" 17} path in the main window is set correctly: if
   you have a hard drive then select the "f1gp" file in the relevant
   drawer, otherwise just put F1GP disk 2 (@{"versions A & B" link "F1GPVersions" 5}) or disk 1
   (@{"version C" link "F1GPVersions" 17} - change the path from "f1gp_disk_#2:f1gp" to
   "f1gp_disk_#1:f1gp") in any floppy disk drive.

 o Select @{"Save to >> F1GP Binary..." link "Menu_Save" 6} from the "Project" menu

 o Read the message and click on "OK"

 o When disk activity has finished, load F1GP in the usual way

This will provide you with an updated version of F1GP - you can also
customize many other features too by experimenting with F1GP-Ed.  It is
also possible to save directly to memory (ie without reloading the game)
@endnode

@node "Config" "Configuration"
F1GP-Ed may be customized via @{"valid icon tooltypes" link "Args" 0}, as well as from the
@{"Settings" link "Menus" 0} menu. Tooltypes may be changed by selecting the F1GP-Ed icon and
selecting @{i}Information@{ui} from the Workbench @{i}Icons@{ui} menu - consult your
Workbench manual if you don't know how to operate the resulting window.

For instance, I like to set the following tooltypes:

   DATAFILE=PROGDIR:1999.f1gp
   KEYPATH=PROGDIR:

(note that PROGDIR: was introduced in KS 2.0 - it refers to the location of
the currently running program, which is F1GP-Ed in this case)

For examples and information on how to use command line arguments, see the
@{"starting F1GP-Ed from the shell section" link "Shell" 0}.

@{b}@{u}Datafile icon@{ub}@{uu}

Provided you turned the @{"Create Icons" link "Menu_CreateIcons" 0} option on, F1GP-Ed will always create
an icon for any datafiles that you save.  This is a built-in icon by
default.  However, if you would prefer to use a different icon, then you
may copy it to ENVARC:Sys/def_F1GP-Ed.info and F1GP-Ed will use that icon
instead.
@endnode

@node "Args" "Tooltypes / Command-line options"
@{b}DATAFILE@{ub} (string - example: DATAFILE=1999.f1gp)
   This command to tells F1GP-Ed to load a specific datafile, rather than
using the defaults.  This command supercedes the "Autoload" feature found
in previous versions of F1GP-Ed.

@{b}LOADF1GP@{ub} (switch)
   Runs F1GP automatically.  This basically executes this command: "Run
>NIL: <gamefile>", where <gamefile> is the contents of the @{"F1GP Binary" link "WinMain" 17}
gadget and is loaded from the config file.  By default the command will be
"run >NIL: f1gp_disk_#2:f1gp".

@{b}DELAY@{ub} (number - example: DELAY=150)
   Delay the starting of F1GP-Ed by a specified number of ticks (50 per
second - e.g. 150 ticks = 3 seconds).  This is mainly of use when using the
LOADF1GP option and will delay any initial patch installations or memory
saves.  For example, if you use the LOADF1GP and SAVETOMEM options together
and F1GP-Ed complains that F1GP isn't in memory then use this feature to
give the operating system time start F1GP.

@{b}SAVETOMEM@{ub} (switch)
   Basically, performs the same function as the Save to Memory Project menu
item.

@{b}PATCH@{ub} (switch)
   Installs all memory patches, as per the Install Patches Memory menu
item. If NOGUI is also specified, then F1GP-Ed will wait until F1GP quits
before it terminates.

@{b}QUIT@{ub} (switch)
   This makes F1GP-Ed quit automatically when you exit the game.  This
always happens when using the PATCH and NOGUI options together, so this
option has no effect in that case.

@{b}FONT@{ub} (string - example: FONT=topaz.font)
   Choose a font for F1GP-Ed to use.  If not specified the default screen
font will be used.  Note that if the specified font or the screen font are
too large to be used for certain windows (ie the resulting window would not
fit on the screen), Topaz 8 will be used.

@{b}FONTSIZE@{ub} (number - example: FONTSIZE=8)
   Specify the size (height) of the font specified by the FONT command.

@{b}PUBSCREEN@{ub} (string - example: PUBSCREEN=Workbench)
   Specify a public screen for F1GP-Ed to open on. By default, the public
screen is the Workbench screen.

@{b}KEYPATH@{ub} (string - example: KEYPATH=S:)
   Select the path from which to load the "F1GP-Ed.key" file (if you have
@{"registered" link "Registration" 0}).  If not specified F1GP-Ed will look for the keyfile in the
current directory.

@{b}HELPFILE@{ub} (string - example: HELPFILE=PROGDIR:F1GP-Ed_deutsch.guide)
   Select the location of the F1GP-Ed AmigaGuide file.  By default this is
F1GP-Ed_english.guide in the same drawer as F1GP-Ed (current directory on
Kickstart 1.x)

@{b}NOACTIVATE@{ub} (switch)
   When opening windows on startup, they will not be activated.  And if you
preferences are for F1GP-Ed to use a custom screen, then that screen will
not be brought to the front.

@{b}NOGUI@{ub} (switch)
   Do not open any windows, thus disabling user interaction.
@endnode

@node "MyHelp" "AmigaGuide® On-Line Help"
F1GP-Ed supports AmigaGuide®, thus enabling the possibility of on-line
help. To get help when using F1GP-Ed, simply press the "Help" key and you
will get help about the current window or menu item.  All that is required
is that amigaguide.library is available and the F1GP-Ed.guide database is
in the same directory as F1GP-Ed or as specified by @{"HELPFILE" link "Args" 45}.

F1GP-Ed sports a dynamic help system, meaning that the help file and
amigaguide.library are only opened when required (ie pressing the "Help"
key).

Note: Workbench 1.x owners have to press the key with a "|" and/or a "\"
symbol on it (near backspace key on English keyboards) instead of the
"Help" key due to technical reasons.  Also, you can not directly get help
on menu items.
@endnode

@node "F1GPVersions" "F1GP Versions"
I currently know of 3 different versions of F1GP.  Unfortunatly, they all
have the same version number (1.02).  F1GP-Ed will work on all of them.  It
may fail on pirate versions, so go and buy the original now if you have not
already done so.  Pirate versions will never be supported, intentionally.

If you have a version of F1GP which is different to those below, please let
me know so I can support it in F1GP-Ed.  Here are the differences, sizes
and locations of the "f1gp" binary file which is altered by F1GP-Ed:

@{b}(A) Formula One Grand Prix - 4 disks@{ub} (f1gp_disk_#2:f1gp = 582992 bytes)

The original version which is hard-coded for PAL machines.  This version
has also been re-released on the PowerPlus budget label.

@{b}(B) World Circuit - 4 disks@{ub} (f1gp_disk_#2:f1gp = 582780 bytes)

US version of F1GP which is hard-coded for NTSC machines. There is no
manual selection screen as the English manual is assumed. All occurences of
"Formula One Grand Prix" text are replaced by "World Circuit". In (A) you
have to set up the overscan preferences to a certain position, otherwise
the left-hand side of the game screen would be @{b}chopped@{ub} off, with a black
border on the LHS of the screen. This problem has been corrected in this
version.

There are some other minor changes as well and it is reasonable to assume
that some other bugs have also been fixed.

@{b}(C) Formula One Grand Prix - 3 disks@{ub} (f1gp_disk_#1:f1gp = 582988 bytes)

This version of F1GP was bundled with the A600 Wild, Weird & Wicked pack,
and hence the intro was omitted to save on disks.  This version is really a
hybrid of (A) and (B).  That is to say it is the same as (A), but with bug
fixes and other minor changes present in (B). God knows why the 2 keypad
keys used by F1GP weren't remapped to keys that are available on the A600 -
that's MicroProse for you!
@endnode

@node "F1GPSavedGames" "Notes on F1GP Saved Games"
When saving a game from F1GP, these things are always saved, and will
overwrite settings in the F1GP binary when loaded (this isn't a
comprehensive list!):

 * Current settings from the "Race Options" menu
 * Current car setups
 * Names of teams, engines and drivers
 * Km or Miles per hour

Games saved mid-race also hold the following information:

 * Wet or dry race (decided when you start pre-race practice)
 * Action replay data
 * Car positions and lap times
 * Default car to be viewed after a replay or continuation
   (this should be your car, but due to a bug in F1GP it isn't always)
 * Player HP - this temporary value is reset to the one in the binary when
   exiting to the pits or starting a new session
 * Camera angles

Notable settings that are NOT saved in save game files:

 * Frame rate
 * Team engine HPs
 * Speed factors

Therefore you may experience problems if you save a game, alter the
allocation of drivers to teams using the @{"Team Editor" link "WinTeam" 0}, and then load that
same game.  If you make changes to any of the settings above they will
always be replaced by the ones in the save game file.  All other settings
in the binary should remain unchanged when loading games.
@endnode

@node "Problems" "Known Bugs"
@{b}@{u}Bugs in F1GP-Ed@{ub}@{uu}

If you run the game at high frame rates (20+ ???), then go into race mode,
and sometimes in other modes, the car will spin to its left around its
axis. This is probably due to some calculations (the game makes)
overflowing, as it was not intended to be run at high frame rates :-(

If you are using Grant's interrupt routines, and using autogears, then you
will find that when the car is in neutral, and you push forward, the car
will gear down into reverse, instead up into 1st. This is very annoying. My
suggested solution is to disable the interrupt routines via the PatchF1GP
window (but you then miss all the buffering features).

When using the Position Snapshot keys, there is a small chance, that for
some odd reason, your car will have very low air resistance.  This usually
happens if you "restore" your position when you were/are behind a car and
hence picking up the tow.  This bug does not occur if you deselect all the
computer drivers (ie make them all controllable by the player(s)).

@{b}@{u}Bugs in the game@{ub}@{uu} (exist without using F1GP-Ed)

The game intro won't run directly on AGA Amigas, but the game itself will.
You don't need to switch to ECS on the "Early Startup Control" menu, unless
you want to see the intro properly.  Of course, you could bypass the intro
altogether (like I do).

A major problem with the game is that it will lock-up when you enter the
cockpit, if the VBR (Vector Base Register) is located in fast ram.
Generally, this only happens on 68030/040/060 based machines, and usually
SetPatch moves the VBR to fast ram by default.  If you experience this
problem you should use a program that resets the VBR, like ResetVBR or
Embedder for example. These programs are available on Aminet. However, this
should no longer be necessary if you have @{"f1gp.library" link "f1gplib" 0} v35.3 installed -
this automatically makes F1GP to use the VBR.

During qualifying if you drive into the pits after your first run and then
go out again the pit light will be lit whenever you cross the start/finish
line (even after your warm-up lap!).  The solution is to either press the
'Q' key to return to the pits and/or use the @{"Pit Light Off" link "WinPrefs" 42} feature in
F1GP-Ed.

If you do a replay (viewing another car) shortly after leaving the pit
lane, the game messes up.  For example, enter a qualifying session in USA
and wait for some computer cars to go out.  Then drive out and around the
first corner and then pause the game.  Do a replay, and switch to another
car.  Then, if you try and return to your car or the replay finishes, you
will still be in the pit lane instead of on the track.  The game may go
into accelerated time or something and it is sometimes difficult to get out
of it!

There are bugs on some circuits - notably Brazil, where if you go off line
after the two chicanes your car switches position on the track for no
reason.  In Montreal, if you cut across the slowest chicane, when you
complete the lap your lap time is not registered.

Race lap records do not seem to be registered when playing the game as
driver #40.  This is weird, as the qualifying records work fine, so don't
play as driver #40, if you can help it.  This is a bug in F1GP, but then
again F1GP doesn't usually use driver #40 :-)

This isn't really a bug, but more of a limitation.  If you have replaced
any of the backdrop files using F1GP-Ed and F1GP sometimes issues a "Not
Enough Memory" error, then it means some of the .bkg files are too large.
See the @{"backdrop limitations" link "BkgLimits" 0} section for more information.

@node "Simultaneous" "Running F1GP and F1GP-Ed at the same time"
If you are having problems working out how to run F1GP-Ed and the game at
the same time (eg to make use of memory patches and the memory save
features), then read on...

As F1GP does not disable the system when you are not actually playing it
(ie using the menus), it is possible to run any other program (eg a mod
player) you wish while F1GP is running in memory (memory permitting) due to
the fact that the Amiga is a multi-tasking computer.  F1GP-Ed takes
advantage of this fact to provide some unique features.

To run the game and F1GP-Ed at the same time and you don't have a hard
drive, then boot your F1GP-Ed disk and load F1GP-Ed.  Then insert F1GP disk
2 (or disk 1 if you have @{"version C" link "F1GPVersions" 0}) and double-click on the game icon.  Of
course, you will need more than 1Mb of free ram to do this and if you have
then you should now have both programs running.  The principle is the same
for hard drive owners, except there will be no need for disk swaps.

To switch between using F1GP-Ed and playing the game, you can make use of
these standard Amiga keyboard shortcuts (L-Amiga is an abbreviation for the
Amiga key to the left of the spacebar):

   L-Amiga N     Bring the Workbench screen to the front of the display
   L-Amiga M     Cycle through all open screens

If a screen has a gadget in the top-right corner you can click on this to
cycle the screens, also.  If you have @{"saved to the binary" link "Menu_Save" 0} at least once an
invisible screen cycle gadget is available on the F1GP screen, so you can
click in the top-right corner to switch screens, just like with the
Workbench screen.

@endnode

@node "WinMain" "Using F1GP-Ed"
The heart of F1GP-Ed is the main window.  From here you can open any of the
other windows.  Other actions are performed via the @{"Menus" link "Menus" 0} which are brought
into view with the right mouse button, from any of F1GP-Ed's windows.

There are three main catagories of windows in F1GP-Ed:

 @{" File Editors   " link "FileEditors" 0}
 @{" Memory Patches " link "MemPatches" 0}
 @{" Other          " link "OtherWins" 0}

It is important that you understand the differences between these three
basic types, and then you will find it easier to use F1GP-Ed to its full
potential. To put things into perspective 99% of all the features available
in versions 1 and 2 of F1GP-Ed would be classed as File Editors.

There is one important gadget, which should be set correctly:

@{b}F1GP Binary@{ub}
   Specify the location of the main F1GP file.  This defaults to the "f1gp"
file on disk 2.  Generally, you won't need to change this - even if you
have the game on a hard drive you will have a f1gp_disk_#2 assign anyway.
If you have @{"version C" link "F1GPVersions" 0} of the game you will need to alter this to
"f1gp_disk_#1:f1gp".  For any feature which involves saving to the F1GP
binary to work, you must make sure this is set correctly.
 (default is "f1gp_disk_#2:f1gp")
@endnode

@node "FileEditors" "File Editors"
@next "MemPatches"
@prev "Menus"
Generally, these windows allow you to customize currently available
features in F1GP.  Each window contains a number of similar or related
settings. Every setting in each of these windows can be saved in F1GP-Ed
datafiles.

For the settings to take effect in F1GP itself, you must either save
directly to the F1GP binary (and run the game afterwards) or to a @{"running" link "Simultaneous" 0}
@{"copy of F1GP in memory" link "Simultaneous" 0}.

The File Editors consist of the following windows:

 @{" Teams " link "WinTeam" 0}
 @{" Drivers " link "WinDriver" 0}
 @{" Car Setups " link "WinSetup" 0}
 @{" Lap Records " link "WinRecord" 0}
 @{" Camera Views " link "WinCamera" 0}
 @{" Car Control " link "WinControl" 0}
 @{" Standard Options " link "WinOptions" 0}
 @{" In-Game Prefs " link "WinGame" 0}
 @{" Preferences " link "WinPrefs" 0}
 @{" Cheats " link "WinCheat" 0}
 @{" Display " link "WinDisplay" 0}
 @{" Colours " link "WinPalette" 0}
 @{" Wet Weather " link "WinWet" 0}
 @{" Car Shape " link "WinShape" 0}
@endnode

@node "WinTeam" "The Team Editor"
@toc "FileEditors"
The Team Editor allows you to alter team settings in a similar way to that
of F1GP itself.  The difference is that this editor allows you to change
relative team performances, car numbers, the number of teams to compete and
more.

You select the teams via the listview gadget at the left of the window.
Underneath this gadget are buttons to move the positions of the selected
team and also a cycle gadget which allows you to view the teams in their
physical F1GP order (@{b}Normal@{ub}) or in the order of garage position in the pit
lane (@{b}Pit Order@{ub}).  In the case of the Pit Order the top of the list
represents the pit bay closest to the pit entrance and the bottom
represents the bay next to the pit lane exit.

@{b}Team Name@{ub}
   Name of the selected team.

@{b}Engine@{ub}
   Name of the team's engine.

@{b}HP@{ub}
   Horsepower setting for the team's cars.  This will determine how quickly
computer controlled cars can accelerate.  Values between 0 and 1431 are
accepted.  The higher the setting, the faster the cars in that team will
accelerate in relation to the others.
 (default is 716 for the fastest teams)

@{b}Driver A@{ub}
   Use the slider to select a driver from the list of drivers specified by
you in the @{"Driver Editor" link "WinDriver" 0}.  Legal values are 0-40 (0 means that the car will
not participate in any events).  Note that strange driver combinations may
cause the game to get confused (and maybe crash).

@{b}Driver B@{ub}
   Select the second driver - as above.

@{b}Global HP@{ub}
   This will increase/decrease each cars HP setting by 5.  You do this by
clicking on the "+" or "-" gadgets.

@{b}Edit Car@{ub}
   Click this button to bring up a @{"colour editor" link "WinColour" 0} so that you can alter the
colour and design of the cars.  You should be aware that the style of the
first team's car is different from all the others.  The first team has a
car with a different nose design (ie McLaren style nose).

@{b}Edit Pit Crew@{ub}
   Click this button to bring up a @{"colour editor" link "WinColour" 0} so that you can alter the
colours of the pit crews.

@{b}Max Teams@{ub}
   This determines how many of the teams will actually be used by F1GP. You
can select between 1 and 20 teams.  You will be warned if you don't have
enough drivers.
 (default is 18 teams)

@{b}Speed Factor@{ub}
   Increasing this value will make computer cars go faster along straights
and around corners without affecting HP settings.  This allows the cars to
make more challenges and brake later into the corners - this is NOT a real
solution to the early braking techniques employed by computer cars, but it
is the next best thing.  This value is applied to all circuits.  Values
between 15000 and 32767 are acceptable.  This setting has been superceded
by the @{"Local Speed Factors" link "WinSFactor" 0} memory patch.
 (default is 16384)

@{b}Risk Factor@{ub}
   Like the speed factor, increasing this value will make the computer cars
go faster.  It doesn't do quite the same thing though.  As far as I can
tell it alters some steering variable - the more you increase it the more
the rear of the car will slip out allowing the computer cars to lose
control.  It also specifies how fast the computer drivers @{b}think@{ub} they can go
around corners (i.e. setting it too high will result in kamikaze drivers
taking chicances at full whack!) - the speed factor adjusts how fast they
can actually go around corners without crashing. Another effect as a result
of increasing the risk factor is that it makes the computer cars more
aggressive, which allows them to overtake more often.  Unlike the speed
factor the risk factors are circuit based and are actually loaded from the
track files normally, so I advise you to use the @{"Local Risk Factors" link "WinRisk" 0} patch
instead if you can.  Values from 0 to 32767 are acceptable, although
decreasing the value from the default is pretty pointless and results in
seriously slow computer drivers.
 (global default is 17792)

@{b}Race Risk Factor@{ub}
   The same functionality as the risk factor described above.  However,
this value is used for races only.
 (global default is 16640)

@{b}Normal Risk Factor@{ub}
   Normally the risk factors are loaded from the separate track files.
Switch this off to allow to alter and use your own global risk factors.
 (default is on)
@endnode

@node "WinDriver" "The Driver Editor"
@toc "FileEditors"
The Driver Editor allows you to change driver names like you do in F1GP
itself, but it also lets you specify whether a driver should be selected
automatically, and their qualifying and race performances.

@{b}Name@{ub} 
   Name of the current driver.

@{b}Selected@{ub}
   Allows you to determine if a driver should automatically be selected
when you load F1GP.

@{b}Qual@{ub}
   How well a driver performs in Qualifying sessions.  This will determine
how fast the actual driver is (not taking the HP setting of the car into
account). Low values will ensure that the driver will driver reasonably
well, and high values will result in the driver spinning off too often.
This also affects how quickly the driver accelerates.  This will @{b}not@{ub} affect
starting positions if you skip the qualifying session - the HP values for
the teams are used to calculate the grid positions in that case. Acceptable
values 0-255.

@{b}Race@{ub}
   How well a driver performs in a Race.  Details as above.

@{b}Global Perform@{ub}
   This will increase/decrease each drivers' Qual and Race performances by
5. You do this by clicking on the "+" or "-" gadget.

@{b}Edit Helmet@{ub}
   Click this button to bring up a @{"colour editor" link "WinColour" 0} which will allow you to
change the colours of drivers' crash helmets.
@endnode

@node "WinColour" "The Colour Editors"
@toc "FileEditors"
The colour editors allow you to change the colours of the cars, helmets and
pit crews.  There is a window for each of the above, but each works in the
same way.  Basically, select a colour from the palette and then click on
the part of the car you wish to change - just like a fill type tool in
graphics programs.

When running on a 16 colour custom screen, F1GP-Ed will automatically
switch the palette of the screen when you switch between normal windows and
colour editor windows.

There are also two buttons in each colour editor - their actions are
described below:

@{b}All@{ub}
   Change the colour of the major parts to that of the currently selected
colour.

@{b}Undo@{ub}
   Resets the colours to what they were before you altered them.  Note that
the remembered colours are lost when you close the editor or select another
team or driver.
@endnode

@node "WinSetup" "The Car Setup Editor"
@toc "FileEditors"
This editor allows you to alter the car setup just like in F1GP itself. The
difference is that you can easily access all the setups a touch of a
button, without the need of loading each circuit and editing them via F1GP.
I'm not going to explain all the gadgets as most of them do the exactly the
same as the editor in F1GP, so consult your manual for more information.

Note that if you do not have the @{"Separate Qual/Race Setups" link "WinOptions" 0} option selected,
the @{b}race@{ub} setups will be used by F1GP in both qualifying and races.

The file operations described below deal with the same format files as F1GP
uses.

@{b}Computer Car Tyre Compound@{ub}
   By default, the tyre compound for computer cars at the start of a race
is based on a value in taken from the track files (which happens to be the
C compound on every circuit) and after a pit stop computer cars always use
C compound.  This option allows you to alter the compound to any of the
others.  Note that the tyre compound at the start of a race may vary: in
races < 25% distance the cars will get D compound, 25-50% C compound and >
50% they usually get what you specify (or maybe one compound softer).  Due
to the stupid pit strategy employed by the computer cars, it may be better
to set the compound to something harder so it lasts longer - then maybe
increase the @{"speed factor" link "WinTeam" 0} to account for their lost speed.

@{b}Default Tyre Compound@{ub}
   The is the default tyre compound that is selected when you are up on the
jacks in the pits.  Also, the computer driven cars always use this compound
after a pitstop.  Note that during qualifying or a wet race the default
selection will be qualifying tyres (if you haven't used them all) or wets
respectively.  This does not affect the tyre compound used at the start of
a race.
 (default is C compound)

@{b}Load@{ub}
   Load a single car setup, to replace the currently displayed one.

@{b}Save@{ub}
   Save the currently displayed car setup to a single car setup file.

@{b}Load Global@{ub}
   Load and replace all the 32 current setups with those in a global car
setups file.

@{b}Save Global@{ub}
   Save all the 32 setups currently loaded, in a separate global car setups
file.
@endnode

@node "WinRecord" "The Lap Record Editor"
@toc "FileEditors"
Select circuits from the list on the left, and use the cycle gadget to
switch between race and qualifying records.

@{b}Driver@{ub}
   The name of the driver.

@{b}Team@{ub}
   The name of the team.

@{b}Time@{ub}
   The lap time in the same format as in F1GP (ie min.sec.thousands). Valid
times range from 0:00.000 to 9:59.999.

@{b}Date@{ub}
   The date the lap time was set, in the same format as in F1GP (ie
DD.MM.YYYY).  Dates are checked for validity, and allowed dates range from
01.01.1978 to 10.11.2022.

@{b}Today@{ub}
   Clicking this button simply gets the current system date - it saves you
having to manually type the current date for newly set records.  Obviously,
your system clock must be correctly set for this feature to be of any use.

@{b}Load@{ub}
   Replace ALL current lap records with those from a F1GP lap records
file.

@{b}Load & Mix@{ub}
   Replaces only the current lap records which are slower than the ones in
the selected F1GP lap records file.  This is the same method that F1GP uses
when you load lap records.

@{b}Save@{ub}
   Save all current lap records to a F1GP lap records file.
@endnode

@node "WinCamera" "Camera Adjustment Window"
@toc "FileEditors"
It should be noted that the camera parameters below do not always produce
the results you would expect - so I suggest you experiment.

@{b}Length of Shot@{ub}
   The time a shot from the trackside camera should last, before viewing is
automatically switched to the next camera. Acceptable values range from 0
to 128.
 (default is 16)

@{b}Tracking Speed@{ub}
   How long the chase camera takes to catch up with the car. Acceptable
values range from 0 to 128.
 (default is 64)

@{b}Zoom@{ub}
   How close the camera is to the car.  High values mean the camera will be
very close.  Acceptable values range from 0 to 32767.  This affects the
chase views.
 (default is 30848)

@{b}Height@{ub}
   How high the camera is from ground level.  A value of 0 means ground
level. Acceptable values range from 0 to 8192, although a minimum of around
10 is suggested otherwise you will be looking up through the track at
floating cars!
 (default is 384)

@{b}Ride-Height@{ub}
   This affects only the view from the cockpit.  Physically the car will
always be at the same height.
 (default is 160)

@{b}Presets@{ub}
   There are 6 presets for you to choose from, which provide you with some
good, varied views.  You may only alter settings in the "Custom" preset.

@{b}Redefine Keys@{ub}
   @{"Redefine" link "WinKey" 0} the keys used to switch views and cars.
@endnode

@node "WinControl" "Car Control"
@toc "FileEditors"
These settings allow you to customize car control aspects that cannot be
preset by F1GP.

@{b}Redefine Keys@{ub}
   @{"Redefine" link "WinKey" 0} the left, right, brake & accelerate keys.

@{b}Keyboard Default@{ub}
   Automatically set F1GP so that it expects keyboard control as default.
This removes the need of having to press the "K" key for users who prefer
to play F1GP with the keyboard.
 (default is off)

@{b}Reverse Steering Help@{ub}
   Allows you to disable the "steering help" which the game usually
employs, but only while in reverse gear.
 (default is on)

@{b}Analog Gearchange@{ub}
   Allows you to use 2 different buttons on your analog joystick to change
up and down gears. With this method you can change down a gear while
accelerating and vice versa. Note: this feature cannot be @{"saved to memory" link "Menu_Save" 0}
while the @{"Car Control memory patch" link "WinPatchF1GP" 0} is active with Interrupt routines
enabled!
 (default is Buttons Equal)

@{b}Analog Super-Steering Help@{ub}
   Usually when playing with an analog joystick F1GP employs
"super-steering help".  As a result you can drive, moreorless, a whole lap
without steering at all - the game keeps you on the ideal driving line.
Turning this off will allow you to drive with the reduced steering help
that is used with keyboard and digital joystick control methods.
 (default is on)

@{b}Analog Joystick Calibration@{ub}
   Preset the six calibration figures that F1GP will use in analog joystick
mode.  These figures should be the ones that are displayed when you
calibrate your joystick in F1GP.  Once preset, you no longer have to
calibrate your joystick everytime you play F1GP.
@endnode

@node "WinOptions" "The Standard Options"
@toc "FileEditors"
The options in this window allow you to preset all the standard options
available in F1GP - more specifically all the options in the "Help
Options", "Race Options" and "Game Options" menus.  They are all described
in the F1GP manual and documentation, so I'm not going to describe each of
them here. Time to consult your manual, if you don't know what each option
is already :-)
@endnode

@node "WinGame" "In-Game Prefs "
@toc "FileEditors"
This window contains a number of settings which actually affect the game
while you are playing it.

@{b}Car Fragility@{ub}
   There are 4 different values which affect how easily you can damage your
wings or be put out the race in different situations.  This also applies to
the computer controlled cars. The lower the value the easier it will be to
damage your car. Values between 0 and 32767 are allowed.

@{b}Yellow Flag Delay@{ub}
   The amount of time before the marshalls start waving yellow flags (and
the computer cars slow down) after a car spins off (and is below 10mph).
Values ranging from 0 to 65 seconds are allowed.  At least 3 seconds is
recommended, otherwise your car may get removed from the pit lane!
 (default is 20 seconds)

@{b}Car Removal Delay@{ub}
   The amount of time before the marshalls start pushing stationary cars,
thus rendering that car "out of the race". Values ranging from 0 to 65
seconds are allowed.
 (default is 15 seconds)

@{b}Minimum Pitstop Time@{ub}
   This is the nominal amount of time it takes to complete a normal pitstop
(just changing tyres) during a race.  This time will vary in the game - a
random amount of time will be added (could be anything up to an extra 10
seconds). Don't set this too low or you won't have time to select the tyre
compound.
 (default is 6 seconds)

@{b}Damage Repair Time@{ub}
   The extra amount of time it takes to repair any wing damage (front, rear
or both) during a pitstop.  So, if you make a pit stop to repair damage,
the total time for your stop will actually be the minimum pitstop time +
damage repair time + some random amount.
 (default is 14 seconds)

@{b}Practice Fuel Load@{ub}
   Normally when you start a practice or qualifying session your car starts
off with 5 laps worth of fuel in it.  Obviously, the fuel decreases as you
drive around, but once it gets to 0 the weight of the car remains constant.
However, it can be reset by pressing the 'Q' key to get back to the pits -
if you drive into the pits you're fuel load isn't reset. Basically, the
less fuel you have on board the faster you can go.  So in qualifying you
might like to have this set to 0 laps.  A common complaint is the handling
of the car in pre-race practice - in this case you could increase the fuel
load to emulate the handling of the car at the beginning of a race.  Note
that this option doesn't affect the fuel load in races.  Values from 0 to
99 laps are allowed.
 (default is 5 laps)
@endnode

@node "WinPrefs" "Preferences"
@toc "FileEditors"
This window contains a number of settings which allow you to customize the
way F1GP runs - mainly when you are fiddling about with the awfully slow
menus (I recommend Fast GUI).

@{b}Default Dir@{ub}
   This is the directory/volume that F1GP will use for save games, etc.
 (default is DF0:)

@{b}Level Name@{ub}
   The text in that will appear in the middle level button on the "Race
Options" menu in F1GP.
 (default is 1991 Levels)

@{b}Quick Race Laps@{ub}
   The number of laps to be run for a Quick Race.
 (default is 3)

@{b}Qual Laps@{ub}
   The number of fast laps that can be completed on a single set of
qualifying tyres, before the pit light is switched on.  This affects all
cars.  Note that this doesn't affect the lastability of the tyres.
 (default is 1)

@{b}Fast GUI@{ub}
   Makes the F1GP GUI a bit less sluggish by speeding up the fades,
responses and displaying unnecessary screens for less time.
 (default is off)

@{b}Select Quick Race@{ub}
   Tell F1GP to ask you to select the circuit you wish to use for a Quick
Race.
 (default is off)

@{b}Skip Startup Menu@{ub}
   After loading F1GP, go straight to the main menu after you have entered
the correct password (skips the Quick Race option).
 (default is off)

@{b}Abandon Qualifying@{ub}
   Usually, when exiting qualifying mid-session you have to confirm that
you want to quit the session and start at the back of the grid. Enabling
this feature will remove that requester and F1GP will continue as if you
had clicked "Yes".
 (default is off)

@{b}No Joystick Menus@{ub}
   Normally, the F1GP menu system reads the joystick port, to allow the
menus to be navigated using a joystick.  However, if you have some other
device plugged into the joystick port (e.g. a dongle), then this can cause
problems.  For example, when typing in the password at the start of the
game, letters appear in reverse order!  Use this option to stop the menu
system reading the joystick port.
 (default is off - joystick menus on)

@{b}Pit Light Off@{ub}
   Switches the pit light off automatically when crossing the start/finish
line in qualifying. Now you don't have to turn it off manually every time
you've done a flying lap and want to do another one.  This does not affect
the computer driven cars.
 (default is off - pit light on)

@{b}Nice Audio@{ub}
   Prevents sound output being interrupted everytime the menus fade in,
which means you can play a music module in the background without it being
interrupted.
 (default is off)

@{b}File Filter@{ub}
   Preset the "Filter" button in F1GP file requesters.
 (default is off)

@{b}Quick Exit@{ub}
   Removes the "EXIT TO DOS - Are you sure?" requester that usually appears
when you want to exit the game.
 (default is off)

@{b}Quick Load/Save@{ub}
   Removes the 'GAME LOADED' style requesters that appear after
successfully loading/saving a game, lap records, car setups and names. Of
course, if the load/save fails, the error requester will still appear.
 (default is off)

@{b}Manual@{ub}
   Tell F1GP to automatically select a specific language for the manual
password protection.  This option has no effect on @{"version B" link "F1GPVersions" 0} as that only
uses the English manual.
 (default is Select as normal).

@{b}Timing@{ub}
   Change the timing according to whether you are running F1GP on a PAL or
NTSC system.  The "Auto Detect" option will use the correct timing for PAL
and NTSC systems, so the game will always run at the correct speed.  The
"Default" option use the standard F1GP timing routine.  One example is for
owners of 68000 Amigas which are not accelerated - set this to "Default"
and switch your Amiga to NTSC mode, either via "Early Startup Control" or a
utility such as degrader and then F1GP should run a little bit faster. This
option has no effect if you've set the frame rate to > 8 fps.

@{b}Points@{ub}
   The points to be awarded to the top 10 finishers in a championship
season. Valid points for places are in the range 1-49.  Use the vertical
slider to tell F1GP how many of the first finishers will get points - this
effectively sets unused points to 0.
 (default is 10, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1)
@endnode

@node "WinCheat" "Cheats"
@toc "FileEditors"
All the options in this window (with the possible exeption of Degrade HP),
allow you to increase the performance of your car and generally cheat.

@{b}All Driving Aids@{ub}
   Allows you to use any of the driving aids on any level, including Ace.
 (default is off)

@{b}Q Tyres in Practice@{ub}
   Allows you to use Qualifying tyres in practice periods and races as well
as qualifying sessions.  This option also activates the "Unlimited Q Tyres"
feature.
 (default is off)

@{b}Unlimited Q Tyres@{ub}
   Turn off for 4 set limit for qualifying tyres in qualifying sessions.
 (default is off)

@{b}Use Team HP@{ub}
   Tells F1GP to use the HP value you have specified for the team you're
driving for.  Usually F1GP will use a separate HP value for your car (you
can alter this with the "Player HP" setting).
 (default is off)

@{b}Degrade HP@{ub}
   F1GP normally reduces the "Player HP" by a random amount (between 0 and
20, approximately), everytime you start a new session.  So even if the
"Player HP" is set to 716 you could be driving with only 694 or something.
Disabling this feature ensures you will always have the HP you expect.
 (default is on)

@{b}Player HP@{ub}
   The acceleration of your car.  The higher, the faster you can go.
However, the value is really your maximum HP you want, as F1GP will lower
it by a small random amount automatically - see the "Degrade HP" setting.
This parameter also affects the place you will qualify at, if you skip the
qualifying session. Values between 0 and 1431 accepted.
 (default is 716)

@{b}Finish HP@{ub}
   When you cross the line, after finishing a race your HP is automatically
changed so that you can't go very fast.  Setting this to the same value as
that of the "Player HP" will result in no HP change. This HP value applies
to every car. Values between 0 and 1431 accepted.
 (default is 95)
@endnode

@node "WinDisplay" "Display"
@toc "FileEditors"
This window allows you to adjust various settings which affect the in-game
display.

@{b}Frames/sec@{ub}
   The number of times F1GP updates the screen in one second.  Basically,
higher values make the game look and feel a lot smoother and more playable.
Here is a small table showing the maximum performance you can expect to get
out of various machines:

   Computer    CPU   MHz | fps      | Detail
   ----------------------+----------+--------
   A4000       68040  25 |  20      | minimum
   A1200       68030  50 |  16.7/20 | minimum
   A1200       68020  14 |  12.5/15 | minimum
   A500/A600   68000   7 |  8/10    | minimum

Currently, the computer cars drive slower at higher frame rates. To get the
cars to drive at about the same times as at 8 fps, you should adjust the
Speed Factor in the Team Editor accordingly. This can be done by
multiplying it by the corresponding scale:

   fps  | scale
   -----+---------
   20   | 1.0653
   16.6 | 1.0341
   15   | 1.0227
   12.5 | 1.0114
   12   | 1.0085
   10   | 1.0028
    8   | 1

Alternatively, you may wish to use the @{"frame rate correction" link "WinSFactor" 18} feature in the
Local Speed Factors window which will scale the speed factor for you
automatically.

   @{b}WARNING:@{ub} You may find you cannot control your car and it continually
spins. This usually happens with high frame rates (eg 25fps) and during a
race (especially 100% ones).  The higher the frame rate and the higher the
race distance, the more likely this will happen.  The only way to get
around it at the moment is to lower the frame rate or race distance.
   @{b}WARNING:@{ub} Do not change the frame rate in the middle of a race/driving
session. You must go back out to the main menu before you change it, since
the game calculates some values from the time constant when it enters a
race/driving session.
   @{b}WARNING:@{ub} Replays made at different frame rates just don't work very well
at all. So, if you make a replay, you MUST play it back at that exact same
fps, or all the calculations will stuff up, and results in all the cars
ending up in strange places. Also, continuing a game which was saved at a
different frame rate will result in the air resisitance being incorrect.

 (default is 8 fps)

@{b}Target Display@{ub}
   Set this to the type of display you will be running F1GP with.  Faster
updates are available in NTSC mode as the screen is updated 60 times per
second (rather than 50 in PAL mode). You can toggle your Amiga between PAL
and NTSC with a utility such as Degrader, or via the KS 3.0+ Early Startup
Control menu.
 (default is PAL (50Hz))

@{b}Detail Level@{ub}
   Preset the level of detail that F1GP should use.  This is the equivalent
of pressing ALT-D when playing the game.
 (default is Full)

@{b}Default Position@{ub}
   Usually the game determines the exact position of the in-game display by
reading the system preferences.  This is sufficient on some systems.
However, if you have Workbench set up to use a lot of overscan the game
display will probably not be centred.  More importantly there is a bug in
@{"version A" link "F1GPVersions" 0} of the game, which results in the left of the game display being
chopped off if the left edge of your Workbench screen is not located at a
specific position. By disabling this feature, you can fix the display to a
position of your choice - the aforementioned bug will also be fixed.
 (default is on)

@{b}X@{ub}
   Specify the horizontal position of the screen as an offset from the
hardware centre (this might not be the exact centre of your particular
monitor) of the Amiga's display.  Please note that this must not be set
below 0 on AGA Amigas if you want to use the @{"GPPatch HUD" link "WinGPPatch" 0}.
 (default is 0)

@{b}Y@{ub}
   Specify the vertical position of the screen as an offset from the
hardware centre (this might not be the exact centre of your particular
monitor) of the Amiga's display.
 (default is 0)
@endnode

@node "WinPalette" "In-Game Colours"
@toc "FileEditors"
This window allows you to alter the colour palette used when actually
playing the game.  In reality, it isn't really a good idea to alter the
palette as it will affect the whole display (e.g cockpit, cars, the track).
However, making minor adjustments shouldn't cause too many problems.

Adjusting the palette is a simple matter of selecting a colour and then
moving the RGB sliders.  As this is the usual way applications handle
palette editing, I don't think this needs much more explanation :-)

Unfortunately, the game uses a 9-bit palette (opposed to the normal 12 or
24-bit) which means you have less colours to choose from (512 to be
precise).  This is the reason why you can only choose between 0 and 7 on
each slider.

@{b}Import@{ub}
   Load colours from an existing IFF-ILBM image or palette file.

@{b}Export@{ub}
   Save the current colours to an IFF palette file.  You can then use the
resulting palette file with your favourite paint program, if required.

@{b}Wet Sky Colour@{ub}
   Select the palette entry that should be used for the sky during wet
weather conditions.
@endnode

@node "WinWet" "Wet Weather Settings"
@toc "FileEditors"
This window contains settings which affect the wet weather:

@{b}Wet Race Probability@{ub}
   Change the chance of a wet race (100% means all races will be wet).
 (default is 3%)

@{b}Wet at Phoenix@{ub}
   Allows you to have a wet race in the USA (Phoenix).  Usually it is
impossible to do so.
 (default is off)

@{b}All Sessions Wet@{ub}
   Makes wet practice and qualifying sessions possible.  The wet race
probability option affects these sessions too.
 (default is off)

@{b}Decide During Season@{ub}
   This affects championship season games only.  Usually, F1GP calculates
which of the 16 races are to be wet before you begin your first race. This
information is stored in the save game file for later use.  This means that
altering the wet race probability during a season has no effect.  Enabling
this feature will change F1GP so that it ignores the previously calculated
wet race decisions, and instead the decision on a wet race is calculated on
the fly, just before you start each race.
 (default is off)
@endnode

@node "WinShape" "Car Shape Editor"
@toc "FileEditors"
This window contains some options which all the actual shape of the car to
be changed:

@{b}Car Design@{ub}
   Choose which kind of shape the car should have.  It should be noted that
the car is actually rendered in the game using two different 3D models. One
is used when the car is close to a camera, and the other is used at all
other times.  Unfortunately, this option only affects the "close up" 3D
model.  Also, the colour editors will always show a picture of the original
car.  You can select either the original car design or a new design which
mimics the style of a 1998 F1 car.
 (default is Original)

@{b}Alternative Nose@{ub}
   Select which cars (teams) should use the '91 McLaren-Marlboro nose
design.  Originally, the first team was assigned this design.  This option
allows you to choose whether all teams, no teams, or a single team should
use the design.  This option is intentionally disabled when using the 1998
car design!
 (default is a single team - #1)

@{b}Select Team@{ub}
   This slider is used when you have chosen for only a single team to be
given the alternative nose design.  It allows you to select which team
should use the alternative design.
@endnode

@node "MemPatches" "Memory Patches"
@toc "WinMain"
@next "OtherWins"
@prev "FileEditors"
The features provided by these windows are different because they add new
features to F1GP, which require more code and space than the original
routines in F1GP.  Thus, the patches alter F1GP while the game is resident
in memory so that the extra code (which is located in F1GP-Ed) can be used.
For this reason, you may not quit F1GP-Ed while any patches are active.

Each window has at least an Install and Remove button which are used to add
and remove settings in each window to F1GP.  It is impossible to install
these patches directly to the F1GP binary file for the reasons above.
However, the settings in each window can be saved to an F1GP-Ed datafile.

For the settings to take effect in F1GP itself, you must be @{"running F1GP at" link "Simultaneous" 0}
@{"the same time as F1GP-Ed" link "Simultaneous" 0}, and then click on the "Install" button(s).

Note that when redefining keys in any of the windows below, you are not
required to install the patch again.  The new keys take immediate effect.

The Memory Patches are configured in the following windows:

 @{" Car Control " link "WinPatchF1GP" 0}
 @{" Information " link "WinGPPatch" 0}
 @{" Speed Factors " link "WinSFactor" 0}
 @{" Risk Factors " link "WinRisk" 0}
 @{" Miscellaneous " link "WinMisc" 0}
@endnode

@node "WinPatchF1GP" "PatchF1GP - Car Control"
@toc "MemPatches"
The settings in this window sprout from Grant Reeve's PatchF1GP (and
HackF1GP) utility. It can actually buffer the button presses, so you don't
miss gear changes any more and a number of other useful additions which
transform F1GP into what it @{b}should@{ub} be like. This window contains the more
complex features (code-wise) - the others can be found in the @{"File Editor" link "FileEditors" 0}
windows.

PatchF1GP does have its limitations (or perhaps that should be bugs), so
before using PatchF1GP features make sure you have read the @{"warnings" link "pf1gpWarnings" 0}.

You can configure PatchF1GP with the following options:

@{b}Interrupt Enabled@{ub}
   Turn the interrupt driven routines on or off.  These routines enable
buffering and 2 button gear changes.  To check that it's working,
accelerate up to 6th gear, turn on autofire, and press the button for 1/4
of a second while braking. If you don't have autofire, just press the
button really fast about 8 times. You'll well and truly end up in reverse.
PatchF1GP can buffer up to 12 button presses and releases (24 events). F1GP
will read off these events at a rate of 1 per frame.  So if you manage to
fill up the buffer, (ie: autofire) then it will take about 3-4 seconds to
empty the buffer. So expect your gears to go mental until then. These
routines are of no use to players who use the automatic gears driving aid,
so this should be disabled in this case.
 (default is off)

@{b}Debounce@{ub}
   With the buffering on, it is possible that you may get unwanted gear
changes (i.e. two gear changes with one button press).  This option allows
you to remove these changes.  Higher values will result in the gear buttons
being read less often.
 (default is 3)

@{b}Digital Joystick Gears@{ub}
   Allows you to use 2 different buttons to change up and down gears. With
this method you can change down a gear while accelerating and vice versa.
This is only possible if your joystick has independent buttons (e.g. CD32
joypad).
 (default is Buttons Equal)

@{b}2 Key Gearchange@{ub}
   With this enabled, you can use space to change up a gear, and left-amiga
to change down a gear.  Select "Redefine Keys" to alter the keys, via a
standard @{"Key Redefinition" link "WinKey" 0} window.
 (default is off)

@{b}Traction Control@{ub}
   Turn traction control on or off.  Normally traction control is always on
when playing with a normal digital joystick and always off when playing
with an analog joystick.  If you select an option which is "Changable", you
will be able to toggle it on or off from a new item in the Game Options
menu in F1GP itself, and/or by pressing the "T" key while driving.  If you
play F1GP with an analog joystick you MUST set this to "Fixed".
 (default is Normal - Fixed)

@{b}Pit Speed Limiter@{ub}
   If enabled, your car is forced to stay below/on the limit you specify.
This does not effect computer cars.
 (default is off)

@{b}Speed Limit@{ub}
   Maximum speed limit for the pit lane.  Values are either in Km / Miles,
depending on what you've set the "Units" option to in the
@{"Standard Options window" link "WinOptions" 0}.
 (default is 75 mph / 120 km/h)

@{b}Position Snapshot Keys@{ub}
   Allows you to step up your productivity.  You can use it to practice
corners as often as you like, and to save doing warm-up laps all the time.
How it works, is that at some point on the track that you like, just before
some corner you want to practice, you "snapshot" the car. All the data
about the car at that instant will be stored. Now, you go into the corner,
and crash/burn/die/etc.  Now, you simply "restore" the car - now it is back
as it was when you snapshotted it - all set to crash/burn/die again!  Note
that if the sound goes off (ie after crashing / in the pits), you will need
to switch it back on with the +/- keys, if you restore your position. There
are 4 keys - the defaults are:
  [ - snapshot into save position 1
  ] - snapshot into save position 2
  ; - restore from save position 1
  # - restore from save position 2

Select "Redefine Keys" to alter the keys, via a standard @{"Key Redefinition" link "WinKey" 0}
window.
 (default is off)
@endnode

@node "pf1gpWarnings" "PatchF1GP Warnings & Limitations"
@toc "WinPatchF1GP"
PatchF1GP will still buffer button events while the game is paused! This
can cause havoc when unpaused!  It also does not clear the buffer at all,
ie: pressing autofire to fill up the buffer, then pressing escape, is not
really advised.

At the moment the replay routine doesn't keep track of the state of
traction control. So a replay of you alternating between states will cause
the car to end up somewhere other than it should be.
@endnode

@node "WinGPPatch" "GPPatch - Information"
@toc "MemPatches"
This window allows you to install and remove some pretty neat patches which
have evolved from Toni Wilen's GPPatch utility.  These are the standard
features which are always enabled:

 * Shows remaining time and your current lap in practice and qualifying
 * Shows the time difference to the cars on front and behind when you've
   crossed the finish line
 * Shows the racers' names who are in front and behind of you
 * Realtime laptime updating
 * A block flashes on the upper left corner when the first competitor
   crosses the finish line
 * Several listings: drivers by their positions, fastest lap times, race
   time - "*" shows your car's position and cars marks with "#" are the
   other human players

Additional features can be configured with F1GP-Ed:

@{b}HUD On@{ub}
   Toggles the realtime drivers' list on or off.  This is similar to a HUD
view on flight simulators (Heads Up Display).  The drivers' name will often
be preceded by one of the following symbols:

   >   car is currently in the pit lane
   -   car intends to pit for tyres this lap
   +   car is damaged and intends to make a pitstop this lap

The HUD can also be toggled while playing the game by pressing the relevant
key (5 on the numeric keypad, by default).  @{b}Limitations:@{ub} Please note that
on AGA Amigas, the HUD doesn't fully show up if you have set the @{"horizontal" link "WinDisplay" 0}
@{"display position" link "WinDisplay" 0} to less than 0.  On screenmodes other than standard PAL or
NTSC (e.g. DblPAL or Multiscan), the HUD is not available, due to hardware
limitations.
 (default is off)

@{b}HUD Size@{ub}
   This specifies the horizontal size of the HUD, and is made possible by
the AGA chipset - so if you don't have an A1200 or A4000 you won't be able
to use this feature.  This option can also be changed while playing the
game by pressing the relevant key (0 on the numeric keypad, by default).
 (default is Large)

@{b}X Offset@{ub}
   The horizontal position of the HUD - relative to the current screen
@{"display position" link "WinDisplay" 0}.
 (default is 4)

@{b}Y Offset@{ub}
   The vertical position of the HUD - relative to the current screen
@{"display position" link "WinDisplay" 0}.
 (default is 10)

@{b}Allow Setup Change@{ub}
   Alters the behaviour of the Right-Shift key (or whatever you have
redefined it to).  Pressing this key will bring up the car setup menu while
you are actually driving and allow you to alter the setup without returning
to the pits.  You can enable this feature, disable it completely, or just
disable it during races.
 (default is Never)

@{b}Enable Turbo Keys@{ub}
   Allow the 1-6 keys to be used to alter the game speed.  It is advisable
to turn these keys off if you find yourself pressing these keys
accidentally while playing the game :-)
 (default is on)

@{b}Turbo Keys Preset@{ub}
   This allows you to preset the initial turbo keys setting.  Select the
key 1-6.  This option essentially does the same as pressing the required
turbo key when entering the cockpit.  This saves you having to do this
manually every time, for those of you who can't live without the turbo keys
;-)  In general, it is recommended that you set this option to 0, which
disables the preset value and ensures the frame rate is set correctly.
 (default is 0)

@{b}Font@{ub}
   Specifies the font to be used by the HUD and information displays.
Clicking the button will bring up a font requester.  The only fonts that
can be used by GPPatch are fixed width 8x8 fonts - only suitable fonts will
be displayed in the requester.
 (default is topaz.font)

@{b}Redefine Keys@{ub}
   @{"Redefined" link "WinKey" 0} the keys used by GPPatch.  These keys provide additional

 R-Amiga  Shows positions and times of all cars (qualifying and race only)

 R-Alt    Exit the position display activated with R-Amiga

 R-Shift  Enter car setup menu

  1-6     Alter the game speed.  1 = slowest and 6 = fastest.  The exact
          funtion of these keys depends on what you have set the actual

@node "WinSFactor" "Local Speed Factors"
@toc "MemPatches"
One of the major drawbacks of F1GP is that the computer cars travel at
different speeds, in relation to your speed, on each circuit.  An example
would be that the computer cars are much faster at Hungary than at Monaco.
A solution is to provide a separate @{"Speed Factor" link "WinTeam" 0} for each circuit.  F1GP
doesn't account for this normally, so I've added some extra code to make it
happen :)  This makes it possible for you to set the speeds of the computer
cars to relatively match your personal speed for each circuit.

If you alter the Local Speed Factors once you've installed this patch, the
new values take immediate effect (ie you don't have to reinstall the patch
each time you make a change).  Note that the global Speed Factor in the
@{"Team editor window" link "WinTeam" 0} is ignored by F1GP when you have this patch installed!

@{b}Local Speed Factor@{ub}
   Speed Factor to be applied to the currently selected circuit.  Values
between 15000 and 32767 are allowed.
 (default is 16384)

@{b}Frame Rate Correction@{ub}
   If you have already read the section about the @{"frame rate feature" link "WinGame" 0},
you'll know that increasing the frame rate makes computer cars drive
progressively slower.  Switching this feature on will automatically
increase the speed factor for you depending on the current frame rate
setting.  Please note that this feature hasn't been perfected yet, so the
performance level at higher frame rates on different circuits may vary.
 (default is off)

@{b}Auto-Reduce in the wet@{ub}
   As you may have noticed, the computer cars are quicker than usual in wet
weather.  Enabling this will automatically reduce the speed factor when
racing in wet weather conditions so that you will be just as competitive in
wet races as in dry ones.
 (default is on)

@{b}Actual@{ub}
   Displays the actual speed factor that will be used after applying the
frame rate correction - if correction is disabled this value will be the
same as the entered value.

@{b}In Wet Weather@{ub}
   Displays the speed factor that will be used in wet weather conditions.
This will be lower than the given speed factor if you have switched on the
automatic reduction for wet conditions.

@{b}Reset@{ub}
   Set the Local Speed Factor for the currently selected circuit to same
value as the global Speed Factor in the Team editor window.

@{b}Decrease All@{ub}
   Decrease the Local Speed Factor for all circuits by 50.

@{b}Increase All@{ub}
   Increase the Local Speed Factor for all circuits by 50.

Note that the global risk factor in the team editor window is ignored when
this patch is installed.  If you alter the Local Risk Factors once you've
installed this patch, the new values take immediate effect (ie you don't
have to reinstall the patch each time you make a change).

@{b}Local Risk Factor@{ub}
   Risk Factor to be applied to the currently selected circuit.  Values
between 0 and 32767 are allowed.  This value is used in all sessions except
races.

@{b}Local Race Risk Factor@{ub}
   Risk Factor to be applied to the currently selected circuit.  Values
between 0 and 32767 are allowed.  This value is only used in races.

@{b}Reset@{ub}
   Set the Local Risk Factors for the currently selected circuit to the

@node "WinMisc" "Miscellaneous Patches"
@toc "MemPatches"
Not much in this window at the moment.  This patch will only be active if
you enable the feature below:

@{b}Correct Clock@{ub}
   If your Amiga has a battery-backed clock you will probably have noticed
that the system clock stops when you are playing F1GP (i.e. when you leave
the cockpit the time is wrong).  Switching this feature on will do the
equivalent of typing "SetClock LOAD" in a shell window everytime you leave
the cockpit.  This ensures the system clock is always as it should be.
 (default is off)

@{b}Audio Filter@{ub}
   Turns the Amiga's built-in audio filter on or off when playing the game.
Setting this to "Normal" will leave the audio filter alone.
 (default is Normal)

@{b}MULTIPLAYER PATCHES@{ub}

@{b}Fix Speed Problems@{ub}
   This is intended only for multiplayer games and has no use whatsoever in
single player games.  It will make player cars under computer control
travel at a similar speed to computer drivers, thus making them
competitive.  Previously, with a higher than default speed factor, player
cars under computer control would drive very slowly compared to the
computer drivers.  Without this patch, player cars under computer control
will get a hardcoded HP value depending on the skill level (716 for Ace).
The fix will make the player cars under computer control use the HP value
of the respective team.  This feature used to be called "Multiplayer Fix"
before version 3.34.
 (default is off)

@{b}Safe Indestructibility@{ub}
   Makes computer controlled player cars indestructible.  In other words,
during a multiplayer game, when your car is being controlled by the
computer it cannot get damaged.  Of course, this patch will do nothing if
you have the indestructible option in the game switched on.
 (default is off)

@node "OtherWins" "Other Windows"
@next "Acknowledgements"
@prev "MemPatches"
These windows don't contain any settings as such.  Instead they can process
data, or load external sound/graphics files which can then be installed to
F1GP either in memory or directly to the binary.  Basically, any window
which can't be catergorized as either a File Editor or a Memory Patch, will
end up here.

None of the selections in these windows are stored in the normal F1GP-Ed
data file.  However, any selections in these windows are saved when you
@{"save the settings" link "Menu_SaveSettings" 0} and in some cases in individual settings files.

@node "WinSample" "Sound Samples "
@toc "OtherWins"
This window allows you to replace any of the sound samples used by F1GP.
The game uses eight sounds and you can alter each one by clicking the radio
buttons to the right of the window.  All the settings in this window are
saved in a separate sound settings file. The current settings filename will
be saved in the standard settings file by selecting @{"Save Settings" link "Menu_SaveSettings" 0} from the
@{"Settings" link "Menus" 0} menu.  If you do this, your preferred sound settings will be
loaded automatically when you start F1GP-Ed.

For best results the samples should be in RAW format, and be of a smaller
or same size as the maximum sizes:

   +-------------------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   | Sound Description | Max Size | Volume    | Length    | Start at  |

The Engine sample is continuously looped so it is vital that the loop point
is disguised well for a good result.  You can edit sound samples in
programs such as TechnoSound Turbo and Protracker, for example.

@{b}Sound@{ub}
   Locaction of sound sample on disk (ideally the sample should be in RAW
format)

@{b}Volume@{ub}
   How loud the sound is to be played by the game.  0 is the quietest (i.e.
you won't be able to hear it) and 64 is the loudest.

@{b}Length@{ub}
   How much of the sound should be played by the game.  This can be used to
truncate the sound without having to edit the sound sample.

@{b}Start at@{ub}
   How much of the beginning of the sound should be ignored.  0 is the
beginning.  This can be used to skip unwanted sound at the start of a file
(e.g. to skip an IFF header).

@{b}Load Settings@{ub}
   Load the sound filenames, volumes, lengths and "start at" values from a
sound settings file.

@{b}Save Settings As@{ub}
   Save the sound filenames, volumes, lengths and "start at" values to a
sound settings file.

@{b}Save Mode@{ub}
   Current - just save the currently selected sound to the game
       All - save all samples to the game
             (samples with blank filenames will be ignored)

@{b}Save RAW Sample To@{ub}
   Saving to memory will save the samples and settings into the currently
running F1GP (if present), whereas saving to @{"F1GP binary" link "WinMain" 0} will save to the
game file on-disk so it will be used everytime you play F1GP providing a
more permanent change.  If the sample is longer than the recommended size
then F1GP-Ed will truncate it.

@node "WinGfx" "Graphics "
@toc "OtherWins"
All the settings in this window are saved in a separate graphics settings
file.  This is because the settings in this window are heavily related to
what image you will use.  The current settings filename will be saved in
the standard settings file by selected @{"Save Settings" link "Menu_SaveSettings" 0} from the @{"Settings" link "Menus" 0}
menu.  If you do this, your preferred graphics settings will be loaded
automatically when you start F1GP-Ed.

In the distribution is a file called "Graphics/Cockpit.ilbm".  This is an
IFF ILBM image of the original cockpit graphics which may be loaded and
changed in virtually any decent graphics program such as Deluxe Paint or
Personal Paint. The lower section (last 97 rows to be precise) comprises of
the actual cockpit image displayed in the game.  The upper section contains
a number of things that are used to modify the display during the game.
What actually happens is that the game copies parts from the upper section
onto the lower section.  You should not move anything in the upper
section!

You may also change the positions of various dashboard indicators, but be
aware that backgrounds and things must match in the upper/lower sections or
things won't look right.

Unfortunately, there are a few limitations:

 * The image must be 320 x 184 x 4 (ie 320 x 184, and 16 colours)
 * Some parts of the cockpit that F1GP changes during the game (eg rev
   meter, lap time display) have to be identical to the original and
   shouldn't be moved
 * The main outline of the cockpit must be symmetrical about the
   vertical axis

If F1GP-Ed was unable to load "iffparse.library" you will need to @{"convert" link "GfxMaster" 0}
the IFF ILBM image into an Amiga raw image before using it in F1GP-Ed.
Otherwise you can use the IFF ILBM file directly with F1GP-Ed.  IFF images
can be bigger than the 320 x 184 x 4 limit, and F1GP-Ed will crop it to the
required size.

Example cockpit designs are supplied in the "Graphics" drawer.  For the
cockpit designs to look correct you must load in the corresponding graphics
settings.

Gadget descriptions:

@{b}Image@{ub}
   This is the filename of the IFF ILBM or RAW image you wish to use with

@{b}X@{ub}
   The x coordinate, relative to the left of the image, that the selected
part should be displayed at.  Except for the 6 indicator lights, this must
be a multiple of 16.  (range 0-319 inclusive)

@{b}Y@{ub}
   The y coordinate, relative to the top of the image, that the selected
part should be displayed at.  (range 87-183 inclusive)

@{b}Load Settings@{ub}
   Load the coordinates of all the parts, and the image filename from a

@{b}Save Settings As@{ub}
   Save the coordinates of all the parts, and the image filename to a

@{b}Save Image & Positions to@{ub}
   Saving to memory will save the selected design into the currently

@node "WinCalc" "Calulator Window"
@toc "OtherWins"
This window may seem a bit complicated, but basically all it provides is a
quick way to calculate the teams' HP and drivers' performance figures in
the most realistic way possible.  You may create as many events as you want
(ie grand prix) and enter the lap times from which the calculations are
based.  The calculator will set the teams' HP and drivers' performance in
the @{"team" link "WinTeam" 0} and @{"driver" link "WinDriver" 0} editors respectively.

Briefly, the teams' HP is based only on the qualifying times as this is the
best indication of relative performances between teams.  The drivers'
qualifying performance is based on the qualifying time as you would expect.
The drivers' race performance is based on the fastest race lap, or
optionally on the qualifying time.

@{b}New@{ub}
   Create new event.  You will then need to enter the name of the event.

@{b}Delete@{ub}
   Delete the current event.  All lap times and other data from that event
will be lost.

@{b}Up@{ub}
   Move the event up the list.  This doesn't affect the calculations - just
the visual representation.

@{b}Down@{ub}
   Move the event down the list.  This doesn't affect the calculations -
just the visual representation.

@{b}Event@{ub}
   The name of the event.

@{b}Include in calculation@{ub}
   Determine whether the current event should be used in the calculation.
You may just want the calculation to be based on only a few of the events.
In some cases you might not want a certain event - for example, if lots of
the top drivers drop out or the race result is unusual.
 (default is on)

@{b}Ignore race@{ub}
   Determine whether race lap times from the current event should be
included in the calculation, or whether the calculation on the current
event should be based entirely on qualifying times.
 (default is off)

@{b}Driver@{ub}
   Name of the current driver, which the lap times correspond to.  One way
to select the driver is to click on the arrow buttons to the right of the
name.

@{b}Qualifying Time@{ub}
   Qualifying lap time of the current driver.  If you set this to 0:00.000
the time will be ignored in the calculation.  You might need to do this if
a driver fails to complete a qualifying lap or if a driver qualifies in an
unusually low position (e.g. if starting from the back of the grid after
being disqualified).

@{b}Fastest Race Lap@{ub}
   Fastest race lap time of the current driver.  If you set this to
0:00.000 the time will be ignored in the calculation.  You might need to do
this if a driver fails to complete a race lap, fails to qualify or if a
driver drops out early on in the race.

@{b}Best Driver@{ub}
   The best performance figure - corresponds to the qualifying and race
performances in the @{"Driver editor" link "WinDriver" 0}.  No driver will get a performance figure
better than this.

@{b}Worst Driver@{ub}
   The worst performance figure - corresponds to the qualifying and race
performances in the @{"Driver editor" link "WinDriver" 0}.  The fastest driver in a team will not
get a performance figure worse than this, but other driver might if he is
much slower than his teammate.

@{b}Mate Factor@{ub}
   Determines how close performance figures can be between teammates. The
lower the value, the closer the performance difference between teammates
will be.  It doesn't affect the relative performance between drivers in
different teams - just the relative performance of the slowest driver in a
team compared to his teammate.  Values between 1 and 8 are allowed.
 (default is 3)

@{b}Fastest Team HP@{ub}
   The maximum HP to be used in the calculation.  The best team will
usually get this value, but it can sometimes be slightly less (depends on
how many pole positions they lose).

@{b}Slowest Team HP@{ub}
   The minimum HP to be used in the calculation.  The slowest team will
always get this value.

@{b}Calculate Current@{ub}
   Perform the calculation and base it only on the currently selected event
(ignores the "Include in calculation" option).  This will set the teams' HP
and drivers' performance in the @{"team" link "WinTeam" 0} and @{"driver" link "WinDriver" 0} editors respectively.

@{b}Calculate All@{ub}
   Perform the calculation, basing it on all events that are to be
included.  This will set the teams' HP and drivers' performance in the @{"team" link "WinTeam" 0}
and @{"driver" link "WinDriver" 0} editors respectively.

@{b}Load@{ub}
   Load an events file.  F1GP-Ed will automatically attempt to load an an
events file whenever you @{"load a standard datafile" link "Menu_Load" 0}.

@{b}Save@{ub}
   Save all figures and events to a separate file.
@endnode

@node "WinBKG" "Backdrops Window"
@toc "OtherWins"
Most of the background images which are seen in the game's front end are
stored in separate files (filename suffix .bkg).  These backdrop files use
a custom format and the images must be 320x200 in size and use no more than
32 colours.

This window allows you to convert normal IFF-ILBM image files into F1GP's
custom format.  These images can then be used by the game as a replacement
for the original images.

Before replacing any backdrop file you should read about the @{"limitations" link "BkgLimits" 0}.
Unfortunately, in most cases it is not a simple matter of loading any old
32 colour picture.  There are restrictions on what palette entries you can
use - some of them have to remain constant.

@{b}IMPORTANT:@{ub} F1GP-Ed needs to know which version of F1GP you have before
viewing or replacing backdrop files.  If you own @{"version C" link "F1GPVersions" 0} then you will
need to reselect the @{"F1GP Binary" link "WinMain" 0} - F1GP-Ed will then know which version you
have and if you @{"save the settings" link "Menu_SaveSettings" 0} it will also know when you next load
F1GP-Ed.

@{b}IMPORTANT:@{ub} If you intend to make changes to a copy of F1GP located on a
hard disk drive, you will need to make sure the standard f1gp_disk_#x:
assigns have been set up beforehand.  It is recommended that you add these
to your s:user-startup file, if you haven't already done so.  For example:

   assign f1gp_disk_#1: Work:Games/F1GP
   assign f1gp_disk_#2: Work:Games/F1GP
   assign f1gp_disk_#3: Work:Games/F1GP
   assign f1gp_disk_#4: Work:Games/F1GP

If you want to convert the original backdrop files to IFF-ILBM format, then
you can either view the picture from within F1GP-Ed and use a program that
can grab screens (e.g. Personal Paint, Quickgrab) or install the F1GP
Backdrop datatype (available from Aminet: util/dtype/f1gp_bkg_dt.lha).

Here's the description of all the user interface elements:

@{b}Load IFF/BKG Image@{ub}
   Load a standard IFF-ILBM image into the buffer.  If the image is too
big, it will be cropped automatically.  You can also use this feature to
load in existing F1GP backdrop files.  The image will remain in the buffer
until you flush it manually or exit F1GP-Ed.

@{b}View@{ub}
   View the current contents of the image buffer.

@{b}Flush@{ub}
   Reset the image buffer, and free the memory associated with it.  You
will rarely need to use this feature unless you are running low on memory.

@{b}Buffer@{ub}
   The name of current file which has been loaded into the image buffer.

@{b}Destination@{ub}
   Lists the filenames of all the backdrop files (without the .bkg suffix).
Use this to select the backdrop file you want to replace or view.

@{b}Information@{ub}
   Displays information about the selected destination backdrop file. Each
file has it's own @{"limitations" link "BkgLimits" 0}.

   @{b}Intro@{ub}
      Used only by the intro.  In general you shouldn't alter these,
      mainly because they are animations.  Version C of the game doesn't
      have an intro, so if you have this version then you obviously can't
      replace or view these files.

   @{b}Menu@{ub}
      These images have a menu rendered on top of them.  As a result
      specific palette values should be kept constant so the menus look
      correct.

   @{b}Palette Change@{ub}
      The images fade-in and then dim down to about half brightness -
      usually menus and text are rendered on top of the image.  When
      replacing these images, F1GP-Ed needs to alter the F1GP binary.

   @{b}Animation@{ub}
      These images are the first frame of an animation.  Currently only
      this frame can be altered, so it's probably best to leave these
      files alone.

   @{b}Unrestricted@{ub}
      These are the simplest kind of backdrop file. The image is shown on
      it's own and nothing is rendered on top of it.  Hence these pictures
      can utilize the full 32 colour palette.

@{b}View Current@{ub}
   View the existing selected backdrop file (the file is loaded first, and
then displayed).

@{b}Replace@{ub}
   Replace the currently selected backdrop file with the contents of the
image buffer.  @{b}IMPORTANT:@{ub} Please make a backup of all the .bkg files
supplied with the game before using this option, as this option will
overwrite the existing .bkg file!

@{b}Save Other@{ub}
   Allows you to save the contents of the image buffer to a .bkg file of
your choice.  This is useful if you want to make .bkg files before actually
using them in the game.
@endnode

@node "BkgLimits" "Backdrop Limitations"
One limitation you should be aware of is that some of the .bkg files must
not exceed a specific file size.  This only applies when F1GP loads in more
than one .bkg file at a time (by storing them in a fixed size buffer).  If
the combined size of those files is too large, F1GP will issue a "Not
Enough Memory" error message and the backdrops for that section will either
be blank or kind of corrupted.  This isn't serious - it just means you
can't see your chosen backdrops.  There are 2 instances I can think of:

1. After a non-championship race, F1GP will load both honda1 and result
   into a buffer.  The combined size of both these .bkg files must be less
   than approximately 60000 bytes.

2. After a championship race, F1GP will load result, d_champ, c_champ and
   pitcrew2.  The combined size of these .bkg files should not exceed
   approximately 130000 bytes.

In the following text I shall refer to specific entries in the colour
palette using the range 0-31 inclusive.

@{b}GENERAL NOTES@{ub}

The mouse pointer will always use palette colours 16-19.

@{b}STATIC SCREENS@{ub} (unrestricted)

It is feasible to use all 32 colours in these pictures, as the picture is
only every shown on it's own (i.e. no menus).

   crash1          Out of race - no wing damage
   crash2          Out of race - one wing damaged
   crash3          Out of race - both wings damaged
   podium          3rd place?
   runnerup        2nd place?
   setup3          Car setup - return to car

@{b}MENU SCREENS@{ub}

Colours 14-23 & 31 are used by F1GP to render the menus on top of these
pictures.

   options         Main menu
   pitcrew2        Championship results menu
   setup1          Car setup - load/save menu
   setup2          Car setup screens

F1GP also uses colour 24 (this is the blue colour used as the background
colour for "popup" requesters) from the following:

   monaco          Track select
   honda1          Prac/Qual/Race select
   track1-16       Circuit maps
   pitcrew1        Return to cockpit / save

F1GP uses the entire palette (I think), to render the drivers' helmet
designs.  Therefore, you should probably keep to the original palette:

   helmet          Driver select screen

@{b}FADE-IN + DIM SCREENS@{ub} (palette change)

Colours 14-24 & 31 are used by F1GP to render a menu bar at the bottom of
the screen.  Text is overlayed directly onto the image.  The limitation is
that once the picture has faded in, it dims to about half brightness - this
dim palette is hardcoded in the F1GP executable file (F1GP-Ed will change
it automatically).

   away            Starting grid screen
   c_champ         Constructors' champ result/table
   d_champ         Drivers' champ result/table
   result          Race result / fastest laps
   uno             Game complete (won season)

   credits         Intro

@{b}ANIMATIONS@{ub}

You shouldn't change the part of the image that moves in the animation - in
most of the images you'll see a missing chunk (black box) which is what
gets altering in the animation.  It should be ok to alter other parts
though.  You should be careful when altering the palette too.  The other
anim frames are loaded from the corresponding .MSP file.

   champers        1st place
   trophy          Won championship

   desk            Intro
   bighelmet       Intro
   getin           Intro

Obviously the logoanim.bkg file is an animation, and as you may notice from
it's size it is not in the same format as all the other .bkg files! Again,
this is used by the intro.  F1GP-Ed cannot alter this file.

@node "WinKey" "Key Redefinition Windows"
When you click on the "Redefine Keys" button in that appears in various
windows, a small simple window will open.  In the window will be the
description - you just have to press the key you want to activate that
feature.

The only thing you have to worry about is clashes.  F1GP-Ed does not check
your chosen keys, therefore you can assign more than one function to a
single key, which is generally not advisable.

Current key settings will be reset to their defaults when selecting the
@{"Default Settings" link "Menu_Default" 0} item from the Window menu.

@node "Updates" "How to get F1GP-Ed updates"
The latest versions of F1GP-Ed should be available from:

 @{b}*@{ub} F1GP-Ed web page - http://www.amigaf1.co.uk/F1GP-Ed/
 @{b}*@{ub} Aminet ftp sites (game/misc/F1GP-Ed.lha)

PD libraries stock F1GP-Ed as well, but not necessarily the very latest
version (you should not have to pay more than £2 including p&p).
@endnode

@node "Author" "The Author"
You can contact me via e-mail at this address:

   oliver@futaura.co.uk

I also maintain several World Wide Web (WWW) pages on the Internet.  Of
course, there is a page dedicated to F1GP-Ed where news, latest versions,
screenshots, etc, can be found.  The Amiga Formula One Homepage provides
just about everything available to Amiga F1GP players including WWW pages
F1GP Hall of Fame and the Internet F1GP Championship.  There's information
on all of the Amiga F1GP utilities (available for downloading too) as well
as lots of other goodies and other Amiga / Formula One related links. So,
for an Amiga F1GP junkie's dream, set your web browser to:

@node "Future" "Future"
Just because GP 2 is now out for the PC doesn't mean I'm going to stop
developing F1GP-Ed :-)  I will continue development while interest still
remains.

I really don't know what else is going into future versions of F1GP-Ed in
the way of new features.  Usually, I discover things first and then
implement the features in F1GP-Ed.  But, rest assured, if I (or other
@{"contributors" link "Acknowledgements" 0}) find some things that are worth changing, I will add features
in F1GP-Ed to change them :-)

If there are any new features you'd like to see, then please do let @{"me" link "Author" 0}
know.  Although I won't promise to add them, I'll gladly add them to my
list.  If enough people ask for a specific feature, then I'll try even
harder to make it possible.  However, some things are impossible :-(
@endnode

@node "f1gplib" "f1gp.library - what is it?"
f1gp.library is a small library which provides a small number of functions
for programmers which allow detection of F1GP and notification of a number
of different events (e.g. when F1GP exits).  There is also a function which
can calulate the correct file checksum.

The library also performs various patches on F1GP automatically, including
making the game use the VBR, making the game use the faster graphics fetch
modes of the AGA chipset and the ability for the game to run using 31kHz
screenmodes (primarily to support VGA monitors which cannot display PAL or
NTSC screens).

It was developed by me to aid F1GP hackers/developers and helps provide
compatibility between programs.  In one of the previous registered versions
of F1GP-Ed (a long time ago) I implemented a routine to detect if F1GP was
running in memory.  This was required by the new "save to memory" feature.
Then Grant and Rene @{i}popped up@{ui} and I let them use the same code in their
programs.  Eventually, I decided to put this routine in a shared library
which made things a lot easier and saved on memory (a little bit). That's
how it started and not a lot has changed since, except a couple of new
things.  It is very easy for a program to register itself with the library
so when F1GP quits the program can act accordingly - it is common for F1GP
patch programs to need to know when F1GP quits (at the instant it happens)
to provide stability.

So, really, the library is only of use to people developing patches for use
with F1GP.  I have made a developer archive available for the library which
contains further information, C & Assembler include files, examples and
full documentation.  If you are interested in developing patches for F1GP
(or have already done so) feel free to let @{"me" link "Author" 0} know and I'll send you the
latest developer archive, if you need it :-) The developer files are also
available from Aminet: dev/misc/f1gplib.lha
