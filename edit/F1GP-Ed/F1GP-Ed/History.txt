                        F1GP-Ed PROGRAM HISTORY
                        +++++++++++++++++++++++

V3.44 - 3 November 2010   (168904 bytes)

o Re-released as donationware along with free F1GP-Ed.key file
============================================================================
V3.44 - 17 April 1999   (168904 bytes)

o When viewing backdrops or cockpits, the image is now displayed in a
  window on the same screen, where possible (using picture.datatype)
o Improved "best mode" calculations when opening screens, which will
  try to choose a mode with the same monitor type as the screen that
  F1GP-Ed is using (e.g. will stop F1GP-Ed choosing PAL screens when
  running on a graphics card!)
o Added workaround for the palette window when running on a hi/true colour
  screen - when adjusting the colours, the on-screen colours now update
  in realtime (as they normally do on <= 8-bit screens)

Bug Fixes:

o Fixed a long standing bug which screwed the car setups up causing the
  game to crash during a championship season when reaching the Suzuka
  race and racing with less than 26 cars
o Made a workaround for the sliders in the palette window, as the numbers
  didn't always show up with certain fonts
o Under certain circumstances (e.g. running under CyberGraphX) F1GP-Ed
  could crash on exit, if not registered
============================================================================
V3.43 - 29 November 1998   (166476 bytes)

o Added the first stage of the new car shape editor: you can select
  which car/cars should have the '91 McLaren style nose colour scheme,
  and, more importantly, it is now possible to make the cars look
  more like the '98 cars (e.g. high nose, raised cockpit surround, etc)
o The palette entry used for the sky in wet conditions can now be
  selected
o Added an option to disable joystick control of the F1GP menus
o Fixed a bug in the game itself - when loading a saved game, the sky
  colour is now always correctly set.  Before, if you loaded a wet race
  the sky colour would remain blue, instead of grey.
o Made it possible to disable the GPPatch turbo keys preset, so that it
  uses the default derived from the FPS (which is what happened before
  v3.40)
o Changed my file requester routine - it'll now always separate the
  file from the dir, instead of putting the whole path in the file part
  of the file requester in some cases (KS 2.04+ only)
o It's no longer possible to select 30fps NTSC, as it never really
  worked properly anyway
o Removed ASYNCHELP tooltype / cli option - F1GP-Ed will now only use
  (automatically) asynchronous help when amigaguide.library >= V39 is in
  use
o F1GP-Ed can now be fully iconified (KS 2.04+ only)
o Danish language now supported again
o New F1GP-Ed icon and datafile icons, with "high nose" design - added
  newicons to almost all the icons in the distribution too

Bug Fixes:

o The patch added in v3.40 that allowed the game to display more than
  64 entries in the file requester was bugged - if directories
  containing more than 64 entries were viewed, strange things could
  happen (e.g. the car setup getting trashed, a guru when switching
  off the file filter).  The patch has now been rewritten, and the
  limit on entries has been reintroduced - a file requester can now
  only display up to 200 entries
o None of the walls disappear anymore when you drive close to them -
  V3.42 only fixed the pit garages from disappearing.  Now this problem
  has been fixed for good
o Reverted back to the pre-3.40 "less cars in races" patch code, as
  there was a possibility, under certain circumstances, for the "ghost
  cars" to appear when using V3.40-3.42
o The analog gearchange setting is no longer reset when loading from the
  binary
o The sky colour in the palette now gets permanently altered when saving
  to memory, and loading the palette from memory now works properly if
  you were in a wet session
o The 'safe indestructability' patch was causing the debris from crashes
  to fly straight up vertically, instead of spreading out like usual
o The IFF-ILBM loader was broken - it didn't decode uncompressed images
  as it should have
o Fixed an error in the colour editor - cars with the McLaren-Marlboro
  nose design cannot have a central stripe on the side of the nose
o Fixed a problem related to analog joystick - enabling PatchF1GP patches
  without saving to memory to first caused F1GP not recognize the
  joystick properly
============================================================================
V3.42 - 21 June 1998   (157616 bytes)

Bug Fixes:

o A side effect of the extra code added into the F1GP executable in v3.40,
  for the less cars in races patch and the autoloading of f1gp.library,
  was that the walls of the pit garages became invisible.  A workaround
  for this has now been added
o PatchF1GP no longer causes the game's car setup menu to be re-entered
  after exiting the car setup menu (only happened if you held the joystick
  backwards instead of just tapping it)
============================================================================
V3.41 - 7 June 1998   (157676 bytes)

o The GPPatch HUD is now completely disabled if F1GP is running on a
  scan-doubled screenmode (e.g. DblPAL, DblNTSC, Multiscan, etc) as it is
  impossible to display it fully under these circumstances, due to hardware
  limitations
o Altered the HUD to use AGA specific features, where appropriate, which
  should stop it slowing F1GP down as much (uses less DMA)
o f1gp.library 36.6

Bug Fixes:

o Major problem fixed in the save to binary routine (due to the new quick
  load/save switch in v3.40) which caused corruption
o Fixed a problem in GPPatch that caused corruption below the F1GP display
  if the vertical display position was set to 6 or greater
============================================================================
V3.40 - 2 June 1998   (157184 bytes)

o f1gp.library v36 - major update, including new game patches:
  - The game will now work with non-15kHz AGA screenmodes including
    DblPAL, DblNTSC and Multiscan (i.e. not PAL or NTSC)
  - Patched the game to utilize the faster fetch modes of the AGA chipset,
    making the game slightly faster/smoother on an A1200 or A4000
o Major change to the "Less cars in races" memory patch.  This option
  has been removed.  It is replaced by a patch that is always saved to
  the F1GP binary or memory, which means you can save less than 26 to
  the game without having to worry about installing the patch.  Of
  course, the patch will now work even if F1GP-Ed is not running.
o The game will now attempt to load f1gp.library and patch itself when
  you run it - this means that the VBR problem, for example, will
  disappear for good!  No longer will you have to run F1GP-Ed in the
  background to enable the 'use VBR' patch!  Only takes effect once you
  have saved to the F1GP binary with this new version
o Moved wet weather options out of the preferences into a new seperate
  wet weather window, joined by a new option which changes the way wet
  weather is determined during a championship season
o Added option to disable the unnecessary requestors that show up in the
  game after loading or saving a file successfully
o Added two more symbols to the GPPatch HUD which tell you that a car
  will be pitting this lap (differentiates between damage and tyre stops)
o Due to popular demand, it is now possible to preset the turbo keys
o Automatically fixes a problem with the game's file requester, removing
  the limit of only displaying a maximum of 64 entries
o Viewer screens for the backdrops and cockpit designs are now opened
  using the most appropriate screenmode, instead of defaulting to PAL/NTSC

Bug Fixes:

o Due to a bug in the ILBM reader code I 'borrowed', F1GP-Ed could hang
  (or simply show corrupted images) when decoding IFF-ILBM files using the
  cockpit and backdrop windows.  This only happened if the image has been
  saved in PPaint or DPaint with a stencil switched on
o The digital joystick dual gear change button feature now works as it
  should have - before, it was impossible to preset button 2 for changing
  up a gear
o The calculator no longer creates incorrect perf values for a teams'
  first driver when no lap time was specified for that driver (0:00.000)
o The sound samples module should have been recompiled in V3.34 - the
  sound sample save to memory feature hasn't been working properly since
  then due to this
o Not all the keyboard shortcuts worked in the GPPatch window
o Starting F1GP-Ed via a datafile icon in different directory now works
============================================================================
V3.36 - 12 October 1997   (155064 bytes)

o The GPPatch HUD now indicates (with a '>' before the driver name) when
  cars are in the pit lane
o Greek language now supported

Bug Fixes:

o Negative values for the sliders in the display window now get rendered
  properly (didn't work with helvetica, at least)
o Infinite qualifying tyres feature broke in v3.32 - it's now possible to
  turn this cheat off again when saving to the binary
o Keyboard shortcuts now work for localized MX gadgets (radio buttons)
============================================================================
V3.35 - 7 September 1997   (154868 bytes)

Bug Fixes:

o In v3.34, the system would lock up after exiting from the cockpit (ie
  pressing Esc) if F1GP-Ed was loaded and the GPPatch window was open
o Fixed the GPPatch driver list and info bar so they work properly if you
  decide to reduce the number of cars during a game playing session
o The Czech locale catalog now works again
============================================================================
V3.34 - 31 August 1997   (154856 bytes)

o Updated f1gp.library (now V35.4): New patch will make F1GP take notice of
  the VBR on systems which normally use it - this means that if you usually
  have to disable the VBR to get F1GP to work, then you no longer need to
  do so
o The Amiga's audio filter can now be set to your preferred setting
  whenever you play the game
o It is now possible to have wet practice and qualifying sessions
o Added a new multiplayer patch which makes player cars indestructible when
  the computer is driving them.  This is grouped with the "Fix Speed
  Problems" patch (previously named "Multiplayer Fix")
o The position of the GPPatch HUD can now be preset
o Lap records can now be loaded and mixed with the current records
o Shortcut "Today" button provided in the lap record editor
o Improved "Less cars in races" patch - it is no longer possible to finish
  26th in a race when less than 26 cars start the race!

Bug Fixes:

o Viewing current backdrops now works with version C of the game - before
  F1GP-Ed would try to access the wrong disk
o Fixed harmless enforcer hits which occurred when printing out the driver
  performance
o The target display, use team hp and driving aids cheat options will now
  be read correctly when loading from the binary / memory
o The default position status will now be saved to the binary correctly
o With certain display positions, the left of the GPPatch stats screen
  would get chopped off - fixed
o Sometimes, the GPPatch driver stats screen would have vertical bars
  running down it if the HUD was on - fixed
o Position 2 for the snapshot keys broke in v3.33
o Removed a bug in the save to memory routine which caused car setups
  to get trashed during a championship season, which made the game crash
  during the final races of the season in some circumstances
============================================================================
V3.33 - 18 May 1997   (152636 bytes)

o Recoded all routines that load to / save from the F1GP binary or memory
  using a different approach.  This was done to drastically reduce the
  likelyhood of me making mistakes in the future which cause the F1GP binary
  to be corrupted - see below...

Bug Fixes:

o Idiotic bug introduced in v3.32 which affects versions B and C of the
  game.  As a result if you saved to the binary it will now be corrupt :(
  Tell-tale signs include the menu titles in the game being corrupt
o If you move a team and/or driver up or down in the editor lists and then
  click on one of the buttons to open a colour editor, the correct colours
  are now displayed
============================================================================
V3.32 - 7 May 1997   (151256 bytes)

o GPPatch "turbo keys" can now be disabled
o "Exit to DOS - Are you sure?" requester in the game can now be skipped
o The time it takes for a pitstop can now be adjusted
o Colours can now be imported from (and exported to) IFF image / palette
  files
o "Practice Fuel Load" feature has been improved - the fuel load calculated
  will now be exactly the same as the fuel load in a race of the same
  number of laps
o Localized a lot of the older strings that couldn't be translated before
o Optimized (40% reduction) the data used to draw the images in the colour
  editors - this means the colour editors will open faster initially and
  the images will be drawn a little bit faster.

Bug Fix:

o When loading a prefs file (from ENV:F1GP-Ed) which was saved before v3.20
  the F1GP Binary path no longer has a missing '/' (if there was one in
  the path to begin with :-)
============================================================================
V3.31 - 2 March 1997   (151000 bytes)

o Increased available range for the horizontal display position (-30 to 30)

Bug Fixes:

o The display position can now be saved to (and loaded from) the F1GP binary
o Due to optimizations in v3.30 loading from memory would deselect all
  drivers in F1GP - fixed
o The palette is now read correctly when loading from memory
o GPPatch should now handle all horizontal display positions - in v3.30
  if the position was less than -16, the display would be corrupted
============================================================================
V3.30 - 23 February 1997   (151008 bytes)

o The "in-game" palette can now be altered
o GPPatch: font is now user selectable, HUD size can be preset, HUD can
  be enabled automatically, the "right-shift" car setup change can be
  disabled.  Reduced chip ram usage, plus the required chip ram is now
  allocated dynamically (only if you actually install GPPatch).  Display
  position is no longer hardcoded - uses same position as F1GP is using
o Added Hall of Fame options to the Statistics window to configure the
  HoF lap record output
o Added option to allow the "Abandon Qualifying" requestor to be skipped
o The position of the game display can now be preset
o Moved "frame rate", "target display" and "detail" options to the new
  Display window
o Moved "reverse steering help" option to the Car Control window - god
  knows why I didn't put it there to begin with! ;-)
o Improved the way the Graphics window trys to load the image - if it fails
  to open the file, it will try and open the file (without path) from the
  same directory as the graphics settings file
o Cockpit designs can now be viewed directly from within F1GP-Ed
o The backdrop (.bkg) files used by F1GP's menus can now be replaced with
  other images
o Main window can now be resized
o Optimized all memory load/save and patch install/removal routines
o Improved font sensitivity calculations for proportional fonts - should
  result in more compact windows (tested with over 50 different fonts)
o Updated f1gp.library - V35.2 (minor code optimizations)
o Altered behaviour of the PATCH and SAVETOMEM tooltypes/cli options - if
  any of these are specified and F1GP isn't present in memory, error
  messages won't be displayed any more
  
Bug Fixes:

o Saving cockpit designs to memory now works properly
o Fixed bug in Nigel Rowe's McLaren-D cockpit (gear indicator no longer
  blanks out)
============================================================================
V3.23 - 3 December 1996   (140248 bytes)

o The "super-steering help" which is activated when using an analog
  joystick can now be disabled
o When saving a new datafile, if ENV:Sys/def_F1GP-Ed.info exists it will
  be used as the datafile's icon.  Otherwise the built-in icon will be
  used (as before)
o New default datafile icon
o Preliminary 1997 season datafile + Nigel Rowe's updated McLaren cockpit

Bug Fixes:

o The GPPatch HUD will now work when using a high res mouse pointer - at
  last!
o Harmless enforcer hits removed from file requesters that start with
  a blank directory field
o Foreign character keyboard shortcuts are now recognized
============================================================================
V3.22 - 20 October 1996   (139812 bytes)

o Added a feature to local speed factor window to automatically adjust
  the speed factor when different frame rates are used
o New patch to restore system clock after leaving the cockpit in F1GP
o It's now possible to alter the amount of fuel you get at the start of
  a practice/qualifying session
o Removed the LOADF1GP delay which was introduced in V3.20.  Instead the
  delay can be defined using the new DELAY tooltype/option
o The "1991 Performance" text which is displayed when you win a
  championship is now altered in respect to the "Level Button" text you
  specify
o Multiplayer Fix patch improved.  Player cars under computer control
  now get the HP of the team instead of a hardcoded value (716 - Ace)

Bug Fixes:

o Online help now works even if you omit the HELPFILE tooltype - it should
  default to the English guide file
o The directory for datafiles was getting corrupted (only when using the
  German catalog file), as one of the buffers was too small
o The cursor position in the data gadget (in the lap record editor) now
  resets to the beginning after entering a date
o The "All" save mode in the sound sample window didn't always work
  correctly when the samples were too large, resulting in incorrect and
  unnecessary error messages
o During a race the GPPatch driver times list was inaccurate as the race
  time was calculated from the moment you enter the cockpit, instead of
  starting when the lights go green.  The race times should now be 100%
  accurate
o In multiplayer races the GPPatch HUD and driver gaps were in relation
  to the best player during the first turn (after the first changeover
  this problem didn't occur) instead of sticking with the player being
  controlled
============================================================================
V3.21 - 6 September 1996   (138184 bytes)

Bug Fixes:

o Saving to memory using v3.20 crashed on Amigas with a 68000!
o Selecting "All the Same" in the options window would select "Random", and
  vice versa - fixed.
============================================================================
V3.20 - 1 September 1996   (138176 bytes)

o Calculator window - allows calculation of teams' HP and driver
  performance ratings by entering lap times
o The graphics window can now load IFF ILBM images (requires
  iffparse.library)
o Altered the way lap records and dates are entered and displayed - a
  lot nicer now.  However, these custom gadgets will only work properly
  with KS 2.0+ - this was unavoidable due to missing/unimplemented features
  in the KS 1.x version of gadtools.library :(
o Saving/loading to/from the F1GP binary is now handled in a different way.
  Instead of selecting the "f1gp" from a file requester every time, you
  just need to set it once in the main window
o It is now possible to have wet races at Phoenix (USA)
o The tyre compound used by computer cars can now be altered
o The default tyre selection can now be altered
o HELPFILE tooltype / cli option to allow the location and name of the
  F1GP-Ed.guide file to be altered
o The sound sample window has been enhanced to provide extra features
o New menu item to allow saving to a datafile, F1GP binary and memory
  all in one go
o Minor GUI enhancements (up/down buttons in team/driver windows ghosted
  when appropriate)
o Corrected spelling of page on the german password protection screen in
  the game (Siete -> Seite)
o Added short delay after loading F1GP (when the LOADF1GP option is
  present) in order to stop F1GP-Ed installing patches and things before
  the F1GP task has been initialized
o Documentation and installer available in german.
o New language catalogs: spanish and norwegian

Bug Fixes:

o Using the cursor keys to select entries in the list gadgets in the team,
  driver, setup and record windows now works properly
o After many hours of "hair-pulling" trying to work out why F1GP started
  doing weird things and crashing for no apparent reason, I discovered I
  needed to make some alterations to my code (compiler related).  This was
  due to the increasing size of F1GP-Ed.  AFAIK, this didn't effect earlier
  versions.
o The allocation of pit bays during races with less than 26 cars now works
  properly
o The multiplayer bug fix saga continues... After changeovers cars should
  now get the correct HP when Use Team HP is on
============================================================================
V3.16 - 3 July 1996   (123108 bytes)

Bug Fix:

o Messed up the load from F1GP binary / memory routines in V3.14 - the
  following were not read correctly: Nice Audio, Fast GUI, Timing,
  File Filter, Default Dir, Fast Windows, Animations and the Analog
  Joystick switch!  Saving wasn't affected
============================================================================
V3.15 - 23 June 1996   (123092 bytes)

o Cursor keys can now be used to select entries of list view gadgets in
  various windows

Bug Fixes:

o Major bug in V3.14 which caused F1GP-Ed to crash when saving to memory
  on 68000 machines - fixed
o Race positions are now always correct after completing a race which
  starts with less than 26 cars (no blank spaces in the top positions)
============================================================================
V3.14 - 12 June 1996   (122676 bytes)

o Added a feature to the local speed factors patch which automatically
  reduces the speed factor when racing in wet weather
o It is now possible to start a race with less than 26 cars, via a new
  memory patch
o New feature which enables you to choose whether audio interrupts
  should be disabled - this means music modules can be played in the
  background when navigating the game menus without interruption
o Code optimizations and minor GUI enhancements
o Recompiled with DICE 3.20

Bug Fixes:

o Exiting via Ctrl-C now removes patches from F1GP - before it caused F1GP
  to crash! 
o Multiplayer fix fixed again - computer driven player cars should now
  go at the correct speed at the start of races (before any changeovers)
o Pit light position now saved properly to the "f1gp" file
o Loading from the binary/memory now trys to set the "Target Display"
  option accordingly (> 8fps only)
o With the GPPatch HUD on, pressing the key to bring up the driver list
  now works properly - before the display was sometimes corrupted
o Harmless enforcer hit removed from keyboard shortcut processing routine
o No enforcer hit when specifying FONT without FONTSIZE (size now defaults
  to 8)
============================================================================
V3.12 - 10 March 1996   (122916 bytes)

o Under KS 3.0 or higher, the colour editors always attempt to open on the
  current screen (ie including Workbench) if enough free colours are
  available, otherwise they will use their own custom screen (as before)
o Altered the traction control gadget text slightly and description in
  documentation to make it less ambiguous
o 1996 season datafile, 2 new example sound samples and 2 new example
  cockpit designs added to the distribution
o A few minor changes

Bug Fixes:

o In the team editor the pit order is no longer messed up after moving
  teams about
o Multiplayer fix fixed (!) - hopefully this will fix the problem of the
  player cars being called into the pits continuously after the first
  allocated pit stop in multiplayer games
o Slight incompatibility between older versions of GadTools and V39+
  discovered - a few things recoded accordingly
o The main window will now open when switching back to the Workbench screen
  from a custom screen under KS 1.x
o Routine that detects whether you have pressed help in a string or integer
  gadget has been fixed - it sometimes brought up a help page when making
  colour selections in palette gadgets under KS 3.x for example
============================================================================
V3.11 - 12 December 1995   (122436 bytes)

o Steering help can now be removed for reverse gear
o Added QUIT tooltype / cli option
o Added "Patch After Loading" option to Settings menu
o Improved Ctrl-C handling

Bug Fix:

o The "Level Name" is now saved correctly to World Circuit - previously
  the WC binary got corrupted slightly
============================================================================
V3.10 - 25 November 1995   (121772 bytes)

o Improved the cockpit graphic replacement feature - a larger picture is
  now used (extra things to change)
o Positions of various dashboard indicators can now be relocated
o Added new feature from PatchF1GP 1.9 - pit lane speed limit
o Added "Position Snapshot" feature (from Grant's HackF1GP)
o Added a "Multiplayer Fix" for multiplayer games - player cars under
  computer control should now travel at a similar speed to computer cars
o When saving F1GP name, record & setup files the correct checksum is
  added to the file, so now files that F1GP-Ed saves are identical to if
  they were saved via the game
o Under KS 2.0 or higher, you can now "drop" a F1GP-Ed datafile icon onto
  the main window (ie now a AppWindow) and it will be loaded for you
o Most keyboard shortcuts are now localized
o Added a "memory save" menu shortcut
o A few minor GUI changes
o Now requires f1gp.library V35

Bug Fixes:

o Some keyboard shortcuts didn't work - instead they produced a software
  failure!  This has been fixed
o The GPPatch HUD now always shows just the drivers' surnames
o When using the Driver Editor without the Team Editor window being open
  no longer results in possible software failures
o The "Use Team HP" feature now works properly in multiplayer games.
o "Save to memory" clashes with patches when running more than one copy of
  F1GP-Ed at the same time have been removed
o Fixed World Circuit quit patching (f1gp.library)
============================================================================
V3.03 - 27 September 1995   (114624 bytes)

o Added a lap counter to the GPPatch status line for qualifying and
  practice sessions

Bug Fix:

o V3.02 didn't work as it should have done for registered users - hopefully,
  this version will :-)
============================================================================
V3.02 - 18 September 1995    (114584 bytes)

o "Pit Light Off" feature moved to the Preferences file editor.  The
  Miscellaneous memory patch window has gone for the time being
o Added ASYNCHELP tooltype/cli option - by default, synchronously help
  is now used
o Catalog translations now available for Germany and the Czech Republic

Bug Fixes:

o Major problem with the main string localization routine which meant that
  the wrong strings were displayed most of the time with a F1GP-Ed.catalog
  file present - things now work as they should have done in V3.0
o Changed one of the load routines.  In particular, the Zoom option in the
  Camera window is now read correctly from the F1GP binary
o When opening a colour editor, on the rare occurance the screen will not
  be opened when it should have been.  I hope to have fixed this now
o Finally decided to fix the integer rounding errors that occured with the
  PlayerHP & FinishHP after multiple load/saves to the binary or memory
============================================================================
V3.01 - 4 September 1995    (114812 bytes)

o Now uses and requires "f1gp.library" - a little something I knocked up
  to make things a lot neater and to remove clashes between F1GP-Ed and
  other utilities (e.g. SplitTime, GPPerf).  This is a major change, but
  there is no noticable difference to the user
o Added an option to specify how many fast laps can be done in qualifying
  before the pit light comes on

Bug Fixes:

o Colours are no longer corrupted in the colour editors under KS 3.x
o The brake balance for race setups is now printed correctly
o Fixed some memory loss that occured during initialization failure
o Corrected an invalid link in the guide (Menu index)
============================================================================
V3.0     - 28 August 1995    (114988 bytes)
V2.99 AF -  3 July   1995    (109964 bytes - public beta)

o Brand new GUI layout - more modular
o Complete rewrite of virtually all code resulting in greater efficiency
o Traction control, frame rate, car responsiveness alteration and
  2-button gear changing - same as in PatchF1GP V1.8 by Grant Reeve
o Various routines from GPPatch V2.20 by Toni Wilen, including time gaps,
  lap time charts, hud display and game speed - GPPatch was altered to
  run on version C of F1GP, to be removable and to have user definable
  keys by me :)
o Separate Speed Factors for each circuit.
o Presets for F1GP detail level and keyboard control method
o Alternative HP setting for when race completed
o Removal of HP degradation
o Set the time delays before yellow flags are shown and cars are removed
  from the track
o Alteration of the cockpit bitmap graphic used in F1GP
o Removal of checksums in F1GP so that it's possible to load record and
  setup files that F1GP-Ed saves out
o Title bar added to the F1GP screen, which means you can switch screens
  in F1GP by clicking in the top-right corner of the screen
o Presetting of the F1GP file requester filter button
o Certain keys used in F1GP can now be user defined
o Provided some presets for camera angles and car damage
o Can print out team/driver ratings, as well as lap records and car setups
  (in a variety of combinations, including Hall of Fame format)
o Pit light off in qualifying option
o Restructured the way "Selected" drivers are set in F1GP and F1GP-Ed
o F1GP-Ed can now open on its own custom screen and with user selectable
  font, as well as a user selectable public screen
o Colour editors now have the exact palette used by F1GP and the time
  taken to initialize the region maps has been reduced.
o Improved error messages when running under KS 2.0 or higher.
o F1GP's task priority is always set to -100 when F1GP is detected in
  memory, resulting other tasks running at normal speed.  This doesn't
  affect the actual game (ie while driving) as it multitasking is disabled.
o F1GP-Ed now uses dos ReadArgs() to handle command line operation, which
  also means limited cli options when running on KS 1.x :-(
o Settings file now saved in ENV:F1GP-Ed (instead of S:)
o Most F1GP-Ed customization is now done by using ToolTypes
o New CLI (KS 2.0+) and ToolType options
o The "GetFile" gadget image now shows up with KS 1.x
o Most of the strings are now localized, meaning that F1GP-Ed can work in
  any language provided a catalog file and locale.library (WB 2.1+) are
  found

Bug Fixes:

o Increasing the Speed Factor, while the "Use Team HP" setting is selected
  no longer has the side effect of increasing the steering sensitivity,
  which rendered the car impossible to drive
o When the SAVETOMEM cli option is used, the first available driver slot
  sometimes got "selected" by F1GP as well as your choices.  This shouldn't
  happen anymore
o Maximum HP is now 1431 (instead of 1432)
o Minimum Speed Factor is now 15000 (instead of 0)
============================================================================
V2.45 - 11 June 1995

Bug Fixes:

o The slow duplicate car which was partially removed in the last version
  has now been removed completely (fingers crossed).  It was showing up on
  quick races and races after qualifying was skipped, ultimatly resulting
  in F1GP to crash.
o "Filter Dirs" ASL V40 incompatibility fixed.
o Enforcer hit in the autoload requester removed.
o Recompiled with Dice 3.01
============================================================================
V2.44 - 20 April 1995

Bug Fix:

o Due to a side effect of allowing drivers 36-40 in teams 19 and 20, in the
  previous version, F1GP became confused and sometimes there would be
  duplicate drivers - one of which drived slowly and in a strange coloured
  car.  I hope I've sorted this problem out now.
============================================================================
V2.43 - 30 March 1995

o First release since the theft of my Amiga.  As a consequence of this
  theft, the keyfiles are in a new format and, therefore, any keyfiles
  sent out with previous versions won't work with this version or future
  versions (ask me for a new keyfile if you need one).
o You can now use drivers 36-40 in teams 19 and 20 without problems
o Recompiled with Dice 3.0

Bug Fixes:

o The maximum length of team and engine names should have been 12 instead
  of 13 - using 13 characters caused the next name to be erased.
o F1GP-Ed no longer locks up if there is not enough memory to open a
  colour editor.
o Loading car setups or lap records caused F1GP-Ed to crash when certain
  windows were not open - fixed.
o If the brake balance of race setups was set towards the rear it was
  replaced with the qualifying brake balance, when they were printed out - 
  fixed.
o If you don't use the Topaz 8 font, and your chosen font is too big for
  some windows (not all), it should have been set back to Topaz 8, but due
  to a bug in the GadToolsBox source this was not always the case.  So,
  each window can now have its own font (ie it remembers the right font).
============================================================================
V2.42 - 29 January 1995

o Added new feature for analog joystick owners to allow separate buttons
  to change up/down gears.
o ReqTools requesters are now only used as the last resort, making F1GP-Ed
  slightly more "Style Guide" complient.  Use RTPatch to force ReqTools
  requesters, if you prefer them.
o Improved efficiency of window opening routines, and put "locks" on windows
  while they are being opened and drawn.

Bug Fixes:

o Major bug which caused version C of F1GP to crash just after loading, has
  been fixed.
o Corrected the default for "Fast Windows", and the default pit crew
  colours.
============================================================================
V2.41 - 17 January 1995

o Improved F1GP detection for the load/save memory options.  In V2.40,
  F1GP-Ed could only detect F1GP if the 'f1gp' file was run.
o The "Filter Dirs" no longer affects the sound sample file requesters, as
  I found it incredibly tedious having to switch it off everytime I wanted
  to save a sample which wasn't exactly the same size as recommended.
o F1GP-Ed executable size reduced a little.

Bug fixes:

o Major bug removed - F1GP no longer crashes when you or the computer cars
  have used 4 sets of qualifying tyres, when the "Infinite Q Tyres" feature
  is switched off!
o On-line help now works on the F1GP Prefs menu.  Menu help, in general, now
  works with KS 3.0 (and above), and bugs resulting from use of menu help
  have been fixed.
o When any slider gadgets show 95, on-line help was always brought up
  unwantedly - this was partially due to a bug in GadToolsBox, but I have
  now altered the code so it works correctly.
o Using ASL file requesters and the Filter Dirs option caused F1GP-Ed to
  lock up - now fixed.
============================================================================
V2.40 - 3 January 1995

o Added an option to load a single car setup to the car setup editor.
o Added options to read/write to a resident copy of F1GP running in memory,
  rather than to the binary file.
o New CLI option "SaveToMem".
o New options in the Hacks 2 window which allow use of Q Tyres in practice,
  infinite Q Tyres and a faster F1GP GUI.
o A couple of things tidied up regarding filenames and dirs when using the
  CLI options or the Autoload feature.

Bug fixes:

o The "Use Topaz 8" options caused "selected" button gadgets in the main
  window to get confused sometimes.  This is now fixed.
o Selecting "All the Same" in the options window would select "Random", and
  vice versa - fixed.
o When running under KS 1.x the Hacks 2 window is now activated when opened,
  like other windows.
============================================================================
V2.31 - 26 November 1994

Bug fixes:

o The "Separate Qual/Race Car Setups" option was displaying the opposite to
  what it should have been - fixed.
o The Day and Month gadgets did not work properly stopped working in V2.30,
  due to them only allowing a single digit instead of 2.
o The "Use Topaz 8" option stopped working in V2.30, causing the system to
  lock-up!
o The "Zoom" camera parameter is no longer altered after saving to the
   binary, which did cause problems.
============================================================================
V2.30 - 16 November 1994

o Added a camera view adjustment editor to the Hacks II window.
o Added a car setup editor to the lap record editor window, and altered the
  "Extras" menu to make way for this.
o Finally decided to support the "Separate Setups" option from F1GP race
  options, because of the new car setup editor - Hacks window altered.
o Transformed the text doc into AmigaGuide® format and rewrote some sections,
  which allowed me to implement on-line help.
o The main structure of F1GP-Ed's source code has changed to increase
  efficiency - GadToolsBox generated code was less efficient.
o Added an AmigaDOS "Version" string.
o Provided an "Installer" script.

Bug Fixes:

o The "Animations" checkbox in the "Options" window did not work properly -
  it always took the value from "Fast Windows".
o F1GP-Ed V2.13+ would not run from the CLI on KS 1.x systems due to a bug
  (???) in KS 1.x.  To fix this, the initial stack check is not carried out
  when running on KS 1.x.
o The Lap Record editor now gets updated when new records are loaded
  independently.
============================================================================
V2.21 - 23 October 1994

o Added a lap record editor, and rearranged the "Extras" menu to make space
  for this.
o Slight decrease (30%) in the time taken to enable the "Click Graphics"
  option.  There is no longer a long delay when quitting F1GP-Ed if the
  option has been enabled at some point.
o Further optimizations in the source code.
o When the "Colour Ed Selection" is set to "By Colour", and "UNDO" is pressed,
  the current palette colour now remains unchanged.

Bug Fixes:

o When using the "Output as Text" option, if any of the years of the dates
  were < 1985, the date would be completely wrong.
o Bug when using "Click Graphics" on the car for team 1 - clicking on the
  Nose>>Cockpit part would sometimes colour the wrong part.
o Possible chance of memory corruption which occurred when using the
  Autoload file requester has been removed.
============================================================================
V2.20 - 29 September 1994

o Discovered that the A600 WWW F1GP binary is slightly different.  F1GP-Ed
  now supports this version.
o F1GP-Ed will now replace any sound sample in the game.

Bug Fixes:

o Somehow, the "Driving Aid Cheat" option in the Hacks window stopped
  working - it works now though.
o In V2.13, reading Car Setup files into F1GP-Ed proved impossible as I
  made a slight mistake in the new file handling code.  Lap Record files
  were trying to be read instead.  Works fine now.
o Minor bug in the default team names: Team 10 was named as "Sorrell"
  instead of "Masuka Realm".
o Slight bug in new file handling routine, which may have caused corrupted
  filenames and titles in some requesters.
o Slight mistake in the PAL Timing code, the mistake did not seem to cause
  any problems, but I have corrected it anyway.
o Major bug when saving an engine sample.  If the sample was less than 21160
  bytes, F1GP-Ed would probably corrupt the memory, resulting in "Software
  Failures".
============================================================================
V2.13 - 19 September 1994

o Improved file handling (now uses less stack) and added an option to filter
  files in most of the F1GP-Ed requesters.  As a consequence F1GP-Ed now needs
  ReqTools V38+ or ASL V38+ - not much of a loss, as ReqTools requesters are
  far better than ASL V36 requesters anyway.
o Now, F1GP-Ed will not run if you are using a stack size < 4000 bytes - an
  error message will be displayed instead.
o Made low memory checking robust (it was totally inadequate).  F1GP-Ed will
  never crash in low memory conditions - it will just abort what it is doing
  and wait for you to respond.
o "Checking" the "Click Graphics" options in the Settings menu will now
  allocate the data needed, if it has not been allocated already. However,
  this data will only be freed when you quit F1GP-Ed.

Bug Fixes:

o Still a few errors in the graphics data - there are definitly no more
  errors now!
o Bug when using the cursor keys to change colours in the colour editor
  causing the hilight to be turned on - fixed.
============================================================================
V2.12 - 12 September 1994

o The Colour Editors have now been improved.  It is now possible to alter
  parts by colour and it is also possible to click on the actual graphics
  instead of clicking the part name gadgets.  I then had to add 2 options
  to the settings menu.

Bug Fix:

o The graphics data for the colour editors had a few minor errors -
  corrected them.
============================================================================
V2.11 - 31 August 1994

o When loading F1GP name, setup or records files into F1GP-Ed, the default
  directory for the file requesters will be the same as the dir specified in
  the hacks window.

Bug Fixes:

o After saving a new sample to the binary, the directory used for datafiles
  was being replaced with the bin dir - not a major bug, but caused me (and
  others, I expect) some confusion with datafiles being saved in the wrong
  place.
o If you clicked on a "Edit xxx..." colour editor button when the colour
  editor was already open, the colour editor would iconify itself, instead
  of just being brought into view - fixed.
o Slight bug in the damage, analog stats and speed factor gadgets if you
  entered a value over 65535.  The value should have been decreased to the
  maximum, and now is.
o Whoops... the maximum damage should have been 32767.  32768 does the same
  as zero!
============================================================================
V2.10 - 25 August 1994

o First release for REGISTERED users.
o Totally rewrote the GUI using GadToolsBox.  All of the windows used by
  F1GP-Ed can now be open and used at the same time, including 3 separate
  colour editors.  New option for the config menu which remembers windows
  that are open and their positions.  The GUI is now font adaptive.  Font
  adaptivity can be disable with the new Use Topaz option on the settings
  menu.  When running under KS 3.0 "New Look" menus will be used.  All this
  meant rewriting most of the code (or rearranging it), which may have
  introduced bugs - but hopefully not!
o Renamed the Configuration menu to Settings.
o Can now use the right mouse button to toggle the hilight in the colour
  editors - also moved the palette to the left so it is easier to access.
  The colour editor no longer uses the KS 2.0 default colours for the
  window - instead the same colours are used as the ones set in Workbench
  preferences.
o Added an option to reorder the allocation of garages in the pit lane 
  (doubles as an alternative team selector).
o Can now change the number of points that are awarded to the top 10
  finishers during a season.
o Provided an option to print out lap records and car setups to a file (aka
  F1GP-LapSet - but with more options).
o Renamed the "Tyre Grip" hacks option to "Speed Factor" as tyre grip is not
  an accurate description of the function.
o Improved error checking when loading/saving files.
o Removed stack checking as F1GP-Ed now uses less stack (< 2000 bytes), plus
  the stack check code would increase the executable by over 10K bytes.

Bug Fixes: 

o Removed a bug which caused crashes when using the colour editors.  This
  bug has been resident since V0.1!  There were only a few isolated cases,
  but when developing the new GUI the bug grew in frequency.
o For some reason I forgot to save the default dir from the hacks window in
  the datafile - it was still being saved in the config file.  I have
  corrected this now.
o Bug in the damage gadgets - DICE does not like the maximum value for some
  reason, so I have halved it to 32768.
============================================================================
V2.04 - 26 November 1994   (86560 bytes)

Bug fix: 

o V2.03 failed to work with the A600 WWW version of F1GP, due to me
  accidently pressing the delete key while editting the source code!
============================================================================
V2.03 - 19 November 1994   (Update of V2.02 & bug fixes from V2.10-V2.21)

o Added support for the A600 WWW version of F1GP.
o Added a couple of other non-F1GP-Ed things from the registered version (ie
  AmigaGuide® documenation, Installer script & Version string)

Bug fixes:

o Minor bug in the default team names: Team 10 was named as "Sorrell"
  instead of "Masuka Realm".
o Slight mistake in the PAL Timing code, the mistake did not seem to cause
  any problems, but I have corrected it anyway.
o Major bug when saving an engine sample.  If the sample was less than 21160
  bytes, F1GP-Ed would probably corrupt the memory, resulting in "Software
  Failures".
o Removed minor errors from the colour editor graphics data
o Slight bug in the damage, analog stats and tyre grip gadgets if you
  entered a value over 65535.  The value should have been decreased to the
  maximum, but I made a slight mistake in the source code :)
o Whoops... the maximum damage should have been 32767.
============================================================================
V2.02 - 27 July 1994

o Added an option to adjust the timing according to whether PAL or NTSC is
  being used.
o Added a keyfile processor which loads in relevant information about the
  registered user and enables the `Timing' option.
============================================================================
V2.00 - 23 June 1994

o Added memory check routines to try and prevent F1GP-Ed crashing in low
  memory conditions.
o Added an option to the configuration menu to allow the user to disable the
  quit requester.
o Added an UNDO button to the colour editor.
o Removed the Read and Write cycle gadgets as they have become pretty
  pointless at the moment as there are only 2 ways you can read and write.
  Extra items added to the file menu to cope with these changes.
o Renamed the prefs menu to configuration menu, due to possible confusions
  between F1GP Preferences and prefs.
o Splitted the F1GP Preferences into 2 separate windows.
o Added a new F1GP Preferences menu to access these 2 windows and provide
  options to reset the options and hacks to normal.
o Added an option to save a new engine sound sample to the F1GP binary.
o Added alot of new features in the new Hacks section of Preferences.
  Briefly these are: Manual selection, driver aid cheat, damage, skip menus,
  use team settings, choose quick race, wet race probability, tyre grip,
  Player HP and additional A1200 keyboard layout.
o New format for the F1GP-Ed datafile.  Old format still recognized though.
o Major rewrite of file handling routines, resulting in more reliable and
  faster saves, but a slight increase in the code size for these.
o A few other cosmetic changes also, including some graphics.

Bug Fixes:

o When writing to the binary, F1GP-Ed will assign no drivers to any teams
  that will not be used (ie excluded by Max Teams setting).  This will
  ensure that no cars will go extra slow, but means that the drivers that
  were erased cannot be read back from the binary.
o Changed the Max HP to 1432 (logically correct, but not fully tested!)
o F1GP-Ed should now use less stack
o The crowd no longer disappears if you use the default data.
============================================================================
V1.02 - 30 May 1994

o Discovered that F1GP-Ed did not work with World Circuit, so support is now
  included.
o Added another confirmation requester to make sure users don't overwrite
  the wrong files.
o Altered the colour editor palette slightly.
============================================================================
V1.01 - 23 May 1994

o Added dynamic stack allocation, so that the stack would never overflow
  causing requesters to crash.
============================================================================
V1.00 - 22 May 1994

First public release of F1GP-Ed.
============================================================================
V0.2 Beta - 17 April 1994

First release of the editor - for beta testers only.
