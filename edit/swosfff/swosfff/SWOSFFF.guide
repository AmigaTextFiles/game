@{b}SWOSFFF@{ub}

SWOSFFF  (SWOS  Fast  and Friendly File-editor) is a nice, friendly and easy to
use editor for any data file from Sensible World Of Soccer (SWOS) in any of its
versions.  With  it, you can alter about any aspect of any team, as well as the
stats of every player.

It  recognizes about all sorts of SWOS file formats: Original Club and National
team data, both Original and Edited Custom teams, International tournament .TMD
files, and even saved games! :)

It  has  built-in  (external) crunching/decrunching of files, a fast, SWOS-like
editing engine, and many other useful features... :)

@node DISCLAIMER "Yo no fui, no tienes testigos!!!"

This program is provided "AS-IS", with no warranty of... oh, forget it!!

If you use it and your computer hangs up, explodes, starts spitting components
through the disk drive or turns into a PC, it's not my fault!!! :)

This program is released under the concept of @{"SHORRAWARE" link CONTACT}.

It can be freely distributed, and included in any DP collection, CD or magazine
coverdisks  as  long  as the archive contents are unaltered and all that.
Oh, and sending me a copy wouldn't be bad, either... ;)))

@endnode

@node REQUIRE "Necesito... unos pastelillos!!"

What do you really really need to run this???

- An Amiga :-)
- A mouse :->
- A keyboard :-}
- A screen :-D
- A disk drive X-D (oh, ok... let's forget this)
- Sensible World Of Soccer, in any of its versions.
- Patience...

@endnode

@node INSTALL "Mi jar dis ta vassio sin ejto!!!"

Installing this can't be simpler. Just copy the SWOSFFF executable and this doc
wherever  you  want  to, and the RNCdepack command somewhere in your path, e.g.
the  C:  directory. If you want, you can replace the icon with one of the icons
provided:  4 colour (puargh! :P), MagicWB 8 colour (default) and a nice looking
16  colour  MWB  icon  following the 'RomIcons' standard (get any of these nice
icon colloctions for more info... :))

@endnode

@node USAGE "Kuantas lusesitas, ke botito..."

Using  this  is  easy  and  intuitive  :).  Almost  everything is mouse driven,
although many options can be keyboard controlled as well.

First  you  will  get the typical AmosPro file requester, asking you for a data
file.  Choose  one  (e.g.  TEAM.035 are the Spanish clubs, TEAM.008 the english
ones  and  TEAM.080 the european national teams) and, if there are no problems,
the  program will load it and tell you how many teams are in the file. Then the
first  team  will  appear on the screen... (unless you loaded a 'Career': press
@{" here " link CARR} to know more about this)

The team data appears in the following format:

- First, the team data, in this order:
  * team number
  * team name
  * coach's name
  * tactics used
  * the division the team is in: goes from 1 to 4 and 0 for non-league teams.

Be   careful   when  changing  divisions:  you  may  use  this  effectively  to
promote/relegate  a team, etc., but always keep the correct number of teams for
each division or you may crash the game!

- On the right, the team kits (first or second).

- And below, the player data, in this order:
  * number (1-16, usually)
  * player's head (dark/fair hair, black)
  * name
  * position (G,RB,LB,D,RW,LW,A)
  * nation (3 letter code)
  * value (25000 to 15000000 UK pounds)
  * skills (valued from 0 to 15 and on this order: passing, shooting, heading,
    tackling, ball control, speed and finishing)

To  edit  something,  you  just  have to move the pointer over what you want to
change  and press the mouse button: LMB to increase an amount, RMB to lower it.
If it's a name or other character string, just type in the new one...


And now, press @{" here " link BUTT} to know about all those buttons...

@endnode

@node BUTT "Botones, botoncitos, botoncetes..."

And now I go to explain about everything that can be clicked... :)
(between parenthesis is the keyboard shortcut for that option, if there's one)

@{b}THE DATA@{ub}: Editable in the @{"previously explained" link USAGE} normal way.

@{b}THE UNIFORMS@{ub}:  To change the kit colours, you just have to do the same as with
the  other  data:  click  on  the shirt, shorts or shoes to alter their colour.
Click  on  the  shirt's  collar  to change the SECONDARY shirt colour (used for
stripes  and sleeves). The two buttons on the right can be used to swap between
the  first  and  second  kit  and  to  change  the shirt design (between plain,
different-coloured sleeves, vertical and horizontal stripes), respectively.

The upper 5-button panel:

- @{b}SAVE (S)@{ub}: Save the edited data.
- @{b}UNDO (U)@{ub}: Undo all changes and reload the original teams.
- @{b}LOAD (L)@{ub}: Load another data file.
- @{b}QUIT (Q,Esc)@{ub}: Exit the program.

And the new one, @{b}PACK (P)@{ub}: This saves the data, BUT it RNC-packs it first using
the external Propack utility (which you must provide and have in your path).

And,  to  finish:  On  the  left  of  the team name and each of the 16 players,
there's a small brown button. Well, if you click on it...

- With  the LEFT mouse button, the team/player is stored in SWOSFFF's internal
clipboard and replaced with the previously stored one (none, by default)

- With the RIGHT mouse button, the team/player previously stored is pasted over
the one you choose.

Effectively,  with  a  bit of practice these 2 little functions can be used for
about every typical editing feature: cut, copy, paste, swap, delete...

@endnode

@node CARR "Tramposo yo? Tururu!"

OK,  let's suppose you loaded a Career file, that is, a saved game whan playing
as a manager (extension .CAR):

If you load such a file, you will be warned and asked for the name of the team
you want to edit. Type it and SWOSFFF will try to find it:

If it doesn't, well, bad luck. :)

If  it does, it will appear on screen. If the found data don't seem correct, it
will keep on trying until valid data are found.

If  it finally does and the team is displayed on screen, you'll be able to edit
it  on  the @{" usual way " link USAGE}  (but  this  time  there's  only one team to edit) and,
furthermore,  you'll  have  two more options available that can be accesed from
the keyboard:

-  Pressing  "B",  SWOSFFF  will keep looking through the same team through the
file (sometimes there's more than a copy of the team in the file)

-  Pressing  "J"  you  can  flick between the first and second half of the team
roster.  During  a  Career  game,  the  squad  is  usually made of more than 16
players,  but only the first 16 will be displayed: press J to see the rest. Any
remaining places in the 32-man squad will remain blank: Don't try to edit them!

More details about this in the @{"TIPS" link TIPS} section.

@endnode

@node PACKED "Cruncheate p'alla que no entro"

The  original  SWOS  data  files  are  packed  with  the well-known Rob Northen
Computing (RNC) cruncher. To be edited they must be unpacked first: now SWOSFFF
does  this  automatically providing you have the included, external 'RNCdepack'
command somewhere in your path (e.g. in C: or current dir).

Once  they  have  been unpacked, the 'Save' option will save them uncompressed,
so,  if  you  are loading SWOS directly from disk, the file probably won't fit.
The  best  way  to  avoid  this  is crunching the files before saving them (the
'Pack'  option  does  this),  but  for  this  you  MUST have the (not included)
original 'ProPack' RNC crunching utility in your path, so be careful!!

If you have enough space, it's ok to leave the files uncompressed, but this can
cause problems with large files like TEAM.008 so better re-pack them!

Note:  Remember  that  the  'Pack' option already SAVES the file, apart from
packing  it,  so  you  should not select Pack and then Save (if you did, the
file actually would NOT be crunched!)

@node TIPS "Rico, rico, y con fundamento"

GRANDMA ZARRA'S HINTS, TIPS, TRICKS AND THINGS SECTION: *:B^)

*  A  player's  quality  is  influenced  by  his  skills, not his value; so, an
expensive player with low skills will have his price dropped in little time...

*  The  Career editing feature actually could work with any sort of saved game,
but  the  program  only recognizes files ending with ".CAR". So, if you want to
edit  another  sort of data file, just add the .CAR extension to it and, if you
are lucky... :)

*  WATCH  this: The first team players in the team (numbers 1-11) will still be
the ones playing after the team is edited and will remain in the same position,
regardless  of  the  number  you  gave  them. So, try to respect every player's
position  in  the  roster:  The player swap/copy feature can be very useful for
this... ;)

*  More  about  the career editor: the players whose name starts with @{b}*ERR*@{ub} are
no more than BLANK SPACES, vacant places on the squad (players who already left
the  club,  etc...)  So  you can ADD players to your team, just by editing OVER
these places... 8)

*  Here  are  some TEAM.??? useful file names, so you do not have to search too
much:  Spain  is 035, England 008, Italy 020, Germany 014, France 013, Portugal
029,  Holland  025...  072  is the original Custom Teams file, and the National
teams are 080-085: The European ones are in 080.

*  And  another  thing...  the  editor has a 'secret' option that is toggled by
pressing  HELP.  Once  activated, when editing data, they get in/decreased much
faster... 'useful' when putting random values in or... oh, ok, it has NO use ;)
Also, this removes the 16 numeric limit for shirt numbers, so you can e.g. give
a player number 69 ;), but the game is not ready for this so you probably won't
see the numbers or something worse. Your risk...

@node BERRI "Ni!"

SWOSFFF 2.3 - SMALL BUT IMPORTANT UPDATE: PLEASE READ THIS!

Both  before  and  after releasing SWOSFFF into the world, I received thousands
(ok,  maybe  not  thousands but a lot anyway :P) of mails asking about a common
problem:  Edited  data  files seem to like crashing the game from time to time,
usually at the end of a career season.

So,  I  spent  some time doing a bit more research into the SWOS team data file
format,  and found something interesting: How ALL the players in the data files
are  made  following some special rules relative to their price and skills, and
that SHOULD be followed when making team edits/updates:

First  of  all,  I'll explain that among some other data, each player has seven
skills,  valued  from  0 to 15, and a number (between 0 and 49) that represents
his value; this number is not proportional to the value in pounds, i.e. the one
you  see  while playing SWOS, but each number represents a different cash value
taken  from a list, being 0 the cheapest (25K) and 49 the most expensive (15M).
SWOSFFF,   as   all  other  editors,  handles  this  number<->value  conversion
internally  so  you  only see the cash value, but you can see that you can only
select some specific values, that is, the ones on the list...

A  player  can 'have' a certain skill or not. A player 'has' a particular skill
(i.e.  he's  good at it) when his 0-15 rating at that skill is 8 or higher.
You  can  see  that when, while playing, you search for players in the transfer
list: if you look for players with 'passing' and a certain player appears, that
means he has 8 or more points at passing. If he doesn't, then he has 7 or less.

Well,  the thing works like this: a player starts with a rating of 8 in all the
skills he 'has', and 0 in the rest. Then, for each 'value point' he has above 0
(15M  would  mean the maximum, 49 points), an extra skill point is allocated to
any  of  his  skills,  to a maximum of 7 (i.e. a skill rating of 7 or 15) extra
points  per  skill.  This is what makes a 'balanced' player; ALL the players in
SWOS  follow  this  rule and that's why they don't look too different from each
other  (though one player can still be better than another with the same value,
because  he  can  'have'  more  skills...).  The  only  exception  to  this are
goalkeepers, which should always have all skill ratings at 0 (so, sorry, no
Chilavert's, Campos, Molinas or Van der Sar's ;))

And so, this version of SWOSFFF helps you make 'compatible' players thanks to a
coefficient  that  appears  on  the  edit  screen, at the right of each player.
Balanced players will have 0, overpriced players will have negative values, and
underpriced ones will have positive values.

'UH?',  I  hear  you  cry.  Maybe  you didn't understand anything of the avobe,
didn't  bother  reading  it or simply want me to explain it in a simpler way...
OK, here it is :)

IN THE EDIT SCREEN, YOU WILL FIND A NUMBER AT THE RIGHT OF EACH PLAYER.
WELL, MAKE SURE THIS NUMBER IS 0 IN ALL CASES.

You can do this by altering their skills and value.

Ok, and what's the point on mantaining this compatibility?
I've been making and trying some 'balanced' updates, and found that...

- Balanced data NEVER crashes the game.
- Balanced  data  is  usually  much better,  and much more sensible ;) than the
usual,  chaotic  updates. No strange performances - no players that just aren't
as  fast,  as  slow,  or as anything else as you expected when you put in their
values  (Ever  noticed that a defender with, say, 11 speed almost flies while a
winger  with  the  same  value  is  virtually useless? Please, make some decent
updates!),  no  prices that surprisingly rise or fall despite the player's real
performance... I guess you get the idea.

Therefore  I  encourage  all programmers of SWOS data editors (Hi Piotr! :)) to
include  a  similar  feature  in their programs, as I think it would help us to
make really good, compatible, non-problematic updates.
Believe me, it even makes editing easier :)

Greetings to every SWOS fan in the world,

Aitor (Aitortxu) Garcia
