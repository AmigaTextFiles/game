 - Introduction:

  UfoEd is a saved game editor for the game Ufo The Enemy Unknown (X-Com).
  I only made Ufoed for my own use, to learn programming on the Amiga. I have
  not tested the program on another system so i don't know how it will 
  perform on other configurations. There are some bugs that I'm aware of, 
  but it works satisfying for my use. Therefore i will not make a new version
  if no one ells is interested.
  
 - Requirement:

  Amiga, Power Supply ;), Monitor (TV) ;), Amiga OS 2.04+, 
  Ufo The Enemy Unknown, ASL and GadTools library. 

 - Installing:

  Simply drag the icon to a drawer of you're own choice.

 - What UfoEd expects of you:
  
  To have a save game directory, that X-Com has created for you.
  To get that, start a New X-Com game, build a few bases (you only need
  to place the access lift) then save the game and exit.

 - Starting UfoEd:

  Start it from the Workbench, by simply double clicking on the UfoEd 
  icon. You will then see a window with some disabled gadgets and a
  directory requester will appear. Select the directory were the save game
  files are placed.(UfoEd can only edit existing soldiers and bases, it
  can't create new ones for you.)

 - Gadgets:
 
   Soldier/Base      - Switch between soldier and base editor.
   Found             - Change the amount of money in the game.
   </>               - Scrolls between the soldiers/bases.
   'name'            - Shows the soldiers/base name.
   Elit Soldiers     - Flying suit + 110 in bravery and 180 in every thing else.
   Rank              - Changes the rank of the soldier.
   Missions          - Changes missions the soldier been on.
   Armour             - Change the armour on the soldier.

   Time Unit         - Changes how the soldier will act the turn.
   Stamina           - Changes the Stamina of the soldier.
   Health            - Changes the Health of the soldier.
   Bravery           - Changes Bravery (I haven't figured this one out yet, 
                       so just set it to 0, and you will get 110 in bravery.)

                       (UfoEd will not check if you have enough of free space)
   'Base structure'  - Lets you delete, edit the time to build or place a new
                       building at the base.

 - Version History:
  
  1.0: First and maybe, only release.
     
  Bugs: If you flip the soldier/base gadget to fast several times the 
         program crashes. Doesn't return all memory reserved. Calculation
         of bravery does not work as it should (set it to 0 to get 110).
