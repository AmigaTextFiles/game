This program allows you to change various settings in your F1GP saved games.
Whereas F1GP-Ed is an excellent utility, it doesn't as yet provide a way of
editing Saved Games.  This program will allow you to change the following
settings:-

· The result of every race in the season so far

· The name of every driver, and also which driver is a computer/human
  driver

· The names of every Team, and also their Engine names.  You can also
  change which driver drives for them.

· The Race details, such as laptimes, qualifying tyres used, and the type
  of session (Free Practice/Qualifying/Race etc.)

· The Standard Options as found in the game such as the Length of the race,
  the Opposition Standard, and everything else found in the Race and Help
  Options menus.

· The Car Setups

The following tools were used in the coding of this program:-

AMOS Professional V2.00 - To code the F1GP-SaveEd executable

CygnusEd Pro V3.5       - Used to write this guide file, and the
                          startup-sequence

Heddley V1.1            - Used to edit this AmigaGuide file

race will have its name in a @{fg shine}different colour@{fg text} to the rest, which means that
it is the next race to be run in the calender.

Below this is a column of buttons used to preform certain tasks on the
Season data.  Below this you will see a window labelled @{fg shine}Non-Finishers@{fg text}, which
as the name suggests lists all the drivers which didn't finish the race, or

@{fg shine}F1GP-Ed@{fg text} is an excellent utility that will allow you to customize your copy
of F1GP to beyond recognition.  You can change virtually every aspect of the
game.  For instance, in my copy, I have changed the data to the latest
season data instead of the original 1991 season data.  The Cars now go much
faster.  You can change the colours of the cars, the drivers' helmets and
even the pit engineer's clothes!

The cockpit graphics can be completely changed.  Everything down to the
positions of all of the different lights, and even the start lights at the
start of the race can be changed.  I have changed mine to show five red
lights that then go out, just like in real life.

You can also change the background pictures.  I now have photo quality
pictures in the background instead of the cartoony ones of the original.

Anyway, enough selling.  You can get a hold of @{fg shine}F1GP-Ed@{fg text} from the author,
Oliver Roberts at the following website:-

@node "Future" "Future"

                                   @{b}FUTURE@{ub}

Here is a list of things I strive to have put into the next version of
F1GP-SaveEd:-

· Localise the program - This shouldn't be too difficult to do.  The only
                         tricky thing is writing the catalogs...

· Convert Save Games   - I want to be able to convert mid-race save games
                         to end-of-race save games.  This is quite easy,
                         and so should be in the next version of
                         F1GP-SaveEd.

· Select Wet/Dry Race  - Somewhere in the save game is a variable which
                         determines whether the session is wet or dry.
                         As soon as I find it, this function will be
                         implemented.

· Use Intuition        - I hate using AMOSPro for my programs, but I am
                         currently learning C at university, so hopefully I
                         will be able to write a version in that!

If you can think of other ways of improving F1GP-SaveEd, then don't hesitate
to write to me and suggest it.  You can find my address in the
@{"About The Author" link "Author" 0} section of the program.

You can get the latest version of F1GP-SaveEd from several sources. They
are:-

@{b}The Amiga Formula One Website@{ub}

This is an excellent website full of everything that Amiga F1 fans could
possibly want.  It is run by Oliver Roberts, the programmer of F1GP-Ed.  You
can also pick up latest versions of other F1GP utilities on this site also.
The URL is:-

http://www.nanunanu.org/~oliver/AmigaF1.html

@{b}The Players Formula One Website@{ub}

This is the website of my F1 team, and they will have the latest version.
The URL is:-

http://www.execulink.com/~wilcox/F1/F1Amiga.html

@{b}Aminet@{ub}

You can get F1GP-SaveEd at the following location on the Aminet:-

game/misc/F1GP-SaveEd.lha

@{b}F1GP Accessories Disk@{ub}

This is a disk jam-packed full of useful F1GP utilities, and is perfect if
you don't have Internet access.  You can get this disk from Oliver Roberts
at:-

 Oliver Roberts
 30 Tillett Road
 Norwich
 NR3 4BJ

Remember to send him a blank floppy disk and an SAE.

@{b}Direct from the Author@{ub}

You can get the latest version of F1GP-SaveEd direct from me.  This is the
best way to ensure you are getting the latest version, because it could take
a few days for the sources above to get the latest version, whereas I
obviously always have the latest version straight away!!

Be sure to send me a blank disk, and an SAE.  You could send me a £1 coin if
you don't have any disks, but make sure you sellotape it to a piece of card,
otherwise it may go missing in the post!  Please do not send me any cheques
at all.

You could always Email me of course!!
