 Welcome to the Alien Breed 3D II - TKG Save Game Editor, as you have
probably already guessed this program allows you to edit the saved game
data used in Alien Breed 3D II - TKG.

 With the editor you are able to alter the following parameters;

 · Playing level
 · Players health
 · Players weapons
 · Weapon ammunition
 · Whether player has the jetpac

 Note : Team 17 have been rather sneaky with the way that the save game
data works, when you choose the load game option you have the choice of
five game slots and a `New Game' option, this `New Game' option is actually
game slot 0!  As such with the editor you are also able to change this,
however when Alien Breed 3D II - TKG first loads it does not use this `New
Game' to set up the defaults, so you will have to load it in for it to take
effect.

 @{b}TKG1: Path@{ub}

 Use the string gadget to type in the path to the tkg1: assign, or location
of the `boot.dat' file.  Or use the `?' gadget to select a path using a
requester.  (Note, tkg1: is the default path, even if it does not exist!)

 If the string gadget is empty the `Load' and `Save' gadgets will be
ghosted.

 @{b}Playing Level@{ub}

 This cycle gadget denotes the level that the save game will start on, this
currently only supports levels `A-P' not having tried the level editors I
am unsure whether you can create levels past `P'.

 @{b}Game Slots@{ub}

 Select a game slot to edit, once selected the gadgets will be updated with
that slots data.

 @{b}Weapons@{ub}

 Click the checkboxes to select which weapons the player is to have, once a
weapon is selected you will be able to alter the ammunition for that weapon.
(Note, Shotgun is always selected!)

 @{b}Health@{ub}

 Move the scroll bar to alter the amount of health the player will have
from 0-10000.  (Note, if you choose `0' the player will start off dead!)

 @{b}Options@{ub}

  Load - This loads the `boot.dat' file from the selected path.
  Save - This saves the `boot.dat' file to the selected path.
 About - This displays information about the editor.

 @{b}Ammunition@{ub}

 Move the scroll bars to alter the amount of ammunition for each weapon the
player will have from 0-10000.  (Note, during the game `Laser' and
`MegaLaser' both use the same ammunition therefore there is only one scroll
bar.  This is also the same for `Single-Plasma' and `Multi-Plasma'.)

 Version   Date         Comments

 1.0       10.08.1996   ·First public release.

 1.1       11.08.1996   ·Fixed a major bug that stopped the jetpac being
                         detected and enabled if it had been used during a
                         game.
                        ·Released on Amiga Format cover disk AF90b.

 1.15      19.08.1996   ·Uses a new method of determining whether
                         reqtools.library exists, so as not opening the
                         library twice and so saving memory and creating a
                         smaller executable.
                        ·Added keyboard shortcuts to Load, Save and About
                         buttons.

 1.16      16.10.1996   ·Fixed a bug with the rendering of the GUI using a
                         font other than topaz 8 as a screen font.
