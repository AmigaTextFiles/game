Inga Engine Versions

There are three versions of the Inga engine:

"Inga.exe" is the classic version. It uses Intuition
double buffering and has good speed for old machines,
but makes problems with UAE and AmigaOS4 (maybe MorphOS, too).

"IngaX.exe" uses a simple double buffering method with
bitmap copying. It's slow on classic machines, but runs
extremely smooth on UAE and AmigaOS4 (maybe MorphOS).

"IngaOS4.exe" is like "IngaX.exe", but compiled for AmigaOS4/PPC.
It uses "IngaSoundOS4" except of "IngaSound".
