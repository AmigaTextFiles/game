                        ======================
            (Kingdom is (C) 1996 Dave Marsupial Alderson)


    1. Introduction

A couple of weeks ago, I downloaded the game Kingdom (by Dave Alderson) from
AmiNet. I tried it, and saw it was good. Then, I decided to play around with
the board files. I soon found out the structure of the files.
  As a matter of fact, what surprised me is that Dave had programmed the way
that the pieces depend on the bytes in the file to be quite logical, yet
jumbled somewhat. If this is an attempt of encryption on Dave's part, why did
he stop there? Surely he could have done a XOR'ing with a randomly-selected
series of bytes, like Selwyn Stevens (author of Croak 2) did. And if it isn't,
why didn't he just do a normal "1 byte equals 1 piece" array? This puzzles me.
  Anyway, I decided to make an editor program for these files, just to show
Dave to be more careful when saving his data in the future. Oh, and of course
to add to your Kingdom-playing pleasure as well.
  Notice that this editor is in no way connected to the official Kingdom board
editor by Dave Alderson. So this is not a pirate distribution, but entirely
legal, I think.


    2. Using the Editor

As soon as you start the program, you will notice that it has been written in
AMOS. There, that will keep monsieur Lionet happy.
  Anyway, what you will see is a 19*19 square board, a selection of 16 Kingdom
pieces, and a lot of buttons. I will now tell you what all these buttons do.
  Notice that if the program displays "(Y/N)" in the message area, you actually
have to press Y or N. So your machine hasn't crashed yet.


    3. Drawing on the board

To actually put something on a board, first select your pieces from the piece
selection grid in the top right corner. Notice that you can use both mouse
buttons, just like in DPaint. The last piece, which looks like a cross between
a King and a Rook, is a Castle. In Kingdom, Rooks and Castles look the same. In
this program, they don't.
  Then select your drawing instrument, and click on the board. With some
instruments, you have to click twice before you see the changes: once for the
start, and once for the destination.
  The Auto-Reflect toggle will, when activated, automatically make sure that
every piece you put on the board is mirrored on the opposing side of the board.
This is handy when you are making a symmetrical board.
  I will document the rest of the buttons in the next chapters.


    4. Saving and loading

The save and load buttons do just that. Surprise, surprise. You will be
presented with a file requester, so just select the file you want. The program
will then save/load a Kingdom board file according to Dave's file format.
  If you are loading a file, make sure it exists, of course. And if you are
saving a file, take care when overwriting a file. The program will ask you for
confirmation if you save a file that already exists.
  Oh yeah, and the filenames should always end with ".kdb".


    5. Checking Kings, Credits and Quitting

Dave has been a bit strict when it comes to dealing with Kings and Castles on
the board. Each side must have one, and only one, King or Castle.
  So if you have lost count of the Kings/Castles on board, just press Check
Kings. The program will go through the board, checking the amount of Kings and
Castles on either side. And if it finds more than one, it will even remove the
rest for you. Handy, isn't it?
  The Credits button will display the program's credits, and the quit button
will... erm... quit.


    6. Last words

I know I'm robbing Dave's bread by programming and distributing an editor for
Kingdom board files, so Dave won't get so much money from his official editor.
So to make amends, I hereby give Dave Megalomania Alderson full rights to make
any editors for my (JIPsoft's) games, and charge as much money as he likes for
them.
  This offer also concerns Christian Mumenthaler (author of Colonial Conquest
II), but it doesn't concern anybody other people than me, Dave and Christian.
So if you are one of the 4'999'999'997 people that are not any of us three, you
are not allowed to make editors for my games. So there.
  Well anyway, I think it's time I mentioned my address and went home. My
address is:

        Joona Palaste
        Toppelundintie 3B 19
        02170 Espoo
        Finland
    and if you want to E-mail me, you can do so at: jopalast@freenet.hut.fi.
I won't include Dave's address. To see that, look at the official Kingdom
documentation.
