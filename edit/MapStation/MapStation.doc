                               MAP-STATION V1.01 DOCUMENTATION
                               -------------------------------
-------------------
-- Starting note --
-------------------

   This is the complete documentation for the program.  A simple on-line
help is available within the program by pressing [HELP] on the keyboard.
This help is available at all times except when a file requester or the
icon bar is displayed.

-----------------------------
-- Purpose of this program --
-----------------------------

   This program is a game level-map editor which I have produced to aid me
in designing the levels for a game I am currently in the process of
developing in assembly language.  
   The way a level is made up is out of a collection of graphical
blocks which can vary in size (usually 16x16 or 32x32 pixels).  When the
blocks are originally created within a paint program they are drawn so that
they will fit together to make larger objects.  If done properly a level of
a game can take up considerably less memory than having the level made out of
one big picture (which if the level was of a reasonable size would be
larger than available memory as a single 320*256 32 colour screen eats up
over 50k alone) and can look just as good.
    Without a map editor it can be a real chore designing a level in any
programming language because the block numbers have to be typed in by hand as
data statements (BASIC), dc statements (ASSEMBLY) etc.  This can be a
laborious process especially if the level is quite big and also you don`t
instantly know what the level is going to look like.
    A map editor allows you to select a block from the amount available and
using the mouse paste it onto the level map at any position.  This way you
can see straight away what the level is going to look like when it is in
the actual game and any mistakes can be corrected or changes can easily be 
made.  As more blocks are drawn they can easily be added to the list available
for use within the level.


--------------------------
-- Usage of the program --
--------------------------

   This editor can be controlled using a combination of icons and keyboard
presses.  Some functions are available using both while others are only
available using one or the other.  The map editor has four separate modes
which have their own screen and some functions are only selectable when on
the particular screen related to the function. The four modes are:


Block cut - Used for cutting blocks from an IFF picture

Block select - Used for selecting which block to paste onto the map

Block edit - Used for editing existing blocks and making new blocks

Map edit - Used for pasting blocks onto the map and removing blocks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
N.B. Save functions in the unregistered version are de-activated.  The
     unregistered version is merely so that you can get a feel of the 
     program and see what you think of it.  For details on how to register
     see the bottom of this doc.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The menu is activated by moving the mouse to the top of the screen and
pressing the right mouse button.  The menu bar will then glide to the top
of the screen and an option can be selected or you can remove the menu (by
pressing the right mouse button again - with the mouse at the top of the
screen).  At this point the menu will then glide off the bottom of the
screen.

The menu options are:

Row one
-------

1.  IFF load - Loads an iff picture for cutting blocks from (only in Block
    cut mode).
2.  Map load - Loads a new map into the editor.
3.  Map save - Saves the current map.
4.  Block save - Saves the block data to an IFF file.
5.  Block load - Loads the block data from an IFF file (only in Block
    select mode).
6.  Block delete - Deletes all blocks from memory.
7.  Map clear - Clears the current map from memory.
8.  Block Merge - Merges two blocks together (only in Block select mode).
9.  Map dimensions - Sets the width and height of the map (only in Block
    edit mode).
10. Exits the program (Also with [ESCAPE] key).


Row two
-------

1.  Enter Block select mode and screen.   (Also with [S] key/F2)
2.  Enter Block cut mode and screen.      (Also with [C] key/F1)
3.  Enter Block edit mode and screen.     (Also with [E] key/F3)
4.  Enter map edit mode and screen.       (Also with [M] key/F4)
5.  Grab the block which is locked onto.  (Also with [G] key)
6.  Flips block horizontally (only in Block edit mode) (Also with [X] key).
7.  Flips block vertically (only in block edit mode) (Also with [Y] key).
8.  Insert block onto block screen (only in block edit mode).
9.  Replace block with original (only in block edit mode).
10. Clear block from editing area (only in block edit mode). 

   The various modes will now be explained in detail along with the various
functions available in that mode.


Block cut mode
--------------

Load IFF - Select the "Load IFF" icon (Row 1, Column 1) to load an IFF
           picture from which to cut blocks from.

Cut Block - The block to be cut out is outlined using a 16x16 box which is
moved around with the mouse.  The left mouse button is then pressed to lock the
box onto the block.  To grab the block either call up the menu and click the
"Store" icon (Row 2, Column 5) or press the [G]rab key.  The display will then
momentarily flip to the Block select screen where you store the block by
clicking with the left mouse button on the place you want it to go.  After
this has been done you will return to the Block cut screen.  To release the
box again press the space bar.


Block select mode
-----------------

Load Blocks - Select the "Load Blocks" icon (Row 1, Column 5) and then
              select the name of the block screen to load using a file
              requester.

Save Blocks - Select the "Save Blocks" icon (Row 1, Column 4) and select
              the name of the block screen to save using a file requester.

Delete Blocks - Select the "Delete Blocks" icon (Row 1, Column 6).

Merge 2 blocks - Select the Merge Blocks" icon (Row 1, Column 8) and click
                the left mouse button on the block to use as the background
                and the right mouse button on the block to use as the
                foreground the click the left mouse button on the place to
                store the block.

		N.B Any pixels with are set to the background colour
                    (colour 0) on the foreground block will show through
                    the background block.

Select block for map - Click the left mouse button on a block.

Select block for edit - Click the right mouse button on a block.

Grab block from edit screen - Press F9

Block edit mode
---------------

Plot a pixel - Position the mouse pointer on the place you require in the
               expanded box and click the left mouse button.

Clear a pixel - Position the mouse pointer on the place you require in the
                expanded box and click the right mouse button.

Area fill - Position the mouse pointer on the area to fill and press
            [Space].
          
Change map dimensions - Select the "Map Dimensions" icon (Row 1, Column 9)
                        then type in the map width and press and then the map
                        height and press [Return].  The current map will then
                        be cleared and the new map size will be set.
			N.B.  If the size you specify for the map exceeds
                              the amount of available chip or fast memory
                              then you will need to re-enter the map
                              dimensions.

Flip block horizontally - Select "Flip-X" icon (Row 2, Column 6) or press
                          [X] on the keyboard.

Flip block vertically - Select "Flip-Y" icon (Row 2, Column 7) or press [Y]
			on the keyboard.

Insert block - Select the "Insert Block" icon (Row 2, Column 8).  The Block
               select screen will be displayed where you click the left mouse
	       button on the position to insert the block after which you return
               to the Block edit screen.

Replace block - Select the "Replace Block" icon (Row 2, Column 9).  The block in
                the edit window will then replace the original.

Clear block - Select the "Clear Block" icon (Row 2, Column 10).  The edit window
	      will then be cleared.  This function doesn't affect the actual 
              block data - to actually clear the block perform a replace after
              this function (See previous function).

Change current ink colour - This decides which colour to fill or plot a
                            pixel with.  To change the colour click the
                            left mouse button on one of the 32 different colour
                            boxes at the bottom of the screen.  To show
                            which colour is currently selected there is 
                            a bar going across the top of the colour boxes.

Change a colour in the palette - Select a colour to change and then alter
                                 the Red, Green and Blue values adjusting the 3
                                 slider bars on the screen until the desired
                                 colour is obtained.


Map edit mode
-------------

Load a new map - Select the "Load Map" icon (Row 1, Column 2) and then
                 select the name of the map to load using the file
                 requester.  The map will be loaded and the size of the map
                 will be taken from the 8 byte header.

Save current map - Select the "Save Map" icon (Row 1, Column 3) and then
                   select the name of the map to save using the file 
                   requester.  The map will be saved along with an 8 byte
                   header which contains the height and width of the map.

Clear current map - Select the "Clear Map" icon (Row 1, Column 7) and the
                    map will then be erased from the screen and memory.
                    The map will also be cleared if you change its size
                    (See above).

Paste a block - Move the mouse pointer to the desired position and press
                the left button.

Clear a block - Move the mouse pointer to the desired position and press
                the right button.

Pick up a block to use from the map - Move the mouse pointer to the desired
                                      block and then press the space bar.
                                      The block under the mouse will then
                                      become the current block.

Scroll map right - If the size of the map allows it and you are not at the
                   right-most position press the right cursor key and the
                   map will scroll 1 block right.

Scroll map left - If the size of the map allows it and you are not at the
                  left-most position press the left cursor key and the
                  map will scroll 1 block left.

Scroll map down - If the size of the map allows it and you are not at the
                  down-most position press the down cursor key and the
                  map will scroll 1 block down.

Scroll map up - If the size of the map allows it and you are not at the
                up-most position press the up cursor key and the
                map will scroll 1 block up.

Set status bits at map pos - Move mouse to required block on map and press
(See next section)           keys [1] - [7] on main keyboard.  That block
                             will then be outlined and the status bit will
                             be set. 

Clear all status bits from map pos - Move mouse to required position and press
(See next section)                   [DEL] on the keyboard.  All outlines and
                                     status bits will be cleared.

See status bits set on block - Move mouse to required block.  The state
(See next section)             (0/1) of the 7 available bits will be shown
                               on the bar at the top of the screen (next to 
                               screen x and y positions).

Map data memory layout
----------------------

The first longword (2 words/4 bytes) of the map contain the width of the
map in blocks and the second longword contains the height of the map in
blocks.  

Straight after this follows the map data.  Each block number takes up a
word (2 bytes) of memory to allow for a maximum of 65536 possible blocks.
As you can imagine this is far more than the amount of blocks needed for a
level (you couldn't fit that many blocks in memory) so to make use of the
wasted bits in each word the 7 upper bits are used as status bits for 
evaluation for the programmer.  These bits are bits 15-9 of the word.  You
can use them for anything you wish such as collision status bits, danger
zones etc. Just remember to mask out these bits when you are evaluating the
block number at a particular map position.

The map data is laid out as follows:

word 1 - 1st block vertically
word 2 - 2nd block vertically
word 3 - 3rd block vertically
.....

word 1 + (MapHeight*2) - 2nd block horizontally
.....etc.

Therefore -

* To get to the next block right add [mapheight*2] bytes to the map pointer.
* To get to the next block left sub [mapheight*2] bytes from the map pointer.
* To get to the next block down add 2 bytes to the map pointer.
* To get to the next block up sub 2 bytes from the map pointer.
