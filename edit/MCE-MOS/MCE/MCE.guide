@{b}General notes and warnings@{ub}

It is suggested that you make a backup of (the unedited versions of) your
files before using the editor.
  If you want to save the changes you have made, you must do so explicitly
(eg. via the toolbar or menu). You are not warned about unsaved files
before the editor quits.
  It is not necessarily safe to set certain attributes to the maximum
allowed by the editor, as not every attribute has been exhaustively tested
for its allowable range. Also, the editor will allow you to set eg. your
current hit points to be higher than your maximum hit points, but doing
this is not recommended.
  Maximization buttons will not necessarily take every attribute to the
very highest value possible, to leave some headroom before attributes
overflow.
  Although the editor will let you load and save files with very long
filenames, the game(s) may have limitations on the maximum filename length
which might make it impossible to load such files into the game(s).
  Different game versions might use different file formats which may not
be compatible with the editor. Generally, where a WHDLoad slave is
available for a game, the editor is intended for use with that slave and
might not be intended for use with the floppy version. If the WHDLoad uses
Disk.1, Disk.2, etc. you may have to extract the relevant files from the
relevant disk image (generally the last (highest-numbered) disk of multi-
disk games is used for saved games).
  ADZs and ZIPped ADFs are not writable by WinUAE, so you should use (non-
write protected) ADFs instead of those.
  Files which you have previously hacked by hand might not be safe to load
into the game and/or editor.
  High score tables are generally automatically sorted for you before they
are saved.
  There are example vanilla saves for most games (all except Barbarian 2,
Beyond Dark Castle, Dragons of Flame, Garrison 1 & 2, Goal!, Grand Monster
Slam, Insanity Fight, Last Ninja Remix and Shadoworlds) provided in the
Examples/ directory, so that you can easily browse the capabilities of the
editor.
  While a subwindow is open, the main window cannot be used.
  Read the specific help node, if any, in this user manual, for your
particular game before doing any editing.
  The mouse wheel and/or cursor keys can generally be used to manipulate
listbrowsers and maps. You should ensure that no string or integer gadget
is activated (eg. by clicking in an empty part of the window), and
position the pointer over the gadget you want to manipulate. The numeric
keys can be used to manipulate maps.
  Extreme values might cause the game to have minor cosmetic (ie.
graphical) problems, such as misaligning of certain text (although this
should not cause any major problems). In other cases, the editor might be
somewhat more limiting of certain fields than is strictly possible.
  You should press ENTER or Tab after editing string or integer gadgets to
ensure everything is correctly updated.
  Cursor keys to scroll tables, etc. will not work while a string or
integer gadget has the keyboard input focus.
  Information shown by the editor may include "spoilers".
  Generally, only files pertaining to the Amiga versions of games are
supported. (The Dungeon Master and King's Quest et al. editors are an
exception to this.)

@{b}Hardware@{ub}         Required        about 16Mb free RAM
                 Recommended     1024*768 or higher Workbench
@{b}Firmware@{ub}         Required        Kickstart 3.1+
@{b}Software@{ub}         Required        AmigaOS 3.9 with Boing Bag 2 (at least)
                 Recommended     AmigaOS 3.2+
                                 OpenURL.library (if OS < 4.1.1)
                                 TCP/IP stack
                                 AmigaOS Enhancer Software Core (clock.gadget)
                                 AmigaOS 4.1FE (for OS4 version)

If your resolution is lower than 1024*768, you will probably need to run
the program on an autoscrolling screen. You cn use the @{"PUBSCREEN" link Usag} CLI
argument or WB tooltype to do this.

Generally, images are not loaded into memory until they are needed;
however, once loaded they are retained in memory until the program quits
(for speed, in case they are needed again).

clock.gadget and sketchboard.gadget are optional but recommended. If you
don't have sketchboard.gadget (part of OS3.2 and OS4), the graphics
editing subwindows will not be available.

If you have the Amiga Image Storage System (AISS) installed, you can
delete the images/aiss/ subdirectory.

The program will open its own screen if it needs to because your desktop
is not large enough.
  If you don't have quite enough RAM to run MCE, you can email us to ask
for a custom single-game build of MCE, which will have lower memory
requirements due to the omission of support for the other games. Although
these days just expanding your RAM is probably a better idea ;-)

For MorphOS users:

You need the appropriate ReAction classes installed. You can get these
classes from OS3.9 BB2 or (preferably) OS3.2.

For AmigaOS 4 users:

OS4.1FE is recommended so that you get BOOPSI menus (with imagery). The
BOOPSI menu subsystem assumes you have AISS installed (it is part of a
standard OS4.1FE install). The utility uses the MenuImageSize environment
variable when starting up to determine what size to make the menu imagery.
If this variable is is not present, the default is 16 pixels square. If
this variable is 0, menu imagery is not loaded nor shown.

    pubscreen=<pubscreen>:
           the name of a public screen to open on (otherwise the default
           public screen is used). If this screen does not exist, MCE
           will create it as an autoscrolling screen with dimensions
           determined by the SCREENWIDTH and SCREENHEIGHT CLI arguments.

    screenwidth=<width>:
           minimum width to use when opening a new screen (defaults to

           minimum height to use when opening a new screen (defaults to
           768).

    test:
           this will cause the program to load the appropriate example
           file automatically. Eg. MCE 1 TEST will cause the program to
           start the Arazok's Tomb editor with its example file
           (PROGDIR:Examples/ArazoksTomb/ArazoksTomb.GAM) already loaded.

@node ArazoksTomb "Arazok's Tomb"

You *must* use the .GAM extension. Naming your saved game START.GAM is
probably unwise as it won't be listed by the game, and therefore you
won't be able to load it into the game.
  The .GAM file (eg. ArazoksTomb.GAM) is what is edited.
  The TOMBS file is used by the game to store the list of saved games.
If your saved game file is not listed in the TOMBS file, it will not be
shown by the game's "Project|Open..." file requester and thus you will not
be able to load it into the game.
  If the TOMBS file is present in the same directory as the .GAM file, it
will be updated automagically by the editor when saving.
  Saved games, and indeed most of the game's important files, are saved in
the misleadingly-named Empty/ directory of the game's disk.

The WHDLoad slave (V2.0) of the game is assumed.
  Be cautious of adjusting the "Area" value. Some tested values within the
allowed range caused (harmless) graphics corruption.

Some in-game tips:
  To load a game, press "L" at the title screen (the one with the credits)
and then choose a slot number.
  To save a game, press "S" during play and then choose a slot number.

@{b}Obliterator@{ub}

The WHDLoad slave (V1.2) of the game is assumed.
  Note that only the FNIAA file is edited. The other ???AA files are

contain anything relevant to MCE and should not be loaded into the editor.

Some in-game tips:
  To load a game, press Help, F1, Y, then any key.
  There are two ways to save a game:
  a) go to a shield regenerator (there are 4 of them in the game), click
     the "Enter" icon to walk into it, then press Y when asked about

@node BardsTale "Bard's Tale 1-3 & Construction Set"

The program autodetects the type of file being opened. You can edit
character files (BT1 and BT2), roster files (a group of characters) (BT3
and BTCS), items files (BT1 and BT2), and saved games (BT3).
  For BT3 (at least), when playing the game, it is helpful to slow down
the CPU (eg. via WinUAE settings), to avoid excessive amounts of wandering
monster encounters.

Character/roster files:

The program allows considerable freedom to make alterations to the
characters; thus, discretion is advised. Don't forget to save your
character before quitting the program if you want to keep the changes
you have made.
  The checkboxes indicate whether the relevant item is "equipped" or not.
Next to each checkbox is an integer gadget which stores the quantity of
that item. 255 is a magic number meaning "unlimited". Clicking an item
slot will bring up a subwindow allowing you to change which item
is stored in that slot. If a particular item is not available in that
game, it will be shown in white.
  Values which can't be displayed by the game, eg. ST of 100 or more, are
shown in the game as asterisks (eg. "**"), "WOW", or similar. They still
work normally even if displayed in this manner.

Items files (BT1 and BT2 only):

The ITEMS file stores the list of what is sold by Garth's Equipment
Shoppe, the ledger of bank accounts (BT2 only) and the party's current
location (BT2 only), and some other unknown data (BT2 only).
  In the shoppe, 255 is a magic number meaning "unlimited".
  "Reset to defaults" will clear the ITEMS file to the factory default
state. For BT2, this includes setting the unknown area to the known
factory default values. This is the only situation in which MCE will
change the unknown area.

@{b}BT1@{ub}

The character (TPW.#?.C) or ITEMS file is what is edited.

@{b}BT2@{ub}

Images are used only for monsters/illusions.
Items can be carried by anyone.
The character (TPW.#?.C), ITEMS or game.save file is what is edited.

The current WHDLoad slave (V1.01) has some bugs that need these
once-only workarounds (assuming you are in the BardsTale2 directory):

    TYPE NIL: data/members/game.save ;(so you can save games)
    MAKEDIR data/membersbt           ;(so you can transfer BT1 characters)

Saved game files:

It is not currently possible to teleport from outside (wilderness/cities)
to a dungeon, or vice versa, nor to teleport from one dungeon to another
(nor from one level to another within the same dungeon). You can freely
change your outdoor location (including teleporting to/from any city or
the wilderness, and can change your dungeon location within the same
dungeon level.
  If you are in a dungeon, you can view and edit the dungeon name; this
only affects what is shown under the 3D view area in the game.

@{b}BT3@{ub}

Images are used for everyone.
Items can be carried only by players.
The THIEVES.INF or game.sav file is what is edited.
On the maps, blue squares/lines are special (eg. traps, teleports, items,
etc.). Not all special squares/lines are indicated. Up and down arrows
indicate stairs or an equivalent thereof. Grey squares are in darkness.
Hollow circles are boulders (which are passable on eg. the Amiga version
but impassable on eg. the Commodore 64 version). Your location and facing
direction is indicated by the white arrow. The coordinates used in the
editor are always stated as an offset east (E) and north (N) from the
bottom left corner of the map. In the game, they are often not stated in
this manner (instead being relative to eg. the entrance to the level).

@{b}BTCS@{ub}

Images are not used for anyone.
Items can be carried by anyone.
The ROSTER.CHR file is what is edited.
The sample scenario (Starlight Festival) is assumed, as far as items are
concerned.

@node Bloodwych "Bloodwych & Extended Levels"

@node BombJack "Bomb Jack 1"

This editor has been tested with V1.0 and V1.1 of the WHDLoad slave. It
will only handle uncompressed files; note that the "bj" and "platform.set"
files included with most distributions of V1.1 of the installed WHDLoad
slave are compressed. The ones provided in the Examples/BombJack1/
directory are uncompressed.
  "bj" is the main file that is edited (ie. the file you should specify
when loading or saving). However, "platform.set" is also loaded and thus
must also be present in its correct location.
  Levels 16-30 are always identical in all respects to levels 1-15
respectively (and thus are not separately editable).
  The right border of the playfield can have platforms over it; this is
not a bug in the editor.
  The darker red colour will colour-cycle in the game.
  The selected tile in the "Tiles" gadget will be outlined in black.
  The graphics used by the tiles can also be edited. This requires OS3.2+
or OS4 (for sketchboard.gadget), and exclusive access to 16 free pens. You
can either press the E key, click the "Edit Tile Graphics..." button, or
double-click a tile in the "Tiles" display.
  Editing of bombs is not currently supported.

warriors. The editor does not really enforce these rules but the game
does.
  Note that your actual armour class in the game is modified by low or

For Cannon Fodder 1, V2.0  or later of the WHDLoad slave is required.
  For Cannon Fodder 2, V1.12 or later of the WHDLoad slave is required.
  There doesn't seem to be any flag in the saved game file to indicate
whether it is for Cannon Fodder 1 or 2. You should set the "View/edit as"
gadget appropriately before or after loading the saved game.
  Kill counts can be up to 32767, but only the last 3 digits are shown by
the game.
  You can set the phase to anything you like, unlike in the game; ie. you
can begin part-way through a mission if you want.
  Setting the "Friendlies in reserve" gadget too high (in particular) can
cause the game to crash upon loading the saved game; therefore, you should
be @{i}very@{ui} careful when editing this.
  Having gaps in the middle of the heroes table or squad will probably
cause problems in-game.
  Filenames are supposed to be no more than 8 characters in length, and
composed of uppercase letters and/or numeric digits. Violating this rule
will cause the game's display of that filename to be corrupt, at least.
  Viewing and/or editing of graves is not currently supported.
  The number of men assigned to the squad for a particular phase seems to
be hard-coded by the game.
  Pressing the Help key during play will give 42 grenades and bazookas.
  There is a bug in the games: exceed 250 recruits and the recruitment
screen graphics will corrupt, causing a crash. If you play the game
untrained, there is no way you could reach this number anyway.

@node ChambersOfShaolin "Chambers of Shaolin"

This editor is designed for the WHDLoad version (V1.2 was tested). The

  There are many bugs in V1.0 and V1.1 of the WHDLoad slave; you should
use V1.2 (eg. pre-V1.2 slaves only support one character).
  However, pre-V1.2 rosters (16384 bytes) can still be loaded by
MCE; they are always saved in V1.2 format (16100 bytes).
  The "hidden" attributes are not displayed in-game. However, if these are
too low, some moves (eg. jump kick) may not be available. This applies at
least to the hidden #2-#4 values; the purpose of the hidden #1 value has
not been ascertained.

  For Dark Queen of Krynn, editing of spells is not currently supported

  Note that the game/hint/DQK_HexCodes.lha document on Aminet is
incorrect in some particulars and thus should not be relied upon.
@endnode

@node CitadelOfVras "Citadel of Vras"

The game detects attempts to alter certain fields and will quit in such
situations. Therefore those fields are read-only in the editor, for now at
least. You can freely teleport around, change your inventory, etc. Eg. you
can give yourself expensive items and then teleport to the shop
(coordinates X6,Y3,L1) to sell them.

In the map, special squares are shown in blue. The "Contents" gadget tells
more information about them. Walls are shown in black. Normal doors are
shown in green. Barriers between one square and the next (eg. walls of
fire, gaping holes, speaking doors) are shown in red. Your location and
facing direction is indicated by the white arrow.

The 'E,N' coordinate system is used in-game (eg. for the Location
power). The 'X,Y' coordinate system is used in MCE (eg. for ladder
destinations).

There is a HD-installed version of this game at
http://amigan.1emu.net/aw/ .

Notes for playing the game: You must press the spacebar at the title
screen. When asked for text (eg. when naming a newly created character),
you must click in the string gadget before typing. The game will not
allow you to adventure until you have five characters in the party.

@node Scrabble "Computer Scrabble Deluxe"

This game has several names, eg. "Computer Scrabble" (USA), "Computer
Scrabble Deluxe" (Europe). They are all basically the same and can all be
edited.
  The colours used by the editor match those used by the game. They are:

    Dark  green : empty ordinary square
    Light red   : empty double letter score
    Dark  blue  : empty triple letter score
    Light red   : empty double word score
    Dark  red   : empty triple word score
    Light yellow: square with a tile on it
                  Black text on light yellow are normal letters.
                  Blue  text on light yellow are wildcard (blank) letters.

In the "Pile" and "Rack" groups, the wildcard (blank) tiles are
represented by spaces.
  Unfortunately the game gets the square types for the board from an
internal table and thus ignores the square types that are stored in the
saved game file. Therefore, it isn't possible to change the number and
arrangement of bonus squares (triple word scores, etc.).

Amsterdam does not exist in the game (nor editor), even though the Dutch

  In the fifth scenario ("What If?"), Poland and Romania are neutral. The
game shows their armies as yellow but their cities as red in this
situation. The editor follows the same convention.
  Note that the game only allows loading and saving during the movement

Blank (empty) character and item names seem to indicate to the game that

  The checkboxes next to the item names are for whether the item is

are also loaded and thus must also be present in their correct locations.
  The "fgblocks", "bgblocks" and "template" files are ordinary IFF ILBMs
and thus can be edited in Deluxe Paint or similar paint programs.
  Transparent parts of foreground tiles are shown in grey on the tiles
toolbar. The background tile can be seen underneath these areas on the
map.
  The main levels are laid out by the game as follows (level6 is the
starting level):

                                      +-----+ +-----+

    |                    |
    +--------------------+

The bonus levels are reached by entering the lava in the northwest corner
of level0. They are laid out by the game as follows (level19 is the
starting bonus level):

    +-----+ +-----+ +-----+
    |     | |     | |     |
    | 19  +-+ 20  +-+ 18  |

            +-----+ +-----+ +-----+

See http://amigan.1emu.net/aw/#maps for maps of this game.
  Editing of exits and spells is not currently supported.
  The BG and FG indicators show the relevant background and/or foreground
codes, respectively, for the tile under the pointer. This can be useful
in distinguishing between tiles that are visually similar.
  You may need to alter the protection bits on the level file(s) before
you are able to overwrite them.
  Some special monster generator tiles ($13..$16 and $58) are used by the
game for special purposes. These cannot be edited. Also note that monsters
are only spawned if the foreground and/or background are appropriate for
that monster (eg. skeletons only spawn on bones).
  The palette used by the background and foreground tiles can also be
edited. This requires OS3.2+ or OS4 (for getcolor.gadget), and exclusive
access to 16 free pens. You can either press the P key or click the "Edit
Palette..." button. Monsters use a separate set of 16 colours which is not
editable.

@node DungeonMaster "Dungeon Master 1-2 & Chaos Strikes Back"

These are currently supported:

    DM1 saved games (dungeon & characters)
    CSB saved games (dungeon & characters)
    DM2 saved games (dungeon & characters)
    DM1 dungeons    (dungeon only)
    CSB dungeons    (dungeon only)
    DM2 dungeons    (dungeon only)

Mods to the DUNGEON.DAT file will only show up in a new game. After the
first save, your modified dungeon will become part of a new DMGAME.DAT
file. Existing DMGAME.DAT files use the DUNGEON.DAT file that existed when
that game was first saved.
  For dungeon files, the "Game" information may not be entirely accurate
as far as version or platform, but this will not cause any problems with
editing.
  Even non-Amiga files are supported (this is the only tool for which this
applies), though they have not been tested.

Character viewing/editing:

Not all items are necessarily known by the editor.
  Not every item that is known will necessarily work correctly in the
game; you may need to experiment to find the correct version of an item.
  Invalid items (shown as "!") will definitely not work.

Dungeon viewing/editing:

Chaos Strikes Back: The full (non-prison) dungeon is considered by the
game to be 11 levels (the 11th level is a single square); this is not a
bug in MCE.
  Dungeon Master 2: There is no "9th level"; this is not a bug in MCE.
  The leftmost (arrow) tool will move your party to any desired square.
  The eight central tools can be used to change squares to the desired
type. They will not change objects, stairs or doors.
  The rightmost (door) tool can be used to change doors. With this tool,
clicking on a door will cycle it through open, closed and broken states.
  The left and right cursor keys can be used to change levels.
@endnode

@node EyeOfTheBeholder "Eye of the Beholder 1 & 2"

Hover over an item slot to see what slot is (eg. "Head", "Neck", etc.)
  It is recommended not to edit the quiver, as it seems to be encoded
differently to the other fields. Putting things other than rings in
finger slots is also not recommended.
@endnode

@node Interceptor "F/A-18 Interceptor"

Some quantities can be set to higher values than what the game will show:
only the last 4 digits of most quantities are shown by the game.
@endnode

@node FaeryTaleAdventure "Faery Tale Adventure"

The outdoor map is shown at a 1:64 ratio (ie. 1 pixel on the editor map is
64 units as shown by the X and Y gadgets). Some edges of the outdoor map
(containing empty sea) are not shown. The indoor map is shown at a 1:32
ratio.
  The cursor (arrow) keys can be used to alter your location on the map,
with these qualifier keys:

    Ctrl   - move to edge
    Alt    - move by 10 editor pixels (320 or 640 units)
    (none) - move by  1 editor pixel  ( 32 or  64 units)
    Shift  - move by                            1 unit

Turning on the trainer allows these cheats during the game:

    ARROW KEYS____Move very fast over any terrain.
    'B'__________________________Summon gold swan.
    'R'___________________________Rescue princess.
    '='_______________________Display coordinates.
    'F9'________________Increase time by one hour.
    'F10'_________________Location in coordinates.

There are two ways to access the hint oracle:
  1. You can hover over a gadget to show the hint as a tooltip; or
  2. You can click on an image to show the hint in a requester. (The
pointer will change from yellow to red while hovering over the image if it
has a hint available.)
@endnode

@node SilentSoftware "Firepower & Turbo"

The graphics used by the tiles can also be edited. This requires OS3.2+
or OS4 (for sketchboard.gadget), and exclusive access to 32 free pens. You
can either press the E key, click the "Edit Tile Graphics..." button, or
double-click a tile in the "Tiles" display.

@{b}Firepower@{ub}

"T1", "T2", etc. (in the MapP1, MapP2 or MapP3 directory) is the main file
that is edited (ie. the file you should specify when loading or saving).
However, "tiles" (in the gr/ directory) is also loaded and thus must also
be present in its correct location.
  The selected tile in the "Tiles" gadget will be outlined. The outline
colours have these meanings:

    Black: ordinary tile.
    Red:   this tile cannot be placed on the map.
    Brown: brown version of this tile will be placed.
    Green: green version of this tile will be placed.

You can toggle between placing brown or green tiles by using the "Colour"
gadget.
  When editing graphics, the brown version of the tile is assumed. In the
game (and on the editor map), colours 28..31 will be replaced with colours
20..23 respectively when drawing the green version of the tile.
  For a 1-player game, the game randomly chooses one of the five maps
"T1".."T5" in the MapP1 directory. Maps for the 1-player game should have
zero green garages and zero brown flag buildings.
  For a local 2-player game, the game randomly chooses one of the five
maps "T1".."T5" in the MapP2 directory.
  For a modem 2-player game, the game uses the "T1" map in the MapP3
directory.
  Maps for the 2-player games should have (only) one green garage and
at least one brown flag building. The included example map is a 2-player
map.
  You can also load half maps, eg. as supported by the FME (Firepower Map
Editor) utility.

@{b}Turbo@{ub}

"T1", "T2" or "T3" (in the maps/ directory) is the main file that is
edited (ie. the file you should specify when loading or saving). However,
"tiles" (in the gr/ directory) is also loaded and thus must also be
present in its correct location.
  "T3" is is the bottommost (ie. first) level.
  The first nine tiles are always monochrome.
  The tenth tile (the entirely blank one) cannot be edited.
  The remaining tiles can be edited in 32 colours.
  The selected tile in the "Tiles" gadget will be outlined. The outline
colours have these meanings:

    Black: ordinary tile.
    Red:   graphics of this tile cannot be edited.
@endnode

@node Garrison "Garrison 1 & 2"

This editor is intended for the WHDLoad version of the games (V1.1 of the
slave was tested). Disk.2 (the scenario disk) is what is edited.
  Now you too can make 128 new levels and sell them for £24.95 :-/

There are some minor graphical differences between the game and the
editor:

  a) floor designs used in the editor do not necessarily match those
     used by the relevant game for a particular level;
  b) tile $20 has different imagery in the game depending on the level.
     In the editor, these are always shown with the same imagery
     regardless of the level;
  c) some tiles are drawn differently by the game depending on what tiles
     they are adjacent to; and
  d) the start position is shown in purple by the editor as a courtesy,
     whereas these are invisible in the game.
@endnode

@node Goal "Goal!"

Disk.3 (the custom roster disk) is what is edited.
  As that disk is not a normal AmigaDOS format, the 40 "files" on that
disk are only accessible through the editor and game. The entire disk is
always loaded or saved when the editor's Open and Save commands are used.
  The game will not allow players to share shirts; the editor likewise
enforces this rule.
@endnode

@node Rogue "HackLite/Larn/Moria/Rogue"

You can edit saved games or hall of fame (high score table) files. MCE
will detect the file type and configure itself accordingly.

@{b}HackLite@{ub}

HackLite ][ (V2.8.1 from Home Brew Software in 1993 was tested)
(eg. from http://aminet.net/game/role/HackLite2_1.lha).
  Note that HackLite (at least) deletes your saved game after loading it.
Also, HackLite has a bug whereby the game may refuse to save to a volume
such as a large hard disk, thinking it is full. A workaround is to save to
a smaller device instead, such as RAM: or a floppy disk.
  Moving yourself on the map will cause a "ghost" image of yourself to
remain in your old position (until you walk over it in the game). This is
harmless.

@{b}Larn@{ub}

This is for Caverns of Larn 12.0B (eg. from Fish Disk #63).
  Note that Larn deletes your saved game after loading it.
  Also, your Larn: assign must be set correctly or the game will crash as
soon as you enter the dungeon. The game also seems to crash if you die in
the volcano, at least on our system.
  The "Reveal All" button will cause all squares of all levels to be
marked as explored, so that the game will show you the entire level. It
does not have any effect on the editor (because the editor will always
show the entire level regardless of whether it has been revealed or not).
Additionally, it will change invisible (ie. untriggered) traps to their
visible (triggered) equivalents. Note that the "Maximize Character"
function performs a "Reveal All" for you as part of its functionality.
  Untriggered traps, which are invisible in the game, are shown in the
editor as hollow white boxes. Monsters are not shown in the editor.
  There are separate high score tables for winners and losers (though both
stored in the same file). Entries #1..#10 of the high score table are the
winners table, and entries #11..#20 are the losers table.
  Launching the game with the -s CLI argument (ie. "Larn -s") will show
the high score tables.
  Volcanco levels are designated "V1".."V3" by the game; the high score
editor designates these as "11".."13" (the saved game editor designates
them variously according to what dungeon levels have been visited).

@{b}Moria@{ub}

UMoria V5.5.0 from Henrik Harmsen in 1992 (eg. from
http://aminet.net/game/role/Moria_gfx_1.2.lha) is intended. You can get
the source code for the UNIX version of it from
http://beej.us/moria/files/source/um5.5.tar.Z .
  The game uses an "exceptional strength" system similar to Advanced
Dungeons & Dragons. Attribute values (eg. strength) of 19 or more in the
editor correspond to 18/01 and higher. Eg. 255 in the editor means 18/237
in the game.
  Not everything is shown on the map. Also, the same imagery is used
for eg. shops, whereas the game has different imagery for each.
  The way the game is designed is that only the map of the current level
is actually stored in the saved game file.
  The game keeps a lock on the high scores file while it is running;
therefore quit the game before saving the high scores table.
  Moving yourself on the map will cause a "ghost" image of yourself to
remain in your old position (until you walk over it in the game). This is
harmless.

@{b}Rogue@{ub}

This is intended for the Epyx version. (*Not*, for example,
http://aminet.net/game/role/Rogue11.lha). V1.48 from Epyx in 1986 was
tested. The version number is shown by pressing the 'V' key during play.
  denis2342's V1.48.1 edition from 2023
(https://forum.amiga.org/index.php?topic=75893.0) is supported for saved
games, but not for high score tables.
@endnode

@node HeroesOfTheLance "Heroes of the Lance & Dragons of Flame"

@{b}Dragons of Flame@{ub}

Disk.1 contains the high score table.
  Disk.2 contains the saved games. There are 64 "slots" eaching
potentially holding a saved game (and an associated virtual filename,
used in the game to specify which slot you want). Unused slots cannot be
edited.
  Inventories cannot currently be viewed nor edited.
@endnode

@node Hillsfar "Hillsfar"

Since the @{"Curse of the Azure Bonds" link PoolOfRadiance} game supports importing (and exporting)
characters from (and to) Hillsfar, it can also be useful for that game.
  The map viewer is for informational purposes only (since the camp is the
only place where it is possible to load/save). Hover the mouse pointer
over the square you are interested in; the "Contents:" gadget will change
accordingly. You can click on the map to toggle between graphical and
logical views.
  You should use a filename which is no more than 8 characters, not
including the ".HIL" extension, otherwise the game will not be able to
load the character. (The convention used by the game is to use the first 8
characters of the character name, but this is not strictly required.)
  When playing Hillsfar, you can press 'F' to force locks.
@endnode

@node ImpossibleMission2 "Impossible Mission 2"

You can edit saved games (normally named "game") or high score tables
(normally named "score"). MCE will detect the file type and configure
itself accordingly.
@endnode

@node InsanityFight "Insanity Fight"

This is intended for the WHDLoad version, or the releases with a custom
bootblock, eg. the ones at these links:

    https://www.sca.ch/amiga/disks/Insanity%20Fight%20Original.adf
    https://amiga.haller.ch/media-user/adf/insanityfight(aga-okay).adf

The game disk is what is edited (not a data disk, none of which were ever
produced).
  Clicking the right mouse button on the map will clear (blank) the
appropriate tile.
  While playing the game, you can skip levels by holding down both mouse
buttons, the joystick firebutton, and the L key simultaneously.
@endnode

@node ICFTD "It Came from the Desert"

For WinUAE users, to play these games (even the WHDLoad versions), you
need to ensure "Immediate blitter" is unticked in the WinUAE settings.

@{b}It Came from the Desert 2@{ub}

This game is aka "Antheads".
  In the WHDLoad version of the game (at least), to load a saved game, you
must press the fire button on the joystick before the intro sequence
finishes. To save a game, you click in the top left corner of the map.
@endnode

@node KeefTheThief "Keef the Thief"

Note that there is a known issue with the WHDLoad slave (V1.0): after
viewing the inventory (eg. via the "Keef|Inventory" command), the game
will crash with an access fault. This is not a bug in MCE and occurs
independently of it. The solution is to add the EXPCHIP tooltype to the
slave icon.
@endnode

@node KingsQuest "King's Quest 1-3 & Space Quest 1"

Items cannot be moved to different rooms due to the way the game's logic
works (ie. there is no logic in the game to handle items being in the
wrong room).
  Getting items via the editor might not work completely for some items,
as the game uses various variables to keep track of inventory contents and
status, differing on a per-item basis. The most reliable method is to
teleport yourself to the item and then pick it up in-game.
  Lower speed values are faster. You can use the editor set the speed to
other values than just those the game has keywords for:
  Speed 0 (unlimited) is called "fast" or "fastest" depending on the
game version.
  Speed 1 is not available in-game or is called "fast" depending on the
game version.
  Speed 2 is always called "normal".
  Speed 3 is not available in-game. It could be considered "slowish" as it
is intermediate in speed between normal and slow.
  Speed 4 is always called "slow".
  During the games, you can view the game and AGI version numbers, and
enter the trainer ("debug mode"), by pressing Alt-D for most games, or by
typing RATS ASS for KQ3 for MS-DOS. In this mode (which lasts until you
enter a new room), you can use these commands:

    TP                Teleport to the appropriate room.
    POS               Set ego's X and Y positions.
    GET OBJECT        Put the appropriate object by ID into the player's
                      inventory.
    OBJECT|SP         Give status on the appropriate object.
    SET VAR           Set a chosen variable (0..255) to a given value
                      (0..255).
    SHOW VAR          Display the value (0..255) of a variable (0..255).
    SET FLAG          Set the appropriate flag (0..255).
    RESET FLAG        Reset (clears) the appropriate flag (0..255).
    SHOW FLAG         Display info on a flag (can be either set or not
                      set).

and these keys:

    F6                Display priority layers for the current room. 
    F10               Display info on memory use.

For King's Quest 3, these additional commands are available:

    ENCHANTER STATUS  Gives a detailed status of Manannan, where he is,
                      when he'll return, etc.
 or WIZARD STATUS
    DO CHORE          Sets task as done.
    SLEEP ENCHANTER
 or SLEEP WIZARD      Puts Manannan to sleep for twenty hours.
    BYE BYE ENCHANTER
 or BYE BYE WIZARD    Kills Manannan (this doesn't work properly though).
    PUT UP SPELL      Gives all inventory items.
    PUT UP MOUNTAIN   Changes game state to arrival at the kingdom of
                      Daventry.
    PUT UP BOAT       Changes game state to the beginning of the sailing
                      trip.

These versions were used for testing:

    KQ1 for Amiga     Game 1.0U, AGI interpreter 2.082, WHDLoad slave 2.0
    KQ1 for MS-DOS    Game 2.0F, AGI interpreter 2.917
    KQ2 for Amiga     Game 2.0J, AGI interpreter 2.316, WHDLoad slave 2.0

    SQ1 for MS-DOS    Game 2.2 , AGI interpreter 2.917

Other versions and platforms may work but have not been tested; please
advise us of any issues encountered.

@{b}King's Quest 1@{ub}

Only the AGI version is supported, not the later "enhanced" SCI version.
  For MS-DOS files, teleporting will not be effective immediately; when
you reload the game and walk to another room, the new room will be next to
the specified room, in the appropriate direction. In other words, after
reloading, you should walk out of the room, turn around and walk back in,
and you will be in your desired room.
  For Amiga files, teleporting yourself via the editor around can cause
remnant animations from the previous screen to occur, eg. castle flags
waving. This does not appear to cause any harm and everything should be
back to normal once you walk or swim to another screen.
  Some items (rope, necklace, locket, glass shoes) do not appear to have
been fully implemented in the game, although they can be added (via the
editor) to your inventory. For MS-DOS files, they are not even partially
implemented.
  To see the ending, load the vanilla example, click "Maximize Game",
and set your location to the throne room.

@{b}King's Quest 2@{ub}

For MS-DOS files, teleporting will not be effective immediately; when
you reload the game and walk to another room, the new room will be next to
the specified room, in the appropriate direction. In other words, after
reloading, you should walk out of the room, turn around and walk back in,

  For Amiga files, teleporting yourself via the editor around can cause

  To see the ending, load the vanilla example, click "Maximize Game",
and set your location to Valanice. Then, in the game, just type HOME.

@{b}King's Quest 3@{ub}

Items marked with '*' are forbidden by the wizard Manannan.
  To see the ending, load the vanilla example, click "Maximize Game",
and set your location to the hall of the castle. Then, in the game, just
walk left. You should not actually set your location to the throne room
(or any other room that will immediately play music) as this will cause an
error upong reloading into the game.

@{b}Space Quest 1@{ub}

Teleporting will not be effective immediately; when you reload the game
and walk to another room, the new room will be next to the specified room,
in the appropriate direction. In other words, after reloading, you should
walk out of the room, turn around and walk back in, and you will be in
your desired room.
  The logic that the game uses to determine whether you can exit from the
four sides of the screen is based on the new room, not the old room, even
though you are, at first, in the old room. Eg. teleporting to the victory
screen will not work because the Victory screen has no exits, and
therefore you will be unable to leave your old room.
  You can change your uniform in the editor, but note that this will not
change the in-game imagery for your character. If you have changed your
uniform using the editor, you should not eg. fire your gun ("pulse ray")
in the game (you will not need to anyway, if you are wearing the "Sarien
uniform w/ helmet") as the view expected by the game is not loaded.
  Note that there are two inventory slots for survival kits; this is not a
bug in the editor.
  To see the ending, load the vanilla example, click "Maximize Game",
and set your location to Deltaur #53. Then, in the game, walk right.
When you reach the next room, walk into the right elevator. Now walk to
the shuttle. When you reach it, type ENTER SHIP and then PUSH BUTTON.

  Turning off JIT or setting the CPU emulation speed to "Approximate A500/
A1200 or cycle-exact" in the WinUAE settings will improve compatibility
(at least for V1.2 of the WHDLoad slave).

Coordinates in the game are shown as AA-CC. Ie. only the coarse
coordinates are shown. (Red coordinates in the game represent negative
numbers (eg. red 12 means -12), black coordinates represent positive
numbers. ** in the game represents a coordinate of -100 or less (red)
or +100 or more (black).) Editing of coordinates in the third dimension
(ie. altitude) is not currently supported. Indoors (ie. underground)
location editing has not been tested.
  In the editor, they are shown as AAA.BBBBB-CCC.DDDDD, where B and D are
the fine coordinates (0..65535).
  The black dot indicates your location. White dots indicate the locations
of items and props.
  You can scroll the list of items/props with the cursor keys, or via
mouse, either by using the scrollbar or by holding down the left mouse
button and moving beyond the borders of the "Locations" group.
  Although there are 11 slots, normally the game will only let you use 10
of them. Eg. if you have 11 items, you must drop (with the cursor down
key) 2 in the game before you can pick up another (with the cursor up
key). The item stack is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) stack. It might be
necessary to drop and re-get items before you can use them.
  In the "Locations" group, you can select a button and then click on
the map to move things. But older versions of layout.gadget have a bug
whereby your first click is ignored. This has been fixed for OS3.2.2.

@{b}Might & Magic 2@{ub}

Characters 1-24 are normal characters; characters 25-48 are hirelings.
  Note that the contents of the spellbook list are dependent on the
character's class. This is by design. (Clerics and sorcerers have separate
spell lists, and other classes have no spells.)
  The "Extra Items" category is not used for this game.

@{b}Might & Magic 3@{ub}

Some roster slots may be empty. It is recommended that you do not edit
these; you should only edit an existing character. The position of the
roster slots does not necessarily correspond with the in-game marching
order of the party.
  Not all possible items that can be created are necessarily fully
supported by the game.
  Note that the contents of the spellbook list are dependent on the

@node Phantasie "Phantasie 1 & 3"

Clicking on an item slot will bring up a subwindow allowing you to
change which item is stored in that slot. Unavailable choices are shown in
white.
  Usage is reasonably straightforward. You must supply an existing
character roster file from either Phantasie 1 (GUILD.DAT) or Phantasie 3
(GAMESAVE.DAT) for editing. It is unfortunately not possible to convert
characters between the two games using this editor (although note that it
is possible to use the Phantasie 3 game to convert (transfer) characters
from Phantasie 1 to Phantasie 3).
  Character locations can only be in a town (and this is all that is
supported by the game data file format). Therefore, you cannot freely
position yourself on the map; you must use the "Town" gadget to
change your position. There are no restrictions on party location.

@{b}Phantasie 1@{ub}

It is unfortunately not possible to edit potions, scrolls or treasures.
  The 'purged' flag is set by the game when a character is deleted; ie. it
is possible to 'undelete' a character by unchecking the checkbox.
  Turning off JIT in the WinUAE settings will improve compatibility (at
least for V1.0 of the WHDLoad slave).
  Although names can be up to 10 characters long, only the first 9
characters are shown in the game.

@{b}Phantasie 3@{ub}

Character slots #1-#25 are the main roster of guild members. Character
slots #26-#32 are the seven party members. It is best to drop characters
from the party first (Guild|Drop Member in the game) before editing them,
as the game seems to use some stats from the roster slot and some stats
from the party slot.
  No character may know more than 32 spells; this is a limit imposed by
the file format itself.
  Unfortunately the 'purged' flag is not editable (or viewable, for that
matter). Therefore, you should not try to create new characters with the
editor; you should instead create them within the game and then use the
editor.
  The party's town and coordinates can be set independently. When you
reload the game, you will be in the town you specified. When you then
leave that town, you will be at the coordinates you specified.
  If the party's town is set to Light, Dark or Death, the location X- and
Y-coordinates you specified are ignored by the game (you will go to a
hardcoded position). For this reason, the map always shows Scandor even
if you are on a different plane.
  Here is a cheat you can use in the game: "When you go to deposit
some gold and are asked how much type "9999999". This will be turned into
a deposit of 27009. Do not deposit any more or your account will be
nothing."

@node Pirates "Pirates! & Pirates! Gold"

Making changes to your cargo (food, etc.) or ships should be done with
caution, as it can cause encumbrance-related issues.
  For each of the three maps, the checkboxes represent whether you have
found the four quarters of that map (upper left checkbox represents the
upper left corner of the map, etc.).
  These abbreviations are used in the cities subwindow:

   F: Forts    (in ones)
   S: Soldiers (in tens)
   C: Citizens (in hundreds)
   $: Gold     (in thousands)

For OS4 users:
  OS4.1FEu2 (at least) has a bug whereby the bevels of string and integer
gadgets inside virtual gadgets are not drawn. This can be observed in the
"Cities..." subwindow. This bug has been reported and will hopefully be
fixed for OS4.1FEu3. The gadgets are still fully functional; it is only a
cosmetic issue.

For MorphOS users:
  There is an incompatibility between texteditor.gadget (eg. V15.8) and
MorphOS. Therefore, editing the description field is not permitted when
running under MorphOS.

@{b}Pirates!@{ub}

You can use the "Reposition" gadgets to reposition the treasures, family
member and cities. Click on the relevant item in the listbrowser, then
click on the map display (or use the cursor keys). Do not put treasures in
the ocean, however. The game does not seem to position the treasures until
later in the game.
  On the map, treasures are shown in yellow, and cities are shown in
purple.

@{b}Pirates! Gold@{ub}

This was tested with V1.4 and V1.5 of the WHDLoad slave. These use
slightly different saved game file formats but both are supported.
  To save the game, you must be in a city. Press the left shoulder button,
then move the flashing cursor to the bed and press the red button. Loading
is done via the game's main menu.

@node PoolOfRadiance "Pool of Radiance 1-4"

The editor uses the filename extension (.cha, .guy, .who or .pc,
respectively) to determine which game the character belongs to.
  It is easy to cause overflow of in-game amounts (eg. damage inflicted),
so be conservative with your editing.
  Editing of your portrait and of your "icon" is MCE is unnecessary and
therefore not implemented. (You can freely edit these in-game while
encamped.)
  Note that viewing/editing of items is not currently supported.
  Also note that characters are what is edited (not saved games), although
saved games reference the characters anyway rather than being self-
contained.
  To have spells visible in the in-game spellbook (grimoire), it may also
be necessary to ensure your character has eg. sufficient attributes,
sufficient levels in the relevant classes, etc.
  In the "Levels" group, "F" indicates a former level and "C" indicates a
current level. In spell lists, "C"/"D"/"M" indicates cleric/druid/magic-
user respectively.
  Unavailable choices are shown in white.

Here is a table showing which games support which character formats.
Eg. the @{"Hillsfar" link Hillsfar} game can load (import/transfer) and save (export)
Hillsfar characters, and can also load Pool of Radiance and Curse of the

Items $B3..$FF may or may not be used by the game; they have not been
seen on levels 1..3.
  Each kind of tile is normally used as either a foreground or background
tile. You are advised not to put foreground tiles in the background, and
vice versa, or you may get unexpected results in the game.
  Changing levels from within the editor will not change the map data
accordingly (as only the maps for the current level are stored in the
saved game). To change levels properly (ie. with the map data changing
accordingly) you need to do it in-game. The necessary passcodes for this
are:

    Level 1 -> Level 2             170961
    Level 2 -> Level 3             010655

Saving on level 4 (aka the "core") is not possible.

@node Questron2 "Questron 2"

Carrying all/nearly all weapons + armour + items can cause rendering
problems in the game.
  Usage is reasonably straightforward. You must supply an existing

updated appropriately when saving; it must be present in the same
directory as the character file (G0-G7), which is normally the case.
  The map extends from -30,-30..+120,+120. Only 0,0..+89,+89 is shown;
other areas are sea. You can use the X and Y gadgets to move into the
unshown areas, if desired.

@node Ragnarok "Ragnarok"

This game is also known as "Legend of Ragnarok" and "King's Table: The
Legend of Ragnarok".
  This editor is intended for the WHDLoad version.
  You can click a square on the board to select it, and then change the
type of piece on it (including creating new pieces and/or destroying old
ones).
  The cursor keys or numeric keypad can be used to move the selected piece
around the board. If the selected square is empty or the destination
square is full, the selection itself will be moved instead.
  Also, the Del, backspace or space keys can be used to clear the selected
square (ie. to destroy the selected piece). The numeric + and - keys can
be used to change the type of the selected piece.

Important notes about the game itself:
  You can skip the intro at the start of the game by holding down the
left mouse button at the black screen.
  It seems to be necessary to choose "New Game" on the disk menu before
loading a saved game. On the disk menu, save is left, load is right.
  The "music" option actually toggles sound effects; there is no music
except in the intro.
  The right mouse button is used to indicate OK in many situations.
  Both players use the (same) joystick to play.
  The game manual has countless errors and should not be relied on
regarding the interface (but it is accurate for the game rules).

@node RobinHood "Robin Hood & Rome: AD92"

Northeast (ie. top right of screen) in the game is equivalent to north

  The 3D world (ie. the "level") is represented as three 2D "layers":
lower (ground, usually blocks of grass or similar), middle (surface,
air for empty land, otherwise buildings and objects), and upper (air
layer, usually air or roofs). There is also a "barrier" layer which
restricts movement. If it is clear you will be able to walk through
buildings (but walking through water is still never possible).
  You can only directly view and edit one layer at a time, but if you
hover the pointer over a square, the contents of that coordinate for all
layers are shown in hex with a textual description (as long as none of
the integer gadgets are activated).
  You can edit the contents of the square the pointer is hovering over
in the current layer by using the cursor keys (as long as none of the
integer gadgets are activated).

@{b}Robin Hood@{ub}

This game is aka "The Adventures of Robin Hood".
  In the game, loading and saving is done by clicking the bag near the
bottom left corner of the screen, then pressing F1 to save or F4 to load
the game. Note that clicking on the "Load" or "Save" text or icons has no
effect; you have to press F1 or F4 for these operations to occur.

@{b}Rome: AD92@{ub}

This game is aka "Rome: Pathway to Power".
  The game will automatically load your saved game at startup. Saving the
game is done via the "Quit and Save" command on the game's "Quit" menu.
  Only the current level is part of the saved game. The editor does not
auto-detect the level, so you must set the "Graphics" gadget according to
the level you have loaded if you want to see the correct graphics and
descriptions.
  During the game, you can use the following cheat codes to complete each
level:

    Alt-472    Level 1 (Herculaneum)
    Alt-682    Level 2 (Rome 1)
    Alt-490    Level 3 (Britain)
    Alt-362    Level 4 (Rome 2)
    Alt-809    Level 5 (Egypt)

@node Rockford "Rockford"

High score editing:

This is self-explanatory.

Level/graphics editing:

"maps" is the main file that is edited (ie. the file you should specify
when loading or saving - even if you want to edit the graphics of the
title screen and/or tiles). It contains the level layouts. However, "hunt",
"cook", "cowb", "astr" and "doct" are also loaded and thus must also be
present in their correct locations (preferably in the "LEVS/"
subdirectory, or otherwise the same directory as "maps"). 
  The "title.bin" file is expected to be in the same directory as "maps".
If it is found, you will be able to view and edit the title screen.
  The selected tile in the "Tiles" gadgets will be outlined in white or
black. White indicates tiles that are used by the game in its included
(ie. original) levels - these are always safe to use. Black indicates
tiles that are not used by the game in any of its original levels - most
of these are also usable without problems.
  The graphics used by the tiles can also be edited. This requires OS3.2+
or OS4 (for sketchboard.gadget), and exclusive access to 32 free pens. You
can either press the E key, click the "Edit Tile Graphics..." button, or
double-click a tile in the "Tiles" display.
  Each of the 5 worlds actually has 8 levels but only the first 4 levels
for each world are actually playable in the game.

  The NL East and NL West divisions only field 6 teams each. Although you
can view and edit the 7th team in the editor, the game does not allow it
to be used.

@{b}TV Sports Basketball@{ub}

"tdat" is the main file that is edited (ie. the file you should specify
when loading or saving). However, "seas" is also edited and thus must also
be present in the same directory as "tdat".
  The coach's attributes (height, etc.) are presumably not used in the
game.
  For players' numbers, only these possibilities are allowed: 00, 0..5,
10..15, 20..25, 30..35, 40..45, and 50..55. Any disallowed number (eg. 6)
will give 00.

Hidden statistics are (from http://www.cheatbook.de/files/tvspotball.htm):

Stamina: the higher hex number means this player can stay in the
game longer before tiring. I've noticed that players with
higher stamina are more likely to commit fouls, violations etc.
In other words find a happy medium.

Release: as you may have noticed, not all players shoot alike. Some
hold the ball a little longer before releasing to be successful
on their shot. This byte determines how long. 

Arc: how high the ball arcs when shooting. A hex code of 01 or
02 indicates almost a line drive, while an 04 is one rainbow of
a shot. The catch is high arcing shots are much harder to
block, but line drive shooters draw more fouls. 

Velocity: determines how the ball will drop into the basket. Higher
arcs need less velocity so they will tend to drop straight into
the basket. Line drives need to drift forward and glide more
horizontally into the basket. 

@{b}TV Sports Boxing@{ub}

Remember to always quit the game via its "Quit" command so that it saves
eg. new boxers you have created.
  The "H" column shows the boxer's handedness (L or R for left or right).
  In-game values shown for the punch ratings and ring ratings are a tenth

are general to the entire party).

@{b}Ultima 5@{ub}

It might be necessary to "unready" your equipment before using the editor.
  It is not recommended to change location from one dungeon to another,
nor from one dungeon level to another, as the old map data may still be
used.
  Note that MCE shows dates in DD/MM/YYY format, whereas the game shows
them in MM-DD-YYY format.
  Most locations don't allow the full range of floors and X/Y-coordinates.
Eg. only Britannia/Underworld supports high X/Y-coordinates. Use of
improper combinations may cause the game to crash.
  To see the end sequence:

    * Maximize the party.
    * Set location to Doom, X: 4, Y: 7, dungeon level 7.
    * Go east.
    * All characters walk through the mirror.

@node Cred "Credits and Licence"

@{b}Credits@{ub}

MCE was designed and programmed by James Jacobs of Amigan Software.
Graphics were drawn by Martin `Mason' Merz, and by the graphicians of the
relevant games. The MorphOS port is compiled by Stefan Haubenthal. Special
thanks to Olaf Barthel for documentation of the Legend of Faerghail file
format, and to Pietro di Cristina and Steven Konecny for bug reports.
The Dungeon Master algorithms and graphics are based on work by Christophe
Fontanel, Sphenx and DreamPark Development. The Bard's Tale 3 and Faery
Tale Adventure hints were mostly sourced from the Australian Commodore and
Amiga Review magazine Adventurer's Realm hint sheets by David McKinney and
Andrew Phang, respectively.

its solitaire form, consisting of the game engine and 32 adventures. It

    * Trollstone Caverns (1979)
    * Weirdworld (1977)
    * When the Cat's Away (1993)

The basis for this conversion is the Corgi edition of the T&T 5th
Edition rules, although the Flying Buffalo editions have also been
consulted. Some special combats, item powers, abilities, and spells are
not currently implemented.
  Amiga: The game provides a ReAction GUI for OS3.5+ users and
illustrations for OS3.0+ users. It can also be run as a console
application instead (eg. for use as a BBS door game, or for OS2.0-3.1
users).

CD32 gamepad players are supported. It is system-friendly, style
compliant and screenmode-sensitive.

The supported languages are currently English, German, Greek, Italian,
Polish, Russian and Spanish.

Report+ is a freeware ReAction-based utility with nine functions:

 1. It is an enhanced, reverse-engineered, 100% byte-compatible
    replacement for the official Commodore bug reporting tool (40.2),
    optionally sending emails automatically.

Before V1.0, we released these single-game editors: BTCE, DWCE, FTACE,
HCE, PCE, Q2CE and TOLCE. These were all eventually incorporated into MCE.
  The number before the slash is the number of tools (ie. buttons on the
main menu). The number after is the actual number of games supported.
