 Dune Slap V1.2
 --------------

 CLI only! sorry GUI users you'll have to use the CLI prompt for this.

Introduction
------------

Well... what a slap in the face dune 2 came it left, and I'm silly writing
these silly little hacks for it, the first of which was in A*os, which
was about 80k this on the other hand it around about 3k :). 
Anyway I should get to telling you how it works.

Usage:

File 
			a file name from your dune 2 saves, I.E.

			_Savexxx.dat (x mean number of save!)

			BTW: this program before hack anything makes a back up of
           your save, as _Savexxx.dat.bak in the same drawer 
           dune sits.

OFFSET

      this is the offset in (decimal) that the credits exists.
			you can find this number by going to hex and search for it oooorrr
			you can use the other way below.

CLS

      Erm, clears the screen before printing anything, would everone
      out the please implerment this in the programs that outputs large
      abouts of data.

INFO

			Prints information about the Dune 2 save file to use it...
			type the filename I.E SaveXXX.dat and type the offset as your
      amount of Credits you had when you saved, it should print out
      the amount off offsets it found in the data with that number.

Other Info
----------

WARNING!!! this can be dangrious, as there is no true offset for the 
credits at all, it's total dynamic in every respect known to man, it
can change in mid game where the Credits are in the save file, so to
stop this please remember to keep some Credits in your bank, when you
save, then if the number printed out when hacking is not the amount
of credits your are offseting to, then you can hit Ctrl+C and go hunt
it down again.

Could the person how designed this idiotic file, which could have been
made a hell of a lot simpler to hack please step forward, and have himself
lobotamised!.
