K240 Cheater V1.00 - By DARK DREAMS DESIGNS


- What is it!?
--------------

It's a saved game patcher...


- Requirements:
---------------

. An Amiga
. K240 - The game


- What does it do?
------------------

The features are:

. No more money problems
. Asteroid resources at maximum


- How to work it?
-----------------

. Run K240, start a new game and save it.

. Exit K240 and run K240 Cheater.

. Select the directory where the game is installed and select the file
  you saved (should be named K240.1/K240.2, etc...).

. The program then loads the saved game, patches it and saves it.

. You can also patch old saved games ;)


- How to install?
-----------------

Just copy the icon into the directory you wish (I keep mine in the K240 directory)

And that's all...
