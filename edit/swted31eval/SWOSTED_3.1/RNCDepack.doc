RNC Data Depacker V2.1 by ])-R0C/bODYcOUNT dK!
----------------------------------------------

This little tool allows the user to depack all of the files that have been
crunched using RNC's Propack utility.  Version one of this tool was quite
useful when it was released over a year ago, but since then there have been
some RNC files that have managed to evade this decruncher by being crunched
using the FAST(Method 2) algorithm.

I've been busy coding games and haven't had time to do any ripping for the
method 2 algorithm, but low and behold in one of the EX4 coverdisks there it
was all nicely intact.  So, I updated this utility to allow method 2 crunched
files to be depacked.  Since the sources in EX4 also had CRC checks with them
I decided to incorporate them also, as it wasn't difficult to do.

This utility should now depack correctly both method 1 and method 2 RNC packed
files.  It should not care if a file is locked or not (except with a key) and
should report it's progress while decrunching.

Another feature added to this program is the ability to enter a decryption key
as a third parameter.  This must be a hex longword and must start with a dollor
sign like standard hex.  The command line for depack is as follows...


   Depack [<Input file>] [Output file] [$Decryption key]


As you can see from the above command line, the input filename is the ONLY
essential piece of information depack requires.  If the output filename is
omitted then the input file will be overwritten.  If the decryption key is
omitted then the file is depacked with a key of 0 (normal).

Here are a few examples for the lame brains out there....

Eg.
   Depack Logo.RNC Logo.iff

The above example will depack the file Logo.RNC to a file called Logo.iff

Eg.
   Depack Logo.RNC $00000929

This example will depack Logo.RNC and decrypt it with the key $00000929.  The
input file will be overwritten.  As you can see the command line looks for a
dollar sign to identify the decrpytion key.  Please don't try and fuck things
up by using files starting with dollor signs etc. as I didn't do shit-loads
of checks to serious arse-holes.

By the way, if any invalid character are found in the decrpytion key then a
zero will be substituted for the invalid character.  The decryption key is not
case sensitive.

Eg.
   Depack Logo.RNC Logo.iff $bc00343y

This will depack the file Logo.RNC to a file called Logo.iff and decrypt it
with the key $bc003430.  As you can see the Y in the above decryption key is
invalid and is therefore substituted by a zero when used by depack.

Anyway, I think that's about it for this edition...  Hope you all enjoy it and
be merry....
