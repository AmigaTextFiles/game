                             - INSTALLATION -

	The installation is a really simple operation. Everything 
	is controlled by a standard Commodore Installer script. 
	All you've got to do is to click on the install icon and
	follow the instructions.
	Be careful to put the "RNCDepack" on a path directory 
	(default is C:).
	To install the program on a disk , you've got to format a
	disk and make it bootable via "install UNIT:" Amigados
	command (e.g. install df0:).
	Then launch the install program and locate the files on the 
	disk.
	If you have a copy of Propack (not included , since it's
	a commercial product) put it on the c: directory or in the
	program directory.

                             -  PREFS EDITOR  -

	This is a new feature of version 3.1. This panel will allow
	you to specify where your data-to-edit are stored ([FLOPPY] or
	[HD DIR]) and to customize the buttons related to the devices 
	in the filerequester.
	
	It's really simple to use. I think you don't need so much 
	instructions to use it...                             

	The [SAVE] button will create a "swted.prefs" file in which
	to save all the customizations you done.

 	     THIS OPTION IS DISABLED IN THE UNREGISTERED VERSION.

                             - LOAD TEAM FILE -

	First you need to load a TEAM.xxx data file from your
	SWOS disk 2.
	

	*********************************************************
	* BE CAREFUL NOT TO USE THE ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION DISKS *
	*     THE USE OF THIS PROGRAM IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.      *
	*   MAKE SURE TO WORK ONLY WITH A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL  *
	*                        DISK TWO.                      *
	*********************************************************

	
	You do not have to decompress the data files before editing 
	them. SWOSTEAMEDIT 3.1 will do it in memory when you select 
	the file.

	You can choose the file by nationality. In this version ,
	teamfiles are listed alphabetically.
	The green buttons are related to the CLUB FILES. The
	orange ones are NATIONAL FILES. Now you can edit also
	the CUSTOM TEAMS BANK.
	You still are able to edit other files than the Disk two
	ones by selecting the related button.

	Then you're able to @{"edit" LINK "edit"} the datas.

                             - SAVE TEAM FILE -

	When you click on "SAVE TEAM FILE" gadget , you'll get a 
	panel divided in two parts.
	On the left side of it we decide the sort of compression
	we use (If you haven't propack , you won't be able to use
	it and the file will be saved @{"not compressed" LINK "unpackedsave"}. 
	In the right one the type of saving (overwriting or save as).
	To pack Swos datas belonging to the firsts version of SWOS
	(95-96) use method 2 , for other versions use method 1.
	If you want , you're also able to save datas in the normal
	@{"unpacked" LINK "unpackedsave"} format.

	THE RNC PACKED OPTIONS ARE DISABLED IN THE UNREGISTERED VERSION.
	              SEE @{"DISTRIBUTION" LINK "Distribution"} SECTION

	When you done everything , select SAVE .... to save :-)
	or CANCEL to do nothing...

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

                         - SAVE UNPACKED TEAM FILE -

	If you haven't a copy of propack (RNC) you won't be able to
	compress datafiles after you edited them.
	The matter is : uncompressed datas are longer than original 
	RNC compressed files. If you save files on the same disk you 
	loaded them be sure to have sufficient free disk space.
	
	  HINT: You may prepare a custom SWOS disk 2 by making a copy
		of it and deleting the following files related to
		the custom and nationals data:
		
		TEAM.072 - Custom Teams
		TEAM.080 - European Nationals
		TEAM.081 - African Nationals
		TEAM.082 - South America Nationals
		TEAM.083 - North America Nationals
		TEAM.084 - Asian Nationals
		TEAM.085 - Oceania Nationals
		
		Obviously you will be constricted not to use national
		or custom data in your games (because they're not 
		present on the disk).
		

	HINT2:  I never tried this hint , so I don't know if it works.
		Use your custom disk (in which some files have been
		deleted to make free disk space) to load the game.
		Anyway , make another copy of the original disk 2.
		When the game can't find the data you deleted , 
		swap the custom and the copy of the original SWOS2 
		disks. The game will be probably able to continue.
		When it finishes to load , swap the disks again.

                                  - EDIT -

       After than you've loaded a team file , you're able to edit it
       by selecting the team you want in the list that appears.
       If the list appears corrupted , make sure you've correctly 
       installed the "RNCDepack" file in your C: directory.
       You can scroll the list by the related buttons "PREV PAGE" and
       "NEXT PAGE" . Since this version , team lists are divided by
       Division. The buttons that appear in the right side of the 
       screen are to select between the different divisions.

       The other button in this page lets you select between the Edit
       and the Swap Team mode. If you turn it in SWAP MODE you'll be
       able to swap two teams belonging to different divisions so for
       example ,you can make CHELSEA play in third division and 
       HALIFAX TOWN in premier League .... 

	     THE SWAP MODE IS DISABLED IN THE UNREGISTERED VERSION.
	                SEE @{"DISTRIBUTION" LINK "Distribution"} SECTION

       If you turn it in EDIT MODE , you'll obviously edit it by mouse 
       clicks in the screen that appears.
       
       The screen will be divided in different parts:
       On the top of the screen we have informations about Team's name
       and Coach's name.
       In the left part we have the players characteristics such as
       name , skin , hairs , name , shirt number and a list of buttons 
       called @{"SKL" LINK "Skills"} and @{"NAT" LINK "Nationality"} to 
       define attitudes and nationality of the player.       
       If the player's name is written on a green background then , he
       will be part of the 11 starting players. If it's on a blue one ,
       he will be one of the 5 reserves available.
       
       In the right of the screen we have informations about shirts 
       styles and colours.
       The bottom line of buttons are for global operations:
       -Clear  : Clears the player list
       -@{"Skills" LINK "globskill"} : Edit all player's skill with a single touch of mouse..
       -@{"Nation" LINK "Nationality"} : Edit all player's nationality as above...
       -@{"Tactics" LINK "Tactics"} : Edit Team Tactics.

	Then in the bottom-right side of the panel , there are two 
	usual gadgets... UNDO and ACCEPT , that I ain't going to 
	explain what they're for.... :-)

        Each one of these skills can be defined by a number from
        0 (Poorly skilled) to 15 (Ronaldo level).
        You can manually define them or let the computer create a
        GOOD , MEDIUM or POOR SKILLED PLAYER simply by clicking the
        related gadgets. There's also the possibility to create a
        totally RANDOMLY CREATED PLAYER.
        You can assign a value to the player by clicking on the 
        Value gadget.
        There's the possibility to copy/take from data players 
        in/from two buffers in order to import/export players also 
        througout different TEAM files.
        If you click on the BUFFER ONE and BUFFER TWO gadgets , a

                              - REQUIREMENTS -

	Swos Team Edit V3.1 can be run on any Amiga Kickstart 1.3 
	or higher. It's better to have more than 1 megs of ram , 
	but I think it will run correctly also on 1 megs machines...
	The file "data.dat" MUST be present on the same directory of 
	the editor.
	Unfortunately , I fear it won't be running on A4000 but not
	for my fault , but because of Amos Professional's bug.
	The file "RNCDepack" and its documentation is to be installed
	on the C: directory of your disk/harddisk.
	You obviously also need SENSIBLE WORLD OF SOCCER and maybe
	Propack by RNC in the editor directory.

                                - ABOUT ME -  

         Hi there people! I'm Silvio Banzi , a 21 years old student
         at the Bologna University (ITALY). I'm a commodore user
         since the VIC-20. I owned also a C128 and an Amiga 500 
         before to arrive to my wonderful Amiga 1200 base.
         I like programming games and tools (such as this one)
         and I really love playing Sensible World Of Soccer.
         No other soccer game is so addictive. I like to plan some 
         Mega-tournments at this game taking the more strange teams 
         I can (such as "Vietnam" or "Tanzania" or "Qatar").
         I also like to play football in real life. I play on a club
         near my town that's called "Estense 88 F.C."
         My favourite soccer team is "INTER F.C." that's placed in
         Milan. 
         I like very much also playing piano , listening music
         (Michael Jackson , Stevie Wonder , Bruce Springsteen,
         Paul Mc Cartney , Sting , Zucchero Fornaciari ...)
         going to the cinema (or to see movies in general) and
         playing with my 8 years old little yellow dog 
	 called "Leo".
	 My favourite films are the Citizen Kane ,Star Wars trilogy , 
	 the Die Hard trilogy , the Lethal weapon trilogy , the Alien
	 trilogy , Fright Night 1 & 2 , J.F.K. , all Steve Martin
	 Robin Williams , Robert De Niro , Billy Crystal , Mel Gibson
	 Jhon Candy , Gene Wilder and Dan Aykroyd films. (I think I 
	 forgot someone or something.... anyway...).
	 I also like actresses as Demi Moore (who's a great actress :->)
	 Michelle Pfeiffer , Sigourney Weaver , Nicole Kidman , Uma
	 Thurman , Cameron Diaz....
	 My favourite directors are Steven Spielberg , Geroge Lucas ,
	 Tim Burton , Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen.
	 
	 It's time to say goodbye (Andrea Bocelli docet :-)  )

	 For any further information about the programs or the 
	 musical modules I can be found here:

    Swos Team Edit V3.1 - Release February 1998 - Distributed by Aminet

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

                       - WHAT'S NEW ON THIS VERSION ? -

				-v 3.1-
	
	o Fixed up some minor bugs (such as that in the filerequester
	  that used to cause a crash to the program when clicking
	  2nd mousebutton)

	o Alphabetical order in the load panel.
	
	o Added key shortcuts for some functions.
	
	o Added the prefs section (customizable filerequester's gadgets
	  and work directory specifications)
	  
	
				-v 3.0-

	o Fixed up a lot of bugs in the previous version (such as
	  that which in the file selection panel makes the program
	  crash if you unfortunately click in an area with no buttons).
	
	o Added the TACTICS section.
	
	o A new, more friendly SAVE panel featuring Propack support.
	
	o A "continous editing" feature (when you finish to edit a 
	  player name , the cursor will jump directly to the next)

	o Added a keyfile system.
	
	o Packed "Teams.dat" and "Fname.dat" in one shorter file
	  called "data.dat".

	o New "Global" Team Editing features

	o Fixed up the bug that affected the swap option in v2.0.
	
	o Fixed up the bug that made missing in the load panel the
	  buttons to load ASIAN and OCEANIC national teams.
	  
	o Made the TEAMS be shown by DIVISIONS.

	o Many other little changes ...
				  

				-v 2.0-
				   
	Since the first release a lot of things are changed.
	Firstly this documentation file. In version 1.0 the 
	.guide file was exclusively in Italian language.
	Well, now it's exclusively in English (or something
	similar... :-)  ) .
	Anyway... I tried to give more detailed informations about
	the program and its functions with a better look.
	To write this file I used EdWord Pro V5.0 by Martin Reddy,
	a very flexible text editor and AMIS by Willem Mestrong
	which has a great WYSIWYG amigaguide editor plug in.
	All these two programs can be found in the text/edit 
	directory of the Aminet tree.
	
	I obviously changed a lot also in the program (to justify
	the passage from V 1.0 to brand new V 2.0 after a year
	I released the first one ...).
	
      o First of all you don't need to unpack data files
	before loading the editor. It will do it for you when
	you load a team RNC Compressed file. Great, isn't it ?

      o You can now load a file team selecting it by nationality.

      o I added two buffer to store player's data. In this way
        you can exchange/copy players also througout different
        team data files.

      o I also added a swap option to change position of a team
        in the team list. This will allow you to change their
        position also in the game. For example : Lecce was
        on the Italian Serie B in SWOS 96/97. Next year , Lecce
        will play on Serie A , while Cagliari will play on Serie B.
        All you have to do is to swap the two teams.

      o I lightly restyled the User Interface to make it more friendly.

      o The filerequester has been completely re-written.
      
      o The installation script was not present in previous archive.
