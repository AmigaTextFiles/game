<FONT SIZE=4>As far as I am aware, there are no bugs in the program.  All my testing and beta testers (ta Kev, Bill and Gary) have reported no problem. There are some things which may appear as bugs, but are actually "features":<BR>
<UL>
<LI>To correctly read the tooltypes, the executable must be called "Civhack" (case unimportant)</LI>
<LI>The file "chk.logo" should be in the same directory  as the executable</LI>
<LI>If no "FONT" tooltype is specified, the IBM.font is forced (provided)</LI>
</UL>
These next features are restrictions from Civilization:
<UL>
<LI>The map file associated with a saved game is called "CIVIL(slot number).map" and is in the same location as the save file</LI>
<LI>Specifying a negative date will produce a BC year</LI>
</UL>
The only apparent bug is one in Civilization itself:
<UL>
<LI>Civilization has a nasty habit of corrupting the adjective of the last civilisation.  For example, Mongol usually becomes Mongite and Indian similarly becomes Indiite.  THIS IS CIVILIZATIONS WORK.  CIVHACK v4 CORRECTLY RENAMES <U>ALL</U> CIVILIZATION ADJECTIVES - CHECK WITH A HEX EDITOR IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.</LI>
</UL><BR>
If you find any bugs, please report them to <A HREF="author.html#where">me</A> giving details about your system.
