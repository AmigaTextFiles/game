<FONT SIZE=4>To install CivHack, it is highly recommended that you use the provided installation script.  Simply double-click on the icon and answer a few simple questions.<BR>
<UL>
    <LI>Things to note:</LI>
    <UL>
        <LI>When prompted for a saved game directory, it is recommended that you pick the root of a device as this is where Civilization saves games.</LI>
        <LI>You should enter the name of the font as: {fontname}.font with no quote marks or font size.  This font will be used for the GUI and automatically scaled to 8 points.</LI>
        <LI>The installer will copy gadtools.library and asl.library to your LIBS: assign if they are more recent or non-existent.  If you have made adjustments to either library in your Libs dir, I recommend you back them up as they will be over-written.</LI>
    </UL>
    Both of these entries can be altered once the installation is over, simply adjust the tooltypes of the executable should you change your mind.
</UL><P>

Should you decide to install manually, you MUST ensure that the file "chk.logo" is in the current directory (usually the same place as the CivHack executable) or else the program WILL NOT LOAD.
