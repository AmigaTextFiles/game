<H2>This is CivHack.  The ultimate saved game editor around.</H2><P>
<FONT SIZE=4>I conceived CivHack a few years ago when I read a book of CivHack tips.  It gave details for a procedure of editing saved games to give you more money, but you had to use a hex editor each time and this made it a bit laborious.  So CivHack was born.<BR>
Put simply, CivHack v4 will greatly ease your playing of Sid Meier's masterpiece, Civilization (sic).  It does this by allowing you to edit every civilisation's treasuries, changing the current date and even the civilisation that you control, all from a single, easy to use GadTools GUI.<HR>
