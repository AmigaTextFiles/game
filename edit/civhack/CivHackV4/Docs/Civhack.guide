@NODE intro "CivHack v4 Documentation - Introduction"

@{b}This is CivHack.  The ultimate saved game editor around.@{ub}

I conceived CivHack a few years ago when I read a book of CivHack tips.  It
gave details for a procedure of editing saved games to give you more money,
but you had to use a hex editor each time and this made it a bit laborious.
 So CivHack was born.
Put simply, CivHack v4 will greatly ease your playing of Sid Meier's
masterpiece, Civilization (sic).  It does this by allowing you to edit
every civilisation's treasuries, changing the current date and even the
civilisation that you control, all from a single, easy to use GadTools GUI.

@ENDNODE

@NODE req "CivHack v4 Documentation - System Requirements"

CivHack does not place any huge overheads on your system.  You need only:

   - gadtools.library (WB 2.0+)      \ Both of these are supplied
   - asl.library (WB 2.0+)           / with the installation
   - Workbench 2.0
   - Some civilization saved games (both CivAGA and ECS versions supported)
   - A copy of Civilization - note: CivAGA games are not compatible with
        CivECS and vice-versa
   - A harddisk is recommended but not essential

Memory usage is small (around 100k) and should not pose problems.  Any 68k
processor is fine, although a 68020 is recommended.

@ENDNODE

@NODE install "CivHack v4 Documentation - Installing CivHack"

To install CivHack, it is highly recommended that you use the provided
installation script.  Simply double-click on the icon and answer a few
simple questions.
    Things to note:
    
      -  When prompted for a saved game directory, it is recommended that
you pick the root of a device as this is where Civilization saves games.
      -  You should enter the name of the font as: {fontname}.font with no
quote marks or font size.  This font will be used for the GUI and
automatically scaled to 8 points.
      -  The installer will copy gadtools.library and asl.library to your
LIBS: assign if they are more recent or non-existent.  If you have made
adjustments to either library in your Libs dir, I recommend you back them
up as they will be over-written.
    
    Both of these entries can be altered once the installation is over,
simply adjust the tooltypes of the executable should you change your mind.
Should you decide to install manually, you MUST ensure that the file
"chk.logo" is in the current directory (usually the same place as the
CivHack executable) or else the program WILL NOT LOAD.

@NODE history "CivHack v4 Documentation - History"

Early 97 : Original conception
    v1.2 : Written in uncompiled Amos BASIC.  Text driven and pretty user
unfriendly.
    v1.8 saw a major bug fixed, when the treasuries were altered badly,
corrupting the game file.
    v2.2 
    v2.5 : Mini-intro added and was compiled into a Workbench compatible
executable.
    v3.1 : Saving to a different slot possible, but .map file needed to be
copied manually.
    v3.3 (Late '97) : .map file copied automatically
    v3.3HD was Hard Disk installable but required manual installation.
    v3.6HD (Early '98) : Install script provided, NewIcons and the
Commodore Installer program.
    v3.7 (Mid '98) : Added renaming functions
    v4.01 (Late '98 to early '99): Total rewrite in Blitz, with new
GadTools GUI.  Opened on WB screen.  Allowed renaming of civilisations as
well as leaders.  Changing of year addded.

@ENDNODE

@NODE future CivHack v4 Documentation - Future

This is what I hope for future versions:

   - Refinements to GUI and load/save algorithms
   - Embedding graphics in executable, so no need for chk.logo file
   - Unit renaming
   - City renaming
   - Improved configurability
   - Font-sensitive GUI (maybe in MUI) - maybe
   - And anything that you lot suggest (realisticly)

@NODE me "CivHack v4 Documentation - About the author"

CivHack was written and developed by Alex Furmanski.  He is a sixteen-year
old student, studying maths, electronics, computing and chemistry A-levels.
 Yes, four of the buggers!
He has a long history in programming - he started on his first computer, a
ZX Spectrum, when he was only 8 years old.  He has been refining his
techniques and expanding his knowledge of languages and can write fluent
Speccy, Amos, GFA and Blitz Basic.  He is also learning PASCAL as part of
his computing course.
He currently runs an Amiga 1200, on a slender 6mb of RAM and a 68020, aided
by a 68882.  Storage comes in the form of a 1.7gb 3.5" IDE harddisk and two
3.5" floppy drives.  Oh yes, and a 32x CD-ROM, all still hanging from the
keyboard unit.  Oh for some money.

Alex lives in Luton, Bedfordshire.  The only shop to stock new Amiga titles
are Electronics Boutique, but their support has dwindled to a single shelf
and second hand games are available from "The Software Cellar". It isn't a
wildly happening Amiga scene.
But never mind, as long as he gets AF each month he's kept happy and mail
order isn't that bad, really?  If you feel the urge to contact him, then
you might like to know this:

He would be very glad to hear your feedback and ideas for the next release,

@NODE bugs "CivHack v4 Documentation - Known Bugs"

As far as I am aware, there are no bugs in the program.  All my testing and
beta testers (ta Kev, Bill and Gary) have reported no problem. There are
some things which may appear as bugs, but are actually "features":

    - To correctly read the tooltypes, the executable must be called
"Civhack" (case unimportant)
    - The file "chk.logo" should be in the same directory  as the
executable
    - If no "FONT" tooltype is specified, the IBM.font is forced (provided)

These next features are restrictions from Civilization:

    - The map file associated with a saved game is called "CIVIL(slot
number).map" and is in the same location as the save file
    - Specifying a negative date will produce a BC year

The only apparent bug is one in Civilization itself:

    - Civilization has a nasty habit of corrupting the adjective of the
last civilisation.  For example, Mongol usually becomes Mongite and Indian
similarly becomes Indiite.  THIS IS CIVILIZATIONS WORK.  CIVHACK v4
CORRECTLY RENAMES ALL CIVILIZATION ADJECTIVES - CHECK WITH A HEX EDITOR IF
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

If you find any bugs, please report them to @{" me " link "me"} giving
details about your system.

@ENDNODE

@NODE use "CivHack v4 Documentation - Usage"

I have tried to make CivHack as intuitive as possible, and this is aided by
a familiar Gadtools GUI.  An explanation of how to make selections and work
the interface are unnecessary (yes!).

@{b}Loading the program@{ub}

This is simply a matter of double-clicking on the CivHack icon.  CivHack
may also be started from a CLI by typing:
@{i}        cd {dirname}
        (Run) CivHack@{ui}
Where {dirname} is the name of the directory where CivHack can be found.
When launched from Workbench, you have the added option of adjusting the
tooltypes.  Currently, 2 different tooltypes are supported:

    - SAVEPATH : This is the path that, by default, CivHack will look in
for your saved games.  It is not necessary to use quote marks, even if the
path has spaces in it.
    - FONT : This is the font that will be used to render all text in the
GUI.  You should give the name of the font file and not the size at it will
be automatically scaled to 8 points.  Eg:
        FONT=ibm.font
        FONT=newtopaz.font
        FONT=futurac.font
These tooltypes will have been set to the choices you made during
installation.
Upon loading, you will be presented with the GUI. The next thing you will
need to do is load in a saved game.

@{b}Loading a saved game.@{ub}

To load a saved game, simply click on the "Load" button in the bottom right
corner of the window.  An ASL file requester will open, at the path
specified in the SAVEPATH tooltype and will only show files that match the
pattern #?.sve.  Civilization saved game files are named "CIVIL#.sve" where
the # represents a save slot, from 0 to 9.
Select a file and click the OK button.  The game will be loaded into memory
and the GUI updated.  All versions of Civilization games are supported,
including the recently released CivAGA and CivECS on CD, and previous
versions.  I am not sure about save files from the PC version.

@{b}Altering leader names, dates and treasuries@{ub}

Once updated, the gadgets in the window will have filled with information
about the various civilisations in the game.
Each row of gadgets represents information for one civilisation and each
column shows data about the civilisation.  From left to right, the columns
are:
    - Civilisation number
    - Button for renaming civilisation
    - Money in treasury
    - Leader name
The contents of all gadgets may be changed, so to change the name of the
leader of the Romans, simply locate the Romam leader and type a new name in
the box.  The same goes for the treasuries.
The year gadget shows the current game date and can also be changed -
useful if you are in a space race and the game is about to end.  Specifying
a negative date will result in a BC year (Eg: 1804=1804 AD, -300 = 300 BC)
Perhaps the most interseting value to change is the value in the "Your Civ"
box.  This number corresponds to the civilisation number in the leftmost
column and represents the civilisation that you control.  In the shown GUI,
I control Civ nmuber 5 - you can see my name in the leader box.  Changing
this number allows you to take control of ANY of the other civilisations
present in the game.  This opens up new ways of playing the game, my
favourite is to build up a strong, large empire, save the game and loade in
to CivHack. There, I change the year to 0 AD and take control of the
weakest civilisation.  Upon reloading, I try to topple my old civilisation
which is now being run by the computer.  It is a great way of rejuventating
old saved games.
It is important to note that Civilization only allows a maximum of 30000
for the treasury a civilisation. This is a restriction in the file
structure, not of CivHack.  If you enter a larger number, it will be
reduced to the maximum upon saving.
The changes that you will find most useful are year changing and treasury
changing (good for boosting your performance AND hindering your enemies) as
these have an effect on the way the game plays.  The other changes are
cosmetic, but can provide amusement.

@{b}Renaming a Civilisation@{ub}

You will notice there is not a string gadget containing the civilisation
names. This is because there is not one string, but two for each
civilisation - a noun and an adjective.  Those of you with dodgy grammar
need not be afraid, all will be explained.
Clicking on the button labelled "Rename Civ" in a civilisation's row will
open up a small window with two string inputs and two buttons. The buttons,
"Okay" and "Cancel", are to keep and forget changes made respectively.
The two string gadgets are for the noun and adjective, both are labelled.
 The noun is the name of the civilisation, used in sentences such as
"Empire of the Romans" and "A. Furmanski, leader of the Romans" - here
Romans is the noun.  Adjectives are descriptors and are used by the game in
phrases like "Roman Trireme" and "Roman empire" - here Roman is an
adjective.
For some civilisations, the noun and the adjective are the same - French
and French, German and German, Chinese and Chinese.  In most cases, the
noun will be simply the plural of the adjective.  Here are some examples:
    
                    Noun     |  Adjective
            -----------------+----------
            Romans           |   Roman
            French           |   French
            Greeks           |   Greek
            Americans        |   American

or if you want to make custom civilisations:

            Scottish/Scotts  |   Scottish
            Welsh            |   Welsh
            Craps            |   Crap
            Amigas           |   Amigan
            Foreigners       |   Foreign

If you are unsure, plug the noun and adjective into the following sentence.
If it the grammar is good, then the words are okay.
"I am the ruler of the {noun} and I am sailing in my {adjective} trireme."

@{b}Saving to the same slot@{ub}

To save all changes to the same save slot as was loaded from, simply click
on the "Save" button in the main GUI.  THIS WILL OVERWRITE THE OLD SAVE
SLOT AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK THE OLD SETTINGS.  A requester
will pop up, warning you you of this.  Clicking on "Overwrite" will
overwrite the old saved game.
Until you are confident with using CivHack, and the effect changes can
have, I recommend you either save to a new slot or backup the old save
file.  I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOST DATA THAT ARISES
FROM THE USE OR MISUSE OF CIVHACK.

@{b}Saving to a new save slot@{ub}

This feature allows you to save to a save game slot other than the one you
loaded from.  This adds security as there is no chance of you overwriting
the old saved game.  To save to a new slot, click the "Save As" button.
Once selected, an ASL path requester will open at the path you loaded from.
 You should then select the path that you want to save to.  NOTE:  CIVHACK
ALLOWS YOU TO SAVE TO AND LOAD FROM ANY LOCATION ON ANY DISK.  CIVILIZATION
ON ALLOWS SAVED GAME FILES TO BE KEPT IN THE ROOT OF A DISK.  With this in
mind, it is very highly recommended that you save to the root of a device
("Devicename:" with no path after the colon) or else Civilization will not
be able to find your game.
A small window will open containing a slider gadget and two buttons.  Use
the slider to select a slot number, from 0 to 9 and click "Okay" to save or
"Cancel" to abort the save.
Each .sve file has a .map file associated with it (CIVIL1.sve and
CIVIL1.map).  Each saved game comprises of both these files and, for it to
work, Civilization must also be able to locate the .map file in the same
location as the .sve file.  CIVHACK WILL NOT SAVE A .SVE FILE IF IT CANNOT
COPY THE .MAP FILE FROM THE ORIGINAL SLOT.  For example: if you load
CIVIL0.sve and want to save to CIVIL3.sve, CivHack must also be able to
copy CIVIL0.map to CIVIL3.map else it will fail.  You will be informed of
this, should it occur. (This requester has only been known to appear when
the .sve files were moved from one device to another without the .map
files.)  CivHack does not save without the .map because without it, the
save game will not work.
A requester will also appear should you choose a save slot which is already
occupied.  You will be given the option of overwriting the slot or
cancelling the save.

@{b}Quitting CivHack@{ub}

When you have decided you have finished cheating, click the "Quit" button
in the main GUI to leave the program.  You will be warned that all changes
will be lost and given a chance to change your mind.
