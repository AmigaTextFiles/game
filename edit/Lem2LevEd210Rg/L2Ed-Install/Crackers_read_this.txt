Hello dear cracker,

if you try to crack  this  program,  you  won't  be  successful:  The  data
required  for  full  usage  of the program is simply not there! It's in the
keyfile.

And if you try to crack the keyfile: Forget about it... There  are  several
checksums  and  the each keyfile is unique due to shuffled assembling. That
means I can trace the origin of a cracked keyfile  back  with  100  percent
probability.

And don't try to fuzz around with  the  main  program  to  get  a  modified
keyfile working! The program is able to blow up your harddisk if it detects
any modifications.

Keep your fingers off this program. I've spend a lot of time  and  work  to
code it.
