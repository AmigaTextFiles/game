                               Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

Installation is normally done using the @{b}Installation Script@{ub}.

If you haven't installed this software yet, you may click @{" here " system "Installer L2Ed-Install APPNAME L2Ed MINUSER AVERAGE DEFUSER EXPERT LOGFILE T:L2Ed.logfile"} to  start
the script. (This might not work on all systems).

Please note that it's not done by just copying the Editor to your harddisk.
PrepL2  is an essential part of the Installation. It installs the patch and
creates some files and  directories  on  your  harddisk.  Please  read  the
@{" Legal Issue " link legalstuff} about this patch.

Normally, the Editor and associated files have to be  placed  in  the  same
directory  Lemmings has been installed in. Starting with V1.3 you can place
the Editor anywhere on your harddisk, if you pass the location of the  game
using the "LEMMINGSDIR=drawer" ToolType.

No assigns are needed. The Editor will search in following directories  for
the following files:

@{b}This manual & online help:@{ub}

  Starting with V1.3 you may even specify the location of the manual  using
  the "HELPFILE=file" ToolType.

  Filenames: "L2Ed.guide"
             "L2Ed_E.guide"
             "L2Ed_V37.guide"
             "L2Ed_E_V37.guide"
  Drawers:   "PROGDIR:"
             "PROGDIR:Help"
             "PROGDIR:Docs"
             "HELP:"
             "HELP:Guide"
             "HELP:English"

@{b}Registered keyfile:@{ub}

  Filenames: "L2Ed.key"
  Drawers:   "PROGDIR:"
             "DEVS:Keyfiles"
             "S:"
             "ENVARC:"

The supplied installation script is also able to remove the editor from you
harddisk again.

If you want to disable the internal filecache specify "NOFILECACHE" in  the
ToolTypes.

Use the "WORMSDIR=drawer" ToolType to specify  the  default  directory  for
Worms level saving.

                               Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

The Lemmings 2 Level Editor is a (quite obvious) Level Editor for  Lemmings
2  by DMA Design. You will be able to create up to 8 world files for all 12
tribes (+ Practice levels), each one containing 10 Levels (that's up to 960
normal and 32 Practice levels in total).

Summary of features:

- Selectable Screenmode (runs on ECS or AGA  chipset  or  even  on  graphic
  boards).
- Font sensitive menu and gadget layout.
- Efficient built-in file caching system.
- NewLook Menus on Kick 3.0 or higher.
- Tries to keep new look with different palettes.
- Tries to keep everything readable on Kick 2.0, which doesn't support full
  DrawInfo.
- Online Help in menus.
- Window positions are saved along with the preferences.
- Iconify.
- Plot, line and bar drawing modes.
- 64 KB Undo/Redo buffer with unlimited steps.
- 100% assembly language code.
- No hardware hacking!
- Has been tested with Mungwall and Enforcer (+ Memory Protection option)

However, it is not possible to create  a  new  tribe  with  completely  new
graphics and objects etc.

@{b}---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       General Information on Levels
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

Lemmings Levels can be seperated into three main parts:

1. The Level Map, which is build up using 16*8 pixel sized predefined block
   graphics, both transparent and solid for the Lemmings.

   @{b}The Levels can be of varying sizes, and can  be  visibly  reduced  by  a
   limiting  border  (this  is  the  white  dotted  box seen in every map).@{ub}
   Lemmings going past this border will vanish.

   @{b}The blue dotted box has a draging knob in  the  lower  left  corner  and
   defines the area at which the users looks at the start of the level.@{ub}

   Manipulating the map can be either done  using  Raw  Blocks,  these  are
   single  blocks,  selectable  from  about  600 different blocks, or Block
   Elements. The Block Elements are predefined chunks  of  blocks  and  are
   displayed  shrinked  to  1/4 of their actual size, because the layout is
   taken directly from the graphics file and the graphics would be to  wide
   (320 pixels).

   There are three drawing modes to be applied to both Raw Blocks and Block
   Elements:  Plot,  Line and Bar. All drawing operations can be undone and
   redone multiple times.

   The Raw Block and Block Elements windows  can  be  sized,  and  normally
   don't  display all the available blocks at a time. Pressing Space or the
   right mouse button will flip to the next page of blocks.

   @{b}NEW FEATURE FOR V2.0: Maps can now be drawn with  any  painting  package
   and  after having saved the graphics as IFF-ILBM picture, it then can be
   imported directly into the Editor as Level Map!@{ub}  The  graphics  must  be
   exactly  the same size as the Level and consist exactly of 16 colours (4
   bitplanes). The palette should be similar to the one used in  the  game,

   as the object will still use the old colour indexes.  Therefore  example
   pictures  containing  the  original  palette  for  each  tribe have been
   included in the custom folders. See @{" here " link m01031f} for more details.

2. Objects, placed over the map, like starts, exits, traps, water etc.

   There can be up to 64 objects on each levels.  Objects  normally  should
   not overlap, but this is not tested for. Objects are drawn in the  order
   they have been created.

   @{b}All Objects can be dragged, some of them can even be sized. The  Objects
   on the map are displayed together with @{" Object Indicators " link m030403}.@{ub}

   More information on Objects see @{" here " link objectinformation}

3. @{" Level preferences " link m01011f}, e.g which Lemmings are available to the player.

You first should have a look at the @{" Keyboard Layout " link keyboard}, then see  what  the
@{" Windows " link windows}  do  and  how  they  are  controled.

After that, you might want to see the rest of the @{" Menus " link m1f3f1f}.

                             Background story
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}
 
Having enjoyed Lemmings 1 and it's Data Disk, I immediately bought Lemmings
2  -  The  Tribes  on release in 1993. Sadly enough, I made it through in a
short time. I also bought All new World of Lemmings (Lemmings 3),  but  was
quite disappointed by it.

So in the beginning of 1996 I had the idea of making a Level Editor for the
great  game  Lemmings  2.  I  had a first look at the files on the disks: I
found the graphic files of each style, but not the actual level files. So I
examined  the  main  executable  and  finally  found them there, RNC packed
(which was no problem to decrunch because I  had  used  a  RNC  decrunching
routine  long  ago  in my AMOS AMCAF-Extension (have a look at this one, if
you're an AMOS programmer!)). Then I  started  to  write  a  Level  viewing
program  in AMOS, which was quite easy, except of finding out images of the
level objects. I just couldn't  find  out,  which  information  the  chunks
contained. So I gave up.

One night, I had an idea to get this data, and after two days of trial  and
error, the level viewer was finally finished.

But then there was the next problem: The  level  files  were  in  the  main
program.  How could I get Lemmings2 to load the levels instead of unpacking
them from inside? There was only one solution: Using a disassembler to find
out,   where   the  level  decrunching  routine  was.  After  one  week  of
mindboggling decoding, I finally found it. I wrote a quick  patch  to  load
the levels. But that was not enough: I had to create some kind of selection
screen. So I went into more resourcing and another week passed before I got
a nice screen with fading and using the built-in text routines of Lemmings.

Now I had to write a small program  that  installs  this  patch.  That  was
hardly any work and was finished soon. Now I could start coding on the main
editor. Taking routines from other projects I'm working on, it gave me some
quick  start off. But it took me one whole month to finish it to it's first
usable version V0.7, which I gave my younger sister to create  some  levels
with.  After  one  week, I was nearly finished with the general stuff. So I
started writing this manual (15-Aug-96).  To  do  list:  Object  optimizer,
Keyfile/Registering code, Menu and Button Online Help, Trace Mouse, general
beta-testing.

Well, it's now the 26-Aug-96, and I'm nearly finished (V0.99).  Still,  the
manual is pretty incomplete...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

Note: Using an Autopoint utility like the one  supplied  on  the  workbench
      disk (in the Tools/Commodities-Drawer) or MultiCX, makes  the  editor
      much  simpler  to  use,  as the windows don't have to be activated by
      hand. If you don't want use autopoint,  don't  forget  you  can  only
      activate  the  level  window  by  either  clicking  into (can be very
      annoying), or pressing the Return key.


@{b}@{u}Level Map Window:@{ub}@{uu}

  This is the backdrop window, which is used  to  display  the  level  map.
  Normally,  this  window  is as big as the screen (exception see @{" here " link m030002}).

  What  you  actually  can  see  on  the  map  is   controlled   with   the
  @{" Show " link m03041f}-Prefs.


@{b}@{u}Raw Blocks Window:@{ub}@{uu}

  Holds all the Raw Blocks available. Clicking on a block will make it  the
  active one, and the mode will change to 'Raw Blocks' (see Screen Title).

  If you click on the same block a second time, all blocks will be ghosted,
  indicating the block now being transparent.

  Drawing with a transparent block 0 (the empty one)  will  not  erase  the
  graphics  underneath  but  make  keep  them  as they are, but making them
  transparent.

  Depending on the size of the window, it might not  show  all  the  blocks
  available.  Switching  to  the  next  page is either done by pressing the
  Space-key or clicking with the right mouse button.

  Using Raw Blocks you can create a lot of never seen  level  layouts,  for
  example fake objects (blocks, that look like solid blocks, but aren't!).

  Note that clicking on a object or drag nob  will  switch  to  no-op  mode
  after  the  operation,  so  you need to reselect the block before you can
  draw on the map again.

  If you have selected the @{" Picks up " link m030301} mode for the  @{" Right Mouse Button " link m03031f},
  you can also select the block you want to draw with using the right mouse
  button on the level map.


@{b}@{u}Block Elements Window:@{ub}@{uu}

  Block Elements are predefined images which are often needed during  level
  design.  I  took them directly from the graphics file. It seems as if the
  original Psygnosis level editor used a  320  pixel  wide  Lowres  screen,
  where  you  could select these Block Elements. However, 320 pixels is too
  wide for my Editor (or do you prefer to have a 320 pixels wide window  on
  your  screen all the time?), so I had to shrink them down to 1/4 of their
  original size (half width, half height).  Don't  forget  this  fact.  The
  graphics can be @{" interpolated " link m03071f} to get better results.

  Block Elements are shown on the map while you  move  your  mouse  around,
  making it easier to figure out where it would be best to place them.

  Selecting Block Elements is pretty similar  to  the  procedure  with  Raw
  Blocks: One click selects the Element, another one toggles transparency.

  Page flipping works exactly the same like above.

  Note that clicking on a object or  dragging/sizing  nob  will  switch  to
  no-op  mode after the operation, so you need to reselect the block before
  you can draw on the map again.

  @{" Picks up " link m030301} doesn't work for Block Elements.


@{b}@{u}Objects Window:@{ub}@{uu}

  This window contains a listview gadget with all  the  objects  available.
  Selecting  one  will  take you to the Place Object mode, so you can paste
  the object to the map. You can have up to 64 Objects on the map.  If  you
  run out of Objects, the @{" Object Optimizer " link m02001f} might help.

  Unlike the blocks on the map, objects can be dragged by clicking  on  the
  dragging nob in the top left corner of each object.

  Some objects can be sized: They have a second nob  in  the  bottom  right
  corner.

  If you want to delete an Object, you can do this  by  selecting  it  (and
  then  pressing  the  Del  key),  or  alternatively,  if  you've  set  the
  @{" Right Mouse Button " link m03031f} mode to @{" Deletes " link m030300}, just click on  an  Object  with
  the right mouse button.

  More information about Objects can be found @{" here " link objectinformation}.

                      Information on the Patch itself
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

The installation script installs a  patch  into  Lemmings  which  makes  it
possible  to  load  up  the custom levels. Everytime the main code tries to
load a level,  the  L2  Editor  Patch  Screen  comes  up,  giving  you  the
possibility to select your world file you want to play.

Then you've got three choices:

@{b}@{u}1. Accept and sleep:@{ub}@{uu}

   The patch will take your setting for all futher loading  activities  and
   will never show up again. If you want to change it again, press and hold
   the right mouse button when you expect the program to show up.

@{b}@{u}2. Accept:@{ub}@{uu}

   Just accept this setting, but show up everytime  Lemmings  is  going  to
   load a level.

@{b}@{u}3. Cancel:@{ub}@{uu}

   Ignore your setting and load up the original levels.


If your @{b}world@{ub} file is not in the list of selectable files,  try  to  update
the catalogs from within the Editor.

Moreover, starting with V2.0, you can quickly exit the game by pressing the
Shift-Q key while playing.

into it's new position until you release the button again.

Some Objects have a second nob in the lower right corner, which is used  to
change the Objects size. Sizing is done in a similar way to dragging.

There's a maximum of 64 Objects on  the  each  level.  The  amount  may  be
reduced using the @{" Object Optimizer " link m02001f}.

Try to keep Objects off overlapping. Objects are drawn in  the  order  they
have been created. Deleting an Object will create a gap in the Object list,
which will be filled when you create a new Object.

For the following Objects more information available:

                               Object: Start

This is the Object the Lemmings start from. There always must be  at  least
one Start Object, although you can place a lot of them around the level.

Keep these objects within the level boundary!

How fast the Lemmings leave the  Start  Object  can  be  changed  with  the

                               Object: Exit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

This is the Object all the Lemmings should walk into to complete the level.
If  you're  not creating a @{" Practice " link m00000d} level, there should be at least one,
although there can be as many as you like.

You have to be a little bit more careful when it comes to exits.  The  exit
will not work if you do it wrong.

There are two types of exits: Normal ones and solid ones.  The  first  type
just  contains  of  the  exit,  the  latter  have  one  or two solid blocks
underneath.

Normal exits can placed anywhere as long there is NO solid block underneath
them. If you need a solid block below the exit, use a solid exit instead.

Solid exits can be placed anywhere on the map. Be sure  you  don't  overlap
the solid block with other solid blocks or the exit won't work.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

Water always consists of two parts: The top part and the bottom  part.  The
top part is not harmful for the lemmings in any way. The bottom part really
is water with all its dangers.

Note that both parts can be sized,  so  please  don't  place  single  water
pieces all over the place.

Also note that a Lemming equipped with  Swimmer  and  Magnoboots  can  walk
underwater!

                           Object: Solid Blocks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

These are blocks which cannot be destroyed by anything. Solid blocks can be
sized and you should use this feature whereever possible.

You might create levels with graphics that  look  like  solid  blocks,  but
aren't.  But  don't use this feature too often because it's very irritating
and annoying.

                         Object: Swing/Roundabout
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

This is the famous Roundabout which is found on many levels. Note that  you
should not place too many of them on your map, because Lemmings cannot cope
with too many chains.

Also note that the swinging frequency is dependant on  the  length  of  the
chain, which can be changed by sizing the Roundabout up and down.

                          Object: Cannon/Catapult
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

Cannons always shoot the Lemmings to the left where as Catapults eject them
to the right.

Neither the cannon nor the catapult itself is displayed on the map.

Note that catapults need at least three chain parts to operate correctly.

There's a maximum length for all the cannon/catapult chain segments, so  if
anything  goes  wrong on your level, reduce the amount of cannons/catapults
or their lengths.

These are lemming catapulting Objects.

Lemmings passing the Dino Catapult will be shot to the right. Can  only  be
found in the @{" Cavelem " link m000002} Tribe.

The Plant catapult only works if the Lemmings fall from above onto it.  Can
only be found in the @{" Outdoor " link m000007} Tribe.

@{b}---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Object: Sand Container & Toggle
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

These are special objects never used in the original levels,  probably  due
to  a  bug (see below). These objects are only available in the @{" Egyptian " link m000004}
and @{" Shadow " link m000009} Tribes.

The Sand Container contains a liquid that is similar to the  one  a  Filler
Lemming  spreads.  If  the  area below the container empty, it will release
it's liquid from the beginning of the level 'till  a  Lemming  disables  it
using the Sand Toggle.

If you select a Sand Toggle or Container, the corresponding Object will  be
marked with a box in green colour (if available).

@{b}@{u}Warning: Bug!@{ub}@{uu}

  The Sand Container needs some special care: There's  a  bug  in  Lemmings
  that  will  cause  the  game to crash under right conditions: If the sand
  reaches the opening hole of the Sand  Container,  the  game  freezes.  To
  avoid  this  bug,  always  make  sure that the sand can run off the level
  somewhere, or limit the time so that it can't reach this height.  Have  a
  look at the provided levels to get the grip of it.

Teleports are only available in  the  @{" Space " link m00000a}  Tribe.  They  teleport  one
Lemming at a time to another Teleport Object.

To see the destination of a Teleporter, select it and you'll  get  a  green
box around the target Teleporter.

NEVER place an odd amount of Teleporters  on  a  map,  this  will  lead  to
unpredicable effects or even crash you computer when playing Lemmings 2.

Steam Leaks are only available in the  @{" Sports " link m00000b}  Tribe.  Lemmings  running
into the steam will be ejected in the direction the steam blows.

Steam Leaks can be turned off and on again using the corresponding  Toggle.
To  find  out  which  Toggle or Leak will interact, select the Object and a
green box will appear on the target object.

NEVER let two steam leaks overlap that blow into different directions, this
may crash Lemmings 2.

Currently, the steam sprites are displayed as pipe parts, but  I  hope  you
can imagine what it should be :-)

                        Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

@{b}Q: How do I create Practice Levels with different Tribes?@{ub}

A: Simple thing this is... first  design  your  level  with  your  prefered
   tribe, then save it to disk (or copy it to your clipboard) and  load  it
   into your Practice world file.


@{b}Q: I have designed a level, but everytime I want to play  it,  my  computer
   crashes. What am I doing wrong?@{ub}

A: First check your level name for illegal characters (>127), then look  if
   you  use too many roundabouts or too many catapults/cannons. Also try to
   reduce  the chain lengths of cannons and catapults or temporarily remove
   them. If this isn't going to solve the problem, send me  the  level  and
   I'll try to find out what's wrong.


@{b}Q: I'm using Exits in my level, but somehow, the Lemmings  just  walk  past
   them. What the hell is happening? @{ub}

A: You probably have made a little mistake with solid blocks underneath the
   exit. Refer to the @{" Object Information " link objectinformation} on @{" Exits " link objexit}.


@{b}Q: The Blocker (or Attractor) Lemming doesn't work!@{ub}

A: The Blocker only works with the Classic  Tribe.  The  Attractor  doesn't
   work in the Classic Tribe (there had been no Attractor in Lemmings 1).


@{b}Q: I'm running out of objects all the time. I've used a lot of solid blocks
   and water.@{ub}

A: You're probably not using the sizing feature for solid blocks and water.
   Try  to replace single objects with one long object stripe. Or if you're
   registered, just run the @{" Object Optimizer " link m02001f}.

   If this doesn't solve the problem, try to replace solid blocks with fake
   ones (using Raw Blocks), where the player won't notice the difference.


@{b}Q: I've tried hard but I can't get past the first level(s). How can I  play
   the other ones without having made the predecessors?@{ub}

A: There's a cheat to play all the levels. On the Lemmings 2  Title  screen
   click in all four corners until you hear a "Let's go" sound (not the one
   from the music).


@{b}Q: Why do I lose 48 bytes each time I start and quit the program?@{ub}

A: This seems to be a bug in the amigaguide.library or the datatypes and is
   not a problem of the Editor itself.


@{b}Q: When I play Lemmings on my Computer, the sound effects disappear after a
   short while. What's wrong?@{ub}

A: Dunno, but on my 68060 it disappears if I  don't  turn  off  the  music.
   Might be a bug in the med replaying routine.

                                  History
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

Programming on the Editor started on 14-Jul-96.

V2.0 (20-Feb-97):
  - Added support for custom graphics!
  - Misc changes.
  - Patch: Added sounds to menu.
  - Patch: Added keyboard function to quit out (shift-q).
  - Patch: Added raw support for CUSTOM LEVEL GRAPHICS!
  - Fixed a little bug in the getmodename routine.

V1.3 (20-Jan-97):
  - Patch: Now handles file imploded files as well: Demo worlds are much
    smaller now.
  - Added update-only feature in the installer-script.

V1.3 (08-Jan-97):
  - Fixed a bug in the undo feature when disabling the objects showing.
    (Normally this affected Line and Bar Drawing).
  - Changed the Installer-Script to handle the lems2HD.lha file instead of
    the lzx one, as (please insert appropriate word) aminet server now
    just kills archives if it finds lzx archives in there.

V1.3 (02-Jan-97):
  - Added some tooltypes:
    "LEMMINGSDIR=drawer" allows you to move the editor to other places.
    "HELPFILE=file.guide" specifies the file to use for the online help.
    "WORMSDIR=drawer" specifies a default drawer for saving levels.
  - Fixed a bug which caused some menu items to be enabled, even if the
    tribe graphics loading process failed and therefore no level existed.
    Selecting these items would cause the computer to crash.
  - Due to a bug, the Editor would crash on MC68000 when level was written
    back, or when using a keyfile. This is now fixed. This *also* should
    fix the illegal memory hits on A3000/A4000 with keyfile.
  - Disabled some menus by default to avoid the user selecting the items
    which are unavailable.
  - Finally added conversion routines for Worms levels. Both Worms 1 and
    Worms DC (AGA) levels are supported.
  - Disabled the dos-requesters during help file search.
  - Now the window positions and dimensions are stored for each level
    size individually. Prefs file had to be extended.
  - Minor changes & optimizations.

V1.2 (12-Oct-96):
  - Added spare bars options for Ben.
  - Misc little changes.

V1.1 (26-Sep-96):
  - Second public release.
  - Fixed a date mistake in the dedication.
  - Fixed that stupid bug causing scrambled gfx. The bitmap structure was
    filled with wrong mem-pointers when d3 contained non 0 in the upper
    word. Sorry about this one.
  - Now also looks in DEVS:Keyfiles for the keyfile as recommended.
  - Forgot to remove two strings.
  - Started coding on 'Create Worms Level', but still unfinished.
  - Reformatted Installer script to be more style-guide conform.

V1.0 (17-Sep-96):
  - Small fixes in some texts.
  - Updated Installer-Script: Can now also install Lemmings 2 if the patch
    archive is present. Also will unpack the demoworlds if such an archive
    if found.

V1.0 (04-Sep-96):
  - First release.

With this menu item you select the Lemmings Tribe  you  want  to  create  a
level  for. As soon as you have chosen a Tribe, an empty world file will be
created, the old world gets erased. Normally, each world file  contains  10
levels, except the Practice 'Tribe', which actually contains of four levels
with of different Tribes  (i.e  Space,  Medieval,  Egyptian  and  Polar  by
default). To change the style of the practice levels, see the @{" L2ED-FAQ " link faq}.

A lot of menu items are disabled until you select a Tribe.

These are the 12 tribes:

                               Classic Tribe
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

This is the Tribe found in the original Lemmings  1  game.  Normally,  this
Tribe  has  only  a  few  fixed Lemming types.

These are: Climber, Floater, Exploder, Blocker, Builder, Basher, Miner  and
Digger,  which  will  be  set automatically, when you create a new level or
world. But you can change this if you prefer to have other Lemmings.

@{b}Special Notes: @{ub}

  Do not try to use an Attractor Lemming in a Classic World. The effect  is
  quite harmless but very funny. Test it, but don't use it in final levels.

  This is the only Tribe where you can use the Blocker Lemming.

I specially enjoy this tribe, especially because of the Sand Container  and
Toggle, which are never used in the original levels.

@{b}Special Notes:@{ub}

  The Sand Container needs some special care: There's  a  bug  in  Lemmings
  that  will  cause  the  game to crash under right conditions: If the sand
  reaches the opening hole of the Sand  Container,  the  game  freezes.  To
  avoid  this  bug,  always  make  sure that the sand can run off the level
  somewhere, or limit the time so that it can't reach this height.  Have  a
  look at the provided levels to get the grip of it.

  Moreover, the Lemh Eyes side  Object  cannot  be  used  due  to  aligning
  problems.

This Tribe has a lot of background graphics. Unfortunately,  there  are  no

  The Plant Catapult is out of order as the action height is 8 pixels above
  the  lower bottom of the Object and so normally, the Lemmings don't reach
  it. The only way to get it to work is to let lemmings fall onto  it  from

Lots of animated objects are in the Shadow Tribe. And, which is  even  more
enjoyable, there are Sand Container and Toggle Objects.

@{b}Special Notes:@{ub}

  The Sand Container needs some special care: There's  a  bug  in  Lemmings
  that  will  cause  the  game to crash under right conditions: If the sand
  reaches the opening hole of the Sand  Container,  the  game  freezes.  To
  avoid  this  bug,  always  make  sure that the sand can run off the level
  somewhere, or limit the time so that it can't reach this height.  Have  a
  look at the provided levels to get the grip of it.

Lemmings 2 allows 7 different level formats, i.e level sizes, ranging  from

you can create smaller ones by dragging the visible size of  the  level  to
your personal favorites.

                        Menu Item: Custom Graphics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

Starting with V2.0 you can design your levels  even  with  a  normal  paint
package. All you have to do is to draw the map, save it as IFF-ILBM picture
into the custom drawer (i.e beach/custom/foobar.iff) and tell the Editor to
use it as Level, place some objects around etc. then save the world and try
to play it.

Some things to remember:

- Get sure about size of the level your going to create  before  you  start
  painting! Note that the dimensions of the graphics must match  the  level
  size!

- Use exactly 4 bitplanes (which is equal to 16 colours).

- Turn off (or free) stencil masks before saving the picture.

- Always save packed iffs (run length) as  the  file  size  is  (currently)
  limited to about 90 KB.

- If you're changing the palette, remember  that  some  objects  will  look
  pretty strange. Try to keep the colours reasonable ;)

- No more transparent background graphics when using a picture. But on  the
  other hand, you may hide objects (except for the solid blocks) behind the
  foreground graphics!

- Clear the block map before  you  load  the  graphics  map  as  you  might
  encounter some background blocks appearing when destroying the foreground
  map. Can also be used as a feature when using with care.

- You can recycle maps by using the same map but different parts of  it  or
  change the amount and type of available lemmings and or move the starting
  point or traps etc.

- When custom graphics are enabled, some features of the Editor will not be
  available anymore:

  - Creating Worms Levels
  - Changing the size of the level (obvious)
  - Drawing with Raw Blocks or Block Elements

                       Menu Item: Create Worms Level
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

This neat feature allows you to convert the current level into  a  map  for
the  famous  game  Worms  by Andy 'Mad? Possibly!' Davidson.

Lots of thanks and regards go to Andy and the holy Betong Asna for suppling
the required informations on the Worms DC levels!

NOTE: This feature requires Kickstart 3.0 or higher and aprox. 220KB ram.

The size of a Worms Map is always 960*350 pixels, therefore  you  won't  be
able  to  create  a  full-sized Worms map out of a Lemmings level. The area
used for the map is determined using the Level Boundaries.

If the width is smaller than 960 pixels, the level  map  will  be  centered
horizontally,  if it's larger, the everything going further than 960 pixels
will be cut off. If the height is greater than 330 pixels, the  lower  bits
are cropped.

Both the old 8 coloured and the new 16 coloured versions are available:

- 8 colours:

  This is the map format of the old Worms released in late  '95.  As  there
  are  only  8 colours available, the Lemmings Editor performs a conversion
  which reduces the colours from 16  to  8  using  a  predefined  remapping
  table.  The  colours  are  arranged  in  correct  order for optimal Worms
  colours.

  8 coloured Worms levels can of course also be used for Worms DC.

- 16 colours:

  Worms - The Directors Cut (short: Worms DC), which is not yet released at
  the  time  writing  (02-Jan-97)  is AGA only and will feature 16 coloured
  maps. What is even nicer, the Maps now may even have two layers, one  for
  the foreground, and a second one for the background, which is revealed by
  destroying the foreground.

  The Lemmings Editor just changes the order of the colours to generate the
  foreground  map,  which  yields  1:1  quality and correct colours for the
  Worms etc. The background layer, however, is drawn in darker  colours  to
  ensure the player to be able to destinguish between the layers.

  If using two layers, do @{b}NOT@{ub} load the graphics into a painting program  or
  similar  and  save  them  back  again  as this will delete the background
  layer and the special worms chunk!

  Do @{b}NOT@{ub} use these levels together with the original  Worms  game  as  they
  will crash the machine.


If you save  Worms  levels  often,  you  may  enter  the  "WORMSDIR=drawer"
ToolType, which will set the default saving path for the filerequester.

                       Menu Sub-Item: Screen Mode...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

Let's you choose your prefered screen mode for  working  with  the  Editor.
Note, that you should NOT redirect the screen using external mode promoting
programs like NewMode or ModePro, as these programs are usually  only  made
for  opening  screens  that keep their size. The Editor however, will use a
lot of different screen sizes, depending on the level size and  the  screen
font.  If  you  want  to  use  a  graphic card screen, use this screen mode
requester and not NewMode!

Please note the following:

1) ECS Machines

  Due to their 16-bit architecture, OCS/ECS machines will  CRAWL  in  Hires
  modes, especially, if you don't have any fast memory.

2) AGA Machines

  If  you've  got  a  flicker  fixer  card,  I  would  recommend   to   the
  Super72: SuperHires-Interlace  mode,  with  is  quite  suitable  for most
  resolutions. Otherwise it's best to go for the  screenmode  you're  using
  for  your  workbench to avoid monitor switching during the closing of the
  Editor's screen.

3) Graphic boards

  The Editor needs lots of different screen sizes from 1280 width to  about
  650  pixels  height.  Choose  a suitable screen mode to support all those
  resolutions. I emerged some problems with Cybergraphics  Software  V40.65
  in  conjunction with Autoscrolling and horizontal screen dragging. If you
  also have these problems, you'd better switch to an AGA screen  mode,  if
  possible.

                      Menu Sub-Item: Min. Menu Height
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

If this item is checked, the editor opens its  screen  with  at  least  the
height to display the menu in one single row. Normally, this will only have
effect on level sizes of 1280x160 and 1024x192. This option  has  a  slight
drawback:  Due  to  the  bigger  size  of  the screen it consumes more chip
memory.

If you disable this feature, the screen will be opened at the height of the
level  plus  the  screen  bar,  so  there  no gap to the end of the screen.
However, this is only true, if @{" No spare bar " link m030004} is specified aswell.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

If this item is checked, the editor opens its screen with normal size, this
means, that the level map fits exactly in this screen.

This had a few drawbacks, so a user (Hi Ben!) told me it  would  be  better
not  to  have  the  windows  overlap.  So  I added the @{" One spare bar " link m030005} and
@{" Two spare bars " link m030006} options, which tell the program to open a  bigger  screen
so the windows fit into that extra space.

No spare bar was default for V1.0-V1.1.

                       Menu Sub-Item: One spare bar
---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

If this item is checked, the editor opens its screen which is  bigger  than
the actual map. Depending on the aspect ratio of the level, some space will
be left free at the bottom (level sizes from 1-5) or the right (level sizes
6 and 7) of the level map. This allows you to place the Raw, Block Elements
and Objects windows in this area, so they never obscure the map.

The size of the bar is calculated from the dimensions  of  the  Raw  Blocks
window.

The only obvious drawback is, that it consumes slighly more chip memory.

screen size. However, Two spare bars creates bars both at the right and the
bottom of the level map.

The height of the space at the bottom is determined from the height of  the
Raw  Blocks  window,  the width of the space at the right is taken from the
width of the window.

it's  old  position,  where  it  was  previously  closed,  unless  you have

---------------------------------------------------------------------------@{ub}

If this option is enabled, the  Objects,  Raw  Blocks  and  Block  Elements
windows  will  open at the current mouse position. This feature can only be
sensibly used when working on a lowres display mode, with just little  view
of  the  whole  level.  Otherwise  you're  adviced  not to use this option,
because it's very irritating.

If you think you want this feature on, you better turn  off  the  automatic
window  opening for the three windows, and open them with the hotkeys, when
you need them.

The behaviour of Trace Mouse might change in futher versions of the Editor.

If you select this mode for the right mouse button, every  time  you  click
with  the  right  mouse  button  on  the  map,  the block or object will be
deleted.

You can only open the menu, if the mouse cursor is on the screen  bar  (i.e

Toggles the visibility of Solid Blocks on the map. Solid Blocks are  blocks
the Lemmings can e.g walk on.

Turning off the solid blocks makes the transparent blocks more visible,  as
they are no longer drawn ghosted.

Note that drawing on the map is only sensible while  actually  seeing  what
you're doing :-)

As you have probably read before, the graphics in the Block Elements window
are  halved  both vertical and horizontal to save space on the screen. This
shrinking process  leads  to  a  unavoidable  loss  of  detail,  making  it
sometimes hard to figure out what it is exactly.

Enabling this feature will interpolate each pixel, normally yielding better
graphics.  This,  however, will take some time to perform. Decide yourself,
which graphics suits you most.
