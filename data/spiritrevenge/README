[I] Introduction
----------------
First of all, thank you for reading.  No, you don't need to read this to
play the game anymore.  I guess there might be maybe one sentence of
interesting reading down here somewhere.

[Ia]  What is this game?
------------------------
This game is a MegaZeux add on world.  Very informative, huh?

[Ib]  What is MegaZeux?
-----------------------
Woo.  Huh, go to http://www.scsn.net/users/dbwilli to find out.

[Ic]  Who am I?
---------------
It doesn't really matter now, does it?

[Ic1]  What I have done
-----------------------
The Barney Files:I Love You, Escape from Planet Red, Rat Race, Z-Wing,
DogFight, Mostly Morphine Powder Strangers, King Rat ]I[ (::shudder::),
Stress Relief Demo, and this.

[Ic2]  Where I can be contacted
-------------------------------
E-mail me with some comments at adhesive@ix.netcom.com
or
send me some cool snail mail at P.O. Box 90523; Houston, TX  77290
or
you can sometimes catch me on irc undernet in #megazeux as yenrab

[II]  Controls
--------------
(H) Spirit Revenge help

(U) Brings up your Inventory to use, the most integral part of Spirit
    Revenge.  See [IIa1] for more on your inventory and you.

(I) Shows descriptions of inventory items.

(G) Gets an item and puts it in your inventory (see above).  See [IIa2]
    on how to pick up items.

(R) Toggles the Smiley Rotate-O-visioN(tm) feature on/off.  See [III] to find
    out what this feature is anyway.

(P) Pause/unpause.

Additional "level" specific keys:

(L) Certain room descriptions

(T) Throw your grappling hook

[IIa]  Your inventory and you
-----------------------------
Your inventory screen looks roughly like this:

---------------------[         Inventory           ]------------------------

Select an item to use in the direction you are facing:

> [Item name]   |[Item picture]

> (ex:) Scissors 8<
> Nothing

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:  There is no inventory item of scissors, so don't go looking for 'em.

To use your inventory, move the player right next to the object you wish to
use an item on, have the player turn to face the direction the aforementioned
object is in, bring up your inventory (see [II]), select the item you wish
to use on the object, and press [ENTER].  If the item used does not work, you
will receive a random message telling you (sometimes rudely) that it doesn't.
If the item does work (fat chance), a message will tell you what happened.

Of course, check out the help in Weirdness for less wordy, more effective
instructions, if you didn't understand a word I typed.

[IIb]  Getting items
--------------------
This is a brand new, never before used feature (see [III]), and very easy to
use.  Following the same method as using an item in the inventory
(see [IIa]), once you are next to an item you THINK you can pick up and
place in your inventory (usually easy to tell, you can touch the item first
and read its description), press G to try to get it.  If you can pick it
up, a message will tell you that it is now in your inventory.  If you can't
pick it up, a message will tell you, if you press G when there's nothing
there, it will tell you.

[III]  Features
---------------
Smiley Rotate-O-Vision(tm):  When you move, the face doesn't just change, it
turns around in 2 1/4 D.  It causes the tiniest of slowdowns in moving (it
uses lockplayer a lot), but since there's no conventional "action" gameplay,
it shouldn't affect the game.  The toggle S R-o-V feature has been
implemented, press R for conventional, 4 way, 2 dimensional smileys, or
press R to return to the land of the 2 1/4 D smiley.

Inventory System:  (no longer) Relatively new, used in many games now
(Weirdness, Crystal Cities, Funky Chunky Monkey to name a few) and quite a
few demos/beta releases as well.  It has a picture of the item beside the
description.

Get Inventory:  Brand spankin' new.  Never before used (and if it is, you
STOLE IT from ME!), added because it's just too easy to select > "Pick it up"
when you touch an item, or just to automatically pick an item up.

Pause:  This uses freezetime to pause the game, so you can stare at something
for a while.  If you're like me, and like to watch stuff in slow-mo; pressing
enter, f2, or esc blocks out too much of the screen.  So this feature was
mainly for me while testing.

[IV] Filelist
-------------
The only reason you would want the filelist is so you know what files you
can delete along with the game.  Hmm . . .  I see . . .

Note: All files in the zip are original, therefore you wouldn't have them.
Additional SAMs are used in the megazeux file, but are not included, since
you probably already have them.
