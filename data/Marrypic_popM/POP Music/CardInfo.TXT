; Here's a new card set for MarryPic iv'e called it Pop Music (1) we do have a
; large range of CD's so even now Pop Music (2) is almost finished.
; We have a few other differant ideas so look out for them.
; Install just put Pop Music 1 into the card drawer and dont delete this text
; because it an't gona go.
; Like to get some feedback on this as to see if it's worth doing a lot more
; this is the only part i hate doc's so no comments on this OK.
