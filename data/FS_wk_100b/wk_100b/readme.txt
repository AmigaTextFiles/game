-------------------------------Weed Killers----------------------------

A short single-player FreeSpace mission, takes about 7 min.to complete.
It's my first mission, so be tolerant enough if you find any bugs.
(If you'll find one(or more:-)), e-mail me at mera.z@seznam.cz)

Installation: Simple extract vortex.fsm and vortex.bak to your FreeSpace\Data\Missions directory.The sounds go to FreeSpace\Data\Voice\Special folder.
That's all !

Note:I have extracted some sounds from FreeSpace 2 demo and used'em in this mission, because I think they're better than the original ones.

Note2: It is possible that you'll find some language bugs and spelling errors. Please excuse my English, because I am from Czech Republic (do anyone know where is it ?:-) and I do not speak English very well.
