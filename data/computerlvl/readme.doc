WHAT IS IT?
-----------

As you probably know by now it's a new level generator for Worms Directors Cut
which allows you to play new types of landscape.

'COMPUTER' is a Computer & Electronics type world unsurprisingly! :) The
landscape is a keyboard with the background being PCB and various objects being
placed around from resistors to disks.

INSTALLATION
------------

Copy the file called COMPUTER.DIY into the directory within the WORMSDC
directory called TWDIY. Thats all there is to it, to play a computer landscape
type just press the left mouse button when generating a level and type COMPUTER.
