@node DISCLAIM "hey look, use it at your own risk"
@{b}@{i}@{u}Disclaimer:@{uu}@{ui} OK. I take NO responsibility for these levels 
causing any damage to your system, your game of Worms, your health or anything 
else, including your pet goldfish.@{ub}

Do not alter any details on the levels. Feel free to include them on CD-ROM archives 
such as Aminet, Fred fish etc. and also PUT THEM IN WORMS 2. Please could you 
e-mail me to tell me,if possible. If any magazines would like to put them on a 
coverdisk then please let me know and always give credit.

Sorry, getting carried away a bit now. They're only Worms levels....but you never can 
tell.
@endnode

@node WHAT "what is this I've just acquired?"

'ello 'ello, 'ello, what av we 'ere then?

WHAT DO YOU THINK DUMMY?! It's a set of seven (yes7) rather good (honest) 
custom levels from @{" Team17's " link TOOLS} Worms.

They were all created using @{" PPaint 6.4 " link TOOLS} on a 960 x 350 image 
size.

Now I don't claim to be no artist so don't go on at me for my lack of artistic talent. 
There just levels I like playing and the must be @{" SOMEONE " link CREDITS} who 
would almost enjoy playing them too.

I am not sure what machines these levels will work on. It depends on the amount of 
land mass in them. They all work on my 6-meg Amiga A1200 but as for other 
machines specs - I don't know.
@endnode

@node INSTALL "so how exactly to I use these wonderful levels?"

@{u}Installation - No problem@{uu}

@{u}Hard Disk@{uu}
Simply copy all the files ending with the suffix " .WRM " into the TWCUSTOM drawer 
in the Worms directory on your hard disk. Easy isn't it?!

@{u}Floppy Disk@{uu}
Once again, copy all the file sending with " .WRM" into the TWCUSTOM drawer on 
either a blank disk or your back-up Worms disk if they'll fit.

Map 1:	@{" Dopus" link DOPUS}
Map 2:	@{" Eh? " link EH}
Map 3:	@{" Suicide " link SUICIDE}
Map 4:	@{" Sunny " link SUNNY}
Map 5:	@{" Surreal " link SURREAL}
Map 6:	@{" War " link WAR}
Map 7:	@{" Workbench " link HARDWB}
@endnode

@node DOPUS "map numero uno"

OK, so it's a little weird. Basically, It's a screen grab of Directory Opus 4. It looks 
strange but it plays well cool (if you pardon the expression)

That's all there is to say.

@{" Levels " link LEVELS}  @{" Next " link EH  @{" Previous " link LEVELS}
@endnode

@node EH "hot maps part deux"

Just a quick doodle on PPaint ended up with this level. The nice blue border makes it 
fun to play just to see them drop into the water.

@{" Levels" link LEVELS}  @{" Next " link SUICIDE}  @{" Previous " link DOPUS}
@endnode

@node SUICIDE "third time lucky"

I WAS BORED. I felt like a bit of mass destruction with airstrikes so I made this level.

@{" Levels" link LEVELS}  @{" Next " link SUNNY}  @{" Previous " link EH}
@endnode

@node SUNNY "sunshine on a rainy day"

My first custom level. Not spectacular but different. Just to see what things looked 
like and get to use custom levels.

@{" Levels " link LEVELS}  @{" Next " link SURREAL}  @{" Previous " link SUICIDE}
@endnode

@node SURREAL "SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY 2 - SHEFF UTD 1"

My second custom level. Again, nothing spectacular. A nice plain , green landscape.
I like to stand on the roof of my little house and blow the S**t out of Worms

@{" Levels " link LEVELS}  @{" Next " link WAR}  @{" Previous " link SUNNY}
@endnode

@node WAR "war, never been so much fun"

AH! One of my favorite custom levels. Best for 2 players, It was created for my and 
my brother to blow the crap out of each other.

This level didn't work on my brothers Amiga Technologies 1200 with 2meg RAM.

@{" Levels " link LEVELS} @{" Next " link HARDWB} @{" Previous " link SURREAL}
@endnode

@node HARDWB "Its hard, so hard, it's tearing me apart"

Another screen grab, this time of my workbench. Again, it looks weird but is fun to 
play.
