QUAKE_FIN - LAST MINUTE NOTES

· In order to install Quake_FIN update, Installer version 44.10 is required.
· The game is still a mixture of Finnish and English eventhough quake.catalog 
  is a full and complete translation. There are two reasons for this: not all 
  strings are included in the catalog and some of the game text is actually 
  pictures, not text strings.
· Quake does not recognize Scandinavian characters. To make the text more 
  readable, I have replaced all "ä" characters with "a"s and all "ö" 
  characters with "o"s.
