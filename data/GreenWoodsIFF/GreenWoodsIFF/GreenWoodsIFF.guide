@node ABOUT "About"

The CHK tiles included in the main GreenWoods archive don't work with the editor. This archive contains IFF versions which should work fine. I've also included my Layouts background and "north" brush, for anyone that wishes to use them. Read the XTR documention for info on constructing tracks.
