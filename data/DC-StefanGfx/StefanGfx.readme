Contents: Graphics for "Diamond caves", 16 colours (directory brush)
          and the converted gfx-file for DC (directory gfx)
Made by:  Stefan Drycksbäck

I wanted graphics that reminded me of the original C64 and Spectrum
versions of Boulderdash, so i made my own. Maybe somebody else want
to use them as well...
