Hey, SWOS-freak!
----------------

This version of Finnish league is now "compatible". all player values and skills
have been checked to work properly, so don't expect any crashes because of this file!
This is the end-of-season'97 datafile.

PS. Just a final note about that you should check from 
Aminet  -> docs/misc/worldcup.lha

It's an Amigaguide document that covers statistics on all soccer world cups 
before France'98. Give it a try!
