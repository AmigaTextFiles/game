That's incredible !!!!

You surely know of some controversies that were born after the
release of SHOWTIME, a new mag by RAM JAM.

SHORTLY: 

Rocketeer, MASE, Flender and Posdnuos, after releasing the last
glorious issue (#16) of THE CHARTS, left RAM JAM to create a new
group called THE SPOOKY FELLOWS.
After a few months a new mag from RAM JAM was released: SHOWTIME.
It was really similar to THE CHARTS because Randy/RJ ripped the
old code by MASE and someone else made little modifications to the
old gfx by Flender.
THE SPOOKY FELLOWS wrote an article to report that scandal to the
scene, because SHOWTIME's authors never obtained from MASE and
Flender the permission to do that, but ACBS/RJ (the suprem boss)
wrote a pathetic answer to tell the scene HE INVENTED RAM JAM AND
THE CHARTS (it's right, and then?) and to tell some false shits
about the ex-RamJammers.
According to ACBS, Randy wrote a new code (without ripping and
using the old one) in few days (wow, what a coder!), so RAM JAM
never stole anything to other people.

OK, you already know this story.
Let's talk about another shit by RAM JAM.
The iff picture you've found on this drawer is a picture done
by FLENDER/THE SPOOKY FELLOWS and that THE SPOOKY FELLOWS were
going to use in a next production.
Why "WERE going" and not "ARE going"... ?!?
Simple: shit happens again.
Just download SHOWTIME ISSUE #02 from Aminet and have a look at
the INTRO. No more words.

THIS IS NOT THE TEARS OF A POOR VICTIM, SINCE I'M NOT AN AUTHOR
OF "THE CHARTS" AND I'M NOT THE AUTHOR OF THAT IFF PICTURE.
YOU CAN BELIEVE TO MY STORY OR YOU CAN THINK I'M A POOR CRAZY MAN,
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE INFORMED OF WHERE THE SCENE IS GOING.

That's all.
