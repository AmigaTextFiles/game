@{b}Achilles' Heel@{PLAIN}
A PVD Typhon-class cruiser,
the Achilles, goes down shortly
after you arrive on the scene.
Too late... this mission has
suddenly turned into a scramble
to protect a Leviathan-class
cruiser assigned to protect the
ill-fated Achilles.

Note: The primary objective
cannot be completed.

@{b}All Teams At War@{PLAIN}
This is a very small, simple mission.
All you have to do is destroy the
enemy team, which includes those
other people in your game. No
capitol ships involved.

@{b}Well of Wishes@{PLAIN}
This mission is still in beta. (Being
properly balanced) It's a simple
strike on a HOL cruiser without too
many surprises, seeing as most MP
players I've met don't like the story
suddenly twisting while they
chant away to each other.

@{b}Attack!@{PLAIN}
A group of renegade terrans have
captured the Executor, the newest
and most powerful of the GTA's
Orion class battleships. They have
also stolen the prototypes of the new
LR-23 shock cannon and are trying
to make them compatible with the
Executor's turrets. If they suceed,
then this ship will be unstoppable and
will surely do tremendous damage to
the GTA fleet. The prototypes are
inside the Executor. The Executor
must be destroyed so later on
freighters can come and salvage the
prototypes from the wreakage of the
ship. This is where you come in.
