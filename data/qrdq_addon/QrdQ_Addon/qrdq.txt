(1) Introduction

Well, here it is - finally!

Ladies and gentleman, I've left you suffering long enough! Here is what you've
been waiting for so tensefully lately: Quake redone Quick - The Movie. I
apologize for all the delays and wrong promises, and believe that the result
was most probably worth waiting for!

Yet, I have to address a few people with thank-sayings at this point. First
of all, I want to thank the Academy, for making all that possible! Thanks to
Jesus, and thanks to mom and dad ...

*needle scratching over the record*

Seriously, welcome to Quake redone Quick - The Movie! With this release, you're
holding in your hands a damn fine piece of Quake-machinima and -gameplay,
proving how to play through the whole game on the hardest possible skill level
in only 13:11 minutes! Having doubts? Well, I suppose you don't. There's been
similar stuff from the QdQ team several times before. Anyways, if you enjoy
extraordinary dull puns from speedrunners who pitch their girly voice to match
that of a space-marine, you've come to the right place!

Originally I wanted to write something personal here, like my first thoughts
after finishing this project, but unfortunately I did not write them down in
time :) There is a small history-section in the FAQ that also comes with this
release though, for those who are interested.

But now, I'll just shut up and let you explore the release by your own. Have
fun and enjoy Quake redone Quick - The Movie!


(2) Installation

(2.1) Quick overview

Windows / MS-DOS:

1) Find your main Quake directory
2) Create a sub-directory named "QRDQ"
3) Extract everything you've downloaded into that directory
4) Run INSTALL.BAT

Linux:

1) Extract the downloaded archive: tar xzvf qrdq_linux.tgz
2) Run the shell-script: ./setup.sh
3) Optionally remove the now unneeded install script: rm setup.sh
4) Start Quake using the command-line parameter "-game qrdq"

Amiga:

1) Extract the LHA archive you've downloaded
2) Click the QRDQ_AMIGA_INSTALL icon, or run the batch-file manually
3) Follow the instructions on the screen
4) Start Quake using the command-line parameter "-game qrdq"

(2.2) Details

In order to install Quake redone Quick - The Movie, you will first need to find
your main Quake directory. It probably has the name "Quake" and contains such
items as your Quake executable programs (QUAKE.EXE, GLQUAKE.EXE etc.) and your
ID1 subdirectory. You should make a subdirectory of this main directory. Give
it the name "QRDQ".

Various archives are available for your download. Each of them includes several
batch- and text-files, as well as some executables. Here is a summary of the
different downloads. It reviews the contents of the archives and shows how you
can handle any upgrades you make.

1) QRDQ_FULL.ZIP   - This is everything in one bundle.
   (12.2 MB)         
   QRDQ_FULL.DZ      It consists of a QRDQ.PAK containing the movie along with
   (8.13 MB)         sound-fx, the first-person demos and various extras. Unzip
                     everything into your QRDQ subdirectory, and run the in-
                     staller by calling INSTALL.BAT. Further instructions
                     follow.
                     
                     Total size of installation: 65 Mb

2) QRDQ.ZIP        - This is the main movie release.
   (9.48 MB)         
   QRDQ.DZ           It consists of a MOVIE.PAK containing the movie along with
   (6.89 MB)         with sound-fx and various extras. Unzip everything into
                     your QRDQ subdirectory, and run the installer by calling
                     INSTALL.BAT. Further instructions follow.
                     
                     To add first-person demos to this release, download
                     QRDQ_1311.ZIP and unzip it into your QRDQ subdirectory,
                     thus placing the FIRST.PAK the upgrade contains alongside
                     your existing files. Then run the installer once more.
                     
                     Total size of installation: 53 Mb

3) QRDQ_1311.ZIP   - These are the plain first-person demos.
   (3.38 MB)         
   QRDQ_1311.DZ      It consists of a FIRST.PAK which contains the first-person
   (1.81 MB)         demos and the menu, and which can be run independently -
                     on any platform. Unzip it into your QRDQ subdirectory, and
                     run the installer by calling INSTALL.BAT. Further
                     instructions follow.

                     If you're not running Windows, you'll have to rename
                     FIRST.PAK to PAK0.PAK instead, and run Quake using the
                     command-line parameter "-game qrdq".

                     To add the movie demos to this release, download QRDQ.ZIP
                     and unzip it into your QRDQ subdirectory, thus placing the
                     MOVIE.PAK the upgrade contains alongside your existing
                     files. Then run the installer once more.
                     
                     Total size of installation: 13 Mb

4) QRDQ_ADDON.ZIP  - This add-on includes additional files which enable speech-
   (1.52 MB)         support for the movie- or the full version of QrdQ.
                     
                     It consists of a SPEECH.PAK that contains the extra mate-

                     the SPEECH.PAK the upgrade contains alongside your exist-
                     ing files. Then run the installer once more.

                     Total size of installation: 16 Mb

5) QRDQ_LINUX.TGZ  - This is the full-version release for Linux.
   (11.2 MB)         
                     It consists of an install-script SETUP.SH and all the re-
                     quired data wrapped together as PAKTREE.TAR. Extract the
                     archive and run the installer by calling SETUP.SH. Further
                     instructions follow.
                     
                     Note: the install script also requires "mpg123" and "sox",
                     two additional outer-house utilities which can be
                     retreived through the following websites:
                     
                     Homepage of "mpg123":    http://www.mpg123.de/
                     Homepage of "sox":       http://sox.sourceforge.net/
                     
                     After the installation finishes, run Quake using the
                     command-line parameter "-game qrdq".

                     Total size of installation: 64 Mb

5) QRDQ_AMIGA.LHA  - This is the full-version release for the Amiga.
   (11.7 MB)         
                     It consists of an install-script QRDQ_AMIGA_BATCH and all
                     the required data stuffed together in two subdirectories.

                     Note: the install script also requires "mpega", an addi-
                     tional outer-house utility which can be retreived through
                     the following website:
                     
                     Aminet:	http://www.aminet.net/
                     
                     After the installation finished, run Quake using the
                     command-line parameter "-game qrdq".

6) QRDQ_ADDON.TGZ  - The add-on, compiled for Linux. It consists of another
   (7.18 Mb)         install-script SETUP.SH and the occasional PAKTREE.TAR
                     containing the new data. Call the shell-script and follow
                     the instructions on the screen, and as soon as you fire up
                     QrdQ after that, all the new features will be available.

                     Total size of installation: 37 Mb

7) QRDQ_ADDON.LHA  - The add-on, compiled for the Amiga. It consists of another
   (7.90 Mb)         install-script QRDQ_AMIGA_BATCH and the occasional sub-
                     directories containing the new data. Call the batch-file
                     and follow the instructions on the screen, and as soon as
                     you fire up QrdQ after that, all the new features will be
                     available.

                     Total size of installation: 37 Mb (temporary: 42 Mb)

8) QRDQ_DELUXE.ZIP   - This is the "deluxe" edition of QrdQ.
   (13.7 MB)         
   QRDQ_DELUXE.DZ    It consists of a QRDQ.PAK containing the movie along with
   (9.65 MB)         sound-fx, the first-person demos and various extras, as
                     well as the SPEECH.PAK which usually only comes as a
                     seperate add-on. Unzip everything into your QRDQ sub-
                     directory, and run the installer by calling INSTALL.BAT.

                     Total size of installation: 80 Mb

Note: Always apply the question to replace existing files while you're making
      upgrades to QrdQ, i.e. by adding the movie-version to the first-person
      demos or the other way around. All files which have the same name do
      usually also have equal content! Oh, and of course an upgrade to the
      full-version does support every feature of the 'plain' full-version, and
      can also be combined with the speech-add-on. So if you're unsure wether
      to start with the huge 11 MB download right away, just get the version
      you are more interested in first.

(2.3) The menu interface

The run is played from a menu interface, so that you can choose to play the
whole run, or individual episodes, or individual levels - optionally in re-
filmed mode. Using the menus should be mostly self-explanatory, except the
super-duper-secret menu which only appears once you type the ultra-mega-secret
code :)

I also included some commentary on the demos that you may wish to turn on and
read if you want to know what I have to say about the levels.

(2.4) Option keys

There are several special keys you can use whilst a demo is playing:

[F1]  decrease viewsize
[F2]  increase viewsize
[F3]  turn volume down
[F4]  turn volume up

[F5]  lower detail level
[F6]  higher detail level
[F7]  change brightness                (GLQuake: change water-transparence)
[F8]  toggle performance-graph on/off  (GLQuake: toggle shadows on/off)

[F9]  advance to the next level (e.g. if playing an episode run)
[F10] stop playback and return to the menu
[F11] start/stop menu sound (no effect during playback)
[F12] quit Quake immediately

I guess that F9 and F10 will be most important for you; everything else does
only exist for the case that you disagree with the default settings ;)

(2.5) Known playback problems

There are no known playback problems as of yet. There ARE however a few limit-
ations I'll point out here:

- There's no Mac version. Only the first-person demos will play back properly
  on a Mac.

- MS-DOS users may want to get CWSDPMI first, in order to increase DPMI memory
  (of which Strange Utility eats quite some). It's only a small tool, and you
  should be able to find it easily by doing a quick net-search.

- The installer has very limited ways of making guesses on previous attempts to
  install QrdQ. That means that it's quite simple to make it screw up. In this
  case, it makes sense to delete the whole content of your QRDQ sub-directory
  and restart the installation process from sratch.
  This does also mean: don't push it too much. Don't force it to do abnormal
  things when you already know that it's wrong.

- I am not responsible for any errors or bugs within the Linux and the Amiga
  build of QrdQ. I will forward any problems, questions and bug-reports to the
  responsible persons though.

(6) Last words

I want to say thanks to everybody who helped me with this project, and be it
alone by not claiming me mad :) There're just too many to mention right now,
but if can't find yourself below and consider yourself a friend of mine, you
wouldn't care anyways :)

A special mention deserves Johannes Bock, who always encouraged, criticized
and listened to me. Without you, I might have dropped the whole project a long
time ago. You have my bow, old fellow.

Then there's Ilkka, who hosted one of the most awesome events in my life:
SpeedCon 2000. I had a really great time in Finland, and all of you QdQ guys
just rock in your very own way!

Of course I can't talk about SpeedCon 2000 without mentioning it's follow-up,
SpeedCon 2001! So peace also to Marlo and the whole Celle massive which gave
me and everyone & everything else there helluva great time, too.

Some of you also introduced me to a couple of "wicked" Drum'n'Bass artists &
tracks, which have their place in my heart ever since.

Thanks also to the whole PlanetQuake staff for hosting me! No matter if you are
still working for PQ or not, your support has always been overwhelming. Thanks.

Big-Ups from the 62 crew: keep these Soul Parties alive!

Finally, the one and only: Lina, for making me stronger, and the other tiny
things a man requires from time to time... You were so tolerant concerning
Quake, even if you could have made me stop it if you wanted... One Love.

I want to kazumsihtrofdogknaht, since that's what keeps me alive.


Comments are very welcome: <mailto:Nagasaki@PlanetQuake.com>

I hope you enjoy my run!
