(1) Linux- and Amiga-specific extensions

With the conversion of QrdQ - The Movie to Linux and for the Amiga, a few
changes had to be made. First off all, we had to replace the work of
StrangeUtil by other applications, which forced us to make some compromises.

Basically, we took a PAK-compiler and a MP3-decoder for each platform, in order
to call them via the respective install-scripts and such replace the work of
StrangeUtil (which worked out quite well). Due to some complications with the
available tools though, we had to include all of the QrdQ data "as is", which
means unPAKed and accessible to anyone. And even though our scripts usually
wrap up a PAK file during the installation, the fact that all the seperate
files are placed "naked" (i.e. vulnerable) to the harddisk first doesn't feel
very comfortable at all.

Another, more serious, task was the conversion of FIXLOOP.EXE which had to be
made. The latest version now supports the choice between 11Khz and 44Khz
samplerates on both platforms, which is an exclusive feature that is missing
under Windows :)


(2) New utilities used

These are the tools which come into use under Linux or at the Amiga:

1) Not included - get them by your own!

  Linux: mpg123 <http://www.mpg123.de/>
         sox <http://sox.sourceforge.net/>

  Amiga: MPEGA <no URL given - see below>

  Used to convert the MP3s to WAV.

  You'll have to get them first if you don't have them installed already.

  Linux users which run one of the latter Red Hat packages might very well also
  have "mpg123" and "sox" already, as they're coming with Red Hat 6.2.

2) Included in the download - you don't have to bother.

  Linux: Qfiles from the Qutils collection <http://openquartz.sourceforge.net/>

  Amiga: Qtools <no URL given - see below>

  These progs build the PAK files containing all the data.

  Qtools is freeware and all of it's belonging files are kept in a subdir of
  the AMIGASTUFF drawer.

  Qfiles had to be modified slightly in order to make it work properly with
  command-line parameters. A copy of our modified Qfiles source can be found at
  <http://www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?/planetquake/illmind/misc/qutils.zip>

  (just for the lawyer ;)

  There are no seperate webpages for MPEGA or Qtools given, but you should be
  able to retreive them through Aminet <http://www.aminet.net/~aminet/>


(3) More thank-sayings

Of course, I have to express my thanks to the two guys responsible for these
excellent conversions:

Robert A. Seace (Linux) and Thomas Veress (Amiga)

Robert firstly "hacked" himself into QrdQ in order to make it run on his Linux-
machine, and such brought up the idea of converting it in the first place.

Thomas on the other hand sent me a trickdemo for my site when I noticed that
he actually was an Amiga-Quaker, who must be as scarce as white elephants
nowadays. Beeing a nostalgic child of the Amiga era myself, I was quite
enthusiasic hearing about the possibility to do a Amiga-conversion as well!

A huge "fat-ass props" may be spoken out to both of you for doing all that,
and beeing both patient with me and my lazyness (most often due to real-life
issues) and still trustworthy when it came down to necessary tasks which had to
be solved.


(4) Open questions? 

If you still got questions about QrdQ in general, send some e-mail to
Nagasaki@PlanetQuake.com, and I'll try to answer as soon as possible.

If you your question is specifically related to the Linux- or the Amiga-
version, I'd be glad if you could straight up step into contact with the guys
who know what they are talking about:

For Linux-related questions: Robert A. Seace <ras@magrathea.com>
For Amiga-related questions: Thomas Veress <COJO-D@gmx.de>

And now I hope you enjoy my run!
