Hello fellow Wormers,

  "Ohh Jesus, another DIY level for WormsDC", I hear you say, and you would
be absolutely right!  But this one is quite cool I think (excuse the
modesty!!)

  It's a Candy-Land, based on all things sugary and sweet.  To be honest, I
am NO artist, but when (after about 3 months of tweaking) it was finished I
actually surprised myself.  It just goes to show what you can do with
PPaint 7.1, a lot of time and, err, some (slight) initial inspiration from 
the Playstation's Candy-Land.  After browsing the Internet for some decent 
DIY Landscapes, I was dissapointed to only find about four that were lucky
enough to remain in my prestigious (yeah, right) TWDIY drawer!  Some of
which were CHESS, RUINS, VEGGIE, and EGYPTION.  So thanks to the people who
made those!

  In this archive (which ofcourse you have just downloaded...haven't you?)
is also another Worms goodie; a Cheats menu.  This is a single executable
file which brings up a GUI allowing you to view ALL the cheats in WormsDC!!

TO INSTALL, COPY THE CANDY.DIY FILE TO YOUR TWDIY DRAWER
AND COPY THE WORMS-CHEATS EXECUTABLE TO YOUR WORMSDC DRAWER....Simple


  Well, that's about it!  Ohh yeah, just one more thing, this level is
E-Mail-WARE : Yes, PLEASE, please E-mail me, to criticise, socialise or to
just give me ideas for a new DIY level, or better still, to share your own
with me (I'm sought of collecting them).  Also, if anyone wants the Template
file for Candy-Land (and the mountain colours etc) simply E-Mail me!
Oh yeah, could someone please inform me when this illusive WormsDC
Upgrade-Patch is being released by Andy Davidson; some quite serious bugs
need fixing!

E-Mail : cmsppric@livjm.ac.uk          (Paul J. Price)


NB : If anyone uses PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), and wants my public key,
it is at the end of this readme.  The readme inside the actual archive is
also signed if anyone wants to check (ofcourse, but then there's the issue:
is it actually my public key : well E-Mail me directly to get a copy or,
err, tough!!)

Anyway... Enjoy, have fun, and be happy people!   Bye           (15/9/98)
