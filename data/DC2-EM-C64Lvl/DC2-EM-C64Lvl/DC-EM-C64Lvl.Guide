Short: Fixed and Covert for Diamond Caves II
Author: Markus.Bordihn@GmX.de
Uploader: Markus.Bordinh@GmX.de
Type: game/data

Because DimondCaves II is now FREEWARE an it have a better Grafik, so I convert
this Files from Allan Rasmussen to this files, which work 100% with DiamondCaves II.
This was hard work, because you must select every level alone, because the Import fnkt.
dont worked which DiamondCaves I Files correct.

Install: Start the Leveleditor and select, Import Levelgroup, then select the File in the
EM-Bobby.lvl Directory. Thats all !


PLEASE NOTICS, THIS LEVELS WAS DESIGNT, MAKED AND PLANNED BY ALLAN RASMUSSEN.
