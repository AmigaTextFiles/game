Welcome to the PuzzleBOBS's graphic reference guide.


This is a documentation which explains deeply how prepare a Configuration set for 
the PuzzleBOBS game.
This contains a text document and some pictures in which there are examples of PuzzleBOBS's
graphic elements. 
PuzzleBOBS is a low level configurable game which allows to change its look and behaviour, 
without lose its action's speed. 
See the enclosed docs about its characteristics.
In future, if you decide to support graphically the PuzzleBOBS's development, i will send 
you a configurable demo. 
Because this documentation can have errors or few clear concepts will be in future reviewed
and improved so if you find imperfections or if you don't understand some concepts i will 
happy if you report them to me.


Thank you very much for your interest in PuzzleBOBS graphic development.
