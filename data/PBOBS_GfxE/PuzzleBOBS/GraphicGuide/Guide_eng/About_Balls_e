About special balls in PuzzleBOBS
---------------------------------


As you know in PuzzleBOBS you can have a lot of balls with different characteristics.
Each levelset can use all special balls which the game foresees or can use only a part of them.
If you have a limited number of balls and the levelset needs a bigger number of them you will
not be able to use this levelset.
For this reason is better to have config files that have all the special balls and a large 
number of normal balls, in this way you will be able to use without problems all types
of levelset.
The first step is to declare in your config files how many balls you use and this number must
coincide with balls that you draw in graphic data array.
Then you have to assign the type to your balls. Remeber that the first ball coincides with
the first ball you have draw in the top of graphic data chunky array.The last with the bottom.
Now you can use compatibles levelset that will search in your config-files balls that they
need and they will be able to link their types to yours.

To assign the types you have only to put the relative number in sequence from the biginning
of config files types part.

These are the values, and we must consider "normal" only the NORM type. All others are special.

1=NORM		This is the normal ball. You can have a lot of them.
2=BOMB		This is the bomb that is able to cause explosion of all its tangents.
3=BOMBX		This is	the bomb that cause explosion of no interrupt orizzontal lines.
4=BOMBY		This is	the bomb that cause explosion of no interrupt vertical lines.
5=INERM		This is a ball unarmed that only bombs could eliminate.
6=GAS		This is a ball that when free goes to the top of level and when arrives there
		explodes itself.
7=ARCOB		This is able to explodes all balls in level that have the same color of first 
		ball collides with.
8=SUBSTAIN	This is able to carry balls and only if is free from its tangents explodes.
9=AIM		If collides against another bobs give you an aim line.



In your config file and levelsets could be only one ball of each special type and they can 
have a large number of normal balls. For example if you want have 8 normal balls you could 
put eight "1" numbers in your config files.

1	;eight normal balls.
1
1
1
1
1
1
1
2	;a bomb
7	;a arcob.
0	;zero if you don't use others.
0
0
0
.....

Is also possible:

1	
1
1
2
7
1
1
1
0
0
0
0
......
This allow you to link balls in graphic data with balls in game.

Finally a wrong method.
1
1
1
2	;OK this is a BOMB.
2	;so this is a BOMB.
1
1
1
0
0
0
0
......

This way is not totally wrong but the second BOMB ball will never be used.
