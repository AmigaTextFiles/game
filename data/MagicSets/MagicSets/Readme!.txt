What's that?
-----------
3 nice 256-colour sets for the great WB-game 'MagicNumbers' (by Magic Software).
Made using PersonalPaint by Richard Kapp.

Installation:
------------
Just copy the images in the 'Images'-Dir of your MagicNumbers-drawer.
Then select the set using the options menu of the game.

That's it. Have fun!
