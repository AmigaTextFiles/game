Hints and tips
--------------

* The structure of the levels can change depending on which day it is. Some
	exits may not be available on certain days. If an energy barrier is
	blocking off access to part of a level, it may not be on a different day.

* SAVE SAVE SAVE. Not only is the game difficult, but MZX has bugs. Save,
	keep multiple saves and keep saving.

* Even after your health drops to zero, you still have a small window of
	opportunity to use a lifeweb to restore your health. Do so.

* Keep at least one lantern around until you need it. After then, it becomes
	expendible.

* Energy barriers can be cut with a certain weapon found later on in the
	game.

* There are two endings to the game.
