The files in this folder are designed to be used as Skin-Images.

In order to use these new images simply copy the directory "JoanJett" to your
"gfx" directory of your ArTKanoid installation  and use the InGame menu as
usual to use them as described in the ArTKanoid Manual.

In case you want to give my work to your friends and contacts PLEASE always
