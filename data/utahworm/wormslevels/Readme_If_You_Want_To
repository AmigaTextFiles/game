Greetings,

During the four years I've been at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK, I have plundered Aminet regularly for mods and samples, and occasionally uploaded a mod or two (the last being a remix of the X Files theme tune, called Sex_LifE.lha). As the end of my degree draws to a close I have decided to upload everything I have got on my hard drive which is vaguely decent in so you can A) have a listen and B) nick the samples :). It a sort of "conscious clearing" exercise, I'm putting something back from somewhere Ive taken a lot. If you see what I mean. Ermm....

Anyway, things are looking up. I've got a a couple of gigs in the offing down in London, DJ-ing, and everyone at Media Records UK arer being very friendly and helpful (especially top bloke Ian D Smith, aka Primax) Media Uk are the producers of Clock, Cappella, Sharada House Gang, Anticappella and loads of other top Euro acts . So I'm gonna try and wangle a job off em :). 

The one thing I have learned : Its not what you know, its *WHO* you know....

Ooh Ahh, Just a Little Bit :)
