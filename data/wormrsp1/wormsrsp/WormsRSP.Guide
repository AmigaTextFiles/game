@{b}***Notice*** This worms replacement sample pack has been finished since the
end of  March 96.  Obviously this has never been released and now I have
modem access I have decided to upload the package to a few BBS's.

A lot of the text within this guide may be out of date***@{ub}

This Worms replacement kit is a replacement set of samples for the game
worms (obvious to some).  Worms as you should know is the hit game of the
last few months from both Team 17 and Ocean.

One of the hilarious aspects of the game are the sampled voices of the worms
and how they react to events (i.e. How a worm shouts "MISSED" if you
incorrectly aim a shot).  Although the samples included with the game are
very funny I thought it would be fun to create some new samples for the
game.

With this in mind, @{"David and myself" link "Creators" 0} got all the necessary equipment together
(Sampler, Microphones etc..) and arranged similiar phrases that could be
substituted with the original ones included with worms.

I have had no access to what is happening in the land of worms (via the
Worms Web Site), but have recently bought the new CD version of CU Amiga
magazine and as you may know they included on the CD their own set of
samples for the game worms.  Although I find the samples funny, the samples
are mixed and matched.  I wanted our samples to be consistant with each
other like the original worms.  To keep the samples consistant I have spoken
all of the phrases in the set, but David will do all the samples for the
next set (when we get round to it).  As I have not accessed the Worms Web
page so I do not know of the sample sets that are said to be available on
the Web site (so it said in the readme on the CU Amiga CD).  Hopefully ours
are fit enough to go alongside these in quality.

If you have any suggestions on how we could make our set(s) better, or of
anything we have done wrong then please contact @{"us" link "Creators" 0}.  If we do more sets then
they can be improved with feedback.

UPDATED NOTE: Looking back on the sample set, I feel the spoken phrases are
comical, but the way in whch we produced the samples could of been done
better, and at a higher pitch.

@{b}Requirements........@{ub}

The requirements are the same as the game states.

To use these updated samples you will need an Amiga with 2MB chip mem. If
you are using a stock Amiga 1200 hundred then everything should be okay,
although older amigas with only 1MB chip memory (such as my mate Andy and
his A2000) will not be able to load the extra samples.@{b}

This sample set has been tested on both:@{ub}

- My Amiga 1200, 28mhz 68030, 2MB Chip, 2MB Fast, NO FPU, 80MB HD.

- My Sixthform's Amiga 1200, 68020, 2MB Chip, No Fast, NO FPU, 80MB HD.

- David's Amiga 600, 68000, 2MB Chip, No Fast, NO FPU, 120MB HD.

UPDATED NOTE: I have since bought an 8MB simm for my Viper Board.

@{b}Installation........@{ub}

Installation is simple, all you have to do is replace the samples in this
package with your original samples (it is advised that you replace to your
back-up copies of your original Worms).

For a comparison check, WORMS disk 2 (of which is full of samples) has
around 62k free disk space, when you replace the new sample set, the free
disk space will increase to around 78k.  So there is even less chance that
the game will not load if you have a bare minimum memory system (as in tests
a standard Amiga 1200, failed to load worms when large samples were used).

@{b}Creators........@{ub}

Although David and Myself created these, they were very simple and only took
about 2 nights to complete.  Although we may release another set in the near
future (most likely) all of the voices on this set are my own (I hate the
sound of my own voice, thankfully the speeding up of the samples will tint
any sign of my Norfolk accent)@{b}


About myself........@{ub}

I am 20 years old and I am about to finish a 4 year stint doing various
business courses at my local sixthform.  Hobbies include football and
obviously (Amiga) computing.  In the near future I hope to setup a B.B.S.

I used to be a regular modem user but could not cover the costs that I
incurred so I had to sell-up.  Although if it wasn't for this move I would
still probably own a HD-less A600 (Which I sold to David :-) ).

I hope to get fully online again in the near future (I am now).

About David Meakin (Partner in Worms Package)........@{ub}

David is 18 years old and is studying Media studies at the same sixthform as
for myself.  As said previously, over 18 months ago I sold my old 600 and
since then (on limited funds) I have an Amiga 1200, linked via Sernet to a
CD32.  David likes being creative, playing with a wide range of Amiga
productivity software such as Dpaint, Protracker and various sampling
software (hence his interest in this project).  

To contact David you should send mail to the both of us, via the above

UPDATED NOTE: I don't see David too often these days as he is still at sixth
form and I have since left.  I have also finished sixthform and I have
replaced my home address with the Email address (shown above).

@{b}Disclaimer........@{ub}

This sample set is provided "as-is" and myself and David Meakin accept no
responsibility for damage to equipment or any loss of data (remember to use
a backup copy of worms) resulting from the use of these samples.  Although
the only thing that could happen, which is not directly related to these
samples, is that you could accidentally delete your worms samples from you
master disk.  So always use a back-up (Most of you will probably being
playing worms of a HD which is a backup of your master disks).

@node "Distribution" "Distribution"
@{b}Distribution........@{ub}

This pack should be distributed freely and no commercial gain should be made
from its distribution.  If a fee is to be paid for the service of
distribution (i.e. Public Domain Library), then no more than 3 pounds should
be paid (although you would do well to make that for one disk).  Also no
modification should be made to the items in this pack, and the pack should
remain unchanged and in its original archive if distributed.

If you live in the Norfolk area of England then you may be interested in
the Amiga User Club situated in Felbrigg.  Here Amiga users meet at the local
village hall and are able to bring along their machines and do the done thing
at meetings (such as 8 Player Xtreme racing tournaments or helping others
with hardware problems etc...)

The club meets every Wednesday at 7.30pm, although they are having a
christmas break a few weeks into December and will resume the meetings into
mid January 1997.  If you are interested, and need help getting to Felbrigg
(I know I did) then Contact John on (01263) 515056
