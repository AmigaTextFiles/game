@node intro "Introduction"

Welcome to the second release of my Ace Traxx.

Here are four completly new tracks and three older one. The three older
one are included, because they are a little bit updated. So please install
them again, if you have installed previous versions.

In the "misc" drawer, you can find a @{"Laptimes" link lap} file, and a @{"Season" link seas}
file.

Big thanks goes to David J. Cruickshank, for sending me his excellent "Skull
Army" tracks.

Sorry for my poor english.

@node lap "Laptimes"

In the "misc" drawer is a laptimes file, which contains records of me and my
"co-designer", merged with the laptimes from David J. Cruickshank.

The names in the laptimes:

ACE = Ilija Hodak
RIP = Nenad Mitrovic
DJC = David J. Cruickshank

It`s easy to manipulate the laptimes with an hex editor, but please don´t do
this, because it`s not fair. Respect the other people, which drives hard to get
a lap record. Be a man and don´t cheat like a whimp. 

@endnode
@node seas "Season"

There is a Season file with the Ace Traxx cup in the misc drawer.

The cup consists of the seven tracks i made.

@node Install "Installation notes"

@node Author

I am a 18 years old yugoslavian, who lives in Germany and still goes to school.
See a @{"picture" link author.iff/main}.

My "co-designer", Nenad Mitrovic, is a very lazy, 15 years old guy, who doesn´t
own an Amiga, but often hangs around at my house. Actually he designed only one
track (Ace Duplo 1). He gave me a plan of the track, and i transposed it to the
game.

You like my tracks? You designed some too? If you answered both questions
with yes, then send me a disk with your tracks and in recieve you will get
a disk from me with my newest tracks.

I hope you understand my crap english.
