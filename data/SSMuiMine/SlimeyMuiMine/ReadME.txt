SlimeyMuiMine
-------------
This is a Facebutton set for MuiMine. It features
a green slimey-like smiley ;)
I have drawn it with PPaint.

Installation:

Copy FaceButtonImage_RIC_ss to MuiMine/images/
and choose from the menu 'Setup Imagery'. Then
select for the 'Start Button' my set. It's simple!

I hope you like it!
