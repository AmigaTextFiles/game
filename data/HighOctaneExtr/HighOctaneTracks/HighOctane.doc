What are the High Octane Extra Tracks?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 High Octane Extra Tracks contain 5 new tracks for High Octane and the 
opportunity to install the existing ones, just incase you have deleted the 
files! An installer is included in the package so as to make it easy for 
you to get up and drive. The installer will replace Track1 with the track 
of your choice, I choise Track1 because in the earier versions for High 
Octane, like the one free with A.U.I in December 1994, I think, the track 
slecter did not work properly, this, however was fixed in the new faster 
version. Also, please note that these tracks do not tell the computer where
to go, so you are limited to 2 players, with my new compilation however I 
will make sure the computer is controled correctly.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 To install the High Octane Extra Tracks use "High_Install", this is the 
installer program I wrote myself for this compilation of tracks! You should
be honered to use it! However, please note that on your High Octane disk 
you must had a directory called "Roads" to place the tracks in, the disk 
inself can be called anything you like, but it must be in DF0: when the 
installer askes you to place it in.

Usage
~~~~~
 Once you have installed the High Octane Extra Tracks to your High Octane 
disk all you have to do is reboot placing the High Octane disk in DF0: and 
the track will automatically load.

Options
~~~~~~~
 There are no options, Yet! High Install will copy all the files needed 
onto your High Octane disk.

Disclaimer
~~~~~~~~~~
 This program has been tested by a number of people including me, I 
understand that this file should work and not damage your computer setup 
or equiptment, but I CANNOT be held responsible for HD muckups or any 
other setup/equipment or program muckups.
