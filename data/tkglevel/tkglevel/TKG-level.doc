NOTE: Don't download the fix for use with this, this archive works as a standalone item.

UPDATE

The first version stuck on the Aminet had the text_file and test.lnk files missing, and unbeknown to
me, one of my mates decided it would be a good idea to mess around with the test link file that I
added to the fix, so that didn't work either (cheers pal). But this one DEFINITELY works, as I just
used this archive and the game files listed below to test it. Cheers for being patient, the cock ups
are on my part.

INSTALLATION AND STUFF

As you might have guessed by the imaginative title this is an extra level for Team 17's stonking game
AB3DII-TKG. It needs to be placed wherever you have assigned ab3: to. I also copied all 51 of the game
samples to a directory called ab3:samples/ so you'll need to have the same, and add the minigun.fib to
it. The other files that the game requires to run such as 256pal, 256palette, floortile, etc. should
all be in your editor directory already. If not, I have tested the level with the following files and
it works (you may well be able to get away with less).

In your ab3:includes/ directory, you will need

  256pal                           256palette
  betpts                           BRILPAL
  findsame.inc                     floortile
  newtexturemaps                   newtexturemaps.PAL
  packedtest                       rawbackpacked
  shadepal.aminc                   titlescrnraw1

All of these come with the game.

NOTE: this archive will overwrite your game files if you unarchive it there, so try to unarchive it
      to a safe place, and then install it by hand in your editor directory (or another safe place).
      DON'T OVERWRITE YOUR GAME FILES, otherwise you'll have to reinstall the game if you want to
      play it.

EXTRA STUFF

Also in this archive is an issue of breed talk where Andy Clitheroe explains how to use lightsourced
stuff. All the aliens and objects I've used have come from the game source code with the exception of
the big gun by Daniel Whitten, the ship is the light spacefighter by Nicholas Richard, and the minigun
by Jason Frecknall. The level text was edited using David Gibbs' Text Editor. Cheers fellas.

Although the editor docs say not to use lightsourced stuff, the jetpack, various door opening methods,
and so on, I have and it still seems to work, so for anyone that says that the aliens can't even open
doors, I say check it out!

I can't recommend enough the excellent TKGTurboPatch by Aki Laukkanen and friends which gives my
Blizzard 1230 some much needed help, and the killing editor by Christian Nylén.

This is the first of five levels that I've got planned and I'd imagine the next one should be done in
about a month.

EDITOR TIPS

To zoom in and out within the level editor use the ; and # keys respectively. When using the object
editor, I find it easier to define the faces of an object in the perspective window as you can
rotate the object as and how you want it.

GAMELINKER BUG???

I don't know if anyone else has experienced this, but I've had no joy in trying to add an activated /
destroyed animation to a bitmap object. For a polygon object ... fine, for the default animation for
a bitmap object ... fine, but no way jose for this. For some reason it adds the frame to the default
animation instead (oh smart!). Unfortunately my knowledge of AMOS is a tad on the 'bollocks all' side,
so when I tried to see what was going on with the source code, only to find a message about extensions,
I decided that it would take a better person than me to fix it, any takers?


Email me any suggestions, questions, flames, etc.
