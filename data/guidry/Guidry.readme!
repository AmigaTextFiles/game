Well, after over almost two years of work and such, here is my set of
Megaball 3 boards.  I basically need to get motivated to work on them,
as inspiration doesn't normally come to me easily.  The following people
helped contribute to this boardset:

Jon Guidry
Boards 01-18
Boards 43-50

Ryan Guidry (my 13yo brother - a BIG Megaball fan)
Boards 19-35

Adam Buckman
Boards 36-42
