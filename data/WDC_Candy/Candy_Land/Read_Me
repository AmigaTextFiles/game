  Hello fellow Wormers,

    "Ohh NO, another DIY level for WormsDC", I hear you say, and you
  would be absolutely right! But this one is quite cool I think (excuse
  the modesty!!)

    It's a Candy-Land, based on all things sugary and sweet. To be honest,
  I am NO artist, but when (after about 3 months of tweaking) it was
  finished I actually surprised myself. It just goes to show what you can
  do with PPaint 7.1, a lot of time (boredom) and, err, some (slight)
  initial inspiration from the Playstation's Candy-Land. After browsing
  the Internet for some decent DIY Landscapes, I was dissapointed to only
  find about eight that were lucky enough to remain in my prestigious
  (yeah, right) TWDIY drawer! Some of which were CHESS (the palette
  arrangement could be better though), RUINS, WEIRD, FORTUNE, VEGGIE,
  GANJA, BEASTY, SOUTHPARK and FARM. So thanks to the people who made
  those!  Also, thanks to Daniel Polansky for including my land in his
  recent Worms compilation....Cheers.

    In this archive (which of course you have just downloaded...haven't
  you?) is also another Worms goodie; a Cheats menu. This is a single
  executable file which brings up a GUI allowing you to view ALL (I think)
  the cheats in WormsDC!!

  TO INSTALL,

  -- Use the supplied installer... Because it's quick, easy-to-use
     and it WORKS!!

    Well, that's about it!  Ohh yeah, just one more thing, this land is
  E-Mail-WARE : Yes, PLEASE, please E-mail me, to criticise, socialise or
  to just give me ideas for a new DIY level, or better still, to share
  your own with me (I'm sought of collecting them).  Also, if you have any
  suggestions about "Candy Land" then please e-mail me : ie, Do you want me
  to continue maintaining this land?   Also, E-Mail me if you're interested
  in helping me produce another DIY landscape which I'm in the middle of,
  (along with a few others) it's called "OutDoors".

  HISTORY of "Candy Land"
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Version 1 (15/9/1998)

    -  Oringial release. Ground pattern was not totally seamless, and
       the palette arrangement was not that good!  Oh well


  Version 2 (22/3/1999)

    -  Decided to update this land because of good e-mail response
       (yes okay, so I should have used "Gloop" in the first place!!)

    -  Changed the water to gloop (err, I mean chocolate...yeah)

    -  Changed the Mountain colours (they too are now chocolate!)

    -  Completely changed the sky colours (to match the scene)

    -  COMPLETELY changed the ground pattern (I used the same
       technique to create it, so it still looks similar). It now looks
       TOTALLY seamless (unlike the last one; it was ONE pixel out!!), and
       the pattern now looks better as it is more compact.

    -  The palette transitions have been made smoother for a much better
       look (noticable in the ground pattern)

    -  Some small modifications have been made to some of the objects on
       the landscape (including the cake, lollipop, gob-stopper, and candy
       canes)


  Version 2.5 (This one)

    -  I've introduced a BACKGROUND pattern (which so many people seem
       to want... see NOTE)!!  HAPPY NOW?  I want feedback about this!!

    -  Made subtle (but significant) changes to the mountain colours.
       The far ones are now lighter than the front ones, which are now
       even darker. (The sky hasn't changed..I think I'm happy with that)

    -  Made small 'pixel' changes to the foreground pattern (which I'm
       constantly picking at... I'm a perfectionist!)

    -  Made a big palette change.  The two orange colours are now 'closer'
       together... Check out the lollipops!

    -  Made modifications to the lollipops (to make them look more
       realistic) and also other objects making them 'smoother'.

    -  Introduced an easy-to-use installer (because I was really bored)
       And it actually works!!

  NOTE
  ----

  I have included 2 DIY files; CANDY & CANDY2:

  CANDY.DIY has a background pattern (ie, which is shown when an explosion
  occurs).  CANDY2.DIY does not have a background pattern (ie, every
  explosion makes a complete 'hole' in the landscape).
  I have done this because some people prefer NOT to have a background
  pattern as it is sometimes hard to differentiate between the background
  and the foreground (especially in some DIY's that I've seen).  This is
  not entirely the case with my background pattern, but it is not as
  distinct as I would like it to be (due to palette restrictions)

  At least you can have the choice... :-)
  (I personally use the one with the background pattern)

  Anyway... Enjoy, have fun, and be happy people!    Bye
