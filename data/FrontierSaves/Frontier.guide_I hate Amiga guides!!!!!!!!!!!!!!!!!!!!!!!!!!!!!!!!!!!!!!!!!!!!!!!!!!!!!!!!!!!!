                    How To Install
                    ==============

    Copy the pre-seved games to a blank flopy (or Where ever you keep your games saved.)

    Then Load The Game, and load the position you want!

    And Thats it!!! (easy EH??!!!)

    HINT :- In some games I got into troble with the Law (so be careful!!)
