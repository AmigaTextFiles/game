Short:    AB3d2_XC Easier LNK file - more life!
Uploader: mike@mikech.demon.co.uk
Type:     game/data
Requires: AB3d2-XeniumCore installed (aminet game/data/AB3d2_XC)

This archive contains 3 link files for my AB3d2 levels:

ORIGINAL.TEST.LNK (medipac=40 energy) (as in original archive)
EASY.TEST.LNK (medipac=50 energy)
EASIER.TEST.LNK (medipac=60 energy)

They are identical except for the amount of energy a medipac gives you.

To use, just copy the file of your choice into AB3d2-XeniumCore/Includes/
and rename it TEST.LNK.

You can do this whenever you like (so try with the hardest and go down to
easier ones when you get stuck!)
