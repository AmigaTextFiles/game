A last note:

OK, I've just played through all 16 levels after unpacking
the archive and following all my own instructions so you
should have no problem (assuming adding this file to the
archive doesn't mess everything up!).

Everything seems to work more or less as it should so if
you can't get a door to open or something rest assured I
haven't made any accidentally impossible-to-complete
levels.

A word about the "Water Crash":

Occaisionally the game crashes when you are entering or
leaving water. I *think* this happens when the game tries
to render a frame with your eyelevel exactly on the water
level. In my levels you are almost always either completely
above or completely below water level, and I have made sure
you can only drop into or JUMP out of deep water. This has
virtually eliminated the "water crash", and you need not
worry about it (ie. there's no special "knack" to jumping),
but it can still happen.

The water crash results in some or all of the following:
*ammo goes to zero or garbage for all weapons
*the messages for weapon changes go to garbage
*the sprite graphics and sound effects are corrupted

If this does happen you should stop playing and reset (you
can't fire or kill anything anyway). If you continue or
exit the level and restart it, the computer may crash
nastily - one of those flashing red screens and repeated
failed attempts to reboot which forces you to power down
to reboot.

Don't worry - it *is* occaisional, and it has never messed
up my hard disk (happened quite a bit before I figured out
how to set safe water levels).

Another bug is that sometimes the sound effects go a bit
haywire (I noticed this in my level K - it also happens in
TKG here and there). This is nothing to worry about and
only lasts a few seconds. A blast of noise. Ignore it and
carry on.

That's all for now.

Hope you enjoy it.
