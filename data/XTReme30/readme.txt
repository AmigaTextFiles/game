Thirty years.
Thirty years have passed since the release of Xtreme Racing, as far as I'm concerned the best video game ever to be played in doubles, so much that more or less every week I still play it with my friend Mirco, Magic season and a few single races...and I still come across new and surprising details.
Guys it's time to Xtreme Racing again!
So here is my first circuit, named Xtreme30 on the occasion of the anniversary.
For installation copy the file XTReme30_1.Trk into Tracks, XTReme30.raw into Worlds and XTReme30_1.raw into Layouts.
My best time (without turbo) at the moment is 28:70, with Rozza, the Greatest!
Let me know yours and let me know if there is anyone still playing out there!
Finally endless thanks to Alex Amsel, the mastermind behind Xtreme Racing, follow him on https://claymatic.games
