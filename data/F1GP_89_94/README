The enclosed F1GP-Ed datafiles are recommended for use with F1GP-Ed V2.10
or higher.  All the lap records and datafiles were compiled by:

   John Butler
   25 Fairville Road
   Stockton-on-Tees
   Cleveland
   TS19 7NA
   UNITED KINGDOM

The datafiles are aimed at producing realism.  Therefore the HP of your
car is lower than usual, to compensate for slower computer cars.  The
computer cars are also faster on some circuits than others, so there are
a few different versions for each year decicated to particular circuits.
Hope you find these useful :-)
