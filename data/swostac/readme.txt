I try to make swos as realistic as possible and this evolves the
tactics. The tactics in swos are completly unrealistic so I have
made my own which I think are more realistic.
Just about every 'real' football tactic in football has been
included.

If you think any of my tactics are unrealistic or you have better
ones then feel free to e-mail me at purserr@sbu.ac.uk.

note. My tactics are based on a template which trys to simulate
offside, after lots of practise I think they give a good feel of
how real football is played.

note. The tactics in swos and my tactics do play well against each
other i recommend when playing the computer you put the computer as
in coach mode then give it a tactic, this also has the added bonus
of making the computer harder to beat!

I have included my template to show how far forward strikers can be
placed and how far back defenders can be.
   The last defender shows how deep a sweeper can sit not zonal or
man-marking defenders.
   Enjoy the tactics, they make swos a lot better!
