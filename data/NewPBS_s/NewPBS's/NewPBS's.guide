@node Introduction

As nobody would have expected from the title :) , these are some new block sets
for the game @{i}Pairs@{ui} by Tobias Lenz. Some of them are a bit more difficult to
play, others are (IMHO) easier than the original set. So there should be at
least one suitable for highscore hunters as well as for people looking for a
challenge. Give 'em a try!

@endnode

@node Disclaimer

No guarantee is given for these block sets to be useful for you. I won't take
any responsibility for any consequence of their usage. You use them at your own
risk. If you harm yourself (physically or mentally), your Amiga, the data on
your HD, the relation to your friends or family, then nobody but you is
responsible at full extent.

'nuff said!

@endnode

@node Copyright

Well, I created these block sets, so I allow myself to claim the copyright for
them. Anyway, you can feel free to spread the archive (entirely and in unaltered
form). Give it to your friends, your family and anyone else who might like it.

Inclusion in disk, CD-ROM or online archives, especially AmiNet, is permitted
and encouraged. However, the Microsoft Network is @{u}not@{uu} allowed to carry this
archive without my written permission!

@{u}@{b}Important note:@{ub}@{uu}
You are not, repeat: @{u}not@{uu}, allowed to charge more than a nominal copy
fee for the distribution. Furthermore, this fee may not exceed US$5 or the
equivalent in any other currency.

And talking about money...
I can't and won't force you, but if you want to encourage me to publish further
block sets, then maybe a "small donation"¹ might help. Furthermore, it could
perhaps strengthen my trust in mankind and give you a better conscience :).
FYI: Yes, there are already more of them.

@{i}Pairs@{ui} guide file.

@node Requirements

For the game itself you need a monitor able to display DblPAL, DblNTSC or
Productivity.

To install the block sets, you need just 21892 bytes free HD space for each of
them. Should be no problem, hm?

And of course you should already have @{i}Pairs@{ui} installed somewhere on your
HD...

@endnode

@node Installation

If you haven't already found out, here's what to do.

Simply copy the files ending with @{i}.PBS@{ui} to the Blocks drawer in your @{i}Pairs@{ui}
directory. That's it! From now on you can select the new block sets from within
Pairs. Use the "Load Block Set" item from the @{i}Pairs@{ui} menu, choose the set you wish
to play and off you go.

@endnode

@node Contents

Now, let's see what we've got:

- @{b}MetalMadness@{ub}

  This was my first attempt. A set of blocks featuring simple metallic blocks.
  In DPaint, this one looked rather ok. In @{i}Pairs@{ui}, it turned out to be somewhere
  between @{i}extremely difficult@{ui} and @{i}frustrating@{ui}...
  And for those who don't know why an obvious pair does not disappear: One of
  the two is shaded from the top to the bottom, the other one from the bottom to
  the top. Didn't you see that? :)

- @{b}Misc 1@{ub}

  If you know a better name, let me know.

- @{b}Misc 2@{ub}

  See above.

- @{b}Arrows 1@{ub}

  Consists of two types of arrows in three colors, pointing in four directions.

- @{b}Ethnic 1@{ub}

  Pretty(?), somehow ethnic figures

- @{b}Geometry@{ub}

  Simple set: Circles, squares and triangles in three colors and two sizes.
  Seems to be suitable for children in elementary school...

- @{b}Nations 1@{ub}

  Some European countries, represented by their national car signs.
  (I am not sure whether the term is correct and my dictionary refuses to
  help... so if you know better, feel free to correct me.) The set is not very
  attractive, but maybe it has some educational value...

- @{b}CopperRings@{ub}

  Who said that blocks have to look like, well: blocks? Some motives in rings
  work as well..

And as a remark on the "Nations" set: I could not consider each and every
European country, so I took the ones that came into my mind (The ones I knew the
signs of :).

@endnode

@node Information

Just FYI:

If you want to create block sets yourself, pay attention to the following points.

- You can adjust the difficulty of the set by varying the contrast of the
  blocks. If all of them are red, you can bet it will be hard to finish, no
  matter how different the motives are.

- Do not rely on the appearance in your paint program. Run @{i}Pairs@{ui} and
  see how the blocks look like when "in action". Can actually be a whole
  different thing.

- Create one or more templates , i.e. draw an IFF image with boxes of the
  correct size for the blocks, and fill it with your block motives. If you try
  to go without this, you might end up with a block set that has an incorrect
  appearance due to the wrong size of one or more blocks. If your first block
  (the one in the upper left corner of the IFF) happens to be the faulty one, it
  affects all the others :(. O.K., that would be no tragedy, but not necessary
  to happen, either.

- Have someone else test your sets. He/She might see the problem in your set
  which you didn't. Anyway, you can still say "Hey, they're intentionally
  similar! I want you to suffer!" ;). Or you could comply with his/her wishes
  and rework the set.

- Running out of motives? Just open your eyes, then your door, walk out and
  imagine everything you see in a coarse-grained resolution...

- If you can stand looking at your composition... send me a copy! Or just put it
  into the proper AmiNet directory.
