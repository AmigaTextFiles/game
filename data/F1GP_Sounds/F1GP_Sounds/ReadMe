F1GP Replacement Sound Samples - Aminet Release 1 (6.3.97)

The sound samples (raw format) are stored in 8 directories, each of which
correspond directly to the options in the F1GP-Ed v3 sound samples window.

Filenames begin with an identifier which specifies who the sample is by:

   SW         Steven Whittaker
   CM         Christophe Macours
   OR         Me (sampled from Williams-Renault, via a Renault CD)

Have fun with these samples - some of them are excellent replacements :-)

These sounds can also be found on the F1GP-Ed Web Site:
