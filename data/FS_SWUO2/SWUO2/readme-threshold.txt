ReadMe file for "Threshold" Preview Release

Installation
============
To install the "Threshold" preview release, copy the files to these locations:

gw2-m9a.FSM	--> C:\FreeSpace\Data\Missions\
ships.tbl	--> C:\FreeSpace\Data\Tables\
weapons.tbl	--> C:\FreeSpace\Data\Tables\

note: you may have to create the \tables\ directory.

Running Threshold
=================
To run the Threshold preview release, simply select "Threshold (Part 1 of 3)" in the Mission Simulator.  Make sure that you read through the breifing so that you get everything.

IMPORTANT: If you want to run any Silent Threat based missions, you must remove the two .tbl files from the \tables\ directory.  If you do not, it will cause trouble.
