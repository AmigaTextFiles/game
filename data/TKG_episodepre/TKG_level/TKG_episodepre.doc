This is kind of a preview of some levels I was working on.
At the moment I have little inclination to make any more although I originally
intended to make 16 altogether as one story.
If people mail me wanting me to make more then I will, as long as they can
come up with some ideas too.

Installation:

Make a copy of your TKG game somewhere on your HD.
Dump this archives contents into that directory.
Assign ab3: to that directory.

Story:

You are a Marine on a planet near the edge of populated space.
One day, you are resting in your quarters when the alarm suddenly goes off.

RED ALERT! RED ALERT! RED ALERT! RED ALERT! RED ALERT! RED ALERT! RED ALERT!

You switch the comm system on to find out what's happening, but no-one answers...

The Levels:

The first 3 levels are finished, level 4 is just a small arena with some
creatures to try your new minigun out on...

5 creature types
7 weapons (only 3 in this preview)
A few secrets
Lots of vectobj (ammo boxes, firstaid, guns, 2 creatures, switches)

Misc:

I recommend at least 030 50MHZ.  Level 2 is *very* slow to start with, but it
will speed up a lot once you've picked up the goodies(!).
