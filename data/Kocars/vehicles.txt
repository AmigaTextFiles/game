This vehicles are for use with Knockout2. To use simply copy the files
into your vehicles directory, making sure to rename the files if you 
don't want to delete your old cars. Only a certain amount of cars can 
be loaded into the game so rename the cars that you don't want 
loading. The cars that the game will load must be a numerical sequence
starting with 1. On an A1200 you may find that you can only load 7 
cars, 'cos if you try to load more the game will crash. On machines 
with only 1 meg even less cars can be loaded.
