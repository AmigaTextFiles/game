Short:    Nice XTR Grasslands track
Author:   Tommy@SpyBox.shnet.org (Thomas Rehbein/Phantomas)
Uploader: shoogen@zock.com (Sascha Hoogen)
Type:     game/data
Requires: [Click @{" here " link Req} for Requirements!]

================================================================

I've decided to 'set' the difficulty of my track a bit higher, because
I don't like tracks that are easy to handle. The motivation to drive
those tracks strongly decreases within short time. That's why I've made
this Grasslands track. If you need a challenge, try to beat my laptime! ;)
But driving the track is enough challenge, isn't it? :-)

                               --------------

If you are interested, you can improve my "Phm_TrafficLight.obj" (I'm
sorry it doesn't look good. Or what do you think? :). Well, I have to
admit I rarely work with graphics. I prefer making music!). Contact me,
then I'll send you the IFF file including the "Phm_TrafficLight.obj" and
the "Phm_Camera.obj" (Just a simple camera that can be placed at the
camera positions in your track :)).
You can improve and revise the two or one of the two objects and release
it to the public. Then it can be used within any publically released XTR
track [1]. Please send me a copy of the revised object(s)!
As a matter of course, you can use my objects without improving them.
Just let me know. I'll send you the corresponding file(s) that can be used
within your new track [1].

If you want to base your track on mine, you can do it, provided that [1]
is accepted. You can send me a copy of your track, if you want. If not,
I would be glad about a short message, so I know there's someone out
there working with my track. :)

@Node Inst "Installing the track"

                                @{b}Installation@{ub}
                                ------------

Quite easy: All you have to do is to execute the installation script.
Note: The script won't work if your LhA unpacker can't be found
      within your command path (e. g. the "C"-directory). Either
      make sure that it is somewhere in your command path, or edit
      the installation script and replace "LhA" by the complete path
      of your LhA unpacker.

If the script fails, please contact @{" me " link Author}! Maybe it's my fault
(I hope it is not :)).
Meanwhile, you can install the track manually as follows:

1.)    Copy "Tracks/Phm_Grasslands_1.trk" to your XTR Tracks drawer

2.1.)  Extract all files from the LhA archive (situated in the Tiles drawer)
       to your XTR Tiles drawer

       For example: => Lha x "<path>/Tiles/Phm_IsT1.lha" "<XTR:Tiles/>" <=
       Note:  o  <path> has to be replaced by the current device/directory
                 path where this guide is situated!
              o  <XTR:Tiles/> has to be replaced by the complete path
                 of your XTR Tiles drawer!

2.2.)  Another possibility is to extract all files to the directory of your
       choice - In this case you have to copy "Phm_Island_Tiles1.chk" as
       well as the document manually to your XTR Tiles drawer

3.)    Copy "Objects/Phm_TrafficLight.obj" to your XTR Objects drawer

4.)    Copy "Worlds/Phm_Grasslands.raw" to your XTR Worlds drawer

5.)    Copy "Layouts/Phm_Grasslands_1.raw" to your XTR Layouts drawer

6.)    Copy this guide and the 'File_Id.diz' somewhere to your XTR path,
       e. g. to the XTR Tracks drawer (not absolutely necessary, but
       recommended :); the script will copy the two files to your XTR
       Tracks drawer)

You might wonder: Who the hell is "Phantomas"? ;-)
Well, "Phantomas" is my nickname. My real name is Thomas Rehbein.
I decided to use "Phantomas", because it's a nice pun!

I live in Germany. If you want to contact me, you can write to
"Tommy@SpyBox.shnet.org". I like getting e-mails, so start writing for
any reason (Well, for almost any! ;)).

Music - that's my favourite thing. I primarily create Techno and Dance
modules. Just take a look at the list below.
