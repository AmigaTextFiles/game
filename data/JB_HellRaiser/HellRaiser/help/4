The history
-----------
V 1.0  - the first release. Everything is finished. It's close to
         perfection. only the sound fx need to be updated (coming
         soon, I think).

V 0.85 - I replaced Pinhead's old sound fx, as well as Channard's.
         I finished 5 levels. I'm still working on the tunes.

V 0.55 - I added the first two levels (the pit and labirynth).

V 0.5  - I finished the complete graphix. Added title tune.

V 0.3  - I replaced Terribite with Camerahead (he's just cooler).

V 0.25 - The first version with sound fx (awful) and death sequeces.

V 0.1  - I finished the options-screen.

V 0.05 - The first new graphix.
