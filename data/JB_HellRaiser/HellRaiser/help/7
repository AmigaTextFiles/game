Known bugs:
-----------

I've tried my best to get rid of bugs, but there are 
still some in there: 

1. When in a thin passageway, you can't shoot forwards 
because your bullets hit the wall (same with rockets!)

2. Sometimes the first explosion of the game does no
damage.

3. In Pub screen mode the health display is a little
glitchy.

4. The shading on the player's screen will almost
certainly not work on a real gfx card.

PS. This game is totally year 2000 ignorant, infact it
doesn't care what the date is.
