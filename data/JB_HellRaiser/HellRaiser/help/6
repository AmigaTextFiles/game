Ever noticed how easy it is to cheat
by peeking at the other players screen?

Not any more! With the exciting new
MantaSoft Screen Divid-o-Matic (tm).

This is recommended for 2 player or
team games, as it stops any chance of
cheating.

To make one, simply take a nice piece of
card (like the bit that comes FREE with
every issue of AF if you subscribe!) and
selotape it to the centre of your monitor.

Now simply sit the players on their side
of the divider. Brilliant!
