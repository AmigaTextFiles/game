To run this game you will need:
-------------------------------
· An Amiga (or UAE?)

Well what you have seems to be working fine ;)

· About 1.5megs of FREE chip ram and some fast ram.

(I'm not sure how much fast it needs. 8 megs is plenty)

· Some friends (the more the merrier)

This game supports the parallel port 4 player adapter (not tested) 
and CD32 pads. (2 players can use 1 pad like in PSX Micro Machines)

It has been tested on an A1200 with BPPC603e+ 240mhz/040 25mhz, 32mges fast,
SCSI CD-Rom, 33.6k modem, so it should run on most systems.
I'd recommend at least an 030 though, or it may slow down a little.
