Tips for the levels
-------------------
Level 1 - You certainly don't need tips for this one, do you?

Level 2 - Hide behind the wooden sculptures for success.

Level 3 - You can shoot over the bloody beds, so keep moving and
          do not stand in front of the beds, or your enemy will
          shoot you.

Level 4 - Don't try to shoot over the pits with the bazooka or
          the grenades. The magnetic fields will let them explode
          right before you.

Level 5 - Look in the hidden places for extra energy and health.

Level 6 - There are only a few special weapons in this level. Try
          to get them first and it'll be easy to win.

Level 7 - Don't fire your bazooka in the small corridors, or you
          will get the lemming award for sure.
