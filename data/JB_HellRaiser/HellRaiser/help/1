It is the year 2063 AD.

The world is has been very close to destruction after
WW3. And now, there are only a few survivors.

Meanwhile the Cenobites are discussing what to do.
Pinhead wants to enslave the rest of humanity under
his rule. But the other Cenobites didn't want him
to be the king of the world. What followed was a
civil war in hell.

Though to the fact that the Cenobites can not die,
Laviathon decided to bring their fight to an end.
He transported them into a limbo.
Here it is where they are fighting for power, just
like every millennium,

but this time it's TO THE DEATH
