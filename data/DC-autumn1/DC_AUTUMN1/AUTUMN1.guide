@NODE levels "About the levels"

This level set consists of 15 levels. The difficulty is increasing from 
easy/medium to hard. All levels can be played by one player as well as by two
players. In two player mode use for best results at least resolution 640×512
if you have the possibility. There are also record files included. They show how
to successfully finish the levels in one and in two player modus. If you want to
really enjoy playing these levels DON'T view the record files unless you are
stuck. Although the set includes only 15 levels, you'll play them for quite a
while because they are not easy neither short.

The highscores aren't cleared because otherwise all the record files wouldn't
work correctly (It's the fault of Diamond Caves and not mine). Because you are a
registered user you can clear them yourself using the editor but in this case
some of the record files won't show the correct solutions. Sorry, but it really
isn't my fault.

@{"Install the levels" LINK installation} and start playing!

@NODE installation "How to install this level set?"

The installation is very simple. Just click on the install icon in this drawer.
It's completely automatical. The install program assumes that you have an
assign named DC: You certainly have it if you have the Diamond Caves installed
(otherwise you don't need this level set anyway;-).

@NODE contacts "How (and why) to contact me?"

Since you're reading this document I assume you are going to play (or have
already played) these levels.

In this case I ask you to send me your opinion about my levels. Tell me if you
like them or not. Tell me what you like and what you dislike. Do you think the
levels are to easy or are they to hard? Should the next set contain more levels?
You may add some comments of your own. If you really feel generous and you
really like my levels and want to encourage me in making new ones, you can even
send me some money. I wouldn't reject it;-)


@{b}@{u}Why do I need this responses?@{ub}@{uu}

I intent to design further levels and I need to know how the players like
these levels so that the next set will be better for everyone:-)


@{b}@{u}What do you get in exchange for your responses?@{ub}@{uu}

Everybody who is going to contact me will be mentioned in the next level set.
It's not much but it's better than nothing. And don't forget my eternal
gratitude;-)

@NODE autumn "What is Autumn Design?"

@{b}Autumn Design@{ub} is the name under which I intent to release my amiga products.
This is my first one but it certainly won't be the only one. I'll release
levels for other amiga games (Pacman 96, Crazy Balls, Emerald Mines,...). I
also want to make a graphic adventure using GRAAL but for this I'll probably
need some help (read below). I plan some translations of programs and games to
my native language (slovene) because there is a great lack of these
translations. That's for the plans.

Currently I am the only person in Autumn design but I hope it won't stay like
that. I'm looking for a graphician and a musician.


@{b}What a strange name?@{ub}

It comes from my home town Jesenice. "jesen" in my native language means autumn.
But the name of the town comes from a certain tree. The leaves of that tree are
in the background of the @{"logo" LINK logo.pic/main}.
