Short:  A car for skidmaks2 (Amiga)

welcome the the first of many cars (I hope) that I have made to be 
up loaded on to the aminet. For the first attempt I have chosen to
use the Starbug car that you will probably recognise from Red Dwarf
hope you like it if you do send some mail to me and if I get enough
I'll uppload some more.

to insall copy	starbug.aga
		starbug.set
		starbug.ecs

into the vecicles directory the skid2 draw on your harddisk
and then load the game and drive!
