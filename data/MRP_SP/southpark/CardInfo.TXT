; This is a little cardset that I did up in my spare time. In case anyone reading this
; doesn't know (and I feel it is my duty to inform them), South Park is an American
; cartoon that, in the words of the immortal Cartman, kicks ass. When I wrote this, it
; was showing evey Saturday on Sky 1 at 10pm.
; Compliments would be completely unprecedented, but welcome. Anyone can do this
; stuff.

WIDTH=100
HEIGHT=100
