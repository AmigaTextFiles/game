Burnout is designed to be totally expandable and Vulcan will be
releasing lots of free extra Cars and Arenas to add to the game,
just like the one you now have.

Burnout will eventually recognise 100 arenas and 33 different cars.

We will also be releasing a free ARENA EDITOR that allows you to load any
IFF graphic into Burnout as an Arena, it will also allow you to add
surface elements such as, ground, plummeting voids, instant death
zones and bounce elements and save with your iff image..

These 'own design arenas' can then be public domain and be swapped and
available over the internet for expanding your Burnout game to the full.
