Well, next is a patch I call "BAD GUYS"

You will be able to play all kind of horror movie
bad guys, like Freddy, Jason, Pinhead or Horace Pinker.
I'm thinking about including Candyman and the djinn of
"Wishmaster", but I'm not sure if I can, because I got
that movies only in a german version, and I think noone
wants to hear german samples :(. But hey, maybe I'll
find matching samples on the net.
But no matter if I get that samples or not, it will
sure take some months until "BAD GUYS" gets released.

So, that's it. You can click on "OK" now :)
