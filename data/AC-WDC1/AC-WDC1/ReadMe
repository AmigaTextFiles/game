    I know there are a LOT of WormsDC levels on Aminet,
so why upload some more? Well to be honest, there arn't
a lot of good levels are there? (no offence, there are
some very good ones).

    I actually drew these levels a while ago but and I've
decided to uploaded them to give anyone with the great 
WormsDC a break from the boring old standard levels ;)

  This archive contains the following levels:

   * Russia - This is the first level I did, its a simple
               hack of FOREST.DIY with extra bits.

   * Fortune- This has to be the best level I've done, its
               got nice yellow->blue gradents in it.

   * Magic  - This is an interesting multi coloured level,
               and don't worry, Paul D. isn't in it!


    To install, simply copy everything in the TWDIY to your
Worms TWDIY and the same with TWMOUNTAINS.

    If you want to contact me about these levels (like if you 
think there the best thing since sliced bread or the worst 
thing since QVC) then Email andrewcrowe@enterprise.net.

PS. Special thanks to the authors of these levels:

2001AD.DIY, AMMO.DIY, CANDY.DIY, MRMEN.DIY, VEG.DIY and XMAS.DIY


        May the worms be with you.
