Formula One Grand Prix Backdrops
--------------------------------

These pictures are 320 x 200, 32 colour IFF pictures. They are
pictures to replace some of the existing backdrop files in "Formula
One Grand Prix". To use them you must have a copy of F1GP-Ed v3.30+ by
Oliver Roberts.

The original pictures were obtained from various web sites on the
internet in 24-bit JPEG format.  I then converted them down to the
format required by F1GP using a combination of Photogenics 1.2a and
Personal Paint 6.4.

You may distribute these file as you wish as long as you include this
readme.
