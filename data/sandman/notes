This deck of cards is for the Klondike solitaire game by Reko productions.
The images are Dave McKean covers from The Sandman comic book published by
DC comics.  These covers are intricate paintings and collages and are
considered fine art.  Enjoy!

I used an A1200 w/1230 turbo 7 megs ram, VLAB digitizer, ADPro.

Thanks to Neil Gaiman for writing such a kick ass comic and to Dave McKean
for bringing art back to comics!
