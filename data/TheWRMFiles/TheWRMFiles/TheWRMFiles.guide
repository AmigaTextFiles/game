@node ABOUT "About"

Thirty-three WORMS levels, done over the last couple of years (mostly early '96 - early '97). I got into doing these as a fun way to learn how to use PPaint (ie. draw for five minutes, play for twenty, draw for f- etc.)

The only level I remember having any particular reason for doing was the first I did, called "RUIN". I created it a couple of days after getting WORMS, because I wanted to play an in-door level.

These levels will also work with WORMSDC, but the text (ie. WORM names etc.) will be a little blurred. If this bothers you much, you could alter the palette in an art package to better suit WORMSDC.

@node INSTALL "How To Install"

I don't want to offend anybody, but if you really need to read this, then you may want to ask your doctor to check that you actually have a brain.

Just drag the files with .WRM on the end into your TWCUSTOM drawer (which should be located in your WORMS drawer). Assuming you have a hard drive and a copy of WORMS installed on it, that is.

ACTUALLY! I do have an IMPORTANT!!! point to make - WORMS only recognises twenty-something custom levels, so if some don't show up in the game, try dragging some of the others out of the TWCustom directory and reloading.
