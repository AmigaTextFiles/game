@node ABOUT "Wha?"

3 new custom landscapes & 3 old custom levels (slightly updated) for WORMSDC.

The 3 landscapes are : CYBERVILLE - a Sci-Fi scape with ships floating in mid-air (you won't find that in the official landscapes - sorry just being smug as I think I'm the first person to realise you could do this). FANTASY - Skulls, bones and castles and stuff. GREENWOODS - trees and stuff, based on my XTR GreenWoods tracks.

The 3 custom levels are : COMPLEX - 3 Sci-Fi tower sections with not quite connecting bridges, probably the best level I've done. REDALERT - set beneath some missile launching silos, or something. RUIN - this was my first level and I did it because I wanted to play an in-door battle. Not sure why all the lights are on though, given that the building is half demolished.

@node INSTALL "Huh?"

Copy the contents of all the "TW" directories in this set, into their corresponding drawers in your WORMSDC installation. Now go to the police station and report that your brain has been stolen.

@node ME "..."

Erm...never can think of anything to pad these bits...could point out my post code has been changed (evil post office ran out of numbers in York and for some reason, probably that damn chaos theory, this had to effect mine), but who on earth would notice? Shit it's not like many people ever show much interest in my "work". Anyway, the moment you have been waiting for...
