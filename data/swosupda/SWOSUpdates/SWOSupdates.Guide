This Selection of updates is for use with SWOS 95/96, Euro 96 or 96/97
and any later versions of SWOS which use the same filetype.

You're Thinking: 27 LEAGUE UPDATES!!!! WOW THIS @{"GUY" link "Author" 0} IS COOL.    :-)

Leagues Include: Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany,
Greece, Holland, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Scotland, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, U.S.A, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia.
Europe, Africa, N.America, S.America and Australia.
And the English leagues are correct to 13th september 1997!!!! 

You`re Thinking: But they won`t be packed so they will be huge. :-(

I did not write all these files as some are stolen from pee cee pages
but they said in the doc that you can edit and distribute them so I put
them in here anyway these were not packed when I downloaded them so
I thought you would all appreciate some extra leagues in here.
 
I accept no responsibility for your computer blowing up or doing 
something stupid either directly or indirectly from using these files.
Also if you wanked on your computer when you saw how up to date the 
English leagues are this is also not my fault.

You can update these files if you like but promise me you use a decent
editing program like SWOS ED by Piotr Bieniek.

SWOS is a trademark of sensible software or something like that.
If you have any ideas or noticed any mistakes please tell @{"me" link "Author" 0}.

To Install: replace the files in your data draw of SWOS with @{"my" link "Author" 0} lovely 
brand spanking new ones.

Floppy users: make a copy of disk 2 and delete a file in your data draw
that you think wont be missed eg team.010 (estonia) to make room for 
these files.  but you can find another file that will make room.
DONT`T TRY TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE DELETED LEAGUE WHEN PLAYING 
(beleve me it`s not worth it)

As You can tell this has taken me quite some time to do, so please consider
sending me money in British Pounds but I will take anything as I am a student 
running on a basic A1200 and I seriously need an Accelerator and a decent 
size HD.

@{b}@{u}Hi Ya@{ub}@{uu}

GREETINGS AND INSULTS BIT OF DOC: As people are reading this it gives me a 
chance to tell @{"microsoft" link "Cunts" 0} to fuck themselfs. There done it.

Hello to anyone who listens to new school punk or Hardcore Punk bands
and anyone who go`s to Shake Some Action record shop in croydon.

Just before I go I have to mention @{"KEW=2" link "KEW=2" 0} who are the best PD library in the 
world and I live near them so a quick cycle there supplies me with my food 
for life (amiga stuff)

Happy Playing (with SWOS that is)    3:-)

I don`t like swearing in docs exept in the case of microsoft who are total
