@NODE "introduction" "introduction"

Hello there, and welcome to this, my very first collection of X-Treme Racing tracks. There are four tracks included in this collections (read about them @{"here" LINK "tracks" 0}), which use completely new graphics created by myself from scratch.

@NODE "Installation" "Installation"

Below are the instructions for installing these tracks onto a hard-disk. Having no call to install extra levels onto floppy
discs, I don't know how to do it. Sorry, but I'm sure you can figure it out.

So, simply copy all the files from the Backgrounds, Tiles, Worlds, Layouts, Gradients, Objects and Tracks drawers accompanying this guide
into the corresponding drawers in your XTR drawer (you'll have to select the Show All Files option for this window to drag-and-drop files). Please be sure to copy all the files across, as I'm not sure if the tracks will work without everything being present.

I've put a lot of work into these tracks, so this section is to protect my intellectual property. I've included the tile sets in both XTR's internal format and iff format. You are permitted to use these tiles in your own creations as long as any tracks you create are created from scratch and are not copies of my tracks, and you give me credit for creating the tiles in whatever documentation you include with your tracks. Usage of these tracks is deemed acceptance of this condition.

@NODE "tracks" "tracks"

The four tracks I've created all have a woodland theme (hence my calling them Woodland. Of course). I've created all the involved  graphics from scratch, in order to retain total creative control over them.  ; )  This includes a new tile set, obviously, but that's not all. I've put together new objects, new gradients for both the sky and the floor, a new background and of course the relevant Layout and World graphics.

@NODE "Woodland_1" "Woodland_1"

This is the first track I ever created, and as such is rather simple. In fact, it's about as simple as you can get - it's a small rectangular loop. You'd think that this would make the race too easy, but in actual fact the close-quarters nature of the track and the number of trees around the edge make this track substantially more difficult than it would at first appear.

Objects : Watch out for the trees around the edge of the track; the nature of the collision routines in the game mean that these are more difficult to avoid than you'd think. There are also tree-stumps on the track; crashing into these causes you to spin out of control.
@endnode

@node "Woodland_2" "Woodland_2"

This track is set a little deeper in the forest, where a river runs between the trees. The river itself is served by several smaller streams, so be careful with your cornering - you don't want to skid off the track and into the water.

Objects : Trees and tree-stumps again.
@endnode

@node "Woodland_3" "Woodland_3"

This race takes place on a track built high up amongst the treetops. There are a couple of jumps, but you main concern should be your cornering again, as it's all too easy to skid around a corner misjudge your timing and plunge off the side of the track to your doom.

Objects: Tree-stumps.
@endnode

@node "Woodland_4" "Woodland_4"

This track is built even higher up in the treetops. It's also considerably trickier than track 3, containing loads of tight ninety-degree corners and tons of tricky jumps.

Objects: Tree-stumps.

I had no idea of what to put on my world image gfx thing so I
just stuck some pictures on.

The picture of the F1 cars is from Virtual GP (Alien F1) which I
bet is going to be a great game.
The picture at the bottom left corner is Legends of Valour
The picture in the bottom right is Lori Petty from tank girl.
The picture of the cat is my cat Sammi catching a bird.
And the power Amiga ball thingy is at the top right corner
