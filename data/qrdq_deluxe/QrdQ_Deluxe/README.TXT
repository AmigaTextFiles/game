IMPORTANT PLAYBACK NOTE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is NECESSARY to install Quake redone Quick - The Movie, unlike you are
watching the first-person demos only. In this case, FIRST.PAK has to be
renamed to PAK0.PAK, and you can simply run Quake using the command-line
parameter "-game qrdq".

In any other case, make sure you follow the installation instructions from
QRDQ.TXT closely before you send me any mails asking for support.
