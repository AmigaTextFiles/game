; Here's a new card set for MarryamPic iv'e called it Crazy Comix  
; look out for Flags of the world. 
; We still have a few other differant ideas so look out for them.
; There are hundreds of cards to be made, your football or soccer teams for example
; sport, basket ball, netball, golf, boxing, your girlfrends if you must only
; you will know who's who though (if your that lucky to have had 10 girls)
; Give it a go all you need is a picture and a sound
; Install just put Crazy Comix into the card drawer and don't delete this text
; because it ain't gonna work.
; Like to get some feedback on this as to see if it's worth doing a lot more
; this is the only part I hate doc's so no comments on this OK.

;   PS If you like a program it don't hurt to drop a line to the main man who 
; spent his RR behind the computer so as I said say hi and thanks (it means
; a lot). If time is money then concider using the macro keys before log on to 
; write your mail this only takes seconds.
; Wendy (the other half) made up this set of cards 4 someone with little knowledge
; of computers she ain't done bad but she has a headache so I get to do the Docs
; Great A :(
