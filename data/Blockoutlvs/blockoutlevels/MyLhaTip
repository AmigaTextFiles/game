 you dont know how to pack lha archives?

 you know, but cant get the right structure? or dirs are missing?

 you dont know if you have to provide a list in the readme?
 
 * then read now


 heres my tip to pack complete lha archives,
 since it is the only way i've found

 -first create a directory wich will hold all files
 -place files and make an optional info for the dir
 -Remember to have a copy of the readme in the directory,
  if thats your intention.
 -move the directory to a root on any disk ( ram: ) !NOT ram:t/
 -then type this if you have c:lha.
  
  lha a -arRx Destination.lha source(ram:directory)    

  options are case sensitive

  if you had an info file outside of the dir 
  just use the same line and add it to the destination


  I have not yet included a list in any readme,and I got away
  with it,I think its perfectly legal.
      how do you get lha to write a list to disk???????


  I use Dirwork2 to do this quick and easy
  a filemanager is a must. explorer gives filemanagers a bad
  reputation though.
