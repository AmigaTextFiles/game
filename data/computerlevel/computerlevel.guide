@node "Installation"

******************************************************************************
If you don't have a HD then DO NOT attempt to alter your Gloom disks. There is
not enough room on the floppy disks to install this new level. Go out and get
yourself a new HD, they're cheap and easy to fit SO DO IT.
******************************************************************************

The new maps directly replace the first level of Gloom.

First of all you must copy the original maps to a safe place. Open the maps 
drawer in your Gloom directory and copy map1_1 to map1_7 to a safe place.

Now open the misc drawer and copy the file called  script to a safe place.


Now copy the new files map1_1 to map1_6 to the maps drawer and script to
the misc drawer.

Copy the new files jon1 to jon7 into the txts drawer.

Alternatively you could reinstall Gloom to your HD and just work with that
copy and leave your original Gloom directory alone.
