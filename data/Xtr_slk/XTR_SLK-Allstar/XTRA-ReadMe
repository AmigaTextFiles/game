This even includes 2 Death Match Tracks so you can kill your friends!
Also Included are some suck lap times for you to kick arse with!


TRACK FEATURES:         Super High Speed, Secret FUN Areas, Mine Fields,
                        Head to Head Racing, Ice Rinks, Interesting
                        Layouts, and of course, AWESOME FUN!
 

TILE SETS:              CU, Snow, Road, Doom, Nuclear, Volcanic, Castle.


CREATION TIME:          These tracks were created a few years ago now and
                        took about one day each to Draw and Play test
                        until it could be play tested no more.


MY SETUP:               These Tracks have been created and tested on:
                        A1200, DKB 030 50mhz FPU 50mhz, 2Mb Chip, 8 Fast,
                        Xtreme Racing 2.0(1.1)


INSTALLATION:           You should know by now how to Install them but if
                        you don't it's fairly simple to do. Just copy the
                        contents of each directory of the Archive to your
                        XTR: matching directory. Sorry, no installer
                        supplied. 8(


CREDITS:                A lot of these tracks have been created using the
                        CU Amiga and XTR Christmas DEMO tile sets, so I
                        have included them as some people may not have them.
                        I hope no trouble is caused by me doing this. 8)
                        ALL Credits for those tile sets and other related
                        files goes to Silltunna Software and CU Amiga!!!
