	This is an Eat the Whistle update for the Brazilian Premier division, featuring all the teams from Copa João Havelange, the Brazilian Soccer Championship 2000.This update was developed using the great Swos-to-Etw team converter, to convert the update I developed to Swos to use with this great soccer game, Eat The Whistle.This update includes GAMA, BAHIA, and the best team of them all:FLUMINENSE! :-)
