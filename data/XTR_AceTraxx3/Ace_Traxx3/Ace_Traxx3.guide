@node intro "Introduction"

Welcome to the third release of my Ace Traxx.

After a long time i made some new XTR tracks, but this time only two.

The first is "Ace Floating 2", a nice track with some corners, but not hard at
all. This one is constructed by Rip, once again he designed the track at the
paper, and i transposed it to the game, because he is to lazy to edit them with
the XTR-Editor.

The second one is "Ace Space 1". It´s my first track made with the "Space Port"
tiles. Actually, nothing special, but funny to drive.

In the "misc" drawer, you can find a @{"Laptimes" link lap} file, and a @{"Season" link seas}
file.

Big thanks goes to David J. Cruickshank, for sending me his excellent "Skull
Army" & "Music" tracks.

Sorry for my poor english.

@node lap "Laptimes"

In the "misc" drawer is a laptimes file, which contains records of me and my
"co-designer", merged with the laptimes from David J. Cruickshank.

The names in the laptimes:

ACE = Ilija Hodak
RIP = Nenad Mitrovic
DJC = David J. Cruickshank

It`s easy to manipulate the laptimes with an hex editor, but please don´t do
this, because it`s not fair. Respect the other people, which drives hard to get
a lap record. Be a man and don´t cheat like a whimp. 

@endnode
@node seas "Season"

There is a Season file with the Ace Traxx cup in the misc drawer.

The cup consists of the ten tracks i made.

@node Install "Installation notes"

About the Authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I am a 19 years old yugoslavian, who lives in Germany and still goes to school.
See a @{"picture" link author.iff/main}.

My "co-designer", Nenad Mitrovic, is a very lazy, 15 years old guy, who doesn´t
own an Amiga, but often hangs around at my house. Actually he designed two
tracks (Ace Duplo 1 & Ace Floating 2). He gave me a plan of the track, and i
transposed them to the game. Yes, he paints 15 minutes on the paper, and i must
then edit the track for 3 days. Like i said before, he is a very lazy guy.

with yes, then send me a disk with your tracks and in recieve you will get
a disk from me with my newest tracks.

Poor english, i know.
