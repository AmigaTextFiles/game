                                          2 V1.1.<br>
                                          This version of Maw of the Umbra has 
                                          the character skins that DraX did in 
                                          it. It has also been refined according 
                                          to requests made by you guys along with 
                                          some of my own improvements. However, 
                                          please don't send angry mail to me if 
                                          something you asked for was left out.<br>
                                          I first thought of doing a sequel to 
                                          Abode of Golgotha while I was making 
                                          AOG1. The ending for the first add-on 
                                          was originally going to show Kurien 
                                          arriving home only to find his town 
                                          in flames and the sequel was going to 
                                          start at the main gates. I changed my 
                                          mind when I realised there may not be 
                                          a sequel and if that were the case then 
                                          the ending would be far too bleak. However, 
                                          when I released AOG over the net the 
                                          supportive response was far beyond what 
                                          I expected so a sequel was underway 
                                          in a matter of weeks. I know many of 
                                          you have been waiting for Maw of the 
                                          Umbra for quite some time now and I 
                                          thank you for your patience. It has 
                                          undergone many changes and additions 
                                          since conception and I hope it lives 
                                          up to your expectations. As it stands 
                                          playing the first AOG (which was recently 
                                          updated) is a good idea in order to 
                                          understand much of the back story to 
                                          MOTU and the flashback scenes but it 
                                          isn't essential.<br>
                                          Anyway, Thank you once again for downloading 
                                          Maw of the Umbra. All involved have 
                                          worked hard to finish this add-on and 
                                          hope that you enjoy playing it.</font></font></p>

                                          almighty crack sending the entire bridge 
                                          plummeting into the gaping embrace of 
                                          the chasm below taking Suraea along 
                                          with it. The crash that followed almost 
                                          caused Kurien to lose his balance as 
                                          the very ground on which he stood shook 
                                          with the repercussions of impact. Then 
                                          all lay still. Without even turning 
                                          around to look at the wreck below, Kurien 
                                          began to walk away from the chasm, away 
                                          from the forest and away from the mansion.<br>
                                          <br>
                                          The two days and nights that followed 
                                          while Kurien travelled back towards 
                                          his home town past without incident. 
                                          Although those few days were some of 
                                          the longest Kurien had ever experienced 
                                          since he only had the thoughts of Suraeas 
                                          passing for company. On the third day 
                                          however, he caught site of the walls 
                                          that surrounded Phire, his home town 
                                          in the distance. 'I made it' Kurien 
                                          thought to himself. 'I'm home'.<br>
                                          <br>
                                          A lot of changes had been made to the 
                                          town of Phire while Kurien was away 
                                          as some of the structures he found himself 
                                          surrounded by were unfamiliar. The sound 
                                          of excited voices and some polite and 
                                          impolite chatter drifted over the deserted 
                                          streets. Kurien followed the sound until 
                                          he found himself in the town square 
                                          surrounded by townsfolk eager to find 
                                          a bargain. He had arrived right in the 
                                          middle of a market day. He looked around 
                                          at all the faces that eyed him suspiciously 
                                          as though he were a foreigner. He had 
                                          been away so long that in some ways 
                                          that's exactly what he was. The thought 
                                          was quickly dismissed as a loud familiar 
                                          voice broke his momentary trance. <br>
                                          <i>"Kurien!"</i> The voice boomed excitedly. 
                                          Kurien turned and was confronted by 
                                          Jaster, his face beaming. He looked 
                                          a little older than when Kurien had 
                                          left but he still bore the same warm 
                                          hearted face that Kurien had always 
                                          remembered.<br>
                                          <i>"Kurien my boy, it's so good to see 
                                          you! When did you return?"</i> inquired 
                                          Jaster.<br>
                                          <i>"A mere moment ago."</i> said Kurien, 
                                          his voice steady and devoid of emotion.<br>
                                          <i>"What's the matter Kurien? Where 
                                          is my son Suraea?"</i> Kurien remained 
                                          silent for a moment as if to compose 
                                          himself. He took a deep breath and then 
                                          spoke. <br>
                                          <i>"I must talk to you in private Jaster."</i> 
                                          He said at last, <i>"Let's return to 
                                          your home."</i> Once there Kurien proceeded 
                                          to tell Jaster his story. Kurien spoke 
                                          of his new found magical talent, the 
                                          journey to the tome, of the mansion 
                                          and of Suraeas fate. Jaster never said 
                                          a word throughout the whole thing. <br>
                                          <br>
                                          The next day was a cold one in both 
                                          weather and in the spirits of the townsfolk 
                                          that bore Suraeas loss. The rain continued 
                                          long into the funeral where a headstone 
                                          was erected in Suraeas honor in the 
                                          town cemetery. All remained silent throughout 
                                          the entire event save those who gave 
                                          words of kindness in front of the mourners. 
                                          Suraea had been much loved among the 
                                          townsfolk. During the following week 
                                          Kurien showed Jaster the talents he 
                                          had aquired from the tomes pages and 
                                          told him more of the travels he and 
                                          Suraea had endured. They went over the 
                                          incident in Yurichs mansion many times 
                                          and Jaster even found out about Yurichs 
                                          past through books and word of mouth. 
                                          One morning Kurien was awoken by a knock 
                                          at his door. It was Jaster. And he had 
                                          a big smile on his face.<br>
                                          <i>"Kurien. Come with me."</i> Jaster 
                                          said proudly. Jaster led Kurien through 
                                          the house and out into the town. He 
                                          continued toward the town square. As 
                                          they approached Kurien noticed a huge 
                                          crowd of people gathered. Most of the 
                                          town was here. They weaved their way 
                                          through the crowd towards a makeshift 
                                          raised platform upon which the mayor 
                                          and Rikan, the captain of the guards 
                                          stood. Jaster jumped up onto it then 
                                          he reached his hand down to Kurien. 
                                          Kurien placed his hand in Jasters and 
                                          pulled himself up. The crowd cheered. 
                                          <br>
                                          <i>"What's going on?"</i> Kurien muttered 
                                          to Jaster. <br>
                                          <i>"You'll see, you'll see."</i> <br>
                                          Jaster took the podium. He held his 
                                          hand high and the crowd fell silent.<br>
                                          <i>"My friends. This town has always 
                                          been well defended by the finest of 
                                          guards&quot;</i> said Jaster motioning 
                                          toward Rikan who dipped his head slightly 
                                          in return, <i>&quot;However, there are 
                                          some types of defense that not even

                                          course of magical defense. There is 
                                          no school of magic for many miles and 
                                          so it has always been an impossibility 
                                          that we appoint a magician to lead our 
                                          defenses along side the head of the 
                                          guards and teach our men and women of 
                                          magic. Until now. Kurien has proven 
                                          himself to be a great magician. He can 
                                          conjour spells that the rest of us can 
                                          only dream of."</i> Jaster turned to 
                                          Kurien. <i>"So I ask you Kurien, to 
                                          accept the post as the head of magical 
                                          defenses."</i> Kurien was stunned. But 
                                          what better way to protect the town 
                                          he loved so dearly. <br>
                                          <i>"I accept."</i><br>
                                          Raptuous applause ensued and a grand 
                                          party began which led well on into the 
                                          night and with that, Kurien, Jaster, 
                                          Rikan and a smattering of friends retired 
                                          to a quiet bar where they talked long 
                                          into the night of family, of friends, 
                                          and of the future.</font></p>
