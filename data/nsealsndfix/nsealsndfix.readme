Type:     game/data
Requires: Registered Quake with Navy Seals

The Navy Seals modification for Quake does not work with
either Awinquake or QuakePPC when sound is enabled. That is
due to a few WAV samples, that have loops which also sometimes
cause extra noises in Clickboom's Quake. These resaved files
eradicate those problems.
