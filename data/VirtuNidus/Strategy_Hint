Strategy hint for
           Jack Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf
________________________________________

Note:  This hint is specific to the Jack
Nicklaus' Unlimited Golf program, Amiga
version.  I can't guarantee it will work
on other versions of this game, other
games, or in real life.  Honestly, I'm
not even going to guarantee it will work
at all, but give it some consideration.
________________________________________

When you are on a level fairway, 30 yds.
or less from the pin, and the green is
level as well, you might consider using
your putter.  The game has no problem
with letting you use a putter anywhere,
even from the tee.  Unless you're a 
complete purist, you'd be willing to use
an unorthodox move to shave a stroke or
two from your game.
________________________________________

Example:  You are 18 yards from the pin,
close to the edge of the green.  Convert
the distance to feet (18*3=54), and
compensate a bit for the slowing effect
of the fairway.  A 60-foot putt (75% of
the power bar) with an accurate final
click (or press of the space bar) will
either drop into the hole or leave you
with a putt of, say, 2 feet, which is
better than most wedge shots will do.
________________________________________

Disclaimer:  Practice this strategy
before you decide to use it on the 18th
hole of a tournament between you and a
couple of real-life friends where the
loser has to buy beverages for the rest
of the players.  
________________________________________

Addendum:  This strategy can also work
from the very edge of the rough if the
conditions are just right.  But rough
really slows down putts.

Final note:  The accuracy of your final
click/keypress is of ultimate importance
here.  If you're more than a pixel off,
well, you'll probably still be as well
off as if you'd used the pitching wedge.

Since you've read this far, I'll give 
one more hint.  You can get a hole in
one on Hole 16 of Virtu Nidus by using
the putter and having a bit of luck (and
accuracy) on your side.  Enjoy!
