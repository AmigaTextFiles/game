Description
Dark Shadows of Sergoth is a mod to the game The Shadows of Sergoth for the Amiga. It 
includes 10 new maps filled with puzzles and evil creatures. 

Story
In a distant and forgotten part of the kingdom lies the mysterious and menacing 
castle of Sergoth. Once a place of grandeur and power, the castle has now fallen 
into darkness and obscurity. A terrible evil has awakened, and rumors spread 
that dark shadows haunt the ancient halls.

Our hero, a brave adventurer, arrives at Sergoth in search of glory and riches. 
Armed with his sharp wit and a trusty sword, he must explore the castle's 
hidden corners, solve enigmatic mysteries, and defeat evil creatures lurking in 
the shadows. Along his journey, he uncovers ancient secrets and powerful 
artifacts that can turn the tide of battle in his favor.

But time is running out. The power of evil grows stronger with each passing day, 
and darkness spreads across the land. To save the kingdom, our hero must confront 
the mighty demon that rules Sergoth and defeat it once and for all. Will he 
succeed in freeing the castle from the grip of darkness and restoring peace and 
justice? Only the bravest and smartest adventurers can hope to survive and 
triumph in the realm of shadows.
