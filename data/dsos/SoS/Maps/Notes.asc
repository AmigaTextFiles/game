Fly, you fools!
The seventh is the fifth
The first is the second
The sixth is the third
The fifth is the fourth
The third is the first
The fourth is the fifth
The second is the first
Illusions pave the way to insanity!
Beware of the slippery floor!
Down with all of them!
Watch out for magic forces!
Two eastward and four northward
Find the levers of the dead
Speak
Friend
And
Enter
Speak friend, and enter!
The secret passage opens...
Find two levers hidden away
The quest is done!
You defeated the Lich!
