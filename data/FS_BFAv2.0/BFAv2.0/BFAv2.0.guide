After the narrow destruction of
the dreaded Lucifier,humanity
struggles to survive as it's
homeworld is marooned from the
cataclysmic maelstrom of the
Lucifier's death.
The alliance dwindles as the
Hammer of light and rebel
factions arrise and fight
amoungst themselves.
But perhaps there may be a
solution to re-unite humanity
to it's homeworld, but it takes
true piloting skills and tactitcal
knowledge to find the outcome...
victory or failure.
