@{b}Capture the Flag I@{PLAIN}
There is a cargo container in the
middle of the battle area, labeled
"The Flag". Players must escort
the freighters to the flag and protect
them while they dock and prevent
enemy freighters from stealing the
cargo first. After captured, the
freighters must make it back to the
friendly jump node.

@{b}Capture the Flag II@{PLAIN}
Same mission as Capture the Flag I
except now there are asteroids
blocking the flag and all fighters
are hidden from the sensors. Definately
more difficult than its predecessor.

@{b}Capture The NavBouy@{PLAIN}
In this version of Capture the Flag,
two teams of three ships have to prevent
each other from approaching their NavBouy.
Once someone has hit their enemy's
NavBouy, they must make it back to their
own Bouy to win.

@{b}Capture the Flag 3.5@{PLAIN}
This is a new version the previous Capture
the Flag (3). In this version, the two teams'
nodes are much closer together. Also, the
player has to scan the flag before it can be
towed. There is much more action instead
of time waiting for the transports to make
their trek across space.

@{b}Ambush!@{PLAIN}
There is a Shivan destroyer roaming a
particular sector of space. Terran
Command wants to destroy the destroyer
but they have been unable to pinpoint its
exact location. Needless to say they
would rather not wait until it shows up.
The plan is to cause havoc at a shivan
shipping lane, forcing the destroyer to
show up. When it shows up, kill it. A bonus
is that intelligence has comfirmed that a
shipment of alien cargo will go through at
the time of the attack, and that the cargo
could be potentially valuable to the
Terran/Vasudan Alliance. If you can
destroy the ships slated to carry the
cargo off, our own carriers will jump in
and retrieve the cargo.
