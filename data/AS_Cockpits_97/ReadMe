This archive contains 14 replacement cockpit designs to be used in
F1GP - at least one for each team competing in the 1997 F1 season, and
two when the cockpits differ between teammates.

 o Arrows
 o Benetton
 o Ferrari
 o Jordan
 o McLaren (2)
 o Minardi
 o Prost (2)
 o Sauber
 o Stewart (2)
 o Tyrrell
 o Williams

Each design consists of an IFF-ILBM image file (.ilbm) and a F1GP-Ed
graphic settings file (.settings).  Note that the settings files don't
have icons, so remember to copy them if you copy the designs to
another location - they are important!


                         WHAT'S NEW FOR v2.0?
                         --------------------

 o All cockpit designs have been completely changed, based on a new,
   and hopefully more realistic, template.

                        HOW TO USE THE DESIGNS
                        ----------------------

You will need a *registered* copy of F1GP-Ed (at least v3.10) to use
these designs in F1GP.  Basically, you just need to go to the graphics
window in F1GP-Ed, load a .settings file and then click the save to
binary button.  Note that you may need to alter the path to the image
(.ilbm) file using the "Image" gadget - you shouldn't have to do this
with F1GP-Ed v3.3x (now released).  If you are using a version 3.1x
you will need to convert the .ilbm file to raw format before F1GP-Ed
can use it.

For full instructions, please refer to the F1GP-Ed documentation.
