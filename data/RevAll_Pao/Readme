Hi Simon!
I'm sending you in this archive (hopefully as it's my first try at email
attachements) some heads and victims for the brilliant Revenge AGA.
Hey, it's really cool to play it! In fact I am still playing it now and
then, between a Napalm match and a go on the net...

There is just one thing I think should be improved: the Vic-Gen only loads
heads to create victims, while I think it should also be able to load
victims to rearrange them. That's mainly for the fact that sometimes
new victims coming from Aminet have to be rearranged because the uploader
forgot to include the sound files!

Anyway, that's a description of my victims:

 - Cow: this is my first head, and it's quite cool, even if it took me a
     while to find a decent sound file for it.
 - Lemming: this is probably the worst head of all, but I had a cool sample
	(even if it's probably too long) and wanted to employ it!
 - Noel: this would be better called Santa or something like that, but as
	there are lots of other Santa victims for Revenge, I decided to change
	it a little. Anyway I think it turned out quite well.
 - Snowman: this came easy as it was Winter (although here in Rome it last
	snowed 4-5 years ago)...
 - Undefined: this is a little strange as I originally wanted to design some
	sort of granny character, but it turned out to be ... erm, something:
	I don't know what exactly it could represent, and I think it should be
	left to the beholder to decide what it is...
 - WC-DOS User: here's the best! This is a perfect picture of a user of Bill
	Grates' software, which deeply shows his intelligence and his deep
	thoughts...

BTW if you're interested my machine is a Power Towered Amiga 1200 with a
Blizzard PowerUp (040/25 + 603e/200), 24 Mb Fast, CD 24x, HD 1Gb.

Well, that's all, I guess
Happy killing my victims ;-)
