                        - W O R M S for the Amiga -
                               Some Levels
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~
        By Andy "BOB" Till (of Liquid Innovative Software), 20/2/96

Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~      These are some lovely Worms levels created by Andy
Till to show the world that you can do reasonably good levels with 8
colours.

Installation:
~~~~~~~~~~~~      Copy them across to the TWCUSTOM drawer on the Worms
disk. Just type in the name (e.g. "DONKEYHELL") to load one as a level
from the landscape generator.

If it goes wrong:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ They may not work on 1Mb Amigas, but I think Andy
Davidson is working on (or may have finished) a patch to fix this.       

Why?:
~~~~~             If you are slightly bemused by Concrete Donkeys or
the significance of "LIQUID" then let me explain....

* "LIQUID": Liquid Innovative Software is the group I am the graphics artist
for at the moment, that is why on one of the levels there are letters
popping out of the ground saying, funnily enough, "LIQUID".

* "DDNKEYHELL": Donkeys are sacred, only the most priviliged people will
ever get to see one of these garden ornaments and touch the holy concrete.
Sacrificial gifts are laid upon these poor creatures and if you see one
- place an object of some considerable significance between the ears of the
donkey to show appretiation of it's existance - living alone in the garden
lawn. If you want to know more about it, read Andy Davidson's document
entitled: "EVERYWORM2.doc" (Everything you wanted to know about Worms but
were too afraid to ask).

* "DOOBS": The Doobs are some characters that will feature in a game
Liquid are doing. The game will be a cross between Fury of the Furries,
Humans and Cannon Fodder.

* "FROYDEL": 'Froydel' is the name of the creature that dominates this
landscape. Here, the gravity is very high and incredibly slippery. The
strange purple light given off by the sun makes everything on the planet
purple, even the worms and the mines. A very dangerous level - oh, and
I recommend wearing shades because it's quite psychedelic!

I will be happy to be sent any thing for this - even if it's just a
message saying "Hello, please do more levels - preferably containing even
more Concrete Donkeys".

And if you want to tell Andy Davidson anything, write to me and I'll give it
to him. (As long as they aren't ideas for Worms that have any likeness to
something from Lemmings - and if they are, he'll come round to your place in
the night and insert a large joystick up your right nostril).

* And the words of the day are : 'Belisha beacon' *

- How to get REALLY weird landscapes...

If, when you click the right mouse button on the landscape generator, you
type in (without the quotes), "CJ TITS", a strange landscape will appear
before your eyes. (Avid viewers of Baywatch on TV will be in no doubt as
to why that was typed in!)
Try changing the 4th and 5th (i.e. T & I) letters and see what other shapes
you can make.
