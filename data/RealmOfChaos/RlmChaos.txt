Description:
This 32-level Doom2 WAD is the first (and only) Mac-made conversion WAD.
Misc. Author Info: 
The Macintosh Team is a group of 7 MacDoom players and authors who have 
organized to bring you Realm of Chaos, a collection of first-rate Doom2 
levels. Doom map editors were made available to Macintosh users in early
1996; after a few months of individual authoring and uploading, seven of
the best MacDoom authors were recruited to form TMT and work on the Realm
of Chaos WAD. In total, the project took 6 months.
Note:
This package contains 3 items: the levels/graphics WAD ("RlmChaos.WAD"),
an optional sprites  WAD ("Rlmsprt.WAD"), and this readme ("RlmChaos.txt").
If you want to use the new sprites, the sprites WAD must be inflated 
(using WADenizer or DeUSF) and then loaded with the levels/graphics WAD.
Also, MacDoomers make sure the files end in ".WAD" in all-caps.

Storyline:
You are dropped off on the UAC base on Mars and fight the bad guys in 11
battles. The final battle occurs at the Mars Starport, after which you
take a ship home to Earth. You soon realize that Earth is also overrun,
and continue the fight on your home planet for 9 battles, only to be
taken prisoner. You awake in a prison in Hell, and must escape. You wage
10 battles in Hell, culminating with a fight against the Four Lords of
Hell. As with Doom2, there is a secret level and a super-secret level.
See if you can find them!

Bug Report:
All levels have been playtested and found to lack major bugs. There are
minor bugs, however:

Levels 1 and 26: If the platforms do not rise enough, you must wait for
each one to finish rising before starting the next one.

Levels 13 and 15: Hall-of-Mirrors (HOM) visual defects can sometimes
be seen in the area behind the red door.

Level 19: Do not dodge around the bow of the ship while the warehouse
door is open.  If you do, you'll see big-time HOM.

Level 27: If you freeze the blue-key pylon, open a saved game and try
again.  The puzzle works -- trust me! :>

Level 29: HOM can sometimes be seen in the area with the yellow key and
in the final room.
