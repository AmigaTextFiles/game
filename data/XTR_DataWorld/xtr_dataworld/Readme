   Hello there is yet another set of tracks for XTR. If you have a
hard disk the install script should copy the necessary files the your
XTR drawer. If is do'nt work sorry. If you are still using floppys sorry
its a D.I.Y. job.

   When using the install script you only need the tiles in iff form
if editing the tracks, or using my tiles to make new tracks. I


   If the tracks wont work with your version of XTR, decrunch all of the
data using XFDdecrunch (available on Aminet)

   See below for copyright details.
