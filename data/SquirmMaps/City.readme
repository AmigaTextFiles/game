City

Use the ninja rope and pretend you're BatMan in Gotham...

* Air Strike is mostly useless as the buildings tend to get in the way.

* Use cluster bombs on worms that are trapped in the alleys between
buildings, the close quarters explosion can do untold damage.

* Blowtorch your way out of trouble if trapped between two buildings.

Drawn in Brilliance, December 1995 by James Willmott.
