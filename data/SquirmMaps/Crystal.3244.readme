Crystal

A difficult map, the slippery crystals sending worms sliding in all
directions...

* Air Strike is useless on the left of the map due to some large crystal
formations that will get in the way.

* Use the ninja rope with care, a misstimed landing will send the worm
sliding off all over the place.

Drawn in Brilliance, December 1995 by James Willmott.
