BridgeWork

A deceptive map, requiring cunning on the part of those worms trapped in
the framework below the main bridge...

* Dragonball and Fire Punch can be used on the bridge to persuade stubborn
worms into a mine.

* Worms can make it from the framework to the top surface of the bridge...
but if they don't they're well protected from an air strike.

Drawn in Brilliance, December 1995 by James Willmott.
