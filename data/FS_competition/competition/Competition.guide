Well, I wasn't satisfied with
a 4 star rating, so I decided to
update this mission.  The story
should be pretty clear now (just
ignore the GTA symbols everywhere
in the command briefing). I cranked
the skill of enemy pilots, making
them tougher to kill.  
I also made it so that you only have
about 50 seconds to kill the Themis.
Far from impossible, but challenging
when those escorts are chucking
missiles at you (your wingman is very
important here).  Extract the small
sound file to freespace/data/voice/special
Have fun!

You must only use "Mod.install" for
the installation. It`s not necessary
that you do something else.

Update: 3/29/99 -
In an effort to make this mission
more immersive, i have edited a
few of the .pcx files to get rid
of all the GTA stuff in my mission
and have replaced it with a logo for
Powers Industries.
