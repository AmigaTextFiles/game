Well, i wasn't satisfied with a 4 star rating, so i decided to update this mission.  The
story should be pretty clear now (just ignore the GTA symbols everywhere in the command
briefing).  I cranked the skill of enemy pilots, making them tougher to kill.  
I also made it so that you only have about 50 seconds to kill the Themis.  Far from
impossible, but challenging when those escorts are chucking missiles at you (your wingman
is very important here).  Extract the small sound file to  freespace/data/voice/special
Have fun!  

Update: 3/29/99 -
In an effort to make this mission more immersive, i have edited a few of the .pcx files
to get rid of all the GTA stuff in my mission and have replaced it with a logo for Powers
Industries.  Enjoy!

P.S.  check out my other missions:  Leveling the Playing Field (4.5 stars), Infiltrator (no
      DC review yet), and First Encounter (waiting for the re-review, it had a few bugs)
