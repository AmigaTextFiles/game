    Introduction

    These are my first tracks ever.  As such anyone who feels they can contribute 
with ideas can feel free, my mates email address is @{"here." LINK "Author" 0}  
However anyone ripping these tracks of can die a thousand nasty deaths involving 
mad rabbits, big teeth and baboons.  Or something.

    @{b}Special thanks and credit is given to David J. Cruickshank, without whom 
track RK 4 would not be possible.  I have included both the .256 and the .chk 
versions of his Scalextrix tile set.  I now do know that they are freely distributable, I
have found the docs to them.  As per his distribution instructions the track.readme is
included with this @{"distribution." LINK ScalextricTiles.Readme/all}

    For the Scalextrix tile set.
    The .chk extension is needed if you only want to race on my/his tracks.
    The .256 extension is needed if you want to create your own tracks using these 
tile sets.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Installation" "Just In Lust  -  Installation"

    Easy this.  

    Method ONE:- Use my Amiga DOS script which should work.

    Method TWO:-  Do it the hard way, and copy the contents of each drawer to 
                  the same drawer on your hard drive.

For Floppy users.

    I think you should create a new disk called XTR4 (Or above), and place all
the files onto this disk in the correct drawers.

For more information look in the docs sent with the game.

@NODE "secret route" "PissJoy  -  secret route"

These are the secret routes.

On RK 1 just after the start finish line, on the right there are three trees.  The middle 
one can be driven through.  When past just watch the walls on the left and the ice on 
the right.

On RK 3 about half way round the circuit it goes like this.  (Approach right to left)
                                                                                
                                                {--}   
                                               |    |  
               ----<----<-------<------<------ |    |------<------<-----<---

i.e. you approach from right to left horizontally, then turn right (UP), the
left (DOWN) then continue horizontally.  The reason you turn right is because
the water blocks your path.  To drive over the water aim the car just to the
right of the on coming tree.

For RK 3 it should make sense honest, if you have driven the track anyway.

@NODE "Author" "Caffine Bomb  -  Author"

    Through this link you may discover secret things about me, this will
ultimately result in a Men In Black type mind scrubbing at some point in the
future.

                            @{b}Continue at your peril@{ub}

    Right then continuing well lets go,

    I am 17 (10.03.80) studying 3 really crappy 'A' levels (Psychology, English and 
Economics) 
and have developed a rather fanatical following of music.  Certain faves being THE 
WILDHEARTS, RADIOHEAD, THE MANICS, THE STONE ROSES, BELLY AND TANYA 
DONNERLY.  I also have a liking for my miggy and XTR, my miggy is as follows:-

    1200 Tower
    Blizzard 1240 + 8 Meg Fast
    A squirrel + Syquest and CD-ROM
    A slow 2.5" IDE HD of 540 megabytes
    An extra floppy
    And a shit hot second hand multi-sync monitor.
    Much software.

I have now purchased a modem.  A nice Dynalink 33.6.  So any helpful comments can now
be sent to YTUUN@KRIKSSOR.DEMON.CO.UK
(Any nice COMMS type software suggestions welcome too)

My mates Email address is DROVIER@DIAL.PIPEX.COM, because of him I was able to upload
versions 1 and 1.1 to the Aminet.

    He is interested in MARILYN MANSON, SMASHING PUMPKINS, MUDHONEY, THE
DEFTONES, NIN etc.  He also likes that Quake game, and any psychedelic and strange
stuff, he just wants to receive some Email.  Nice not nasty.  And any other quality
shit.

    @{b}Jackson Pollock, he's damn good too. The painter that is@{ub}

My Postal address would be
153 SLEETMOOR LANE
SOMERCOTES

So you no longer have any excuses not to send me a postcard.  Unless your just a 
mean git :-)

@NODE "Problems" "Greetings From Shitsville  -  Problems"

    Right then something must have gone wrong.

@{b}Problem 1@{ub}

   Firstly check that all the necessary files are in the correct drawers.

@{b}Problem 2@{ub}

   Second if you haven't got the data disk then you cannot read the CrunchMania 
packed track + data files.  To overcome this use a utility such as XFD, bound to be on the
Aminet and Magazine CD-ROMs.

    If anything else goes wrong then I haven't got a clue, unless I forgot to upload 
something. Please contact @{"me" LINK "Author" 0}

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Thanks" "Drinking About Life  -  Thanks"

  In this section anyone who helps me with something, or indeed just gets in
contact with me will get a mention.

  instead with the @{"Christmas Demo" LINK "Track 1" 0}

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Legal" "Girlfriend Clothes  -  Legal"

    Right then for copying and altering see the individual track descriptions.

    I grant my permission for my tracks to be included on any Aminet CD's or 
compilations of a similar type.  This also applies to any Magazine Cover DISK'S/CD'S.
However notification would be nice, and so would a copy of the magazine/CD.

    Other than that if you use these tracks please send my mate some @{"Email," LINK "Author" 0}
and me a @{"postcard." LINK "Author" 0}  One without the other is VERY NAUGHTY and
is punished with slapped wrists.

    And if you computer blows up, buggers up, has a nervous break down, or any
other detrimental thing occurs its not my fault, so there.

    I declare that the tracks contained within this archive are entirely my own work.  
But the tile sets used to create these tracks were created by Silltunna Software Ltd.
and by @{"David J. Cruickshank" LINK "Introduction" 0} NOT by me.

    This archive should not perform any posible action which could harm you, your 
computer, or any others.  If it does it is not my responsibility and no guarantees
are made as to the contents of this archive.

    My advise would be to run a virus checker on the archive to check if I missed any. 
Also check out the Amiga DOS script first if you use it. So you can see it does nothing 
nasty.

@{b}Track RK 3         FINISHED!!!!!!@{ub}

  What I have done is add more grass, make the grass into FASTER GRASS.
I have also altered the edges of the track.  It is more uneven, and I think
better for this.  (By uneven I mean that all the edges of the sand are no
longer just straight like a racing circuit, now more like a beach.)

@{b}Track RK 4         FINISHED!!!!!!@{ub}

  Also track RK 4 has been finished.  All that has been done is that any problems
or bugs have been tidied up.  Again any suggestions are welcome.

@{b}Track RK 5         FINISHED!!!!!!@{ub}

  Yes it is true a completely new track, finished as well.  Comments are well
appreciated.  So don't hold back.

@{b}Track 5 Bonus      FINISHED!!!!!!@{ub}

  Yes a fabulous bonus track.  Bit crappy and rough round the edges, but you
don't worry EH??.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Season" "Everlone  -  Season File"

  Care of @{"Dirk." Link "Thanks" 0} There is now a @{b}SEASON FILE@{ub} for 
these tracks.  My tracks are contained within the TWILIGHT CUP, and the last season,
cannot remember the name though.

       @{b}********   The season file may cause XTR to crash or cock up in some way   ***********

  This is because Dirk has also incorporated several other tracks which are not 
distributed with the game.  When the game calls these tracks and tries to load
them it may crash.  I have the tracks and haven't tested the season file with
some tracks missing, so for all I know it may work.@{ub}


@ENDNODE
@NODE "Sorry" "Sick Of Drugs  -  Apologies"

  I must also apologise because I think I forgot to upload some of the required 
objects for track 3 in version 1.1 of these tracks. If you had downloaded version 1.0
then it should have worked fine.  This is now fixed in this version 1.1a.

  Again an apology as I requested people to send me postcards and then forgot to 
include my address.
But still thanks to those who sent @{"emails." LINK "Thanks" 0}  My postal address 
has now been added to the @{"Author" LINK "Author" 0} page, so no excuses now.

  Another Apology.  I am sorry about the rushed state of the AmigaGuide Docs in 
both Versons 1.0 and 1.1.  I think it is better now.
@ENDNODE
@NODE "Laptimes" "Geordie In Wonderland  -  Laptimes"

  I have also included my own laptimes file in the 'misc' drawer.  It isn't copied across
by my installer.  To combine it to your .laptimes file use the 'BestLaps' utility supplied
with the game or with the data disks.  I forget which.
@ENDNODE
@NODE "WILDHEARTS" "Schizophonis  -  The Wildhearts"

  In honour of my favourite band THE WILDHEARTS, I have put the titles of some of 
their best and most famous (in England) songs on the title bar of multiview.

  This one is Schizophronic.
  The other ones aren't.
@ENDNODE
@NODE "Future" "Getting It  -  Future"

Right then this is going to be my TODO list :-)

Fix any outstanding bugs in the six tracks so far completed.
Impliment any quality ideas in the first six tracks.

Then we will see what the future holds, as 'A' Level exams and hopefully University 
will soon be a major part of my life.  I will hope to keep releasing sets of 5 tracks 
and 1/2 bonus tracks.

I may also send the tracks to CU AMIGA and AMIGA FORMAT for the readers 
contributions part of the CD.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "History" "Shut Your Fucking Mouth, And Use Your Fucking Brain  -  History"

  This is a complete history of these tracks, as I remember it :-)

   JULY 97        Ill with glandular fever (NASTY).  So after days spent playing XTR, I 
                  decided to create my very own tracks.

   NOVEMBER 97/   After months of on off development I release Version 1.0 (BETA) 
                  of my tracks.

   DECEMBER 97

   21.12.97       Version 1.1 of my tracks are released.  All four are now complete.  
                  However it is a rush job, and the AmigaGuide Doc isn't finished,
                  and I think I forgot to upload some of the required objects for RK 3

   23.12.97       Version 1.1a is prepared for uploading the following weekend on 
                  my mates PC.  It has completed AmigaGuide Docs,
                  and all the required files to make it go.
                  Also in Version 1.1 all the Icons were missed from the archive. Sorry.
                  @{b}Turned out to be an internal release@{ub}

   10.01.98       Version 1.5 is released.  Everything sorted out.
                  Tracks RK 5 and a bonus are included.
@ENDNODE
@NODE "Cheats" "Cold Patootie Tango  -  XTR Cheats"

Some cheats I have found or nicked.

    idkfa - always qualify, can play bonus tracks on 'play single track'

    turbo nutter bastard : very fast car - you can't save laptimes on this cheat

    sheepy sheepy : try it to race the @{b}SHEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!@{ub}

Also if you accelerate just before the GO on the grid, you get a hidden turbo which
blasts you past the other cars. This takes some timing, push up just before the 1 becomes GO.
