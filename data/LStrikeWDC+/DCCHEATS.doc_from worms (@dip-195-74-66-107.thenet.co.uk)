                            (THE HIDDEN STUFF!!)


First of all, thanks to everyone who has bought the game.  If you have any
comments about WormsDC, or find any bugs, then email me ...

I have fixed the Option Set bug, and am just fixing/adding some more stuff at
the moment.  A new executable will be on T17/Aminet by next week.  The new
