Using this cardset
------------------

The cardset can be found in the drawer marked 'MixBag'. You should copy
this drawer to the "Cards"-drawer in the Marryampic-dir.
I do not ask anything for this work, and so there is no intention to breach any copyrights.
I hope this won't cause any trouble for anyone.
The making of this cardset was really a lot of work for me and other 
people, but was also a lot of fun.
The samples are a little bit bigger now but I hope that this will make the game more interesting, as 
the sound samples are of a higher quality.
The pics in the 16 colour version are of limited quality due to the limitations of OCS/ECS.
If anyone has better samples or pics, they can send them to Marc please, who likes receiving 
emails and support for more cardsets. You can send pics and samples from many
other things (games, CD-covers, films or anything else).



Tested on:
