To install to harddisk, copy the files from the "Tracks" directory to
the "XTR/Tracks" directory on your harddrive. Then copy the files
from the "Layouts" directory to the "XTR/Layouts" directory on your
harddrive. Then copy the files from the "worlds" directory to the
"XTR/Worlds" directory on your harddrive.

Also copy this guide to anywhere on your harddrive.

To install to floppy, I have no idea, try buying a harddrive. :P

I had no idea of what to put on my world image gfx thing so I
just stuck some pictures on.

The picture of the F1 cars is from Virtual GP (Alien F1) which I
bet is going to be a great game.
The picture at the bottom left corner is Legends of Valour
The picture in the bottom right is Lori Petty from tank girl.
The picture of the cat is my cat Sammi catching a bird.
And the power Amiga ball thingy is at the top right corner

The spec of my Amiga is:

A1200T (Eyetech)
240 MHz PowerPC with 040/25/MMU/FPU
32 Meg Fast
4.3 Gig Harddrive
24 speed CD-ROM drive
extra disk drive
Pace 56K modem
and a dodgy 1084 monitor

Is anyone else having problems getting XTR to work on a PowerPC
board as it keeps crashing on mine unless I deactivate my PowerPC
board first which then makes the game look crap. Contact me if you
know how to fix it.
