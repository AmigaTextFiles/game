 NOTE: This archive is a direct replacement for my previous cheat archive,
       which is called "TKG_Cheat.lha" and is in "game/data" on Aminet.

 Here it is!

 Tired of trying to beat the aliens in TKG?  Sick of being blasted to death
 instantly at the start of Level B?  Then you've come to the right archive!

 In this drawer are 4 files, called:

  * boot.dat.A-E
  * boot.dat.F-J
  * boot.dat.K-O
  * boot.dat.P

 As their names suggest, they are saved-game files for levels A to E,
 F to J, K to O, and P.  The real trick though, is that they're all saved
 with the following:

  * All weapons available, including the Jet Pack!
  * 999 shots per weapon
  * 999 energy points

 That's right!  Now you can kick some alien butt in a BIG way!  You can see
 the later levels without fighting through the lower ones.  How's that for
 a cheat mode!  :)

 To use these 4 files, simply copy them to your TKG game drawer (or save
 disk) over the existing "boot.dat" file.  Make sure you strip the last 4
 characters off the filename first (ie. remove the ".A-E" part).  Then,
 when you start the game, you can load in the level you want to play with
 full weapons, ammo and energy!

 Enjoy the cheat, and contact me with your comments!  :)
