Type:     game/data


Installing:

   You need Worms:DC, an AGA Amiga, and a few megs of harddisk space.  Put
this archive in your TWSamples directory.  It really is simple.

Ratings:

   I realize that some parents might be concerned that this sound set might
have some "strong language" in it.  So therefor this set is rated PG-13!

And now for a bit of talk:

   All of these sounds are from the movie Army of Darkness.  If you haven't
seen it, go rent it today!  The only sounds that are not from the movie are:
Reload, Pop, Bazooka, and Splash.1.  Everything else is from the movie.
Think I've made that clear now.  These sounds are mainly from The Essential
Army of Darkness page (never knew it existed!) and their links.  If you
are having trouble with the sounds, want to request a different sample set,
or just really like this one (?) you can e-mail me at:

The creator of Dr. Who.
The creator of the Amiga.
The creator of nylon and velcro.


Toodle loo!
