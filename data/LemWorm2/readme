When I uploaded the two different worm screens done from the original 
Lemmings intro screen, I promised a bunch more Lemmings worm screens but 
that will not happen as I was not satisfied with the results. I used DCTV 
for the digitizing and do to my lack of experience with digitizers and the 
fact that to much detail was lost cutting the picture down to 8 colors, 
this is the only Lemmings worm screen I did. It is the first level of 
mayhem, hope you enjoy it.

As everybody should know by now copy the file to the TWCustom drawer.
