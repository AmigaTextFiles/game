T.V. Sports Basketball 2013-2014 NBA Season

> WHAT IS THIS AND WHY?

This is the latest patch for the new 2013-2014 season for the NBA basketball simulation game T.V. Sports Basketball by
Cinemaware. There are quite a few people still playing this masterpiece from Cinemaware, so why not playing it with the
updated teams, rosters, attributes etc? This patch has nothing to do with Cinemaware, so bear that in mind.

This patch is considered donationware, due to heavy work to update all those rosters and attributes. If you find the patch
useful, then please take some time to donate anything you want using my PayPal e-mail address at the bottom. This will

* Updated players' stats to represent reality as close as possible

* All transfers up to 31st of October 2013 since last season


> READ BEFORE INSTALLING

Unfortunately due to the old release of the game, there is one big flaw, and some minor flaws which don't affect the
gameplay though.

The one and only big flaw of the game is that due to the old release, it includes 28 teams, whereas now NBA consists of
a total of 30 teams spread across 6 divisions of 5 teams each. So, I forced not to include the two worst teams in NBA
these years, and those are Charlotte Bobcats from the Eastern Conference (sorry Michael, your team needs a lot of work)
and New Orleans Pelicans (former Hornets) from the Western Conference. Sorry for the fans of those aforementioned teams.

The minor flaws consists actually of the current jersey numbers of the players. It seems that the numbers in the old days
weren't all available, so some players, but very few, have incorrect jersey numbers or at least very close numbers to the
real thing.
