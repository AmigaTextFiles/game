Boulder Daesh Extra Pack (C)2009 Robert Szacki
----------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 initial-release

Description:
------------

Here is a set of original Boulder Dash levels from "No One 16 Pack" from
Commodore64 to use with Guido Mersmann's Boulder Daesh which consists of:

 Boulder Dash 3
 Boulder Dash 4
 Boulder Dash 5
 Boulder Dash 6
 Boulder Dash 7
 Boulder Dash 8
 Boulder Dash 10
 Boulder Dash 11

It differs from those included originally with Boulder Daesh
that they have much better design and don't have bugs: for example
to free firefly you don't need to direct contact with dirt next to it,
but there are boulders which once released will free the firefly!

Installation:
-------------

Just extract archive to Games/ drawer in your BoulderDaesh directory,
preferably Games/User/.

Distribution:
-------------

This package is released as Freeware, thus it can be freely distributed
but without changes to the archive.

Drop me a mail if you like it! Greetings! :)
