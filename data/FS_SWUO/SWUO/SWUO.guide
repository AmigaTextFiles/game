Unit One of the Second Wave
campaign. Incorporates missions
1a-6a. Also includes the linking .fsc file.

The Great War Mission 1:
   Worst Case Scenario
This mission is pathetically easy. Don't
dismiss the campaign just because of this
mission. The only reason I made this is
so a player can get involved in the storyline.

The Great War Mission 2:
         Out of Sight
You actually have to do something in this
mission. Make sure you read all the
dialogue from the other ships!

The Great War Mission 3:
         Guard Duty
This mission is the first branching point
in Second Wave. You and your wingmen
are guarding a cargo depot and the
Unknowns show up. If they're able to
destroy some of the cargo and escape, it'll
be up to you to chase them down in #4b,
"The Chase." If they don't get away with it,
well, you won't have to chase them, right?

The Great War Mission 4a:
           Americana
First mission of the A-branch.
You and your wing assist in the defense
of GTI Americana, an Arcadia-class
installation in the Omicron Theta system.

The Great War Mission 4b:
          The Chase
First mission of the B-branch.
Alpha wing chases the Shivan Asura
wing that attacked the cargo depot in
"Guard Duty." This mission takes place
in SUBSPACE, and can be very disorienting.
At times, it will seem as if you are not
moving (or moving backwards, or moving
extremely fast forwards), so it is very easy to
get turned around. Also, there is a time limit
on this mission. You have exactly seven
minutes to destroy the four fighters.

The Great War Mission 5a:
     Between the Lines
Your wing is transferred to the GTD Intrepid,
the President's capital ship, for it's journey to
Regulus.

The Great War Mission 6a:
            Sightings
A great way to wrap up the first 'unit' of
SecondWave: a mission with a cliffhanger.

The Great War Mission 7a:
           Aftermath
First mission of SecondWave Unit Two. The
Bastion arrives in Sirius after the Shivan
destroyer Lysander has devistated
everything in the system...

The Great War Mission 8a:
            Prelude
Terran R&D has finished work on the new
Valkyrie-enhanced fighters. The three working
prototypes are en route to Alpha Centauri for
use in an upcoming mission when they are
ambushed by 'enemy' forces...
