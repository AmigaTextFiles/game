		A new campaign by Jacob Bock, aka Omega47

			     -Introduction-
========================================================================


Time:	NSD July 14, 3472 1345 Hours
	Seven years after the Shivan Wars
Place:	GTD Avenger, beyond the edge of terran space

	"Ship's Log, N.S.D. July 14, 3472. Captain Weber reporting.
	"Our survey of the system has been very uneventful.  We have detected four star systems with habitable planets, only one of which has intelligent life.  Their culture is simple, and has not yet begun interstellar travel.  I recommend to Terran Command that they be observed, but not contacted until they develop space travel.
	"We will be returning to terran space by way of the Adhara system late tomorrow morning, and we will stop in at their installation for repair and personnel transfer.  After serving with this same crew for three years now, I must say that I am sad to see this team break up.
	"However, change is always good, and I am sure that I will see them all again.  For the record, I am submitting Ensigns O'Connor and Maskell for promotions.  Both will make fine officers soon.  Finally, I would like to enter into the official record that all personnel on this ship have served at and above the call of duty.
	"End Log."

	Captain Weber went over his log entry, and then transmitted it to Terran Command.  Even though he was officially off duty for another hour, he went to the bridge.  Something about being there always made him feel calm and in control.

	"Captain on the bridge," said Rebecca Thompson, the tactical officer.  Her ability to follow standard procedures was incredible.
	"I thought I asked you to stop that, Lieutenant."
	"You did, sir.  But seeing that this is our last day as a crew, I felt it was necessary."
	"Thanks for the sentiment."  Captain Weber went over to the captain's chair and sat down. "Anything interesting, Lieutenant Skrr'ee?"
	Skrr'ee was a Vasudan, a direct descendant of the president of the Vasudan Parliament of seven years back.  "Nothing on scope, sir.  Everything is calm."
	"Very well then.  Lieutenant, you have the bridge.  I'll be on the observation deck."  Captain Weber got up, and was about to get onto the 'lift when Thompson's tactical board went crazy. 
	"I'm... detecting unsigned jump signatures!  They're all over the scope!  I'm reading... one-hundred forty-seven unknown ships!"
	"This is the captain, all hands to battle stations!  Skrr'ee, evasive maneuvers!"
	The Avenger banked to the left, but to no avail.  The attackers were simply too fast, too maneuverable.  They swarmed the Avenger, and opened fire."
	"Thompson, report!"
	"The ships have knocked out the science, engineering, and cargo decks' systems.  Reading multiple hull breaches along the starboard side.  Engines at 32%, life support at 47%.  Medical is getting reports of casualties across the whole ship!"
	"Skrr'ee, get us out of here!  Engage subspace shift!"
	"Unable to comply, sir.  The shift drives are inoperable."
	"Then set course for the nearest jump node, maximum thrust!"
	"Affirmative, sir."
	The ship lurched, and then went into high speed for the Adhara jump node.  Even at full thrust, the node was still quite a distance away.
	"Captain to repair teams.  Prioritize the subspace shift drives!  Without them, we're stuck here!"
	"Aye sir.  We're on our way."
	"Captain, only 20 of the attackers remain."
	"Good firing, Thompson!  Notify the fighterbay, we'll send out fighters to clean off the rest."
	"Affirmative, sir, but I didn't destroy the hundred fighters.  I was only able to get a dozen when they all jumped out."
	"Very well, Lieutenant.  We'll still send out the fighters.  Mobilize Beta, Gamma, Theta, and Pi wings."
	"Affirmative."
	Time seemed to slow to a crawl as the Avenger made its way to the jump node.  They were twenty minutes away, when directly ahead a massive jump gate opened.
	"My god... Lieutenant, what is that?"
	"Identification is null, sir.  The computer's never seen a jump of that size."
	"Skrr'ee, launch the ship's recorder towards the jump node.  Somebody needs to see this." 
	Out of the portal, what seemed to be a black pyramid with arms burst through.  From its arms shot multiple beams of pure energy.  The space around seemed to bend and twist as the beams sliced through space towards their target, the Avenger.
	On the bridge, and the observation deck, the fighterbay floor, and all over the ship at windows and portholes, the crew of the Avenger saw the dark of space, followed by a flash of great light and heat.

	And then, there was nothing.

Second Wave is a new campaign that continues the story of Descent: FreeSpace.  It begins seven years after the destruction of the Lucifer in subspace.

Notes on the campaign:
======================

>Notice that there is no mission 5b.  There will be no mission 5b.  Ever.  I skipped it so I could keep the numbering steady in the campaign manager.

>I know that the medals and promotions aren't exactly working right.  After the first few missions, you should be a Lt. Cmdr.  If not, well, I'll work on it.

=======================
Where to put the files:
=======================
Put all the files in the C:\FreeSpace\Data\Missions\ directory.  Then, to play the campaign, I would suggest you create a new player, then go to the campaign room and select "Second Wave Unit One: Balance of Power" from the campaigns list.

Some other things:
==================

On the Silent Threat CD, there's a directory called 'Extras.'  Open it and the directories inside it, and you'll find a bunch of videos... I think that they were 'cut' from the original FreeSpace.  Some of them were used in the credits (but only as single frames).


If you're still reading this, there's nothing more.  Okay?  Stop reading and go play FreeSpace!
