     Welcome to the BEST SWOS update files available anywhere. This archive
contains loads of SWOS update files for the 1997/1998 season and not only that
but some updated graphics so you really can pretend that there is an official
SWOS update for this season. And the best thing of all, its free!! So you
won't get ripped off again by Sensible.

     Please note, I did not create all these teams myself, many were ones that
I found on the Internet on various pages so if you wrote it, you should have
sent it to me and I would have included you in the credits properly. Also the
icon I made, which I incidently distributed with my Premier League 1996/97
update, must not be distributed without asking me first. I did not like
finding it available with several archives I found because the people who
distribited these did not get in touch with me about helping to make this
superb update, so they missed out on the opportunity to contribute. Too bad
for them I suppose, but if they want to help in the future I would be more
than happy to hear from them.

     I do not yet know whether or not I plan to release another update towards
the end of this season or at the beginning of next (or even around the World
Cup time) because I would really like to have more up to date teams but from
more countries. As you can see (or will do when you have installed these
teams) the ones that are included are great and very accurate so I would want
the majority of the SWOS teams to be more accurate not just the most popular
ones. I mean some body may want to do a career at Border Security... Please
get in touch with me if you want further updates especially if can help with
the more obscure teams.

     The reason I would not want to do a half release is because I am short on
time at the moment as my job has long hours and I have to use a computer all
day so I am often quite reluctant to use my Amiga in the evenings as I like to
have a break from staring at a monitor. And I really want to get on with some
of my games that I have planned.

     Currently I am converting my favourite Amiga game of all time to AGA
which is taking time as I have to code from scratch, do all the graphics
myself etc. The game, well there is a clue to it in every thing I write..

     Also look out for a game written by me with graphics by my brother called
Serious F1. It is our version of a Sensible Soccer/Golf etc. type game but
this time you are the manager of a Formula One team where you choose your
drivers, engines etc. and race around the worlds F1 circuits in an overhead
racing game.

     Listen out for any music by Abandoned Uranium Workings and The Deviants
too.

     Also watch out for me on the circuits of Great Britain as I am hoping to
compete in a racing championship of some sort next year (Formula Ford, Formula
First, Formula 600, Formula Vee or Caterham Super Sevens) depending on the
budget I get. Any willing sponsors out there??


Finally about this release:-         
     Note this archive is almost freely distributable and can be given away on
all AMIGA ONLY magazine cover disks and CD's (Amiga Format gave my Premier
League update away on their cover disk one month but did not put it on the CD
version!!!). If I find any of these updates on PC SWOS web sites or magazines
I will not be happy. Finally I would like to say to Sensible that they have
made a big mistake in ditching the Amiga for the PC. We all know the PC can't
handle games without a £2000 machine, so anyone thinking about switching to a
PC for games reasons, do what I did and buy a £200 Sony PlayStation to keep
you happy until everyone has bought a PowerPC chip and a graphics board for
their beloved Amigas. No one can seriously say they want to buy a PC for the
serious software and Windows 95 as Workbench pi$$es in the open mouth of it!!
(Please excuse the language..) I should know as I have to use a PC at work
every day. And the only good game on it is FreeCell that comes with Windoze.
Any one out there every successfully tried knocking up a quick anim or a tune
or even a small game on a PC for less than £100?? We can all do it on our
Amigas for less than a quid!!

     Anyway I have had my say!! Long live the Amiga, Damon Hill's successful
career, Chelsea's great results and Johnathan Pearce on Capital Gold

   @{fg highlight}Hard Drive Users -@{fg text}


   1 - Install SWOS 95/96, 96/97 or Euro 96 version to a place on your hard
       drive using Piotr Bieniek's excellent SWOS installer

   2 - Rename the directory to SWOS-9798 or something similar

   3 - Smash the Data/Team.XXX files included in this archive directly over
       the ones that exist in your SWOS-9798/Data directory

   4 - To update the menu graphics to say SWOS 97/98, copy the MENU*.* files
       from the Grafs directory in the archive over the ones in the 
       SWOS-9798/Grafs directory

   5 - Do the same with the CJCGRAFS and SWCPITCH files to update the
       advertisment boards in the game

   6 - And to update the loading screens do the same with the LOADER files

   7 - If you want NEW goal celebrations (raising shirt etc.), do the same
       with the CJCTEAM files

   8 - Load SWOS and play

   9 - Write or Email me (and the others who helped) to thank us for creating
       this wonderful update that would have cost you £10 if Sensible did it

   Note - There is a second versions of some datas labeled TEAMA.XXX. Try them
   both out as they are both great!

   @{fg highlight}Floppy Disk Users -@{fg text}


   1 - Buy a hard drive and follow the above instructions

   2 - If you don't do that then make some ILLEGAL copies of your original
       SWOS disks

   3 - Copy the files from this to wherever they belong on the disks as I
       don't know which disk contains what

   4 - Again thank me and the others for this




   Sorry no install script.
