                        Mega Boards for MegaBall!


          Here is my first set of Megaball Boards. They were created
          for Megaball AGA using an A1200.

          These boards where designed with looks in mind more than
          how they play. By that, I mean a number of them use up
          all the bricks on the screen to make their images. This
          makes them a bit more difficult to get going.

          I have tweaked the harder ones to be a bit easier as best
          I could.

          I worked really hard to get these boards to look the way
          they do. There are lots of 3D and shading effects. Many
          boards have a "computer" and/or "Amiga" theme.

          Be warned! you need the registered version of MegaballAGA
          to load in new board sets! The game is WELL worth
          registering, so by all means.......DO IT!!!! Besides,
          you'll miss out on these cool boards if you don't :-)

          After you give these a try, @{"please E-mail" link "Document_0" 0}
          me with your thoughts. Which were your favorites? Which were
          the worst?

                       Well what are you waiting for?
                          GET THE BALL BOUNCING!
