Congratulations! YOU are now the proud owner of not one,
but two - yes, two! - new landscape types for the game
Worms, The Director's Cut, from Team 17.

What's different about these ones?

Well..... Not that much, really... There's only so much
scope for change in Worms, but I try. :-)

The Bricks landscape is really an extra: It was the first
one I made, so it's a bit of an experiment, and to be
honest, it shows. I'll leave it at that before I run myself
into the ground.

The Amiga landscape is where it's at, though.

What you have here is a landscape based on our favorite
computer.

The land is a keyboard, complete with space bar and shift
key. Blow it away, and you'll see the circuit board under-
neath. :)

The objects vary from the Amiga tick logo, the boing ball,
to a rendition of Tut's head.

That's about it. Not much to describe, really.

Provided you've got a copy of Worms DC, you can install
them by copying them to the TWDIY directory in your Worms
disk/directory (but preferably not your original disk!)

But you already knew that, didn't you?

About me....? (do you really want to know..!?)

I am Simon Champion. I work in Buckinghamshire, England, as
a computer programmer (various platforms, but sadly not the
Amiga at work).

I program the Amiga a lot in my spare time, but I've yet to
realease anything onto the Aminet. It'll happen soon, though
I think! :)

I don't play a lot of computer games, but since I bought
Worms at the World of Amiga show recently, I've been hooked.

I have had an Amiga since 1986. First an A500, now I've gone
all the way: I currently use an A4000 with Cyberstorm 060,
Piccasso IV, 1.2 gig SCSI2 hd, 8xCDrom. I hate to sound like
I'm boasting, but I really do enjoy it! Roll on PowerUp!

You can contact me at:

I am occassionally to be found on AmIRC, under the nickname of
Spudley.

Please feel free to contact me at the above if you have anything to
say (except flames/spam/etc!). If you mail me at work, you're
guaranteed a quick response.
