Oliver Roberts Formula One Grand Prix Editor is a utility that 
allows you to edit almost every aspect of the game Formula One 
Grand Prix, making it harder and more enjoyable to play. You can 
race in the present season with the correct teams and car 
colours, or make your own teams etc. For more information on how 
to get a copy of the editor please feel free to contact me on the 
address below.

I also have available data files for use with the editor to 
enable you to race in any season going back to 1967, using the 
correct teams, drivers and car colours. Race as Gilles Villeneuve 
in the Ferrari, or Jackie Stewart in the Tyrrell. 

If you would like to know more about the data files or how to 
create your own cockpits then please feel free to contact me.
