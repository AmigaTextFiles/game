FIGP Cockpits

This as a collection of replacement cockpits for use in the game 
Formula One Grand Prix. They can be imported into the game using 
Oliver Roberts Grand Prix Editor, so you will need that program 
in order to use them.

The contents of this disk are freeware and as such can be freely 
used and distributed. All I ask is that you acknowledge my 
efforts when passing it on to others.

Created and compiled by Paul Snowdon.
