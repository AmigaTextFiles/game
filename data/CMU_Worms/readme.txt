Welcome to my first collection of worms levels for Amiga Worms, the best
platform ever to play Worms on.

These levels were done by Chris Underwood (CMU)

These levels are freely distributable, but you are not allowed to change any
of the files, then distribute them. Also, all the files must remain together.
If this is included on any CDs or Magazine coverdisks etc, I would like to
be notified. The only exception to this is the Aminet CD. This group of files
may be included on any Aminet CD without the need to notify me.

In the unlikely event that my minelayer damages something, I'm not responsible.

Right, cak legal stuff aside, we get to the archive. There are 6 levels, a
small program called the minelayer and a brush that you may find useful.

The levels.

2001
  Worms in space on a long mission can sometimes fall out with each other. In
this level, they have. They can't decide if the large square obelisk gave the
worms the intelligence to make bazookas, or if it gave them the intelligence
to make bannana bombs.
  Way too wormley to bother putting on space suits they step into the vacuum
armed to the saddle to settle the arguement once and for all.
  Parts of this level where rendered with Real3D, then dithered down to look
much worse. Still, with the low gravity and an opposing team to kick, 
no-worm is looking at the scenery.

AfterTheWorm
  2323 was the year of the Great Worm War. This was the war in which the giant
worms who had been living peacefully with the tiney and insignificant humans
decided that they should remove the Statue Of Liberty, and replace it with
the Statue Of Wormity. The humans didn't like this, and launched ICBM rockets
at one faction of worms in protest. The worm faction instantly assumed the
nukes where from their neighbouring worm faction and a great war broke out.
The humans living in the middle where quickly swept away by the superior
weapons of destruction held by the worms.

Blocks
  One day the worms where happily playing tetris on their Amigas when one of
the teams decided that if they got PCs then the game could be played quicker,
and then turns would come around more often.
  Of course, all the other teams instantly fell about laughing at the thought,
shouting abuse such as "Start: Flickery displays!" and "Win95; the most
expensive way to play solitare!". The worm's taunting was soon answered with
a few hundred minigun rounds, which were answered with a bannana bomb. A great
battle broke out and got relocated into a blocky tetris like world.

Boom
  The worms where stock taking in their general munitions stores, when a check
showed that a minigun round had gone missing! Pah, mising? Stolen more-like,
by those new worms over there! Get 'em!

Boom2
  After the battle from the 'Boom' level, the worms had to re-do the stock
take from scratch, having used substantially more rounds, shells and dynamite
than necessary to wipe out the offending worms. A careless worm accidentily
knocks a crate of un-primed mines from the top shelf to cover the floor quite
liberally. Another worm, carrying ready-primed mines slips in the mess, and
now the task of sorting the real mines from the fake ones begins...
  Warning, anyone with an unexpanded A1200 will not be able to play this
level due to a free memory bug in the coding. Sorry. I have included the next
(badly drawn) level for you people.

Mines
  A lamely drawn level that has been put through the minelayer. It is small
enough for anyone with 2Megs/HD to play it. It is also a good example of what
the minelayer actually does...

The brush.
  I have included a brush that is a perfect copy of a mine in this archive.
To make use of it in your levels, just lead DPaint or similar, and import
it as a brush.

The minelayer program.
  This is an ultra-simple program written in Amos (urgh) that basically puts
mines over an entire wormscape. The algorithm for deciding where a mine goes
is as follows: A point is picked on the screen. If the point is colour 0,
then we are above some land, so sink the mine down until we hit some, or run
off the bottom of the screen. Otherwise, we are in some land, so we can
trace the mine up until we hit some sky colour (colour 0). This is repeated
at approximate steps across the screen.
  To use the program, simply run it. A horid Amos requestor pops up asking
for a .wrm file to load in. Find one and select it. The program should work
on non-.wrm files, but I haven't tested it so it might not :)
  Once you are happy with the amount of mines hanging about, click a mouse
button and a save requestor pops up. If at any time you press cancel, the
program exits. If at any time you press Ctrl+C together, the program quits.
You can flip the workbench to the front/back with the Left Amiga+A key combo.
In the minelaying bit, you can scroll around the map with the mouse, kinda
like you can in worms.
  You will probably find that the files that the Minelayer makes do not get
saved correctly. Sorry, but Amos is like that. Still, to make them work, you
can load them into DPaint or similar then save them again. Set DPaint up to
be in a lowres mode, with 8 colours. When it asks if you'd like to change
to some other mode, refuse. Save the file back out and it will work fine
in Worms.
  If you find any bugs in this program, or have any ideas for future
enhancements, don't hesatate to email me. I promise to reply to all emails.
If you want the source (it's only about 20 lines anyway, I can't think why
anyone would want it), mail me and ask for it. I'll mail it back within a few
days.
