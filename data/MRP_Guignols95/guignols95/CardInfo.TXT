; Information file for the *new* cardset of the guignols.
; The pic is in 640x256 with 256 colours... well more exactly 256 greyscale...
; and 16 colours for the ECS version.
; I should used hires-lace, but I've got a 1083, so it's flicker...
; Perhaps having a cheaper SVGA could be nice, but all the banging-games,
; demos will not work in DBL-PAL ?!...
