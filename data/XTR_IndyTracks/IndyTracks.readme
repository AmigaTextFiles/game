This circuits have been created using XtremeEd,
that is given on the Xtreme Data Disks.
This archive contents:
Indianapolis1: a circuit with an oval form.
Indianapolis2: a difficult circuit :).
In theory, this circuits should work with the basis
(the three first disks, and nothing else), but they
haven't been tested with this "small" configuration of
XtremeRacing
