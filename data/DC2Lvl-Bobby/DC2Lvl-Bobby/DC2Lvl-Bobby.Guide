Because DimondCaves II is now FREEWARE an it have a better Grafik, so I
convert this Files from Allan Rasmussen to this files, which work 100% with
DiamondCaves II.

This was hard work, because you must select every level alone, because the
import fnkt. dont worked which DiamondCaves I Files correct.

Install: Start the Leveleditor and select, Import Levelgroup, then select the
File in the EM-Bobby.lvl Directory. Thats all !


PLEASE NOTICS, THIS LEVELS WAS DESIGNT, MAKED AND PLANNED BY ALLAN RASMUSSEN.
