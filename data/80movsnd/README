To Install:
**********************************************************

    This is very simple.  You need Worms:DC, an AGA Amiga,
and about 2 megs of free hard drive space.  Just unpack
this archive, and put it into TWSAMPLES in your Worms:DC
directory.  Make sure all the sounds are in a folder first
though.


About this sound set:
**********************************************************
    I made this sound set out of my fondness for the 80's.
Most of these samples are from movies from the 80's.  I
realize that some are from the late 70's or early 90's so
don't tell me what I already know!  I people enjoy this
sound set.  If they do, I'll continue to make more.  Some
of the movies these sounds are from are:

Back to the Future          PeeWee Herman movies
Bill & Ted's Adventures     Ghostbusters
Highlander                  RoboCop
Naked Gun                   Indiana Jones
E.T.                        They Live
The Shining                 Three Amigos
Top Gun                     Croc. Dundee
Airplane                    Batman
Armed & Dangerous           Aliens
Predator                    Spaceballs
Big                         Caddyshack
2001 & 2010 movies

I know some of these are not 80's but do you know how hard
it is to find sounds of movies from the 80's?  It was for
me anyways.  If you like this sound set, then you could
e-mail me telling me what you thought, or download my
other sound sets.  Currently, the other ones are a Dr.Who
and Army of Darkness sample set.  They can also be found
on the Aminet in game/data.  Look for:

AODsnds.lha         *or*    Drwho-dc1.lha
                            Drwho-dc2.lha

Merry Christmas to all those wormers that support the
Amiga.

Toodles,
