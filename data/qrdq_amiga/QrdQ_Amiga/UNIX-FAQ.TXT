(1) Linux- and Amiga-specific extensions

With the conversion of QrdQ - The Movie to Linux and for the Amiga, a few
changes had to be made. First off all, we had to replace the work of
StrangeUtil by other applications, which turned out not to be too easy
everytime.

Basically, we took a PAK-compiler and a MP3-decoder for each platform, and
call them via the respective install-scripts in order to replace the work of
StrangeUtil (whiched worked out quite well). Due to some complications with the
available tools, we were forced to release all the QrdQ data as kind of "open
source" though, which means unPAKed and accessible to anyone. It will be put
into a PAK file during installation however, so you don't have to mind file-
overloads at your hard-disk :P

Another, more important change was the conversion of FIXLOOP.EXE, which had to
be made. The latest version now supports the choice between 11Khz and 44Khz
quality sound on both platforms, which is an exclusive feature that is missing
under Windows =)


(2) New utilities used

These are the tools which come into use under Linux or at the Amiga:

1) Not included - get them by your own!

  Linux: mpg123 <http://www.mpg123.de/>
         sox <http://sox.sourceforge.net/>
  Amiga: MPEGA <no URL given - see below>

  Used to convert the MP3s to WAV.

  You'll have to get them first if you don't have installed them already.

  Linux users which have one of the latter Red Hat packages installed might very
  likely also have "mpg123" and "sox" already, as they come with Red Hat 6.2.

2) Included in the download - you don't have to bother.

  Linux: Qfiles from the Qutils collection <http://openquartz.sourceforge.net/>
  Amiga: Qtools <no URL given - see below>

  These progs build the PAK files for Quake after MP3 conversion has finished.

  Qtools is freeware and all of it's belonging files are kept in a subdir of
  the AMIGASTUFF drawer.

  Qfiles had to be modified slightly in order to make it work properly with
  command-line parameters. A copy of our modified Qfiles source can be found at
  <http://www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?/planetquake/illmind/misc/qutils.zip>

  (just for the lawyer ;)

  There are no seperate webpages for MPEGA or Qtools given, but you should be
  able to get them from Aminet <http://www.aminet.net/~aminet/>


(3) More thank-sayings

Of course, I have to express my thanks to the two guys responsible for these
excellent conversions:

Robert Seace (Linux) and Thomas Veress (Amiga)

Robert firstly "hacked" himself into QrdQ in order to make it run on his Linux-
machine, and such brought up the idea of converting it in the first place.

Thomas on the other hand sent me a trickdemo for my site when I noticed that
he actually was an Amiga-Quaker, who must be as scarce as white elephants I
believe. Beeing a nostalgic child of the Amiga era by myself, I was quite
enthusiasic hearing about the possibility to do a Amiga-conversion as well.

A huge "fat-ass props" may be spoken out to both of you for doing all that,
and beeing both patient with me and my lazyness (most often due to real-life
issues) and still trustworthy when it came down to necessary tasks which had to
be solved. Believe me, it wasn't too easy organizing something I didn't have
much of a clue of either ;)


(4) Open questions? 

If you still got questions about QrdQ in general, send some e-mail to
Nagasaki@PlanetQuake.com, and I'll try to answer as soon as possible.

If you your question is specifically related to the Linux- or the Amiga-
version, I'd be glad if you could straight step into contact with the guys who
know what they are talking about:

For Linux-related questions: Robert A. Seace <ras@magrathea.com>
For Amiga-related questions: Thomas Veress <COJO-D@gmx.de>

And now I hope you enjoy my run!
