(1) Introduction

Well, here it is - finally!

Ladies and gentleman, I've left you suffering long enough! Here is what you've
been waiting for so tensefully lately: Quake redone Quick - The Movie. I
apologize for all the delays and wrong promises, and believe that the result
was most probably worth waiting for!

Yet, I have to address a few people with thank-sayings at this point. First
of all, I want to thank the Academy, for making all that possible! Thanks also
to mom and dad, Jesus, ...

***

Seriously, welcome to Quake redone Quick - The Movie! In fornt of you a damn
hot piece of Quake-machinima and -gameplay, playing through the whole game on
the hardest possible skill level in only 13:11 minutes! What, you don't believe
it? Uhh, well you do. Allright, I suppose you must have seen something similar
before already. Who hasn't, prepare yourself for some mind-boggling experience!

First I wanted to write something personal in this introduction, express the
first feelings after finishing QrdQ. Unfortunately, I can't say I have the
freedom of relaxing right now, and let those expressions settle. Maybe I will
be able to write something more personal in the homepage-update which announces
this run later today, or if anything fails, read the history-section in the FAQ
which may include this or that personal detail about the background of this
project as well.

But now, I'll just shut up and let you explore the release by your own. Have
fun and enjoy Quake redone Quick - The Movie!


(2) Installation

(2.1) Quick overview

Win32/MS-DOS:

1) Find your main Quake directory
2) Create a sub-directory named "QRDQ"
3) Extract everything you've downloaded into that directory
4) Run QRDQ.BAT (crucial)

Windows 2000:

   Repeat steps 1-3 from above

1) Get alternate .BAT files from the W2K subdir
2) Put them in the QRDQ dir and thus replace the existing files
3) Run QRDQ.BAT
4) Start Quake using the command-line parameter "-game qrdq"

   Repeat step 3 each time you want to add new PAK files to the library

Linux:

1) Extract the downloaded archive: tar xzvf qrdq_linux.tgz
2) Run the install script: ./setup.sh
3) Optionally remove the now unneeded install script: rm setup.sh
4) Start Quake using the command-line parameter "-game qrdq"

Amiga:

1) Extract the LHA archive you downloaded
2) Click the QRDQ_AMIGA_INSTALL icon
3) Follow the instructions on the screen
4) Start Quake using the command-line parameter "-game qrdq"

(2.2) Details

In order to install Quake redone Quick - The Movie, you will first need to find
your main Quake directory. It probably has the name "Quake" and contains such
items as your Quake executable programs (QUAKE.EXE, GLQUAKE.EXE etc.) and your
ID1 subdirectory. You should make a subdirectory of this main directory. Give
it the name "QRDQ".

Four different .zip files are available for your download. For each, there's
also a smaller .dz version available instead. Included in every download are
several batch- and text-files, as well as some executables - read more about
that further below.

Here is a summary of the different downloads. It reviews the contents of the
ZIPs and shows how you can handle any upgrades you make.

1) QRDQ_FULL.ZIP   - This is everything in one bundle.
   (11.0 MB)
   QRDQ_FULL.DZ      It consists of a QRDQ.PAK containing the movie along with
   (6.98 MB)         sound-fx, the first-person demos and various extras.
                     Unzip everything into your QRDQ sub-directory, and head
                     on over to section 2.3!

                     Total size of installation: 64 Mb

2) QRDQ.ZIP        - This is the main movie release.
   (8.25 MB)
   QRDQ.DZ           It consists of a MOVIE.PAK containing the movie along
   (5.73 MB)         with sound-fx and various extras. Unzip everything into
                     your QRDQ sub-directory, and head on over to section 2.3!

                     To add first-person demos to this version, download
                     QRDQ_1311.ZIP and unzip it into your QRDQ sub-directory,
                     thus placing the FIRST.PAK the upgrade contains alongside
                     your existing files.

                     Total size of installation: 52 Mb

3) QRDQ_1311.ZIP   - These are the plain first-person demos.
   (3.38 MB)
   QRDQ_1311.DZ      It's basically just the FIRST.PAK which contains the
   (1.81 MB)         first-person demos and the menu, and which can be run
                     independently - on any platform. Just unzip it into your
                     QRDQ sub-directory, rename FIRST.PAK to PAK0.PAK and run
                     Quake using the command-line parameter "-game qrdq". You
                     can skip section 2.3 in this case.

                     If you however want to upgrade it with the movie-version,
                     download QRDQ.ZIP and unzip it into that subdirectory,
                     thus placing the MOVIE.PAK the upgrade contains alongside
                     your existing files. Mind: incase of an upgrade, that
                     compatibility would of course lapse! Due, PAK0.PAK should
                     receive it's original name again, and you will need to
                     make use of QRDQ.BAT once again. (see movie/full version)

                     Total size of installation: 13 Mb

4) QRDQ_ADDON.ZIP  - In the near future, I will with any luck release a
   (unknown size)    seperate PAK file as kind of an add-on to the movie- and
                     full-version of QrdQ, that will feature extra vocals for
                     all the oneliners and possibly some more candy.

                     This upgrade will be the SPEECH.PAK file that contains
                     the extra material. Uncompress it into your QRDQ sub-
                     directory, thus placing the SPEECH.PAK the upgrade
                     contains alongside your existing files. Just start QrdQ
                     like you used to start the movie or the full version, and
                     QRDQ.BAT will detect the new files.

5) QRDQ_LINUX.ZIP  - This is the full-version release for Linux.
   (11.2 MB)
                     It contains of an install-script SETUP.SH and all neces-        
                     sary files included in PAKTREE.TAR.

                     Just run the shell-script and you will be guided through
                     the installation-process, which also requires some addi-
                     tional outer house utilities - detailed information on
                     that can be found in the README.LINUX textfile. After that
                     there's nothing more to do for you, except starting Quake
                     using the command-line parameter "-game qrdq". You can
                     skip the entire section 2.3.

                     Total size of installation: 64 Mb

5) QRDQ_AMIGA.LHA  - This is the full-version release for the Amiga.
   (11.7 MB)
                     It contains of an install-script QRDQ_AMIGA_BATCH and all
                     necessary files stuffed together two subdirs.

                     Just click the QRDQ_AMIGA_SETUP icon, and you will be
                     prompted for your Quake drawer, after which everything
                     automates, given that you are equipped with "mpega", a
                     small tool you can retreive through Aminet. All you have
                     to do when the installation finishes is to run Quake using
                     the command-line parameter "-game qrdq". There's no need
                     for you to read over section 2.3.

                     Total size of installation: 64 Mb (110 Mb temporary)

7) QRDQ_ADDUX.ZIP  - The speech-addon, compiled for Linux and the Amiga. It
   (unknown size)    will most probably contain install-scripts for both
                     platforms which will set you up. As soon as you fire up
                     QrdQ after that, all the new features will be available.

Note: it doesn't matter if a few files get overwritten incase of an upgrade to
the full version, by either adding the movie-version to the first-person demos
or the other way around. All files which have the same name do usually also
have equal content! Oh, and of course an upgrade to the full-version does
support every feature of the 'plain' full-version as well - so if you are not
sure wether you want to start with the huge 11 MB download instantly, you
might get the version you are more interested in seperately first!

(2.3) Strange Utility

Both the full- and the movie-version of Quake redone Quick - The Movie (Win32
and MS-DOS version) come with Strange Company's "Strange Utility" and it's
accompanying files, which is required to install these two packages and the
add-on. Not only that, but during this process, a small patch will also have to
be run on one of the files StrangeUtil produces.

The best thing for you to do would be to simply run QRDQ.BAT, which automates
that process. QRDQ.BAT is also the file you run each time you want to watch
Quake redone Quick - The Movie.

A special note for Windows 2000 users: you will have to replace the original
QRDQ.BAT and several other files with those you find in the W2K directory
BEFORE you install. You can watch the movie by running Quake with the command-
line parameter "-game qrdq", but each time you add a new PAK file to the
library (by doing upgrades to the version of QrdQ you have installed) you'll
have to run QRDQ.BAT once more in advance.

If anything fails, here is a way to install Quake redone Quick - The Movie
manually, even though this is generally NOT recommended:

  1) Go to the QrdQ sub-directory and run "STRANGE.BAT <parameter>" from that
     path as many times as necessary, where <parameter> is supposed to contain
     one of the following values:

     QRDQ   - incase you've downloaded and extracted the full-version of QrdQ,
              recognizeable by the QRDQ.PAK file located in your QRDQ folder.
     MOVIE  - incase you've downloaded and extracted the movie-version of QrdQ,
              recognizeable by the MOVIE.PAK file located in your QRDQ folder.
     SPEECH - incase you've downloaded and extracted the speech-addon,
              recognizeable by the SPEECH.PAK file located in your QRDQ folder.

     It is crucial that you run STRANGE.BAT directly from that path, otherwise
     the script-processing will screw up! Do not try to process the scripts by
     hand, since you will skipped the important adjustment by the tiny patch!

  2) Rename all the PAK files hierarchic (pak0.pak, pak1.pak, ...). Possible
     (speak: none-pointless) combinations are
   
     QRDQ.PAK   +  SPEECH.PAK
     MOVIE.PAK  +  SPEECH.PAK
     FIRST.PAK  +  MOVIE.PAK
     FIRST.PAK  +  MOVIE.PAK  +  SPEECH.PAK

     ...as well as QRDQ.PAK, FIRST.PAK or MOVIE.PAK seperately, of course.

  3) Start Quake using the command-line parameter "-game qrdq", maybe also ex-
     tended by an increased "-zone" value, "-zone 1024" for instance.

All these is happening on your own risk, so make damn sure you are aware of
what you are doing. If you are confused by now you are not, for instance :)

(2.4) The menu interface

The run is played from a menu interface, so that you can choose to play the
whole run, or individual episodes, or individual levels - optionally in re-
filmed mode. Using the menus should be mostly self-explanatory, except the
super-duper-secret menu which only appears once you type the ultra-mega-secret
code :)

I also included some commentary on the demos that you may wish to turn on and
read if you want to know what I have to say about the levels.

(2.5) Option keys

There are several special keys you can use whilst a demo is playing:

[F1]  decrease viewsize
[F2]  increase viewsize
[F3]  turn volume down
[F4]  turn volume up

[F5]  lower detail level
[F6]  higher detail level
[F7]  change brightness                (GLQuake: change water-transparence)
[F8]  toggle performance-graph on/off  (GLQuake: toggle shadows on/off)

[F9]  advance to the next level (e.g. if playing an episode run)
[F10] stop playback and return to the menu
[F11] start/stop menu sound (no effect during playback)
[F12] quit Quake immediately

I guess that F9 and F10 are of the most importance for you; everything else
does only exist in case that you disagree with the default settings ;)

(2.6) Known playback problems

Mac users are unfortunately irrefutably limited to the first-person version.

Under MS-DOS, you might want to get CWSDPMI first, in order to increase your
DPMI memory, of which Strange Utility requires quite a bunch of to even run.

If anything else dares to trouble you, I'll be there trying to sort things out.
I hope I did everything to prevent you encountering any major problems in
installing and running QrdQ, so please try not to disappoint me :}

possible to take advantage of internal route-discussions, unreleased tools
and tech-support in general.

If you want to have some more information about the people who helped me
with this project, refer to the FAQ!


(6) Last words

I want to say thanks to everybody who helped me with this project, and be it
alone by not claiming me mad :) There're just too much to mention right now,
yet if you are not listed below and consider yourself a friend of mine, you
won't care anyways.

A special mention deserves Johannes Bock, who always encouraged, criticized
and listened to me. Without you, I might have dropped the whole project a long
time ago. Although you never got around downloading ICQ, #nagasaki rules!!

Then there's Ilkka, who hosted one of the most awesome events in my life:
SpeedCon 2000. I had a really great time in Finland, and all of you QdQ guys
just rock in your very own way!

Of course I won't override Marlo, who made it possible to repeat the event in
2001, and went sure we had loads of fun there as well!

You guys also introduced me to some of the most ILL-MINDED Drum'n'Bass tracks
around, and such I enjoy the music big time nowadays! (Jesse - please also
feel addressed.)

Thanks also to the whole PlanetQuake staff for hosting me! No matter if you are
still working for PQ or not, your support has always been overwhelming. Thanks.

Big-Ups from the 62 crew: keep that underground shit alive, we created our very
own scene!

Finally, the one and only: Lina, for making me stronger, and the other tiny
things a man requires from time to time ;) You were so tolerant concerning
Quake, even if you could have made me stop it if you wanted... LU like hell!

I want to kazumsihtrofdogknaht, since that's what keeps me alive.


Comments are very welcome: <mailto:Nagasaki@PlanetQuake.com>

I hope you enjoy my run!
