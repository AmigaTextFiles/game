Short: French swos Datafile 98/99
I love Amiga swos and have been tinkering with piotr Bieniek'
Swosed for quite some time. There has not been any recent datafile
uploads to Aminet, so I thought I would do it myself.
This has been packed with Propack so it will fit on Floppy-disk as
well as Hard-drive with no problems.
Also this is a 'clean' datafile. i.e. If you copy this over your
current French datafile then repack poolplyr.dat in Swosed it will
not crash at the end of a season.

If you have more accurate information on England or any other
league please e-mail me on purserr@sbu.ac.uk (Robert Purser) and I will try to
accomodate. Thanks enjoy an accurate English leagues!
