Well here's the first mission of a campaign i'm planning to construct, 
set 15 years after the destruction of the original Lucifer in the sol
jump node. This level is still in its beta stage, so any feedback would
be greatly appreciated. NOTE: I've made this mission a multiplayer level,
so more people can see it.

contact me at imaginaryguy@yahoo.com if you have any suggestions/queries.



HOW TO INSTALL

simply unzip the file to the data/missions directory of your freespace folder.
It should then be selectable in your multiplayer mode.

Good luck!
