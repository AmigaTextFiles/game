   D-GENERATION LEVEL SAVES
   ------------------------

   If you have this game installed on your harddisk you can use these saves to start at any
   level between level 81 and 89.

   Extract the archive to any partition other than the one that contains the D-Generation
   directory.Copy one of the save files (e.g. SAVE.81) to to the D-Generation drawer and
   rename it as SAVE.DAT.

   Start the game and press the FIRE button until you come to the beginning sceene.Hold <Alt>
   and press <R> to restore the game from the save file.You will jump to the beginning of
   that level.

   The save files included in this archive have been edited to give the player max. power.

   If you will start at another level you will have to delete the SAVE.DAT file,copy another
   one and rename it as SAVE.DAT and restore to it (Alt+R).

   Here are some key combinations in the game:

   <Alt+S> = Save
   <Alt+R> = Restore (load saved game)
   <Ctrl+R>= Restart at the beginning of actual level)
   <S>     = Status

   <Ctrl+Q>= Quit (to Workbench)

   Enjoy !
