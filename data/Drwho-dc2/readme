Short:    Dr. Who sample set for Worms:DC (part 2)
Author:   cjmhlavaty@worldnet.att.net  (That1Guy)

Type:     game/data


Installing:

   For this you need Worms:DC, an AGA Amiga, a hard drive with about 2.5 megs
free space.  To install, put all the samples from part 1 and 2 into a
directory (ex: DrWho) and place that in your WormsDC/TWSamples directory.
These sounds can be loaded in Worms:DC by going to options and selecting the
right folder.

Some Legal Stuff:

   All of these sound files should be alright.  Most of them are from the
Doctor Who Wav Archive (www.iceworld.org/~mrogers) and a few others from
various sources.  Some are from Monty Python because I just couldn't leave
them out.  If you think these sounds are violating any copyright laws then
let me know.

Thanks:

   Mike Rogers:  for letting me use his sounds
   Redvers:      for helping me pack these files
   Dr Who:       for always being there

The rest:

   There are two different files containing this archive.  The reason for
this is because I use PC for net.  If you use PC for net, and don't have a
high density disk drive, then use file split on the PC and the join command
on the Amiga.  I am constantly updating this archive, so look out for
updates.


sometimes in #Worms
