Welcome to my first ever release of 'XTreme Racing' Tracks using the new
Track Designer found on Silltunna Software's Data Disk.

To use these Tracks you must own the full original game of XTR.   The data
disk release of XTR is not required for the first 4 tracks but is required 
for the 5th.

Please read:-

@{"Important Copyright Page" link "Copyright"}

Tracks- @{" SkullArmy1 " link "SkullArmy1"} @{" SkullArmy2 " link "SkullArmy2"} @{" SkullArmy3 " link "SkullArmy3"} @{" SkullArmy4 " link "SkullArmy4"} @{" SkullArmy5B " link "SkullArmy5B"}

@{" Skull Army's Ad. " link "AD"}

If you like these Tracks then please send me a post card or something!!  Or
BETTER still register to one of my great Shareware Games as above.  You will
NOT be disappointed.

Any one wishing to send me their own Tracks, then please do so.  I will just
'Lap' them up.  If you supply a stamped Addressed Envelope I will send you my
latest tracks in return, if any. (I will only be able to do this for people
living in England.)

Find also, a copy of my Lap Records File in which you can merge with your own.

@{b}Message to Silltunna Software:@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Excellent Game, THE BEST GAME EVER, But. . . . .

* How about a mouse control.  Play either Virtual Karting or Indy 500 with a mouse
  and feel the difference.

* How about 3 Lap Records instead of 1?  The (2nd, and 3rd) info could be put on
  a second 'Lap Records' file for compatibility with older versions of XTR.

* How about making an option to swap the 'Fire button' and 'Up' on the Joystick.

* How about fixing the bug, where the background graphics do not scroll at the
  same speed as the foreground graphics?

* As from version 2.0 of XTR, the computer players do not seem to fire any more?
  Not sure why?

* Tell me I should get a life?

Here's looking forward for XTR 2!!!!

Cheers!!! and Bye.

@node "AD" "ADVERTISEMENT"
Also available from me are 4 other games.  These games are Shareware.
Restricted versions of theses games can be found in the Public Domain.  The
full versions can be bought from me (the author) at a very cheap price.

The games are as follows:-

@{b}ALIEN FISH FINGER@{ub}   @{"Screen Shot" system "ppshow >nil: AFFpicture"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This game is a Flip Screen, Platform, Arcade, Shoot em'up.  You control a
bloke, named 'Frank Finger', around a deadly alien infested planet.  You are
armed with an upgradable super weapon, which comes complete with a deadly
powerful Grenade launcher.

The game is a sort of 'Turrican' meets 'Worms'.  If you don't own a copy, buy
a copy now!

Mag. Review Quotes:-
@{i}"....your missions take you through some weird and wonderful worlds in which 
you explore numerous screens and shoot everything in sight...." 
"...the sprites may be tiny, but you can clearly see what's going on, right down 
to the streams of blood flowing from open wounds." 
"...the sprites move with surprising grace in all directions.  Along the way 
you'll come across plenty of aliens and space craft, and it's all pretty 
impressive stuff  to be honest." @{ui}  @{b}Amiga Action (September 95)@{ub}

@{i}"In  short, AFF is the best PD game I have ever played (and  I've played a few) 
The difficulty level is set just right so you always find something new, the 
missions are poriginal and it is extremely addictive."   @{UI}
@{B}                      ShareWorld 7 Disk Magazine.     Overall Score 94% @{ub}

Price @{b}£3.99 @{ub}(U.K. Sterling Pounds)
Countries other than the U.K. can pay by sending cash for £5.00 (U.K. Sterling Pounds)
                                           _________

@{B}WIRED CHAOS@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Multi-player light cycles clone with many power-ups and features.  This is
probably one of the best light cycle clones there is.  If you don't take my word
for it, check out what the magazines said about it.
@{i}
"Occasionally a PD game comes in that we all play for hours.  Wired Chaos is 
the best version of Light Cycles available.  So there!....." 
"...in fact basically, it's just about the best PD game we've come across in 
quite some time.  I beg and implore you to buy the shareware version and 
encourage more top products like this."  @{ui}@{B}Amiga Action (Game of the Month)@{UB}

@{i}"....Playability is present in copious amounts, and a good many hours could
be spent crowded around the keyboard with a bunch of partially inebriated
companions revelling in the addictive action." @{ui}  @{b}Amiga Computing (Game of the Month)

Price @{b}£3.75 @{ub}(U.K. Sterling Pounds)
Countries other than the U.K. can pay by sending cash for £5.00 (U.K. Sterling Pounds)
                                          __________


@{b}HYDROZONE@{ub}
~~~~~~~~~~
Fly through fast, speedy 3D tunnels trying not to crash.
Mag. Review Quotes of HydroZone:-
@{i}"This shareware effort, from little known Skull Army Software, could with a 
lot of polishing pass for a commercial release.  As it stands at the moment it 
is far better than average PD games, the first in fact to earn our all-new PD 
games of the month accolade."   @{ui}@{B}  Amiga Action (Game of the Month)@{UB}

Plus also:-

@{B}SPEED RACER FX@{UB}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Sequel to the above, but so much better.  Race against Human or computer
players, up to 6 in a league, through super fast 3D tunnels.
Plus define your own using the supplied Tunnel Designer.
A recommended buy, if you are a speed freak.

Buy Both @{B}'HydroZone'@{UB} and @{B}'Speed Racer FX'@{ub} for only @{B}£3.99@{UB} (U.K. Sterling Pounds)
Countries other than the U.K. can pay by sending cash for £5.00 (U.K. Sterling Pounds)
                                          __________


@{B}SKULL ARMY ACCOLADE PACK 1.1@{UB}
