Misc. Author Info       : This campaign is designed for AVERAGE (completed Main campaign on Medium skill) to EXPERT players (completed Main Campaign on Hard or Insane) and is designed to be fairly hard.  NOVICE players should look elsewhere.
			  Freespace Campaign designed from scratch
			  Missions 2 and 10 are not completeable on hard.  Mission 4 is not completable in single player, but it makes for great multiplayer.
			  Do NOT save over these files if you intend on changing them (use a diff. file name).
Additional Credits to   : Everyone who put up with me when I kept saying this would be done in one week for about six weeks before the release.
Special Thanks to	: Solrazor for sending me the first major bug report (the sheild breaker bug) and being nice enough to tell me if the fix works.  Also was nice to be the first to reveiw my mission on the Descent Chronicles page. Thanks again Solrazor.

Version info:	*** Version 5.0 (5/13/99)***
		Previously unknown minor (major?) bug in mission 6 to 7 is fixed.  You would always get taken to the red-alert mission even if you didn't complete mission 6.  This is fixed by disabling the warp drive on mission 6 as soon as it starts.
		Adjusted mission 10 so you now get an ending on very easy.  Several people weren't too happy about it so I changed it.  There still isn't much of an ending, but that's because this is episode one of a 4 episode campaign.
		No grammar or spelling fixes.

		*** Version 4.0 (5/9/99)*** 
		In mission 9 (Bring the Giant Down) - the Malice seems to be there even if you destroyed it in the earlier mission.  
		The reason is that the mission was using the old file names.  The problem is fixed (at least should be).  
	
		Minor fixs: Mission 9: Ulysses fighters on GTA side in briefing and in the mission.  The problem is the GTA doesn't have those fighters created (yet) in my storyline.
			    Mission 9: The Ursa Bombers have banshee turrets and the Valkyries have banshee guns.  Problem: GTA doesn't have banshee guns.  This has changes now, but I adjusted the mission accordingly.
			    Fixed debriefing in mission 4 - referred to Reliant instead of Wolverine in recommendation
			    Mission 4 - Lakshmi has one less wing, but this isn't saying much since there are six 16 kamakazi fighters to deal with instead of 20.  Unfair, yes. Impossible, possibly. Designed to fail the mission to begin with, yes.
			    This is also for multiplayer missions.
		
		Other: the multiplayer mission are now included in the .ZIP file.  The mission are for "Ghost in the Darkness", "Run For the Hills", and "Outta the Fire, Into the Inferno".


		*** Version 3.0 ***
		The largest fix is a problem that was occuring before mission 5, where the game crashed with an error message about the Sheild Break gun.  This is caused from having the Silent Threat add-on.  This problem is now fixed.
		Minor changes to some grammer/spelling errors.
		Mission 5: Messages refered to the "Reliant" instead of "Wolverine" (Reliant was the orginal ship name) - this is now corrected.
		Other missions had NavBouy briefing images instead of Jump Nodes - this is now completely fixed (I think).

		
		*** Version 2.0 ***
		Several changes from version 1.0 released on 5/3/99
		Optional animation was completely removed since it had nothing to do with anything and to save space on the web server.
		Breifing on the last mission was finished


		*** Version 1.0 ***
		Only released to the public for one day.
		Nothing to major, had several bugs, mostly fixed.
