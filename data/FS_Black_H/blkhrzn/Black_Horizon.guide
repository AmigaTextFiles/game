 *** Version 5.0 (5/13/99)***
Previously unknown minor (major?) bug
in mission 6 to 7 is fixed. You would
always get taken to the red-alert
mission even if you didn't complete
mission 6.  This is fixed by disabling
the warp drive on mission 6 as soon as
it starts.
Adjusted mission 10 so you now get an
ending on very easy.  Several people
weren't too happy about it so I changed
it. There still isn't much of an ending,
but that's because this is episode one
of a 4 episode campaign.
No grammar or spelling fixes.

*** Version 4.0 (5/9/99)*** 
In mission 9 (Bring the Giant Down)-the 
Malice seems to be there even if you
destroyed it in the earlier mission.  
The reason is that the mission was using
the old file names. The problem is fixed
(at least should be).  
Minor fixs: Mission 9: Ulysses fighters
on GTA side in briefing and in the mission.
The problem is the GTA doesn't have those
fighters created (yet) in my storyline.
Mission 9: The Ursa Bombers have banshee
turrets and the Valkyries have banshee
guns. Problem: GTA doesn't have banshee
guns. This has changes now, but I adjusted
the mission accordingly. Fixed debriefing
in mission 4 - referred to Reliant instead
of Wolverine in recommendation
Mission 4 - Lakshmi has one less wing, but
this isn't saying much since there are six
16 kamakazi fighters to deal with instead
of 20.  Unfair, yes. Impossible, possibly.
Designed to fail the mission to begin with,
yes.
This is also for multiplayer missions.
Other: the multiplayer mission are now
included in the .ZIP file.  The mission
are for "Ghost in the Darkness",
"Run For the Hills", and "Outta the Fire,
Into the Inferno".

*** Version 3.0 ***
The largest fix is a problem that was
occuring before mission 5, where the
game crashed with an error message about
the Sheild Break gun.  This is caused from
having the Silent Threat add-on. This problem
is now fixed.
Minor changes to some grammer/spelling errors.
Mission 5: Messages refered to the "Reliant"
instead of "Wolverine" (Reliant was the
orginal ship name) - this is now corrected.
Other missions had NavBouy briefing images
instead of Jump Nodes - this is now completely
fixed (I think).

*** Version 2.0 ***
Several changes from version 1.0 released
on 5/3/99
Optional animation was completely removed
since it had nothing to do with anything
and to save space on the web server.
Briefing on the last mission was finished

*** Version 1.0 ***
Only released to the public for one day.
Nothing to major, had several bugs, mostly fixed.
