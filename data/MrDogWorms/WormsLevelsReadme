Introduction
@{ub}
This is my first collection of Worms levels (me being @{"Chris Spicer" link about_me}).
Having seen some of the Worms discs, I was dissappointed by their content;
they only contained five-or-so levels, and no matter how good they were that
doesn't seem like many to me.

I decided to put loadsa levels together on one disc, which is why you'll
find a massive @{b}23@{ub} levels on this disc! Incredible, I know!

Well, you could just load up Worms and use the levels straight from this

into the custom_levels drawer of your Worms directory. It's your choice!

Just to be different, and because it's the kind of thing I like to do,
I've included a description of each of the levels in the form of a little

Bricks 
@{ub}
It all started one morning when a group of builders returned to their
construction site to find that their unfinished building had been ravaged
by what looked like small explosions. The partly destroyed buildings were
covered in splatters of blood, and further trails led off into the grass.

The builders could find no trace of who or what had done this damage, and
they spent the rest of the day rebuilding the damaged brickwork.

The next morning the builders found their work ruined again. In an effort to
protect their handiwork they put up an electric fence and bought in guard 
dogs, but neither of these measures prevented the bricks being damaged.

In a final act of desperation, one of the builders set up his video camera
to monitor the site overnight. The next morning the site was once again a 
wreck. The builders played back the video tape, and this is what they saw...

@node pencils
@{b}
Pencils
@{ub}
The Worms tribes had almost run out of pencils, and so a great meeting was
called.

The tribes met in the centre of Wormville around their one remaining pencil,
and they talked, they argued, they discussed, and, in the end, they came to
the same conclusion that people through the ages had come to.
@{i}
Somebody steals all the pencils.
@{ui}
The worms, being the violent, bloodthirsty lot that they were, decided to do
something about it. They set a trap using their last pencil, which was
placed in a cage withthe door open, and then they waited.

Sure enough, just after midnight, a tiny gnome crept into the Wormville,
spotted the pencil, and went to get it. The worms slammed the cage door
after him and locked it.

At first the gnome was reluctant to discuss where he'd taken all the 
pencils. However, the Worms presented a convincing argument, pointing out
the injustice of stealing, their basic right to own pencils, and the fact
that they had more weaponry than the entire cast of Starship Troopers in
the next room, coupled with the fact that there were plenty of gnomes about,
and the world wasn't going to miss one.

Dazzled by the blinding logic of the Worms arguments, the gnome reluctantly
agreed to take the Worms to the place he kept the world's stolen pencils.
Without a word of warning, he whipped out his huge wand and waved it around.
The Worms were magically transported to a special place down the back of
the Sofa of the Universe, where there were more than enough pencils to go
around.

 But the Worms didn't want to share. There was only one sensible solution.
But the Worms decided to have a big fight instead!

@endnode
@node Toyland
@{b}
Toyland
@{ub}
Toyland was created by Worm elders as a place for young Worms to train. The
bright, colourful design was considered for young Worms. If any actually
survived their training was considered complete...

(See also @{"Metal" link metal} and @{"Flat" link flat})
@endnode
@node custard
@{b}
Custard
@{ub}
When the great Worm inventor, Thaddeus P. Worm, announced he'd discovered
an ancient recipe or making napalm out of eggs, milk and sugar, the Worms
were delighted and instructed him to start production immediately.

Unfortunately Thaddeus, being a little short sighted, had confused the word
Napalm with the word Custard. That didn't stop him producing fifteen tonnes 
of the stuff and flooding Wormville. He even produced a huge cherry from
somewhere.

The other Worms couldn't decide whose fault it had been, and decided to
settle things in the only way they knew - bloody combat!

Metal

Another training ground for young Worms, this time to see how well they 
perform on slippy surfaces. This imposing yet friction-free metal edifice
calls for self-control, excellent marksmanship (or markswormship) and a
degree of intestinal fortitude...

Minefield
@{ub}
Oops! A careless Worm stacked to many mines in the store room and then left 
the door open. One of the frequent explosions in Wormville shook the mines 
loose and scattered them all over the town. The Worm in question was quickly
executed by a Worm from an opposing tribe. His own tribe felt it only right 
to retaliate, and war ensued. The only problem was that noone knew which of
the mines were armed...

Dentures

This level is intended to promote good dental hygine and the termination

@node moonbases

Moonbase/Moonbase 2
@{ub}
Humans finally developed the technology to populate the moon. They set 
about building two Moonbases in the Sea of Tranquility, one in a convenient
crater, and one on the site of a mysterious black monolith...

The monolith obviously came under a great deal of study, as scientists
tried to discover what it was, and what purpose it served. However, their
research didn't slow the production of the two Moonbases. Construction was
well under way.

If the scientists had known how, they would have discovered that the
monoltih was, in fact, a warning to stop people populating the moon, because
it was the resting place of a species of giant Worms. These Worms had been
entombed in the moon as they were a war-like race whose battles had 
destroyed many planets. Any construction work could rouse them from their
slumber.

The humans didn't know this, and so were very surprised when the ground
around their moonbases suddenly sprouted giant Worms.

The humans quickly evacuated the moon, leaving the two moonbases as 
playgrounds for the Worms as they began again their centuries-old war...

Space
@{ub}
The Moon-worms had been fighting non-stop for three years. The people of
Earth had at first found this entertaining, and the popular show Moon-worm
Battles had finally knocked Gladiators 2099 off the top of the ratings
charts.

However, any fall-out or near misses on the moon were automatically drawn 
towards the largest nearby centre of gravity - the Earth. Mass destruction
ensued as Worm missiles rained down upon the hapless humans.

Eventually, the people of earth had had enough. They flew a huge space-ship 
to the moon and tempted the Worms aboard using a huge inflatable dummy of
Phil Collins. When all the Worms were aboard they fired the ship off into
space.

Unfortunately, the Worms didn't stop fighting just because they were on a
space-ship - in fact, if anything they became angrier and fought more
violently, causing the ship to veer off course and break down just a few
hundred thousand miles from Mars.

The Worms abandoned the ship and continued the battle in the depths of
space...

Finally, the Moon-worms made it to the planet Mars having hitched a lift off
a passing flying saucer. To their surprise (if, indeed, they had emotions) 
they realised that they'd come across an ancient Martian settlement. This
was a cause for great celebration ie. shooting each other...

Heads
@{ub}
This landscape was built in a distant district of Wormville by Worms angry
at years of being stepped on and pulled apart by small children. The
numerous models of human heads dotted about are there to be destroyed...
especially if there's an opposition Worm on them...
@endnode
@node slippyrock

Slippyrock
@{ub}
It was a bad day in Wormville. A Worm had been sent to fetch a bucket of
oil to lubricate the firing mechanisms on the rocket launchers and had 
spilled the oil all over the place, rendering even rocks as slippy as ice.
So, not only was there a pitched battle, the Worms also had to put up with
their rocket launchers squeaking!
@endnode
node discs
@{b}
Discs
@{ub}
The Worms had run out of blank discs, and so a great meeting was called.

The Worms tribes met in the centre of Wormville, and, after many long 
minutes of discussion, came to the conclusion that if there was a gnome
that stole all the Pencils, there was probably a gnome that stole all of the
blank discs.

They were right, but it was just a coincidence.

And so after the usual cycle of threats, cajoling, more threats, pleas, even 
more threats, and the waving of a huge wand, the Worms found themselves in
a huge place full of blank discs. And so, a huge battle ensued...
@endnode
@node cake
@{b}
Cake
@{ub}
It was the birthday of Mark Hamill Worm. The Worms tribes had worked 
together on a huge chocolate cake, surprising themselves - they weren't
used to cooperating (although a record number of Worms had died deciding
what flavour the cake should be). Mark Hamill Worm was presented the cake, 
which marked the passing of his fourth birthday, and the Worms tribes 
considered that this celebration might actually usher in a new period of
peace and tranquility.

So happy were the Worms that they failed to notice that one of the four 
candles adorning the cake was much larger than the rest. And it was fizzing
alarmingly. And it had TNT written on it.

The TNT exploded, taking Mark Hamill Worm to a Better Place (TM), and 
covering the entire of Wormville in sticky chocolate cake. The great era of
peace and tranquility was forgotten in favour of a new era of war and mass 
destruction, and the Worms found that they were much happier this way. So 
that was alright.
@endnode
@node knights
@{b}
Knights
@{ub}
The Worm Council decided to plant a memorial garden in honour of all the 
Worms who had fallen in combat over the years. Unfortunately, they agreed
to let Thaddeus P. Worm add a serum to the gladioli seeds to promote rapid 
growth. Instead of gladioli, the Worms found Knights in shining armour
sprouting up all over the place. There was only one thing to do about this
problem - have a great big barney!
@endnode
@node flat
@{b}
Flat
@{ub}
A further training ground for young Worms. All the Worms are on one level
which isn't too wide. There's no scenery to hide behind. Total destruction
is often the result of a training session here!

@node signs
@{b}
Signs
@{ub}
The Worms Tribes were off on their annual holiday to blow each other up in 
Bognor Regis. Unfortunately, they should have taken a left at Alberquerque,
and instead ended up in Lime Regis. Obviously this wouldn't do, and so, 
after the total obliteration of the Worm tribe who was looking after the 
map, the Worms preceded to the local information office.

The people working in the information office were not too pleased to be 
confronted by a large group of unhappy, gun-toting Worms, and it looked as 
though the information office would be blown off the face of the planet,
but then one bright young desk clerk had the brainwave of tempting all of 
the Worms into the back yard where they stored all of the old signs. The
Worms became lost amongst the signs, and so, to ease their frustration, they
decided to kill each other...

These are just a few things that some of you may not know about Worms. I'm 
pretty sure that most of you will know these things anyway, but you never
know, so I've included them anyway.

@{b}
Secret Sheep Mode!
@{ub}
To enter the Sheep mode, type "TOTAL WORMAGE" while on the title screen.
The screen will change colour, and the game will announce that you've 
entered Sheep Mode. You now have access to all of the special weapons (such
as Sheep, Banana Bombs and the Minigun) and you can alter how many you get 
on the appropriate options screen.
@endnode
@node prod
@{b}
Secret Prod Move
@{ub}
To activate the secret Prod move, stand your worm next to an opposing worm
and, using the cursor keys, press away, away, towards, towards. This will 
cause your worm to push the enemy. If you're at the top of a slope on an icy 
landscape this move can be very useful!
@endnode
@node custom
@{b}
Altering Custom Level Attributes
@{ub}
If you've created a custom level, you'll know you have to save it as

 Levelname.WRM

However, you can change the gravity and friction, and the colour of the sea,
on any level by saving it as

 Levelname.abxy.WRM

Replace a and b with a number from 1 to 5. The letter a represents gravity,
and b represents friction. Therefore, a level saved as

 Levelname.15xy.WRM 

would have low gravity and high friction.

The letters x and y should also be replaced by numbers from 1 to 5, and 
control the colour of the sea. Experiment with these to get results you like!

@node comments
@{b}
Creating Level Comments
@{ub}
When you play a regular game of worms, don't you find those random comments
the computer throws up before each level starts hilarious? And don't you just 
wish that you could do them too? Well, now you can!

While in Workbench, insert your level disk. The art program you use to 
create the levels should have saved them with an icon. Click on this once
and then select Information or Info from the pull-down menus.

When the information screen has loaded, simply write your message in the 
Comments box. Your message should be no longer than 40 characters long.
Then, just save the information and everything will work. The next time you
load your custom level in worms your witty message will appear!
