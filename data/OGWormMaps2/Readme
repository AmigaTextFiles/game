Olde Castle
===========
Here's my third map for worms.
For a challenge use only shotgun and grenades and turn everything else off
including blowlamp and teleport.
If you like this map then let me know - I may make some more.
Do not change the 4 numbers in the name as they define the
gravity/friction settings etc.
