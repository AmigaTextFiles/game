This is my second Megazeux game.  It took almost seven months to make.

Before playing, make sure the game is in its own subdirectory, because
it comes with a lot of files.  If you download the sound, it should also
be put in the same subdirectory as the game.

To begin playing, run Megazeux and go into the game's subdirectory.
Load any of the four worlds and press [P] key to play.  All the controls
are explained in the game.

My email address is nytar@hotmail.com.  I hope you enjoy this game.

NOTE: This game contains animated blood, violence, and coarse language.
