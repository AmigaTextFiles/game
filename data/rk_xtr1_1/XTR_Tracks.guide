    Introduction

    These are my first tracks ever.  As such anyone who feels they can contribute 
with ideas can feel free, my mates email address is @{"here." LINK "Author" 0}  
However anyone ripping these tracks of can die a thousand nasty deaths involving 
mad rabbits, big teeth and baboons.  Or quite clearly something.

    @{b}Special thanks and credit is given to David J. Cruickshank, without whom 
track RK 4 would not be possible.  I have included both the .256 and the .chk 
versions of his Scalextrix tile set.  I don't know if they are freely distributable or not, I 
lost the docs to them.  If they aren't if some one will @{"Email" LINK "Author" 0} 
me I will remove them, and add where they can be found to the docs.@{ub}

    Easy this.  

    Method ONE:- Use my Amiga DOS script which should work.

    Method TWO:-  Do it the hard way, and copy the contents of each drawer to 
                  the same drawer on your hard drive.

    Floppy users will have to figure it out for themselves.  Sorry.  Really.

@NODE "secret route" "secret route"

These are the secret routes.

On RK 1 just after the start finish line, on the right there are three trees.  The middle 
one can be driven through.  When past just watch the walls on the left and the ice on 
the right.

On RK 3 about half way round the circuit it goes like this.  (Approach right to left)
                                                                                
                                                {--}   
                                               |    |  
               ------------------------------- |    |------------------------  

i.e. you approach from right to left horizontally, then turn right (UP), the
left (DOWN) then continue horizontally.  The reason you turn right is because
the water blocks your path.  To drive over the water aim the car just to the
right of the on coming tree.

For RK 3 it should make sense honest, if you have driven the track anyway.

    Through this link you may discover secret things about me, this will
ultimately result in a Men In Black type mind scrubbing at some point in the
future.

                            @{b}Continue at your peril@{ub}

    Right then continuing well lets go,

    I am 17 studying 3 really crappy 'A' levels (Psychology, English and Economics) 
and have developed a rather fanatical following of music.  Certain faves being THE 
WILDHEARTS, RADIOHEAD, THE MANICS, THE STONE ROSES, BELLY AND TANYA 
DONNERLY.  I also have a liking for my miggy and XTR, my miggy is as follows:-

    1200 Tower
    Blizzard 1240 + 8 Meg Fast
    A squirrel + Syquest and CD-ROM
    An extra floppy
    And a shit hot second hand multi-sync monitor.
    Much software.

Unfortunately I have no modem, yet my *ee*ee owning mate has agreed to let me 
abuse his, so his Email address is DROVIER@DIAL.PIPEX.COM

    He is interested in MARILYN MANSON, SMASHING PUMPKINS, MUDHONEY, THE
DEFTONES etc.  He also likes that Quake game, and any psychedelic and strange
stuff, he just wants to receive some Email.  Nice not nasty.

    @{b}Jackson Pollock, he's damn good too.@{ub}

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Problems" "Problems"

    Right then something must have gone wrong.  Firstly check that all the 
necessary files are in the correct drawers.  Second if you haven't got the data disk 
then you cannot read the CrunchMania packed track + data files.  To overcome this 
use a utility such as XFD, bound to be on the Aminet + Magazine CD-ROMs.

    If anything else goes wrong then I haven't got a clue, unless I forgot to upload 
something.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Thanks" "Thanks"

  In this section anyone who helps me with something, or indeed just gets in
contact with me will get a mention.

  @{b}Dirk Neubauer@{ub} email: neubauer@rz.uni-greifswald.de
       Dirk has been helpful with the season file.  Infact his is now
       included.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "Legal" "Legal"

    Right then for copying and altering see the individual track descriptions.

    Other than that if you use these tracks please send my mate some Email, and 
me a postcard.  One without the other is VERY NAUGHTY and is punished with 
slapped wrists.

    And if you computer blows up, fucks up, has a nervous break down, or any 
other detrimental thing occurs its not my fault, so there.

@ENDNODE
@NODE "News" "News"

  All thats new is that track RK 3 has been finished.  Well unless someone
has a darn good idea, that is.

@{b}RK 3@{ub}
  What I have done is add more grass, make the grass into FASTER GRASS.
I have also altered the edges of the track.  It is more uneven, and I think
better for this.  (By uneven I mean that all the edges of the sand are no
longer just straight like a racing circuit, now more like a beach.)
