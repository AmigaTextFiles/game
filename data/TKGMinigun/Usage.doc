Minigun for TKG by Jason Frecknall 1997

The default state animation should be:

VF: ??	FN: 1	AO:??	VO:-10	NF: 0

The active/destroyed animation should be:

VF: ??	FN: 2	AO: 0	VO: 0	NF: 4
VF: ??	FN: 2	AO: 0	VO: 0	NF: 2
VF: ??	FN: 3	AO: 0	VO: 0	NF: 3
VF: ??	FN: 4	AO: 0	VO: 0	NF: 4
VF: ??	FN: 5	AO: 0	VO: 0	NF: 4

Replace ?? with appropriate values.

Notes:

If the frame rate is too low the gun won't animate properly - it doesn't get
a chance to play through it's animation sequence.
Feel free to use this how you want, but I would appreciate a mail telling
me where I can find your level with it in.
