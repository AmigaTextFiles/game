Formula One Grand Prix Backdrops
--------------------------------

These pictures are 320 x 200, 32 colour IFF pictures. They are
pictures to replace some of the existing backdrop files in "Formula
One Grand Prix". To use them you must have a copy of F1GP-Ed v3.30+ by
Oliver Roberts.

The original pictures were, of course, the track pictures which came
with the game. All I have done is remove the small flag on the
originals and replace them with a larger version in the background.
This has then been 'dulled' so that the picture of the circuit stands
out in the centre.

You may distribute these file as you wish as long as you include this
readme.
