--------------------

Once, long ago, before humans existed (and before dinosaurs), there lived a
race of worms. Every 500 years, special worms were picked to fight the evil
`SHADOW WORMS' (which look just like the ordinary worms, but were thick so 
they thought they were -see- throught except for there shadows, which only 
they thought they saw).

Anyway......

Rang Whang, a wormshifter was banished from the OuterWorm to the Earth for his 
Crap jokes and Crap Wohn Major Impressions. There with the aid of his pupil 
Woro, a hideous half-worm comedian, he cleverly hosted a tournament every 500 
years, so he could over throw each relm and lead this master Whao Rahn to 
enter the relm and rule forever.

For this to happen the Rang Whang has to win 10 battles within each relm.

Rang Whangs soldiers named SHADOW WORMS are ready and waiting....


                              A R E  Y O U ?

You're special worms would have to fight through 7 different stages to win
and to stop the evil Whao Rahn from taking over the last relm....

                                E A R T H?

                       These stages are as followed:

                                  BASES
                                 BEDROOM
                                 CIRLCES
                                  HEROS
                                HI BUBBLES
                                  MIGHT1
                MIGHT2 or MIGHT3 if you have over 2.2 Megs

They have one relm left to take over..... Are you going to let them?
