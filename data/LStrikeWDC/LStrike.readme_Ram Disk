Type: game/data
Requires: Worms-DC, fun in playing WDC & Amiga ;-)

Shouts out to all these peolpe who bought this incredible cool game even though there
are only 5000 people to buy it. What a f***ing worse number :,-(
But AndyDavidson will not stop to work on his masterpiece :-))))

Some lines to this level:
I was always searching on aminet for new DIYs as I can`t have enough. And now I want to
draw my own one.
While sitting infront of my dear AMIGA, waiting for some good ideas I smoked nearly a
half package of Luckies and I thought... why not! Let`s make a kewl LuckyStrike-Level.

And here it is. I hope you enjoy it.
First I wanted to make this "You-have-to-send-me-a-box-of-LuckyStrike-Ware" but I guess
noone gonne send my some ziggs. so i changed it to the amazing:
         "You-must-have-fun-with-it-and-please-spread-it-Ware"
I hope it`s better ;-)

and now...FORGET THIS STUPID CRAP AND HAVE LOTS OF FUN WITH LStrike.DIY
