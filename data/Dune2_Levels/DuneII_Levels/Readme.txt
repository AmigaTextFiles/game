   SAVED GAME FILES FOR DUNE 2
   ---------------------------

   This archive contains savegame files for the three houses of the planet Arrakis.

   USAGE:

   Copy the contents of the drawer of your choice (eg.HARKONNENLEVELS) to the DUNE2 drawer.
   NOT the drawer itself !.

   Rename the save files (e.g. _SAVE000.DAThar4 as _SAVE000.DAT and so on).
   Before doing this you'll have to rename or delete all your existing save files.

   Launch the game and load the level you will play.

   If you will play another house you'll need to delete the existing save files and repeat
   the procedure of copying and renaming files from the drawer of the house you will play.

   This archive does not include the first two or three levels of the houses for they are
   so simple.

   Mind you,there are two or three different regions to start with at each level.You can try
   these by choosing a different area after you have completed a level.

   Enjoy !
