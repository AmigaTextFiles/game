MZX Racing is a simple game really. You direct your car, hit people, 
and try to place first in the race. Each race is 10 laps. In each race 
the amount of people you need to hit increases. If you run into tires, 
rocks, or other cars you will explode and restart the lap you were on. 
This also applies to the other cars as well. Have Fun Racing!

Also there is a secret somewhere in this game. Unless you cheat, it 
shouldn't be easy to find. Good luck!
