DESCRIPTION:
	Small utility to enable a WORMS player to select their sample set
	from 2 or more sets on their hard drive.


REQUIREMENTS:

	Hard Drive
	Magic Workbench Palette (for nice colour GUI)
	`Worms' Installed On HD (durr)
	Some alternative WORMS sample sets (via Aminet, cover CD's etc)
	`ReqTools.library' By Nico François
	
	Only tested on A1200 2Mb+4Mb.


USAGE:

	Drag the icon "WRM_Selector" into the installed WORMS directory
	on your hard drive.  Name the sample directories as follows:
	
		TWENGLISH
		TWENGLISH2
		TWENGLISH3 (optional)
		TWENGLISH4 (optional)
	
	You MUST have at least one other TWENGLISH directory ("TWENGLISH2")
	in order to use the selector.  You may only select from four
	different sets due to space limitation in the GUI!
	
	If you have not set up the directories correctly then a requester
	will pop up. NB: you must already have Reqtools.library installed!
	
	When you want to play WORMS click on the "WRM_Selector" program to
	choose your sample set.  Then click on the button marked 'Select'
	to confirm and exit.  Now start WORMS as normal using it's own icon.
	
	Your selected choice will remain until you select another sample
	set, even after a reset/power off etc.


FUTURE:

	As long as WORMS AGA doesn't have different directory names this
	util will work with it.  I can't see any `must have' improvments
	and there's no bugs from what I can see as it's soooo simple.
	
	Possible update would be to support more than 4 sets of samples but
	who is going to have so many sample sets wasting HD space??
	
	Foreign WORMS players who use the French or German speech sets will
	have to rename their directories to TWENGLISH to use this proggy.
	If enough foreign users write and request a generic language
	version I'll throw one together; but until then its ENGLISH only!
