Well, lets try this again...

This will be my second attempt at uploading this to the aminet.  I think that my 
first attempt (because it was just the "Ships" level) did not take because there
already was a file called "Ships.lha".  This was also my first attempt to upload
anything...  Hope I've learned my lesson.

Now on to the fun!

All these levels (present and future) started out as levels for the original Worms.
When the TDC came out, I decided that I could "fine tune" them further.  My
complaint since day one has been that many of the custom levels out there were or
were not of good detail, but lacked PLAYABILITY!  I had also thought of a few ideas
that would make some interesting levels. So to work I went.  The following are
three levels that I have converted and improved.  They have also been HEAVILY
playtested by a few friends and myself.

CLOUDS:		The third level I had created, this was done on a whim.  I had
			gotten the idea of making a level based on "Joust".  If you do
			not know what I'm talking about, you're too young! (Or am I too
			old?)  This came from dealing with the idea of little or no land
			with the "Ships" level.  Basically, this is a level of chance and
			maybe some extreme skill.  On a sick note, the record kill with one
			shot has been 7 kills.  (with 4 teams at once, of course)  If you
			achieve or witness more than this, email me about it.  If you need
			a fast game, this is the one to play!

SHIPS:		The first level I made and my friends tell me it's the best.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>TRY NOT TO VIEW THIS LEVEL BEFORE YOU PLAY IT !!!<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
			-------------------------------------------------
			Level Details:
						Fake Worms
						Fake Mines ( these are why! )
						Fake Weapon Crates

			Do try to not take the uncertainty out of the fake mines by viewing
			the level beforehand.  This level is definitely anti darkside and
			pro strategy.  There is nowhere to hide in this level.  I also give
			warning about the rope...  Don't stay on it for very long.  Use the
			portholes to fire from ship to ship.  Try at all costs to get a
			Nuclear Bomb from a weapons crate.  "Captain, the ship is sinking !"
			The water will totally engulf the lower levels of the ships.

ZOMBIES:		The only level to be in "DIY" and custom format.  Also the second
(ZOMBIE)		custom level I had made.  I must admit that this was originally very
			rushed.  Also, this level used to be called Graveyard on the
			original version of the game, but you can guess why it had to be
			changed.  With the release of TDC, this level was severely
			overhauled.  Fake Worms abound again, but with a few changes.
			Fair Warning !!!  This level is a little on the sick side, as I pay
			tribute to MonsterVision on TNT cable.  I admit I watch for the
			strange commentary of the movies.  Darkside play is possible, but not
			for very long.  Just let loose some cows... Get the picture...

Well, thats all for now...

If you have any comments about my work, please email me !  I use my Amiga at work,
creating a web page (of all things) for the company.  So I check my email almost
daily.  If I receive much response, I will divert some time to work on more levels.
There is one more that I have my mind on, but I will leave you hanging as to what it
is.  As for distribution, these levels are freeware.  Do with them as you see fit,
except if you redistribute them in any form, please give me credit.  This also
includes CDROMS and magazine cover disks.

P.S.  You have to download these DIY levels, I thought they were great!
