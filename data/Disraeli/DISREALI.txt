                          Seven levels in Realm of Chaos megawad for Doom2

*Description*
Large techno-gothic level with detailed architecture and many secrets.
Designed for a stiff challenge on UV.  Certain areas show the influence
of the great OSIRIS.wad by Glenn Payne and Marshall Bostwick, as well
as the outstanding levels of Michael Krause (IPRAY4U, DOTHEJOB,
GOTHEWAY, etc.)

*Construction*
Base...................New Level From Scratch
Build Time.............Way Long
Editors Used...........Hellmaker v1.2b2 by Paul Davidson
                       Deimos 0.4.1b by Mikado
Known Bugs.............Secret count at the end will not exceed 91%, even
                       if you find them all.  I guess there's too many
                       secrets for an accurate count. :-)

*Testing info*
This level has been extensively tested on the following systems:
PowerMac with PPC 604 @132Mhz, 48MB RAM + PowerMac 7100 with PPC 601 @80Mhz
Amiga A4000T with 68060 @57Mhz, 18MB RAM, using ADoom 1.3 and DoomAttack 0.8beta3
and Pentium2 400 PC and Pentium 120 PC.

This level, despite its size, ran smoothly on all systems, although there were a few
hiccups on the Amiga.  A version of this level with reject map built by
the Mac version of W.A.R.M. by Robert Fenske Jr. (port by Paul Davidson) tended to
run slower on all machines than levels compiled solely with Hellmaker's node-builder,
and as a result was replaced with this version.
