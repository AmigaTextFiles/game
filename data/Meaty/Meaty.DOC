Welcome to the official documentation for Meaty.DIY.


Copyright blurb.

	It's mine, but you can have a copy if you want. Just don't go claiming you
drew it though, because that would be really naughty.


General info.

	This is a new meat-themed landscape type for Worms - Directors Cut.
	
Technical mumbo jumbo.
 
	To install simply copy the extracted file (MEATY.DIY) to your TWDIY
	drawer. 
	

Related stuff and nonsense.

Look out for:-
	My first Worms DC landscape - Vegetable.diy. It's got vegetables in it (and
it's actually better drawn than this one, to be honest.)

	My future landscapes - I'll probably be drawing a few more of these things
so keep an eye out. Email me with suggestions if you want, that's how this one
came about (a long, dull sunday afternoon, a lack of inspiration and an
unexpected email). I think my next level will be another food-based one. Although
my first two levels are food-themed I haven't actually drawn anything from the
two most important food groups - beer and cakes. I think cakes might be next. 


Any other bobbins.

	Email me with praise, comments, suggestions or insults. I like Email. It
makes me feel popular. You could always visit my website too (assuming you
haven't been there already) Go on, treat yourself - www.markspace.u-net.com


	Enjoy.
