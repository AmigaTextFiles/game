CONTENTS

 This archive contains 10 replacement cockpit designs to be used in F1GP.
 Each design consists of an IFF-ILBM image file (.ilbm) and a F1GP-Ed
 graphic settings file (.settings).  Note that the settings files don't
 have icons, so remember to copy them if you copy the designs to another
 location - they are important!


HOW TO USE THE DESIGNS

 You will need a *registered* copy of F1GP-Ed (at least v3.10) to use
 these designs in F1GP.  Basically, you just need to go to the graphics
 window in F1GP-Ed, load a .settings file and then click the save to
 binary button.  Note that you may need to alter the path to the image
 (.ilbm) file using the "Image" gadget - you won't need to do this with
 F1GP-Ed 3.30 (currently in development).  If you are using a version
 3.1x you will need to convert the .ilbm file to raw format before
 F1GP-Ed can use it :-(

 For full instructions, please refer to the F1GP-Ed documentation.
