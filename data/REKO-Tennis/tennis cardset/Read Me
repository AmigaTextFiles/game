		Tennis cardset for Reko's Klondike AGA
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	This is yet another cardset for Klondike AGA in HAM8. It took me
time, but I think it was worth it. The program I used are:

. Collector	(to have a good representation of the pictures chosen)
. ImageFX	(to scale and crop the pictures)
. TrueBrillance	(to add club, diamond, heart, spade to the cards)
. ImageFX	(to put all cards together and create a unique HAM8 palette)
. DeluxePaint V (to slightly change the palette as described in the docs)
. ADPro		(to render all single cards with the final palette)

Pffff.... very boring work... but nice result.

It was all done on my Amiga:

Amiga 1200
68030-33MHz, 68882-40MHz
8Mb of Fast Ram
Squirrel SCSI interface.
1.7Gb IDE Hard Disk
SCSI CDRom 2x
