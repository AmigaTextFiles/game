  Released : 21/8/96 Uploaded : 24/8/96

-----------------------------------------

Introduction
------------

Thank you for downloading 3Worm, i am greateful that you have spent your
time and money getting this file, i hope you like it and will use the maps
often.

ABC.wrm
-------

ABC.wrm was just made up when i got bored of making levels and just did
a to v and then a to v and thought there you go a worms map so i hope you
have fun with it.

Lines.wrm
---------

Lines.wrm is sort of like a lemmings level so if you fall thourgh one line
you will be saved by the next one and so on until you come to the last one
and you will fall into the water.

Rocky.wrm
---------

Rocky.wrm is my favourite worms level that i have made and it took me the 
longest to do as it is the best, if you blast your way in the mountain then 
climb up the root you can be safe in the little room, for the worms fun i 
have put a table and light in there.

Order
-----

conection for 2 people with modems to connect and chat, Backchat a nice
little program that you can give abuse to and it'll reply back to you and
