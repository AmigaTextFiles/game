HARDDISK Installation ReadMe.

To run the HD-Install-Script, you need the following commands in YOUR "Sys:C" 
directory:

RequestChoice
RequestFile
Echo
Wait
Endcli
cd

But don´t be afraid. To play Xtreme Racing, you need at least a A1200. And if you
have a Amiga A1200, you have Workbench 3.x installed, and all the commands above 
are installed with the Workbench 3.x

Sorry for my poor english.
