Welcome to the official documentation for VEGETABLE.DIY.

Copyright info.

	This landscape was drawn by me. It's mine, all mine - and you can't have
it. Delete it now, you thief.

	Just kidding.

	Or was I?

	Yes.

	I was.

	Take it, copy it, give it to your friends, keep twelve copies on your hard
drive or print a hex dump of it on a T-Shirt for all I care. Despite what a lot
of my friends think I do have better things to worry about than the legal issues
arising from a set of pictures of vegetables.

	Honest.


Things you should know:

	This is a new vegetable-themed landscape type for Worms - Directors Cut.
	
	To install simply copy the extracted file (VEGETABLE.DIY) to your TWDIY
	drawer. 
	

Things you should do: 
	Marvel at the strikingly realistic vegetables portrayed within.

	Find solace in the fact that the carrot you've just been blown up on was
organically drawn.

	Question the sanity of someone who, with a free choice of subject matter,
decides to draw sprouts!

	Name a worm "Slippery", so that you can crack amusing jokes when the
computer prompts you to "Get 'em slippery!".	

	Enjoy.
