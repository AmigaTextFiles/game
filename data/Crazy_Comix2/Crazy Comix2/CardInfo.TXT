; Here's a new card set for MarryamPic iv'e called it Crazy Comix 2 
; look out for Crazy Comix and Flags of the world. 
; We still have a few other differant ideas so look out for them.
; There are hundreds of cards to be made, your football or soccer teams for example
; sport, basket ball, netball, golf, boxing,
; Give it a go all you need is a picture and a sound
; Install just put Crazy Comix 2 into the card drawer and don't delete this text
; because it ain't gonna work.
; Like to get some feedback on this as to see if it's worth doing a lot more
; this is the only part I hate doc's so no comments on this OK.
;
;   PS If you like a program it don't hurt to drop a line to the main man who 
; spent his RR behind the computer so as I said say hi and thanks (it means
; a lot). If time is money then concider using the macro keys before log on to 
; write your mail this only takes seconds.
; Wendy (the other half) helped with the sound files this time we enjoyed it?
