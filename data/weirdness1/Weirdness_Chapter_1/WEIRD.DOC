*** Chapter I
*** By Software Visions


I. INTRODUCTION

        Weirdness is a MegaZeux game module- You must have MegaZeux (also
        by Software Visions) to run it. MegaZeux is an EGA/SB game creation
		  system with its own programming language and endless possibilities.

		  Weirdness is a new innovation in MegaZeux programming- Each chapter
		  will contain different types of gameplay, such as Puzzles, SideView,
		  and 3D Dungeons, all in one game. A strange story, cool cinemas, and
		  an overall weirdness tie the series together.

II. HOW TO PLAY

		  Load Weirdness up into MegaZeux (press 'L' from the title screen) and
		  watch the title screen, then press 'P' to play. Full instructions
		  will be given where they are different from regular screens. Usually,
		  arrow keys will move, Space will fire any available weapons, Enter
		  will show your current status, and 'I' will access the inventory
		  menu. 'H' can often be used for help on the current gameplay
		  mechanism.

III. CHAPTERS

		  Weirdness is divided into ten unique chapters. The first FIVE
		  chapters are available to the general public as shareware. The
		  second five, including the extended final chapter, are only
		  available through registration with Software Visions. Look for
		  the different chapters on AOL and the internet, as they are
		  released. All chapters will be available via FTP at:

		  users.aol.com/gjanson  *or*
		  users.aol.com/SVWeird

		  Chapters will also be available via WWW. Go to our home page at:

IV. REGISTRATION

		  WEIRDNESS IS NOT YET COMPLETE. Do not mail any registrations in
		  yet. I have not decided whether it will be shareware or freeware-
		  Information will be available by chapter 5. (The breakpoint IF
		  it is shareware.)

V. UPDATES
