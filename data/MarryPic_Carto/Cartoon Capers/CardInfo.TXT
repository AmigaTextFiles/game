; Here's a new card set for MarryemPic iv'e called it Cartoon Capers  
; look out for Alfa Beta 1 and 2 coming soon I thought I will do a simple
; one for the younger set of ankle biters. But it's not to be it's Hard 
; We still have a few other differant ideas so look out for them.
; There are hundreds cards to be made your football or soccer teams for example
; sport, basket ball, netball, golf, boxing, your girlfrends if you must only you 
;  will know who's who though (if your that lucky to have had 10 girls)
; Give it a go all you need is a picture and a sound
; Install just put Cartoon Capers into the card drawer and dont delete this text
; because it an't gona go.
; Like to get some feedback on this as to see if it's worth doing a lot more
; this is the only part i hate doc's so no comments on this OK.

;   PS If you like a program it don't hurt to drop a line to the main man who 
; spent his RR behind the computer so as i said say hi and thanks (it means
; a lot). If time is money then concider using the macro keys before log on to 
; write your mail this only takes seconds.
