Description             : Small deathmatch map, designed for 2-7 players. Frib designed the map, 
                          laid down the brushes, and placed the items. I (De Venator) took it 
                          from there.. completely retextured it, added the light, did a few general 
                          alterations, added clip brushes, and handled the playtesting. You could 
                          try playing duel on it but i dunno how it will go...its meant mainly to 
                          be just a small fun dm map. The original plan was to release the 3 
                          different textured vers and ppl could just rename the map and use 
                          whatever vers they wanted, no matter what vers the server was running. 
                          The new QW v2.2 has killed that idea though :(..so umm play it on lan ..
                          be the server op and choose what ver you want :). Of course you could 
                          still use whatever vers you like if you are playin on a normal quake 
                          server or ver QW 2.1 server
