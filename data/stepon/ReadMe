      XTreme Racing 'Step On' track Read Me file.
      ===========================================

Thank you for your decision to download, copy or otherwise procure 
the XTreme Racing Step On track.  This track is the first that the '25 Hr. 
Party People' (that's Louis Harber and I, to more sensible folk) have 
designed.  It has some interesting and original features, including road-
works and the patented '25 HPP super-jump'.  Some of these features 
might frighten the unsuspecting driver, we heartily recommend taking it 
easy on your first go, follow the computer cars - they've had more prac-
tice at it?

TRACK TYPE:    Race

TILE SET:      Island / CU / Custom

INSTRUCTIONS (for the inexperienced, unintuitive, or scared): 

Having extracted the StepOn.lha to RAM (I hope).  Copy all of the .obj 
extension files from RAM:objects to your XTR/Objects drawer i.e. type:

copy all from Ram:objects to Work:Games/XTR/Objects

at a shell prompt (replacing 'work:games/XTR' with the path of your 
XTR drawer).  Repeat this procedure to copy all tile files to 
your XTR/Tiles drawer (you may already have the CU files, 
in which case don't bother copying them).  Then copy the 'Step_On.trk' 
file from RAM:tracks to your XTR/tracks directory.

Run XTReme Racing select the Step On track and prepare for the 
race of your. . . well just prepare to race.
