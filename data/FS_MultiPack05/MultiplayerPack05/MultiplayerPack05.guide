@{b}Clash of the Titans@{PLAIN}
This mission features 4 capital ships
and many fighters at 1 time. This mission
supports 1-12 players (to play single
player, just play mutliplayer and start
by yourself).
I am probably not going to continue
making this mission (but it is almost
finished) because I was dissappointed
with the speeds I was getting (600-900
with 3 players).

@{b}Defend Sirus Station@{PLAIN}
This is still in the beta stages. Your main
goal is to destroy a enemy typhoon
destroyer. After you kill it don't feel
held back to beef up your kill count!
If you really want to have some fun
stick around for over 5 minutes for
REAL fun.
