The Lucifer has been tracked down
and is in a weakened state. Her engines
have somehow destroyed themselves, the

Harbingers into the enemy base. The first team
to score wins... the loser watches his base explode.

@{b}Fourman Subspace@{PLAIN}
This Mission takes place in Sub-Space.. Yes! That's
right, you heard me. Sub-Space! It can get pretty
dizzing at times, but you'll get use to it. But just in
case, keep a bucket near by. Note: There are NO
shields in Subspace and NO repair ships.
