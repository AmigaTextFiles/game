The files in this folder are designed to be used as Skin-Images.

In order to use these new images simply copy the encluded directory to the
directory called "gfx" located in your ArTKanoid installation. Use the InGame
menu as usual to switch between different skins as usual. Have Fun. :)

More information can be found in the ReadMe file in the parent directory.
