Welcome to the official documentation for NewCindy.WRM16.

General info.

	This is a new(ish) custom level for Worms - Directors Cut.

	This level is based upon a level drawn by Relative Matey (who I tried to
contact to ask permission to release this - honest!) The Cindy Crawford front
layer was all his/her work - I just added the background layer. The moment I saw
the original level I saw how the background layer of Directors Cut could be
used to wondrous effect. I think the end result is fairly special.
	
Technical mumbo jumbo.
 
	To install simply copy the extracted file (NewCindy.WRM16) to your TWCUSTOM
	drawer. 
	

Related stuff and nonsense.

Look out for:-
	My Worms DC custom landscapes - Vegetable.diy and Meaty.DIY.

Unrelated stuff and nonsense.

Look out for my two games - Pookah and SPS. I released them, and they quickly
returned to the wild. They're both on Aminet somewhere, but I'd prefer if you
got them from my website (coz my hit counter is kinda pathetic (- I think I can
account for every hit from people I know!)) The address is www.markspace.u-net.com

Stuff you can do:-
	Email me with praise, comments, suggestions or insults. I like Email. It
makes me feel popular. You could always visit my website too (assuming you
haven't been there already) Go on, treat yourself - www.markspace.u-net.com


	Enjoy.
