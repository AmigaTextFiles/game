Adamantine Veil (v1.0)

Jon "Zorach" Niehof, jniehof@yifan.net

After the appearance of the Lucifer, the GTA attempts to develop a
 cap-ship shield to facilitate a counterstrike against the Shivan
 offensive.

Thanks for trying this mission! Please send me any comments--I
can't make better missions without feedback :) If there are any
problems major enough to necessitate an update, it will be
available at the Descent Chronicles.
