HELP
~~~~
 This level is on some girders, you will have no problems falling into the 
sea because there are no gaps to fall in - Yet!! Watch out for fake Mines 
and Worms, admire the guns.

BRIDGE
~~~~~~
 This level is great. It is full of girders and a nice grinder!! If you 
falldown, however you (may) be saved by little rocks in the water. Watch 
out for trick floors and walls in the sky!?

TUNNEL
~~~~~~
 As the name suggeses this level is in a tunnel which is in the middle of a
war, grave yards and guns are in this level, not to mention little tunnels 
and girders build to block the enemy. Watch out for fake worms, mines and 
grave stones!! And theres no use using Air Strikes here!

INVIS
~~~~~
 They thought it could never be done, but we have, an invisable Worms 
Level with a few platforms and a few more holes, watch out with your 
weapons, they may hit the floor!

STACK
~~~~~
  Raised platforms supported by green poles! Look out for fake Worms, but 
they are not hard to spot, watch the fake mines and weapon drops, and blow 
up your friends.

TEMPLATE
~~~~~~~~
 Ideal for thoses people who are sick of my levels and wan`t to make their 
own, a template is what they need, load it into DPaint and follow the 
in-vision instructions. Or, load it up in Worms and you get a quite 
playable level, but not much in graphics, a few letters and curved lines.
