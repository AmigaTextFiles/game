A couple of items of information:

I could not find the fastest race times, so I used the fastest practice times
of each driver that were acheived days before the actual race (i.e. Thursday
for Miami and Friday for Japan)

Car #34 was driven by Denis Vitolo at Miami and driven by Gualter Salles in 
Japan, hence the two names in the same space in the driver editor.

Since some CART races are driven on ovals, (these first two races at Miami
and Japan were) the times achieved may make the horsepower and/or speed of
the computer cars artificially fast or slow. (Judging by the HP in the team
editor, they will be way too slow.)

Some of the drivers have a number in parenthesis after the name (i.e. 
P.J. Jones (98)). This is because the number in parenthesis is the number
of the car the person drives, and F1GP-Ed only goes up to 40.
