@node GW_ABOUT "About GreenWoods"

GreenWoods is a set of new (well quite old now, actually) tracks & graphics for XTreme Racing. Also included are a few RockyRoad tracks, which use the same tile set as GreenWoods, but are quite unusual all the same. 

I should confess that RockyRoads was more than a little inspired by the rock-lined tracks in Crazy Cars III.


@endnode


@node GW_REQUIREMENTS "GreenWoods Requirements"

Requires XTreme Racing (obviously). Should work with all versions of XTR, but I recommend V2.00 (the XTR Data Disk update).

Note: If playing from floppy make sure the GreenWoods disk is called XTRx - where x is a number greater than 4 (i.e. XTR9).

@node GW_INSTALLATION "Installing GreenWoods"

Once again I haven't gotten round to writing an install script (infact I'm NEVER going to write one - I looked at some documentation for the installer tool for five minutes and had a headache), but if you can install a WORMS level, you won't have any problem following this. (It just involves more directories).

Copy the contents of every drawer in this set to their corresponding directories in your XTR drawer.

i.e. Drag all the files from ThisDisk:Tiles to DH1:XTR/Tiles, Etc.
(Use "Window/Show/All Files" to see the directories in your XTR drawer from Workbench.)

IMPORTANT: Some files have been updated since the last release. If you have already installed a previous release of GreenWoods, you still need to re-install all the files from this set.

I have also included my "laptimes" file. DO NOT COPY IT OVER YOUR OWN - instead use the "BestLaps" utility to merge it with your file (and then only save it if you're happy seeing other peoples scores obliterate your own). I've already merged it with a couple of others I've come across - which is why almost none of the initials are mine.

Original Track,         : -
Author, Location          

Graphics Set Required   : GreenWoods Tracks 1 - 7
                          & Woodland Warrior 1 - 3:

                                            DARKSTONE 1 & 2   [solids]
                                            Green 1 - 5       [flats]

                          GreenWoods Tracks 8 & 9:

                                            CASTLEBASE        [solids]
                                            ROCKBASE          [solids]
                                            Green 1 - 4       [flats]

                          Rocky Road 1 & 2
                          & Devils Box:

                                            ROCKBASE          [solids]
                                            Green 2, 4        [flats]

Any Extra included Gfx  : GTree1, GTree2, Mushroom, Toadstool1, Brain, 
                          Braindeath, Killerbat & Mudmonster Objects.
                          GreenWoods Background, World and Layouts. 

Description             : Woodland based tracks, lots of trees and brain
                          exposing aliens (to splat). Exploding Bats have
                          now been added (thanks to David Cruikshank for
                          suggesting that), together with a number of other
                          new objects to make the later levels more
                          interesting.
                            Rocky Road uses the same tiles as GreenWoods,
                          but doesn't include any trees - instead the road
                          is lined with rocks, hence the name.

Difficulty Comments     : Green Woods 1 is pretty easy; 2 and 4 are more
                          challenging. Rocky Road 1 is easy enough to get
                          round, but make a couple of mistakes and the
                          computer cars will get miles ahead.

Best Known Lap Time     : Green Woods 1    00.27.04    DJH
                          Green Woods 2    00.34.68    DJC
