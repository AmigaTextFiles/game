@node Introduction "Introduction to the worm maps"
@{b}Introduction:@{ub}

    Well, it made once for fun a custom level for Worms, it was called Unforgiven, it was simple but very hard to play. A group of worms on a bunch of letters isn't actually a safe place. So one has to play very carefully, and he may not make a mistake.
    The are intended for the better players for worms, it adds more challenge in the game, the computer is rather stupid and very good at killing it's own worms. For more challenge i recommend that you turn 'Homing Missiles' and the 'Strikes' completly off. They are to easy, just point and fire is not difficult hehe.
    TIP : use bungee and ninja rope, it will help you a lot.

    This product is emailware (<- new kind of warez). If you like it you could send me money (i doubt someone will do that), but anyway. Here is my @{"address" link Author }.
