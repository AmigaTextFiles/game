<FONT SIZE=+2>Welcome!</FONT><P>

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Please note that all files here (levels, landscapes and
documents) are under heavy construction!</FONT><P>

Well, since this is a very early version of the package, there's not too much to write
about. As the landscapes grow, so will this document :-)  Basically this is the
beginning of a custom set for <A TARGET="_TOP" HREF="http://www.team17.com/wdc/">Worms
The Directors Cut</A>. Currently only featuring a half complete Wallace and Gromit
landscape, I soon hope to have customs for each individual character, including
Landscapes, Customs and even Grafitti levels. Enjoy!<P>

I hope that some of you will <A HREF="contributions.html">contribute</A> to this set.
Without your help, these customs aren't gonna get much better..<P>
