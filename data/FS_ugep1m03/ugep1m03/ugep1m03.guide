This is my first attempt at
mission design.  It is set
30 years after the Great War
in an alternate universe where
the GTA is only a memory. In
the final mission in the Main
Campaign Beta Wing defected and
with the help of the Shivans
destroyed all of the strike force.
With Earth destroyed by the
Lucifer, most of humanity gave
up hope.  Some even started
running local goverments under
the eye of the Shivans and became
known as theRegional Terran
Goverment, or RTG.  What was left
of the GTA Fleet became the
Galactic Terran Resistance, or
GTR. You play as a pilot who
recently joined up with the GTR.
The GTR mainly uses hit-and-run
tactics.  In this mission you go
after one of the headquarters of
the RTG in the Ribos system.

Special Thanks to Icefire, for
designing the Node Map I used to
set up the worlds in my campaign.
