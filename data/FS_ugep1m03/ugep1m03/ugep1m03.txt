Notes
---------------
This is my first attempt at mission design.  It is set 30 years after the Great War in an alternate universe where the GTA is only a memory. In the final mission in the Main Campaign Beta Wing defected and with the help of the Shivans destroyed all of the strike force.  With Earth destroyed by the Lucifer, most of humanity gave up hope.  Some even started running local goverments under the eye of the Shivans and became known as theRegional Terran Goverment, or RTG.  What was left of the GTA Fleet became the Galactic Terran Resistance, or GTR.  You play as a pilot who recently joined up with the GTR.  The GTR mainly uses hit-and-run tactics.  In this mission you go after one of the headquarters of the RTG in the Ribos system.

Special Thanks to Icefire, for designing the Node Map I used to set up the worlds in my campaign.
