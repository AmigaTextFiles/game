                 Notes about "Floating" and "Toxic" tracks

First of all, thank you for reading this as I never read the files called Readme
as I don't like being told what I must do. (Nooo , It's a joke !)

I've designed over about a month or so the tracks based around the
"Floating Island" and the "Toxic Refinery" track sets.  Because I had
received The XTR_editor and I wanted to make tracks which look like to
those of which are in F-Zero. (a reallllly good game : I think Xtreme
Racing is not inspired enough of this game) That is the reason why
I've designed "Double Tracks" : Two different paths in one track with
common parts. (day and night using horizon gradient)

I first drew my tracks on paper while I was looking for good ideas (High Jump,
Side Jump, CrossRoads which can be crossed on both sides, fast roads,
the way between the barrels...)

I then started to edit the tracks on the editor...
I thought I would be able to finish my first track in 3 or 4 hours but
because I am such a perfectionist it took me more than 50 hours (10%
editing 90% improving !!!) Of course I've tested my tracks for each
modifications and it is this which takes me a lot of time.

My imperatives

 - Make "double tracks" : Don't think that it is faster to create "double
   tracks" (Having two different routes on only one track) - It is
   the contrary !!! It takes a lot more time to create one part of the
   "double track" than to create a single track. I won't tell you about
   the second part !!!

 - Use an specifical idea in each track (see below)

 - I have done everything I can to give you the possibility to continue
   a race immediatly after dying ( I mean if you die and the computer put
   you just in front of a hole, in majority of cases there is a way to
   bypass the hole safely )  For example in game's tracks, it is frustrating
   to die two times in a row because it is impossible to jump a hole.

 - Having a best laptime between 28 and 29 seconds for the .3 tracks
   (Floating City_3 + Toxic Refinery_3) and between 29 and 30 for the
   ._3* tracks. IT WAS TOTALLY MAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can't
   realize how difficult it was to do that. I have had to add the
   short-cut in Floating City_3 track to gain 4 seconds and not more
   (Aaaargh !!!) because my laptimes aren't fantaisists at all - Take a
   look at the my laptimes if you don't believe me - Another example :
   In Toxic Refinery_3 the way in the acid have been made because I
   completed the lap too fast (25 seconds)


If you beat my lap record and put it under 28 or 29 seconds , I KILL
YOU !!! ;)

PS: I have also included the track "Snow_City_1" which is a simple
    single track which I made in about 5 hours. For the laptimes IDEM
    between 29 and 30 seconds !!!

PPS: About the 28-30 seconds imperative, it is not because I'm
     totally mad but because I think a track completed in less than 28
     seconds is too short and in more than 30 seconds is too long !!!

     As you can see, all my laptimes in the game XTR are under 30
     seconds even Hell_Below_2 !!!!! (I have driven hard in order to
     make this laptime)

PPPS: For your information, 32-35 seconds are good times for my tracks.
      Less than 32 seconds, with short-cuts, bonuses and a lot of luck
      and hability (You aren't allowed to make the smallest fault) you
      can put your laptime below the 30 seconds (and perhaps beat my
      lap record)


TIPS:

According to those who have tested my tracks, it's seemed that it is a
bit difficult to know which way we must use in order to complete a lap
: - It is really easy ->> You always must go straight when there is a
crossroads (but bypass obstacles like lava) ; Follow computer's cars if
you really don't see which way you must use !!!

There are many secrets and short-cuts (At the beginning I didn't want
to put secrets but I was forced one more time because of my laptimes
was under 30 seconds !!!!)



Notes about files adding in the directory Modules :

They come from Aminet :
 -> BrainForSale is in the directory Mods
 -> Psycho and Death come from the excellent game KnockOut2 (Try it, this game
    is too fun)

I've transformed them in two-voices Modules with a different organization
of patterns so that they fit with Xtr-Racing. I hope their authors won't kill
me to have degrade them too much .....
Listen to the originals and up yourself an idea !

Oh, also: Take a look at the page of David Flaherty
(http://www.nutts.demon.co.uk) it is reaaaaally good and if you are a
XTR fan you will be able to see best laptimes and to upload yours ...
-> and there are many others interesting things in his page ( I can
assure you he hasn't paid me for this publicity )
