Here are my two first cups (Eight tracks and one complete Tiles Set)
For the moment, each of its only contain four tracks ( no bonus tracks ) but perhaps
if I receive mails of many XTR fans ( Am I dreaming  ?) I will complete its with new tracks
(I'd like to know if there are still many XTR_fans so don't hesitate to mail me if
you are)

If you have already the Xtr_adf archive , delete it ( EXCEPT MODULES !) and replace it with
this one which contain all old tracks with some improvings
(I haven't kept modules in this new archive because its are big)
If you want its, download Xtr_Adf.lha

     For the floppy users, buy an HD or Create a data-disk (8) and ....
