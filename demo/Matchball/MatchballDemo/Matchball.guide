Matchball is a Tennis game Martin started to write as it seems that there will
be no alternative to Great Courts 2. He tries to program it as modular as
possible, so that its easy to change various parts of the game. This project
is in early stage and still beta. So try it on your own risk.

@{B}@{U}@{JCENTER}Controlling Matchball@{UB}@{UU}

@{JLEFT}
Matchball @{"requires" LINK "Req"} a CD32-Joypad there will be no support for
one Button-Joypads.


@{JCENTER}@{B}Pad:@{UB}Movement

Movement in 8 directions. The player stops to run if you stop pressing a
direction or if you press one of the four strike buttons.


@{JCENTER}@{B}Pad in combination with the four buttons:@{UB}Strike

If you press one of the four buttons you´ll be attending to make a strike. In
combination with pressing the pad you give the ball a direction. The longer
you press the button the faster the ball gets.


@{JCENTER}@{B}Red Button:@{UB}Drive

With a Drive you can give the ball the fastest speed (except of Smash). But its
not a very save strike. You should only use it if you play long balls. Never try a
short ball.


@{JCENTER}@{B}Green Button:@{UB}Top-Spin

The Top-Spin is not as fast as a drive. On the other hand its a very save strike and
it has a higher trajectory as the drive or the slice.


@{JCENTER}@{B}Blue Button:@{UB}Slice

When you make a slice, the ball gets a backspin. That means that the trajectory gets
deeper and the speed of the ball is much lower. A very safe strike. If you press the
Blue Button and down the player makes a stop.


@{JCENTER}@{B}Yellow Button:@{UB}Lob

The Lob is a very good idea if the opponent is attending to make an attack at
the net. With this strike you play a very high ball. The opponent has three
possibilities. Firstly he can run to the base line and hit him there. The
second possibility is to smash the ball and the last chance is ... to hope
that the ball is landing outside.


@{JCENTER}@{B}Any Button in the right position:@{UB}Volley and Smash

If you are in the right position to the ball you´ll make a smash or a volley.
A volley is a strike if you hit the ball before the first contact with the ground.
Normally this should happen if you are near to the net. The same could be
said about the smash. The player does a smash if the opponent makes a lob.

@NODE "Req" "Requirements"


All you @{"should" LINK "Help"} need to play the demo:


lowlevel.library

AHI V4.0

AGA *

68020 or higher **

Helvetica.font (If you don't have this Font you have to edit the Data/Advert.inf File)

OS 3.1 (3.0) ***

Harddisk  (~1 MB free space)

CD32 - PAD





* As this game uses only OS calls it could be possible to play it with
  Graphic-Cards Emulation. As we don't have a Gfx-Card I have no clue
  about this ...

** We tried it with an 030/50 MHz. I don't think that a 020 is fast
   enough.

*** A OS 3.0 with the newest SetPatch should be enough.




We tested the game on an Amiga 1200 with this system-configuration:


68030 / 50 MHz

64 MB (not necessary for this demo)

AGA

OS 3.1
