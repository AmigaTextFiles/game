 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Introduction@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}
 
 Welcome to the latest demo of @{I}In Shadow of time@{UI}!

 What you're about to see, is our humble attempt at a fast, beautiful,
 intriguing, highly configurable, bugless, point&click adventuregame
 with great atmosphere.

 This game has been under development for the last two, three years now.
 While programming we opted for high speed, efficient memoryhandling and
 minimised loadingtimes. This made the game playable even on low-spec
 machines, like an A1200 with only one floppydrive. More info on the
 hardware needed to play this game can be found on the @{"requirements" LINK "Requirements"} page.

 When designing the point&click interface we tried many different models and
 shapes before we came up with the @{"interface" LINK "Interface"} you find in this preview.



@ENDNODE

@NODE "Requirements" "Requirements to make the game run"

 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Required:@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}
 o An A1200 or A4000
 o OS 3.0+
 o 68020+
 o AGA chipset
 o 1.5-2 Mb memory
 o A TV or a monitor that can sync at 15 khz

 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Recommended:@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}
 o Harddrive
 o Some fastmemory


@ENDNODE

@NODE "Installation" "Install Shadow of Time on harddrive"
 
 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Installation procedures:@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}

  The easiest way to install the game is to run the installerscript by
  doubleclicking the 'Install_ISOT' icon from workbench.
  (Note: This script needs the 'installer' utility from ESCOM AG. It's
   available from Aminet in the util/misc drawer.)

  If this fails for some reason, you'll have to do it by hand.

  Step 1: Create a drawer where you want the game to be located.
          New drawers can be created with the '@{I}Window/New drawer@{UI}' function
          from the workbench menu.

  Step 2: Copy the contents of the 'Fonts' directory to where ever your
          fonts are located (Normally in SYS:Fonts or System:Fonts).

  Step 3: Copy all the files from disk #1 into the drawer,
          EXCEPT for the 'Fonts' and 'Icons' drawers!

  Step 4: Copy the contents of all other disks into the same drawer.

  Step 5: Done.


  Note: If you're going to copy the files via workbench, you have to select
        the '@{I}Window/Show/All files@{UI}' function, or you'll be unable to find
        nor copy all the files necessary to run the game.


@ENDNODE

@NODE "Interface" "SystemIII - Instructions and keys"
 
 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Building commands:@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}

  @{U}Commandmenu@{UU}

   By pressing the right mousebutton anywhere on the main display you
   activate the commandmenu, from which you choose the verb you want to use.

   There are two ways to work with the commandmenu:

   o You click the right mousebutton to bring up the menu, move the pointer
     to the verb of your choosing, and then click the left mousebutton to
     select the verb. You can also press the right mousebutton a second time
     to close the menu without making a selection.

   o If you on the other hand keep the right mousebutton pressed, you can
     use it just like the normal operatingsystem menus. Keeping the right
     button pressed you move the mouse to the verb you want and release the
     button. You can also close the menu without making a selection by
     releasing the button outside the menuwindow, and then click the right
     mousebutton again.

   There is an option concerning the commandmenu in the @{"configurationwindow" LINK "Configuration"}.

  @{U}Inventorypanel@{UU}

   The inventorypanel is the lower part of the screen. It contains all your
   inventories and the means to move the list up and down, by two arrowbuttons
   to the left.

   Below the icons you have the name of the place you are in. There are also
   two buttons, to open the preferencewindow and to quick-save the game. To
   the right you find you current gamescore.


 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Keys:@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}

  @{B}F1-F10@{UB} - 

   @{B}Space@{UB} - Brings up the @{"configurationwindow" LINK "Configuration"}.

       @{B}R@{UB} - Repeat the last message spoken.

     @{B}Esc@{UB} - Exit game.


 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Buttons:@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}

   @{B}Prefs@{UB} - Brings up the @{"configurationwindow" LINK "Configuration"}.

 It's a beautiful day and Carl Tadpole decides, in a flash of genious, to
 skip school... again. He eats a quick and nutritious breakfast and then
 drops in on his friend, an extremly intelligent man, who happens to be a
 janitor. After some social drivel and having unknowingly invited some
 really nasty aliens, Tadpole sets out to buy some stuff for his friend.
 When the demo begins only one iteam remains... a newspaper.

		... and the adventure begins...

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Limitations" "Limitations of this demoversion"

 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Demo limitations:@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}
   o Load- and Savegame won't work.
   o Only a couple of rooms to explore.
   o A lot of Sound FX was removed to reduce archivesize.


@ENDNODE

@NODE "Configuration" "Ingame configurationscreen"

 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Tooltypes & arguments@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}

  You can specify these after the programname if started from CLI, or in the
  'tooltypes' window of the workbench icon.

  @{U}Nosound@{UU}
   If you specify this, System3 won't try to allocate the audiochannels, so
   you are free to use your own moduleplayer.

  @{U}Nomusic@{UU}
   This is a 'memorysaver', as System3 won't load nor play the in-game music
   and thus saves memory.
   Use this if you run out of memory at some point in the game.

  @{U}Nobuffer@{UU}
   This disables the room bufferingsystem. This could be usable if you run
   the game from a fast harddrive and want to save the memory.

  @{U}CloseWB@{UU}
   If you specify this, SystemIII will try to close the workbench on startup.
   This is also activated if you have less than 1.4Mb total free, or less
   than 1Mb chipmemory free on startup.


 @{BG Fill}@{FG Shine}@{B}Ingame configurationscreen@{UB}@{BG Background}@{FG Text}

  This window is displayed by pressing either the button at the bottom of 
  the screen called 'Prefs', or by pressing SPACE.

  To exit the prefswindow, press the right mousebutton.

  @{U}Gamespeed@{UU}
   This 4-position slider adjusts the gamespeed. Right=faster

  @{U}Textspeed@{UU}
   This 7-position slider adjusts the delay before the textdisplay disappear.
   Right=less time before disappearing.

  @{U}Pointer@{UU}
   This 4-position slider sets which one of the four available
   mousepointerimages you want to use.

  @{U}Brightness@{UU}
   This slider lets you set the backbrightness of all windows. Try it!

  @{U}Roombuffers@{UU}
   This slider lets you set the amount of rooms to buffer.

   Note: If the game runs out of memory, the roombuffers will be discarded,
   along with some other things, and the memory is returned to the system.
   In other words, you can set the slider to the maximum amount of buffers,
   even if you own a standard A1200 with only 2 Mb of chipram.

  @{U}Savedevice@{UU}
   This one lets you choose where to save your games.

    Progdir: saves them in the same directory you put the game.
    RAM:     saves them on the ramdisk.
    DF0:     saves them on a formatted disk in the internal diskdrive.

  @{U}Textmode@{UU}
   Here's one that lets you choose if the textwindows should follow the
   character around, or disappear when you press the left mousebutton.

  @{U}Videomode@{UU}
   @{B}This function doesn't work on all monitors and/or TVs.@{UB}

   If you have a TV or a monitor that can handle a 60Hz NTSC-display, you
   can get a larger picture by setting this to 60 Hz.

  @{U}Sound@{UU}
   This button toggles the soundsetting.

   All     - All sounds and music
   SoundFX - Sounds only
   Music   - Music only
   None    - Take a wild guess!

  @{U}Menumode@{UU}
   The right mousebutton-menu can operate in two different ways.

   Normal  - This is the standard one, where you press the right mousebutton 
             and choose a verb. You then click on a zone with the left
             mousebutton to choose the object.

   On zone - If the mousepointer is over a zone when you bring up the
             verbmenu, the object belonging to the zone is added to the verb
             you choose. If it's a single-object verb, the command will also
             be activated.

  @{U}Credits@{UU}
   It's a secret! :)

  @{U}Exit to DOS@{UU}
   This one exits the game.

  @{U}Info@{UU}
   Displays various info on the system, like processors and available memory.
