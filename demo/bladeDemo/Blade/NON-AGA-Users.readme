This readme is for people with NON-AGA Machine!!!
(All AGA users dis-regard this file)

In order to use the OCS gfx for the game and not the Default
AGA gfx. U must enter 2 assigns for the game.
They are the following.......

"Assign Blade1:" to the Blade DIR. (ex.  assign blade1: ram:blade)

"Assign Blade2:" to "Blade1:OCSData/"

That is all for the assigns.
