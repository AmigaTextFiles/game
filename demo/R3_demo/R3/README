                              ==============
                              Welcome to R3.
                              ==============

After being a THRUST fan on the C64, I was disappointed with most Amiga
games of this genre.  Most were too simple, too slow, and too awkward to
fly.  And I never liked the fact that one little crash into a wall
meant instant death.

So I tried to write a better one.  I hope you like it.


DISCLAIMER:   It's not my fault.
-----------   Your computer might burst into flame, igniting an explosion
              that destroys several city blocks every time you run this
              program.

              HOWEVER, it will probably work just fine.  Try it out.


REQUIREMENTS: Any 1Meg (or more!) Amiga.
-------------

HOW TO RUN:   For most users, just click on the "R3_Demo" icon, or boot
-----------   the disk.

              PROBLEMS?
              ---------
              If the screen rolls, you may have to adjust the vertical
              hold on your screen.  This is because my game runs in NTSC.

              If you (still) have Kickstart 1.3 AND only half a meg of 
              chip memory, you may have to run the "VERY_LOW_CHIP" version.

              In the R3 directory, there are two ways to start the game -
              "R3_Demo" and "R3_Demo VERY_LOW_CHIP"
              These run the normal or low-chip settings respectively.

              To choose which version to run when booting off the R3
              disk, click on the "Change startup" icons in the main
              directory.

              The low-chip option uses degraded sound samples.


INSTALLING:   To Install to hard-disk, just drag the R3 directory to
-----------   wherever you want on your hard-disk.


If you haven't played the game yet, what are you doing reading this
waffle!?  Go and play it!

It certainly took a lot of time and effort to do all the code, graphics,
sound, etc. myself.  That's why I'd like something in return.  I want
to buy a nice new amiga (I wrote this game on my clunky old A500).  I'd
also like to pay the rent and eat food for a while.  Feel free to play
this demo, but if you like it, please register.  Of course, if you DON'T
register, I might buy a PC and support Microsoft and Intel for the rest
of my life...  aaargh!  You wouldn't want THAT to happen, would you?

REGISTRATION gets you a full version of the game - with all 15 ships,
more baddies and LOTS of new and exciting levels.

You also get a wonderful level editor, capable of designing as many sets
of levels as you like.  When the game boots, you get to choose which
level set you would like to play (the ones I designed, or any add-on set
you happen to have).

= AND =  YOU get a *FREE*, previously unreleased GAME!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Tritus" is the best Tetris-like game I've ever played.  It's three
player competitive.  Every line you get affects the other players.
There's a host of nasty things you can do to each other.  The graphics
are nice (I helped design the blocks :-) and the game is VERY smooth.
The computer can play well, and it varies it's skill level to match
yours.  You can also play with up to three humans.  This game was
written by my flatmate Davin Pearson, who has allowed me to include it
for a small commission.


So really, you have absolutely no reason not to register this game.


The registration fee is NZ$20 or 10 pounds sterling.  (WOW, how cheap!)
I'm sure my bank will exchange other currencies too if you can't get
pounds or NZ$, but make sure what you send is worth at least 10 pounds
(about US$15).

To register, send your (real) name and address and the registration fee

TO my U.K agent:

        Ellen Johnstone     (pounds preferred)
        11 Abbey Rd
        Scone
        Perthshire
        Scotland
        U.K.  PH26LW


OR myself:

        Bruce Webster       (NZ$ preferred)
        29 Tika St
        Christchurch
        New Zealand  8004

You will receive TWO disks - one containing the game and level-editor,
the other containing levels (and Tritus).  These can (of course) be
easily installed onto Hard-disk, if you have one.  You should definitely
get your disks within a month - if they don't arrive by then, please
start complaining to me.

Your comments are welcome.
For example, you could tell me how much you prefer my two-player
side-by-side screens (A very tricky copperlist) to those
one-above-the-other skinny rectangles that most games use.

My email is:  b.webster@student.canterbury.ac.nz.

If that bounces (it shouldn't!), you could try:
                                           websbd3@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz
or care of my brother Craig (a flatmate):  craigw@pretzel.equinox.gen.nz



THANKS go to:  Davin Pearson (flatmate)

                 for listening to me blether about algorithms, copper
                 instructions and other nonsense.  He also tried to draw
                 some graphics, designed some levels and spent too many
                 hours "testing" - ie trying to blast me in Dogfight.

                 He wrote Tritus, too. 

               Blitz Basic   :  What I wrote (almost) all of the code in.
                                OK, so it has some bugs, but it's
                                powerful and easy to use.
