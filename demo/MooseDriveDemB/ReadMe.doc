PUBLIC HEALTH WARNING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The public are advised not to take this game too seriously, as
doing so could ultimately be bad for your sanity.


REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Approximately 780K of free, un-fragmented memory.
 AmigaDos 2.0 or higher; needs 1Meg chip RAM (works fine with 3.0)
 MooseDrive is PAL only.


INSTRUCTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Moose Drive is a pseudo-isometric 3D racing game. It boasts a wide
range of features:

 Fast and exciting races
 Silky smooth 50 frames a second scrolling
 Pit your skills against 2 computer cars
 Top-notch stereo music and sound effects
 Instant action replays of the last 20 seconds at any time
 Your opponents improve as you do
 Spend your race winnings at the shop to improve your car

To load the game, you can either boot with the disk in the drive
and wait for it to load, or you can run it from workbench  
memory permitting. For those of you with hard drives, simply
copy all the files into the same drawer and double-click on 
the Moose Drive Demo icon.

From the main menu you can either mess with the settings or 
plunge straight into the race proper. Assuming you'd rather 
twiddle first, use the mouse or the joystick to do so. You 
can then save your settings to disk (providing the disk is 
write-enabled) using the appropriate option.

Okay, time to race. The objective is to complete the six laps
before at least one of the two computer opponents. If they both
beat you it's game over. Winning a race earns you cash, and coming
second does too, although considerably less than when you win.

To control your car you use the joystick, with fire acting as
accelerate and down acting as brake or reverse. At any time,
pressing the spacebar or the left mouse button will pause the game
and bring up the replay menu. Double-clicking on the leftmost
button will return you to the main menu, and the other four buttons
act as a video recorder would. Stop takes you back to the game.


AFTER THE RACE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Assuming you don't come last, after the race you can upgrade your
car at the shop. Motors add to your top speed, batteries improve
your acceleration, and tyres increase your grip. Once you have
decided what to buy you will start the next race. As this is only a
demo, there are only two tracks to compete on. The registered
version, however, includes ten different tracks of varying
difficulty.

If you get completely thrashed, try altering the car set-up of the
opponents. This is done from the main options screen. You can alter
the top speed, acceleration, cornering speed and the amount they
improve by each race. If you find the default settings a bit hard,
then alter them, but be warned, you will then receive less money
after each race.

Once you have competed in four races then the game is over and you
may be asked to type in your name for the high score table. If the
disk is write-enabled then the scores will be saved to disk. Your
score is calculated from the amount if money you won during the
game and how much you have left.


WHY SHOULD I REGISTER?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You should register for the full version of Moose Drive because:

 Moose Drive has been almost twelve months in the making, and the
authors have spent lots of time and effort to create this game for
you.
 You will receive the full version with 10 tracks.
 The full AMOS source code will be included on disk.
 You'll be able to race a full uninterrupted season.
 You will be able to read the wonderful printed manual, which will
enlighten you as to the numerous hidden secrets within Moose Drive.
 You won't be overcome with a deep-rooted sense of guilt whenever
you get within a three-mile radius of your computer.
 It's only a fiver.

address to either of the following addresses.
