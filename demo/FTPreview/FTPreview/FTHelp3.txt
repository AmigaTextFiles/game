Main Menu Help

This is The Main Menu.  First try the Options menu to configure the game to
your taste (especially if you have a CD32 control pad or two joysticks).

&Start a New Game:  will take you to the Operation selection menu so you can
select a set of missions to play.

&Return to game:  if you have already started a game and then returned to
the main menu, this will take you right back to the briefing screen.

&Information:  displays info on the game, the story (if you can call it
that :), credits, and info on how to get the full version (not yet though).

&Quit to dos:  as it says, it does.  The game will exit back to wherever you
started it from.
