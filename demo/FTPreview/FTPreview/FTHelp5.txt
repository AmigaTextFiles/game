Operation Selection Help

Here you select which Operation to play.  Just click on the picture map of
the operation.  To load a seperate Operation-Set, click load op set, and
select the op-set file to load, then pick an Operation from that op-set.
(Not available in the -preview-)

Remember that most Operations (except for Training) have randomly selected
missions, when you fly through once you may only see half of the missions,
fly through more times to play different variations of that operation.
(In this -preview- the available Operations only have one mission each)

Don't worry if you get shot down a lot, as long as you have some helicopters
left you can get through an Operation, if you get through but didn't do very
well, try again.  Flying takes practice.
