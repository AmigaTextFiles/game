Phew, now that that's out of the way, we can get down to business.  :)

Flying Tigers was designed for NTSC video systems, it should work fine on
PAL systems though.  You might want to run a program like Degrader to switch
to 60hz/NTSC first so the screen isn't squished.

I'm releasing this Preview of Flying Tigers to see what people think, and
to hopefully whet their appetites for the full game.  If you have any
questions, comments, criticisms, or ideas, please feel free to send them to
me at "longbow@mcd.on.ca".

Remember that this is just a Preview, the full game and Shareware demo
will be better in many ways, and they'll have a lot more meat to them.

** Installation **

Just drag the FTPreview drawer anywhere you like, no annoying assigns are
needed to play the game.  At present it can't run from floppy (too big), the
full version will have two-disk code for the people without HDs.

**  How To Play **

Double click on the nice big icon.  :)  Since there is fairly extensive
online documentation and help from within the game, I won't go into the
details of the controls and vehicles here, just the basics:


Stick without Fire:

   Increase Collective (Up)
              ^
Bank Left <-- | --> Bank Right
              v
   Decrease Collective (Down)


Stick With Fire:
                     Fire Wingtip Weapon
                              ^
                              |
Fire Outboard Weapon <-- Turn Around --> Fire Inboard Weapon
                              |
                              v
                        Fire Chaingun


Double Tap (not too quick):
Towards your heli's rear:  Turn Around
Up twice or Down twice:    Evasive Bank

Note:  When you let go of the stick your Helicopter's controls don't center,
you'll keep flying in the left/right and up/down direction you were going
in.  To center them, watch the HUD markers along side your Helicopter.

Remember, flying takes practice, don't over-control, and take it easy.

Wiith CD32 Pad Control each of the four main buttons fires a different
weapon hardpoint, the top buttons turn and evade, both at once ejects.

Keys:  SPACE=Eject  ESCAPE=Abort F=Toggle FLIR (Forward Looking Infra-Red)

Have fun!

** Shameless Plug **

If you don't have MagicWB, GET IT!  It makes your whole system look oh so
much nicer in all respects, and makes you dump that 640x200 mode for a REAL
screenmode with more lines and square pixels!
