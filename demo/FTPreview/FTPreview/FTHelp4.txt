&Clouds and High-Quality-Mode Voices require at least 1 Meg of Chip Ram, if
you only have 1/2 Meg of Chip Ram, upgrade.  For the hi-fi Voices you also
need to have downloaded the extra voices file if this is the demo version.

&Music on/off toggles music for all the menus.

&Game Speed sets how the game will manage speed.  Auto-detect is by far the
best, if the frame rate goes down as more things happen, things will move
more each frame, thus keeping a steady speed.  If you want to fool around
with fast or slow you can try the other settings.
