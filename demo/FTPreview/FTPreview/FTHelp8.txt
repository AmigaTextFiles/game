Welcome to the end

Thanks for playing the -Preview- of &Flying Tigers&!

Remember to watch for a -Demo- with many more levels to play when
the Full Version becomes available, the full game will feature:

& 5 operations with around 90 missions in total
& Over 20 types of real Enemy units to blow up
& 7 different attack helicopters to fly,
  and 2 air support Jets
& Realistic flight controls and weapon systems
& Optional CD32 Pad support (with lowlevel.library)
& Fly with up to Two Intelligent Wingmen
& Effects such as blisteringly huge Explosions,
  Rain, Night Missions, Paralax Clouds,
  Fog, Thunder Storms, and Lightning (can hit
  you and start fires on the ground)
& Randomized Missions, (almost) never play the same Operation twice
& Online Help, information on most things from in-game


Hope you had fun!  Try out the other preview Operation also.
