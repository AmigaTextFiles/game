  disk-version.


A very important question: FLYIN'HIGH and graphics boards.
----------------------------------------------------------

FLYIN'HIGH does NOT support GFX-boards. But that
doesn`t mean that you can`t play it: If you have AGA and
a GFX-board, simply make sure that the screen will not be
promoted to a different screenmode.
