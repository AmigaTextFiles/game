This is the latest version of my attempt at a Wolfenstein clone
excitingly titled wolf23_ish !!! This is AGA only folks (sorry)!
Actually not much work has been done since Wolf2.lha was uploaded
due to exams. However, the perspective problem has been fixed and
a depth shading option has been added - press right mouse
button to alternate between inside (depth shaded walls) or 
outside (copper shaded floor and sky). The raytracing algorithm
has been speeded up a bit to give about 22 frames/second on a
basic A1200(.rough version gives about 25). My GVP 030 board with
fast ram gives about 52 frames per second on average (.rough
version gives about 60). You can test the frame rate by typing

run wolf23_ish

(or run wolf23_ish.rough)

from the shell. When you exit you'll get 'wolf23_ish failed with 
returncode xxxx' where xxxx is the framerate *100.
( I know its a crappy method but I've been pushed for time the
last month)

Apologies for crap maze and textures but this is just meant to
be a small demo of what I'm attempting to do.

Controls:
---------

Pretty simple: mouse moves around, left button exits
	       right button switches inside or outside

Future:
-------

As I said, this is only a small update. I'll not be doing much
for another 2 weeks (10 - 12,000 word dissertation to write
up :-< ) However, as of 1st August I will be implementing loads
of new stuff.
My friend Ed is designing and coding the status bar and message
system for the game.
I already have a newer raycasting algorithm in mind which will
allow for walls at non-orthogonal angles, sliding doors etc..
I'm currently considering the routines to add baddies etc.. into
the game. At the moment there is no blitter useage in the program
but it will be used later..
I'll also add more levels of depth shading.
Oh yeah, should have a decent tune sorted as well..

The .rough version is a bit less accurate in the raycasting (ends of
walls may appear to 'jitter') but gives a few more frames per second
for the basic 1200.

Feedback:
---------

Okay, this proggie is still only in its embryonic stages so 
please don't mail me and say the textures are crap etc.. - I know
they are :-} I'd like people to mail me and tell me the kind of 
frame rate they're getting with the programs (and tell me the
machine used.)
I basically want to know if people think the framerate is adequate
on a basic 1200 since my own opinion is too subjective (ie I
think its ok !!).
Also, do you think the .rough version is neccessary / gives a good
enough framerate on the 1200 ?
If its deemed too slow then I may switch to a copperscreen thingy
but my own personal view is that I like a largish screen and
you would need to use a 2*3 copperscreen which is TOO chunky.
Future updates may be a bit quicker since although I've rewritten
most of the routines, there are still a few I haven't looked at for
a month (such as the c2p routine).

Anyway, thats enough bullshit from me!!
