@node intr "Short Introduction"

  PowerBattle is a light multiplayer strategygame.  It is not finished
  yet, so things may change every now and then..

  Game is played turn by turn on a hex-based map.  Map is linked from
  edges so that there are no corners.

  @{" !!! IMPORTANT !!! " link impo}
@endnode

@node impo "Very very VERY important !!!  ... ?.. :-) "

  Please do not use too old version.  I'm trying fix things so that
  latest or so version would be available in Aminet.

  You are using this program in your responsibility.  I will guarantee
  nothing.  You can blame only yourself if something terrible
  happens...  blah blah blah...  you know.

  This is MAILWARE so please send @{"me" link auth} some post!

  All things in this package is (c) Copyright by Timo Suoranta 1995.
  If you anyway happen to have some sort of interest in software for
  example, just contact me directly.

@node requ "Requirements"

  This version requires about 2 MB memory, .5 chip should be enough.
  There is no OS-requirements (as far as I know..) but 4x Zoom is not
  available under Exec V 36.

  OCS should be enough although ECS & AGA screenmodes are supported.

  Harddrive is recommended, but it is possible to play from disks.
@endnode



@node inst "Harddisk Installation"

  1. Extract archive.  It'll create a subdirectory (*).
     But You have already done this since You are reading =)
  2. Add following lines to S:Startup-Sequence or S:User-Startup

     Assign PowerBattle: {path, the directory (*) from step 1 }
     Assign PBMaps: PowerBattle:Maps
     Assign PBSave: PowerBattle:Save

  3. Move @{"s/powerbattle.config" link pref}  to  S:
  4. Reboot (or execute assigns)


  (*) path ends either /PowerBattle or :PowerBattle
@endnode



@node bugs "Troubleshooting & Bugs"

  Known Bugs:

  - Zoom X 4 doesn't work on all Amigas.  Will Guru if not.
    Try, and don't use if it doesn't work.
  - Game may jam with unsuitable starting values on new game.

  I'd guess PowerBattle doesn't like exotic screenmodes.  So please
  try disabling ModePromotion &  setting WB to normal PAL if you
  encounter messy graphics or other uncommon 'features'.

  In configuration file, real screenmode-ID's can be tested.  Some
  will work while others probably won't.  It looks like 640 x 400 is
  the largest screensize that will work properly.

  If you panic, try pressing SHIFT-Q (or plain q if in Map Editor).
  It will take you to the main menu, where you can select Quit to
  leave the program.

  If you want to report a bug, tell me your hardware & OS
  configuration.  You can also send me a saved game where a spesific
  bug occurs.

  @{" Reports bugs to me!!  " link auth}
@endnode



@node pref "Preferences & Configuration File"

  Configuration file is called Powerbattle.config.  It should be at S:

  Each line contains single setting.  Only first constant number
  string will be interpreted.  An example configuration:


  0                     Screenmode ID, only decimal numbers
  368                   Screen width
  282                   Screen height
  0                     InfoPanel on left side ?
  -1                    PanelButtons in use ?
  0                     Automatic Combat Report ?
  -1                    Sound Effects ?
  -1                    Automatic MoveTo ?
  4                     Unit move slide speed, 1 - 4
  4                     Scroll step on keys, n * 4


  Settings marked with ? should be set either True or False:

  -1    True
   0    False

  Only decimal number values are accepted

  If Configuration file is not found, the game will use built-in
  defaults.

@node want "!! Wanted !!"

  ALL kinds of comments are welcome!  Comments, critics, suggestions,
  support, ideas...  you know.  Just @{"contact me" link auth}.

  Improvements to unit & hex definitions and rules are also welcome.

  Game needs BADLY:

    1) Automatic Map Generator
    2) Computer Opponent / Artificial Intelligence

  If these can be achived, there might be a chance for a commercial
  product.  You are welcome to project if you think you could help me.

@node unit "Units"

  Each Unit Type has unique definitions.  These will define its
  movement & combat skills, production time, required tech-level etc.

  Two important definitions are: Movement Type & Battle Type.

  Movement Type defines those terrains, where the unit is allowed to
  move (and where NOT).  For example ground units are not allowed to
  move in water.  Air units are allowed to move everywhere.  Biggest
  ships are not allowed to move into lowest waters.

  Battle Type is one of the following:  AIR, GROUND, SEA or SUB.
  Unit's combat abilities are different against these four types.
  There is an extra 'Battle Type' CITY, but it is actually GROUND.

@endnode

@node jv1 "Infantry"

  Basic Unit.  Ideal for occupying empty cities & good for
  intelligency.  Can move safely in most terrain types.

  All Infantry units have the ability to @{"hide" link spec} in forest for example.
  Most unit definition values will change.
@endnode

@node jv2 "AntiTank"

  @{"Infantry" link jv1} with special equipment & skills to stop armoured units.
  Weak against other Infantry Units, see @{"Light Ground Unit Modifier" link modi}.
@endnode

@node jv3 "Parachute"

  @{"Infantry" link jv1} unit that can be unloaded from AirTransports anywhere.
@endnode

@node jv4 "Engineers"

  Has ability to build bridges.  This takes 2 turns.

  See normal @{"Infantry" link jv1}
@endnode

@node jv5 "Mech Inf"

  Improved version of Infantry.  Faster in some terrain types but will
  gain damage from terrain more easily.
@endnode

@node pa1 "Panzer"

  Basic armoured unit.  Has a short range gun.
@endnode

@node pa2 "H. Panzer"

  BigBrother des Panzer's.
@endnode

@node pa3 "Buggy"

  The thoughest ground unit.  Has limited visibility though.
@endnode

@node ty1 "Artillery"

  A good support for ground attacks.  Keep hidden.
@endnode

@node ty2 "Heavy Gun"

  Improved Artillery with bigger gun.  A few of these in right place
  may solve a local conflict.
@endnode

@node ty3 "Light AA"

  Exists.
@endnode

@node ty4 "Heavy AA"

  If you can keep this unit alive, it might become a real nightmare to
  enemy air units.  Can drop even bigger bogies.
@endnode

@node ty5 "Coast Gun"

  Exists.
@endnode

@node le1 "Fighter"

  An ideal unit for intelligency.  Escort for bombers.  Basic
  air-defence.
@endnode

@node le2 "Bomber"

  Efficient unit against enemy cities.
  Take a look at @{"City Attack Modifier" link modi}.
  Remember, you'll need fuel to return, too.
@endnode

@node le3 "ATFighter"

  Advanced Technoly will make this unit a key to air-superiority.  A
  very quick indeed.  Ability to use Carriers will extend its range
  even further.
@endnode

@node le4 "ATBomber"

  An ultimate weapon to ruin cities.  Don't waste 'em.
@endnode

@node le5 "Air Trans"

  Tranports Infantry units.
@endnode

@node le6 "HeliChop"

  General purpose unit.  Can load & unload infantry anywhere.
@endnode

@node me1 "T.Boat"

  A good unit to be used when spreading in the beginning.  Will not
  make it for long in medium or deep waters, so stay close to land.
@endnode

@node me2 "Destroyer"

  The only good unit against submarines.
@endnode

@node me3 "Cruiser"

  Nice guns.
@endnode

@node me4 "BattlShip - Taistelulaiva"

  Big guns.  Beware subs, though...
@endnode

@node me5 "Carrier"

  Should be escorted.
  Only AT-planes can use Carrier.
@endnode

@node me6 "Tranport"

  Will transport a good number of ground units.  Poor combatskills.
@endnode

@node me7 "Sub"

  A 'secret' weapon against bigger ships.  Remember you must/will be
  surfaced in low waters.  Dive is in the '-' key.
@endnode

@node mu1 "Settler"

  You can build roads with this unit.
@endnode
@node mu2 "City"

  Cities are counted as sort of 'units' too.
@endnode



@node star "Creating new battle"

  Recommended values for BIG (alfa) map & 4 players:

    60 coastal cities
    60 mainland cities
    15 starting cities
    50 technology-level

  - First four turns are 'protected'.  This means that no violence is
    allowed.  You may encounter enemy but you or he/she may not attack.
  - During protection turns, players get multiple 'turns' at time.

  In the beginning, produce T.Boat units in coastal cities & Mech Inf
  units in mainland cities.  Search for new cities -spread as fast as
  you can.  Next produce Settlers & make a road-net.  It is a good
  idea to produce Destroyers & Transports as soon as possible.
  Engineers can build bridges, this'll take 2 turns.
@endnode



@node move "Moving"

  In order to move:
  - Target hex must be of suitable Movement Type
  - Unit must have enough Movement Points
  - Fuel is needed in case of some units
  - There must be room for unit.  In single hex there may only be one
    of each Battle Type (One air unit, one ground etc.)
  - In cities there is room for 12 units, no matter what Battle
    Type they are.

  @{"Terrain Damage Threat System" link thre}
@endnode



@node thre "Terrain Damage Threat System"

  DamageThreat of terrain hex represents 'risk' that unit takes when
  moving in that hex.  Greater value means more risky hex, damage is
  more likely.

  Units' ThreatDefence tells how bad terrain it can handle.  Greater
  value means it can hadle worse terrains without taking damage.

  If DamageThreat is less than ThreatDefence, unit can't get damaged
  by moving.

  Otherwise, if DamageThreat is greater, increasing damage is likely.
  If ThreatDefence is only little lesser, usually a few hexes can be
  moved without serious damage.  But greater difference or distance
  will sooner or later prove fatal.
@endnode



@node comb "Closecombat & Ranged Attacks"

  Closecombat will begin, when you attemp to move to hex already
  occupied by enemy.  Ranged Attacks (Artillery for example) will be
  ordered by clicking RBM on target.

  In closecombat, first all attacker's hex's units in turn try to
  damage all units in defender's hex.  Then defender's hex will do the
  same thing.  And so on until either one hex is totally dead or both
  hexes have attacked 10 times.

  In ranged attacks, only the attacking unit will make a single
  damaging attemp to all units in defender's hex.  Some units have
  limited ammo storage.

  @{" EXAPLE           " link cmbe}
  @{" Combat Modifiers " link modi}
@endnode

@node modi "Combat Modifiers"

  A few modifiers can affect combat process:

  - Veteran Bonus.  'Green' units have modifier 1.0 (displayed 10).
    Experienced units may have up to 1.5 (displayed 15).
    Experience is gained in victorious combat against equal or greater
    unit (HitPoints).

  - Terrain Defence Bonus.  Forest for example can give significant
    cover to units.  Normal value 1.0 (displayed 10).

  - City Attack Modifier.  Especially bombers have different effect on
    cities and other ground targets.  Therefor, normal ground combat
    skill values may be lesser, but these will be multiplied up to 3.0
    if target is City Hex.

  - Ranged Attack Modifier.  Artillery units are efficient when used
    from range.  Their 'plain' combat skill values may be not a lot,
    thus making them poor at closecombat.  But combat skills will be
    multiplied by this modifier when attack is 'ranged'.

  - Light Ground Unit Modifier.  This feature was introduced to make
    Antitank efficient against armoured units but weak against
    unarmoured units.  So if target is unarmoured, combat values will
    be multiplied by this modifier. It might be between 0.1 and 2.0.
@endnode

@node cmbe "EXAMPLE of single damaging attempt"

  Attacker: Panzer - GROUND unit
  Defender: Bomber - AIR    unit

  LET  Max_Attack  = Panzer's     AIR-Attack
  LET  Max_Defence = Bomber's  GROUND-Defence

  At this point, Max values are @{"modified" link modi} to Max_Mod values.

  Modified values are Max_Mod_ -values.  Next:

  LET  Attack  = 25-100%  of  Max_Mod_Attack
  LET  Defence = 25-100%  of  Max_Mod_Defence
  LET  Damage  = Attack - Defence

  IF Damage is positive, defender's HitPoints is decreased by damage.
@endnode



@node tran "Transporters & Carriers"

  Transporters & Carriers can be used to transport, repair & refuel
  units.  Only AT-Fighters & AT-Bombers can use Carrier.


  Loading Procedure:
    - Set 'LoadPrep' on unit to be loaded.
      (You may need to cancel Temp. sentry)
    - Give 'Load' command to carrier or transporter.

  Unloading Procedure:
    - Select unit to be unloaded from tarnporter's/carrier's Cargo List
      on InfoPanel.

  Cancelling the Unload Procedure:
    - Click RMB on transporter/carrier.


  Normal Infantry can be unloaded from AirTRans ONLY in citties. Other
  infantry units can be unloaded anywhere.

  AirTransport can load units only in cities.
@endnode



@node repa "Repair & Refuel"

  Units are automatically repaired & refuelled in cities &
  traneporters / carriers.

  Cities will repair themselves when set not to produce anything, 'no
  orders'.
@endnode



@node spec "Special Abilities"

  - Settler can build road.
  - Engineers can build bridges.  Takes 2 turns.
  - Most units can change terrain to Plain.
  - Some units can build Fortress (f key) that'll have a good defence
    bonus.
  - 'Level' command will change several unit definitions:
    - defence will be enchanced
    - visibility & visible from -ranges will decrease
    - movement points will decrease
    - Ranged Attack modifier will change (artillery etc. attacks)
    - Range will change

    Level -command represents Infantry unit's ability to hide &
    submarine unit's ablity to dive.
