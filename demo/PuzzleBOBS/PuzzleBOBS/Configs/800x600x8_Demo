; PuzzleBOBS configuration file
;-------------------------------
;
; Here you can configure PuzzleBOBS game. If you find a value in which is specified the range
; between brackets you must respect its and consider that extremes values could be included.
; If you don't find range you could insert a SIGNED LONG INT value from -2147483647
; to +2147483647. If you find (+) you must insert a >0 value. 
; If you insert a string respect Amiga Dos directives and use quotes in strings with spaces.
; If an error occurs, PuzzleBOBS will confirm it to you. 
;
; Have a good configuration.

8		;DEPTH (+) of screen. If you use a window the game uses depth of Workbench screen.If you use non-amiga graphic devices you can not define this value becouse depth is in ID.
0		;FLAG (0-2) if set to (0) you use a screen, if you set to (1) you want a window and if you set to (2) you want a PIP window (Picture in Picture) but now only with Picasso96 and PicassoIV.
