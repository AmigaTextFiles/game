@node MAIN_AUTO	 "PuzzleBOBS guide - Own configurations"

Own configurations
------------------

  PuzzleBOBS is a configurable game, each thing you see at video could be modified. At this purpose
was written a detailed graphic guide which explains deeply how make a configuration file.
  This is very simple, reading the guide and starting from a configuration file just present in the
PuzzleBOBS:Configs directory.
  The graphic guide is enclosed, you can find its in PuzzleBOBS:Docs directory, written both in
Italian and English language.

@node MAIN_KEY "PuzzleBOBS guide - Function keys"

Function keys
-------------

Keys during menu stage:

  You can move vertically the bubble in the left menu's side using arrow keys "UP" and "DOWN".
  By "RETURN" or arrow key "RIGHT" you can switch the menu item choices, you can enter in a sub
page or execute a menu voice function.
  Using "DEL" key you come back from a sub page or exit from game to Workbench if you were in the
main menu page.


Keys during game stage:

  By pressing "p" key you enter in pause mode. During the pause PuzzleBOBS releases all the
allocated devices, as audio channels, remaps the screen's palette if you was playing in window.
  To enter in game again press "p", PuzzleBOBS will try to allocate again all resources.
  Is possible to stop the music and choose another one from a file requester by "F6".
  When that music module finishes PuzzleBOBS will jump to the next one if "Play mod = Sequence",
continue with the same if "Play mod = Only one", sort randomly its if "Play mod = Random".
  By "F7" you can stop the current music and skip to the next depending the sort method choosed by
the "Play mod" option.
  Pressing "ESC" you return to the menu.
  By "F9" you can get in ram: a file named "PuzzleBOBS_grab" which is a screen grab taken when
you press the key.
  The format of that file is:

  >For VGA modes.
   Chunky one byte per pixel is the screen has less or 256 colours ( <= ), or chunky 4 bytes per 
   pixel (0RGB) if the screen has more than 256 colours ( > ).

  >For standard Amiga modes.
   Raw interleaved.

  The procedure can busy the system a lot, above all if the screen you want grab has big resolutions,
so wait some seconds.
  You will get in ram: the palette also, named "PuzzleBOBS_grabpalette", its format is compatible
with the graphics.library LoadRGB32() function in 8 bit depth.


  Player 1 could be controlled using keyboard keys:

 - Arrow UP      You move the pointer arrow to 90 trigonometrics.
 - Arrow LEFT    You move the pointer arrow to left.
 - Arrow RIGTH   You move the pointer arrow to rigth.
 - Arrow DOWN    You move the pointer arrow to rigth if the angle is <= to 90, else to left.
 - SPACE	     Launch the bubble.


  Player 2 could be controlled using numeric pad keys:

 - Arrow UP	     You move the pointer arrow to 90 trigonometrics.
 - Arrow LEFT    You move the pointer arrow to left.
 - Arrow RIGTH   You move the pointer arrow to rigth.
 - Arrow DOWN    You move the pointer arrow to rigth if the angle is <= to 90, else to left.
 - ENTER	     Launch the bubble.


  Key values are written in PuzzleBOBS:ConfigFileBase, they are as raw codes and must be inserted
in decimal.

@node MAIN_REQ "PuzzleBOBS guide - System requirements"

System requirements
-------------------


  PuzzleBOBS is a high, low level configurable game, this means that all machine resources are used
dinamically.
  For this reason is very hard to define the minimum requirements needed, above all about the
memory, because depends upon too many factors.
  However the game was tested on a lot of Amiga setups, on some A1200 unexpanded also, but using
graphic configurations with low resolutions. For this reason we can say that the minimum
requirement is:

  - 68020 processor
  - AmigaOS and roms in version 3.0
  - Almost 2 MB of mem
  - An HD with almost 10 MBytes free for the partial installation

  With this setups you can play to configuration as the 320*256 at 64 or 256 colours. To play to
higher configuration as the 800x600 at 16 millions colours you need more cpu power and memory.
  The ideal setup for PuzzleBOBS is:

  - 68040 or 68060 processor.
  - AmigaOS and roms in version 3.0
  - Graphic board with almost 4MB of videoram
  - 16 MBytes of fast memory.
  - An HD with almost 120 MBytes free for the full installation

@node MAIN_SPECS "PuzzleBOBS guide - Technical specs"

Technical specs
---------------


  PuzzleBOBS is inspired to the lucky game rooms puzzle game series and introduces a lot of new
characteristics as the asynchronous game style, the possibility of playing two players mode
simultaneously in the same level, and the ability of accept a lot of levelsets with dissimilar
features.
  Moreover this game is totally configurable: you could choose screen-mode by a system requester
(supported AGA, ECS, OCS and graphic expansions as PicassoIV or Cybervision or others which are
AmigaOS compatibles by Picasso96 or CyberGraphX) up to 16-24 bits colour, all the graphical
elements of game as fonts, lateral columns, rotating pointer with gears, bubbles (of each size,
color, form, and number also animated up to 255 frames), backgrounds, then you can choose the
speed of moving objects, music and fx-sounds, apperances of explosions (as frames per seconds,
by gfx or a CPU precalculated animation), and a lot of other lowlevel options as the behaviour of
artificial brains and priorities of game's subtasks.
  Thanks to the polyvalence of LevelSet files subsystem you can have various behaviour of bubbles
in game, for example some which rebound against the top limit increasing the difficulty of game or
disposed in level by four or six tangents.
  Moreover the game foresees a lot of special bubbles as three type of bombs and others.
  PuzzleBOBS allows to zoom the bubbles if can not fit them into the level so you can use a lot of
levels even very big without space problems, or force a default zoom to save a lot of video mem.
  The game works in multitasking and can be played further on a screen so in a Workbench's window
also in a PIP (if your board affords that).
  The game can go in manual pause (p) crypting the level or can go in sleep mode automatically when
the screen or window became inactives, in the same time frees the audio channels and if you was
using a window remaps the workbench's palette.
  The hiscore system allows to maintain a lot of information about the score so you will be able to
remember the date, the LevelSet used, the game mode, the number of players, the difficulty of that
past match.
  The game has a built-in subsystem that is able to simulate the blitter's work (on VGA, AGA, ECS,
OCS) putting all graphic data (bitmaps) in fast mem (the only chip mem used is the screen's mem)
and increasing a lot the speed of Amiga without graphic board (need some fastmem).
  The game is based on a particular architecture which uses deeply the AmigaOs multitasking
characteristichs. Infact it uses a lot of sub tasks (of which you can set the priority) each one
assigned to a game's operation.
  For example there is a task which controls rotations, one which draws bobs animation and others
which controls players, levels, controllers, explosions etc, etc, these communicate between them
with signals and messages.
  The game was developed on an Amiga A4000T 68040 25MHZ, written totally in assembler. It consists
of 1.3 MBytes of code (about 70000 lines of sources). The developing started during the summer of
1997.

@node MAIN_SCOPO "PuzzleBOBS guide - Game's target"

Game's target
-------------

  The game target is to clear all the bubbles in the screen, they explode when near in a group of
three minimum, or fall down because free from others exploded. When you erase them all you pass to
a new level.
  To launch the bubble you have to press fire button, to choose its direction you have to keep the
aim moving the pointer in the bottom of the screen.
  Remember that there is a time limit between two launchs, counted by a small timer displayed
near the pointer. When the count down arrives to zero the bubble will be launched automatically.
  Moreover after some launchs all the group of bubbles will be moved down. If a bubble go over the
level limit stripe the game is over and you have to start again from the first one.
  The same for a bubble you launch from your pointer, even if placed would explode some bubbles upon
the limit.
  Each time you erase some bubbles you get some score, depending the difficulty level you choosed,
more it is harder, more score you get.
  The LevelSets could be various, they may be time limited, they could have various dispositions of
bubbles, as at four or six tangents.
  PuzzleBOBS foresees various game modes, the first one is the normal, in which you play alone.
  The same could be faced by the cooperation of two players, the cooperative method, you will have
two pointers and in the same time you will be able to attack the same group of bubbles.
  The advantage is to play in pair and if a player mistakes putting a bubble under the level limit
forget the fire faculty, but gaining again its in the level after if the second player is able to
finish the previous one.
  Finally two players can challenge using the competitive method, in which each player has a own
level with the same group of bubbles of its opponent. Who for first clear the level wins.
  Lose who puts a bubble under the level limit stripe. A bubble which falls is sent to the opponent
level group of bubbles.

@node MAIN_MENU "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu"

PuzzleBOBS menu
---------------

  Using the menu you can start the game and configure a lot of game's aspects.
  In the left side you have a bubble which points to the voice you are considering. You can move its
up or down using the arrow keys. Using return and the rigth arrow key you select the voice.
  Finally you can use the mouse, by the left button to choose the voices. The bubble will follow
your mouse vertical movements.
  The menu foresees sub pages from which you can come back by the DEL key or using the "Back" voice
always present in these pages. 

  menu's voices:

@ENDNODE

@NODE i_gamemode "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Game mode"

Game mode
---------
 
  Here you choose the game mode. It may be NORMAL, COOPERATIVE or COMPETITIVE. Choosing the NORMAL
mode you play alone to all levels.
  The same could be faced by the cooperation of two players, by the COOPERATIVE method, you will have
two pointers and in the same time you will be able to attack the same group of bubbles.
  The advantage is to play in pair and if a player mistakes putting a bubble under the level limit
forget the fire faculty, but gaining again its in the level after if the second player is able to
finish the previous one.
  Finally two players can challenge using the COMPETITIVE method, in which each player has a own
level with the same group of bubbles of its opponent. Who for first clear the level wins.
  Lose who puts a bubble under the level limit stripe. A bubble which falls is sent to the opponent
level group of bubbles.

 

@ENDNODE
@NODE i_difficulty "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Difficulty"

Difficulty
----------

  By this option you may decide the difficulty of game. The difficulty is based on the reduction
of bob's shade used to detect collisions.
  More the game is easier more the shade is reduced, and more results easy to launch a bob, 
because a lot of collisions events are bypassed.
  When you play with the hard setting the shade respects the real bob surface, so the collisions
detection becames more and more precise and the game harder.

-------

  If you play in window you can choose, when the window becames inactive or if you go in pause, if
restore the WorkBench`s screen palette or not.
  

@ENDNODE
@NODE i_zoomrespect "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Misc/Zoom Respect"

Zoom Respect
------------

  When you play to levels which are too big, the bobs will be zoomed to be fitted in the smaller
space. If you set this option to ON you will have bob scaled respecting their original sizes, else
you will get various scaled bobs depending on space allowed.


@ENDNODE
@NODE i_sleepwindow "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Misc/Sleep window"

Sleep window
------------

  If you set this to ON, when your screen or window becames inactive the game goes, without use the
pause key ( p ), in sleep mode automatically, otherwise the game will continue its action.
  Remember that if you use the keyboard as game controller, the Workbench's preferences settings
about key's delays and ripetition speed will be modified during the game phase, and only setting
this option to ON you get preferences restored to old values, during screen swapping.
  When you press the "p" key to enter in pause or your screen or window became inactive, PuzzleBOBS
will free the allocated audio channels also.


@ENDNODE
@NODE i_fastexit "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Misc/Fast exit"

Fast exit
---------

  If you set this to ON when you press "esc" during the game stage you will escape directly,
otherwise if you set this to OFF the game will ask you by a message if you want really exit from
game.
  If you press again the "esc" you will confirm the escape, while with an other keyboard's key you
ask to continue your game stage.

 

@ENDNODE
@NODE i_movenext "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Misc/Move next"

Move next
---------
  
  You can choose at which speed you want the next bob to be moved over the pointer. By FAST you will
disable the animation movement so it will be moved in the faster way possible, by SLOW you ask the
animation.
  However the speed of movement could be deeply configured directly in the ConfigFile under the
"Ball Movements" chapter.

@ENDNODE

  >Random
   By this option you pick one of them via random.
	
  >Sequence
   You pick the new one in sequence, so one for each level.
	
  >Shared
   You get them considering the LevelSet's levels number, so you divide their number by the levels
   number. If you have a 30 levels LevelSet and 3 different graphic sets you will change them every
   10 levels.
		
  >Disable
   You disable the extra data, so you will play with the first set only, the one displayed during
   menu.


@ENDNODE
@NODE i_aslrequester "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Misc/Asl reqs"

Asl reqs
--------

  PuzzleBOBS uses asl requesters to allow you, for example, to choose files and screen resolutions.
  Unsfortunately on some systems asl requesters may give some problems, they may leave trails when
moved or closed. For this reason the default option is set to "Open Out", so all asl requester will 
be open on Workbench's screen.
  If you want to have asl requester on the PuzzleBOBS own screen you can choose the "Open In"
option, but verify if on your configuration you get the above problems.  


@ENDNODE
@NODE i_hiscores "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Misc/Hiscores"

Hiscores
--------

  You can set to ON or OFF the hiscore system, if set to ON when you enter in the ten best results
the game will ask you your name, else with OFF you disable the hiscore recognition.

@ENDNODE

@NODE i_audio "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Audio"

Audio
-----

  PuzzleBOBS accepts various setups about the audio, a lot of them are visibles in this page. The
audio on Amiga platform is generated by 4 differents and indipendents voices, or channels. An
application or task which want use the audio output can choose to use one or more channels.
  PuzzleBOBS allocates a number of channels equal to your menu's settings, so you can decide how
many channels using during the game, but if a channel is busy because an other task is using its
it will be not considered, and PuzzleBOBS will allocates only the other free channels. If no 
channel is free, the audio will not be generated, but however the game will start.
  In the menu you have a lot of free choices about samples and musics output, you may change them,
but to apply the changes you have to use the menu "apply" voice.
  By this action, you will get the status of your system capabilities, so if you ask four channels
and the system is just using two of them you will see the channels voices to go to two channels
status, and if is not possible to have the Audio3D effect its voice will be set to OFF.
  Remember that if you activate the music you lose 3 or all the channels. So is possible to listen
music and sfx effects in the same time but with 3 channels for musics and only one channel for
 effects. In this case the Audio3D is disabled.

------

  You can enable or disable (ON/OFF) the music output. When enabled the musics busy 3 or all
channels.
  

@ENDNODE
@NODE i_musicacanali "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Audio/Music chans"

Music chans
-------------
  
  Is possible to choose how many channels alloc to render the musics. You can enable 0, 3, or 4
channels. If you enable 3 channels the game will use e decode system which leaves a channel to the
samples, but which has a lower output quality respect the 4 channels mode.
  Enable 0 chans looks like put to OFF the @{" Music " LINK i_musica} voice.
   


@ENDNODE
@NODE i_sfx "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Audio/Sfx"

Sfx
---

  Enable or disable (ON/OFF) sound samples output.

@ENDNODE

@NODE i_sfxcanali "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Audio/Sfx chans"

Sfx chans
---------

  With this option you can choose how many channels are used to play the audio effects. If 
PuzzleBOBSB can't open all the channels, will try to render the audio only with the avaibles.
 If all channles are busy, the audio will be disabled. You can disable the samples output choosing
0 channels also.
  
 
@ENDNODE

@NODE i_audio3d "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Audio/Audio3D"

Audio3D
-------

  With this option you can toggle the space effect. If enabled PuzzleBOBS will output a sample
considering the event on screen. If the event happens in the left middle of screen, PB will try
to render its on the left two channels, if can not bacause they aren't avaibles because busy will 
render its on the right two channels. To be enabled PuzzleBOBS needs almost one channels for both
sides, left and right. 


@ENDNODE
@NODE i_modo "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Audio/Mode"

Mode
----

  You can choose four various settings, ASYNCHRO, SYNCHRO, ABORTLAST, GOAWAY. When an event needs
an audio output asks a channel to be output, but can happens that all channels are busy, for this
reason you can:

  >SYNCHRO
   Wait, and when a channel became free output the effect, so you get a precise audio output
   when an event happens, but this could stop your event for a while.

  >ASYNCHRO
   Don't wait a channel became free, you ask a channel but you continue your action, in this way
   your events will not be stopped, but can happens that the audio effect starts in delay, so
   you may lost the cause/effect. 

  >ABORTLAST
   The third is a mixture of two above method, because you ask a channel, and if is not free an
   other past request will be stopped to be replaced with this new one.
   This method don't stop the action and dont' delay the output effect, but can stop a past
   effect truncing the sample output. 
 
  >GOAWAY
   The last method aborts the output of a sample if there is no free channels.
   By this method the events are not stopped but can happens that some effects are not 
   outputed loosing them.

  Is important to say that probably the best choice is ABORTLAST, because you will get always a
sample output when an event occurs. Is also real that this method can became inefficent when
samples became longer and longer, for this reason the best is try your samples set with all the
choices in the menu, because for example if you are using a sample set with very short effects
could be good to use the SYNCRHO choice also.

  Use this option to test the status of your system. PuzzleBOBS will try to alloc all channels you
asked, but if there are some channels busy because requested by an other app you will get enabled
only the available modes.
  If you want the musics you need 3 channels minimum. If you use 4 channels you can not listen sfx
effects and enable the Audio3D. If you use 3 channels for musics you can enable the samples but
using a channel only. Even in this case the Audio3D is disabled.

@NODE i_blitmode "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Configure/Blit mode"

Blit mode
---------

  By this option you can choose which functions you want to use to render the graphic. Be careful,
some of them could leave imperfections on video or render badly the graphic.
  I suggest to read the @{" Graphic procedures " LINK MAIN_GFXF} page in which you can find more
infos about this modes.
  The default option is "Blit mode = Use OS". 
	  
  >Use OS
   This uses the Os graphic function, and is very suggested when you use a graphic board, while on
   standard Amiga screens could be better choose "Blit mode = Cpu fast". 
 	
  >Use HW
   This uses some Os functions in combination with other optimized functions. This mode could work
   badly leaving imperfections on screen. 		

  >Cpu chip
   This mode uses the CPU instead of Blitter in all circumstances, but continue to work in chip
   memory, so could be very slow, need very fast processors.

  >Cpu fast
   This is as "Cpu chip" because uses the Cpu instead of Blitter but works with data in fast memory
   (Public mem), so is very fast and compatible with the Os.
   On graphic boards could cause some problems, as imperfections on screen, so is better in this
   case use the "Use OS" option.
	 
  >Cpu+blitter
   This mode uses Blitter and Cpu in the same time, so part of Blit will be done by the Blitter,
   and the rimanent by the Cpu.
   Moreover in ConfigFiles there is a value with which you can choose in percentage how part of
   blit have to be done by the Blitter, the rimanent will be done by the Cpu at the same time.
   The default ConfigFile percentage is 50%. This mode is disabled when using a graphic board's
   screen mode (uses "Os funcs").

  Here you can choose the aspect of bubbles expolosion. 
	 
  >Cpu
   This explosion type is calculated in real time, and is totally done by the cpu. This mode is
   always available.

  >Graphic
   In this way the explosion is drawed, is a graphic animation stripe which is precalculated. This
   is not always available because it depends on the author of ConfigFile you are using, so if you
   set this option to "Graphic" but you get a Cpu style explosion it means that the author didn't
   support this characteristic.

Fonts
-----

  You can choose if fonts in game have to respect the size of each letter when written. If they

  The only advantage of use the "No Prop" is a faster game's boot phase.  

 
@ENDNODE
@NODE i_buffer "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Configure/More/Buffer"

Buffer
------

  This option can be set to "Single" or to "Multiple" and is usefull only when are playing two
players at the same time. Infact if you choose the "Multiple" mode the game will allocate a very
big buffer (needed by the game to make a lot of graphical operations, as clipping) for each
player, else if you use the "Single" mode you will get only one buffer used by two player at the 
same time.
  The fastest mode is "Multiple" because a player to draw in a buffer doesn't have to wait the
other one have finished, so has an own private buffer, but,	as disadvantage, needs a larger
request of memory, which is doubled.
  However this options set to "Multiple" increase a lot the performances of game in all its
aspects, as for example, the bobs explosions.
  


@ENDNODE
@NODE i_clock "PuzzleBOBS guide - Menu/Configure/More/Clock"

Clock
-----

  This option lets to choose how the clock have to count the time. By "Real" the clock's hand
respects the time so the adjournament is done every second. With "Full Wise" the time is divided by
360, so the clock will have 360 adjournaments not considering the time. The adjournament can happen
more than one time per second.
  Finally with "Divide" you divide 360 degrees of movement for the time, in this way you will get
an adjournament per second, and the hand will move itself each time of an angle which result from
the report by 360 and the time in seconds.
  The most expansive is the "Full Wise" mode, the others two are similar.
		


@ENDNODE

aims the direction of your bubble.
  If you increase the number you will get others elements which have a larger rotating range of
over 360 degrees. The number of gears depends upon how many of them the configfile's author has
foresaw, and if he foresaw only one pointer this menu voice will be hided.

  >Clear
   If you select the Clear option, you will bring the hiscore page to the default values.
   However this doesn't effect the hiscore page until you select in the main page the "Save Menu"
   option. Infact the hiscores values are saved in the ConfigFileBase, so you need to save its
   each time if you need to update the hiscores list. 
   This also when you enter in the hiscores list with a new score, so to save the result remember
   to save the menu state by the "Save menu" option in the main menu page.

@node MAIN_CONF "PuzzleBOBS guide - Configuration files"

Configuration files
-------------------

  The file you use to configure game must be an ASCII standard file and the values must be written
on the left of a line and a line corresponds to a value.
  You must not jump a line, because a line without a value corresponds to 0 and after you have
inserted the value you can use tabs and spaces and finally the return to pass to the next line, but
if you insert others characters they will be consider part of value.
  If you write a number you must insert its as a decimal number using only -,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 ,
if you insert other characters you will distort the number's value.
  For example to put a number also negative you can write:

100
-100
--100

these are equivalent to 100 -100 and 100.

100a  ;this is a wrong numeric value because "a" becames part of number.

If you want insert a string you must use conventions of Amiga Dos and not exceed 79 chars lenght.
You can write:

work:puzzlebobs/gfx.obj

and if you have a string with spaces you have to write it between quotes.

"work:puzzlebobs/gfx obj"

In a line you can insert a comment with ";" and after you can write and use all characters
of ASCII set, for example:

100   ;value, 3 spaces and comment.
100;value and comment
-100			;value , 3 tabs and comment.

with a string:

work:puzzlebobs/gfx.obj		;String of a file.....


  Finally you can have free lines. To declare them you must insert ";" at the beginning of line.
for example:

;this line is not considered as a valid value line.
 ;if you insert a space before ";" the line will condsider as a valid value line as zero.


  Some strings in game can accept a return value. These are strings used during levels passage
or others circumstances.
  To get a return you can add a "" (LALT+0) in the string. For example:

"Game Over팒layers"

Will be printed on screen as.

   Game Over
    Players

If you want a space between line you can insert a space as here.

"Game Over 팒layers"

Will be printed as this:

   Game Over

    Players

  If you put a "" at the beginning or at the end of string it will not take effect. The same if
you insert more of one "" in sequence.


  I advise you to use the configuration files included in game package, copying ,renaming and
modifing these. However if you fail writing a value the game will inform you about the error
by an AmigaOS error requester.


@ENDNODE

@node MAIN_GFXF "PuzzleBOBS guide - Graphic procedures"

About optimized graphic routines in PuzzleBOBS
----------------------------------------------


  As you can see in the PuzzleBOBS configuration file or in the menu's "Configure" voice you have
a lot of possibility to set the blitting mode of graphic routines. Now you could choose five methods.
  To set one of them use the value you find near "=" and put its directly in config file.
  Between square brakets you can find the relative menu's option.



1) AmigaOS Blitting functions.	= 0 (default)	[Use OS]
------------------------------

  This uses the normal AmigaOS routines BltBitMap(), BltBitMapRastPort(), BltMaskBitMapRastPort(),
BltClear() and ClipBlit(). Unsfortunately on Amiga standard bitmaps BltMaskBitMapRastPort() is very
slow.  This is used always when you play game in window.
  This method allows you to use other external programs which are able to optimize the Blitter work.



2) Optimized gfx functions.	= 1   [Use HW]
---------------------------

  This uses corrispettives of BltBitMap(), BltBitMapRastPort() and ClipBlit(), which use blitter and
are quite faster than AmigaOS functions and dont'allow to play in a window.
  BltClear() and BltMaskBitMapRastPort() were not cloned and game uses the AmigaOs ones.
  This method can't be used with graphic boards, so only on standard Amiga screens. Be careful
because could work badly (leaving imperfections on screen).



3) Cpu graphic routines.	= 2   [Cpu chip]
------------------------

  The Blitter is a very old chip and if you have a very fast processor with some fast mem
could be better to choose this mode which uses your Cpu as unique graphic operator.
  So this method not allows the game in window so if you play in window or PIP will be used
the 1) mode.
  Consider that the blitter is not faster than a 68020, with some fast mem and caches enabled.
  This method works very well on standard Amiga screens even if could be very slow, so is better
to use the 4) method very much faster than this one.
  This method could be used on graphic boards also but can give some troubles or cause graphical
imperfections on screen, so be careful using this.



4) Cpu graphic routines and data in Fast Mem.	= 3    [Cpu fast]
---------------------------------------------

  This method uses the otpimized cpu functions you saw in 3) and moreover allocates gfx data
in fast mem (Public_mem) to speed up cpu work thanks clones of BitMapScale(), AllocBitMap() and
FreeBitMap(). This method not allows to play in a window.
  This approach speeds a lot blitting procedures because the only area in chip mem is the video
memory of screen.
  This method works very well on standard Amiga systems, however could be used on graphic boards
also, but can cause some troubles or graphical imperfections on screen, so be careful using this.



5) Blitter and Cpu cooperative parallel method. = 4    [Cpu+blitter]
-----------------------------------------------

  By this method part of blit will done by Cpu and the remanent by Blitter at the same time (first
starts Blitter and then the Cpu soon).
  Moreover you could choose the quantity of blitter or cpu work using the percentage value you find
after this flag in the ConfigFile.
  This indicates how blit in height size will done by Blitter. No gfx data will be allocated in
fast mem.
  If you set this to zero will be used the 3) method, else if 100 the 2) method. In all others
circumstances  will be used this method. Try to find the best report between cpu and blitter usage.
  Remember that this method could not be used if you use graphic board's screens, in that case the
game will be redirected the the 1) method.




Important notes
---------------

  When you select the 2) or 3) method and you choose to play on a graphic board's screen you must be
careful if you choose a screen mode bigger than the area used in the ConfigFile. For example a
320x256 ConfigFile used on a 640x480 graphic board's screen.
  In this case you will surely get a lot of imperfections on screen, so be very careful using
this.
  If the screen mode is smaller you will not get any troubles, for example using a 640*512
ConfigFile on a 320x240 graphic board's screen, because you will be able to scroll by mouse the
screen.
  The same above effect not appears in any way using the standard amiga screens when you use both a
bigger screen mode and a smaller one.
  Remember that if you play game in window (also in a PIP) will be always used the AmigaOS graphic
functions.
  BltMaskBitMapRastPort() is a very complex functions to optimize, and is not possible to write one
by using only one blitter operation. AmigaOs does this blit by a number of sub blitter operations
equal to the height of blit.
  For this reason BltMaskBitMapRastPort() was not cloned and in the 2) method uses the AmigaOs
routine. In all cpu functions it was well cloned.
  Finally consider that if you play game in a screen some functions that blit in rastports will be
redirect to blit in bitmaps. This because graphic functions calls in rastports are slower than in
bitmaps and are usefull only when you use screens with windows.
  Moreover were cloned also BitMapScale(), AllocBitMap() and FreeBitMap() forcing them to manage
data in fast mem (public mem) ever when you play with the 3) method.
  The BitMapScale() clone has a lower quality in comparison with the Os one.



Redirection of graphic functions.
--------------------------------

BltBitMap()             --->  BltBitMap()
BltBitMapRastPort()     --->  BltBitMap()
ClipBlit()              --->  BltBitMap()
BltClear()              --->  BltClear()
BltMaskBitMapRastPort() --->  BltMaskBitMapRastPort()



List of cloned graphic functions and percentage of usage in game.


percentage of usage (based on: a_function_call/all_function_calls )*
-------------------------------------------------------------------

function			     on window	 on screen

BltBitMap()              50%         68%
BltBitMapRastPort()      14%         0%
ClipBlit()               4%          0%
BltClear()               2%          2%
BltMaskBitMapRastPort()	 30%	     30%



cloned using CPU
----------------

BltBitMap()
BltBitMapRastPort()
ClipBlit()
BltClear()
BltMaskBitMapRastPort()



cloned using BLITTER
--------------------

BltBitMap()		*
BltBitMapRastPort()	*
ClipBlit()		*



* a "call" is a graphic function call in the source code.

* These functions are quite faster than AmigaOs corrispettives. The only advantages are:
Functions were written in fast assembler and they are very speed in initializating blitter chip
and during blitting they don't control blit limits and rastport's layers re-building
(this last only when using BltBitMapRastPort() ).

@node MAIN_BOOT "PuzzleBOBS guide - First boot"

Important notes about PuzzleBOBS's first boot
---------------------------------------------


  Before executing PuzzleBOBS is important to speak about some concepts of the
game's boot phase.

  PuzzleBOBS to be configured needs of some ASCII files which are written
respecting some conventions to became compatibles with the game.
  For this reason these files may be edited manually, but this must be considered
a careful procedure because they can be altered and became not compatibles
with PuzzleBOBS.
  For this reason could be better read the @{" Configuration files " link MAIN_CONF} page which
explains deeply how modify a file as them.
  In PuzzleBOBS we have the "ConfigFileBase" which has to stay in the same
directory of the executable, (which is assigned to PuzzleBOBS: at the boot), a
file which contains all informations about your personal settings.
  This file during the first boot doesn't exist there, so PuzzleBOBS will open a
file requester by which you will be able to take the one localized in your language.
  After your choice will be renamed as "ConfigFileBase" and copied in PuzzleBOBS:
directory. To change language simply delete the PuzzleBOBS:ConfigFileBase and start
again the game.
  An other Configuration File is the "ConfigFile" which contains informations
about the graphic's look of game, the paths of gfx data and a lot of more low
level settings.
  Finally we have the Audio Configuration files in which there are the samples
path's strings and the Artificial Intelligence files which defines a non human
player.
  These files, the ConfigFile, the Audio Configuration, and the Artificial
Intelligence files can be replaced with others to change the game's look and
behaviour.
  At boot PuzzleBOBS uses the ConfigFileBase which is setted to load a ConfigFile
and an Audio ConfigFile standard.
  A ConfigFile, for convention has not a ScreenMode id written yet, it has only the
information of size of its, as its width, height and depth.
  A ConfigFile as this, has a -1 in place of the id, this force PuzzleBOBS to open
a ScreenMode Requester at boot, by which you will be able to pick the right one
(on the title you can find the Width, Height and depth values needed).
  At this point the game will start and will show the game's main menu, but is
important to say that the ScreenMode choosed by the requester is not saved yet,
for this reason you have to go to the @{" Configure " LINK i_configgame} subpage and select @{" Save config " LINK i_saveconfig}.
  The last important info is about the graphic optimizing subsystem.
  Because the principal prerogative in PuzzleBOBS's developing was to give the
maximum freedom to the user in configuring the game, is possible to pick up
setting which could improve game's performances on all setups, but in the same
time cause some problems to the graphic output.
  For this reason the default option in all ConfigFiles, about the blitting mode is
setted to "Use OS", which is the most compatible because uses the os library
functions.
  This could be acceptable when having graphic accelerators, but less when using
the Amiga custom hardware.
  For this reason the game has a built-in subsystem which is able to use the main
CPU as unique graphic operator, instead using the custom Blitter chip, exploiting
whenever is possible fast memory (public memory) instead of chip memory.
  On standard Amiga's screens modes the system works properly and increases a lot
the speed of all the graphical operations, while on system with graphic boards
may cause some problems.
  These are rare but because there are too many systems and setups, was been
preferable to disable that option in all ConfigFiles to save the first bootfase.
  However if PuzzleBOBS would compromise the graphics, remember that to exit from
game during the menu stage you can press the "Del" key, and is ever possible
during all boot phases and all reconfiguring phases, press the left shift (LSHIFT)
to get a ScreenMode Requester.
  When you ask a ScreenMode Requester, PuzzleBOBS disables the optimizing subsystem,
setting the "Blit mode" to "Use OS" automatically.
 To qualify again the susbsytem is sufficent select again the "Blit mode" in the
menu's "Configure" sub page.
 In the same way is possible to change the ConfigFile pressing the right shift
(RSHIFT), getting thus a FileRequester.
 I advice you to read the page @{" Graphic procedures " LINK MAIN_GFXF} which explains deeply all
the incompabilities and problems about the graphic subsystem.

@node MAIN_FAQS "PuzzleBOBS guide - Faqs"

  Some problems you may have during the first execution of game.


1) The game is graphically slow:
--------------------------------
  The game during the first boot phase has all the optimizing systems disabled.
  To activate them you have to use the menu option @{" Blit mode " LINK i_blitmode} in the menu
subpage @{" Configure " LINK i_configgame}.
  On hardware standard the best is "Blit mode = Cpu fast", on graphic boards "Blit mode = Use OS".
  To save the change use @{" Menu/Configure/Save config " LINK i_saveconfig}, to see its in action
use @{" Menu/Configure/Reload config " LINK i_reloadconfig}.
  You can find other optimizing options in the menu subpage @{" Other " LINK i_more}.
  Read the pages @{" Graphic procedures " LINK MAIN_GFXF} and @{" First boot " link MAIN_BOOT}.


2) During the game i see the mouse pointer:
-------------------------------------------
  Enter in the menu subpage @{" Misc " LINK i_misc}, and set to OFF the voice "Pointer".


3) During the game i have only one background:
----------------------------------------------
  Enter in the menu subpage @{" Misc " LINK i_misc}, and set to "Sequence" the voice "ExtraData".
  Read the MenuOptions document.


4) At each boot i get the ScreenMode Requester:
-----------------------------------------------
  You have to save the id of screen you are using in the ConfigFile, so after
you choosed the screen mode, and if it works, enter in the Configure menu sub page
and use @{" Menu/Configure/Save config " LINK i_saveconfig}. Read the page @{" First boot " link MAIN_BOOT} also.


5) During menu, the asl requesters modified the background:
-----------------------------------------------------------
  This is due to a strange problem not fixed yet, which appears on some setups.
  Use the option @{" Menu/Misc/Asl reqs " LINK i_aslrequester} setting its to "Asl reqs = Open out"


6) How can i do a screen grab without the level crypting and the pause?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  You can press F9, you will get a grab in ram: . Read the @{" Function keys " link MAIN_KEY} page.

@node MAIN_ERRS "PuzzleBOBS guide - Error codes"


PuzzleBOBS errors codes
------------------------

  There are brought all PuzzleBOBS own error codes.
  You can find an explanation of the error occurs, the event which usually cause the error, and an
advice to solve its. There are some error codes used during the developing phase, now they should
not work, however they were maintained.
  An error request could show error messages in a form unlike the one you find here, however the
code and the error type is ever the same.


Errors codes list.


1)  Not enought FAST mem
    --------------------
    The fast mem is finished, Try to close some other apps in execution.


2)  Not enought CHIP mem
    --------------------
    The chip mem is finished, Try to close some other apps in execution.


3)  Not enought PUBLIC mem
    ----------------------
    The public (chip or fast) mem is finished, Try to close some other apps in execution.


4)  Error opening
    -------------
    An error which occurs during a file opening. Probably its name or path is wrong.


5)  Error opening a Screen
    ----------------------
    An error which occurs during a screen opening. Probably the video memory is finished so try to
    close some other qapps wich uses video mem.
    Is also possible that the screen mode id field in ConfigFile is wrong. So restart the game
    keeping the left shift key (LSHIFT) pressed. You will get a screen mode requester.
    Read the "First boot" page.


6)  Error reading
    -------------
    An error which occurs during a file reading. Probably it is used by an other apps or it was not
    well closed.


7)  Error opening the device ->
    ---------------------------
