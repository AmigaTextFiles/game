FuzzBall Demo
=============

Hello everybody. Here is the fuzzball demo featured on the front of
"Amiga Games" March issue.

The only change I have made is to rename the disk file "2" to filename
"FuzzBall-Demo", to clarify the program name situation. My apologies to
the System 3 guys for this. I hope you will understand.

The icon is mine, and was included as a joke. It's for use by those of
you who want to run Fuzzball from the Workbench.

Greetings to everyone "Stay happy". Also to U4ia, Wild-Child!, Chris
Dolphin and , dare I say it, Fox.

WARNING
=======

There's a guy floating around the net with the handle of "Lorry". His
real name is Michael Lawrie. If you have contact with him, then be
careful. He has caused a lot of BBs's to go out of business, and a lot
of people heart-ache!!!

Once more, take care!
