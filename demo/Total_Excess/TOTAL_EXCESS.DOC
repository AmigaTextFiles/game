                          I. GENERAL INFORMATION
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 T O T A L  E X C E S S  is my third game programmed with AMOS Basic and my
first shootemup game for the AMIGA( I hope not the last ).It took me almost
a year to complete because 99.99%  of the programming was done by me , with
the outstanding help of myself (!!!!!); in other words ,I was working alone
in this project. The music and the samples were taken from CDPD 1 disk,made
by FRED FISH,while ( most ) of the graphics were made by an AMIGA FREAK who
doesn't like publicity!
 I can't say this game is something special in order to face those «beasts»
- made in assembly - some great programmers release,( like R-TYPE,PROJECT-X
,APIDYA,D-HERO etc ) but it stands by its own and-after all-its pure fun !
It also shows what a  **BASIC** programmer can do with the help of a simple
language like AMOS ( well,almost simple! ) and a small knowledge about his
fabulous computer,like the AMIGA !


                       II.REASONS FOR WRITING THIS GAME
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                 There were three main reasons for doing so:

            1)  I always liked the computers and all the things
               someone could do with them  (graphics etc.) , so
               as soon as I bought my  AMIGA  I could not think
               of an easier way of combining  all  the 'tricky'
               effects  I  could think than creating a demo.But
               since  I did not have any other knowledges apart
               from Basic I gave up.That's when  AMOS came into
               the scene as «a games' creator»
            2)  I just looooove shoot-em-ups,downs,lefts,easts,
               wests etc. etc. etc. so I thought: Hey!!!why not
               make one by myself since I have AMOS?
            3)  Among the huge  family of PC-USERS there were a
               few guys  (idiots!)  who told me once that «only
               their  FLEXIBLE  ( aaaaaarrrrghhh!!!!! ) SYSTEMS
               are capable  of producing software able to stand
               by itself.» -in other words : « HEY ! I've got a
               C-Compiler version 9.569200132 +++++++ for my PC
               but although I don't know how to use it I'm sure
               it's capable of creating some nice programs !!!»
               { Well guys, this game is made with BASIC and it
               is dedicated (partly) to you }
                 ( Please DO NOT misunderstand me ! I am not an
               enemy of these excellent languages. But I DO NOT
               LIKE those people who  KNOW NOTHING  about their
               computers and keep saying that they own  a  true
               ( ha! ha! ha! )  multitasking  computer with the
               latest version of DOORS XP and WINDOWS MC.)


                   III. DONATIONS ( or: NO PAY'N' NO GAIN )
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 This demo-version of  T O T A L  E X C E S S ®  is a SHAREWARE / FREEWARE
program(see `FREELY DISTRIBUTABLE'),which simply means:
                   1. Play it (you'll like it!!!)
                   2. Play it again!!!
                   3. Re-Play it!!!(sounds boring!)
                   4. Think : "Do I like it?" (I hope yes!)
                   5. If you do like it then...
...I would appreciate it if you send me some money for it (in fact I would
appreciate anything:money,money,money,money or even money!!!). Cars,boats,
planes,computers would be appreciated too,but.....please don't send me any
PCs because I'm gonna turn them into pieces ! Also note that when you send
me some money you will become a REGISTERED USER ( see `REGISTRATION' ) and
you'll have the source code ABSOLUTELY FREE . ( a real must for -ALL- AMOS
coders )

                 IV. SOME WORDS ABOUT THE FULL GAME
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 TOTAL EXCESS ® is a horizontal right-to-left shoot-em-up. It was entirely
made with AMOS and special programing technics have been used to make this
game really stand out of the crowd . Speed and colours are some of its own
characteristics as well as special effects only seen in programs made with
assembly ( till now ! ) . This demo - and the full game of course - uses a
large mixture of AMOS and AMAL instructions.You can admire the results !
  This demo is a single-stage demo of the original game with most of its
features disabled . The full game has five stages , selection for in-game
music or sound effects , hi-score table with 50 ( yes,fifty ! ) names and
ability of saving these scores when quiting game , as well as a very fast
bonus section similar to that found in ProjectX . Not to mention that the
full game is Hard-Disk installable too !  [ Coders will realise that this
game is an excellent example of structured programming! Over 100 ( that's
right , one hundred! ) procedures are awaiting you ! ]

                        HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME
                       ***********************
  It's very simple.Just shoot everything that moves using your fire-button
and avoid any "unnecessary meetings" by moving your ship  around with your
joystick. If you hold down the fire-button,your ship will store energy and
when you release it ( the button,not the ship !) an ultramegasuperblasting
( etc,etc,etc ) beam will be released , causing the destruction of most of
your enemies which will meet,or apparently causing them a great damage.You
will understand if one of the enemy spacecraft has received a great damage
by its flash when it encounters your firings.WARNING!WARNING! Some of your
enemies are tough guys and will require too many shots to be destoyed.Some
others need to be shot ONLY with the super beam in order to be destroyed.
If you are shot by an enemy ship  or collide with it then you will loose a
life,( a maximum of five lives are given in this demo ) and after that you
will be invurnerable to the enemies for a limited period of time. The full
version gives you the ability to use a limited number of shields, but this
option has been disabled from the demo . Your hiscore update on the screen
has been disabled too , as well as some other features which you will find
when you register and get the full game.
 During the game you may quit by just pressing the ESCAPE button.


              V. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS  &  GENERAL INSTALL
              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 T O T A L   E X C E S S ®  will run on all Amigas fitted with at least 1Mb
of memory. If you own such a system and find out that the game doesn't load
then you must switch off the AMIGA and disable  ALL EXTERNAL DEVICES as the
game requires 500-650 KBytes free memory.The game has been tested and works
fine on the following machines:

                   A500      (0.5 MB CHIP + 0.5 MB FAST)
                   A500+     (2 MB CHIP)
                   CDTV      (1 MB CHIP)
                   A1200     (2 MB CHIP)
                   A1200     (2 MB CHIP + 4 MB FAST)
                   A2000     (1 MB CHIP)
                   A4000/30  (2 MB CHIP + 2 MB FAST)
                   A4000/40  (2 MB CHIP + 4 MB FAST)

                           INSTALLATION
                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  In order to make a bootable floppy disk with this demo you should follow
these steps :

a) Format a blank disk as "TE:"( or any other name that doesn't start with
   "DF" as this may confuse the program )
b) Create two directories: one named "LIBS" and one named "S"
c) Copy diskfont.library,icon.library and mathtrans.library in the "LIBS"
   directory.
d) Create a script file named "Startup-Sequence" and save it in the "S"
   directory.This file should have as contents the name of the game eg.:

        T_E

e) use the INSTALL command of your Workbench Disk in order to make your new
   disk bootable


 If you are the happy owner of an AMIGA with HARD-DISK then you can run the
game from the Hard-Disk too. Just copy ALL the files contained in the disk,
in the drawer you like.
 I don't know if the program may be installed on the Hard-Disk  of a system
equipped with 0.5 MB FAST & 0.5 MB CHIP memory only.The Hard-Disk consumes
around 200K of memory from the AMIGA,so if that memory is CHIP memory then
the game won't be able to allocate the memory it needs.( around 300 K CHIP
memory )
 It is very easy to run the demo:Just double-click its icon from the WB,or
type "TOTAL_EXCESS" from the CLI, AFTER HAVING CDed IN THE DIRECTORY WHERE
THE GAME AND ITS FILES LIE.


                        VI. SOME APOLOGIES
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        I would like to clear out some things about this game:
  When I first sat down to make this game,I had in mind a simple game
that would run even on 512K Amigas.However as long as the development
was advancing , I kept adding more features to the game - a fact that
had as result the need for more memory . The game in it's final form
requires 1MB of memory to run.
  However the adding of more features resulted in the loss of speed
and the decrease in the numbers of frames/sec ingame.
  Yes , I know this isn't a big problem - you can still play the game
on a simple Amiga A500 with around 20 frames/sec . In order to make
happy the AGA users , I have added more levels of scrolling inside
the game - however the speed has been slown down because when I tried
to play the game on an A1200 , it was more difficult because it was
running at 30-50 frames/sec!
  You might be wondering : "- Why not faster?".The answer is that the
game is being slown down by some HEAVY bitmap operations - even on
AGA machines.That proves that the AGA chipset isn't very fast compared
to the OCS chipset . TIME FOR THE AAA ADD-ON FOR THE A1200 MAYBE???
  Also-as it was very soon revealed to me after many tests-the use of
math functions ( eg MATHTRANS.library ) by AMOS programs slows down a
program , especially when too many conditions and checks are met.
  I have optimised the code and thus eliminated this problem and as a
result my future games will be FASTER by a factor of about 20%.( Sorry
but I just didn't have enough much time to modify this game ) By the
time I was finishing these lines (around February of 1995) I had also
completed the development of some new routines that give :
- 30 frames/sec on an A500!
- new improved copper routines
- 4 colour background with independent movement from the foreground
screen and all that in -guess- an A500!!!
  So expect from now the sequel to TOTAL EXCESS . I am waiting for
the official release of an AGA extension for AMOS and then.....
.....but in the meantime don't forget to register for this game.
  I really did spend a HUGE AMOUNT OF EFFORTS AND TIME in making the
game and my decision to continue the support of the Amiga and the
Amos language with new programs/games will depend entirely on your
support and appreciation of my efforts.

                      VII. WORDS OF « WISDOM »
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If we wish ourselves to face the facts then we MUST have in mind these:

       ( 1 ) Good games and/or programs DO NOT MAGICALLY
             APPEAR !

       ( 2 ) Paying for a  shareware  means appreciation
             for the efforts of the creator and creation
             of a strong backbone for the support of the
             good Amiga software.

       ( 3 )  I understand that most of you have spent a
             HUGE AMOUNT  of money for original software
             and now regret it , but the difference with
             freeware/shareware is that you get back -in
             various ways- what you give.In simple words
             by becoming a *registered* user you get the
             source code , a  significant cut-off in ALL
             FUTURE RELEASES,updated future versions for
             free and all that by paying less money than
             you would do for buying this game original.
             Not to  mention  the  chance you have to be
             programmers by yourselves !

       ( 4 ) The  AMIGA PD/SHAREWARE/FREEWARE area is an
             area of programming wealth ! You may find
             EVERYTHING and at the RIGHT cost . YOU JUST
             HAVE TO REGISTER ! Many programs are great
             even compared to the commercial ones !

       ( 5 )  If you think that this program is very big
             then you are wrong ! It could be bigger !!!
             Much bigger !!!!!! Unfortunately there were
             some reasons for not making it bigger :
             ¹) The fact that I was working alone in the
                programming area.
             ²) The absence of memory ! Isn't it silly ?
                We are in the mid-90s and only 2MB are
                considered to be base-memory in AGA mchs
                not to mention the OCS ones ! Well I've
                got only 1MB ! (while some other systems
                require some 8 MBs of memory and 100s of
                free hard-disk space in order to run an
                application via their archaic DOS!)
             ³) I am keeping some nice ideas for my next
                release ( AGA & full 4 MB support ? Well
                who knows ?!? )

       ( 6 ) Long live the AMIGA ( hurays,screams etc. ) !

       ( 7 ) A Nice Message ( you know for whom ):

                 You came in PeaCe...
                        ...but you'll leave in PIECES.

             " Hasta la Vista...Baby ! "
                            [ Arnold Swarzenegger in T2 ]

       ( 9 ) Congratulations  to  all the people behind the
             demo and hacking scene . Well,without them our
             beloved computer would  not have the abilities
             and the glory it has now !  Congratulations to
             FRANCOIS  LIONET  for making this amazing type
             of language .  My game is partly  dedicated to
             him . Also  congratulations to all independent
             programmers  who release their programs in the
             PD scene ! What a pitty I can't even see most
             of these progs since I own WB 1.3 !

   Thank you for the time you spent reading this doc...And remember :

          There is only one computer better than an AMIGA...
                    ...and that is another AMIGA.
