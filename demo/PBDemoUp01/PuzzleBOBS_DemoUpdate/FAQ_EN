PuzzleBOBS - Faqs (28.12.2001)
------------------------------

Version 1.0



Questions:  At boot PuzzleBOBS has not enought video mem to start. What can i do?

Answer:     PuzzleBOBS uses video mem depending on the resolution of the configuration
            file you are using. The amount of mem can be very large, so at boot (while you
            double-click the icon)  try to press the right shift (RSHIFT). This will let you
            to choose a configuration file with low resolutions. Try a 320x256x8 or 320x256x6.
            If you have a good processor and some FAST MEM you can enable the CPU
            FAST option about the blitting. This allocs only the screen's mem, the rest is
            allocated in pseudo-bitmaps in public mem (if you have not fast this option is
            useless). You have to go in menu/config_game, toggle "blit_mode" to CPU FAST.
            Then "saveconfig" at the bottom of the page and use "reload". If you can not see
            the menu use a text editor and open a configuration file you find in
            PuzzleBOBS:configs (are ascii files). Then go to the line 11 and put a "3" as
            value, this enable the CPUFAST drawing method. Bottom the line, you see a "0"
            which enables the AMIGAOS drawing functions. The guide in PuzzleBOBS/docs
            explains deeply this options.
            0 ;FLAG (0-4) Here you can choose the mode of blitting. See the docs to choose
            method you want.

Questions: I modified the options in menu/config_game but i don't obtain nothing
           (as the window options), why?

Answer:    When you change the option in that page is important you use
           menu/config_game/saveconfig voice at the bottom of the page. Saving you alter
           the ascii configfile in PuzzleBOBS:configs, then the game will reinit itself
           reading again the modified file. To reinit use the
           menu/config_game/reload_config voice.


Questions: The PIP option does not work, why ?

Answer:   Be sure you read the previous question. Then be sure you have a PicassoIV
          graphic board, because is the only board which supports the PIP windows.


Questions: The game say me it can not open a window, what's happened?

Answer:    Have you enought video mem? If yes be sure the screen you are using has the
           same depth format of the configuration file you want. If the config has the gfx
           data at 16bits depth you need a screen in 16 bit depth. The config's name
           extension point to its depth, x8 means 8bits (256 colours), x16 16bits (65535
           colours).


Questions: I picked a wrong screenmode and the game chrashed.

Answer:    Thanks for the bug report, it is just fixxed, the next releases will have not
           this problem.
