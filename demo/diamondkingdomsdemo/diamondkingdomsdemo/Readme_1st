DIAMOND KINGDOMS - playable demo

© 2005 Alternate Realities

Hello. Doubtless this game caught your attention and now you're wondering
what the hell this is. It's a no-holds-barred mega-violent FPS with ultra-
realistic graphics, ten billion polygons per character, a 93-player online
mode and... oh, hang on, that's the wrong game. Sorry. This is, in fact, a
cute platform game (with really, erm, 'interesting' graphics). And this is
a one-level demo. Of it.

Anyway, before your excitement gets the better of you, and you play this game
without reading these instructions (everyone reads the instructions, right
kids?) I better tell you how to get the game up and running. Well, if you're
running this from the fun-packed floppy disk it originally came on, then just
double-click on the game's icon and you're away. If you want to play it from
a hard drive, then copy all the game's files to a directory on your drive, and
copy the files in the 'Fonts' and 'Libs' drawers into the respective
directories on your hard drive. Then double-click on the game's icon and
bingo! Instant fun.

Also bear in mind the game requires 1MB of RAM to run.

Right, now on to the game. The aim is to collect all the diamonds on a level.
The amount left to collect is shown in a panel at the top of the screen,
along with the amount of coins left, your lives, health, score and the current
level. As soon as you've collected the last diamond, the level ends.

In the full game, if you collect all the coins, you will be rewarded with a
random bonus at the end of the level. However this doesn't happen in the demo
so you only recieve points when you collect them.

There are various other items on the level, but it's not too hard to figure
out what they do. If you hit an enemy, you lose a point of health. Lose all
your health and - guess what? You lose a life, shockingly enough. Also spikes
kill you instantly, even if you're invincible.

And you may want to know the controls:

Joystick left (or left arrow) - move left.
Joystick right (or right arrow) - Pretty obvious, isn't it?
Fire (or space bar) - blow up the computer.... er, sorry, that should read
'jump'. How careless of me.

In-game keys:

P- pause
Esc - quits game (but why would you want to do that?)

Right, that should be enough to get you going. Bye.

NO, HANG ON. WHAT'S IN THE FULL GAME THEN?
------------------------------------------

Ah yes, nearly forgot about that. Here's what you can expect in the real
thing:

- 10 big levels spread over 5 worlds (up to 32 screens per level)
- Load and save highscores, and you can also save your progress
- Choose between in-game music or sound effects
- Secret rooms
- Hard drive installable
- Detects and utilises the AGA chipset - graduated colours in the background
  and smoother fades.

Please note that the full game requires Kickstart 2 at least to run. This
is because, bizzarely, saved games won't load on 1.2/1.3 machines, and I
can't for the life of me work out why. Sorry! (There's nothing stopping you
from playing the game from scratch every time, though...)

Anyway, it's getting late. It's time I was off...

NO, WAIT! COME BACK! WHERE CAN I GET THE FULL GAME FROM?
--------------------------------------------------------

Glad you asked. Try keeping an eye on www.cronosoft.co.uk for details.
Can you wait for the finished game?

ERM, YES I CAN, ACTUALLY.
-------------------------

Oh. Well, if that's how you feel. I'm off. And I'm not coming back.

I WAS ONLY JOKING! LIGHTEN UP, WILL YOU? ANYWAY, WHO'S BEHIND THIS (AHEM)
EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF PROGRAMMING?
-----------------------------------

You really want to know? Here goes...

Programming, level design and most graphics - Graham Humphrey
And because he insists he gets a mention... Playtesting - Graham and Simon
Humphrey (sigh)
Music - taken from Public Domain

The graphics for the fruit were taken from a graphics disk, and the enemy
graphics were taken from an old Public Domain game called FaYoh, written
by Marcus Johansson.The rest of the graphics are by me. Which explains a lot.

If you want to contact me for any reason, about this game, or perhaps any
ideas for future projects, then e-mail me!

Also, I'm looking for musicians and, er, sound effects-ians for my next
project. If you're interested, get in touch.

PHEW! IS THAT IT?
-----------------

Yep, definitely. Enjoy the game!
