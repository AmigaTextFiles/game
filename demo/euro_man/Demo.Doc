----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. MANAGING A TEAM

The first thing you should do is have a look at your team and then goto the
transfer market. Are there any players you can buy?

Try to avoid buying players from higher divisions. They will only cost you
in the long run by having high wages. Keep looking and you will probably get
a good player from your own division at a reasonable price.

Once you are happy with the squad of players you have put them on training.
Each player can train on different skills. Keep an eye on which training
works. Different methods can work on different players though.

Also before each game you should have a look at the opponents details.
Try and cancel out their strengths and exploit their weakness.
The key to having a successfull team is balance. There is no point in
having a brilliant attack while your defence is total mince. Same applies
if you have a cast iron defence and don`t lose too many goals, if you don`t
have good strikers you won`t win many games.

Keeping an eye on your finances is a good idea. If you seem to be losing
money try selling a few players, if you have a big squad, to reduce the wage
bill. Experiment with the ticket prices and see which prices the punters are
willing to pay. Increasing the capacity of your stadium shouldn`t be a
priority until you have reached the first division as by then you will
be almost filling your stadium, depending on how good your team is.
Watch how much money you lose when you play away and how much you gain when
at home. If your losing more than you gain, your in trouble from the boss!

Your attendance at each match depends on how well your team is doing in the
league. If your winning most games your gates will steadily increase.
Should you chance increasing the ticket prices?
But, if your losing a lot of games the fans won`t want to come and watch.
Should you then decrease the price of tickets in an attemp to woo the fans?
The choice is yours.

If you have been drawn against a good side in the cup, don`t worry too much.
You should make a decent amount of cash from the game even if you do lose.
But, usually teams play differently during a cup match.
Is it the romance or excitement the cup brings, or the lure of cash?
Whatever, there is a good chance of beating a better team so get your tactics
right and you won`t go far wrong. On the other hand you will probably get
thrashed about 6-0. That won`t please the boss!

Lastly, keep looking for players. Theres always room for improvement and
thats a good thing. It improves the team, you win more games, the gates go up,
you make more money, you buy better players improving the team again etc...
Its a vicious circle but highly enjoyable. Especially when you thrash your
nearest rivals in a top of the league clash!
Also, it`s a good idea to have a few spare players in case of injury or
suspension.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. END OF SEASON

Once all games have been played and trophies won or lost the season ends.

The league works on a one up-one down basis. The winners of each league get
promoted, except the winners of the Premier. The teams who finish bottom of
the league get relegated, except the losers in the Third Division.

At the seasons end, you will be shown the final league table. Selecting EXIT
will take you to the honours list.

This screen displays the winners of the FA Cup, the League cup and all the
leagues. Also shown are the teams who are relegated.

When the next season begins your players ability may be different so have
a look and swing that axe if you must. You never know it may just be whats
needed to bring success back to your club.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. EDITOR

You can load your saved data into the editor and change your team name,
stadium and the names of the stands.

Once you load the editor you have to load your saved data. The data will
be displayed on the screen.
