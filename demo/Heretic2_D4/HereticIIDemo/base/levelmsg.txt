;OBJECTIVES
;
The Harbormaster has informed me of a mind-altering plague that has infected my people.  Their madness makes them attack anyone in sight.  He also spoke of a cure found by a Ssithra healer in the nearby city of Andoria.  In order for me to retrieve the cure from Andoria, $I must make my way to the palace and defeat our village leader, the Celestial Watcher.%  Dranor said that the Watcher is insane by the plague and has used his magic to seal everyone inside the city.

; DRANOR
Go!  Or suffer the same... You...@you are Corvus?  Forgive me.
You know of me?
The slayer of D'sparil.@A hero's tale travels far.
Who are you?  What has happened --@to Silverspring, and our people?
I was once the Harbormaster.@I am Dranor.  The people -- they hide.@At least those who've been spared.
Spared?
From the plague.  The infected --@they are consumed by insanity.@They attack anyone in sight.@Thousands have died.
But you -- you can save us once again.@There's talk that a Ssithra healer has@found a cure...across the swamps@in Andoria.  You must go there.
It is not my destiny to be a hero.
The lands of Parthoris are battlefields!@Soon we will join the infected@or die at their feet!@You must go to Andoria- you must.
But first...you'll have to break@free from the city.
The Celestial Watcher has used magic to@seal everyone inside and secure himself@in the palace.  Crush him -- and@you can cross the swamps to the cure.
Stay, and we'll suffer a fate@worse than the Serpent Rider.
I will go.@Parthoris will not be taken again.
Corvus, be warned.  The lands are@filled with those who spread the@plague.  They carry globes that contain@ the deadly mist...
