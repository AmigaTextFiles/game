@NODE EDIT "Edit Palette"
The edit palette displays useful information about the current edit operation.
This includes things like the length and angle of a wall etc. or the current map
position.
@ENDNODE


@NODE GRPH "Graphics Palette"
The graphics palette provides a representation of the currently selected graphic
in the texture palette, or on one of the edit panels. The display is not a true
representation of the original because it remaps a 256 colour image into the
number of colours the editors @{"screen mode" link DentEd:Help/Settings.Menu/SCRN} has available.
Therefore the more colours the editors screen has, the closer it looks to the
original graphic. Of course there has to be a trade of for this, and the main
one is speed of operation and also increased memory consumption.

@NODE TEXT "Texture Palette"
The texture palette is the basis of all editing, the current edit mode (i.e.
walls, doors, objects) depicts what type of graphics are available and these
are displayed as a list of names in the palette. By hi-lighting a name and then
adding say a wall, the newly created wall is given the hi-lighted graphic as
it's basic image.

Some edit mode types support many types of graphics. For example walls can have
textures, patterns, windows or animations (not implemented see @{"Limitations" link DentEd:Help/DentEd.guide/LIMT})
whilst others like objects only have objects as graphics. You can switch between
these different graphic types using the T|P|W|A buttons located at the top of
the palette. Non-applicable buttons will be disabled if they have no relevance
to the current edit mode type.
