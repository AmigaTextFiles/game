@NODE WALL "Wall Editor"
The wall editor allows individual parameters of a wall to be modified. Editing
is done in two or more windows, there's the information window that specifies
the walls basic type information, the textures/patterns window that allows
the walls graphics to be modified, and sometimes an another window which contains
extra features for a particular window type.

Available window types are:

    @{B}Wall@{UB}              - A basic textured wall, can use textures or
                        a smaller repeated pattern.
    @{B}Window@{UB}            - This wall has 'see through' graphics, this mode
                        only be accessed when the wall is created by using a
                        window graphic. If any other type is used you will
                        not be allowed to access this option. They only way
                        to change a wall to a window is to delete the current
                        one and create a window wall from scratch.
    @{B}Animated@{UB}          - Wall graphic is a sequence of frames (Not
                        Currently Implemented).
    @{B}Switch@{UB}            - Allows wall to act like a switch (Not Currently
                        Implemented).
    @{B}Scrollable@{UB}        - The texture will animate by shifting at the
                        desired speed.
    @{B}Multiple Patterns@{UB} - Uses 4 different patterns to create a texture.


@{B}Segment Line@{UB} - This allows a longer wall to be divided up into 64 wide
sections. You are able to define each section as being a different type, or just
different graphics. Use the Segment button to choose the segment you wish to
edit. If the wall is already segmented this button can also set it back to a
single segment. There is a maximum of 8 segments to a wall if it is long enough.

@{B}Segment@{UB} - If the wall is a segmented wall, this button allows you to
cycle through the available segments.

@{B}Map Colour@{UB} - Not implemented, ignore for now.

@{B}MiscA@{UB} \ Please leave these alone! These are for testing purposes ONLY!
@{B}MiscB@{UB} / If you use these you map may NOT work properly in the future!!

@NODE DOOR "Door Editor"
@REM Known problems! CANT CHANGE TYPE!
@REM SoundFx options are not implemented yet.
    Some of the door parameters work others currently do not, we would recommend
not editing door parameters until a later date when the more useful options
are implemented, e.g. animations and links.

    @{B}You can however change the doors graphics!@{UB}
@ENDNODE


@NODE FOBJ "Fixed Object Editor"
    Only use this to change the objects graphics, the rest of the options
are unimplemented at present.
@ENDNODE


@NODE PLYR "Player Start Editor"
@{B}IMPORTANT!@{UB}
    You must edit this information and supply a valid floor/ceiling or floor/
background combination before attempting to test the map. Results will otherwise
be unpredictable. It is also advisable to use the @{"Modes/Set Player" link DentEd:Help/Modes.menu/SPLY} option to
move the players start position from the top/left map position to avoid running off
the edge of the map.


@{B}Misc1@{UB} \ Please leave these alone! These are for testing purposes ONLY!
@{B}Misc2@{UB} / If you use these you map may NOT work properly in the future!!

    Notes:
        SoundFx options are not implemented yet.
