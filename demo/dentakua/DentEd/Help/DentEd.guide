@NODE INST "Installation"

Installation
************

    Use the installation script provided to install the software on your
harddisk.

    The editor REQUIRES one assign to get the whole thing running, which
should be added to your User-startup or Startup-sequence if the installation
reports that the action was not possible.

The assign should be:

Assign DentEd: <name of the drive you installed it to>:DentEd

@{B}NOTE:@{UB} do not type the '<' '>', simply replace this section with the name of
the drive you installed the software too.

    The last thing you need to do is copy your keyfile to the DentEd:Silltunna/
drawer and all should be well.
@ENDNODE


@NODE REQM "System Requirements"

System Requirements
*******************

    DentEd requires an AGA compatible machine running at least V3.0+ of the
operation system software. It should run in a minimum of 2 megabytes of chip
memory but would work much better with extra fast memory. A harddisk drive
is pretty essential as the graphic files are currently quite big. It will 
NOT run AT ALL without at least a 68020 processor.

    The Editor has been developed on a 10MB Amiga 4000/030 running at 25mHZ.
@ENDNODE


@NODE OVER "Overview"

Overview
********

    The editor sticks as closely to the standard Amiga style guide as possible
so that anyone with a little experience of Amiga computers should be able to
pick up and use the editor pretty quickly. One thing that should be mentioned
is that because the right mouse button is used for other operations, it will
not always pull down the menu options. If you find you cannot access the menu
bar, simply move the mouse to the top of the screen and then press the right
button and the menus will pull down.

    The whole editor revolves around the map display. Quite simply the is a two
dimensional, overhead view of a plan or map. Various @{B}items@{UB} can be
added to this map. Currently available items are Walls, Doors and Fixed Objects.


    @{B}Walls@{UB}
        These are just a bit self explanatory and I can't think of what to say!

    @{B}Doors@{UB}
         These are like walls but can be triggered by the player or switches
         to reveal a passthrough to another room or corridor.

    @{B}Fixed Objects@{UB}
        These are stationary graphics that can be animated and destroyed (though
        not currently!). For example Barrels, Columns, Trees etc.


    You can manipulate these items with a host of editing functions such as add,
delete, edit, move, drag etc.

    There are a couple of limitations that the map system has that you will
need to no. The map is made up of 'Game Grids' these simply are an area of the
map 64 * 64 pixels in size. These are shown in the editor as dark grey boxes.

    Through each game grid no more than eight walls or doors or both can pass.
Objects and other options available later have no limitations on amounts
other than memory permitted by the actual game.


Include Files
*************

    All graphics for the editor are stored in 'Include Files'. These are simply
groups of associated graphics, all bundled together in one files. For example
all the 'Brick' graphics are in the Brick textures file.

    There are currently a few different types of graphics, these are:

        @{B}Textures@{UB}             - Single frames 64 * 64 pixels in size used for
                               walls, switches, doors etc.

        @{B}Patterns@{UB}             - Single frames 16 * 16 pixels in size used for
                               walls.

        @{B}Windows@{UB}              - Single frames 64 * 64 pixels in size with areas
                               that allow things behind it to appear through.
                               Used for walls, doors.

        @{B}Wall/Door Animations@{UB} - Multiple 64 * 64 pixel frames, can be used as
                               animations on walls or animated opening doors.

        @{B}Floors/Ceilings@{UB}      - Single frames 64 * 64 pixels in size, used when
                               floors and ceilings are enabled.

        @{B}Backgrounds@{UB}          - Larger than normal frames and can be used as a
                               backdrop.

        @{B}Fixed Objects@{UB}        - Single frame or animated, complete with
                               destruction sequences, variable size.


    You MUST include some files before you start creating you map. You will
need some textures, floors/ceilings and maybe backgrounds before you can create
a working map. It is also a good idea to use the @{"Modes/Set Player" link DentEd:Help/Modes.menu/SPLY} option to
set the players start position away from the top/left edge of the map.

    There are options available within the editor for defining new graphics
but these are NOT available to level designers at present, any graphics you
feel may be useful, please drop @{"Richard" link CONT} a note explaining what you would
like to see.


    @{B}NOTE:@{UB} You MUST use the Define/Player Start option to pick valid
floor/ceiling or floor/background options before you try to test your map!
Failure to do so will result in a corrupt game display or complete
non-functionality. (See @{"Player Start Editor" link DentEd:Help/Editors.guide/PLYR})
@ENDNODE


@NODE LIMT "Limitations"

Limitations
***********

    @{B}NOTE:@{UB} You MUST use the Define/Player Start option to pick valid
floor/ceiling or floor/background options before you try to test your map!
Failure to do so will result in a corrupt game display or complete
non-functionality.


    Currently there are a lot of options in the editor that the test map
routine does not support. These options largely tend to have no effect
if used, so they should not cause any problems, but you may wonder why they
are not doing anything.


@{B}Not Working@{ub}

    Walls
        Animations
        Flicker channel options
        Switches

    Doors
        Animations
        Many of the options 'do nothing'
        Destruction (no weapons to shoot with!)

    Objects
        Animations
        Flicker channel options
        Destruction (no weapons to shoot with!)


    Also NONE of the sound fx options are currently supported.


@{B}Known Problems@{UB}

	Try not to run off the edge of the map use the @{"Modes/Set Player" link DentEd:Help/Modes.menu/SPLY} option to
set the players start position away from the top/left edge of the map.


    Visual quirks - Walls running parallel, very close together, i.e. less than
                    16 pixels often mess up when your close to them.

                    Walls joining at 90 degrees often show through straight walls.

                        |
                        |
                        -------------

                        ^
                        | This edge can be seen

                   Doors jump right by one pixel when opened, and do not join
                   seemlessly to walls, particularly if you are trying to
                   add a hidden door.

    Collision detection - Quirky, you can get through the joins os walls and
                          doors.



    All of these problems are being addressed, updates will be made available
as soon as they are complete.

    If you have any other problems please return a completed @{"bug report" link BUGS} form.
@ENDNODE


@NODE UPDT "Updates"

Updates
*******

    Updates will be uploaded fairly regularly to the Silltunna Support BBS
in the Dentaku-26 conference for downloading by you the level designers.

    Additional information will be available so that you know what is new and
what bugs are fixed.

    These updates will most often be patch files, which will be much smaller
than the original archive you downloaded for this. These patch files will
bring your editor, bang up to date.

    From the 7th May onwards ALL map files will be upwardly compatible, any
changes to the map file structures will be fixed with small utilities that
will become available at the same time as editor updates. If needed, these
utilities will simply scan all your map files and fix them for newer versions
of the editor.

    Please remember you should only save maps to the DentEd:Maps drawer. DO NOT
save map files to other drawers as it is likely to hinder the editor upgrade
process, and therefore if any problems do arise with the map file format, not
all your maps will be converted.
