This is the Xtreme Racing ordering information. A demo of XTR is available
on aminet (game/demo/XTRDemo2.lha). The XTR editor is contained
in the upgrade/CD and is similar in style to the editor presented here, for
Dentaku. Only a lot more stable.

If you don't know about XTR, please download the demo.

XTreme Racing ordering information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please mail order this game if you like it. If you do mail order it and you
have email, I would very much appreciate a qucik email WHEN you have ordered
it, not before. I can't pass on any order information, but I'm interested to
know how many people will buy by mail order on the Amiga because its almost
impossible to get the games into shops now. So BUY, don't pirate!
