                    Mr UFO - The Demo Version
                    =========================


OK, this document file has been completely changed at the request of my
amicable pal, Ville Helin. Now here's a history list:

*** Version 5 (08.01.1997)
- Added diamonds. There are two different types of diamonds to collect.
  Diamonds don't show up in the radar.
- Added a hiscore system. Now you can write your name in glorious
  TechniColour! Click the mouse on the colour blocks or press the function
  keys F1...F8 (try them with Shift and Ctrl) to change colours.
- Fixed a minor bug in the passcode system.

*** Version 4 (03.12.1996)
- Mr UFO now has a main menu screen and a decent game structure. You can now
  click on the "Go!" icon on the main menu and play a game as many times as
  you like.
- I have even added a passcode system. A Mr UFO passcode consists of eight
  characters, which can be letters, numbers or other characters. You are
  given a new passcode at the beginning of every level and you can type
  these in at the main menu by clicking on the key icon.
- Some bugs in warp routine have been fixed.

*** Version 3 (16.11.1996)
- Meters! All the meters on the meter panel work now. The "lives" meter doesn't
  do much yet, but the other meters perform their self-explanatory functions.
- Warping! By pressing FIRE on the joystick or the number "0" on the keyboard
  you can cause your spaceship to warp to a random location on screen. This can
  only be done when the "warp" indicator is green.

*** Version 2 (31.10.1996)
- Scrolltexts! These can be seen on the level stationery. Now I only have to
  think of something witty to write there...
- An enemy! I am looking for comments on its behaviour on screen. And also,
  should it be displayed on the radar? I haven't got the routines to do that to
  work completely yet.

*** Version 1 (11.10.1996)
- Initial release
