This demo illustrates the combination of the vector routines with the plot
routines to plot a line in a bitmap.  Note that this method is NOT optimized
for line drawing, yet still yields fairly decent results.  Use of the blitter,
or an optimized line routine would result in much faster line drawing
(optimized line routines don't yield a consistent vector).
