Here are some words to help you in your quest!
It's adviced to use this help ONLY if you really don't know what to do.
Anyway, you may find some of the lines very essential, but mind the people
who have no experience - I met such men and that's why I provide this help.

And remember - Read only *ONE* line a time!




STAGE ONE - DUMPING GROUND

* try not to stop under the machine
* as a rule, go left
* you can roll..
  * especially under fallen trees
* electricity hurts you
  * you can't get over the 'electric-tree' by yourself..
  * there's nothing but you, the machine, and the obstruction
  * use the machine to get thrown over the tree
* mosquitoes are hard to notice..
  * be quick!
* don't try to jump down the cliff
* if you haven't noticed yet, the machine can destroy metallic objects..
  * like spaceships...
  * make the machine destroy the ship (the ship near the cliff)
* the ship hit a hole on the ground when it landed once
  * jump in!




STAGE TWO - THE QUARRY CAVE      [ONLY IN THE WHOLE PREVIEW VERSION]



STAGE THREE - THE BASE SECTION  [VERY SHORT PREVIEW]

* so far you are well trained, so here's only a few guidelines:
  * watch the wall : there are special signs and devices on it
  * use the shield ;))
  * watch the ground for keys and extra bullets
  * waveing wallparts - they are not dangerous
  * try all kind of doors and teleports
  * you've reached the of this section when you see: 'To Be Continued'
