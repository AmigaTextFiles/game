press a function key to load ...

insert game save disk and press fire.
game over.  press fire to restart level.
the one who enters, shall never leave.  until death comes calling, and the spirit set free.
my advice is this, trust no one.  i have been fooled by even the most trusting souls.  at least i have worked out these switches.  the left switch is the right one.
to reach the exit  i must get past the force field.  the field is too strong to destroy.  i think the only way to get past it is to cut off its power source.  there is an underground generator which i cannot get to, these breathers supply air to the generator.  maybe if i destroy all the breathers the generator will overheat.
stone walls do not a prison make,  nor iron bars a cage.
when i thought i was trapped,  i opened my mind for new solutions,  walls are created in the mind.
there are many paths to travel on.  choose wisely,  your destiny lies on one path only.
be sure to be well armed before waking the beast.  kilmando is tougher than most.
the key master has the masterkey.  nobody can leave without the masterkey.
the end is clear,  but the journey is long.  invisible walls, are just as strong.
he who hesitates will not survive.  be prepared to move quickly.
demo game over.  your journey has only just begun.
the heroes graveyard.
the treasure room.   the gold is mine.  darkness will fall on anyone who disturbs my treasure.
beyond this point, forever will you travel.  the never ending maze, three keys to unravel.
if i lie, the first switch is up.
if i am honest, the second switch is up.
if i lie, the third switch is up.
to find the right switch,  start on the left, four to the right, two left, three right, one left.
the scrolls may help you crack the combination.
he who gains wealth  gains power.   collect all the money you can find.   it may aid you in your quest.
