The Story So Far .....
Since computers started to take over the running of our everyday lives
people got lazier and lazier and so the P.L.E.B was born. They were
Personal Labour Eliminating Biomechanoids or P.L.E.B.s, and they were
cyborg slaves, half machine and half living tissue. They were manufactured by a company run by a mad scientist called
Dr. Strangebrain. The P.L.E.B.s were in just about every home when Strangebrain put his evil plan into action ..........
The P.L.E.B.S started to take over the homes they lived in, and started
killing people in high places. Strangebrain`s factory is a very, very
secure stronghold but your mission is to penetrate it and destroy it
from within. Your objective is split into 3 missions ......

                      Mission 1
                      ---------
Your first mission is to get into his complex. You can do this by
activating the teleport terminals scattered about each area and then
when the teleporter is activated( it flashes red) jump in it to
jump to the next area. P.L.E.B.s appear from ground teleporters
(flashing red things built into platforms)

Good Luck .... You`ll need it .........


                      Player Controls
                      ---------------
To make your player run left & right, push the joystick in that direction.
To make your player jump, push UP on the joystick. To zap the
P.L.E.B.s press fire to activate your Zappo-electro-gun(tm).
This has got quite a kick so be carful because it can kick you backwards.
Most P.L.E.B.s can also be killed by jumping on their heads.


               Hard Disk,Workbench and CLI users
               ---------------------------------
Please note that this game can be copied to a Hard disk but the
current directory MUST be set to "Plebs/" for the game to run properly.
Everything the game needs to run is in the PLEBS/ directory.
If running the game from CLI or workbench the same applies. Set the
directory to "PLEBS_GAME/PLEBS/".


                      Troubleshooting
                      ---------------
This game requires at least 1 meg of free memory to work. If at all
you have problems with the game crashing it could be due to memory
problems - try disconnecting any external devices such as extenal
drives etc.

              Goodbyeeeeee
              ------------
Thats about everything. There are 15 areas to each mission and each
has a new set of P.L.E.B.S. (so thats 10 in all (including strangebrains end-of-level-devices)).
