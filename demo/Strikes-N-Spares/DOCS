Thank you for taking the time to preview Strikes -N- Spares. To run 
Strikes -N- Spares, you must first run the Install_Fonts script. It will 
attempt to copy the required fonts to your FONTS: directory. After doing 
so, you can now run Strikes -N- Spares by double clicking on the bowl 
icon. If do not wish to have the fonts copied to your FONTS: directory 
then simply copy the fonts directory thats included in this archive to 
ram:. After doing so, type the following command from cli:

path fonts: ram:fonts add

if you attempt to run Strikes -N- Spares and it locks up after the title 
screen, you were unsuccesful at installing the fonts. Attempt to reinstall.

Once up and running, you will be able to play Strikes -N- Spares as normal.
The only exceptions would be that you can only have one player (not the
normal eight), you only get to bowl nine frames, the quit option is disabled,
roster information is not saved (nothing to save if you don't play a complete
10 frames) and you get a wonderful requester after you bowl your nine frames.
Other than that, everything is fully functional.

There are basically two methods of bowling. First, you can just throw the
ball over the foul line with the mouse (or mouse compatible trackball).
Direction and speed are calculated from your mouse movements; curve is
calculated from the curve gadget to the left. Second, if you click the left
mouse button, you can use the gadgets to the left to select speed, curve and
position. Clicking on the Bowl gadget will cause an arrow to move across the
screen. Pressing the left mouse button will cause the ball to be thrown in
the direction of the arrow.

Thats it. Have fun!
