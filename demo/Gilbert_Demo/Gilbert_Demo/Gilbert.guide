@Node "User" "User interface"

User interface
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 At the bottom of this page is a quick summary which mostly is enough to get
 going. If you still have problems contolling the game after reading that,
 you may want to come back and read the whole page.

 Control overview
 ----------------

 Moving around:
 Click the LEFT mouse button anywhere on the screen and Gilbert will WALK TO
 the nearest point.

 The Action Menu:
 Pressing the RIGHT mouse button while pointing at an object will bring up
 the ACTION MENU. It contains various commands depending on the object being
 clicked on. Position the mouse over a desired action and press any mouse
 button to make Gilbert perform it. Pressing any mouse button outside the
 menu will cancel the action.

 The inventory:
 --------------

 Examine objects:
 Click the LEFT mouse button on an object in your inventory to look at it.

 Using objects:
 Clicking the RIGHT mouse button on an object will highlight the border. Now, 
 click LEFT mouse button on any other object, in inventory or on the main
 screen, to use the two objects together.

 Note! On some objects a right click will perform a special action. For
 example, right clicking on an envelope might open it instead of using it 
 with something else.

@Node "Story" "The Story"

The story
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many years ago a brave hero saved the land from unavoidable destruction by
 killing the evil wizard with the help of a gigantic mushroom.
 
 Nowadays the mushroom is kept in a museum in the city of Phungoria.
 The citizens take turns guarding and preserving the mushroom from year to 
 year. Every summer a big mushroom-festival is being held, when the people 
 celebrate the ancient victory. During this cermony a new citizen is elected 
 to take the huge responsibility of keeping the mushroom safe and in good 
 shape until next year's festival.

 For nearly a year now, Gilbert's grandfather has been taking care of the
 mushroom. But one week prior to the festival, someone steals the mushroom.
 Everyone blames the grandfather for not being able to do his duty properly.
 The king throws him in jail and prepares to have him executed during the 
 festival.
 
 The only way to save his grandfather is for Gilbert to find the stolen
 mushroom before the end of the week...
