Before you run this you must copy the lh.library included
in the libs directory of this archive to your libs: directory.
To run from a floppy, copy all files from this archive onto
a floppy, then note in the startup-sequence what files it
needs from your Workbench disk.  You should label the 
bootable floppy as SuperWrestling, using the relabel command.
you will need setpatch, cpu, run, and endcli from your
workbench disk.  Run and endcli are internal commands with
later versions of AmigaDOS, older versions can find these
commands in the c: directory.
