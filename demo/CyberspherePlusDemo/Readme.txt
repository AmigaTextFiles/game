Starting the Demo:
------------------

For non-AGA systems, simply execute the file 'CybPlusDemo'.  To do
this, open a CLI or Shell window and enter the above filename.

AGA systems will require the small AGARun utility that is supplied in
the archive.  This utility was included with written permission from the
author, Christopher Bailey.

To run the demo on an AGA system, enter:

	AGARun -np CybPlusDemo			(to run in NTSC mode)
	AGARun -pp CybPlusDemo			(to run in PAL mode)

NOTE:  The game was developed for NTSC systems, however it runs equally
       well in PAL mode at a slightly slower pace.  (5/6 of NTSC speed).
