FORMAT:         AGARun -FC [program]

                - "Program"  Is the FULL Path & File Name of the program to be
                  executed.

                - "F" Is the Frequency.  Either P or N For PAL or NTSC.
                      NTSC is default.

                - "C" Is the Command.  If you wish to use a command then you
                      MUST supply a frequency.



COMMANDS:       The Current Commands are..


                - "A"  AGAReturn - This will Return Your previous AGA Mode screen.

                - "B"  ButtonRun - This will cause AGARun to pause until you
                       press BOTH mouse buttons.  Then the screen will change.
                       (NOTE: You can NOT EXIT!)

                - "C"  Continuous Run - Will not return screen unless you hold
                       BOTH Right and Left Mouse Buttons within 30 Seconds of
                       running.

                (This is usefull for programs that return the CLI before they
                 start.  If there is an error you have 30 seconds to exit, and
                 if it exits after then you can exit then.  The 30 seconds is in
                 case the program needs both Right & Left Mouse Buttons.)


                - "E"  Exit - This will delete the 30 second time limit before
                       Before exiting.  (Unlimited Time)

                - "F"  Final - This will disable exiting completely.
                       (No Exit)

                - "P"  CoProcessor - This will insert a custom copper before
                       running.  (Should get rid of sprite problems)

                - "Q"  Quit - This will Quit the program completely after
                       screen change.  (Use Command A to get screen back)

                - "W"  WorkBench - This is for workbench programs.
                       (Keeps the System Copper)

NOTE:   AGARun is made in 100% Assembly.  Also, AGARun is intended to run

COMMENTS:

        I made this program because I was sick of rebooting my A1200 to run
        non aga programs.  This is made in 100% assembly and took about an
        hour for me to complete it.  If you find any bugs (ugh) then leave
        me mail on InterNET at or call me at (403)293-6437.  Take care.
