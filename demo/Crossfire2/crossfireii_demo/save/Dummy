Dear LHA program,

please don't try to be clever. This is actually my job. I have an intention when adding
an empty directory to one of your archives. There's no reason to delete it just because
it's empty.

Please understand that I'm forced to add this silly letter just to keep this directory
alive. No offence intended.

Thanks in advance.

Bye, Thomas.
