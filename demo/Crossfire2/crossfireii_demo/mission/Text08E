Somewhat later in the game...

A rebel fleet has just repelled an attack on the Leeze space station. To avoid
further surprises you decide to spread early warning probes. There are several
systems which have to be prepared this way and your fleet isn't strong enough
to escort even a single spreader. This job is better done secretly. // //

You have no serious weapons so don't try to fight anyone. As long as you stay covered
spreading the probes should be easy. But if you're recognized, don't hit escape instantly.
You still can fulfill your mission, it just get's way more difficult. //
