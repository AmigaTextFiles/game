This one is a more sophisticated mission. Your fleet enters a new system which
has to be cleared and secured. With bigger vessel waiting in the back your fleet
splits up. Every single fighter is assigned a sector to explore. If someone
steps on enemies too hard for him the capital support will come to help. // //

This mission is situated in the middle of the game so it's already quite hard.
Don't be disappointed if you need several attempts to success. //
