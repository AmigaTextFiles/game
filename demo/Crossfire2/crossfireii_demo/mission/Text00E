Welcome to the CrossfireII-Demo. // //

The texts that normally would follow here and that would tell the story of
the rebel pilot Karsten were removed in this demo version. The demo missions
were taken from various parts of the game and these texts would be too much
out of context to be understandable. Because of that this text just explains
what is needed to play the mission. // //

The tutorial mission is thought to teach you flying and shooting. Just follow
the instructions of your trainer and soon there will be real missions. //

##4 Hi Karsten! Ground Control here.
##5 Welcome aboard your first real ship.
##6 What the heck...?
##7 You're still under remote control
##8 so don't try to steer yet.
##9 ...hrrrrgh...
##10 Don't be so unpatient, hotshot!
##11 You'll get some shooting soon enough.
##12 All practising will happen on low altitude,
##13 this makes your errors less critical.
##14 If all the talking is too fast for you,
##15 view the log by pressing HELP.
##16 You can reread all conversation there.
##17 Ready to roll, youngster?
##18 Ready as ever...
##19 OK, you have full control now.
##20 Left or right to turn your ship,
##21 Up or Down to accelerate accordingly.
##22 You can bounce off walls,
##23 the ship's shield is mass repellent
##24 and shouldn't take much damage.
##25 Why not at least try to move a bit?
##26 Are you so sure about all this, guy?
##27 Forget about it, let's continue.
##28 Whenever a target is to be reached,
##29 it's marked flashing on screen and radar.
##30 Head for it now!
##31 The target is over there!
##32 Ok, guy! Show your steering skills!
##33 I've marked a course through the area.
##34 Complete the course two times
##35 and I take the time you need.
##36 Ready?
##37 GO!
##38 Only %d seconds... I'm impressed!
##39 %d seconds... good!
##40 You did it in %d seconds.. that's ok.
##41 Hmm... %d seconds? Not the fastest, I think.
##42 %d seconds?!? You need more practise!
##43 Round %d done!
##44 Enough flying for now. Let's have some shooting!
##45 I activate your ship's standard weapon.
##46 It's your last defense if all else fails
##47 so you must be able to use it effectively.
##48 I launched some drones. Destroy them all!
##49 Half of them is gone...
##50 Got all! What next?
##51 It's a bit tedious with this weapon, isn't it?
##52 Luckily there are REAL weapons available!
##53 New drones coming, this time use these rockets!
##54 Yeeehaaw!
##55 A new killer is born...
##56 Great fireworks, hotshot!
##57 But fight is not always the solution.
##58 There are times when you have to hide.
##59 Go to the marked Nav Point.
##60 Chris and Jake will look out for you.
##61 Keep an eye on the radar!
##62 Try to keep walls between you and them!
##63 Got ya!
##64 Return to the starting point and try again.
##65 Hide! They're looking for you!
##66 Last chance, guy! Don't let them see you!
##67 Jeesus! You were discovered once again!
##68 They got you once again!
##69 What if these ship were UW's?
##70 Forget about it. It's useless.
##71 OK, one minute is over. Well done!
##72 Chris, Jake: Come back. Thank you.
##73 Do NOT attack them, stupid!
##74 Well... not bad. Until now.
##75 Upto now you only shot at unarmed targets.
##76 Now prove yourself against an enemy
##77 who actually shoots back - me.
##78 You may use whatever weapon you want.
##79 Switch weapons by tipping back or with key.
##80 Now fight!
##81 OK, you've won! I'm really impressed.
##82 Let's stop that here. It was not fair anyways.
##83 Training course completed!
##84 You'll be a real pain in the ass of the UW's!
##85 That's for sure...
##86
Now that was fun, wasn't it? I can't wait to kick some UW asses...
