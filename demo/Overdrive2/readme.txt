 This file is supposed to replace Overdrive.lha in game/demo/.

 This is the first 2 minuts of a 1:30+ hour game.
It also include 3 'snapshots' of other part of the
game.Mak0 is from another level1 mission (EHB 8way scroll),
mak1 is from level3 (Dualplay field, vertical scroll with a
2 screen horizontal freedom), selector (Ship builder).
 The full game come on 2 full packed disks, and 1 disk
for the Virtual ROM.

 Please read the INFO included in this demo loader for
some real info.

Work on all amiga, support all cache and copyback.Its also
VBR friendly and OS friendly (Still not multitasking but
comes back to it), but dont like to have page zero MMU
protected.So please turn Enforcer off before running this
demo.
