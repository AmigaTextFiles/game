MYST DEMO v1.1 
--------------


GERMAN USERS: Please note that the full game is completely 
translated into German (speech, text, menus, printed 
manual and the retail box).




TROUBLESHOOTING: You may experience sound cutting if your 
CPU and CD-ROM drive (if you are running the demo from CD) 
are not fast enough to cope with AHI sounds and loading 
of the files.
1. Try changing CD-ROM settings, to get better speed. 
2. If that does not help, copy the demo to Hard Drive.
3. CGFX users, choose 8-bit instead of 24-bit screenmode.

Or, better yet, treat yourself to 060!

----------------------------------------------------------
If this demo is not working properly, please try disabling 
all utilities from WBStartup folder and user-startup file.
Additionally, make sure your AHI and CGFX (if you have a 
gfx board) are installed properly.
----------------------------------------------------------

An example of utility that will cause problems with Myst 
is Executive. Disable it before running the demo!!!



RESOLUTION: Screen requester will show all modes available 
on your system. Choose the closest to 640x480.

This demo will try to save the resolution to SYS: once you set it, 
so the next time you won't have to choose it again. The full game 
saves it to Myst directory on HD, but since some users might want 
to play this demo directly from a magazine CD, the operation had 
to be altered slightly.
