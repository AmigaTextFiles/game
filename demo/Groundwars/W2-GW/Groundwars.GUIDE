Hi! I - @{b}Mopz@{ub} - am the author of this game - "Waponez 2 - Groundwars", and
I  hope you will enjoy it! The first game - "Waponez" - was not very much
of  a  playable  game,  but I believe this sequal is a lot better! I made
this  game  alone,  as  I  wanted  a pure - very clean - product. Damn, I
didn't even let any solid beta-testers comment it... (doh..?)
   I'm NOT responsable for any damages caused by this product! You use it
at your own risk!

Now I would like to thank some guys mainly for existing...

@{b}Peter  Fischer@{ub}  -  A great 'n' funny e-mail-pal! He even helped me when I
had  some  financial  problems  (no,  I  will not give you his adress ;).
He was also the one who help me by making an AmigaGuide-doc of this text!
Many BIG thanks to him! 

@{b}Maze and Beauty Body@{ub} - The NC.Gamez bunch :)

@{b}Mr.  Byte@{ub}  - He's the author of the most wonderful game "Amibee", which I
will ofcourse beat with this shooter - Ha-ha-ha!

@{b}Joe@{ub}  -  Well...  it's  just cool to mention someone that is a bit famous.
He's working on a great shooter named "Pulsator".

@{b}Zaff & Ramirez@{ub} - You guys are on the dark side of religion ;-[ Wahaha!

@{b}Ariana Richards@{ub} - I'm a fan of her :) The second best looking gal on this
spinning globe!

@{b}Audrey  Mc.  Calla@{ub}  -  Now,  my  lady,  where did you go? - I need you to
help me with a story for "FaYoh 2 - a new adventure"...

@{b}KomplexD@{ub} - Merry Christmas, dude! See ya in school TOO soon... Argh!

                      @{b} O p t i o n s . . .@{ub}

Before  each  level,  you  may change and improve your ship in an options
menu. You can also exit the game, change sound- and music-volume, etc.

@{b}Points:@{ub}
   Move  your  joy  left to remove a point, and right to add a point. You
have  three  points  when  you  start. This way you can build a ship that
suits your own manners.
   Weapon > > > > > - Init-power of your weapon (Low -> High)
   Shield > > > > > - Speed of spinning plasmashield (Slow -> Fast)
   Speed  > > >     - Speed of ship (Slow -> Fast)
   Acc    > > >     - Acceleration of ship (Lousy -> Great)

@{b}Options:@{ub}
   Music Vol Normal/Low  - Volume of music
   Sound Vol Normal/Low  - Volume of sound effects
   Trigger   Normal/Fast - How rapid you want your autofire

@{b}Actions:@{ub}
   Start Game  - Continue with next level
   Exit        - Quit game

@node 3 "Control"

                     @{b}  C o n t r o l . . .@{ub}

Controlling the ship is VERY easy! All you need is a joypad or -stick. As
the Nintendo-freak I am, I prefer to use a pad :)

@{b}Joy:@{ub}
   Up    - Increase speed forward
   Down  - Increase speed backward (decrease speed forward...)
   Left  - Move left
   Right - Move right
   Fire  - No need to use a joy with autofire, as it is already supported
by  the  game itself! There's nothing worse than having to press a button
rapidly ;)

@{b}More power@{ub}
   If  your  ship moves to slow, put some points on 'Speed'! If your ship
is  too  slippy,  put  some points on 'Acc'! If you are possesed by fire-
speed, change 'Trigger' to 'Fast'!

@{b}Shield@{ub}
  The  little  coloured  bastard-plasmaball  that  spins 'round your ship
protects  you  from enemies and their bullets. Increase the rotationspeed
of it by putting some points on 'Shield'. 

@{b}Ingame keys@{ub}
   <P>   - Pause game - press <P> or Fire to unpause!
   <Esc> - Quit game

@node 4 "Bonuses"

                     @{b}  B o n u s e s . . .@{ub}

Every-now-and-then,  when you move an enemy to the place of his destiny -
when  you  blow  him stright to hell - a bonus may be materialised at his
former position. Pick 'em all up! There are no bad ones... or..?

Bonuses:
@{b}   '100'@{ub}         - Score 100
@{b}   '500'@{ub}         - Score 500
@{b}   Ring of stars@{ub} - Your ship'll start flashing, and you'll be imortal for
some seconds.
@{b}   Weapon-symbol@{ub} - Increases  the  power  of  your  weapon  (it will drop
again,  one  step,  if  you loose a life, but it CAN'T go lower than your
'weapon'-points!)

@node 5 "Enemies"

                      @{b} E n e m i e s . . .@{ub}

There's  no such thing as 'good guys'. Shoot everything that moves! There
are  enemies  though,  that  doesn't  move - these are cannons etc on the
ground (you will notice that they shoot at you!).
   At  the end of each level, you will have to face a big boss! The music
changes  when  this  happens. Usually they have many different body-parts
that  must  be destroyed before they explode totally. Aim good 'caus they
shoot a lot!

You gain score by killing enemies - most of 'em demands more than one hit
before they die.

@node 6 "Points"

@{b}                        P o i n t s . . .@{ub}

At  first,  you  have  only three points to distribute on weapon, shield,
speed  and  acceleration. Read the 'options' chapter for more information
about  how  to use 'em. After each level your points will be increased by
one, which means that you may improve your ship at the options-menu.
   A  'point'  is  actually  an energypack that can be placed anywhere to
increase the power of the object.

@node 12 "Hints"

@{b}                         H i n t s . . .@{ub}

It's of no use to spend your first three @{b}points@{ub} on weapon (you can always
gain  better  weapons  during  the  game).  Instead,  install  speed  and
acceleration - they are most important in the begining! To put a point on
shield is atleast better than to put it on weapon.

Try  to  @{b}cut  enemywaves@{ub}  as long as it's possible. Stand still and shoot
like  a  maniac  when you see an obvious wave. This is a VERY good way to
handle the megafast blue things :) If you have loads of shieldpoints, you
won't even have to worry 'bout their bullets.

@{b}Enemybullets@{ub} LOVE to hide behind bonuses, so beware! 

And now something very deep - understand and be happy!
   "To become the @{b}ultimate warrior@{ub}, type beauty at options"

And the best hint of 'em all... Buy the @{b}full version@{ub}!

This  demo-version  may  freely  be  distributed  as long as it is in its
ORIGINAL  state.  No files may be added, changed or removed! If you alter
any  data,  only God him self knows what WILL happen to you when my anger
starts haunting your nightmares!
   If  you  plan to include this game on a magazine coverdisk or -CD, I'm
afraid  you  will have to notify me via an e- or snailmail! If you review
it  in a magazine, I would also like to know about it, but you don't HAVE
to  tell  me  (no...  why  care  about  MY feelings; I only MADE the damn
game!).

If  you  find  any  bugs  or if you have something to say about the game,
please  send  me  an  e-mail! I answer all answerable letters! And do not
forget  to  visit NC.Gamez wonderful homepage! If you're a swede, you can

The  future  will  always be tomorrow :) All we can do is to hope for the
best.  I've  planned to add/change some stuff in this game, but if you've
got some more ideas, please don't hesitate to tell me via an e-mail!

@{b}Hiscore@{ub}
   There  must be a top-10-scorelist in which you may enter and save your
name if you're a good shooter. 

@{b}Keyboard control@{ub}
   For those who don't have a joystick or -pad.

@{b}Bonusgames@{ub}
   After  each  level  you  may  enter a bonuslevel to win extralives and
points.  In  "Waponez" I had a spaceinvader-game, perhaps I could make an
asteroid game or something for "Groundwars". Any suggestions?..

@{b}New powerups@{ub}
   Extralives,  bombs,  points and other, that materialises when you kill
enemies. 

@{b}Extralife at score XXXXX@{ub}
   Yep. 10 000 is regular, so I will probably use 10 000, 20 000, 30 ...

@{b}An intro@{ub}
   Something  spacey!  Probably so fat that it will only be available for
registered players.

@{b}Extra weapons@{ub}
   I've  thought  some  about missiles, and shooting plasmaballs (such as
the spinning shield). But I'm not quite sure yet. Probably you would need
a  pad  with  two  buttons  unless  you'd wanna sit with your foot on the
keyboard 'n' press <space> ;) Ha-ha!  

@{b}A cool story@{ub}
   Ummm...  this is tricky! "Waponez" ended with a crash with yer ship on
an  alien  planet. So... how the heck did you get a new ship? I'll figure
something out :)

This  game  is currently a game-to-be. In other words: I'm working on it!
It  will  be finished soon (not later than february '98). If you want the
full  version when it is finished, PLUS every new level as they come, you
will  have  to register. The sooner, the more motivated I'll feel to make
the game as good as possible!
   You will have to send me (cash) 60-100 SEK, 15-20 DM or £3-5. You must
also  have  an  e-mail adress to which I can send the game, else you will
have to include some money for stamps!

Here's  a  list  of some other games released by NC.Gamez. If you haven't
played  'em,  I recomend you to do so! They're available from Aminet, our
homepage and from the NC.Gamez BBS :)

@{b}FaYoh@{ub} (AGA - 9 of 10 in "Amiga Aktuell")
   A  cute game in the style of "Giana Sisters". You control a green 'gum
in  his search for the cute pink 'gum! It's a platformer, and you have to
pass  a  shitload  of levels, encounter bosses etc in order to reach her!
You  can  ofcourse save your position in the game, so that you don't have
to start from the begining everytime!

@{b}PIV120@{ub} (AGA - 79% in "Amiga info")
   In  this  breakoutish  game, you have to find PIV-blocks, hidden under
other blocks, in order to finish a level. Lots of bonuses and others.

@{b}JackMan@{ub} (ECS - 5 of 5 and "Game of the month" in "CU Amiga Magazine")
   Some  sort of a mix between "PacMan" and "BoxMan". You have to eat all
pacs  on  each level, but you have to solve problems, shoot through walls
etc to reach 'em.

@{b}PlubZ@{ub} (AGA - Damn... I haven't seen any reviews of this one yet)
   A   pure   puzzlegame  in  which  you  exterminate  aliens  with  your
ojke-board.  Very  entertaining...  for  atleast  a  while ;) 9 different
difficult-levels. Very cute SFX and GFX!

@{b}wAZiT@{ub} (AGA+030 - 5 of 10 in "Amiga Aktuell")
   A zooming gravitygame for two players. There are some weapons and
arenas, but I assume the game can get a bit boring. All you do is shoot,
shoot and shoot (to kill). I would rather advice you to take a look at
"Bratwurst" from 3LE! I stole their idea and made a lousier game out of
it :) Waaaaah!..
