                            Shooter Document


                      Welcome to the Shooter Program!


            Shooter was written by Samuel Bowers for Samsof Software.



                       ****** Introduction ******

Shooter is a simple little shoot 'em up type program that I wrote for the 
Amiga 1200 computer. Being as Shooter makes use of the AGA chipset I am 
afraid that it will not run on anything less than an Amiga 1200. My setup 
consists of an Amiga 1200 with an 80Mb 2.5" IDE hard drive (with two 
partitions), a Hewlett Packard inkjet printer, a video digitiser and a Titan 
modem. I do not currently have any fastmem connected to my Amiga. All I 
can say for certain is that Shooter runs perfectly on the above system, but I 
cannot guarantee that it will run on your system, therefore please let me 
know what sort of setup you have, and how well my programs run on your 
system. 




                     ****** Installing Shooter *****

Just double click on the Install icon. Everything will be done for you 
automatically.




                        ****** How it works ******

The first screen to appear (the welcome screen) contains a welcome message 
in the upper left hand corner, welcoming you to the program. Under this is 
some information about what to do and which keys to use. You can use either 
the joystick or the keyboard to play Shooter. If you use the joystick, 
certain functions (such as pause and end) can only be accessed via the 
keyboard. Which keys these are should be obvious. The rule is that whichever 
keys do not control physical movement are accessible only via the keyboard.

In the upper right hand corner of the screen you can select how easy or 
difficult you wish the game to be, by selecting how many lives you want 
to start with, how fast you want your ship to be and how fast you want the 
alien to be moving. These are all selected by using a slider bar, -with it's 
current value displayed to it's right- for each feature you wish to alter.
With both the ship and alien settings, the lower the number, the slower the 
ship. The ship has a minimum setting of 3 and if you set the alien to 0 then 
it will not move until you go up a level (unless, during play, you hit the 
bar under the box entitled `+alien speed'. If you have not registered then
you can only set the number of lives to a maximum of 5. Throughout the game
the lives will never go higher than 5. If you are a registered user though,
you can set the lives to a maximum of 30 and the maximum number of lives 
possible in the game is 99.
Below these selections you can select a password if you know one. When you 
reach levels 10,20,30,40 and 50 you will be given a password. Write this down 
and when you play next just enter this password into the welcome screen and 
you will begin play at the last multiple of ten level that you got to last 
time. This feature is disabled for unregistered users.


                   And now for the interesting part. 

The first person to reach level 51 and let me know about it will win £15.00. 
To prove that you have reached there just let me know what the little rhyme 
that is given at level 51 is and if you are the first registered person to 
tell me, then you win that lovely lolly!  In order to win, you MUST be a 
registered user. If you have sent me the correct rhyme, but you don't hear 
back from me within 28 days, then I'm afraid somebody else beat you to it 
and you haven't won. If you give me an E-mail address then I will inform you
whether you have won or not, but I'm afraid it would just cost too much to
send out ordinary letters to every loser. Sorry.    


                          ***** STOP PRESS *****

As of 16th August 1996 nobody has yet claimed the £15.00 prize, so hurry, 
send your registration in today, find that little rhyme and you could be a 
winner!



                     ****** Playing the Game ******

So far as playing the actual game is concerned, this is very easy. All have 
to do is use your left and right controls to move your ship (which is at the 
bottom of the screen), and shoot at the target, while avoiding the targets 
bullets. If your ship makes contact with the targets bullet you lose a life, 
so be careful!  You will also notice that along the top of the play area 
there is a row of alternately coloured blue and red boxes with writing in 
them. There is also a red bar which jumps first under one box then under 
another. If you can shoot this bar, then whichever box it is under at the 
time, will determine what happens. For instance, if the bar is under the box 
which says `+ alien speed` when your bullet hits it, then the alien will go a 
little faster. Check to see what each box does, and if you want a particular 
feature, then wait until the bar is under the box that does that feature, and 
shoot at it. Do not shoot at the box when the bar is not underneath it, as you 
will then gain a `miss`. If you accumulate ten misses then you go down a 
level. If on the other hand, you accumulate ten `hits` the you go up a level. 
One of the things along the very top of the display is information on `hits` 
and `misses`. These do not show the number of hits and misses that you 
have had, but rather show the number of hits and misses to go before you 
either go up or down a level. The rest is very straightforward and doesn't 
need me getting typer's cramp to explain it here!



               ****** Registering for the full version ******

If you are not a registered user of this program, then you will no doubt 
wish to register as soon as possible. To do this just send me a cheque, 
postal order or cash for £5.00 if you wish the keyfile to be E-Mailed to you,
or £7.50 if you wish the keyfile to be sent to you on a disk via snail-mail.
Please make cheques and postal orders payable to S. Bowers, and send your
order along with a covering letter telling me which program you wish to 
receive. (I have written several, so it is imperative that I know which one 
you want)! Please do include your full name and address in the covering 
letter, even if you want the keyfile E-Mailed to you, as i need this info,
because without it the keyfile will not work. I will do my very best to
dispatch the keyfile within 24 hours of receiving a postal order or cash and
7 days of receiving a cheque (to allow for clearance). In the extremely 
unlikely event of non-delivery of your keyfile, please allow up to 28 days 
from your original order before contacting me. Thank you.
If you wish me to send your keyfile by snail mail then you can send a 
stamped addressed jiffy bag along with a blank disk and covering letter. 
That way you need only pay £5.00 for your keyfile. It is not essential to
send an SAE if you wish your keyfile to be sent by snail-mail, and if you 
don't please don't forget to send and extra £1.50 for postage, packing etc.
You can send your order, along with payment by cheque, postal order or cash 
to:

                             Samuel Bowers
                             Samsof Software

                             Beccles
                             Suffolk

                             England 

             I can be E-Mailed at:  sambowers@thenet.co.uk 

    The above addresses can also be used for any and all correspondence, 
              donations, bug reports, praise, criticism etc.

If you send cash through the post, and it gets lost before reaching me, I 
cannot be held responsible.
If you are an overseas user then the easiest way to pay is to send cash
through the post. If possible please send pounds sterling, but if this is not
possible then only send major currencies such as US$, DM, FFR etc as I cannot
exchange some currencies (particularly -but not exclusively- eastern 
european currencies). Before sending me any foreign currency please do check
the current exchange rate to make sure that you are sending enough. Should
you send more than I have asked for I will assume that the extra is meant as
a donation. 
                             


                        ****** Known bugs ******

The only bug that I am aware of in this program is that occasionally the 
alien's bullet will not be wiped properly from the screen when it ceases to 
exist. If this happens a few times, the screen can quickly get cluttered. I 
tried and tried over and over again to get rid of this, but I just couldn't 
seem to work it out, so I put a function in where you just press the `d` key 
on the keyboard and this will refresh the screen. I know this is not a 
perfect solution, but until I can find the problem, it's all that I can do.
If you discover any other bugs, please let me know.



                      ****** Program History ******

This is version 2.0 of Shooter. the main difference between this and the
earlier version is that this version has been enhanced, so that registered
users can obtain a keyfile by E-Mail to turn their existing program into the
full registered version. The keyfile will not work with the earlier version
of Shooter. With this version I have also allowed more features for
unregistered users. The difficulty controls and number of lives can now be
set by unregistered users, although the maximum number of lives has been
limited to 5. In the game itself ALL the boxes at the top of the game now
function in the unregistered version. 
If you think the program could be improved upon and that I should 
make a better version then please let me know. I would welcome any ideas 
that you may have. 

Shooter was originally released on the 8th July 1996. Since then I received 
correspondence from people who were having difficulty in getting the program 
to run. The problem was not a fault in the progam itself, but was that the
program was loooking for the fonts in the system's fonts drawer rather than 
the programs fonts drawer. The solution was of course to copy the fonts to 
the `SYS:FONTS' drawer, but because so many people seemed to have trouble in
understanding this I have now included an Installer script. Just double
click on the `Install' icon and everything will be done for you automatically.
 


                        ****** Thank You ******

I would like to thank Jonathan Potter who lives in Australia for writing the 
`Fullview' program which I have used to display these documents and 
especially for his allowing anyone to use his program.
I would also like to thank you for using this software and for registering
it (if you haven't already then I'm sure you intend to).
