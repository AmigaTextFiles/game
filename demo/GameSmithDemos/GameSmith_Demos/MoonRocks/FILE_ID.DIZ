MoonRocks - Lunar lander game with a twist.

Recent news reports indicate a famous dead rock star has been sighted
on the moon.  Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to find the
rock star and land near him.  The moon is a harsh place, so don't
expect to be able to land just anywhere!  You have no time limit, but
your fuel supply is limited.  Fortunately, there's a filling station
on the moon, but you'll need to be a pretty good pilot to land on it.
