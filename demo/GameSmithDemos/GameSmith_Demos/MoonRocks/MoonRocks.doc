Here it is!  MoonRocks!  One of the first games created using the
Gamesmith Development System for the Amiga!

Recent news reports indicate a famous dead rock star has been sighted
on the moon.  Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to find the
rock star and land near him.  The moon is a harsh place, so don't
expect to be able to land just anywhere!  You have no time limit, but
your fuel supply is limited.  Fortunately, there's a filling station
on the moon, but you'll need to be a pretty good pilot to land on it.

Before playing, copy the supplied medplayer.library file to your
libs: directory.  This step is not necessary if you already have
a libs:medplayer.library file.

To start the game, double-click the MoonRocks icon, or type
"MoonRocks" at a CLI prompt.  The game takes a short while to load.
While the game is running, multi-tasking is turned off.  But don't
worry, everything is restored when the game ends.

Use the joystick to control the spacecraft.  Move the stick left
or right to rotate the craft, and press the fire button to engage
the thrusters.

To pause or end the game, press the left mouse button.

MoonRocks will not run on an OCS (old chip set) Amiga, and it may
require 1 meg of chip RAM.  AGA owners may need to turn off mode
promotion for the game to be displayed properly.

The following files must be in the current directory or the game
will not run:

    lc.cplx
    rs.cplx
    landscape.iff
    panel.iff
    fill.snd
    kaboom.snd
    landed.snd
    ping.snd
    thrust.snd
    whoop.snd
    mod.MoonRocks

MoonRocks was developed using the GameSmith Development System.
Complete source code for the game is included, but you will need a
copy of GameSmith in order to compile the source.  For details about
