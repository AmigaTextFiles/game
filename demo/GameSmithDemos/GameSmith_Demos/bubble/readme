These demo programs illustrate the following:

bubbles - Multiple single shot disk based anims with a copper list display.

bubble_blank - Multiple single shot disk based anims as a screen blanker.

bubble_line - Demonstrates ability to draw into a bitmap "behind" anim objects.

bubble_rastport - Demonstrates how to use standard system text and graphics
in conjunction with a GameSmith display.

bubble_virtual - Allow bubbles to bounce around a virtual space area, although
collisions are not enabled while in virtual space.  Real space is the size of
the bitmap.

bubble_copper - Fast user copper list updated every vertical blank interval,
while bubbles bounce around the screen.

NOTE: there is no break handling in these demos.  Do not use ctrl-C to break
