Yeah, this is a clone of the old Ultima! With a higher gfx level but
still in 16 colors...
Why? I liked a lot the first stories of Ultima, but the gfx in 16 colors
were... I always thought that it was possible to make better than the
original and the other clones, keeping 16 colors...
Obviously, this version is compatible for all the machines Amiga, Atari ST
(it still works!), PC, Mac...

No, it's not a joke!!! Only older RPG players can appreciate the artwork...
Some friends, on PC, are enjoyed by this version... I'm very surprised, in
this times of full-3D games, but it's true!
And for a game of this kind, it isn't necessary to get a 640x480 screen or
more, with a graphic card, etc... The fun comes from elsewhere... And the
easy way of playing Ultima 3, for example, made its success...

This is a no-playable demo of the game (sorry!), but I haven't got the time
to program it now... So if you're a programer, and you want the game to come
alive on Amiga, just contact me, only by Normal Mail (sorry, again, but I
haven't got e-mail... Internet in France is very expensive!!!).

Final version features:
 - 16 colors (nostalgia...)
 - more than 256 gfx blocks (16x16) for maps
 - a very high number of characters and monsters (I can't calculate it...)
 - a complete and very intuitive player interface (crypted in this demo)
 - nice musics
 - a construction kit for characters, monsters, maps and adventures!!!
