1. INTRODUCTION

Bouncy the spaceball has  got  himself  lost.  You  have  to guide him
through five different areas  back to  his  home.  Each  area features
five puzzling levels.  Some  are  very  simple,   others   are not. To
complete a level you must have  the  key  that  opens the exit. It may
sound easy but there are several obstacles in your path.

In this demo version there are  seven levels, taken from various areas
of the game.

                              D. BACKGROUNDS

2A. PLAY THE GAME
Choosing this option will start the game (See 3. PLAYING BOUNCY).

2B. PASSWORD
Only available in the full version.

2C. HELP
Selecting this button will  display  all  the  platforms  and  objects
you will encounter during the game.

PLATFORMS
---------

SOLID - Straight-forward, normal, boring platform.

SHRINKING - Once  bounced   on,   will   shrink  until  it disappears.
Any platform can start to shrink   after  being  bounced  on. You have
been warned!

STICKY - If you keep moving you will be alright. Stop and your stuck.

RED-HOT - Only bounce on  this  if  you  want  to  die  or if you are
carrying water.

SLANT - Whichever way the slant  is  facing,  you will bounce that way
before you can do anything about it.

JUMP-UP - You can jump  up  through  this  platform but you can`t jump
down  through  it.  Some  of  these  platforms  will  disappear  after
bouncing.

MOVING - The platform  will  move  one  place  to  the  left or right,
depending on which way  the  arrow  is  facing.  Once the platform has
reached the end of  its  path  the  arrow  will  turn  round, then the
platform will move in the opposite direction.


WALLS
-----

HARD - Solid wall, cannot be destroyed.

SOFT - Can be destroyed, if you have a hammer.


OBJECTS
-------

HAMMER - Used to knock down soft walls.

WATER - Cools down a red-hot  platform  and  turns  it into a solid or
shrinking platform.

HEART - An extra life will be  given if you have this after completing
a level. If you die before completing the level you will also lose the
heart.

KEY - Opens the exit.

EXIT - Once you  have  the  key  the  exit  opens.  The  exit can open
anywhere and you will have  to  guide  bouncy towards it. Jumping into
the exit will take you to the next level.


2D. BACKGROUNDS

Only available in the full version.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3. PLAYING BOUNCY

Bouncy is controlled by the joystick.

UP - JUMP UP

RIGHT - JUMP RIGHT

LEFT - JUMP LEFT

To restart any level press any mouse key.

Bouncy can  only  change  direction  or   jump   has  he  touches  the
platform, ie pushing the joystick  to  the  left will result in bouncy
jumping left once he touches the platform.

To jump onto a higher platform  you  must  push  the joystick up as he
bounces then push left or  right  when  he reaches the correct height.
Bouncy can fall  from  any  height  but  if  he  falls  off the bottom
platform he will die.

Bouncy will pick  up  any  object  he  contacts.  The  objects will be
displayed at the top of the screen.
