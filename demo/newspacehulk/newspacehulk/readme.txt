		*** New Spacehulk level for Gloom & Gloom Deluxe **


	Welcome to our first new replacement level for Gloom. We've tried to
	improve on the original spacehulk level (which is very hard to do).

	We decided to create this level after completely exhausting the original
	game. Many thanks go to Mark Sibly from Black Magic and Markus Castren
	who maintains the only offical Gloom web site on the Net.

	This level looks best when played on Gloom Deluxe(obviously!) but will
	work on the original Gloom.

	REQUIREMENTS:
	*************

	Gloom or Gloom Deluxe.
	Any Amiga which runs the original game.


	INSTALLATION: To Hard drive.
	*************


	1.) Copy the following files to a safe place.
	   
         gloom/maps/ map1_1 to map1_7

	    misc/ script
	    
         Do not proceed until these files are safe!!
 
	2.) Unarchive newspacehulk.lha to a seperate directory.
         
         Copy map1_1 to map1_7 to gloom/maps/

         Copy script to gloom/misc/

     3.) Playgloom. Select newgame to play the new level.

	INSTALLATION: TO FLOPPY.
     *************


	1.) Make a copy of your original game disks.

	2.) Unarchive newspacehulk.lha to RAM:

	3.) Using the copied Gloom Data Disk,

         Copy RAM:map1_1 to map1_7 to gloomdata/maps

         Copy RAM:script to gloomdata:misc

	4.) You may find that there isn't enough room on the data disk to fit
	    the new maps on in which case you must delete some of the other maps.
	    We suggest you delete map4_1 to map4_7 which will give you ample room
	    to fit our new maps into the drawer. NOTE - ONLY ALTER YOUR COPY OF
	    THE DATA DISK -  It's about time you bought a hard drive isn't it?
 
     5.) Playgloom. Select newgame to play the new level.


	If you have any problems installing the new maps contact us using the
	e-mail address at the end of this file.

	IN THE FUTURE:

	Well, even though we are aware of an unreleased Gloom data disk made
	by Black Magic we are considering a similar venture ourselves.
