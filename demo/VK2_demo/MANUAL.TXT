Preliminary notes:

"Virtual Karting II" was thought as a coin'op-style arcade/simulation.
Realistic driving, but also pure and immediate action.

Please play the game on a composite-video monitor or on a TV: the
fast display technique used by this game has been designed for that
kind of device. The game can be played also on RGB monitors, but the
graphics quality will be inferior. NOTE: the game is AGA-only.

The game has been designed to exploit as much as possible low-CPU
configurations, but can use the added power of faster CPU's as well.

Hard disk installation:

Unexpanded A1200, with or without hard disk: there's not enough RAM
to boot from the workbench, so you gotta boot from the floppy disks.
It's probably really about time to upgrade at least the quantity of
RAM in your Amiga.

CDROM users: you can play the game also directly from the CDROM (needs
more than 2MB of system RAM); to install the game on the hard disk is
not strictly necessary. However, if you want records and options to be
saved, you've to install the game on the hard disk.

NOTE about the HD Installer script (found in the program disk):
Do not use spaces for directory name.. I suggest to use "VK2" or
"Virtual_Karting_II".

Game keys:

F10 to toggle between 3D and 2D modes.

When in 3D mode:
F1   = low view         (only available in 3D mode)
F2   = normal view      (only available in 3D mode)
F3   = mid view         (only available in 3D mode)
F4   = high view        (only available in 3D mode)
F6   = toggles "2x1" and "2x2" resolution (only available in 3D mode)
F7   = Water reflections ON/OFF (only available in 3D mode)
F8   = Track objects ON/OFF
B    = toggles background  between "none" or "simple 3D"

When in 2D mode:
F9   = toggles "full/half screen" in 2D mode.

E    = Easy mode        (less slowdown when offroad, less sliding)
N    = Normal mode      (more realistic, and more challenge)
DEL  = manual gears     (only available in Normal mode)
HELP = automatic gears  (only available in Normal mode)

LEFT ALT / RIGHT AMIGA = Change gear down  (both in manual and automatic gears)
LEFT AMIGA / RIGHT ALT = Change gear up    (both in manual and automatic gears)

J  =  select digital joystick as driving device (stick ahead to accelerate)
F  =  select digital joystick as driving device (fire button to accelerate)
M  =  select mouse as driving device
A  =  select analogue joystick as driving device

Note: when using digital joystick (either sub-options), you can drive also
using the keyboard's cursor keys.

ESC    = exit from this Race/Qualify/Demo
RETURN = skips directly to Race ( only available in Qualifying )
Q      = resets your qualify times for this track and this
         kart selection ( only available in Qualifying )

SPACE = toggles "pause" on/off.

"VIRTUAL KARTING II" tips:
This game is realistic, so don't expect to pass all the karts easily.
All the karts (including yours) have the same, identical performance.
The difference is made uniquely by the skills of the driver (i.e. you
or the 5 karts piloted by the computer).

The game includes realistic wake simulation routines. Thus when you
follow a kart and you are near to it you have better aerodynamics and
you can more easily pass by, just like in real life. Skilled drivers
will pass the opponents delaying as much as possible the use of the
brake before a bend.

Two karts types are simulated:
 125cc: 2 stroke engine (38 HP / 14700 r.p.m. ), 7 gears.
        It has a rotating disc valve in the intake and it doesn't have
        an exhaust valve; this gives more power but a very nervous
        erogation, expecially in the peak r.p.m. It has no real useful
        torque under 8000 r.p.m. These characteristics make it a very
        hard kart to drive with manual gears, and a difficult one even
        with automatic gears. But a very powerful kart also, ideal if
        you're a skilled driver.
  80cc: 2 stroke engine (25HP / 13800 r.p.m. ), 6 gears.
        It has a reed valve in the intake and an exhaust valve; this
        gives less power but better torque erogation, and makes it be
        a very simple kart to drive.

Are you a great driver? You use the 125cc kart, no easy mode,
manual gearbox, the most difficult tracks and you're still bored?
Well, let's see if you can handle a 4x increase in engine power!
Enable the cheat mode by pressing the Caps Lock key (the led must
remain bright), then press (on the keypad only) the keys 1,2,3
to have x1 (normal), x2 or x4 engine power. Press 4,5,6 to have
longer transmission ratios (x1.0, x1.3, x1.7) that will be useful
in case of increased engine power, to reach higher speeds. Press
7,8,9 to have better tires grip (x1.0, x1.5 or x2.0). To disable
the cheat mode press the Caps Lock key again, to turn the led off.
Note: when using cheat mode you can't use your lap times to make a
new record (or it would be too easy..).

On exit the game saves in the program disk some data: the records of
each track in the file Records (you can copy the file Records.original
to it if you want to reset all records), and various informations about
which tracks disk you used last, which track of it, and the selected
height of the 3D viewpoint (keys F1,F2,F3 and F4) of each available track.
The options aren't saved automatically: if you want them to be saved,
select the proper option in the Options menu screen of the game (the file
saved will be in the program disk, the filename is Options; you can copy
the file Options.original to it if you want to reset all the options).
Note: if the program disk is write protected nothing will be saved (so
you can use your original floppy disks, or you can play the game directly
from CDROM - depending on the version (CD or floppy)).

The default options are:

# 2x1 pixel detail (press F6 while driving to toggle between 2x2 and 2x1).
# Reflections are disabled (press F7 while driving to enable/disable them).
# Tracks objects are enabled (press F8 while driving to disable/enable them).
# 2D view is large (press F9 while driving to change the 2D window's size:
   note, this option may be useful only on unexpanded A1200, to reach 50fps).
# Automatic Gears mode (both Manual Gears and Easy Mode are disabled. Note:
   hit E,N,DEL,HELP to change this option while driving, or use Options Screen).
# Digital Joystick, stick ahead to accelerate (the "fire button to accelerate"
   option is disabled, hit F while driving to enable it. Hit M or A to enable
   respectively Mouse or Analogue Joystick as driving device. You can also
   set these options using the Options Screen).

Go to the Option Screen and choose "Save Selected Options" to save permanently
on the disk the options configuration that you prefer.

VARIOUS INFORMATIONS:

# when you are in the main menu screen, you can hit the 'Esc' key to return
  to the presentation screens again, and if you don't go to any other screen,
  after about 10 seconds the game will go automatically in auto-demo.

# the Demo (and auto-demo feature) last 5 minutes.

# the Race lasts 5 laps.

# the Qualify/Practice lasts infinite laps.

# you can exit from a Race/Qualify/Demo section by hitting the 'Esc' key.

# only in Qualify/Practice mode you can hit the Return key and go directly
  into Race mode.

# only in Qualify/Practice mode you can hit the Q key and reset your qualify
  position.

# Cheat mode: Press CAPs-Lock, keep it active (the led must remain bright)
  The following keys on the KeyPad become available:

  7,8,9 = Tires grip         x1.0, x1.5, x2.0
  4,5,6 = Transmission ratio x1.0, x1.3, x1.7
