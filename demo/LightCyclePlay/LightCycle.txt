Short: Drive the rendered Tron LightCycle

Type: game/demo


                **  Rendered mini LightCycle demos. **


To run either of the demos, just double click on the icon.

LightPlay is an example of being able to drive the LightCycle round a
normal sized screen, showing off the LightCycle grafix.

LightRoad is an example of trying to add in some sort of road to eventually
produce a game, but I doubt it'll ever get that far, the road isn't being
drawn fast enough, even on an 030@50mhz. (Heck, it's only AmosPro..)

You need a joystick to drive the LightCycle, pressing the fire button will
quit the demos.

LightCycle.abk and LightCycle.iff *must* exist in the same directory as
where the LightPlay and LightRoad are run from, there are extra iff images
to choose from, just rename the current LightCycle.iff to another name, and
then rename a new one to LightCycle.iff, the pictures exist to produce the
colour palette for the LightCycle.

If any nut wants the original frames (280 are created just for this little
demo) to make some sort of game from, do contact me. Oh, and so far as I
know, only I have the LightCycle in 3D format, in this case I created it
in Imagine from original stills from Tron, it still needs a little more
work, but it's very passable as the original LightCycle.

Included in the archive are 2 extra pics, LightCycleHAM1.iff and
LightCycleHAM2.iff, they are overscan HAM pictures of the LightCycle
rendered to full screen.

BTW, Don't get too carried away, it's only a demo, and I don't intend to
make a full game.

You can do what you will with the pictures and the .abk bank, I give free
reign for anyone to make anything from them, as long as *no* profit is made
whatsoever.
