3C. POKER

The dealer will deal five cards for  you and five for himself. The aim
of this game is to hold the highest hand.

After you have been dealt your cards you have the following choice:

                                 BET
                                 STAY
                                 DROP

DROP.
Drop your cards and lose.

STAY.
The dealer will choose between raising the stakes or calling.

BET.
If you think you have a good hand  you can up the stakes. Click on the
+1000 or -1000 until you are  happy  with the stake, then select quit.
The dealer will  then  choose  between  raising  the  stakes  again or
calling. Whatever he opts for he  must  pay whatever stake you choose.
If he raises you will have the following choice:

                                 RAISE
                                 CALL
                                 DROP

If you want to raise the stakes  again just repeat the bet process. If
you call then both players have the chance to drop whatever cards they
don't want and select new ones. To  do  this, simply click on the card
you don't want and it will turn over. Once you have selected the cards
to drop, select ready and the dealer  will give you new cards. He will
then decide if he wants any new cards.

After this, you  will  be  given  the  choice  of  betting, staying or
dropping and another round  will  take  place.  This time though, when
someone calls both hands are shown and the winner is decided.

Winning hands in order of best to worst.

STRAIGHT FLUSH.
Five cards in order in the same suit.

FOUR OF A KIND.
Four aces, four sevens etc.

FULL HOUSE.
One pair and three of a kind.

FLUSH.
Five cards of the same suit.

STRAIGHT.
Five cards in numerical order but from different suits.

THREE OF A KIND.
Three eights, three kings etc.

TWO PAIRS.
Two threes and two tens etc.

ONE PAIR.
Two fives, two nines etc.

If the two hands are the  same  then  the  hand with the highest value
wins. If you have three jacks and  the dealer has three nines then you
win as jacks are higher than nines.


3D. BLACKJACK

This game is also known as Pontoon or 21.

Again, you are playing against the  dealer.  your initial choice is to
start or raise the  stakes.  Once  you  are  happy  with the stake the
dealer will deal two cards for each player, although you will only see
one of his cards.

The object of this game  is  to  have  a  higher  hand than the dealer
though your hand must not go over twenty-one. If it does, you are bust
and the dealer wins.

Jacks, Queens and Kings count as ten  points and the Ace counts as one
or eleven. You can choose when you receive one.

Once you have received your cards you can choose from the following:

                                 BUY
                                 STICK
                                 TWIST

BUY.
Gives you the chance to raise the stakes and receive another card.

STICK.
Stay with the cards you  have  and  let  the  dealer try and beat your
score.

TWIST.
Gives you another card.

This process repeats until you  stick  or  bust, then it's the dealers
turn.

If the dealers score is less than  yours he will take more cards until
he is either bust or beats your score.

At the end of the game the  person nearest to twenty-one without going
bust wins the pot. If you both have the same, then the dealer wins.


3E. FRUIT MACHINE

This is one of the  best  known  gambling  games  in the world. As you
probably know, the game is quite  simple.  You spin the reels and hope
for a win. Each spin costs 1000 pounds.

Your cash box is in the top right hand corner of the screen and should
you wish to quit this game and return to the main menu then just click
the mouse on this box.

To spin the reels, click on start. The  reels will then spin for a few
seconds. The following table shows the cash you can win.

SMILEY * 1 = 2000   SMILEY * 2 = 3000   LEMON  * 3 = 5000
SMILEY * 3 = 5000   SMILEY * 4 = 8000   LEMON  * 4 = 8000

PLUM   * 3 = 6000   CHERRY * 3 = 10000  TOMATO * 3 = 10000
PLUM   * 4 = 10000  CHERRY * 4 = 15000  TOMATO * 4 = 15000

APPLE  * 3 = 10000  PEAR   * 3 = 15000  STRAWBERRY * 3 = 15000
APPLE  * 4 = 15000  PEAR   * 4 = 20000  STRAWBERRY * 4 = 20000

STAR   * 3 = 20000  BAR    * 3 = 40000  JACKPOT    * 3 = 50000
STAR   * 4 = 30000  BAR    * 4 = 50000  JACKPOT    * 4 = 100000

To hold a reel,  click  the  mouse  on  hold  if  the hold buttons are
flashing. If you hold or you have  just  won then you will not be able
to hold on the next spin. If  you  change your mind after holding just
click the right mouse button on the hold you wish to change.

If you win, you have the choice of either collecting your winnings or
gambling.

If you collect you will then go back to spinning the reels.

If you decide to gamble you  will  have  a choice of three fruits, the

star or the bar which will  be  flashing  on the screen. Just click on
your choice and the next stage will begin.

To the right of the  screen  is  a  spinning  pointer. As you will see
there are more cherries  than  apples,  more apples than strawberries,
more strawberries than stars, and more stars than bars.

If you choose:

A cherry and win, your winnings will double.

An apple and win, your winnings will treble.

A strawberry and win, your winning will be multiplied by four.

A star and win, your winning will be multiplied by five.

A bar and win, your winnings will be multiplied by six.

If you lose then you will go back to spinning the reels.

If you get lucky and win then  you  will have the choice of collecting
or gambling again.


To the bottom left of the screen is the fruit game.

To play this game you must get all the fruit in the following order:

CHERRY, STRAWBERRY, PLUM, TOMATO, APPLE, PEAR.

Whenever you get the next one, it  will be highlighted. But if you win
anything you will lose all the fruit and start again.

Once you have all the  fruit,  the  fruit  game  begins. You will have
noticed that each time you spin the  reels,  a dice is rolled. Now you
must guess if the next roll will be higher, lower or the same. If your
not sure you can always take the cash.

You have two chances at guessing in this game. If you are wrong twice,
you lose. Each time you are  right  an arrow will move along, pointing
to the cash you can take if you think it's too risky.
