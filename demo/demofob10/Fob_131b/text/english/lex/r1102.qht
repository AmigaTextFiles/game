During the World War I, the airplanes were very sensitive to weather conditions; they where not able to fly in a storm at all. Even more sensitive about storms were the zeppelins; in fact, it was only possible to use zeppelins only 26% of the time during the war.
The Navy was also affected by heavy storms, it was difficult to maintain a steady course and conduct battle.
