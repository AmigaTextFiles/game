The blimps were developed to serve two purposes. The first purpose was to observe movements in the enemy trenches. The second purpose was to keep the enemy airplanes at a safe distance so they wouldn't be able to strafe one's own trenches. The blimps in Fields of Battle are used only to help the enemy airplanes from strafing.
