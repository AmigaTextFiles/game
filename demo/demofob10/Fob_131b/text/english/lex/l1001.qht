Tunisia is a state in the middle of North Africa. The country is named by its old capital Tunis, called Tynes by the Romans. In 1861 Italy claimed to be the owners of Tunisia. But in 1878, England and France made a deal, giving France the right to occupy Tunisia. Tunisia remained a monarchy, but under French control. About 80 years had to pass before Tunisia, on the 20th of March 1956, got their independence back.
