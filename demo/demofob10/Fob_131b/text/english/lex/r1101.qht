Snowstorm is the weather type which affects battles most. The strong wind affects the ability of the Air Force, and Army units (especially tanks) are strongly obstructed by the snow on the ground and the limited visibility. Saboteurs, on the other side, can use the snowstorm as a cover, which improves their chance of success. Snowstorms are quite common in Russia during the winter.
