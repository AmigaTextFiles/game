From 1897 to 1916, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was minister of Naval affairs in Germany. He planned the German fleet and his plan was to discourage the English from entering a European war. In 1939 a battleship was named after him; the "Tirpitz" was sunk off the Norwegian coast in 1944 during World War II.
