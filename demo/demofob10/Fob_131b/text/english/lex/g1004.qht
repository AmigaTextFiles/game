The desert areas are rather easily attacked and conquered by Airplanes (5), Zeppelins (5), Nerve Gas (9) and Tanks (4). They are harder to defend because of the hot sun and the burning sand. The best defending units are Soldiers (4), Entrenched (4), Tanks (4) and Airplanes (3).
Deserts most often occur in Africa and the Middle East.
