Most of the spelling and grammatical errors in the Encyclopedea and help
system has been fixed (thanks to Rick Wrigley).

Added historical documents to the Encyclopedea.

Mission 2 is now included in the demo. This mission introduces the 
"spy-concept" which makes the game more challenging since you can't
see enemy forces.

==== Version 1.2 to 1.3 =======================================================

Generel
-------

a) Climate and Weather. (registered version only)

   The concept of climate and weather have now been introduced in a new
   mission "Winter in Russia...".
   
   All areas have a climatic type, based on this climatic type and
   the season of the year the weather condition of the areas is decided
   at the beginnging of each month. The weather conditions then affects
   the abilities of each units attack and defence properties.

b) Toolbar for selecting menuitems.

   It's now possible to open a toolbar, with a button for almost every menu
   item.

c) New look and graphics.

   The online help and encyclopedea now looks much better.

d) Bugs fixed.

   All known bugs in fob have been fixed.

e) Advanced PIF system.

   Popup info fields, when holding the mouse pointer still over icons
   a text field will popup giving you information.

f) Dynamic selection of colors

   Fob now adjusts it's color palette dynamic, this gives better
   looking pictures.

g) Play-By-Mail support

   Fob now supports Play-By-Mail (also e-mail)

Amiga
-----

a) Direct support of special graphics boards.

   The game now uses the CyberGraphics interface standard, to obtain better
   preformance when you have a special graphics board and CyberGraphics
   system installed.
   
   This means:
   
     1) Faster rendering
     2) More colors (256 Colors or 24BIT* true color)

   Using the CyberVision 64 graphics board from phase 5, fob is generely
   a bit faster in 24BIT* true color than it is in Amiga AGA 32 colors. In 256
   colors fob is always much faster.

   *) Min 12MB fast ram. (If you only have 12MB you might want to use
      virtuel memory, eg. setup your system 8MB virtuel memory.)

   Currently we haven't really added some graphics that used these new
   possibilities, sorry.

b) Handling of screen larger than the map.

   If you select a screen larger than the map you get a nice border
   around the map.

c) More colors under AGA

   Now you can select from 16 to 256 colors under AGA. We recommand that
   you use 64 colors, in this mode fob will have 32 fixed colors and 32
   dynamic. Remember more colors need more ram.
