Smart CardZ - by Paul Morley

     Don't have AGA ?  Or you have AGA but no Hardisk ?  I bet you've seen
     Klondike Deluxe AGA on a mates computer, or read a review ?  Why oh
     why isn't there a version for you ?
     Well as luck would have it, there is.  And it's brilliant !  This uses
     converted Klondike cardsets ( From 256-->16 colours ) and looks really
     stunning.
     There's not much really to say, if you want THE Klondike game for
     your computer then get this.  ( Please note, this is a MAJOR update
     from the PD version, CardZ, and we all know how good that is !  Also
     the PD version is no longer supported with cardsets, only this new
     version.  )
     Price - £3.99
