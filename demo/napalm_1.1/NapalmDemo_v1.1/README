NAPALM demo v1.1
================

More preordering prizes added! (see 'WIN $1000' section)


CHANGES SINCE v1.0
==================

- Added smooth scrolling (hold right mouse button and move mouse)
- Right scrolling edge moved to the border of the screen
- Fixed helicopter + tunnel bug
- Fixed crashing bugs
- Improved nitroglycerin deploying
- Fixed doublebuffering on CGFX 320x240
- Ramlib stack fixing is now built into the code
- Added support for 480x360 P96 mode
- NapalmBOOT script added. It reboots Amiga and starts NAPALM. 
  This is the last resort against nasty patching utilities.
  Default screenmode after restart is PAL. If you need to change 
  this edit "Napalm" file (main launch script) and add more 
  "monitor-launch" lines.
- RTGmaster tips by Steffen Haeuser (creator of RTGmaster)
  added to the bottom of this readme file.  clickBOOM would like to 
  thank Steffen for his continuing support.


NAPALM is different than other strategy games, so please 
take a moment to carefully read this file.

1. INSTALLATION
===============
Double click on PrepareLibs before you run Napalm for the first time.
This will copy needed libraries (some of the RTGMaster used are not

2. ABOUT
=========
a) This is NOT a complete manual.  There are a lot of options 
   that will be explained in detail in the manual with the 
   full version of the game.  This text should help you get 
   in the Napalm way of thinking.

b) This demo is beta. Report any bugs to info@clickboom.com

c) There are a few known issues with the demo:
   - In CGFX mode pointer might flicker
   - In CGFX it may appear like a pointer can go to another 
     "screen" below the playing area.

12. MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION FOR SOME OF THE KEYS
==================================================

Num 1-9
-------
Preset map locations allows you to quickly jump 
to 9 locations on the map.
Imagine that those 9 keys are scaled down map, 
7 would take you to the upper left corner,
9 upper right, etc.

Shift Num 1-9
-------------
You can define your own 9 locations by holding 
Shift and pressing Num 1-9

Usage: This combination of keys is very powerful for 
easy controlling of the situation on the battlefield.

G key
-----
If you are engaged in a furious battle somewhere on 
the map, and want newly manufactured units to rush there 
and help, do the following.
- Select the factory with LMB.
- Press G (pointer will change color)
- Click where you want new units to automatically go to.

DEL and HELP
------------
If you want to have units move to a certain location 
for frontal attack or similar, simply go to the target 
location and click DEL to select it.
Then at any time select any number of units and press 
HELP, and they will move to the target location.



13. TIPS
========
- Depending on your CPU and resolution chosen, Napalm might run 
  too fast.  Set "Game speed" from the options menu to a lower value.

- Scroll as little as possible.  Napalm is designed to allow 
  you to have complete control over the battlefield without almost 
  any need for scrolling.  Read about Num 1-9, G, Del and Help keys.

- Unless they have global command (G key), you should always set 
  newly manufactured vehicles to a group (1-0) for easy recall later. 

- Once you set Num 1-9 to your liking it's just a matter of 
  flipping through them and recalling units to move.

- Default "Scroll response" from the option menu is OFF, so the 
  screen will not scroll with mouse.  Change it if you wish to 
  scroll with mouse.

- Send oil driller to the nearest oil field to build an oil tower.
  Then build Refinery and send an oil tanker to the tower to start 
  collecting oil.  It will then automatically go back and forth, 
  making credits for you with each oil shipment brought to refinery.

- Build tunnel entrance.  Then send Tunnel CV (Construction Vehicle) 
  anywhere on the map and deploy it to build tunnel exit. 
  Now, send any troops to your tunnel entrance and soon afterwards 
  they will come out of the exit.  Great surprise tactics, plus you 
  skip damaging troops in sporadic clashes on their way. 
  Tunnel exit is also a part of your base - you can build next to it.
  This creates a whole new dimension to the game.

- Send nitroglycerin vehicle to the enemy base, then deploy it there 
  and watch the fireworks. :)

- Building certain types of buildings will allow you to build yet 
  more new types of buildings (refinery -> light and medium factories).

- What is the loud alert sound after about 8 minutes of gameplay? 
  Warning of the air-attack by the UFO that comes later and tries to 
  destroy your base.  Maybe you should build turrets to defend... 
  ooops, defense is not available in demo. Better get the full game.



14. WHAT'S MISSING
==================
As you can see from the control panel, you can't build most of 
the buildings, and none of the defense options are available.

Some of the things that the full version of Napalm has:
- Upgrade technical level of factories to get new types of units.
- No limitation to the number of any units being built
  (helicopters, nitroglycerin, tunnel CVs, oil tankers, drillers...)
- Engineers can take over an enemy building, so you can manufacture 
  and control enemy troops!
- Defense forces (turrets, machine gun nests...)
- Devastating weapons - nuclear, napalm...
- Fake vehicles, fake buildings to trick the enemy.
- Camouflage vehicles and buildings.
- Play either humans or robots in 1 and 2 player modes.
- CD music
- Sample your own speech and use it as units' response.
- Various missions - spying, protecting/destroying convoys...
- Reinforcements - get more units flown in from a remote base.
- Load and Save missions at any moment.
- Repair units.
- Dismantle units to get credits.
- ...and much, much more.

16. RTGMASTER TIPS BY STEFFEN HAEUSER
=====================================

- It is not needed to disable everything in startup. I always run my 
  rtgmaster programs with full booted OS. The only problems possible are
  from some "unclean" OS-Patches like XLoadSeg or certain MCP-Settings.
  But the tool MCPramlibpatch should fix this problem without making the
  removal of these tools needed.
- As to the PPC problem:

Removing ppc.library is not an Option for A1200 PPC Owners. 
To disable WarpOS Phase 5 put the lib on the FlashROM for this systems. 
Luckily WarpOS 3.1 solves the problem by a OS-Patch:

1. Install WarpOS 3.1 (available at ftp://ftp.haage-partner.com/WarpUP)
2. If a "old" flashrom is used, do

echo >env:powerpc/TERMINATOR "1"
echo >envarc:powerpc/TERMINATOR "1"

3. If a "new" flashrom (ppc.library 46.19 or higher) is used, do 

echo >env:powerpc/TERMINATOR "2"
echo >envarc:powerpc/TERMINATOR "2"
