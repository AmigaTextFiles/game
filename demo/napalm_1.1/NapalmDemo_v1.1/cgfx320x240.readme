If, for some reason, you want to play in CGFX 320x240, 
and not 640x480, please note that the control panel 
icons and pointer location won't match perfectly.
There was no time to fix this in the code, so please 
edit setup/napalm.prefs file (any text editor will do) 
to have PointerFix value 0.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
