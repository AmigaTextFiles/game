To get The Big End CD32 preview demo to work, you need to make an 
assign first


Assign CD0: wherever demo is installed to:

So, if it was in your sys: directory, you would do the following

Assign CD0: sys:TBE/

To boot game simply type 'thebigend' and hit return

This 'should' work on A1200, A4000 and CD32
