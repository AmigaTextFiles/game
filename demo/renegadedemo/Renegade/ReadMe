>>>  Revenge of Renegade  <<<

*****************************




SOME NOTES 
----------


Hi there ! Here's the first game I wrote for our belovedcomputer,I mean the
Amiga. This is only the playable demo of the first level, with his three 
sub-parts and his boss.


Recall you the two wonderful beat'em'ups released for the Amstrad and the C64
many years ago ( "Renegade" and "Target: Renegade" ).
I decided to write the sequel of these two games: "Revenge of Renegade".


I wrote it using AmosPro, but if I could find the French doc. of the Blitz
Basic, I would rewrite a smoother version for two players.

The GFX look pretty bad, because "I" have drawed them, except the sexshop,
which was drawed by my brother.

I have used some piece of tune for the boss and the end sequence, but I
don't know the autors. I hope they wouldn't be too disappointed ;-)
I wrote the other musics.


I'm searching for: 
-graphists (to draw bigger,better characters and some beautiful backgrounds)   
-musicians (so that I can release a game entirely written by the same team.)
-any suggestion to improve the game

Whatever you liked or you hated it, please, let me know on my email:
nordean@usa.net

Because I won't finish it if no one cares :-(


I have to thanks Igor Kouzmine to have learned me so many things, not to say
everything, and to have helped me to code the game.

weapons you can find by killing them.
