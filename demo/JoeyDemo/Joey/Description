                       Welcome to "Joey the Worm"
                       --------------------------

1. The game concept:

The idea of this game is very similar to an old PC-game called "Sokoban".
Your task is to push Grullies (the only food of Joey) to the stock. The
stock is signed with little rhombic symbols on the floor. If you can manage
to push all Grullies in the stock, the level is completed.

2. How to play:

You can move Joey either with Joystick or Keyboard. You can select this in
the main menu.

Using the Keyboard:
 - Move Joey with the cursorkeys
 - Use <RETURN> for extra menu or select the extra functions with
   - F10: Takeback
   - ESC: Return to main menu
   - F1 : Load old game
   - F2 : Save game (only possible if the number near to the disk-symbol
          in the infoline at the bottom of the screen is >0)
 - Press <SPACE> after the code for the next level is shown
 The Keyboard repeat delay (and speed) refers to the preferences.

Using a Joystick:
 Move Joey with a Joystick in Port 1. By pressing the Fire-Button you get
 the extra menu. 
 If you decide to play with Joystick, no Keyboard functions are available
 and vice versa.

3. Game elements:

- Ice Blocks: If you move Joey on an ice block you will skate away until:
              - the ice ends
              - there is a grully on the ice
              If you push a grully on ice, the grully skates away until:
              - the ice ends
              - there is a grully on the ice
              - there is a stock, and the switch is set to "on" 
                (see the element "switches" in this chapter)
                
- Switches : If the switch is "off": 
             - you can push the grullies normally

             If it is set to "on"  :
             - you can`t push a grully down from the stock.
             - it is possible to push grullies in the stock.
             - you see a little sign in infoline at the bottom of the 
               screen.
         
- Teleporters: If you push a Grully on a teleporter, it will appear on the 
               quay. This quay can be in the same room or in an other. This
               is shown in the infoline at the bottom of the screen. If
               there is a Grully on the quay, you can`t move an other on 
               the teleporter.
               
- Doors: It is possible to move via doors to an other room. You start in
         this room at the place with the s-sign on the floor, NOT next to
         the door. Grullies can`t be pushed through doors.       
    
In the Demo-Version there are no switches and no doors.

4. Multitasking:

Joey runs completely under multitasking. The taskpriority is set to 0. If 
you want to switch to the Workbench press left-alt during playing (not in 
the main menu).
It is not adviceable to run other programs while playing Joey.
Press F6 in the main-menu to return to Amiga-DOS.

5. Installing on Harddisk:

Simply move the Joey-drawer from disk to any place of your harddisk.
Please ensure that everything in the c directory of the Joey-Disk is
in the sys:c directory (e.g. muchmore).
Thats all.

6. Demo in the Demo:

If you wait in the main menu until the scrolltext has finished, you can see
5 different introductions of the game elements. Look at these 
demonstrations and you won`t have problems with the game.

7. WB 2.0:

Joey should run under WB 2.0 without any problems. I used only System-Routines
==> under 2.0 the game is a bit faster than under 1.3.
