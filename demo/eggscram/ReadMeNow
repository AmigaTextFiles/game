Requirements-
   
   An amiga computer.   (?)      
   512+ Kb of chip ram. (??)
   A floppy disk drive. (???)
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To Setup The Demo-

      0.Read all of this file!
      1.Format a floppy disk with option OFS (Old File System).
      2.If you haven't already done so,unarchive the files "EDL_DataXX" 
   	(XX=00 to 07) to somewhere.
      3."Assign" the logical name "EDL:" to the directory that you unarchived 
	the files "EDL_DataXX" to.
      4.Insert the floppy disk in DF0.
      5.Run the program "DiskPut",this should then write the demodisk.
      6.Reset
   
   (Playing instructions are a menu option in the game-demo.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The diskput program is very cheap'n'cheerful (wrote in 20 minutes) so
please don't expect too much from it. Ie.It must be started from shell/CLI,it
will try and write the data wether the disk is write protected or not, or 
wether there is actually a disk in DF0!   It shouldn't crash the system though,
(No guarantee given!) but check that the disk is un-writeprotected before 
starting it.Also,once started it won't stop,so *BE CAREFUL*.Please don't use 
it for anything else as this could result in serious disk damage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Demodisk is not AmigaDOS but can be copied by virually any disk
copier.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The full version of the game will take advantage of any extra-ram you
may have cutting down disk-access to only the initial loading.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   If someone wishes to DMS® this demo,feel free,so long as its with a
un-pirated registered copy of DiskMasher® and an unmodified demodisk. 
Copyrights,etc. still hold as per the original archive.
