    Last words from main graphic artist


 Due to lack of time and urgent coder's obligations (he'll be fighting
against terrorism for a while), the demo of SILENCER that you have just
seen has a lot of bugs and there are missing some basic things which we
thought to include. It will all be fixed in the next demo which will be
released in a couple of months. First of all, screen does not scroll when
the character reaches edge of screen, so you'll always have to use CTRL key
while cruising the stage. Some of the map objects are moved or expunged by
main coder, so don't worry if parts of the table can be seen sticking out
the wall or if you find the shadow on place it shouldn't be there. You have
also noticed there is no sound, sound effects nor explosions. Ninety
percent of graphics you see in this early demo will not be present in
final version of the game (it's now present just to show some engine
features). So, be patient. There will be everything in next demo.
Till then, here are some final version features:

 All sound and sound cards support through AHI

 Rendered animations during the game and between the levels

 Graphic cards support

 PPC support

 In a meanwhile, the rest of the team and I will continue to work on graphic
and sound because the major part of code is finished. Send all suggestions
to main coder on: zeks@panet.bits.net or if it is urgent send it to me
(coder won't check his mailbox so often for a while) on:
nknight@tesla.rcub.bg.ac.yu

 I'd like to say thanks to Vojislav Ilic (Abyss) for hardware which made it
possible to finish all graphics in a very short time and to Marko 
Mihailovic (Mikailo) for various help.
