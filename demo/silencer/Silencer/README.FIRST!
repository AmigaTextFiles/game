				SILENCER

Requirments:
lowlevel.library in your LIBS: directory


Silencer is new isometric shoot-em-up game. Early beta demo of its engine
you can see by clicking 'SILENCER' icon but you should know a few things
before it:

There are no enemies or any moving object except main character. At start,
you will see him browsing around rooms by himself, without your control.
When he stops, you can control him using these keys:

CURSOR LEFT:  turn him around
      RIGHT:  turn him around
         UP:  go in direction that he looks to
       DOWN:  don't use, performs one old function

     CTRL:  moves screen in best position depending on direction you look to

ESC:	      exit


You can however pass thru walls (not everytime). It is not a bug, but it is
not fixed because of some graphics solutions we are making daily. Normally,
final game will not have such 'cheats' :)

Source is 100% ASM coded in ~5200 lines. It is planar-gfx optimized (no
c2p) but it is very easy to make chunky gfx (around ~160 lines for planar).

Screen opens under OS in 640x256x256. Final game will have choice of
640x256 and 640x512 in 256 or 16.8M colors. All gfx are rendered in
640x512x24 and later converted.


Control will be of course much better than it is now; lack of
lowlever.library documentation disabled me to improve it :(

It will be a commodity with full SHOW/HIDE/DISABLE/QUIT commands support so
you could control it via exchange of excelent ©Runbar utility.

This engine is developed on:
   A1200/14MHz + 8mb ram + 80mb HD + 14.400 modem  :(   Speed kills, right?
