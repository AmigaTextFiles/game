                                Introduction:
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Perihelion is a strategic space combat simulator.  Your objective  is  to
bring the entire galaxy  under  your  rule  through  military  and  economic
domination.  Troops loyal to your cause must  bring  hostile  planets  under
your control, while massive basestars  defend  your  territory.   Successful
players will amass fleets of warships and support ships as personal  escorts
or to perform independent missions - defending your  territory  or  invading
that of hostile alliances.

   You are responsible both for the piloting and immediate control  of  your
own ship, and for giving orders to the planets, basestars, and ships of your
alliance.  While these will automatically repair themselves, choose targets,
or withdraw from combat, they will defer to you  if  they  are  sufficiently
loyal.

                               Getting Started:
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Upon entering the galaxy, you will be given  a  weak  ship  with  limited
power reserves, weapons, and shield capacity.  One of your first  objectives
should be to locate a merchant base operated  by  the  Galactic  Merchantile
Alliance (GMA).

   The GMA always operates a merchant base in the  cease-fire  zone  at  the
center of the galaxy, and several others dispersed randomly.  At  the  start
of the game you will also find TERRAN and LOKHAR merchant bases,  but  these
do not offer the same range of services as the  GMA.   Later  in  the  game,
alliances controlled by human players may  also  have  constructed  merchant
bases.

   After (D)ocking with a GMA merchant base, you will be able to spend  your
personal credit to purchase a new ship and to enhance your existing systems.
Upgrading to Range 5 sensors and adding hypercoils to increase your movement
range are both advisable.  Each of the available weapons has advantages  and
disadvantages - the best tend to be quite expensive, while the cheap weapons
are generally less accurate and less damaging.  It is also worth considering
that projectile weapons require  projectile  restocking,  but  beam  weapons
require more power.

   Credit, in the form of Standard Monetary Units (SMUs),  is  required  for
these purchases.  If your personal credit runs low, transfer credit from the
alliance account (using the Credit transfer function in the  (U)tility  menu
or while docked).  Additional alliance credit can be obtained through a loan
from the Joint Intergalactic Resource Development Association (JIRDA)  using
the appropriate command in the (U)tility menu.

                          Reinforcing Your Territory:
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Once your ship is sufficiently upgraded for the time being, it is wise to
begin setting up defences  for  your  territory  and  searching  for  nearby
planets to conquer.  The backbone of your defences will be basestars,  which
fire on any hostile targets which enter their range (and permit  your  ships
to dock for  repair  and  restocking,  depending  on  the  basestar  class).
Proximity jammers (which disrupt the targetting systems of hostile objects),
Immobilizers (which hamper the mobility of enemy ships within their  range),
and Gravitic mines (which detonate when  ANY  vessel  passes  over  them  or
emerges from hyperspace adjacent to them) are  also  very  useful.

   All of these objects are deployed  from  your  ship  using  the  (L)aunch
command.   To  build  a  basestar,  for  example,  launch  a  BCU  (basestar
construction unit) at the coordinates where the basestar  should  be  built.
The creation of a class 1 basestar requires 10 turns, and will proceed while
you move on to other tasks (it's a multitasking  universe,  after  all  :-).
Launching additional BCUs at a basestar or basestar construction  site  will
upgrade it to a higher class basestar, provided that a transport relay (also
(L)aunchable) is present within 6 sectors.   The  transport  relay  provides
access to the resources on  your  stockpile  planet  which  are  needed  for
basestar expansion.

                           Going On The Offensive:
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   When you decide to capture a planet that you have found, it is  important
to check that you have soldiers on board (check  personal  status  (R)eport)
and that you aren't making enemies that you cannot deal with.  It  is  wise,
for example, to leave the TERRAN and LOKHAR alliances alone until  you  have
established yourself as a strong player.  Ideally, you  should  look  for  a
neutral planet, as these will be poorly defended and cannot summon  warships
to their defence.  You may wish to (A)ttack the  planet's  orbital  defences
until they are destroyed, preventing the planet from firing on you while you
move in to deploy troops.  Alternatively, you can move in to  deploy  troops
and move back out of planetary weapon  range,  thus  avoiding  the  need  to
repair the planet's orbital defences once you have captured it.  To properly
assess the garrison defending the planet's surface, you must move into orbit
(adjacent to the planet) and use your sensors.  If the garrison is rated  as
larger than "Small-None" you may wish to find an easier  target.   Once  you
are satisfied that your troops can do their job, deploy them on  the  planet
surface with the (B)oard command.  They will immediately engage the garrison
and you will receive turn-by-turn battle updates.  To assist your troops you
may wish to fire on the planet garrison from orbit.  As the game progresses,
planetary defence garrisons tend to be  larger.   Attacking  20,000+  troops
with the 100-400 soldiers which your  ship  can  carry  becomes  unpleasant,
necessitating the use of Invasion Carriers - specialized support ships which
can carry up to 10,000 soldiers each.

                            Administrative Duties:
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The Alliance (U)tilities menu contains a few  options  which  you  should
begin adjusting almost immediately.  Your (P)lanet development  budget  sets
the number of resource units which will be used each  day  to  increase  the
development level of the  planets  you  control.   Since  development  level
determines the quality of the weapon the planet uses to  defend  itself  and
the number of resources, soldiers, ships, or manufactured  goods  (depending
on planet Function) created by the planet, this is quite important.  Try  to
keep the development budget high, but less than your stockpile  -  you  need
to have some resources left at the start of the day for  basestar  upgrading
and weapon projectile synthesis.

   Also keep track of your (I)nter-alliance relations, so that you  remember
who your current allies and opponents are.  You will also wish to  set  your
default posture towards  (N)eutrals.   This  setting  determines  what  your
forces will do when a new player (with whom you have  NEUTRAL  relations  by
default) enters  your  territory.   To  monitor  your  resource  and  credit
expenditures during the previous day use the (F)inancial report command.

                                  Good Luck!
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~
   This should give you enough information to get  started.   Bear  in  mind
that this document is not even close to being complete, however - unless you
have the complete documentation available for  reference,  expect  some  big
surprises :-).  Don't be  afraid  to  dive  in  and  start  looking  around,
however.  Experimentation, combined  with  questioning  of  more-experienced
players, is the best way to learn to play.
