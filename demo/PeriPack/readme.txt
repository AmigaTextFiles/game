~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~
   Perihelion 2.0 is the second formal release of an online game designed to
run on 'BBX' bulletin board systems.  BBX is an  electronic  bulletin  board
system for Amiga  computers  (authored  by  Steve  Tibbett)  which  will  be
commercially  released  almost  immediately,  when  its   documentation   is
complete.

                          The game introduction
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   PeriIntro.DOC is a  relatively  brief  introduction  to  the  game.   The
complete documentation will be enormous (the  text  of  the  Perihelion  1.0
instructions is about 90K, and the 2.0 version will be larger) and should be
available on any BBS which runs Perihelion.

                           The sample pictures
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Hopefully a look at these IFF pictures will give you an idea of what  the
game is like - note that the output displayed is shown using the  Perihelion
custom font, which is freely available and works  with  any  Amiga  terminal
program.  It's just a standard Amiga font with  Perihelion  graphics  added,
after all.  These interlaced screens show the 11 point font, but an 8  point
version is available for non-interlaced screen users.

                         The custom font archive
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   PERIFONT20.LHA is an archive containing both  sizes  of  Perihelion.font.
The included installation script will automate the installation of this font
if you wish.  If you get a chance to try the game, I STRONGLY recommend that
you install and use this font in the game - the  graphics  are  CONSIDERABLY
more attractive than the crude ASCII images.
