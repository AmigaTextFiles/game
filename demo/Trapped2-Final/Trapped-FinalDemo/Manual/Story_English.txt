Trapped II - Reincarnation of the Demons
----------------------------------------

About two generations ago it was your grandfathers who was strong 
enough to fight against the mighty creatures. After a long and hard
fight he was able to get all the piece of the wheel of Talmar, so that
the high priests at Rak Atun could hold the ban on Tarnak for another
1000 years, so the people at Kaldrion could go further with their daily
work.

But something went wrong, Tarnak escaped out of the ban. He killed all
the priests at the temple.

The people of Kaldrion left their homes, lot of them died, while fighting
against the creatures, which came with Tarnak.

He took over the Palace and you are our last hope to defeat the Dark Lord
Tarnak. He is somewhere at the Palace, but noone will be let in, except for
those, who can get their hands on the two eyes of Tarnak. These are some
magical artefacts which will open the entrance to the palace.

So try to find the eyes of Tarnak and kill him, so that we all can go back
to our homes.

Major of Kaldrion
