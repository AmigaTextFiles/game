- F10         = Statistics

In here you will find a lot of more or less interesing statistics about 
your gameplay.


General information:
--------------------
The game is based on the experience point system, this means you will 
get points for every action you do. When you have got enough points you
will gain an experience level and your character values are getting a
little better. 
You mana- and health points will increase, you can run a little faster,
and you are able to attack better.

So it would be useful to have a look at every room in each dungeon to 
get all the points which are possible, so that you player has a maximum
of points, this will make the game a little easier at the end.

You will face lots of different traps and be prepared to come into new
situations every time. 

The amount of spells and the possiblities caused by the spells will let
you find a solution in every situation, just think carefully and you will
be the winner against all those dark creatures.
