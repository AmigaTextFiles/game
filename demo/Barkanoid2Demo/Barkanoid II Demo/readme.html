<p>Overview
<p>
<p>
<p>Barkanoid 2 is a Classic Arcade game that requires quick thinking and sometimes even 
quicker reactions from the player.
<p>
<p> 
<p>
<p>In each level the task of the player is to destroy all tiles on the field by hitting them with 
the playing ball. At the same time he must avoid loosing the ball by navigating his bat at 
the bottom and direct the balls to hit each tile that is still remaining in the level.
<p>
<p> 
<p>
<p>Many new features and various gimmicks will guarantee that this classic game will offer 
many hours of exciting gameplay for the players.
<p>
<p> 
<p>
<p>Barkanoid 2 gives the player the option to choose from three levels of difficulty.
<p>
<p> 
<p>
<p>The Option &#8222;Easy&#8220; was designed specifically with children in mind. Gameplay is much 
easier with the ball movement and monsters being much slower than in normal mode. In 
addition the graphics for Easy mode have been completely redesigned for children with 
very neat characters and by using bright colours.
<p>
<p> 
<p>
<p>Normal mode is aimed at the casual gamer. In this mode some challenging extras such 
as for example end-of-level bosses can be added if desired. In this mode monsters and 
balls will be much more of a challenge for the player.
<p>
<p> 
<p>
<p>Hard Mode was designed with hardcore gamers in mind. The speed of the ball and the 
monsters is much higher and some surprises have been added to the level design, 
making this setting a lasting challenge even for hardcore gamers.
<p>
<p> 
<p>
<p>The levels of Barkanoid 2 are not randomly generated as in many similar arcade 
games. Instead they follow a specific theme for around 10 levels and then move on to 
the next theme. For example: There are 10 levels that follow the theme  &#8222;Computer Age: 
The early days&#8220;, where the player will come across many logos of these days (like Atari, 
Commodore, Schneider etc.). The next theme deals with early computergame heroes 
and the player will come across references to classics such as Loderunner, PacMan or 
Boulder Dash. Some of the later levels do come with a very complex game design, 
where no longer the graphical design is in the centre of attention but the task for the 
player, which is getting increasingly complex.
<p>
<p> 
<p>
<p>The game is extremely easy to configure to the players liking. In the menu he can en- or 
disable features such as weather conditions, end-of-level bosses or even the graphical 
design.
<p>
<p> 
<p>Ball speed is manually changeable, although there is no option inside the game to do it.
To change the speed, open up the config.xml file and find the entry that looks like:
<BallSpeed>5</BallSpeed> Increasing this number will make the horizontal properties of the ball
faster. NOTE: Only use numbers between 0 and 14. 14 is the maximum speed the game allows, we 
recommend staying between 5 and 9 for good gameplay results.
