FaYoh - BETA-version 1.001
Copyright© 1997 NC.Gamez - This game is shareware!



THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!

This game is to bring back some old and happy memories from those of us 
who played games such as 'the Giana Sisters' back in the 80's. It looks 
a lot like tGS actually, wich I think is good :)
   This demo-version contains four levels only, but I think they'll
show you what it's all about! The full version will, ofcource, have
loads of loads of levels!
   We want some respons on this game! If you are the least interested 
in it, you MUST let us know; don't just go around'n thinking that some-
one else will, because they probably do the same!   Send me (Mopz) an 
e-mail, snailmail or whatsoever (not a bomb though). Tell us what you
think of the game. We NEED to know this, as it it no fun making games
for nobody!   If you send us some sort of mail, we will gladly send you
more information about the game when it's ready for the real launch (as
shareware).

KNOWN BUGS...

* An enemy can only move in one dimension (up/down or left/right), so
  if the floor under him sudenly disappers, he will go crazy.

* FaYoh (the main character) can, after dying, pop up on a not-so-well-
  placed-plattform.

* The data of a level is stored in an IFF-brush where every dot repre-
  sents one block. So, any smartass may change the course as he wants!
  This is NOT recomended though, unless you have copies of the original
  brushes.

HOW TO PLAY...

The controll (Joy):
   Up -> Jump
   Down -> Break jump and fall down (WAAA)...
   Left/right -> Walk left/right
   Fire -> Quit game

Enemies:
   Jump on'em if you want to see'em dead. Press joy up when you do this
to make a big jump. Flying enemies (chickens, bats & ghosts), can't die
but you can still use them to jump higher (Use this to reach un-
reachable plattforms).

Jump-pads:
   Like an enemy when you jump on it, just less dangerous.

Cherries:
   Pick'em up! In the full version they'll bring you extra lives when
you have picked 100 of them up.

Coins:
   Eat one, and become imortal (temporary). I think five of them will
bring some sort of a bonus game in the full version!

Diamonds (orwhateveritis):
   There are five of them on each level. If you pick'em all, you will
be presented to some nice 'oneuppies'... in the full version :->

Infinite lives:
   Yes, you can not die (Connor)!   You may loose as many lives you
want to loose. There'll actually be a negative value after some deaths,
but this is just to let you see ALL FOUR included levels!



ALRIGHTYTHEN!..

Yep, I guess that was it! And PLEASE don't forget to send me an e-mail
if you want to see this game in a more propper version!   Sending a
comment will NOT make you haveto register the full version when it co-
mes or anything stupid like that! We just want the response!
