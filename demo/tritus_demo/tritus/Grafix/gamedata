(INSTRUCTIONS)

Each player has a well in which to drop various shapes.  The
aim is completely fill a horizontal row of blocks, which will
then disappear, leaving more space in the well.  Completed
rows also affect the other players...

         <Single> rows push up the others,
         <Doubles> produce green $ slimers,
         <Triples> give assorted tricks,
         <Quads> are especially nasty.*

When you clear a <single> row of blocks, it causes the
blocks in another players well to be pushed up by one.
The player who is the target of all these push ups is called
(the victim) and has a small flashing <(KILL)> sign underneath
their well.* Beside this sign is a timer, which gradually runs
out, and when it does, two white arrows will appear in the
victims well, at which point the victim must choose who is
going to be the next victim by pressing left or right.
Note that the screen wraps around, so that the left player can
choose the right player to be the victim by choosing LEFT, and
vica versa for the right player...**#

When a player is eliminated they face <GAME OVER>, unless
their <bat> is illuminated above their well, in which case
they can play bat and ball for some time and then return
to the game when they are ready by pressing <(fire)>.
However, only one player can use a bat at one time and if two
players are ever eliminated, the game ends and the remaining
player wins.  To win, you must cunningly take advantage of the
opponents mistakes...*

Control is achieved by the joysticks, or by the <(cursors)> and
<(right shift)>, or by <(left alt)>, <(left amiga)>, <(ctrl)> and <(left shift)>.
Computer players will fill in for missing human players and
will play at a level of skill which changes depending on
whether the human players are incompetents or professionals.

<Press fire to start>**#
