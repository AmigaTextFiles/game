    This disk contains a demonstration version of the commercial game
BeBop 'N Drop. BeBop 'N Drop is a real-time graphical arcade puzzle game,
a greatly enhanced version of the popular shareware game Obsess-O-Matic.
The object is to fit the falling pieces together in such a way as to form
complete horizontal rows, which will then disappear off of the board. 
BeBop 'N Drop contains 77 different levels of play, each with a
different shape board. The game contains over 800 different playing pieces,
more than 450K of digitized sound, and many interesting visual effects.
The levels are arranged as 50 one player and 27 two player cooperative.
Each level is mastered when you successfully create and drop the number of
horizontal rows noted on that game level or complete a row containing the 
treasure piece, if one exists.  Visual effects such as fire pieces which burn
through the board, bombs which explode parts of the board, and pile drivers
which compact board pieces enchance game play. 

Refer to the README FIRST!! file for more information and details about
the game. 

I have also included bebop.lzh which can be uploaded freely to all BBS
and bulletin boards.
