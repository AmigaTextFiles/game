{c-- {tSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS} --


The full version of the program comes on four disks and runs on Amiga 500/600
with 1MB. Most of the features, however, can only be accessed from a standard
A1200 with 2MB Chip RAM. Fast RAM and accelerator are strongly recommended,
hard drive installation is possible (4MB required).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{c-- {tMAIN FEATURES} --


- Two aircraft types, the Lockheed F-104 and English Electric Lightning,
  both with full 360° bitmapped cockpit.
- Ten full-screen bitmaps (menu, radars, etc).
- Large overscan display to cover the entire screen.
- High-res-laced display supported (not on this demo).
- The Amiga's narrator.device is used for radio communications.
- The mouse is used extensively for easy control of the program.
- Interactive screen manual for quick access during flight.
- Operational performance data can be displayed in graphical form to make
  direct comparisons between different aircraft types (this is for the more
  technically minded).
- 27 airfields in the UK, western Europe and Mediterranean.
- An extensive range of navigational aids with map.
- 20 or more demo missions.
- 60 or more missions for practise, exercise and combat.
- Weather, atmospheric conditions and time can be changed.
- Ground controlled approach.
- Ground controlled intercept.
- Air combat manoeuvering.

{c-- {tDEMOS} --


{c{h1 -- F-104 DIAMOND NINE FORMATION}

Nine F-104 in formation display the programs ability to handle large numbers
of aircraft. This demo requires an A1200.


{c{h2 -- F-104 SUPERSONIC FLY PAST}

Two aircraft blasting over Leuchars tower, turn the volume on for this.


{c{h3 -- F-104 GROUND CONTROLLED APPROACH}

An F-104 on 'talkdown' to runway 27 at Leuchars, you can access this feature
yourself, see below.


{c{h4 -- F-104 PAIRS TAKE-OFF}

A pairs take-off and fly-by on a dull evening with cloudbase at 1500ft.


{c{h5 -- F-104 FREE FLIGHT WITH 1500LB FUEL}

This puts you at the controls of a Belgian Air Force F-104G, 1500lb of fuel
should last for about 20 minutes if you don't use to much reheat.
Try the radio communications:
	Switch to mouse pointer mode (ALT-LEFT), move the pointer to the
	top right of the display - the communications window appears.
	Click >Ask for weather<, wait for a reply by the approach controller
	and >Acknowledge< when flashing.
If you are familiar with the controls and ready for something more exciting,
try a ground controlled approach:
	Select talkdown on channel 3. The communications channel can be
	changed on numeric keypad {h/} and {h*} or by clicking on >Channel<,
	right mouse button for up, left button for down.
	Click on >Ask for GCA< and follow the instructions of the talkdown
	controller.
	Remember to put flaps (C and V) and undercarriage (G) down before
	6 miles, final approach speed is 170-160kts at 85-87% rpm.
The approach can be monitored on the approach radar (F10 and numkey 3) from
about 13 miles.

{c-- {tFLYING CONTROL} --


The mouse controls elevator and ailerons, the mouse buttons are used to set
rudder and to steer while taxiing on the ground. An A4-Size area is needed
for full travel of aileron and elevator and the mouse should be placed just
above the centre of this area as the elevator has to travel further up than
it is to go down.
All other major controls are located on the left side of the keyboard and
should be operated with the left hand while the right hand can remain with
the mouse for most of the time. Sorry, if you are left handed, but this is
just how aeroplanes are.
Flying an aeroplane by mouse might seem to be slightly odd at the beginning,
but after an initial learning phase all manoeuvres can be flown with extreme
precision. Move the mouse slowly, do not attempt erratic manoeuvres before
you know what the result will be. Remember that the response of an aircraft
is sharper at high speeds and low level than at low speeds and high level.

{hAMIGA-LEFT}	- Aileron centre function. This key moves and holds ailerons
		in a neutral position and is very useful in a rapid pull-up
		manoeuvre or when resetting the mouse.

{hCTRL}		- Amongst many extended functions this key also stops all
		elevator, aileron and rudder movement and can be used to hold
		the controls while moving the mouse to a comfortable position
		if it has been upset to much in a sharp manoeuvre.

{hTAB} and {h`}	- Throttle movement, as seen on throttle position indicator.

{hA} and {hZ}		- Airbrakes in and out. Movement can be seen on the airbrakes
		position indicator.

{hS} and {hX}		- Wheel brakes and wheel brakes lock.Brake pressure increases
		when >S< is pressed and decreases as the key is released.
		Any given brake pressure can be sustained if >S< and >X< are
		both held down simultaneously. The wheel brakes indicator
		shows the level of brake pressure. Once it has reached 100%
		key >X< locks the brakes for parking. Unlock with >S< or >X<.

{hD} and {hC}		- Trailing edge flaps up and down.Selection and actual travel
		can be seen on the flaps position indicator.
		Trailing edge flaps are also refered to as landing flaps.

{hF} and {hV}		- Leading edge flaps up and down for F-104 aircraft.Selection
		and travel can be seen on the flaps position indicator.
		Leading edge flaps are also refered to as take-off flaps.

{hG}		- Undercarriage up and down selector.The undercarriage status
		is indicated by the undercarriage lights:
		All out .......	all wheels up and locked.
		Red light .....	gear is travelling.
		Three greens ..	all down and locked, safe to land.

{hB}		- Brake chute release. There is no cockpit indication to show
		if the chute has streamed or not, but it can be seen by using
		the arrow keys or F3 and F4 to look back.
		The chute is jettisoned by pressing key B again.

{c-- {tVIEW CONTROL} --


All view controls can be accessed from the keyboard and by mouse. For mouse
control switch to pointer mode (ALT-LEFT) and move the pointer to the top
left of the display. A view control window appears, all highlighted items
are active.
Number 1, 2 and 4 of the demos use automatic view control during some stages
and manual view control is blocked.

{hARROW KEYS}	- to move view angle in cockpit and outside.

{hESCAPE}		- look up.

{hF1/F2}		- look forward left/right.

{hF3/F4}		- look behind left/right.

{hF5}		- return to cockpit forward view.

{hF6}		- switch to outside view.

{hF7}		- switch to spot view. 

{hF8}		- switch to track view. This function allows you to track
		any participating aircraft.

{hF9}		- displays the map.

{hF10}		- switches to the control room.
Numeric keypad:	{h1} for surveillance radar.
		{h2} for approach radar.
		{h3} for aircraft movements.
		{h-} decrease range of surveillance radar (min.10nm).
		{h+} increase range of surveillance radar (max.80nm).
		{h(} and {h)} to change to another airfield.
		{h/} and {h*} to track another aircraft.
		Selections can also be made by clicking on items in
		the display area.

{c-- {tSYSTEM SETUP} --


On the demo version most switches are set by the system but you can experiment
with a variety of preferences and options:

		>MIN<		- for 1MB A500/A600

		>LOW<		- for 2MB A1200

		>MED,HIGH,MAX<	- for upgraded systems.

{c!! Note !!

{cSome selections for the system setup have no effect on this demo.

{c-- {tADDITIONS} --


1. The third and final JETPilot demo has been tested successfully on a wide
range of Amigas (including 68060). All problems with the first and second
demos have been fixed and frame rates have been greatly improved.
However, it is advisable not to run any other tasks with JETPilot,
especially not on unexpanded systems (i.e. with less than 2MB FAST-RAM).

2. Test runs with a 1260 accelerator have produced up to 25 fps at >LOW<
settings and 10-16 fps at >MED-HIGH<, the demo has been limited to 16 fps.
Frame rates for the LACED display (704*544, only with full version) drop
to 8-10fps at >LOW< settings.

3. Only the full version supports analogue joystick. A joystick calibration
function has been added on this demo to check compatibility. To get adequate
feeling x and y axis min-max should be 0-100 or better.
When using mouse a range of ±700 is used and control is very precise indeed.

4. Program should recognize DBLNTSC or DBLPAL Workbench. A 'DBL' indicator
should light up on the system screen. The demo supports only LORES but
HIRES LACED display is possible with the full version (if AA and FAST RAM).

5. Frame rate can be displayed on top left in all view modes. The upper
value represents the last frame, the lower value is an average of the last
four frames.

6. The 16 colour option is only useful on low-spec machines and should not
be used with SCENERY DETAIL set above >LOW< as this leads to false colours.

7. There is no building or aircraft collision detection on the demo.
