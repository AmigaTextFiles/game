Slipstream demo release notes
-----------------------------

Info

Slipstream (a temporary title) is an attempt at a fully-fledged Wipeout
clone for the Amiga.  It uses some funky techniques to get some really
fast texture mapping out of the humble Amy, and doesn't cut too many
corners when it comes to visual effects either.  Just check out the
features list -

  100% texture mapped graphics
  Multiple texturing routines
  Lighting effects
  Tunnels
  Shadows
  Translucency effects
  Rotating bitmapped backdrops
  Dynamic craft physics (e.g. for moving tracks)
  Arbitrary camera angles
  Multiple screen modes (all AGA for the moment)


How to run the demo

Make sure the current directory contains the file 'test4.track'.  Then
type slipstream1x1, 1x2 or 2x2 according to the pixel size you want.  2x2
mode uses a blitterscreen-style display, and is recommended for anything
below a 50Mhz 68030.  1x2 and 1x1 use one of Peter McGavin's publically
available chunky to planar conversion routines (with some minor
modifications), and are probably better for very fast machines.  It is
suggested that you try them all out just to see how they run on your
machine...


About the demo

This is a work-in-progress demo.  The actual game (if I get time to finish
it) may or may not be shareware, and may or may not get a PC port..  who
knows...?  It really depends on how much time I have spare in which to do
it.  You never know, it may get finished one day...
