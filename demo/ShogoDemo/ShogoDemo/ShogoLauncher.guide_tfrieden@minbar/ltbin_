@{fg shine}Welcome to Shogo! @{fg text}

Welcome to the Shogo Launcher application. This program wants to make starting the main program easier for you. There are quite a lot of options, but you won't have to change most of them - they're set to reasonable defaults. If you are lost, you can press the help key at any time to access this online help.

The launcher application has seven register pages. Register pages are accessed by clicking the left mouse button on the appropriate tab along the top of the window, or by pressing the underlined letter on your keyboard. Pages are grouped by functionality, for example the "Sound" tab gives you access to the sound settings for the game.

You can access the appropriate help pages by changing to that page and pressing the help key, or select one from the menu below. You are currently viewing the help entry for the "Shogo" tab.

    @{"Display settings   " link DISPLAY  }  Select the video mode
    @{"Sound settings     " link SOUND    }  Change settings for in-game sound
    @{"Advanced settings  " link ADVANCED }  Special tweaking options for professionals
    @{"Memory settings    " link MEMORY   }  Options to reduce memory consumption
    @{"OpenGL settings    " link OPENGL   }  Special options for the hardware renderer
    @{"Customize          " link CUSTOMIZE}  Options for Game Addons

At the bottom of the window, you will find two checkboxes and a row of buttons. The checkbox "Always show this dialog" will ensure that every time you start Shogo, you will be presented with this settings dialog. If you uncheck this, the launcher will take you directly to the game instead. This is useful once you have fully configured the game, and don't want to do any further tweaks. To re-enable the launcher, click on the "Shogo" icon on your workbench and select "Information" from the icon menu. In the Tooltypes list, find the line "(POPUP)" and remove the brackets, then press save. The next time you launch Shogo, you will see the launcher again.
The second checkbox is labelled "Tooltips". If this is checked and you leave your mouse pointer over a gadget, a small help bubble will pop up with a description of the gadget you are currently on. This tooltip will vanish as soon as you move the mouse.

The buttons at the bottom have obvious functions. Pressing "Launch Shogo" will launch the game into the main menu. From there on you can decide if you want to start a single- or multiplayer game, or want to play an addon or custom level. If you are sure that you want to directly go to a multiplayer game, you can press the "Multiplayer" button which will take you directly to a different dialog that allows you to log into a server, or start a server yourself.
The function of the help button is probably pretty clear...

Finally, pressing the close gadget or the "Quit Shogo" button will get you back to workbench. Note that if you quit this dialog without launching Shogo, your current settings will not be saved.

@node DISPLAY "DISPLAY"
@next SOUND
@{u}@{fg fill}Display@{fg text}@{uu}

The "Display" page allows you to select a screen mode in which you want to play. The left list box ("Available Renderers") lists the rendering modules that are available. The "Software" renderer is an unaccelerated software-only solution that works on all systems that are equipped with a CyberGraphX (tm) or Picasso96 (tm) compatible graphics card. This should be your selection if you don't have, or don't intend to use the Warp3D accelerated renderer.
Depending on your setup, one or more additional modules should appear in this list. Most likely you will find a line reading "Permedia 2 (mgl.ren)" or "Voodoo 3 (mgl.ren)". Those are hardware renderers, meaning they will take advantage of any available 3D graphics card in your system that is compatible with the Warp3D (tm) 3D Hardware driver system. Select one of those to play with hardware acceleration.

@{b}NOTE:@{ub} It is highly recommended that you use the hardware renderer modules if available. Shogo will look @{i}much@{ui} better with 3D hardware support enabled.

The right-hand list displays all available resolutions that the selected module in the left list can handle. There is usually a set of restrictions as to what a renderer can handle, for example, the software renderer needs a 15 or 16 bit big-endian display to work correctly - the "PC" modes (little endian) will not work. Likewise, certain 3D hardware might impose additional restrictions on the display. Selecting one of these screenmodes will set this mode to be used in future Shogo sessions.

The checkbox below the lists switches between screen and window mode. If unchecked, Shogo will launch on a window on the default public screen, otherwise it will open its own screen. It is advisable to use fullscreen mode, since this makes playing with the mouse much easier (you don't have to worry keeping the mouse in the window etc.).

@node SOUND "SOUND"
@next ADVANCED

@{u}@{fg fill}Sound@{fg text}@{uu}

This page lets you configure the sound settings. These may be quite tricky, so it is advisable to read this entire page, even though it might be long.

This page is divided into three parts:

@{b}@{fg shine}General Sound Preferences@{fg text}@{ub}

@{b}Audio Channels@{ub}: This specifies the maximum number of sounds that can play at once. The more channels are playing, the more CPU load this will produce. It is therefore advisable to leave this setting at 8-10 for a 60e/166. For faster machines, this can be raised to about any value, up to the maximum of 32.
@{b}Low Sound quality@{ub}: Shogo features high-quality 16 bit sound effects, however, these take up a considerable amount of memory. Furthermore, 16 bit sound will be more CPU-intensive than 8 bit sound, especially on low-spec machines with a 040/25 M68K CPU. If you check this box, sounds will be converted to 8 bits upon loading, which will both save memory and give a bit more speed, although the speed increase isn't so severe.

@{b}@{fg shine}AHI Preferences@{fg text}@{ub}
@{b}Unit@{ub}: The unit slider will select which AHI playback unit to use. The parameters are usually configured in the AHI preferences program. Set the slider to a free unit (most programs use unit 0, so 1 or 2 would be a good choice), start the AHI prefs program, and configure this unit accordingly. A soundcard is preferrable, but not required. Shogo sound is at 22050 Hz usually (unless mixing frequency is set to "low", see next entry), so the AHI prefs for that unit should not be set higher than that. The mode needs to support panning (i.e it should have a "++" in its name).
@{b}Mix Frequency@{ub}: This gadget has two settings: High and Low. If set to low, samples will be mixed at 11 Khz instead of the default 22 Khz ("high"). Set this to low if you have a low-power CPU like 603/166, otherwise it is save to leave it on "high".
@{b}Mixahead amound@{ub}: This settings is tricky to understand. Non-techies should set it to 2048 if the Mix frequency is "high", and to 1024 if the mix frequency is "low" (see previous item). If you insist on knowing what this does, read @{"this" link Mixahead}.

@{b}@{fg shine}Streaming sounds@{fg text}@{ub}
@{b}Ambient sound@{ub}: The term "streaming sound" refers to sound files that are not loaded into memory but rather read from disk on-the-fly ("streamed"). Streaming sounds free memory (since they are usually quite large), but incurs an overhead due to the disk access required. If you're playing off an IDE disk with no DMA capabilities, then streaming sounds will have an impact on CPU performance. Therefore this gadget gives you the opportunity to suppress certain types of sounds:

- Play all ambient sounds     
  Plays all ambient sounds. Use this if you have a fast
  CPU and fast SCSI harddisk

- Play only memory-resident ambient sounds
  Plays only those ambient sounds that are in-memory. Streaming sounds
  are not played. Note that this does not affect voiceovers. Speech will
  also be streamed, but you will hear it regardless of the settings.

- Play no ambient sounds
  Does not play any ambient sounds. Since ambient sound usually carries a
  lot of atmosphere, you should not select this unless your system is
  really slow or Shogo becomes unplayable when a lot of sound happens.

@node Mixahead "Mixahead"
@{fg fill}Warning@{fg text}
This is highly technical, and is not needed to play Shogo. If you're technically interested, read on. Otherwise you might skip this paragraph.

Since most hardware does only support a few channels of audio reply, Shogo does emulate more channels by sample mixing. This works by adding all values that would be played simultaneously on different channels into one channel (actually two for stereo replay, left and right). This "sound render buffer" is then fed to the audio hardware as if it was just one sample being played at the time, although the impression for the listener will be of multiple channels playing at one time.
The CPU cannot do this on a sample-by-sample basis. Therefore it will mix sound for a few milliseconds ahead of time. The amount of data mixed ahead of time is what you can select with the Mixahead amount slider.

Raising this value will mix more samples ahead of time, and generally result in less CPU consumption since the context switch that is required to output the sound buffer comes more infrequent. On the downside, mixing ahead of time will pose a problem since a new sound (for example a gunshot) can only be started once the current mixahead buffer (or "fragment") has finished. A large mixahead will introduce a noticable lag in sound, making it appear as if the sound of the gunshot comes a few fractions of a second after the muzzle flash.
Lowering this value will mix fewer samples, which will greatly reduce the lag, but will make the context switch more frequent.

@next MEMORY
@{fg fill}Advanced Settings@{fg text}

Attention: These settings are very sensitive. You should only meddle with these if you know what you are doing, or are a generally adventurous person.

There are four groups on this page, "Disable" contains checkboxes to disable features, while "Enable" contains switches to enable certain features. We will cover these in more detail below.
The "Restore" group only contains the gadget "Restore factory Settings". This will re-set most of the custom settings back to the default settings with which the game ships. If Shogo ever refuses to load, you should try checking this one first.
The "Command line" group contains a string gadget where you can enter additional command line options. None of these are documented here, though. Checking the "Always specify these command-line parameters" box will save these settings and make them available in subsequent Shogo sessions.

The "Disable" section contains the following switches:
Disable sound 		    Disables all sound effects in the game
			    except for the music
Disable music 		    Disables CD Music
Disable menu music	    Disables the looping sound in the game's
			    menu and during load. This will speed up the
			    loading process.
Disable movies		    Disables the playback of intro movies
Disable light mapping	    Not available at the moment
Disable fog		    Not available at the moment
Disable line systems	    Do not draw line systems in the hardware renderer.
			    This will slightly speed up the renderer.
Disable model full brights  Disables the model full brights in the hardware renderer.
			    This makes the game work a bit faster, since the effect
			    requires more rendering passes.
Disable joysticks	    Disables the joystick controls

The "Enable" section contains the following switches:
Enable poly gap fixing	    Tries to avoid cracks in polygon meshes. This will
			    slow the game, although not severely. Enable this
			    if you experience cracks and holes in some areas.
Enable triple buffer	    not supported in the Amiga version. Triple buffering
			    is always enabled.
Enable T junctions	    Enables the use of T-Junctions in poylgon meshes.
			    This might slightly degrade performance, but will
			    also avoid cracks.

@endnode

@node MEMORY "Memory"
@next OPENGL
The memory page contains controls to adjust file buffers and caches.
Since the Amiga does not have virtual memory, Shogo tries to keep memory usage low by removing stuff that is not needed at the moment as soon as memory consumption goes beyond a certain limit. The @{b}Caches@{ub} controls let you adjust these levels.
@{fg text}Sound Cache@{fg text} specifies how many Kilobytes of sound data the game will keep in memory until old data is thrown out. If set to zero, the caching is disabled; otherwise the game will not allow to have more than this setting of sound data in memory at any one time.
@{fg text}Texture Cache@{fg text} is the same thing, only for Texture data. Keep in mind that there is generally more sound in a Shogo level than textures, so if in doubt, assign more memory to the sound cache.

@{b}File buffers@{ub} are a means to bring down loading times by avoiding context switches. This is done by reading ahead of time instead on a per-usage basis. File buffers greatly reduce loading time at the expense of additional memory requirement. There are three file buffer settings, for Model files, Sound files and for all other files.
The default values are already reasonable, you should only enlarge these if you have enough memory (that is, if you have more than 64 megabytes of main memory).

Finally, the @{b}Precaching@{ub} controls will allow you to specify what or how much is loaded upon entering a level. The cycle gadget allows four different settings:

@{fg shine}Preload everything@{fg text} preloads every file that the game will need for the level. This also includes seldom used stuff, but will make sure that there is no loading during the game itself except for streamed sounds.

@{fg shine}Preload models@{fg text} only preloads models. Models take quite long to load, and loading models in game results in a considerable lag during the game, possibly at a critical point. Model preloading is highly recommended.

@{fg shine}Preload to cache limit@{fg text} will load data (Models, textures and sounds) up to the specified cache limits. If those cache limits are set to zero, it is essentially the same as "preload everything". Otherwise, it will load "a bit of everything" to keep in-game loading at a minimum.

@{fg shine}Preload nothing@{fg text} will not preload anything. The result is a very short level load time, but the in-game lagging will probably be unbearable, so this setting should be avoided.

The @{fg shine}Conserve memory when changing levels@{fg text} checkbox will, when checked, force the game to cache out (i.e. delete from memory) everything it has loaded for the current level. Normally, this stuff is kept in memory as long as possible to cut down loading times between levels. With this checkbox set, the memory required to run Shogo will be significantly reduced, but the loading will take significantly longer. You should avoid setting this unless you frequently run out of memory when changing levels.

@node OPENGL "OpenGL"
@next CUSTOMIZE
The settings on this page only affect the hardware renderer.

@{fg shine}Use software blits@{fg text} disables the use of hardware texture functions for blitting surfaces to the screen. This saves main and video memory, but is generally considerably slower than hardware blitting. However, on graphics cards with only 8 MB of memory, this might introduce additional swapping.
@{fg shine}Switch off HUD drawing@{fg text} disables the Headup display. You won't have any control about your ammo or health, but on slow machines it will have a considerable impact on performance.
@{fg shine}Reduce in-game texture animation@{fg text} reduces the number of frames that texture animations display. If this is set, every other frame of texture animations will be dropped to save memory.

@endnode

@node CUSTOMIZE "Customize"
The "Customize" section will allow you to load addon modules and custom levels. The left listbox shows all available REZ files. REZ files are files that contain one or more additional levels, textures, models, and other stuff. Most addon modules are distributed as REZ files to allow them to be integrated easily into the game.

To load a REZ file highlight it and press the @{bg fill} Add > @{bg back} button. This will move it from the left to the right listbox. Those REZ files in the right listbox will be loaded upon startup.

To remove a REZ file from the active list press the @{bg fill} < Remove @{bg back} button after highlighting the REZ file in the Active list.

Checking the "Always load these REZ files" checkbox will save the contents of the Active list and automatically loads those at the start of the next session.
