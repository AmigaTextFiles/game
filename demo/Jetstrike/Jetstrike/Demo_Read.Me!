 This demo is just a 10 level sample of the full Jetstrike game.
 The full version of Jetstrike contains:
 
 Over 100 different missions,
  40 different aircraft,
   40 weapons systems,
    Auto enhancement for systems with more memory,
     Hard disk installation,
      Fully compatible with all Amigas (automatically resizes for NTSC and
       PAL displays).
        Mission disks to be released in 1994 to add further missions,
         aircraft and weapons.


 The Plot

 The last you heard from 009 was just after he had infiltrated a meeting of
SPUDD (Society of Particularly Undesirable Dastardly Dudes: a secret
organisation made up of arms dealers, mad dictators, psychopaths and 
traffic wardens). The coded message that he sent you was along the lines of:

 "SPUDD planning to take over the
    entire world.
       Let's do lunch.

               Cheers,009".

 Unfortunately, when you arrived at Chez Bond for your lunch and secret 
agent's meeting, you found 009 slumped over the menu with a knife
in his back. To cap it all, the steak was under-cooked !
 MI5, the FBI, NASA, the KGB, MOSSAD and even top secret agents from the 
North Beckinsdale Pigeon FancierUs Association swung into action 
immediately. They were swiftly halted in their tracks when they received 
a top level order warning of a massive campaign of bribery of government 
officials in all countries. It appeared that any overt attempt to destroy 
SPUDD would result in the downfall of most of the world's governments. 
SPUDD-controlled leaders would soon rise to replace them.
 As the situation has worsened by the day, and SPUDD's forces have grown 
from strength to strength, the various agencies have now put together an 
underground task force which they hope will combat the growing threat.
This elite task force comprises one agent (yourself - nice of you to 
volunteer by the way), a highly trained mechanic called Harry, and a field 
support officer to assign missions.  The plan is that you will "borrow" 
aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on 
SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden. 
 Hopefully, by damaging their supply lines, factories and control centres,
you should be able to ruin their plans of world domination. 
 However, if you wreck too many expensive aircraft, your sponsors will not
be able to cover for you, resulting in your sent back to the secret agent's
Basic Training School.

 If you are using a joystick which has multiplefire buttons wired separately 
(for example, the Sega control pad), then you can use the second button in 
Jet Strike.The second button can be assigned to copy the action of any of the 
keys on the keyboard (as a default it is U - undercarriage up / down)
but, by pressing B and then the key you want to assign to the button, it will
become a duplicate of that key. For instance, if you want the second button 
act as a pause key press B followed by P.

WARNING... U.S Amiga users, Some of the American SEGA GENESIS joypads have
been reported as causing damage to some Amigas when connected. Do not use
these joypads.


Learning To Fly (a crash course!)
 The aircraft in Jet Strike fly just like real aircraft (sort of), so the 
first thing that you will have to do is learn how to fly !
Select Training 1 (Landing) from the Games Selection Screen. You will then 
see the Aircraft Selection Menu. Move the pointer to the aircraft on the
top-left of this screen (the Goshawk 200 Trainer) and press Fire.

 The main control in Jet Strike is the Joystick:Pushing the Joystick up
rotates the aircraft anti-clockwise. Pulling it down rotates it clockwise.
 This system may seem a little strange, but once learned it allows you to 
control the aircraft with an amazing degree of accuracy. Fortunately, you 
have ten training missions and an infinite number of aircraft to get use to 
this system.

 The aircraft's throttle (speed) is controlled by moving the stick left 
(to slow down) and right (to speed up). Alternatively, you can press the 
keys from 1 (engine idle) through to 0 (Full throttle) on the top of your 
keyboard. When you start training, the Autothrottle is switched on, to
automatically control your speed. To switch it off, press the Left Amiga key.

There are a few other keyboard controls which are used throughout the game.
 Probably the most important of these is the Spacebar which is the ejector
seat (or bail out) control which will allow you to get out of the aircraft
in a major hurry. While you are in training you won't have to worry about 
this too much as the three aircraft available to you are each fitted
with automatic ejector seats. This means that when you crash, you will
automatically be ejected from the aircraft - hopefully to safety.
 However, as no escape method is foolproof we may at some point have to 
scrape you off a runway!
Let's return to our first Training Mission and the Goshawk 200.You should,
by now, be on the runway and ready to go. Hold the joystick to the right.
The engine will speed up to full throttle and the Hawk will start rolling
down the runway. Once the aircraft is going fast enough, slowly pull 
the stick down. The aircraft will now pull up off the runway and start 
rotating clockwise. Once it is pointing upwards stop pulling the stick back
and it will gain altitude. Now is a good time to pull up the undercarriage 
by pressing the U key. A message will come up on the screen to tell you 
that the wheels are now up. (If you press U again, the undercarriage will go 
back down and so on.)
 You can check your height by looking at the radar display in the bottom 
right of the screen - the white flashing dot is your aircraft and a white
line shows where your runway is.

 Once you have gained some altitude you can experiment and get used to the
rotation of the aircraft (Joystick up/down) as well as the throttle control
(Joystick left/right). If you should lose too much speed the aircraft will
stall and start to fall. 
 To gain speed simply throttle up (Joystick right) or you could try making
the aircraft dive until it is going fast enough not to stall (but watch out
for that solid green stuff !) Your airspeed is shown in the display on the 
left of the screen. As an added safety feature for trainee pilots, 
there is an automatic pilot on the training aircraft. Pressing the A key 
will toggle this on and off.  While this is on (and you still have some 
fuel left) the aircraft will automatically pull up before crashing.
The Automatic Pilot will also prevent the aircraft from stalling.

 Landing is the difficult bit! Fortunately for you, most of the aircraft in 
Jet Strike have a built in fly-by-wire landing system.  To use this put the
undercarriage down (press U) and then hold down Fire on the Joystick.
 When the undercarriage wheels are down pressing Fire kicks in the 
fly-by-wire system. While Fire is held down, the aircraft automatically 
adjusts itself to the correct angle of attack and speed to land softly(ish).
All you have to do is to line the plane up with the runway (this might 
require some practise!)
 If you get it right, you will touch down on the runway. You'll notice
that any buildings over your runway are "in the background" so you can't 
crash into them. Once you have landed hold the joystick to the left and
the aircraft will slow to a halt. Your Commanding Officer will now come 
out and congratulate you on finishing your first mission. Landing can be 
tricky and you might not get it right the first time around. If you
should write off your plane ignore the sarcastic comments from Harry, the
flight mechanic, and get back into the air again!

A few tips on landing and surviving

Most of the helicopters and light aircraft, as well as the Harrier are
able to land on grass, although it must be flat (no craters) and the 
aircraft will tend to bounce a bit on landing. Amphibious aircraft, such 
as the Grumman Goose can also land in the water, as long as the 
undercarriage is UP.If your undercarriage should become damaged you can 
attempt to crash-land the aircraft. You should come in very slowly and 
carefully, landing on any flat area (grass, runway or water). This is a 
risky business and you should be ready to eject as the aircraft may explode
or flip over.
 If you hit the runway too hard in a normal landing the undercarriage might
collapse leaving you skidding towards oblivion.
 If, for any reason, you feel that a landing is either impossible or too 
risky you should eject from the aircraft. If you do this you will probably 
survive.
 Some aircraft are not fitted with ejector seats. With these you must either 
gain enough altitude before you bail out (to give your parachute time to open)
or fly very low over water and jump out: if you are low enough - you will
survive (maybe)!


 Using Weapons

 Once you have completed your first take off and landing, you will move onto
weapons training. Your first task is to bomb a target which is indicated by
an orange line on your radar screen. (This mission is not in this demo)
At the start of each mission, a message will appear on the screen indicating 
what ammunition Harry (your ever vigilant mechanic) has loaded onto your 
aircraft. Gun ammo is nearly always loaded. You can normally carry two other
weapons on the hardpoints or in the bomb bay of your aircraft.
 Usually, two weapons will be selected for you at the start of each mission
and loaded into the two weapons systems. These are referred to as left weapon
and right weapon, not because they are on the left wing and right wing
(if they were, the aircraft would probably tip over) but because they are 
fired by pressing Fire and moving the joystick left (to fire the left 
weapon) or right (to fire the right weapon). Pressing Fire without the stick
right or left fires the guns. These can be used to shoot at virtually
anything, although different aircraft have different guns with differing 
fire-powers.
 If you don't like using the joystick right / left Fire method, bombs can 
be dropped using the keyboard. You  can drop bombs by pressing the right
Amiga key and right Alt key to fire the two weapons. If you want to use 
different weapons from those selected by Harry (from the 40 different types 
of bombs, missiles and rockets), pull down on the joystick when the aircraft
has stopped on the runway.  You'll now see a screen showing an inventory of
some of the weapons available. (The rest can be seen by clicking on the 
arrow button). Click on the items that you want as your left and right 
weapon and then click on DONE.
 You can also, at this stage, pick a different aircraft. To do this, click
on NEW PLANE.
 As each weapon has its own characteristics, you should try out as many as 
you can while you are in training. Some weapons cannot be carried by 
training aircraft. These you will have to try out later on.
 Air-to-air missiles cannot be fired without locking them onto an enemy 
aircraft. When locked on, a box will appear on the screen in the direction 
of the aircraft, at this stage you can fire any long- or medium-range 
missiles (such as Phoenix, AMRAAM, Sparrow and Skyflash) at the enemy 
plane. When a diamond appears in the box, you can fire short-range 
missiles (such as Stinger and Sidewinder) or your gus at the opposition.

 A similar system is used when attacking ground targets. A smaller box 
will appear in the direction of the ground target which you have locked 
on to. You can fire air-to-ground weapons without locking on - but some 
of them will just fly off unguided.
 With simple bombs you don't need a lock on - just drop them!


Helicopters

 Once you have finished your training in the "normal" aircraft, try learning
to fly a helicopter. One is available to you in Training Mode, the Wessex.
(In this demo the Huey is available)
 Helicopters are flown differently from the jets in this game, their controls
are far easier to use:
 Pushing the Joystick up makes the helicopter go up, Joystick down makes it
go down, Joystick left makes it fly to the left and Joystick right makes it
go to the right.
 The Wessex and most other helicopters have fixed undercarriages - so you 
don't need to use the U key. Helicopters don't have auto-pilots - they're 
easy enough to land without help!
 Helicopters are particularly useful when you need to rescue someone from a 
small space, or from a site where a jet wouldn't be able to land. If it is
a designated rescue helicopter you will be provided with a winch-man to 
haul up downed pilots, secret agents, scientists and whoever else happen 
to be in the thick of it.
 In combat, they're able to hover over an area and plaster it with unguided 
rockets. Some of the more advanced helicopters such as the Apache and 
Werewolf along with Vertical/Short Take Off and Landing (VSTOL) jets such 
as the Harrier can be controlled as both helicopters and as "normal" aircraft. 
 This offers you all the hovering capability of a helicopter along with the
ability to do high-speed aircraft manoeuvres. 

 Enjoy playing this demo of Jetstrike, the full game is available from your
local computer store from November 25th 1993.
