                     ------------------
                     PRIZE GIVEAWAY!!!!
                     ------------------
After you successfully start Capital Punishment and access 
the main menu, you will notice that the warriors do not have 
names.  The reason for this is that we are giving you, the user, 
a chance to be part of our creative team by coming up with names 
for these four warriors. The four best selections will be used 
in the final version of the game. In addition to this, these 
people will receive a FREE ORIGINAL COPY OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT! 
It could be you! Just think of the names for all four warriors, 
and e-mail it to our Internet e-mail address:

  clkboom@io.org

Simply type:
Warrior A - (the name you came up with for warrior A)
Warrior B - (the name you came up with for warrior B)
Warrior C....

                     STARTING THE DEMO:
                     ------------------
Capital Punishment works perfectly even on a basic Amiga1200.
For this demo, however, you will need a hard-drive. 

LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:
          
1. Turn off your computer. This is very important, since 
   CAPITAL PUNISHMENT needs a lot of continuous free RAM.
2. Turn it on after 15 seconds.
3. We have managed to squeeze an enormous amount of code into
   only 2Mb of CHIP RAM. Thus, if the demo won't run from 
   Workbench, hold down both mouse buttons, and after a couple 
   of seconds you should see an "Amiga early startup control" 
   screen. You may release the buttons, and choose 
   "Boot with no startup-sequence". 
   Your Amiga will have 2Mb of CHIP RAM free.
4. Change directory with a CD command to the directory 
   where CapitalPunishment.v5 is located.
5. Type in the name of the demo (it should be 
   CapitalPunishment.v5) and the demo should start soon
   afterward.
6. That's all. You should also read "manual.txt". Enjoy!

NOTE: If you have an Amiga 1200 with only 2Mb of RAM, and a lot
of partitions on your hard drive, you may not have enough CHIP 
RAM to load the demo this way. If this is the case, please 
do the following:
While in Early Startup Screen (step 3), choose, "Boot options", 
and disable all of the other devices except for the system 
partition and partition on which you have installed the demo. 
Choose "OK", then "Boot with no startup-sequence", and go to step 4.

040/060 NOTE: This demo has been proven to work on 1260 060 board for
A1200 if (and only if) you turn all the caches off. The same should
be applied to 040 machines.

CD-32 NOTE: This demo has been tested on a CD-32 with an SX-1 module.
If you have FAST RAM (even 1Mb should be enough), you will 
be able to experience Capital Punishment, and you won't need keyboard.

If, however, you have a keyboard connected, you will not need extra RAM.
Simply follow step 3 above of using "early startup screen", and once
in DOS, run the demo by typing the same commands as you would on a
computer.

If you have a CD-32 without extra RAM or keyboard, we do not know 
what would be the way to run this demo, because loading WB will 
take too much CHIP RAM, and not enough will be left for the demo.
This is due to the fact that this CD is not bootable.

Final version of the Capital Punishment will have a CD-32 version
with a bootable CD, so the game will run without any need for keyboard
or extra ram.
