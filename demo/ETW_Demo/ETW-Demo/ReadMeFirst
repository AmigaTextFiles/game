Note
----

The game panels and texts may flicker if you run the game with CGX V3 on some boards. This is dued
to a bug in the CGX V3 doublebuffering routines. These problems are not present if you use Picasso96,
if you run the game on the WB screen or if you disable the double buffering in the video configuration
of the game (in the commercial version).
