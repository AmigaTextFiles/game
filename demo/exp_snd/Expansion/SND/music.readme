This music module is by a musician known as fby, called Medioeval.

Here is the embedded text from the module:

"an original theme ... composed under medioeval inspiration.  listen and
relax ... think about old times when men fight other and themself for a piece
of land ... even if it is not very different today ... only th reason to fight
for is changed ... meanwhile ... enjoy your life."


This music fits my game perfectly, and so does it's composer's comments.
