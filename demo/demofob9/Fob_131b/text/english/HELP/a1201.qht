<l:helpbody>
This item is used when you have made a mistake while moving your units. If you have sent some units to the wrong area, you must immediately use the Undo item. If you pick up other units first you cannot Undo the previous actions.
<l:h1>IMPORTANT:<l:/h1>
Always use the Undo item immediately after the mistake, since it is only possible to undo <b>one</b> mistake!
