                    NUXELIA - SECOND PREVIEW


Nuxelia is a zelda/wonderboy inspired platform game, developed by 
a small crew with long experience of games - of this kind and others.
Another thing the crew has in common is a passion for the AMIGA.
We made this preview to give you some taste of the game, show some
features, and give you some good gameplaying of classic quality.

The first preview archive on the AmiNet somehow got mangled along
the path, so for all you who got a non-functioning version from there,
I hope this one works better. There also was a bunch of bugs in the
code, a lot of them have been fixed in this version, but some may
remain. If you spot one, please report. Also, we have updated and
changed the backgrounds to what we think is the better. 

We have not yet signed a publishing deal for Nuxelia, so if you're 
an intrested publisher, contact me at zik@craze.nu.

                    HOW TO CONTROL THE HERO


Use FIRE BUTTON to swing your sword. While in the air, you may make
attacks directed up or down. You do this by pressing FIRE BUTTON while
pulling the joystick UP or DOWN.

When standing on your feet, you can use special weapons and magic spells.
This is made by simply pulling your joystick DOWN.

To switch between different weapons and spells, you can either press
SPACE for a quick switch, or press F1, to pause the game and show
a full menu of the weapons you have to choose between. The number of
weapons carried are also listed in the menu. 

To open a door or read a sign, you hold FIRE BUTTON for a few seconds,
then pull UP.
