             BOUNCER INSTRUCTION FILE  -  7 LEVEL DEMO VERSION
             =================================================


The Plot
--------

Erm... there isn't a plot, as such, but the basic idea is to guide
"Bouncer" safely from the start of each level to the end without getting
killed.  Use the joystick (up/down/left/right) along a safe path to the
end of each level.  White direction arrows will point you in the right
direction, but they may sometimes lead you to a more trickier route.
Bouncer is set Waaaaay up in space on some floating tiles.  Strange it
may sound, but that's it, hence, the scrolling starry background!

If you've been playing computer games (or "Entertainment Software" as the
industry now like to call it) for a good few years, you will remember a
game called "Bounder".  Bouncer was inspired by Bounder on the 8-bit
machines (no surprise there, then!)


The credits & help screens
--------------------------

These screens are displayed as soon as Bouncer is loaded.  These pages
cycle until the fire button is pressed.  The pages shown give details of:-

Game Credits - Who was involved in production of the game.
How To Play  - The basic idea.
Tile Types   - Shows the various tiles you will encounter.

Upon pressing the fire button, you are shown the main options page.


The options page
----------------

Four basic options are available:-

(F1) Start New Game - Begin a new game, from level one.
(F2) Enter Password - Enter a password to skip straight to a higher level.
 (S) Stars on/off   - Decides whether the stars are scrolling (moving) or
                      static (not moving).  Set this to "ON", b'cos it
                      looks cool!  Switch it off if you want though!
 (C) Credits pages  - Takes you back to the credits & help screens.


Types of tile
-------------

Standard tile - Bounce on these as many times as you like.
Spikes        - Bouncing on these will kill you.
L-R reverse   - Reverses the left/right joystick controls - beware!
U-D reverse   - Reverses the up/down joystick controls - beware!
Points tiles  - Gives a score of 50, 100, 250, 500 or 1000 points.
Heart         - Extra life.  Go out of your way to get these!
Jolly Roger   - Bouncing on these will kill you.
Crumbler      - Like a standart tile, but with a dirty great crack across
                it!  Vanishes after one bounce.
White arrows  - Show you the best and easiest way to go.  Although they
                normally prove useful, how do you know that they're
                telling the truth?
Teleport      - Transport you from one side of the screen to the other.
                Use with caution!
Wind          - Blows you on the direction indicated for a limited time.

Also, a word of warning!  DO NOT jump on a square marked with pretty stars,
it's a long way down!


In-game control panel
---------------------

This shows four important snippets of information:-

Number of lives remaining (start with 5).
Accumulated score. (30,000 is a respectable score!)
Current level number.
Level code (6 digits).  Make a note of these for next time you play!


In-game keys
------------

There are only two.  These are:-

ESC - Quit game and go back to credits pages.
S   - Toggle sound effects on/off


A FINAL WORD
------------

Please, please, please remember - THIS IS ONLY A DEMO!  It contains seven
levels taken from the full game.  When you've completed the demo levels,
the game will stop.  This IS NOT a bug, it's supposed to do this!

Several changes are due to be made in time for the final version.
These will include:-

1. AT LEAST 100 levels of increasing difficulty.
2. High score table with save feature (possibly).
3. End of game sequence.
4. Something nice at the end of each level (I don't know what yet!)
5. Maybe a secret password for extra lives.  There's always somebody who
   wants to cheat!

And probably a few other changes as well!
