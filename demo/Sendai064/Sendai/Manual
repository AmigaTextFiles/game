============
GAME CONTROL
============
        There are currently two input methods used by Realm of Sendai-
the keyboard and the joystick. These two methods are functionally
identical and you will probably end up choosing one or the other. The
numeric keypad is used to enter directions; the space bar is used as
the fire button.
        Though most operations should be fairly intuitive, there are
a number of special commands which need special mention. For a list
of these commands, press '?' during game play.

        'S'     : Save the game.
        'R'     : Restore a saved game
        'p'     : Activate party mode.
                  From here you may select equipment, cast spells,
                  and perform general housekeeping on your characters.
        'Q'     : Quit the game and return to the title screen
        '?'     : Help

COMBAT
======
        If you've played many adventure games in the past, combat
should be pretty easy to understand. Remember to keep track of your
hit points and magic to make sure you don't run out at a bad time.
It will be tough going at first, so stay near the exit and don't be
afraid to run.
        Certain characters have special abilities which are not 
avaliable to other party members. These options will appear in the
combat action menu; experiment and learn how to use them effectively.
        Many characters have spellcasting powers; many others will
develop them with experience. Some spells may be cast against multiple
targets; to do so, move the target selection arrow off the right or
left edges of the screen. The power of a spell is greatly diminished
by splitting its effect.
        Various monsters have different powers, such as the ability
to cast spells or poison party members.


==========
CHARACTERS
==========
        Throughout the game, a number of supporting characters will be
avaliable to help you in your quest. Some will be eager to join up with
you automatically; others require that you perform a service before
they will help.
        TURING is your mentor and confidant. He is an experienced
hunter and has outfitted himself with cybernetic parts. The computer
guided MECH PUNCH always hits, doing considerable damage. His sensor
arrays may be used to SCAN an enemy, informing you of its strengths
and weaknesses. Finally, his REGENERATION BOOSTER may be used during
combat to return him to full health.
        The swordmaster SEAN is more interested in meeting girls than
fighting monsters. Get him on your side, though, and you'll have one
of the best warriors on Sendai.
        RUBY is one of many children orphaned by the constant monster
attacks. She's had to make a living on the street as a cutpurse and 
con artist. Her BACKSTAB talent can be used to bypass an enemy's armor.
        Before becoming a hunter, EIHKO worked as a musician, rugby
player, civic guardswoman, and courier. These experiences have given
her a wide variety of skills to draw from. She might not be the best
warrior, but with time she will be able to do just about anything.

INVENTORY
=========
        You may change your characters weapons and armor from within
Party Mode. Access the menu by pressing 'p'; go to 'Equipment'. Select
a character, and you will be presented with a list of the things that
he or she is carrying. Select any entry to either unequip an item or
to choose a new item from the general inventory.
        There are six different types of item in Realm of Sendai. These
are helms, armor, weapons, shields, artefacts, and magic items. The first
five classes of item may be equipped by characters; magic items are used
by selecting 'Item' from either the party mode or combat menus.
        To see the effects of equipping different items, go to Party
Mode and select 'Stats'. This will give you a character's vital combat
statistics. Not all items will have the same effect upon all characters;
experiment and find out what works best!
        Some hunters have chosen to specialize in a single weapon type.
Sean, for instance, is a master of the sword. When using an item of
the prefered kind, said character's combat stats will be dramatically
improved.

GRYPHON'S CLAW
        The claw of a gryphon, ground into a powder and specially
enchanted, is said to be a ward against all forms of poison. A character
equipped with this item gains immunity to poison and resistance to
the attack of creatures who use it.

TALISMAN
        A protective charm, the Talisman raises both a character's
ability to dodge attacks and to resist enemy spells.

AMULET
        Many different kinds of amulet are produced to protect against
different kinds of magical attack. An amulet will guards its bearer from
damage caused by its designated element; in addition it provides a 
slight bonus to spell defense.

RUNE BRACELET
        Mystic runes are often used to bind the power of a spell to
a physical object. The Rune Bracelet is effectively a spell storage
device; with it any character may act as a spellcaster.
