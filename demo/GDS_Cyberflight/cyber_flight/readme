Cyber_Flight is an AGA only scroller demo which shows off (to a very limited
extent), the new AGA dual playfield modes.  It also shows how to make use
of the ILBM fill mask to load 16 color pictures into the proper playfield.
Note that AGA dual playfield displays deeper than 6 bitplanes need to load
the 2nd playfield color palette into offset 16 instead of 8 as was normal.
This demo also sets up a split screen, as is typical in many arcade games.
Scrolling is done from the vertical blank interrupt at 60 frames per second,
which is why it is so incredibly smooth.  I didn't have time to add ships,
enemies, etc.  The gfx would get awefully boring after a while as well. :)
Grab the joystick to control flight.
