@node "hint" "Hints & Co"

  This demoversion has been very shortened, so some operations doesn`t
  make "that" sense.

  Here are some hints that help you to finish this demoversion:

  1) The chest seems to be magnetic
  2) Perhaps that old stoneblock could be blasted
  3) The caribic lake and the big stone seem to hide something  

  That should help you to finish it. If you need a complete
  solution email me...

  The Story
  ---------

  Deep in the caribic on Stormy Island, the mad professor E.A
  Orly is working on the bomb that can destroy the whole world.

  Our hero Louie Jones, CIA agent, has watched the professor
  hided behind a bush. But the professor saw and caught him.
  On the next morning he threw Louie out of Stormy Island in
  the sea.

  Louie could rescue himself by swimming with a stick and after
  two days he arrived on the coast of Fancy Island. But he
  lost all his clothes, his gun and the other utils.

  Louie is the only one that knows of the bomb project in the
  caribic. It is now his turn to get back to Stormy Island
  and catch professor Orly before he gets the bomb working.

                   All depends on you now!

  Your quest begins on Fancy Island where Louie still is.
  Altogether there are 3 islands: Fancy Island, Wobbly Island
  and Stormy Island. The mad professor and his team of
  developers are on Stormy Island.

  Start your quest now before it`s too late...

@node "wasmacht" "Introduction"

  The 3 Islands is a highend 256 color adventure game with scanned backdrops. 
  It was developed during 2 years and is now finished. I spent so many time
  on this game that I decided to release it as Shareware. 

  This is the very shortened demo version. You can play the demo version
  and if you like it you can order the full version.

  I think $25 US-Dollars for a game with such features, is a really fair
  price. If you like the game then please order the full version and do not
  p i r a t e  it. If we get enough orders, we`ll release other games for Amiga in
  future. If we don`t get enough, we can`t release any games in future,
  because a game project costs much free time! So support Amiga and order
  the fullversion!
  

  Here are some features of the full version:
  -------------------------------------------

  <*> scanned backdrops only
  <*> special effects
  <*> cool music by Pumpkin
  <*> many different locations
  <*> many animations
  <*> many fully user controlled dialogues & hard discussions
  <*> puzzles
  <*> load/save games
  <*> easy controlling (LucasArts like)
  <*> many objects to take and use
  <*> cool intro and very long outro
  <*> multitasking
  <*> and much much more...

@node "System" "System requirements"

  Minimal requirements:
  ---------------------

  <*> AGA Amiga
  <*> 68020
  <*> 2MB Chip Ram

  
  Recomm.:
  --------

  <*> AGA Amiga
  <*> 68030+
  <*> 8MB Fast Ram


  More Fast Ram is always supported. The 3 Islands loads from RAM
  then and not from harddisk. That`s faster.
  
  If The 3 Islands doesn`t run correct, or the mouse pointer freezes,
  try to disable the caches or boot with no startup-sequence.

  Sorry, but at the moment there`s only an AGA version available. If
  you want a version for CyberGraphX contact me.

  Additionally you must have the Workbench installed on your harddisk and
  boot with it.

@endnode

@node "option" "Using The 3 Islands"

  To start The 3 Islands, doubleclick the icon on Workbench. It`ll
  start then.

  Now the loading-window appears. To see the picture in best
  colors, set your Workbench to at least 128 colors. It works
  with lesser colors too, but then picture doesn`t look "that"
  nice.

  You now have to select the language you wanna use in the game.
  At this time you can only select english or german. I think
  this will change in later versions.

  Now the intro appears. After it the game finally starts. 

  There`s now the main character "Louie Jones" on Fancy Island.
  
  The screen is divided into three parts:

  Part 1: Scene. Here happens everything.   
  Part 2: Command line. Here is the command what Louie shall do.
  Part 3: Control panel. Here you can select between different operations.
                         Your choice will then be displayed in the
                         command line.

  On the control panel there are the following buttons:

  Goto: Click on this button and then on any point in the scene
        and Louie will walk to it.

  Give: Click on this button, then on an object in one of the
        boxes in the control panel and finally on a character
        in the scene. Louie will now offer this object to the 
        selected character.
 
  Take: Click on this button and then on any object in the scene
        and Louie will try to take it.

  Use: Click on this button, then on an object you have in one
       of the boxes in the control panel and finally on an other
       object in the scene or in the control panel boxes. Louie
       will now try, if he can create or make anything useful with
       the two objects.

  Talk to: Click on this button and then on a character in the 
           scene to have a talk with the person.

  Look at: Click on this button and then on any object in the
           scene or in the control panel. Louie will now have
           a look at the object and tells you what he has watched.
     
  Boxes: In these boxes Louie will storage all he took or got.
         At a time only 4 objects are displayed. If he got more
         you can scroll down or up with the arrows.

  Arrow up: You can scroll the boxes up with this button.

  Arrow down: You can scroll the boxes down with this button.
