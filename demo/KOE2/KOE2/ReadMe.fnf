This material was submitted to me on disk directly by the author, Brian 
Vodnik, of Realism Entertainment, for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Brian!

Because of its size and use of proprietary support programs, it is necessary
to create a separate bootable disk.  A script file has been included to 
unpack the archive and recreate the demo disk.
