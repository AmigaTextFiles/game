	common problems when playing Almagica - Scions of a Forgotten World.

@Node audio "Audio-problems"

	@{b}Questions regarding the Music and/or the soundeffects.@{ub}

	Q: When I start the Setup program, the "No Audio" checkbox is checked and ghosted, so
	   I cannot use any sound at all.

	A: The setup-program does this if it couldn't open the ahi device. Make sure that the
	   file "DEVS:Ahi.device" exists and that none of the direcories "DEVS:AHI/" and
	   "DEVS:AudioModes/" is empty.


	Q: Why isn't there any soundeffects, even though I've selected Music/Sfx in the menus ?

	A: You've problaby configured Almagica to use only four audiochannels. The Music will always
	   require exactly four channels alone, thus leaving no channel free for the sound effects.
	   Either swith of the Music or configure Almagica to use more then four audiochannels.


	Q: How comes the sound quality is so low when I choose a mix frequency over 28 KHz ?
	   Shouldn't it become better the higher the frequency ?

	A: When running a screen mode that is not doublescanned (PAL or NTSC), the maximum
	   mixfrequency is about 28 KHz. When running a doublescanned screen mode, the maximum
	   frequency is twice that (56 KHz). This is simply the way the AGA-chips works. When
	   running a doublescanned mode, the AGA chips must run at twice the speed. And since
	   audio data is fetched from memory by these chips, you're able to fetch twice as much
	   data on the same time. Select the mixing frequency just below 28 KHz and everything
	   should sound just nice.

@Node misc "Misc problems"

	Q: Every now and then a yellow-flashing box is displayed with the text "Low Memory". Why and
	   what is it?

	A: Almagica brings up that box when you have runned out of memory. When this box is open you've
	   got two choices. You can either quit Almagica by pressing the Right Mouse Button, or you can
	   press the Left Button. If you press the left button, Almagica will wait for 10 seconds before
	   it retries to get the memory it needed. In those 10 seconds you can quit other program that
	   runs in the background, to free memory for Almagica.
