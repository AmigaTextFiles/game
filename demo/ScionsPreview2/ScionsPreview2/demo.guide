  Welcome to the Second Preview of ALMAGICA - Scions of a Forgotten World.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This is the second preview version of a new realtime strategy war game,
  called Almagica - Scions of a Forgotten World.

  The reason for us realeasing this preview is to give you a chance to see
  what kind of game this will be. And I would like to say a few words before
  you start this preview. This preview IS NOT ment to impress anybody with
  blending full framerate 256 color graphics or to make you howl with joy
  about the stunning soundfx or make you spending hours trying to outsmart
  the AI. This IS STILL only a preview, so don't be disappointed if Scions
  doesn't kick WarCraft 2's ass...

@Node game "About the game"

  About Scions
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  As said before, Scions is a realtime strategy war game. Other simular
  famous games in this genre are Dune II, War Craft (NoAmiga) and Command &
  Conquer (NoAmiga). Since fewer and fewer games are ported to the Amiga
  platform, we decided that something had to be done.

  Anyway, this preview isn't very complicated, only a few minutes of gameplay
  is needed for you getting acustomed to how things are done. But to give you
  all a headstart I'll try to describe what you're supposed to do.

  After you have started the preview you will be presented with the main game
  view. Here you will see that most part is taken up with a map showing
  different kinds of terrains with troops and houses placed here and there.
  It's on this map most of your gameplay will take place.

  On the bottom right corner you have a smaller map. This overview map shows
  the entire gameplay area, with parts that you haven't discovered colored
  black. Enemy houses and troops are displayed as red dots and your troops
  and houses as blue.

  Above this smaller map is the "currently-activated-item-picture" box. Here
  you will see a picture and the name of the currently active object (troop
  or house). Also when something is activated you may see a number of boxes
  appear beneath this box. These boxes are called "orderboxes", because they
  represent different kind of orders you may give your troops or houses.

  And finally, on the top-right of the display you have the amount of
  resources you have. Resources are needed for you to build and repair houses
  and troops, and a couple of other things. If you ever run out of resources,
  then it's time for you to consider yourself in trouble.

  In this release there are five levels. Since you cannot save or load games
  yet, we have included a simple code system. When a level is won, you will
  be presented with a four digit code. Simply type this code at any time
  during the game and that level will be loaded.

@Node units "Houses and Units appearing in this preview"

  Units & Houses
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Here is a brief description of all units and houses appearing in this
  preview, together with a summary of the different orders they can perform.
  Note the the keyboard shortcut for each order is within parantesis.


  The Farmer
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The farmer is your hardworking man. He is responsible for tasks such as
  harvesting and mining, building and repairing. The farmer is quite
  ordinary, only equipped with an axe and some other useful tools. He does
  not know anything about warfare, but if neccesary you can order him to
  attack. As the farmer becomes more experienced, he will be able to both
  carry more goods and become better in working in the forest.

  The farmer can be ordered to:
  (M)ove to a position    (R)etreat to the inn    (G)uard a position
  (H)arvest tree or mine  Re(p)air a house        (A)ttack an enemy
  (D)rop some resources   Build a (F)arm          Build a (B)lacksmith
  Build a (W)ell          Build an (I)nn


  The Militia
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The militias are ordinary villagers that has been equipped with light armor
  and has been somewhat trained in the art of battle. Far from being
  professional warriors, they are still the best defense you can hope for in
  a small village. Since they are carrying armor, they cannot move as good as
  the farmers, but on the other hand, they can survive much longer in battle.
  The more battles a warrior survives, the better and more experienced he
  will be, becoming more and more deadly.

  The militia can be ordered to:
  (M)ove to a position    (R)etreat to the inn    (G)uard a position
  (P)atrol a route        (A)ttack an enemy


  The Archer
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Villagers with a talent from archery can prove very handy to have in
  battle. The Archers are equipped with a bow and a large quiver of arrows.
  Unlike the militias, they are not armored in any way, so they are easier to
  kill. But because of the lack of armor, they are of course faster then the
  militias.

  The Archer can be ordered to:
  (M)ove to a position    (R)etreat to the inn    (G)uard a position
  (A)ttack an enemy


  The Scout
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Scouts are faster then both farmers and archers, and when becoming more
  experieced, they can see farther then any other unit. Their only weapon is
  a dagger, so they should not be used in offensive attacks.

  The Scout can be ordered to:
  (M)ove to a position    (R)etreat to the inn    (G)uard a position
  (A)ttack an enemy


  The Inn
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The inn is the natrual place for you headquarter. It's here that the young
  people in the village gather, waiting for the elder people to allow them to
  serve the village in what they think is the best way. The inn is also the
  natrual place for storing all the resources the farmer bring back to the
  village. The inn got a status bar telling you of how many free citizens
  that can be trained into units you got, in relation to the maximum number
  of citizens you can have.


  The Farm
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In the farm, young people learns what it takes to become a farmer,
  including mining and foresting. They also learn the craft of building and
  maintaining different kinds houses. The farm has a statusbar which displays
  the amount of units in relation to the maximun number of units possible. If
  no bar is shown, you got more units then can be supported by the farms.

  The farm can:
  Build a (F)armer


  The Blacksmith
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  When someone is selected to be a warrior, they are sent to the blacksmith
  to be equipped and receive a little education.

  The blacksmith can:
  Build a (M)ilitia       Build an (A)rcher       Build a (S)cout


  The Well
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Without a well a village cannot survive for long. Its water is essential
  for human and animals both. Without a well, the risk for a plauge becomes
  greater, preventing your village to grow. The well have a status bar
  telling you of how long it will take before a new citizen is created.

@Node moreunits "How to make more units"

  How to make more units
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Creating new units is not as simple as just to make them, there are some
  limitations that must be considered.


  Maximum population limit
  ------------------------
  The first limit limits how many units you can have totally. This limit is
  raised by building either inns or farms. Inns raises the limit by two and
  farms by four. If this limit is reached or exceeded, no more units can be
  trained and a message will appear telling you to first build more farms.


  Difference between citizens and units
  -------------------------------------
  The second limit is not as much a limit as it is a principle. You cannot
  "create" units, you rather "train" units. This means that you must have
  someone to train. These someones are called "Citizens" and are people that
  you cannot see. They sit inside the inn waiting for you to select them for
  training. If you are to train a unit you will need a citizen. If you are
  out of citizens a message will appear telling you of the problem.

  New citizens are created by building wells. By selecting a well, you can
  see how long it will take until a new citizen is created.


  An Example
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Suppose you got one inn and two farms. This mean that the Maximum
  Population Limit is 10 (2+4+4).

  Now suppose you got 2 farmers and 4 militias out (totally 6 units). The
  maximum number of citizens you can now have is then 4 (10-6). If you select
  an inn then the CITIZENS bar will show you how many you have, and a full
  bar then means 4.

  If you now got 4 citizens (the bar is full), then you cannot create more
  citizens from the well. The GROWTH bar on the wells will stop on maximum
  waiting until a new citizen can be created.

  Training a new unit will remove one of your citizens (3 left) and make him
  into an unit (7 unit totally).

  Selecting a farm will display a bar telling you that you got 7 units of a
  maximum of 10.

@Node setup "Configuring Scions"

  How to configure Almagica - Scions of a Forgotten World
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There are a number of options that is either impossible or senseless to
  change "in game". These options are placed in an external program. To
  configure Almagica, run the program called 'setup' placed in the scions
  directory. The setup window consists of a number of buttons and checkboxes
  and slider.

  Title                 Description
  --------------------  -----------------------------------------------------
  Select Screen Mode:
						Use this to select what screen mode to run in. Note
						that the width of the screen MUST be an even count of
						64, if not, the width will be rounded down. The
						minimum allowes size is 320x200.

  Select Audio Mode:
						Simular to "Select Screen Mode", but lets you select
						what audiomode and mixfrequency to use.

  Emulate Blitter:
						If checked, then all blitter actions will be emulated
						by the CPU. If not checked, the blitter will be used
						directly. Using "Emulate Blitter" will save a lot of
						CHIP memory if you have some FAST memory installed.

  Bitmaps in FAST:
						Checking this will force scions to place the render
						bitmaps in FASTmem instead of CHIPmem. On ordinary
						computers (i.e. no gfx card and such) it's slower to
						have them in FAST, since then they have to be copied
						to CHIP before they can be displayed.

  Pause when inactive:
						Check this if you want scions to pause whenever you
						deactivate its screen.


  CyberGraphX:
						Set up scions to be used with a CyberGraphX screen
						mode.

  No Audio:
						Disables all audio. No audio resources at all will be
						used if this option is used.

  Audio Channels:
						Lets you select how many audiochannels to use.

  Priority:
						Sets the priority of Scions when it is activated.

  Sleep Pri:
						Sets the priority of Scions when it is inactive. Note
						that this slider is disabled when the 'Pause when
						inactive' checkbox is active.

  Hot Spot X & Y:
						Due to a bug in either CybGfx or Scions, the hot spot
						on the mousepointer isn't correct when using a
						CyberGraphX screen mode. You can manually correct
						this with these sliders. Note that different screen
						modes may/will require different settings.

  Save & Run:
						Saves configuration and runs scions.

  Save:
						Only save configuration.

  Cancel:
						Forget changes and quit.

@Node keyboard "The Keyboard"

  The Keyboard
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There are several keys used in Almagica and here is a brief summary:

  <Shift> F1 to F4      Snapshot up to four different positions on the map.

  F1 to F4              Recall a previously snapped position of the map.

  Tab                   This key has different meanings when different
						objects are active:

						A bounch of friendly units: Rotate the leader in the
						group.

						A friendly house: Activate the next friendly house.

  <Shift> Tab           The same as Tab, only backwards.

  Esc                   Bring up the menu.

  <Shift> Esc           Fast quit.

  <Alt> RMB¹            Performs a default action on a unit, or a group of
						units.

  Return                Centers the view over the place the last message
						refered to.

  Enter                 Zooms the overview map if you are playing on large
						maps.

  Apart from the above keys, there are some keys that can be used to select
  an order. These keys vary from unit to @{"unit" link units}.

  ¹: RMB is short for Right Mouse Button

@Node newfeatures "New Features"

  New Features
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  These are the major improvents done since the first preview version was
  released.

  o Dynamic Screen Size
	The first preview allowed the user to choose which screen mode to use,
	but the game area was always set to 320x200. This has now been changed.
	Almagica should now be able to handle screensizes up to 8192x6144 in
	theory, but the highest practical resolution is problaby somewhere around
	640x512. Anything bigger then that will make it hard to see your units.
	Ohh.. Just one more thing. Don't blame the low AGA bandwidth on us , or
	to put it simply, DBLPAL:Hires No Flicker in 256 IS slow, and will
	continue to be slow.

  o Support for Audio Cards
	Almagica now uses the AHI audio system. AHI is a system for Audio
	Hardware independent sound, giving Almagica support for different Audio
	Cards.

  o Default Actions
	This is one of the most frequently wanted features. What it means is that
	the unit itself decides what to do in a specific siutation. For example,
	it ordering a unit to perform the default action on an empty grass spot
	on the map, the unit will move there. Ordering a default action for a
	militia on an enemy will make him attack him. For a farmer on a damaged
	house, the farmer will start repairing it etc etc. The default action is
	invoked by pressing <ALT> and Right Mouse Button.

  o New order system
	The orders are now processed in a totally new way. The user will not
	notice much about this change, except that orders are now much more
	intelligent. Previously units tended to constantly forget what they where
	supposed to do, which should no longer be the case.

  o New order icon system
	In the first preview, all units had a fixed maximum number of different
	orders (9). We could not accept this and so the entire order giving
	system was rewritten. All orders are now devided into three different
	groups, Action orders, House building orders and Troop building orders.
	Action orders are "normal" orders such as Move, Harvest and Attack. These
	orders are displayed one group at a time. If there are more orders of a
	group then can be fitted on the screen at the same time, they will be
	displayed in pages of six orders at a time. The lowest three ordericons
	does not connect to normal orders, but are used to control the display of
	ordericons. There are five different types of controlorders. The first
	three are to move to the Action, Build House and Build Troop groups. The
	last two is used to scroll between the different pages. It's not as
	complicated as it sounds, try it out and you should get the hang of it
	pretty soon. Please note that default actions and keys are totally
	independent on what's currently on the screen.

  o Unit experience
	Units now gets experience. This means that units surviving for a long
	time gets better and better. A unit may for example become tougher, or
	can get to carry more stuff, when raising in experience.

  o "Big graphics"
	Well... Couldn't think of any better title for this. Previously a unit
	could not have graphics that extended into another square (if a unit
	attacked another, there was no way of actually making his weapon seem to
	touch the enemy). This has now been fixed.

  o Farmer no longer disappears when building houses
	The farmers used to be removed when they built houses. This is no longer
	the case. When houses are built now, they are built with only 1 hitpoint.
	The farmer then automatically starts repairing the house unit it is fully
	"healed". The only differnece between a hurt house, and a not yet built
	house, is that the hurt house still have it's orders functional and
	performs special stuff like increasing population pool.


  Stuff NOT made in this version
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There are some stuff that we are thinking of implementing, but that is not
  present in this demo.

  o Direct CyberGraphics Support
	The current support of Cyber Graphics is quite primitive. The reason is
	simple. Cyber Graphics are chunky modes, and Almagica is purely planar.
	Because of this we need to reserve temporary memory to first build a
	planar version of the display, which is then converted into chunky and
	copied to the graphics cards internal display memory (made by a call to
	graphics.library/BltBitMap(). We ARE however, considering to support
	chunky mode directly. This would mean that all graphics are converted
	into chunky when loaded and that all parts of the code writing to the
	display would be created in one planar and one chunky version. Now the
	only problem is this... I don't have CyberGraphics, and trying to make
	this support without being able to test if myself would only result in me
	eating Losec as candy.

  o ECS version
	We have been asked to make an ECS version of this game as well.  We  have
	not yet decided if we should make one, but we do know that we won't start
	on it before the AGA version is  finished.  However,  an  ECS  conversion
	should be fairly easy to do.

  o Traps
	Different kinds of traps will problaby be implemented at some time.

  o Strategy part in addition to the action part.
	We are problaby going to devide the game into two parts, one strategy
	part and one action part. This would result in a game quite simular to
	the concept of Dune II, but much more advanced. The strategy part would
	hold stuff like moving troops, spying etc.

  o Multiplayer game
	Yes, I know you all want this one. We will see what we can do about it,
	but I can't promise anything(!!).


  More details
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  For a more complete documentation of all the changes made to almagica since
  the last preview version, please refer the the text "Recent_Changes" in the
  root directory of Almagica. Please note that the translation of this text
  into english started quite late, so some of the oldest entries are still
  written in swedish.

@Node aboutdsp "About DSP"

  About DSP
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DSP currently consists of the following people:

  Jimmy Westerlund (nick krywes)
	That's me. I'm the main programer. That means that if the game crashes or
	something, it's me you should blame. It also means that you shouldn't
	blame me if you don't like the graphics :-)

  Björn Hagström (nick orgin)
	Björn is our misc guy. We havn't really been able to find out exactly
	what he does yet, but I'm sure it's something important. But we do know
	some of what he does, and that includes writing a level editor, thinking
	up nice pathfinder algorithms, making contact with various non-DSP people
	on the net etc etc.

  Per-Anton Aronsson (nick Dahmal)
	Per-Anton (or more shortly, just PA) is the one that is to blaim for the
	graphics. I know I should be writing a little more about him or he'll
	just be envious, but I really can't come up with somthing... He's simply
	making the graphics, and belive me, that's quite enough.

  Fredrik Svensson (nick digital)
	Fredrik is the person responsible for the music. In his defense I have
	to note that the sounds effects are not his doing, but I'm sure you like
	the music which is very much his creation.

  We are all about 20 to 23 years old and VERY dedicaded to our lovely
  computer. For this reason I think I speak for all of us when I say that we
  WON'T abandon the Amiga for the PC. Please, don't ask us to make a PC
  version of Scions, we may get rather upset...

  Except for the four of us there's a number of other people that has in
  different ways helped and inspired us all. These are people like Magazine
  editors, betatesters, idea sharers and not the least, all of you who have
  bothered to send us an e-mail. Without all of you, there would have been a
  risk that Almagica, due to the amout of work it needs, would have died a
  long time ago. Thanks...

@Node bugreport "How to write a bugreport"

  How to write a bugreport
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If you find a suspected bug, we would like it if you could write us a
  bugreport. If you decide to send us a report, please have these things in
  mind :

  o Your system (Computer, CPU, memory, GfxCard, OS version, etc etc).
	Althought this never should be the cause of the bug, it still might.
	Better give to much info about your system then to little.

  o What happens?
	Describe what happens. If you get an enforcer/mungwall hit you should
	include where the hit happend (hunk and offset). See if you can get to
	reproduce the bug regulary. If you can tell us exactly where, when and
	how to get this bug, it will be much easier for us to track it down and
	remove it.

  o Is there another program interfearring with scions?
	If you get a bug and is able to reproduce it, see if it is still there
	if you boot with no startup-sequence. If the bug has suddenly gone
	away, then you are running a program that for some reason interfears
	with Scions. In that case, try to find out which this program is.
