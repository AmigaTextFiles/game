@node intro
@title "Introduction"

  This is an early demo of a new realtime strategy game that is currently in development.  It shows the basic structure of the game, but still has many ommisions.

@endnode

@node inst
@title "How to Install"

  Simply drag the whole Expansion drawer to somewhere on your harddisk. - The installation will take 4Mb

  No assigns are neccessary, and the game will automatically make an assign to it's fonts/ directory, so you don't even need to copy the fonts over!

@endnode

@node req
@title "System Requirements and Test Systems"

System Requirements

Kickstart 39 (3.0) or higher
2Mb Memory (Including at least 1Mb Chip) - some fast ram is recommended, since this is a very chip ram hungry game.)
- This requirement my increase in the future.


Minimum system:
OCS/ECS Amiga with 2Mb chip ram and possibly some fast ram

Recomended system:
AGA Amiga with 2Mb chip ram, and at least 8Mb fast

Optimal system:
Amiga with modern Graphics card running either CGX or P96, an AHI compatible sound card, and lots of fast ram



NOTE that currently you still need quite a bit of free chip ram when using P96, since it doesn't fully
patch the graphics.library blitter functions to work from Fast ram :(

Tested On:

* Graphics Systems:
  OCS, ECS, AGA, Picasso96, CyberGFX

* Processors:
  68000, 68060

* Kickstarts:
  3.0, 3.1

Please tell me your system if you try Expansion!

** WARNING **  The following text is somewhat technical, and can be ignored if you don't experience any problems running the game!


If the game crashes whilst starting up (i.e. after the 'Generating Map' window), then there is a good chance that there isn't enough chip ram free the main window.
The sollution is to try to free up as much memory as possible, so try to disable any other programs (especially MUI ones, since they use alot of chip ram), or start with the startup-sequence disabled.

@endnode

@node problems
@title "Known problems"

Can crash on startup on systems with low Chip Ram free.

When running on a Picasso96 screen, the mouse pointer will freeze momentarily every time the graphics in the main window update (Can someone tell me if this happens on CGX too?) - This should be fixed when I write P96 / CGX driver modules.
(NOTE: This effect seems be far worse on higher resoultion screens - It's barely noticable on a 320*240 P96 screen)
One current sollution is to create a planar 16 colour screenmode using Picasso96 Mode (PicassoModeNG doesn't seem to posess an option to do this)
- The game will run a little smoother on this screen, but of course then you are limited to the 16 colour graphis set.

If you use Magic Menu, the menus look quite dire (nasty orange/green coloursceme), and bevels don't quite fit the font on Lowres screens.

The window gadgets on main window look odd when on a Lowres screen. (The arrows look  messy.) - This is fixed if you use one of the numerous patches which alters the intuition gadgets (e.g. SysiHack)

On P96 screens the mousepointers look terrible - I hope to fix this too with the gfx modules.  (Okay if using a planar screen (see above)

On my new machine (A1500Ti 060) the Protracker player module doesn't play correctly. However it worked fine on my 68000 A500+.  Please report whether it works properly on your system.
(To test this, play the module in a tracker program first, so that you know what the music is meant to sound like!)

If you get an error saying 'Program caused exception: "bigg" [0]' when you try to run the preferences program, it means that the window was too big to fit onto your Workbench screen.
It fits on a 640*200 screen when using topaz 8, so you are probably using a font that is higher than 8 pixels.
Run the fonts prefs editor, and select 'Reset To Defaults' from the 'Edit' menu, then click on 'Use', and try running the editor again.

@endnode

@node features
@title "Features"

System Friendly.

Runs on any Intuition screenmode (As long as it has 16+ colours).

Graphics and sound operations handled by plug-in modules.

Fully window based - you can resize and position the windows to suit your taste.

Real time gameplay - no annoying turn-based limits.

Context sensitive mouse pointer - changes shape to remind you what it will do when you click!

Multi-threaded design - internally multitasking.

@endnode

@node run
@title "Running the game"

 Running the game

Expansion can be configured to run on virtually any screenmode, at any depth.  By default, it is set up to run on a lores screen, but this can be adjusted using the preferences program.

Once you have chosen your screenmode, simply double-click on the game's icon.

(note: If you only have 2Mb of memory, then make sure that you don't have any other programs running at the same time (But if you have the memory, Expansion will multitask happily!)

@endnode

@node play
@title "How to play"

 How to play:

After the introduction windows, and the map-generation progress bar, you will be presented with the main game window.

(note you will get a screen prompting you for a choice of game mode - this is currently just for
show, and it doesn't matter what you click on, you'll always get a random map!

This is layed out so:

@title "First jobs"

Quick Tutorial:

Firstly click on the allocate jobs icon (1).  A white border should appear around the castle.  Now click on one of the squares of grass within this border.  This is your first field.
A small person icon will appear on the square, and as time progresses it will appear to be ploughed.

@title "Message Window"
A new window will appear, titled 'Messages', containing a single message 'Mission brief'.  Click on this message.  The scroll icon in the window will unroll, to indicate it has been opened, and the new message indicator wll dissappear.
A message window will open, and display a bit of pointless background story.  You can quite safely forget this.  Close this message window.

Since this game is window based, you now have a choice, you can simply close the messages list, or resize your main window, and keep the messages window open all the time.  The choice is yours.

@title "Harvesting"
By now, the field should have been ploughed.  When it has, 200 bushels of grain will be taken from your store, and planted.  By the end of March, this should have grown, and will automatically be harvested.
This new grain will automatically be transfered to your store.

@title "Rationing Food"
Now wait for June.  This is the first of the bi-anual food rationing.  A new message will appear, either informing you that x bushels were taken, and everyone was satisfied, or that there were x bushels to short.
In the latter case, don't be too alarmed, it simply means that some of your subjects will move away from your kingdom.  In some ways, it then makes your job easier, since you will no longer have to feed them.

@title "Happyness"
The happyness level (21) will show how many of your population actually got fed.  As people leave, it will gradually go up, until you are only left with happy people.

In a kingdom with happy people, and abundant food, new settlers will move into your kingdom.

@title "Expand your farming"
Now that June has passed, you should expand your farming, so that you have plenty of food available for the second rationing of the year, in have plenty of food available for the second rationing of the year, in December.

Make sure that the allocate jobs icon (1) is active, and click on a few move squares within your boundries.  Note that each field takes ten people, so if you have 143 people, you will only be able to farm 14 fields.

NOTE:  If a field is ploughed, but there are not 200 bushels spare, then the people working here will stop.  You must tell them to start work again (by re-allocating the job on this square) when there is enough spare grain.)

@node tutorial10
@title "Map window"
  You should now have got the hang of farming.

  Look at the main window, at the squares around the castle.  You will see
that there is alot of dark blue squares around, just beyond your border.
This is unexplored land.  Click on the map icon (10), and the map window
will open.  On this there will be a white rectagle, indicating what you can
currently see within your game window.  In the centre of this should be a
large white dot, surrounded by a black circle.  The white dot is your
castle, and the black line is your border.  Try clicking somewhere on the
map.  You will see that the white rectangle moves to where you clicked, and
the main display changes.  Now click back on your land on the map.

  NOTE:  As with the message window, you may wish to keep this window open
all of the time.  It makes no difference to the running of the game.

@node tutorial11
@title "Expanding your borders"
  Expansion is the name of the game, so you should now start expanding!

  Click on the build defence icon (3), and again examine the land that you
can see around your castle.  Ideally, you want an area with trees,
grassland, and water.  Pick an area to aim for, then click on a square of
grass on the outside edge of your border.  A small building should appear,
and your border, and field of vision will expand.  You can now farm any new
grassland within this area.

  You will notice that your number of logs has dropped by a hundred.  This
was the wood used to construct the defence building.  this is why you
should have aimed for some trees.  Click back on the allocate jobs icon,
and then click on a square of forest.  A person icon will now appear on
this square, and your log supply will gradually increase.  The more
squares of forest that you work on, the more wood you can gather.

@title "Fishing"
  If there are any squares of water within your borders, then you can also
fish for food, simply set people working on the coastline (you cannot fish
in deep water), and they will gradually gather fish for your people.

@{" <- Back " link tutorial11} | @{" Next -> " link tutorial13}

@title "Training Knights"
  Each defence building requires 10 knights, and 100 logs.  You will
notice that you have only 10 knights in total, and you have just 'used'
these when you constructed the defence house, so if you want do build more
defence, you will need more knights.

  Clicking on the train knights icon (5) will train ten more knights.
Note however, that doing this will use 200 food, and 1000 gold, so
currently the number of knights you can train is limited.

@title "Taxation"
  Every January, (from year 2) your people will be taxed at a rate of five
pennies per head. (100 pennies = 1 gold coin)  If the gold collected is
greater than 1 gold, then you will recieve a message.  This gold will be
added to your wealth.  At the beginning, the sum will be low, but as you
attract more people,  the income will also rise.

@title "How to Contact Me"

How to Contact Me:

 Currently there are three ways you could contact me:

  E-mail

   I have two addresses:

    richard@munnfamily.demon.co.uk        < home address       >
    ram8@le.ac.uk                         < university address >

     During term time, you should send mail to the bottom address, since
     this is my University e-mail account, which should be valid until
     the year 2000.  Note,however that during the summer holidays, and at
     Christmas, I will be at home, and so the top address should be used.

  Snail-Mail

   Otherwise, you can send mail to me using the age old methods of our
   fore-fathers at the following address:

     Richard Munn,
     RAMTronics Software,
     20 Kingston Avenue,
     Worcester,
     WR3 8PW.

   Note that this is my home address, and so I may not recieve the letters
   until the next time I visit home.  Also you are far less likely to
   recieve a reply if you write to me by postal mail (unless of course,
   you include an e-mail address for me to reply to!)

  IRC

   I can also be found on the channel #amiga on the ircnet irc network,
   as "benjymous", mostly during the day (i.e. 12 - 3 gmt) but some evenings
   too.  I hope to see you there!

  Mailing list

   I am currently looking for someone who is willing to host majordomo (or
   similar) open mailing list for the discussion of Expansion.  If you think
   you can help, please contact me!
