*************************************************************
* - Questions & Answers for Genetic Species Demo Version. - *
*************************************************************

Q: I cannot get any sound in GeneticSpecies?

A: GeneticSpecies is using the brilliant AHI device for audio, you need to
   install this in order to get the sound working. Another problem could be
   the CPU usage limit.
   You might have to enter the "SYS:Prefs/AHI" program and click "advanced
   settings" and change the CPU usage limit to 100% and save these new
   settings.


Q: AHI Does not seem to like me? 

A: Before you start the game you must be aware that the AHI requester does 
   not like it if you have audiomodes in DEVS:Audiomodes/ without having 
   the right soundboard for these modes. The result can be everything from 
   a crash to no sound. In other words in you do not have a soundcard just 
   keep the Paula mode.


Q: I cannot get Genetic Species to recognize my Graphics Card? 

A: Genetic Species will run under CyberGraphics and Picasso96 graphics 
   standards, but you need to install the RTGmaster.library before you will
   be able to run GeneticSpecies using your graphics board.


Q: When I press the "del" key something weird is happening what is this?

A: You are launching the probe also known as the "Portable Probe Device".
   You can use the probe at any time to takeover the enemies and become
   this creature.

  
Q: Do you have many weapons or just a gun?

A: GeneticSpecies contains a lot of different weapons designed for ultimate
   destruction. Most weapon are mounted on certain enemies, so you will 
   have to takeover these creatures to gain their weapons and skills, but
   other weapons are located in hidden rooms. Search and you'll find. :)

                                                     
Q: Where can I buy GeneticSpecies?

A: The Genetic Species Amiga CD is available from all good retailers 
   everywhere around the entire Planet.


Q: Is the Marble-Eyes team going to develop more games for the Amiga?

A: Well of course and we'll warn you about them on our web page. :)
