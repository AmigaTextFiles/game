FreeSpace and the Analog JoySticks
==================================

Descent FreeSpace: The Great War for AmigaOS supports a wide
range of input devices from "usual ones" like Keyboard, Mouse
and CD32 Pads to "exots" like PC Analog Joysticks and Playstation
Pads. Many Players like to have a Analog Control for Space-Games
like "Descent Freespace" - though of course you also can play it
without analog devices.

To attach a Playstation Controller like the Sony Controller you'd
get a special adapter called "PSX Port" which every well-sorted
Amiga Hardware Dealer should have in stock, and which is supported
by FreeSpace.

To use a PC Stick you sadly cannot just order the adapter: You have
to do some soldering yourselves. There are many PC Analog Stick Adapters
for the Amiga, but not all of them work with FreeSpace. In the following
I am describing how to build an adapter which is compatible with
FreeSpace (and also ADescent, the Descent 1 port for AmigaOS, BTW).
