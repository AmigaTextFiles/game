			     Introduction



Kang Fu is an arcade platform game in which you play Klont the Kangaroo.
You have to find your lost baby kangaroos (joey's) who are spread through
the levels.  Of course there are enemies, animals and objects who do not
like you that much, and try to block your way and make your quest harder.
But luckily there are numerous weapons and bonuses spread throughout the
levels, such as guns, bombs, boomerangs, diamonds, bonuses and other stuff.
Klont himself is not completely defenseless as he can kick or jump on
enemies to squash them!
The levels are not plain areas, they are real mazes with hidden galleries
and invisible platforms. You do not only have to find the exit,
some entrances are blocked with keys and you need the right combination
of keys to open them, so a little puzzling is also involved!
At the end of each level, you are confronted with a huge (really HUGE)
endboss. They are about the largest you'll ever see ! Of course you have to
kill them before they kill you !

So nothing new for the concept, you have known platform games for almost 15
years now.


But what is really exceptional about Kang Fu is that we have tried
(and succeeded !!) in making it the best platform game for the 'new'
generation of Amiga's, the AGA machines.
The technical specifications are really outstanding, we managed to get
up to 1000 colors on screen, in HIGHRES, and DUAL PLAYFIELD ! Of course
a game has to be smooth so we made it FULLFRAME 8 WAY SCROLLING and it is
FULLFRAME on all Amiga's, not only the A4000's but also the 2MB 1200 or CD32.
And this is not just in a tiny window, the screenmode is 640 * 280 !!
Maybe you think: the Kangaroo or the enemies (or most of it) are really
small then. This is also not true, the moving objects in the game are really
big so no need for a magnifying glass here !


Have you ever seen such specifications ? Like the Amiga Computing said:
'You will be really impressed'. When you have Kang Fu you can REALLY SEE
it is an AGA game developed especially for the AGA Amiga's / users !


We all know how bad the Amiga situation is at the moment. Can you remember
the time in which Amiga games where the best games available ?
You could show off games to people who had an Atari, Nintendo or PC.
Have you seen any games lately that even can compete with those computers,
let alone, are better?
Kang Fu puts your Amiga right back on the map between the 'modern' computers
like the PENTIUM, the PLAYSTATION and the SATURN.
Yes, for the Amiga a new generation of games has arrived. Kang Fu places
itself easily between the new games these modern machines have. And the best
thing is, you don't need any new hardware (Except for maybe, a CDROM).
It is still the same machine you bought years ago.

Yes you read that right, Kang Fu is CD only. Don't you have a CDROM already?
Let us tell you why you should consider buying one ! (They are really cheap
nowadays!) Have you noticed that all those great games on PC, Playstation,
or other consoles all use CD or cartridges ? They really need the space but
the Amiga has never had a standard CDROM. The A1200 does not even have a
HD drive and this has limited the Amiga software in a terrible way.
Kang Fu is really a BIG game, not just the levels (over 600 screens large!)
but for example all those HIGHRES HAM graphics really EAT disk space !
Kang Fu is about 180 MB (and therefore also one of the LARGEST Amiga games!)
large and we are not talking about intro animations here. This is the GAME.
The music is of course played from CD, we have 22 nice music tracks, together
over 45 minutes long, you know this is really a PACKED cd !

If you have more memory, Kang Fu has much more colors and sounds. So if you
have an unexpanded A1200 you should think about getting a memory expansion,
they are not that expansive anymore, and you not only have the extra memory
but your A1200 gets twice as fast with fast memory!


Are you curious already ? You don't believe it ? Well play the demo now and
make up your own mind.

The demo is a SMALL level because a big level would get (guessed it?) to BIG
to download. It is already a 7 MB LHA file !

		       Starting the Kang Fu Demo:



A1200/2 MB Chip only: Disable all drives and harddisks except your main partition
		      in the startupmenu. Now boot without startup-sequence,
		      and type the following lines:
		      mount CD0:
		      execute CD0:Lowmem

A1200/4 MB & A4000  : Click on CD icon and then click on 'KangFu'


Kang Fu automatically detects if a Joypad or Joystick is connected.
We recommend playing with a Joypad.

			  The Instructions:


You play Klont the Kangaroo.
The aim of the game is to collect as many little kangaroos as possible, kill
the enemies, collect the bonuses and find the exit to the next level.

During his quest, Klont is harassed by all sorts of animals and objects which
normally harass Kangaroos. They will do their best to sent Klont to Kangaroo-
heaven as quickly as they can.

Jumping: Klont jumps as long as you hold the joystick/joypad up or diagonal,
but he can only jump to a certain height. During his jump you can steer with
left and right.

Enemies can be crushed by jumping on them. Some need multiple hits, but some
enemies can't be crushed at all!

Klont can kill enemies by using weapons like eggs, bombs, boomerangs, guns and
boxing gloves. Weapons are hidden throughout the levels. You pick them up by
ducking. You only have a limited amount of eggs and bombs, for every egg
Klont picks up he can throw eight eggs, but bombs come in smaller packages,
only one at the time. When a bomb is thrown, it kills all the enemies on the 
screen. Klont keeps his weapons when he goes out to kill the big end-of-level-
monsters. But when he kills it and is transported to the next level, the 
weapons mysteriously disappear, with the exception of eggs and bombs, which can 
be saved up throughout the game. Some enemies need more hits from a weapon then
others.


The Gun:

Low damage, but high range. It has unlimited ammunition.

Eggs:

Medium damage and very handy for enemies above you.

Boomerang:

Good damage and homes back to Klont!

Boxing Glove:

High damge but only at close range.

Bombs:

Kills all enemies on screen, but bombs are very limited !
Come in handy in difficult situations with lots of enemies.

Not all the platforms Klont can jump on can be seen. Many of them are hidden
in objects like trees, statues and buildings. Klont can not jump through
platforms from beneath, he must jump at the edge to reach the higher platforms.

Now and then, Klont's way is blocked by locks. Of course he has to find the key
with the corresponding color to open them. Look carefully, some of them are
very well hidden.


Tips:

- When ducking and pressing fire/red button with gun or gloves active,
  it is easier to hit small enemies.
- Little kangaroos cannot be killed by a bomb, but can be killed by any
  other weapon. Killing little kangaroos gives you negative points.
- Pick up bottles to replenish your energy.
- You can hold the left black button to get into kicking position and then
  release it when the enemy is in range.
- Kicking kills all enemies you hit in one go, but is only useful at very
  close range.
- Some of the end-of-level enemies can only be harmed at certain places.
- When playing with a joypad, it is easier to jump by using the right black
  button.
  Move Klont during his jump by keeping the black button pressed and steer
  with the left/right direction.
- For jumping large distances, it is better to walk and then (while keeping
  the left or right direction) jump by choosing a diagonal direction.
- There are more ways to find the exit. Often you can take a long route with
  more weapons, bonuses and enemies or a short route with less of it.
- Look out for hidden treasures. They are invisible but you can hear a bonus
  sound when you pick them up.


Kang Fu is (C) 1994-96 by GREat Effects Development Den Haag, Holland.

Notes:

Some features are not included in this demo.
CD32/A1200 2 MB version does not include sounds at the moment.
Audio tracks are not included in this demo.


If it refuses to work:

- Kang Fu needs ALL your Amiga's memory that is installed. Don't run any
  utilities/ commodities in the background, especially Enforcer.
- Kang Fu needs at least 1.8 MB of free Chipmem in the workbench, preferably
  in one block.
- Don't use more than 8 colors on your workbench screen if you don't have a
  graphics card. Use Screenmode in your Prefs dir to decrease the colors in
  your wb.
- Disable any diskdrives in your startupmenu.
- If your controller adds buffers for your CDROM in ChipRAM, decrease the
  amount in the mountlist.
- Remove any expansions on your CD32 that take up memory.
- Kang Fu expects Lowlevel.Library in LIBS: on your harddisk.
