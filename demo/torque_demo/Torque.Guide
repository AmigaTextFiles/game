¹ All the files must be spread together in an unaltered state. Feel free to

  This applies to fellow PD libraries. If any library charges more they will

³ Permission must be granted for this software to be included in any form of

  Also, when you obtain the full version, this preview mix MUST be removed from
  any lists containing it ( ie BBS, PD library etc. ) and can no longer be

                full version is just as easily obtainable.

@node Bollox "Introduction"
  Pure and simply this is a Uridium clone. It's not a straight conversion, I
 thought about doing it that way but what a waste of the Amiga that would be.
  I've tried to capture the elements of the original, the fast scrolling, the
 instant playability and the fun. Whether or not I have is up to you, but I'm
                          quite pleased with it.

I doubt if you've bothered to read the @{"Copyrights and Distribution" link "yawn"} bit, so
  if you haven't you won't know this is totally free. No restrictions and no
Shareware fees. Why ? Well a couple of reasons. I don't think it's right to do
a clone and then charge for it, unless it's far and away a better version. This
 isn't. Also if you are going to steal someones' idea I think it's a little be
 cheeky to get paid for it. The other reason is that @{b}SHOAH's@{ub} sister company is
 @{"SHOAH PD" link "SHOAH_PD"} ( Strange, but true ). I earn money from distributing other peoples
 hard work, so hopefully this will go someway towards re-dressing the balance.

@node quick "Instructions"
This is only a list of controls, the game itself couldn't really be more simple
  and I'm not going to write a little atmospheric story to go with it, what's
            atmospheric about reading a guide with multiview ?

                               P	Pause
                     Esc	Quit ( Only when paused )

  Holding down the fire button will cause your ship to flip on it's side.


To install @{b}@{fg highlight}Torque@{ub}@{fg text} to your hardrive simply make a new directory called 'Torque'
  and make sure you assign it, then copy the files Torque, Hi-Scores and
                         Loading_Screen1 into it.

@node final "What's left to do"
         In the Big Mix you @{i}should@{ui} find the following features...

  Another ( Currently ) eight fleets, with some really huge dreadnoughts.
      Smart memory management, if you've got the RAM then why wait ?
                           An installer script.
 There will be other features, but if I blab now where would the suprise be ?

A note about bugs...
There are a couple of bugs in this preview mix, I know it's the lamest of the
lame to release stuff actually knowing that there are bugs in it, but if I
didn't release this mix soon the full version would be ready. See this mix as
                            a playable advert !
The bugs are...
¹ The score goes a bit mental sometimes, so if your score is well over thirty
  thousand that you've just met that bug !
² Every so often when you are flying left your ship will just keep on going
  through memory. If this happens then you'll just have to quit.
³ Also, every so often one of the baddies may just disappear !

Sorry about this, ALL bugs will be gone in time for the big mix. Also if you
find the game glitches a lot then get some fast Ram ;) The game is throwing
a fair amount of data around quite quickly so it may not be able to do that
   in a single frame. I've been breaking my back to make it as quick as
                possible, I'm just not good enough I guess.

A final note, this has been tested only on A1200's with various ram configs. 
 if you have a '30/'40 machine and it all goes badly wrong then please get
                             in touch. Thanks.

@node Ads "Cheap at half the price"
 We are selling advertising space at the start of each fleet for a mere £20 !

If you would like to advertise then please @{"get in touch" link "SHOAH_PD"}, this offer is open to
               everyone, from user groups to PD libraries !

  Because this game has taken a hell of a lot of work crappy adverts won't be
 used ! If you want us to design the ad. for you then please add an additional
 £5.00 to the total. Minor alterations will be done for free, and we will send
                    you a copy to confirm that it's ok.
No payement is due until the full game is ready for release, you will be sent a
copy in advance and then all cheques ( Only issued from UK banks ) must be sent
                              within 30 days.

The format for the advert is lo-res 320*160 in 32 colours, and all advertising
        space will be resevered on a first-come first-served basis.

Please support this idea, it means you get a cheap advert and the user gets the
             software for free, which can't be bad for anyone.
