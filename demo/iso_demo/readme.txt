First Things First
------------------

This game was created on an Amiga A1200 with 6Mb RAM and 80Mb IDE Hard Disk.
It has been tested on this configuration only.

THIS GAME HAS NOT BEEN TESTED ON FLOPPY DRIVE OR SCSI HARD DISK!!!

I reccommed you decompact it and run it from the ram disk.



Stuff to do
-----------

1)  Different noises on moving through doors etc.  Currently the
    (rather annoying) door creak demo sound plays whenever you
    move though any exit... even if there's no door there!!

2)  Speed up the graphics code.  You may notice that the 'wine cellar'
    room (blue floor) runs very slow.  This is due to too much
    being drawn on screen in each frame.

3)  The will be 4 'hurry-up' anims in total.  (More on these below.)
    Currently three are complete - the fourth just has the player graphic
    standing still for the whole anim.

4)  Load and Save options.  So you don't have to complete the game in
    one sitting!

5)  Some form of indication when an exit is blocked on the other side
    (currently there is none - other than the player cannot go through
    them).

6)  Title/intro screen...maybe!

7)  Preferences - 'Hurry-up' anims ON/OFF;  Sound ON/OFF; etc.

8)  Improved font.  Maybe multicoloured ?

9)  Player should be able to interrupt 'hurry-up' anims.

10) Propare player animations for PUSHing and TELEPORTing.

11) Test running game from floppy disk!

12) Re-draw player walking!!!!!

13) The current sound samples are just demos.  But I kinda like the
    'bionic' sound - pity it's so muffled!!

14) Other characters - otherwise what's the point of having a TALK
    option ???   I doubt that these characters will walk about - they'll
    probably each just inhabit a spot in a room somewhere.



Stuff you can do
----------------

1)  'Hurry up' animations.  If you don't do anything for approx.
    30 seconds, your player will try and re-grab your attention.
    There are 4 'hurry-up' animations in all - but only 3 are
    currently drawn.  The TALK button has also been wired up to
    activate these animations in this demo game (so you don't have
    to wait 30 seconds for each one!)
    In both cases, a random anim is picked from the four!

    I am hoping to give the main player sprite a really funny
    personality.  I have always thought the best games are where the
    main player sprites seems to have personalities of their own.
    (Remember Bolderdash on the C64, or Lemmings ???)

2)  There's a copy of Blitz BASIC 2 in the demo game somewhere.  (It's
    actually an  object in the game.)  It's well hidden, but can you
    find it ????  (Hint: An interest in books may help!!)

3)  Guess what you can do with the video...!


Known Bugs (kind of...)
----------

Quick Inventory - text has wrong background colour!!

Try putting an object down on the Teleport - then stepping through!
You can't get back, arrrrrrrrrrrhhh!!! (Because there is an object
blocking your way on the other side!!)

The block line at the bottom of the player is a guide line I use
when editing the graphic.  It will (naturally) be removed in the
finished game.

The map makes no sense!  In the finished game UP will always be
NORTH, Down SOUTH, etc.  The point of view of the player will
not be rotated between rooms (as it is in the demo).  When you
go out of a room to the north you will appear in the next room
at the southern side.  Likewise east and west!
