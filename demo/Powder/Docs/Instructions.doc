You downloaded a playable demo of Powder.


1. General rules

It's a shot'em'up, the rules are very simple:

  1) Destroy whatever you see.
  2) Avoid to be destroyed.


2. Control panel

The bottom of the screen shows the "control panel" of your ship.
From left to right are displayed:

  1) Actual score.
  2) Number of times you can change module. (see below how to change module).
  3) The 5 modules icons (one of them is highlighted).
  4) Energy of the shields.
  5) Number of remaining ships (star-shaped icons).

Every time the energy of the shields reaches the 0 you lose 1 ship.
When you lose all the ships the game ends.


3. Changing module

You can change the "shape of your ship" in the following ways:

  1) Pressing the 2nd mouse button.
  2) Hitting the space bar.
  3) Performing a complete circle with the joystick ( clockwise or
     anti-clockwise ) while holding the joystick button down.
  4) Using the right mouse button

Your ship will change into the module actually highlighted on the control
panel. Move joystick left and right to highlight the module you want to switch
to.

There are 5 modules available, each with his own properties.

Hint:
It's of great help to use the "right" ship-shape according to
"game-situations" and "enemies".


4. Misc

You begin the game with 3 ships and 5 possibilities to change module.
You'll get an extra ship at 500000 points.
You'll get extra "change-possibilities" too (about 5 per level).


Note: To exit back to the Operating System press both shift keys togheter.
