After years of work, and also years of non-work, at last we bring you this
demo of our game. I am one of the graphic artists and also I am responsible
for the music. There was a load of graphics and music made for this game,
which probably you will never see, and for the music, instead, I will send it
in aminet next. But let's talk about this game... the works began in 1990, and
there was a lot of enthusiasm around it, and we graphics made the most of the
work in the first three years. Following, we tried to sell our creature, but
there is a lot of difficulties,and we did'n't make anything about. Now, this
demo comes to your Amiga,and i sincerely hope that you will enjoy it.
