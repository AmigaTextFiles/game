All the years spent more or less heavily over Powder and the Amiga in general
have been and will remain unforgettable. We learnt a huge amount of things
about computers, some of them I find useful even today that the world of
computer programming has become a real mess. I work as an expert of systems in
a local software house and I think that I have enough knowledge to say that
Amiga is the best computer: for its unique hardware architecture, for its
operating system and especially for its incredible users. I still don't own an
int*l based pc (no capitals) and I'm nearly fully satisfied with my A4000/040
(I think it's time for a graphic card).

I, first of all, would like to thank all the members of our team for the funny
hours spent togheter along the years. Then, thanks and greetings go to many
persons I have, in a way or an other, meet during the last eight years: Ettore
Caurla at CBM Italy for its immense kindness and invaluable support; Randell
Jesup, Dave Hayne, Chris Green, Martin Taillefer, Carolyn Scheppner, Mike
Sinz, Chris Ludwig, Danid Junod and all the poeple at Commodore; Stefano
Balzani, Ivan Venturi, Fabio Belletti and Stefano Dalfiume at Simulmondo;
Mario Bruscella; all the members of the ADSP (Amiga Developer Support Program)
community; Alessandro Trebbi sysop of Nightmare BBS; Pietro Magnanini and Max
Santinelli for their support.

I'm still trying to keep myself up to date with Amiga news despite of the
little spare time and I try to code something when I can. I have a deep
knowledge of Amiga hardware-banging programming techniques and a vast and
complete knowledge of Amiga Operating System. I use both assembler and C
as programming languages.
