Powder should run on every Amiga with at least 512k of memory. 
This demo requires 1 Meg of Chip ram.

Powder has been tested on:

Amiga 500 Kickstart 1.3 512k CHIP RAM
Amiga 500 Kickstart 2.0 2M CHIP RAM
Amiga 4000/040 Kickstart 3.1 2M CHIP RAM 8M FAST RAM


Powder has been developed with some own made tools and the aid of these
programs: Seka assembler, ASM-One, SAS/C, Deluxe Paint, SoundTracker,
Noisetracker and IFFMaster.

The main source, containing the game itself and some enemies related editors,
is formed by near 25000 uncommented lines for a total of about 400k.
The background map editor is, like the game, written totally in assembler and
is about 5000 lines long for about 70k of source.
The bobs editor was in its first version also totally written in assembly.
The last version of bob editor is now written 90% in C and, opposite to all
other editors, is fully system compliant.

There are a total of about 2M of graphics and 1M of music and sound effects
equally divided among the five levels.

The game sports a maximum number of blitter objects on screen of 47, a maximun
of 20 sprites and uses a special technique to maintain a constant frame rate
of 25 frames/sec.
