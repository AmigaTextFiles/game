This is Thomas writing, one of the three coders of the Powder team. Writing
Powder was my first TRUE experience in coding a videogame and I can only say
that I learnt a lot of things doing it. Powder was born for fun and the
thousands of troubles encountered made us think that an end would never be
reached. I hope you enjoy Powder and just remember ... only Amiga makes it
possible !!!

I have some greetings for all the friends at Simulmondo, Mario Bruscella,
Ettore Caurla at CBM Italy, Alessandro Trebbi and Andrew Braybrook.

If you want to contact me, here is how.
