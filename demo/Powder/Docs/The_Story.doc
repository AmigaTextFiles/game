                            The STORY of Powder



??-9-88:

  FXC, TBC (coders) and Danko (graphician/musician) spend all time coding
  demos for the Amiga, they are known as Quazar.

  Nike starts to think his lessons about italian literature are boring and
  useless. He decides to learn how to code; Fxc is his same class.


??-12-88:

  Nike finishes his first assembly demo and realizes he'd like to code a
  "little" game (an easy-to-code one).
  Powder (as an idea) was born.


??-4-89:

  Nike codes (in 3 days) a map-editor to build background scenarios.
  Danko paints and builds an hypothetical background (a city).
  Nike and FXC discuss (during the italian lessons) about technical
  coding problems related to Powder.


??-4-89:

  Nike codes a program that displays (with a smooth scroll) the map of
  the "city" and a little ship flying over it.
  Powder (as a project) was born.


??-5-89:

  Danko, FXC, MMJ, Nike and Tbc decide to work together on Powder.
  Five Star VG Studio (our team) was born.


??-6-89:

  We spend the summer at Tbc's home working. Powder grows.
  MMJ suggests Powder as name for the game (it was still unnamed).


??-8-90:

  Another "Powder-summer" ... the 90% of the work is done.
  We think Powder is pretty nice and start looking for a software-house
  to publish it.


??-?-91:

  We receive several offers (more or less serious) to publish Powder
  from contacted software-houses but for various "complicated" reasons
  no offer comes to an end.
  We lose enthusiasm and have problems internal to the team too.
  
??-?-92:

  Each member takes his own way (work, university, militar service).
  Five Stars VG Studio is dead and Powder with it.


??-?-92 to ??-?-95:

  In spite of everything, Nike and FXC, among huge difficulties and
  with very few time, try to complete the 10% of work remaining.
  The Commodore's bankrupt seems to give another critical hit to them.


??-?-96:

  Nike decides that Powder can't die that bad way.
  He WANTS to finish at least a playable demo (you "probably" will
  never see the complete game) and put it on Internet (Aminet).
  The others agree.


31-3-97 :

  Official release date for Powder demo.


                               Powder LIVES !!
