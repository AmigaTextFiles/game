Ciaaaaaaooooo! =]

It seems to me another Era since we started Powder ( 8 years are a lot! )
and now that it's "finished" i really don't know how to summarize the whole
experience...... it has been excitating and frustating,funny and boring,
happy and sad,hopeful and hopeless,joky and serious,instructive and
destructive at the same time! :-P

I'm actually ( 1/1/1997 ) "studying" Computer Science in Cesena,
you can reach me by address/e-mail and ,if you play MUDs,i sometimes
connect to Dutch Mountains ( asterix.icce.rug.nl 4000 ) as Nike or
to Imperial ( mandrake.cs.hut.fi 6969 ) as Pinto.


My greetings go to all friends ( from Fano,from Cesena and 
                                 wherever they are from... )
Special greetings to:

Powder Team: Filippo-Marco-Simone-Thomas
Fano2 Soccer Team: Christian & Co.
4.f.c. Soccer Team: Ciacci-Ettore-Mauro-Marco-Paolo-Peppe-Spina...
Mud-friends and especially: Flippo-Matador-Rhysel-Liri-Reina-Nemo-Tavira



                                   Nike.  ( Nicola Valentini )
