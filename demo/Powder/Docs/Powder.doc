 © 1989-1997 Five Stars VG Studio


1. Introduction

This is the demo version of a shoot'em'up game called Powder. Being a demo,
it contains only the first level of the game and all the "accessories" are
not completely finished. It has been developed during eight years by a team
of 5 persons called Five Stars VG Studio and a more detailed story can be
found in the file story.doc.


2. Installation

Move the contents of the archive into a floppy disk named Powder: or into
your favorite directory in your hard disk. Only if using an Amiga OS prior
to version 2.0 you will also need to make an assign Powder: to the directory
the files are in (e.g. assign Powder: Work:Powder).
Powder demo will run in all Amigas with at least 1 Meg of Chip Ram. It will
use extra Chip ram for additional sound effects and speech effects and it
will use extra Fast ram as disk cache to reduce loading times.
Powder has been tested on A500 and A4000.


3. Distribution

Powder demo is freely distributable. It can be distributed as long as the
archive remains intact and no more than a nominal fee is charged for
distribution.


4. Disclaimer

Powder demo is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, either
expressed or implied. By using it, you accept full responsibility for any
damage that might occur.


5. Feedback

The team would like to receive your comments about this demo. This is very
important for us, because some work is still needed to finish this game
and we are probably unable to find enough time for Powder.
But, maybe, if we receive many requests we can consider finishing the game.
However, please, write us your comments.
