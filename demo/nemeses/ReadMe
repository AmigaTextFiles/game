To  play  the  game  simply try and destroy the computers castle.  You will
need to collect stones controlling the craft, the stones are then exchanged
for  power.   Select  attack  or  defence  via the "Z" and "X" keys on your
keyboard  and when you have enough force you can start blasting away at the
other   castle,  but  remember that the computer is also looking to win, so
defence is vital.
