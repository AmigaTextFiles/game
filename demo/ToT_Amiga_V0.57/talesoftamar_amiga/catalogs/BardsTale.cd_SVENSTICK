Bards Tale
BT_ERSTETAG (//)
                                                            The first day\n\n§(#1,50,20,320,160)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike many others you want to try your luck and build an empire in these days. For many years now, there is no ruler over Tamar. Chaos and anarchy rule the lands. Everybody wants to rule over everybody else, but there is nobody who is able to unite the lands and become supreme ruler.A hard life awaits you and you will face death more than one time, so do you really think that you are able to rule the entirety of Tamar? Will people look up to you or will they drive you from the land in dishonour and shame because you failed? It is up to your skills alone to build a huge and mighty empire from the few things that are at your disposal.Right now you don't have any fame or fortune. Everything you have is a small village and some acres of land. The village consists of some small huts, two old mills and a half degenerated granary.In the middle of the village there is\
 a slightly bigger hut which houses the local tavern. This building seems to be the hub of the city because news travel very fast in the tavern and it is the first place that a stranger to your town will visit. §($1,>) §§But don't lose faith at this pathetic sight. You can already imagine how it could look like in a few years. The first things you are going to build are probably a sawmill and a blacksmith shop. Both buildings will be very helpful when you want to erect other buildings. You can also imagine seeing the marketplace, right next to the tavern, in your mind. Maybe you are going to build a markethall later on and a residence for yourself, so that you have a proper place to live and work in. From there you can rule your expanding empire.You should seek the aid of wise men who will research in various fields of knowledge. And you should also hire local guides and let them scout the surrounding countries, so that they can give you informations about villages and other lands they\
 will discover. Then it is also possible to contact your neighbours, trade with them, or even launch a war against them.\n\nSooner or later, the few acres of land that you possess will not suffice and you will have to expand your realm. For that you need soldiers which you have to equip with weapons and armour.But you should also do something for the simple peasants of your village, like building a school or a chapel. Soon the village will grow into a little town and someday maybe into a big town. People from all over the country would like to settle, live and work here. And maybe, someday, in the far future, you will be able to build new settlements in your realm.\n\nAll roads are yours for the taking. You can try your hand at diplomacy or on the battlefield. Or maybe you will be a smart merchant. If you are a vassal or a feudal lord, each way has it's ups and downs.But keep in mind that you should not betray the people that you are dependent on. If you fail, you will be cast out or\
 even be killed. But if you rule wisely, then statues will be erected for you and the bards will sing about you and your wise rulership in years to come. §($2,<,-1)\n§§

                                                            The sawmill\n\nNot long ago, there was a little forest in the place where the new sawmill is now. You had choosen this place because this was a good location next to the river. On behalf your orders, the trees were cut down and used directly as building material for the sawmill. The current of the river is quit strong here, so this makes it an excellent place for the water wheel, which is now powering the saw-frames.An ancient oak tree is just beeing cut into identical boards with the monotonous up and down movement of the saws.The smell of fresh wood is filling the air and a thick layer of sawdust is on everything inside. Each day the workers work until deep into the night because they have problems with keeping up with all the fresh orders that arrive from all parts of town. Since there are different types of saw-frames, different types of work can be done at the same time. Beams for roofs and floorboards are needed as well\
 as furniture. Parts of weapons are also made from the wood from the sawmill.A new load of trees just arrived on a horse drawn carriage. The driver stands next to the carriage and is about to deliver the oakboards to a building site on the outskirts of town. He will also take some big beams to a nearby place, where the blacksmith is going to be build.§($1,-1)\n§§
BT_MARKTPLATZ (//)
                                                            The marketplace\n\nThe newly opened marketplace lies in the middle of the city. Shortly after the opening cerenomy by your administrator, there is already hustle and bustle going on. There are offers of various goods from all over the country. You can see big warshields next to a carriageload of building-material and heavy artillery next to some sacks of corn and rare herbs. Sometimes you can even see a placard which offers ships for war and trade. You can always look at the various offers and place your bid. But other lords may also want to get their hands on various goods and thus not every bid you place will be the high bid, but you shouldn't let that get to you. Of course you can also sell goods from your storage. If other countries are interested in your goods than gold will soon fill your treasuries.The goods that your craftsmen and blacksmiths produce are also not to be neglected. Those goods are also offered here. Due\
 to the respect, that comes with your position, you are sold these goods at a good price because they know that you are in a much better position to sell these goods to other lands. Depending on how capable your craftsmen are and what skills they learned in the past, you will come upon goods ranging from simple daggers up to heavy war catapults.§($1,-1)\n§§
BT_SCHMIEDE (//)
                                                            The Blacksmith\n\nThe new blacksmiths, which has just been erected on your behalf, already serves its purpose in assisting the further expansion of the settlement. Basically everything a new realm needs is produced here, from metal fittings and construction material to sword blades and armours.You can hear the characteristic sound from far away, when the heavy hammer hits the anvil. As you enter the smithy to get a first hand look at the progress, the blacksmith is already at work and, despite the cool early morning air is sweating heavily.You were really lucky to get this master craftsman, because even though he comes from the race of dwarves and therefore is rather small in size, he knows how to work the hammer and the glowing metals like no other. Right now he is relying on the lad who operates the bellows at the back of the room that heat the furnace, and soon the steel is white hot again. Then he takes a pair of large\
 pliers to pick up the piece of metal that will soon be the blade of a battle axe.With a power you wouldn't expect from this dwarf, he forms the blade with the typical bent form. He controls the hammer very well, each of his blows hits exactly the right spot and soon the blade is finished. He carefully inspects his work, makes a few corrections with a smaller hammer and then puts the blade back into the fire. When it is glowing red again, he takes it out and drops it into a tub of water. This will make the blade strong and enduring, and soon it will be put to good service on the field of honor.In the background you can see an assistant who finishes the blades, cleans and sharpens them. Next to him are a few already completed axes and a basket of spearheads which are already finished and await their shafts and fletching.§($1,-1)\n§§
BT_HANDELSREG (//)
                                                           The trade registry\n\nUlrich is up early today. He received orders to take care of the new trade contracts for his Lord. For many years Ulrich was responsible for the administration of grain reserves and thus also for all contracts regarding grain shipments. He isn't young anymore, but he has a lot of experience in distributing the grain properly. From his looks you would hardly think that he has such an important position. His runty shape is clad in simple clothes and his thin hair is hidden under a felt hat. Only the large bunch of keys on his belt for the grain storages, and the bag with writing materials in it that is on his shoulder distinguishes him from the simple peasants on the streets.Bustling activity greets him as he opens the door to the trade registry. Several scribes, sitting behind their desks, are writing out contracts. One of them has just finished a contract for delivery of weapons to a neighbouring realm,\
 and takes it - the ink barely dried, to the senior storekeeper who has his desk on a pedestal in the back part of the hall. Only he is allowed to sign contracts in the name of his Lord. He is checking the text thoroughly and signs it, but not without first looking through the inventory and the price list to confirm the values. As always, he places the official seal on the contract with an air of solemnity about him. He then calls over one of the waiting messengers, gives him the contract and a bag full of small coins for expected expenses and sends him off to the neighbouring country.Ulrich is directing his steps towards the senior storekeeper as well. After the last two harvests, which haven't been too good, the reserves of grain are nearly used up.\n\nThe country needs grain badly, so they had sent out riders to ask for grain shipments from friendly neighbouring Lords. So far they have had no success. Today he seems to have no more good news than before. Wungart, the storekeeper, is\
 shaking his head as he sees Ulrich approach him. 'No new offers, Ulrich. If we can't get some contracts, this will be a hard winter for the people.'§($1,>)\n\n§§ At that very moment, the front door bursts open and an exhausted messenger, from head to toe covered in dust, comes in swaying. He is hardly able to stay upright, but his eyes are shining.He shouts: 'Grain, finally! I have a grain contract!' He opens his bag, which is covered in dried mud and pulls out a leather sheet, from which he carefully, as though it was very fragile, extracts a parchment. Wungart hardly believes his eyes as he reads it. An offer for grain - even more than they need, and for a very good price! One of the allies of the realm had a rich harvest and is now offering the grain in return for the help he has received from this realm in the past.\n\nUlrich doesn't waste any time and rushes back to the residence with the good news. His lord skims over the contract and then signs it immediately. Then he calls\
 over the best messenger available and sends him on his strenuous journey.\n\nNow that grain deliveries can be expected before the start of winter, a lot of work is waiting for Ulrich. He has to take care that it will be alloted justly.Meanwhile, everyday life has returned in the the trade registry. The messengers are waiting for work, scribes are bustling over documents while Wungart watches over them eagle eyed. §($2,<,-1)\n§§
BT_HAFEN (//)
                                                                The port\n\nWith a loud BANG, the box crashes onto the quayside street and its contents, many full bottles of wine, spread out across the ground. Soon a puddle of fine Port wine covers the street. The young worker who was supposed to load the box into the the ship with a pulley system looks bewildered at the end of the torn rope. Before he has the chance to wonder what happened, the loud and angry voice of the Captain is calling out from the ship: 'By the Gods! What is it now? Am I surrounded by idiots? Who sent me that useless pile of kettlefish of a worker? Not only did it take ages before I could dock, but now this scurvy dog breaks my best crate of Port! I just bought it, dammit, and it wasn't cheap either! Where shall I get a new one now? I want to set sail in two hours!'The worker quickly cleans up the pitiful remnants of the skippers beloved wine supplies while other workers load the last supplies on the ship. The\
 cargo was already loaded in the early hours of the morning. It is weapons and armour for a neighbouring country. The sea route is not without dangers, but is the only way to reach that country. So the merchant has no other choice than to entrust his supplies to the cargo bay of the small trade ship.§($1,>)\n\n§§ Fortunately, the captain is a very able man, who knows how to keep his vessel on course even in bad weather and who has always reached his destination. If you see him standing on his bridge, he resembles a feared pirate more than a trade skipper. His face and arms are tanned by the sun and salt water and look like well-worn old leather. He's wearing black trousers and a simple white shirt whose sleeves are almost always rolled up, even in the worst of storms. A large sabre is hanging from his broad leather belt. It looks like it could split a man in two with a single strike. His captains jacket, a gift from the trade guild, is hanging in a closet in his cabin and looks like it\
 was never worn. Which is probably very close to the truth.\n\nFinally, after all is aboard, the still angry captain gives the order to weigh anchor and set sail. Slowly the large canvas, in the colors of the Realm, unfolds and the 'Sea Goose', as this ship was recently christened, is picking up speed. It always fills the captain with pride when the wind bulges the sails and soon the 'Sea Goose' is plowing through the water. He watched it being built and now it is his small domain. He's the one in command here, and everyone in his crew knows that.With the farewell wishes of the dock workers she is leaving behind the 'Sea Goose' majestically glides out onto the open sea. The wide horizon is very still today, and there is hardly a cloud in the sky. As the captain looks back to where the town is slowly dissolving into the horizon, his mood gets better by the minute. Here, out on the open sea, with only waves below and sky above, he is truly at home. He lights his pipe and leans relaxed on\
 the cabin wall. You can even hear him humming along with the song his sailors are singing while they fix the last crates onto the deck. Once again he will deliver his cargo safely and neither rain nor storm will stop him.§($2,<,-1)\n§§

                                               'A Guide for new sovereigns'\n\nYour settlement has only existed for a few weeks when one of your advisors comes across an interesting book. It is quite old, but contains advice for building a new realm that is still true today. The book is called 'A Guide for new sovereigns' and describes in several chapters the things an aspiring Lord should keep in mind.To make your life easier, you will find some excerpts from this here now and then.\n\nPrologue\n\nNow that we may look back upon many years of a successful and adventurous life, we want to give you, dear reader a few insights from our rich experience. Many years we have spent waging numerous wars, and now that we rule a large realm and enjoy the peaceful aftereffects , we want to pass on some of the knowledge that has made our realm what it now is. Before you will be able to live through only one war, you will need a calm mind and a strong hand to rule your land.\n\nSo shall these pages\
 help you to build a strong and lasting realm.Kar Enil, Count of Storowo anno 3810 (ca. 470 years before King Abanor - Remark of the chronicler)§($1,>) §§Chapter 1 'Agriculture'\n\nAgriculture should always the center of our attention because grain is the main source of food for our people.  Never forget to keep enough to sow the next spring. But the resulting harvest also depends on the size of your country, the number of mills to process the harvest and, last but not least, the weather. Even the most perfectly planned crop season can be ruined by a lasting spell of bad weather.This is why we always keep a reserve of grain in our storage. This also allows us to help others who were not as lucky or as anticipatory as we were.\n\nJust as important as sowing and harvest is the distribution of the grain afterwards. If you keep your people going hungry, they will quickly lose any kind of confidence in you, while a rich meal attracts new immigrants.The general rule is: If you give more\
 grain to the people than they need, then confidence in you will increase and the number of births will go up; If you don't give enough, confidence will drop very fast and people may even die from hunger.\n\nThe worst thing to do is to not give anything in a quarter. This is why our last advice of this chapter is: It's better to tighten your belts twice in a row than to go entirely without grain only once.§($2,<,-1)\n§§

                                               'A Guide for new sovereigns'\n\n'Chapter 2 'Tax'\n\nEspecially in the first years of your rulership, taxes are the most important source of money. They also have a huge influence on the confidence of your people in you as well as on immigration and emigration. The base tax is the most important of all taxes and will produce the most income for you over the years. Set it to high, and people will try their luck somewhere else. If you need more people, then lower this tax. The news will quickly spread and people will literally come flocking in.\n\nCustoms duty is charged on all goods sold, not just those of foreign traders. So if you set it too high, your craftsmen will rather sell to another merchant instead of you.The judicial tax is the hardest to manage, since it directly influences how hard your judges will be in their decisions against felons. We remember how we took over the reign from our father when we were still young men. Some of\
 the richer noblemen saw this as a welcome opportunity to raise up against us and demand more land and gold. We quickly sent off troops to their lands and, to make an example for the other nobles, we had the leaders convicted and be-headed, and their possessions confiscated. This gave us a rich income of gold, but the displeasure of the common people grew. Many left the country because of our hard hand against the rebels and general confidence was very low. We barely managed to avoid open rebellion. Only with drastic tax reductions and great loss of money were we able to keep in power. The setting of taxes is always a tightrope walk between a filled treasury and a happy population. Try some variation, but always be careful and choose your steps with caution.§($1,-1)\n§§
BT_LEITFADEN_3 (//)
                                               'A Guide for new sovereigns'\n\n'Chapter 3 'Production'\n\nFrom the very beginning, a large assortment of artisans and craftsmen will settle in your country. They will produce the weapons, armours, ships and whatever else you will need sooner or later. But of course they need some prerequisites for their work. First of all, you should build a blacksmiths and a sawmill.Blacksmiths produce a lot of goods or at least important parts thereof. The part of the production that your people don't need for themselves will be offered to you. You cannot directly control the type of goods that are produced, but there are some influences which you can control.Most important of all are the natural resources. When we took over the land form our father, it mainly consisted of grassland and deserts. The few mountains hardly produced any resources and we had to buy most goods from our neighbours for lots of gold. The little ore that was hauled was needed by\
 the people themselves, and so we had nothing left with which to produce weapons and armour. But then the ruler of a neighbouring country died unexpectedly without an heir. We took the chance and gained control over a larger mountain area. We found large deposits of coal and ores. The more our miners hauled from the depths of the mountains, the bigger our production grew. The assortment of goods was very diverse and the prices low.But we also noticed that our blacksmiths had quite limited abilities in the beginning. They only produced simple goods, like daggers, short swords or leather armour. Only after we improved our knowledge in the areas of technology and in the art of battle could they produce better weapons, like claymores, and better armour such as plated breastplates. Alchemy helped us to produce better and stronger alloys.§($1,-1)\n§§

                                               'A Guide for new sovereigns'\n\n'Chapter 4 'Trade'\n\nTrade with other countries will always be an important part of your daily duty. Be it that you sell goods yourself or that you have to buy things that you need but can't produce yourself. First you will need to find some trade partners of course. You can send out scouts who will tell you about the countries they find, but you should also keep an eye out for scouts from other countries visiting you.We always employ some men to look out for messengers from other countries and to get some information about their Lords from them. We even had some visitors from overseas when we hadn't our own fleet yet. We always like to talk to them and get some profitable trades through them. We also have some men looking out for ships on the horizon. When we signal out to them, they usually send over a small boat and we have a new trade partner already.\n\nYou have to find ways to trade. The first is the\
 free market: all goods offered here can be bought by anyone who is willing to pay your price. Of course this includes potential or actual enemies to whom you don't want to sell. So if you want to sell only to certain Lords or for a special price, you will want to use contracts.In our youth, when we were fighting many bitter battles against Sigurd The Black, contracts were our only means to get supplies from our allies. This also had the advantage that nobody else knew of the transactions. For a long time, Sigurd didn't know how well we were supported and by whom. When it dawned on him how powerful our allies were, he was already done for. Use these possibilities wisely!§($1,-1)\n§§
BT_LEITFADEN_5 (//)
                                               'A Guide for new sovereigns'\n\n'Chapter 5 'Foreign affairs'\n\nSooner or later you will notice that no country is an island. Your relationship to your neighbours is important and should be groomed accordingly. More than once, only our good contacts with another Lord has saved us from being thrown from power. If gold is scarce and trade is low or if grain is running out then you would be well advised to be on good terms with another Lord who may lend or trade you something.Don't forget to pay them back of course, or your next call for help could be answered by armies, not help. If you want to expand your realm but all surrounding land is under the control of your neighbours then you shouldn't begin by sending a call to arms. Maybe one of your neighbours is short of cash and would sell you some acres of land, or you could help him in a battle against his enemies and accept a few acres of pasture as a reward.\n\nOne of the best ways to make\
 a name for yourself is to support small and weak countries in the everlasting fight against the orcs with your armies, or to lend your sword to your allies to defeat a common enemy. If you have the chance to join a formal alliance with other Lords, check carefully if the arrangement would benefit your country. If it indeed does then don't be hesitant to join in with other realms.A large part of Tamars' history was carved out by strong alliances. We have some trusty allies ourselves and fought side by side with them in numerous wars. In return, we are supplied with the finest weapons and armour that their blacksmiths produce. Finally, we want to remind you of another option. If you think your country needs permanent protection from a bigger power or if you see no other way to avoid ruin, you may choose to submit to another lord as his vassal. This is not necessarily disgraceful and humiliating as vassals are usually rewarded for their good service with land, gold or goods from their\
 feudal lords. And they enjoy the protection of their Lord in a war.§($1,-1)\n§§
BT_LEITFADEN_6 (//)
                                               'A Guide for new sovereigns'\n\nChapter 6 'The future'\n\nNow that we have shown you some important things needed for a lasting rulership in the past chapters, we won't forget to turn our gaze to the future.\n\nYou have many ways open to you in which to succeed on Tamar. It is your choice and your responsibility, no matter if you choose to be a merchant, a conqueror, a mercenary or a diplomate.\n\nFor a long time, we chose the path of the warrior and the conqueror. We fought countless battles and many realms crumbled to dust under our attacks. But even though we emerged from all this as a great power, this way isn't the only one or even the right one.We were reliant on smaller countries that were able to produce many weapons because of their rich resources, combined with a small population and on others who mainly produced grain for export. In short, all the things that we couldn't produce in our own economy because it was so focused on\
 supporting our wars. We bought from the small trader nations and they made a living from it.\n\nSometimes we had to take help from neutral countries who acted as mediators in difficult negotiations. In the beginning of our rulership, we were glad to have the help of mercenaries to save us from the orcs. This help wasn't for free, but it was better to buy help than to perish.While our power grew, some smaller countries submitted themselves to our reign and became our vassals. In return, they received from us land and other gifts. Most of these lords came to us freely, because life as a vassal isn't the worst option after all. They always enjoyed our protection and thanked us with their unbroken loyalty.\n\nOnly you can limit what you can achieve, if you fight the battles or try to end them, if you carry the sword or sell it. You are the master of your fate. Prove yourself worthy!§($1,-1)\n§§
BT_BANK (//)
                                                                 Bank robberyThe local banks work schedule seemed to be the same as normal this morning. The cashier, who was called Torin, was the same as I always used. He took the money bags filled with our taxes and I left. He would count the gold coins, and fill different leather bags with specific set amounts of gold. At this time of day Torin was still pretty much alone in the small bank building, in which the banks gold was also kept. The only other person there was his apprentice, who was learning how to handle the taxes.Suddenly the door flew open with a bang and in stormed several men. Masks covered their faces and they wore plain black clothes. Swords hung at their belts and bow and arrows sat across their chests. They immediately jumped over the counter and bound and gagged the two cashiers. They rapidly collected up the gold lying on the tables but were not satisfied with the amount. They made Torin give them the key for the\
 safe room in the cellar. This had been built with especially thick walls and with a strong iron door and only two keys existed for this room. The chief cashier carries one around his neck, and the other is kept in your residence.In his fear Torin did not think to offer any resistance but gave them the key quickly. The robbers did not take all of the gold, only so much that it would not hamper their escape. As fast as they had come they disappeared again, this time by the small back door, which let on to a quiet yard and then into the nearby forest where they could dissappear undiscovered.§($1,>)§§Meanwhile Torin and the young apprentice were still laying on the floor, bound and gagged behind the counter of the bank, unable to call for assistance. A short time later luck favoured them both with the help they needed. Torin's wife had noticed that her man had left his lunch at home. He was not as young as he used to be and had grown more forgetful over the years. So she took the small\
 basket filled with bread, cheese and bacon, and went the short distance to the bank, mumbling about the forgetfulness of her husband. Torin was not at his usual place, but when she walked around the side of the counter she found him and his apprentice bound together on the floor, tucked under the counter.She untied them both and Torin ran to the guardhouse, where a small troop of soldier was always stationed, to uphold the law and order in the city. While Torin struggled to catch his breath, Tar Elbrun, the Captain, was called for and came out of his small office. It was immediately clear to him that something bad had happened, as Torin was well known by everyone to never leave the bank during its office hours. Torin explained what had happened and gave as good a description of the men as possible. Tar Elbrun gave his men instructions to make the horses ready and a few minutes later the troop set out after the robbers.It was hard work following the fleeing men, since their tracks went\
 through a hard-to-travel area. Fortunately some of Tar Elbrun's men had, in former times, earned their living as hunters and trackers and were therefore masters in pursuit. All day long they tracked the thieves, but their lead seemed to grow, as they obviously knew the area better than Tar's men. The tracks led toward a thick area of forest and as dusk started to settle they reached its edge. The trackers found a fresh track, which led into the close underbrush. The thieves had taken no precautions to hide their route and had obviously not thought that anyone would follow them so fast.§($2,<,>)§§With night fast approaching Tar Elbrun decided that he would have to end the pursuit for the night. The men put their horses to feed, made camp and soon fell into a heavy sleep. With the first light of dawn however they prepared themselves to once again take up the hunt for the thieves.Suddenly one of the men noticed the smell of a campfire. They left the horses tethered at the edge of the\
 forest and carefully pushed deeper into the forest. They quickly came to the edge of a small clearing and could hardly believe what they saw there. The robbers were sat comfortably around a small fire and apparently felt perfectly safe, with no need for any guards. How were they to know that luck had brought assistance to their victims so quickly?The captain instructed his men to surround the clearing, quickly and quietly. When they were in place he called to the gang of thieves, 'This is Tar Elbrun, captain of the city guard. You are surrounded! Put down your weapons and walk towards me slowly!'Fortunately, he had placed himself behind a tree when he had said this, because the answer came in the form of an arrow which, even though it was only a random shot, drove itself deep into the trunk of the tree he was standing behind.That was the last error that particular thief ever made, as one of the soldiers who carried a huntsman's bow took aim and killed him where he stood before he had\
 time to reload. The other thieves quickly put down their weapons and slowly walked towards their captors. The soldiers bound them by the wrists and led them from the forest on short ropes. The bags with the gold in, which had been placed in a heap next to the fire, had to be carried to the edge of the forest by the prisoners.There Tar Elbrun fastened the bags of gold onto the horses saddlebags, mounted his men and rode the troop home, happy that they had managed to capture the thieves so quickly. The thieves however, were not so happy: they were bound together with a long rope and had to run the whole way back behind the troop.When they got back to the city shortly after night-fall, the soldiers held a meeting to discuss what should happen to the robbers and the gold, now that the bank was closed. Since there was no dungeon in the soldiers' camp the prisoners in were locked up in the back rooms of the guardhouse. The bags of gold were placed in Tar Elbrun's room, which he locked\
 carefully. Before he left he assigned four of his men to guard the prisoners, who would spend the night in the guardhouse.§($2,<,>)§§The next morning Tar Elbrun, still happy from the success of the day before, entered the army camp merrily whistling a jolly tune. However the sight that met him when he entered the guardhouse made the blood in his veins freeze. In the front room, by the door to the rear area, one of his men lay dead. The door was wide open, as were the doors to the two rooms in  hich the prisoners had been locked up and laying spread out in the corridor were the other three men, also dead.Apparently the robbers had succeeded in breaking open the doors and overwhelming the poor guards. The fourth man, whose corpse Tar Elbrun had found in the front room, had probably tried to escape from the guardhouse in order to call for assistance but had been taken down by the fleeing prisoners. As Elbrun entered his own room he knew what to find, the splintered wood of the door told\
 him that the gold had also been taken.The captain immediately called an alarm and a short time later had gathered a large troop of men who, under his guidance, started hunting for the robbers for a second time. This time however they were hunting for murderers, not just thieves.Unfortunately this time their luck had run out. The cowardly murderers had learned from their mistakes and had travelled much further,without resting. This time they had also covered their tracks so well that even the best trackers in Elbrun's group could not follow them. The only information the men of Tar Elbrun could give him was that the thieves had headed in the direction of the mountains. They would have great difficulty in finding them there and would probably not succeed at all.It became clear, that a pursuit would be pointless and the men turned back home. It had also become clear that a facility is urgently needed, in which criminals could be safely kept with no chance of escape.§($2,<,-1)§§

                            Drought\n\n\nYour mind is heavy with worries as you gaze upon the wide fields of grain. For months not a single drop of rain has fallen and there is not one cloud in the piercing blue sky. Since the last year was very dry as well, you fear that the dry period will stay for several more years. Also, all of the scholars you consulted predicted bad harvests for several years to come. Your administrator comes up to you, and you can see he doesn't have good news to bring. As if it wasn't bad enough that the ears dry out on the stems and the harvest will be very low, fires are reported from different parts of your country. They destroy large parts of your fields and your men are hardly able to contain them. More bad new is waiting in your residence: the messenger you sent out to the other Lords in the surrounding area, hoping to find someone who would sell you some grain, returned with empty hands. Your land isn't the only one suffering from the drought.\
 Everywhere, grain is sparse and the first deaths from hunger have been reported throughout the land. Now it is important to make wise decisions and to not give all the remaining grain to the people, even if this means that many will become hungry. But you have to keep enough grain for seeding next spring. Better weather and a rich harvest will return one day.§($1,-1)§§

                                                            Town occupationThis morning you are riding in front of your troops into the town that you have finally taken over. As you see the destruction to the right and left of the street, you are reminded of a section of a book your bard uses to recite from occasionally. It was written by the Count Kar Enil, who ruled on Tamar a long time ago and left behind some of his adventures (mostly of the warlike kind) in some kind of journal. Just a few days ago, your bard recited this part of the book:Storowo, first week of May in the year 3780(about 500 Years before King Abanor - Remark of the chronicler)Belon sent me his latest report regarding the siege of Stierfeld yesterday. Finally the town has fallen, after more than 9 months of siege and the deaths of thousands of men. He has mobilized all of his men again, who were barely able to fight after the long months of waiting, but Belon was always a master of incentive speech.And so they ran\
 against the walls one more time and tried to break the gates. Finally, when it seemed that they would fail yet again, some men of Belons' personal guard managed to climb the walls near the southern gate and fight their way to the gate itself. When they opened it, my men entered the town like a swarm of locusts.On their way to the residence of Sigurd, they came across the last line of defense. Everyone who could hold a weapon, even old men, women and young lads that were almost children fought together with the last few of the towns' guardsmen. But to no avail. Under the leadership of Belon, my men took over street by street. Hardly a house was undamaged, fires flickered everywhere and most of the important buildings were made mere ruins.As they reached the residence, they found nothing but chaos. The main house was burned to the ground, the stores were empty and devastated, Sigurd's famous treasury was nowhere to be found. We don't know if he spent all the money on the war or if it\
 was stolen during the siege.§($1,-1)§§

The weapons are ordered, some experienced instructors have been hired and the drill ground is finished. It may not be very impressive, but it will fulfill its purpose. There are tents to house the recruits, a parade ground is outlined on the ground and larger tents for the officers are also already in place. In front of one tent, there is a table with some maps on it. Some veteran soldiers are standing around them and are discussing the best strategies with which to defend your borders.One of the officers is busy recruiting new men. They are lined up in front of his table while he takes their names and writes them down in his list. Then he assigns them to the different arms of the service. Big and strong men are suited best for the infantry, while those with experience of longbows and crossbows are put into artillery training. Skilled riders are perfect candidates\
 for the cavalry.A number of infantrymen are exercising battle formations on the parade ground, while on the sidelines, other soldiers are training to fight with swords and shields. A group of archers are practicing a little farther away. Quite a few arrows miss the targets, but in a few weeks these men will be terrific marksmen.A few yards away you can see the armourer. He's looking at a pile of carefully stacked weapons and armour that has just been delivered from the blacksmiths. He inspects them all very carefully and then adds them to his inventory list. He's especially keen to check the shields, helmets and body armour, as these might one day be the only thing that will make the difference between life and death to one of the young men here if they should need to go into battle. §($1,-1)§§

                                                  The old mineYou have just sat down and are bent over your clerks reports concerning the inland revenue when a servant announces that a little boy from the settlement wishes to talk to you. Wondering what the nipper wants you let him be brought in.The boy has barely entered the room when a stream of words floods out of him. This morning, as usual, he went to put the sheep belonging to his father out to graze at the mountain pasture and to keep an eye on them. The day had been passing especially slowly for the man-child so he started to examine some nearby rocks a little bit. He completely forgot about the sheep even though he knew that if his father had to later search and round up the wandering sheep then he would get a spanking.Much more important to the boy was the discovery which he made in the rocks: an ancient entrance to a mine which looked like it had been deserted for decades! Sensibly enough he had thought to come tell his\
 elders rather than risk going into the mine himself.\nYou send the boy to the courts kitchen with instructions that he should be given a piece of cake while you consider the options you now have:1. Forget about the whole matter? (Proceed with button 'I')2. Examine the mine? (Proceed with button 'II')§($2,3,2)§§The next morning you start off early and follow the way the boy had described to you. He would have loved to join you, but his father was still angry about his lack of care for the sheep. Therefore the man-child had had to stay at home and clear the stables of dung.After some searching you find the specific rock, surrounded by bramble, which the boy had mentioned. He had explained to you exactly at which spot he pushed through the bushes to the entrance of the mine.After a long search you finally find the passage. Due to the boy being much smaller and thinner than an adult while trying to find the mines entrance you gain some light bruises.After some prodding and poking you\
 finally succeed, because the mines entrance is right before you. Everything has a very old and ruinous impression to it. The beams in the mine-shaft are partly rotten or broken. It cracks and creaks all around. It seems to be quite a dangerous passage. What next?1. This seems rather pointless to you and you turn back. (Proceed with button 'I')2. You summon up your courage and step into the gallery.(Proceed with button 'II')§($2,3,5)§§You are not so sure the mine is worth exploring anymore and the spirit of adventure has left you. With lots of effort you fight your way back through the thorny bushes. You have barely taken a few steps when suddenly the mine entrance collapses behind you with a loud crash. Within seconds everything is covered with dust, including parts of your waistcoat. You realise you survived that by the skin of your teeth. As you reach your residence some hours later the horror of the collapse is already forgotten and you consider if you could make a profit from the\
 mine after all.1. You decide there is no profit to be had excavating the mine and have soon forgotten the entire incident. (Proceed with button 'I')2. You decide to return with some experienced men and suitable tools to open the mine entrance, hoping that something precious will be found inside. (Proceed with button 'II')§($2,6,4)§§You lead some men who are experienced in mining to the ancient mine site. On your command they open the old mine entrance and reinforce the pillars. They discover that in ages past several types of gems were mined here. The wages for the men and the materials which had to be bought did not come cheap, but the miners find some usable gems that should cover those costs. After some time however, it is obvious that this mine will produce nothing more and you let the entrance be resealed with earth. By selling the few usable gems you get a return of XX gold coins.§($1,-1)§§You decide that you want to dare to enter the mine. You quickly light the torch you carry\
 and carefully make your way inside the mine. The passage creaks and fine dust trickles from the ceiling. A short way in you find an alcove with some old mining tools. There also stands a small, half broken table with a little leather bag on top. You recognise the bag as the type traders use at the weekly market. Gems are carried in it and you decide that this was probably a gem mine in former times. You go a bit further, but the passage ends after a few more feet. It seems that the mine was not very productive and was shut down after a short time.Then it happens: A loud crack, followed by a horrible rumbling and crashing! The passageway collapses between you and the exit. You are trapped! What should you do now? The torch will not burn for long and you are faced with a lonely death in the darkness. If the passage has been completely blocked you will starve to death or run out of air and suffocate!Totally discouraged you sit down on a stone and await your destiny. What else can you\
 do?Time goes by, the torch glows only a little now and soon it will fade out completely. Several hours have passed since the cave-in, but then you recognize a sound from the other side of the point of collapse. It sounds.....yes, really.....a human voice!A short time later they make a small gap in the blockage and you see that your rescuers are some of the inhabitants from your settlement. They start digging carefully and after a few hours it is clear and you are free! The collapse was not as bad as it had seemed to you, only a few pillars were broken and some fairly big boulders had fallen from the ceiling. But in the dark room which was lit only badly from the torch it had seemed much worse to you.As you catch sight of daylight again you thank the men who rescued you. One of the men tell you that the rescue was due to the little boy. He had gotten worried when he had not heard from you in hours, because you had promised to report to him quickly if you found something exciting. He\
 had told his father that he feared that something had happened to you and his father had mobilized the small search party that finally found you. This had not been too difficult however because of the dust cloud caused by the collapse of the passageway, which could be seen from quite far away.Back in town you reward the men with lots of praise and XX gold coins. You can not stop thinking about the mine however and you decide to keep on exploring it. This time though you want to treat the matter more professionally and not to dare it on your own again. (Proceed with button 'I')§($1,4)§§You decide that the mine is now safe and that the entrance is completely covered with soil, which means that it is impossible for anyone to be lost or hurt there anymore. You also put up a warning sign, but fairly soon everyone forgets about the old mine which had been there. The safe-guarding costs you XX gold coins.§($1,-1)§§

                                             Gaukler, Clowns und flinke Finger\n\nWieder einmal sitzt Ihr ein wenig gelangweilt in Eurer Residenz. Die Geschäfte laufen vor sich hin, Eure Anwesenheit auf dem Schlachtfeld ist nicht erforderlich und ueberhaupt war in letzter Zeit nicht viel los in Eurem Reich. Gerade beginnt Ihr ernsthaft darueber nachzudenken, wie Ihr wohl die quälende Langeweile bekämpfen könntet. Ob es wohl Eurem Ruf sehr schaden würde, wenn Ihr mal wieder eine zünftige Schlägerei in der örtlichen Taverne vom Zaune brechen würdet?\nZum Glück wird die Gefahr einiger mittelschwerer Blessuren durch ein energisches Klopfen an Eurer Tür gebannt. Draußen steht eine der Torwachen, welche Euch meldet, daß eine Truppe von Gauklern und Zirkusleuten Einlaß in den Ort begehrt. \nHmmm, schaden wird's wohl nicht und endlich ist wieder mal was los; also laßt Ihr den Gauklern ausrichten, daß sie willkommen sind. Es wäre doch gelacht, wenn sich aus dieser unverhofften Abwechslung nicht\
 auch noch etwas Kapital fuer das stets etwas unterernährte Staatssäckel schlagen ließe. Also frisch ans Werk und schnell den Zollbeamten Nachricht gegeben, daß die Gaukler doch bitteschön den üblichen Wegezoll entrichten sollten, da sie schließlich auch Einnahmen in Eurem Ort hätten.\nWieviel Zoll wollt Ihr fordern?\n\n1. Ihr seid recht bescheiden und wollt die Zirkusleute nicht gleich verärgern und nehmt deshalb nur 1000 Goldstücke Zoll. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Ihr denkt Euch, daß die Leute hier auch einen ordentlichen Gewinn einfahren werden und wollt auch nicht zu kurz kommen. Deswegen nehmt Ihr 3000 Goldstücke Zoll. (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n§($2,2,3)\n§§\nAufgrund Eurer bescheidenen Zollforderungen verlangen die Gaukler für ihre Vorstellungen im Ort nur ein geringes Eintrittsgeld. Die Einwohner strömen sehr zahlreich zu den Aufführungen. Da Ihr in weiser Voraussicht mit dem Zirkuschef eine Beteiligung an den Eintrittspreisen ausgehandelt habt, könnt Ihr 5000 Goldstücke an\
 Einnahmen verbuchen. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,4)\n§§\nAufgrund Eurer ueberhöhten Zollforderung verlangen die Gaukler ein recht hohes Eintrittsgeld. Viele Einwohner Eures Reiches können den hohen Preis nicht aufbringen und murren über Eure Gier. Ihr verliert 10 Vertrauenspunkte!\nZwar habt Ihr mit dem Zirkuschef eine Beteiligung an den Eintrittspreisen ausgehandelt, aber durch die geringen Zuschauerzahlen erhaltet Ihr nur 1500 Goldstücke fuer Eure Kasse. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,4)\n§§\nNachdem der Zirkus einige Tage in der Stadt gastiert hat, bittet Euch eine Abordnung der Gaukler um ein Gespräch. Der Zirkus hat durch seine geringen Transportkapazitäten zu wenig Korn für die Tiere zur Verfügung und es ist auch nicht genug Geld da, um ausreichend Korn nachzukaufen. Man bittet Euch um eine Gratisspende von 20000 Maß Korn. Was wollt Ihr tun?\n\n1. Ihr seid einverstanden und spendet das Korn. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Ihr lehnt entrüstet ab, weil Ihr der Meinung seid, daß die\
 Zirkusleute nur billig an Korn kommen wollen, obwohl sie es auch kaufen könnten. (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n§($2,5,6)\n§§\nAus Eurem Kornvorrat werden 20000 Maß Korn an die Gaukler ausgegeben. In einer der nächsten Vorstellungen spricht der Zirkusdirektor Euch öffentlich Dank fuer Eure großzügige Hilfe aus, was dazu führt, daß die Einwohner Eures Reiches Euch noch mehr achten. Ihr erhaltet 5 Vertrauenspunkte dazu. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,7)\n§§\nDie Gaukler sind ziemlich erbost ueber Euren Geiz und die Tatsache, daß Ihr ihnen Unehrlichkeit unterstellt habt. In den nächsten Vorstellungen des Zirkus ziehen einige Clowns regelmässig über Euch her. Es fallen zwar keine Namen, aber alle Besucher der Vorstellung wissen, daß Ihr gemeint seid. Ihr verliert erheblich Ansehen unter Eurer Bevölkerung und damit auch 10 Vertrauenspunkte. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,7)\n§§\nNach einigen Tagen wollt Ihr natürlich auch etwas Abwechslung genießen und Ihr beschließt, eine Vorstellung des Zirkus zu\
 besuchen. Man grüßt Euch von allen Seiten ehrfürchtig. Die meisten Einwohner hätten gar nicht erwartet, Euch bei solch einfachen Vergnügungen zu sehen. Die Gaukler haben offenbar auch nicht mit Eurem Besuch gerechnet und so muß erst eilig eine Euch geziemende Sitzgelegenheit aufgebaut werden. Schließlich kann es aber losgehen und der Zirkusdirektor begrüßt die Zuschauer. Er läßt es sich auch nicht nehmen, Eure Anwesenheit nochmals allen bekanntzugeben. Nach einigen Darbietungen, die Ihr recht erheiternd und\nunterhaltsam findet, kommen endlich die besonders von den Kindern heiß ersehnten Clowns dran. Nach einigen harmlosen Späßen kommt einer der Narren auf Euch zu und bittet Euch in die Manege. Es ist klar, daß die Jungs sich einen kleinen Spaß mit Euch machen wollen. \nWerdet Ihr der Aufforderung folgen?\n\n1. Ihr wehrt ab und drückt Euch unter einigen fadenscheinigen Ausreden. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Na klar geht Ihr darauf ein. Es ist doch sonst nichts los und Ihr traut Euch\
 durchaus zu, einige Späße auf Eure Kosten zu ertragen. (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n§($2,8,9)\n§§\nEin Murren geht durch die Reihen der Zuschauer. Sie sind der Meinung, daß sich auch ein Dienstherr wie Ihr nicht zu fein sollte, mit dem einfachen Volk umzugehen. Man hält Euch für ziemlich hochnäsig und gelegentlich ist sogar das Wort 'Feigling' zu hören. Ihr verliert 10 Vertrauenspunkte! (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,12)\n§§\nEs kommt, wie es kommen mußte: Die Clowns treiben einige wirklich derbe Späße mit Euch. Sie schubsen Euch, sie ziehen Euch den angebotenen Stuhl unterm Hintern weg und schliesslich werdet Ihr auch noch mit einem Eimer Wasser überschüttet. Das Publikum ist begeistert, weil ihr Dienstherr mal so richtig zum Gespött gemacht wird. Was tut Ihr?\n\n1. Ihr seid keineswegs belustigt und reagiert wütend und aufgebracht. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Ihr nehmt es einfach locker und albert ausgelassen mit den Clowns mit. (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n§($2,10,11)\n§§\nIhr seid sehr\
 wütend und zieht schimpfend ab. Wie ein begossener Pudel ergreift Ihr die Flucht vor dem nächsten Wassereimer und flieht unter dem Gelächter der Zuschauer aus der Manege. Das war ja wohl nicht gerade sehr dienlich für Euer Ansehen unter den Einheimischen. Ihr verliert 10 Vertrauenspunkte! (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,12)\n§§\nIhr schafft es tatsächlich, den Clowns Paroli zu bieten und habt bald auch einige Lacher auf Eurer Seite. Die Zuschauer sind begeistert, als sie sehen, dass Ihr auch einfach mal Spaß haben könnt. Noch tagelang ist Euer gelungener Auftritt in aller Munde und entgegen Euren Befürchtungen, durch diesen Auftritt an Respekt verloren zu haben, lobt man überall Eure Volksnähe. Ihr gewinnt 10 Vertrauenspunkte! (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,12)\n§§\nAm nächsten Tag schlendert Ihr morgens gemütlich durch Eure Siedlung und gelangt dabei auch zu dem Platz, auf dem die Zirkusleute ihre Wagen und Zelte aufgestellt haben. Dabei fällt Euch ein kleineres Zelt auf, das etwas\
 abseits steht. Als Ihr nicht mehr allzuweit davon entfernt seid, seht Ihr ein junges Mädchen mit langen schwarzen Haaren aus dem Zelt treten. Die junge Frau ist wirklich sehr schön, auch ihre recht einfache und etwas verschlissene Kleidung tut ihrer Schönheit keinen Abbruch. Besonders fallen Euch ihre dunklen Augen auf, welche Euch freundlich anblicken.\nSie bittet Euch ins Zelt und erklärt Euch, daß sie die Zukunft voraussagen könne. Für den wahrhaft stattlichen Betrag von 2000 Goldstücken will sie Euch weissagen. Was tut Ihr?\n\n1. Ihr glaubt doch nicht an solchen Unsinn und dann auch noch für solche Unsummen. Die reinste Geldschneiderei! Ohne Euch!! (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Was soll's, eh Euch wieder die Langeweile packt laßt Ihr's drauf ankommen. Ihr schickt flugs einen Vertrauten in Eure Residenz, der Euch das Gold holt und bezahlt dann den geforderten Betrag. Erwartungsvoll betretet Ihr das Zelt. (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n§($2,13,14)\n§§\nIhr beendet Euren Rundgang und kehrt\
 in die Residenz zurück. Drei Tage später, Ihr habt die Sache längst vergessen, stürmt plötzlich ein völlig aufgeregter Kornverwalter in Eure wöchentliche Kartenspielrunde in der örtlichen Taverne. Er ruft immer wieder 'Feurio, Feurio'. Nur mit Mühe könnt Ihr ihn soweit beruhigen, daß er Euch erzählt, was eigentlich los ist. Er berichtet hastig, daß eines Eurer Kornlager vollkommen unerwartet in Brand geraten ist. Er und die anderen im Kornlager beschäftigten Leute hätten den Brand zwar schnell unter Kontrolle gehabt, jedoch seien 15000 Maß Korn ein Raub der Flammen geworden. Als Ihr an jenem Abend in Euren Privaträumen am Kamin sitzt, fällt Euch wieder die Wahrsagerin ein. Vielleicht hätte Euch etwas mehr Glaube an ihre Fähigkeiten diesen Verlust ersparen können?! (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,17)\n§§\nAls Ihr den Vorhang am Zelteingang zurueckschlagt und eintretet, umfängt Euch schnell eine beklemmende Atmosphäre, die durch die düsteren Lichtverhältnisse und die abgestandene Luft im\
 Zelt aufkommt. Die junge Frau bittet Euch an einen kleinen Tisch und nimmt Euch gegenüber Platz. Auf dem Tisch steht eine große Kugel aus Glas auf einem dunklen Tuch. Sie\nläßt beschwörend ihre Hände ueber der Kugel kreisen und diese füllt sich allmählich mit weißem Rauch. Dann senkt die Zigeunerin ihren Blick auf die Kugel. Sie schaut lange hinein und scheint dabei völlig geistesabwesend zu sein. Wieder fallen Euch ihre Augen auf, in denen sich der Widerschein der im Zelt aufgestellten Kerzen spiegelt. Plötzlich schüttelt sie ihren Kopf und blickt Euch an. Sie sagt zu Euch, daß sie seltsamerweise keinen Blick in Eure persönliche Zukunft werfen konnte, aber sie hat ein Feuer gesehen, daß offenbar in Kürze in einem Eurer Kornlager ausbrechen wird. Tschja, was nun?\n\n1. Ihr glaubt der Wahrsagerin. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Ihr glaubt der Wahrsagerin nicht. (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n§($2,15,16)\n§§\nIhr wißt nicht genau, warum Ihr der Wahrsagerin eigentlich glaubt, aber da ist\
 vielleicht doch was dran. Außerdem ist Euch noch etwas sehr merkwürdiges aufgefallen. Ihr werdet Euch hüten, es irgend jemandem zu erzählen, aber kurz vor dem Ende der Sitzung habt Ihr für einen kurzen Moment ein Bild in der Kugel der Zigeunerin erkennen können. Es war eins Eurer Kornlager und eine schwarze Rauchwolke stieg über dem Gebäude auf.\nDavon überzeugt, daß die Frau die Wahrheit gesprochen hat, bedankt Ihr Euch für die Warnung und geht sofort in Eure Residenz zurück. Dort angelangt, laßt Ihr die Kornverwalter zu Euch kommen und ermahnt sie (selbstverständlich, ohne die Wahrsagerin mit einem einzigen Wort zu\nerwähnen), in Zukunft besonders aufmerksame Kontrollgänge in den Lagern zu machen. Einige Tage später wird Euch tatsächlich ein Feuer in einem Eurer wichtigsten Kornlager gemeldet. Zum Glück ist der Schaden sehr gering, weil der zuständige Verwalter aufgrund Eurer Ermahnungen gerade einen zusätzlichen Kontrollgang unternahm und das Feuer schon im Keim ersticken konnte.\
 So verliert Ihr nur 500 Maß Korn. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,17)\n§§\nNa das war ja eine Enttäuschung. 2000 Goldstücke und alles was dabei rauskommt ist irgendein schleierhaftes Gefasel von Gefahr und Feuer. Ziemlich mißgelaunt verlaßt Ihr das Zelt der Wahrsagerin. Der Abschied fällt ziemlich frostig aus. Die Zigeunerin merkt genau, dass Ihr kein Wort der Vorhersage glaubt, aber sie scheint darüber gar nicht ärgerlich zu sein. Vielmehr schaut sie Euch lange hinterher. Dann dreht sie sich mit einem Kopfschütteln um und murmelt vor sich hin: 'Glaube oder nicht, Feuer wird brennen'. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,13)\n§§\nIhr erhaltet von einem Bediensteten die Nachricht, daß die Gaukler in Kürze weiterreisen wollen und bereits ihre Zelte abbrechen. Da gerade nichts anderes anliegt, beschließt Ihr, zum Zirkus hinunterzugehen und den Vorbereitungen zum Aufbruch der Gaukler zuzuschauen. Ihr steht schon eine ganze Weile am Rande des Platzes und beobachtet das Treiben, als sich Euch\neine\
 etwas seltsam aussehende Gestalt nähert.\nDer Mann, wobei das Wort 'Mann' etwas übertrieben wirkt, denn die Gestalt ist nur etwa 1,20m groß, ist ganz offensichtlich ein Angehöriger des Zwergenvolkes. Er trägt einfache Kleidung, eine Lederhose, ein dunkles Hemd, welches von einem breiten Ledergürtel zusammengehalten wird. In dem Gürtel stecken seine Waffen, ein großer Dolch und eine wirklich gefährlich aussehende zweischneidige Kampfaxt. Diese hat allerdings auch schon bessere Zeiten gesehen, denn die Klingen sind schartig und auch schon leicht angerostet.\nDer kleine Kerl spricht Euch an:'Hallo, ich könnte mir vorstellen, daß sie einem kleinen Spielchen nicht abgeneigt wären. Vielleicht gelingt es ihnen, mir einige Goldstücke abzunehmen.' \nAlles an dem Zwerg sieht nach einem Taschenspieler aus. Die Augenklappe, die er trägt, rundet das Bild von einem überaus durchtriebenen Halsabschneider perfekt ab, aber Euch packt der Übermut.\nOhne lange darüber nachzudenken, daß das kleinwüchsige\
 Schlitzohr wahrscheinlich in jeder Stadt die selbe Masche abzieht und den Leuten mit üblen Tricks das Geld aus der Tasche zieht, geht Ihr auf sein Angebot ein und begleitet ihn zu einem Tisch, welcher vor einem der Zelte steht.\nSchnell seid ihr euch einig, was die Art des Spieles und vor allem die Höhe des Einsatzes anbelangt. Ihr spielt Karten und das Limit ist der Himmel.\nAuf welche Art möchtet Ihr gegen den Zwerg spielen?\n\n1. Ihr spielt ganz ehrlich gegen den Zwerg, denn Ihr seid davon überzeugt, daß Ihr ihm auf diese Art einige Münzen abluchsen könnt. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Der elende kleine Wicht muß dran glauben! Mit allen Falschspielertricks werdet Ihr dem Zwerg die Goldstücke abnehmen. (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n§($2,18,19)\n§§\nHmm, also entweder habt Ihr alles verlernt, was Ihr aus Eurer Jugend noch über Kartenspiele zu wissen glaubtet oder der Zwerg spielt einfach wesentlich besser als Ihr. Möglicherweise spielt er auch falsch, aber Ihr traut Euch durchaus zu, sowas\
 zu erkennen. In Eurer Jugend habt Ihr schließlich manche Nacht in der Taverne verbracht und den durchreisenden Händlern mit einigen Tricks ihr sauer verdientes Geld abgenommen. Da sind Euch so ziemlich alle\nKniffe vertraut, aber Ihr könnt dem Zwerg nichts nachweisen. Ihr wollt ihn natürlich auch nicht gerade heraus darauf ansprechen, denn er könnte ja beschließen, daß die Axt an seinem Gürtel mal wieder in Aktion treten sollte. Also tut Ihr so, als ob nichts wäre und zieht nach etwa einer Stunde Spiel mit einem Minus von 5000 Goldstücken ab. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,20)\n§§\nNun, das war ja wohl eine böse Fehlentscheidung! Noch ehe Ihr richtig begreift, was vor sich geht, hat Euch der Zwerg eine ziemliche Summe abgenommen. Obwohl Ihr in Eurer Jugend viele Falschspielertricks gelernt und auch jahrelang in dunklen Tavernenhinterzimmern praktiziert habt, scheint der Zwerg dagegen vollkommen gefeit zu sein. Als es Euch endlich dämmert, ist es schon zu spät. Euer Gegenüber hat\
 wahrscheinlich von Anfang an gemerkt, daß Ihr ihn unfair besiegen wolltet und hat Eure Gier gegen Euch eingesetzt. Er hat es ausgenutzt, dass Ihr von Euren Fähigkeiten als Trickspieler so überzeugt wart, daß Ihr gar nicht bemerkt habt, wie er Euch immer mehr Geld abgenommen hat. Nun, wo Euch klar ist, wie die Sache läuft, findet Ihr hastig einen Vorwand, um das Spiel zu beenden. Dann macht Ihr Euch schnell aus dem Staub, begleitet vom lauten Lachen des Zwerges, welcher dabei fröhlich den schweren Lederbeutel schüttelt, in welchen er seinen Gewinn geschüttet hat. Ihr habt stolze 15000 Gol\n\ndstücke verloren! \n(Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,20)\n§§\nIhr seid wirklich sauer! Der Taschenspieler hat Euch eine gehörige Summe Gold abgenommen. Mittlererweile seid Ihr auch der festen Überzeugung, daß er Euch das Gold nicht so ganz ehrlich abgenommen hat. Wollt Ihr die Sache so auf sich beruhen lassen?\n\n1. He, was solls? Der Zwerg hat das Gold, damit genug des Ärgers. Ihr laßt ihn unbehelligt\
 ziehen. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Nicht mit Euch! Der Zwerg wird merken, daß er damit nicht davonkommt! (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n§($2,21,22)\n§§\nIst es denn zu fassen? Da habt Ihr nun beschlossen, die ganze Sache zu vergessen und was machen diese Zirkusleute? Brechen in Eure Residenz ein und rauben eine Truhe mit Gold. Aufgrund der Aussage einiger Wachen und einer gefundenen Spielkarte seid Ihr ziemlich sicher, daß der kleine Spieler an dem Raub beteiligt war. Als Ihr einige Wachen zum Zirkus\nschickt, um die Übeltäter zu verhaften, stellt sich heraus, daß diese bei Nacht und Nebel abgereist sind. Ihr verliert 10000 Goldstücke. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,23)\n§§\nIhr schickt eine Truppe bewaffneter Wachen und laßt den Zwerg wegen Falschspieles verhaften. In der darauffolgenden Nacht wird er jedoch von seinen Leuten aus dem örtlichen Gefängnis befreit. Es stellt sich des weiteren heraus, daß die dreisten Spitzbuben in der gleichen Nacht auch noch in Eure Residenz eingebrochen\
 sind und dort mehrere Truhen mit Gold gestohlen haben! Als Ihr den Diebstahl am nächsten Morgen bemerkt, werdet Ihr beinahe zeitgleich auch von der Flucht des Taschenspielers unterrichtet. Die zum Zirkus geschickten Wachen kommen leider zu spät, denn die ganze Gauklertruppe ist bei Nacht und Nebel geflohen. Ihr verliert durch den Raub 30000 Goldstücke. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n§($1,23)\n§§\nBisher wart Ihr vielleicht nur ärgerlich, aber jetzt seid Ihr wirklich wütend. So kommen Euch diese Ganoven nicht davon! Ihr stellt sofort einen Trupp bewaffneter Männer zusammen und verfolgt mit ihnen die Spur der Gaukler.\nIn einem Wäldchen nahe der Stadt holt Ihr sie ein, da die schweren Wagen mit den Zirkusutensilien ihre Flucht behindern. Schnell umzingelt Ihr den kleinen Tross und dann gebt Ihr den Männern den Befehl, die Wagen zu durchsuchen. Sie finden die Euch gestohlenen Goldstücke und noch einiges Gold mehr, insgesamt 50000 Goldstücke. Ihr laßt alles auf ein Packpferd laden. \nGerade gebt\
 Ihr den Befehl zum Abrücken, als urplötzlich aus einem der Wagen eine alte Frau auftaucht. Sie sieht kurz in die Runde und kaum, daß sie das Geschehen erfaßt hat, beginnt sie schon mit einer seltsam dunklen und fremdartigen Stimme zu sprechen. Soweit Ihr das verstehen könnt, verflucht sie Euch und Eure Stadt! Sie belegt Euer Korn mit einem Fluch, der angeblich bewirkt, daß die Körner in den Lagern verfaulen. Euch ist durchaus bewußt, daß in einem Land voller Magie so ein Fluch sehr schnell Wahrheit werden kann und Euch wird ziemlich flau im Magen. Was wollt Ihr tun?\n\n1. Den Fluch nicht beachten? (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Das beschlagnahmte Gold zurückgeben und Euch bei der alten Zigeunerin entschuldigen? (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n\n3. Das beschlagnahmte Gold zurückgeben und noch 10000 Goldstücke drauflegen gegen Zurücknahme des Fluches? (Weiter mit Knopf 'III')\n§($3,24,25,26)\n§§\nOh oh, das hättet Ihr aber besser wissen sollen. Einen solchen Fluch sollte man nicht\
 unterschätzen!\nIhr reitet mit dem erbeuteten Gold davon, wobei Euch und Eure Männer noch lange das Gezeter der alten Frau begleitet. Kaum seid Ihr jedoch in Eurer Residenz angelangt, ereilt Euch die schlimme Botschaft: Das Korn verdirbt in den Kornlagern. \nIn allen Lagern befällt eine Fäulnis das Korn. Nichts kann den Schaden aufhalten und Ihr verliert innerhalb von nur 3 Tagen insgesamt 50% all Eurer Kornvorräte! Um das Maß voll zu machen, stellt Ihr bei einer Kontrolle Eurer Goldvorräte fest, daß sich alle Goldstücke, die Ihr den Gauklern abgenommen habt, in Erde verwandelt haben.\n§($1,-1)\n§§\nIhr gebt das Gold unverzüglich an die alte Frau zurück, denn Ihr wißt um die Gefährlichkeit eines solchen Fluches. Außerdem entschuldigt Ihr Euch ziemlich wortreich bei den Gauklern. Eure Entschuldigungen scheinen allerdings nicht besonders glaubwürdig zu wirken, denn die alte Zigeunerin sagt zu Euch, daß Strafe trotzdem sein müsse. Dann dreht sie sich um und\nsteigt auf ihren Wagen, ohne\
 Euch noch eines Blickes zu würdigen. Als Ihr heimwärts reitet, grübelt Ihr lange darüber nach, was die Alte wohl mit der Strafe gemeint haben könnte. Wenige Tage nach Eurer Rückkehr wird alles klar. In Euren Kornlagern macht sich eine schreckliche Fäulnis breit. Es gibt absolut kein Gegenmittel und Euch verderben insgesamt 25% Eures gesamten Kornvorrates.\n§($1,-1)\n§§\nIhr gebt das Gold an die Alte zurück, ausserdem gebt Ihr noch 10000 Goldstücke zusätzlich dazu. Damit hofft Ihr den gefährlichen Fluch von Euch abwenden zu können. Euch ist durchaus klar, daß dieser Fluch schlimme Folgen haben könnte und Ihr hättet am liebsten noch mehr Gold bezahlt, aber Ihr hattet nicht mehr dabei. Die alte Zigeunerin nimmt das Gold und verschwindet wortlos in ihrem Wagen. Doch dann dreht sie sich noch einmal zu Euch um und sagt Euch, dass Ihr trotzdem für Euren Frevel büßen müßt.\nWährend Eurer ganzen Heimreise grübelt Ihr über dir letzten Worte der Zigeunerin nach und Ihr betet zu den Göttern, daß\
 die Strafe milde ausfallen möge. Zuhause angekommen, findet Ihr kaum Ruhe und schon einige Tage später ist klar, welche Strafe Euch die Alte zugedacht hat. In einigen Eurer Kornlager beginnt das Korn aufgrund einer seltsamen Fäulnis zu verderben. Es gibt keine Möglichkeit, diesen Vorgang aufzuhalten, aber zum Glück beschränkt sich die rätselhafte Krankheit auf einige wenige Kornlager. Ihr verliert insgesamt 10% Eures gesamten Kornvorrates.\n§($1,-1)\n§§

Ihr sitzt an der Tafel beim Wildschweinbraten und lasst es Euch schmecken. Da meldet ein Diener einen Boten an. Ihr erkundigt Euch, von wem dieser Bote geschickt wurde. 'Das will er uns nicht verraten, Herr' antwortet Euer Diener. Nun liegt es an Euch zu entscheiden:\n\n1. Seid Ihr bereit, den Boten freundlich zu empfangen und wollt ihn einladen mit Euch zu speisen? (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Wollt Ihr ihm zeigen, wer das Sagen hat in Eurem Reich und ihn noch ein Stündchen schmoren lassen? (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n\n3. Ihr haltet diesen Boten für den Spion eines Feindes und wollt kein Risiko eingehen und vielleicht sogar Gold verlieren. (Weiter mit Knopf 'III')§($3,2,6,10)\n§§\nDer Diener kommt zurück, begleitet von einem Mann, der eine Fahne bei sich trägt, die Ihr noch nie zuvor gesehen habt. Ihr fordert den Mann auf, sich zu Euch zu setzen. 'Eine zweite Silberplatte und einen Becher' ruft Ihr Eurem Mundschenk zu. Der bringt das Gewünschte.\n'Kommt her, nehmt Platz' fordert Ihr\
 Euren Gast auf, 'Speist mit mir.'\n'Ich danke euch sehr für diesen Empfang.' erwidert der Fremde. 'Mein Name ist Saruba. Ich komme aus einem fernen Land, bin zuerst über das Meer gesegelt und dann drei Tage lang geritten. Mein König schickt mich, ich soll Pflanzen suchen und mit nach Hause bringen. Für den Empfang danke ich Euch sehr' sagt der Fremde und will Euch einen prallgefüllten Lederbeutel überreichen.\n\n1. Ihr freut Euch und wollt den Beutel sofort haben. (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Ihr wollt Euch als großzügiger Gastgeber zeigen und könnt Euch noch gedulden. (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n\n3. Ihr lehnt das Geschenk ab, weil Ihr noch keine Verpflichtung eingehen wollt. (Weiter mit Knopf 'III')§($3,3,4,5)\n§§\nIhr nehmt den Beutel und schaut hinein. 50 Goldstücke glitzern Euch entgegen. Ihr bedankt Euch bei dem Boten, welcher Euch antwortet: 'Meinen König wird es freuen, dass Ihr sein Geschenk angenommen habt. Ich hoffe, ich finde die Pflanze, die ich suche, in Eurem\
 Reich.'§($1,-1)\n§§\n'Nicht so eilig!' sagt Ihr zu dem Boten. 'Lasst uns erst in Ruhe speisen. Kommt, setzt Euch doch endlich.' \nWährend des Essens erzählt Euch der Mann von der kranken Prinzessin. Seit einigen Jahren wird sie von ganz starken Kopfschmerzen gequält. Dann muss sie in einem dunklen Zimmer liegen. Sie kann kein Licht vertragen, und sobald sie sich bewegt wird ihr sehr übel. Der Bote lobt Euch als sehr großzügigen Gastgeber: 'Ich bin euch sehr dankbar für den freundlichen Empfang und dass Ihr euch für die Probleme meines Königs interessiert. Er wird sich sehr freuen, das zu hören.'\nEs klingt ganz danach, als hättet Ihr einen Verbündeten gewonnen. Nach dem Essen bietet Euch der Bote nochmals den Beutel an. Diesmal nehmt Ihr ihn an. 'Wartet einen Augenblick. Ich bin gleich wieder zurück' sagt der Fremde. Er geht hinaus zu seinem Pferd und holt noch einen Lederbeutel aus seinem Gepäck: 'Bitte, nehmt noch diesen Beutel. Mein König hat gesagt, wenn \njemand großzügig\
 handelt, soll ich ihn doppelt belohnen.' \nFür Eure Geduld habt Ihr jetzt die doppelte Goldmenge, insgesamt 100 Goldstücke, gewonnen.§($1,-1)\n§§\n'Vielen Dank, aber ich möchte Euer Geschenk nicht annehmen', sagt Ihr. Saruba schaut Euch etwas beleidigt an. 'Ganz wie Ihr wünscht', antwortet er höflich, 'Dann geht der Inhalt eben wieder zurück in die Schatzkammer des Königs.' \nIhr merkt, dass Ihr einen Fehler gemacht habt. Der Bote ist verstimmt. Ihr versucht, Euren Lapsus wieder gut zumachen und fordert Saruba nochmals zum Essen und Trinken auf. Allmählich bessert sich die Stimmung des Fremden, schließlich hat er einen Auftrag zu erfüllen. Doch Ihr habt ihn und seinen König in ihrem Stolz verletzt. Den Beutel mit den Goldstücken, den habt Ihr nun verspielt.§($1,-1)\n§§\nIhr beendet Euer Mahl in  aller Ruhe, trinkt gemächlich den ein oder anderen Becher Wein dazu. Dann erhebt Ihr Euch, begebt Euch in den Thronsaal und sagt Eurem Diener, dass er den Boten jetzt holen könne.\n'Mein Name\
 ist Saruba', begrüßt euch der Bote. Er ist höflich, aber distanziert. 'Ich bitte Euch um die Erlaubnis, Pflanzen in Eurem Reich sammeln zu dürfen. Die Tochter unseres Königs ist sehr krank und der Heiler will neue Pflanzen ausprobieren.'\n\n1. Habt Ihr Mitleid mit der unbekannten Prinzessin und gestattet dem Fremden, sich in Eurem Reich umzusehen? (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Ihr wollt den Boten nicht aus den Augen lassen und bietet ihm an, ihn zu\nbegleiten? (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n\n3. Ihr möchtet nicht, dass ein Fremder überall in Eurem Land herumgeht. Schließlich könnte er so manchem Geheimnis auf die Spur kommen. (Weiter mit Knopf 'III')§($3,7,8,9)\n§§\n'Das tut mir sehr Leid', sagt Ihr dem Fremden, 'Wenn es um die Medizin geht, habe ich ja nichts von Euch zu befürchten. Jetzt bedaure ich, dass ich Euch so lange warten ließ. Ihr habt wertvolle Zeit verloren', sagt Ihr. \n'Aber Herr, Ihr seid ein König. Da bin ich es gewohnt, zu warten.' Saruba holt einen Lederbeutel aus seinem\
 Umhang, öffnet ihn, entnimmt ihm zehn Goldstücke, die er Euch \nüberreicht: 'Bitte, das schickt Euch mein König als Dank.'\nIhr habt also zehn Goldstücke gewonnen.§($1,-1)\n§§\n'Ihr dürft euch gern in meinem Reich umsehen, aber ich möchte Euch begleiten.', Eure Stimme klingt zwar freundlich, lässt aber keinen Widerspruch zu. So laßt Ihr Euch von den Stallknechten Euer Pferd bringen.\nGemeinsam reitet Ihr los. 'Ich glaube, ich weiß, wo viele verschiedene Pflanzen wachsen', sagt der Bote und reitet auf den nahen Wald zu. \nIhr seid verwundert: 'Wie könnt Ihr das wissen? Ihr seid doch fremd hier.'\n'Oh, das ist ganz einfach. Der Heiler hat mich unterrichtet, worauf ich achten muss. Denn Flora und Fauna bilden immer eine Einheit.'\nIhr überlasst dem Fremden die Führung. Plötzlich seid Ihr in eine Gegend geraten, die Ihr selbst noch nie zuvor besucht habt.\n'Wir stehen ja vor dem Großen Berg!', ruft Ihr aus, 'Ich hatte mir schon lange vorgenommen, zu ihm hinzureiten. Nur hatte ich\
 bisher wenig Zeit, denn das Regieren ist harte Arbeit.' \nIhr steigt beide von Euren Pferden. Während der Bote nach Pflanzen, die am Fuße eines Berges wachsen sollen, Ausschau hält, wandert Ihr ein bisschen den Berg hinauf. An einem Felsen bemerkt Ihr einen goldenen Schimmer. Den wollt Ihr genauer untersuchen. Es ist wirklich Gold. Im Berg muss eine Mine sein! Ihr habt sie entdeckt.§($1,-1)\n§§\n'Wenn meine Soldaten Zeit haben, werde ich sie in die Wälder schicken. Sie sollen Euch die Pflanzen, die sie pflücken, aushändigen. Ihr könnt solange mein Gast sein', bietet Ihr dem Fremden an. Er würde zwar lieber selbst in die Wälder reiten, kann das ohne Eure Erlaubnis jedoch nicht tun. \nSaruba bleibt einige Tage auf Eurem Schloss und belohnt, als die Soldaten ihm die Pflanzen übergeben, diese mit je einem Goldstück. Bei Euch bedankt er sich mit netten Abschiedsworten.§($1,-1)\n§§\nIhr kommt in den Hof. Ihr seid dem Fremden gegenüber äußerst misstrauisch. 'Was wollt Ihr? Woher kommt\
 Ihr?', wollt Ihr von ihm wissen.\n'Mein Name ist Saruba. Ich bin auf der Suche nach einer Heilpflanze für die Tochter meines Königs.'\n\n1. Denkt Ihr, das sei eine seltsame Geschichte und dass der Fremde Böses im Schilde führt? (Weiter mit Knopf 'I')\n\n2. Hat der Fremde Euer Misstrauen zerstreut und Ihr wollt ihm helfen? (Weiter mit Knopf 'II')\n\n3. Seid Ihr gleichgültig den Sorgen anderer gegenüber und wollt den Fremden schnell wieder los werden? (Weiter mit Knopf 'III')§($3,11,12,13)\n§§\n'Ich glaube Euch nicht.',entgegnet Ihr dem Fremden, 'Wachen, nehmt diesen Mann fest und werft ihn ins Gefängnis. Nächsten Monat werde ich über ihn zu Gericht sitzen.' \nDie Wachen ergreifen den Boten und bringen ihn ins Gefängnis. 'Das werdet ihr bereuen', ruft euch der Gefangene zu.\nEine Woche später macht Ihr die leidvolle Erfahrungen, dass der Bote des anderen Königs keine leeren Drohungen ausgesprochen hatte. Da es um die Gesundheit seiner Tochter ging, sandte der König Soldaten hinter\
 Saruba her, als dieser nicht zurückkehrte. Die fremden Soldaten kamen bei Nacht, überfielen Eure Wachen, befreiten Saruba und plünderten Eure Schatzkammer.§($1,-1)\n§§\n'Also gut', sagt Ihr zu dem Fremden, 'Ihr dürft euch in meinem Reich umsehen. Bevor Ihr jedoch wieder heimreitet, kommt nochmals bei mir vorbei und zeigt vor, was Ihr gesammelt habt.'\nSaruba bedankt sich und reitet davon. Zwei Tage später meldet Euch ein Diener dessen Rückkehr.\n'Seht, Herr', ehrerbietig hält Euch der Bote des fremden Königs einen großen Beutel hin, 'Ich habe nur Pflanzen gesammelt.'\nSaruba greift unter seinen Umhang und holt einen goldenen Stein hervor. 'Doch seht, was ich noch gefunden habe.'Der goldene Stein erweist sich als ein Goldklumpen. \n'Beutet Ihr die Mine schon aus?', fragt Saruba, 'oder soll ich Euch sagen, wo Ihr sie findet?'. Ihr freut Euch über diesen Fund. 'Zeigt mir die Mine!', fordert Ihr den Boten auf. 'Nun, wenn Ihr mir die Hälfte des Goldes welches Ihr aus ihr ausbeutet\
 abgebt, dann gern.' Schweren Herzens willigt Ihr ein...§($1,-1)\n§§\n'Das tut mir sehr leid. In unserem Reich wachsen überhaupt keine Pflanzen. Ihr müsst leider unverrichteter Dinge zurückkehren.' \nSaruba durchschaut Euch natürlich, aber Ihr lasst nicht mit Euch reden. 'Gut', entgegnet der Bote, 'Mir bleibt nichts anderes übrig als umzukehren.'\nSaruba reitet davon. Heimlich kehrt er jedoch in Euer Reich zurück. Er sammelt Pflanzen und untersucht Erde und Steine. Er entdeckt dabei auch eine Goldmine, deren Fund er Euch allerdings nicht mitteilen kann...§($1,-1)\n§§

Bolts of lightning flash across the sky and briefly illuminate the little house at the city walls. A dark figure sneaks up to the building, looks around and knocks in a pattern on the old wooden door. Shortly thereafter, the door is opened and candlelight shines out of the house making the face of the man who is entering the building visible.\nInside, there are about 15 men who sit around a large table upon which plans and maps are laid out. Each man is risking his neck, for if any of the royal party finds out what they are deliberating on they will be punished severely. The newcomer, called only Arnulf by the others, tells the gathered people some news.'They just caught Nolan. He won't keep quiet long. If they begin to torture him, then he will soon squeal on us. We have to move soon, or we will miss our chance and never get one again!'\nThe others know what that means. They have\
 been planning a rebellion against the regent of the city for quite some time. The group call themselves 'The Black Fist' and their goal is to plan uprisings in several towns and take the power for themselves. They want to build their own realm with their own rules and will use any means necessary, even deadly force to achieve their goal.Every time the ruler of this realm tried to catch the 'Black Fist', they got away. The 'Black Fist' has no central leadership, each cell is autonomous.\nThe members of the 'Black Fist' are simply unable to subject themselves to central laws and order. Peace and unity are horrible to them, so they try to seed anarchy and chaos. Many of them are ex soldiers who failed to settle down during the time of peace and feel at home in this organisation.\nThey plot until late in the night and agree that they should make their move the following night. Everybody is to inform the other members known to them. The secret weapon depots are opened and everything is\
 made ready for the decisive moment.A storm is raging again the following night, a heavy rain is falling and the guards on the city walls are seeking shelter against the downpour. Ideal weather for an insurrection.\nAs the attention of the guards begin to flag shortly before dawn, the leaders strike. They scale the city walls and kill the guards then move to take on the local garrison and seize the residency. The surprised soldiers have no chance and only those who surrender at once are allowed to live.§($1,>)§§But one young guard, unseen by the rebels, manages to hide away and sneaks out of the compound using the little door next to the gate, that the leaders of the 'Black Fist' foolishly left unguarded. He knows that there is an army of their Lord not far from the town because they just left days earlier to patrol the region surrounding the city.Completely exhausted, he reaches the encampment of the army late at night. He reports what happened in the town and the commander of the\
 army orders the immediate decampment of the army which then starts their trek back to the town.\nThey come within sight of the city walls the next morning and find that no guards were posted there by the rebels. This error in judgement enables the soldiers to advance unseen up to the gate. The army is not that big, but the rebels know nothing of their arrival and so they advance up the streets. Soon thereafter, they are spotted by the rebels. War horns sound in the streets and the battle is joined by the other rebels.But now the training of the army pays off, they are able to beat back the rebels and soon take hold of the city walls and the guard house. The 'Black Fist' fight unto their last breath because they know what awaits them if they are captured alive, but they are no match against the soldiers. Only the residency remains a stronghold for the rebels. The soldiers lay siege to the residency the entire night, but they are not able to get inside. The commander gives the order to\
 burn down the building the next day and soon the flames are blazing up to the roof but none of the rebels leave the building. Despite the horrible outcome, the sympathy for the rebels is small because the 'Black Fist' were not considerate in regards to the needs of the people, having only their own interests in mind.The whole extent of the fight is visible when the first rays of the sun touch the scene. Some houses are burning and one of the important granaries has burnt to the ground. The streets are littered with dead bodies and you can spot people running around aimlessly between the buildings in the smoke.\nIn the following weeks, many of the inhabitants leave the city, some even leave the country, because there are always rumours spreading that the 'Black Fist' will strike again. Despite all efforts to catch the rebels, there are few results. Even when one cell of the rebels is caught there can be an uprising in the next city by another cell. Due to their deliberate lack of\
 central leadership the cells know virtually nothing of each other so prisoners can not and will not tell anything about their comrades and thus the threat remains intact.The faith in the leaders of the city is falling rapidly and many of the people would rather give up their normal life and leave the land to move into neighboring countries instead of living in constant fear that the 'Black Fist' will strike again.§($2,<,-1)§§\n\n

Without a strong leadership, law and order fall to anarchy. The rebels start looting and murdering in the city. They take the last riches of the inhabitants and anyone who tries to oppose them is put to the sword at once. Some people barricade themselves in their homes, but the rebels burn those buildings to the ground with the people still inside.\
 Women get raped, men have to do the dirty work of the rebels and even the children have to work long and hard.More and more inhabitants flee from the terror and violence that now rules the city. With them news of the rebellion and the atrocities reach the leader of the country. He is willing to end this rebellion by any means necessary, but the faith in the ruler drops with each passing month while the rebellion is going on. Many people leave the land in fear of further rebellions in other cities but the rebellion also means a drop in taxes. The acres of farm land surrounding the city are no longer tended, the cattle is taken for food by the rebels and the forges are used only for the members of the 'Black Fist' and not for the people themselves.It will take a long time for help to get to the city. New armies will have to be raised and will have to cross the country to get to the city. The rebels have not forgotten that they operate out of the law and will face hard punishment if they\
 are caught. While the city is still under control of the 'Black Fist' rebels from other parts of the country come to 'their' town as soon as they hear about it. The city walls are constantly staffed with guards, the city doors are reinforced and the weapons storage of the city is opened. Everything is made ready for the inescapable fight that will come against the troops of the leader of the country.\nIt will be a tough battle if we are to regain control of this city!§($2,<,-1)§§\n
BT_LUXUSGUETER (//)
                                                Luxury goods\n\nYou have ruled your realm for quite some time now and sometimes you sit at the hearth in the evening and think about things yet to come.What will the future years bring? Right now, you cannot figure out where the future will lead you.On a beautiful morning you decide to stroll over to the local market once again. The craftsmen offer their goods, some women are chatting with the greengrocer and the smith has set up shop in the market and is busy repairing tools from some farmers that have come to the city this market day.Some traders from far away realms are also here and have laden their stands with goods. You can see oil and spices, marble and jewellery and other fine goods. Your realm doesn't need much of those goods because not many people are living here and they are happy with the goods produced locally. The farmers and craftsmen don't crave for luxury goods and thus their needs are easily satisfied. As you pass the\
 various stands, you are greeted with reverence, because everybody knows that you are the regent. Most faces you recognise because normally the traders are the same that come to this market.However, at the end of the stands, you see a new face. He doesn't have much on his stand, but he has a sample of all luxury good available. The trader is an old man with a thick beard. He eyes you with interest as you near his stand. He bows as you reach him and as he notices your inquiring look, he says 'These are only samples my Lord, I don't offer goods, I offer only knowledge.''Knowledge about what?' you ask as your interest is roused.'Well, we shouldn't speak about this here on the market. Let me visit you in your residency this evening and I will submit a proposal to you.' he says in an almost conspirational whisper.Now you are really interested in what he has to offer, but he won't tell you any details on the market. So you invite him to your residency...§($1,>)§§Later that evening, the\
 trader is escorted to your private chambers. You have selected foods and a jug of excellent wine already, which is gratefully accepted. You are waiting eagerly for what the trader has to tell, but you wait until after the meal.But now you want to know more. The trader has a small wooden box with him, which he never let out of sight as if he is afraid that somebody might steal it.The trader finally begins to narrate: 'I have noticed that you looked at all the luxury goods on the market such as the jewels, the parchment, spices, incense and all the other fine goods. Your subjects surely don't have much need of these goods.But imagine how many of these goods are needed in the huge realms where there are lots of rich people who don't have to work and spend their life in idleness. The demand is high and traders who can supply these goods make huge profits.Thats why several small realms have specialized in the production of these goods. Some supply their liege lord and get treated extremely\
 good by him. Others sell their produce on the open market. Wouldn't that also be something for you?'You answer:'I could very well imagine specializing in the production of these goods, but there is a problem. My subjects are simple people and they don't have the knowledge for the manufacturing of such items.'§($2,<,>)§§A smile flits over the face of the trader. 'That's where my humble self comes in. In this little box I have a treasure that can't be measured by gold.'He slowly opens the lid of the box and some unassuming looking little books come into view. But as you see the title of the first book 'the art of weaving brocade' your ears perk up. Apparently the book tells one how to weave fine fabrics and maybe the other books offer similar information.The trader takes the books out one after the other and reads the titles aloud:'The art of weaving brocade'...very interesting lecture...and here...'manufacturing of incense'...oh, and here is another excellent work...'Gemslore'.He has\
 one book for every luxury good that you can think of with him.You ask him openly:'How much for the contents of the box?'But the trader raises his hands:'Now, now! I can't sell you the complete knowledge. For starters, you don't have enough resources for producing all of these goods and competition is good for business. If you really want to produce some luxury goods, than you have to decide which one you wish to manufacture. I am willing to part with the information of one book. For compensation, you will always sell those goods at a favorable price and I will still get a stately sum of gold now!'Well, the decision is yours now! What will you choose?§($2,<,-1)§§

                                                       The Variola\n\n(!12)Brother Bertram, where are you?\n\n(!7)The monk dressed in a common frock involuntarily winced. This voice could have awoken someone on his deathbed. He knew immediately to whom this shrill voice belonged. Sister Agatha was once again in search of him like always when she needed someone who could repair a table for her, thump a nail in the wall for a new canvas or just give her a hand in some way. Though she knew no mercy and good Bertran knew exactly that he had to lay the small shovel aside and that the work in the monastery garden had to rest for a longer while. To whom Agatha assigned a job didnt get away from her easily. In spite of everything she had a good heart and she devotionally cared for the children in the orphanage which was located beside the cloister and jointly conducted by the brothers and sisters of the cloister. All of them were followers of Varis, the god was traditionally honored by most of\
 the people in this region.\n\nBertram rose from his work at the vegetable patchand turned his steps towards the voice which became increasingly louder and shriller.\n\n(!12)Where have you been all the time? I desperately need someone who chops up some wood for the oven. The meal has to be prepared.\n\n(!7)With these kind words he received an axe in his brawny hands and Sister Agatha already pushed him in the direction of the wood to chop and the firewood.§($1,>) §§(!12)Hurry up! Hurry up!\n\n(!7)Bertram knew that he could not brook opposition so he set work on his task. He was used to hard work and additionally he regarded it as a service for Valris which made him find that no trouble. By the time he had split the first pieces of wood as if he had done it his whole life, he noticed the little girl who observed him from long distance. His looks immediately brightened. The girl was about eight years old and was already in the orphanage for half a year. She had not spoken a single word,\
 yet, though nobody could tell exactly if she actually was mute or if the experiences of the past made her being silent.\n\nShe was found beside her dead parents who conducted a small charcoal burning near the Dark Mountains. They were slain by orcs and the girl only survived luckily. They gave her the name Elisa and despite of her silence she was soon the favorite of all the cloister inhabitants.\n\nShe set the table for the orphans, she helped in the monastery patch, and she supplied the animals with food and was very pleased when one of the monks read to her from old books which were kept in the cloister. Some days later Brother Bertram tampered with the garden as he again perceived Agathas voice. He wanted to swear silently as he noticed something. Something was different than usually. Agathas voice somehow sounded frightened. §($2,<,>) §§As he walked to her she rushed towards him:\n\n(!12)Elisa.Elisa.. oh my dear God.. the poor.\n\n(!7)He wanted to put the sister at ease while he\
 ran after her because she already was on the way back to the building of the orphanage. As Agatha did not turn to the right in the hallway like usually where the rooms of the childrenwere located, Bertram suspected something grave.\n\nThe little girl Elisa lay there and had a bad temperature and the shiver got into her tiny body. As Brother Bertram laid his hands on her forehead he got scared because it seemed as though Elisas Face was burning. The little girl looked at him and tried to smile, though she already was alarmingly weak. Bertram was knowledgeable about herbology and hence, hurried to the kitchen to prepare a fever reducing brew. Though he knew exactly that she was not very well. He observed her together with some other sisters and brothers beside her bed the following days.\n\nMeanwhile more children fell ill; they also had a high temperature. Even some of the adults were affected. What disconcerted Bertram the most was a different observation, though. He, like many of the\
 other monks too and some of the orphans had the typical scars on their faces and bodies which remain after one survived the Variola. Nobody of those who wore those signs fell ill. §($3,<,>) §§It was commonly known that no one who survived the Variola got it a second time. The first indication was a high temperature and thus, Brother Bertram was seized with a terrible idea.\n\nShould they really have to deal with this terrible plague? As the blisters appeared on the little Elisa and other sufferers which were so typical for this disease and which made one be stigmatized for the rest of the life after one passed this burden, the foreboding became certainty. Brother Bertram knew that there is no cure and that they only could hope and pray.\n\nSome days later, in the evening Brother Bertram knelt in front of the small statue of Valris in the cloister chapel. He prayed for the other sufferers like he often did those days. Many of them did not feel well and Elisas situation was grave, too.\
 She barely kept her sanity.Nothing was useful against the fever; she did not want to eat anymore and she became weaker and weaker.\n\nBy the time Bertram finished his prayer he heard silent steps behind him. He rose wearily and turned around to face the person who entered the chapel. It was sister Agatha. As he noticed the tears in her eyes he understood. Varis did not hear him this time. Agatha tried to speak but just a sobbing came over her lips. The often so inapproachable appearing nun could not hold herself back. She bitterly cried and Bertram knew that words were not useful.§($4,<,>) §§Instead he embraced her and led her to the bench at the outer wall of the chapel. There they sat down and after a while Agatha calmed down eventually. Bertram rose, took Agathas hand and together they walked over to the orphanage. Elisa lay there on her sickbed. The Variola deformed her pretty face and yet it seemed to all attendees that she still was the prettiest girl in the world.\n\nThe next\
 day they carried her to her grave. Brother Bertram spoke some words about the long journey and that Elisa now was in the realm of light and would see her parents again. Varis would surely give her a special place among the deceased. As two of the monks filled the grave with ground in which they lay the dead body of the girl, Brother Bertram also could not repress the tears.§($5,<,-1)\n§§

                                               The spotted fever\n\nIt was one of those cold mornings in spring that were so typical for these latitudes. The residence of the Count of Bärenstein still lay in the mist of the morning. It was a long time since one could hear the noise of the servants and menials. By and by they all left, banished by the Count. Hartmut of Bärenstein did not always have a bad character but since his wife died he totally separated from the rest of the world. Over the years he became more and more embittered. Behind every corner he sensed intrigues of his servants. He believed the people would cheat on him with their duties and that they would prepare his fall. He ran deeper and deeper into his own delusion. It also became emptier in the residence all the time.\n\nOne by one he dismissed almost all of his servants. Just one remained. The old Alois surely had more than enough reasons to leave the old grumbler to his destiny but he swore to his father on the\
 deathbed thathewouldmaintain the tradition as servant of Bärenstein to his own death.\n\nThat is why old Alois shuffled to his bed-chamber with his almost 70 years once again this morning. He silently prepared himself for that his Lord starts cursing a black streak as he quietly opened the door to the bed-chamber.§($1,>) §§Though, he did not receive the usual insult and curses. Instead the old Count lay on his bed and wallowed uneasily from side to side. Apparently he was not well the last days that he did not mentioned with a single word of course. He would not visit a medical practitioner voluntarily because from his point of view they were all cutthroats.\n\nAlois gently stepped closer to the bed. The old Lord of Bärenstein looked horrible. His breathing sounded whistling and it seemed that he was talking nonsense. Alois became frightened. In spite of the bad treatment by his employer he yet felt obliged to him. He dithered and finally he decided to go to the city quickly to get\
 the doctor. Later that day, the doctorwasalready gone for an hour, Alois sat by the bed of the Count.\n\n He thought about this walk in the city, about the reluctance of the medic to follow him to the hated regent and about the whisper and evil looks of the people in the city. Eventually the young medic came with him and he gave a judgement about the disease. It was probable that they had to deal with the spotted fever.§($2,<,>) §§Supposably the stinginess of the Count was the reason of the illness because according to the words of the medic the spotted fever was transmitted by fleas and other animals and there were ample of these in the environment of the Count. He never permitted Alois to buy new clothes or to change the bed sheets although there were plenty of new robes and the finest clothes and sheets in the closets. \nBut the old Count simply was too stingy to use these things and he accused Alois to stash away some of his possessions at the first opportunity.\n\nAt nightfall\
 things became worse and worse for the old Count. In his fever hespoketo his departed wife then he shouted at the long-dismissed servants. On and on he was shaken by cramps.\n\nThe next morning the sands of life had run out for him. Alois sat loyal at his bed although the doctor warned him that the spotted fever also could affect him. But what was Alois supposed to do? He had nobody to go to and so he remained at his plague, loyal to the vow he gave his father. §($3,<,>) §§As the sun began to send its rays through the window of the noble bed-chamber, Alois noticed soft murmur and a babble of voices. The noise became louder and louder and he left his place beside the bed and moved over to the window eventually. Downstairs in front of the residence a huge crowd gathered. He also could recognize the doctor among the pitchforks- and spears-armed men.\n\nImmediately it came to his mind what happened. The doctor told the people that the Count had not much time left of his life and now they\
 saw their chance to rise against the old and hated Count of Bärenstein. Finally thecrowdrushed the residence. At that moment, when the first insurgents reached the great entrance hall Hartmut of Bärensteintook his last breath.\n\nThe intruders plundered the residence and finally they reached the bed-chamber of the Count. The first men to see the dead regent on his bed started to grin gloatingly. Beside him old Alois waited for his destiny with unseeing eyes. Alois knew they he had not to await something good because the common people could not understand that he remained at the Counts side and they surely held him responsible for a considerable part of their tragedy. As the night fell over the residence, flames were blazing out of the windows.§($4,<,>) §§ After the plundering the entire anger of the people unloaded. In the bed-chamber there lay the old Count and beside him old Alois. They had taken his life with a cowardly dagger thrust. Though the next weeks brought the horror into\
 the city. More and more people came down with the spotted fever. They took all out of the residence what theywereable to carry and hence, the fleas and bugs that dwelled in the fine robes and expensive damask textiles.\nMany years later one would read in the books of history that the gods punished the people for their outrage. But this was just the attempt of some regents to spread fear among their servants to avoid future riots. The people though, execrated the old Count secretly whom they held responsible for the great perishing.§($5,<,-1) §§

                                                 The Black Death\n\nHrugar entered the small stone house with a heavy heart. Since he and his family had moved to the city, they hadbeen living in this house with three other families. Living space was at a premium. Each family only had two roomsand Hrogar and his wife had 4 kids. The oldest son already had to work, so that they had enough money since Hrugar´s work at the weavery didn´t earn him enough to feed everyone.\n\nHe really thought that life in the city would be different, based on the stories he always had heard from people whomade it big in the city. But nothing went according to plan. At first, he couldn´t find any work and later only the bad paying work in the weavery as a helper for the weavers. The dream they had of a nice little house with garden remained unattainable. Right now, they were thankful that they had the two rooms in this house next to the city wall.\n\nEven though it was small and they had to leave through the\
 back door to alittlewooden shack in the back to answer nature´s call. But Hrugar believed that one day their luck would change for the better. As he opened the front door, he didn´t have the tiniest inkling, that he had only a few more days to live.\n\nAs soon as he entered the small living room, where he and Gerlind lived and slept and prepared the food, he noticed that something was different.§($1,>) §§Gerlind was nowhere to be seen, but he heard whimpering coming from the bed he shared with her.\nFull of dread, he approached the bed and was appalled to see Gerlind´s ashen face in the dim light of an oil lamp. This morning, as he went to work, she had complained about feeling weak and about aching all over, but what he saw now frightened him nevertheless, Gerlind looked horrible. She was coughing and was almost to weak to lift her head. \n\nHrugar decided to leave for the healer at once and made his way to the small house near the city center, where the healer lived. It was the only\
 healer in town, except for some womenwho sellherbs that you could go to if you felt ill. The citizen had been clamoring for a bigger institution with real sickrooms for the ill and capable doctors, but so far, they only had the healer. As Hrugar entered the house of the healer, he saw that there already were lots of people and so he joined the throng of the waiting. All around him, people were talking about their illnesses and Hrugar noticed that several of the waiting people described the same symptoms that his wife had.\n\nMany had come to take the healer to the ill who couldn´t come by themselves. Finally it was Hrugar´s turn. Healer Olwein knew him from before, since Hrugar had been injured so badly at work, that he even had to spend some days in bed. §($2,<,>) §§Olwein greeted him tiredly, but became wide awake as Hrugar told him abou this wife. Olwein asked him if he was feeling like his wife, but he wasn´t. He told Hrugar that he would look after Gerlind first thing in the\
 morning.\n\nHrugar awoke the next morning next to his belovedwife, but ithad been the last night on earth for her. He knew that death had claimed her. He stood up and covered her with the threadbare blanket and tried to find the courage to tell his kids about her demise.\n\nAt that moment it knocked on the door. Without being able to grab a clear thoguht, he opened the door and saw Olwein standing there. He turned without a word and went to the other door to wake his kids who were sleeping there. Olwein was taken aback by the absent look on Hrugar´s face. But as soon as he entered the small room and saw the bed, it all became clear to him. He wouldn´t have told Hrugar that there had not been any hope for Gerlind in the first place, because as soon as Hrugar visited him and told him of the symptoms, he knew what illness had befallen her.\n\nGerlind wasn´t the first victim and wouldn´t be the last by far. The Black Death was walking the streets. Olwein removed the blanket and then he\
 saw the telltale symptons. Black bubonic lumps covered Gerlind´s dead body.§($3,<,>)§§So it really was the Black Death, as he had seen it on many the other victims.\nBefore the week was out, Hrugar felt worse and worse and a few days later, he followed Gerlind to their final resting place. Olwein counted hundrets, no thousands of victims, before he too died of the plague. The plague wasn´t about to leave and even if it would, there was the chance of it coming back. Better medical care and hospitals could lessen the effects of the Black Death and maybe they could even conquer it one day.§($4,<,-1)§§

                                              The consumption\n\nThere was a busy doing this evening in the house of Master Legaris. The family Legaris became rich by trading goods and the house they inhabited explicitly showed that they were counted to the most important families of the city. A gorgeous construction with three floors that did not show a lack of luxury. Numerous servants urged around because it was the evening of the great ball in the local residence. All the important celebrities of the city were invited, among them of course the host, Brorin Legaris. His daughter Priska was invited, too, and her fiancé arrived for this occasion as well. Mortimus Dareis was an upcoming officer in the army and his family was also very respectable. The marriage was arranged by both families though luckily Mortimus and Priska got to like each other which especially made Mister Legaris happy. In spite of all calculations to save the influence of his family the fortune of his daughter was\
 very important to him.\n\nLady Priska was standing in her dressing room and the first Abigail helped her to dress with the gown. It was a dream of deep blue silk and because it should get cold later that evening there was a gorgeous brocade plaid ready to wear which was fitted out with a sinfully expensive pelt collar. During the dressing Lady Priska was coughing occasionally but nobody really paid attention to that. Later that evening everyone gathered in the great ball room of the residence.§($1,>) §§The oldest son of the regent arrived from the capital especially for this occasion which made the ball the most important event of the year. Mortimus and Lady Priska already had some dances. Mortimus did not miss that his fiancé had to cough multiple times and obviously felt weak. Eventually he accompanied his beloved to a comfortable armchair at the side and inquired about her condition.\nThe young lady did not want to show bareness this evening which was so much important for her\
 father and the whole family and just waved aside. Just now the musicians started to play a fast dance and Lady Priska wanted to rise to shake a leg with Mortimus once again.\n\nBy the time when she got out of her seat she suddenly felt dizzy and without making any effort to prevent it, she became unconscious.\nMortimus barely could prevent her from hardly hitting the stones. In this moment Lord Legaris looked at the couple and urged to where she collapsed. Soon they were surrounded by a large crowd of guests.\n\nLady Priska just opened her eyes but she was not in the position to stand up. Lord Brorin considered the ball completely unimportant in this moment. Hastily he ordered a carriage. Supported by him and Mortimus Lady Priska exhaustingly covered the few steps out of the ball room to the carriage. The horses paced through the nightly streets.\n\nAfter their arrival in the Lords house Lady Priska became unconscious once again. Finally the young master Mortimus forcefully grabbed\
 his bride and carried her to the bedchamber all alone. Meanwhile Lord had sent a servant to the house of master Alomin. He was a very famous medic who was called by the rich people of the city in the first place.§($2,<,>) §§ Shortly later he arrived and hastily walked to Lady Priska and began his examination. The young woman got conscious again though she was still very weak. Alomin almost finished his examinations when once again a terrible coughing fit smote her. Thereby she held a bloomy white handkerchief in front of her mouth.  By the time she removed it Alomin did not miss the blood on it. The master now perfectly knew what the reason was. The young Lady was seized with the consumption and assumingly she did not have much time left.\n\nFinally he asked Priskas father for a talk about her. In an adjoining room he revealed the terrible truth. Lord Brorin suddenly became white as chalk and the hard boiled business man was close to tears. More than a decade ago he lost his wife due\
 to a horrible disease now his only daughter did not feel well at all. He called for Mortimus because he considered that he absolutely had to know that Lady Priska only had some weeks left to live. \n\nIt was Mortimus who told his wife the bad news. Surprisingly she calmly accepted his deadly words. Some days later when she felt a little better she decided to marry Mortimus before things would become worse. Lord Borin broke out in tears when he heard the decision of his daughter but then he urgently started the preparations for the marriage. It was a wonderful  festivity and many respectable people arrived from everywhere of the country. The families Legaris and Dareis had agreed to hold the illness of Lady Priska in secret.\n\nSo it came that some of the guests noticed that the bride looked rather pale and weak though the majority considered the excitement as the reason or they speculated about her to be expecting.§($3,<,>) §§Just a few days after the marriage the young couple had\
 driven to the country estate of the family Legaris Lady Priskas condition became dramatically worse.\n\nThe hastily called master Alomin could not do anything for her and soon both families dolorously had to say goodbye to the once so vivid younglady.§($4,<,-1)§§

The longish caps are rounded at the top. Megillos is often confused with the common Lagostir, which looks the same, but has a stronger blue colour. Furthermore can you find Lagostir in lowlands, while Megillos grows in the mountains. There you can find it on the sunny south sideof a mountainside, since that area suits it the most. Megillos tend to grow in crowds, which makes it easy to get enough mushrooms once you find a spot of them. Like other mushrooms, it is only cut up, then dried in the open air and ground into a fine powder, to then be used in a ritual. With Megillos at the base of a ritual, one tries to honour the god of\
 mining.If the ritual proves to besuccessful, then youcan expect a higher production of mineral resources.§($2,<,-1) §§

It grows normally on rolling hills, while it prefers the shades on the northern sides. Characteristic for this plant are the red berries, which will grow from early spring to late autumn. Since the Angurth plant looks like the Klabusterberrybush, at least while the bush is still small and hasn´t reached it´s final height, there is one easy way totell them apart. Angurth has a big root tuber while the Klabusterbush has simple rots. The tuber of the Angurth is equally useless as are it´s berries for use in rituals. Only the leaves are used. Used in a ritual to please the God of Fecundity,the whole leaves are used and are burned with some incense in a basin. If your endeavours\
 prove successful then the realm couldtake delight in a large amount of new kids.§($2,<,-1) §§

If you happen to see a big round corm on theforest floor, then you have found the Tayanga mushroom. This corm can reach an impressive bulk. Specimen have been found that were as big as a head of a child. But beware: The corm is extremely poisonous and should only be handled with gloves. The best course of action would be to cut off the corm directly above the earth with a long knife and doesn´t touch it afterwards. Important are only the roots, which could reach up to a cubit into the earth. After one has dug out those roots, they can beprepared for ritualistic usage. They have to be washed, then cut into little pieces and later\
 dried. Mixed with a bit of brimstone, it isthen burned in a ritual to please the God of War and the armies of the realm will have the power of berserks in the next battle. §($2,<,-1) §§

Supposedly it is because the plants are much-lauded by quacksalvers and charlatans to be a true cure for multiple afflictions. The actual effect of the Kelventari plant in the field of medicine is still highly controversial among the masters of the subject. The ritual use however certainly gives considerable advantages. To find Kalventari plants one should always be geared to water. Interestingly, the Kelventari makes no difference between salt and fresh water of the many rivers and lakes which draw through Tamar.The main thing is that there is water nearby at all. Then the plant can be found easily because the dense nest of thick succulent\
 leaves of luscious green color isrelatively easyto spot.   But then it is necessary to dig out the roots which form thick long corms that are often split directly at the nodality and occasionally reaches one armlength into the ground. For the use during a ritual the roots are used fresh or dried. Cut into small chunks and mixed with plenty of oilthe success of the ritual should be guaranteed. Afterwards the god of war will be gracious-tempered and it can amount to a considerable cure of the armies of your empire.§($2,<,-1) §§

Only the locating turns out to be difficult. The Olvar mushroom with its big flat caps luxuriates in almost every area and this is the problem while looking for it. There are simply no favorite places for this mushroom. First you find it in the middle of a meadow hidden in the long grass. Then luxuriates it almost unnoticeable because of its brown color and the base of a solitary tree, or it is hiding in the shadow of a big foundling.That is why only patience and ready eyes are helpful. The skillful collector is well advised to memorize the location once one has found it. Because although one had harvested\
 them there are still good odds to locate more mushrooms nearby. Like all sorts of mushrooms listed in this work, you need the well tried method of thick-featured chunks, air drying and following pulverization for the use while the invocation of the god of fertility. If the ritual is conducted correctly one can expect a considerable surplus for the next harvest.§($2,<,-1) §§

It needs the moist and dark habitat under the dense treetops to prosper. Its inconsiderable stems are populated with little blue blooms all over the summer. Thereby these stems grow from a bunch of small leaves. The whole plant is rather inconsiderable and hence, hard to locate on the forest ground. When one has found it most of the work is already done. Though the tapered slim root is the most important part of the Breldiar herb, you dont have to dig unlike other root plants. Mostly it is sufficient to just pull it out at one fell swoop combined with a little twisting to get the plant completely out of the ground. Then the roots which are very solid will be\
 roasted on open flame and then pulverized.Forthe ritual use they will be burned together with frankincense in a bowl. The resulting haze indeed has a horrible scent but it can thereby make the god of agriculture happy. The result is a slight increase yield of herbal resources in the country.§($2,<,-1) §§

However it is much easier to locate as the little Breldiar herb. Though it can rarely be found and mostly just a few plants at one spot but its high growth makes it relatively well visible. Thereby a single long stem rises from a bed of leaves sometimes up to height of a man and it rarely splits once or twice. At the end of the stems are big brown seed cases. While the blooms of the Bukandas can be seen for just a short period of time the seed cases remain on the plant almost for the entire year.The seed cases will carefully be stripped off the stem. Thus one can find it again the next year and harvest the seed once again. These\
 seeds will be mixed with some hackled resinwithout any additional preparation and will be scattered on the ground in a wide circle during the invocation of the god. After one successfully finished the ceremony the god of fertility will arrange ample blessing with children in your empire. §($2,<,-1) §§

Unfortunately it is increasingly harder to find. While it covered entire meadows in the past it became rarer in the last time. The reason for this is still not known by most of the masters of herbology. Nowadays one can find Gefnul grass only in impassable swamps, though the more is the pleasure when one finally found one of the characteristic hassocks on the long and exhausting search and spot the remarkable purple blooms. Fortunately it is sufficient to cut off the major part of the hassock right above the ground with the sickle. If one pays attention not to injure the bloom carrying stems you can be quite sure to spot the grass at the same place the\
 next year. The hassock will be boiled inwater to a stock after adding of pure alcohol which will be poured around the fireplace during the ritual to honor the god of war. If the ritual succeeds the armies of the empire will be considerably healed. §($2,<,-1) §§

Mostly the small unimposing bunch of green culms will be spilled by numerous sandstorms which rampage through the deserts so often.In almost the same manner though, it is the best time to look for the Gylvir after a sandstorm because then the bunches often become visible which were covered with sand before. Surprisingly the green culms still look fresh and green after they have been covered with sand for weeks. The secret is the far into the ground ranging roots. They consist of a whole row of corms with many side branches which lie one below the other. It is no easy work to dig out the root entirely but it is worth the effort. On the other hand\
 some of the skillful collectors let parts ofthe root remain in the deep sand to hope that a new plant grows from that. This hope is not quite unfounded and some people have already dug out the Glyvir root at the same place over years. You cut the root corm into thin slices and let them dry afterwards. During the accordant ritual these thin slices will be dug in the ground at the place of ceremony together with goldenrod powder. Thereby the god of fertility will be made merciful and the yield of herbal resources will considerably increase in the next time.§($2,<,-1) §§

Thereby it is hard to recognize because its brown branches only grow flatly above the ground. Often the branches are quite widely ramified and one single plant can cover an area of some step lengths to the second. Mostly wild meadows are overgrown with grass so densely that even the well trained eye has considerable difficulties to locate the Jegga. The branches only have some leaves und they carry blue plum-sized fruits from early summer on. These fruits will be thoroughly dried for the ritual use. For the actual use they will be set up with some pure alcohol. Thereby the used jars, which preferably consist of ceramic, have to be kept cool.\
 The resulting extraction will bepouredcautiously into a bright fire during the ritual where upon it burns with a greenish flame. Thereby one should act with considerable caution because the slightest in attention can lead to terrible burns.Once one conducted the ceremony correctly the god of fertility will be well-disposed towards you and your empire and a true wave of births will occur in your country. §($2,<,-1) §§
