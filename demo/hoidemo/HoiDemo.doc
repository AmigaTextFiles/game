Features of Hoi, Lets Play.

A unique sound track for each level of the five levels of
HOI.

Up to 256 colors on the screen at the same time.

Challenging puzzles to solve and obstacles to overcome.

To play the demo:
The joystick controls the direction in which Hoi travels.
In this level Hoi must activate elevators and throw switches.

Have Hoi stand on the elevator and press the fire button to
activate it. Have Hoi stand in front of a switch and press
the fire button. Be careful, throwing the switch can start
machinery into motion that is dangerous to Hoi.

There are yellow rectangles with black diagonal stripes
located through out this level. These squares are
resurrection points, when Hoi crosses one he turns 
red for a few seconds. Make sure that you walk across these
squares.
