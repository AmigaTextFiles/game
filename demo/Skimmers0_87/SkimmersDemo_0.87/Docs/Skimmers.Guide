 Skimmers has been designed to work on AGA Amigas. This means that OCS/ECS
 machines will be unable to run Skimmers.
 
 In Short, this is what Skimmers needs:
 
               - AGA Chipset
               - Hard Drive
               - 2MB Chip Ram
               - 2MB Fast Ram (Well, maybe 1MB)
               - Setpatch running

 Read the 'ReadMeNow.txt' for more info on bugs and other requirements.

 No need to! All you have to do is extract all the files from the
 Skimmers.lha and copy the Skimmers drawer over to your desired destination.
 
 NOTE: Click on the 'Setup' option once you have extracted all the files.
 This determines the path of Skimmers, and can then be used in the reboot
 option.

@endnode

@node "setup" "Setting Up"

   You may change your key configuration and your control method. This is
 done through the 'Options' menu. You can set up most keys. Press return
 when the key you want to show is displayed. Then press the new key you
 want defined.
   Two player options have no effect on the game, as two player is not
 included!
   Only two music modules are included in this demo version. Sound effects
 are not yet available, either. You really should buy the full game.

                                 @{i}- Storyline -@{ui}

  The year - 2630 AD. Civilisation as we know it has been downtrodden by
 wars and violent outbursts of cosmic storms. The Earth has been destroyed
 as a result of man's neglegance. The few hundred that have escaped have
 formed small colonies on whatever they could find floating around in the
 infinite void that is space.

  On a small red planet - Kinesus IV, dwell four violent gangs of boy
 racers that want to fight for territory on their small planet. You must
 step into the shoes of the leader of one of these four gangs, and become
 the ruler of the planet by conquering the other gangs.

  The planet is represented by a map of 7 by 7 squares. These squares are
 the territories which you need to take to become ther ruler of the
 planet. The racers have decided to keep their passtime alive and thus to
 take a territory, the gangs must race against any other gangs that wish
 to try to stop them. All gangs get the chance to decide whether or not to
 join a battle. If one of the challenging gangs win, the territory is not
 taken. If the attacking gang wins, they get the territory.

  But in these days of all-out war, the racers are no longer satisfied by
 winning a race. A race is won by the gang with the most Blood Points in
 their blood bank. Blood Points are awarded for each lap completed and
 also for damaging opponent's Skimmers. If you strike the final blow on an
 oppenent's Skimmer, many points are awarded.

 NOTE: In this demo version, you may only use on of the gangs. This is the
       Green gang, which start in the top left of the map, in the desert
       zone.
 NOTE: Gangs will have names in the full game.
 NOTE: Storyline is prone to changes.

@endnode

@node "aim" "Aim of the game"

                                    @{i}- Aim -@{ui}

 The objective of the game is to become ruler of Kinesus IV by conquering
 all the other gangs.
 
 The whole objective of a battle is to race around the course and kill the
 opponents. depending on the amount of laps and kills you do, you will
 receive blood points which will determine the outcome of the combat.
 
 NOTE: Because this is only a demo version, you are only able to play
       one race track in each zone.
 NOTE: Only one (or two if the GFX are done before the release) of the
       Skimmers are available in this demo. Your gang's skimmer is
       different from the others.

  O N E  P L A Y E R
  ------------------

   MAP MODE

   On first starting a game, you will be presented with a top-down map 
 of Kinesus IV. This is where all the tactical parts of Skimmers are played
 On your first go, you will be displayed a requester telling you your gang's
 name, colour and starting position. The starting position is the coloured
 square of the map corresponding to your gang's colour.
   The idea is to take new territories on the map. You may move to a new
 territory by clicking on a square of the map. You may only move to a new
 territory if it is adjoining one of your already acquired territories.
 The pointer will cange into an arrow if you can move to a new territory.
 Click the left mouse button to confirm your move.
   After moving to a new territory, the three computer-controlled gangs
 will each have the choice in challenging you in taking the new territory.
 If you are challenged, you are told by means of a requester. If you are
 not challenged, you get the territory and play passes to the next player
 in a clockwise direction.
   If you are challenged to a territory, you will be taken straight to
 an arena for battle. The challenging gangs will be on the track with you.
 Depending on who challenged, you may only be up against one other Skimmer.
 But then again, you may be put up against all of the other three gangs.
 Not nice.
   After the race, the winner will be shown on screen. If you won, the new
 territory is yours, otherwise play continues.
 NOTE: If a challenger wins a battle, they DO NOT obtain the new territory.
      Challenging is merely a way of stopping other gangs from ruining
      your plans. If a gang challenges, there is less of a chance that the
      challenged gang will win.
   When a computer-controlled gang makes a move, you will be given the 
 same chance to challenge them, if you see the taking of the flashing 
 territory a threat to your own plans.
   If you challenge, you will be whisked away to the game mode, where a 
 battle will be played. If you or another challenging gang wins, they will
 take the territory. If the challenged gang wins, they will get their new
 territory.
     The game will end when either:
     a) All of your territories have been captured - i.e. you can't move.
     b) You take all the other gang's territories. You have won.

   GAME MODE

   After the three lights have come on and the countdown is finished,
 the game is all to play for. The timer is set to two minutes, a perfect
 length for a battle, and the battle is started.

   The panel at the bottom of your screen shows (from left to right):
   * Your energy (green-red bar).
     * Number of rockets on your Skimmer.
   * The timer.
     * Amount of machine-gun ammo left on your Skimmer.
     * The four blood banks. These are indications of points held by the
       individual gangs, with their points shown as an ascending red bar.

   To win a game, you need to amass blood points. Points are awarded as
 follows:
   * A point for every 10 hits on an enemy Skimmer.
     * 5 points on completion of a lap.
     * 10 points for taking the last shot on a Skimmer, bringing it down.
     * A point for every 5 points of energy left at the end of the battle.

   You lose energy in the following ways:
     * -3 points for hitting a wall.
     * -2 points for collision with another Skimmer.
     * -1 points for every 10 hits from a machine gun sustained.

   Use the defined contol keys to move your skimmer and fire. The default
 settings are as follows, but we recommend you find a comfortable setting
 which you are happy with:

     Forward:  Cursor up.
     Reverse:  Cursor down.
     
     Rotate anti-clockwise:  Left cursor.
     Rotate clockwise:  Right cursor.

     Fire machine gun:  Right Shift.
     Fire rocket:  Right Amiga.
     Fire guided missile:  Right Alt.

     Other controls are:

     Camera follows next Skimmer:  +
     Camera follows last Skimmer:  -
     Pause game:  Help
     Continue game:  Del
     Quit battle:  Esc               NB: you atomatically lose the battle

     Each battle is played for 2 minutes. You should aim to shoot down the 
 enemy skimmers, whilst avoiding the walls. It is important that you should
 complete laps, as this will keep you up with the other gangs' blood points.
   At the end of these two minutes, bonus points will be added based upon
 the amount of energy that each gang has left. Play will then return to the
 map, and you will be informed whether the challenger managed to take the
 territory.
   It may take a while to get used to the control system, and handling 
 the collisions and speed used by the game. It is extremely rewarding to
 keep practicing at the driving side of things, as if you start to crash 
 into walls, there'll be less to add on at the end of the battle.
   If you concentrate on the driving, and take shots only when they are
 easily available (like you're right behind the enemy) it will make it easier
 for you to score points. Later on, you'll become better at driving the 
 crafts, and you'll be able to pull off all sorts of crafty shots on other
 Skimmers. Practice will reward you with constant wins.
