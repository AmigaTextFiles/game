	NOBOCHI - THE BIG 'EAD WITH A MISSION: DEMO - ReadMe
	----------------------------------------------------


First  of all, thank you very much for purchasing the demo of NOBOCHI - THE
BIG  'EAD  WITH  A  MISSION.   It  was  created  using the REALITY Software
Construction  Kit.  Below  are the instructions on how to load and play the
game.

				INSTRUCTIONS
				------------

1. To load the game, insert NOBOCHI into the internal disk drive (DF0). The
game will then boot up.  Alternatively, the game can be run from Workbench.
To  do this, load up a copy of Workbench and insert NOBOCHI into any drive.
You  must  then open the NOBOCHI window, and click on the file named INTRO.
The  game  will  then boot up.  Be warned though, you cannot exit back into
Workbench, so make sure that there are no other programs running.

2. To install onto Hard  Disk,  you  must use a copy of Workbench.  Load up
Workbench, and insert NOBOCHI into any drive.  Simply drag the NOBOCHI disk
into  the  destination  where  you  wish to install it, and it will install
itself!   The  game  should take up roughly under 1 meg of Hard Disk space.
To run the game from Hard Disk, first open the NOBOCHI window, click on the
file  named  INTRO.  Be warned though, you cannot exit back into Workbench,
so make sure that there are no other programs running.


3. Here is a list of controls for the game:

	Fire Button = Shoot
	Space Bar = Enter Shop
	P = Pause
	Esc = Game Over/Restart

4. The aim of the game is to guide NOBOCHI MING on  a mission to defeat his
evil twisted brother, NING MING.  Once NING has been defeated, the universe
will  once  again  regain  sanity  and  destroy  the evil which has plagued
society's  current  way  of  life.   To play the game, you must shoot every
single enemy on screen.  You can then collect the coins which fall from the
destroyed  enemies  (except the bosses).  These coins can then be exchanged
for extra weapons and accessories in the shop.
