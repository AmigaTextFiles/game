@node install "Installation"

@{b}@{u}Installing Gloom 3 - Zombie Edition@{uu}@{ub}

Since this game is a CD only title it obviously means you need a CD-ROM drive
and a Harddrive. The CD drive doesn't have to be a highspeed one for the game
to function properly although for the Introduction to work smoothly a fast CD
drive would be nice. To install simplyboot workbench and click on the
Installer Icon in the Gloom3 CD Directory. This will then askyou for a pathway
in which it can make Gloom 3  save games and the configurations files. You
will only need about 5k of room on your HD so it doesn't really matter where
you select as long as there is 5k free, make sure that the path you give is a
safe directory because if these files are deleted Gloom will not work and you
may have to re-install. Once it has done this it will then ask you if it can
add an assign to your User-Startup sequence so that Gloom 3 knows where the
config and savegame files are. You must select yes here or Gloom will not
work!

Once installed you need never install Gloom again just boot your Workbench
with the CD in the drive and then click on the 'Gloom_3' icon in the Gloom
directory on the CD and play...

@node req "System Requirements"
@{b}@{u}Gloom 3 requirements @{uu}@{ub}

Gloom 3 - Zombie Edition (Ze) should work on any 020 Amiga with 2 Meg RAM. This
means that it will work on any A1200 or A4000 machines and any A500/A600 machines
with 2Meg RAM or more and a 68020 processor or better. These however are the
minimum requirements and to play Gloom faster or full screen or at large pixel
sizes you will need a better Amiga than mentioned above. The game is fully
configurable to adjust to the speed of your Amiga. For instance you can make
the screen any size and the pixels can be 1*1 (best), 2*2 or 4*4 (worst).
It is also possible to switch off the floor and ceiling. This means that on
a good Amiga (030+) you can play full screen, 1*1 with full floor and ceiling,
and on a worse Amiga (020) you can play small screen, 4*4 with no roof or
ceiling. Some players decide to make everything good quality and then play
in a smaller screen, after a while you forget its not full screen and the
game is good quality and fast!

@node story "The story so far......"

@{b}It@{ub} has only been three weeks since you returned from your previous
mission, ostensibly gaining information to pass onto the Council of the New
World Order.  The reality would live with you for years to come being
re-ignited each night in your dreams, but you had a feeling that once the
Council had received your report they would suddenly decide that there were
missions for one who had survived the obsessive cultists and their servants.

  Ordinarily there was a break of about six months between each mission,
time to recover and recuperate but now you find yourself standing outside the
same door that you stood in front of just a few weeks ago, you hope the
circumstances of your subsequent mission will be considerably less
dangerous...though secretly you know that they won't be.

Once inside, you see the seven old men dressed in grey and hidden in the
cavernous expanses of their own dark thrones, one presses a single button
and the spotlight falls onto you and they begin speaking. 

"We are pleased that you successfully completed your mission" one remarked.
"As was I" you reply

"It is...unfortunate that we must recall you to our service so quickly, but
a problem has appeared and it must be solved with the utmost alacrity and we
know of only one man who can act with such celerity...you." 

the sentence ended and there was complete silence, then a different man
spoke from just to your right hand side.

"Do you accept?"

The question is irrelevant as it would mean certain death if you did refuse,
so you choose life, this time at least.

"Yes, I accept.  What is the mission?"

"As you are no doubt aware we have several planets in the Beta Quadrant set
aside for  military testing and research on weapons, chemicals and the like."

"Indeed" you reply interested suddenly despite yourself, there are many
rumours about the Beta Quadrant and few facts.

"You must go to the planet Splinn and investigate a situation that has
developed there"

"A situation?"

"A number of subjects at the plant were accidentally exposed to a form of
biological  anti-personnel weapon that we were developing to aid our efforts
against our enemies on the outer ring of the empire.  This biological substance
causes a process of transformation over time resulting in the death and
subsequent reanimation of mammalian tissue.  In short it kills, as it
was supposed to, but then restores the dead to life...after a fashion.

These creatures crave living human flesh and many of them lose the ability
to recall any of their human skills within days of their death.  Initially
this would not have been a problem, the security forces on the planet
captured them and the scientists began their experiments anew on
these zombified corpses."

"So why do you need me?" you interrupt with growing trepidation.

"We believe that the enemy from the outer planets some how sabotaged the
containment fields and compromised the security measures, exposing all in
the base to the biological agent.

It is your mission to enter the base, eliminate all non human life forms
that you encounter and secure all 50 decks, once this has been accomplished
you must leave a tactical thermo-nuclear device in the deepest level where the
reactors are located and then after you are aboard a ship detonate the device
from orbit.  This will make sure that there is no chance of the infection
moving to colonies in nearby systems.

We will see you in one week after the completion of your mission, good luck."

With that the light shuts off and the door opens behind you, you never
saw their faces and so you don't know if they think you will return but
you vow you will.....

@{b}@{u}The Game@{uu}@{ub}

With your trusty plasma cannon you or you and a friend must battle your way
through 7 huge stages each containing 7 levels packed full of hordes flesh
eating zombies. Each level has an exit which you must get to in order to
proceed to the next. If you can get to the exit without killing all the
zombies then good luck to you, but most of the time you will only make it to
the exit by blasting the undead to pieces! Throughout the game various gun
and health powerups are there for your collection and of course other
powerups which will assist you in your mission.
You are granted 3 lives with which to complete Gloom with, if you lose these
lives then you are dead and you must start from the beginning of the stage
reached.

@node setup "Configuration"

@{b}@{u}Setup@{uu}@{ub}

To set Gloom up for your particular setup you must click on the '@{b}Setup@{ub}'
icon before playing Gloom. Here is a list of options and what they mean :-

'@{b}How to play?@{ub}' - This decides how Gloom will be played on your Amiga,
select one of the following :-

@{b}Gloom 3 Ze Dc@{ub}  -  Don't attempt this mode as it will crash your
Amiga, this may be updated via a patch from the Official Gloom 3 website soon!
(The URL is at the end of the manual)

@{b}Gloom 3 - Ze@{ub} -  This is the option most users should select.
It will let you run Gloom 3 Ze at a fast, colourful resolution and at
full screen too! Unless you have a Graphics card then this is the best option
for you!

@{b}Gloom 3 on Screen@{ub}  -  This lets you decide what screenmode you would
like to play Gloom in. This mode is slow and useless without a graphics card
or very fast Amiga! Click on it and then the 'select screenmode' button is
unghosted. Now click on this and select what screen mode you would like.
The screen modes are only limited by what monitors you have in your
devs/dosdrivers drawer. This means it should play ok on VGA and SVGA monitors
if you have them setup. This option will also leave the OS running to
a degree.


@{b}Gloom 3 in window@{ub}  -  Providing you have your WB in 256 colours
and enough free Chip ram (Graphics cards on stand-by) this option allows
you to play Gloom in a window. Although don't be disappointed because
it has been known not to work on even A4000's with 2 meg Gfx cards.

@{b}Gloom 3 - iGlasses!@{ub}  -  If you are partially insane and purchased
the iGlasses for huge wads of cash then this mode is for you!
This allows you to play 3d Gloom in all its glory. Clicking on this option
will unghost the 'Enable tracking?' button. Clicking on this button enables
head tracking meaning that you can look in one direction and fire in another!

'@{b}Other Settings@{ub}' - This strangely allows you to setup other things
about Gloom 3, the options are as follows :-

@{b}Select Modem Type@{ub}  -  This lets you select the make and speed of
your modem for playing against another player via a direct link. Find your
modem and select 'ok'. For players whose modem isn't there I suggest using
the Hayes or Generic modems. The Hayes Optima 14.4 seems to work fine on
all Hayes compatible modems.

@{b}Select Screenmode@{ub}  -  This option is only available if you are
playing 'Gloom on Screen'. If you are doing this then I suggest you look
at the '@{b}Gloom on Screen@{ub}' options above.

@{b}Select CPU present@{ub}  - This option is essential if you have a processor
other than the standard 68020 which comes in the A1200. Select the name of your
processor and the correct c2p routine will be used to take advantage of your
CPU. There are options for 020/030/040/060/ and Akiko. If there are more than
one then you can try both and see which one performs the best on your system.
The Akiko c2p routine requires an Akiko chip, like the one inside a CD32.

IMPORTANT:  The routine 'Default-Ze_1' is marginally slower than the rest but
is designed to work on all Amiga's. If you experience any strange crashes during
the game then I suggest you use this routine instead of the one optimised fo
r your CPU. If in doubt use this c2p routine.

@{b}Close WB@{ub}  -  This option will close Workbench whilst playing Gloom.
Anyone without a Graphics card should select this option because
otherwise Gloom may not have the Chip Ram it requires.

@{b}Enable Tracking@{ub}  -  To do this you need the iGlasses. If you have
these then I suggest you look at the 'Gloom 3 - iGlasses' option above.

There! Those are the options available and the little window below will give
you details of each option as you select it. To save these options
click '@{b}Thats Good@{ub}', or to cancel them click '@{b}Forget It!!@{ub}'.

menu. Here are the options you will be presented with :-

@{b}One Player game@{ub} - Begin a one player game of Gloom 3

@{b}Two Player Game@{ub} - Begin a two player game of Gloom 3.
This option allows the players to play together and share lives, they
cannot hurt each other.

@{b}Two Player Combat@{ub} - Begin a two player combat game of
Gloom 3. This option puts you and the second player in a random arena with
a handful of weapons and a few hungry zombies. The aim is to kill the other
player before they kill you!

@{b}Player 1 @{ub}- This changes the control method for player one.

@{b}Player 2@{ub} - This changes the control method for player two.

@{b}Remote Link Options@{ub} - This allows you to play Gloom 3 with
a friend and another Amiga, also see '@{b}Gloom for two@{ub}'.

@{b}Blood Options!@{ub} - Lets you select whether or not the pieces
of blasted off zombie stay on the floor or not! '@{b}Nasty@{ub}' mode will make
the disembodied parts of the zombies disappear once they hit the ground,
whereas '@{b}Dirty@{ub}' mode will cause the bits to bounce off the walls and
remain on the floor. (Dirty mode might slow things down a bit) @{b}About
@{ub}- brings up a screen of Gloom 3 Ze credits @{b}Back To WB@{ub} - Will
quit Gloom and return you to Workbench (Useless on normal CD32).


@{b}The Ingame menu@{ub}

Whilst playing Gloom pressing the 'ESC' key, or the CD32 'Play/Pause' button
will pause the game and bring up the ingame menu. These options allow you to
customise various aspects of the display - useful for those with slower
(standard) Amigas, as many if these options affect how smoothly Gloom runs.

@{b}Continue@{ub} - Returns you to the game

@{b}Pixel Width@{ub} - Changes the width of the pixels, the wider they
are the worse they look and the faster they are.

@{b}Pixel Height@{ub} - Changes the height of the pixels, the higher
they are the worse they look and the faster they are.

@{b}Window size@{ub} - Increases the size of the window to play Gloom 3 in.

@{b}Full Screen Window@{ub} - Wow!! This option makes Gloom 3 full
screen! On slow Amiga's its unplayable at this size but on 040/060 this will
really enhance your Gloom 3 experience!

@{b}Floor@{ub} - This will disable the floor graphics to increase the
speed of Gloom 3.

@{b}Ceiling@{ub} - This will disable the ceiling graphics to increase
the speed of Gloom 3.
@{b}Quit Game@{ub} - Strangely this option quits Gloom 3 and returns
you to the title page.

@node gun "About that gun...."

@{b}@{u}Your Plasma Gun@{uu}@{ub}

This trusty old gun can be boosted beyond belief. It is capable of five degree's
of fire power, and can be boosted by collecting weapon powerups.

@{b}Fire Ball (Red)@{ub} - Feeble weak blaster upgrade which will require many
hits to kill even the weakest of zombies because their moist, decaying bodies
are quite resistant to flames. It is small and has a very little surface area. 

@{b}Laser Ball (Green)@{ub} - Average upgrade which will inflict large amounts
of damage to most zombies. It has good surface area meaning it will rip through
limbs of zombies quite well.

@{b}Super Laser Ball (Bright Green)@{ub} - Larger more powerful version of the
laser Ball upgrade. This weapon can kill some zombies in one hit and its surface
area means it will rip the zombies to shreds with very few blasts.

@{b}Lighting Bolt (Blue)@{ub} - This electrified ball of power will send a
large voltage rocketing through the zombies body usually causing them to jolt
backwards. Its huge surface area and high power mean that it can destroy even
tough zombies within a few blasts.

@{b}Super Lightning Bolt (Bright Blue)@{ub} - This huge, steaming ball of power
tears its way through zombies as if they were tissue paper! Its massive amount
of current and gigantic surface area means that it can wipe out entire rooms
full of zombies in seconds! It is designed to transmit electricity through the
remaining bodily fluids of the zombie so its impact is spread out over the
entire body.

Collecting a weapon powerup of the same type as you are using will increase
the firing rate of your Plasma gun. Once the maximum firing rate is reached
then the Plasma Guns special Buffer cartridge will store the extra power and
release it as double strength blasts and even double or triple shots
simultaneously.
Once the buffer cartridge is full you will reach 'Ultra Power' level and be
capable of mass destruction not unlike that of typical Earth Atomic
Weapons! Luckily this power is focused on the enemy and if you try firing at
anything else the blasts will quickly disintegrate so as not to kill the user.

You are also equipped with a special suit of armour with built in gas mask and
blood purifier. The reason for this is that the entire complex is filled with
a lethal gas which will transform a human into a zombie in seconds. The
blood purifier keeps your blood clean because if the zombies do manage to
get through your tough armour and graze your skin you will be infected.
This infection, if left untreated would almost definitely turn you into
a zombie within a few hours.

@node 2ply "GLOOM3 with a friend"

@{b}@{u}Gloom for two!@{uu}@{ub}

It is possible to play Gloom 3 with a friend over a NULL modem cable or over
the modem - just setup your modem in the 'SetUp' utility and then select
'remote link options' from the Game menu. Player controls should be setup
before this, as only the 'host' of the linkup game will have control of the
game options once both Amigas have linked. Also, both Amigas must have
the Gloom title up before attempting to link-up.

To start a NULL modem game, both players should select 'NULL link' from
the 'remote link option' menu.

To start a modem game, one player should select 'dial up', while the other
should select 'answer'.

@node zombies " The zombies lurking within"

Here is a brief description of some of the zombies you are likely to meet
in your quest for glory.

@{b}Citizen Zombie@{ub}

You will meet these zombies in the early stages of the game, they were
previously citizens of the planet splinn who lived peacefully in the village
of Cramlington unaware of the hideous testing which was taking place 50 miles
beneath them in the Beta Quadrant Science labs B. One day they were acidently
exposed to a form of biological anti-personnel weapon which takes the form of
a green gas . This gas seeped through the paved streets of Cramlington and
quickly contaminated the entire populous because it was breathed in and allowed
to enter the blood stream. The scientists who allowed this huge blunder to
happen decided to cover up their mistake by rounding the zombies up and storing
them in the underground storage units. They then planned to blow up the village
of Cramlington in a 'freak accident' which was unfortunately unstoppable.
However when the enemy from the outer planets sabotaged the containment fields
these living dead were freed from their storage fields and now roam the storage
units searching for warm human flesh. They are very persistent and hard to
kill but luckily had never wielded weapons in their previous life so have no
skills with such things. Instead they will give in to their primitive instincts
and use their teeth and hands to rip bite size chunks form your body.

@{b}Floating X zombie@{ub}

Amongst the thousands of citizen zombies rounded up from Cramlington many of these
strange floating disembodied head zombies were discovered. The scientists had no
evidence for why this horrific transformation had occurred and what they
previously were, so they named them 'species X' because they didn't know what
else to call them. Some scientists carried out individual tests on the X zombies
and found that they were more intelligent than the other types and possessed a
self taught skill which enabled them to 'suck' their victims towards them using
a green substance which is presumed to be their blood with excessive amounts
of haemoglobin. This zombie is very hard to kill purely because of its tough
skin and high intelligence.

@{b}Zombie Spirit@{ub}

This twisted soul was brought back from the dead from the Cramlington graveyard
when the green gas resurrected the soul of every person in the vast burial site.
He possesses an unexplained ability which enables him to throw poisonous balls
of gas. His ghostly state means that he can travel through physical objects.
Do not be taken in by his cries for help because although in his mind he is
good, the zombie instinct which he possesses will not rest until you are dead.

@{b}Zombie Scientist@{ub}

The zombie scientist is a tough foe, his anger and aggression make him difficult
to kill or run from. These strong emotions were caused by the immense fear that
he will become the next guinea pig for the disgusting tests which all curious
scientists think of. The scientist is still dressed in his lab clothes and has
a craving for brains rather than human flesh. His arrival is heralded by an
unearthly cry of 'Brains!!'. These scientists still retain some of their vast
knowledge and therefore still have the sense to hide and wait for you to walk
past, this means that the scientists is a very tricky zombie which you should
beware!

@{b}Zombie Guard@{ub}

These horrific creatures used to be hired to protect the entire complex from
unwanted visitors. Because of this the zombie guards can be found quite often
anywhere within the 50 decks. Their knowledge of using guns is still intact and
therefore they can shoot you from a long distance using their flame thrower.
Although flames do not have a large effect on zombies they do on you! The zombie
guards have light blue, metal armour which surprisingly does very little
to protect them. The reason for this is that the metal armour has not allowed
their putrid flesh to 'breath' and has instead increased the rate of decay. 

@{b}Punk Zombie@{ub}

These zombies can be found in the underground tunnels. The reason for this is
that  they used to hang around here before they became zombies, they used the
tunnels which link the labs together as a hideout for their illegal activities.
Their drug taking and graffiti was known about by the guards who frequently
patrolled the tunnels looking for them. Although the labyrinth of tunnels
provided vast caverns for them to hide in. Once the chemical was leaked and
got into the ventilation system these tunnels were flooded with the gas which
promptly turned all the punks into the living dead. These punks are tough and
quite resistant to ordinary guns, although a few blasts from a Laser Ball
should be enough to rip through their tough skin. Their hyper activity is still
present from their 'rebel punk' days so watch out for them sneaking up on you
and grabbing you.

@{b}Mutant Guard Zombie@{ub}

This horrific creature of death was formed when an ordinary zombie guard walked
into one of the X-Ray chambers. The X-rays combined with the gas to produce
unexplainable effect on the undead and had the result of creating a much larger
and tougher zombie. This zombie is very slow and dense due to the fact that he
was exposed to uncontrolled amounts of X-Rays aswell as the green gas which has
the ability to kill and then revive humans! Various limbs were weakened and
blasted off in the transformation although somehow this creature can now fire
bolts of energy and withstand huge amounts of fire power. His twisted cries of
anguish and pain can be heard all around the complex once he sees a human who
he thinks can help him. But beware his senses have also been heighten and he
will normally attack anything which he suspects is of danger to him.

@{b}Officer Zombie@{ub}

This poor soul used to be an officer brought down to the planet splinn to fight
against the enemy. When the gas was leaked into the living quarters of these
officers they were quickly transformed into vicious zombies with the ability
to throw laser balls. In their last days before they were transformed into
zombies they were developing a strategy to escape from the complex. They planned
this by drawing maps of the vents chambers which they planned to escape in.
They also produced graphs to work out the percentage of civilians who had been
infected by the contagious disease. Whilst these plans were going on hundreds
of zombies were gathering outside the entrance to the living quarters. Enough of
them managed to push the doors open and the base was over run with the undead.
In their dieing moments many of the officers managed to scrape warnings on the
walls with their own blood to warn people not to enter that area.  Unfortunately
there was no one to warn because they were the last survivors...

@{b}Commando Zombie@{ub}

These zombies are very tough, their knowledge of guns and weapons means that they
can fire 5 different types of bolts at you simultaneously! They seem to have
retained their accuracy also because they can fire bolts from over 100 foot away
and still hit you with pin point accuracy. Because of this the commando zombie
is the toughest of the lot and can be found in the later levels such as the
large indoor car parks. They pride themselves on always winning and so will
try anyway they can to kill you, even if it involves following you for miles
through the labyrinth of tunnels in the car parks. A few blasts from your plasma
gun with the lightning bolt upgrade isn't enough to kill them, you'll have to
keep hiding around corners and rapid firing to kill these nightmarish enemies.

@{b}Final Boss Zombie@{ub}

There is little known about this fabled zombie other than it has been exposed
to all of the chemicals in the science labs during horrific tests. Its vast
sized enabled it to easily break free from the chains which bound it and
escape from the labs. It is rumoured that this zombie has a considerably higher
IQ than the others and is hiding somewhere near the shopping Mall. Its
blood curdling screams have been heard coming from the Gallery on the 50th
deck where the reactors are stored....

@node stages "The different stages..."

@{b}@{u}The Stages@{uu}@{ub}

@{b}The Underground storage units@{ub}

These are big and dark, and full of citizen zombies. The zombies are spread out
quite well and there is enough plasm gun powerups for you to battle your way
through quite easily. However don't under estimate how hungry these zombies
are....

@{b}The Science Labs@{ub}

This was the original testing grounds for the zombies, the chemicals contained
within here are mostly responsible for the tougher zombies hiding in the later
levels of the game. These once safe labs are now crawling with ex-scientists who
have an unsatisfiable urge to eat human flesh....

@{b}The Underground Tunnels@{ub}

These tunnels were used by the staff of the Labs to link parts of the complex
together. However many 'rebel punks' used to use them as a place to hang out
and plan crimes and take drugs. The punks are now stumbling round the tunnels
which various limbs missing looking for their next feast of warm human
flesh...

@{b}The Living Quarters@{ub}

This is where the Officers and scientists used to live, now over run by
zombies there is no safe havens within here. In fact there are hundreds of
zombies searching for their next meal....

@{b}The Civilian Car park@{ub}

This indoor multi storey car park was where the citizens of Cramlington used to
store their cars. The building is vast and very dark. Lurking in the shadows
are many of the commando zombies who were originally assigned to wipe out
the infection....

@{b}The Mall@{ub}l

This indoor shopping complex was an important place for all the people
on planet Splinn. It was the only place where they could buy their food and
luxuries. It is now deserted of human life and the corridors are blood stained,
all the shops were left opened, shop window displays still rotate and TV's still
display flickery pictures which were once public broadcasts. Hundreds of citizens
zombies can be found in here staring with dulled fascination at department store
dummies and trying to eat perfume bottles...

@{b}The Military Base@{ub}

This is the military base setup to fight off the enemy's in outer space. Now
over run by zombies the base is a potential time bomb because all the zombies
wield guns and every store room is full of highly explosive dynamite......

@{b}The Gallery@{ub}

This is the final stage of the game, it is rumoured that a zombie of enormous
power lurks within here and you have been told by the council of the new world
order that this is also where you will find the reactors which you must destroy
in order to fulfil your mission....

@node problems "Trouble Shooting"

@{b}@{u}Trouble Shooting@{uu}@{ub}

Although Gloom 3 is mostly bug free (honest!) you may encounter troubles
from time to time. Normally they are to do with your Amiga setup in general.
 Here are a few common problems and how to solve them.

@{b}Problem:@{ub} When I try to play Gloom 3 loads of horrific
colours pop up on my screen and it looks like a Jackson Pollock!

@{b}Solution:@{ub} Well this is usually related to how much free
Chip Ram you have. Once this has happened it will usually stay resident in
the Amigas memory. To solve this problem make sure in 'setup' you have
clicked on 'Close WB' and also make sure you have selected the right CPU
in 'CPU present'. Then reboot your Amiga and regain some chip ram by getting
rid of the Workbench backdrops or reducing your Screenmode to 4 colours. To do
this goto your Workbench directory and open 'Prefs'. Then change the screenmode
using the aptly named 'Screenmode' icon and click on 'WBpattern' to get rid of
any backdrops you might have. There is no need to save these prefs, just click
on 'Use'. Do not attempt to 'boot without startup' because Gloom 3 will not
work without its assigns being setup from the user-startup.


@{b}Problem:@{ub} Gloom goes funny colours on the title screen
and reboots my Amiga!

@{b}Solution:@{ub} This means Gloom has not found the desired
files it needs. Make sure the Gloom 3 assigns which were made during the
installation procedure are still in your user-startup. Also make sure that
the files 'c' and 'sg' are in the Gloom3: assign. If they are not get them
from the CD root directory and copy them across, once you have done
this you must use 'Setup' to configure Gloom 3 again.


@{b}Problem:@{ub} Gloom says 'Please insert Gloom Data Disk'!!!

@{b}Solution:@{ub} See above..


@{b}Problem:@{ub} After running the excellent Gloom 3 introduction
the screen goes black and workbench never returns!

@{b}Solution:@{ub} This is a rare crash so don't let it put
you off running the introduction, unfortunately you will have to reboot
your Amiga now.

@{b}@{u}About Gareth Murfin@{uu}@{ub}

This is Gareth Murfins first commercial game, although he has produced lots
of other software under the name of Alpha Software. All of this is freely
available from the Alpha Software website which is also the official Gloom 3
website. Gareth can also be found on IRC under the nick 'Gaz'. You are
likely to find him in #AmIRC on GalaxyNet. What he doesn't know about Amigas
could be written on the back of a very small postage stamp with a very big
pen. Expect more software from Gareth Murfin soon.....

@node others "Significant others"

@{b}@{u}About the ones worth mentioning again!@{uu}@{ub}

Some people who worked on Gloom really need to be mentioned twice to convince
companies, games developers and programmers to contact them and offer them
lots of money to work on a new game!

@{b}James Caygill@{ub} - Amazing artist for sprites, stills and gory blood effects!!
@{b}Dave Newton@{ub} - The best coder you are likely to find, can do anything you want!!!

These users may be found on #AmIRC GalaxyNet under the nicks of JaiMz and CoOlWave^!

@node pirates "Software Piraters please read..."

Pirate Copy?
------------

If this version of Gloom 3 which you are using is a pirate copy then so be it.
I know what its like you could part with your hard earned cash or get it free
from the Net, it is understandable but it is still wrong. If this is a pirate
version then you are unlikely to get the full speech 'Talkie' intro and the vast
amount of extra's files not to mention the special CD-ROM editions of Gloom
Deluxe and Gloom Classic. You will miss out on these excellent features of
the game simply because you can't be bothered to spend money on the original
and keep the Amiga alive. Thats right, the more you pirate things the more
YOU kill the Amiga. Dont be a hypocrite and talk about the Amigas future because
pirating games is part of the demise of most machines.

So dump your pirate copy and go buy the original, if not for the game for the
lovely shiny new coaster you can rest your favorite mug on...



Keep the Amiga alive....DONT pirate the games......
