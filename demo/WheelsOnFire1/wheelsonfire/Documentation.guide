                              The Main menu
                              -------------


From here, you can move to several submenus or quit the game.
There are four submenus :


1. Start New Game

   By choosing this option, you start an entirely new game in the
   championship mode. You will start on Track 1 in Division no. 1.


2. Load Old Game

   With this option, you are able to load one of six previously saved games.
   Choose your desired game with the "Cycle" gadget. Beneath the gadget, you
   will find a short description of the game.
   If you want to leave this option without loading a game, use the "Arrow"
   gadget.


3. Practice

   As the name tells you, this option enables you to practice a certain
   track, which you will have to choose. You must also choose how many
   rounds you would like to practice.


4. Options

   This menu holds several suboptions.

   "Level"  - Define the skill level of the cpu drivers

   "Tracks" - Choose Tracks from a Trackdisk

   "Music"  - Choose Music during menu and game

   "Name"   - Here you can (and should!) enter you first and last Name. If
              you are already registered for our website, you should also

                    Gameplay in the Championship Mode
                    ---------------------------------


After the main menu, you see the initial placing of each driver, shown by his
or her name. For each division, there are 16 drivers. Each race has four
competitors. If you manage to reach the first or the second place in a race,
you can race another time on this track. Then there will be only 8 drivers
left.
If you make it again, you will race the third and last time on the same
track, and this time, there are only 4 drivers left - you and your
final, best three opponents.
If you won`t make it, you will travel to the next track, but you won`t be
able to make some points another time on your old track - but your opponents
will ! So you better show `em your exhaust pipes !
A Division consists of three tracks.
If you are one of the best eight drivers (out of 16) after three tracks, you
will reach the next division. If not - bad luck, you will have to start
again from the beginning.
If your car should be seriously damaged or even get destroyed and you are
due to insufficient monetary funds unable to get it fixed, the game
immediately ends for you.

Before each race, you will see a slight overview of the track and you will
receive a short description of the scenery. You will also receive some
advices on how to encounter the certain track.
But preceeding this, you are of course be able to fix and / or tune up your
car.

Between track changing, you can save your game.

                      Gameplay in the Practice Mode
                      -----------------------------


After choosing a track in the Practice Menu, you can tune your car a little
bit. The higher the division you have chosen, the more money you can spend
on enhancing your car.
After a short overview of the track the race starts.
You will see your result after the race.
Now, hit ESCAPE to end your practice session or FIRE to continue.

@node L33 "THE RACE"

                                 THE RACE
                                 --------


There are three gauges in your cockpit which show you the following things:
 
 - On the very left side is the Damage Control. This shows you the current
   condition of the armor, the engine, the tyres and the suspension of your
   car. If the color is green, everything is just fine. While the things are
   wearing of or are damaged during a race, the indicator changes its color
   from green over yellow to red. Reach the very last 5% and it will start
   to blink. At last NOW you should be REALLY careful !

 - In the middle there is a speedometer.

 - The right side shows you the current ranking of every driver. It will be
   updated every time a driver passes the finishing line.

To steer your car, you will have to use a joystick.
Accelerate by pressing the FIRE-button (or, optional, the joystick upwards -
you can choose this in a little submenu by pressing the `o` key on your
keyboard during a race). Steer left and right by moving the joystick in the
desired direction. Pull stick backwards to brake. Of course, be careful,
because the brakes of your car are quite good. So you might end up in a wall
or dirt when sliding around due to too much braking.

Every race goes over four laps. If you want your lap to be counted, you MUST
cross all checked markings. You will hear a slight sound, like a
"Ping!".

In the upper corner on your screen stands the LAP-counter. Above this,
your position in the race is shown.

The upper left corner of the screen holds a little overview of the track; it
also shows the whereabouts of the cars.

On the very right side are two time-indicators, Best Lap and Last Lap. If
you manage to drive the best lap time, you will receive another 500$ Bonus
at the end of the race. Last Lap indicates how much time you needed in your
last lap.

@node L34 "Keys"

                                   Keys
                                   ----


During the race, by pressing the "o" key on your keyboard, a little submenu
will appear on the upper side of your screen. Here you can switch on/off the
objects on the edge of the road (like trees and so on), change the viewing
range and the maximum Frames-Per-Second (FPS). On a very slow machine (like
an Amiga 1200 without accelerator board) it would be better to chose the
"17" FPS mode, while accelerated machines would surely prefer the
higher-quality mode "25" FPS. Below this line you can see your actual FPS.
And, you may change the way of accelerating from pressing fire to pushing
the joystick upwards.

By pressing ESCAPE you abandon the game, quitting and leaving the racing
track. Of course, you will be the last one. And you won`t get any points.

During the "Result"-screens, by pressing ESCAPE, you can quit and go to the
main menu screen.

@node L35 "The tuning and fixing facility"

                      The tuning and fixing facility
                      ------------------------------


Here you can fix your car and buy bigger, better, faster and meaner parts
for your car in order to make it faster, harder and more efficient.
The lower left corner shows you the actual status of all four fixable parts.
These are ARMOR, TIRES, SUSPENSION and ENGINE.
The upper left gadget allows you to chose one of this parts.
With the two arrow gadgets right and lower beneath it you may browse around
and choose a part which fits your desires. Buy it by hitting the
"Buy"-gadget. Of course, watch your money !


A short description of those four parts follows.

TIRES      - Your one and only contact with the asphalt. Very essential.
             Ever tried to race without rubber on your wheels ? Could
             become quite nasty ! The better, the more expensive, but
             more grip and you could easily win some valuable seconds
             while easing off your opponents in bends.

             GRIP - The more, the better you can steer your car. No more
                    sliding !

             WEAR - Nothing lasts forever. The higher this number and
                    the faster your tires will be crap.


ENGINE     - Internal Combustion Engine. Source of raw power, a really
             macho thing. Wanna impress your girlfriend ? Nothing more
             easy than that. Step on the gas and let your engine roar -
             look, what a man ! Absolutely essential for acceleration !

             POWER - Guess what... horsepower ! The more, the better and
                     faster your machine will accelerate...

             WEAR  - The higher, the lesser the time the engine will
                     last.


SUSPENSION - Shock absorbers and stabilization units. No car can do
             without it. These Units control the movements of your car
             and are, especially on rough ground, very important. Some
             people tend to underestimate the suspension; don`t do this.
             Your next jump could be your last.

             HANDLING - The higher, the better you can steer your car on
                        the asphalt, especially on rough ground and when
                        landing after jumps.

             WEAR     - The higher this number, the faster the shock
                        absorbing parts will fade away.

ARMOR      - Guess What ! Your vehicle is equipped with raw armor
             plates, fitted on the outer metal parts. It`s bullet-proof
             and vehicle-proof, as long as you don`t hit too many
             opponent`s cars or walls or hills or something like that.
             Hitting things will reduce the efficiency of your armor.
             Reduced armor efficiency results in more damage coming
             through to your vital parts - Engine, Tires and Suspension.
             If you are running very low on armor and hit something,
             nearly all damage will travel uncompensated to your inner
             core and destroy those vital parts ! Keep your armor at a
             high rating, or - don`t hit anything !

             STABILITY - The higher, the harder your armor is. The
                         better it`s able to absorb damage and protect you.

             WEIGHT    - Armor is made of heavy steel and alloy works.
                         This is heavy metal and it has some certain
                         weight. The higher this rating, the more your
                         armor would slow you down.

                           Internet competition
                           --------------------


The URL is : "http://members.aol.com/prolixity7"

Here you can find a high-score list for every track. If you want to join the
competition for the first place, just leave me an eMail, including your
registration number (if you have only the Preview, ignore this number!)
your eMail address and the Name, under which you will be included in the
list. Please note that names longer than 23 chars are not allowed.

A better way is to fill in the little registration form on our website.
You should prefer this way, its much more easier for you and me.

Then I will send you your personal User-ID. Enter this User-ID in the
Options-Menu. Remember : Only times with a valid User-ID are posted in the
list. TIMES WITHOUT USER-ID ARE NOT ALLOWED !

So you better go and get your own User-ID fast !

This User-ID is saved, along with your Name and all other preferences when
leaving the game.

So, if you have raced a few times and think you`re good enough for our list,
you just have to send me your BestLaps-File by eMail. What is my
BestLap-File, you ask ? Well, listen :
You will find your BestLaps-File in the Wheelsonfire - directory, in the
subdir "Destmaps". The file looks like the following :


  ZZxxxxxx.TP0   <--- this file is, under all circumstances, 7208 bytes long
       ^    ^
       |    `--------- track pack 0. we will supply you with further tracks.
       |
       `--------------- instead of these six `x`, your User-ID will be there.
                        If not, your User-ID is invalid or you 
                        entered the wrong ID.


If you have found this file and successfully sent it to me via eMail, you
just have to wait some few days and you will appear in the Highscorelist !!

                             FAQ and problems
                             ----------------


Q: The Game crashes during loading ! Why ?
A: It could be that the total RAM of your machine is not enough. Close
   all other programs, disconnect all external floppy drives and boot again,
   without startup-sequence.

Q: The graphics of the game are corrupted... why ?
A: The game DOES NEED a PAL-Screen to run properly ! Therefore you *MUST*
   use a Monitor capable of displaying PAL-Screens to run the game.
   If you are using a screen-promoter, advise it to re-route the game to a
   PAL-screen. In the Preferences-program "IControl" turn off the option
   "Same Mode".
   If this doesn`t work, try booting without startup-sequence.

Q: The screen turns to black during the menus.
A: Thats not really a problem, only your screensaver ;)


If you still have problems, try and reach me via eMail and tell me your
problems. I will give my best to help you.
