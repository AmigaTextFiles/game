@Node Introduction "Introduction"

Finally one of the most famous 3d racing game appears for our beloved
AMIGA. Wipeout2097 is a cult game among all Playstation games and it
gave the term 'speed' a completely new dimension.

Wipeout2097 is a highly demanding game, therefore the hardware
requirements are high. The game uses some of the latest technologies
available for AMIGA.

The AMIGA version of Wipeout2097 is based on the PC version, which
itself was derived from the Playstation version. Those people which
already know these other versions, will quickly get familiar with
the AMIGA version, too.

Some new features were added to the new AMIGA version, which aren't
present in the other versions. Those features are explained later
in this document.

Now enjoy!

@Node DemoInfo "Infos for the demo version"

The demo version has the following limitations compared to the full
version of the game:

- No support for CD audio tracks
- No MPEG animations
- 1 race track instead of 8
- 3 weapons/extras instead of 8
- Only the 'arcade' mode is available, while the full version also
  provides the 'time trial' mode and two 'challenge' modes.
- Only the 'vector' and 'rapier' racing classes are available, while
  the full version provides 4 different racing classes.
- Some of the option menus are disabled in the demo version.

@EndNode

@Node Requirements "System requirements"

The following hardware/software components are required by Wipeout2097:

- PowerPC processor.

- 3d graphics card (i.e CyberVision3D, CyberVisionPPC, BVisionPPC or
  3d cards which will be released in future). We recommend at least
  a 3d card equipped with 3d chips having the power of a Permedia2.

- At least 24MB FAST-RAM. We recommend at least 32MB FAST-RAM. For
  systems with 24MB it might be necessary to save additional memory,
  which is allocated by various software components when the AMIGA
  workbench is started.

- CD-ROM drive (not required for the demo version)

- OS 3.0. We recommend OS 3.1

- CyberGraphX or Picasso96, we recommend the latest version.

- WarpUp V4 (is also present on the Wipeout2097 CD)

- Warp3D V2 (is also present on the Wipeout2097 CD). We recommend
  to install the version located on the CD, because it provides
  some corrections and improvements. Certainly you shouldn't
  install the version if you have already a Warp3D version with
  higher version number installed, so please check the version of
  your currently installed Warp3D system first.

- lowlevel.library for joypad support.

The game can be controlled with keyboard, mouse, joystick and
joypad. The joystick control does only make sense in conjunction
with a keyboard.

We recommend control using keyboard or joypad. Again, you need
the 'lowlevel.library' to be able to use the joypad. The
'lowlevel.library' is part of AMIGA-OS since OS 3.1.

@Node Installation "Installation"

First, before installing the game, you should make sure that you
have WarpUp V4 and Warp3D V2 installed. Both software packages
are found on this CD. We strongly recommend that you study the
documentation of these packages to avoid problems as much as
possible. Absolutely try to make the supplied demos running first,
before installing this game.

If you experience problems with these software components, then the
authors of these software systems will certainly be able to give
you some tips. The corresponding email addresses can be found
in the documentation of these software packages.


The demo version of Wipeout2097 doesn't need to be installed. Only
an assign 'WO2097:' must be created to point to the directory
'Wipeout2097_Demo', which can be done by running the 'MakeAssign'
script.

@Node Start "Starting the game"

The game is started by double-clicking the appropriate icon. First,
the @{"setup window" link Config} is opened which allows to modify
various settings for the game. After successfully finishing the
configuration, some logos are displayed for a certain amount of time.
You can press enter to abort displaying these logos.

Before starting the game, running applications should be terminated,
because they occupy memory and because they reduce the game
performance. Also make sure, that the workbench isn't running at
very high resolution/color depth, so that the game will get enough
video memory. That's especially important for graphics board with
few video memory, such as the CyberVision3D.

@EndNode

@Node Config "The setup window"

After starting the program, a setup window appears. The button 'Cancel'
terminates the game instantly, while the button 'Play' closes the setup
window and begins loading the game. Finally the button 'Save' saves the
current configuration. The saved configuration is automatically loaded
next time when the game is started.

Here is a description of all options in the setup window:

- Warp3D Driver

  Allows to switch between 3d hardware driver and software driver. This
  option is only active, if a Warp3D software driver exists. Right now,
  as this document is written, there doesn't exist such a software driver.

- Graphics Mode

  This option defines the environment, where the game should run.
  Possible choices are:

  - Window                 : The game runs in a window on the workbench.
                             IMPORTANT: the workbench must be using
                             a 15/16 bit screen, otherwise it won't work!
  - Double Buffered Screen : The game runs on its own screen. Double buffering
                             is used for smooth animations.
  - Triple Buffered Screen : Basically the same like the previous choice,
                             but three buffers are used instead of two. This
                             leads to better and more constant performance,
                             but needs more video memory.

- Select

  After this button is pressed, a screenmode requester appears, which allows
  to select a screen mode. Only 15/16 bit modes are presented, because
  the game only works in 15/16 bit. The currently selected screen mode
  is displayed in the 'ModeID' element.

- Speed Limit

  Defines the maximal frame rate of the game. Wipeout2097 becomes too
  fast, when frame rate goes up too much, therefore a limitation of
  the frame rate can be useful, especially for very fast hardware.
  This also leads to a more constant performance.

- Unlimited

  Disables the limitation of the frame rate.

- Texture Memory

  Defines, how much video memory is reserved for textures. The higher
  this value, the more detailes textures are used, but the less
  video memory is available for other things. If the game should be
  played in very high resolution it is necessary to reduce this value.
  Owners of 4MB graphics boards should definitely reduce this value
  to a small value.

- Mipmapping

  If enabled, 'mipmapping' can be used to improve the graphics quality
  during the race. This function only has an effect, if the 3d hardware
  supports 'mipmapping'. This is not the case for the Permedia2.

  Important: making this option active does not yet enable mipmapping
  during the race. It is necessary to select an appropriate filter mode
  during the race (using the F7 key) to enable mipmapping.

- Audio AHI

  If this option is active, the audio standard AHI unit 0 is used for
  playing the sound effects (this way sound cards can be used for
  playing sound). Otherwise audio.device (and so the Paula chip of the
  AMIGA) is used.

- Swap Audio Channels

  Both audio channels are swapped when playing sound effects. This has
  no effect on playing CD audio tracks.

- Half Volume

  If this option is activated, the sound effects are played at half
  volume. This can improve the quality of the sound effects very much,
  if the AMIGA's audio chip (Paula) is used to play the sound effects.
  To compensate for the lower volume, you can adjust the sound effect
  volume during the game, without losing quality.

- CD Audio

  If this option is disabled, then the CD audio tracks aren't played
  during the game.

- Play Intro

  If this option is disabled, the intro animation is skipped.

@Node Features "AMIGA specific features"

The AMIGA version of Wipeout2097 works basically exactly like the
PC version, but some new features were added. These features can
mainly be selected by pressing several F-keys during the race.

Here is the list of all features accessible by the F keys:

F1 : Switch between external and internal view. In the latter case
     the viewer is inside the ship, so that the own ship isn't visible.
F2 : Defines the mouse sensitivity. By pressing the key repeatedly
     different sensitivity values can be chosen.
F3 : Sets the view distance. By repeated pressing of this key, different
     view distances can be selected. The view distance has a major
     impact on the game performance, a short view distance leads
     to less objects displayed and therefore to faster performance.
F4 : Switches between different lighting effects, which are visible
     at the back of each ship.
F5 : Enables/disables the sky.
F6 : Enables/disables fogging. The sky is implicitly disabled. This
     features is AMIGA specific.
F7 : Switches between different filter modes. By repeated pressing
     of the key the following filters can be selected:
     - FILTERING OFF       : no filtering is done
     - BILINEAR FILTER     : bilinear filtering is applied to the textures
     - BILINEAR/MIPMAPPING : bilinear filtering and mipmapping is used.
                             This mode is only available, if the hardware
                             supports mipmapping and if mipmapping was
                             enabled in the setup window.
     - TRILINEAR FILTER :    trilinear filtering is used. The same restrictions
                             apply like for the previous point.
     The last two filter modes are AMIGA specific.
F8 : Sets the brightness of the graphics display (AMIGA specific)
F9 : Enables/disables linear texture mapping (AMIGA specific)
F10: Enables/disables dithering (AMIGA specific). Dithering can only
     be disabled, if the env variable 'Warp3D/Permedia2/Dither' is set
     to 'off' (only valid for Permedia2-based boards).

@Node TroubleShooting "Troubleshooting"

Now we would like to provide some hints, if problems occur with this
game.

The most important thing is first, that you make sure, that the
software components WarpUp and Warp3D work corretly. This can be
verified using demos which are supplied to the software packages.
If it turns out, that there are problems with these software components,
then you should contact the authors of the software, so that they
can help you to solve the problem.

If the game doesn't work, you should first check, whether the minimal
@{"requirements" link Requirements} are satisfied. When using high-resolution textures
(which are used, if the option 'texture memory' in the @{"setup window" link Config}
is set to the maximal value) you should have at least 20MB free FAST-RAM.
If this isn't the case you should reduce the 'texture memory' parameter
to a smaller value.

It is also very important that the workbench isn't running in very
high resolution/depth, because much video memory is lost then. Additionally
there shouldn't be too many windows open as they also occupy video
memory.

Enabling triple buffering also leads to more video memory used by the
game.

If the game is played in window mode, then the workbench must absolutely
be running in a 15/16 bit screen mode.

In general whenever you get problems it might be a good idea to play
around with the options in the setup requester. Maybe the problem can
be bypassed by selecting other options. If you get troubles when trying
to use audio.device sound, please install AHI (can be found on Aminet),
select AHI mode in the setup requester and retry.

If the window becomes black when resizing it, there are two reasons how
this can happen:

- The window was made very large, so that the video memory wasn't
sufficient anymore.

- An error inside of Warp3D can lead to similar problems. In this case
you should install the Warp3D version found on the Wipeout2097 CD,
which should solve the problem.


More possible problems:

- No CD tracks are played during MPEG animations. This happens, when
the game was installed using 'small' or 'medium' installation type.
The MPEG animations were not installed to the hard disk and are
therefore read from CD. This can't work in parallel to playing CD
audio tracks.

- During the race some textures aren't displayed correctly. This
might be a sign that there is very few video memory available.
In this case video memory should be freed by closing windows or
by reducing resolution and depth of the workbench. Additionally
make sure to reduce the 'texture memory' parameter in the setup
window and not to enable triple buffering.

- During the race, the game instantly freezes and so does the whole
system. Although we can't exclude the possibility of the game having
errors, it is much more likely that such a problem might be caused
by overheated hardware. In the past it was shown often, that similar
problems appeared for similar applications, which could be solved
by adding more cooling devices.

- If the game runs very slowly, there are several possibilities to
increase the game performance. The best options to do this are:

        - Reduce resolution
        - Reduce view distance (F3)
        - Disable the sky (F5)
        - Disable filtering (F7)
        - Disable lighting effects (F4)
        - Disable perspective texture mapping (F9)

- When simultaneously pressing several keys on the keyboard, some
of the keystrokes get lost. The reason for this problem lies in some
special behaviour of the AMIGA keyboards, which sometimes really lose
keystrokes for special key combinations. A possible solution might be
the redefinition of the WO2097 keyboard layout in the in-game
configuration menus.

- The sound quality is bad. This problem pops up when playing sound using
the sound chip of the AMIGA, as it's resolution is only 8 bit. To improve
sound quality, three possibilities exist:
        - Enable the 'half volume' option in the setup requester
        - Use a sound card instead of the AMIGA sound chip
        - Use the AHI sound driver. In the AHI preferences window you
          can select an output format of 'Paula 14 Bit Stereo++'. This
          improves sound quality quite a lot.
