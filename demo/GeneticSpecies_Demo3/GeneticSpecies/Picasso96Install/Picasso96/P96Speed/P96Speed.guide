@{b}Introduction:@{ub}

P96Speed is my first try of coding a little and tidy program which
isn`t totally useless and people can be happy with ! ;)
It`s a speed test program for Amiga graphics cards like WSpeed or
IntuiSpeed.

First of all I HAVE TO tell you that this version is a really
FIRST BETA VERSION and isn`t 100% finished or working totally correct.

@{b}The reason why I released this betaversion to the public is that I
NEED help on going on with it.@{ub}

Some of the routines I created for P96Speed are not working correct
and therefore I need help from you - how can I implement them in another
way ?

The reason why I decided to code a graphics speed test program is because
WSpeed and IntuiSpeed is quite old and that was the only way for me to
learn more about C-Programming and to start with it.

I hope you like my little program and will support it by sending E-Mails
to me with suggestions and bugreports. Iam also very interested in
getting direct help from other programmers so that my speed test routines
will get more accurate.

Please send all your mails to: deck@rcs.urz.tu-dresden.de
                        or to: jlangner@villagetronic.com





AND SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISH HERE - I HACKED THIS GUIDE IN 5 MINS
I PROMISE THAT THE FINAL ONE WILL BE BETTER ! ;))

@TOC "MAIN"

@{b}Usage: @{ub}
Start P96Speed directly from CLI or WB without any options:

- Choose your ScreenMode and select the Testfunction.
- Then you can Save your results.

That should be all - quite short, eh ? ;)

Please use the included installscript for installing P96Speed to your System.
This Script will do all work for you !!

make one for me and send it by e-mail.

@{b}History: @{ub}

P96Speed v0.01-0.09ß    - internal betaversions.

P96Speed v0.10ß         - first public betaversion.

P96Speed v0.11ß         - added WriteChunkyPixels() testroutine.
                        - added WritePixelArray8() testroutine.
                        - added WritePixelLine8() testroutine.
                        - optimized all testroutines to show
                          more accurate results.
                        - changed ASL-Screenmode Requester to pop up
                          in "sticky" mode (actual screenmode).
                        - removed "ops"-Results because they are
                          not needed.
                        - added saveroutine for saveing your results.

P96Speed v0.12ß         - added RectFill() with Pattern testroutine.
                        - added CON-Output testroutine.
                        - switched all screens to open in standard
                          Topaz/8 Mode for more accurate tests.
                        - changed SizeWindow() routine to just size
                          between to different sizes.
                        - fixed a small bug if you don`t selected
                          another screenmode than your default one.
                        - included "identify.library" support to get
                          system informations.
                        - restyled the GUI.
                        - restyled the saveing routine.
                        - added slider for selecting the testlength
                        - added PowerPC recogniction but don`t know
                          exactly if it work ;) (hope my PPC will be
                          come soon)

P96Speed v0.13ß         - reworked DrawEllipse() and DrawCircle() to be
                          sure that radius will not be zero.
                        - reworked DrawEllipse() to be sure that it will
                          draw real ellipses and not r1=r2.
                        - added kickstart 3.1 recognition for disabling
                          routines that will only work with 3.1 and
                          therefore it must be disabled for other versions.
                        - noticed that Text() is a routine of the
                          graphics library and so I moved it to the correct
                          Position in the GUI.
                        - removed bug in ASL FileRequester. If Filerequester
                          was canceled P96Speed locked.
                        - removed bug in CON-Output. Window will open on it`s right screen now.
                        - added PLAIN and NOSIZE to the CON-Output routine
                          for more accurate results.
                        - now the File- and Screenrequester will be opened on the same
                          screen as the mainwindow.
                        - removed Enforcerhit at WritePixelLine8() and
                          WritePixelArray8() routines.
                        - changed the way the screenmoderequester will handle
                          screenmodes if the user allready selected one or canceled
                          the requester.
                        - include a installscript in future version.

P96Speed v0.14ß         - removed bug in ASL-Filerequester. The File was not saved if the
                          path was not a root path.
                        - removed little bug in installscript.
                        - did some cosmetic changes to the GUI.
                        - prepared the GUI for the upcoming comparsion module which will
                          be implemented in the 0.15ß release (can take some time).
