What the heck is it?
--------------------

I received this demo as an lhwarp archive from ab20.larc.nasa.gov
via ftp on a Sun 4/60. There was a text file which had been made
executable in the lhwarp file, it was corrupt, so it's gone.

This archive contains a fully authorized (I'm told) demo of the
new LucasFilm (tm) game "The Secret of Monkey Island" (c). It's
really neat, in my opinion. Awfully funny game! 

How do I get it working?
------------------------

Ok, easy question...two possibilities.

1) run it from a HD.

2) put it on a floppy or in a RAM disk.


If you wish to put it on a HD, which works fine, then:

o copy all the files from the ROOT of the archive, ie.

  MonkeyDemo
  MonkeyDemo.info
  .info

  to a directory on the HD with any name you wish...
  in the same directory make a subdirectory named "Rooms" and
  copy all the files in the Rooms directory there.

  The HD_Install script will do this for you if you wish use it
  like this:

Shell> HD_Install <HD Partition>

  where <HD Partition> is DH0:, DH1:, FH0:, whatever...
  

For a floppy.

o copy ALL of the files to any empty, formatted disk, then install it.
  this is done by:

Shell> install <drive>

  The Floppy_Install script will do this for you, use it like this:

Shell> cd <to where the Monkey Island files are>
Shell> Floppy_Install <drive>

  where <drive> is DF0:, DF1:, etc.


Now just double click on the Demo icon and have fun!

Enjoy!
