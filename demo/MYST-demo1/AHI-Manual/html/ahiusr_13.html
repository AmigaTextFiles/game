On this page you select which audio mode to use.  You can select audio mode
for both low-level programs (<SAMP>`Music unit'</SAMP>) and other programs
(<SAMP>`Unit n'</SAMP>) that don't require low-level audio access such as the
AUDIO:  device (see section <A HREF="ahiusr_15.html#SEC15">AHI-Handler</A>), sample players etc.  You can also
select the sample mixing (and recording) frequency to use and how many
channels you wish use <A NAME="DOCF6" HREF="ahiusr_foot.html#FOOT6">(6)</A>.  Furthermore, you
can set three hardware properties of your sound hardware, namely the
<STRONG>output volume</STRONG>, <STRONG>monitor volume</STRONG> and <STRONG>input gain</STRONG>.  Finally,
you can select which input and output connectors you wish to use.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`Music unit'</SAMP> is the defaults for low-level programs.  Such
programs often have an audio mode requester that lets you chose an audio
mode.  If you chose <SAMP>`Default audio mode'</SAMP> from this requester, these
settings will be used.  Note that the number of channels is not selectable
here, it's up to the application program to decide how many channels to
use.
