The author wish to give special thanks to the following persons
(in alphabetical order):

<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Amiga Translators' Organization
<DD>
For the catalog translations.

<DT>Daniel Arthursson and Johan Nyblom
<DD>
For making it possible to write the first driver for a sound card, the
<STRONG>Wavetools</STRONG> card.  I'm sure AHI would not have been accepted as
quick as it was without this driver.  Funny that it didn't even
work@enddots{}

<DT>Christian Buchner
<DD>
For the calibrated 14 bit routines for Paula.

<DT>SAS Institute, Inc. and Steve Krueger
<DD>
For the compiler and all the updates.

<DT>Jyrki Petsalo and Teemu Suikki
<DD>
For the Delfina driver, and for supporting AHI in the early days.  And
of course, for the sound card!

<DT>Pauli Porkka
<DD>
For active support and promotion of AHI from the beginning.

<DT>All the rest
<DD>
Many, many other have helped me, sent suggestions etc.  I owe you a lot.
