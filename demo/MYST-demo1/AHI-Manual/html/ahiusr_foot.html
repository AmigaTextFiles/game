<P>Paula is one of the
custom chips, and she is responsible for the sound (and more).
Unfortunately, this chip has not been updated since the very first Amiga
was released.

<P>The name AHI was chosen because the
functions in the system had to have a prefix, and the author couldn't come
up with anything better than <STRONG>Audio Hardware Interface</STRONG>, something that
he has regretted ever since.  The suggested pronunciation is "atchii", as
in "God bless!".

<P>Originally designed in 1986 by Karsten Obarski, modules have
become a de facto standard for game and demo music.  The original format
has been improved many times, and many new music formats have--more or
less--been derived from it, including the popular <STRONG>S3M</STRONG> and <STRONG>XM</STRONG>
formats.

<P>The more channels you select, the more
sounds can you play at the same time.  However, due to the nature of sound
mixing, the volume will decrease as well.  If you try to play more sounds
at the same time than there are channels, the least important sounds will
be muted until the other sounds have finished playing.
