 The I/O request protocol makes it very easy to play audio streams, sounds
from disk and non time-critical sound effects in a multitasking friendly
way.  Recoding is just as easy, on behalf of quality.  Several programs can
play sounds at the same time, and even record at the same time if your
hardware is full duplex.

 If you want to write a sample player, play (warning?) sounds in your
applications, play an audio stream from a CD via the SCSI/IDE bus, write a
voice command utility etc., this is the API to use.

 Note that while all the low-level functions (see section <A HREF="ahidev_5.html#SEC5">Function Interface</A>)
count lengths and offsets in sample frames, the device interface--like all
Amiga devices--uses bytes.
