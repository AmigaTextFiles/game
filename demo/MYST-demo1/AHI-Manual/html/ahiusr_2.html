AHI is available as <STRONG>freeware</STRONG>.  That is, it may be freely
distributed in unmodified form with no changes what so ever, but you may
not charge more than a nominal fee covering distribution costs.  However,
donations are welcome (see section <A HREF="ahiusr_3.html#SEC3">Donations</A>).

</P>
<P>
If you use this software in a commercial or shareware software product,
please consider giving the author (see section <A HREF="ahiusr_19.html#SEC19">The Author</A>)---and preferably
each one of the contributors (see section <A HREF="ahiusr_24.html#SEC24">Contributors</A>) too--an original or
registered version of your work.  Should you want to distribute the
AHI software with your own product, there is really nothing to
consider, is it?

</P>
<P>
If you wish to distribute this software with a hardware product, contact
the author (see section <A HREF="ahiusr_19.html#SEC19">The Author</A>).  Distribution of AHI with hardware
products is <EM>not</EM> free.
