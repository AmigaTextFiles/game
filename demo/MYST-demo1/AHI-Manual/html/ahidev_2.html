AHI is available as <STRONG>freeware</STRONG>.  That is, it may be freely
distributed in unmodified form with no changes what so ever, but you may
not charge more than a nominal fee covering distribution costs. However,
donations are welcome (see <CITE>AHI User's Guide</CITE>).

</P>
<P>
If you use this software in a commercial or shareware product, please
consider giving the author (see section <A HREF="ahidev_3.html#SEC3">The Author</A>)---and preferably each one
of the contributors too (see <CITE>AHI User's Guide</CITE>)---an original or
registered version of your work.  Should you want to distribute the AHI
software with your own product, there is really nothing to consider, is it?

</P>
<P>
If you wish to distribute this software with a hardware product, contact
the author (see section <A HREF="ahidev_3.html#SEC3">The Author</A>).  Distribution of AHI with hardware
products is <EM>not</EM> free.
