This document was written in order to make it easier for developers to
understand and use AHI in their own productions, and write Software
That Works(TM).

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ahi.device</CODE> has two different API's; one library-like function
interface (low-level), and one "normal" device interface (high-level).
Each of them serves different purposes.  The low-level interface is
targeting music players, games and real-time applications. The high-level
interface is targeting applications that just want to have a sample played,
play audio streams or record samples as easily as possible.

</P>
<P>
As with everything else, it is important that you chose the right tool for
the job--you'll only get frustrated otherwise.

</P>
<P>
Not everything about AHI is documented here; for more information, see
<CITE>AHI User's Guide</CITE> and the autodocs.
