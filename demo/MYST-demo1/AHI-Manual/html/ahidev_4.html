<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Sample</STRONG>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
 
A sample is one binary number, representing the amplitude at a fixed point
in time.  A sample is often stored as an 8 bit signed integer, a 16 bit
signed integer, a 32 bit floating point number etc.  AHI only
supports integers.

<DT><STRONG>Sample frame</STRONG>
<DD>
In mono environments, a sample frame is the same as a sample.  In stereo
environments, a sample frame is a tuple of two samples.  The first member
is for the left channel, the second for the right.

<A NAME="IDX13"></A>

<DT><STRONG>Sound</STRONG>
<DD>
Many sample frames stored in sequence as an array can be called a sound.  A
sound is, however, not limited to being formed by samples, it can also be
parameters to an analog synth or a MIDI instrument, or be white noise.
AHI only supports sounds formed by samples.
