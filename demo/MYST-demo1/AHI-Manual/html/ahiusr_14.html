This page contains some options that should not be used if you don't
understand them.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`Debug level'</SAMP>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
 
Sets the debug level for AHI.  If not <SAMP>`None'</SAMP>, AHI will print
debug information to the serial port.

<A NAME="IDX25"></A>

<DT><SAMP>`Echo'</SAMP>
<DD>
On slow processors (like anything below a MC68040) echo can take so much
CPU power that it becomes unusable, and can therefore be disabled.  As an
alternative, echo can be done <SAMP>`Fast'</SAMP>, which means that the parameters
will be twisted in order to gain speed.  The result may not be what the
composer or programmer wanted, but at least it's echo.

<A NAME="IDX26"></A>

<DT><SAMP>`Surround in "Fast" modes'</SAMP>
<DD>
In modes that use multiplication tables (the so-called "fast" modes) all
surround sounds have to be mixing without using tables.  In order to make
mixing as fast as possible, surround sounds can be forced to ordinary ones
by disabling them.

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>

<DT><SAMP>`Master volume'</SAMP>
<DD>
Normally, the "Master volume" feature of AHI can make the output heavily
distorted if set too high.  Turning "clipping" on can reduce the
distortion, but will--in the current implementation--use 128 kB of extra
memory.  Note that the so-called "HiFi" modes are not affected by this
switch (see section <A HREF="ahiusr_18.html#SEC18">The Mode Descriptors</A>).

<A NAME="IDX29"></A>

<DT><SAMP>`CPU usage limit'</SAMP>
<DD>
Some hardware drivers (but not all) can be told not to use more that a
given percentage of the available CPU time in order to prevent lockups.  If
your mouse pointer freezes when playing music, reduce the limit slightly.
If on the other hand the sound becomes cut and distorted, you can try to
increase the limit--but remember that you risk locking up the computer!
