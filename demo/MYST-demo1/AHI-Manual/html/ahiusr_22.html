What do you do if you don't have the patience to write applications, if you
only write moderate demos, are tired of utilities, hate BBS doors, are
totally fed up with playing games and have decided to get legal and stop
pirating software?  Simple.  Try a new concept!

</P>
<P>
Take a deep breath.  Close your eyes.  Think of one thing your computer
lacks.  Think of one of the things that makes your favorite toy feel
outdated.  Think of something that nobody has (successfully) tried before.
Then write the software, and release it as Freeware.

<P>
In Martins case, that something was hardware independent audio.

Come on, admit it!  It's brilliant.  It doesn't matter if you are a good
programmer.  It doesn't matter if it takes 3 years to get to a
half-finished product.  It doesn't matter if you give it the most
unimaginative name in the world--you can even use a TLA <A NAME="DOCF12" HREF="ahiusr_foot.html#FOOT12">(12)</A>.  Nobody is going to say your software sucks, because
nobody can say he has done better himself.  Nobody is going to complain if
you're slow on releasing bug fixes and updates, because the software is
free.  And nobody is going to be angry with you if you stop developing the
software--because it sucked in the first place, remember?

</P>
<P>
This concept won't make you rich, but are rich people really happier?
