@node _intro "What is PairsNG ?"
@font helvetica.font 11

@{b} Introduction / Playing PairsNG@{ub}

  PairsNG is a board game of Shanghai style.

  You may choose between three different skill modes:

  Beginner:@{Tab}12 * 8 stones@{Tab}240 seconds time
  Normal:@{Tab}18 * 12 stones@{Tab}480 seconds time
  Profi:@{Tab}24 * 16 stones@{Tab}860 seconds time
  
  The stones are mixed and build up randomly to the board. 

  You have to break up all stones from the board in the given time. 

  Choose a stone and click on it - the stone will be stored, now click on another
  one of the same kind; the program is attempting to draw a line now.

  The clicked stones will only be breaked up, if there is a direct line between the two
  stones. Is the line blocked from another stone, this does not work. The line between
  the stones may snap off twice in 90 degrees.

  If you managed to draw a line, it will be displayed for a short moment. You get 10 points
  for each breakupped pair.

  Are all stones are breaked up - you get a time bonus for the rest time. The next level
  starts with a new board, but @{b}time will be reduced 30 seconds for each level !@{ub}
  
  Bonus points for each pair: 5 Points per second

  If alle stones are broke up, the game is over.

  
  @{b}Item fields:@{ub}
  The stones are black-yellow lined. If such a pair is choosen, you will get one of twelve
  different items. This items can be positive or negative - time, points or stones.

  You don't need to build up item fields - you are free in your decision ;-)

Some flag Gfx are based of Reinhard Köpkes flags 
homepage. The homepage is down since some months :-(

The PairsNG Glowicon is based of an icon named 
"Strange People" - author unknown

The drawer icon has been taken from the FenriXGIcons 
collection (Aminet) by Xavier Bodénand.

Pairs NG uses wizard.library by Haage&Partner
and lucyplay.libarary by Oliver Gantert

The sounds have taken from Corel Gallery Magic

@node _bug "Known Bugs and Incompatibilities"
@font helvetica.font 11


@{b}Visual Prefs@{ub}
Depth Gadget of the boards window is not working.

->Solution:
Visual Prefs is a hack that causes sometimes problems. You have to edit
the VPrefs settings to get PairsNG started; under VPrefs you have to click
right from the windows depth gadget to select ?!! This is not a bug of
PairsNG.


@{b}Problems with the stone selection@{ub}
If it occurs that the pairs won't build up after they are clicked right, you
could try to change the double click delay in Prefs/Input, e.g. change it to 2.04s


@{b}Slow Gameplay@{ub}

->Solution: 
It is recommended to close all background windows on your Workbench, you doesn't need.

Turn off the highlighting mode (press F4 in-game, or pre-select in the Main Menu -> Marker off)

@node _faq "The PairsNG FAQ - Frequently asked questions"
@font helvetica.font 11

@{b}Frequently asked questions:@{ub}


@{b}Is there a PPC-version in development ?@{ub}
A PPC-version is not planed. But PairsNG uses indirectly the PPC,
if you have installed a PPC JPEG/JFIF datatype (WOS or PPC).

@{b}While playing the game stopped with a debug requester.@{ub} 
The current version is still Beta with activated debug mode! If the 
engine has noticed a bug - the game will be aborted and a window will be
openend, displaying a number; eg. f1b2. If this occures, please send this
code to me. The error will be removed immediatly. Please check my homepage
for updates. It's important to send me a debugcode if one should occure; so
thank you very much.

@{b}The graphic of the skin/stones looks abnormal, what's wrong ?@{ub}
Your JPEG/JFIF datatype is unusable or too old. Please install a new version.

@{b}Will future versions of PairsNG support PAL/NTSC resolutions under OCS/ECS/AGA ?@{ub}
Definitly not. Please upgrade your Amiga with a graphics board.
