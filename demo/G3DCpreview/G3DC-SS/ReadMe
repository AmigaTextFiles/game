  Gloom 3 - The Director's Cut Preview Slideshow
  ----------------------------------------------
  By Gareth Murfin


  This is a slideshow of screenshots from the up and coming Amiga title By Alpha
  Software, Gloom 3 - The Director's Cut (G3DC). G3DC is still in an early stage
  of development but these screen shots show how it appears at the moment, and
  are a good indication of what the final game will look like.

  G3DC is a completely new game and not just a re-vamp of Gloom 3 - Ultimate Gloom.
  Many, many improvements have been made to make sure this is the best Gloom game
  yet, and to hopefully compete with Amiga Doom & Quake for low end Amiga user's
  who can't play Quake/Doom at a playable rate. G3DC is still a great buy for all
  Amiga owners with its 020/030/040/060 & GFX card enhanced routines.

  A few new features in G3DC include :

  - 50 New levels with enhanced level design
  - All new GFX & SFX created by Professionals (this time!)
  - 11 new characters each with 48 frames of animation (as oppose to g3's 16!)
  - Full Multitasking on Amiga's with 5 Meg+ (Play in any screenmode!)
  - New Shadow & Lighting effects (experience the game not just play it!)
  - New enemy Artificial Intelligence (enemies hide, then attack you from behind)
  - 60 Meg FMV full screen intro with actors! (on 030 11 Meg)
  - 60 Meg FMV out-takes (see the actor bloopers!)
  - 30 Meg of Alpha Freeware releases (save's you having to download them!)
  - G3DC Desktop package + Screen saver (give your WB a G3DC theme)
  - Fully Interactive Monroeville Mall (Walk the set of Dawn of the dead)
  - Audio tracks from the award winning 'William Morton' (Live performances!)
  - Artwork from the award winning 'Jason Jordache'
  - 'GloomHack' provides a 33% speed increase on all Amiga's with 5 Meg+

  Plus, LOTS, LOTS more! (any suggestions to gazy@globalnet.co.uk)

  G3DC is a CD-ROM release and already consists of more than 150 meg of pure
  quality, piraters will NOT even get a taster of the real thing.


  The Intro slideshow
  -------------------

  The introduction slide show is a few grabs from the full motion video introduction
  which has full speech and music and plays at a staggering 19fps even on an 030 AGA
  Amiga. The introduction lasts around 7 minutes and uses over 70 meg on the CD-ROM.
  These grabs are *exactly* what the introduction will look like in the final game,
  except they appear slightly worse as individual frames rather than streaming video.
