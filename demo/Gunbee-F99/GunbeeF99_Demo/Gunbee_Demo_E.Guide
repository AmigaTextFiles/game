@NODE SHORT "Introduction"

@{b}THE STORY...@{ub}

For many years, Valstyx was a peaceful planet in the Universe. Five Magic
Crystals owned by Lady Akiko, the princess of Valstyx, guaranteed the power
and stability of the whole planet.

But one day things changed. Strange beasts and bizarre machines suddenly
invaded the planet. It was being taken over by Lord Khenmir's evil forces.

In a surprisedly attack, the Soldiers were unable to defend the Royal Palace.
And while the chaos involved the kingdom, Lord Khenmir took possession of the
Five Magic Crystals... and kidnapped princess Akiko.

Designed with the very best of Valstyx technology, you, as Kiara McGuire, will
pilot the GUNBEE F-99, a mobile suit developed by the Royal Engineers with the
hope to defeat Lord Khenmir big guardians, to recover the Five Magic Crystals
and succeed in the save of the beautiful Lady Akiko.

Good luck!

@NODE OPTIO "Options Screen"

@{b}THE OPTIONS SCREEN@{ub}

@{b}1.- GAME MODES@{ub}

Press fire button to switch between Honey or Story mode.

@{b}Story Mode@{ub}

All the rules explained in the manual apply to this mode. The main objective
of this mode is to successfully rescue lovely princess Akiko by recovering all
the Five Magic Crystals. The word 'ability' is the main key to survive in this
mode because you will have to pay special attention to hardest rules:

@{b}Honey Mode@{ub}

Almost all the rules explained in this manual applies to this mode with the
following exceptions:

- you begin with 5 Lives and 5 Firebeams
- Kitty-Katransport Clouds not available
- Magic Crystals not available
- KTC items not available (no GB01/P kit, MG AmmoClip and High Firebeam)
- Gunbee F99P Planetary mode not available
- turbulence not available
- High Firebeam always available
- Extra-lives every 100,000 points
- No Extra-lives when 10 Bells are collected into Flying Basket
- Less enemy attack initiative
- Enemy weird shots not available
- Big Guardians shoots slow and less attack modes.

In this mode you can learn the rules of the game, to plan some strategy and to
practice useful tactics for hard situations in the levels. Surviving is easy
because you're provided with more initial lives and a faster way to get extra
lives. The no need to pay attention to KTC items (like the Crystals) and other
rules (like knocking bells into the Baskets) means you can safely fly in
the sky without worrying about all that.

Honey Mode also provides a Level Selection, for training purpose.

@NODE TIPS "Tips & Tricks"

@{b}GUNBEE F99 TIPS@{ub}

- When a level begins, collect inmediatelly useful bells (green and blue)
  to improve your flight performance. The more powerful is the Gunbee F99,
  the less performance is lost if you die.

- Be careful when flying below the Clouds. Slow enemy shots may be there.

- If your shooting rate is slow, then don't shoot quickly. Use paused and
  accurate shoots while you power-up.

- If you die search inmediatelly a Green Bell to try to get back your
  previous shooting rate. Also pay attention for any extra Firebeam supplied.
