@toc "main"

  Requirements:

  An AGA-equipped Amiga. Additional FAST-memory or 030+ CPUs will
  speed up the game. 020 and OS/3.0 are required.

  To play music the game requires the ptreplay.library, which is
  included.  Thanks to Mattias Karlsson for producing it!
  If the game fails to find ptreplay.library no music will be
  played (and loaded, which makes the game run faster).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  PTReplay.library version 4.20 by Mattias Karlsson. © 1994 BetaSoft
  This version is FreeWare. You may use this library, and also copy it
  further, provided that NO CHARGE is claimed. This message must always
  accompany any files in the PTReplay.library that is distributed.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Oh yes, Delete and Copy commands (in SYS:c/) are also required.

  Techical details:

  - Pure assembler code.
  - Uses 64 colours, added one bitplane for lightsource-masks,
    which enables me to use multiple lightsources (Are included in
    the finished game, not visible yet).
  - Smooth gameplay and low memory consumption.
  - Uses inhouse packing routines to lower the storage usage.
  - Nice interface. =D
  - So far I've managed to produce 10000 lines of code for Midnight Hours.
    (That is over 250kb!)
  - On my 5.5 MIPS 030 the game is little too fast, so all you valilla
    A1200 owners should not be having any trouble with this game.

@node "what" "Game information"
@toc "main"

  Game information:

  I'm a fan of Ultima-games. When Ultima 6 arrived, I was horrified
  by the slow and ugly graphics, so I decided to write my 'Ultima'.
  This time it is not slow, it has nice graphics and does not require
  lots of Hd-space. There is only one problem: the work required
  to produce a rpg is huge. So I'm asking you if you like the
  game's engine and if you would like to play the finished Midnight Hours.
  If you like it then feel free to e-mail me and tell me so.
  If you have any suggestions plase tell them to me. I'm all ears.
  I have plenty of programs (four) to code and I would not like to spend the
  next six months coding a game that nobody would like to play.

  So far I've managed to produce graphics and code, but composing music
  is beyond my skills. If some of you have some nice medivedal tunes
  or other groovy tunes you think would suit the game then please e-mail me.
  I also included an iff-picture, which has the game's palette. If you
  think you could draw better images then do so. Uuencode your pictures
  and send them to me.

  In-game keys:

  D     - Drop
  G     - Get
  M     - Move
  R     - Remove
  A     - Apply
  T     - Talk
  E     - Enter
  F     - Fight
  SPACE - Pass a turn
  HELP  - Displays these keys
  ESC   - Quit (Left mouse button does the same.)

  The function keys (F1-F5) have also special effects.

  F1    - Music On/Off
  F2    - Disk operations (Not included/programmed yet)
  F3    - Pause On/Off
  F4    - Scroll off (Text/Status display)
  F5    - Show status

  Pressing Enter in Text/Status/Other view will grant you exit
  from them.

  Other information:

  This game has many bugs and I know every single one of them, so do not
  send me any bug-reports. Currently I am lacking of time (I am a
  high-school student with many things to study), but I'm using
  lots of my freetime to write this game. I hope this game will
  bring back the good old Ultima 5 times, when the story and the atmosphere
  were extremely captivating.

  This is the first computer rpg with dancing characters! =B
  Aren't they cute?

  PS. Oh yes, you can also send me a postcard. =D

  I myself? I'm a humble high school student from Finland and I
  love my Amiga! Feel free to e-mail me. I'm quite lonely and would
  like to receive some (e-)mail from you other Amiga users.
  Oh yes, I'm 17 years old (I was born 11-Aug-77).

  One day I grabbed the JuggleGuide by Mathias Dahl from Aminet
  and I've been juggling since that silly day... Juggling is fun!

  In the summers I like to swim and throw my trusty old frisbee with
  my friends or with my dog. Throwing a frisbee with my dog isn't
  very smart: she likes to eat it a lot. But who cares when the frisbees
  are quite cheap anyway?

  Keep your Amigas running and send me your opinnions on Midnight Hours.
  Cheers!

  When is this game supposed to be finished? Good question. I really
  do not know. First I was sure that the coding would take only
  a couple of months, but I've coded Midnight Hours now over six months
  (I've had some long holidays, kept many days (weeks) off) and still I
  find many things to improve and add. Hopefully it will take no longer
  that three more months. My classmate and friend @{"Joona Palaste" link "jones" 0} is
  trying to speed up the coding by asking almost every day about the
  progress. Greets Jones! I hope that you'll also learn yourself the
  Amiga machine language. It's not so hard you think it is, the learning
  I mean. Just work hard on it. Find lots of spare time and start making
  little example programs.
