    'We' are not in any way responsible for data loss or any other 
faults caused by the use of this program. By using this program, you 
agree that 'we' can't be held responsible for anything done by these
programs ('We' as in Shoah and/or Sublime software).

    As far as I know the LightSpeed programs are stable, and should not

problems with LightSpeed programs then we would like to hear about it
(mail Sublime Software).


How to play this demo quick doc
===============================

    The object of each level is to tag the orb, and kill off the other
walls. To control the walls use either joysticks as;

    Up, Down, Left, Right  :  Point wall in that direction!
                      Fire :  LightSpeed mode (faster)

    In the top left of the display there are three box's that show what
walls are still alive!. In the top right of the display a flashing colour
will show what wall has tagged the orb last. If no flashing colour, the orb
has not been tagged!.
    To continue on to the next level one of the players must have tagged 
the orb and be the last one alive (in two player any of the players must 
tag the orb but not be the last one alive).
    This demo has five of the levels that can be found in the full game!
So if you like this demo then why buy it?
    Other in game controls that you might want to know;
   
    P ... pause game (P again to un-pause!)
    Escape ... Quit game

    To quit back to Dos/WB from the demo then just tap escape key on the 
demo menu screen.

                       ... and remember that only Amigas make it possible.
