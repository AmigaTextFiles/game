Object:
   In this demo, the object is to progress through the caves that
you start out in front of.  You must guide Keith, our hapless hero
through the few rooms, collecting the objects and working out how
to use them.
   The puzzle is similar to one in the actual game, so it should give
you an idea of what to expect!

Control:
   The game is mouse controlled. (Load/Save is disabled.)
   To move Keith, simply click roughly where you want him to go,
and he will try to walk there.  In some places, he will need to be
guided around obstacles, by clicking at several points around them.
As you move the mouse over the game window, certain objects will
register on the screen.  These can be interacted with using the
command panel at the bottom.  Clicking the left mouse button on an
object will make Keith "Walk To" it, and clicking the right mouse button
will make him give a description of it.  (This is the same as choosing
the "Look At" icon - the magnifying glass - and then clicking on the
object of interest.  The other commands, Give, Use, Open, Talk To,
Take, Close, Push and Pull can also be used with any object.  If you
take an object, it will appear in your inventory (bottom right).  Again,
clicking the right button will "Look At" it.  Objects in the inventory
can be used with one another, or an object in the game window.  They
can also be offered to characters that you come across, with "Give".
   The gap between the game window and the command panel shows the current
command and object(s) selected:
   eg.      USE Marrow WITH Marrow Masher
      or,   GIVE Red Banana TO Purple Fish
      or    OPEN Shiny Casket.

Full Game:
   The full game has -
      1. Full Load/Save/Options Screen
      2. Detailed, digitised introduction and ending.
      3. Around 70 hand drawn locations.
      4. Cut screens and animations.
      5. 14 original, atmospheric pieces of music.
      6. Around 5 megabytes of graphics!
      7. Interactive, well written script.
      8. About a year and a half's hard work.

So please, if you like the demo, go out and buy the real thing!
      Hugs and Kisses,
                               Jasper Byrne.   :-)
