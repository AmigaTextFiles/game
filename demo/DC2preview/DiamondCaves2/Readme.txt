=======================================================================
Welcome to the

Diamond Caves II sneak preview v0.8
===================================

This is a preview of the upcoming Diamond Caves II which will be
available in October 1997. This version contains 5 Levels playable
with one or two Players.

You need an Amiga with OS2.0 (or higher)
and 1MB chipmem/ 2MB fastmem (absolute minimum).
a fast processor (68030) is recommended

This program has been tested with Enforcer, Mungwall and Codewatcher
but since it is a betaversion (v0.8), it may still contain some minor
bugs.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The title menu
--------------

starting the game will pop up the title menu with these options:

Name: in the final version you can enter a name to record your
  progress throughout the game. This feature is not available
  in the preview.

Levelgroup: in the final version you will be able to choose between
  several Levelgroups each group containing up to 99 Levels.
  Since the preview only contains one Group with 5 Levels, this
  feature is not available.

Level: Select the Level you want to play. You can only play the
  Levels equal or less than your handicap.

Handicap: Shows the maximum Level you can play and the maximum Level
  available in this Levelgroup. In the final version, every Name has
  its own Handicap for every Levelgroup so you can keep multiple
  player profiles on your Amiga.

Start game: play the current Level

Game options: see "game options" below

Info about DC: display some information about the final version of
  Diamond Caves II.

Exit: Quit the game.


The status line at the bottom of the title menu displays your total
score and all the games you have played so far (and all the games you
have won). In the final version each Name has its own statistic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
game options
------------

in this menu you can change the setup of the game:

Number of players: choose between single player and teamwork mode.

Player1,Player2: choose between Joystick1 (Mouse port), Joystick2
  and Keyboard to control the Player

Screenmode: choose a screenmode. This needs asl.library v38 which
  is included in Kickstart2.1 (or higher). If you select a screenmode
  with a size of 640x400 or more, a better charset will be used for
  the title menu. Read below for information about CyberGfx support.

Audio: Select 'on' if you want sound effects during the game

Animation: This option can be used to speed up gameplay on slow
  Amigas. It tells the game how many frames per second you want
  to have:
    full anim: 48 fps (smooth animation)
  medium anim: 24 fps
     low anim: 12 fps
     anim off:  6 fps (Boulder Dash like)

DBL Fix: Turn this on if you are playing on a DBL-screenmode (AGA only)
  because the AGA chipset can't scroll large overscan screens propperly
  in DBL-mode.

Use: return to the title menu


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CyberGfx support
----------------

Diamond Caves II supports CyberGfx better than the old Diamond Caves 1.
There are two ways the game works on CyberGfx screens:
a) if the playfield is smaller than the visible screen, everything is
   fast and fine
b) if the playfield is bigger than the visible screen, you need a fast
   processor to use screenmodes larger than 320x240.
