Preview #1.
Release date : October 13 2007.



SUPER PUMPKIN BROS Preview numero #1.:
-------------------------------------

The game is called Super Pumpkin Bros.
This is an almost playable early preview of a
plateformer arcade game for Amiga1200 series.
The present level is "infinite" as you can never finish
it. It just made to let you estimate the gameplay.
The aim of the level is to switch all the red modules
to green and collect a predefined appropriate number
of falling hearts. If you let a heart touch the 
ground you will lose a life. If you let an zombie worker
touch you, you will lose a life. If you let a bullet
touch you, you will lose a life, If you play too
much videos game, you will lose your mind (cheasy!).


You will be able to access the next level (in a further 
preview) when you'll manage to switch all modules to 
green and collecting the good amount of falling hearts.


Scenario (silly one?):
---------------------

You are Pedro and Roberto employed in a theater.
The evil forces have invaded you workplace, they 
also have hitjacked your beloved girlfriend.
You must defeat all enemies by burying them under 
tomatoes (yes it is practicable trust me), and must 
set free your friend.
Good luck !
