 Skoolz Out! - Non Playable demo
 -------------------------------
 By Gareth Murfin & David Newton


 This is a non playable demo of a game called Skoolz Out! which is eventually
 going to be a re-make/sequel of the old Spectrum games 'Back to Skool' and
 'Skool Daze'. Anyone who played these Spectrum games will know that it would
 be an amazing thing to bring to the Amiga.

 At this moment in time development on Skoolz Out! has been halted due to the
 fact that we are working on our next release 'The Dead Walk'. We have made
 Skoolz Out! lower priority because it is going to be a freeware release.

 At the moment the executable is non playable, and slightly buggy but it
 should give you a good glimpse of what the game will eventually be like.


 Planned features of Skoolz Out! :

 - 2 player split screen
 - 30 different school kids
 - 20 different teachers
 - Gigantic School
 - School editor (to make your own schools)
 - 20 missions
 - new weapons
 - Authentic skool daze sfx and gfx

 and of course all the old features too!
