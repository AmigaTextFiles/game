1. INTRODUCTION

You have been chosen as manager  of  a  third division team in the new
British League, can  you  rise  to  the  challenge?   Do  you have the
passion and ability to turn a  team  of  slackers into a mighty force?
Will you make  other  teams  weep  at  the  thought  of  visiting your
stadium?

Your new boss, the director  of  the  club,  has given you his orders.
Take the club to the top of the British Premier League, win the FA Cup
and the British League Cup.

In this demo version you can only  play one full season, then the game
will restart.

You have £500,000 at your  disposal.  It  probably isn`t enough to buy
the championship. You`ll have to use tactics and skill to build a team
worthy of the Premier League title. Good luck.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. NEW GAME

When you start a new game you will  be asked to choose a team from the
forty league sides. Once you have  chosen  your team you will be asked
to type in your own name. You don`t have to use your own name, you can
be anyone you want.  You  could  go  for  Bernard  Rooney, a legend in
Greenock, leading  Morton  to  glory  in  the  1977-78  Scottish First
Division, or Alex Ferguson another  Scottish  legend who took Aberdeen
to the top winning numerous  domestic  honours and even European glory
in the early 1980`s.  I  believe  he`s  doing  okay  somewhere down in
England.

Once you have passed that stage,  you  can then select which strip you
want your team to wear. There are ten different strips to choose from.

Clearing that hurdle takes you to the Main Menu.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3. MAIN MENU

how much cash you have. At the bottom, you will see what division your

If you charge to much  the  fans  will  stay  away, costing you money.
Although it is possible to increase  the  price and punish those stay-

probably have a bigger attendance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. MANAGING A TEAM

The first thing you should do  is  have  a  look at your team and then
goto the transfer market. Are there any players you can buy?

Try to avoid buying players from higher divisions. They will only cost
you in the long run by  having  high  wages. Keep looking and you will
probably get a good  player  from  your  own  division at a reasonable
price.

Once you are happy with  the  squad  of  players  you have put them on
training. Each player can train  on  different  skills. Keep an eye on
which training works. Different methods  can work on different players
though.

Also before each game you should have a look at the opponents details.
Try and cancel out their strengths and exploit their weakness. The key
to having a successful team is balance.  There is no point in having a
brilliant attack while your defence  is  total  mince. Same applies if
you have a cast iron defence  and  don`t  lose  too many goals, if you
don`t have good strikers you won`t win many games.

Keeping an eye on your finances  is  a  good  idea.  If you seem to be
losing money try selling a few  players,  if  you have a big squad, to
reduce the wage bill. Experiment with  the ticket prices and see which
prices the punters are willing to pay. Increasing the capacity of your
stadium shouldn`t be  a  priority  until  you  have  reached the first
division as by then you will be almost filling your stadium, depending
on how good your team is. Watch how  much money you lose when you play
away and how much you gain when at  home. If your losing more than you
gain, your in trouble from the boss!

Your attendance at each match depends  on  how well your team is doing
in the league. If your  winning  most  games  your gates will steadily
increase. Should you chance increasing the ticket prices? But, if your
losing a lot of games the  fans  won`t  want to come and watch. Should
you then decrease the price of tickets  in an attempt to woo the fans?
The choice is yours.

If you have been drawn against a good side in the cup, don`t worry too
much. You should make a decent  amount  of  cash from the game even if
you do lose. But, usually teams  play  differently during a cup match.
Is it the romance or excitement the  cup  brings, or the lure of cash?
Whatever, there is a good chance of  beating a better team so get your
tactics right and you won`t go far  wrong.  On the other hand you will
probably get thrashed about 6-0. That won`t please the boss!

Lastly, keep looking for players.  Theres  always room for improvement
and thats a good thing. It improves  the team, you win more games, the
gates go up, you make more money, you buy better players improving the
team  again  etc...  Its  a   vicious  circle  but  highly  enjoyable.
Especially when you thrash your nearest rivals  in a top of the league
clash! Also, it`s a good idea to  have  a few spare players in case of
injury or suspension. I had both  my  keepers injured in the two games
before a cup semi final. Oh, bugger!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

5. END OF SEASON

Once all games have been played  and  trophies  won or lost the season
ends. As this is the demo version, it`s also the end of the game.

The league works on  a  one  up-one  down  basis.  The winners of each
league get promoted, except the winners  of the Premier. The teams who
finish bottom of the league  get  relegated,  except the losers in the
Third Division.

At the  seasons  end,  you  will  be  shown  the  final  league table.
Selecting EXIT will take you to the honours list.

This screen displays the winners of the FA Cup, the League cup and all
the leagues. Also shown are the teams who are relegated.

When the next season begins your  players  ability may be different so
have a look and swing that axe if you must. You never know it may just
be whats needed to bring success back to your club.
