                            Boing! The Game
                          DEMO version  0.30
     Copyright © 1989,1990 by Kevin Kelm and Alternate Realities

        Commercial version 1.0 to be released in March, 1990
                Distributed by Micro Momentum, Inc.


I. STATUS

     Boing! The Game version 0.30 is NOT Public Domain, but is freely
distributable "FreeWare".  This means that you may copy it to your heart's
content quite legally, but that no charges beyond reasonable media and
duliplication costs may be assessed.

II. WHY?

     We felt that we should release this demo version to give folks an idea
what game play is like and to hopefully get people psyched.  This lets us
get you a somewhat-incapacitated version to "Try Before You Buy" as they
say.  Normally, the practice involves "pirating" a copy (so to speak) long
enough to try it, but often that "trial" copy goes into people's personal
libraries and never leaves, even if they DON'T buy the package.  So here you
go.  Live it up!  For demonstration purposes, you have 5 minutes of play
in each game.

III. ABOUT

     Boing! The Game is written in dedication to the first Amiga demo
program, Boing! The Demo.  Remember it?  The big checkered ball bouncing in
stereo, much to the amazement of everyone?  Yah, that one.  Boing! The Demo
was written long ago by three of the original Amiga Gurus: Sam Dicker, Dale
Luck, and =RJ= Mical.  Thanks go to Dale Luck for permission to use the
name, "Boing! The Game".

IV. GAME PLAY

     Game play is very simple, really... normally the controls are no more
complex than those of Pac-Man.  Plug a digital joystick into port 2.  During
the game, STAY AWAY FROM THE FIRE BUTTON!!!  Pressing the fire button will
end your current life.  More on this later.

     To start a game, simply CD to the directory that contains ALL of the
Boing! files, including "Boing!" (the program), "Level0.DAT" (the level
data), and all twelve (12) "*.SND" files.  If even ONE of these is missing,
bad things will happen.  If it's a sound file, you may be playing the game
without sound.  Now type "Boing!DEMO" at the prompt to start the game:

1> Boing!DEMO <return>

     Note that you could also just double-click the game icon from the
WorkBench.

     A requester will pop up in the center of the screen (roughly).  It will
tell you about Boing!'s legal status, where to put the joystick, and the
rather important point that the game WILL "take over" your machine; the only
exit is to reboot.  Therefore, if you are compiling, rendering, or whatever
in the background, you had better either shut down those tasks and save
your work, or click the negative gadget in the reqester.  This will kill the
game and return you to where you started.  (This one's for you, Vic!)  The
primary reason for "taking over" is that because of the Copper Lists in the
game, I never quite figured out how to return the display when done! :-P

     __IF__ you are ready to start, click the left (positive) gadget.  The
requester will go away, and the machine will think for a few seconds to load
in some data.  The next thing you should see is the title screen/scroller.
Read it VERY, Very, very well, over and over, until you are dizzy. :-)

     To start the game, press the FIRE button on your joystick. "One Moment"
should pop up as the machine loads even MORE data.  THe game should then
start up.  When the game is over, either "Game Over" or "Time out...Demo
Complete" will appear.  Press the fire button to return to the title screen.

V. ACTUAL GAME PLAY

     Tentatively, here is the short version of the story:

     Seymour Green is having a very bad time.  He's lost every job he's ever
taken because he daydreams uncontrollably.  This, "Beach Ball Product
Tester", is his last chance to make good.  He is to test every beach ball
that comes off the assembly line by blowing it up. The resulting wooziness
isn't helping him, either.

     Seymour is daydreaming again. Intensely.  In fact, he is trapped in his
nightmarish reverie.  Only you can lead him back to consciousness.

     There are two "critters" in his world:  the good, red-and-white-
checkered Boing! balls, which he is to collect for points, and the evil,
black-and-green-checkered balls, which for some reason not explained by
modern science, are ravenously hungry.  For Seymour.  His only defense is
to find a large needle and poke a bad ball with it, after which the needle
is ruined.  Listed below are the joystick controls:

FIRE   : Kills Seymour.  If he is on the initial screen, the game is
BUTTON : immediately ended.  If he is on another screen, then:
         If he is EXACTLY where he entered the screen, he is returned to the
         initial screen.  If not, he is returned to where he entered that
         screen.  The reason for this is that Seymour can easily get into
         unsolvable trouble, and losing a life is sometimes preferrable to
         losing the whole game.  You shoot-em-up players might have a
         problem with this one!  (it WILL be changed for V1.0).

LEFT   : Moves Seymour left, where possible.  He cannot jump or fall off the
         end of a floor.  I don't want to hear about this, either; it's the
         way the game is defined.

RIGHT  : Moves him right, where possible.  Ditto the above note.

UP     : One of two things.  If he can climb a ladder, he will move up.  If
         not, then he will perform some operation (possibly NONE), depending
         on what he is standing in front of.  See below for more info.

DOWN   : If Seymour can climb down a ladder or slide down a pole, he will
         do so when you press down.  If not, he will "duck" down a bit.
         This can be useful in avoiding evil balls.


     And that's it for control!  Now we will go through the kinds of things
in his world.  They are (very!) roughly drawn below in no particular order:


          = a floor.  Walk on it.


########

  |--|
  |--|    = a ladder.  Climb it.
  |--|
########

   ||
   ||      = a slide-pole.  Slide DOWN it. (only)
   ||
########

          = a telepad.  Press up on the stick and appear
            God-knows-where on another telepad.

#======#

  \       = A floor lever.  Press up to flip it.  Wall rocks will move.
   \
   /\
########

  | |     = a wall switch.  Press up to flip it.  Floors will move.
  |T|

########
  ____
 /****\   = an arch-way.  Press up to EXIT THE WHOLE LEVEL.  This is 
 |****|     considered an achievement;  in V1.0, exiting is how you
 |****|     move to the next level.
########

   O      = a needle.  Press up to grab it.  You can then kill one evil
   |        ball.  If you already carry a needle, it disappears and this
   |        one is picked up.  (one is lost... for good)
########


          = an intermittent flame jet.  Avoid being melted at all costs!

###\/###

     "Connectiveness" is a noteworthy concept here.  If a floor is a pixel
or two from touching a ladder or slide-pole, you can move from one to the
other.  If they are four or more pixels away, it is unreachable from here.

     Also, keep in mind that "Boing! The Game" is a multi-screen affair.
Always test the screen boundaries to see if they connect.

VI. FURTHER RULES

     If you fall through a crumbling floor or a disappearing floor, you will
continue to fall until you:

 A) Land on another floor,
 B) Are killed along the way by something,
 C) Hit the bottom of the screen.  If it is possible to fall into the screen
    below, you will.  If not, you will die.

VII. THE SCORE BAR

     From left to right, the numbers are:

   LEVEL-NUMBER     LIVES-LEFT                           SCORE

VIII. SCORING

     In this version (0.30), there are two ways to score.  They are:

 1) Catch a good Boing! ball  .............. 10 pts.
 2) Pop an evil ball with a needle ......... 25 pts.

     There is a maximum of 575 points possible in the sample level.
