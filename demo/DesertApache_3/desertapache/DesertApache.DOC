                                DESERT APACHE
                       Copyright 1995 by John B. Graham


Im not going to bore you with alot of text reading, or my whole life
story, so Ill get right to it!

Im sure you decompressed the file now or you would not be reading this
(or did someone else decompress it for you) you should have the following
files in the DesertApache directory:

DA000 -
DesertApache
DesertApache.info
DesertApache.doc

For best game play, I recommend your optimize your harddrive then
decompress DesertApache. this will speed up loading time of the game.
Before you optimize your HardDrive, make sure you know what your
doing, and you have your HD backedup! (I've crashed my system doing
this once!)

                           Now on with the SHOW!

                           <*>OPTION SCREEN<*>

Once the game is loaded, you will be presented with a Option Screen.

- Screen Options -

Full-Screen FMV Action,- 1/4 Screen FVM Action -
If you are you a 68000 with no accelerator select the 1/4 screen
as the full-screen option will play to slow! If you are accelerated
selecte Full-Screen FMV Action to start the game.

- Skill Level -

On the Option screen you are also able to select a Skill Level of game
play, from 1 to 3. the higher the skill level the harder the game and
the less AMO, Fuel you will have during play. The default is "1"

When starting the game, you will be briefed on what you need to do to
complete that mission. press fire when ready.

- Apache Response -

This option allows the Apache to react faster  when a enemy is on your
SIX. there are two modes. FAST and SLOW.  FAST is the default, so
when a Enemy is on your SIX and you make your move, the game will
continue to the next Video Clip.  SLOW mode will let the video finish
after you make your move..

- About -

Information about Desert Apache  and how to Register.

- QUIT -

Exits Desert Apache and returns you back to the WorkBench.


                          <*>MAP SELECTING<*>

Now its time for the action. On your screen you will see 5 areas marked
on the map, select a area quickly, when your pointer is over the marked
are, it will turn RED, so press fire! If you take your time selecting
your area, a enemy chopper will HUNT you down!

                         <*>ENEMY ON YOUR SIX!<*>

When a enemy is behind you, a WARNING will flash on the screen, Now its
time to do some flying! As the WARNING appers, you can move in FOUR
directions, UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT. Tap the joystick in eather direction
to turn your Apache, the object here is to OUT-FLY the enemy, so try
not to select the same moves over and over, this will give the enemy
chopper and much better lock on you! This is a DO or DIE! eather you or
the enemy will become scrap metal, so stay ALERT and make your move
quickly!

Once you have out-flyed the enemy, your Apache will fly in behind him
quickly move the pointer and go for a LOCK! when you hear the LOCK tones
press FIRE! note: the enemy knows when you have a lock, so be quick!

                           <*>GROUND ATTACKS<*>

Remember them POWs! here they are, and there waiting on you to save them!
quicky move the pointer on the flashing object, when you hear the TONES
press fire! If you take to long, they will fire back causing MAJOR damage
to your Apache. so take AIM and FIRE! If you miss, you might end up
killing a POW, so watch your AIM!

                           <*>DEATH AND GLORY<*>

Remeber, you only have so much AMO, FUEL, and your Apache can take only
so much DAMAGE! On your game screen you will see 3 Icons on the TOP
RIGHT and two on the LOWER LEFT. The very TOP Icon on the right
of your screen is your DAMAGE to the Apache, the Icon below that is
you AMO, and under that icon is your FUEL. Keep a eye on these! and
dont waste your Shots! If your DAMAGE hits 0 your DEAD! same goes
for FUEL, as for your AMO, yep! you wount die as soon, but your
luck will run out sometime! The ONLY way to reload your AMOS, FUEL, DAMAGE
is to complete the MISSION, Note: the higher the SKILL LEVEL the less
AMO, FUEL you have and less TIME to move!

                              <*>MISSIONS<*>

You MUST complete a MISSION to move on to the next, Each Mission has a NEW
set of obstacles so GOODLUCK!

in the OPTION SCREEN of Desert Apache.

Special Thanks go to Seumas McNally for the extra programming and effort
he help put into this game! mainly the 2x2Zoom code! Seumas, I could
have not done it without you! THANKS! The 2x2zoom code is what allows
us to Display Full-Screen Video Action. This eliminates the HUGE video
files, plus the game will operate on ALOT LESS MEMORY!

I would like to also thank "Video 3 Footage Library" for the uses and
permission of the IN-AIR Apache Video, Also Cola Video Archives for
the fantastic In-Flight footage, and CHAS, AFB for the Apache Documentary
video.
