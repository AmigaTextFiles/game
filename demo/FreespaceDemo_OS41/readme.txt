1. Playing FreeSpace
--------------------

1a.  Pilot Registration

  As you enter the game, you will be required to create a Pilot.  This
  Pilot will store your Demo combat statistics as well as your
  settings for Options, Controls Config, and HUD Config.  You may
  also change your active Pilot in the Barracks screen.

  Multiplayer and Multiplayer Pilots are not available in the demo.

1b. The Flight Deck
  This is essentially the FreeSpace Main Menu.  Press F1 to receive
  a help overlay outlining the different areas.

  In the demo, you may use your mouse to proceed to the Ready Room,
  Barracks, Options Screen, or Exit.  The Tech and Campaign Rooms are
  not available in the demo.

1c. Barracks
  This room allows you to change your currently selected Pilot, and
  to view their combat statistics.  You are also able to change the
  pilot image used by each pilot.

  Viewing Service Medals is not available in the demo.

1d. Options
  This screen allows you to change various global settings used in
  FreeSpace.  Use it to adjust your Sound, Music, and Voice volume
  levels, as well as adjust your Gamma setting.

  NOTE on GAMMA: You cannot change the Gamma setting on the Amiga Version.

  Multi - Multiplayer options are not available in the demo

  Detail - This screen allows you to adjust the various detail
  level settings for FreeSpace.  It is recommended that you use the
  default Preset Level chosen for you at install time.  If you wish
  to change the current setting, use the Preset buttons on the right
  side of the screen.  The Custom button will allow you to modify
  individual settings.

  Controls Config - Here you may configure your controls and key
  bindings to better suit your preferences.  A list of functions
  appears on the left, and their corresponding key/button bindings
  appear on the right.  At the top you'll see four categories
  of game functions.

  To change a binding, simply double-click on the appropriate line,
  and press the new key/button.  If two functions reference the same
  key/button, it will create a conflict.  Pressing Clear Conflict
  will remove the original binding in favor of the new one.

  You're required to resolve all conflicts before leaving the
  Controls Config screen.

  HUD Config - FreeSpace has a highly configurable HUD (Heads-Up
  Display).  This screen allows you to turn individual parts of the
  HUD on and off.  Certain gauges may be set to "popup" mode as well.
  This will cause the gauge to display briefly when its status
  changes, but will otherwise not be shown.


1e. Ready Room
  This door will take you straight to Briefing, and then into the
  missions.  Ship Selection and Weapons Loadout are not available
  in the demo.

  Briefing - This screen gives you an overview of the upcoming
  mission, and delivers your orders.  Each Briefing is arranged
  in stages, which can be navigated using the arrow buttons on
  the bottom of the map display.

  The text for each stage appears at the bottom, and will also
  be read to you by your commanding officer.

  If this is your first time playing FreeSpace, you will begin
  in a training mission.  It is STRONGLY recommended that you
  complete the training mission before proceeding to the combat
  missions.  Training will familiarize you with different parts
  of the HUD display, and the basics of flight and combat.

  NOTE:  Several more training missions are included in the full
  release of FreeSpace.  They provide an easy-to-use way of learning
  basic controls as well as more advanced techniques.

  The last stage in the Briefing will show you your Objectives.
  Primary Objectives are very important to the mission's success.
  If you fail one or more Primary Objectives, you may be forced to
  replay the mission before continuing.  Secondary Objectives are
  less important, but it is always wise to complete them.

  Press Commit to accept your orders and begin the first Training
  mission.  Your instructor will take you through the basics and
  you will then be able to fly your first two combat missions.

2. Gameplay Items
-----------------

2a. Demo Missions
  There are four missions included in this Demo.  Mission one is
  training, and will familiarize you with the basic combat
  controls.  Mission two is an escort mission where you protect
  a damaged cruiser.  Depending on how well you protect that
  cruiser, you will then proceed to one of two additional
  missions.  The main difference being that if you performed
  well, you will be granted use of the Hornet swarm missiles for
  the following mission.

2b. Hornet Missiles
  If you've received permission to use the Hornets, you will
  notice that their target locking behavior is different from
  the MX-50's.  Unlike the heat-seeking MX-50's, the Hornets
  require an "aspect" lock.  To gain aspect lock, arm your
  Hornets and try to keep your target centered in your reticle.
  The Aspect Diamond indicator will chase it around the screen,
  attempting to gain aspect lock.  The more your target jinks
  around, the longer lock will take.  Once you gain lock,
  fire away!

2c. Comm Menu
  Comm Menu - You should familiarize yourself with the Comm
  Menu in the game (default key 'C').  With this menu you can order
  wingmen to attack or protect a target, cover you from enemy fire,
  or leave the battle area.  You may also use the Comm Menu to
  request Rearming/Repairing from a Support ship.

2d. Capital ships
  There are no capital ships in the Demo version of FreeSpace.
  The GTC Orff is a cruiser/frigate level ship,
  measuring about 250 meters in length.  The full release version
  of FreeSpace contains capital-level ships like the Orion and
  the Typhon, measuring 10 times bigger than the Orff!
