@node registration "1a. Pilot Registration"

@{b}1a.  Pilot Registration@{ub}

As you enter the game, you will be required to create a Pilot.  This
Pilot will store your Demo combat statistics as well as your
settings for Options, Controls Config, and HUD Config.  You may
also change your active Pilot in the Barracks screen.

Multiplayer and Multiplayer Pilots are not available in the demo.

@endnode

@node flightdeck "1b. The Flight Deck"

@{b}1b. The Flight Deck@{ub}

This is essentially the FreeSpace Main Menu.  Press F1 to receive
a help overlay outlining the different areas.

In the demo, you may use your mouse to proceed to the Ready Room,
Barracks, Options Screen, or Exit.  The Tech and Campaign Rooms are
not available in the demo.

@endnode

@node barracks "1c. Barracks"

@{b}1c. Barracks@{ub}

This room allows you to change your currently selected Pilot, and
to view their combat statistics.  You are also able to change the
pilot image used by each pilot.

Viewing Service Medals is not available in the demo.

@endnode

@node options "1d. Options"

@{b}1d. Options@{ub}

This screen allows you to change various global settings used in
FreeSpace.  Use it to adjust your Sound, Music, and Voice volume
levels, as well as adjust your Gamma setting.

Multi - Multiplayer options are not available in the demo

Detail - This screen allows you to adjust the various detail
level settings for FreeSpace.  It is recommended that you use the
default Preset Level chosen for you at install time.  If you wish
to change the current setting, use the Preset buttons on the right
side of the screen.  The Custom button will allow you to modify
individual settings.

Controls Config - Here you may configure your controls and key
bindings to better suit your preferences.  A list of functions
appears on the left, and their corresponding key/button bindings
appear on the right.  At the top you'll see four categories
of game functions.

To change a binding, simply double-click on the appropriate line,
and press the new key/button.  If two functions reference the same
key/button, it will create a conflict.  Pressing Clear Conflict
will remove the original binding in favor of the new one.

You're required to resolve all conflicts before leaving the
Controls Config screen.

HUD Config - FreeSpace has a highly configurable HUD (Heads-Up
Display).  This screen allows you to turn individual parts of the
HUD on and off.  Certain gauges may be set to "popup" mode as well.
This will cause the gauge to display briefly when its status
changes, but will otherwise not be shown.

@endnode

@node readyroom "1e. Ready Room"

@{b}1e. Ready Room@{ub}

This door will take you straight to Briefing, and then into the
missions.  Ship Selection and Weapons Loadout are not available
in the demo.

Briefing - This screen gives you an overview of the upcoming
mission, and delivers your orders.  Each Briefing is arranged
in stages, which can be navigated using the arrow buttons on
the bottom of the map display.

The text for each stage appears at the bottom, and will also
be read to you by your commanding officer.

If this is your first time playing FreeSpace, you will begin
in a training mission.  It is STRONGLY recommended that you
complete the training mission before proceeding to the combat
missions.  Training will familiarize you with different parts
of the HUD display, and the basics of flight and combat.

NOTE:  Several more training missions are included in the full
release of FreeSpace.  They provide an easy-to-use way of learning
basic controls as well as more advanced techniques.

The last stage in the Briefing will show you your Objectives.
Primary Objectives are very important to the mission's success.
If you fail one or more Primary Objectives, you may be forced to
replay the mission before continuing.  Secondary Objectives are
less important, but it is always wise to complete them.

Press Commit to accept your orders and begin the first Training
mission.  Your instructor will take you through the basics and
you will then be able to fly your first two combat missions.

@node demo_missions "2a. Demo Missions"

@{b}2a. Demo Missions@{ub}

There are four missions included in this Demo.  Mission one is
training, and will familiarize you with the basic combat
controls.  Mission two is an escort mission where you protect
a damaged cruiser.  Depending on how well you protect that
cruiser, you will then proceed to one of two additional
missions.  The main difference being that if you performed
well, you will be granted use of the Hornet swarm missiles for
the following mission.

@endnode

@node hornet_missiles "2b. Hornet Missiles"

@{b}2b. Hornet Missiles@{ub}

If you've received permission to use the Hornets, you will
notice that their target locking behavior is different from
the MX-50's.  Unlike the heat-seeking MX-50's, the Hornets
require an "aspect" lock.  To gain aspect lock, arm your
Hornets and try to keep your target centered in your reticle.
The Aspect Diamond indicator will chase it around the screen,
attempting to gain aspect lock.  The more your target jinks
around, the longer lock will take.  Once you gain lock,
fire away!

@endnode

@node comm_menu "2c. Comm Menu"

@{b}2c. Comm Menu@{ub}

Comm Menu - You should familiarize yourself with the Comm
Menu in the game (default key 'C').  With this menu you can order
wingmen to attack or protect a target, cover you from enemy fire,
or leave the battle area.  You may also use the Comm Menu to
request Rearming/Repairing from a Support ship.

@endnode

@node capital_ships "2d. Demo Missions"

@{b}2d. Capital Ships@{ub}

There are no capital ships in the Demo version of FreeSpace.
The GTC Orff is a cruiser/frigate level ship,
measuring about 250 meters in length.  The full release version
of FreeSpace contains capital-level ships like the Orion and
the Typhon, measuring 10 times bigger than the Orff!
