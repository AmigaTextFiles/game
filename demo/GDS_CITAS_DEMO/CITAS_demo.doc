CITAS is a utility packaged with the GameSmith Development System which allows
the user to completely build his/her animated graphic objects through the
simple user interface.  Everything from the image level to object-to-object
and object-to-background collision detection can be built using CITAS.  Once
completed, the anim objects work directly in the GameSmith animation system.
No fuss, no muss. :)  You can generate complete source code for your objects
in 'C' or assembler (including all of the controlling structures), or simply
load the objects from disk when your program needs them.  Disk-based objects
are much more flexible in that they can be loaded/unloaded during program
execution.  Your program may also dynamically specify how many objects to
allocate in the resultant object array.

Final output files are encrypted for additional security, and you also
optionally lock them to your serial number.  This way you may distribute your
objects without fear of anyone else using them.

A complete manual is dedicated to CITAS, so much of the system and some
terminology may be a little confusing at first.  For instance, a GDS anim
object is the same thing as a system BOB, a blitter controlled object.  GDS
objects may also be "blitted" using the CPU.  Normal preferences is to buffer
image data in Fast RAM, thus CITAS is limited only by the amount of Fast RAM
in your system in the number of objects it may have loaded at the same time.
Stock 68000 based machines may be too slow with large objects in Fast RAM.  If
this is the case, load them to Chip RAM.  See the keyboard controls listed
below for a brief rundown on how to operate CITAS.

This is the crippled version of CITAS.  It won't let you save your objects
or generate source code for them.  However, you can build anim objects of
your own, or load and play with the ones provided.  Example source code is
also provided for the mech complex.

What is the GameSmith Development System?  Basically, it's a linker library
and a set of utilities that provide all of the low level muscle needed for
commercial quality games.  Now 'C' and assembler programmers don't have to
suffer for lack of inadequate Amiga programming tools.  The modular systems
include animation, sound, display, ILBM picture loader, and many misc.  The
system is completely AGA compatible, and runs on WB 1.3 on up.  No royalties
are required for use of this system.

------------------------  CITAS Keyboard Controls --------------------------

During Normal Display:

+                     (including keypad) move to next anim sequence in memory
-                     (including keypad) move to previous anim sequence in memory
right arrow           move to next image in the sequence (or click on it)
left arrow            move to previous image in the sequence
up arrow              begin animation playback/preview
shift right arrow     shift image one pixel to the right
shift left arrow      shift image one pixel to the left
ctrl right arrow      expand image cell size horizontally
ctrl left arrow       contract image cell size horizontally
ctrl down arrow       expand image cell size vertically
ctrl up arrow         contract image cell size vertically

During Animation Playback:

up arrow              increase playback speed (in vertical blank intervals)
down arrow            decrease playback speed
enter                 stop playback (or click mouse button)
space                 pause playback

During Playback Pause:

right arrow           display next cell in sequence
left arrow            display previous cell in sequence
up arrow              continue normal (automatic) playback
shift arrows          same as while not animating (shift image)
enter                 end playback

While Setting Collision Areas/Points:

right arrow           display next cell in sequence
left arrow            display previous cell in sequence
shift arrows          scroll zoom window by one magnified pixel

I hope you enjoy this demo.  CITAS is the next level in graphic object
creation, as the GDS animation system is the next level in object
manipulation and control.  Together, they provide TRUE OBJECT ORIENTED
HANDLING of animated graphical objects.
