the archive goes unchanged.  This is the unregistered version.	To recieve
the registered version, see below.

----------------------------------About
    Violent Monopoly is a monopoly game that I wrote in C.  It works just
like the normal game execept for a few exceptions:
    o	In the demo version, you can't build houses.
    o	In the demo version, you can't mortgage property.
    o	In the demo version, some cc and chance cards don't work.
    o	In the demo version, only four can play.
    o	There aren't any cool little images for player pieces.
Except this stuff, I think everything else works according to the rules
(I'm probably wrong because I lost the rule book).

----------------------------------Interface
    On the left side of the main screen is where the board is.	The players
are represented by little boxes of 4 diffrent colors, outlined in
black.	On the right side of the screen is the gadget box.  In the
middle of the gadget box is the player indicator.  It shows who's turn
it is.	Under this are the action gadgets.  They can either be clicked
on by the mouse or the first (lower-case) letter of thier names can be
typed.	Here is a discription of what they do:

    Roll	Rolls the dice and moves the player.  If you have
		doubles, you roll again.
    Done	Ends your turn. Only works after you rolled dice.
    Examine	Displays information on selected tile.	Only works in the
		registered version.
    Build House Builds house on selected tile.	Only works in the
		registered version.
    Jail Card	If your in jail and have a 'Get out of jail' card, hit this
		gadget to use it.
    Info	Displays info on the tile your on.
    Money	Displays how much money you have.
    Status	Shows what everybody owns and how much money they have.
    About	Displays product information.
    Quit	I think you can figure this one out.

----------------------------------How to play
    When you start the game, the CyberX logo comes on.	Then the board is
loaded.  All pictures are loaded from disk, you can change them if you feel
the need.  A requester comes up displaying 'about' information.  Note:
don't hit the depth gadget on the requesters, since the main window doesn't
have a depth gadget, you are stuck if you do.  It then opens a window to enter
players names.	To change a name, hit 'Left-Amiga x' to clear the text
gadget and type in the name.  If you only want two players, delete the 3rd
and 4th names with the 'Left-Amiga x' combination.  If you only want three
players, delete the 4th name.  When finished, close the window. The first
player can start off by rolling the dice, the rest is easy as long as you
know how to play monopoly, otherwise borrow the manual from some one else
cause I'm not putting the rules in here.

----------------------------------The neat part
    The unconventional part of this game only really works in the
registered version.  The CC and Chance cards, and all property are
totally changeable.  You can change their title and the effect they
have on the players.  As an example, a party game is sent with the
registered versioin.  I sounds lame but once you see what you can do
with a little imagination, it's pretty cool.

----------------------------------Problems
    There are some problems,  The requesters go behind the main window if
you select the depth gadget, and you can't get them back.  This forces you
to reboot or use a task-remover program.  There isn't much in the way of
sound, although my personal opionion is that it's better to listen to real
music instead of litte beeps and repeditive tunes and take up unneccesary
cpu cycles.  This is a non-AGA version, although I will be releasing an AGA
version as soon as my A1200 arrives (any time now).  Other than this,
you'll have to right me to tell me other problems.

----------------------------------How to register
    The registration fee is $15 in the American dollar.  Cash or
cashiers checks are fine, but no personal checks please.  A letter with
your mailing address would also be appreciated.  A 3.5" disk 880K
formatted with the registered version, plus the AGA version if
available, formatted with FFS will be sent.
