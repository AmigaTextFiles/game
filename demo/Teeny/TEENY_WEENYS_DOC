panel  ,only  the Teeny Weenys that are on the level will be available, the
rest  will  be in suspended animation during that level.  Once a Teen Weeny
is  selected,  if  the Teeny Weeny is on the current visible screen then he
will start to wave at you, if the Teeny Weeny you select is in another part
of  the level, then you will be teleported to his location and then he will
wave  at  you ready for his movements.  The selected Teeny Weeny can now be
moved  about  on the screen simply by clicking the left mosue button on the
place  where you would like him to move to, if his path is blocked, then he
will stop walking and wait for you next instruction.

The  Teeny  Weenys  are  all equipped with built in hover propellers, these
automatically start up when the Teeny Weeny starts to fall.  This of course
means that the Teeny Weenys can safely fall from any height without fear of
harm, on a lot of the levels you will have to exploit this!.
