	Lambda is a project to create a 3D space combat game like X-Wing and
	Wing Commander.


SUPPORT

	Lambda supports AGA, CyberGraphX and Picasso96. In the future audio
	will probably be supported with AHI which also offers a fast DMA mode
	for slow Amigas.


SETTING UP

	Before you can run Lambda, you will need to set it up to suit your
	system. This is done with the program called Setup. It must be located
	in the same directory as the main executable file.

	With Setup you can edit the following preferences:

		Screenmode...

			This gadget brings up a standard screenmode requester
			with which you can choose any mode and screen size you
			wish. Note that the width of the screen will be rounded
			down to a 64 pixel boundary.

		Enable mouse

			This option enables the mouse control. Due to the
			internals of the operating system enabling mouse
			control might slow the game down slightly.

		Elite controls

			This gadget selects whether you want to control roll
			instead of yaw with left/right keys or joystick
			directions.

		Background fog

			Toggles the state of the blue nebula/fog cloud
			background. Enabling the background will slow the game
			down a great deal, but it looks much better than the
			normal a black space.

		Missile trails

			Selects whether to have rockets and missiles leave
			behind a trail of smoke. Enabling missile trails will
			slow the game down slightly.


RUNNING

	After you have saved your settings from the Setup program you
	can run the main executable called "Lambda".
