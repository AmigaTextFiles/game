0.0.3
-----
- Revised the version numbering, now it's <version>.<revision>.<compilation>.
  Advance in <compilation> doesn't necessarily mean any new features, nor
  does it necessarily mean a new release.
- Fixed a bug in screen width alignment

0.0.4
-----
- Added sparkling plasma torpedos.
- Speeded up 3D calculations.

0.0.5
-----
- Added some HUD elements.
- First glimpses of artificial intelligence implemented.

0.0.6
-----
- Reduced size of precalculated sinetable to 8kB (originally 128kB).
- Fixed some major bugs in the 3D code.
- Added a 'Force small screen' flag to the setup program, allowing
  320x200 size screen when using e.g. a 640x480 mode (useful with
  WinUAE's Picasso emulation where 640x480 is the minimum screensize
  on offer)

0.0.7
-----
- Replaced all arctan-functions with a precalculated table.
- Forced Lambda to always use 320x200 screensize.

0.0.8
-----
- Added navpoint markers to HUD and radar.
- Added mission flight paths and a preliminary autopilot.

0.0.9
-----
- Optimized 3D calculations a little bit more.
- Added target selection.

0.0.10
------
- Added an asteroid object.
- Added lens flares from the sun.

0.0.11
------
- Smoothened 3D rotations quite a lot. Should be clearly visible on faster
  machines.
- Fixed a bug in lens flares. Now they are not visible if something is
  blocking the sun.
- Added a big transport ship kind of object for preliminary testing before
  the new engine gets started.

0.1
---
- Created a totally new more advanced and generic 3D engine.
- Added true revision control. Now the build count is automatically bumped
  up everytime Lambda is built. Revision is manually increased in case of
  significant new features.
- Added unguided rockets.

0.2
---
- Redesigned the object handling of the new engine. It now allows bitmap
  objects as children of other objects. They will be used eg. for engine
  lights or flames.

0.3
---
- Added handling of polygonal child objects. They will be used for turrets
  on capital ships.

0.4
---
- Added subpixel accuracy for the main polygon renderer. Other specialized
  polygon renderers still lack that.

0.5
---
- Most polygon renderers now have subpixel accuracy. Only gouraud left...
- Added entity system for controlling ships and turrets.
- Quickly hacked in most of the camera views from previous Lambda.
- Removed engine lights from ships, speeding up the engine.
- Added preliminary AI for laser turrets.

0.6
---
- Added gouraud shaded background fogging.
- Changed the shading table to boast 2 lightsources: one for the sun and the
  other for reflecting the colour of the background fog.
- Replaced bitmapped lights with translucent gouraud.
- Changed the 3D objects to use gouraud shading instead of flat Lambert
  shading.
- Speeded up the engine by changing gamelib to use triple buffering with AGA.

0.7
---
- Added proper texturing support for ships and other objects.
- Added multiple point lightsources.
- Added smoke trails for rockets and missiles.
- Added guided missiles.

0.8
---
- Cleaned up the sources removing unused and unusable parts.
- Fixed some bugs in the gamelib CyberGraphX code.
