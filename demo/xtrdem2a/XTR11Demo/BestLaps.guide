@NODE WHAT "What is it?"

  The Best Laps Utility allows you to view and merge lap times files from
XTremeRacing.  This will allow you to merge your friends lap times with
your own lap times, the best times being the times that are retained.

It also allows you to save lap times out as Ascii text.
  
@ENDNODE


@NODE HOW "How do I do that?"

  There are 4 options, these are:


	@{B}Open:@{UB}  This allows you to load a laptimes file (defaults to
          ".laptimes") and display them in the window.  NOTE:
          if you load another set it will replace the ones
          currently loaded.

	@{B}Merge:@{UB}  This allows you to merge someone elses laptimes file
          with the loaded one, it will add any times that beat
          yours or any track times you do not have.
          To merge times - first open a laptimes files, then select Merge
          to load a second set of times, these will then be merged with
          the first times.  You can then Save these times as a .laptimes
          file, or export them as Ascii text.  You can also Merge these
          merged times again with another set of lap times.

	@{B}Save:@{UB}  Save the times currently displayed.  Saves to the
          XTreme Racing installation drawer as a .laptimes file.
          This is the file that is used in the game. 

	@{B}Ascii:@{UB}  Exports an Ascii text version of your loaded times.
