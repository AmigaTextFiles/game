	This is a nice demo animation as an introduction to Evil's Doom Special
Edition '98 soon available from Titan Computer. It is quite system consuming 
so if it looks too slow try copying it to HD (the framerate is fixed to 
12.5 fps). Be sure to run from this directory so that player can find files.
