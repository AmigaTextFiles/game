FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FIGHTER DUEL PRO

Announcing the release of Fighter Duel Pro, the successor to Fighter Duel,
Corsair vs Zero.  FDPro retains all the breakthrough features of its
predecessor and combines a full selection of aircraft and performance
enhancements to deliver a professional package for the serious aviator.
Included among the 16 Allied and Axis aircraft are the Mustang,
Spitfire  and ME109 and some interesting lesser types such as
the futuristic Japanese J7W Shinden.  An exciting and exclusive new feature
of FDPro is the ability to connect a second computer through the main
flight computer's parallel port (special adapter avail. from Jaeger, $15) that
continually displays the view to the rear of the aircraft.  Now you can
duel an opponent computer through the serial port while watching your six
on the slave- all at 28 frames-per-second on a high resolution, interlaced
display.  Rounding out the FDPro package are a review mode, unrestricted
panorama, multiple bogeys, catapult launches, new land-based scenery,
 rudder-pedal support, and several minor but cool features. 
Release date for FDPro is September 1992 and the list price is $59.95.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

FIGHTER DUEL PRO FLIGHT RECORDER

Announcing the release of Fighter Duel Pro Flight Recorder, the first
interactive motion path generator.  Flight Recorder retains all the
breakthrough features of the Fighter Duel World War II flight simulator
series, while adding the ability to create realistic and complex object
motion paths for use with NewTek's Lightwave 3D software.
One of the most difficult and time consuming aspects of 3D animation is
motion.  FDPro Flight Recorder replaces the tedious method of hand plotting
out flying motion paths with a flight simulator you control.  Flight Recorder
records the flight path of up to three aircraft engaged in maneuvers or
dogfighting.  Positional information has a resolution of 30 frames per second.
Motion paths may then be imported into Lightwave 3D to accurately animate
flying objects, the camera viewpoint, aircraft, spacecraft, or even logos.
You may fly solo against computer controlled opponents or interactively with
another person via modem or null modem cable.

FDPro Flight Recorder also has the ability to simultaneously generate Fighter
Duel Pro Demo Reels that can be used to review your solo flights.

FDPro Flight Recorder runs on any Amiga with 3 or more megs of RAM, Kickstart
1.2 or higher, hard drive recommended. 

Release date for FDPro Flight Recorder is November 1992 and the list price is
$79.95.  FDPro Flight Recorder is available to owners of Fighter Duel or
Fighter Duel Pro by sending Jaeger the original Disk1 and $25(cert. check or
money order, shipping incl.). Jaeger Software, Inc., Direct Sales Dept., 7800
White Cliff Terr., Rockville, MD 20855. 301-948-6862.
