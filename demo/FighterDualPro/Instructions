There are approximately 10 minute long demos on the disk.  You
select either at boot time by clicking on the Demo1 or Demo2 button.  If
you don't do anything in 30 seconds the first demo will run automatically.
To switch demo sets, you must reboot and make your choice.

INSTRUCTIONS:

-METHOD 1. Harddrive with 1.5 megs free RAM:

   Place all files together in one directory. Double click on the
   FighterDuelProDemo icon to start.



-METHOD 2. Floppy:

   Format a disk, name it FDPRODEMO, install it (make it bootable),
   copy all files and the S directory ( and files contained within ) to the
   root level of the disk.

   Make a directory on the disk called SYSTEM.
   Make a directory on the disk called C.
 
   Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3 users must copy the Commodore supplied RUN
   and ENDCLI command to the C directory of the FighterDuelPro demo disk.
   These are located in the C directory of your Workbench Disk.
   Those commands are built-in to 2.0.

   Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3 users should copy the file, FASTMEMFIRST to the
   SYSTEM directory ofthe FighterDuelPro demo disk. 
   This will give the demo better access to Fast ram if your machine has any.
   This is done automatically under Dos 2.0.  


   To run the demo, reboot with the demo floppy in drive Df0:
   The demo should autoboot.
