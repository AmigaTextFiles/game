                    RoboQuest - the Demo Version
                    ============================


This is the sixth version of my new AMOS game, RoboQuest, available on the
InterNet. I've added the following things:
- All the buttons on the top of the editor screen work now. You can load or save
your RoboQuest programs to disk.
- The trigonometric functions have been fixed a little. Previously, using
tangents in radian mode gave unexpected results, this should work right now.
Also, I've added hyperbolic functions (whoever uses them?).
- The data banks have been placed into a separate file, because the program file
is growing too large for comfort. For all you hackers out there: the data has
been encrypted!

For those who haven't seen the first versions, this game features an almost
fully functional BASIC-type programming language, with commands such as:
    PRINT, INPUT, FOR..NEXT, GOTO, GOSUB/RETURN, IF..THEN, and so on.
It uses two types of variables, numeric and string (denoted by a $ sign at
the end). Variable names can consist of alphabetic characters and be up to
62 characters in length. Some variables, like INKEY$, JOY, MAPNAME$ or
TIMER are system variables which can only be read, not written.
  There is a memory bank for your benefit. It is automatically reserved to be
approximately 1/8 of your available memory. It can be used with the POKE command
and the PEEK function, just like in BASIC. Note that you can't POKE or PEEK
outside the bank, whose size is in the system variable MEMSIZE.
  To use the robots, use the MOVE <deltax>,<deltay> command and the TAKE
and DROP commands. The robots will stop moving at pyramids or locks they can't
open. The TAKE or DROP commands pick up and drop any portable objects on the
map. To read message blocks, use the system variable MSG$, which is updated
every time your robot passes a message block. I will explain the commands in
more detail when I have finished the game.
  Also, the game includes music support. You can play ProTracker, MED or AMOS
modules simply by clicking on "Change Music" or using the MUSIC <module$>
command. The modules are recognised automatically.
