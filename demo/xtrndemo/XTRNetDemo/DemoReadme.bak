SO WHATS DIFFERENT IN THE MAIN GAME
-----------------------------------

This demo version only contains a single track and can only be played on 2
players as opposed to up to 8 using the serial mode on the full game, 4
players per machine. This version also does not include the sheep modes.
Finally, you cannot save out best laps or screen options in the demo version.

Apart from that, we have tried not to cut the game down so that you can get 
a good idea what it is like.


Here are some snippets from the manual which should explain one or two things!

REQUIREMENTS


This game requires an AGA Amiga (A1200 or A4000), with at least 2 megs of
Ram.  A hard drive is recommended but is not necessary to play the game.
Users with accelerator boards or extra memory will find that the game will
adjust its options to suit your machine.

If you only have 2 megs of ram we recommend that you do not run this game
from Workbench.

HD Users may copy the files onto their harddrive for extra speed.

WARNING : Certain accelerators interfere with the game's sound and
frequent crashes occur. This is a known problem with old Microbotics
accelerators. If the demo crashes then ensure that the sound is 
turned off using the main menu.

[ this should now have been fixed ]

THE AIM OF THE GAME

Its all fairly obvious, so we will leave it up to you to discover how the weapons
work.

We suggest you redefine the controls since noone ever agrees the best ones! CD32
joypads are fully supported both in this demo and in the full game.


IN-GAME OPTIONS


You can change various options whilst actually playing the game.  Simply
press the 'ESC' key , or the CD32 Play/Pause button, and a menu will appear.
You can then use the joystick or cursor keys to select an option.  Selecting
the top option will take you onto the next menu.

Main Options

RESUME GAME - Return to game. Pressing the 'ESC' key a second time will have 
the same affect

EXIT - Quit the game without finishing

Screen Options 1

CAMERA UP/DOWN - Using this option you may raise or lower your view of the 
track. 
HORIZON UP/DOWN - By adjusting the horizon you can often see much more of the 
track. However, slower machines will be slowed down by over use of this option.
FPS RATE (xx) - The number in brackets is the current frame rate. You may restrict 
the frame rate by clicking on this option. 
SCREEN MODE - This option allows you to switch between the standard "blitter"
screen mode, or the enhanced "C2P" screen mode (machines with Fast mem only)

Screen Options 2

PIXEL WIDTH - You may adjust the pixel width to either 1 or 2. This is not available 
on all screen modes. 
PIXEL HEIGHT - You may also adjust the pixel height to either 1 or 2. Users with 
only 2 megs of ram may find that they can only use 1 pixel height with a smaller 
screen.

Adjusting the pixel details changes the overall detail level of the graphics.

SCREEN WIDTH - You may adjust the screen width if you wish. Smaller widths will 
increase the speed of the game.
SCREEN HEIGHT - You may also adjust the screen height. Again, smaller screen 
heights will mean the game is faster.

Screen Options 3

BACKGROUND ON/OFF - Turning the background off can increase the speed of the 
game substantially
DUST OPTIONS - You may turn the dust off, have it on your car, or on all cars. 
Having it on all cars obviously looks best, but it may slow the game down on slower 
machines.
LAP TIMES - The play area can feel a little cramped if you are on a small screen, so 
you may turn the lap time information off if you wish
DITHERING ON/OFF - On some screen modes the pixels may look a little blocky. By 
turning dithering on the game may look better, especially on a TV.

Camera Options

Just for you we added a camera which you can use to watch your opponents,
usually just before you shoot a homing missile at them.  The camera can be
placed directly on a car or, in tracking mode, the view will come from
various cameras on the track itself.  If the camera is actually on the car
then you may use the Zoom and Rotate functions as well.  One of the most
useful things about the camera is that you may use it as a reverse view.  To
enable this to be set up quickly simply turn the camera on, and press fire
while Zoom or Rotate is selected.  You may need to press Fire a second time.
The method can also be used to reset the camera to its normal position
quickly.

Note: Camera options are not available on 4 player mode.

CAMERA SWITCH - Clicking here will cycle through the available camera modes, or 
turn it off
ROTATE CAMERA - Rotate the camera left or right
ZOOM CAMERA - Zoom the camera towards or away from the car
NEXT/PREV CAR - From here you can select whichever car you want the camera to 
be focusing on


KEYBOARD SHORT-CUTS


F1 - Camera - Focus on previous car
F2 - Camera - Focus on next car
F3 - Switch between No Camera/Fixed Camera/Tracking Camera Modes
F4 - Turn the background On/Off
F5 - Switch between Blitter/C2P Screen Modes
F6 - Change Screen Height
F7 - Car Camera Down
F8 - Car Camera Up
F9 - Horizon Down
F10 - Horizon up

-/+ Change screen width

Del - 1/2 pixel widths
Help - 1/2 pixel heights

Cursor Keys - Rotate/Zoom camera


SO MANY OPTIONS, WHAT DO I DO?


As you can see, by altering various options you can speed up the game, or
increase the detail level and slow the game down.  Since we have written this
game to work well on a huge variety of machines we will simply leave it up to
you to chose the options that suit you best.  A different set of options will
be stored for every possible screen height and combination of players
on-screen.  At first it may take a few minutes to set up, but on the full version
you can save these options and never need touch them again.


SILLTUNNA SOFTWARE?


Who are they? And where did that silly name come from?

We are......

Alex Amsel - 'Specialist Amiga programmer with Attitude', or at least that's
what my business card says.  In reality, I'm a complete nutter Industrial
music freak and also a mad Wolves fan.  In fact, this game was written
beneath a backdrop of managers being sacked, and much Banks' drinking by me
and everyone I know in Wolverhampton.

Richard Whittall - The man with the 'static' fingers - let him near your
electrical equipment at your peril!  Has been know to do large amounts of
graphics, game design and the odd-bit of playtesting - a founder member
(along with Mark Fitt) of the 'Anti-Wolves' club.  Responsible for all the
'gory' bits too!

Mark Fitt - A mad cockney who can't understand our intelligent Midland
accents.  Mind you, we can't understand him either.  Communication is
difficult, but goes something like ' l8er doodz, ttyl m8ey, doughnut
doughnut.' A prize for anyone who can understand this programmer and
part-time musician. He especially loves front-ends.

'Silltunna' is Swedish for 'Barrel for Herrings', or something along those
lines.  And no, you can't ask why!

We are always on the look out for any programmers or artists, especially
people with experience with 3D, and if you have something to show us on the
Amiga or PC then send it to :

All work will be treated in strictest confidence and we virtually guarantee a
reply.  Be warned, we tend to be very honest so don't send any sub standard
work!


Started at the end of July 1995 and finished in December 1995 this must be
one of the quickest games of its type written in recent years.  We have had
almost no days off in that time and so are probably enjoying a holiday in
deepest Birmingham at this very moment.  We hope you enjoy what we have
worked so hard to produce.  

Please don't pirate this game, or we simply won't be able to work on the
Amiga any more.  And besides, we won't send you a Christmas card.  So there.

We would like to thank many people who have aided in completing this game,
but special thanks go to :

Black Magic - And Mark Sibly in particular for allowing us to release this
game under the excellent Black Magic label.  We strongly suggest you go out
and buy Gloom Deluxe, Guardian & Blitz Basic immediately.  What are you
waiting for?!

Ted Bailey - What can we say Ted?  Tester Extraordinaire.  All round
Northerner.

Peter McGavin - The best c2p routines in existance

Juergen Fischer - For proving that c2p doesn't have to be slow on all machines

All our testers : Greebo, Simon Speight, Nigel Critten, Gareth Tickner, Ralph B.

Claire Hill - For keeping Rich sane(ish)
Dominic Bowen - For the excellent Logo Design
Stefan Hauser - keep up the good work
ID Software - In the vain hope that we can do the Amiga Quake conversion

Everyone on comp.sys.amiga.games/misc, and yes, even everyone on IRC !

Also thanks to:
Becci, Phil Darryl, Tara Mawby, Mike & Sandra, Nick Curtis et al, everyone I knew
from Exeter, Anil Reddy, Ash Hogg, Louise & Ali, Louisa, Sally & John, and everyone
involved with Wolves or the Amiga (except for pirates).

and...Finally!...

Special thanks to all our families who helped support us while developing
XTreme.


This is dedicated to the late Frederick Davies, who is dearly missed.
