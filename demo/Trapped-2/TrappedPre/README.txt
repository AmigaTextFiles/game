                           Trapped II - Preview

  This is the first official Preview of Trapped II. Lots of new features
                         have been included, like:

                             polygon Monsters
                              polygon Weapons
                             Shooting options
                         Bigger scalable 3D window
   much faster routines using precasting polygons and active field trees
                             mirrors at walls
                           complex Level system
               new spells, e.g. 6 different shooting spells


 Trapped II will only be available on CD and needs at least 2MB chip, 4MB 
    fast. It will run on every Machine if you have enough memory and at
                              least an 68020.

  For a good gameplay you will need an 68030/50, every extra memory will
  speed up the game, so for best configuration you will need 16MB of Fast
                                   Ram.

This preview may only be copied until this README file is in the archive.
