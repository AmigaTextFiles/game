	Hello!

	We saw that there are many questions about the DEMO of "Evil's Doom", 
so we'll try to answer some of them. If U still have questions email us ONLY
on this address:

			kdranreb@student.math.hr

and NOT at bpecnik@dominis.phy.hr, because the system is unstable there!

	Downloading the DEMO from Aminet:
Download it from /games/role/edm_*.lha. Use only LHA extractor (not LZX) from
shell (cli) - U should get about 3.8 Mbytes of data.

	Instaling the DEMO:

AFTER YOU UNLHA THE DEMO...

VERY IMPORTANT:  >>>> FOR EVERYBODY WHO FAILED TO INSTALL THE DEMO
PROPERLY...  SINCE THE DEMO WAS MADE IN BIG RUSH THERE WAS NO MEMORY CHECK
FOR THE INSTALLER SUPPLIED, SO START INSTALLER WITH AT LEAST 1.2 Mb OF
MEMORY FREE OTHERWISE THE INSTALLER WILL FAIL AND WON'T DEPACK PICTURES AND
CREATE SOME INITIAL SAVEGAME FILES.

Carefully read the readme file!!!!  It is best to start the demo immediately
after booting.  Boot with NO STARTUP-SEQUENCE from early sturtup control
options.  If U have an America amiga both the amiga (from the early startup
control) and the demo in the PAL mode (NOT NTSC)!  Starting of the complete
version (the game itself) is simplier because shell script mounts small RAD:
drive and rebootes, so there should not be any problems.

	Starting the DEMO:
U can start the demo in two ways:
If starting from workbench (no startup-sequence, just loadwb, endcli)
simply click on "Start Saga!" icon. 
if starting from cli (no startup-sequence) type:

	execute "dh1:path/Start Saga!" (where 'dh1:path' is your local 
					path for 'Start Saga!' script)

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO USE QUOTATION MARKS AFTER execute COMMAND!
The execute command is necessary because "Start Saga!" file is a script
and a object module!!!!!!

If your Amiga is in default NTSC mode U can start the DEMO:
From early startup control start in PAL and with no startup-sequence, or 
get from AMINET file 'amigatoNTSC.lha' from utilities/boot, unlha it, and
and start amigatoPAL from cli and then continue with starting the DEMO as
described in this file.
