Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Work on Genetic Species is now in full steam and progressing at an
alarming rate, even as you read this, this demo is now outdated.

First Impressions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have marvelled the incredible intro effects a click of the
LMB will take you to the screen selector window. If you don't have a
graphics card then just click CANCEL.

From within Cybernet you can set your preferences to best suit your
Amiga specifications, such as window size, effects on or off,
multitasking on or off, textures on or off etc.

settings again then simply walk up to one of the many Cybernet monitors
that are in the level and operate it.

WHAT NEXT?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The final version of Genetic Species is planned to be released sometime
this year (1997) on Amiga CD, due to the enormouse size of the title.
What do you mean you don't have a CD? Go get one! Jeeez!

You will also need a minimum of 8Mb Memory. Aaah! Nice to know Amiga titles
are finally demanding similar specs to other format competitors.

1. An accelerator is not necessary but it will certainly improve quality.
2. A Graphics Card is not necessary but once again would improve quality.
3. A Virtual Reality Headset with Motion Track is not necessary but will
   certainly make you look stupid.

GENETIC SPECIES Amiga CD when Published will be available from all good
retailers everywhere around the entire Planet.

If you want your local Amiga shop to pre-order you a copy then tell
them to contact us now.

Or if you prefer you can purchase the title direct from Vulcan's
International Mail Order Company.

You can also keep up to date with Genetic Species progress from our web site
