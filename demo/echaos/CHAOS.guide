@{fg shine}-- GETTING STARTED -----------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     Get the chaosdem.lha (or chaosdem.zip, which is still an LHA file)
     and extract it to any directory on a floppy or hard-drive. Don't
     move any of the files around or the game might stuff up.

     Okay... the full thing looks to be about 800K, or more, so the demo
     would be smaller! Fits on a disk! Hooray :)  Although I'm not sure
     if the full game (or demo for that matter) will fit on a DD disk
     with all the music, so there is a separate .lha file called
     "ec_music.zip" which can be downloaded if you wish to have title
     and finish music. Note that if the music is not present, the game
     will still continue!

     -- I've used "NoCorners!" MOD for the title music, but I don't
        know how to contact the authors for their "okay". I hope it is :)

     The main game file should be able to be run from CLI, but otherwise
     just click on the icon.

     You'll eventually be presented with the title screen.

@Toc "Menu"

@{fg shine}-- THE PLOT ------------------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     Mr. Manix, the psycotic scientist (aren't they all?), has been
     experimenting on innocent people, turning them into @{i}monsters@{ui} to be
     controlled by his computers. Naturally you (Billy) and your twin
     brother (Joel) are the only ones who have the nerve (or the bombs)
     or save the day!

     Narrator: "Upholders of Justice, Truth, and the Planet Earth!"

     Billy:    "Ummmmm.... nah, it's our day off."


     Almost every level contains a number of computer consoles which must
     be destroyed to advance to the next area. If you manage to destroy
     all computers the remaining enslaved monsters (if any) break down
     into blobs which wiggle around the level. Once you have killed five
     of these you gain an extra life! YAHHOOO!

     This makes for a whole new gaming experience all together - you
     start playing the game with the intention of SAVING the badguys,
     not blowing them up! There comes a time when you start saying
     things like: "Oh, darn, I just blew up another one."

@{fg shine}-- KNOWN BUGS ----------------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     Bugs? Eeek. Okay... I admit there's a few, but they aren't terribly
     serious so there is no cause for alarm.

      Often when Player2, using keyboard, presses return to put down a
       bomb, he will come to a stop. You will have to repress what ever
       direction arrow was down when you layed it (If that makes any
       sense...)

      When entering the bonus round, the blobs may jump about a bit,
       ie: onto walls and the like. Give them a moment to recover,
       they've just decomposed into gelatinous material!

      Boulders may flash after they are blown up. This will sometimes
       happen if a badguy was close by. Just a problem with AMOS's
       double buffering (or my programming :D )

      Powerups (if active) will flash... ummmm... no idea... call it
       a special effect.

@{fg shine}-- REQUIREMENTS --------------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     Okay, looks great, needs a 68060 AGA Amiga, right? Wrong!

     explosive CHAOS only needs:
	 An Amiga (even non AGA!)
	 68000, although '020 is @{fg shine}@{b}seriously@{ub}@{fg text} recommended
	 1Mb RAM ! (0.5 Chip/0.5 Fast)
	 Can be run from floppy disk, but hard-drive recommended

         Needs an estimated 800K of disk space (plus a bit more if
          using all music)

@Node "Pass" " Passwords/Codes"
@Toc "Menu"

@{fg shine}-- PASSWORDS / CODES --------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     On the title screen is the @{b}Password@{ub} option.

     Selecting this will present you with the opportunity to enter a
     five digit code. This may be a level password or a code to change
     preferences (since I haven't put a proper menu in).

     Here are some codes present in the full-game:

         01001 - Player One off
         01002 - Player One on

         02001 - Player Two off
         02002 - Player Two on

         03001 - Powerups off
         03002 - Powerups on (note: most of these won't work. They also
                             cause annoying flashing effects)

         040xx - Set Bomb time, where xx is a two digit number.
                 Default is 10, higher is slower, lower is quicker.

                 Resets to 10 every time you leave the game to return
                 to the menu.

         05001 - FPS display off
         05002 - FPS display on - shows frames per second out of 50 max.

@{fg shine}-- FUTURE -------------------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     Well I've got to say that @{b}explosiveCHAOS II@{ub} is a definate
     possibility! There is a tonne of things I've left out of this game
     which really need inclusion...

     So... here's a list of some neat-o nifty cool ideas:

          Proper menu system - access to better prefs.

          THREE players - two joystick + keyboard

          Death matches

          Selectable character appearance - using individual graphics
           files. Would allow almost endless different players

          Replacable sound FX - already possible if you've got AMOS

          Serial linkage

          Different weapons - missile launchers? mines? Yeeee-haw!

          Gore mode - seems to be popular :/

          Collectable items from dead guys

          Better LevelEditor - able to include destination of
                                teleports in level data.

     Any more ideas? How about @{"contacting me" Link "Contact"} ?

@Node "Load" " Extra Levels... I can't wait!"
@Toc "Menu"

@{fg shine}-- EXTRA LEVELS -------------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     From the title screen option @{b}Load...@{ub}, (not available in
     demo)you have the ability to select whole new series of levels!

     Once selected, a requester will appear. This is where you select
     any one of a new collection of levels.

  @{fg shine}To revert to the "in-built" levels, go to Load... and press cancel.@{fg text}

     The new levels must have their names in the format of:
                                                            @{b}nameXX.map@{ub}

     Where @{b}name@{ub} is anything you choose. XX starts at 00 for the first
     level, then to 01, 02, etc. All levels need to end in ".map"

     If there is a gap of two numbers (ie: name03.map then next one is
     name06.map) in the numbering the game will quit to the menu,
     resetting to usual levels.

@{fg shine}-- SPEED --------------------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     Okay. One slight problem with @{b}explosiveCHAOS@{ub} is the speed at
     which it runs. Below are some results:


     @{fg shine}SYSTEM:                    AVERAGE FPS:         MIN FPS:@{fg text}

     A1200 020 10Mb RAM         48/50                22/50

     A500  000 1Mb RAM          23/50                10/50


     Not the greatest, sure, but it's the best I can manage. It also
     sounds worse than it is. On my A1200 it is quite playable.

     If you find you can't run from the bombs fast enough, they can be
     slowed down. Click here for the @{" Codes " Link "Pass"}.

@Toc "Menu"

@{fg shine}-- REGISTRATION  ------------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

     There should be enough good reasons for you to want the full
     version of explosiveCHAOS -- the best part is that it's free.

     BUT --

     For it to be free you need to do one of the things below. Just pick
     one or roll a die and follow the details of the corresponding die
     number (!)


           1 - @{b}SwapWare:@{ub} I will "swap" explosiveCHAOS for a game / util /
               creation you have made. As long as it's not utter crud
               which you made in 3.5 minutes, it will be accepted.

           2 - @{b}Postcard Ware:@{ub} Send a nice postcard to the address given
               on the Contact page, with a reply email address.

           3 - @{b}Best URL Ware:@{ub} Email the BEST web-site you know of (no
               pornos, etc.)

           4 - Same as #1

           5 - Same as #2

           6 - Same as #3

@{fg shine}
     ALTERNATIVELY, I will accept any amount of money (more than $5)
     (AUS$ would be good) for which you will receive a SPECIAL,
     PERSONALISED copy! You just can't beat that!
@{fg text}
     I'm not trying to make it a hassle to get the full game! It should
     be fun! Go on, roll that die! :D
