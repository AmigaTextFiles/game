This is a flyable demo!  It is too large to fit on a single floppy,
therefore it is distributed as a .LHA file that will need to be
decompressed to ram or to a harddisk.

FDPRo2 and it's demo requirments:

- Any Amiga model with Kickstart 1.2 or higher. 
- 2mb of Chip Ram or 2mb of Fast Ram.
  Runs on stock A1200s or A600s with just 2 mb of Chip Ram.
  Increased performance and added features with more ram and or advanced
  processors.
- AGA mode requires an Amiga 1200 or 4000 with a monitor capable of
  displaying DBLNTSC or DBLPAL NOFLICKER screen modes.
- Joystick, digital or analog.


Fighter Duel Pro2 has many features and playmodes.
See the file called NewFeaturesFDP2.

WHAT YOU GET.
With this demo you may fly any aircraft and or try out the new stationary
gunner.  You may fly against two enemy Spitfires in 1 Player Standard
modes. You may select other enemy aircraft to view their specifications,
but you will always actually get Spitfires.

WHAT YOU DON'T GET.
You can't pause while flying, therefore you can't access the in-flight menu
system that normally allows you to switch your aircraft, your enemies
aircraft and their skill levels.  To switch these you will have to reboot
and reselect. You can't save your preferences from the Startup-Interface.
None of our famous 2 player modes are allowed, including the new 2 Seater
 Pilot/Gunner modes and Wingman modes.
