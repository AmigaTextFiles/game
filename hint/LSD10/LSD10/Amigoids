STARTING THE GAME

BEWARE --->>> BE SURE TO ASSIGN AMIGOIDS: to the dir that all the sound and
              Pictures files BEFORE starting the game.

The best way is to copy all the files in the same directory and type in a
Cli "ASSIGN AMIGOIDS: DIRECTORY" without the quotes and where DIRECTORY is
the complet path of where the file where copied.

Example for the first time...

   STEP 1 =    Copy the all the files to DH0:Games except REQ.LIBRARY
   STEP 2 =    Copy the REQ.LIBRARY in your LIBS: directory
   STEP 3 =    Type in a CLI   Assign Amigoids: DH0:Games
   STEP 4 =    Start the game

For all the other time just do STEP 3 and STEP 4 ( Easy no ??? )

The game may be start by Workbench or in the CLI.

    CLI: Type Amigoids      to start the game
         Type Amigoids -r   for REQ.LIBRARY requester to choose PIC

    WB : Just click on the icon!
