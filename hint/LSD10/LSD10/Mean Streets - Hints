                           MEAN STREETS - HINTS

Typed by SIDEWINDER of LSD.


The object of the game is to prevent project 'Overlord' - a satellite which
can control people - from going into operation.
The men behind this are the chiefs of Gideon Enterprises and the Law and
Order party.  To stop the satellite you need to collect the eight passcards
which were issues to the eight scientists involved with the project (one of
them being Carl Linsky).  Be quick though, Carl's wasn't the first death and
it's certainly not going to be the last, so make sure you visit the potential
victims before anything happens to them.

Check out every possible location.  If you miss an object you're in trouble.
Quite simply, it may prevent you from getting any further.

Getting out and meeting people is the only way to gain information and to
progress through the game.  And it's usually a good idea to treat them with
respect.  Don't go in fists flailing.  Be reasonable - it's more productive
and you won't get hurt.  When interrogating somebody try to find connections
between them and other characters.  A great many people in the game are linkd
and these links will need to be exploited to help you get further in the
mystery.

Carl Linsky's daughter may be attractive, but she doesn't know anything about
her father's death.  There are a few key figures who you have to visit.  In
particular, St Gideon, Robert Knott and Big Jim Slade... The other scientists
involved in the project are at risk, try conversing with the ones you find or
searching through their apartments when they're not around.

GENERAL HINTS
When you collect all eight passcards go to the main computer at Gideon
Enterprises (4550).  You'll be captured, but don't worry.  When you're in the
room with the furnace get the mask from the panel and activate the furnace by
remote control.  A robot will enter to stop the furnace, you have to run
through the door before it closes.  You should now be in the computer room.
The passcards and the passwords all have to be entered within a minute so be
quick about it.  Now sit back and watch the end sequence.

HINTS
1)      Keep track of who knows who
2)      Be careful when threatening people, bribing is easier.
3)      Don't worry about the ape, a pole from 8911 will help with the box
        problem.
4)      Big Jim Slade will be shot, so be quick with your questions.
5)      Robert Knott will be shot if you ask him about Gideon Enterprises.
6)      J. St Gideon is the brain and Grffith is the brawn.
7)      Frank Schimming is more than a good friend to Lola Lovetoy.
8)      Finally, for a laugh, play the video tape from 4670 in the VCR at 4605.

Vanessa and Li Chin are only really useful for getting new codes.
If you start running out of cash, you'll have to turn your hand to bounty
hunting.  Keep your head low, and then pop up and fire in bursts.  Advance
slowly at the end of this sequence.  You are most likely to get shot at this
point.
Concentrate at finding the passcards - You have no chance whatsoever of
completing the game if they're not in your possesion.  Follow the solution
carefully to complete the computer section.  It's the toughest part of the
game and requires good reflexes as well as thought.

End.
