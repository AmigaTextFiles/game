@{u}1) Kill David Crane@{uu}

 The first thing to do is pick up your credit card which can be found in 
your wallet, lying on the left hand side of Eden`s desk (bedroom). Leave 
to the right and pick up the red cartridge lying on a crate at the top of 
the room. Examine the microwave and you`ll find a key which you need. 
Next, go throught the door on the right, down the lift and into her 
garage. Pick up the screwdriver lying on the car. Leave her flat 
altogether.

 Go to your own flat, keying in 5106 at your door. Get the knife lying on 
your bed and while you`re at it, pick up a cup. Take the cup to your 
kitchen (south) and use the tap (sink) with the cup to fill it with water. 
Go back to your bedroom. Examine the cartridge of Eden`s with your network 
screen (put the card into the interface, click on the screen etc.). You`ll 
get the code for Sartain Industries (7833 needeed later on). Get the red 
cartridge lying to the left of the keyboard and examine this cartridge in a
similar way. This time log-on with "RYAN", password "BLACKDRAGON". Read the
file "PRIVATE" which will give you your friend, Louis` address.

 Leave your flat and head towards Louis` house. Walk into the lobby and get
mugged. Once the thief goes away, go back into the lobby and head for the 
room to the south. This is Louis` room. Punch in 5238 at the keypad and in 
you go. First of all, walk to the unit on the left hand side (where the 
micronware is). Examine it and you`ll find Louis` pool-hall entrance card. 
Examine the card itself. This will give you the address of the pool-hall. 
Go and have a chat with Louis who`s sitting on the shitter. He`ll tell you 
where to get a gun from. Takeboth of his trainers which are also in the 
toilet. Click on both trainers in the inventory screen with the right 
mousebutton to wear both shoes.

 Leave Louis` flat and head towards Sparky`s bar. Go and talk to the bloke 
sitting at the bar. He`ll tell you where Crane is. Then have a big chat 
with Sparky who`ll give you a loan providing you put your credit-card 
through the scanner on the bar. Once you`ve got the loan, leave the bar and
head towards the pool-hall.

 Enter the pool-hall and talk to the assistant behind the bars. If you moan
on properly he`ll let you use Louis` card to get in to the hall. So place 
your card in the card reader and go inside. Use the lift and when you leave
go and talk to the barman who`ll give you Mr. Silverman`s door code (5222).
Keep walking to the left until you get to his door, punch in the code and 
enter the room. Talk to Silverman and put your credit-card through the 
reader. He`ll give you the gun. Take the gun and leave the pool-hall the 
way you came in.

 Outside, make your way to the Regency Hotel. Walk over to the tart at the 
reception and book a room. She`ll ask you for your credit-card, so stick it
in the scanner and out will pop a brown passcard. Pick it up and go to the
door on the north wall. Press the switch on the control box and go into the
lift. Use the lift control box with the passcard to take you up to your 
floor. Leave the lift, walk to the left and then down towards the 
fire-point at the bottom of the screen. Open the fire-point and get the 
axe. Then go back to the lift. Once inside the lift, use your knife on the 
control box to reveal a green wire. Agian use your knife to cut the wire. 
This will disable the lift. Now, in the top right hand corner of of the 
lift is a handle. Use it. You`ll end up on top of the lift. Walk to the 
lift doors (south) and use your axe to prise the doors open. Now, when you 
see two guards, throw your axe first, then you can use your gun to shoot 
the other guard. Hurry quickly to the left and down in the next room which 
contains a rockery/pond. Just shoot Crane on his bed, never mind the bimbo.
This will take you to The Keepers.

 Have a little chat with The Keepers if you wish. Head down through two 
rooms until you get to the bottom where the purple crystal is. Pick it up. 
Go to the room on your right and use the first door on your right. Once 
inside use the key (which you got from the microwave!?!?) to destroy the 
plinth and return you to your world.

@{u}2) Kill Sterling@{uu}

 Go home and use your network screen to read the newsnet. Read the 
"TVSPECIAL" and you`ll remember how to get to the channel 6 studios. Leave 
your flat and go there. Walk all the way around the building until you come
to a road which has some brown numbered markings on it. Go left here and 
talk to the old bloke behind the desk. After having a nice friendly chat, 
kill him. Go to the c ontrol panel/desk and press some buttons. This will 
allow you access into the building if you walk to the left of the barrier.

 Once inside, walk to the desk. Pick up the leaflet and drop it 
immediately. This should reveal a green passcard on the desk. Take the 
passcard and walk to the room on the left. Use the passcard to get into the
cleaning cupboard (bottom of this room). Walk over to the right of the 
cleaning cupboard and you`ll find a fusebox. Use your screwdriver to open 
it and a brown fuse will fall out. Take the fuse and leave for the room 
where you got the green passcard. This time go to the room on the right. Go
up the screen into the next room and use the ladders in the corner of the 
room.

 Walk to the control box for the crane and open it. Inside is a blown fuse.
Throw it away and replace it with the new brown fuse you got from the 
cupboard. Now activate the controls and squash the poor sod below.

 This time when you visit The Keepers, go down two rooms and to the left, 
taking the first door. Put your key in the plinth and return you to your 
own world.

@{u}3) Kill Sartain@{uu}

 On returning to the real world go back to Eden`s flat. Her door number is 
2865 as you should know. Go upstairs, back into her bedroom (let her get a 
bath in peace) and examine her personal organiser. This is just beneath the
rotating fan. Press the "N" key (on the organiser) 5 times and you`ll get 
the address of Sartain Industries. Leave her flat and head towards Sartain 
Industries. Use the code 7833 at the doorway and in you go. Blow up the 
computer screen with your gun and walk to the left. Walk through the 
opening and closing doors, go up the lift and prepare for a nice welcoming 
comittee.

 Leave the lift and you`ll see a couple of guards. Use your crystal here 
and watch their guts fly all over the place. Go to the room south of here 
and open the case. Get the document inside. Read it. Next go to the room on
your right, up both flights of stairs and onto the roof. Go to the left on 
top of the roof and shoot the plane/craft with your gun.

 Once again you`ll visit The Keepers. This time go south once and take the 
door on you right. Put your key in the plinth and return you to your own
world.

@{u}4) Kill Miss Chapel@{uu}

 As you appear in the card park, go left past the Mini. Grab the wire 
cutters from the back of the truck and leave the car-park by walking 
upwards.

 After reading that document you`ll know where her house is. Go there, 
walk towards the thick wall and climb over. Go south and she`s dead! Pick 
up the blue cartridge while you`re here and leave (climb back over the 
wall and head to the left)

@{u}5) Kill Underwood@{uu}

 Go to the boathouse. At the entrance to the beach, grab the piece of 
railing south of the entrance. Walk to the irght, near the water. In this 
screen you`ll see a junction box under the sand above you. Use the junction
box and you`ll wipe off the sand. Use it again with a piece of railing to 
prise off the covering panel. Now use it again with your cup of water, see 
things go bang and then climb through the hole in the window, to the right.
You`ll see what`s left of Underwood. Kill her and back to The Keepers where
you want to go south two rooms and then left, taking the second door. Put 
your key in the plinth and return you to your world.

@{u}6) Kill Beckett@{uu}

 Go home and examine the blue network card you found at Chapel`s house by 
logging on as Beckett with the password "SEPTIMUS". Read the "BRIEF" file 
and you`ll find out where the old church is. Leave your flat and go to the 
church. Use the wire-cutters on the right hand gate to gain access to the 
church. Proceed throigh the doors and you`ll see a skeleton. Get the hand 
lying next to it (to the right). Keep going soith until you arrive at the 
altar.

 Remove the rubbish on the altar (two candlesticks and a white cloth). Just
pick them up and drop them. On the top of the altar is a hole. Place that 
hand inside that hole. You`ll hear a clunk. Now push the altar to reveal a 
bigger hole. Slide yourself down the hole.

 You`ll find yourself in a tomb. There`s a jar to the left. Examine it and 
take the red ball. Place the red ball into the centre floor tile with the 
three oblique holes. Now you can get the other two by moving the top off 
the tomb. Place them both in the remaining holes and be sure to collect the
rock which is inside the tomb. Go through the open door to the right, 
collect the two rocks in this next room and walk upwards. You`ll find a 
statue. There are two parts of the statue which rotate. Each part contains 
six markings with matching markings on the other part. Start by keeping the
top part still. Press the purple button and listen for a clunk. If you hear
a clunk, you can stop the procedure here. If you don`t hear a clunk rotate 
the bottom piece by one and press the button again. Repeat this until the 
bottom piece has turned six times (the original marking will reappear). Now
turn the top piece by one and repeat the process of rotating the lower part
and pressing the button. Keep doing this until you hear the clunk.

 Once you hear the clunk move down south as far as you can go and then go 
into the rom on your right which will contain a bed. In the upper right 
hand corner of the room hides a rock. Take it. Leave the room, and keep 
going left, picking up any rocks you see on the way. Then go up, picking up
rocks, if any. You`ll see a room with a cart, go left here and get the 
remaning rocks. You should collect 8 rocks in total; load them into the 
cart and give it a push. It will move southwards and create a hole in the 
southern wall, two screens below. Go through the hole and then to your 
left.

 Go south down the steps and you`ll see the priest who`s entering Entropy. 
To the right hand side of this room is a hole. Go down this hole and walk 
to your left, taking you onto a railway platform. Go upwards here, and 
upwards on the next sceen. You`ll see a hole in the wall on the left hand 
side. Go through this hole and there`s Beckett who`ll give you a boring 
lecture. Wait for him to shut up. Once he`s shut his mouth, just LEAVE the 
room as soon as you can. Don`t waste time or you`ll have to listen to his 
crap all over again. If you manage to make it out of the room he`ll get run
over by a train and thats it!

  1. You begin the game in Calypso's cottage, so walk up to the drawer and
     open it. You'll find a pair of scissors. Next, walk over to the fridge
     and pick up the magnet. Leave the house and head towards the village.

  2. Pick up the rope outside the Blacksmith's shop (it's near the barrel)
     and the bell clapper (on the banch near the door).

  3. Walk behind the shop and head for 'The Drunken Druid'. Inside, you'll
     find a box of matches on top of the fruit machine, so pick them up.
     Then walk over to the dwarf and cut off his beard with the scissors.
     Engage the nubile valkyries in conversation and then walk across to
     the adjoining room.

  4. Talk to the wizard's about becoming one yourself. If you're persistent
     they'll send you off on a quest to find a crystall staff. Leave the
     pub, and head off to the left.

  5. Continue walking left past 'The Shoppe'.

  6. Outside the village gates follow the path to the right.

  7. Keep going right.

  8. Offer to help the whingeing Barbarian by pulling the thorn out of his
     foot, and in exchange he'll give you a blocked whistle. Take the road
     going up.

  9. At the juction turn right.

 10. Walk past the owl. It will wake up and call you over for a chat, but
     don't get too involved in a conversation because it talks rubbish!
     The only useful purpose that the owl serves is dropping one of it's
     feathers, so don't forget to pick it up before heading off to the
     right.

 11. Continue walking to the right.

 12. At the five-pointed crossroads, take the first exit to the right
     (going down).

 13. Head on left past the spot where the Barbarian had been crying.

 14. Turn off at the junction, heading down.

 15. Continue walking right, past the fallen white tree.

 16. At the junction turn right and head down.

 17. Continue walking left.

 18. Outside the witch's cottage turn the well handle to raise a bucket
     of water, and pick it up. Back track up the path the way you came
     from. At the junction turn right.

 19. As you walk past the tree stump, the woodworms will start talking to
     you. They will send you on a sub-quest to find some wood. This is one
     of the funniest scenes in the game. Head off to the right.

 20. Continue walking right until you find a path cross a bridge blocked
     by a Troll taking industrial action.

 21. Keep him talking until he notices the whistle round your neck. Offer
     it to him for him to blow it, and watch the look of horror on his
     face as the Barbarian jumps out of nowhere to kick the ungrateful Troll
     into the river. You can now safely cross over the bridge.

 22. At the Y-junction take the upper road and continue right, crossing
     another stone bridge.

 23. Talk to the idiot sitting by the tree. Use the bucket of water from
     the well to soak his beans. Simon will then exit right. Make him go
     back to pick up the beans from the puddle.

 24. Use the map facility to return to where you met the owl. From there
     head right. You'll come to the star-shaped crossroads again. Take the
     path heading towards the top right.

 25. You'll come across an excavation site. Have a word with the
     ostentatious paleontologist digging in the hole. Continue heading up
     the road.

 26. You are now in the centre of the forest. Pick up the stone next to
     the dwarf mine and examine it, as it contains a password. Take the
     first set of steps leading above the mine.

 27. Pick up the piece of paper near the big doors and examine it (it's a
     shopping list). Go back to the entrance of the mine and follow the
     road to the right.

 28. Converse with the miserable wood-cutter until he shows you his metal
     detector. Ask to borrow it.

 29. Use the map to get you over to the crossroads. Once there, take the
     path leading down the right-hand corner.

 30. Join the clapper you took from the Blacksmith's bench with the bell,
     and ring it. The maiden will cast her pony-tail out, Rapunzel-style,
     so use her hair as a rope to climb up the tower.

 31. After the maiden has transformed, pick up the piglet and return to
     the village. Head up the little alleyway next to 'The Shoppe'.

 32. Don't get to involved with the dodgy geezer, as at this stage he's
     of little use to you. Walk past him to the other side.

 33. Pick up the ladder which is leaning against the wall. Walk inside the
     Druid's cottage.

 34. Inside you'll find some cold remedy and a specimen jar. Pick them up.
     Cross over to the left once you leave the cottage.

 35. Use the little piglet to eat its way through the chocolate truffle
     door, and enter.

 36. Pick up the smoke box and hat and go back out.

 37. Walk round to the beehive and use the matches to light the smoke box.
     When activity within the apiary has ceased you can swipe some nice
     wax. Now go back to Calypso's cottage and walk round to the back yard.

 38. Plant the beans taken from the idle idiot who you encountered earlier
     in the magic compost, and pick up the water melon that grows there.
     Go to the pub.

 39. Ask the barman for a drink, and while he stoops down to look for it,
     use the wax to block the tap of the barrel behind the bar. The barman
     will give you a beer voucher as compensation for not having your drink
     in stock. Leave the pub.

 40. Pick up the defective beer barrel left outside by the publican.

 41. Go to the dwarf mine. Put on the beard and go in, giving the password
     you found on the stone outside the mine.

 42. Make as if to walk past the sleeping guard. The accountant sitting at
     the table will wake him. You'll be challenged by the guard, so bribe
     him with the one thing that dwarves have effection for (other than
     snow white!) - beer. He'll take you and the beer barrel down with him
     into the cellar.

 43. Once there, use the owl feather to tickle the snoring dwarf's smelly
     feet. He'll keel over, revealing a key. Pick it up and go back
     upstairs.

 44. Go down the stairs where the guard stopped you. The accountant will
     scream blue murder, but there's nothing he can do to stop you, so you
     can afford a self-righteous smile as you walk past his bemused face.

 45. Unlock the safe door with the key.

 46. Offer the beer voucher to the dwarf inside. He'll reward you with a
     gem before unceremoniously turning you out. Don't forget to pick up
     the hook under the safe door.

 47. Use the map to get to the owl tree. Follow the path going right to the
     five-pointed crossroads, and head straight on, going the way that
     Simon is facing.

 48. You'll come across a noisy busker playing his musical instrument
     rather badly. Launch the water melon at his organ, which will soon
     come into your possession.

 49. Journey to the centre of the forest using your map, and go up the
     stairs on the right.

 50. Go into the cave and follow the stone path. Cross the swamp and walk
     past the statues. When you reach the sleeping giant, use the
     sousaphone to stir him from his deep sleep. He'll unwillingly knock
     down a tree, providing you with an improvised bridge. Get across and
     enter the dragon's cave for an amusing encounter. Return to the
     village.

 51. Walk up the little alley next to 'The Shoppe' and sell your gem to the
     dodgy geezer for twenty gold pieces. Backtrack to the shop when the
     transaction has been completed.

 52. Hand over the shopping list to the shop keeper. Whilst there, you may
     as well buy some white spirit and a hammer, with which you will
     recieve a complimentary free nail (no expense spared, eh?). Venture
     back to the swamp. Walk up to the house and knock on the door.

 53. Unfortunately, you now have to consume the stew - indeed, you'll have
     to eat a second bowl of the vile stuff. When the demented swampling
     serves you with a third bowl, however, empty its maggot-infested
     contents into the specimen jar. The swampling will obsessively try to
     serve you more of its evil concoction, but will mercifully find an
     empty cauldron. It will then head off out of the house with its little
     net to fish some gunge out of the local sewer, no doubt. Take this
     opportunity to reward the swampling's hospitality by snooping around
     its home. Move the wooden chest. Open the trapdoor beneath and climb
     down the ladder.

 54. Hammer the nail on the loose plank, and walk across to Skull Island.
     Pick up the frogsbane and use the map to get to the dragon's cave.

 55. Use the cold remedy on the dragon to help him rest. Cast the hook at
     the boulder on top of the cave's entrance and climb up. Tie the
     magnet to the rope, and lower it down the hole to gain some gold
     coins. Climb down.

 56. Walk to the right behind the cave, and continue until you come across
     some climbing pins with a gap. Forget about them - just jump across
     the icy ledge beneath. You'll eventually come across an old tree.
     Talk to it, then use the white spirit to get rid of the pink splodge
     on its bark. If you speak with the tree again you'll get some nagic
     words from it. Backtrack through the snow to the gargantuan face
     etched into the rock. Pick up the smaller rock scattered nearby. Go
     back inside the dragon's cave and pick up the fire extinguisher. Goto
     the place where the giant is sleeping, and head to the left.

 57. When you reach the statue of the wizard, get out the metal detector
     and find the milrith.

 58. Goto the Blacksmith and place a rock upon his anvil. He'll break it
     up, revealing a fossil within.

 59. Use the map to get to the centre of the forest, and take the left
     footpath to the excavations. Throw the fossil down to the digger.
     When he asks you where you found it, tell him 'Craggy Peaks', and
     he'll accommodate you by providing cheap labour.

 60. Get yourself to Craggy Peaks, where you left the metal detector. Dr.
     Jones has wasted no time on his new excavations. If you examine the
     dirt you'll find the milrith ore. Next, it's time to visit the wood-
     cutter again.

 61. Tell him the good news. He, in turn, will send you to the Blacksmith.

 62. As you did with the rock earlier on, place the milrith on the anvil
     and the Balcksmith will shape it into an axe-head. Take the finished
     product to the wood-cutter.

 63. The wood-cutter will take the axe and leave without shutting the door
     to his house, so why not reward his faith in humanity by breaking in?

 64. Inside his cottage you'll find a climbing pin on the table. Feel free
     to take it. Next, put out the fire with the fire extinguisher. Move
     the hook in the fireplace to go down into the basement.

 65. Help yourself to some mahogany and take it to the starving woodworms.
     They'll jump into your hat. Use your map to get to the crossroads.
     Take the path at the bottom right corner.

 66. Climb up the tower where you rescued the maiden and the pig ealier on.
     Unleash the woodworms onto the floorboards to get you onto ground
     level.

 67. Pick up the wedge securing the entrance door and then use the ladder
     to climb down into the basement.

 68. Open up the sarcophagus. You have to be quick with the next operation
     other wise Simon will get cold feet and run off, leaving you to try
     again. Search out the loose bandage with the mouse pointer, and use
     the 'pick-up' command with it in order to take care of the mummy.
     Pick up the crystal staff and take it to the four wizards with whom
     you spoke in the pub.

 69. The wizards will greedily ask you also to pay a registration fee of
     thirty gold pieces. If you haven't got enough money, then venture
     back to the top of the dragon's cave to fish out some more using the
     magnet. You should end up with forty-one gold pieces altogether.
     Give the wizards their money, and they'll give you a wizard's starter
     pack. Take special note of the allegory with modern-day banking
     institutions.

 70. Use the map to get to the crossroads, and take the little alley
     heading up to the right. When you reach the waterfall, search around
     the bottom left-hand corner where you'll find a vine. Use it to climb
     down.

 71. At the bottom you'll find a Gollum impersonator angling. Swap the
     swamp stew for the fishing rod to find the ring. Goto the village.

 72. The shop-keeper has finished the order, so climb into the cardboard
     box outside the shop.

 73. When you arrive at your destination, open up the box and climb out.
     If you search around the empty boxes you'll find your spell book.
     Inside the book you'll discover a loose piece of paper. Search with
     the mouse pointer between the boxes and the door to find a rat bone.
     Slide the piece of paper underneath the door, then use the rat bone
     to push the key off the lock on the other side so that it will fall
     on the paper. Pull back the piece of paper with the key on it to
     unlock the door. Open it and get out of the stockroom.

 74. Pick up the metal bucket with the hole in it outside the cells, and
     descend down the stairs.

 75. Pick up the mints near the dungeon window. Chat with the Druid who's
     tied up on the rack. After a while he will ignore you and refuse to
     talk any further. Take off the ring of invisibility and resume the
     conversation. He will put you through a test to make sure that you're
     not evil. Pick up the flaming brand next to the sharp objects. Place
     the metal bucket on the Druid's head. Use the flaming brand on the
     bucket to turn the Druid into a frog. Open up the Iron maiden, and
     hide in there for a few days until the frog returns with a hacksaw.
     Use it to cut through the bars so you can escape. Goto the Druid's
     cottage (where you picked up the cold remedy).

 76. The Druid will give you a magic potion in exchange for the frogsbane
     found on Skull Island. Goto the witch's cottage.

 77. Pick up the broom to conjure up the witch. Take up the hag's challenge
     to a duel. Use the words given to you by the talking tree. If you lose
     (the battle is a form of scissors, paper, stone, using spells and
     counter-spells) just keep going back until you win. Take the broom-
     stick as your reward. The witch will metamorphose into a slovenly
     dragon. All you have to do is say 'Abracadabra' to turn yourself into
     a tiny mouse. Make your escape through the mouse-hole along the edge
     of the top wall.

 78. Climb up the snowy mountains until you reach the ferocious snowman.
     Use the extra-strong mints to melt him to oblivion. Continue your
     upward climb.

 79. When you reach the castle, use the broomstick to get to the door.
     Drink up the Druid's potion and you'll shrink small enough to creep
     in through the bottom.

 80. Pick up the leafin the garden. Walk inside the rusty old bucket. If
     you look around you'll find a match, and outside, near the bucket,
     you'll also find a stone. Carry on walking left.

 81. Use the dog hair to lasso onto the tap, then pick up the leaf floating
     on the pond and bring it ashore. Use the matchstick as a mast and the
     other leaf as a sail to make an improvised boat. Pick up some seeds
     from the red pots next to the tap and bring them back. Use the stone
     to pulp the seeds into an oil which you can use to lubricate the
     jammed tap. Pull the hair to open the pub, and get on the boat to
     cross the nowirrigated puddle.

 82. You'll be confronted by a large frog on your arrival. Look in the
     water, however, and you'll find a little tadpole. Pick it up and use
     it as a hostage to negotiate peace terms with the amphibian menace.
     When the frog flees you'll find some yellow mushrooms. Eat one to
     return to your normal size.

 83. Pick a branch off the tree and open the door. The wooden chest inside
     will spring to life and chase you out. Go back and use the branch to
     jam its lethal jaws. Pick up the spear from the rack and the shield
     from by the stairs. Go on up.

 84. Pick up the magic wand on the dresser, the green sack next to the bed,
     the blue money-pouch on the bed and the book on the pink pillow at the
     right. Read the book. Speak to the mirror, then go upstairs to the
     second floor.

 85. Pick up the chemicals on the bench in the middle of the lab, then walk
     round to the bookcase and pick up Sordid's spell book. Use the
     chemicals to renew the shine on the shield, and hang the shield on the
     hook protruding from the front of the bench. See what bits of inform-
     -ation you can extract from the lower-class demons, and go down the
     stairs.

 86. Talk the mirror into spying on the demons upstairs for you so that you
     can find out their real names. Go downstairs all the way to the
     dungeon in the basement.

 87. Using the spear, knock off the skull hanging ceiling and pick it up
     from the floor. Walk over to the other side of the dungeon and pick up
     the chest. Return and pull the lever on the crushing machine next to
     the footbridge. Place the chest on the block and push the lever. Pull
     the lever to raise the block up again. You'll find the candles you
     need for your demonic incantation amongst the ruins. Go upstairs to
     the bedroom with the mirror.

 88. Look down at the side of the staircase to find a small mouse-hole.
     Put the cheesy green sock inside the blue pouch, and use it to coax
     the mouse out of its dwelling, and consequently entrapping it. Go
     upstairs for a chat with the demons.

 89. If you help the demons return to their dimension, they will assist
     you with the teleporter. They will give you the chalk with which to
     draw the square on the floor. When you've exorcised them, walk over
     to the teleporter and use it to get to the 'Fiery Pits of Rondor'.

 90. When you materialize, search around with the mouse pointer until you
     find a pebble nearby. Pick it up. To your left is a small sapling.
     Pick it up. Talk to the attendant and he'll give you some brochures.
     Look at the brochures to find an elastic band. Use the band together
     with the sapling to create a catapult. Fire the pebble at the red bell
     to get rid of the pesky attendant. Pick up the souvenir matches at the
     corner of the stall and head for the pits.

 91. Cross the bridge, picking up the bucket of floor wax, and head for the
     fiery pits.

 92. Use the magic wand on Sordid to let him taste some of his own
     medicine. Light up the fiery pits with the matches. Cast the wand
     into the flames to return the statues to life. Sordid will attack you,
     but you'll survive, so go back and use the floor wax on him. If you
     don't succeed, try again until he falls over, then kick him into the
     pit.

@TOC "MAIN"

               A classic game from  S I E R R A

             POLICE QUEST II  ---  The Vegeance

                    Walkthru solve by V&D

      The  adventure begins when you, detective Sonny Bonds,
are getting to work at Lytton Police Station.
      First,  yuo have to GET KEYS from ignition.  Now  OPEN
COMPARTMENT  and  GET LPD BUSINESS CARD. You  will  need  it
later.  Ok,  in  order to leave a car press F4.  Go  to  the
Police Station and UNLOCK DOOR. As you are homicide officer,
go to the Homicide Office.
      SIT  on  a  spare  stool and LOOK  BASKET.  There  you
discover  subpoena.  UNLOCK  DRAWER,  GET  LETTER  and  READ
LETTER. GET WALLET (you can OPEN WALLET if you like  to  see
what`s  inside). C`ause drawer is now empty you  will  CLOSE
DRAWER.   STAND  and  look  around.  There  is   one   quite
interesting paper on captain Hall`s desk, so go near it  and
LOOK  PAPERS. You can see some words - write them down, they
are  passwords  to computer data bank. LOOK BULLETIN  BOARDS
near window and you will see that your shooting scores ain`t
too  good.  Don`t  worry,  you fix  that  pretty  soon.  USE
COMPUTER and TURN COMPUTER ON. You can use it as a primitive
dos   based   system  -  commands  like  DIR  and   CD   are
available.Feel free to dig around in data banks, but be sure
to   scan  following  topics  :  Personnel\Pratt_Lloyd   and
Personnel\Haines_Calvin. When you`ve had your fill  of  this
computer type QUIT to end computer session.
     Go to the Narcotics office and SPEAK TO LLOYD PRATT. He
has a drug-problem. ASK ABOUT DRUGS and you have saved Pratt
from his drug problem. Good work !
      You  must be thinking by now "what about that shooting
stuff ?". Be patient, we are coming to it. First you have to
get  some equipment. Go to the Locker room. In order to  get
your  locker code LOOK BACK OF THE LPD CARD. Now  find  your
locker   and  OPEN  LOCKER. GET YOUR GUN  from  locker.  You
must`nt  forget ammo, so TAKE AMMO CLIPS and TAKE HANDCUFFS.
CLOSE  LOCKER.  What are you waiting for, let`s  go  to  the
shooting range !
     GIVE GUN TO WEAPON OFFICER for quick trigger check. GET
EAR PROTECTORS from Mills and go to the free booth.
      This  seems to be a good time to give some tips  about
weapon usage.
     F6  - load gun
     F8  - Draw / Holster gun
     F10 - Shoot
   To leave a booth, simply type LEAVE RANGE. When in booth,
you  have  to operate buttons, change targets, and  do  some
other  things.  Before doing anything else, (this  will  not
apply to shooting, of course), holster your weapon.
      Ok, let`s get on with shooting. USE EAR PROTECTORS  to
pervent  permanent damage to your hearing system.  Now  load
your  gun  with F6 and draw it with F8. Get a good  aim  and
shoot.  Only one shot at a time will suffice. Lower gun  and
PRESS  VIEW BUTTON. LOOK TARGET. You will see that gun ain`t
properly  sighted.  ADJUST SIGHT.  There  is  two  screws  -
elevation  and  windage. Adjust them (with arrow  keys)  and
CHANGE  TARGET.  PRESS BACK BUTTON and shoot  again.  Repeat
this,  until you got gun properly sigted. If you should  run
out  of ammo, go see Mills and GET AMMO. Don`t forget to USE
EAR PROTECTORS when you re-enter to the booth.
      When  you`re all done, exhaust current ammo clip  into
target. Go back to the Mills and GIVE EAR PROTECTORS to him.
You also should GET AMMO - you newer know, when you may need
some.      Go  again to Homicide office, where captain  Hall
announces that Jessie Bains has escaped and assigns  you  to
this  case. OPEN CABINET and GET BAINS FILE. You notice that
there  is two photos of that bastard, so GET MUG SHOT. CLOSE
FILE  and  CLOSE CABINET. TAKE CAR KEYS from rack  near  the
window.    Go  to the hall and right behind a counter.  OPEN
THE  BIN and TAKE FIELD KIT. CLOSE BIN. Now is time  to  hit
the  streets ! On the parking lot you find blue sedan.  OPEN
TRUNK and PUT KIT IN TRUNK. CLOSE TRUNK. UNLOCK CAR DOOR and
go in car. Keith will follow shortly.   DRIVE TO JAIL
     There you see some little lockers. OPEN LOCKER, PUT GUN
IN  LOCKER  and  CLOSE  LOCKER. PRESS  BUZZER.  When  jailer
answers, SHOW ID and walk straight in. GET PATE FILE to  see
about  kidnapped jailer. CLOSE FILE. GET BAINS FILE. IN  the
Bains  file  is  up-to-date photo of Jessie Bains.  GET  MUG
SHOT.  CLOSE FILE. ASK ABOUT ESCAPE and go to the next room.
Witness  Saxton appears and asks, if you will help him  out.
Answer  him as you like, he won`t take you seriously anyway.
ASK  ABOUT ESCAPE to get more information. Leave jail,  OPEN
LOCKER and GET GUN. Sit in car and Keith will ran for it.
      RADIO  your findings and DRIVE TO STATION. Before  you
reach  station, radio will interrupt and say,  that  jailers
car  has been found. DRIVE TO OAK TREE MALL to check  things
out.
      OPEN  TRUNK and GET FIELD KIT. Jailer`s car is a  blue
one. OPEN CAR DOOR. OPEN CLOVE BOX. GET HOLSTER,LOOK BULLETS
and  LOOK REGISTRATION.   LEAVE CAR. Big Lady will come  up.
ASK  ABOUT CAR to get a description of a stolen car. PUT KIT
IN TRUNK, CLOSE TRUNK and jump in a sedan.
      RADIO  information  about gun and a  car  description.
DRIVE  TO STATION.  And again you`ll be interrupted  by  car
radio. DRIVE TO COTTON COVE. Keith will stake about jogger`s
sex and you can accept or reject.
      Go  to  the girl and SPEAK WITH GIRL. ASK ABOUT BLOOD.
Well, we have to check that bloody thing out, so draw a  gun
and  strode to the left. When Bains arrives, just shoot him.
You  missed him ??? Don`t worry he runs away. Stay far  from
the  street or you `ll be dead as a rock. Find a  trash  can
and  MOVE  TRASH, GET CLOTHES and READ NAMETAG. Walk  around
and  LOOK  DOWN until you find blood. Go back to  your  car,
OPEN  TRUNK  and GET FIELD KIT. Walk to the blood.  USE  EYE
DROPPER ON BLOOD and USE PLASTER. Now you can relax and wait
for  diving team to arrive. Ask officer Moore to FIND  BODY.
He  will demand your diver certificate. In order to get that
SEARCH  YOUR WALLET. He (officer Moore) will ask you to  get
what equipment you need. GET WET SUIT, GET WEIGHT BELT,  GET
VEST, TAKE SCUBA MASK, GRAB FINS. Now you should GET TANK 1,
CHECK  AIR  and PUT TANK BACK. Keep on it with various  tank
numbers `till you get one with most air. LEAVE.
      Under water swim above any interesting object and LOOK
DOWN.  Watch  out  for  golden thing (GET  GOLD)  and  light
reflecting object (GET OBJECT). When you`ve had quite enough
of  swimming just SURFACE. Follow Moore to body and  express
your   emotions  (YES  or  NO).  USE  CAMERA  to  get  scene
documented. Back to the car you go, OPEN TRUNK, PUT  KIT  IN
TRUNK, CLOSE TRUNK and hit the road.
      RADIO  new  findings. DRIVE TO STATION.  And  yes,  it
happens again. Bloody dispatch tells you to go to the Lytton
Airport. DRIVE TO AIRPORT.
      OPEN  TRUNK, GET FIELD KIT. LOOK CAR until you find  a
car, that match the stolen car. OPEN CAR DOOR. Use powder to
take  a fingerprint from rear view mirror. LEAVE CAR. Go  to
the airport. PRESS BUTTON to cross street safely. One flashy
girl will offer flowers. BUY ROSE or BUY PLANT, whatever you
like.
      Go  to  the  men`s room. OPEN STALL and get  in.  LOOK
TOILET  and OPEN TOILET. LOOK TOILET. LEAVE. Repeat this  on
every  stall  until  you  find something  interesting.  TAKE
REVOLVER and LEAVE. SHOW ID and SHOW PHOTO to everybody  and
find  a  person who recognizes it. GET PASSENGER  LIST  from
ticket  agent.  Don`t  get  too exited  about  that  houston
business `cause this is only a camouflage. Go to the  "Siva"
car  rental  agency.  No, not to the "Top  Hat",  "Siva"  is
situated  behind to the corner. SHOW ID and SHOW PHOTO.  GET
LIST to get car description. Now you can get back to the car
and  don`t forgett to PRESS BUTTON. PUT KIT IN TRUNK,  CLOSE
TRUNK  and  enter  car. RADIO GUN and RADIO  CAR.  DRIVE  TO
STATION. And at last you arrive there. OPEN DOOR.
      Go  to the Big John and BOOK EVIDENCE. At last you can
relax. Go to the Homicide office and SIT to your chair. LOOK
BASKET  to  discover a note. USE PHONE  and  dial  0  for  a
information service. Specify LYTTON and MARIE WILKANS to get
Marie`s  number. Dial her up and say HELLO. When  she  calls
you  to  date say YES and hang up. STAND UP and go  to  your
personal  car.  DRIVE TO ARNIE.     SIT and relax. SPEAK  TO
MARIE.  Waiter will come and offer some food. Order  LOBSTER
or  something. GIVE FLOWER TO MARIE. When food arrives  just
EAT  FOOD. Now comes the fun part. KISS MARIE several  times
and everything will be ok ...

                 The  Very Next Day

      You  are back from Marie`s and ready for a good  day`s
job. GRAB KEYS and leave a car. Straight to the station  and
OPEN DOOR. Go to your favorite Homicide office. GET UNMARKED
KEYS  and  walk to the blue sedan. UNLOCK CAR DOOR and  jump
in.
      DRIVE  TO  WAREHOUSE to investigate the victim.  Keith
finds  a  safe hole as always, but you have to do the  dirty
work.  OPEN  TRUNK, GET FIELD KIT. Wander to the green  car.
USE  EYE DROPPER ON BLOOD. Collect your guts and LOOK TRUNK.
LOOK  FACE for positive identification, GET ENVELOPE CORNER.
LOOK ENVELOPE CORNER. LEAVE. When coroner arrives ask him to
REMOVE BODY. After some action sequences LOOK (again) TRUNK.
GET  NOTE  from an old friend and LEAVE. Assure  Mario  with
firm  YES, PUT FIELD KIT IN TRUNK and CLOSE TRUNK. Go inside
of your sedan.
      DRIVE  TO 753 THIRD STREET - it happens to be a rather
nice inn.
      SHOW  PHOTO TO MAN and SHOW ID. Land in car but  don`t
drive. USE RADIO instead. CALL BACKUPS `cause Bains might be
very  dangerous. Jump out, GET WARRANT and SHOW  WARRAND  TO
MAN (select right man). GET ROOM KEY. SPEAK TO CHUCK (backup
team  leader)  and save the game. Position yourself  smartly
and  USE  DOOR KEY. Wait `till the gas pours out and  boldly
enter to room.
      OPEN  DRAWER, GET ENVELOPE and READ LETTER. LOOK UNDER
BED  and  GRAB  LIPSTICK - oh no, this rat  may  be  fooling
around  with  Marie  !  Go to the bathroom  LOOK  SINK,  GET
BUSINESS  CARD  and  READ  CARD. Write  down  Colby`s  phone
number. That`s all there is to do so travel back to your car
and move on.
     DRIVE TO MARIE to sort things out.
     GET NOTE FROM DOOR and READ NOTE. Isn`t that a relief !
UNLOCK  DOOR, LOOK ASHTRAY, GET PAPER. LOOK NOTE  (Closely).
Speed back to your car.
     DRIVE TO STATION.
      OPEN  DOOR and strode to the Homicide office.  Captain
Hall  will interrogate you. GIVE CARD to Hall. Go  and  BOOK
EVIDENCE,  don`t  count on him. Afterwards go  see  Burglary
dudes.  ASK ABOUT SHOTGUN. While you`re visiting old friends
go  to the narcotics, too. OPEN CABINET and LOOK COLBY FILE.
Wow  !  Now you have Colby`s exact coordinates. CLOSE  FILE,
CLOSE  DRAWER.  Move to the Homicide office and  SIT  again.
LOOK  BASKET.  USE  PHONE. Call to Colby, using  number  you
found  on  Colby`s business card. Say HELLO and WARN  COLBY.
When he hangs up STAND and go to the shooting range. Resight
your gun to be sure.
     DRIVE TO AIRPORT
      PRESS  BUTTON  and  cross the street.  BUY  TICKET  TO
STEELTON. Keith makes some phonecalls and you can again  BUY
TICKET TO STEELTON. USE PHONE, dial 0 and ask about STEELTON
and POLICE. Dial them up. Say HELLO and WARN COLBY. Hang up.
Head  to the left and up the elevator.   If you want to have
some  fun, SPEAK TO GIRL. Go to the guard (do not enter  the
gate).  SHOW  ID. If you`re interested in some  sales  pitch
TALK  LARRY several times. Walk to the plane. Goodbye Lytton
!
      In  plane find your seat, SIT and FASTEN SEATBELT.  As
the  plain  levels off stewardess offers some  drinks.  Have
COFFEE  or something else but i would`nt recommend  drinking
stuff  with alcohol right now. UNFASTEN SEATBELT.  Sit  back
and relax until few orientals will come along. Load your gun
and wait. Soon stewardess will faint under nervous pressure.
Now  is your chance ! Shoot all hijackers. SEARCH MASKED MAN
TURBAN and SEARCH MASKED MAN POCKETS. Go to the bathroom and
OPEN  PAPER  DISPENSER. You have discovered something  !  In
order  to disarm it READ BOMB INSTRUCTIONS. All you`ll  have
to  do is to cut & connect wires in reverse order. Don`t pay
any  attention  to  battery and timer stuff.  After  blowing
yourself several times to the Kingdom Come you`ll be able to
disarm  bomb. LEAVE. Go back to fellow passengers.  Now  the
game  will  take  over so watch cool ride  to  the  Steelton
Police.
      GET  RADIOS  from table and drive to the  park.  Keith
parts as always. Walk around until one punk will bother you.
USE  RADIO.  READ MIRANDA RIGHTS. SPEAK MUGGER.  When  Keith
takes him away find a manhole cover. OPEN COVER. CLIMB IN.

  the switch on the left of the arena. Use a bomb to destroy the damaged
 wall. Collect the bonus items, especially the kings key. Go back and take
   the right exit back to the guard room. Once there take the top exit.

You will see the gatekeeper on the right, (the green transparent creature).
Take the transporter to the top. Go to the right, step on the pressure pad
 and return. Use a bomb to kill the 2 guards protecting the gatekeeper as
they're very tough. Take the transporter into the gatekeepers room. Talk to
 Naga the gatekeeper and give him the kings ring. You can now take the top
 exit. Get through the random maze following the same procedure as usual.

 There is a combination switch here. Push the 2nd and 4th switches and the
 wall below will vanish. Take the one-way path and leave by the left exit.
Get the key and open the iron gate. Walk to the far left. A guard will now
be activated. As you can't reach the pressure pad above, you must make the
   guard step on it for you. Move right and the guard will come down the
one-way path. Move back left and he will step on the pressure pad. Quickly
             walk through the mirror and take the bottom exit.

  the damaged wall. Push the 2 boulders on to the pressure buttons on the
    floor. Push the other boulder into the pit above. Push one of the 2
boulders here on to the pressure plate at the top and return. There should
now be a mirror at the bottom left of the arena. Walk through it. Open the
   wall with the picture on it, (if it doesn't open you probably haven't
       destroyed all the mirrored spheres). Leave by the left exit.

    Go to the top and push the 3rd switch. Walk down left and take the
transporter. Stop the lava coming out of the minotaur's head by pushing the
stopper you have into its mouth. The lava will solidify. Walk down and push

   right of the arena. Walk up and take the transporter. Step on all the
pressure pads. You can now go into the room with the flying arrows. Destroy

                         and take the bottom exit.

   Make your way to the left destroying all the creatures. Step on the 2
  pressure pads on the top left of the arena. Go back and take the right
exit. Destroy all the homing domes and collect the keys they leave behind.
 Leave via the right exit. Step on the first pressure pad you come across,
  twice. In this room with the rolling boulders, step on all the pressure
   pads except for the middle one. Go down and to the left. There are 2
 pressure pads here. Step on both of them. You should now be able to reach
                              the right exit.

 Push the boulder out of the way to reveal a key hole. Open all the doors.
 Go to the bottom and destroy the 2 damaged walls with bombs. Push one of
   the boulders on to the transporter. It will be transported to the one
  above. Push the boulder again to the right on the transporter there. Go
   back and take the transporter on the far left of the arena. Push the
 boulder 1 down, 1 right, and down into the pit. Repeat the same procedure
   with the boulder movement to get the other boulder on to the pressure
                                  plate.

Walk through the mirror at the lower right of the arena and take the bottom
exit. You have now finished level 2. Don't get a big head, there's still a
                              long way to go!

 they're your only chance of survival. Take each transporter in turn going
 counter clockwise stepping on each pressure pad as you go. Then take the
                   transports to reach the bottom exit.

  able to be opened. Push the statues on the left first so you don't trap
 yourself. In the bottom left room are 4 switches. Push a statue on to the
bottom switch first, then the right switch, then another statue on the left
 switch and another on the top switch. Push the last moveable stone statue
 on the floor switch near the transporter. You should now be able to open

 Enter Base of CASTALIA (q.u.i.e.t.l.y.) and travel to the Research room. 
Download information which tells of the research about metamorphing the 
Tekite shape to the Commander shape through the programming of the Transport 
Computer. Go to the storage room next door and search room and locate the 
program instruction chip. This room has a Kapone at a cabinet. If there 
is not too much delay the Kapone will not turn and notice you. If observed 
you must destroy that Kapone before leaving that section of the base.

 Continue to search Section one of the base and you will locate a Credit 
Card on a dead colonist, an amunition clip and an autofire weapon 
enchancment. Another room will contain some colonists. Lead the colonists 
back to the Main transporter room and transport them to the Elderado Station. 

 There is a TED in the Workers Qrts which is needed to gain access through 
the security door. Both security rooms are level 0 which means once you 
gain access to the first by using the TED you will be able to get the access 
code to use on the 2nd security room. However, in case you stuff it up, 
there is a base card in the 2nd section of the base which will give you 
access to all security rooms in the base.

 Return to the Transporter room and insert the instruction chip into the 
Transport Computer. Transport to Translink Rm 1 and you will change to a 
Kapone Commander. You will have approx. 12 minutes to destroy the Comms 
room before the Morph FX will terminate and you change back to a Tekite.

 Locate the Supply room and purchase a detonator, search the Armory room 
and locate a High Explosive hidden behind some blocks in the room. Join 
the detonator to the high explosive to form Primed High Explosives. This 
will need power applied to the detonator to explode.

 Take these to the Comms room on the way you should locate a corridor with 
a switch. This needs to be turned off as it powers the communication 
device in the Comms room. Go to the Comms room and insert the Primed 
Explosive into the communications device.

 Return to Corridor and throw the switch and the Comms room should be 
destroyed. Now locate Commander and kill him. There is a Lockup key being 
carried by a Kapone in this section which is required to free the locked 
Colonists. Rescue the Colonsist, kill a few Kapones and Bobs your Uncle.

 Before embarking on this operation, you should purchase as many LS1200 
or HG0500 missiles as possible from the hovar supply computer in the 
Elderado Foyer. The foyer is located in the Elderado Station and accessed 
by either F3 or using the mouse to select.

 From here, transport to the surface and locate sector 60:07, killing enemy 
ships along the way. Once you have reached this sector, slow down! There 
are four enemy missile turrets on the far outskirts, surrounding the base. 
There are five communication towers that need to be destroyed, and the 
only weapon is missiles. 

 You need to select missiles and target each towers one at a time. Quite a
few missiles are needed to penetrate a towers shields. One "trick" is to 
travel into the centre of the base near the middle building stop. You will 
be just out of range from the missile turrets, and you can target the 
outer four towers. You will need to move out to target the central tower,
avoiding any incoming missle fire.

 Once this is done, the operation will be a success.

You are in Base Aurora. First, make your way south to the supply room that
contains numerous colonists hiding there. Walk back into the main
transporter room and wait for them to file in. Select the "StarShip" option
on the transporter and wait for them to be transported.

Now, transport yourself to the first translink room. Search the box at the
back of the room to get a TED. Transport back to the main transporter, then
west towards the first security room. Use the TED to blow the security
door, then go in and access the security computer to get the access code
and also to unlock the doors.

Now, go north and enter the colonists room to the west of the first foyer,
search the bed with the dead colonist on it and collect the credit card.
Now, go east then north and turn east after reaching the hydroponics room.
Continue north and enter the room east of the next foyer. Destroy the
Kapone here and pick up the weapon container it dropped. You now have a
gun.

Go west and pick up the hidden hologram projector on the north wall. You
need to take out the Kapone commander to get a base card, so be careful.
Once in the commanders room, search the bed to find an empty fuse. Travel
south, then west to find two colonists.

Make your way back to the first foyer north of the security room. Tell the
colonists to stay there. Enter the security room to the east and then out
the north exit. Travel until you get to the lockup and rescue the
colonists. Travel back to the foyer and then to the main transporter and
transport the colonists to the starship.

Now, go to the supply room to the south and buy a 100amp fuse wire with the
credit card. Now using the inventory window, drop the fuse wire on the
empty fuse and you now have a complete fuse!

Go west past the first security room until you reach the second security
room. Enter the room to the south and destroy the Kapones and pick up the
control key. Head back to the first security room and then south to the
T-junction. Enter the control room to the west. Read the number on the key
via the inventory and use that number to access the computers. Examine the
generator to find the power fault. Head east to the reactor room and insert
the fuse into the generator. Head back to the control room and enable the
generator!

Note: There is an armory room to the east of the security room that is near
the lockup. You should go back there after gaining credits and buy better
weaponry and/or ammunition.

The Tekite is held in a room and is brain dead, there is a popup gun
directly underneath the Tekite ready to destroy it as soon as its moved
off.

Interrogation room is partially sealed with the computer containing the the
broken Tekite CPU in the sealed section of the room. Can see the sealed
section but cant seem to get to it.

Entry to sealed section via a switch in the sealed section that raises a
wall in a nearby corridor. This allows access to a foyer with a hidden door
through to the commanders quarters. The Commanders quarters has a hidden
door that allows access to the interrogation room into the sealed section
thus gaining access to the broken Tekite CPU.

Go to the supply room and purchase a blank Tekite CPU then through the
inventory join the broken CPU and Blank CPU thus gaining a whole CPU with
the Tekites memory intact.

Take the complete CPU back to the Restrained Tekite, insert the CPU, the
Tekite will now be able to follow you back to the Main Transporter room
where it can be transported back to the Star Shifter. Must first place
something on the popup gun as soon as the Tekite Moves off it.

You are in the base of Lares. First you will need to find the
neuroscrambler which is hidden in a cabinet within the store room. Then
transport to the translink room. Enter the commanders quarters and stun the
commander. Search the room and locate the lockup key. Go to the lockup
carefully travelling through the power pyramid corridors to avoid as much
damage as possible.

Once in the lockup room DO NOT activate the wall switch directly as this is
booby trapped. Rather, shoot the switch with the laser gun to switch off
the power pyramids. Unlock the hacker using the lockup key (right hand
colonist). Lead the colonist to the Central Computer room where he will
access a terminal to activate the central computer. Once it is activated,
go to it and insert the neuro-scrambler for programming.

Wait until the broadcast message is received from the colonist indicating
that re-programming has finished. Search the central computer to retrive
the neuro-scrambler and then go back to the commander and insert the
neuro-scrambler. The commander will now be friendly and follow you back to
the main transport room. However, a trap room will have been released at
this time and you will be swamped by revenging Lieutenants, so be careful.

After sending back the commander rescue the remaining colonists from the
lockup (and the hacker). If you dont have lockup keys to free them then use
a TED to destroy them rather then shooting as the TED doesn't count against
you (rogue/criminal). After transporting back the last colonist the
operation is complete.

Pick up the book and read it. Get the key and head east. Take the bucket from
the well and look in the well. Return to the first room and unlock the door
with the iron key. Go south, picking up the knife, and taking the way west into
a room with a wooden floor. Find your way around the barrels and collect the
stick and gum. Try eating the gum. Use the chewed gum on the bucket to plug the
hole. Leave this room and go south. Collect the small rock and continue south
and then east to find a scroll. Take the scroll and read it. Keep heading east
to find a door key. Pick it up and return west and then south to unlock the
door which it fits. Exploring this new room, take the fish and cheese and note
the empty drinking fountain. (The apple is not needed but can be eaten if you
wish.) Now, go directly north to the big rock and use the scroll (Spelle of
Levitation) on it. Use the knife on the cracked tile beneath to reveal a tap.
Operate the tap and return south to find the drinking fountain now full. Fill
the bucket and head north past the tap and then east to find a pair of pliers
in a fire beside an anvil. Use the bucket of water on the fire and take the
pliers. Drop the bucket and collect the string. Use the string on the stick to
make a fishing pole and pick up the horseshoe before leaving to the west. Keep
going west to return to the wooden floored room. Make your way through the
barrels to find the broken floorboard. Remove the floorboard using the pliers.
Drop the pliers and take the bronze key. Leave the room and head south past the
tap and then east to a locked chest. Use the bronze key to open the chest and
take the magnet. Use it on the fishing pole and take the silver coin from the
chest too. Go north, west, north and then east to find yourself back at the
well. Use the magnetic fishing pole to catch an iron key. Leave the fishing
pole and get the key. Return to the chest you have just unlocked by going west,
south and then east and unlock the door which is to the east. Go through the
doorway and head east, south and east again to come face to face with an orc.
Look at him. Now, head directly west to find a catapult. Load the catapult by
dropping the small rock on it and fire the catapult to remove the orc. Go east
past where the orc was and continue until you find a way to the south. Go south
here and collect the key. The way west is blocked by the orc who now has a
bandaged head. Go back north and west to the room with the catapult. As soon as
you enter the room go south to find a cracked floor tile. Use the knife to
reveal a ring. Take it and leave the knife behind. Go west, north and east
passing another catapult and finding a locked door. Unlock it and go through.
Then head west and north into a wooden floored room. Take the saw and leave the
room, heading east and then north to a new room. Collect the bronze key from
the top of the barrel and go to the far east of the room where there is a rat.
To get rid of the rat, stand between the barrels facing south and drop the
cheese. The rat will take it and run away. (If you stand in view of the rat and
drop the cheese, he will smell the cheese but not take it.) Now pick up the
scroll which the rat was guarding and read it. Leave the room and go west and
south to the catapult room. Take the west exit, heading back towards the start.
Go as far west as you can and then head north to the locked chest. Unlock it
and drop the book so that you can take the needle and ring. Now, retrace your
steps by going south and then east to the catapult room. From here take the
east exit and keep going until you find a room to the north with a skull on an
altar. Look at the skull and the inscription on the altar. Drop the needle on
the altar to answer the riddle. Head north to where you will find a note from
Gnaxar. Take it and read it. Proceed west to find another riddle. Use the fish
to answer it and take the way south. Pick up the bell, leaving the cross
behind, and make your way back north, east and then south through the first
riddle room. Go west a short way and then south to arrive in the room where the
orc is blocking the west exit. Use the scroll (Spelle of Shrinking) to dispose
of him. Go west to find another riddle and answer it with the saw. Head west
once more and then south to find yet another riddle. This time answer it by
dropping the horseshoe on the altar and head west and then south to find a
bronze key. Now make your way back to the final chest by going north, east,
north, east, north and then west into the catapult room. The chest is in the
north-east corner of the room. Unlock it and take the ring and copper coin
within. Now, leave by taking the east exit and keep going until you find the
way south again. Go south and keep heading west to find a locked door and a
final riddle. Answer it with the bell and go west into the portal room. Look at
the skull and pay your fare by dropping both coins on the altar. Now, stand in
the centre of the portal (the pentagram on the floor) facing the altar. Use
each of the three rings in the order given in Gnaxar's note (red-green-blue) to
be transported to the next level.

Collect the crystal ball from the altar just to the north of where you start.
Move a little to the west and then north into a room full of levers. Take the
empty bag and exit again to the south. Head east until you come to a red
carpet. Operate the bottom left corner of the carpet to lift it up and reveal a
key. Pick up the key and head west until you come to the end of the hallway.
Unlock the door which leads west and enter this room. Take the key from the
altar and go back out to the east. In the hallway, go to the first locked door
which leads south and unlock it. Go through the doorway and collect the shield
and the broken arrow. Lift the top right corner of the southernmost carpet to
find another key. Take it and go west to come to a pile of rocks. Fill the
empty bag with rocks. Now, go east then north to the hallway and east a little
way until you come to a locked door leading north. Unlock it and enter the room
to find two altars with raised platforms. Drop the crystal ball on one platform
and the bag of rocks on the other to open the door to the north. Go north and
pick up the door key from the corner of the room. Head west along a passage to
find your way blocked by the Guardian. Look at him. Now, find your way back to
the hallway by going east and then south. Next, go west a short way and take
the first doorway south to enter a room full of holes. Drop the shield on the
first hole and walk across it and to the west. Turn around and pick up the
shield again. Repeat this process, dropping the shield to cover each hole,
until you work your way to the south-east corner of the room where you will
find a scroll. Take the scroll and read it. Make your way back out of the room
using the shield to bridge the holes as before. Now, head to the east end of
the hallway until you come to a locked door. Look at the inscription on the
altar next to the door. Use the scroll (Spelle of Enlightenment) on the altar
and read the inscription again. Make a note of the directions of the arrows
shown. Go south and pick up the bronze key from the chair. Move north and west
to the hallway. Head to the west end and take the doorway leading west. Unlock
the chest against the west wall with the bronze key. Take the jar of honey.
(You can take the sweet and eat it if you want.) Unlock the door which leads
south and enter a room which contains a drinking fountain. Eat the honey from
the jar and fill it with water from the drinking fountain. Go east and collect
the spade from the pile of rocks. Head back to the hallway by going west, north
then east. Once back in the hallway go east a short way and take the first
doorway leading north. Operate the levers in this room to match the directions
of the arrows which you saw earlier on the altar. When you get all of the
levers right you will hear a door open. Now, leave the room and go to the east
end of the hallway. Keep going east through the doorways into the labyrinth.
Take care not to wander too far into the labyrinth yet as it is very easy to
get lost. Go north to the first passage leading east. Go east here to the first
way south and take it. Keep going south until you come to a plant growing at
the end of the passage. Use the jar of water on the plant and take the flowers
which it produces. Now, retrace your steps by going north, west, south and west
again until you arrive back in the hallway. Go through the first doorway
leading north and continue north until you come to the passage leading west.
Follow this to arrive at the Guardian. Use the flowers to gain access to the
Hall of the Undead. Open all of the coffins using the spade. Look at all of the
skeletons which you reveal and pick up the piece of parchment, the bronze key
and the note which you will find. You can drop the jar, flowers and shield as
they are no longer needed. The note can also be left behind once it has been
read. When you've finished in this room leave it by the exit to the east and
travel south to arrive back in the hallway. Go to the room at the west end of
the hallway and open the remaining chest with the bronze key. Take the flute
and try playing it. Examine the flute, drop it and use the broken arrow on it.
Use the piece of parchment you are carrying with the one which comes out of the
flute. Look at the completed parchment. Drop it and use the scroll (Spelle of
Enlightenment) on it. Pick up the map and look at it. Now, go back to the
hallway by heading east and continue going east until you re-enter the
labyrinth. Once in the labyrinth head north as far as you can. Then, follow the
passage to the west until it turns north again. Head north until you reach the
second passage east. Take this and then the first passage north. Follow this
passage as it turns east and continue east until you can go no further. Now, go
north following the passage west before choosing to go north once more. Follow
this passage to arrive at a dead end where you will find a bronze key which you
must take. Now, refering to the map which you carry, make your way through the
labyrinth to the southernmost room marked on it. Unlock the chest you will find
in this room and take the bone. Again using your map, find your way back to the
Hall of the Undead and use the bone on the skeleton with a missing leg bone.
Take the key which he gives you and head back through the labyrinth to the
north-west corner of the map. Unlock the door leading west and go through.


@{u}Level 3 - The Wizard's Lair@{uu}

Pick up the scroll from the altar in the north-west corner of the room and read
it. Now, go south into a room with tables and chairs and take the jam sandwich
from the southernmost table. Leave the room by taking the west exit into a
north-south passageway. Follow the passage south and then west a little way.
Take the first doorway leading south to arrive in a room with a long altar
containing a stone wheel and two levers. Try operating the levers before going
east into a smaller room. Collect the bronze key from the altar and go west and
then north to return to the passageway. Head west until you come across another
passage leading south. Go south here and then go through the first doorway
leading west. Take the lamp and leave the room. Continue along the passageway
heading south and then west until you are confronted by a large hole in the
floor. Turn around and head east and then north until you arrive at the other
passageway which leads east and west. Head west into a large room with a
cauldron at the centre. Drop the bronze key and lamp. Go to the west end of the
room where you will find a fly on a table. Try to pick up the fly. Move to the
table which lies just to the north of the cauldron where you will see that the
fly has landed. Try to get it again. Now, move to the eastern part of the room
and try once more to get the elusive fly. Head west to find the fly back in its
original position. Now, try to eat the jam sandwich and take the half eaten
sandwich and drop it on the table to the north of the cauldron in exactly the
place where the fly landed before. Return to the fly and try to get it again.
Head back to the sandwich and look at the fly. Take the fly and leave the room
by the eastern exit. Go east and take the first passageway leading south.
Follow the passage all the way south and then west to arrive at the large hole.
Stand facing the hole and ensure that you are carrying only the scroll and the
fly. Use the scroll (Spelle of Transmigration.) Now, head west and go through
the first doorway north. Take the dustpan. Leave the room and head west along
the passage once more. When you arrive in a room with purple tiles on the
floor, take the key from the chair in the north-west corner. Head south from
this room into a passageway which runs east-west and follow it east to come to
a locked door. Unlock it and enter a room which has an altar at its north end.
Read the inscription on the altar to the left of the raised platform. Use the
dustpan on the pile of ashes which are on the floor. Take the east exit into a
room which has bookshelves along its north and south walls. Go to the north
bookshelf and take the painting from it. Look at the painting. Collect the
scroll from the table and read it before going to the south bookshelf and
picking up the iron key. Leave the room by going west and continue through the
next room to the passageway. Take the first doorway north into the room with
the purple floor tiles and keep going northwards into the next room. Continue
until you encounter a locked door leading north. Unlock it and go north to find
yourself back in the cauldron room. Collect the bronze key which you dropped
earlier but leave the hat and lamp behind. Exit the room heading south again
and continue into the purple tiled room. From here head west and follow the
passageway to a small room with a locked chest. Unlock it and take the gear.
Collect the oil can too and leave the room, following the passage back to the
room with the purple tiles. This time head south and then west along the
passageway to enter a bedroom. Take the mirror from the table which is just to
the north of the doorway and leave the room heading east and then north all the
way to the cauldron room. Collect the lamp left here earlier and exit by the
east doorway. Keep going east until you come to the second opening leading
south. Go through this doorway into the room with the stone wheel and levers.
Use the oil can on the left hand lever. Move to the broken part of the altar
and look inside. Use the gear on it and look at it again. Now, drop the
painting on the floor and use the mirror on it. Reading from the bottom
upwards, note the sequence of numerals indicated in the painting. Operate the
left hand lever until the number shown on the wheel is the same as the first in
the sequence in the painting. When it is, move to the right hand lever and
operate it once. Move back to the left hand lever and continue moving the wheel
to each number of the sequence, entering each one with the right hand lever.
When you have entered the combination correctly you will hear a noise. Head
east into the next room and you will find that one of the statues has moved
aside to reveal a ladder. Try to use the ladder. Drop the lamp and use the
scroll (Spelle of Kindling) on it. Take the lamp and use the ladder. At the
bottom of the ladder head east and take the second opening north. Collect the
bottle of glue from the open chest and exit to the south. Follow the passageway
back to the west until you are able to take another passage northwards. Go
north here and then west through the first doorway into another room. Pick up
the piece of pottery from the altar to the south. Exit the room and head south
and then west to arrive back at the ladder. Use the ladder to climb back up.
Now, go west and then north to the passageway and then west again until you
enter the cauldron room. Take the hat and examine it. Drop the hat and take the
pin which fell out of it. You can also drop the oil can and mirror which you
have finished with. Exit the cauldron room by the exit which leads south and
keep heading the same way through the purple tiled room until you reach the
east-west passage. Go east into the room with the altar which has the
inscriptions. Use the glue on the piece of pottery which is in the room and
then use the other piece of pottery with it to re-construct an urn. Take the
urn and place it on the raised platform in the middle of the altar. Use the
dustpan full of ashes on the urn. Look at the inscription to the right of the
urn. Leave the room by going west and continue until you re-enter the bedroom.
Make your way to the bookshelf along the north wall. Find the brown book which
is lying on its side with an hourglass symbol on its cover. Look at it and then
try to take it. Take the bronze key which is revealed. Move to the south-west
corner of the room and unlock the chest. Take the gold pendant and look at it.
Take the staff from the table against the south wall and move north to the bed.
Operate the pillow, to lift it, and take the piece of paper which was hidden
there. Now, leave by heading east and keep going to arrive back in the room
where the urn is on the altar. Drop the gold pendant on the altar with the
inscription to the right of the urn. Take the gold pendant and look at it
again. Drop it once more and use the pin on it. Take the gold key. Leave the
room heading west and take the passage northwards. Keep going north until you
arrive back in the cauldron room. Go through the room and exit by the doorway
leading east. Keep going east and go through the second opening leading south.
Head east from here to find yourself back at the ladder. Climb down, and at the
bottom, go east and then first north. Then, enter the first room to the west.
Go to the north end of the room to find a gold box. Unlock it with the gold key
and pick up the elixir. Exit the room and follow the passageway northwards
until it turns east into a room with small holes in the floor. Look at the
piece of paper which you are carrying. Use the staff on the holes in the floor,
following the sequence shown on the paper. When you complete the sequence
correctly the wall to the north of the holes will open and allow you to escape
from the Dark Citadel.

@NODE "2" "Epsilon 9 Solution"
@TOC "MAIN"
@{u}The Entrance@{uu}

   * Operate the cupboard.
   * Examine the book.
   * Examine the notepad on the desk.
   * Operate the computer.

@{u}Underground@{uu}

   * Send Nodd back into the lift.
   * Use the quadrocorder on the alien door.
   * Operate the quadrocorder. You now have two atmosphere readings. To open
     the door you need to match the atmosphere to the other side by operating
     the gas tanks.
     Quick solution: Operate the chlorine tank 5 times then the oxygen tank
     6 times.
   * Operate the alien symbols.

@{u}Master Control@{uu}

   * At this point Yeno has to take one path and Nodd the other.
     One path leads to the bridge, the other to the windmill.

@{u}The Bridge@{uu}

   * Operate the red button. Save first, because you can't save
     during the puzzle.
   * This puzzle is really evil. This is how it works:
     Each square on the grid has a corresponding panel. Operating the panel
     brings up a logical puzzle. If you get it right that square will be 
     activated. I won't give the solutions here as there are only six 
     possibilities in each case, so if you can't work it out just guess.

     When activated, a green square lights up the square in the direction 
     of the arrow. A red square will light up itself, but only if the 
     square that the arrow is pointing to is already lit. Each square can 
     only be activated once. If you reach a dead end, press the red button
     again.

   * If you get through this first time, apply to join Mensa.
   * When a complete path is lit up, you can cross the bridge and enter
     the next room (Teleport I)

@{u}The Windmill@{uu}

   Nodd's solution:

   * Operate the alien toolbox.
   * Use the screwdriver on the radio.
   * Operate the panel.
   * Take the regulator.
   * Use the amplifier on the slot.
   * Operate the dial.

   Yeno's solution:

   * Operate the alien toolbox
   * Operate the wheel.
   * Use the hydrospanner on the pipe section.
   * Use the pipe section on the exit.

   Both characters:

   * Go through to the next room (The Alien)

@{u}The Alien@{uu}

   * Save now. As the warning says, you can die here.
   * Taking a step forward will activate the next sequence. When the alien
     appears, shoot it, unless you want to die horribly.
   * Examine the ceiling.
   * Shoot the ceiling.
   * Go through to the next room (Teleport II). If you didn't shoot the 
     ceiling first, it's game over, man.

@{u}Teleport I/II@{uu}

   You should have one character in each of the teleport rooms. For the 
   purpose of this puzzle, it doesn't matter which character is in which 
   room.
   
   In Teleport I (following the bridge):

   * Examine the notebook. You will find a yellow card.
   * Use the card on the platform.
   * Operate the controls until you see the other character.
   * Operate the cupboard.
   * Take the bar.
   * Use the bar on the panel.
   * Take the cables.

   In Teleport II (following the alien):

   * Take the box nearest the door.
   * Use the box on the scanner.
   * Operate the scanner.
   * Take the sunglasses.
   * Take the box back to the previous room, operate the unit, and use the
     box on the unit. Return to Teleport II.
   * Examine the open box. You will find a blue card.
   * Use the card on the platform.
   * Operate the controls until you see the other character.
   * Switch back to Teleport I.

   Back in Teleport I:

   * Operate the switch.
   * Take the blue card.
   * Use the blue card on the card reader.
   * Switch back to Teleport II.

   Back in Teleport II:

   * Take the yellow card.
   * Use the yellow card on the card reader.
   * Go through to the next room (Corridor I).
   * Switch to the other character.

   The next puzzle is different for each character.

   Yeno's solution:

   * Take the flask.
   * Use the flask on the orange fluid twice.
   * Use the flask on the green fluid.
   * Use the flask on the yellow fluid.
   * Operate the unit.
   * Use the cable on both sockets.
   * Use the flask on the unit.
   * Use the formula on the cupboard.
   * Take the door.
   * Go into the next room (Water).

   Nodd's solution:

   * Use the cable on the socket, then on the door.
   * Go through to the next room (Water).

@{u}Corridor I@{uu}

   No puzzle here, just go on to Statues.

@{u}Water@{uu}

   Yeno's solution:

   * Use the door on the water.
   * Use the panel on the water.

   Nodd's solution:

   * Use the cable on the water, then on the other cable (by the door).

   * The door here won't open until the other character reaches Corridor II.

@{u}Statues@{uu}

   * Nodd should examine the strange symbols. Yeno should use the 
     quadrocorder on them.
   * Walk over to the trapdoor. When the eye appears, quickly operate the
     sunglasses. Fail, and you die.
   * Go through the door. The character will leave the sunglasses behind.

@{u}Corridor II@{uu}

   * Operate the switch. This opens the door in the Water room so that the 
     other character can get into the Statues room.
   * When both characters are through, make one stand on the pad on the 
     floor, and the other walk through the doorway.

     Then watch the ending sequence.

@TOC "MAIN"
   @{u}The Island of Debreen@{uu} 
   
   Relics of Deldroneye II - 'Island of Debreen' is an adventure filled
   with a sense of mystery.  And such an aura can be shattered forever
   by reading the entire solution to a game before even playing it.  It is
   advised the following solution should be used to help you when your
   final effort is a futile one.  Anything less than that and you are
   denying yourself the rewards that come with completing a game such as
   this on your own.  However, if you want to see it all, and see it now
   then please read on...

   You take control of Falcon on the bridge of his new spaceship, and have
   narrowly escaped collision with an unknown vessel at the expense of all
   your fuel and reserve power.  You decide to steal the nessesary power
   from the unknown vessel by manouvering your ship to its side and cutting
   your way in.

   @{u}1. Moving the Ship@{uu}
   
   Use the laserpen on the Power In socket on the console to active the
   view screen.  Look at the view screen to read the situation.  Now use
   the laserpen on the Power Out socket to retrieve your valuable power.
   Move right to the engine room and open the engine panel.  Feed power
   from your laserpen into the engine to activate it.  Make your way to
   the navigation room and open the PIV Door.  Feed your last unit of
   power from the laserpen into the computer via the Power Input Valve.
   Talk to the computer and it will eventually feed some vectors into the
   main computer back on the bridge.  Before leaving the room, open the
   power output valve door and restore the power to your laserpen by taking
   it back.  Go to the bridge and new vectors will be available, so hit
   the button on the console and the ship should move to the calculated
   vector, next to the Debreen vessel.

   @{u}2. Forced Entry@{uu}
   
   From here on in, you'll need a spacesuit to survive your exploration of
   the Debreen craft.  Go down the corridor from the junction between the
   navigation room and the bridge, and enter the suit-o-matic.  You should
   now be adorned with metal clothing.  Enter the docking bay, press the
   Borble and make your way to the docks bay exit.  The huge Debreen outer
   wall looms to cover the whole entrance to the docking bay.  Use the last
   unit of power from your laserpen to cut a hole in the weak part of the
   wall.  Enter the newly created hole and find yourself in a small alcove.
   Move to the automatic doors and enter.  In this long corridor, and at
   the foot of the door you have just emerged is a small green device.  Kick
   this device to brake it.  A small magnet will come loose, which you must
   collect.  Now continue down the corridor and have a chat with the robot
   sitting in the tubing.

   @{u}3. The Electric Ladder@{uu}
   
   If you continue to the far left of this corridor and enter the door, you
   will find a room with a very tasty ladder.  Unfortunately, when you climb
   it you will get stunned.  Kick the panel below the slot and look inside.
   The lever is too far so we need to reach it somehow.  Go to the next
   room at the end of the next corridor along, and find the corpse of a
   dead alien explorer.  On its remains are some gloves and a belt.  Take
   both, and then use the magnet on the belt to form a magnet on a string
   style tool.  Return to the cracked panel and fish out the lever.  Use
   this lever on the slot to deactivate the defences of the zone.  This
   includes the power supply to the ladder!

   @{u}4. The Turret@{uu}
   
   Ascending the ladder to the top will reveal that the Debreen craft has
   been welded to the hull of an altogether different ship.  This new area
   is guarded with a trained laser turret, the walls are clearly made of
   heat resisting material, where the floor is not and is falling apart.
   Try and get to the door, and you'll get zapped and fall to the bottom of
   the ladders.  Don't worry, the spacesuit is designed for such impacts.
   You will find it very difficult to come to harm.  Half way up the ladder
   you will find an alcove with an empty energy cell.  Take this from the
   wall and climb the ladder.  Show this energy cell to the turret and it
   will rather casually fire at it, er, and you.  When you regain your
   bearings, at the bottom of the ladder, the energy cell will be on the
   floor next to you, FULL!  Return the energy cell to its socket, and you
   should have stabilized the laser turret, and its mode will change to
   'peace' green.  Open the newly available door, and enter.

   @{u}5. Metal Hell@{uu}
   
   Again, a third ship has been welded to this Debreen junk-heap, but due
   to a misscalculation, the floor was placed thirty-feet lower than would
   have been ideal.  Falcon falls and destroys the only mobile robot in the
   complex when he lands IN IT!  When the dust settles, rip the pipe off
   the wall and enter the open door to the right.  In this dark room, take
   the Optiwire and container hidden in the junk, use the pipe to crowbar
   open the dome to steal the brain of the robot.  Have a pleasant chat with
   the active immobile robot, then nick his arm.  Exit this spooky place
   and return to the first metal room.  Use the pipe to crowbar open the
   door and enter.  Have a chat with the guard robot, and when he starts to
   bore you enter the adjoining open door.  take the tape from the dispenser
   and have a look at the dome.  It needs repairing.  Use the tape on the
   optiwire to make a strong sticky wire.  You can use this strong sticky
   wire to reconnect the leads leading to the dome.  Return to the guard
   room and inform the robot he can have a break, but alas he has not moved
   for so long he has rusted.  Come to the rescue and return to the first
   metal room.  use the container to collect the oil from the right wall,
   and give this to the guard robot.  He will squeek his way to the rest
   room for a very long vacation.  Use the robot arm you stole from the
   secuirty robot to activate the palm scanner near the gold door.  The
   doors will open and you can enter.  Inside, a brainy blob on a pillar
   greets you with kind words.  Give him the brain you took from the other
   robot and accept his advice, and return to the first metal room.  Try
   using the laserpen on the metal door on the north wall.  The effort was
   hopeful, but you will see your efforts fail.  Return to the blob with
   this news and he will replicate a device which will enable you to
   charge your laserpen to full power.  By returning to the metal door,
   and firing the laser, you realise doing so would be dangerous.  The
   shiny surface would reflect the laser.  Return to the guard room and
   laser open a panel hidden in a slight indent on the north wall.  Take
   the sandpaper like substance and use it on the door to make it rough.
   Now fire the laserpen to gain access to the next segment of the Debreen
   vessel.

   @{u}6. The Huamin Conflict@{uu}
   
   An opportunity to relax and enjoy the comic lunacy of two crazy alien
   ghostlings.  Simply take the spangley object from the wall in the left
   room from where you entered the maze, and continually talk from one
   alien to the other, twisting the facts and conveying mis-information
   to your new alien friends.  Eventually they will destroy each other in
   an invisible fight to the death.  As the ghostlings disappear, so will
   the obstruction and you can use the spangley key object on the floor
   of the room with the eye.  The eye will scan you and the door will
   open, awaiting your eager entry.

   @{u}7. Destination Debreen@{uu}
   
   Cross the spacewalk to the large doors and talk to the small sphere set
   into the door.  The centurion will not open the doors.  Go to the right
   and take the pole from the twisted piping.  Go to the far left and have
   a look at the junction box.  Try using the pipe you collected from the
   metal room to pull it off the wall and it will break under the pressure.
   Now try the much stronger space metal of the Debreen, and watch the
   junction box fall off the wall with ease.  When you return to the gate,
   a maintenance robot is busy finding the error, whicn you recently
   created.  He has had to open a small door to get partly outside, and you
   get leap into the gap without the centurion looking.  Once inside, make
   your way through the sandy corridors until you reach a room with a
   crater, and a metalic object imbedded in the ground.  Look for a button
   different from the rest and press it.  The Debreen will be brought from
   stasis, and revived.  Unfortunately, you have left the space-port open
   and have let out all the special air the Debreen need to breath.  He
   is slowly pleading for his life, so you must quiz him on how exactly to
   close the door and return to the port you entered.  Find the hidden
   button by walking around the port-entrance and then press it.  Return
   to the crater room and follow the Debreen into the newly revealed
   secret door to the his control center.

   When you enter the room, a large wall mounted display shows in vivid
   detail the evil sight a Medivian Nose.  The nose, horrifically, being
   firmly attatched to a battleship and in the mood for destruction.  It
   fires three plasma bolts simultaniously and rocks the entire Debreen
   vessel.  Talk to the Debreen and assess your situation, and reassess it!
   Exit his patient abode, and continue right until you cannot progress
   any further.  Find the hidden door, and open it.  Inside, you will
   find a garbage bat, which opens in the barren void of space.  You can
   also see the real, unmagnified Medivian ship floating about.  Take the
   green orb from the garbage bay power system and place it in the small
   Deldroneye Weapon on the floor.  Using the small pressure socket, the
   green orb will slot into place, and then run back to the Debreen
   Control Center.  Ask the Debreen to activate the Garbage system and it
   will activate, instead, the powerful Deldroneye laser.

   And as the passive Debreen seemed about to refuse the request, and in
   a language Falcon understood well, the strange creature said, "OK...
   Let's Fry'em!".  No sooner had Falcons amusement formed a grin wider
   than his own face, the Deldroneye laser was ripping across the small
   distance to the Medivian ship...

   ...the rest of the story opened Falcons eyes to further truths about
   the Relics Of Deldroneye, but you'll just have to complete the game and
   read THAT for yourself.

   @{u}The Story of Zantis@{uu}                      [SOLUTION TO RETURN TO ZANTIS]
   
   Days before Falcons encounter with the strange vessel far from planet
   Deldronis, the planet town Zantis was effected by a strange silence.
   For centuries, the town had fallen under the protection of the secret
   gang of aliens known as the Spam Syndicate.  But for a few days, the
   town of Zantis errupted into a place of continual crime.  The leader
   of the Syndicate had been stolen, and news travelled fast in Zantis.

   Falcon, summoned by the acting leader of the syndicate, was given the
   honourable task of finding their leader and restoring peace to the
   planet.  No easy task for an exiled explorer with no money, no weapon
   and only a six-foot lady frog as a friend.

   Leaving the port, Falcon ventured to the only 'safe' taverno in the
   town, Errosons Place.  A tough joint at the best of times, but it too
   had been overcome by the uncommon silence.  The metal barkeep was
   little help, who maintained that most of Falcons problems could be
   solved without resorting to drink.  Not that the barkeep had any drink
   to vend.  Leaving none the wiser, aside from recounting the Tavernos
   wide selection of chocolate, Falcon made his way down a side alley and
   through a not-very-well hidden door to the syndicate.  The stand-in
   leader began the rantings of a clearly unstable mind, and confirming
   that the situation was grave.  Falcon left quickly, and searched the
   town for anything that may provide a clue to the whereabouts of the
   missing leader.  An alien trader had some information, and quite a few
   suspicous items to sell.  The information was useful, but the set of
   transporter cards he produced would prove to be most helpful.  In trade
   for the cards, the alien would accept shells as payment.  But finding
   two shells in a potential warzone was clearly going to be difficult.
   The first shell was obtained by briding an old tramp on a beach to
   reveal the hiding place of his treasured shell.  Chocolate seemed to
   be his weakness, and ate ravenously.  The chocolate was mighty expensive
   and Falcon made a mental note to ask the barkeep why they cost so
   much.  The shell produced a less that ideal trade, as the card, when
   used on the hotel transporter unit, put Falcon in a small room with
   a door leading back to the hotel street.  It was however fortunate in
   that Falcon found a rather handy crowbar.  A crowbar which would later
   open a sealed crate, revealing a handy device for scooping meat.  In
   turn the scoop proved even more handy when eating live crab.  The end
   result, of course, being after the meal all you had was a shell.  And
   the value of shells on Zantis, at least for Falcon, was now very very
   agreeable.  After cleaning the shell in the ocean, to disguise it's
   recent status, Falcon used the shell to trade for a second card.  This
   card placed Falcon at the entrance to a locked science lab.  Falcon
   was about to give up.  Throw himself in the ocean and return to the
   green slime of his youth, when the beach begger mumbled something with
   reference to Falcons plight.  After a short conversation with the
   begger, and further exchange of the chocolate cash, the begger revealed
   he used to work as a maintenance technician.  A maintenance card and
   a key where cladly handed over.  The key was able quite easily to open
   the lock of the science lab, and inside lay the quivering green blob
   that was the syndicate leader.  His brain was being sucked out and
   deposited in some huge glass computer, or so it seemed to Falcon.  With
   stuttered clues from the leader, and consultation with the acting leader
   back at the main headquarters, Falcon retrieved something to restore the
   brain of the endangered leader.  A small triangular brain disk, hidden
   many years earlier in a disused panel of the Virtual Timetable machine.
   Falcon used the maintenance card he took from the begger to bypass the
   access port to the panel, and used the brain disk in the glass computer
   to restore the leader to his usual diplomatic self.  Immediately, the
   leader gave a skeptor to Falcon, for fear of his captor.  The skeptor
   could only be handled by the permitted holder.  Anyone else would be
   viciously eliminated by its power, and now Falcon controlled a power
   equal to that of the ancient Deldroneye and Medivian Empires combined.
   How on earth the kidnapper could have subdued the leader and brain-
   washed him before this power could be used was and remained to be a
   mystery to Falcon.  As Falcon left to track this captor, a snakelike
   figure blocked his escape and declared himself to be the kidnapper.
   Not realising Falcon had the power of the Skeptor, the large captor
   ritualistically hurled friendly abuse and pathetic attempts at goating
   but all for naught.  The kidnapper had lost the moment Falcon was
   handed the Skeptor, and soon-after this evil vilan was planted in a
   nearby garden for all to ridicule.  Such was his punishment.

   Falcon honourably returned the Skeptor to its rightful owner, and was
   in return given a magnificent feast.  Rumours circulated openly that
   most of the meat in the feast comprised of the slaughtered leaders of
   all the rebelious factions responsible for crimes during the riots.
   Falcon didn't eat much that day.

   To complete repayment, as the syndicate termed the gesture, Falcon was
   given a full tank of plasmafuel, and a very expensive spaceship to put
   it in.  A dangerous pair of fluffy dice.  And finally, as the previous
   owner was a gas lifeform, control systems and chairs where installed.

   Falcon bid farewell to his extended family, the syndicate.  He knew
   this was a relationship he would share to the grave.  Criminals they
   may have been, but they knew the meaning of honour, and extended Falcon
   every courtesy.  As Falcon lauched his new ship away from the planet
   town Zantis, he reclined slowly as the full weight of his adventure
   sunk in.  He was on the up again, in a big way...
