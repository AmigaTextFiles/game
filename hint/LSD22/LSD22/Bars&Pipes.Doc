                    Bars&Pipes Version 10.d

Welcome to Bars&Pipes, the Amiga's first object-oriented musical
composition environment.  In pages to come, you will understand why you've
made an important musical choice in purchasing this program.  With
Bars&Pipes, you're truly bound only by the limits of your own creativity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Bars&Pipes' Five Essential Components

Bars&Pipes' musical environment consists of four central parts:  the
Pipeline, the Toolbox, the Sequencer and the Editor.  Briefly, let’s go
over these elements...

1) The PipeLine                                                  

The Pipeline guides your musical input from conception to performance.  We
call it the Pipeline because it actually resembles the kind of plumbing
that exists beneath your dwelling.  By arranging the pipe and valve icons,
you can direct the flow of musical information on a track-by-track basis. 
You can even connect two or more tracks by using special connector icons. 
To each Pipeline, you assign a track name.  Also, no limit exists to the
number of tracks you may record.

Essentially, the Pipeline consists of two parts:  the Input side and the
Output side.  To understand the flexibility this offers, you first must
understand the Toolbox.

2)  The ToolBox

The Toolbox contains dozens of modules that process MIDI information as it
flows through the Pipeline.  We call these modules Tools.  Each Tool
functions by musically enhancing the notes you’ve input.  A few examples:

* UNQUANTIZE takes your input and randomly varies its timing.  This Tool is
especially handy when trying to attain a minimalistic or impromptu feel to
your composition.

* TRANSPOSE provides interval harmonies to a melodic line you’ve input. 
Simply specify both the interval and key signature and this Tool will
embellish your composition.

* INVERT allows you to set high and low note boundaries and octaves. 
Thereafter, you are able to play a series of chords in whatever way is
technically comfortable, yet the chords will sound as inversions with
proper voice leading.  This Tool is especially handy for those whose
primary instrument is not the keyboard.

(For you untrained musicians, here’s an explanation:  Harmonic chord
inversion occurs when the lowest note of a chord, the root, is in an upper
position instead of in the bass.  This is done so that one chord will
connect smoothly with the next.)

* KEYBOARD SPLITTER allows you to divide what you play on the keyboard onto
two different tracks.  For example, you could direct your right hand, which
typically plays the melody, onto the trumpet track and, your left hand,
which typically plays the accompaniment, onto the organ track.

As you can see, some Tools are musical in nature, while others perform more
technical tasks.  Some will provide graphic applications or act as hooks
into compatible programs.  Still others act as building blocks in the
design of Tools you create.  All Tools can be customized to your
specifications.

One of the most powerful aspects of the Toolbox is its open-ended nature. 
You can program your own Tools or use Create-a-Tool to assemble MacroTools.
 Create-a-Tool allows you to combine any configuration of Tools into one,
in order to save time when using a common succession of Tools, or to create
a specialized Tool of your own design.  For example, you could assemble a
MacroTool which consists of a Tool that randomly selects and plays notes
and rhythms with a Tool that filters out all notes but those in a
pre-selected key.  In this way, you would achieve a random effect within
key and scale/mode boundaries.

Assembling a MacroTool is easy.  The Create-A-Tool Window allows your to
import your building-block Tools of choice directly from the Toolbox.  Drag
the appropriate icons onto the Pipeline template and place them in the
desired order.  Create-a-Tool lets you paint in your MacroTool icon by
using the Create-a-Tool easel and palette.  After you’ve painted, named and
assigned an identifier to your MacroTool, it automatically becomes part of
your Toolbox, to use as you would any other Tool.

3)  The Sequencer                                                

Graphically, the Sequencer sits in the middle of each Pipeline, dividing
the input (left) side from the output (right) side.  Functionally, the
Sequencer records MIDI data which flows in from the left side of the
Pipeline and plays it back, passing it through the right side of the
Pipeline.  Among other things, the Sequencer allows you to view graphically
what you’ve recorded, as well as cut, copy and paste all tracks at once. 
Its Looped-mode Recording option allows you to record one section of your
music repeatedly, until you arrive at your performance of choice. 

4)  The Editor

Bars&Pipes’ Editor was designed with amateur and professional musicians in
mind.  For those who can read music, a staff displays notes on a treble and
bass clef.  For those who do not read standard classical notation, a piano
roll displays the notes.  Regardless of which system you prefer, Bars&Pipes
provides full editing capabilities with each.  Our goal in designing the
Editor was to allow you, the composer, as much flexibility as possible in
editing your work.  We call this the "one-size-fits-all principle."  In
other words, if you want to draw in a note, we give you that option.  If
you want to type the note in the information window, we give you that
option.  Or, if you want to play in the note via your input device
(keyboard, wind controller, etc.), you guessed it, we give you that option,
too.

5)  Accessories

As you may already know, Bars&Pipes is an open-ended system.  The
advantages to this are numerous...flexibility, expandabilty,
affordablility.  By investing in Bars&Pipes now, you've invested in a
future of state-of-the-art musical components.  Currently available and
future Accessories will provide the link to the future by enhancing
Bars&Pipes built-in features.  

Some examples of Accessories are Follow the Leader, which prints a
lyrics/chord change sheet, Triple Play, which loads three songs at once for
performance situations, Mix Maestro, which provides automated mixing right
on the screen, and Muffy,which converts Bars&Pipes song into MIDI File
Format.  Some of these are included with Bars&Pipes; others are available
to you as "add-ons."

A Few Notes:  If you're using the Amiga's internal sounds capability
instead of MIDI, please do the following:  Replace the MIDI In Tool (on the
far left side of each PipeLine) with the Spare Keys Tool.  Click twice on
Spare Keys to access a keyboard which can be used with either the mouse or
bottom two rows of your Amiga keyboard.  Replace the MIDI Out Tool (on the
far right side of each PipeLine) with the AmigoPhone Tool.  Click twice on
the AmigoPhone to access the AmigoPhone's Control Window.

To edit a Tool's Controls, click twice on the Tool's icon in the PipeLine
or use the Edit PadTool Controls... option in the Windows menu to edit a
Tool in the ToolPad.

To access the Sequence Editor for each Track, double-click on the gray area
of the PipeLine.
