A-Train saved games by Colin Attle.

Here is a short account for each of the maps i made with A-Train construction set.

Connect-4.
You start off with 2 trains moving between 2 stations,but how do you get to the 
other stations at the right side of the map and still make money?.Dont forget about 
the rivers to cross and the mountainside retreat.

Decision Time...
Here you have a belt line running all the way around the edge of the map and 2 
big mountain ranges in the middle of it all.The decision you have to make is,will 
you go into the middle of the map,or stick to the outside.Well what will you do?.

Help!!!.
The above word sums this map up about right.Hardly no money,Passengers could 
be better,what can be done except panicking.A little tip,reorganize your train 
network while you still have the time is a must,and wait patiently.

O-no.
One straight-ish line,a small town,lots of water all arorund those this sound like 
trouble?.Maybe,Maybe not.Dont forget that there's holes in the lakes to develop 
things,so not is all lost.

Double Trouble?
What could be worse than 1 track that's losing money?.2 tracks thats losing money  
thats what,and here that's what's happening.Just remember,you cant build on the 
sea,so dont even try.

Squeeze.
Hmmm.Ever been to the peak district,well if you have you'll feel at home with this
little beauty.There's not enough space i hear you cry.With careful planning there's
just about enough,or is there.

Well i hope you enjoy playing these maps,as much as i had creating them.Try not 
to lose too much sleep over them...These are all Freeware
