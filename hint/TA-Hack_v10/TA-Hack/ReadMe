### New in v1.0
  · Load/Save
  · TA could now be started from CLI (really).


### Manual
Overview:
  This little programm gives you much lives and money. And you could
  save and load the game, only in one session! Tower Assault must be
  installed on HD.


Installation:
  1st install TA to your HardDisk, using your Manual (and disk 2).
  2nd Drag'n'Drop the TA-Hack drawer to where ever you want.


Usage:
  Make sure, that TA is called 'AB' (case insensitive). Now TA can be
  started  from CLI.  (Sorry for v0.2)  Start and play TA.  Pause the
  game using the 'P'-Key.  Then leave TA temporary,  using the 'ESC'-
  Key. Use TA-Hack from Workbench or CLI.


CLI:
  Start TA-Hack,  it tells you the lives and money from both players.
  With  the arguments  PL1LIVES  and  PL2LIVES you  could  change the
  lives  from the  1st  or the 2nd  player.  The argument  MONEY will
  change the money of both players.   Thats all, no the parameter GUI
  or MUI will start the GUI, using MUI, see also WB.
  With LOAD and SAVE you can save and load the game. See Load/Save.


WorkBench:
  To use the GUI you need at least MUI3.  The GUI is self declaratory
  (I hope so).  You could make the same like with the CLI-parameters.
  If you have started  TA-Hack  from CLI with the GUI parameter, only
  the FILE/NAME and  FORCE option will be supported,  all others will
  be ignored.  From WB it is'nt possible to specify any option.
  The Load  and the Save  button are equialent to the CLI-parameters.
  See Load/Save for more details.


Load/Save:
  This is only a very dirty trick, but it does.
  To save the game TA-Hack  saves only all hunks of TA to disk.  This
  will not work, if you have left TA,  because than the Hunks will be
  placed  to  another position in memory,  and all the addresses,  TA
  have stored in, are bad. Only with the FORCE-switch you could force
  TA-Hack to  load such a file.  If the length of the saved hunks and
  the hunks in memory are different, it is'nt possible to load.
  If TA-Hack could'nt identify TA corecctly, you could only FORCE him
  to do load/save.
  With the option FILE or NAME you  can specify the file to load/save
  to. The default is "AB.save" in the current dir.


Disclaimer:
  I gurantee for nothing!

For Hackers only:
  Look for the TA-Process, into the 2nd Hunk (try scout).
