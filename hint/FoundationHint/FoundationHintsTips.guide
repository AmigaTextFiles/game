 What is Foundation?
 -------------------

Foundation is a strategy game based in a fantasy world full of magic and war. You
control a race of people brought together from different times in history. The aim:
to be victorious over your enemies by taking over the land.

The gameplay of Foundation could be described as a cross between The Settlers,
Warcraft and Megalomania - containing the best elements of each to make a truely
magnificant game.  Recent game surveys have shown this game to be the most
anticipated Amiga game this year!

 What is this Guide?
 -------------------

This is a AmigaGuide document for the game @{b}Foundation@{ub} and it has 3
purposes:

1) To give users some insight into playing the game Foundation by providing the game
manual in Amigaguide form (Goto the link @{" Game Manual " link manual}).

2) To give users some hints and tips into utilising resources correctly and
generally becoming more efficient in the game (Goto the link @{" HINTS AND TIPS " link
HINTS}).

3) To provide players with an insight into game facts and figures (Goto the link
@{" Technical Info " link buff}).

Note: If you think you know all there is to know about Foundation because
you've played games like The Settlers or Warcraft, then you will not get very
far in the game.  Foundation has many features which each of these games do not
have. Take some time to learn them by reading this guide.

 Foundation HINTS AND TIPS
 -------------------------

 If any of you out there are like me, you will have struggled a little in
the 3 levels supplied with the Foundation demo. Much of the trouble I had was
because I made many assumptions about the game. These came about because of
playing games like Warcraft II and I automatically assumed the same for
Foundation.  This is NOT true, as Foundation is far more detailed in the
creating and running of your settlement.

This guide will you information on the playing of the game, and will also
unravel some of the many hidden features within Foundation.  Follow the links
below for the relevant hints & tips about the game.

@node starting "Starting Out - Basic tips when starting levels in Foundation

Hints & Tips for when Starting out
----------------------------------

Before you really start building anything, its a good idea to check out what
each building does (see the documentation section).  If you dont, you will very
likely end up with a lot of buildings with no people and no resources.  The
following is a simple guide for starting out your levels.  Click on the headings
for more information on each step.


 1 @{" Make your first building a MINE      " link starting1}

 2 @{" Next build a FORESTERS HUT           " link starting2}

 3 @{" Build a LABORATORY or PEASANTS HUT   " link starting3}

 4 @{" Check Water & Food supplies          " link starting4}

 5 @{" Create remaining Important Buildings " link starting5}


 When you have all of the above items, I would then check the statistics to see
if there are any problems or shortages. It's a good idea to check your
buildings and turn off any resources that are not so important at this stage.
You'll rarely need more than 20 OIL at any time and the WHEAT is not so
important at this early stage.  Turning these elements off will speed up the
production of the more important buildings. I would also use this early stage
to ensure that all of my people have got to their destinations.  It's possible
that the Maidens can't get out to the Peasant hut because there is too much
resource distribution to deal with first. At his point you can use the Quick
Orders panel to gather up enough Maidens to fill the Peasant hut(s) and enough
Scientists to fill the Laboratory.

Remember that your population will probably grow, and one WATERPUMP or FARM may not
be enough to feed everyone and keep them happy and healthy. Your peasants will work
till they drop, even without food. Therefore it is important that you try and keep
them relatively well fed and watered.

@endnode

@node starting1 "First Build a mine"

This mine would produce most of the important resources used in any game. The
production of stone is one of the most important, but there is also a need for Oil
if you are going to start inventing.  The mine can also start collecting Ore and
Coal ready for making your Steel and Gold.
@endnode

@node starting2 "Now build a Foresters Hut"

The Foresters Hut will give the third important Resource for building.  When you
choose a place to build your Foresters hut it may be a good idea to choose a
spot where there are lots of trees.  When you build on top of a group of trees
they will automaticaly be harvested and so you may be able to gather up some
free Wood.

You will notice that no food buildings have been made yet.  This is because it
is always more important to ensure a healthy production of building resources
before you start building up the food group buildings.

@endnode

@node starting3 "Build a LABORATORY or PEASANTS HUT"

Depending on how important population or technology will be in the game, it may
be a good idea to build a Laboratory or a Peasants hut.  For a battle based
Mission you may choose to build a Peasants hut at this moment in time.  If you
prefer to take the slower and more technical approach then a Laboratory is a
good move.

@endnode

@node starting4 "Check water and food supplies"

Next up check the level of food and water.  If you have less than 30 units of
food or less than 20 units of water then it would be wise to build a Pumphouse
or a Farm at this stage.

@endnode

@node starting5 "Build remaining important buildings"

The next step should be the creation of any important buildings that have yet to
be built.  A Refinary is a good move (to produce GOLD and STEEL) and also the
Peasant hut, Farm and Pumphouse.

@endnode

@node attacking "Lets go burn & pillage!"

 Tips for burnin' & lootin'!
 ---------------------------

So far Ive found that a very enjoyable part of Foundation is attacking the
enemy.  But it usually isnt easy to be 'successful' in disabling or removing the
enemy from the game. It is easy to loose many of your people without having any
profound effect on the enemy at all, as many of you will have found out. This
section contains 3 parts - Burning, Stealing & (I cant htink of the word -
taking over an enemies' building)

@{" Tips on  BURNING " link burning} - Remove the enemies' buildings
@{" Tips on STEALING " link stealing} - Take resources from the enemy buildings
@{" Taking BUILDINGS " link take_building} - Steal enemy buildings!
 
@endnode

@node burning

 Burning the enemy buildings
 ---------------------------

The main problem that arises with burning down enemy buildings is that the enemy
will try and stop you from doing it by attacking your players in their
territory. If there are enemy knights occupying the enemy buildings in the
vicinity you are in, they will normally come out andd attack your player - which
in this case, will be a peasant carrying oil to burn down some buildings.

The WRONG way to try and remove enemy buildings is to send in a group of
peasants directly to the building you want to destroy. More often than not, all
your peasants will be killed by knights/other peasants, and you will have
inflicted very little damage to any buildings. Sometimes you will be lucky and
the enemy wont have any spare knights to attack you with. But it is risky
business to try.

A BETTER way is to take one or two peasants into the enemy territory, attacking
and lighting fires to as many buildings as possible. When your peasants are
walking around, it seems easier to run from knights than if you were
concentrating on one particular building. It seems that it is best to burn
several buildings before moving onto the building you want destroyed. It is
normally much easier to burn down buildings that are close to their territorial
line. This is probably becuase the knights will not attack your peasants until
you are in their territory. Therefore you can sneak a peasant across the border,
burn a building, and retreat.

The spin-off of burning several buildings at once, is that the enemy wizards
cant come and put them all out at once. If you burn as many of the enemy
buildings as you can at any one time, the chances are that at least some of them
wont be put out, and you will succeed in removing enemy buildings.


@endnode

@node stealing "Pillaging the enemy's camps!"

 Tips for Stealing
 -----------------

If you wanna annoy the other players, there is no better way than stealing from
them. For some reason, people get annoyed when they notice a couple of enemy
peasants sneaking away from their buildings.

Like the process of burning, try and steal from buildings close to the enemy
border. This wil increase the chances fof your peasants getting away with the
goods' unattacked.

Also try sending in a WHOLE LOT of peasants, takling as much as you can in one
hit. This should work well if you have plenty of people to spare, and you are
low on resources. Some should make it back alive.

@endnode

@node advanced "Tips for Improving your gameplay"

 Tips for improving your gameplay
 --------------------------------

Tip #1: Try and keep your people INSIDE a building. If they are outide, they
will lose health because they have no food to eat.

Tip #2: Try to keep your population level UNDER CONTROL. A population of around
200-250 will most likely be the most efficient level for most circumstances. If
you have too many peasants, you will need more food, and more water, and more
peasants to get the food and water..... So keep the population DOWN and you will
find you can comfortable supply everyone with what they need.

Tip #3: Do not overuse the speed-time functions. You can do productive almost
all of the time. Speeding up time while you are doing 'housework' enables the
enemies to become stronger, faster. Be wary of this feature.

Tip #4: If you are runing short of peasants, check your wood levels. If you have
enough wood to get by, reduce the number of WORKERS in the forestors hut to one or
two. This will reduce the number of forestors required and you will end up with
extra peasants to send elsewhere.


@endnode

@node buff "Technical info on the game"

 Techinical info section
 -----------------------

This section contains detail on various aspects of the game FOUNDATION.

@{b}Reproduction: @{ub}Reproduction occurs in two places - in the Castle and the Peasant
Huts. The reproductive ratio depends upon the NUMBER of FEMALES you have left.
For example:

 1 female  left:   1:0 female/male ratio
 2 females left:  1:1 female/male ratio
 3 females left:  1:2 female/male ratio
 ...
 20 females left: 1:19 female/male ratio

The birthrate is TWICE as high in the peasant huts than in the HQ.
The birthrate is higher if there are more males in a building (up to a point).
Maidens give birth up to the age of 55.
Maidens are only capable of reproducing if their morale is greater than 50%.

@{b}Maximum number of buildings@{ub}: 1200 (subject to change)

@{b}Peasant life span@{ub}: If kept healthy, peasants live to around 60-70 years. If
they are unhealthy, they will probably not live to 60 years. And if peasant morale
is low, it is likely that they will start committing suicide.

@{b}Food@{ub}: Food increases the amount of energy a person has. Each person eats the
same amount of food, and looses 5% energy each year. Once the energy level of a
person drops below 80%, they will look for food to eat. The choice of food is
random, and is made from the menu of a particular building. If the chosen food is
not there, the person will go without food for another year. This means that a
building with only say half the food items available will force the occupeants to go
without food quite often. So it is best to try and keep all food items in stock in a
building, although it is not neccesary. Each time a person eats, it increases their
energy by 20%. The only exception is a hospital, where the food increases the energy
by 40%.

@{b}Wine@{ub}: Like food, wine increases energy, but only by 15%. It also increases a
persons morale.

@{b}Travelling Speeds@{ub}:

Peasants/Maidens/Wizards generaly walk at speed 2
Guards, Knights and Archers walk at speed 3
Black Knights walk at speed 4

The percentage of energy and morale will affect these speeds.

@{b}Relative strengths@{ub}: It will take about 3 healthy peasants to kill a healthy knight.

@node manual1 "System Requirements"

1. System Requirements.

Foundation requires a 2Meg AGA equipped Amiga (e.g.. A1200) The game has been
aimed towards a 68030 based Amiga as minimum but a bare A1200 is enough to
run the game at an acceptable speed. The RTG version will need a CyberGFX/P96
supported graphics card and at least 6Meg of memory. The graphics car will
also have to deal with quite a large amount of inboard data so 4Meg Video
ram is recommended for hires screens. It is recommended that an 040/40 is
a good standard for the RTG version.

Extra memory is also helpful as it reduces the amount of disk access
during the game. Users with only 2Meg of memory will find the game
will access the disk very frequently. While the game does use it's own
cache system it is recommended that you use a dedicated cache program for
better support and flexibility not to mention speed.

2. Installation

The game will run from any location on a Hard Drive and there is

no point in discussing the instillation of the demo at this stage
because there will be many demo updates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node manual3 "Game Description"

3. Game description.

Story
-----
(The storyline is not yet included)
The general story of the game is based on a fantasy world where people from
all times in history have been gathered up by an unknown force to experience the
aspects of life they enjoyed most or parts of life they wish they had been
able to play while they were alive. An example of this is Albert Einstein
who was tired of knowing how the universe worked so he wanted nothing more
than to play about with magic and wizardry. For some reason the world of
Foundation is full of Amiga users who seem to be just so keen to play out
their fantasies that they have always dreamed of.
(the full story will be continued....)

Basic Gameplay ideas.

Take control over your people. Explore the land and build the necessary
buildings to provide extra food and resources. Complete the mission which
may involve destroying the other teams or any number of set missions
including take control over 80% of the land and so on.

The Main Screen.
----------------

The main screen is split into 5 main sections:-

  ,----,---------- b -------,
  | a  |--------------------|
  |----|                    |
  |    |                    |
  | e  |           c        |
  |----|                    |
  |    |                    |
  |    |--------------------|
  '----'-----------d--------'

  a> The Small Map.

  This shows the current view position on the Map and provides a way to
  quickly move your view. It also shows you the areas that have been
  explored. Clicking the small map with the right button will bring up
  the large Map Window. The buttons on the side of the small map are as
  follows:-

  Game Speed        This allows you to switch from normal/fast Game speed.
  Read Messages.    This icon will flash when you have any messages. 
  Building Spaces   This will show you all the available "plots" for
                    building.
  Statistics.       This is a quick was to access the Statistics panel.
  Ideas.            This icon will flash when you have any new ideas.

  b> The Status Panel.

  This shows the date and current Technology level for your people. It is also
  used as an area to type messages. Using the 'Enter' key you can go into the
  Message mode which is most useful in multiplayer network mode. It also provides
  a traditional means of entering Cheats but that sort of thing would never be
  dreamt of in this game...

  c> The View area.

  This is where all the action can be viewed. It is here where you can
  point and select your people/buildings. This view is used for almost
  all of your game control. You can resize the Game View using the F1-F2
  keys. Making the view size smaller will speed up the game on slower
  machines.

  d> The Resources Panel.

  Here you can keep watch on some of your resources. Using the slider
  arrows you can cycle through and gain an instant information on any of
  your resources. The figure shown is the amount of resources/people
  you have in your Headquarters and your Warehouses. You may have more
  resources in your other buildings but this value shows the amount of
  spare/unused elements you have.

  e> The Control Panel.
  
  This panel is where all the statistics and game control can be accessed.
  If you have selected a building or any of your people, you can then issue
  orders or alter the settings for you buildings. From the icon panels you
  can also set up your trading and many other game controls. The Control
  panel together with the View Area is where the whole game is controlled.
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node manual4 "Resources Descriptions"

4. Resources Descriptions.

  Resources are split into 2 main groups.

  1> Materials.
  2> Food.

  Here is a full description of the materials group.

  Gold.

  Used as a basic currency for buying and selling goods. It is also
  used in the training of soldiers, Wizards and Scientists. Another use
  for gold is in the payment of repairs to your buildings. It is good
  to keep a good supply of gold for any emergencies.

  Wood and Stone.

  Two of the most basic building materials. The Stone can be mined or you
  could also use your Stone Mason to recover Stone from around the land.
  The wood is taken from the forestry and so it is good to keep your
  Foresters active at all times.

  Coal.

  Used in the refinery to create Gold and Steel. Also used in the
  process of making armour.

  Steel.

  Used to create Armour and sometimes as a building material.

  Ore.

  The Ore is broken down in the refinery to form Gold and Steel.

  Water.

  A very important resource. Used for refreshing your people in
  it's basic form and used in the Brewery to create Wine. The water
  is also used by some buildings as part of production.

  Oil.

  Used in the Laboratory as a part of experiments and it is also used
  by the Peasants to set fire to buildings. Without this element you
  will not be able to develop new technologies and the torch building
  command will not be available.

  Armour.

  Sometimes used in the Building process to create strong forts. It
  is also used in the process of training Soldiers and upgrading your
  troops.

  Magic.

  Used by the Wizards to create buildings, trees and other Wizard type
  activities. Without Magic the world of Foundation will come out of your
  control and you will become defenceless to attacks such as fire.

  Ideas.

  The Idea element is really just a Blue Print or scroll containing
  the new ideas from the scientists. As soon as the Idea arrives in
  Storage, it can be used to upgrade your technology in the form of
  a new building or upgrades.

  Cross

  The Cross is the symbol of the Soul. When a member of your team dies
  the Cross will appear as the last remains.

  And the foods group...

  Bread, Meat, Wheat, Wine, Vegetables, Fruit, Fish

  All foods work in the same way but certain activities require different
  groups of food. The soldiers working in the forts will enjoy eating
  Bread and Wine while the scientists like to eat Fish and Vegetables while
  they are working.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node manual5 "Unit Descriptions"

5. Unit Descriptions.

  People/Units are split into two groups.

  1> Working Units.
  2> Fighting Units.

  First to explain the working Units.

  The Peasant.

  This is your most important Unit. The Peasant can be used for many tasks
  such as mining, fishing and farming. They are used to transport resources
  about your land. The Peasant can take on most jobs in your kingdom and
  once trained they can be upgraded to become higher level Units.

  The Maiden.

  Another important Unit. Without the Maiden your people cannot reproduce
  and your numbers will soon shrink. The Maiden provides you with fresh
  blood and a good supply of Maidens is needed in order for you to generate
  a large healthy band of people. For your people to breed and reproduce
  you will need to give them some privacy. The Headquarters is not the best
  place to raise a family but it is possible. The newborn people in the
  world of Foundation have the ability to work in the same way as the
  older people. While the soul of the character is 1 year old he will still
  have the ability to work in the same way as older characters. In the world
  of Foundation you take on the character rather than the character taking
  on you.

  The Wizard.

  The Wizards are highly trained in the use of Magic. For many years they
  have replaced the Peasants skills in the area of Building and transforming
  the land. With a good supply of magic they can provide you with all the
  buildings you require. You will still need to provide the necessary
  resources for building but the use of Magic has speeded up the process
  of building and indeed the removal of buildings. The Wizards jobs have
  become more difficult in time and they are starting to become lost with
  the traditional roles of Wizardry. Maybe this is why many Wizards are
  turning to the more exciting activities of war.

  The Scientist.

  Without science you cannot expand your technologies and your enemies
  will soon surpass your knowledge. With a good team of scientists you
  can create a good flow of fresh ideas that will keep you ahead of your
  opposition. The Scientists can also give you some much needed advice
  on how to improve your status and provide important upgrades to your
  buildings. Scientists are also the key to discovering cures to any health
  problems that can arise with overcrowding and the problems of war.

  The Soldier/Guard.

  Every building in your land will have room for at least one Guard.
  If you have a guard in a building it will protect you from internal
  attacks. When the guard has served enough time and he has proved
  himself in his work he will be promoted to a Knight.

  The Knight

  The knight is a powerful fighter. He is strong and brave but he is not
  happy to be reduced to the lower ranks of a Guard. He will happily serve
  to your demands on the battlefield an after he has reached a high level
  of experience he will be promoted to Black Knight.

  The Black Knight

  The strongest of all fighting units. He will usually survive until his
  days are over and he has the power to protect himself from most attackers.
  He is immune to the arrows of the archer and it is rare for a Peasant to
  be brave enough to approach him.

  The Archer

  The archers are known to be cowardly people. They like to keep away
  from any trouble but if you give them enough distance they can usually
  take out targets quickly and safely. Being a cowardly group they enjoy
  nothing more than to live in the safety of the Archers Tower where
  they are safe from even the weakest of peasant attackers. Their biggest
  fear is the power of the Black Knights who enjoy using their immunity
  of arrows to scare the life out of the Archers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

@endnode
@node manual6 "Building Descriptions"

6. Building Descriptions.

  Headquarters.

  The Headquarters is used as storage for resources and people. It is also
  the home of your good self so it is important that you protect it against
  the enemy. Storage space is limited so you will probably need to build
  at least one Warehouse to store a large bulk of your goods. If this
  building is lost then the game is over.
  
  Mines.

  Important building for the collection of Stone, Ore, Coal and Oil.

  Farmhouse.

  Important building for the creation of Wheat, Fruit and Vegetables.

  Warehouse.

  This is a very important building. Without the Warehouse you may find
  that resources and people are delayed in the process of leaving your
  Headquarters. Does the modern day problem of Bandwidth sound familiar?
  Don't underestimate the usefulness of this Building.

  Armoury.

  The place where your Steel is turned into Armour which is the important
  resource of War.

  Pump House.

  The all important Water source. Without water you can expect to see many
  health problems.

  Wizard Hut.

  While this was initially a place for Wizards to keep themselves to
  themselves, this building has become a good place for Wizards to
  train for higher levels.

  Peasant Hut.

  A nice peaceful building which gives the Maidens the privacy they
  need and it also stops the Headquarters from becoming too overcrowded.

  Forester.

  The source of your wood collection. Your forester will happily collect
  up the wood from the surrounding trees. As the wood is collected it is
  also distributed about the local buildings.

  Stone Mason.

  The Stone mason will search the land for rocks. This is probably the
  best source of stone you will have.

  Refinery.

  This is yet another all important building where your Ore is refined
  to become Gold and Steel.

  Fishery.

  Most of the time you will have plenty of water to allow you to fish for
  this vital food item. The Fishery must be built close to the sea or
  lakes. The Fishermen are often too lazy to leave their warm hut but
  when the sun comes out you can sometimes see them lining up and going
  about their business.

  Crematorium.

  This is where the last remains of your people (the cross) can be refined
  to become a single element of Magic. The magic is then used to aid
  you in your future developments.

  Laboratory.

  The important base for advancing technology. This is where your Scientist
  will be housed and provided with the resources to develop new technologies
  and any other helpful advances to aid you on your mission.

  Bakery.

  This is where the Bread is formed from the Wheat and Water. While it
  is possible to live without the Bread it is worth providing it to
  improve the diet of your people.

  Brewery.

  The Wine is not the most healthy food source but it helps to keep your
  people happy. Using the Brewery you can provide this popular beverage.
  It is possible to live without this Food type but if your Population
  get unhappy you may be forced to provide them with this building. Keep
  a close watch on the morale of your people.

  Food Factory.

  Modern day living has inspired the use of a simple one building for
  everything approach to creating food. This is the easiest way to
  provide a good range of food but it is also the most expensive method
  so keep a watch on your Gold supplies.

  Barracks.

  The important place to train your people. You can train your Peasants
  in here to become soldiers. That will cost you one Gold and one Armour.
  You can also train Scientists and Wizards who each cost one Gold to
  train.

  Hospital

  The Hospital works in a similar way to the Warehouse. It acts as a
  storage of people and food. There are some important differences. First
  of all the food combined with the healthy living will allow your people
  to recover quickly. If you have many Peasants in the Hospital and you
  request for a Peasant to leave the building then the most healthy
  Peasant will leave first. Any time during the game you find a sick
  person you should always send him/her to the Hospital to recover. If
  the building becomes overcrowded then some healthy people will leave
  to make room for the sick.

  (many more buildings to be added)

@node manual7 "General Game Play"

7. General Game Play

  Summon your people.

  The first task you must learn is that of commanding your people to leave
  a building. This is done in two main ways. The easiest method is using
  the Quick Orders panel. You can call up this panel by clicking in an empty
  space in the play area. The Quick Orders panel will show you how many
  spare people you have in your Warehouse or Headquarters. Selecting one of
  these people will command that character to leave his home and walk to
  your chosen location. See the detailed description of the Quick Orders
  panel for more information.

  Another way to command a person to leave a building is via the Occupants
  panel. You can call this panel up by selecting the same building twice.
  There is also an Occupants button in most building panels. The Occupants
  panel will provide you with a simple list of the people in the current
  building and it is possible to select any one of these and command him
  to leave using the leave building button. See the detailed description
  of the Occupants panel for more information.

  Create a new building.

  Creating buildings is quick an easy. You must first choose a suitable
  location on the play area. The first click will bring up the Quick Orders
  panel but a second click with bring up the Choose Building Panel. You
  must now select the building you require. You must have enough of the
  necessary resources to be able to select the building and you must be
  in a valid location. The Mine for example must be on high ground where
  the rock landscape is found. The Pumphouse building must be at low
  altitude where the ground is soft. You can't build in areas that are
  not fully explored.

  One you have chosen a building to create you will be given a Foundation
  and a Wizard will soon arrive to Magic the building in place. If you
  do not have enough Magic in storage then this stage will be have to
  be delayed.


  General Housekeeping

  Most building are put into one of two groups. There are the Storage
  buildings which are used to store people and resources. Examples of
  these buildings are the Headquarters, Warehouse and the Hospital. Each
  building of this type can be given a desired level of each element or
  person. This will let you build a Warehouse with a specific use for
  example you could build a Warehouse close to your mines, refineries
  and your Armoury. This building could then be given the desired levels
  for each element. For this example we could presume that only the
  Coal, Ore, Water, Peasants and a small amount of food was given a
  desired level of 20 each. All of the other elements could be reset to
  Zero which would mean that all the Armour, Stone, Oil and Gold that
  was made in his area would be taken to the Headquarters while the elements
  that are useful to these buildings were stored in good quantities.
  It is also advised to keep the level of Soldiers to a good amount to
  protect the Warehouse as well as the nearby areas.

  The other building work in a different way. They have a very much more
  restricted design with three types of contents. The small area on the
  left if the food group. This gives enough room for three types of food
  an there is room one of each item. The upper level of storage is the
  materials and workers group. These are the people who work/live in the
  building and also the place where materials are kept. The Refinery would
  have Coal and Ore as its materials along with a number of peasant workers
  and also a Guard. The lower section is the output group. This is where
  the resources are created ready to be taken out to a place of need.
  Together with the output elements there is also a space for the Cross
  which is where the workers will end up if they don't get enough food
  and healthy living.

  The input group can be changed to fit your needs so if you are running
  short on peasants then you can choose to only have one Peasant worker.
  If you only want to make a small slow supply of Bread then you could
  give the Bakery a level of one Wheat.

  The output group is not always restricted to resources. The Barracks
  has an output group that contains Wizards, Soldiers and Archers. These
  output people are trained from the Peasants. The output group can be
  altered to suit your needs. If you find you need to train 4 Scientists
  then you can set the level of scientists to 4 and that is how many you
  will get. You can set the level to "Full" and the Barracks will train
  your Scientists until you turn it off. This feature is also useful
  if you have 3 mines and you don't need much Oil. You can turn off
  the Oil on two mines which will give them more time to create other
  resources. Maybe you have a large group of Stone Mason buildings and
  you would like to turn of Stone mining altogether.

  Food and Health

  You will have to provide enough food for you people and you must also
  ensure that there is enough variety to suit the needs of each person
  in each job the take on. It has already been mentioned that those
  Peasants working in the mine will require a different diet to the
  Scientists working in the laboratory. Each building can contain 3
  items of food. The Storage buildings usually contain the full range
  of food and it is usually in plenty supply. While your people are
  busy working in the buildings they may decide to eat. At his point
  they decide exactly which piece of food they require from the menu in
  that particular building. If that piece of food is not available they
  will go without food for that period of time. They will loose some
  energy and they will also loose some of their morale. At the next
  opportunity for food they may choose a different item and so it is
  possible to keep a building supplied with just one of the three items
  on the menu but this is not the best way to keep your people happy.
  If your people become unhealthy they will not reproduce and they will
  become easy targets for attackers. If they become too unhappy then they
  may start to disobey orders and generally become inefficient and
  worthless. This it is not essential to provide a full range of food
  it is recommended to attempt to supply as much as you can whenever
  possible.

  Guards

  Every building will contain at least one space for a Guard. It is
  good to keep someone guarding your buildings because without a guard
  you are open for a takeover. Without a guard it is possible for an
  enemy team to enter the building at will. When there are enemy people
  in the building it usually turns into a fight and the strongest
  group will take control. While you building is guarded you are still
  subject to thieves. If a Peasant does make his way into your building
  he will still be subject to attack by your occupants and for this
  reason the thieves usually make a quick escape as soon as possible.

  More Magic

  The Magic is a useful element in the world of Foundation. It is not only
  the commonly used system of building but it is also used for landscaping.
  At any time you can command your Wizard to create some fresh trees and
  fresh rocks. The rocks are a good source of Coal and Ore but the most
  common rocks are made of pure Stone. Once the Stone Mason or the Forester
  have taken their supplied the Magic will soon wear off. The source of
  the Magic is the Crematorium. This special building will turn the last
  remains of your people into fresh Magic. This gives you an almost endless
  supply of Magic to last you for as long as you continue to have a
  population.

  Control your People.

  The control system for organizing your people and issuing commands
  is a very simple one but from a simple method you have a very complex
  array of commands ready for controlling your populous.

  The first lesson to learn is the select. This is done by clicking the
  mouse in an empty area of the world with thew Left Mouse Button (LMB)
  and dragging the pointer across the View area to form a box on the
  screen. When you release the mouse the system will check to see if
  there were any people in that area when you released the mouse. Any
  people that were inside the box during hat time will become selected
  and they will form a group. It is quite possible that your group could
  contain just one person but it may also contain a large army. Another
  trick to learn is the SHIFT select option which will allow you to add
  more people to the group. The SHIFT grab system will give you the added
  bonus of removing selected people from the group.

  Now you have a group selected you are able to issue commands. The most
  basic of these is the MOVE command. The MOVE command is issued using
  the Right Mouse Button (RMB) to click in an area on the playfield. Now
  your whole group will start their journey to your selected location.
  When they arrive you will see they are waiting for your next command.
  The MOVE command is the most useful command of them all. It gives you
  the power to direct any of your people to go to any valid destination.
  The destination doesn't have to be an outside location. You can also
  command your people to enter buildings. If you send a person into a
  building it will then become his home. This is where he will stay until
  you command him to another place. If this building is a production
  building (for example a Mine) then he will start to work here and
  possibly take part in delivering goods to other buildings. This is
  where he will spend the rest of his days unless you command him to
  move somewhere else. If you alter the settings for his home and it
  removes the need for his presence then he will then return to a nearby
  Stores building where he will remain until your next commands.

@node manual8 "The Control Panels"

8. The Control Panels.

  A lot of the game is controlled from a wide range of control panels. They
  provide Statistics as well as an interface to control your world in
  every last detail.

  The Main Panel

  The First Panel you see is known as the Main Panel. From here you can
  access all of the other Panels. The Main Panel also shows some of the
  most important Game statistics. The Statistics are as follows...

  Population - The amount of People in your whole team. This includes every
               type of person including Peasants and Knights.
  Buildings  - The Amount of Buildings you have.
  Gold       - The most valuable element. The Gold is a good resource to
               have because it can pay for Training soldiers, repairing
               buildings and it is also a valuable element to trade with.
  Production - A level describing the percentage of resources you are
               making against the resources needed.
  Land       - The amount of land you control. This is the amount of land
               that you are controlling with buildings. Any wide open areas
               of land with no buildings is free from control.

  There are also 6 important buttons on the Main Panel. From here you can
  access the other panels. These buttons are...

  Selected Building - When this button is available it will take you to a
                      panel that has all the information about the
                      currently selected building.
  Selected People   - When this button is active it will allow you to
                      see and control your selected people in great detail.
  Resources         - This will display a Global Storage panel which will
                      give you a detailed run down of how many of each
                      resource you have in your Storage buildings.
  Trading           - From the trading panel you can setup trades with
                      other players for resources you need. Alternatively
                      you can also set up direct Stock Exchange which is
                      an instant exchange. The Stock exchange does not
                      give you as much value as a proper trade. (detailed
                      Trading info to be added further on)
  Statistics        - This will take you to the second most important panel
                      the control of the statistics and in-game preferences
                      is an important part of your play.
  Game Options      - The Game options panel gives you general information
                      about the game an the mission. It also allows you to
                      save and load games. You can also find the Quit
                      option in the Game Options panel.

  The Statistics panel is packed with buttons that will led you to vital
  information to aid you in your game.

  Input and Output

  This panel will display the amount of resources comming in and the amount
  going out. When you see a Red bar chart it means you are losing more of
  that resource than you are making. If you see a Green bar then you are safe
  knowing that you're making more than you are using. If the Green bar is
  filling the full scale of the chart then you should consider slowing
  down the prediction. If however the Red bar is filling the scale then
  you should check for improving the production of this item. If you select
  one of these elements with a mouse click it will take you through a short-cut
  to the next panel.

  Production Chart

  Here you will see a simple production chart for each element. This is
  where you can predict any sharp changes in resource usage and attempt
  to avoid a situation where you're making too much or too little of one
  element.

  Building Count

  Here is a simple display showing how many of each building you have
  created. This will allow you to make a quick calculation of the
  building you may need to create next.

  Death Reports

  To aid you in the process of cutting down on the number of casualties
  it is useful to see the causes of the recent deaths. A quick glance
  at the last 4 deaths can often give you a clue to what can be done to
  improve your populations life expectancy. There is a small cycle
  gadget at the bottom of the panel that will take you to a 2nd Death
  statistic screen. The Popular Deaths chart will display the most
  frequent causes of Death. This is an extra help in discovering problems
  with health and other troubles.

  Production Priority

  Here you can arrange the various elements in order of need. If you have
  many Farms you can decide which food you prefer to make. An item with
  a higher priority will be produced more often than a lower priority
  element. The Production priority has another use. When you send a
  Peasant into an enemy building he will leave the building with some
  stolen goods. The preference of goods to steal is based on the Production
  Priority.

  Transport Priority.

  People and resources must be moved from place to place. This is usually
  done without any external control. It would be impossible to control
  100 people working in 20 buildings moving various resources from one
  place to another. This is all taken care of by the people who work
  in the different buildings. While you are always free to take control
  over a person at any time and command him to do something you want him
  to do, it is still very useful to let them get on with it. Quite often
  a building will contain many different items and many different people.
  Only so much can be removed from a building at any time and sometimes
  there are less people to carry the resources than you need so some form
  of preference must be done. This is what the Transport priority is for.
  The Resources always come ahead of the people in the Priority list so
  quite often you will see Peasants leaving a building before a Knight,
  even though the Knight may be above the Peasant in the Priority. This
  is because the Peasant is moving an important high Priority resource
  which gives him the advantage over a Knight.

  The Mission Status.

  This Panel will show you a simple chart with the current percentage of
  Mission Completed. You can sometimes see the progress of the other
  teams but quite often in a Conquest Game you will be the only team
  taking part in the Mission. Nonetheless you can still use this
  Panel to keep watch on your progress.

  The Best & Worst Panel.

  This is a simple but effective statistic panel. At a quick glance
  you can see which elements you have 100 much of and which elements
  you have too little of. The Percentage is calculated by taking
  the current population and generating some ideal figures for each
  element. A figure of 200% would indicate that you have two times
  the recommended amount at this current stage in the game while a
  figure of 50% means you need to double the production of this type.

  Multi Statistics.

  This is where you get some comparisons between each of the players in
  the current game. you can see just how effective your last attack
  was or you can get an idea of how stable the other teams are with
  figures like land ownership, Gold reserve and Army size. Here is
  a description of the options from left to right.

  Population     - The level of population based on all of your people
                   including your Knights, Peasants and Wizards.
  Army           - This a is based on the amount of Fighting Units you
                   have. This includes Guards, Knights and Archers.
  Production     - The level of resources you are creating. This uses
                   elements such as Coal, Gold, Food and Water.
  Land Ownership - The amount of land you control.
  Gold           - Simply a level of Gold.
  Buildings      - The numbers of building owned.
  Technology     - The current Tech. level.
  Everything     - A figure based on the average of all other statistics.

That is all for now... I'll update this manual on a daily basis and future
versions of the Foundation Demo will contain the most up-to-date manual. I
will upload this manual to the http://www.sneech.demon.co.uk/FoundDemo.html
