          This is a very simple task, but I will describe it step by step
          anyway.

          1. Unarchive the AB3-LCG archive (which you already have done).

          2. Put the AB3-LCG directory wherever you like.

          3. Rename the version you intend to use to AB3-LCG.

             AB3-LCG is programmed in AmosPro and can therefor either have
             the Amos.library 2.00 included or shared.
             The library is not included in this archive.
             Use AB3-LCG if you don't have Amos.library installed
             or AB3-LCG_nolib if you do have it.

          4. Doubleclick on the icon and go!

          This is quite self-explaining, so I won't waste too many bytes on
          this.

          The GUI consists of two seperate fields. One for player equipment
          and one for general data.


          Player Equipment:

          Lifes: Enter the ammount of lifes for player 1 and 2 in the
                 appropriate box or use the sliders.

          Keys:  Enter the ammount of keyes for player 1 and 2 in the
                 appropriate box or use the sliders.

          Weaponry: Use the cyclegadgets to select the level of each
                    weapon for both players.


          General Data:

          Location: Use the cyclegadget to select which tower to enter.

          Level: Click a checkbox to choose towerlevel.

          Entrance: Each level can have several entrances. Click a checkbox
                    to choose entrance. The centergadget is for elevators.

          Credits: Enter the ammount of credits in the box or use the
                   slider. The maximum is 255,000 credits.


          Other gadgets:

          Print: Prints the levelcode and armoury on paper. Some extended
                 information is available.

          All to Max: Sets all values to their maximum.

          Iconify: Iconifies AB3-LCG. Click the closegadget in the
                   iconified window to uniconify.

          Quit: Guess what!!


          Other textzones:

          Levelcodes for 1-playergame and 2-playergame will be displayed
          in the lower left corner.

          AB3-LCG was programmed by @{" me " link "Me" 0} in September 1996.

          I used AmosPro 2.0 utilising Pietro Ghizzoni's GUI-extension
          and the GUI-patched version of AmosPro-Compiler.

          I got the idee when I got hold of Stefan Greifenberg's text
          about the AB3 levelcode. His work is very good, but is now
          obsolete. I have cracked the code into the smallest fragments
          so it would be easy to use in a program.  But it's still
          thanks to him I was able to make this.

          I can't be held responsible for any damage to your system AB3-LCG
          might cause. There is no danger, since it's only a GUI. If
          something should happen when you use AB3-LCG, then don't blame me.
          You use it on your own risk.

          This software is Mailware which means that you must send me an
          E-mail or a postcard of your town or country if you use it.
          It'd be nice to know where this proggie finds it's ways.

          This program is freely distributable as long as the archive
          is intact and unchanged. You are not allowed to change a byte
          in the archive if you're going to spread it further.

          I'd be very happy if someone included this on a collection CD-ROM,
          but please tell me first. If you contact me I will see to that
          you get the newest version to put on the CD.

          I'd appreciate if you'd let me know if there's something I've
          missed or made a misstake. Also let me know if there's any kind
          of bugs. Any suggestions that could make AB3-LCG better are
          welcomed.

          I have programmed Amos ever since it was released many years
          ago. I think it's a very good language to make good and
          userfriendly utilities.

          When I got the GUI-extension it got real easy to make fully
          multitasking intuition utils. This is not my first Amos-GUI,
          but it's the best I've done so far. Watch out for more Amos
          products from me.
