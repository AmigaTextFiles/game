Below is a transcript of the documentation that came with the save game:
NB: Not everything is applicable to this archive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file (DMGame.dat) is a Dungeon Master save file, with 4 characters
on level 1, just before the entrance to the stairs area.

All four characters are Artisan Level in Fighter, Ninja, Priest and Wizard
class, and have Health 999, Stamina 999, and Mana 512.

They all have all personal characteristics (strength, etc) of 176.

They have between them:

Samurai Sword
Axe
Mail
Hosen
Leather Jerkin
Leather Pants (2)
Leather Boots
Suede Boots
Ghi
Trousers
Pants
Tunic
Torch (1)

These Characters should make investigating the Dungeon of Anaias much
less difficult, and keep you from becoming frustrated.

You get experience for bashing doors and critters (fighters)
                       throwing things            (ninjas)
                       casting spells             (priest and wizard)

You'll get more experience for fighting creatures than for hitting doors,
and more for doing it lower down in the dungeon.

The Ability Levels in Dungeon Master are:

Neophyte
Novice
Apprentice
Journeyman
Craftsman
Artisan
Adept
Expert
LO  Master
UM  Master
ON  Master
EE  Master
PAL Master
MON Master
ArchMaster

It takes twice as much experience to reach the next level of ability
as the last level took.

For those interested, these characters were edited by creating a DM
disk with the Aux-Handler inserted into the startup sequence to create
a cli on the serial port.  using another computer, and a debug utility
(ddt) the characters are found in (fast/slow) memory, and their abilities
modified.  Levels of ability were gained by setting experience to one less
than the next level, then doing the appropriate action to gain some exp.,
letting the game do all the setting of other things attendant on level
raises.  The game was then saved normally, and the enclosed DMGame.dat
resulted.

To use this file, create a Dungeon Master Save disk (with the games
format option, or by formatting a disk with DOS with the correct name)
and copy the DMGame.dat file enclosed onto that disk.  You can now
use the "resume" option of DM to start this new group of heavy hitters.
