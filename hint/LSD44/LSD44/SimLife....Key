                             SYSTEM INFORMATION
 
                              
HARDWARE REQUIRED
 
 
AGA VERSION:
 
A1200, A4000 using Workbench 3.0 with 2 MB of RAM. A
hard drive is recommended.
 
STANDARD VERSION:
 
A500, A500+, A600, A1200, A1500, A2000, A3000, A4000 using
Workbench version 1.3 or higher with a minimum 1 MB of RAM 
although 2 MB is recommended. A hard drive is also recommended.
 
 
GENERAL INFORMATION
 
This Addendum / Quick Start Guide contains all the Amiga - specific
information to play SimLife.
 
There are two versions of SimLife for the Amiga: AGA which fully
supports A1200 and A4000 machines utilising the AGA graphics
chipset and STANDARD which supports all non AGA Amiga
machines.
 
The disks supplied have been compressed and will require
decompressions before use. If you intend to play SimLife from
floppies, please ensure that you have 3 formatted blank disks for the
game to install onto. See Installation instructions below.
 
 
NO COPY PROTECTION

SimLife is not ocpy protected. This is an experiment and a big leap
of faith for us. We are trusting you not to give away copies of this
game. Copy protection is a pain - for all of us - and we'd like to stop
using it forever, but if SimLife falls victim to piracy, then we will
revert to using protection on future products.


HIGH RESOLUTION MODE
 
If you are using the AGA version of SimLife you have the
capabilities of operating in high resolution mode if you have a
multisync monitor attached. The standard version may also be
operated in high resolution if you have a flicker fixer and 2MB or
more with a multisync monitor.
 
 
QUICK-START GUIDE INSTALLATION
 
Both AGA and STANDARD versions of the SimLife program have 
identical installation programs. To install SimLife:

    1. Insert the SimLife Disk 1 into your internal disk drive.
    2. Reset you Amiga.
    3. Follow the on screen instructions choosing graphical
       requirements and install destination (either floppy or hard disk),
       swapping disks when necessary.


STARTING THE PROGRAM

FROM HARD DISK

After installation (see above), using Workbench open the folder that
the game has been isntalled to and double-click on the SimLife icon 
to play.

FROM FLOPPY DRIVE

Insert the disk labelled `SIMLIFE1' into your internal drive and reset
your machine. The game will load automatically.


THE ON-SCREEN TUTORIAL

After starting SimLife, you will see the New Game Window. Click on
the Tutorial button, then on Play Scenario to start the On-screen
Tutorial. You will then be walked through the basics of SimLife. A
special Tutorial Menu will appear to help you navigate and access 
special Help screens.

There are two additional tutorials in the manual that will take you on
a more complete tour of SimLife and demonstrate how to design, set
up and carry out a SimLife experiment.


SPECIAL AMIGA FEATURES

Following is an explanation of any and all features and functions of
SimLife on the Amiga that weren't covered in the manual.


LOADING AND SAVING FILES

All file loading and saving is achieved through the standard Amiga
file requester. In addition, SimLife gives you the option of keeping
backup copies of the previous versions of each of these files. If you
want a backup, click in the Make Backups box in the Save File
dialogue box.


SOUNDS

Most sounds in SimLife happen in response to your actions, but there
are three sounds that occur to notify you of important events that you
might not otherwise notice.

    Oooooh - this moan is the sound of an animal dying.
    Ooh-la-la - this is the sound of animals mating.
    Fanfare - this sound announces a birth.


BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE SIMS

SimLife is a powerful simulation engine that can be put to use in a
number of different ways, both useful and silly. We've included a few
saved games on one of the disks that show some of these uses (or
abuses). Try them out. See if you can figure out what they are
and why.


DATA LOGGING

An advanced, but very useful feature in SimLife is Data Logging.
When you activeate the Data Logging... item in the Technical
Submenu of the Simulation Menu, the program will write a lot of data
to disk in a standard text file. This information can then be loaded
into a spreadsheet or other statistical program, and you can make all
the graphs and charts you could ever want.

Warning: The Data Log File can get huge. Depending on the size 
of the world and the number of plants and animals in it, this file
can take up to 100KB per year. Make sure you have the disk space.

When you activate Data Logging, you will be presented with a
dialogue box that lets you name the data file and tell the computer
where to save it.


DATA LOGGING FILE SAVING OPTIONS

In addition to the usual Amiga file saving controls, you
can set a few other options.

Append to Existing File

Sometimes you might run SimLife with Data Logging, 
take a break (to work - or better yet, play SimCity),
the come back to SimLife later. If you want to
continue Data Logging where you left off, and have
the data go into the same data file you were using
before, use the same file name and check this box.

Data Checkboxes (A.K.A. Flags)

You can choose what data to save to disk by
checking the following boxes. If you hold
down the Option key while checking a box,
they will all be checked. If you hold down
the Option key while unchecking (clearing)
a box, they will all be unchecked.

An explanation of what information each checkbox represents can be
found starting on the next page, as part of the complete description of
the Data Log file format.
 
 
DATA LOGGING FILE FORMAT

In order to make use of this data once you get it into a spreadsheet (or
other program), you'll need to know how all the data is arranged.

Each line in the data log file starts with the four-letter abbreviation, as
seen next to each checkbox, that indentifies the type of information the
line contains, followed by one or more data fields. Fields are
separated from each other by a single Tab. Lines are separated by a
Return. The first data field is the simulation time, showing the year,
day, and tick of the event being reported. On most lines, the next field
is either a species or an Orgot (an individual SimLife Organism)
identifier code, which consists of a flag indicating whether this is a plant
or an animal species, the species number and version, and specific organism if
applicable. The remaining fields are different for each message type as noted.


Type    Year.Day.Tic   Date         Time     Message
NOTE    0000.000.000   92/06/01     17:12:51 "Log started"

These are human-readable messages that report when the data log was started
or closed, as well as when a game is paused, the simulation time is reset to
zero, or a game is loaded.


Type    Year.Day.Tic   SpeciesID    Event    Message
HIST    0000.000.000   1.19.01.000  2        "Wheatgrass' has only seeds left"

All messages that appear in the History window will be recorded to the data
log as they occur.

Type    SpeciesID      Species Name
LEGN    0.00.01.000    "Elephant"

At the beginning of each data log is a legend or listing of each species
identifier and species name. This can be used as a key to look up the name of
a species from its identifier number.

GENE    0000.000.000   1.00.01.001  1.00.01.000    See below

Each time a plant or animal is populated or born, the genetic information for
that individual is reported. Since animals have more genetic data than plants,
animals have several additional fields in addition to the basic fields.


DATA and YEAR Fields

All of the following fields are recorded for DATA (daily census statistics)
and YEAR (yearly census summaries) for each active species.

Simulation time; Species ID: Total species population, including seeds for
plants; for plant species, the number of seeds, if any; Species population,
not including unsprouted seeds; Number of births or sprouts in this species;
Number of deaths in this species; Water level for this species; Health level
for this species; Number of females in the species population; Average age of
the species population; Average size of the species population; Total biomass
of this species.
