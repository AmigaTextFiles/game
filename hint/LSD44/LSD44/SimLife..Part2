				  PART TWO


SHOW GENES

Show Genes allows you to inspect the genes of any individual plant or animal.
When Show Genes is active, the cursor will appear as a DNA spiral and pencil.
Click on any organism to bring up the Genome Window.

This is the one place in SimLife when you can inspect and modify the genes
of one individual organism instead of the species prototype.

The Genome Window is explained in detail below.


SHOW VARIABLES

Show Variables allows you to inspec the simulation variables of any
individual plant or animal. These variables are the non-genetic information
that is different for each organism and that changes throughout its life,
including health, age, height, weight, etc.

When Show Variables is active, the cursor will appear as a slider control.
Click on any organism to bring up the Variables Window. The Variables
Window is explained in detail below.


SHOW PHENOTYPE

Show Phenotype bring up a small window displaying the "flash card" image of
any plant or animal. When Show Phenotype is active, the cursor will appear as
an eye. Click on any organism to see its flash card picture.

The Phenotype Window is explained in detail below.


SPECIATE

Speciate lets you grab an individual organism from one species and change it
into another species in a number of ways.

When Speciate is active, the cursor will appear as a sort of triangle of three
boxes, representing "two descended from one." Click on any organism to open
the Speciate Window. The Speciate Window is explained in detail below.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 114]



WATER TOOL

The Water tool toggles on and off the display of water in the Edit Window, and
lets you add or remove water from the ecosystem.

Click on the small On/Off button below the icon to turn on and off the display
off all water in the ecosystem.

When the Water tool is active, the cursor says H2O. Click or click and drag
the cursor on land to turn it into water. Click or click and drag on water to
turn it into land.

Use this tool to customize landforms, enlarge or remove lakes and isolate 
groups of land animals. You can also make islands and moats, and spell your
name in a river.


FOOD TOOL

The Food tool lets you place or remove Ultra-Food sources anywhere you want.
This food will feed any animal an unlimited supply of whatever it needs to
survive. This is especially useful in newer ecosystems that haven't had time
for plants to spread, or when the food chain has been broken.

When the Food tool is active, the cursor becomes a shopping cart.

Ultra-Food sources last forever and provide an unlimited amount of food to all
animals that approach them.


BARRIER TOOL

The Barrier tool lets you put down impenetrable barriers in the ecosystem that
only flying organisms can cross.

When the Barrier tool is active, the cursor becomes a pile of rocks. Click
anywhere on land or water to place a barrier.

Barriers are useful for dividing populations into isolated groups. You can
then expose each group to different environmental pressures and track the
divergent evolution in the different groups.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 115]


Since flying organisms can cross barriers, to isolate them you'll have to use
the altitude tool and make very high mountains.


TOXIN TOOL

The Toxin tool lets you palce a deadly poison into the ecosystem. This poison
will decreas an organism's health when it is directly adjacent to it.

When the Toxin tool is active, the cursor becomes a skull and crossbones
Click or click and drag in the Edit Window to place toxins.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 116]


If you place a toxin on top of a creature, the creature will be drawn on top
of the toxin. You may want to temporarily turn off the life layer when placing
toxins.


MUTAGEN TOOL

The Mutagen tool allows you to place material in the ecosystem that will raise
the odds of mutations occuring in nearby plants and animals.

When the Mutagen tool is active, the cursor becomes the radiation symbol. 
Click or click and drag in the Edit Window to place mutagens.

If you place a mutagen on top of a creature, the creature will be drawn on top
of the mutagen. You may want to temporarily turn off the life layer when 
placing mutagens.

A detailed description of Mutation is found below in the Reference section.


HELP

Click and hold on the Help button to see an on-screen reminder of what
each button in the Edit Window Control Panel does.


THE JOYSTICK

This is a simulated joystick to scroll the area that is displayed in the Edit
Window. Clicking or clicking and holding on any of the arrows will scroll the
Display Area over the world in the direction the arrow points.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 117]



MAP WINDOW

The Map Window is a satellite view of the entire world. It is where you
get an overview of the status of your ecosystem, garner information on the
environment and soil quality, and check the location of various objects and
organisms. It is also the launching site for mass-populating the ecosystem
and building new worlds.

The Map Window can be opened or activated by selecting Map in the Windows
Menu or by clicking on the Map icon on the Dashboard.

Note: on some computers, the Map Window Control Panel is found at the top
of the screen, integrated with the Dashboard. See your machine-specific 
addendum for details.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 118]



MAP WINDOW TITLE BAR

The Map Window Title Bar displays the scenario name, or the world name if you
bulid one of your own.

The Map Window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the
Title Bar. Clicking on the Close Box on the left side of the Title Bar makes
the Map Window go away.


DISPLAY AREA

The Map Window Display Area is the actual map of your world. Because of the
scale of the map, objects, items and organisms in it are tiny and are
represented by colored or shaded dots or areas.

Many of the objects can be recognized by the color keys or indicators in the
Map Window Control Panel. Organisms can be identified by their color as shown
on the Dashboard.


EDIT RECTANGLE

Somewhere in the Map Window Display Area is the Edit Rectangle. This rectangle
circumscribes the area of the map that is currently visible in the Edit 
Window.

Clicking anywhere on the map will cause the Edit Rectangle to center to center
itself around the cursor. You can also click and drag the Edit Rectangle.
When the Edit Rectangle is moved, the Edit Window will change to display the
new area in the rectangle.

Double-clicking in the Edit Rectangle brings the Edit Window to the front.


THE MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL

The Map Window Control Panel is filled with buttons that control what is
viewed in the map. The display controls do not affect the world or the
simulation in any way, just what you see at a particular time.

There are two different types of display controls: multi-level displays - only
one (or none) of which can be displayed at a time, and single level
       
                                                                [PAGE: 119]

displays - any or all of which can be displayed at a time. When applicable,
a color key will appear near the middle of the Map Window Control Panel to
help you interpret the multi-level data.

There are also two buttons that open the related Populate and World Design
Windows.


SOIL DEPTH

Soil Depth shows the depth, and therefore (in SimLife at least), the quality
of the soil. It is a multi-level display, and cannot be displayed at the
same time as any other multi-level display.

A color/shade key to help you interpret soil depth will appear near the
middle of the Map Window Control Panel.

The deeper the soil, the better the conditions and the more nutrients there
are for plants. New worlds will have shallow soil, but as plants grow and die,
they increase the depth. There will always be at least some good soil in
new worlds, especially near water sources.

Soil will erode if there are no plants on it.


FILTER FEEDER FOOD

Filter Feeder Food shows the amount of food available for the filterfeeding
animals such as crustaceans and whales in the ocean, and spiders, insect-
eating birds and anteaters on the land. It is a multi-level display, and
cannot be displayed at the same time as any other multi-level display.

Filter food consists of plants and animals in the ocean, the soil and the
air that range from microscopic size to the size of large insects. Filter
food is at the bottom of the food chain.

Filter food concentrates in shallow water and on shorelines, where it can
get nutrients from the nearby soil yet still receive sunlight. Since it
requires sunlight, the amount of filter feeder food will vary with the
seasons.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 120]


A color/shade key to help you interpret the available filter feeder food will
appear near the middle of the Map Window Control Panel.


TEMPERATURE

Temperature shows the air temperature in the world. It is a multi-level
display, and cannot be displayed at the same time as any other multi-level
display.

A color/shade key to help you interpret the temperature will appear near
the middle of the Map Window Control Panel.

Temperature changes with the seasons and directly affects plants and
indirectly affects animals.


MOISTURE

Moisture shows the amount of moisture in the world. It is a multi-level
display, and cannot be displayed at the same time as any other multi-level
display.

A color/shade key to help you interpret humidity will appear near the middle
of the Map Window Control Panel.

Moisture includes both humidity in the air and precipitation, and changes
with the seasons. The presence of plants increases moisture. As moisture
increases, plant-growing conditions improve so more plants can grow. This in
turn attracts and feeds more animals and increases soil depth.


ALTITUDE

Altitude shows the height of the land in the world. It is a multi-level
display, and cannot be displayed at the same time as any other multi-level
display.

A color/shade key to help you interpret altitude will appear near the middle
of the Map Window Control Panel.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 121]


The altitude of a new world affects the climate. (See The World Building 
Process in Miscellaneous Simstuff at the end of this section for more info.)
Also, only animals with climbing capability can move up or down steep slopes.


LIFE

Life toggles on and off the display of plants and animals on the map. This
is a single-level display, and can be viewed along with one of the multi-
level displays and any or all of the other single-level displays.

See the Dashboard to find out what colors represent which organisms.


WATER

Water toggles on and off the display of all water on the map. This is a
single-level display, and can be viewed along with one of the multi-level
displays and any or all of the other single-level displays.


BARRIERS

Barriers toggles on and off the display of any barriers on the map. This is
a single-level display, and can be viewed along with one of the multi-level
displays and any or all of the other single-level displays.


TOXINS

Toxins toggles on and off the display of any toxin deposits on the map.
This is a single-level display, and can be viewed along with one of the
multi-level displays and any or all of the other single-level displays.


MUTAGENS

Mutagens toggles on and off the display of mutation-causing agents on the
map. This is single-level display, and can be viewed along with one of the
multi-level displays and any or all of the other single-level displays.


FOOD SOURCES

Food Sources toggles on and off the display of any Ultra-Food food sources on
the map. This is a single-level display, and can be viewed along with one
of the multi-level displays and any or all of the other single-level displays.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 122]



TRAILS

Trails toggles on and off the display of the trails that animals follow on
the map, so their foraging movements can be observed. This is a single-level
display, and can be viewed along with one of the multi-level displays and
any or all of the other single-level displays.

Trails, like all other data layers, exist even when their display is turned
off. Trails are used by animals to find or avoid each other for eating or
mating, or because of genetic attraction or avoidance.

Animals can sense and follow other animals' trails. This is the SimLife 
equivalent to vision and is controlled by the vision gene.


HELP

Click and hold on the Help button to see an on-screen reminder of what each
button in the Map Window Control Panel does.


POPULATE BUTTON

Populate... opens the Populate Window so you can add plants or animals to the
world. A complete explanation of the Populate Window can be found below.

You can hold down the Option key (or the Control Key if your keyboard has no
Option key) while clicking on the Populate button to randomly populate the
world with plants and animals.

Build World Button

Build World... opens the World Desing Window so you can create a new world. A
complete explanation of the World Design Window can be found below.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 123]


 
POPULATE WINDOW
 
The Populate Window lets you add or delete plants and animals to or from the
world in large numbers, as opposed to the Edit Window, where you can only add
or remove one organism at a time.
 
The Populate Window can be reached through the Populate button in the Map
Window Control Panel, and through the Goodies submenu in the Simulation Menu.
 
The basic process of populating the world is to first select a species (or
group of species), and pick a number of organisms to be added or deleted. 
Next, choose whether to add the species (either as a group or scattered all
over the world) or delete the species. Then decide whether the organisms 
should be put on the land or in the water or both. And last, instruct the
computer to "Make It So."
 
 
SELECTED SPECIES
 
The Selected Species is the type of plant or animal you want to add or remove.
It will default to the Selected Species in the Dashboard.
 
To change the Selected Species, click and hold on the arrow button to open a
submenu of all available plants and animals, then slide the cursor to the one
you want. In addition to individual species, you can also select either All
Plants or All Animals.
 
When you change the Selected Species in the Populate Window, it will also
change in the Dashboard.
 
 
NUMBER

This is the number of organisms to be added or deleted. If you have chosen All
Plants or All Animals as the Selected Species, then this number of each 
species will be added.
 
To adjust the number, click or click and hold on the up or down arrows, or
highlight the number and type in a new one.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 124]

WORLD DESIGN WINDOW
 
The World Design Window lets you create new worlds to suit your whims or the
needs of your experiments. It can be reached through the Build World button in
the Map Window Control Panel, and through the Goodies submenu in the 
Simulation Menu.
 
The basic process of world design is to first choose settings for climate, 
rivers and mountains, the decide which and how many artifacts you want in the
world then pick a size for the world, name it and "Make It So."
 
Most of the settings involve slider controls. To adjust them, click and drag
the arrows.
 
There are four possible world sizes. When choosing world sizes, keep in mind 
the speed of your computer (larger worlds run slower), the amount of RAM you
have (larger worlds take more memory), and the particular experiment you are
designing. Larger world sizes are not available on some computers while in
black and white mode.
 
 
REGIONAL WEATHER VARIATION
 
This adjustment controls the variations in temperature and moisture in your
ecosystem's climate. When set to high, the seasonal changes in both
temperature and moisture will be high. When set to low, the ecosystem will 
have very little difference between seasons.
 
 
WORLD AVERAGE TEMPERATURE
 
This adjustment sets the average, or center point around which the seasonsal
temperature variations vary.
 
 
WORLD AVERAGE MOISTURE
 
This adjustment sets the average, or center point around which the seasonal
moisture variations vary.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 126]


 
RIVERS AND LAKES
 
This adjustment sets the amount of the ecosystem that is covered by water. It
ranges from none to many, which will cover the entire world except for the
highest mountain peaks. If you set the Rivers and Lakes to many and mountains
to none in the adjustment below, you can create an ocean-only ecosystem.
 
 
MOUNTAINS
 
This adjustment sets the amount of mountains that will be generated in the
ecosystem.
 
 
TOXINS 
 
This adjustment sets the amount of toxins that will appear scattered around 
the new world when it is generated. These can be set from none to many.
 
 
MUTAGENS
 
This adjustment sets the amount of mutagens that will appear scattered around 
the new world when it is generated. These can be set from none to many.
 

FOOD SOURCES
 
This adjustment sets the amount of Ultra-Food Food Sources that will appear
scattered around the world when it is generated. These can be set from none to
many.
 
 
BARRIERS
 
This adjustment sets the amount of Barriers that will appear scattered around
the new world when it is generated. These can be set from none to many.

BIOLOGY LAB
 
The Biology Lab is a multi-level window for inspecting and modifying existing
plant and animal species, and designing and creating new ones. It can be 
reached either through the Biology Lab item in the Windows Menu or through the
Biology Lab icon in the Dashboard. You can also open the Biology Lab directly
to the second (edit) level by double clicking on an organisms icon in the 
Dashboard.
 
The Biology Lab can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the
Title Bar. It will go away if you click in the Close Box.
 
 
BIOLOGY LAB AT SELECT LEVEL
 
The first level of the Biology Lab is for selecting an organism to work with.
The second level is for editing, where you modify the organism and/or its 
icon. From the second level you can open the Genome Window and inspect or
manipulate the organism's genetic code.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 129]



PROTOTYPES AND INDIVIDUALS
 
In the Biology Lab, you can only edit the Prototype (the genetic starting 
point) of a species.
 
To edit the genes of an individual organism, you will have to select the
individual in the Edit Window with the Show Genes function of the Life Tool 
and do the editing in the Genome Window.
 
 
SELECT LEVEL
 
Here you select an existing species to edit, copy, delete or save. You can 
also create a new plant or animal species, or load in previously saved 
species, individually or in groups (zoos). Once you have gone from here to the
Edit Level and modified a species, return here to save your changes.
 
 
SELECTED SPECIES
 
This is the species that is ready for editing, copying, etc. Icons of all
possible species are displayed on the right side of the window. To select a 
new Seleted Species, click its icon. Changing the Selected Species here 
changes it in all windows.

Click here to move to the Edit level of the Biology Lab so you can inspect or
modify the Selected Species.


COPY
 
Click here to make a copy of the Selected Species that you can then edit and
save.
 
 
DELETE 
 
Click here to remove the Selected Species from the current world. Deleting a
species will not remove it from the disk or prevent you from using it in 
another world.
 
 
SAVE

Click here to save you edited species to disk for later use.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 130]


 
Warning: If you edit any of the plants and animals that come with
SimLife, you should save them under different names or in different
folders or directories than the originals so you can go back to the
originals at a later time. Whatever you do, don't save over the
original plants and animals on the original disks. Protect your zoo!

Click here to open a dialog box or requester to load in a previously saved 
Zoo file. A Zoo is a group of plants or animals saved together by using the
Save All Plants or Save All Animals button.
 
 
EDIT LEVEL
 
The Edit Level of the Biology Lab lets you easily modify or design organisms,
as well as draw or change icons for the organisms and make a few basic genetic
manipulations.
 
When you edit at the Edit Level, you can never edit one individual member of a
species. You can only edit the prototype of the species.
 
You can get to the Edit Level from the Select Level by selecting a species 
from the icons and then clicking on the Edit button, by double-clicking on a
Selet Level plant or animal icon, or by clicking either the New Plant or New
Animal buttons.
 
You can also edit a species by double-clicking on the species' icon on the
Dashboard. Whenever you start a new plant or animal, you will be editing the
entire species.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 132]



The Edit Level of the Biology Lab is slightly different for animals and 
plants.

This is a display of the name of the Selected Species. 
 
 
RENAME

Click here to open a dialog box or requester that allows you to rename the 
current species.
 
 
FLASH CARDS
 
The flash cards give you a simple way to modify or design an organism.
 
These flash card pictures are not actually representative of how the organism
looks. SimLife organisms are electronic and look like a matrix of ones and 
zeros manifested as energy levels in transistor switches in the memory of your
computer. Since we humans can't see energy levels in transistors, we've put 
these flash cards into SimLife as a pictorial analogy: a way to think of these
organisms in familiar terms, to relate them to combinations of plants and
animals we are familiar with.
 
The pictures of the flash cards were chosen and drawn to help you understand 
how the animal fits into the environment. Looking at these pictures, it is
fairly easy to figure out the organism's food, brain size, method of movement,
etc.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 133]


Each SimLife organism is represented by a combination of three pictures. Each
of these pictures represents at least two genetic factors. To change the 
pictures, click on the up or down arrows above or to the left of the pictures.
 
As you "flip" through the flash cards, a text description of the organism will
appear below the pictures.
 
Designing organisms through the flash cards is somewhat limited. These 
creatures will only have one food source, one type of seed, one method of
motion, etc. To add abilities to your creature, you can enter the Genome 
Window and fine-tune its genetic code.
 
Note: You can flip through the flash cards all you want without 
messing up your organism. The changes you make to the flash cards 
don't actually affect the organism until you click on the Change 
Prototype Genome to Match Picture button, as explained below.
 
The flash cards for plants are arranged vertically.
 
The top card has eight possible pictures, which represent two factors: the
presence or absence of nectar and the four seed types (sticky, dropping, 
drifting or fruit).
 
The middle card has 18 possible pictures, which represent three factors:
deciduous or evergreen, evaporation rate (dry, normal or humid) and structure
(grass, tree or shrub).
 
The bottom card has eight possible pictures, which represent three factors,
all of which deal with the plant's germination: floating or nonfloating seeds,
sprouting temperature (high or low) and sprouting moisture (high or low).
        
                                                                [PAGE: 134]


The flash cards for animals are arranged horizontally.
 
The left card, the front of the animal, has 18 possible pictures, which 
represent two factors: the food source (nectar, plants, animals, fruit, filter
or seeds) and the intelligence (large, medium or small).
 
The middle card has 20 possible pictures, which represent two factors: method
of movement (walk, climb, swim or fly) and preferred environment (ocean,
jungle, plains, mountain or desert).
 
The right card, the rear of the animal, has six possible pictures, which 
represent two factors: gestation size and time (small, medium or large) and
litter size (1-2 or 4-8).


GENE POOL DIVERSITY

This slider sets the genetic spread-the amount of variance in the genes-of a
species when you add it to the world through the Populate Window or with the
Populate function of the Life Tool in the Edit Window. From then on, genetic
diversity is in the hands of natural selection and the species' genetic 
algorithm.
 

MATING DIFFERENCE

This slider control sets the limits on how different the genetic code of two
individuals of two species can be, while still allowing them to mate.
 
 
% GENES FROM FATHER
 
This slider controls the amount of genes the offspring receives from the 
father. The rest of the genes come from the mother. This slider has no effect
in asexual species.


ICON SECTION

Here you can change or edit the icons that represent the existing creatures,
and choose or create new icons for new creatures.

There are differences in the icon section for plants and animals.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 135]


Plant Icons

Each plant needs four icons that represent the four stages of plant life: 
seed, with flowers, with leaves (but no flowers) and with no leaves. You can
either choose from the included icons or draw on your own. You can also choose
icons, then edit them yourself.
 
To choose a set of plant icons, click and hold on the Icons button to open a
submenu of 32 predrawn plants, then slide the cursor to the one you want and
release the mouse button.

The submenu only shows one of the icons-leaves, no flowers-but all four icons
are there.
 
The icon drawing process is simple:
 
   * Choose the icon you want to draw or change, then click on it.
 
   * Click on the color in the pallette you want to draw with.
 
   * Click or click and drag in the drawing area.     R.Y.G.A.R.-(c) 1993 !!!
 
If you make a mistake, you can undo your last drawing action by clicking on 
the Undo button, or selecting Undo in the Edit Menu.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 136]


Since different stages of the plant's life may look very similar, you can:
 
   * Draw one stage.
 
   * Select the Copy Icon item in the Edit Menu.
 
   * Click on another icon.
 
   * Select the Paste Icon item in the Edit Menu
 
   * Make any changes as necessary.
 
There is also a Clear button. Use this to completely clear an icon if you want
to start over.
 
Animal Icons

There are four icons for each animal, but only two that you can draw or 
change. There are two stages of life represented by animal icons: child and
adult. Since animals move, you'll need two child and two adult icons facing in
different directions.
 
You can either choose from the included icons or draw your own. You can also
choose icons, then edit them yourself.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 137]


To choose a set of animal icons, click and hold on the Icons button to open a
submenu of 64 predraws animals, then slide the cursor to the one you want and
release the mouse button.
 
The submenu only shows the adult icons in one direction, but all four icons 
are there.

The icon drawing process for animals is even simpler than for plants: you 
don't have to draw the "flipped" icons-they are automatically generated for 
you.
 
   * Choose either the left adult or the left child icon and click on it.
 
   * Click on the color in the pallette you want to draw with.
 
   * Click or click and drag in the drawing area.
 
If you make a mistake, you can undo your last drawing action by clicking on 
the Undo button, or by selecting Undo in the Edit Menu.
 
Since the two stages of the animal's life look very similar, you can:
 
   * Draw one stage.

   * Select the Copy Icon item in the Edit Menu.
 
   * Click on another icon.
 
   * Select the Paste Icon item in the Edit Menu.
 
   * Make any changes as necessary.
 
There is also a Clear button. Use this to completely clear an icon if you want
to start over.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 138]



BIOLOGY LAB BUTTONS

At the lower-left corner of the Biology Lab are seven buttons. Many of these 
buttons are very powerful and can drastically alter the gene pool of an entire
species, so a warning message will appear to give you a chance to back out.
 
Return to Select Level
 
Click here to return to the Select Level so you can save the current species
and/or edit another.
 
Change Picture to Match Prototype Genome

Click here to update the picture to match any changes you have made to the
species prototype in the Genome Window.
 
Change Prototype Genome to Match Picture
 
Click here to change the genetic code for the prototype species to match the 
flash card picture. You can flip through the flash cards all you want, and it
won't affect the genetic code until you click on this button.
 
Edit Species Genome

Click this button to open the Genome Window for the Selected Species.
 
Make Population Match Prototype Genome

Click here to update the genetic code of the entire population of the Selected
Species to match the genetic code of the currently selected species' 
Prototype.

This is a deceptively powerful button that goes way beyond the capabilities of
today's biological science. In the world we live in, you can make changes to 
an organism's genetic code, but the changes won't be noticeable until a future
generation-the organism won't re-form itself to match the new code.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 139]


This tool in SimLife not only changes the genetic code of a whole population
of organisms, it instantly updates the population physically, mentally or
whateverly to match its new genetic code. If you add the ability to fly to the
Prototype and push this button, the whole population of this species will
instantly grow wings.
 
Make Prototype Genome Match Population

Click here to change the Prototype of the organism being edited to match the
current population of that species.
 
Help
 
Click and hold on the Help button to see an on-screen reminder of what each
button in the Biology Lab does.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 140]



GENOME WINDOWS

There are actually two Genome Windows: one for animals and one for plants. 
These windows display the entire genetic code for any species or individual
organism and allow you to change, modify, manipulate or redesign the organisms
at the genetic level.
 
The Genome Window can be opened from the Biology Lab by clicking on the Edit
Species Genome button or from the Edit Window by using the Life Tool in Show
Genes mode and clicking on an organism.

When you enter the Genome Window through the Biology Lab you will be looking 
at the prototype genome for the whole species. When you enter from the Edit
Window you will be looking at the genome for the individual that you clicked
on.

The Genome Window both consists of a number of slider controls, on/off 
switches and drop-down menu choices. Designing or modifying organisms at the
genetic level is actually a lot easier than it looks-once you understand what
each of the genes does.
 
Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind when designing an organism is
this: There is no free lunch. Even in SimLife. The price you pay is in energy
consumption. If you create an animal that can climb and swim and fly, and it's
large and fast and strong and has sharp vision and powerful weapons, it will
require so much energy to survive that it probably couldn't eat enough to stay
alive even if it lived in a supermarket. As you design or modify an organism,
keep an eye on the Energy Requirement Bar near the lower-right corner of the
window. (It will be explained in detail below.)

The genome only contains the potentials for the animal. There are a number of
factors or variables for each individual animal that change with time. These
variables include current health, weight, age, current food and water storage,
etc., and can be found in the Variables Window as described below.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 141]



HELP

At any time in this window you can click and hold on the name of any gene or
group of genes for a pop-up explanation of what the gene does.


TITLE SECTION

This part of the Genome Window displays the name of the species or individual
organism currently being edited. If it is an individual organism, it will have
a number as part of its name.


GENDER

There are four possible settings for Gender: Female, Male, Asexual, and 
Sterile. Click and hold the down-arrow button to reveal the Gender submenu,
then slide the cursor to the gender (or lack thereof) of your choice.


MOVEMENT

There are four ways animals can move. They can walk, climb, swim or fly. The
different methods of movement require differing amounts of energy: swimming
       
                                                                [PAGE: 142]

takes the least, flying takes the most and walking and climbing are somewhere
in the middle. Of course, you can go to the Laws of Physics Window (see below)
and change the energy it takes to do these things.

Clicking on the button to the left of each method of movement toggles it on 
and off for the animal being edited. Animals can be made capable of more than
one type of movement, but the more skills and abilities an animal has, the 
more energy it requires.

If all types of movement are turned off, the animal will just sit in one 
place-like an anemone.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 143]



FOOD SOURCES

In addition to Ultra-Food, there are six food sources that animals can eat: 
nectar, plants, animals, fruit, filter food (plankton and near-microscopic
plants and animals in the sea, soil and air) and seeds.

Clicking on the button to the left of each food source toggles it on and off
for the animal being edited. Animals can be made capable of eating more than
one type of food, but more sources take more energy due to the more versatile
digestive system required to absorb the different materials.


BEHAVIOR

There are four slider controls, two drop-down menus and a series of icons and
buttons that define the animal's behavior. In SimLife, all behavior is geared
to foraging for food, finding a mate and fleeing enemies.

The Share Food slider deals with the social aspects of eating. If the slider
is all the way to the left, then the animal will hunt and eat alone, like the
tiger. If the slider is all the way to the right, then the animal has highly
developed social graces when it comes to food. These species will hunt or
gather together and share food with any member of their species.

The Roaming slider adjusts how often the animal will move when it doesn't
absolutely need to find food or water right away.

The Turning slider adjusts the number and severity of directional changes the
animal makes while moving.

The Persist slider controls how long a creature will follow a trail before
giving up and trying something else.

Turn Type is a pull-down menu that lets you choose between three types of
turning behaviors: zig-zag, looping and random.

Turn Angle is a pull-down menu that lets you choose between four severities of
turns that the animal can make: low, medium-low, medium-high and high. A high
       
                                                                [PAGE: 144]

turn angle helps an animal thorougly explore a small area, while a low turn
angle allows an animal to hastily cover a larger territory.

The Prefer/Avoid/Ignore controls set what types of plants or animals your
current animal will be attracted to or repelled by.

You can choose up to eight organisms and set whether they attract or repel 
your animal:

   * Click on any of the buttons below the icons to toggle between 
     Prefer (+), Avoid (-) or Ignore (0).

   * Click and hold on the icon above to reveal a submenu of all life-forms

   * Slide the cursor to the plant or animal you want, then release the mouse
     button.

Hint: it is a good idea not to have your animal be attracted to another animal
that will eat it.

Icons to the right take precedence in behavior conflicts, i.e., if an animal
comes into contact with one thing that it is attracted to and another thing
it is repelled by at the same time, it will react to the one whose icon is
farthes to the right.


LIFE

This section of the genetic code consists of two sliders and one pull-down
menu that deal with the animal's maturation rate and length of life.

Life Span is a slider control for adjusting the maximum life span of the
animal. This maximum life span is a percentage of the maximum life span in the
Laws of Physics Window.

Adult is the age, or point in the life span, where the animal reaches 
maturity. Animals grow in size until they reach adult age.

Die-off is a pull-down menu with three choices for death age (die-off is
superceded by death due to starvation, dehydration or predation): immortal,
live to old age and live to medium age. Click and hold on the down-arrow
button to see the menu, then slide the cursor to your choice.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 145]


When the setting is immortal, the animal will not die of natural causes.
When the setting is old age, the animal will live out its maximum life span.
When the setting is medium age, the animal will die somewhere between
maturity and maximum life span.


FEATURES

This section of the Genome Window consists of four slider controls that deal
with physical survival features, which require a lot of energy.

The Size slider controls the maximum size of the animal.

The Stealth slider controls the animal's ability to move silently and avoid
predators.

The Weapons slider controls the power of the animal's weapon (claws, teeth,
poisons, etc.).

The Vision slider controls the animal's visual acuity.


GESTATION

This section of the Genome Window consists of four sliders and one pull-down
menu that deal with the animal's reproductive system.

The Size slider controls the amount that the animal gains in size during
gestation, which directly relates to how much food/energy the animal needs to
reproduce.

The Time slider controls the amount of time the animal takes to produce 
offspring.

The %Female slider controls the percentage of offspring that are female.

The Mutation slider controls the likelihood of the animal's offspring having
a mutation.

Number of Children is a pull-down menu that controls the number of offspring
the animal has each litter. Click and hold on the down-arrow button to reveal
       
                                                                [PAGE: 146]

the menu, then slide the cursor to the number you want. The choices are 1,
2, 4 and 8 children per litter.


FOOD

This section of the Genome Window deals with the animal's food/energy stores.
The current values for food for any individual animal can be seen in the
Variables Window.

The Max slider adjusts the maximum food the animal can store in its body. A
high max setting allows stocking up of energy when it is plentiful, but 
increases the animal's weight and slows it down.

The Action slider sets the food storage level that provokes the animal to
start looking for food.

The Danger slider sets the food storage level for when the animal does nothing
else but look for food.


WATER

This section of the Genome Window deals with the animal's water stores. The
current water values for any animal can be seen in the Variables Window.

The Max slider adjusts the maximum water the animal can store in its body. A
high max setting allows stocking up of water when it is plentiful, but 
increases the animal's weight and slows it down.

The Action slider sets the water storage level that provokes the animal to
start looking for water.

The Danger slider sets the water storage level for when the animal does 
nothing else but look for water.


HEALTH

This section of the Genome Window deals with the animal's overall health. The
current values for health for any animal can be seen in the Variables Window.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 147]


The Max slider adjusts the maximum health level the animal can reach.

The Action slider sets the health level that causes the animal to start 
resting to replenish its health.

The Danger slider sets the food storage level for when the animal does nothing
but sit still and save energy.


MAXIMUM SIZE BAR

As you design or modify an animal in this window, the Maximum Size Bar will
indicate how big your animal will have to be to hold all the features and
capabilities you are programming into it.


ENERGY REQUIREMENT BAR

As you design or modify an animal in this window, the Energy Requirement Bar
will indicate how much energy your animal will require to survive all the 
features and capabilities you are programming into it.

The farther to the right this bar is, the more energy the animal needs to
survive. Try to keep this bar at 3/4 or less. If this bar gets all the way
to the right, the animal will need so much food to live it could starve in
the middle of dinner.


NEVER MIND

Click this button to leave the Genome Window without changes taking place.


MAKE IT SO

Click this button when you are happy with all the settings. All your changes
will be activated and the window will close.

can have: Sticky, Dropping, Drifting and Fruit. Click and hold on the down-
arrow button to open the menu, then slide the cursor to your choice and
release the mouse button.


SEASONS

Sprout Season is a pull-down menu with your choice of four seasons in which
your plant can sprout: Spring, SUmmer, Fall and Winter. Click and hold on the
down-arrow button to open the menu, then slide the cursor to your choice and
release the mouse button.

Flower Season will always be the season immediately following Sprout Season.

Seed Season will always be the season immediately following Flower Season.


SLIDERS

There are nine slider controls for adjusting various genetic characteristics
of your plant. All adjustments get higher as the slider moves from left to
right.

The Evaporation Rate slider controls the rate at which the plant loses water
to the atmosphere. The higher the evaporation rate, the faster it loses water
and the more water it needs to survive. Also, the higher the evaporation rate,
the faster the plant will grow.

The Sprout Moisture slider controls the amount of moisture required for the
plant's seeds to sprout.

The Sprout Temperature slider controls the temperature that must be reached in
sprouting season before the seed will sprout.

The Health slider sets the maximum health level for the plant. The higher the
health, the more resistant it is to toxins and the better it can survive
after being partially eaten by animals.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 150]


The Food slider sets the maximum amount of food the plant can store.

The Water slider sets the maximum amount of water the plant can store.

The Mutation Rate slider controls the odds on how often mutation will occur
in new generations of this plant.

The Maximum Size slider controls the size limitations of the plant.

The Old Age slider controls how long the plant can live (barring accidents,
predation or disaster) before it loses the ability to reproduce.


BUTTONS

The Nectar button is a yes/no toggle that controls whether or not the plant
produces nectar.

The Evergreen button is a yes/no toggle that control whether or not the
plant is an evergreen.

Click on Never Mind if you want to leave the Plant Genome Window without any

CLIMATE LAB

The Climate Lab lets you make changes to the climate of the current world. It
can be reached through the Climate Lab iten in the Windows Menu or through
the Climate Lab button in the Dashboard.

The Climate Lab can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the
Title Bar. It'll go away if you click in the Close Box.

Each of the three adjustable climatic aspects deal with variation throughout
the year and have two controls: a slider to set the amount of variation
and a drop-down menu to set the season where the variation reaches its peak.

Adjust the sliders by clicking and dragging the pointer. The variation 
increases from left to right. To set the Peak Season, click and hold on the
down-arrow buttons to open a pull-down menu of the seasons, then slide the
cursor to the season of your choice and release the mouse button.

The right side of the window has a graph to visually depict the seasonal
variations for each setting.


DAY LENGTH VARIATION

This setting controls how much the amount of daylight per day changes
throughout the year. This affects the amount of sunlight plants get.


RAINFALL VARIATION

This setting controls the seasonal changes in rainfall (which is included 
under the Humidity heading in the graphis and in most other windows).


TEMPERATURE VARIATION

This setting controls the seasonal changes in temperature.

GRAPHS WINDOW

The Graphs Window is a very versatile tool for extracting information from the
simulation. It can display 720 graphs in either of two time scales. Four 
graphs can be displayed at a time.

The Graphs Window can be opened from the Windows Menu (it's in the Census
submenu) or through the Census button on the Dashboard.

The Graphs Window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging
the Title Bar. It will go away if you click in the Close Box.

Just below the Close Box is a "punch card" that marks the Graphs Window as
a Census Window.

Near the upper-right corner of the window are up and down arrow buttons.
You can click on these arrows to cycle forwards and backwards through all
the Census Windows.

To the left of the up and down arrows is the Help button. Click and hold on 
this button to see a brief explanation of what this window does and how it
works.

TIME SCALE

There are two available time scales in which the graphs can be displayed,
50 years or 50 days. Click on the Days or Years buttons to change time scales.


GRAPH SELECTORS

There are four graph selectors, each of which can be used to choose any
graph - or no graph - to display. Each selector is assigned a color or shade.
The words in the selector and the corresponding graph will appear in this
color or shade.

Selecting a graph to display is a two-step process: first select a species,
then select the information.


THE LOCAL SPECIES

The Local Species of the graph is the plant or animal whose information is
graphed. The Local Species can be any plant or animal, or all plants or all
animals at once. When this species is selected, it is active in the Graphs
Window only - it does not become the Selected Species in the Dashboard.

To select a Local Species, click and hold on the upper down-arrow button to
reveal a submenu of all possible choices, then slide the cursor to your choice
and release the mouse button. An icon representing your choice will appear
below the arrow.

If you hold down the Option key (or the Control key if your keyboard has no
Option key) while selecting a Local Species, that species will be the subject
for all four selectors.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 154]



THE INFORMATION

The information is the data to be graphed about the above subject.

To select the information to be displayed, click and hold on the lower
down-arrow button to reveal a submenu of all possible choices, then slide
the cursor to your choice and release the mouse button. If you hold down the
Option key (or the Control key if your keyboard has no Option key) while 
selecting the information, that information will be selected for all four
selectors. (The last sentence was a selected selection for our select 
audience.) The possible choices of information to display are:

No Graph - displays nothing for this Graph Selector.
Population - displays the changes in the subject's population.
Births - displays the changes in the subject's births. 
Deaths - displays the changes in the subject's deaths.
Age (% of Max) - displays the changes in how long the subject lives as a
percentage of its maximum possible age.
Size (% of Max) - displays the changes in the subject's size as a percentage
of its maximum possible size.
Females (%) - displays the changes in the percentage of the subjects that are
female.
Radiation (%) - displays the cumulative radiation dose the subject has 
received as a percentage of the maximum dose.
Food (%) - displays the changes in the percentage of maximum food the subject
has stored.
Water (%) - displays the changes in the percentage of maximum water the 
subject has stored.
Health (%) - displays the changes in the subject's health rating, as a 
percentage of maximum health.
% of Biomass - displays the amount of the biomass that is represented by the
subject. If the subject is an animal species, the graph will show its 
percentage of the total animal biomass. If the subject is a plant species, the
graph will show its percentage of the total plant biomass. If the subject is
All Plants or All Animals, the graph will show its percentage of combined 
plant and animal biomass.
Ecology Score - displays an ongoing score of the ecological soundness of the
current world. This score is actually a rating of how well you are doing as
master of this ecosystem. It is easy to get high ecology scores for short
periods of time - the challenge is to keep a constant high score.

Note: If you have deselected Record All Statistics in the Technical
submenu of the Simulation Menu, the percentage-based graphs and the
ecology score will not be available.
 
 
DISPLAY AREA
 
The bottom section of the Graphs Window is where the graphs are displayed. 
When relevant, numbers will appear along the right side and/or percentages 
will appear along the left side to provide a scale for interpreting the 
graphs.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 156]



MORTALITY WINDOW

The Mortality Window is a graphic display of the causes of death in the 
ecosystem. It also displays the predators (if any) that are responsible for
the deaths. It can be opened from the Windows Menu (it's in the Census 
submenu) or through the Census button on the Dashboard.
 
The Mortality Window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging
the Title Bar. It will go away if you click in the Close Box.

Just below the Close Box is a "punch card" that marks the Mortality Window as
a Census Window.

Near the upper-right corner of the window are up and down arrow buttons. You
can click on these arrows to cycle forward and backward through all the Census
Windows.

Below the up and down arrows is the Help button. Click and hold on this button
to see a brief explanation of what this window does and how it works.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 157]



LOCAL SPECIES

Mortality information can be shown for any individual species, or for All
Plants or All Animals as a group. To select the Local Species whose mortality
graph you want to see, click and hold on the down-arrow button to open the
submenu of choices, slide the cursor to the species of your mortal desire and
release the mouse button.

The species selected here does not affect the Selected Species in the 
Dashboard or any of the other windows.


ALL DEATHS

The default display is a graph of all causes of death for the previous five
years.

The agents of death are listed along the left side of the display from top to
bottom. The number of deaths in the current year from each cause is displayed
below the name of each agent.

The percentages are represented as bars that increase from left to right.


WHO'S EATING ME?

If you click on the Who's Eating Me? button, you will see a display of all the
predators with bar graphs showing how many of the Local Species they have 
eaten.

Click on the All Deaths button to return to the default display.


CAUSES OF DEATH

For the most part, the causes of death are self-explanatory: Eaten, Old Age,
Disease, No Water and No Food are easy to figure out. The only ambiguous one
is Accident, which covers everything that doesn't fit into any of the above 
categories. Deaths listed as Accidents include human-caused death by: Smiting,
Plant and Animal Limits in the Laws of Physics Window, and Populating land
plants or animals in the water. It also covers real accidents like water 
animals stranded on land during a drought. Also, when animals have children,
their litters spread out in all directions. If a litter occurs near water,
some infants can drown.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 158]



GENE POOL WINDOW

The Gene Pool Window is a graphic display of evolution in action. It shows the
frequency and spread of genes for any single species at a time, or All Plants
or All Animals at once.

It can be opened from the Windows Menu (it's in the Census submenu) or through
the Census button on the Dashboard.

The Gene Pool Window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging 
the Title Bar. It will go away if you click in the Close Box.

Just below the Close Box is a "punch card" that marks the Gene Pool Window as
a Census Window.

Near the upper-right corner of the window are up and down arrow buttons. You
can click on these arrows to cycle forward and backward through all the Census
Windows.

Next to the up and down arrows is the Help button. Click and hold on this 
button to see a brief explanation of what this window does and how it works.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 159]



TYPES OF GENES

To understand this window, keep in mind that creatures in SimLife have two
types of genes: discrete and continuous.

Discrete genes are like yes/no or multiple-choice genes. They have one value.
For instance, as far as animal movement genes go, either the individual animal
walks or it doesn't; it flies or it doesn't. Yes or no. Relating to gender, 
either an animal is male, female, asexual or sterile. Pick one and only one:
multiple choice. Discrete genes are shown and adjusted in the Genome Window as
on/off buttons.

Continuous genes are those that can have a wide range of values, for example,
the life span or the mutation probability genes. Each of these genes is a 
number somewhere on a continuum from 0 to 256. They are shown and adjusted in
the Genome Window as slider controls.

In a sense, you can think of the discrete genes as digital-yes or no, on or 
off-and the continuous genes as analog with a continuous range of possible
values. (Technically, in SimLife, the continuous genes are stored and computed
digitally and actually have a number of discrete values, but there are enough
available values in the continuum for them to appear analog for all practical
and experimental purposes.)


POPULATION

This section of the Gene Pool Window displays the total population of the 
Local Species, whether the Local Species is a plant, an animal, or All Plants
or All Animals.

This window always displays information on a species population-all the
members of that species that are currently alive in the world. The only way
you can see the gene pool information for one organism is if there is only one
alive, or if you put one organism into its own species with the Speciate 
function. Of course, one organism is not a very good gene pool.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 160]



LOCAL SPECIES

This section of the Gene Pool Window both displays and allows you to select 
the Local Species. Click and hold on the down-arrow button to reveal the 
submenu of all possible choices, then slide the cursor to your choice and 
release the mouse button. Both the name of the Local Species and its icon will
be displayed.

The species selected here does not affect the Selected Species in the 
Dashboard or any of the other windows.


USE COLORS BUTTON

This button toggles between displaying the continuous gene section of this 
window using colors to represent percentages or using small bar graphs to 
represent percentages. This will be explained below.

This button may not appear on computers with monochrome monitors.


DISCRETE GENES 

This section of the Gene Pool Window displays all the information on the 
discrete genes of the Local Species.

The genes are arranged into groups of related genes. The group name is 
displayed at the top of this section, and the individual genes are listed 
below with a bar chart showing what percentage of the population has this 
gene. The bar charts range from 0% on the left to 100% on the right. Since
individual organisms can have more than one food source or method of movement,
the bar charts add up to more than 100%


GROUP SELECTION

One group of genes can be selected at a time. Click and hold on the down-arrow
button to reveal a submenu of the choices, slide the cursor to your choice and 
release the mouse button.


GROUPS AND INDIVIDUAL GENES

Since the genes in plants and animals are different, so are the groups as 
displayed in this section of this window.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 161]

CONTINUOUS GENES

This section of the Gene Pool Window displays all the information on the 
continuous genes of the Local Species.

There are 23 different continuous genes that can be displayed for animals and
nine for plants.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 162]



GENE SELECTION

Along the left side of this section is a list of the continuous genes being
displayed. Nine genes can be displayed at once, so all plant genes can be 
viewed simultaneously.

To view all the animal genes or change the order of display for plants, click
and hold on the down-arrow to the right of the gene name to open a submenu of
all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then release the mouse
button.


WARNING: TRICKY GRAPHS

The Contiuous Gene display is a little tricky, but understanding it is very
important to interpreting changes in the Gene Pool, which is needed in many
scenarios and experiments.

To make it easier to understand, there are two different ways to look at the
information: using colors and using bar graphs.

The two types of displays are chosen by clicking on the Use Colors? button. A
color or monochrome key will appear to help you interpret the data in this 
section of the window.

On some computers with monochrome-only screens, the Use Colors? button and/or
the color key and/or color display may not be available.


CONTINUOUS GENE DISPLAY - MONOCHROME

When the Use Colors? button is set to "No," the continuous genes will be
displayed using small black bar graphs. The key at the top will help you 
understand the display.

Each of these partitioned rectangles represents one continuous gene. The left
end of this rectangle corresponds with the lowest value for that gene and the
right side corresponds with the highest value. The bars appear at different
locations-different values-and show what percentage of the population has that
value for the particular gene. The higher the bar, the higher the percentage 
of the population with that value.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 163]


Each of these lines matches a slider in the Genome Window. For example, the
life span gene.

Above is shown the Gene Pool Window life span gene display for one animal, and
that animal's life span gene from the Genome Window. Notice how the bar's and
arrow's locations match.

To be really useful, the gene pool must show the combined genes for a whole
population, not just one organism. Each animal in the population will have a
value for life span, but not all of them will have the exact same value.

When there is a spread of values for a gene, this is shown using multiple 
black bars at different locations. The higher the bar, the more of the 
population has that value for the gene.

In addition, if the Local Species is a single species (not All Plants or All
Animals), there will be a thin pink or black line somewhere in the display.
This line marks the value of this gene for the Prototype of the species. You
can look at the prototype value as the "starting position" for each gene. When
the black bars drift away from the Prototype, they represent the change in the
gene pool-the evolution of the genes through natural selection and mutation.

If All Plants or All Animals is selected there will be no Prototype lines.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 164]



CONTINUOUS GENE DISPLAY - COLOR

When the Use Colors? button is set to "Yes," the continuous genes will be 
displayed using a special color display. The key at the top will help you
understand the display.

Each of these black rectangles represents one continuous gene. The left side 
of the rectangle corresponds with the lowest value for that gene and the right
side corresponds with the highest value. The colored bars appear at different
locations-different values-and show what percentage of the population has that
value for this gene. Instead of using the height of the bar to represent the
percentage, in this display we use color. The key above will show you what
colors represent what percentages.

The gene pool is the combined genes for a whole population. Each organism in
the population will have a value for each gene, but not all of them will have
the exact same value.

Each rectangle displays all the values of all the organisms for one gene. When
there is a spread of values for a gene, this is shown using multiple colored
bars at different locations.

Part of the reason for using this type of display is because it looks very 
much like the Gel Electrophoresis analysis of actual DNA in a biology
laboratory.

In addition, if the Local Species is a single species (not All Plants or All
Animals), there will be a thin pink or black line somewhere in the display.
This line marks the value of this gene for the Prototype of the species. You
can look at the prototype value as the "starting position" for each gene. When
the colored bars drift away from the Prototype, they represent the change in 
the gene pool-the evolution of the genes through natural selection and 
mutation.

If All Plants or All Animals is selected there will be no Prototype lines.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 165]



FOOD WEB WINDOW

This window shows the predator/prey relationships between different organisms
in the ecosystem.

The Food Web Window can be opened from the Windows Menu (in the Census 
submenu) or through the Census button on the Dashboard.

The Food Web Window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging
the Title Bar and it will go away if you click in the Close Box.

Just below the Close Box is a "punch card" which marks the Food Web Window as 
a Census Window.

Near the upper-right corner of the window are up and down arrow buttons. You
can click on these arrows to cycle forward and backward through all the
Census Windows.

Next to the up and down arrows is the Help button. Click and hold on this 
button to see a brief explanation of what this window does and how it works.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 166]


Note: Plants can be eaten but not necessarily killed, which can 
techincally be called parasitism as opposed to predation, but they're
shown here as prey.


SPECIES

This is the display of the Local Species: the species whose food web 
information is shown below. To change the Local Species, click and hold on the
down-arrow to reveal a submenu of all available choices, then slide the cursor
to your choice and release the mouse button.

In this window you can only select a single species at a time; you cannot 
choose All Plants or All Animals. Changing this species does not affect the
Selected Species in the Dashboard.


MAIN LINKS

The Main Links display is the default setting for this window, and is shown
above.

Press this button to display the main links in the food web for the current 
ecosystem. It will show up to eight predator species on the left and their
associated eight favorite prey species on the right. These are the top eight
energy transactions in the food web.

To the left of the predator icons is a bar graph showing the relative activity
of the predators.

If you click on any of shown predators or preys, they'll pop to the center and
become the Local Species and this window will enter One Species mode (see
below).
       
                                                                [PAGE: 167]



ONE SPECIES

Press this button to display the food web centered around the Local Species.

The Local Species will appear in the middle. Any and all predators will be 
listed along the left. These are the animals (if any) that eat the Local
Species.

The eight most common food sources, including prey (those who are eaten by the
Local Species) will appear along the right (if any-plants have no prey).

To the right of the prey icons is a bar graph showing how many of each prey
were caught and eaten by the Local Species.

If the Local Species is a plant, no prey will be displayed because plants 
don't go around hunting and eating things they catch. (Well, other than the
big plant in my office that likes to munch on editors that take liberties with
my writing, if you can take a hint.)

If you click on either a predator or prey, it will become the Subject Species.
Its icon will move to the middle of the display and its predators and prey 
will be shown on the left and right respectively. In this way you can move up
and down the food chain and get a complete overview.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 168]



POPULATION INTERACTION WINDOW

The Population Interaction Window displays a special type of graph of the
predator/prey relationships between different organisms in the ecosystem. 
Unlike the graphs in the Graphs Window, which map a single population against
time, this graph maps the ratios of two populations (predator and prey) 
against eachother over time.

To open the Population Interaction Window, first open the Food Web Window in
Main Links mode, then hold down the Option key (or Control key if your 
keyboard has no Option key) and click on one of the predator icons.

Note: This graph only shows the relationship between plant and animal
predation, and will not work when the prey is filter food.

This window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the Title
Bar and it will go away if you click in the Close Box.

Just below the Close Box is a punch card within a punch card that marks the
Population Interaction Window as a descendant of a Census Window.

Over on the right side of the window is the Help button. Click and hold on 
this button to see a brief explanation of what this window does and how it
works.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 169]



TIME SCALE

Click on the Days or Years buttons to choose between displaying data for the
last 50 days or the last 50 years.


DISPLAY AREA

This part of the window is a grid where the graph is displayed. The predator
is shown along the left (Y axis) the prey along the bottom (X axis). The
lower-left corner is zero population for both species. The number of living
predators is shown on the upper-left side of the grid, the number of living 
prey is shown at the lower-right.

Above the display area is a color key that lets you know which of the data 
points are older, and which are newer.


CHANGING SPECIES

Once this window is open, you can change the two species being graphed to any
two species currently loaded into the simulation. Click and hold on the down
arrow button next to either species' icon, then select the new species of your
choice.


INTERPRETING THE GRAPH

If all the data points are clustered together in a small bunch, then both the
predator and prey populations are stable. If the line is circular, then you
have a predator/prey "cycle," where the two populations directly affect each
other. If the line travels horizontally from right to left, the predator is
killing off the prey faster than they can reproduce.

In a long-lasting ecosystem, this graph will show various repeating, ever-
changing shapes and patterns that point out the chaotic nature of ecosystems.


BACK TO FOOD WEB

Clicking on this button returns you to the Food Web Window.

can click on these arrows to cycle forward and backward through all the
Census Windows.

Below the arrows is the Help button. Click and hold on this button to see a
brief explanation of what this window does and how it works.


ALL PLANTS

Click on All Plants to see the population display of the plants. The total
plant population is displayed to the right of the All Animals button, and 
icons representing all the plants are displayed below.

Bars will appear above the icons representing the relative populations of 
each plant. The higher the bar, the greater the population. If there is no 
bar, then there are no representatives of that species in the ecosystem at the
current time.


ALL ANIMALS

Click on All Animals to see the population display of the animals. The total
animal population is displayed to the right of the All Animals button and 
icons representing all the naimals are displayed below.

Bars will appear above the icons representing the relative populations of each
animal. The higher the bar, the greater the population. If there is no bar,
then there are no representatives of that species in the ecosystem at the
current time.

DIVERSITY WINDOW

The Diversity Window is a graphic display of which ecological niches are being
exploited by the current population of plants and animals.

The Diversity Window can be opened from the Windows Menu (it's in the Census
submenu) or through the Census button on the Dashboard. It can be moved around
the screen by clicking and dragging the Title Bar. It will go away if you

MAKING A LIVING

To survive in an ecosystem, plants and animals must "exploit a niche," or make
a living. Ecologically speaking, making a living is finding a way to survive -
finding food, avoiding becoming food and reproducing.

For animals, the most important parts of making a living are their type(s) of
movement and kind(s) of food they can eat.

Plants don't move, so their strategies are a little different. Different sizes
and structures of plants (trees, shrubs, water plants, etc.) are better 
adapted to different environments. Different ways of spreading seeds (fruit,
dropping, sticky, etc.) and energy-saving strategies (evergreen vs. deciduous)
work better (or don't) depending on the climate and surrounding animal life.

If a lot of different organisms eat the same kind of food, live in the same
places, and generally live the same lifestyle, there will be a lot of 
competition for resources. If different plants and animals each live a little
differently - eat different foods, move differently, spread seeds in different
ways - they are not in direct competition with each other, and more can 
survive.

Beyond non-competition, a lot of different types of plants and animals living
together, each in a different niche, become more than the sum of the 
individual organisms. They become an interrelated food web, a community, an
ecosystem. A healthy long-lasting ecosystem will have plants and animals in 
many diverse niches.


ALL ANIMALS

Click on All Animals to see the diversity display of the animals. The display
is a gridlike graph with food sources on the left (the Y axis) and types of
movement on the bottom (X axis). There is a box at each grid intersection
point of the X and Y axes. The number of animals at each intersection (Z axis)
is shown by the size and shade of the box. A key to interpreting the boxes
and the numbers they represent is provided on the right side of the window.

ALL PLANTS

Click on All Plants to see the diversity display of the plants. The display
is a gridlike graph with types of trees on the left (the Y axis) and seed and
nectar information on the bottom (X axis). There is a box at each grid 
intersection point of the X and Y axes. The number of plants at each
intersection (Z axis) is shown by the size and shade of the box. A key to
interpreting the boxes and the numbers they represent is provided on the
right side of the window.

HISTORY WINDOW

This window tracks and lists the important historical events that have 
happened in the ecosystem during the present game or experiment.

The History Window can be opened from the Windows Menu (in the Census submenu)
or through the Census button on the Dashboard.

The History Window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the
Title Bar and it will go away if you click in the Close Box.

Just below the Close Box is a "punch card" that marks the History Window
as a Census Window.

Near the upper-right corner of the window are up and down arrow buttons. You
can click on these arrows to cycle forward and backward through all the Census
Windows.

Below the arrows is the Help button. Click and hold on this button to see
a brief explanation of what this window does and how it works. 

If you click on any of the events, the icon that represents the organisms in
the event will appear next to the punch card.

The main area of the window displays the year and day of each event along with
text messages describing them. The events that are listed here include 
mutations, extinctions, species danger (hunger, thirst, no males left, no
females left), new species creations, etc.

To scroll through the list of historical events, click on the Older or Newer

LAWS OF PHYSICS

The Laws of Physics Window gives you the power to change the physical laws
and properties that deal with time and energy in your world. It can be opened
with the Change Physics... item in the Technical submenu of the Simulation
Menu.

Besides feeding one's ego by supplying such awesome power, this window
actually has very practical experimental uses. For example, changing the 
amount of energy it takes to move, such as a setting of very little energy to
fly and a lot to walk, could simulate a low-gravity world. Raising the energy
it takes to swim could simulate a world with a very viscous ocean.

Depending on your experiment, changing the physics of time can help your
efficiency. If you are interested in the behavior of one generation, make the
days and years as long as possible and increase the life span of organisms.
If you are interested in the genetic drift over many generations, shortening
the length of days and years could save you hours or days of computer time.

Many of the settings below have a range of possible values that goes from
Tiny to Low to Medium to High to Huge. Each value is twice the previous
value, i.e., Low is twice as high as Tiny, Medium is twice as high as Low,
etc.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 176]



HELP

At any time in this window you can click and hold on the Help button or on
the name of any control for a pop-up explanation of what it does.


MOVEMENT COSTS

This is where you can adjust the amount of energy it takes for an animal to
move in any of the four ways: Swimming, Walking, Climbing and Flying. Since
plants in SimLife don't move, this won't affect them.

There are five values for each movement type: Tiny, Low, Medium, High and 
Huge.

To change the movement cost, click and hold on the down-arrow button to open
a submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then 
release the mouse button.

As mentioned above, changing movement costs can simulate different gravitities
and ocean viscosties. If you use your imagination with these settings you can
come up with some interesting worlds.


FOOD VALUE

By adjusting the amount of food value - energy - supplied by each type of 
food, you directly control how much food animals need and indirectly affect
their behavior by controlling how much time they must spend looking for food
and how much time they have for other pastimes, such as looking for a mate.

There are six food sources: Animals, Plants, Filter Food, Fruit, Nectar and
Seeds. Each of these foods can be assigned a value: Tiny, Low, Medium, High,
or Huge.

To change the food value cost, click and hold on the down-arrow button to 
open a submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then
release the mouse button.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 177]


Changes in Food Values do not directly affect plants, but indirectly they will
affect how many of them will be eaten - more if their food value is low,
less if their food value is high.

These settings do not affect the Ultra-Food food sources.


METABOLISM COSTS

This section adjusts how much energy is required for metabolic processes:
Gestation, Growth and Healing. Each of these processes can be assigned a
value: Tiny, Low, Medium, High or Huge.

To change the metabolism cost, click and hold on the down-arrow button to
open a submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice,
then release the mouse button.

Gestation controls how much energy it takes to produce offspring. With a 
high energy cost for gestation, only a very well-fed organism can
"afford" to reproduce.

Growth controls how much energy it takes to recover from injury, plagues
and toxins.


HEALTH COSTS

This section adjusts how much energy is lost by health-related processes and
issues. These issues are: Toxins, Plague, Old Age, Crowding and Battle. Each
of these items can be assigned a value: Tiny, Low, Medium, High or Huge.

To change the health cost, click and hold on the down-arrow button to open
a submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then
release the mouse button.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 178]



PLANT COSTS

This section controls how much energy is required by plants to "make their
living." Plants need energy for getting food and water, growing and making
nectar, fruit, and seeds. The energy cost for food and water can be set to a
value: Tiny, Low, High, or Huge.

To change the plant costs, click and hold on the down-arrow button to open a
submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then 
release the mouse button.


SIMULATION STUFF

This section controls seven simulation factors including time. Six factors are
adjusted with a pop-up menu, the seventh with a slider bar.


LIFE SPAN

This setting adjusts the average life span for organisms in the world.

This setting is a "master control" for individual species' life spans as set
in their genetic code. This setting sets a general life span length. The 
species' genes set the percentage of this general life span they are capable
of living.

The five possible life span settings are: Brief, Short, Medium, Long and
Methuselan. To change the life span, click and hold on the down-arrow
button to open a submenu of all available choice, slide the cursor to your
choice, then release the mouse button.


DAY LENGTH

This control sets how many Ticks (simulation cycles) constitute one day. The
possible day lengths are 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 Ticks.

To change the Ticks per day, click and hold on the down-arrow button to open
a submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then
release the mouse button.

You will want long days for behavioral experiments and short days for long-
term, many-generation experiments.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 179]



YEAR LENGTH

This control sets how many days constitute one year. The possible year lengths
are 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 days.

To change the days per year, click and hold on the down-arrow button to open
a submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then
release the mouse button.


PLANT LIMIT

This control lets you put limits on the number of plants that can exist in
the world at any one time. Since the simulation runs slower with more 
organisms, you can limit the number of plants to: Unlimited, 1/2 maximum, 1/4
maximum, 1/8 maximum, 1/16 maximum, 1/32 maximum, 1/64 maximum and 1/128
maximum. The maximum is the total number of cells in the world, and depends on
world size.

To change the Plant Limit, click and hold on the down-arrow button to open a
submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then
release the mouse button.


MUTATION RATE

This adjustment controls the overall Mutation Rate in the world, over-
riding an individual species' mutation rate as set in its genetic code. This
setting sets a general rate, and the species' genes set an individual rate as
a percentage of this general rate.

To change the Mutation Rate, click and hold on the down-arrow button to open
a submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice, then
release the mouse button.


ANIMAL LIMITS

This adjustment sets the maximum number of animals that can occupy the world
at any one time. The setting is for all living species combined. The more 
animals there are, the slower the simulation runs. Setting a limit keeps 
animals from running amok and taking over all your computer's processing time.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 180]


The maximum available animals that you can set are: Unlimited, 50, 100, 200,
400, 800 and 1600.

To change the maximum animals per species, click and hold on the down-arrow
button to open a submenu of all available choices, slide the cursor to your
choice, then release the mouse button.


SOIL AND CLIMATE CHANGE

This adjustment controls how much the soil and climate will change over time.
If you want a very stable climate with little or no erosion for your 
experiments, set this slider low. If you want your ecosystem to be subjected
to wide swings in climatic conditions with erosion, set it high.


BUTTONS

At the bottom of the window are three buttons.

Click Set Defaults if you want to make the current settings in this window
the default conditions henceforth and forevermore (well, at least until you
make changes and set new defaults).

Click Never Mind if you want to make this window go away without making any
changes.

Click Make It So if you are happy with the current settings and want them to
be activated. The new settings will immediately take control of the world, but
the default settings will not be changed.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 181]



WORLD BUILDING OPTIONS

The World Building Options Window lets you set options that the simulation
uses when creating a new world. It also lets you rebuild one aspect, or data
layer, of a world without changing anything else.

It can be opened with the World Building Options... item in the Technical
submenu of the Simulation Menu.

Show Steps toggles on and off the display of each data layer as the world
is built. When the steps are shown, it takes a little longer to build the
world, but it looks so cool that it seems to go faster.

Lake Size lets you choose to have large or small lakes in the world. If you
aren't interested in water-dwelling creatures, making small lakes leaves you
more room for your landlubbers.

Temperature Zones, when selected, causes only the temperature zones to be
rebuilt the next time you build a world. This is especially useful when you
have changed a world's altitude in the Edit Window and want to update the
temperature data to the new landform.

Moisture Zones, when selected, causes only the moisture zones to be rebuilt
the next time you build a world. This is especially useful when you have
changed a world's altitude in the Edit Window and want to update the 
moisture data to the new landform.

Rivers and Lakes, when selected, causes only the rivers and lakes to be
rebuilt the next time you build a world.

Artifacts, when selected, causes only the artifact placement to be rebuilt
the next time you build a world.

Everything, when selected, causes every aspect of a world to be rebuilt
next time you build a world. This is the default setting.

Never Mind makes this window go away without making any changes.

Make It So activates the current settings and closes the window.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 182]



VARIABLE WINDOW

The Variables Window shows and lets you change the current status of any
individual organism. The information in this window is not contained in the
genetic code; it is a display of the results of the genes and environment.

This window shows the things that change during an organism's life, like
health, age, height, weight, etc., that are constantly variable. (Constantly
variable is the SimLife oxymoron of the week.) When you make changes in this
window, the changes in the organism take place immediately.

The Variables Window can be opened in two ways. From the Windows Menu - if 
and only if there is currently an organism highlighted in the Edit Window -
or directly from the Edit Window by using the Life Tool in Show Variables mode
and clicking on an organism.

The Variables Window treats plants and animals differently - not because of
prejudice, but because it recognizes the true differences between the two
types of organisms and appreciates them both for what they are.

The Title Bar contains the name of the individual, which consists of the 
species name and the individual's number. The window can be moved around
the screen by clicking and dragging the Title Bar. The window will go away if
you click in the Close Box. The window will also go away if the organism
whose variables you are inspeciting dies, so it is a good idea to pause the
simulation while inspecting variables.


PLANT VARIABLES

There are two sections to this window. The top section displays the individual
plant's current status for Health, Food supply, Water and Radiation exposure.

Each display is a bar graph, with low on the left, high on the right. You
can change (manipulate, heal, feed, starve, etc.) the plant by dragging
the black arrows under each of the bars.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 183]


The bottom section displays the Height, Weight, and Age of the plant, both
numerically and with a bar. You can change the Height and Age by dragging
the black arrows under their bars, but Weight changes autmatically in relation
to Height and other variables.

Note: If you age a seed, it will not instantly turn into a full grown tree, or
even sprout - it will become a very old seed. Old seeds die.


ANIMAL VARIABLES

The Animal Variables Window has three sections.

The top section is very similar to the top plant section. It shows the current
status for Health, Food, Water and Radiation. In addition, it has marker
arrows over Health, Food and Water to show where on the bar the animal takes
action (the arrow on the right), or is in danger (the arrow on the left). The
action and danger levels are set in the animal's genome.

The middle section  gives numerical and graphic representation of the animal's
Height, Weight and Age. The Age bar has arrows to make the action level (arrow
on the left) and danger level (arrow on the right). This section also contains
a display for Forage Count and Gestation.

Forage Count increases as an animal looks for food, and resets when food is
found. If the count reaches a certain number (depending on the Persistence
gene), the animal will try another foraging strategy.

For males, Gestation is blanked out. For females, Gestation gives the current
pregnancy status. If she is not pregnant, Gestation will be all the way to
the left. When the arrow reaches the right side of the slider, birth occurs.
Dragging the arrow all the way to the right causes the birth to occur
instantly: the SimCesarean.

The bottom section of this window is the Brain Box. Whatever the animal
is currently thinking will appear here.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 184]



PHENOTYPE WINDOW

The Phenotype Window displays any organism's "flash card" image, as seen in
the Biology Lab.

The Phenotype Window can be opened in two ways: from the Windows Menu if and
only if there is currently an organism highlighted in the Edit Window, or
directly from the Edit Window by using the Life Tool in Show Phenotype mode
and clicking on an organism.

The image in this window does not represent the actual appearance of the
organism: Its purpose is to give you some insight into the organism's size,
structure, eating habits, etc.

We constructed these images of SimLife organisms out of parts of familiar
earth animals that should have some meaning for most of us. For instance, 
looking at a phenotype of any animal, you can easily see what it eats, how
it moves and how many children it has per litter. And as mammals, we like to
think that if the picture of the head looks like a mammal it has a larger
brain than something with an isect's head. (Chauvinism? Maybe - but if any 
insects out there fell slighted you can program your own darn game.)
       
                                                                [PAGE: 185]


SPECIATE WINDOW

The Speciate Window lets you change a chosen individual organism into another
species in a few different ways.

The Speciate Window can only be opened from the Edit Window by setting the
Life Tool to Speciate and clicking on any organism.


SPECIES NAME

This is the display of the current individual organism (the Subject) that is
being speciated. Since it is an individual, it will have a number after the
species name.


MAKE ME PROTOTYPE OF SPECIES

Clicking this button will change the genotypes of all the organisms in the 
Subject's species to exactly match the Subject.

You might want to use this button if you have located one individual in a 
species that has developed an advantageous genetic trait that you want to 
share with the whole family.


MAKE ME INTO A NEW SPECIES

Click this button if you want to use the Subject as the starting point for
beginning a new species. After you click on this button, the Biology Lab
will open set to the Subject's genotype. You can rename it and save it as
a new species. Before saving, you can modify the icon and the genome (either
with the flash cards or in the Genome Window).


CHANGE ME TO SPECIES SHOWN BELOW

Click this button to transform the Subject into another species. You can 
choose the new species in the New Species box below.

If you try to turn a plant into an animal or an animal into a plant you'll
receive a caustic message proving that programmers can be just as big of
smart alecs as manual writers.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 186]



NEW SPECIES

This is a display of the species the Subject will be changed into if you click
on the Change Me To Species Shown Below button above.

To change this species, click and hold on the down-arrow to reveal a submenu
of all available choices, slide the cursor to your choice and release the
mouse button.


NEVER MIND

Click this button to close the Speciate Window without doing anything you 
might regret later.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 187]



EVALUATION WINDOW

The Evaluation Window gives you feedback on how well you are doing as an 
ecological experimenter. It visually shows the diversity of life in your
ecosystem and gives you a numerical score, a personal rating and a status
report.

The Evaluation Window can be reached through the Evaluation item in the 
Windows Menu. It can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the
Title Bar. It will go away if you click in the Close Box.


THE MAIN DISPLAY

The main area of this window is a scenic view of a potential ecosystem. There
will be pictures of plants and/or animals that represent different ecological
niches that are currently filled. The more life-forms you have, the more
diversity you have, and the better your ecosystem's chances of survival.
Click on any displayed pictures of plants or animals for more information on
the types and numbers of organisms they represent.


SCORE

This gives you numerical feedback on your skills and progress. The score is
based on the ecology score (which is a factor of a whole bunch of things 
going on in the ecosystem), with diversity of species, the number of years
the game has been in progress and the difficulty level factored in. It's easy
to get a high score for a short time, but keeping a high score for a long time
is very hard.


RATING

Rating gives you a title that describes your skill. There are 21 ratings 
ranging from Parking Lot Builder to... you'll have to find out for yourself.


STATUS

Status is a one-line description of the current ecosystem. It might point
out a problem or need, mention something nice, give you useful information
or even compliment you.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 188]



The Locate an Individual Window lets you find any currently living individual
organism. It can be opened from the Technical submenu in the Simulation Menu.


SELECTED SPECIES

Click and hold on the down-arrow button to see a submenu of all available
species. While holding the mouse button down, slide the cursor to the species
you want, and release.


NUMBER

Highlight and type in the number of the individual you want to locate.


NEVER MIND

Click this button to close the Locate An Individual Window without locating
anything.


MAKE IT SO

Click on this button when you have chosen the species and number above. The
individual, if living, will be located, highlighted and visible in the Edit
Window. If it isn't living, you will be returned to the Locate An Individual
Window for another try.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 189]



RUN CONTROL WINDOW

The Run Control Window lets you tell the simulation to pause and wait for you
after a certain amount of time. It can be opened from the Technical submenu of
the Simulation Menu. Use this window when you want to check data at certain
times without sitting at the computer, waiting and watching, ready to dive
for the pause button.

You can set it to pause after any amount of days or years, depending on your
experiment, but the most useful is 50 years. All the graphing, history and
census data is only kept in memory for 50 years: if you stop the simulation
every 50 years and save it to disk (each time under a different name), you can
get continuous data and graphs for the whole experiment.

Note: Run Control will stay active until you disable it.


NUMBER

Use the up- and down-arrows or type in the number of days or years you want
the simulation to run before pausing.


DISABLE

Click this button to disable Run Control.


DAYS

Click this button to activate Run Control and make it pause after a number of
days.


YEARS

Click this button to activate Run Control and make it pause after a number of
years.


NEVER MIND

Click this button to close the Run Control Window without activating it.


MAKE IT SO

Click on this button when you have set the amount of time you want the 
simulation to run before pausing.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 190]



SAMPLE EXPERIMENTS

There are an unlimited number of experiments you can design and run with
SimEarth. Here are just a few ideas to work with.


SEED-EATERS AND PLANTS

Design an experiment to see if, on the whole, seed-eaters do more damage or
good to plant populations.

Keep in mind:

   * Many seeds don't sprout if they don't have the right genes for sprouting
     temperature and moisture.

   * Seeds that don't sprout take up room that could otherwise be exploited
     by seeds that can sprout.

   * Seeds that are eaten never sprout.


THE BATTLE OF THE SEXLESS

Design an experiment that shows whether or not sexual reproduction (as opposed
to asexual reproduction) provided an advantage to a species.

Keep in mind:

   * The vast majority of species on earth use sex during reproduction to
     expand their gene pool.

   * Sexual reproduction requires the large energy expense of finding and
     courting a mate that could otherwise be used to find food or directly
     increase the population.

   * What is there in the real world that's missing from SimLife that might
     make your experimental outcome different?


OTHER WORLDS

A Food Web that is successful in earthlike surroundings might not do so well
if transplanted to another planet with different gravity, different ocean
viscosity, and/or different energy returns from food sources.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 191]


Design an experiment (or 10) that simulate(s) other worlds, set loose some
life, and see what happens. Then determine the genetic changes that would
allow the life to better survive in the new surroundings.

Keep in mind:

   * Different types of worlds can be designed in the Laws of Physics Window.
  
   * It will be easier to start with Food Webs that have been proven survivors
     in an earthlike setting.


GALAPAGOS

The Galapagos Islands contain the best known examples of divergent evolution
because of isolation.

Design an experiment where two populations (one on the mainland, one on an
island) are isolated from each other, and see if and how the paths that
evolution takes in the two populations differ.

Keep in mind:

   * To get the full effect, and to have different evolutionare pressures, 
     make the maindland large, and the island small.

     You'll have better luck with this one if you use a fairly large world.

   * Barriers over land or water will block walkers, but not flyers. To keep
     flying creatures from crossing the ocean, spreading their genes and
     messing up the experiment, have the island as far from the mainland as
     possible, and set the energy requirement for flying so high that an 
     animal will starve to death before it can cross the ocean.


PIG OUT

Sometimes colonists bring animals from their old homes to new lands. 
Unfortunately, these animals always escape, and often don't have any natural
enemies to keep their population down. A classic case is the pig in Hawaii. It
not only has no natural enemies, but also eats many of the native plants down
to the roots, killing them.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 192]


Design an experiment to simulate the destruction done by pigs in Hawaii, and
try to come up with a solution for the problem.

Keep in mind:

   * Setting the food value of plants to low in the Laws of Physics Window
     will cause herbivores to eat the entire plant and not just graze on the
     leaves.

   * Sometimes solutions to problems cause their own, worse problems.


CRY WOLF

Fans of the Farley Mowat book Never Cry Wolf (or the Disney movie based on the
book) know of the importance of the balance between the populations of wolves
and caribou.

Design an experiment with a stable cyclic balance between wolves (carnivores)
and caribou (herbivores), then go hunting and drastically reduce the wolf
population. See if reducing the predators is better or worse for the prey.

Keep in mind:

   * Watch the Population Interaction Window first for establishing the stable
     wolf/caribou relationship, then to see the results when the wolf 
     population drops.

   * If you haven't read the book or seen the move, I recommend both.


INBREEDING

What happens when there is not enough genetic diversity within a species'
gene pool? An April 1992 National Geographic article told of the modern-day
woes of lions living in the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania with just this
problem.

Design an experiment where the species with very little genetic diversity
faces a new environmental pressure such as dwindling food source, climate
change, or new predator.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 193]



THE CALIFORNIA WATER RUSH

For the past five years, California has been suffering from a drought. Yet
farmers still grow crops that require huge amounts of water and homeowners
want large green (thirsty) lawns.

Design an experiment where you have many water-hungry plants flourishing in a
wet environment, then slowly start to dry things up. See if you can develop
new strains of the old plants that require less water, or come up with new
plants that will meet the same needs without needing the same water.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 194]



MISCELLANEOUS SIM-STUFF


CONSERVING MEMORY

SimLife can be a memory hog. If you have limited memory, you may want to do
the following:

   * Use the smaller-sized worlds: the smaller the world, the less memory 
     the simulation needs.

   * Use the Plant and Animal Limits in the Laws of Physics Window.

   * Turn off Record All Statistics in the Technical submenu of the Simulation
     Menu.


MAKING THE SIMULATION RUN FASTER

Aside from setting the actual simulation speed in the Speed submenu of the
Simulation Menu, there are two basic ways to make the simulation run faster:
limiting memory use and limiting screen redraws.

The more information in memory, the more data the simulation has to check and
recalculate every cycle. Ways to limit memory usage are:

   * Use the smaller-sized worlds: the smaller the world, the less memory the
     simulation needs.

   * Use the Plant and Animal Limits in the Laws of Physics Window.

   * Turn off Record All Statistics in the Technical submenu of the Simulation
     Menu.

Dealing with graphics and redrawing the screen is very processor-intensive.
Ways to limit redraws are:

   * Limit the number of windows you have open at a time.

   * Keep the Edit Window small.

   * Turn off Auto Tracking in the Goodies submenu of the Simulation Menu.
     When on, Auto Tracking can cause frequen screen redraws, which slow
     things down.

   * Turn off Update All Windows in the Goodies submenu of the Simulation 
     Menu.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 195]


In addition, turning off sounds and music in the Goodies submenu of the
Simulation Menu will free up the processor a little, and will increase speed
just a little.

You can also change the day and year length in the Laws of Physics Window,
but this only changes the rate time passes, and doesn't actually make the
simulation run any faster.


THE WORLD BUILDING PROCESS

When building a new world, the simulation follows these steps:

   1. Draw fractal lines to make the upper ridges and peaks of mountain
      ranges.
   2. Use Cellular Automaton techniques to gradually and randomly bring the
      peaks of the mountains down to the plains.
   3. Pick points at mountain peaks and start rivers flowing down.
   4. Let rivers wind downhill until they hit the plains.
   5. Once on the plains, flood the rivers out into lakes.
   6. Create the moistures zones: starting along the left edge of the screen,
      the wind blows the moisture from west to east. Air picks up moisture as
      it goes over lakes, loses it over plains, drops moisture on west side of
      mountains and is drier on the east side. Since air loses moisture going
      across plains, a long plain will turn into a desert without nearby
      water.
   7. Create the temperature zones: start on left. Begin with a random but
      smooth distribution of temperatures, and sweep to the right. As you go
      over water, temperature becomes more moderate. As you go up in altitude,
      it gets colder. On flat ground, it gets hotter (desert effect). If you
      have few mountains and lakes you get a desert.
   8. Build the soil layer. The best soil is under water and in moist zones.
      The soil gets worse as you go up in altitude. If you add water, it will
      not make the soil better. If you expose previously underwater soil, it
      will be good, but will start to erode immediately.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 196]

   9. Add the filter food. Filter food follows the moisture: moist areas and
      lakes have the most. Filter food changes with the seasons: more when 
      it's warm with long days; wetness helps, too.


DATA FILE TYPES

SimLife uses a number of different types of data files to save plants, 
animals, and games. Here is a listing and explanation of each of the types.
If there are variations for your particular computer, they will be covered
in the machine-specific addendum.


GAME DATA FILE

Depending on world size and population, the Game file can range from 50KB to
500KB. The Game file does not save any of the census information.

Included information:

   * The map
   
   * All species prototypes

   * All organisms and their locations on the map

   * The state of all windows and menu settings.


INDIVIDUAL ANIMAL DATA FILE

This file holds the species prototype for a plant, and is approximately 1KB
in size. It is created from the Select Level of the Biology Lab when you
click on the Save button.


PLANT ZOO FILE

This file holds the species prototypes for a group of plants. It is created
from the Biology Lab using the Save All Plants button. Its size is 
approximately 1KB per plant.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 197]



ANIMAL ZOO FILE

This file holds the species prototypes for a group of animals. It is created
from the Biology Lab using the Save All Animals button. ITs size is
approximately 1KB per animal.


DATA LOG FILE

Data Log files are created when you activate the Data Logging option in the
Technical submenu of the Simulation Menu. When active, once a day all the
simulation memory that is viewable in the Graph Census Window is dumped to
disk.

It is in a standard ASCII tab-delimited file format and cen be loaded into
most spreadsheets and databases for charting, graphing and statistical 
analysis.

The size of this file depends on the number of species and length of the
game, and is approximately 1KB per day. This file is appendable: you can
log data during a game or experiment, stop for a while, and come back
to the game at a later time and continue logging to the same Data Log file.

The Data Log file also contain genetic descriptions of each animal that lives
during a game, plus enough genealogy info the eventually recreate the family
trees of animals in your experiments.

For more information and for the file format, see your machine-specific
addendum.

GLOSSARY

The SimLife manual provides many game-specific definitions for terms that are
working definitions relevant to gameplay. Many of the following glossary
definitions are more broad, formal denotations of terms.

Adaptive Behavior - Responses - often genetically controlled - of an 
                    individual, group or species to the environment that aid
                    survival and reproduction.

Artificial Life - The study of and attempt to simulate life and lifelike
                  processes in artificial media, including software (computer
                  simulations), hardware (robotics), and wetware (organic
                  material).

Asexual - Involving or reproducing by reproductive processes (as cell
          division, spore formation, fissions, or budding) that do not involve
          the union of individuals or germ cells: lacking sex or functional 
          sex organs.

Carnivore - An organism that feeds on animals; a flesh-eating animal.

Census - A usually complete enumeration of a population; specifically, a
         periodic governmental population count.

Chromosome - A filamentous, threadlike structure in the cell nucleus (in
             eukaryotic cells), along which the genes are located.

Deciduous - Falling off or shed seasonally or at a certain stage of 
            development in the life cycle; shedding leaves each year.

Diversity - Represented by a broad band of distinct elements or qualities; 
            characterized by variety, difference and deep range.

DNA - Any of various nucleic acids that are localized especially in cell
      nuclei that are the molecular basis of heredity in many organisms, and
      are constructed of a double helix held together by hydrogen bonds
      between purine and pyrimidine bases, which project inward from two
      chains containing alternate links of deoxyribose and phosphate.

Ecology - A branch of science concerned with the interrelationship of
          organisms and their environments.

Ecosystem - The sum total of physical features and organisms occuring in a
            given area.

Environment- The sum total of physical, chemical and biotic factors (as 
             climate, soil, and living things) that act upon on organism or an
             ecological community and ultimately determine its form and
             survival.

Evergreen - Having foilage that remains green and functional through more than
            one growing season.

Evolution - Change in the genetic makeup of a population with time; a theory
            that the various types of animals and plants have their origin in
            other preexisting types and that the distinguishable differences
            are due to modifications in successive generations.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 199]


Extinct - No longer active or existing.

Filter Food - Organic matter or minute organisms often found in water currents
              that provide a source of nutrition for certain animals.

Food Chain - the sequence of organisms, including producers, consumers, and
             decomposers, through which energy and materials are made and
             consumed in a community; an order of predation in which 
             organisms use the next usually lower member as a food source.

Foraging - A browsing, grazing or wandering search for food or provisions.

Gene - A sequence of DNA nucleotides that codes for a particular polypeptide 
       or an RNA molecule. Genes provide information for structure and 
       function in organisms and are passed on in reproduction.

Genealogy - An account of the descent of a person, family, or group from an
            ancestry or from older forms.

Genetic Drift - Change in the gene pool purely as a result of chance, and not
                a result of selection, mutation, or migration.

Genetics - A branch of biology that deals with the heridity and variation of
           organisms; the genetic makeup and phenomena of an organism, type,
           group, or condition.

Genome - The total genetic information in an organism's nucleus.

Germination - Sprouting or developing; coming into being or beginning to grow.

Gestation - The carrying of young in the uterus and the concomitant 
            developmental stages.

Herbivore - An animal that eats plants.

Humidity - Degree of wetness, especially atmospheric moisture.

Intelligence - Ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying 
               situations; the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's
               environment.

Mutation - Any relatively stable heritable change in the genetic material.

Natural Selection - Differential reproduction in nature, leading to an 
                    increase in the frequency of some genes or gene 
                    combinations and to a decrease in the frequency of others.
 
Nectar - A sweet liquid that is secreted by the nectaries of a plant, 
         sometimes a nutritional source for animals.

Niche - The functional role and position of an organism in the ecosystem.

Phenotype - The physical manifestation of a genetic trait; the features of 
            form, function, and behavior of an organism; an expression of
            interaction between genotype and environment.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 200]


Precipitation - A deposit on the earth of hail, mist, rain, sleet, or snow;
                the quantity of water deposited.

Predator - One that preys, destroys or devours; often a consumer of living
           tissue.

Prey - An animal taken by a predator as food.

Prototype - An individual that exhibits the essential features of a later 
            type; an original model on which something is patterned.

Recombination - The formation by the processes of crossing-over and 
                independent assortment of new combinations of genes in progeny
                that did not occur in the parents.

Speciation - The process of the formation of new species.

Species - A category of biological classification ranking immediately below
          the genus or subgenus, comprising related organisms or populations
          potentially capable of interbreeding.

Toxin - A poisonous substance that is a specific product of the metabolic
        activities of a living organism and is usually very unstable, notably
        toxic when introduced into the tissues, and typically capable of
        inducing antibody formation.

                                AMIGA VERSION
 
                               Typed by Rygar!
 
                               Supplied by JBM
 
 



                             SYSTEM INFORMATION
 
                              
HARDWARE REQUIRED
 
 
AGA VERSION:
 
A1200, A4000 using Workbench 3.0 with 2 MB of RAM. A
hard drive is recommended.
 
STANDARD VERSION:
 
A500, A500+, A600, A1200, A1500, A2000, A3000, A4000 using
Workbench version 1.3 or higher with a minimum 1 MB of RAM 
although 2 MB is recommended. A hard drive is also recommended.
 
 
GENERAL INFORMATION
 
This Addendum / Quick Start Guide contains all the Amiga - specific
information to play SimLife.
 
There are two versions of SimLife for the Amiga: AGA which fully
supports A1200 and A4000 machines utilising the AGA graphics
chipset and STANDARD which supports all non AGA Amiga
machines.
 
The disks supplied have been compressed and will require
decompressions before use. If you intend to play SimLife from
floppies, please ensure that you have 3 formatted blank disks for the
game to install onto. See Installation instructions below.
 
 
NO COPY PROTECTION

SimLife is not copy protected. This is an experiment and a big leap
of faith for us. We are trusting you not to give away copies of this
game. Copy protection is a pain - for all of us - and we'd like to stop
using it forever, but if SimLife falls victim to piracy, then we will
revert to using protection on future products.


HIGH RESOLUTION MODE
 
If you are using the AGA version of SimLife you have the
capabilities of operating in high resolution mode if you have a
multisync monitor attached. The standard version may also be
operated in high resolution if you have a flicker fixer and 2MB or
more with a multisync monitor.
 
 
QUICK-START GUIDE INSTALLATION
 
Both AGA and STANDARD versions of the SimLife program have 
identical installation programs. To install SimLife:

    1. Insert the SimLife Disk 1 into your internal disk drive.
    2. Reset you Amiga.
    3. Follow the on screen instructions choosing graphical
       requirements and install destination (either floppy or hard disk),
       swapping disks when necessary.


STARTING THE PROGRAM

FROM HARD DISK

After installation (see above), using Workbench open the folder that
the game has been installed to and double-click on the SimLife icon 
to play.

FROM FLOPPY DRIVE

Insert the disk labelled `SIMLIFE1' into your internal drive and reset
your machine. The game will load automatically.


THE ON-SCREEN TUTORIAL

After starting SimLife, you will see the New Game Window. Click on
the Tutorial button, then on Play Scenario to start the On-screen
Tutorial. You will then be walked through the basics of SimLife. A
special Tutorial Menu will appear to help you navigate and access 
special Help screens.

There are two additional tutorials in the manual that will take you on
a more complete tour of SimLife and demonstrate how to design, set
up and carry out a SimLife experiment.


SPECIAL AMIGA FEATURES

Following is an explanation of any and all features and functions of
SimLife on the Amiga that weren't covered in the manual.


LOADING AND SAVING FILES

All file loading and saving is achieved through the standard Amiga
file requester. In addition, SimLife gives you the option of keeping
backup copies of the previous versions of each of these files. If you
want a backup, click in the Make Backups box in the Save File
dialogue box.


SOUNDS

Most sounds in SimLife happen in response to your actions, but there
are three sounds that occur to notify you of important events that you
might not otherwise notice.

    Oooooh - this moan is the sound of an animal dying.
    Ooh-la-la - this is the sound of animals mating.
    Fanfare - this sound announces a birth.


BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE SIMS

SimLife is a powerful simulation engine that can be put to use in a
number of different ways, both useful and silly. We've included a few
saved games on one of the disks that show some of these uses (or
abuses). Try them out. See if you can figure out what they are
and why.


DATA LOGGING

An advanced, but very useful feature in SimLife is Data Logging.
When you activeate the Data Logging... item in the Technical
Submenu of the Simulation Menu, the program will write a lot of data
to disk in a standard text file. This information can then be loaded
into a spreadsheet or other statistical program, and you can make all
the graphs and charts you could ever want.

Warning: The Data Log File can get huge. Depending on the size 
of the world and the number of plants and animals in it, this file
can take up to 100KB per year. Make sure you have the disk space.

When you activate Data Logging, you will be presented with a
dialogue box that lets you name the data file and tell the computer
where to save it.


DATA LOGGING FILE SAVING OPTIONS

In addition to the usual Amiga file saving controls, you
can set a few other options.

Append to Existing File

Sometimes you might run SimLife with Data Logging, 
take a break (to work - or better yet, play SimCity),
the come back to SimLife later. If you want to
continue Data Logging where you left off, and have
the data go into the same data file you were using
before, use the same file name and check this box.

Data Checkboxes (A.K.A. Flags)

You can choose what data to save to disk by
checking the following boxes. If you hold
down the Option key while checking a box,
they will all be checked. If you hold down
the Option key while unchecking (clearing)
a box, they will all be unchecked.

An explanation of what information each checkbox represents can be
found starting on the next page, as part of the complete description of
the Data Log file format.
 
 
DATA LOGGING FILE FORMAT

In order to make use of this data once you get it into a spreadsheet (or
other program), you'll need to know how all the data is arranged.

Each line in the data log file starts with the four-letter abbreviation, as
seen next to each checkbox, that indentifies the type of information the
line contains, followed by one or more data fields. Fields are
separated from each other by a single Tab. Lines are separated by a
Return. The first data field is the simulation time, showing the year,
day, and tick of the event being reported. On most lines, the next field
is either a species or an Orgot (an individual SimLife Organism)
identifier code, which consists of a flag indicating whether this is a plant
or an animal species, the species number and version, and specific organism if
applicable. The remaining fields are different for each message type as noted.


Type    Year.Day.Tic   Date         Time     Message
NOTE    0000.000.000   92/06/01     17:12:51 "Log started"

These are human-readable messages that report when the data log was started
or closed, as well as when a game is paused, the simulation time is reset to
zero, or a game is loaded.


Type    Year.Day.Tic   SpeciesID    Event    Message
HIST    0000.000.000   1.19.01.000  2        "Wheatgrass' has only seeds left"

All messages that appear in the History window will be recorded to the data
log as they occur.

Each time a species is created, the event is reported.


Type    SpeciesID      Species Name
LEGN    0.00.01.000    "Elephant"

At the beginning of each data log is a legend or listing of each species
identifier and species name. This can be used as a key to look up the name of
a species from its identifier number.


Type    Year.Day.Tic   OrgotID      MothersID      Genetic Data
GENE    0000.000.000   1.00.01.001  1.00.01.000    See below

Each time a plant or animal is populated or born, the genetic information for
that individual is reported. Since animals have more genetic data than plants,
animals have several additional fields in addition to the basic fields.


DATA and YEAR Fields

All of the following fields are recorded for DATA (daily census statistics)
and YEAR (yearly census summaries) for each active species.

Simulation time; Species ID: Total species population, including seeds for
plants; for plant species, the number of seeds, if any; Species population,
not including unsprouted seeds; Number of births or sprouts in this species;
Number of deaths in this species; Water level for this species; Health level
for this species; Number of females in the species population; Average age of
the species population; Average size of the species population; Total biomass
of this species.


GENE Fields for Plants

These are the fields recorded for each individual plant:

Simulation time; OrgotID: OrgotID of this orgot's mother; Food Store gene;
Water Store gene; Health Store gene; Height gene; Mutation gene; Life span
gene; Stealth gene; Birth/Death gene; Movement/food source gene; Reserved gene
(not used for genetics).
