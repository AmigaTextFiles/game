@{b}KHELBEN'S LETTER TO THE PARTY@{ub}

Khelben Blackstaff, mystic advisor to the Lords of WaterDeep, sends you the
following letter :

  Dear Heroes of Waterdeep,

  I am glad to see that you are all fully recovered from the rigors of your
  ordeal in the sewers beneath Waterdeep. Our healers were more than happy
  to help you return to your fighting trim.

  Congratulations on being named the guests of honour at the harvest
  festival in the city of Waterdeep. From the reports of the revelry I
  surmise that a good time was had by all.

  Also, our scholars very much appreciated your donation of the historic
  artifacts that you recovered beneath our city. The study of the scrolls,
  keys, and stone items should give us an important new understanding of
  our city's history.

  Unfortunately, another situation has arisen that could threaten the
  city. For some time there have been rumours of people dissappearing
  from villages to the North and west if the City. Now, we have
  written confirmation of the discovery of human remains in shallow
  graves. Evil forces and a powerful ancient artifact may be involved.

  Thank you for volunteering to investigate the area to the north and
  west of the city where these events have occured. Included with this
  letter are copies of the documents that aroused our suspicions.
  Provisions have been provided for your journey. Good Luck.

  Your trusted friend,

  Khelben.

@node OLTEC'SREPORT "OLTEC'S REPORT"
@{b}OLTEC'S REPORT @{ub}

With the previous letter, Khelben enclosed the following report from Oltec,
Captain of the City Guard of Waterdeep.


  Master Blackstaff,

  We may again have trouble near the city of Waterdeep.

  After the annual harvest festival, the City Guard made its routine sweeps
  searching for lost and drunken revelers. On the second path off the north
  road, we came upon the remains of an overturned carriage.

  The driver had been killed by an arrow through his heart. There was a
  small amount of blood inside the carriage. However, the carriage horses
  were grazing nearby and the dead driver still had his purse full of
  coins. This was not a simple robbery, for the attackers did not take the
  coins or the horses. The only thing missing from the carriage seemed to
  be the passenger.

  Our tracker followed a faint trail of blood from the carriage off into
  the soft sand at the side of the road. There, she pointed out a deeply
  set boot print, as if someone were carrying a heavy load. The attacker
  must have been carrying the passenger away after the battle.

  We searched the area, but lost the trail in the harder ground to the
  north. The only fruit of our search was a small wooden box that had
  fallen beneath a bush along the attacker's trail. The box contained
  a bound journal, the writings of that eccentric scholar Wently Kelso.

  I am aware that scholar Kelso's journals were valuable in the past.
  They helped verify the existance of that nefarious threat in the sewers
  beneath waterdeep. However, Kelso's infernal investigations of
  obscure occurences in the city have also been the bane of my men on more
  than one occasion.

  Because of Kelso's history, I personally examined the journal. I am
  glad I did for it's writings foretell ominous events. The journal
  contains notes of evil occurences and a powerful artifact. It speaks
  of an evil vision and of human remains found in shallow graves. Could
  these graves be connected with the mysterious disappearances to the
  north that my men have reported ?

  My source have confirmed that scholar Kelso was seen riding in a carriage
  late on the last night of the harvest festival. People who he met during
  the festival mentioned that Kelso spoke of investigating a new mystery.
  I believe that we should treat both this journal and the threat it infers
  as genuine.

  As this matter does not yet directly threaten Waterdeep, it is outside
  the jurisdiction of the City Guard. Rather than forward the entire
  journal, I had a scribe copy the relevant entries for you. I trust you
  will take the necessary actions to ensure that nothing mentioned therein
  becomes a threat to the city or it's citizens.

  Yours,

  Oltec.

  Captain.
  Waterdeep City Guard.

archaeologist".


@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 356 @{ub}

As i carefully pulled myself out of the sewers of Waterdeep, my hand
slipped on a particularly slick stone. Only as I fell did I realise that
the stone was slick with blood from my wounded hand. I fell headlong into
an embankment. My skull bouned against a large boulder and my vision
fainted.

How many hours I lay there bleeding I do not know. Suddenly a warm
sensation flowed throughout my body. I slowly opened my eyes. Before me
stood a large robed figure, backlit by an unearthly glow. In the brightness
I could only the outline of fine features and a dark complexion beneath the
hooded robe.

    " You are healed. I have save you for without aid you would
      have surely died."

I put my hand to my head. My head throbbed, but neither my head nor my hand
were bleeding.

    " Saving me was a very civilised thing for you to do.
      What do you want from me ? "

He seemed to grow larger and his eyes glowed red from under his hood.

    " I ask nothing from you but your undivided attention!"

He opened his hand and placed his gloved palm on my throbbing head. I was
overwhelmed by an intense vision.

In the woods, there was a quiet village on a dark, overcast day. Peasants
in ragged clothes move throughout the village, selling goods, talking, and
just walking along the narrow dirt streets. A woman in a blue gown adorned
with silver stars stood at one end of the town square talking to some of
the peasants.

In the woods outside the village, dark figures moved into position. From
the edge of the wood, a robed figure moved slowly toward the village
square. At the square, it mounted the low structure that enclosed the
drinking well. In it's gloved hand, the figure held a gleaming sceptre.

    " Citizens of Torzac," he declared
    " hear me now!"

The peasants turned towards the speaker and mumbled to themselves. A few
moved closer. A few backed away.

    " From this time forward I am your new ruler!
      I will allow no resistance!"

Some citizens openly laughed. Others swore at him. Many just turned to walk
away. One of the locals stepped forward.

    " Any who might you be? Show yourself so we might know
      our future ruler!"

With his empty hand, the figure pulled back his hood. The slender elven
face was marred only by the blue-black complexion of a Drow. The dark elf
warrior scowled down with disdain at the crowd of peasants.

The villag went completely silent. Many peasants froze where they stood.
Some picked up stones but dared not throw them.

The woman in the star-decked gown strode forward, weaving her hands in a
complex pattern. "Dark warrior, you will never rule a living soul in my
home village!" She thrust her hands forward and missiles of magical energy
darted at the arrogant drow.

The drow flashed an evil toothy smile and laughed from atop his perch. With
a scornful wave of the gleaming sceptre, the magical missiles dissipated
into nothingness.

Some villagers, emboldened by the attack, hurled stones at the drow. Most
flew wide. But a single stone cut him on the cheek. The drow slowly passed
a gloved finger across the cut. He looked down at his hand and saw a single
drop of his own blood. His mad eyes blazed with hatred.

    " I said no resistance!"

Dozens of dark warriors charged from the woods all around the village. The
woman began to gesture frantically, but was hit by an arrow before she
could cast another spell. Some villagers tried to flee, others to fight. It
made no difference. The village was detroyed. All inside were cut down. Not
one survived.

The victorious drow gathered around the remains of the village square. The
leader replaced his hood and raised his sceptre in triumph. The dark
warriors raised the bloody swords in salute.

This is where the vision ended. I awoke with my head resting upon the
boulder. My head throbs even more than before but I am still alive.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 378 @{ub}

The discovery of the history and location of the scpetre in my vision is
my latest investigation. It seems to be an artifact of the drow, and
should be of great scholarly value. My first task is to track down the
village of Torzac.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 381 @{ub}

After reviewing my vision, I believe the village I saw could be somewhere
near Waterdeep. The thatching on the hut roofs is of a type that was common
years ago to the poor villages to the North of the city. The colour of the
clay in the bricks of the well is common in streams to the north and the
east. The city records may shed some light on the location of the village.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 399 @{ub}

I began my search in the records office of the Waterdeep treasury. Nowhere
in the records of the new reign of the Lords of Waterdeep have I found a
mention of the village of Torzac.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 408 @{ub}

I was about to give up my search and call the whole thing a hallucination
when I came upon an ancient taxation record. In part it reads:

    Lord Torzac:

    According to our records, three of your citizens owe us a percentage
    of their fall harvest. Could you please look into this matter? I will
    meet with you to discuss further trading arrangements before the
    first new moon ........

Then I found this letter to the taxation office:

    .... We followed the directions to the village explicitly, but there
    was nothing to be found. There was no village nor a Lord Torzac. Our
    only guess is that the whole community moved and destroyed the village
    before they left.

The letter includes instructions on how to reach the village site. This is
a major breakthrough and I feel it is just a matter of time before I find
the village and the sceptre!

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 420 @{ub}

After bidding goodbye to my sweet Miltinda, I began my expedition. I have
full supplies and high hopes.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 427 @{ub}

I have found what seems to be the remains of the village. The wooden
buildings do not remain, but the layout of the remains of the stone
buildings corresponds exactly to the village in my vision. Large trees now
grow on the site of the former village square. Given the size of the trees,
the destruction of the village must have taken place a very long time ago.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 429 @{ub}

I hired a local guide to support me in my investigations. The guide is a
halfling named Insal. Like my last guide, Insal is of very minimal
intelligence. The forest in this area seems overrun with wolves. We spend
much of our time on the move to avoid attracting the interest of the
wolves.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 431 @{ub}

We have come across several shallow grave sites, but their occupants were
recently buried humans and therefore couldn't have been the people of
Torzac. There seem to be no human settlements in the area. This is good,
people are always getting in the way and make true archaeology much more
difficult. I have begin searching the area for signs of underground drow
construction as that is the place most likely to still hold the sceptre
after all this time.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 451 @{ub}

Two female warriors came through our camp this night. I attempted to
question them about underground sites in the local area or any sightings of
the sceptre. They were either uncooperative or uninformed. In the end,
Insal leered at both women so they left in a huff.

@{b}JOURNAL ENTRY 456 @{ub}

I have searched the area for above-ground signs of drow sites and found
nothing. After I return to Waterdeep for additional supplies I will also
have to search this area for structures that may hide drow underground
constructions.

I have discharged Insal so that I can travel more quickly. He seemed
unhappy to go but I paid him off with a few shiny baubels, rusted weapons,
and dented copper coins. With luck I should return to WaterDeep in time to
spend the harvest festival with my sweet Matilda.

The majority of the rules in this book assume that you have a mouse.
However, anything that you can do with the mouse, you can also do with the
keyboard. (The keyboard commands may not be available on all systems...
check the Data Card for details.)

To generate a character use the cursor keys to move the highlight box over
the desired option and press the enter key when ready.

In the game, one item in a character's hand or inventory is surrounded by
an item highlight box. Use the W,A,S and Z keys like a cursor key pad to
move the highlight box from item to item.

        W     -  Move item highlight box up.
        A     -  Move item highlight box left

To attack you must have weapons "in-hand" and "ready."  "In-hand" means the
iten is in a hand. "Ready" means the item is ready for use. (If the weapon
is greyed out it is unusable.)

  To attack, right-click on a ready weapon on the adventure screen. Be
  sure to RIGHT-CLICK. If you left-click you will find yourself picking
  the item up instead of attacking!.

Note that you can have an item "in-hand" but not readied. For example, if
you hold a two-handed weapon, you cannot "ready" items in your other hand.
The other hand is greyed out. If you want you could place an item in the
greyed out hand, but you would not gain any benefit from having it there.

Characters fight with three basic types of weapons: melee, thrown and
ranged.

Characters with melee weapons (axes, swords etc..) may only attack if they
stand in the front rank. The two characters with portraits on the top row
are in the front rank. Consider the other characters as being in the rear
rank.

Characters with thrown and ranged weapons (daggers, dart etc..) can be
anywhere in the party. To attack with a thrown weapon, right-click on the
ready weapon in the adventure screen. After the fight, you will have to go
pick up the thrown weapon and ready it again.

Ranged weapons require ammunition. Arrows for bows must be placed in the
characters quiver. Rocks for slings may be placed anywhere on the
characters equipment screen. To attack with a ranged weapon, right-click on
the ready weapon in the adventure screen. After the fight, you will have to
go pick up the ammunition and replace it on the equipment screen.

Characters such as Mages and clerics are spellcasters who use magic to
fight and to heal. Spellcaster MUST rest in order to gain their spells.
Once spells are memorised or prayed for, they are ready to use. However,
keep in mind, that each time spellcasters use a spell, they forget how to
cast it. They must rest again to regain it.

Before you go into any serious combat, have your spellcasters memorise
spells, pray for spells and rest.

Mages spend their lives seeking out new spells to add to their spell book.
They must memorise these spells before using them.

Clerics and high-level Paladins pray for their spells. This is because
these spells are insights; they are not memorised as with mages.

To ready the spells, go into camp, and select Memorise Spells and Pray for
spells. (If there is more than one character that fits the category, choose
the character that you want to work with.) Click in a number from the spell
level across the top of the list, and click on the spell names to choose
the spells you want to memorise. Repeat this for all the different levels
of spells your magic user knows, and then press exit just once to return to
the camp menu.

Repeat the above process for all the spellcasters in your party.

Once spells have been selected for all of the spellcasters, choose Rest
party. The spellcasters will learn the spells you selected. From here on,
whenever the party rests, the spellcasters will rememorise the same spells.

If you adventure for a while and realise that you want your spellcasters to
memorise a different breakdown of spells, then the next time you camp just
go into Memorise spells or pray for spells, Select Clear and then reselect
spells.

All spells are cast from the adventure screen. To cast a spell, right-click
on the spellcaster's spellbook or holy symbol. The spell box apeears over
the compass on the adventure screen. Click on the level of the spell to
cast and then click on the spell itself. If the spell affedts a specific
character in the party, click in the prtrait of the recipient.

@{b}GENERATING CHARACTERS. @{ub}

You must generate four characters to have a complete party. A good mix of
races and classes is essential to completing the adventure. Warrior classes
such as fighters, paladins and rangers are needed to deal with the many
horrors that block your path. Clerics and mages support the quest with
their magical abilities - clerics have powerful healing and protective
spells, while mages attack with mystic force. Thieves are handy when
progress is barred by a locked gate for which the party has no key.

This section contains basic instructions for creating a new party. For
detailed information about selecting characters for a party see the "Your
characters and your party" section on page 23.

To create a charcter click on one of the four character boxes. After you
have chosen a box, choose the new character's race and gender, class,
alignment and portrait. You can click on the Back button to change your
last choice.

@{b}RACE. @{ub}

There are six races of character to choose from :

        * HUMAN         * ELF

        * HALF-ELF      * DWARF

        * GNOME         * HALFLING

Each race has unique advantages and characteristics. Different races are
eligible for different classes and each has unique modifiers to ability
scores such as strength or wisdom.

@{b}CLASS @{ub}

Classes are occupations. Some races have the option of having more than one
class simultaneously, but there are six basic options:

        * FIGHTER       * RANGER

        * PALADIN       * MAGE

        * CLERIC        * THIEF

The party needs a variety of classes to get all of the necessary skills for
the adventure. (Paladins will not join parties with evil characters. If you
already have an evil character you cannot generate a Paladin.) 

@{b}ALIGNMENT @{ub}

Alignment is the philosiphy by which a character lives and deals with the
world. There are nine possible alignments, although a characters class may
limit the selection. Paladins, for example, can only be Lawful Good.
The choices are:

   * LAWFUL GOOD    * LAWFUL NEUTRAL    * LAWFUL EVIL.

   * NEUTRAL GOOD   * TRUE NEUTRAL      * NEUTRAL EVIL.

   * CHAOTIC GOOD   * CHAOTIC NEUTRAL   * CHAOTIC EVIL.

@{b}PORTRAIT @{ub}

The character portrait is a picture that represents the character during
the game. Click on the arrows to display different portraits, and then
click on a portrait to select it.

@{b}ABILITY SCORES @{ub}

After you choose a character portrait the computer generates "ability
scores" for the character. These numbers are a summary of natural abilities
and the faculties. Each character has the following scores:

        * Strength (STR)

        * Intelligence (INT)

        * Wisdom  (WIS)

        * Dexterity (DEX)

        * Constitution (CON)

        * Charisma (CHA)

For more information see the "Ability scores" section on page 27. You may
modify and keep these scores with the Modify and Keep Controls.

@{b}OTHER CHARACTERISTICS. @{ub}

Characters also have numberic values for the following
characterisitics:

        * Armour class (AC)

        * Hit points  (HP)

        * Level (LVL)

@{b}MODIFYING AND KEEPING CHARACTERS. @{ub}

@{b}REROLL @{ub}- generates a new set of ability scores for the character.

@{b}MODIFY @{ub}- allows you to change characters ability scores and hit points. For
         example, use this to match a favourite AD&D game character. After
         selecting MODIFY , click the ability score to be changed, and then
         click on the plus or minus button to alter the ability score.
         Click on the OK button when you are finished.

@{b}FACES @{ub} - allows you to select a different character portrait.

@{b}KEEP @{ub}  - places the character into your party line up.

Name your character after selecting KEEP. Once you enter a name, the new
character joins the party!.

@{b}DELETING CHARACTERS. @{ub}

You can delete a character before you select PLAY. To delete, click on the
portrait and then click on the delete button.

@{b}WHEN THE PARTY IS COMPLETE. @{ub}

When you have generated four characters, a PLAY  button appear underneath
the portraits. Click on the PLAY button to begin the game.

adventure screen. All movement, combat, spellcasting and exploration
happens from this screen. When other screens are active, they may overlay

best results, place your fighters in the front rank and your magic users in
the rear rank.

@{b}CHARACTER BASICS @{ub}

Your part contains four characters, each with their own unique strengths
and weaknesses. Every chracter has a race, class, and set of ability
scores.

Race is the character's species and there are six races to choose from :
dwarf, elf, gnome, half-elf, halfling and human.

Class is the characters occupation. The basic choices are : Cleric,
fighter, ranger, mage, paladin, thief or multi-class. Some races are
allowed to have more than one class simultaneously; there are called
multi-class characters. Thirteenth level is the maximium level for all
classes in this game.

Ability scores define the characters physical and mental prowess, and they
are : strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution and charisma.

@{b}RACES @{ub}

@{b}DWARVES  @{ub}

Dwarves are a short, heavily built demi-human race. They stand between 4
and 4 1/2 feet tall, but generally weigh more than 150 pounds due to their
heavily muscled build. Dwarves live from 350 to 400 years. They are famous
for their skill in all crafts, from metalworking to stone masonry. Dwarven
weapons command high prices in markets around the world, and pieces of
their fine jewellery are part of every king's ransom. Dwarves are also
known for tremendous courage and tenacity that borders on the fanatic.

Dwarves are, by nature, non magical and have innate resistance to spells as
well as many poisons.

@{b}* Ability score modifiers; @{ub}Dexterity - 1 , Constitution +1 , Charisma -2

@{b}* Allowable classes ; @{ub}Cleric , fighter, thief, fighter/thief,

@{b}* Level restrictions ; @{ub}Cleric, 10th level;
                       Thief 12th level.


@{b}ELVES @{ub}

Elves are slimmer and somewhat shorter than the average human and are
easily distinguished by their fine features and pointed ears. They often
live more than 1200 years. Elves do not like the confines of civilisation.
They delight in natural beauty, singing, and carefree playing. To
outsiders, elves often appear to be haughty and cold, although they are
known to be fiercely loyal to friends.

Elves of all classes are taught archery from a very young age, and receive
a +1 bonus with any type of bow, and long or short swords. Elves are highly
resistant to any type of Sleep or Charm spells. Raise Dead spells do not
affect elves.

@{b}GNOMES  @{ub}

Gnomes are distant kin of the dwarves, although the latter are loathed to
admit the relation. Gnomes typically live to be around 600 years old. Where
dwarves are tacitiurn and hard working, the gnomes are more carefree and
lively. Never turn your back on a gnome because they are enthusiastic
practical jokers.

Gnomes are fairly magic resistant.

@{b}* Ability score modifiers ; @{ub}Intelligence +1, Wisdom - 1

@{b}* Level Restrictions ; @{ub}Cleric, 9th level. Fighter 11th level.



@{b}HALF-ELVES  @{ub}

Half elves inherit several advantages from their mixed parentage. They
resemble their elvish parents in facial appearance, but half-elves are
taller and heavier than most elves, approaching human norms. While not as
long lived as true elves, they live, on average, about 250 years. For the
most part, half-elves can travel and mingle in both elvish and human
company, although rarely are they truly accepted in either.

Half-elves has the greatest selection of class combinations of any of the
races. They inherit an innate resistance to sleep and charm spells, but to
a lesser extent that full-blooded elves.

@{b}HALFLINGS @{ub}

Halflings are a diminutive people famous for their congeniality and love of
comfort. Their facial features are round and broad and they trypically have
curly hair. Halflings are very short, a little shorter than dwarves and
quite plump. They are sturdy, industrious, and generally quiet and
peaceful. Their burrow homes are well furnished and their larders are
always well stocked. Halflings are well like by nearly all other races.
Gnomes especially like the halflings whom they feel are kindred spirits.

Halflings have innate magical resistance and have a +1 bonus with slings.

@{b}HUMANS @{ub}

Humans are the most adaptable and hence, most prevalent race. Humans vary
more than any other race in size, skin colour and hair colour. Typically
they live around 70 years. Human societies are more diversified than any of
the other races, and also more aggressive and materialistic. where the
longer-lived races wait patiently and take a longe-range view of the world,
humans tend to muster their efforts for immediate gain.

@{b}* Ability score modifiers ; @{ub}NONE

@{b}* Allowable Classes ; @{ub}Cleric, Fighter, Mage, Paladin, Ranger, Thief.

@{b}* Level REstrictions ; @{ub}Maximum for game.

@{b}CLASSES @{ub}

Each class has its own unique strengths, and each offers valuable talents
and skills to a party. Fighter-types (fighters, rangers and paladins) are
needed to battle past the creatures that stand in the way of victory and
glory. Thieves are very handy when the party runs across traps and locked
doors. Mages offer powerful spells and clerics can both fight opponents and
heal wounded party members.

Each class has one or more prim requisite, or ability scores that are
important to the class. A Character with prime requisite scores of 16 or
greater advances somewhat faster in levels.


@{b}CLERICS. @{ub}

Clerics are warrior priests, men and women who carry their faith in their
weapon-arms as well as their hearts. Cleric training includes the use of
divine magic and a limited selection of weapons. They can use any typeof
armour, but their selection of arms is limited to blunt, impact type
weapons such as maces and flails.

Clerical magic differs from mage spells in that clerical magic is of devine
original. Clerics do not carry tomes of spells and rituals. They receive
power directly from the gods and cast spells throught their holy symbols.
While mages study and pour over their spells to imprint the rituals in
their minds, clerics enter a meditative trance where they are receptive to
the divine magic. Clerics also have powers against undead monsters such as
skeletons. The ability to 'turn undead' is listed on the cleric's list of
1st-level spells and is used like a spell. However, becuase it is an
ability it does not go away when used. As clerics advance in levels they
gain more spells and greater power against undead. Clerics with wisdom of
13 or higher gain extra spells. See the "Cleric wisdom Spell Bonus" talbe
on page 52).

@{b}* Prime requisite : @{ub}Wisdom.

@{b}* Races Allowed   : @{ub}Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome , Half-Elf, Halfling.

@{b}* Weapons Allowed : @{ub}Mace, Flail, Staff, Sling.




@{b}FIGHTERS @{ub}

Fighters are warriors, experts in using weapons and in battle tactics.
Fighter training includes use and maintenance of all manner of weapons and
and armour. Figthers can use any type of armour or weapon without
restriction. Wether for glory or profit, fighters can be found in the
thickest parts of battles, where only skill and bravery triumph.

Fighters cannot cast any type of magical spells, they rely on their string
swordarm. They can use any type of magical weapon or armour. They can also
use magical items such as rings and gauntlets. Fighters gain speed as well
as skill when they go up in levels. High level fighters (including paladins
and rangers), are able to attack more often with melee weapons such as
swords than other tpyes of characters.

@{b}* Prime requisite  : @{ub}Strength.

@{b}* Races Allowed    : @{ub}ALL

@{b}* Weapons Allowed  : @{ub}ALL

@{b}MAGES @{ub}

Mages are individuals trained in the arcane and mysterious secrets of
magic and spellcasting gestures. Mages tend to be poor fighters,
preferring to rely on their intellect and magical abilities. While warriors
and clerics may charge to the fore of a batlle, mages tend to hang back and
pummel foes with mystic attacks.

Mages cannot wear any types of armour because armor is restrictive and it
interferes with spellcasting. Also, because of their lack of martial
incliniation, mages are severly limited in the weapons they can use. Mages
become very powerful as they increase in level.

@{b}* Prime Requisite : @{ub}Intelligence.

@{b}* Races Allowed   : @{ub}Human, Elf, Half-elf.

@{b}* Weapons Allowed : @{ub}Dagger, Staff, Dart.


@{b}PALADINS. @{ub}

Paladins are elite warriors who battle in the name of justice and truth.
Lawfulness and good deeds are their meat and drink, and they lead lives of
such chaste piety that even clerics stand respectful. Paladins will not
join a party that includes evil characters. Like other high level fighters,
paladins are able to attack more often with melee weapons such as swords
than other types of characters.

In addition to skill in all types of arms and armour, paladins have several
divine magical abilities. Paladins have extra resistance to magical attacks
and poison, and they are immune to all disease. Paladins can heal once per
day with their 'lay on hands' ability (two hit points per level of
advancement). The lay on hands ability is similar to the cure light wounds
clerical spell. Paladins are always surrounded by an aura of protection.
Because of this aura, all evil attackers suffer a penalty to their attacks.

At 3rd level paladins can turn undead as a cleric two levels below their
own. At 9th level, paladins gain the ability to cast certain cleric spells,
although they can never use cleric scrolls. Paladins pray for their spells
and cast them exactly as clerics.

@{b}Paladins can use the following cleric spells : @{ub}BLESS, CURE LIGHT WOUNDS,
DETECT MAGIC, PROTECTION FROM EVIL, SLOW POISON.

@{b}* Prime requisites : @{ub}Strength , Charisma.

@{b}* Races Allowed    :@{ub} Only Human.

@{b}* Weapons Allowed  :@{ub} All


@{b}RANGERS @{ub}

Rangers are trained hunters, trackers and woodsmen. They are taught to live
as much by their wits and skills as by their swords and bows. Like
fighters, rangers can use any type of weapon or armour although heavy armor
interferes with their special abilities.

When wearing studded leather or lighter armour, rangers can fight with
weapons in both hands without any penalties. Like other high-level fighter
types, rangers are able to attack more often with melee weapons such as
swords, than other types of characters.

@{b}* Prime requisites  : @{ub}Strength,  Dexterity,  Wisdom.

@{b}* Races Allowed     : @{ub}Human, Elf, Half-elf.

@{b}* Weapons Allowed   : @{ub}All

@{b}THIEVES @{ub}

Thieves are hard to classify as a group. Some are malcontents who prey on
the unsuspecting. Others are basically good but a little wanting in
strength of character. Adventurers long ago learned that a skilled thief in
the party increases overall party survival -- especially when dealing with
trapped locks. As thieves gain levels they become more proficient at
picking locks and avoiding any attached traps.

Becasue they need to move freely and quietly thieves' abilities are
restricted when they wear anything except leather type armour. Thieves have
a grater choice of weapons than clerics or mages.

@{b}* Prime requisite  : @{ub}Dexterity.

@{b}* Races Allowed    : @{ub}All.

@{b}* Weapons Allowed  :@{ub} Any.



@{b}ALIGNMENTS. @{ub}

Alignment describes a characters outlook and how he deals with life. The
possibilities encompass a range of views from believing strongly in society
and altruism (Lawful good) to completely selfish and without any regard for
others (Chaotic evil). Aligment is present in two parts: the characters
world view and the characters ethics.


@{b}WORLD VIEW @{ub}

@{b}LAWFUL @{ub}- indicates that the character works within the framework and rules
         of society.

@{b}NEUTRAL@{ub}- indicates that the character moves between valuing the society and
         valueing the individual.

@{b}CHAOTIC@{ub}- indicates that the character values the individual above society
         and others.


@{b}ETHICS @{ub}

@{b}GOOD   @{ub}- indicates the character tries to act in a moral and upstanding
         manner

@{b}NEUTRAL@{ub}- indicates the character leans towards "situational ethics",
         evaluating each set of circumstances.

@{b}EVIL   @{ub}- indicates the character acts either with no regard for others or
         in an overly malignant manner.

The base for each ability score is a number between 3 and 18. Racial
modifiers are automatically factored into the base number by the computer
when any value is shown. The maximum value for scores is 19 unless modified
by magical means. Fighters' strength may have a precentage value added to
indicate exceptional ability. Higher values always offer greater
advantages.


@{b}STRENGTH @{ub}

Strength measures physical power, muscle, and stamina. Fighter-type
characters (fighters, rangers and paladins) can have exceptional strengths
greater than 18. Exceptional strength is indicated by a percent value
(01,02,03,....98,99,00) following the base strength (for example 18/23).
High strength allows characters to fight better. With hand weapons such as
swords or maces they hit more often and receive damage bonuses. Halflings,
even halfing-fighters, cannot have exceptional strengths.

@{b}DEXTERITY @{ub}

Dexterity measures agility, hand-eye coordination and reflex speed.
Characters with high dexterities can have bonuses to armour class, which
indicates how difficult they are to hit. Good dexterity also gives bonuses
when using missile weapons such as bows or slings. Dexterity of 16 or
highrer counters some of the minuses fighters suffer when using weapons in
both hands.

@{b}CONSTITUTION @{ub}

Constitution measures fitness, health and physical toughness. High
constitution increases the number of hit points a character receives. Hit
points measure how difficult a character is to incapacitate or kill.

@{b}INTELLIGENCE. @{ub}

Intelligence measures memory, reasoning, and learning ability. Intelligence
is the prime requisite for mages; their skill and very survival hinges on
learning and using their knowledge of magic.

@{b}WISDOM @{ub}

Wisdom measures a composite of judgement, enlightenment, will power and
intuition. Characters with wisdom of 7 or less are more susceptible to
magic spells, while those with wisdom of 15 or greater have some
resistance. Clerics with wisdom of 13 or greater receive extra spells.

@{b}CHARISMA @{ub}

Charisma measures personal magnetism, persuasiveness, and the ability to
assume command.


@{b}OTHER CHARACTERISTICS @{ub}

In addition to the race, class and ability scores, characters have several
other characteristics that may change during the game; armour class,
hitpoints, experience points, level and alignment.

@{b}ARMOUR CLASS (AC) @{ub}

Armour class measures how difficult someone is to hit and damage; the lower
the armor class value the harder they are to hit. Low armor class values
can indicate different things. A character might be difficult to hit
because he is outfitted with magical armour, while a monster might have the
same armor class because it is small and fast. Armor class changes only
when characters find and use new armor or shields. High dexterity imnproves
a characters armor class.

@{b}HIT POINTS (HP) @{ub}

Hit points measure gow difficult a character or opponent is to
incapacitate or kill; higher values are better. Every time an attack gets
past armor and defences, it does damage that is subtracted from the tragets
hit-points. If hit points reaches zero the character is unconscious. If hit
points reach -10 or less the character is dead.

@{b}EXPERIENCE POINTS (EXP) @{ub}

Experience points measure how much a character has accomplished. You earn
experience points for killing monsters, finding treasure and completing
parts of the adventure. Having prime requisite scores of 16 or more
increases experience earned by 10%. Characters increase in level when they
earn enough experience points. All characters start with some experience
points. If a character is multi-class, theMANXnitial points are distributed
evenly thoughout all of his or her classes.

@{b}LEVEL @{ub}

Level measures how much a character has advanced in his or her class.
Whenever a character has earned enough experience points to advance in
level, he gains hit-points, combat ability, and resistance to the effects
of poisons and magical attacks. Mages, clerics and high-level paladins gain
the ability to memorise a greater number of spells and cast new spell
levels. Level advancement happens automatically whenever a character has
enough experience points.

@node CREATINGSTRONGCHARACTERS "CREATING STRONG CHARACTERS"
@{b}CREATING STRONG CHARACTERS. @{ub}

There are many strategies for putting together an effective party of
characters. Certain combinations of character class and race are more
effective than others.

@{b}SINGLE-CLASS vs. MULTI-CLASS. @{ub}

Non human characters have the ability to be multi-classed characters, but
that does not mean they must be multi-classed characters. Single class
characters have a number of advantages over multi-classed characters with
the same amount of experience points.

Single-class figthers have several advantages. With the same amount of
experience points, they will average many more hit points and have a better
chance to hit than multi-class fighter combinations.

Single-class clerics and mages will gain higher level spells much sooner
than multi-class mage or cleric combinations. With the same total amount of
experience points, they will have more spells than multi-class casters.

With careful play, rear rank characters will seldomo get into melee combat.
This makes a single-class mage a viable character despite limited abilities
in melee. Also, the real time nature of the game means that a character can
only do one thing at a time; a characters ability to do many different
things is often not as important as the ability to do one thing very well.

The advantages of multi-class characters are obvious, they combine the
abilities of several different classes of character in one. Thus, a
fighter/mage/ can both melee effectively and cast spells, though he can do
neither as well as a single-class fighter or mage with the same amount of
experience points. Multi-class characters are often useful to add an
additional capability to a party, such as thieving skills or additional
clerical healing spells. Remember, multi-class characters go up levels
extremely slowly because their experience points are distributed evenly
between their classes.

@{b}RACIAL ADVANTAGES @{ub}

Because of the monsters and situations in the game, certain race/class
combinations are very effective. The following are some specific types of
characters ad their advantages.

@{b}DWARVEN FIGHTER : @{ub}

A dwarven fighter with a high constitution has a high resistance to poison,
which makes it much easier to fight giant characters. A dwarf fighter can
have a constitution of 19, which can further increase hit points. A dwarf
also allows the party to read drawven writing.

@{b}HUMAN PALADIN : @{ub}

Only humans can be paladins. Paladins can fight as well as any fighter,
plus they have the ability to heal by 'laying on hands'. They also gain the
ability to cast some low level clerical healing spells when they reach
ninth level.

@{b}ELVEN MAGE : @{ub}

A single-class mage gains levels swiftly. An elven mage with a high
dexterity has a high armor class, which makes it easier to survive stry
thrown weapons. As a mage, an elf's maximum constitution of 17 does not
limit hit points and a maximum deterity of 19 can improve armor class.
Because mages cannot wear armor to improve thier armor class, high
dexterity is essential. An elf also allows the party to read elven writing.

@{b}HUMAN or HALF-ELVEN CLERIC : @{ub}

A single-class cleric swiftly gains levels. Humans and half-elves can have
a maximum wisdom of 18 (thus gaining the maximum bonus spells) and they can
attain the maximum level allowed in this game.

@{b}HALF-ELVEN FIGHTER/MAGE/CLERIC : @{ub}

This is the character with the most diverse talents. This character can use
almost every items (excluding lock picks), has a limited ability to fight,
can cast offensive spells and can heal. Unfortunately a half-elven
fighter/mage/cleric will go up levels extremely slowly, and will have very
few hitpoints for most of the game.

@{b}ELVEN FIGHTER/MAGE/THIEF : @{ub}

The theivish counterpart to the half-elven jack of all trades listed above.
This character can use literally every item in the game and can pick lcoks
as well. Unfortunately a half-elven fighter/mage/thief will go up levels
extremely slowly, and will have very few hitpoints for most of the game.
@endnode
@node CREATINGASTRONGPARTY "CREATING A STRONG PARTY"
@{b}CREATING A STRONG PARTY. @{ub}

A party should include a good mix of classes and races handle all of the
challenges they encounter. You will need to decide upon your overall party
strategy before making characters.

In general, a party should contain at least two characters who can fight
well, a character who can cast mage spells and at least one character who
can cast clerical healing spells.

@{b}FIGHTERS @{ub}

The party has many choice for thw two front rank characters who can fight
well. Most races make reasonable fighters. Fighter, Paladin, and ranger
class characters fight better than other classes. Even single-class cleric
and dual-class fighter/cleric characters can be effective front rank
characters in the beginning levels of the game. Also, some of the NPCs that
you meet in the game can fight well and may be useful in the front rank.

@{b}SPELLCASTERS @{ub}

The choice of various spellcaster is also important to the strategy of the
party. One character who can cast mage spells is normally sufficient for
most parties. Mages must find their higher level spells on scrolls; the
supply of scrolls is limited, so it is not efficient to divide those spells
among several mages in a party.

It is often useful to have two characters who can cast clerical healing
spells. It is important not to get caught after a battle without a
conscious cleric. A consciuos cleric with a few 'cure light wounds' spells
can heal as many hit points in hours as a party without a conscious clreic
could heal in many days of rest.


@{b}PARTY MAKEUP @{ub}

One strategy is to create a party of specialists who go up in levels with
the fewest number of experience points. This party works so long as the
warriors in the front ranks never let the spellcasters in the rear rank get
into melee.

@{b}Specialist Party : @{ub}Dwarven Fighter,Human Paladin, Elven Mage and
                   Half Elven Cleric.

Another strategy is to create a party of generalists who are multi-classed
characters. This party should always have some character with the
appropriate skill for a situation. But, such a diverse party needs a much
larger number of experience points to get to higher levels.

@{b}Generalist Party : @{ub}Dwarven Fighter/Thief, Half-Elven Fighter/Cleric,
                   Elven Fighter/Mage, Half-Elven Cleric/Mage.

A further strategy is to have a mixed party with specialist warriors in the
front rank and generalist spellcasters in the rear rank. This strategy
makes sure that the fighters gain levels (and hit points) as quickly as
possible but that the spellcasters will have a wide variety of spells
available.

@{b}Mixed Party     : @{ub}Dwarven Fighter, Human Paladin, Half Elven Cleric/Mage
                    Human Cleric.
@endnode
@node ATTACKINGOPPONENTS "ATTACKING OPPONENTS"
@{b}ADVENTURING STRATEGY @{ub}

@{b}ATTACKING OPPONENTS @{ub}

Characters generally engage in "melee combat", which is face-to-face combat
with weapons such a swords and maces. Characters also have other options
such as casting spells, and ranged combat with bows and slings.

In general, a character attacks the enemy in the front rank on his side of
the screen. When there is only one enemy left in battle, it moves to the
centre of its square and character from both sides can attack it.

@{b}COMBAT MECHANICS @{ub}

Understanding combat mechanics allows the party to use the most efficient
weapons and tactics in different situations. Each characters ability in
combat is defned by his armour class, THAC0, and damage.

@{b}THAC0 @{ub}respresents a character's Ability to Hit Armour Class 0. A character
must "roll" a number equal to or greater than this number to damage a
target with an armor class of zero. The lower the attackers THAC0 the
greater his chance to hit the target.
A characters THAC0 is based on his class and level.


    @{b}NOTE : @{ub}the generation of a random number is often referred to as
           a "roll". In determining if an attack hit, the number
           generated is from 1 theough 20. The base roll is modified
           by the characters ability scores and any magic weapons.

An attack is successful if the roll is greater than or equal to the
attacker's THAC0 minus the target's AC.

    @{b}EXAMPLE: @{ub}A fighter with a THAC0 of 15 attacking amonster with an AC
             of 3 would need tol roll (THAC0 15) - (AC 3) = 12+. But to
             hit a monster with an Ac of -2 he would need to roll
             (THAC0 15) - (AC -2) = 17+

@{b}DAMAGE @{ub}is the hit point loss than an attacker inflicts against an
opponent. The amount of damage inflicted depends on the attacker's strength
and weapon type. The damage each weapon can do is summarised in the
Weapons chart n page 56.

Some monsters take only partial or no damage from certain weapon types.
Skeletons, for example, take only half damage from sharp or edged
weapons


@{b}Combat Strategies. @{ub}

To succeed in combat, deploy your party well, cast effective spells before
and during combat, maneuver your characters into advantageous positions,
and attack using the most powerful characters and weapons.

@{b}Deploying the Party. @{ub}

Keep the heavily armoured fighters in the front rank and the vulnerable
magic users and thieves in the rear ranks.

@{b}Equipping the Party. @{ub}

Equip characters in the frontrank with the most powerful melee weapons you
can find. See the Weapons Chart on pge 56 to see how much damage each
type of weapon can do.

As soon as you find enough weapons, warriors should carry a one handed
weapon in their primary hand and a short sword in their secondary hand.
Remember that if you use a two handed weapon in one hand thenthe
other hand must be free,

Equip characters in the rear ranks with the most powerful ranged weapons
you can find. Again, see the Weapons chart on page 56 to see how much
damage each type of ranged weapon can do. Specilaists should have their
holy symbols and spell books in-hand, ready to cast spells

Characters who use thrown weapons should carry weapons in both hands and
in their belt pouch for quick reloading. Front rank characters who user
thrown weapons may wish to carry a shield or short sword at the top of
their belt pouch - in the box for belt pouck #3. A shield or short sword in
that position will be readied automatically after the character attacks
with the last of his or her thrown weapons.

Be sure to recover your ranged weapons after each battle and to collect all
of the ranged weapons you can find. Ranged weapons get used up quickly in
battle.

@{b}WOUNDED CHARACTERS. @{ub}

Characters who are seriously wounded whould be moved out of the front rank
if at all possible. It is much easier to heal a wounded character than it
is to bring a dead character back to life.

@{b}MOVING AND FIGHTING @{ub}

If you are exploring an area, move with the compass on the screen to
facilitate mapping. If you are moving through an explored area move with
the spell menu on the screen and an attack spell showing. Always move with
the adventure screen up; you cant fight from the equipment of character
screens.

With both the adventure screen and the spell menu up you are prepared
for battle. Prepare for battle before you open any door, climb or
descend stairs or push a button that could open a door or secret wall.
Monsters often lurk behind closed doors or secret walls, and monsters are
always ready for combat!

Remember that you can move and fight at the same time. You can move
backwards to dodge an enemy melee attack. You can move sideways to dodge
an enemy ranged attack. You can even try to run away and close a door
behind you to get away from a particularly nasty fight. Be careful
though, some monsters can open doors to follow you.

@{b}ARMOR @{ub}

Armor provides a character a base armor class. The lower the characters
armor class the harder it is for an attack to hit. Armor class is based
on the character's armor and his dexterity bonus. Some magic items and
spells also help a characters armor class.

Note the classes sections starting on page 25 in the rules that limit some
character classes to certain types of armor. The Armor Chart lists the
types of armour and the base armor class they provide a character.


@{b}ARMOR TYPE	@{ub}     			BASE AC
--------------------------------------------------------
Robe			             10
Shield*			              9
Leather Armor                 8
Scale Mail                    6
Chain Mail                    5
Banded Armor                  4
Plate Mail                    3

* A shield subtracts 1 AC from any armor it is used with.

Boots, helmets and non-magical bracers may look like armor but they do not
modify a character's armor class. They can safely be left as weights on
pressure plates. Magical braces, however, can modify a characters' armor
class

@node STRATEGIESFORUSINGSPELLS "STRATEGIES FOR USING SPELLS"
@{b}STRATEGIES FOR USING SPELLS @{ub}

Spells are an important part of the party's capabilities. The spells that
the party's spellcasters memorise will have an important effect on the
party's tactics.

In the following section, the spells have been divided into types:
offensive, defensive, healing and other. There are specific hints on when
each type of spell is most effective.

Spells that are available only to clerics are marked with an astrerisk.

@{b}OFFENSIVE SPELLS @{ub}

@{b}Burning Hands, *Cause light wounds, Shocking grasp, *Flame blade, Vampire
Touch, *Cause Serious Wounds, * Cause critical wounds and *Harm:@{ub} These
are the hand to hand magical attacks. For all but burning hands the
spellcaster must be in the front rank to attack with them. Because of the
time it takes to cast these spells and the vulnerability of many
spellcasters, they are normally the offensive spells of last resort.

@{b}Magic Missle and Melf's Acid Arrow: @{ub}These are ranged magical attacks that
affect only one monster at a time. They allow the spellcaster to attack
from the safety of the rear ranks. They are the favourite offensive spells
of lower level mages.

@{b}Disintegrate and Flesh to Stone: @{ub}These are ranged magical attacks that can
eliminate one target with a single attack. They are the favourite of high
level mages attacking targets with many hit points.

@{b}Hold Person, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Fear, Ice Storm, Cone of Cold,
*Flame Strike and Hold Monster: @{ub}These are ranged magical attacks that can
affect several monsters in an area. Becuase of the damage they can do
they are often the preffered offensive spells of higher level spellcasters.

These are effect spells are especially effective when fighting many
monsters. Look closely at the area of effect of various spells. The spells
that affect several squares are more effective agains monsters that cannot
attack in groups. The spells that affect a single square are most effective
against monsters that attack in groups.

Be especially casreful when you use the Ice Storm and Hold Person spells.
If the target of an Ice Storm spell is within melee range of the party,
the party will also take damage from the spell. The Hold Person spell
only affects men and other humanoid creatures.


@{b}DEFENSIVE SPELLS @{ub}

@{b}Armor, Blur, *Protection from Evil, Shield, *Magical Vestement and
*Protection from Evil 10' Radius: @{ub}These spells mainly provide protection
against physical attacks. Cast these spells on your front rank characters
before dangerous battles that involve physical attacks.

@{b}*Bless and *Prayer: @{ub}These spells mainly provide protection against
magical attacks. Cast these spells on your front rank characters before
dangerous battles that involve magical attacks.

@{b}HEALING SPELLS@{ub}

@{b}*Cure Light Wounds, *Aid, *Cure Serious Wounds, *Cure Critical Wounds,
and *Heal: @{ub}These spells replace a character's lost hit points. The Aid spell
can increase a character's hit points over his normal maximum value, but it
only increases hit points temporarily. Cleric Class Characters should
always have a few Cure Light Wounds spells memorised to quickly heal the
party while resting.

@{b}*Slow Poison, *Remove Paralysis, *Neutralise Poison, Remove Curse and
Stone to Flesh: @{ub}These spells remove or slow the effects of poison,
paralysis, flesh to stone or curses. Keep a number of these spells
memorised whenever the party is anywhere near a monster who can poison,
paralyse or petrify.

@{b}*Raise Dead: @{ub}This spell will bring a non-elven character back from the dead.
Keep one of these spells memorised once your cleric gets to a high enough
level.

@{b}OTHER SPELLS @{ub}

@{b}Detect Magic : @{ub}This spell is very useful in evaluating the items the party
picks up during the game. The spell causes all magical items carried by the
party to glow.

@{b}Invisibility and Invisibility 10' Radius : @{ub}Invisibility is a useful
defence for a character in the rear ranks. Invisibilty 10' radius is
useful to hide the entire party from mystic sensors and prying eyes.

Even when the party is invisible, most monsters will sense the party's
general location, though the monsters receive big penalties on attacks
against invisible targets.

@{b}*Create food & Water : @{ub}This spell is very useful in the later levels of the
game where food is scarce. Before to memorise this spell before the party
begins starving - not after !

@{b}Haste : @{ub}This spell is especially useful when fighting monsters who are
very fast. The haste spell allows a party to make melee attacks much
faster. Cast this spell on your party just before dangerous battles.

@{b}True Seeing: @{ub}This spell is useful when you are stuck in an area with many
illusions, invisible monsters etc ....

@{b}Disintegrate: @{ub}This spell is occasionally useful to remove certain walls and
other special blocks in your path.

@node BESTIARY "MONSTERS"
@{b}MONSTERS @{ub}

This section contains descriptions of most of the monsters in and around
Temple Darkmoon. You may encounter a few others. .......


@{b}AERIAL SERVANT - @{ub}

This semi-intelligentcreature is a form of an air elemental. Aerial
servants are most often encountered on this plane of existance when they
have been conjuired up by a high level cleric to do a specific task. They
are normally invisible but when seen they resemble legless humanoids made
of sparkling blue smoke. They are very strong and can do great damage by
grabbing and strangling their targets.


@{b}ANT, GIANT (WARRIOR AND WORKER) @{ub}

These gaint insects include both worker ants and warriors ants. They are
covered with a thick outer skeleton that acts as armor. They have six
hairly legs that can propel them over ground at great speed. All giant
ants have powerful mandibles that can rend their targets. Warriors can
also attack with a poisonous sting in their tail.

often found underground. Beholders have a globular body and move with
innate levitation. Atop the beholders spherical body are 10 eye stalks,
and in the centre is a single large eye and a gaping maw adorned with
several rows of Razor sharp teeth. Each of the eye stalks has a
unique magical ability - the beholder can case a different spell
with each. Fortunately,not all of the eyes canbe brought to bear on a
given target. Beholders are covered with hard, chitinous armour, making
them relatively tough to hit in combat.


@{b}BULETTE - @{ub}

Aptly called a land shark the bulette is a huge terrifying predator that
lives only to eat. It has a temperament akin to the wolverine; stupid,
mean, and fearless. The bulette is universally shunned, even by other
monsters. There rare, carnivorous creatures are covered with bony
armoured plates which make them very tough to damage. Despite their size
and armour they are both swift and deadly. Bulettes have very powerful
claws and a maw full of rows of razor sharp teeth.


@{b}GAS SPORE - @{ub}

Gas spores are mutli-cellular spherical fungi that are often found floating
through enclosed corridors. Gas spores' frontal colouration resembles a
large central eye. They also have rhizome growths on top of there hollow
bodies that strongly resemble eye stalks. The resulting sphere closely
resembles a beholder, but has none of the Beholder's awesome powers.


@{b}GELATINOUS CUBE - @{ub}

These almost transparent cubes travel down dungeon corridors, absorbing
carrion and trash along the way. The sides of a gelatinous cube glisten,
and the creature leaves a slimy trail when it moves. Very large cubes grow
tall to graner garner mosses and the like from the ceilings.


@{b}GIANT, FROST - @{ub}

Like all evil giants, frst giants have a reputation for crudeness and
stupidity. This reputation is deserved, but frost giants are crafty
fighters. They are very strong and tough. They are protected by oversized
armour and can do tremendous damage with giant melee weapons and large
hurled rocks. Frost giants may be found alone or in small tribal groups.

red eyes. The baying of a hell hound has been described as "eerie",
"hollow" and "disturbing". The beast attacks with flaming breath and
piercing teeth.

armed with a unique, sharp-edged pole arm. The ferocious reputation of

dwellers. Mind flayers feed on the very minds of sentient beings. Mind
flayers are a slime mauve colour, stand about six feet tall and adorn
themselves with flowing robes decorated with images of suffering
death, and despair. Their faces resemble octipi with two large,
white, pupilless eyes.


@{b}SALAMANDER - @{ub}

This large, flaming creature is a native of the elemental plane of fire.
Salamanders thrive in very hot places. They are cruel, evil creatures
that are highly intelligent. They respect only power, and to them
power is either the ability to resist their fire, or the capacity to
inflict great damage. Anyone else is dealt a painful, fiery death.


@{b}SKELETON WARRIOR - @{ub}

This is a magically animated body, created and controlled by a powerful
evil wizard or priest. Skeleton bodies have been created from the bodies
of powerful warriors. Because they have no intellignece or will, skeleton
warriors are utterly fearless. They never retreat from a fight, except
when turned by a cleric or paladin.


@{b}SNAKE, FLYING - @{ub}

Also known as "flying fangs", these uncommon reptiles are so dangerous that
all intelligent races hunt them mercilessly. They fly with acrobatic
agility, and use their tails and body coils to hamper victims while they
hover in midair. Flying fangs always try to strike at the faces of their
foes. The snakes will attack any living creature they feel they can slay
and eat.


@{b}SPIDER, GIANT - @{ub}

This predator haunts many regions and helps to keep down the level of pests,
like adventurers. Giant spiders weave webs for unwary victims, and attack
with poisonous bites.


@{b}WASP, FLYING - @{ub}

This rare giant insect is feared because of its unthinking ferocity.
They can attack with powerful jaws and their tail-mounted stinger. The
buzzing wings of giant wasps gives some warning of their prescence, but
their swiftness makes it necessary to react instantly to their
prescence.


@{b}WILL 'o' WISPS - @{ub}

These malevolent entities subsist by luring unsuspectin creatures to their
deaths amids the hazards of their environment. They feed on the energies
released in their target's death stuggle. They prefer their victims to
meet lingering deaths to increase the energy given off before death.

their foes in a swooping attack.


@{b}WOLF, DIRE - @{ub}

and cunning carnivores. They can act independantly but tend to travel in
packs. Dire wolves are larger than most men and have powerful jaws and
teeth. They are swift and sure hunters.

@node HINTS "HINTS"
@{b}HINTS @{ub}

Here are some general strategy hints to help you along you journey.

@{b}CARRY ITEMS WITH YOU @{ub}- You never know when you will need something that
you have found! To carry an item with you, pick up the item and move
it into a backpack.

@{b}PREPARE YOUR PARTY @{ub}- Make sure that your party contains at least; two
characters who can fight well, one who can cast mage spells and one who
can cast clerical spells, make sure that your fighters in the front rank
have weapons in their primary hand. Once you get comfortable fighting with
the front rank characters, you can also have the rear rank characters
throw weapons and spells at the monsters. Experiment by equipping your
characters with various combinations of weapons, shields, spell books, and
holy symbols to maximise their fighting ability.

@{b}KEEP TRACK OF BUTTONS AND LEVERS @{ub}- Some puzzles are activated in one part
of the dungeon, yet they affect another part far away. Record the position
of any button or lever that has no obvious function. If you cant seem to
get through an area go back and change these buttons one at a time to see
if they make it any easier to get through.

@{b}LOOK FOR WRITING ON THE WALL @{ub}- If you cant seem to get through an area,
look for writing on the walls in the area. Often, writing in a wall is
difficult to spot. Some writing may only be read if the party included
a character of a specific race.

@{b}LOOK FOR HIDDEN BUTTONS ON THE WALLS @{ub}- Always check the walls for secret
and hidden buttons and bricks. Moving sideways down a wall will often
make hidden buttons easier to spot.

@{b}KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE COMPASS @{ub}- Watch the compass as the party moves. There
are a number of traps thst change the party's facing. Teleporters often
reveals themselves when the party's facing changes.

@{b}WATCH FOR TELEPORTS @{ub}- Do you suspect the party is being teleported while
moving through an area ? Throw an item past the suspected teleporter then
watch the item. The item will "dissappear" if it teleports.


@{b}SAVE THE GAME @{ub}

Save the game anytime you think that something could happen that would hurt
the party. Save the game at the beginning of each level. If a puzzle is
difficult to solve, save the game and then try different solutions. If the
monsters are attacking the party thick and fast, save the game and try
different strategies. If things are really getting touch, save the game
before opening doors.

@{b}GO ON @{ub}- When all else fails, go on with the game. The party does not have
to open every door, fight every monster and obtain every item to win the
game. Mark down any area that the party bypasses. If the party gets
stumped in a later area, or needs an item to go on, come backand try
the puzzle again.
