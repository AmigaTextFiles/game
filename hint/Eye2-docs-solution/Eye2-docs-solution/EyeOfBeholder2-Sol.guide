EYE OF THE BEHOLDER 2 (EOB 2) is similar to the prequel in the graphics and
sounds departments. Anyone who has played the first game should feel right at
home here within the first few minutes of game play. But don't get too
comfortable! Although the individual levels in this dungeon are generally
smaller and less complicated than those in the first game, this is no
cakewalk.

Survival is the biggest challenge in the game. You may generate new characters
for this game who will start at about level 7, or you may elect to transfer
your more powerful party from the first game. Don't expect to see a lot of
character advancements. New characters will probably advance to level 10 or 11
by the end of the game. This was no doubt planned in the design phase in
anticipation of a third game in the series.

Combat is very tightly balanced. Some monsters overwhelm your party with sheer
numbers while others can cast magic spells that can destroy most of your party
in the first round. You will need to devise special strategies against
different enemies, even spells and items to be used against them should be
planned out ahead of time to insure success.

Unlike the first game in which there was a specific number of monsters on each
level and they did not randomly regenerate, most monsters do regenerate in
this sequel so that you can never _clean out_ a level and expect to explore in
peace.

One very useful tactic in fighting really deadly monsters is the
melee-sidestep tactic. Here's a brief description for those not familiar with
it: when your party encounters a specially powerful monster, back up
immediately after each blow to keep out of melee range. Check your map and
look for any nearby area that is at least 2X2 in size. Continue to attack and
then back up and lure the monster into the area you have chosen.

Once you reach this area, attack the monster and then immediately step to one
side. If the monster also sidesteps to face you again, hit it once and them
immediately sidestep again. Do not try to strike more than one blow as that
might give it enough time to make an attack. The idea is to keep attacking and
staying out of its range. It's tedious, but very effective against monsters
that can do serious damage with just one blow. Timing is often critical when
you use this tactic. You might wish to use a combination of the mouse and the
keyboard or even the keyboard alone. Practice makes perfect!

You should definitely include a mage and a cleric in your party, together with
a couple of fighters. Certain rooms can only be entered if you have a thief in
your party. The thief however, serves no other purpose and I do not recommend
including one in your starting party. You can recruit someone later in the
game. I should also point out that the cleric profession in EOB 2 comes with
the CREATE FOOD spell, which is essential to completing the game, since it did
not appear that there were enough rations to be found in the game. Also,
remember to use the Scribe Scroll to Spell book option each time you pick up a
mage scroll.

The dungeon levels are quite small, but the stairs gave me a lot of problems
as they did not necessarily lead to a different level. I followed this rule of
thumb when drawing the maps: whenever I took a set of stairs, if the game
stopped to load more data from the disk, then I assumed the stairs led to a
new level. I also marked each matching pair of upstairs and downstairs with
the same letter in the hope that this would make it a bit easier for you to
follow the trail.

And now, let the game begin!

This is an easy area. The only enemies you face here are the dire wolves.
They are not that ferocious and shouldn't give your party too much trouble
at all.

Pick up the rocks at (1) and (2). At (3) you will meet a woman who wish to
lead you to the Temple of Dark Moon. If you accept, the game will whisk you
directly in front of the temple. Since you are quite done with the forest area
yet, you should decline. As an alternative, you can also kill her at this
time. If you do, you will get to read a parchment that hints at something
rotten going on inside the temple. If you decide to just decline her offer,
she will pop up somewhere else in the forest.

Take the stairs A to the hidden area of the forest. Here you will find the
mage scroll of BLUR (4), some rotten food (5) and leather armor (6). Return to
the forest and pick up the rusty dagger at (7) and the rocks at (8) and (9).
The two arrows at (10) should come in handy later. (11) is a grave. There are
five of them. You have the option to dig up the graves but don't do it.
There's nothing valuable to be found and you will find your characters cursed
for their trouble.

That's all there is to discover in the forest. When you are all set, go to
location B where you will enter the Temple of Darkmoon.

From the stairs K, go west and take the stairs J. When you arrive at the other
end, you will see a few weapons lying on the ground at (8). _All_ these weapons
are cursed! They are: -2 dagger "Vargon", -3 long sword, -2 mace "thumper".

At (9) you will find another keyhole where your last Dark Moon key will fit.
This opens up the southern passage which will lead you to Stairs H that return
to Underground Level 1. Watch out for spiders.

Shortly after arriving at this level, you will confront an angry priest. Your
choices are limited. Attack him.

The reason why we are on this level at this time is that we need Insal's
lockpicking skill to open three doors on this level that would otherwise
remain close for the entire game. This being a walkthru, I need to provide you
with a solution that will let you see as much of the game as possible.

As I have said before, Insal will leave as soon as the party tries to rest. So
what we need to do here is to survive without resting until Insal can get the
three doors opened. Your opponents on this level are clerics. To a party with
low level characters, they can be rather tough. Be sure to save the game after
each successful battle.

Use the copper key in the keyhole at (2) to open the door to the east. Pick
the lock at (3) to open the north door. Pick up the mage scroll of
invisibility at (4).

Push the button on the door at (5) to open it. There are a lock pick and a
spell book at (6). At (7) push the button on the east door to open it. Click
on the bed at (8) and you will find another copper key.

Use the copper key at the keyhole at (7) to open the south door. There are 4
clerics that you must defeat at the other side of this door and you will get
another copper key once you beat them. You can open the door at (9) by pushing
the button on the door, but there is nothing behind it. Do not waste time at
the next door to the south that is guarded by a magic mouth. It will be quite
a while later before you can get through that.

Use Insal's lockpicking skill at (10) to open the door to the north. Pick up 2
magic dusts at (11). Next pick the lock at (12) to open the door to the south.
You should find a magic dust, a complete set of elf bones and a parchment at
(13). Reading the parchment will reveal that the elf bones belong to Amber,
the scout sent by Khelben.

When you step on (14), the door to the south will open and you will be
attacked by another group of clerics. Pick the lock at (15) to open the west
door. (16) is a stone portal. Players of EYE 1 will recognize it immediately.
The portal can only be activated by stone artifacts that you will find later
in the game. There is a very handy mage scroll of Improved Identify as well as
another copper key at (17). At (18) there is a button for opening/closing the
door.

At this point, Insal has served his purpose. Drop him from the party by
CAMPING and then selecting the proper option from the menu. (If you let him
leave by himself while you rest, he will steal things from your inventory!)
Take a well deserved rest here to recover hit points and spells.

Use a copper key in the keyhole at (19) to open the north door. Push the
button on the door at (20) to open it. Inside the room is a cleric scroll of
Create Food at (21). At (22) you have the opportunity to eavesdrop on a
conversation, after which you will fight a couple more clerics. The button on
the door at (23) opens it but there is nothing of interest inside.

Retrace your steps to (24). There is a statue here. Swing your weapons to
destroy the statue. You will find a button on the wall after hacking the
statue to pieces. Push the button to open up the passage south. At the end of
the passage, you are surrounded by three teleportation fields. The ones to the
south and east simply move you to just outside the door of the stone portal
room. But the one to the west will teleport you to the Soft Floor Room
(SOFTFLOR.IFF).

@{" SOFT FLOOR - OS 3.0-" system "sys:utilities/multiview Maps/Eye2.softfloor.Iff"}

@{" SOFT FLOOR - OS 3.0+" LINK "Maps/Eye2.softfloor.Iff/MAIN"}

You arrive at (1) in this room. There is a blue gem here. Elsewhere in this 3X3
room, you should find a copper key, a green gem and a red gem at (2), (3) and
(4). In the center of the room is a soft spot, but you won't be able to do much
there at the moment.

Each of the 4 secret passages shown on the map can only be opened if you place
all three gems (blue, green and red) in the same alcove. The gems will be gone
forever as soon as the wall disappears to reveal the passage. This means that
you can only access one out of the four hidden areas. Here's a description of
what you will find in each area to help you decide which passage you wish to
access.

The eastern passage leads to some very nice items: you will find a cleric
scroll of Raise Dead, a +2 2-handed sword, a +3 platemail, a ring of
adornment, a skull, a femur, a parchment from Lord James of Natingdale and a
tropelet seed at (5). Unfortunately, the plaque at (6) happens to be true.
This is a trap with no way out. You will be stuck here if you choose the
eastern passage.

The northern passage leads to a door. When you step on (7), two darts will be
fired at you from the south. They will miss if you are prepared and move away
quickly enough. There is a warning plaque at (8) and you will be attacked by
clerics there. A tropelet seed is all you get for your trouble.

The western passage leads to a 2-handed sword, 4 iron rations and a tropelet
seed at (9). There are 4 more iron rations at (10).

Personally, I think the southern passage is the most rewarding. At (11) is a
plaque that reads "Emergency supplies". You will find a wand of magic
missiles, a mage scroll of lightning bolt and a tropelet seed at (12). At (13)
there are 2 potions of extra healing, a potion of vitality and a potion of
healing.

When you are ready to leave the Soft Floor Room, stand one square away from
the center of the room. Then drop the tropelet seed on the soft spot (14)
(select the seed then click it on the round spot). A teleportation field will
appear. This will bring you back to the exact same place you were before on
the Cleric Barracks level.

You have explored all you can on the Barracks level. Take the set of stairs
labelled D to return to the temple ground level. (GROUND0.IFF). Use the
teleporter T to go to the resurrection chamber. At (7), click on the holy
symbol on the wall. You will now be offered an option to resurrect Amber, who
turns out to be a female thief/mage. It's up to you whether you want her in
your party. Return to (6) by walking backward into either teleport T1.

We are now ready to resume our exploration of the underground. Take the stairs
labelled C down to Underground Level 1 (GROUND1.IFF). Use the map to get to
the stairs labelled F. When you emerge from the stairs F, location (32), check
for a secret button on the east wall. This opens a hidden niche which contains
a sling and a cleric scroll of Raise Dead. Follow the corridor and take the
stairs labelled I down to Underground Level 3 (GROUND3.IFF).

From the stairs labelled P, go south to location (3). Push the button on the
south door to open it. The pressure plate at (19) opens the south door. There
are a skull and a +1 staff at (20). You should save the game at this point.

As soon as you try to pick up any of the items at (21), the two secret eastern
passages will open while at the same time, the door will close. And you will
be surround by about half a dozen margoyles. The fight is tough but certainly
not impossible, even for a low level party. The items at (21) are a cursed
sword "Hath Kull", a +5 bracer of Protection and a +1 shield. There is a
button on the east wall at (22) which opens the door again.

The spider keyhole at (23) opens the door leading to the stone portal room.
The doors at (24) and (25) are opened by pushing the buttons on the doors.
There is nothing behind either door. When you step on (26) the first time, the
door will close on you. But it can be reopened by pushing the button on the
door.

There is a button on the north wall at (27) that turns off all 4 spinners that
are shown on the map. It doesn't seem to serve any other purpose. The doors at
(28) through (32) can all be opened by pushing the door buttons. There is a
secret button at (33) that opens up the passage east. Another button at (34)
opens up the northern passage. You will fight a margoyle here (35) that will
get you a grey key.

Use the two Dark Moon keys in the keyholes at (36) and (37). A spider key will
work with the lock at (38) and open up the door to the north. Be sure to check
out the alcove to the east at (39) and pick up the South Wind horn and another
Dark Moon key. Take the stairs M. At (40), use the grey key in the keyhole to
reveal a hidden alcove. You will find a mage scroll of Fireball, a mage scroll
of Shocking Grasp, a mage scroll of Detect Magic and a cleric scroll of Raise
Dead. Take the stairs L to Underground Level 3.

Level 5 is the lowest underground level. This is a rather small level and the
only out is through the set of stairs labelled P. Resting is also not allowed on
this level. Huge ants are the enemies on this level, but they are far weaker
than the margoyles.

There are no puzzles or secrets to fathom on this level. I'll just highlight
the locations of the various loots and items. At (1) there are a silver key, a
rock, 2 femurs and 2 skulls. At (2) there are a +2 "Sa Shull" dagger, a femur,
a skull and 2 rocks. At (3) there are 2 femurs.

Be sure to pick up the west wind horn at (4). Here you'll also find leather
boots, +1 long sword, helmet, platemail and potion of Cure Poison. There are
many items lying on the floor at locations (5) through (9). You'll find a
skull, a helmet, a long sword, chain mail, a dagger, a Dark Moon key, 2
femurs, a shield, leather boots, 2 more daggers and 3 darts.

Once you have gathered as much as you want, return to Underground Level 4

As soon as you come out of Stairs E, you will be greeted with a vision that
informs you about the Test of Faith. To the east is an area covered with
circular plates. Some plates are lit with a steady blue light. The light moves
over the rest of the plates following specific patterns. Anytime you are on a
plate that's lit, you lose a big chunk of your hit points. A low level character
will only be able to withstand two to three zaps.

The optimum path to take to go through this area was outlined on the map.
Stand just to the west of the first tile. Be sure everyone is well rested.
Open your mage spell book to your favorite offensive spell. (You will have a
very tough fight at the other end.) Also be sure to have a cleric spells of
Remove Paralysis ready. Needless to say, you should also have a saved game at
this point just in case.

Wait till the light hits the tile just to the east. As soon as the light moves
away, start your jog to the east. Make your moves in sync with the movement of
the light beam. Whenever you have to change direction, turn and face the new
direction instead of sidestepping. More than likely, you will get zapped once
before you reach the final tile. The tile marked with a dot enclosed in a
rectangle opens the passages to the east.

More than likely, your way east will be blocked by a Mantis Warrior as you
reach the last plate. Very quickly cast your offensive mage spell and use your
front 2 fighters to overwhelm the mantis. As soon as it is destroyed, step
forward to move away from the plate. Your trouble is not yet over. You must
defeat the 3 or 4 Mantis Warriors waiting for you. Most mage spells such as
Fireballs, Lightning, Magic Missiles etc. work well against them. When you
defeat them, you will find a bone key and a dagger for your effort.

Use the bone key in the keyhole at (3) to open the north door. The door at (4)
is opened by pushing the button on the door. There is an egg at (5). A Mantis
Warrior emerges from the egg if you swing your weapon at it. At (6) is a
lever. Push it to turn off the moving light beam. This will make your return
trip much easier.

Push the button on the door at (7) to open it. The plaques at (8) and (10)
both contain cryptic messages subject to various interpretations. Put
something worthless (a rock or a skull) in the triangular alcove at (9) and it
will turn into a wand of lightning. This only works once.

At the very south end of the eastern hallway (11) is a -2 cursed long sword
"Hunger". Take it and put it in inventory. Be careful not to equip any
character with this sword.

Follow the same path to return to the area near the stairs. As a point of
interest: at location (12) is a -2 cursed axe. There is no reason to get that
and the tile it is on is still illuminated by the lethal light anyway.

At (13) push the button on the north door to open it. You'll find a wounded
Mantis at (14). You have the option of healing or attacking it. If you heal
it, it will wind up attacking you. Either way, the result is the same. You
must kill it and receive a mantis key in return. Again at (13) push the button
on the east door to open it. You will find a prisoner there who will ask to
join your party. This is Tanglor, a level 7 half-elven fighter/cleric. Decide
for yourself if you want him in your party. Incidentally, this is the last
character you will find in this game that can join your party. At (16) is a +1
short sword and a +1 shield.

At (17) both the north and west doors can be opened by pushing the buttons on
them. There is a +1 polearm at (18).

At (19) there is yet another lit plate. There is no avoiding this one. Walk
across it and take the damage. At (20) you will be ambushed by a mantis
warrior. It helps when you know it's coming. The south door at (21) can be
forced open. Inside you will find a magic mouth at (22). The hint it has is
plain enough. Feed it three femurs and it will give you a bone key.

Push the button on the west door at (21) to open it. Use the mantis key in the
keyhole at (23) to open the door. At (24) you will be told that some mantis
warriors just threw a glass sphere at you. As soon as the scene changes,
sidestep to the left. You should be able to easily avoid getting hit by the
glass sphere (fireball).

At (25) you will see a pit two tiles away at (27). You should also notice that
there is a button on the south wall behind the pit. Throw a rock at the south
wall. It will hit the button and the south wall as well as the pit at (27)
will both disappear. However, a new pit now appears at (26). Push the button
on the east wall at (25) to fill in this new pit. It is now safe to go south
all the way to the end of the corridor. You will find a mantis key and the
rock that you threw at (28).

Push the button on the door at (29) to open it. There are a mage scroll of
Dispel Magic and a mage scroll of Blur at (30). Push the button on the door at
(31) to open it. There is an iron ration at (32).

Use the mantis key in the keyhole at (33) to open the door to the south. This
is a room full of mantis eggs. You have to swing your weapon at the eggs one
at a time and defeat each mantis warriors that emerge from each egg. If you
don't do this, you will be ambushed by several warriors when you get to the
south end of the room.

Take the green gem from the carving at (34) and then put the gem back in the
carving again. This opens up the secret passage south. At (35) pick up a
Mantis idol, a glass sphere and a copper key.

Retrace your steps to (36). Use the copper key in the keyhole to open the west
door. Take the stairs A to 4-Wind Tower Level 2.

This level is inhabited by wasps, lots and lots of wasps. They are not very
strong, but they are fast. And their sting can be poisonous and may cause
paralysis as well. After climbing the stairs A, the best way to travel is to go
all the way to the west and then turn south, hugging the west walls whenever
possible until you reach location (1). Here you will find a Cure Poison potion,
a femur and a copper key. If you turn north at this location, you will see a lot
of wasps hovering 2 to 3 squares away. At your leisure, cast long range mage
spells such as fireballs, lightning bolts and cones of cold. The wasps are very
susceptible to these spells and you should have no trouble killing them all.

Return to (2) and use a bone key in the keyhole to open the south door. At (3)
is a pressure plate the function of which will not be immediately obvious. In
the next room there are 4 levers (5), (6), (7), (8). These 4 levers open the
next 4 gates shown on the map. Each lever also opens a pit at the location of
one of the other 3 levers. The pressure plate at (3) that you saw earlier
reset all 4 levers.

Push the levers in the following sequence: start with (5) which also opens a
pit at (8); next push (6) which also opens a pit at (5); then push (7) which
also opens a pit at (6). At this point, trying to push the lever at (8) will
result in your entire party falling through the pit.

You will have noticed, however, that the first 3 gates through the southern
hallway are now open. Moving through this hallway, your party will tell you
about a loose brick at (9). Examine the lower portion of the west wall panel
at (9) and you will notice that the middle brick is sticking out farther than
the rest. Push this brick back in.

Now return to the four lever room. Boldly and confidently step up to (8) to
push the final lever. Surprise. You didn't fall through the pits this time.
You have just passed the Test of Faith. Pushing the lever at (8) opens up the
last gate. You can now travel through the hallway without restriction. There
is nothing of interest in this area.

Use a copper key at (10) to open the east door. At (11) you will see another
vision. I hope you have better luck in interpreting the meaning of his
message. I didn't understand him at all. Both doors behind the vision can be
easily opened by pushing buttons on the door. Teleporter 2 returns you to the
stairs, after doing some major damage to some of your characters.

Teleporter 1 takes you to a short hallway where you will find stairs labelled
B going up to 4-wind Tower Level 3.

After coming up Stairs B from level 2, follow the hallway to Stairs C. Take
Stairs C to the main level. Turn left from the stairs to (1). The plaque here
advises using corridor II as the way through. (2) has a plaque that says "I",
(3) has a plaque that says "III" and (4) has a plaque that says "II". If you do
not listen to the advice and push the buttons to open doors (I) and (III), you
will find a Gas Spore (they resemble the beholders but are much weaker, just
remember to use long range spells and weapons. Avoid melee whenever possible.)
behind (I) and get hit by a fireball at (5).

Push the button on the door at (4) to open it. At (6) there is a magic mouth
that tells you about other magic mouths. Be sure to sidestep to the right or
left as soon as it finishes talking. It has a tendency to spit out fireballs
at you. Push the button on the door at (7) to open the west door. You'll find
some flying snakes to fight at (8) and get a Dark Moon key when you win.

You will see a vision at (9) that tells you to choose a door. The door to the
west is the right one. After pushing the button on the door to open it, you
will find a bone key at (10). On the other hand, if you choose the east door,
you get admonished that you made a wrong choice, but you also get a bone key
and get teleported to (19). Thus the choice really has no effect in the game.
Note that after a choice has been made, the other room disappears.

Push the button on the door at (11) to open it. The triangular alcove at (12)
contains 5 potions of Cure Poison and a cleric scroll of Raise Dead. There is
a secret button on the east wall at (13) which opens the passage to the east.
At (14) you will find a +2 banded armor, a +3 short sword, leather boots and a
-2 cursed polearm "Leech".

On the way back, note that the door at (15) has no keyhole or button. The door
is closed at the moment. The south door at (16) can be forced open. You will
find a couple packages of rotten ration at (17). If you don't have any in your
inventory, pick one up. At (18) is another magic mouth, as well as a skull and
a femur. This mouth does not have any important information to impart.

Use the bone key in the keyhole at (19) to open the north door. You'll find a
few more Gas Spores in this area. Push the button on the door at (20) to open
it. At (21) you will find someone who failed at the Test of the Cloth
(strangely enough, your party doesn't appear to have to pass that test.) Leave
him alone and do not attack him. If you try to attack him, the door will close
and I never found a way out of there.

Go through the illusion wall to (22) where you will find a plaque that talks
about greed. At (23) is a triangular alcove. Any item that you put here will
be turned into a rock. Check and see if you have 5 rocks in your inventory. If
not, put some worthless items in the alcove until you are carrying 5 rocks.
They will come in handy very shortly.

At (24) you will find some flying snakes to fight and a ring of adornment when
you win. Use the Dark Moon key in the keyhole at (25) to open the north door.
At (26) you will find a potion of extra healing, a composite bow, 5 arrows and
a parchment showing a bunch of illusion walls on a level that you have not
seen yet. Since you are using the maps and this walkthru, you don't really
need the parchment, but carry it around for the time being anyway.

Go to location (27) and check out the north wall carefully. The middle brick
at the bottom of the north wall panel is loose. Pull it out. This deactivates
the teleport T1 4 spaces west. If you do not deactivate this teleport, it will
keep moving you back (invisibly) to (27), the net effect is that the corridor
would appear endless. Beware of the spinner shown on the map when you are on
your way to location (28). Push the button on the door at (28) to open it.
There is a potion of vitality in the alcove at (29).

At (30) push the button on the door to open it. You will find a few flying
snakes to fight behind that door. Don't forget to pick up the Dark Moon key at
(31) after you beat up on the snakes. Push the button on the door at (32) to
open it. Pick up the mage scroll of Disintegrate at (33).

Use the Dark Moon key in the keyhole at (34) to open the west door. At (35)
feed a rotten ration to the mouth. At (36) put 5 rocks in the mouth. Give the
mantis idol to the mouth at (37). You don't have what the mouth at (38) wants
yet, so we will skip that for the moment.

At (39) there is a closed mouth. The purpose of this mouth will become obvious
only if you need to make a return trip to this level for some reason. Give the
cursed sword "Hunger" to the mouth at (40). The mouth at (41) takes a potion
while the one at (42) will take either a scroll or a parchment. (The map you
picked up earlier would be a good choice.)

Use the map and retrace your step all the way west to location (15). This is
the door that you noticed earlier without a keyhole or a button. When you get
there this time, you will notice that the door is open. Feeding the mantis
idol to the mouth at (37) opened it. Behind the door you will find a red gem
at (43).

Return to the corridor of mouths and feed the red gem to the mouth at (38).
Once that's done the door at the west end of the corridor will open. But
before entering the door, stop by location (44). Swing your weapon at the west
wall. This opens up the secret passage on both side. You will find another
mage scroll of Disintegrate at (45).

Enter the door at the west end of the corridor of the mouths. You will meet
DRAN for the first time at (46). The door closes on you. The only way you can
go is to take the stairs labelled D up to the next level, 4-wind Tower Level
4.

After climbing the stairs labelled D, following the short hallway to stairs E.
At (1) is a plaque that tells you about gathering 4 keys for the upcoming door.
Continue to the east you will find teleport T. This teleport connects with 5
other teleports, 4 that lead to a Dark Moon key each, and 1 that leads to a door
with 4 keyholes. Each time you step into any one of these 6 teleports, you will
be randomly teleported to any one of the 6 destinations. You must use the
teleports until you have gathered all 4 Dark Moon keys from Locations (2), (3),
(4) and (5).

After you have gathered 4 Dark Moon keys, enter the teleports until you wind
up in the room with the 4 keyholes. You are now on the main level of level 4.
Use all 4 keys in the keyholes at (6), (7), (8) and (9). This opens the door
to the east. You should save the game at this point.

A word of warning is in order here. This level contains the toughest enemies
you have yet to meet in the game. The Will O' Wisps have lots of hit points,
are very hard to hit and their blows pack a wallop when they connect. The
beholders are even tougher. Their Death and Disintegrate spells can wipe out
your entire party in just a couple of rounds. Fortunately, they do not
regenerate. Be sure to save your game each time you win a battle.

Never go toe to toe with the beholders. Even when you don't have room to
sidestep, back up after swinging your weapon(s). Keep some distance from the
beholder so that you have time to out run its spells. Continue to back up
until you reach a corner, then turn and wait in ambush. Repeat this tactic as
often as possible. I did not find any spells especially useful on the
beholders. The old standbys such as Fireball, Magic Missile, Cone of Cold, etc
did not faze them at all. Neither did the cleric spell of Slay Living. You are
probably better off casting the mage spell of Haste and then just hacking and
slashing your way through.

At (10) the north door can be opened by pushing the button on it. You will
find the first beholder just behind the door at (11). Use the tactic I
outlined above, but lure it towards the west. If you get stuck, you can step
into the teleport and get some temporary relief. Just be prepared when you
return. The beholder will be waiting for you. Defeating this beholder will
yield a femur, but you don't need any more of that. Leave it there if your
inventory is getting full. At (12) is another femur.

When you step on (13), the door to the south will open automatically, and you
will have to fight another beholder. Again, lure it towards the west. After
defeating this beholder, check out the south wall panel at (14). The middle
brick can be moved. Doing so will open up the southern passage. There are 3
potions of healing at (15). Go through the illusion wall and find a regular
dagger and a femur at (16).

There is one more beholder hiding at (17). You don't _have to_ fight this one,
but that's the reason why you didn't want to lure the first two in this
direction. You would wind up having 2 beholders to contend with at the same
time.

A plaque at (18) indicates that this is a safe place to rest to recover hit
points and spells. Beware of locations (19) and (20). There are pressure
plates at these locations that trigger fireballs. You will find a Will O' Wisp
near this area which will try to lure you to step on the plates. Just avoid
it.

Check out the west wall at (21). There is a button at the bottom corner of the
right edge of the wall panel. Push it to reveal the western passage. At (22)
is another plaque indicating that this is another safe alcove. Use the map to
navigate through all the illusion walls until you arrive at location (23).
Here you encounter a beholder stuck in a hole in the ceiling. It does not
matter what option you choose here. The result is the same. Save the game here
first.

Push the button on the south wall to get lifted to the beholder sublevel. You
will find the previously stuck beholder waiting for you at (25).
Fight-and-sidestep should easily take care of it. (Don't worry about stepping
over the pit. This is one pit you won't fall into.) At (26) there are a +2
halberd, a +3 shield and a +2 green crystal hammer. At (27) you will find a
potion of healing, leather boots, 2 daggers and a staff. At (28) there are a
-2 cursed bracer of protection and 2 femurs.

The green crystal hammer is the only item you must get on this sublevel. You
may descend to the main level at this point. But if you wish to explore the
rest of the level for more battles and more experience points, push the button
on the east door at (29) to open it. You'll find 2 more beholders wandering
around behind the door. At (30) there are 1 iron ration, 1 rotten food and 1
femur; at (31) a mace and a mage scroll of Fireball; a +4 dragon armor and a
+2 short sword at (32). When you step on (33), you will be turned to the north
where there is one last beholder waiting for you. Sidestep to the left quickly
and then deal with it using the familiar tactic of retreat and ambush. There
are a skull, a femur and a wand of Dispel Magic at (34).

Return to the beholder main level by pushing the button at (35). This will
take you back to location (24). Retrace your steps through the illusion walls.
At (36) you will received another vision of Khelben. At (37) there is a plaque
informing you about the Test of Vision.

A word about the rest of this level that you are about the explore: There are
4 pressure plates in this region. Stepping on these plates causes the dungeon
layout to shift and change. As far as I can determine, stepping on these
plates do not open up new areas or allow new items to be discovered. They
merely serve to slightly alter the geography, enough to cause great confusion
during navigation. The map 4WIND4.IFF is correct provided that you do not step
on any of these plates, which are marked on the map to alert you.

Also pay special attention to the three hidden teleports T1 through T3 and the
spinner. The teleports will move you to the new locations without you
noticing, while the spinner will quietly turn you in the opposite direction.
As it turns out, the area west of location (37) does not contain anything of
interest, although there are a few Will O' Wisps that would add to the
experience points.

At location (38) you should find a chain mail, a ring of sustenance and a
ration. Look for a button at the lower right corner of the east wall panel at
(39). Push it to open the passage east. Someone discovers that you are not of
the temple at (40) and you will see two beholders in the room just to the
east. Save your game here.

Here you have no choice but to face 2 beholders at the same time. As soon as
you take one step east from (40), the 2 beholders will come after you. At the
same time, the secret passage that you opened moments ago will be closed
_permanently_. If you plan to fight them both, you should at least cast the
Cleric spells of Bless and Prayer as well as the mage spell of Haste ahead of
time. The key is to kill the first beholder very quickly. If you succeed in
doing that without taking a lot of damage to your party, be sure to save the
game. You should have little problem finishing off the second beholder using
the retreat and ambush tactics.

On the other hand, it is possible to run away from both beholders without a
fight. Take a step east from (40) and then immediately retreat. Lure the
beholders down either the north or south hallway west of location (40). Do not
move too far ahead of the beholders. (If you do, the second beholder will take
the other hallway and try to sneak up on you from behind!) Once you lead them
to the middle of one of the hallways, turn around and move as quickly as you
can through the other hallway, go east past (40) and wind up at (41). Here you
will find a pedestal with a hand carving on it. Choose the option of putting
your hand on the carving.

What luck! Not only did you escape from the 4-wind Tower Level 4, (you are now
back on the Temple of Darkmoon Ground Level GROUND0.IFF, just east of location
(3)), but you have also obtained a Mark of the Moon on your hand.

After returning via Stairs F, be careful to avoid falling into the fast moving
pit just to the east. Also, be sure to move quickly forward and then to the
right after stepping on the pressure plate at (33).

When you stand on the pressure plate at (34), you will notice that the hallway
extends one more step further to the west. Drop an object here to keep the
plate weighed down. When you stand on the plate at (35), the wall on the south
side at the end of the hallway disappears. Drop another object to weigh down
this plate. After fighting some clerics, take the stairs labelled G up to the

The plaque at (1) near Stairs B provides the clue as to how to open up the rest
of the level. Stand in front of either one of the carvings at (2) and cast the
cleric spell of Dispel Magic at the carving. The wall in the middle disappears.
Cast the spell again at the carving and the northern passage opens. Cast the
spell a third time to reveal the western passage slightly to the north. The door
at (3) can be opened by pushing the button on the door.

The character Alain at (4) has a short but interesting story to tell. More
importantly, he awards enough experience points to raise the character of your
choice by 1 level. To get his award, allow the character that you choose to be
touched by Alain when the option appears.

Note that this is a one time only event. In order to achieve maximum benefit,
you should take a look at the statistics of the character you want to advance.
If the character is only lacking a small amount of experience points to
advance to the next level, you should hold off visiting Alain until your
character has advanced. Returning to Alain then would then gain your character
an extra level instantly.

Push the button on the door at (5) to open it. Go east and watch out for the 2
clusters of moving pits. It is not difficult to get past them. Grab the soul
gem at (6). Retrace your steps past the pits and open the door at (7) by
pushing the button on it. The plaque at (8) is pretty clear about what needs
to be done here. Put the soul gem in the ornament at (9).

Go through the illusion wall a little bit to the west and pick up the body gem
at (10). Enter the teleporter T3 which allows you to pick up the heart gem at
(12). Enter the teleporter T2 and then return to (9) and place the body and
heart gems in the ornament. This opens the door at (13).

At (14) you will find a row of 6 pits blocking your way west. Push the button
on the wall at (14) and wait there. Soon the pit P1 will be filled. Move
across it quickly. You will be greeted by a bulette here, which should not be
difficult to defeat.

The pressure plate at (15) is responsible for filling the pit P1 when it is
weighed down. Put a rock or a bone on the plate to keep P1 filled. What
happened was that a bulette was generated when you pushed the button at (14).
When it randomly stepped on the plate at (15), the pit P1 was filled in
allowing you to cross safely.

Push the button on the door at (16) to open it. The corridor leads to 2
separate hallways going south. You will notice that there are pressure plates
along both hallways. These plates trigger fireballs which can be avoided but
only if you take the proper route.

Take the western hallway. Stand on the tile just north of the first pressure
plate. Turn around so that you are facing north. Move backwards 6 spaces. (A
fireball will fire at you when you take the first step. You will see it coming
from the north. As long as you stay in front of it, it cannot hit you.) Then,
immediately and without turning, move to the east (right) 2 spaces and then
north (forward) 1 space. Wait here a few seconds to make sure that all the
fireballs you triggered have disappeared.

Move south (backwards) 1 space, west (left) 2 spaces and then north (forward)
2 spaces. You are now at location (17) on the map. There is a lever here on
the west wall. Push this lever. You should rest and save the game here.

Push the lever at (18). This combination of levers opens the door to the
south. Quickly go south and enter the door. You will find a bulette in this
room. There is also a pressure plate here as shown on the map. The bulette may
randomly step on this plate. If you it gets to the plate before you, you will
get hit by a fireball triggered from the south. This one is unavoidable, but
it is subject to the random movement of the bulette. Defeat the bulette and
pick up a shell key and a mage scroll of Improved Invisibility.

Return to (19) and face east. The pressure plate in front of you triggers a
fireball from the east as well as opens a bit just south of (19). Avoiding the
fireball is relatively easy. Go east (forward) 2 spaces and north (left) 1
space. Wait a second or two and then go to location (22). Pick up the very
important crimson key just lying on the ground.

There are many more pressure plates at the north eastern part of this maze.
But all of them are either duds or they trigger fireballs that go off in other
directions rather than aimed right at you. It is actually rather safe, except
for a bulette or two to explore this portion of the maze. Be sure to pick up
the polished shield at (23).

Use the shell key in the keyhole at (24) to open the door. Click on the mouth
at (25) to learn of its challenge. Rest here to recover all hit points and
spells. Check everyone's inventory carefully and drop any extra spellbooks and
cleric holy symbols at location (26). Cast the cleric spells of Create Food,
Bless and Prayer and the mage spell of Haste if you have them. You should save
the game here.

Right click the mage's spellbook and select the level of spells you may want
to use during the challenge. I found the level 5 Cone Of Cold spell very
effective. Once you have the spellbook menu at the right page, drop the book
as well as any equipped holy symbol at location (26). (Notice that the spell
menu stays on the screen even without the spellbook! It will disappear as soon
as you CAMP, however.)

Enter the teleporter T5. As soon as you are teleported, you will face a group
of 3 or 4 bulettes at(27). You need to kill the first two as quickly as
possible with magic to avoid getting surrounded on two sides. This is where
the Cone Of Cold really comes in handy. Use the fight-sidestep tactic to deal
with the last one to avoid taking any unnecessary damage.

Go through the illusion wall to the north, read the plaque at (28) and enter
the teleporter T6. Read the plaque at (29). The transparent wall blocking your
way to the west can be destroyed by repeat hacking and slashing. The catch is
that each time you hit the wall, your entire party will also take damage. Rest
as often and as long as needed to recover hit points. (Characters will still
recover hit points even without curing spells from clerics, but at a very slow
rate.) The wall takes a random number of hits to destroy. Be sure to rest
again after destroying the wall to return everyone to full strength. You
should also save the game here.

Step into the teleporter T7. As soon as you arrive at the destination, you
will be greeted by one final battle. This final monster is not even described
in the Bestiary. It looks a little bit like the Mind Flayer and is not that
difficult to defeat. Be sure to pick up the Eye of Talon at (30). Go through
the illusion wall to the north and step into the teleporter T8 which returns
you to a secret room just east of the row of pits before the fireball maze on
the main level.

The plaque at (31) acknowledges the fact that you have beaten the challenge.
Pick up the polished shield at (32) and all the spellbooks and holy symbols
that you previously left behind at (33). Go through the illusion wall to the
west then travel south east. There is a plaque at (34) that informs you that
this is the SENTRY area. You will have to fight a bulette around this area and
receive a crystal key after the battle. Use the crystal key in the keyhole at
(35) to open the door to the north.

Locations (36), (37) and (38) are three levers. On the south wall at (39) is a
button. Every time you move the levers to a different combination and then
push the button at (39), the layout of the area to the south east changes! The
objective here is to get to the object protected by transparent walls. Go
right ahead if you wish to experiment.

The combination that will work is: (36) down; (37) down; (38) up. Push the
button at (39). The layout of the area will now match _exactly_ with that
shown on the map. The object of interest is at location (41). It is an amulet
of life. Get it and then leave. The door at (40) can be open/closed by a
button on the north floor. There is a pressure plate behind the door and
apparently bulettes are continuously being generated right in the area also.
But other than that, I did not notice any other effect from the pressure
plate.

Retrace your steps and return to the SENTRY area. There are 6 pressure plates
here and a wall that moves sideways (east/west) when you step on the plates.
You will find that no matter which plate you start on, the wall will always be
right in front of you blocking you way south when you get to the front row.

Stand on the plate at (42) and throw either rocks or bones at the plate at
(43) until the wall moves completely to the west side. Moving south now from
location (42) will get you past the wall. At location (44) there is a smooth
hole on the west wall. Put your Eye of Talon in the hole _and_ then remove it.
The door to the south will open. (Be sure to put the Eye back in your
inventory. You will need it again later.)

There is a pressure plate at (45). Stepping on this plate summons three
bulettes and at the same time, closes the door you just came through. As long
as you take care not to get surrounded by the bulettes, the fight should not
be too big a problem for your party. The button on the east wall at location
(46) reopens the door behind (44). Take the stairs labelled D up to Level 3.

The stairs labelled E leads to a hallway, and then a room, and then another set
of stairs labelled F.

Stairs F leads to a room of moving pits. It is not difficult to get to the
stairs G on the other side of the room. Just follow the route shown on the
map.

Stairs G leads to another room of moving pits. The route to get across this
room a bit trickier because it requires several direction changes. I strong
recommend that you turn and move forward so that you can always look at the
tile in front of you before you step on it. There should be enough time to do
that and still avoid falling into a pit. Again, follow the route shown on the
map. This will lead you to the stairs labelled H.

The stairs H leads you into a room with a teleporter T5 in the center. Be sure

As soon as you reach level 4 via the stairs labelled I, you will have to fight a
couple of Aerial Servants. They hit hard and they have lots of hit points
themselves. Step into the teleporter T1 which will take you to the main level.

You will have to defeat more Aerial Servants after being teleported. T2 is
another teleporter that will take you back to the area near Stairs I. There's
not much reason to go back there unless you are desperately in need of a place
to rest.

Push the button on the door at (2) to open it. The carving at (3) tells you
that you are about the enter the medusa labyrinth. It also tells you the
importance of the 6 polished shields, all of which you should have found by
now if you follow this walkthru. Tell the carving that you are prepared to
enter and it will open the door to the east for you.

Put a polished shield at each of the locations (4) through (9). Doing so will
open the door at the NW corner. Before entering this door, be sure to retrieve
all 6 shields and give one to each of the 6 characters. It is also a good idea
to keep a saved game here.

The medusa labyrinths are inhabited by medusae and Aerial Servants. The
medusae are not too tough. They can petrify your characters but not very
often. Carrying the polished shields probably help. Once a character is
petrified, however, only the high level mage spell of Stone To Flesh or a bag
of magic dust can cure him/her. The aerial servants are very tough. You should
save the game each time you successfully defeat these monsters.

The labyrinths make up a rather complicated maze. However, there aren't too
many locations that need to be visited. Feel free to explore every tile and
fight every monster to gain experience points. I will only highlight the
important locations.

The door at (10) can be opened by pushing the button on the door. There is
nothing interesting behind the door. The doors at (11) and (12) both have
buttons. Push them to open the doors.

There is a tooth key at (13). There are also quite a few Aerial Servants
lurking around in this neighborhood. Be very wary. The shaded tile is a
walkway sometimes, and a wall at other times.

Be alert when you traverse the north/south corridor at the western edge of the
dungeon. The spinner turns you around 180 degrees. The hidden teleporter T3
activates only the first time you step in it. It brings you back to near the
south end of the corridor. Nothing happens during subsequent visit to T3. All
the shaded tiles in this area can change from walkways to walls as you
travel.

There is a button on the south wall at (14). Pushing it will open both doors
that lead to the east. There are quite a few medusae behind the doors and more
than likely, you will get surrounded by a few of them. Push the button on the
door at (15) to open it. Pick up the mage scroll of Invisibility 10' Radius
and the Stone Dagger at (16). Open the door at (17) by pushing the button on
it.

To understand what needs to be done in this area, go to (18) and read the
plaque on the wall. There are 4 pressure plates in this area at locations (19)
through (22). The idea is to get a medusa to stand on each plate, then closing
off the doors leading to that plate, thus trapping the medusa. Once you have
done that to all 4 pressure plates, the door at (23) opens, allowing further
progress.

Lure a medusa into a plate room by getting in front of her and then walk
backwards into a plate room. When she is standing on a plate, cast the cleric
spell of Hold Person. This will freeze the medusa motionless for a short
period of time. Close the doors leading to the plate and she will be trapped
inside. One word of caution, you must leave the plate at (22) till last or you
will end up trapping yourself. A little bit of reflection while studying the
map and you will understand what I mean.

After trapping a medusa at (19), (20) and (21), close the north and south
doors that lead to (22). Use the east and west doors to move through as you
lure the last medusa into position. Once you have successfully trapped the 4
medusae, the door at (23) opens.

Push the button on the door at (24) to open it. At (25) are 2 femurs, 2 skulls
and the Hilt of Talon. There are a skull, 2 femurs and a mage scroll of Flesh
To Stone. At (27) pushing the lower brick on the north wall will open the east
passage. Use the tooth key at the creature skull at (28) to open the door to
the south.

At (29) click on the royal banner on the east wall then pick up the mage
scroll of Cone of Cold at (30). There is a pressure plate at (31). Before
stepping on this plate to find out what happens, order your mage(s) to
memorize as many level 5 Hold Monsters spells as they can. Then rest to
recover hit points and spells. Keep a saved game at this point.

When you step on the pressure plate at (31), you would be surrounded on all 4
sides by transparent walls. You will see Dran who is thrilled to spring this
little trap on your party. After some suitable amount of gloating and threats
from Dran, the pressure plate opens up into a pit and your party is dropped to
the next level, level 5.

At (1) you find a mage scroll of Cone Of Cold. This level is inhabited by Frost
Giants who are terrible monsters because when they strike, they inflict damage
on every character in the party with one blow. The beginning of this level is
also the toughest. You have to defeat a wave of 3 giants before you can rest,
and the next wave has 4 giants.

Fireball and Magic Missile will work against the giants, but I prefer the Hold
Monster spell. This works about half of the time. When it works, the giant
will stop dead in its tracks, long enough for your two fighters to easily hack
him into oblivion if you have the mage spell of Haste running at the same
time. I like it because your party will take absolutely no damage this way.

If you wish to use this tactic, cast Haste before you meet the giants head on.
Then cast Hold Monster as soon as you are in line with a giant. If the spell
doesn't take, simply restore the game until the spell works. And be sure to
save after each successful battle. After playing through with two different
parties, it seemed to me that the high level the mage was, the more frequently
the Hold Monster spell would work.

If you do not have enough Hold Monster spells to take care of the last 1 or 2
giants in the second group of 4, try the fight-backup tactics. There may just
be enough room in the narrow hallway for you to beat them without taking
damage.

There is a button on the door at (2). Push it to open the door. (You will find
giants behind each and every door on this level, so be prepared.) There are 3
moving pits in the hallway behind this door. The pattern is such that it is
impossible to get across directly to the west end. You will have to detour to
the north after crossing the second pit and then wait for the right moment to
finish the journey west. There is nothing of interest at the end of that
hallway. I should note also that the illusionary wall shown on the map only
allows travelling from west to east, not vice versa. The door at (3) can also
be opened by pushing the button on the door, but there is nothing else worthy
of note in that area.

The door at (4) can be opened on either side with the push of a button. There
are 5 pits in a row along the east/west hallway south of this door. If you try
to cross all 5 pits to get to the other side, you will never make it. What you
have to do here is to cross the first 2 pits and then turn south until you
reach (5). This is quite easy to do.

At (5) you will have to defeat a couple of frost giants. If you wish, push the
button on the door at (6) to open it, and fight 2 more giants inside. This
will increase your characters' experience points, but little else. When you
are done, return to (5). You should save the game here.

From (5), it is quite possible to go across the two pits to the north, and
then 3 more to the west. The trick lies in finding the right moment to begin
your trek. Study the pattern. You will find that there are really 2 likely
opportunities when you can start moving north. One will quickly drop you
through one of the pits. Restore and try the other one. And I recommend that
you turn to the left when you have to change direction, rather than
side-stepping.

The doors at (7) and (8) can be opened by pushing the buttons on the doors.
There is nothing behind either door except frost giants. Fight'em or leave'em.
Return to (7) and then pick the right moment to cross the two pits to the
north. This should very easy to do. There is a frost giant at (9) that you
will have to defeat. Again, push the button on the door at (9) to open it and
fight more frost giants if you wish. That's entirely up to you. Save your game
here.

Study the pattern of the pits and move to location (10) as soon as the pit
there is filled. Push the button on the door to open it. If the frost giant
behind the door is not right at the doorway, take a step forward to get away
from the potential pit. Either way, fight the giant and enter the door as soon
as you can. Push the button on the door at (11) to open it. There are 3 more
giants here waiting for you. Open the door at (12) the same way after you
defeat the 3 giants.

Finally! At (13) you will find a mysterious giant who tells you a story about
how Dran tricked the giants a long time ago. Be sure to pick up the Talon's
Tongue that he leaves behind. At (14) is a stone portal. Use the Stone Dagger
on the portal to return to the Cleric Barracks level.

Using the stone dagger on the portal at the frost giant level (level 5 of the
Moonmark Tower) returns you to location (16) on the cleric barracks level. Exit
the door to the east and then go south and east a couple of steps. You are now
in front of the crimson keyhole at location (29). Use the crimson key in this
keyhole to open the door to the south.

At (30) you will find the unique looking wall carving. The rather cryptic
message from the frost giant should make some sense here. This is where you
have to use all three parts of the talon. Put the eye, the hilt and the tongue
of the talon in the carving. This opens up the western passage. Be sure to
pick up the +4 talon lying on the floor.

Take the stairs labelled E. The area this takes you to is shown at the north
east corner of the map. You will fight a couple of clerics around location
(31). One of them will leave a flail which didn't seem to be a particularly
good weapon. Pick up the mage scroll of True Seeing at (32). Return to the
main level via the stairs labelled E.

Location (33) is pressure plate. Stepping on this plate will trigger fireballs
coming at you from the west. Retreat and duck to the south (right) to avoid
it. You will see that the plate at (33) is now depressed. Stepping on it a
second time returns it to its normal position but does not trigger another
fireball. Be careful of the fast moving pit. Getting past it to the Stairs F
should not be much of a problem. Take the Stairs F up to the North Talon
Tower.

This is a very small single level tower. The only thing tricky about this level
is the existence of three hidden teleporters that can be very disorienting to
unsuspecting adventurers. Pay special attention to the locations of teleporters
T1, T2 and T3 and their destinations shown on the map. Note that there is also a
destination for a teleporter T4. This teleporter is in the South Talon Tower
that we will get to a little later.

Shortly after leaving Stairs F, you will be teleported by T1. Be prepare to
fight a cleric that can hurl some strong fireballs in the area around location
(1). Be sure to pick up the crimson ring he leaves behind. There is a
triangular wall niche at (2). Anything you place in this niche turns into a
glass sphere. You will need three of these spheres later in the game. Check
your inventory and use the niche to generate all the spheres that you think
you will need.

At (3) there is a lever that turns off the teleporter T1 and at (4) there is a
second lever that turns off T2 and T3. Push both levers to turn off all the
teleporters. (Note: be careful to avoid T2 when you move from (3) to (4).) Now
you can return to the stairs labelled F. Take the stairs back to the cleric
barracks level.

After returning via Stairs F, be careful to avoid falling into the fast moving
pit just to the east. Also, be sure to move quickly forward and then to the
right after stepping on the pressure plate at (33).

When you stand on the pressure plate at (34), you will notice that the hallway
extends one more step further to the west. Drop an object here to keep the
plate weighed down. When you stand on the plate at (35), the wall on the south
side at the end of the hallway disappears. Drop another object to weigh down
this plate. After fighting some clerics, take the stairs labelled G up to the

After emerging from Stairs G, follow the corridor to location (1). Click on
the banner on the north wall. You will find a crimson ring. Push the button on
the door to the south to open it. Inside the room are a series of teleporters.
Note that T2 and T3 both teleport to location (2), while T4 will send you all
the way over to the NORTH Talon Tower (NTALON.IFF).

After entering the door at (1), enter teleporter T3. You will find yourself at
location (2). There is a parchment of sticky paper here. Pick it up and put it
in inventory, but do _not_ equip it. Enter the teleport T6 to the south. When
you materialize, you will notice that T3 has disappeared. Look at the east
wall at (3). There is a circular carving here. Place a crimson ring over the
carving. The wall will dissolve and a void open up in front of you. Enter the
void.

You are now at location (4) on level 2. The west wall has a circular carving
that will allow you to return to level 1 if you use a crimson ring. But we
have no need to return. At (5) there is a mage scroll of Fear. There are two
more crimson rings lying on the floor at (6). Every time you try to approach
them, they will move a square further away from you. To pick them up, drop the
sticky paper on the floor next to them and you will be able to walk up to the
rings and pick them up. The rings are only useful if you wish to make a return
trip.

The plaque at (7) is just another hint at using the sticky paper on the rings.
The circular carving at (8) should be obvious by now. Put a crimson ring over
the carving to dissolve the wall. Enter the void beyond.

You are now at location (9) on level 3. Read the plaque at (10). Explain to me
what it means if you ever figure it out. Be sure to pick up the MAPAJ coin at
(11). Go through the illusionary walls to the west. There is a +3 plate mail
at (12), a +2 robe and a SHALL REJOICE coin at (13). Take the stairs labelled
H up to level 4.

Level 4 is very difficult, if not impossible to map. The walls and walkways
shift every which way depending on your movements. Fortunately, there is only
one item that you need from this level. And it is at location (14). Follow the
route shown on the map. Be sure to turn and then move forward each time there
is a direction change. This route is guaranteed to take you to location (14)
successfully if you use it immediately after coming up the Stairs H.

You will meet a strange character at (14). Allow this character to TOUCH you.
He will exchange the MAPAJ and the SHALL REJOICE coins that you found earlier
with another coin. Be sure to pick up the coin from the floor. The go south 3
spaces and then west to the stairs labelled I.

There is another character at the NE corner that has a rather cryptic message.
There is a green force field in a hallway at the SE corner. This force field
can be eliminated by the mage spell of Disintegrate. It was told to me that
Insal the thief was behind this force field, and that he also has a coin to
give. I never found Insal behind the force field myself. And I'll leave it up
to you to decide if you wish to explore this level further. When you are
finished, take the stairs labelled I up to level 5.

Level 5 is just one long winding corridor. Beware of fireball hurling clerics,
especially around location (1). You will find a bracer of protection after the
fight. Be sure to use the illusionary walls to get to the last section of the
corridor, avoiding teleporter T1. Take the Stairs J up to level 6.

There are two coin slots (2) and (3) on level 6 that control the two doors
leading to the rest of the level. It is only necessary to open one of the two
doors. Use the coin in the slot at (2). This opens the door to the west.

The rest of the doors at (4) through (7) can all be opened by pushing the
buttons on the doors. There are high level clerics behind all these doors. Do
not hesitate to use mage spells on them. And move aside when necessary to
avoid their spells. At (8), the clerics will open the east door to fight you.
You will find a +1 ring of protection after the battle. Take the Stairs K up
to level 7.

There are only a couple of hell hounds on this level. Get rid of them and you
may explore in peace. There is a plaque at (10). There are three altars at
locations (13), (14) and (15), each one protected by a force field. There are
a couple of notched disks on the walls at (11) and (12). Turn one of the disks
all the way around so that the notch is at the 12 o'clock position. Make sure
that the notch on the second disk is also at the 12 o'clock position. This
shuts off the force field at (13). At the same time, the shaded wall next to
the altar disappears. Approach the altar and place a glass sphere on it.

Next, turn both disks so that both notches are at the 3 o'clock position. The
force field guarding the altar at (14) is turned off and the shaded wall next
to the altar disappears. Put another glass sphere on the altar.

Repeat the same procedure for the altar at (15). This time turn both disks so
that both notches are at the 6 o'clock position. Once you place a glass sphere
on this third altar, you will see the hole in the ceiling. Go to the east side
of location (16). Pull the ring on the wall and you will be teleported to
level 8.

You are at location (1) when you first arrive at this level. Before doing
anything else, let me describe the area layout for you.

The room to the west (locations (2) and (3)) is a generation center of mind
flayers. Mind flayers are very tough because they cast psychic blasts that can
easily paralyze most of your party in the first few rounds. You can never
completely kill off all the mind flayers. The game generates more of them all
the time. If you do want to explore the mind flayer rooms, make them your
first destination after arriving at this level. Head west into the mind flayer
room. You will probably be attacked by a salamander or two along the way, but
they are fairly easy to beat. Once in the room, avoid stepping on location
(2). Doing so will open both doors to the west and immediately summon numerous
mind flayers. If you do not step on (2), you will have some time to check out
all the surrounding areas before mind flayers appear. The only point of
interest is the crystal ball at (3) which shows a few scenes depicting some
events in the history of the Darkmoon Temple.

The room to the north (4) is inhabited by salamanders. They are not difficult
to defeat and are especially susceptible to Cone of Cold spell. Again, the
game will continuously generate more and more of them, so that clearing them
out completely is impossible.

The room to the south (5) is empty and makes a nice resting place when
necessary. Be aware that both the salamanders and mind flayers have the
ability to open doors to come after you if they are close enough to sense your
presence.

The door to the east has no buttons or keyholes. There are, however, two
triangular niches on either side of the door, protected by blue force fields.
Cast the cleric spell of Dispel Magic in front of each niche. The force field
will disappear and you will find an amulet of life and an amulet of death
respectively. Doing so also opens the door.

You will find a dying cleric when you enter this door. Pick up the stone cross
that's lying on the floor. The room north of here has nothing of interest that
I can find. You should rest here to recover your hit points. It's also a good
idea to check your inventory and make sure your 2 fighters are equipped with
the best weapons that you have. Take the Stairs L to level 9.

At (1) push the button on the door to open it. Once you enter this door, it will
close automatically. There is no escape now until you have successfully killed
Dran. The doors at (2), (3) and (4) can all be opened by pushing the buttons on
them. You should cast the mage spell of Haste and then save your game before
opening the door at (4).

You will confront Dran Draggore for a final time at (5). From this point on,
it's a fight to the death. I never found a spell that's effective against Dran
and trying to cast spells while doing the "fight and dance" routine only
served to mess up my timing. Eventually, I simply resorted to pure hack n'
slash.

The best way to battle Dran is to lure him south to one of the 2X3 areas.
Swing at him once and then step aside. When he moves in front of you, have the
other fighter take a swing and then step aside again. If he moves to your
flank instead of in front of you, you must quickly move forward and then turn
around to track him. With some practice, this dance routine is not difficult
to perfect. But you almost must use the keyboard for movement and the mouse to
swing the weapons in order to get the timing right. Every so often, Dran will
actually move _away_ from you. If your party is in good shape, use this
opportunity to save the game to record your progress.

Don't be too quick to congratulate yourself when Dran goes down the first
time. Remember his namesake. The fight is only half over and your trouble is
just beginning. The second half of the fight requires even quicker and better
timing on your part but the logistics are the same. Good luck. The people at
Waterdeep awaits report of your victory.
