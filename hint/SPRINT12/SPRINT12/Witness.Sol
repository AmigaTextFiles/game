                              THE WITNESS

                                Part 1

 This part really doesn't require much action by you. Most of your time will be
spent waiting until something happens, but there are a few things you need to do
and some questions that you need to ask. Everything in your inventory that is
pertinent to solving the mystery is in your game package.

 Walk up to the front door and ring the bell. Then, just keep entering the
command "WAIT" until you get to the office with Mr. Linder.

 Sit in the wooden chair, read the note Mr. Linder gives you, and ask him about
the following: Stiles, Virginia, Monica, Phong. Show him the matchbook and note
his reaction. Then wait until something happens. The something that happens is
Mr. Linder's murder.

                               Part 2

 There are lots of areas to explore in this section of the game, so I will only
tell you the things you must do to solve the case and get a conviction.

 The first thing to do is stand up. When Phong appears, ask him about Monica and
show him the matchbook.

 Look under the desk. Press the button. Look under the clock. Examine the window
carefully. Analyze the putty. (The wires and putty are a big clue.)

 Next, unlock and open the outside door. Go east and examine the footprints. Go
south. You'll find a handgun. Wait for Duffy to get back, then analyze the
handgun.

 Return to the office and proceed to the living room to question Stiles. Ask

Stiles about Mr. Linder and the call. Show him the matchbook, the note, and the
muddy handgun (you should have it back by now -- if not, wait for Duffy).

                               Part 3

 Return to the office. Hide behind the lounge and wait for Monica. She will come
in once and run out. Stay hidden and wait for her again. When she returns, she
will do something strange. Stand up immediately and handcuff her immediately.
Search her. You will find a key. Phong will enter soon after. Ask him about the
clock.

 Unlock the clock, open it, and examine it carefully. Ask Monica about the
clock. Show Monica the handgun and then ask her about Stiles. When Duffy
returns, have him analyze the powder found on the clock.

 Search Monica for a gun. Examine the hidden handgun carefully. Show it to
Monica. Wait for Duffy and then analyze the hidden handgun.

 Accuse Monica of murder. This will prompt something of a confession. Get the
report from her bedroom. Read it and then return to the office. Show the report
to Phong and then to Monica. When Duffy returns, have the report analyzed.

 When Duffy shows up with the analysis, arrest Monica for murder!
