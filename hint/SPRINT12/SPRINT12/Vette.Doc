1. INTRODUCTION

Racing through the streets.
People the world over have always challenged one another in competition. From
the first runners, throwers, and lifters they have competed, at first person
against person, later with the help of animals and machines. The competition
using machines has envolved into auto racing as we know it today; however, only
a few have experienced organized automobile racing. For most, this natural
desire to compete with our machines can be satisfied only by racing them on the
streets. What you are about to experience is just such an experience, but from
the safety of your own computer. The car you will be driving has its
introduction, been the quintessential street racer. You will be competing with
the most impressive crop of high-performance cars ever produced, but with an
advantage over them. You are in control, and you will decide your exact course.
Your skills will allow you to race the mighty VETTE! and beat the best the rest
of the world has to offer.

Corvette never enjoyed the factory racing sponsorship granted such makes as
Ferrari, Jaguar, Porsche, and many others, yet it became the dream car of every
red-blooded American child since its introduction in 1953. The car's tremenous
potential but lack of official racing sponsorship has resulted in two
generations of drivers who have used the inherent strengths of the car for
racing on the streets.

From straight line drag racing to the ultimate thrill of racing through city
streets and freeways, the VETTE! has always enjoyed the most enviable
reputation as the KING of the street racers. This reputation has not always
been because of the racing victories but from the pure beauty of the car. It
looks awesome, sexy and FAST. Of course it is all of these and more.

2. HISTORY OF THE VETTE!

In February 1953, the New York Motorama displayed the first prototype of the
all new Corvette. It was a white convertable powered by the 235-cubicinch,
truck-based, straight six-cylinder engine mated to the two-speed, Power Glide,
automatic transmission. In order to meet the show deadline for the prototype,
the designers, led by Harley Earl, decided to use a new material for the body
panels. This material, Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP), was also used in the
initial production run of 300 units as an interim measure until the new metal
Kirksite was available. As fate would have it, the new metal and its tooling
were not to be, and the Corvette body remained GRP for the next year's run of
3,265 (of the planned 12,000 units). It is still made of fibreglass today.

The interest in the 1953 prototype was so great that Chevrolet went into
production immediately, and on June 30th of that year the first unit rolled off
the assembly line. Production continued with the six-cylinder engine and
automatic transmission until the 1955 model year production, which saw the
introduction of the 256-cubic-inch, small block V-8 engine with a three-speed,
manual transmission. The 1955 production run was only 700 units, and the car
was on the vergeof being cancelled by Chevrolet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 4

The Ford Thunderbird was introduced in 1954 for the 1955 model year. That
introduction brought a new awareness to the American people of the benefits of
a two-seater 'personal car', and with it a new hope for the VETTE! The 1956
Corvette had a restyled body shape. (Quick body panel changes were possible up
to the last minute because of the GRP material being used). This was the year
that the Corvette and Thunderbird faced each other at Daytona for the NASCAR
Speed week. With the help of the engine designer/driver Zora Arkus Dontov, who
took over for Ed Cole, the new Corvette production car managed to reach a top
speed of 150.583 mph. This impressive feat was not enough to beat the
Thunderbird in the quarter-mile runs, but established the car as one to be
reckoned with in the racing circuit.

In the 1957 model year, the designers added a fuel injection system to the
Corvette and bored out the 265 to 283 cubic inches. The injection boosted the
power of the 256 up to 283 brake horsepower (bhp), achieving the automotive
milestone of one bhp per cubic inch. This was the year that Corvette raced at
Daytona and Sebring with full factory supports. The Sebring race was the most
impressive for Chevrolet, with the win there putting the name 'Corvette' on the
lips  of everyone in motor car racing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 5

The 1958 through 1962 model year saw the addition of a myriad of options, both
in the drivetrain and in external trim pieces. These changes caused a weight
gain to over the magical 3000 pound marker. In 1960 sales increased to 10,000
units and continued to rise to 14,531 units in 1962. These sales figures were
aided by Ford's withdrawal of the Thunderbird from the market. In 1962 the
engine displacement also increased to 327 cubic inches. Corvette's evolution
over the first 10 years of production had emphasized the performance of the
engine and transmission, without much development of the suspension. This was
to be dramatically changed with the next model year.

The Sting Ray Corvette was introduced in 1963 with a totally revised body
derived from Bill Mitchell's racing efforts. It was the first year to utilize
revolutionary suspension design components like the independent rear suspension
and ladder frame. This was also the first coupe available as a Corvette, and
the only year that Mitchell's split rear windshield was produced.

1964 marked the beginning of the horsepower race for all of Detroit's car
makers. The Corvette was no exception. Matched with the new 4-speed, manual
transmission, the 327-cubic-inch engine produced 375 bhp at 6200 rpm and 350
lbs/ft of torque at

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 6

4600 rpm. In the 1965 edition, a 396 ci produced 425 bhp, and the 1966 model
introduced a massive 427-cubic-inch engine. This and the next year saw small
styling changes and minor mechanical changes. Aside from engine output, the
only major change was the introduction of four-wheel, disc brakes in 1965.

The year 1967 more or less settled the horsepower race. Corvette was declared
the winner with the introduction of the L88 with its 12.5:1 compression ratio,
alloy manifold and aluminium heads. The model was snatched up from dealers for
a total of 20,000 sold. This monster produced 560 bhp at 6400 rpm. A privately
sponsored, fuel-injected race car recorded a top speed of 192 miles per hour at
Bonneville.

Aerodynamic and structural improvements were the order of the day for the next
several years. The sales figures and performance statistics steadily increased.
John Z. DeLorean returned in 1968 to actively manage the production runs, to
the record sales year of 1969 of 38,000 units. Power train and suspension
improvements along with luxury amenities raised both the price and the weight
of the car. The biggest engine ever put in front of the firewall was introduced
for 1970: the 454 ci option that delivered 390 bhp at 4800 rpm, actually 45
horsepower less than the 427 engine. The decline in horsepower per bhp was
caused by the advent of emission legislation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 7

For most of the 1970s, horsepower continued to decline while sales went up.
Horsepower fell from 330 in 1970 to 225 in 1976 to 165 in 1978. The big engines
were phased out of production in the 1974 model year. Sales figures, which
remained high, totalled 37,000 in 1974 (a new record) and increased slightly in
1975. The convertible was gone in 1976. in 1978, major style revision took
place with a return to the fastback shape of the mid-60s and production of the
Silver Jubilee edition. Horsepower was also back on the rise, with the biggest
power plant, the L82, producing 220 bhp at 5200 rpm.

Only small changes were made in the following years until major re-styling
occured for the 1984 edition. The Corvette was also put on a diet, given a more
aerodynamic shape and a new electronic dash. All these changes have carried
over to the current models. Other evolutionary changes of the past few years
have broght increased horsepower and at the same time increased fuel
efficiency.

The present day VETTE! is the one you are about to experience in four variants,
two from Chevrolet and two from after-market whizz, Reeves Callaway. This is an
exciting car - powerful, strong and quick. Take care of your new car, and enjoy
the thrill of racing.

3. STARTING AND OPERATING

Starting Mechanisms.
After or during the VETTE! title screen, press any key on the keyboard or a
button on your mouse to begin the game. To view the credits, wait a few seconds
until they display on your screen.

You have now entered the Performance Test Garage fot your vehicles. By pressing
the left and right arrow keys or the right mouse button you will be able to
select the vehicle of your choice.

After you have highlighted your selection, press RETURN or the left button on
your mouse to confirm your selection and start the performance test.

After you choose your VETTE model at the Performance Test Garage, you will be
prompted to select a driving skill level: Trainee, Rookie, or Pro. The three
different skill levels change the following parameters in the game:

Level    Damage     Traction     Police     Cruise Control
-----    ------     --------     ------     --------------
Trainee  None       High         None       Constant
Rookie   Reduced    Moderate     Present    Constant
Pro      Realistic  Realistic    Present    Realistic

If damage is set to none, you cannot hurt your VETTE no matter what you hit.
Moderate damage affects your car's performance, and realisic damage can totally
wreck your car. If traction is set to high, it will

NOTE:
----
The left-hand chart shows statistics about your chosen car's performance
specifications.

Press the space bar if you want to run a performance test on your selected car.
The right-hand chart will display an acceleration graph illustrating the car's
acceleration of all gears in their top speed in colour coded bars representing
each gear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 12

not oversteer and spin out as easily as at the higher skill levels. If you
commit a traffic offence, you will be chased by the police unless you're a
trainee. When cruise control is constant at Trainee and Rookie levels, breaking
and accelerating will set a new speed for the cruise control to maintain. When
cruise control is realistic, it will automatically turn off when you break and
reset to a new speed when you accelerate.

After you have made your skill level selection, you can check out your
opponents' cars at the next screen and pick one to race against. While
previewing the opponent car in 3D, use F7 and F8 too zoom in and out, F9 and
F10 to change the camera angle, and + and - to change the speed of rotation.
The skill level of your chosen opponent will be matched against your own. You
can choose your opponent car with a joystick (press the fire button to select
the car) or a mouse (the right button toggles throgh the opponents and the left
button selects the car). Once you've selected your opponent car, the game will
proceed to the Course Selection screen.

Menu Options.
You can access the available menu options at any time in the game by pressing
the ESC key. The ESC key brings up three options: File, Control, and
Communications.

NOTE:
----
The menu option defaults to "Keyboard" for Control.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 13

The File menu will bring up four choices: Return to Game, Tour Mode ON/OFF,
Quit to Garage, and Quit to DOS. When the Tour Mode is on, the race is
suspended and the T key is activated. When you press T your VETTE is
automatically teleported to the next landmark. The front dash will display the
name of the landmark. Since the race clock is deactivated in Tour Mode, you can
drive around the landmark as long as you like and then press T to see the next
landmark. If you turn off Tour Mode, you will resume the race where you left
off. If you choose "Quit to Garage", your current race will be aborted but you
can choose another car and another race. "Quit to DOS" will exit the game and
return you to the DOS prompt. To rejoin the game choose "Return to Game".

The Control menu has three options: Mouse ON/OFF, Joystick ON/OFF and
Calibrate. The joystick will not work unless you first calibrate it.
"Calibrate" will be dimmed until the Joystick is selected. "Calibrate" also
lets you adjust the sensitivity of the joystick control from 1 to 10. If both
"Mouse" and "Joystick" are set to off, the game defaults to the keyboard for
control.

You can also select "Cancel" to return to the Control menu if you decide not
to calibrate your joystick.

NOTE:
----
"Hang Up Line" and "Off-Line/On-Line" are not available until you're connected
over a modem. If you are playing over a modem and you wish to disconnect after
finishing a race, select "Hang Up Line" from the Communications menu. You can
also choose "Off-Line" when you're at the Performance Garage if you wish to
talk to your friend. Once you've finished speaking with your friend over the
phone, choose "On-Line" to race head-to-head again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 14

The Communicatoins menu brings up two options: Two Players ON/OFF and Hang Up
Line. If you choose "Two Players", you will next see a full-size screen
labelled "Two Player Communications". This screen has three sections. The first
section displays three options: Connection, Port, and Baud Rate. You can toggle
through these options by pressing the up and down arrow keys. Once "Port" is
selected, for example, you can use the left and right arrow keys to toggle
through the values available. You can select one of the values by continuing
onto the next option.

All the available options ans values are shown below:

Connection:          (Direct) (Modem)
Port:                (Com 1) (Com 2)
Baud Rate:           (1200) (2400) (4800) (9600) (19.2K) (38.4K) (57.6K)
Mode:                (Call) (Answer)
Procedure:           (Initiate Call) (Take Over Line)
Dial:                (Standard) (Special)
Line Type:           (Tone) (Pulse)
(Phone Number) (Dial String):
Save Options:        (Yes) (No)
Done?:               (Yes) (Cancel)

Choose "Direct" if you wish to connect two computers with a null-modem serial
cable. See the next page for a cable diagram.

Select "Com 1" or "Com 2" depending on which serial port you're using (PC).

If you're playing over a modem, choose the fastest modem baud rate in common
for you and your opponent. If you're playing over a null-modem serial cable,
try the highest speed of 57.6K. If that doesn't work, keep trying the next
highest baud rate until you reach 9600 baud.

If you choose "Modem" for Connection, the second and third screen sections will
appear.

Select "Call" or "Answer" depending on what you and your friend have decided
beforehand.

Choose "Take Over Line" if you wish to dial by hand. The default is "Initiate
Call".

If your modem is not Hayes-compatible or if you wish to enter the modem
commands yourself, select "Special".

If you choose "Standard", you can enter a phone number below. If you choose
"Special", you can enter a direct modem command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 15

You can save your communications setup (port, baud rate, phone number, etc.) by
choosing "Yes" for Save Options.

Once you reach the bottom of the screen, you can start the head-to-head play by
choosing "Yes" or return back to the main menu by choosing "Cancel". You can
also use the main mouse on this screen. Move the mouse up and down to highlight
the different options. Press the right button to toggle through the values and
the left to select "Yes" or "Cancel" for "Done?"

Head-To-Head Play
If you're playing over a direct connection, you will need a null-modem serial
cable. You can use either a regular serial cable with a null-modem adapter
(which you can buy from any computer store) or else a special null-modem serial
cable. In either case, pins 2 and 3 must be swapped and the pin for the ground
must be straight through. See the diagram below.

If you're playing head-to-head over a modem, decide who will be the caller and
the answerer beforehand, as well as which course you'll be racing on. You will
not be allowed to race simultaneously on different courses.

When you play head-to-head, you are racing not only the clock but your opponent
to finish line. If your opponent crosses the finish line ahead of you, the
program will notify you. You can then press ESC to quit the race.

NOTE:
-----
The communications setup remains in effect until you change it or exit the
game. You can also save the communications setup to disk by choosing "Save
Options" at the Communications screen.

5 COURSE DESCRIPTIONS

1    San Francisco Zoo to Vista Point (Golden Gate Bridge)
2    Golden Gate Bridge to Bay Bridge
3    Bay Bridge to San Francisco Zoo
4    San Francisco Zoo to Golden Gate Bridge to Bay Bridge back to San
     Francisco Zoo

Following the Performance Test Garage, you choose the course by pressing the
arrow keys or moving the joystick around.

After you have highlighted your selection, press RETURN or the button on your
joystick to confirm your selection.

Although you cannot use a joystick at the Course Selection screen, you can use
a mouse to select your course by pressing the right button to toggle through
the different courses and the left button to choose one. The two maps included
with the package will aid you in navigation through San Francisco, but do not
offer the same level of details as the game. It's up to you to determine the
best route for each racecourse. If you're looking for a freeway onramp, drive
under the green freeway signs.

To make your visit to the "City by the Bay" even

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 27

more enjoyable, we have included an on-board navigation map. Just press H for
"Help" and a map inset will toggle on and display the locations of both your
car and your opponent's. Your VETTE shows up as the red blip on the on-board
map. The map also shows your compass heading in the upper right-hand corner.

Also designed to aid you in navigation through the city streets is the traffic
control icon on your front dash. Traffic information is displayed there to give
you, the driver, enough time to plan ahead for the next intersection.

San Francisco Zoo to Golden Gate Bridge
Your first course statrs at the San Francisco Zoo northwest of Lake Merced. The
city zoo houses over 1,000 mammals and birds and includes a koala bear breeding
facility. The zoo's showcase is the $2 million Gorilla World, a nature-like
enclosure for large primates.

As you drive north on the Great Highway, you'll be paralleling the Pacific
Coast with its spectacular surf and beaches. You'll pass by the Golden Gate
Park, the "Central Park of the West". Spanning nearly half the width of the
city, San Francisco's favourite park is over 1,000 acres of gardens, lawns and
forests. The transformation of sand dunes to park

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 28

grounds was begun in 1887 by John McLaren. Golden Gate Park is also the home of
the California Academy of Sciences, the DeYoung Memorial Museum and other
cultural sites. Further on, you can view California sea lions from the Cliff
House overlooking Ocean Beach.

As you turn right on Geary Boulevard, you'll pass by Lincoln Park on the left
with Monterey cypresses guarding its golf course. Lincoln Park is also the home
of the California Legion of Honor with its fine collection of French paintings.
As Lincoln Boulevard turns left, you'll be bordering the Presidio, the oldest
active military base in the nation. Established by the Spanish in 1776, the
Presidio is now composed of 1500 acres of beautiful wooded hills and has been
declared a National Historic Landmark.

Finally, you approach the Golden Gate Bridge, the most photographed landmark
of San Francisco. Built in 1936, the Golden Gate Bridge connects the city to
Marin County with 8,981 feet of orange painted steel. Once across the bridge,
your race ends at Vista Point, where you can admire the entire San Francisco
Bay.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 29

Golden Gate  Bridge to Bay Bridge
Your second course starts at Vista Point, north of the Golden Gsate Bridge.
You'll be able to choose from many different routes to get to your destination,
the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge located on the waterfront. This World War
II army base has been transformed into a home for many cultural groups, such as
theatre workshops and art studios. Further down is Aquatic Park, a lovely lawn
that borders the water. Next door, Fisherman's Wharf features pavement stalls
that sell fresh crab, shrimp cocktails and sourdough bread. Pier 39,
Ghirardelli Square and the Cannery offer tempting items for purchase nearby.
If you continue to follow the waterfront, you'll be driving down Embarcadero
with its many shipping piers. At the end of the road is the Embarcadero Center,
four skyscrapers connected by a pedestrian mall in one plaza. The Hyatt
Regency, located in the Center, sports a spectacular atrium, rising 170 feet.
The entire hotel itself is topped by a revolving reataurant.

You might decide to try driving down brick-paved Lombard Street, known as "The
Crookedest Street in the World". Make sure your brakes are working because it's
a steep descent!

Your route may take you by the famous Coit Tower

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 30

on Telegraph Hill. Rising above its neighbours, the tower was designed roughly
in the shape of a firehose nozzle. It was built in 1933 as a monument to the
city's volunteer firemen, and its rotunda is decorated with fifteen frescoes
done by WPA artists. Lillie Hitchcook Coit, who had an overwhelming foundness
for fire engines, provided this memorial.

A drive through Chinatown is another possibility on this bridge course.
Chinatown is only sixteen square blocks but more Chinese live here than
anywhere outside Asia. The main entrance to Chinatown on Grant Avenue is
guarded by stone lions on either side of an oriental arch. Grant Avenue is
lined with tearooms, shops, temples, restaurants, and street performers, while
the pavements of Stockton Avenue are overflowing with fresh produce and other
groceries. You can eat the best of Chinese cuisine here in Chinatown. The
crowd-pleased Chinese New Year's parade always brings out plenty of
firecrackers and the famous gold dragon.

Near Chinatown is the Financial District, also known as the "Wall Street of the
West". Immortalized in adverts, the Transamerica Building is the best-known of
San Francisco's skyscrapers and seems to have been inspired by the pyramids of
Egypt. Close by is the shopping mecca of Union Square, lined with fabulous
shops and boutiques.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 31

Just before you drive onto the Bay Bridge, you'll see the Ferry Building. Lit
at night, this clock tower by the bay used to tell the time for those commuting
to San Francisco via ferry boats. Now the Bay Bridge links San Francisco to the
East Bay. Over 8 miles long, this bridge runs through Treasure Island, a
man-made island created for the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition.
Railway trains once ran on the bottom deck of this bridge. The second course
ends on the other side of the Bay Bridge.

Bay Bridge To San Francisco Zoo
Your third course starts on the Oakland side of the Bay Bridge. Driving across
the upper deck of the bridge, you can see the waters of the bay beneath. Once
across, you'll be racing mostly on freeways to reach your final destination,
the San Francisco Zoo.

Going southwest on Interstate 80, you will travel above the South of Market
area. This neighbourhood is also known as "SoMa" for short in homage to SoHo in
New York. The entire area is undergoing a renaissance in the arts with new
galleries and clubs opening almost overnight. Also below Interstate 80 is the
most Moscone centre, a dramatic building built in 1981. Occupying eleven acres,
this mostly-underground hall is distinguished by a glass-and-girder lobby at

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 32

street level and a landscaped lawn over the roof.

You'll next drive south on Highway 101, also known as the Bayshore Freeway. The
road curves around the San Francisco General Hospital. Your route will take you
through the residential neighbourhood of the Mission District, Potrero Hill,
and Bernal Heights.

Turning west on Interstate 280, you'll parallel BART, which stands for Bay Area
Rapid Transit. Reminiscent of Disneyland's monorail, BART operates streamlined
cars that zip beneath, above and beside city streets. This form of public
transport carries hundreds of thousands of commuters into San Francisco daily.
Balboa Park and the City College of San Francisco are across the highway from
each other.

As you approach the coast, you'll turn onto John Daly Boulevard. Your drive
will take you past the Olympic Country Club, one of the world's most beautiful
golf courses. To the north is Fort Funston, a well-known spot for hang gliders.
Across the highway lies Lake Merced, a U-shaped reservoir used by joggers,
rowers, and picknickers. Your third course ends at last at the San Francisco
Zoo.

San Francisco Zoo To Golden Gate Bridge To Bay Bridge Back To San Francisco Zoo
The fourth and last course is a loop of the first three courses in order. You
will start at the San Francisco Zoo, drive to both bridges and finish back at
the zoo. Good Luck!

6 INFORMATION BEFORE DRIVING

Before you can start driving, you will have to answer a question based on the
VETTE! documentation. When a question refers to a map, please look at the text
on the back of the road map. You can drive any VETTE model at lower skill
levels by choosing between Trainee, Rookie or Pro.

We recommend that you limit your speed during the first five races to a maximum
of 55 mph, although you shouldn't drive for long periods of time at any one
constant speed.

Always drive at a moderate speed the first few times through all four courses
in order to become more familiar with them. You should also drive at lower
skill levels (using the 1989 Stock Corvette) until you're more familiar with
the game.

How to operate your vehicle and driving mechanisms
In order to begin the race, press ENTER or the fire button on your joystick to
start the countdown. Now you are ready to race your VETTE! against your
opponents. The race is started by a stoplight. When the light changes from red
to green, it is signalling the beginning of the race.

NOTE:
-----
You cannot start the race until the light turns green.
You can also press A for automatic transmission if you don't wish to manually
change gears.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 34

During the racing process gears range drom 1 to 6 and Reverse (depending on the
model selected). Gears are changed by pressing the corresponding number on the
keyboard. If you're using a joystick, button A is upshift and button B is
downshift one gear. If your joystick has only one button, use the keyboard for
downshifting. Since some cars have automatic transmission, you won't need to
shift gears on those models. Acceleration of your VETTE! is determined by the
gear you are in, the current speed, the degree of turn and the terrain, just as
if you were driving in the real world.

By using the up arrow on your keyboard or pushing the joystick forward, you can
increase the amount of throttle with each successive stroke.

Be careful not to carry too much speed into turns because it can cause spin
outs, slides or accidents when trying to take the sharp corners in the streets
of the San francisco Bay Area. Just as the throttle increases with each
successive stroke, the steering mechanisms work in the same manner. The turning
angle will increase with each successive stroke and decrease each stroke in the
oppisite direction. The steering wheel is self-centring (just as in the real
Corvette). When you release the key or joystick, the wheel will automatically
return to centre. In addition to the wheel being self-centring, you can
straighten

NOTE:
-----
On the numeric keypad, the 7 and 9 keys will allow you to accelerate and turn
left or right respectively. Similiarly, the 1 and 3 keys will brake and turn
left or right respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 36

your VETTE in its lane (except on diagonals) by pressing 5 on the numeric
keypad or K. These keys also function if you're using a joystick or mouse.

Braking is accomplished by holdingdown the down arrow key (and space bar) or
pulling the joystick back. The brake pressure is increased by the amount of
time that the key (or space bar) or joystick is pressed.

Strategies
1. To determine the optimum route from the beginning to end of the course
   route.
2. To judge the appropriate speed for corners and oncoming traffic while
   maintaining a competitive time record.
3. To make it through the course without any accidents at a better speed than
   your opponents.
4. To study your map to learn street names and other landmarks.
5. To refer to onscrean navigational aids to keep you on course.

Your optimum driving strategy will also depend on traffic. Be careful to obey
traffic laws. At Rookie and Pro skill levels the police are always on the
lookout for lawbreakers. If you break a traffic law, you will hear a siren and
see the police car signalling you to pull your car over. Failure to stop your

NOTE:
-----
There are different traffic patterns that vary according to what time of day it
is. Other types of vehicles you might have to drive around are double parked
trucks, semi-trailer trucks, school buses and others. Always remember that
Smokey might be on your tail, just waiting for you to run a red light or exceed
the speed limit. Receiving a ticket will increase your time for the course.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 37

VETTE may result in damage to your car as the police car will try to force you
off the road. Once your car is stopped, the police will hand you a ticket with
the offences indicated. Provided you are not cited for vehicular manslaughter
or evading arrest, you can talk your way out of a ticket by selecting an
excuse, some of which are better than others. If your excuse is accepted, you
are free to drive off. If cited for a traffic offence at Pro level, you will
pay a time penalty in addition to the time spent while waiting for the ticket
to be written.

Scoring
The ten best scores for each course can be recorded by typing your name and
then pressing ENTER. The scores are based on the time it takes you to reach
your destination and the amount of damage to your vehicle.

The Top Ten screen for each course will also display the skill level for each
entry. In addition it will also indicate the number of traffic offences, if
any, and the total time penalty incurred. If you win the race (against either
the computer or a human driver), you will be treated to a "Victory Party" on
Lombard Street!

Collision damage is now determined by what skill level you're driving at, not
what VETTE model. If

NOTE:
-----
Collision damage is determined by the speed and angle of impact and what was
impacted. If you get into an accident with either of the two Callaway models,
the car's performance and handling will suffer due to structural and mechanical
damage. You will receive added time delays because you and your car will have
to recover, Be careful - crashes can be fatal!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 38

you're lucky enough to find a petrol station, you can get your car repaired by
pulling into the station and stopping between the building and the gas pumps.
To determine the damage to your VETTE, press D for damage indicator. The
indicator will highlight any mechanical failures and their severity with the
following symbols: yellow diamond for minor damage, yellow circle for moderate
damage, red asterisk for serious damage and flashing red asterisk for critical
damage. When your car is totally ruined, the damage indicator will show
flashing red asterisk for the entire car.

Driver's Checklist
1. Select the correct car for the course and opponent.
2. Start off in the right gear.
3. Practise racing the course before the race.
4. Know the course objective (and the alternate routes).
5. Know the landmarks along the way and study the maps.
6. Understand how the selected VETTE! handles.
7. Know how to avoid unexpected driving hazards, such as obstacles, police, etc
8. Have fun!

7 TROUBLESHOOTING

How can I play VETTE! against another person?
You can play head-to-head in two ways: direct connect or using a modem. If you
connect two computers together directly, a null-modem serial cable must be
connected to each computer's serial port. The null-modem serial cable must have
pins 2 and 3 switched and the pin for the ground must be straight through. If
you're connecting two computers over phone lines, you need two 1200 baud (or
faster) Hayes-compatible modems.

9 GLOSSARY

Aspect ratio -
generally the ratio between two dimensions of an object. In tyre terminology it
applies to the unloaded sidewall height of the tyre divided by its overall
width. A lower aspect ratio implies a shorter, wider tyre.

Bore -
the diameter of a cylinder.

Brake torquing -
a procedure generally used in performance tests to improve the off-the-line
acceleration of a car equipped with an automatic transmission. It is executed
by firmly depressing the brake with a left foot, applying the throttle with the
car in gear to increase engine rpm, then releasing the brakes. Brake torquing
is particularly effective with turbo-charged cars because it helps overcome
turbo lag.

Chassis -
a general term that refers to all of the  mechanical parts of a car attached to
a structural frame. In cars with unitized construction, the chassis comprises
everything but the body.

Compression ratio -
the ratio between the combined volume of a cylinder and a combustion chamber
when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the volume when the piston
is at the top of its stroke. The higher the compression ratio, the more
mechanical energy an engine can squeeze from its air-fuel mixture. Higher
compression ratios, however, also make detonation more likely.

Crankshaft -
a shaft with one or more cranks, or "throws", that are coupled by connecting
rods to the engine's pistons. Together, the crankshaft and the con rods
transform the pistons' reciprocating motion into rotary motion.

Cylinder -
the round, straight-sided cavity in which the pistons move up and down.
Typically the cylinder is made of cast iron and formed as part of the block.

Cylinder head -
the aluminium or iron casting that houses the combustion chambers, the intake
and exhaust ports, and much or all of the valvetrain. The head (or heads, if an
engine has more than one bank of cylinders) is always directly above the
cylinders.

Cylinder liner -
the circular housing that the piston moves in when the cylinder is not an
integral part of the block. Also known as a "sleeve".

Differential -
a special gearbox designed so that the torque fed into it is split and
delivered to two outputs that can turn at different speeds. Differentials

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 48

within axels are designed to split torque evently; however, when used between
the front and rear axels in four-wheel drive systems (a centre differential),
they can be designed to apportion torque unevenly.

Disc brakes -
properly called caliper disc brakes, a type of brake that consists of a disc
that rotates at wheel speed, straddled by a caliper that can squeeze the
surfaces of the disc near the edge.

Driveability -
the general qualitative evaluation of a powertrain's operating qualities,
including idle smoothness, cold and hot starting, throttle response. power
delivery, and tolerance for altitude changes.

Fibreglass -
a composite material that relies on small glass fibres for its strength.

Final-drive-ratio -
the reduction ratio, found in the gearset of a drivetrain, that is furthest
removed from the engine. Typically, the differential ratio.

Fuel injection -
any system that meters fuel to an engine by measuring its needs and then
regulating the fuel flow, by electronic or mechanical means, through a pump or
injectors.

G -
the unit of measure for lateral acceleration, or roadholding. One g is
equivalent to 32.2 feet per second.

Gearset -
a group of two or more gears used to transmit power.

Handling -
a general term covering all the aspects of a car's behaviour that are related
to its directional control.

Horsepower -
the common unit of measurement of an engine's power. One horsepower equals 550
footpounds per second, the power needed to lift 550 pounds one foot off the
ground in one second or one pound 550 feet in the same time.

Instruments -
the displays on the dashboard that communicate information about the mechanical
operations of the car.

Lockup -
the juncture at which a tyre starts to skid during braking.

Neutral steer -
a cornering comdition in which the front and rear slip angles are roughly the
same.

On-centre feel -
the responsiveness and feel of the steering when the wheel is approximately on
centre.

Power -
the rate at which work is performed. The power is proportionate to torque and
rpm and is measured in horsepower.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PAGE 49

Push -
a slang term for understeer.

Roadholding -
the ability of the car to grip the pavement.

Series (tyre) -
the numerical expression of a tyre's aspect ratio.

Skidpad -
a large area of smooth, flat pavement used for various handling tests.

Torque -
the rotational equivalent of force, measured in pound-feet.

Turn-in -
the moment of transition between driving straight ahead and cornering.

Understeer -
a handling condition in which the slip angle of the front tyres is greater than
the slip angle of the rears. Also referred to as PUSH.
