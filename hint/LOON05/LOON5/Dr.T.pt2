Track Merge 
~~~~~~~~~~~
Pressing  the  BACKSLASH  (\) key, just to the right of RETURN, selects the
Track  merge  option.   This  is  used to combine two or more tracks tnto a
single track, which can simplify the editing of tracks that are on the same
MIDl channel, and frees up tracks for further recording.

When  this  option is selected, the message line will prompt you for a list
of tracks to be merged; select the tracks with the mouse or the track keys,
and  press  RETURN.   Each track in the list will be merged with the lowest
track, and then erased.

ALlGN 
~~~~~
The  sequencer's ALIGN feature is used during recording to force the length
of  track 1 to a whole number of measures.  If ALIGN is off while recording
track  1,  recording stops as soon as the sequencer is stopped, so the last
measure  of  the  track  may be less than 96 steps (or whatever the current
measure  length  is),  and the sequencer will loop unevenly.  When ALIGN is
on,  the  sequencer  will  continue  to record to the beginning of the next
measure  after  recording  is stopped.  ALIGN is turned on and off with the
DELETE key.

Since  track  1  sets  the  length  of all tracks, ALlGN has no effect when
recording tracks other than track 1.

Hidden Controls 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There  are  a  number of other controls which can only be accessed from the
keyboard.   Most  can also be set from the SET OPTIONS screen, which can be
reached  directly  from  the play/record screen by pressing 0 (ZERO) on the
computer's  typewriter  keyboard.   See the SET OPTIONS chapter for more on
these  controls.   The  HELP  key  and this manual's appendix also list the
hidden control keys.

When  a  hidden  control  is changed from the play/record screen, a message
confirming the change will appear on the message line.  Hidden controls can
be changed while the sequencer is playing or recording.

AUTO-RECORD is selecled with the | (SHIFT-BACKSLASH) key.  When this switch
is  turned  off the RECORD switch will turn on when it finishes recording a
track.  AUTO-RECORD is normally on.

The visible metronome can be turned on or off with the $ (SHIFT-4) key, and
the audible metronome is toggled with the % (SHIFT-5) key.  The & (SHIFT-7)
key disables the step display in the measure/step counter.

Track  looping  is  turned on or off with the ( (LEFT PARENTHESIS) key, and
FILTER  is  toggled with the ) (RIGHT PARENTHESIS) key.  The filter channel
is a changed with the PLUS (SHIFT-EQUAL) and UNDERSCORE (SHIFT-MINUS) keys.
SILENT  PUNCH  is turned on or off with the MINUS (-) key.  TEMPO CHANGE BY
RATIO is toggled between one BPM and 2.5% by pressing the ^ (SHIFT-6) key.

A  few  hidden  controls are not duplicated on the SET OPTIONS screen.  The
PANIC BUTTON (the ~ key, or SHIFT-ACCENT) sends an All Notes Off message on
all  16  MIDI  channels  as  well  as sustain pedal off and zero pitch bend
messages for the appropriaate channels.  Pressing # (SHIFT-3) will mute all
tracks and pressing @ (SHIFT-2) wills unmute all tracks regardless of their
current  statuses.   Finally, the !  (SHIFT-1) key brings up the ALL TRACKS
TO SEQ edit window, which is described in detail in Chapter 4.

Track Shift, Swap, and Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function  keys  Fll through F16 are used to select the SHIFT track options.
The  SHIFT  options  are used to shift a track forward or backward in time,
relative  to  the  other tracks.  The shift amounts are + 1, + 3, + 12, -1,
-3,  and  -12  for  keys F11- F16.  (Remember, function keys Fll to F20 are
selected by pressing SHIFT and a function key from Fl to F10.)

The  DELETE key can be used to toggle between a positive and negative shift
amount  when  a  SHIFT option is active.  Note that since the DELETE key is
normally  used to toggle ALIGN, the ALIGN feature can not be changed when a
SHIFT option is active.

The  program cannot shift a track if its first event would be placed before
the  start  of  the track, which means that negative shift values cannot be
used  on  tracks  which  start  on the first beat.  Nor will events shifted
beyond  the  end  of  track 1 be phayed.  Shifting a track changes the time
value  of  the  first event in the track by adding or subtracting the shift
amoumt,  and  this  change  will be reflected in the event list on the edit
screen.   The TIME value for the first event of the track will be displayed
in  the  right  part  of  the  message  line  whenever a SHIFT operation is
performed.

You should be careful to turn SHIFT off by clicking on the MUTE button when
you  are  done  shifting  tracks,  as  we  have  found  that  it is easy to
accidentlly mess up a track by shifting it when you really want to mute it.

SWAP  is  activated by pressing F18.  The SWAP track option is used to swap
the  position of two tracks in the track display.  Since notes on the lower
numbered  tracks  are  played  before  notes  on the higher tracks swapping
tracks  can  be  used  to correct for minor timing problems caused Eyb MIDI
bandwidth  limitations  or  differences  in instrument response times.  See
Chapter 13 for more on sequencer timing.

When  the NAME track option is selected with the F20 key, selecting a track
will allow you to enter a name for that track.  The input from the keyboard
is not parsed (interpreted) as it is entered, so the BACKSPACE, DELETE, and
similar  keys  will  insert funky graphics symbols in the name, rather than
performing  the  expected operations.  Typing mktakes can be corrected from
the edit screen.

MIDI Song Pointer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a MIDI song pointer message is received while in Track mode, the program
will  start all tracks from the specifed point.  Song pointer messages will
be  ignored  if  the clock source, on the SET OPTIONS screen, is not set to
MIDI  WITH  SONG  POINTER.   The correct time value will be inserted at the
beginning  of  any  track  that is recorded after a song pointer message is
received.

Song  pointer is sent by the sequencer at the beginning of the cue loop, if
cueing is activated and if SONG POINTER SEND has been enabled, as described
in Chapter 11.

Countin
~~~~~~~
If  a countin has been set on the SET OPTIONS screen the program, will wait
for  the programmed number of steps before starting to play or record.  For
example,  a  value  of 96 will create a one measure countin.  The metronone
will sound and MIDI clock will be sent during the countin.

Velocity Pedal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  velocity  pedal  feature  of  the KCS allows you to modify the note on
velocities of a part being recorded with a continuous controller.  This can
be  used,  for  example, to play accents on synths which recognize velocity
but  don't  send  it,  or  to do a MIDI mixdown on a synth which recognizes
velocity but not volume control.  In conjunction with the live edit feature
described  later  in  this  chapter  or  the  loopback  recording technique
discussed  in  Chapter  13,  the  velocity  pedal  can  be  used  to affect
velocities of previously recorded tracks or sequences as well.

When  velocity  pedal is active, all continuous controllers on the velocity
pedal  channel  (which  is  set  from  the SET OPTIONS screen only) will be
combined with the note velocities of the incoming MIDI data in one of three
ways.   The three velocity pedal modes are selected with the F19 (SHIFT-F9)
key,  which  is  also  used to turn the velocity pedal on or off.  When the
velocity pedal is on, control changes on the velocity pedal channel are not
recorded  or merged by the program.  Pitch bend and aftertouch are not used
for the velocity pedal.

Pressing  F19  once selects the FULL velocity pedal mode, where the note on
velocities  are  simply  replaced  with the last controller value received.
FULL  is  most  useful  when recording a part from a non-velocity sensitive
keyboard,  which  is  played on a velocity sensitive slave.  A mod wheel or
foot  pedal  can  be  used  to  set  the  not  velocity  between 1 and 127,
regardless of how hard you strike the keys.

MIX  averages  the  last controller value received with the velocity of the
note.   This  is  most  useful  for  making  minor  changes in a previously
recorded track using live edit or loopback recording.

SCALE  combines the last controller value and the note velocities in such a
way that the controller has more effect at the top and bottom of its range,
but  very  little near the middle.  For example, if the controaler is at or
near  1,  the  recorded velocities will be at or near 1, no matter how hard
the  keys  are  struck.   If the controller is at or near 127, the recorded
velocities  will be at or near 127.  BUT, if the controller is near 64 (the
center  of its range), the recorded velocities will be determined mostly by
the  note  velocities  sent by the keybeard.  SCALE is best suited to major
editing  on  prerecorded  tracks  or  sequences using live edit or loopback
recordmg.

Note  that  the velocity pedal channel, on the SET OPTIONS screen, need not
be  set to the channel that the keyboard or receiving synth is on, but must
be  set  to  the channel of the device with the continuous controller beung
used.

Live Edit 
~~~~~~~~~
Live edit is an advanced feature of the Keyboard Controlled Sequencer which
allows  you  to delete notes from a track or alter their velocities in real
time,  as  the  sequencer  is  playing.   Since  live  edit  is  much  more
complicated  than  the  other features of Track mode, we recommend that you
become thoroughly familiar with the rest of the KCS before diving into live
editing.

Live  edit  is activated by selecting the EDIT SELECT track option with the
F17  (SHIFT-F7)  key.   When  this option is selected the words EDIT SELECT
will  appear  in  the  message line, and the PUNCH buttons will be replaced
with  a  set  of  EDIT buttons.  The edit buttons are used to handle backup
tracks and to turn live editing off and the ALTERNATE CONTROL, and LEFT and
RIGHT SHIFT keys are used to edit the selected track.

When  a  track is selected, the word EDIT will appear in its status display
and a backup track will be created in the first available track.  The track
can now be edited with the keys mentioned earlier.

RIGHT SHIFT will delete notes that play while it is held down, by replacing
them with DE events.

ALTERNATE  will replace note velocities with velocity value Y from the step
time  record  screen,  which  defaults to 127.  If one of the true velocity
pedal  options is selected, pressing ALTERNATE will set the note velocities
from the velocity pedal.

LEFT  SHIFT  will  replace  note velocities with step time velocity value W
(default 64).

ALTERNATE  plus  LEFT  SHIFT  will  replace  note velocities with step time
velocity value U (default 16).

CONTROL  will  replace  notes in the edit track with notes from, the backup
track.   Normally, this acts as an "undo" command but can also be used as a
compositional  device  if the backup track is changed from the edit screen.
For  instance,  if  the  backup  is  transposed up an octave, then pressing
CONTROL  will  have the effect of transposing notes up an octave when it is
pressed.

The  edit  buttons are used to manage the current edit track's backup tract
and  to  disable  or  exit from live edit.  Clicking on an edit button will
affect only the currently selected edit track.

The BACKUP button will replace the backup track with the edited track.  Use
this  only  when  you  are satisfied with any editing you have done, and be
careful, as the original track will be lost when this button is pressed.

RESTORE  is  the  opposite  of BACKUP.  It replaces the edid track with its
backup  track.   Use  this  when  you  make  catastrophic  mistakes in your
editing.

DONE  changes the status of the track from EDIT to PLAY, and turns off live
editing  for  that  track.   The  backup  track  can be deleted as well, if
desired.   Clicking  on  DONE  again will replace the edit buttons with the
punch buttons; pressing the * (SHIFT-8) key has the same effect.

OFF  temporarily  disables the editing keys, without turning live edit off.
This  allows  you to select functions which require the SHIFT keys, such as
velocity  pedal  or certain track options.  Note that OFF doesn't turn live
editing off - that is done with the DONE button.

                            Chapter 7
                            ~~~~~~~~~
                      OPEN MODE PLAY/RECORD
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open  mode  is  the  Keyboard Controlled Sequencer's generalized sequencing
mode.   In  Open  mode, you can define up to 128 independent sequences, any
number of whdch may be played back simultaneously.  These may be completely
independent  of each other, or some sequences may include commands to start
and  stop  other  sequences.   A  sequence  which  starts  or stops another
sequence  is  called  a  control  sequence.   By chaining control sequences
together,  you  can  realize  very  complex  pieces  of  music.   Chapter 4
describes how you can create control sequences using the edit screen.

There  are  two  types  of  sequences:   primary  and  secondary.   Primary
sequences  are  designated  by the numbers 1 - 9 and the letters A - Z, and
are  activated from the Open mode play screen by pressing the corresponding
key  on the typewriter keyboard.  Secondary sequences are designated by the
two  digit  numbers  00  -  92.  They are activated from the Open mode play
screen  by  typing two digts on the numeric keypad on the right side of the
computer keyboard.

Play/Record Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Entering  Open  mode  from  either the Track or Song mode edit screens will
place  you on the Open mode edit screen.  The play/record screen is entered
by  double  clicking  the  right  mouse  button,  by  clicking  on PLAY and
selecting  GO  TO PLAY SCREEN, or by single clicking the ri@ht mouse button
while  holding  down  the  SHIFT key.  The program uses the same screen for
both play and record operations.

An  important  difference between Open mode and Track mode is that going to
the  Open  mode play screen does not automatically allow you to record.  To
record in Open mode, you must eiiher select the RECORD option from the edit
screen,  or  activate  Open  mode real time recording from the play screen.
This procedure is described in detail later in this chapter.

The Open mode play/record screen looks like this:

The  play  screen consists of two areas:  the sequence area at the top, and
the  status lines at the bottom of the screen.  The sequence area shows the
status  of  the  35 primary sequences and the first 45 secondary sequences.
(The  remaining secondary sequences can be played from this screen as well,
but  no  status information is shown for these sequences.) Four consecutive
sequences  are  displayed  on  each  lime.   The P, F and W columns contain
information  concerning  the  status  of  each  sequence.  The S (Sequence)
column contains the designator for each of the 80 sequences displayed.  The
RE  (REpeats)  column  shows  the  number  of  repeats  programmed for each
sequence.   A  99  in  the  RE  column  means  that  the sequence will loop
indefinitely.   NAME  shows the name of each sequence.  The P (Play) column
shows the number of times each sequence has left to play and counts down as
each  repitition  of  the  sequence occurs.  A 9 will be displayed in the P
column  if  that  sequence  has  nine  or more repeats left to play.  The F
(From)  colunn  contains  the letter or number of the control sequence that
started the sequence.  This field is blank if the sequence was started from
the  computer  keyboard.   A  W  in  the W (Wait) column indicates that the
sequence  is  currently  waiting  for  another sequence to finish, and an M
means the sequence is currently muted.

The  status  lines  at  the  bottom of the screen display information about
various  record and play options and also show the measue/step counter, the
real time clock and the clock source or tempo.  The words RECORD, CUE, MIDI
MERGE, PAUSE, etc.  will appear on the status lines when these features are
activated  and dissappear from the status lines when they are de-actavated.
The current cue point and cue sequence are also shown.

CLOCK, Metronome and Measure/Step Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cunrent clock source is displayed next to the word CLOCK on the next to
last  line.   This  will  be  the current clock rate in beats/minute if the
internal  clock  display  is  being  used, MIDI if MIDI clock is being used
without  song pointer, or MIDI WITH SP if MIDI clock is bemg used with song
pointer.

If  the internal clock is in use, the clock rate can be changed during play
by  using the COMMA (,) key to increase the tempo, or the PERIOD (.) key to
decrease  the  tempo.   The  clock  rate  can also be changed from within a
sequence  using  TM,  AC,  or  DC  events,  or from the SET OPTIONS screen,
described  in Chapter 11.  The SET OPTIONS screen is the only way to change
the clock source.

The  measure/step  counter  displays  the  current  measure  and step being
played.   It  will  be  reset  to  measure  1 if you press UNDO to stop all
sequences  or  CLR  HOME to erase the current recording.  It will be set to
the  cue  or  song  pointer  location  if you start a cue or a song pointer
message is received.

The  program provides both a visible and an audible metronome.  The visible
metronome  appears  in  the  bottom,  right hand corner of the screen.  The
audible  metronome  can  be heard through the speaker of your monitor.  The
separation  between metronome clicks can be programmed from the SET OPTIONS
screen.

Playing Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Primary sequences 1 - 9 and A - X are started by pressing a key on the
typewriter keyboard, and secondary sequences 00 - 92 can be started by
typing a two digit number on the numeric keypad. (Primary sequence 1 - 9
cannot be started from the numeric keyboard, nor can secondary sequences be
started from the typewriter keyboard.) If ALIGN is turned off, the sequence
will start immediately; otherwise it will wait for the beginning of the
next measure and then start.

The  numeric  keypad also has a "bank lock" feature, which allows selecting
any  secondary  sequence from within a bank of ten sequences using a single
key.   Pressing  the  ASTERISK (*) key on the numeric keypad after entering
one  or  both  digits of a secondary sequence will lock the 10's place (the
first  digit)  of  that  number,  and subsequent numeric keypad digits will
immediately  start  the  appropriate  sequence  in  the bank.  For example,
pressing  on  the numeric keypad after pressing 1 will lock the 1 in as the
first  digit of the secondary sequence, and pressing numeric keys 2, 3, and
4  will start sequences 12, 13, and 14.  Bank lock is turned off with the (
(LEFT  PARENTHESIS)  key  on the numeric keypad.  The most recently started
secondary  sequence  is  displayed in the lower right corner of the screen,
which  is  helpful  when  you are using the bank lock feature, and the word
BANK will appear beside the sequence number if bank lock is turned on.

Normally,  the  sequence will play for the programmed number of repeats and
stop.   To stop a sequence from, looping press the appropriate sequence key
or  numeric keypad number once.  The sequence will play to the end and then
stop.   To  stop  a  sequence immediately, press the sequence key or number
twice if it is looping, or once if it is in its last play.  To play several
sequences  at  once, press the ESC key to put the program into pause, start
the sequences, then press ESC again.

Muting Primary Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To  mute  any primary sequence that is playing press SHIFT and the sequence
key simultaneously.  An M will appear under the W heading for the sequence.
The  sequence  will  continue  to keep time, but no events will be sounded.
Notes  currently  playing  will  be  shut off unless they were defined with
separate  ON  and OFF events.  Such notes will stick until Fl, UNDO, or the
PANIC BUTTON is pressed.

To  unmute  a sequence, press the sequence key again (no SHIFIt this time).
The  M  will  disappear  and  the sequence will resume sounding at the same
point  it  would  have been at, had the mute feature not been invoked.  Use
mute  to  cue  in and out multiple overdubs in real time, or to isolate and
listen to individual sequences.

Secondary  sequences cannot be muted from the Open mode play screen, though
they can be muted and unmuted with MS and US events.

Cancel  
~~~~~~
Pressing  the  UNDO key will canccl, or stop, all active sequences, and set
the measure counter to 0.  If you are currently recording it will erase the
recorded  sequence and allow you to start recording again.  Cancel will not
erase  a  sequence  which  you  recorded earlier in the current play/record
session.

Pause 
~~~~~
The  ESC  key  can  be  used  as  a pause button during playback or record.
Pressing ESC shuts off any notes being played and stops the internal clock,
or  if MIDI clock is being used, all clocks will be ignored until the pause
button  is pressed again.  The word PAUSE is displayed on the middle status
line until it is deactivated or you leave the play/record screen.

Notes  played  on  the  keyboard are not recorded when paused, but the last
controller  of each type played is recorded, if the CONTROLLER PAUSE switch
is active on the SET OPTIONS screen.  See Chapter 11 for more details.

Cueing  
~~~~~~
The TAB key activates the cue feature.  Each time you press the TAB key the
cue  sequence  will begin playing from the cue point.  Program changes that
occur  earlier  in  the  cue  sequence will be sent over MIDI, and sequence
start events and tempo changes will be executed.

The  cue  sequence  is  set  from  the play options dialog box described in
Chapter  4.   It  can also be changed from the play/record screen using the
left  and right cursor control keys.  The CURSOR LEFT key decreases the cue
sequence  by  one,  and  the CURSOR RIGHT key increases the cue sequence by
one.

The  cue  point  determines  where phayback will begin in the cue sequence.
This  also can bm set from the play options dialog box and changed from the
play/record  screen using the CURSOR UP and CURSOR DOWN keys and the INSERT
key.  The up arrow moves the cue point higher, the down arrow moves the cue
point lower, and INSERT tnggles the amount that the cue point moves between
one measure and eight measures.

The  cue  feature is particularly useful when the cue sequence is a control
sequence  that  plays  an  entire piece.  You can use cue to hear the piece
starting from any point.  By keeping alternate arrangemems of your songs on
consecutive  sequence  keys,  you can quickly go back and forth between the
same pmint of different arrangements of a piece with the cursor keys.

Align  
~~~~~
When  activated, ALlGN forces the program to wait till the end of a measure
before  exiting  the record mode.  This assures that all sequences recorded
will  loop properly.  ALIGN also forces all sequences that are started from
the  computer  keyboard  to  wait  until  the beginning of the next measure
before playing.

ALlGN  is  normally  on  when  recording,  and  off  when  in  play and not
recording.  It can be toggled on or off with the DELETE key.

MIDI Merge 
~~~~~~~~~~
MIDI  MERGE  is  activated by pressing the SEMICOLON (:) key.  All incoming
MIDI  data, including system exclusive messages received by the computer is
merged  with  the  sequence  data  being played.  Press the :  key again to
de-activate MIDI merging.  MIDI mergng is disabled when ECHO is on.

Echo  
~~~~
The  ECHO feature is used to rechannelize MIDI data recorded by the program
and  send it out the computer's MIDI out.  This allows you to record on any
channel  while  using  a  keyboard  controller  that  transmits on a single
channel.  If ECHO is active, the word ECHO will appear on the bottom of the
screen,  followed  by  the  echo channel.  You can use the BACKSPACE key to
toggle  echoing on and off from the play/record screen, and use the > and <
(SHIFT-PERIOD  and  SHIFT-COMMA)  keys  to  increase  or  dccrease the echo
channel.

Filter  
~~~~~~
FILTER  is  used  to  force  the  sequencer to accept MIDI data on only one
channel,  the  filter channel.  Incoming data on other channels as ignored.
FILTER  is  turned  on  with  the ) (RIGHT PARENTHESIS) key, and the filter
channel  can be lowered or raised with the UNDERSCORE (SHIFT-MINUS) or PLUS
( + ) keys respectively.

Set Options and Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  SET  OPTIONS  screen  can be reached directly from, the Open mode play
screen  by  pressing the 0 (ZERO) key.  The SET OPTIONS screen is described
in Chapter 11.

Pressing  the HELP key will bring up the Open mode help screen, which shows
the  functions  of  each  key on the computer keyboard in Open mode.  These
functions are also summarized in the Appendix to this manual.

Exit 
~~~~
Pressing  F1  will  immediately  end  the  play/record process and take you
dirctly to the edit screen.  The left mouse button duplicates this function
in Open mode.

Panic Button 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pressing  the  ~ (SHIFT-ACCENT) key will send All Notes Off messages on all
16  MIDI  channels.   This  is  useful  for  canceling  stuck  notes on any
synthesizers  that,  for  one reason or another, did not receive a note off
message.   The  All Notes Off message is not recognized by all instruments,
so this button may not always clear all stuck notes.  The panic button also
clears  any  sustain  pedal  or pitch bend settings that may have been left
"hanging".

Recording in Open Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open mode recording can be selected in one of two ways.  Clicking on RECORD
from  the  Open  mode edit screen will bring up an edit window which allows
you  to  select  one  of  four recording methods, or pressing the RETURN or
ENTER  keys on the Open mode 1 play screen will enable real time recording.
Generally  speaking  selecting  RECORD  from  the edit screen provides more
flexibility  in  recording while the RETURN/ENTER method is more convenient
if you are playing an Open mode sequence and want to record a part whenever
inspiration  strikes.   Real  time  recording  is  described  later  in the
chapter.

When you select RECORD from, the edit screen, an edit window will ask which
sequence you want to record, and will also present a set of record options.
The  sequence  will  default to the next empty sequence, or you can enter a
sequence.   Enter  one  key  for  a  primary  sequence  or two digits for a
secondary  sequence.   Remember  that  sequences  Y  and Z are reserved for
internal use by the program and cannot be recorded.

Four  record options are displayed in the left part of the edit window, one
of which must ge selected.  STEP TIME allows you to create a sequence using
a  method similar to step mode entry on a drum machine.  Step time entry is
useful  for  entering fast arpeggios, regular chord patterns or other parts
with  few changes in note to note timiing.  The step time recording process
is described in detail in Chapter 9.

REAL  TIME  records  events from the synthesizer keyboard in real time.  In
this mode the program is similar to a tape recorder, recording all notes as
you play.  OVERDUB will automatically play the overdub sequence and set the
length  of  the  current  sequence  to  match  that of the sequence you are
overdubbing  to.  You must select an existing sequence to overdub to if you
choose OVERDUB.  RECORD WITH CUE is another way to record a new sequence in
sync  with  an  existing sequence.  RECORD WITH CUE differs from OVERDUB in
that  the  existing  sequence  may  be  started  at  any  measure.   It  is
particularly  useful  when the existing sequence is a partly completed song
that  you  want  to  add  parts  to in specific places.  You must select an
existing sequence to be the cue sequence.  The real time record options are
described in detail later in this chapter.

Controllers, Aftertouch, Note Off Vel, and Echo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These   record   options  set  the  sequencer  to  record  or  ignore  MIDI
controllers,  aftertouch,  and  note  off  (release) velocity.  CONTROLLERS
enables  the recording of pitch bend, control changes, and program changes.
If  a pitch bend or sustain pedal (MIDI controller 64) event is recorded, a
zero  pitch  bend or sustain pedal off message will be placed at the end of
the  recording.  AFTERTOUCH controls the recording of aftertouch (pressure)
information.  Since aftertouch and controller data use such large chunks of
memory, it is best to disable CONTROLLERS and AFTERTOUCH uless specifically
required.

NOTE OFF VEL allows separate storage of note off events, including note off
velocity.   There  are  only  a few synths capable of sending and receiving
note  off  velocity.   Notes  recorded  with note on velocity are stored as
separate  note on and note off events, and are more difficult to edit.  The
KCS  can  only  remember  to hold down 64 notes (on all synths) at one time
using  ON  events,  so  if you need more than that, you need to record some
parts with note off velocity.

The  letters  C A O will appear beside RECORD on the play/record screen if
any  of these options are turned on.  The options can also be turned on and
off  directly  from  the  play/record  screen.   The  COLON (:) key toggles
controllers,  the  QUOTE  (')  key aftertouch, and the DOUBLE QUOTE (") key
note  off velocity.

ECHO  can  also  be toggled from this window.  ECHO is described earlier in
this chapter.

Real Time Record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you  select  the  REAL  TIME,  OVERDUB, or RECORD WITH CUE options, the
play/record  screen will be diplayed.  The only visible differences between
play and record are that the words RECORD and ALIGN appear at the bottom of
the screen along with any other active record options.

The  following  example  shows  the  screen that would appear if your first
action  in  Open mode is to record sequence 2, echoing onto channel 4.  The
number of the sequence being recorded is shown in red on a color monitor.

When  you besn playing on the synth keyboard, the metronoe (bottom right of
screen)  will  begin  flashing  and  the  measure/step  counter  will start
counting  up.  A metronome will also sound on your monitor speaker.  If you
did  not  specify a name, the MIDI channel of the first event recorded will
be  d@splayed  under  NAME.  If you want to begin the sequence with a rest,
press the FlO key.

If,  during  recording you make a mistake and wish to start again press the
UNDO  key.  The current recordLng will be erased and the program will start
recording  again  when  you  play the keyboard or press FlO.  When you have
finished  recording  press  FlO  and  the  sequence will begin playing back
immediately if ALIGN is off or when the measure completes if ALIGN is on.

If  your new sequence is playing back and you decide you don't like it, you
can  erase  it and record again by pressing CLR HOME.  Recording will start
again  when you play the keybeard or press FlO.  Press FlO a second time to
end recording and hear what you just played.
 
All  of  the  play features described earlier in this chapter also function
when recording.  To stop recording and go to the edit screen, press Fl.

As  mentioned  earlier,  real  time recording can also be selected directly
from  the  Open  mode  play screen by pressing the RETURN or ENTER key.  If
RETURN  is  pressed,  recording  will  start  as soon as a note on or other
relevant  MIDI  event  is  received  at  the  MIDI in jack, and if ENTER is
pressed,  recordjng  begins immediately.  The first unused sequence will be
used  for  recording.   Pressing  FlO  will turn recording off and play the
newly recorded sequence, pressing UNDO will erase the current recording and
stop  all  sequences,  and  the  CLR  HOME key will erase the last sequence
recorded in the current session.

Additional  Open  mode  sequences  can  be  recorded in a single real time
recording  session by  pressing either RETURN or ENTER, even if recording
was initiated from the edit screen. This process can be repeated as many
times as needed, to record additonal sequences.

Overdub 
~~~~~~~
The  OVERDUB  option  allows  you  to record a new sequence in sync with an
existing sequence called the overdub sequence which is automatically played
back  by  the prograrn as you record.  You can start the overdub process by
playing  a  note  on  your  synth  or by pressing F10.  In either case, the
overdub sequence will automatically be started and recording will begin.

When the overdub sequence completes, the program will automatically end the
recording  process  and  play  back both sequences together.  If you make a
mistake  during  recording or are dissatisfied after the recording, you can
use  the UNDO or CLR HOME keys to start over, as described above under REAL
TIME RECORD.

Since  the  overdub  sequence  can  be  any Open mode sequence, including a
control  sequence,  It  is possible to overdub a sequence to a section of a
song, or an entire piece.  Overdubbing to a control sequence is done in the
same mamer as overdubbing to any other sequence.

If  you start the overdub sequence with FlO and don't play any notes at all
before  it ends, the overdub sequence will still loop, and the program will
remain in record.  This allows you to listen to your overdub sequence a few
times before recording.

Record with Cue 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
RECORD  WITH  CUE  is  very similar to OVERDUB, but allows you to start the
overdub sequence at any measure.  This is useful for things like adding tom
fills  to  a  section, adding some grace notes to a long piano sequence, or
adding  controllers  to  a piece after the basic arrangement was done.  The
program  will  automatically  insert  the correct amount of time before the
first event.

When  the  RECORD  OPTIONS edit window is displayed, select RECORD WITH CUE
and  then  click  the mouse to OVERDUB/CUE SEQ, and enter a sequence key or
number.  If you select an unused sequence, the program will alert you.  You
can  also  set  a  new cue point at this time.  This will be the measure at
which the program will start the cue sequence.

When  you  get  to  the  play/record  screen the cue sequence and cue point
displays  will reflect the values you entered.  Play a note or press FlO to
start  recording.   The cue sequence will begin playing at the specifed cue
point.  Press FlO when you have completed recording.  Both the cue sequence
and  sequence  you  recorded  will start playing back from the selected cue
point.  You can restart both sequences at any later time by pressing FlO or
TAB.   If  you  make mistakes and want to start over, you can press UNDO if
you  are  still recording or CLR HOME if you have completed recording.  The
program  will  erase  your  recording  and  return  to the beginning of the
recording procedure.

Recording with Velocity Pedal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When  the  VELOCITY PEDAL option has been activated from the SET OPTIONS or
Track  mode  record screens, the sequencer will not directly record note on
velocities,  but  will  instead  record values based on the position of any
continuous  controllers  on the velocity pedal channel.  The velocity pedal
function cannot be accessed from the Open mode play/record screen.  See the
chapter  on  the  Track mode play/record screen for more information on the
velocity pedal.

Recording with a Countin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You  can use the SET OPTIONS screen to set a recoring countin.  This allows
you  to  use the metronome or an external MIDI drum machine to get the feel
for  a  few  beats before recording.  If you are using a countin, press F10
when  you  are  ready  to  record  or  overdub.  The program will sound the
metronome and send MIDI clock, but it will not start recording or start the
overdub  sequence  until the number of steps specified for the countin have
passed.

MIDI Song Pointer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  the  MIDI  W SONG POINTER clock sourse option was selected from the SET
OPTIONS screen, and the program receives a MIDI song pointer message during
Open  mode  play,  the program will turn on all active sequences, and start
the  current  cue  sequence  at  the  point  specified  by the song pointer
message.   The  only  MIDI  events  that  will be sent while the program is
chasing  the  song  pointer are program changes.  It may take a few seconds
for the program to chase many measures into a complex piece, and songs with
a  lot  of  continuous controller data will take a little longer than other
songs.

Recording with song pointer is similar to recording with cue.  If the clock
source  has  been set to MIDI WITH SONG POINTER, and the program receives a
song  pointer  message,  the  cue  sequence will be started at the location
specifed  by  the  song  pointer  message,  and recording will begin.  If a
second  song  pointer message is received, and no notes have been recorded,
the program will start the record process again.

If  a  second  song  pointer message is receeved after some notes have been
recorded,  the  program  will  end  recording  and  play  back both the cue
sequence  and  the  newly  recorded  sequence, starting at the song pointer
location.  You can still use CLR HOME to erase the new sequence and restart
the recording process.

                              Chapter 8
                              ~~~~~~~~~
                           Song Mode Play
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Song mode play screen allows you to play songs created on the song mode
edit  screen described in Chapter 5.  You cannot record while in Song mode.
The  Song mode pIay screen is reached from the Song edit screen by clicking
on PLAY or pressing the right mouse button.

The following example shows the Song mode play screen as it might look
before a song is started:

The  Song  mode play screen has severl sections.  The top line has the song
number and title.  The bottom of the screen is used for status lines, as in
Open and Track modes.  Most of the rest of the screen is used for a list of
up  to  48 song segments.  A song can have up to 100 segments, but only the
first  48  can  be  seen on the play screen.  Each song segment shown has a
number  ,  and a segment key.  The segment keys are used to select segments
much  like  track  keys  can  be  used  to  select  tracks  in  Track mode.
Typewriter  keys 1 - 9 are used for segments 1 - 9, keys A - Z for segments
10  -  35,  and  keys on the numeric keypad for segments 36 - 48.  There is
also a set of segment/channel options, seleted with the function keys which
determine how the song is affected by selecting a segment.

Each  segment  plays  a  single  Open mode sequence.  The sequence key (for
primary sequences) or a two digit sequence number (for secondary sequences)
is  shown  in  the  SQ  column.  The sequence name is displayed in the NAME
column,  and the number of times the segment is to play is shown under REP.
Other information will appear in the REP column as the song is played.

The  right  edge of the screen displays the status of the 16 MIDI channels.
Each  channel  has  a channel number and a corresponding key (1 - 9 and A -
G).   Channels  can be soloed and muted, in the same way that tracks are in
Track mode.

Playing the Song
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  song  is  started  by pressing FlO or clicking the right mouse button.
When  play  starts,  the  measure/step  counter  starts to count, and a red
musical  note  will  appear  in  the REP column for segment 1.  This symbol
indicates  the  segment currently playing.  If the segment is programmed to
play  more  than  once,  the number in the REP column will count down as it
plays.

PAUSE and MIDI MERGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Song can be paused at any point by pressing the ESC key; pressing ESC a
second  time lets the song continue.  MIDI merging can be toggled using the
SEMICOLON  (;)  key.   PAUSE or MIDI MERGE will appear in red on the status
line if either of these functions are active.

See  the  chapters  on  the Track and Open mode play screens for details on
PAUSE and MIDI MERGE.

Cueing and Single Segment Looping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A  song may also be started at an arbitrary cue point, just as in Track and
Open modes.  Pressing the TAB key stacts the song at the current cue point.
The  cue  point is moved forward or backward using the CURSOR UP and CURSOR
DOWN  keys,  and the cue point move amount is toggled between one and eight
measures  with the INSERT key.  See the chapters on the Track and Open mode
play screens for more details on cueing.

The F2 key will cause the current segment to loop indeinitely.  99L appears
under  REF to show looping, Pressing F2 again will cause the segment to end
after its current play.

Segment/Channel Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Song mode provides seven segment/channel options channel which allow you to
alter the playback of a song just as the track options discussed in Chapter
6  allow you to alter the playbach of individual tracks.  These options can
assist  you  in  composition by allowing you to hear sections of a piece in
different  contexts  and  instrunents  in different combinations.  They can
also be used to provide real time control in performance.

The  current segment or channel option is selected with one of the function
keys  F3  -  F9.   Pressing a segment or channel key will cause the current
option  to  be  applied  to  the  corresponding  segment  or  channel.  The
segment/channel   options  are  MUTE/UNMUTE,  PLAY  IMMEDIATE,  PLAY  AFTER
CURRENT, SET LOOP START, SET LOOP END, SOLO, and SET SWITCH.

The   MUTE/UNMUTE,  SOLO,  and  SET  SWITCH  options  are  similar  to  the
corresponding  options  in  Track  mode,  but  they  apply to MIDI channels
instead of tracks.  The PLAY IMMEDIATE, PLAY AFTER CURRENT, SET LOOP START,
and SET LOOP END options are unique to Song mode and apply to segments.

The current segment/channel option is displayed on the right end of the top
status line.  The default is PLAY IMMEDIATE, as shown in the screen example
on  the  last  page.   Only one segment option or one channel option may be
active at any time.

MUTE, SOLO and SET SWITCH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The MUTE, SOLO, and SET SWITCH options are very similar
to the corresponding options in Track mode. MUTE is
selected with the F3 key, SOLO with F8, and SET SWITCH with F9. When one of
these options is active, keys 1 - 9 control channels 1 - 9, while keys A -
G control channels 10 - 16.

When  a  channel  is muted, MIDI data for that channel is not sent.  When a
channel  is  soloed,  only  data  for  that channel is sent.  When a switch
between  two  channels is set, the RETURN key alternately mutes one channel
and unmutes the other.  The words MUTE, SOLO, or SWIT will appear next to a
channel which is currently muted or soloed, or for which a switch is in the
process of being set.

See  the  chapter  on the Track mode play screen for more details on muting
soloing or switching.

PLAY IMMEDIATE and PLAY AFTER CURRENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  features allow you to alter the order in which segments as a song is
playing.   When PLAY is active, pressing the segment key for any segment tn
the  song  will  cause  the program to immediately stop playing the current
segment  and  start  the new segment.  The song will then continue normally
from that segment.

PLAY  AFTER CURRENT differs from PLAY IMMEDIATE in that the current segment
is  allowed  to  finish  its  current  repetition before the new segment is
started.   This  is especially useful when altering the structure of a song
in real time with Song mode's interactive control features.

Song Mode Loops  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Song  mode  allows you to set a starting and ending loop point, and to loop
the  song  between  these  points.  The loop points are defined in terms of
segment numbers, not measures.  The SET LOOP START and SET LOOP END Segment
options  allow  you  to  set the starting and ending segments for the loop.
The letters B and E will appear in the REP column next to the beginning and
end segments of the loop as they are set.  Pressing the SLASH (/) key turns
looping  on  and  off.   The  word  LOOP appears on the left end of the top
status line when looping is active.

The  followng  example  shows  the Song mode play screen after a song has been
started, and loop points set:

In  this  example,  a loop has been set up between segments 3 and 5.  Since
looping is actiwe, segments 3, 4, and 5 will play repeatedly until the loop
as  turned off with the / key.  The red musical note indicates that segment
5 is currently playing.

Channels 3 and 5 have been muted.  MIDI events on these channels other than
program  changes  will  be  ignored.   The  segment/channel  option is PLAY
IMMEDIATE.   Pressing  any key in the range 1 - 6 will cause the program to
immediately jump to the beginning of the corresponding segment.

Song Pointer in Song Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the MIDI W SONG POINTER clock option has been selected on the SET
OPTIONS screen, and a song pointer message is received, the program will
start playing the current song from the point specified by the song pointer
message.

Exit

Press Fl or the left mouse button to exit to the Song mode edit screen.

                            Chapter 9
                            ~~~~~~~~~
                       STEP TIME RECORDING
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  step  time  recording  features  of  the  KCS allow you to record note
information  from  your  synthesizer  keyboard,  while  using  the computer
keyboard  or  mouse  to  specify  tuning information.  Note velocity can be
specified  from  either  keyboard.  This can be a faster and more intuitive
way  of  precisely  entering  rhythmically regular passages than the typing
method  described  in  Chapter  4.   It is particularly convenient in Track
mode,  as  the  new  passage  can  be  played  along  with tracks that were
previously recorded.

The  step  time  recording  screen contains fifteen choices fOf note times,
fifteen  choices for note durations and six choices for note velocity.  The
current  choices are indicated by a red asterisk.  As you play notes on the
synth  keyboard  they  are  recorded  with  the current time, duration, and
velocity  values.   Each  choice  is  assigned  to  one  of  the numeric or
alphabitic  keys  shown to the left of the possible values.  You can make a
new  choice  for time, velocity or duration by pressing the appropriate key
on the computer keyboard, or by clicking the mouse on your choice.  The red
asterisk  will  move to display your choice.  If you select a zero velocity
which  is  norally assigned to the Z key the program will record the actual
velocity with which each note is played on your synth.

A new Open mode sequence can be recorded in step time by selecting the STEP
TIME  option  from  the  record dialog box.  A new track can be recorded in
step  time  by  selecting  the  STEP  TIME  TRACK option.  If you pick this
option,  the program will allow you to select the measure at which you will
start  recording.   You can also extend an existing sequence or track using
step  time  record by selecting the STEP TIME APPEND option.  The step time
recording procedure is the same in any case.

The step time record screen is shown below:

The  choices  for  time, duration and velocity are listed in columns, along
with the keys used to select the choices.

The  bottom  line  shows  the  current  measure and step, which will be the
MST-ST  value  for  the  next  note  entered.   The box directly aboxe this
contains  buttons  for  a number of step time recording options, as well as
two edit buttons.

Recording in Step Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once  the  various  record parameters are set up, recording in step time is
simply  a  matter  of  entering  the  notes  for each step from the synth's
keyboard.   Pressing  and releasing a single key puts a single note at that
step; pressing more than one key before any key is released puts a chord at
that  step.   All  notes  played  will  be assigned the chosen duration and
velocity  values.   The  first  note  or  chord will get a time of 0, while
subsequent  notes  get  the  selected  time  value.   The  measure and step
counters will be updated as each note is played.

While recording you can select a new time, duration, or velocity value from
any  of the choices displayed by pressing the key shown next to the desired
value,  or by clicking on the new value with the mouse.  The asterisk moves
next to your choice, and subsequent notes will use the new choice.

If  the  DUR  FOLLOW feature is active, selecting a new time will cause the
program to select a new, proportional duration as well.  This is convenient
when  entering  data with a lot of different time values.  The durations of
the  last  note  or chord entered will also be adjusted to the new value if
DUR FOLLOW is on.  This prevents the previous note from overlapping the new
one  if  the  time  is reduced.  DUR FOLLOW is on when the step time record
screen is first entered, and can be turned on or off with the F4 key.

Changing the Time, Duration and Velocity Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can easily enter time, duration, or velocity values other than the ones
initially  supplied by the program.  While holding the SHIFT key, press the
key  for  the time, duration, or velocity value you vwsh to alter; or place
the  mouse  pointer  on the value to be changed at click both mouse buttons
together.   A  red  !  will appear next to the selected value at the top of
the  screen and the message line will prompt you for a new step time value.
You  may enter up to a three digit number.  If you enter a one or two digit
number  press RETURN.  The new value will appear on the screen, and will be
selected as the current value.

The  fifteen  time  and  duration  values,  as well as the five preset
velocity
levels,   are   stored  along  with  other  sequencer  parameters  in  .ENV
(environment) files, which are described in more detail in the next two
chapters.

Time Chg Delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Normally,  selecting a new time value when entering a step time sequence or
track causes the next note played to get the new time value.  Enabling TIME
CHG  DELAY  causes  the  new  time  value  to  be assigned to the next note
entered, rather than the current note.  This is more naturl when entering a
score from sheet music.  TIME CHG DELAY can be activated with the mouse, or
by  presswing  the  SLASH (/) key.  The default setting for this switch is
offF but intuatively obvious.

Rest, Tie, and Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click  on REST or press the F3 key to insert a rest in your recording.  The
measure and step counters will be increased, and the time value of the next
note  will  be increased by the current time value.  Click on TIE, or press
RETURN  to  enter  a  tie.   This  will  increase the time and also add the
current  time  value  to the duration of the most recently recorded note or
chord.   Clicking  on  DELETE or pressing UNDO will delete the last note or
chord entered.

Play Options  
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  PLAY  OPTIONS  allow  you  to play back part or all of the sequence or
track  being  entered.   Each  option  can  be selected by clicking on that
option, or by pressing a key on the computer's keyboard.

SEQ/TRACK  plays  the  current sequence or track from the beginning and can
also be selected by pressing F6.  24 NOTES and 8 NOTES cause the last 24 or
eight  notes  entered  to  be  played;  the  associated keys are F7 and F8,
respectively.  Play can be stopped with the F1 key or left mouse button, or
restarted with FlO or the right mouse button.

8  BARSS  and 2 BARS, or the F9and FlO keys, let you hear the last eight or
two  bars  of  your recording.  In Open mode, you will hear the sequence in
isolation;  but  in  Track mode, all previously recorded and unmuted tracks
will  also  be  heard.   The  cue point will also be reset if you use these
options in Track mode.  In Open mode, LAST CUE or the TAB key will play the
current  cue sequence from its cue point.  If the current CUE sequence is a
control sequence that plays the sequence being recorded, this allows you to
hear  your  recording  in  context.   In Track mode, LAST CUE will play all
tracks  from  the  current cue point.  You can interrupt or restart play as
described earlier.

Audition Velocity  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you are not sure of the dynamics you wish to use for your recording you
can  use  the  AUDITION  VELOCITY  feature to try different note velocities
until  you  find  the  one that sounds best.  Use the mouse, or press F5 to
activate  AUDITION  VELOCITY.   New notes will not be recorded; instead the
current  velocity selection will be changed to the velocity of each note as
it  is played.  When you decide that you like the velocity of the last note
played,  press  F5  again.   Recording  will  resume using the new velocity
value.

Note  that  if  you're  using  a  keyboard  that sends release velocity the
current  velocity  selection  will change when you release a key as well as
when a key is pressed.  In this case, be sure to turn AUDITION VELOCITY off
before releasing the key.

Duration Adjust  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  on  one of the four DURATION ADJUST values or pressing one of the
four  cursor  control  keys  allows  you  to  make small adjustments to the
current  duration  selection,  and to hear the result in the context of the
current time value.  Press the CURSOR RIGHT key to increase the duration by
one,  the CURSOR LEFT key to decrease by one, the CURSOR UP key to increase
by  four,  or  the  CURSOR DOWN key to decrease by four.  The most recently
recorded  note  will  be  played  eight times with the new durataon and the
current  time  and  velocity values.  If no notes have been recorded yet, a
middle C will be played.

Pause  
~~~~~~
If  you  want to play some notes without recording, press the ESC key.  The
word  PAUSE  will  appear,  and the program will stop recording.  Press ESC
again to resume recording.

ECHO and MIDI MERGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Iaf  you are using a master keyboard and an external synth module, you will
need to activate either ECHO or MIDI MERGE, just as you do on the other
screens. These functions can be selected and the echo channel changed with
the BACKSPACE, SEMICOLON (;), > (SHIFT-PERIOD), and < (SHIFT-COMMA) keys,
as described in Chapters 6 and 7, or the mouse can be used.

If ECHO or MIDI MERGE is on while in step time record, the velocity of all
notes received from MIDI will be reset to the currently selected velocity
before the notes are transmitted to the MIDI out jack.

Exit from Step Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click on EXIT or press Fl to go to the edit screen, or use EXIT TO PLAY or
F2 to go to the play screen.

                          Chapter 10
                          ~~~~~~~~~~
                          LOAD/SAVE
                          ~~~~~~~~~
The  Atari ST and Amiga vergions of the KCS use six different types of disk
files  to  store  the  data  used  by  the program.  Each file has a unique
extension.  When you select LOAD/SAVE from one of the edit screens a dialog
box  or  edit window will ask whether you want to load or save a file, which
disk drive to use, and what file type is to be accessed.

After  selecting  a  drive (on the ST only) and file type, click on LOAD or
SAVE.   Another  dialog  box  will  display  a  directory of files with the
selected  extension  on  the current disk.  In the Atari version, files are
selected  in  the  window using the GEM protocols that are discussed in the
STs  docuentation.   In  the  Amiga version, a fairly self explanatory file
select window will appear.  After selecting a file name, click on CANCEL to
exit or OK to load or save the file.  You do not have to specify .ALL,.SEQ,
.ENV, etc.  as these extensions will be added by the program.

In  the  ST  version of the program, clicking on FORMAT will format a blank
disk  for  data  storage.   The  file  type  selected  is  irrelevant  when
formatting  a disk.  Dialog bexes will confirm your choice, and ask for the
disk  type.   (In  the  Amiga  version of the program, you may format disks
directly  from  the  WorkBench.)  Clicking  on  CANCEL  exits the LOAD/SAVE
screen.

File Types 
~~~~~~~~~~
.ALL files contain all songs, sequences and tracks, plus the status of each
individual  track  and the contents of the text area, in memory at the time
the  file was saved.  ..  dtLL files can only be loaded or saved from Track
or  Open modes.  Loading a .ALL file will erase all data in the sequencer's
memory.

.SEQ files hold a single track or sequence.  These files can only be loaded
or  saved  from  Track  or Open mode.  The file saved will be the currently
selected  track  or sequence; when loaded, the file will be put in the next
available track or sequence, depending on the mode selected.

.TRK  files  hold all 48 tracks, plus their statuses.  Savng all tracks can
be done from any mode, but loading tracks can only be done from Track mode.

.SNG  files  hold a single song as wel1 as the sequences used in that song.
When  a .SNG file is loaded, each sequence is put in its original location,
unless  that  slot is already occupied, in which case the sequence is moved
to  the  first  empty  slot  and  the  song  is  changed to reflect the new
location.   This  allows  merging  multiple  songs into a single .ALL file.
Songs  can  only  be loaded or saved from Song mode, and the song loaded or
saved   is  the  currently  selected  song  or  the  next  available  song,
respectively.

A set of Open mode sequences that are not otherwise used in a song can be
saved and loaded as a group by creating a dummy song made up from a list of
the desired sequences. In this case, though, PRIMARY and ST events
contained in Open mode sequences will not be reassigned if that sequence is
already in use, so you will need to be careful to avoid such conflicts if
you use the dummy song method.

.ENV  files  are  environment  files,  and  contain  most of the parameters
diplayed in the SET OPTIONS edit window, as well as the time, duration, and
velocity  values  used in step time recording.  If a file named DEFAULT.ENV
is saved on the KCS program disk, this file will be loaded when the program
boots.

.ENV  files  are  also created automatical@y whenever you save a .ALL file.
When  a .ALL file is saved, the searches for a .ENV file with the same name
and loads that file as well.

MIDI Files and File Formats  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For Atari ST owners who would like to use KCS 
sequence files  with  other  sequencers  that support the MIDI sequence
file
format, we  have  written a utility program entitled CONVERT.PRG,    which
will convert KCS  sequence  files to MIDI standard files, and vice versa.
(An
Amiga  version  will  be  available shortly.) The MIDI sequence file
fornhat is an emerging standard, which has been unofficially adopted by
many music software publishers, including Dr. T's, Opcode, Intelligent
Music, Passport, and others. Instructions for the use of this program are
contained in a README file, which is included with the program. CONVERT.PRG
may be found on many MIDI related bulletin boards, or it may be obtained
directly from Dr. T's for a nominal fee.

For advanced computer musicians who would like to write programs that can
exchange files with the KCS, the file formats for the .ALL, .SEQ, .SNG, and
.TRK file types are available for a nominal charge to cover printing and
shipping. Contact us for more information.

Caveats  
~~~~~~~
One  point  to  be  aware of when saving ,ALL or other long files is that a
computer with 1 meg or more of memory can hold many more notes than can fit
on  a  single disk.  A double sided disk can hold about 120000 notes, and a
single  sided  disk (on the ST only) only holds about half this number.  If
you  somehow  find yourself with more notes than will fit on a single disk,
you  will  have to save some individual sequences or songs then delete them
and save the remaining data in a .ALL file.

CAUTION:  With the exception of the DEFAULT.ENV file mentioned earlier, you
should  NEVER  save  your  data  files on the KCS program disk!  This could
cause  conflicts  with  the  program,'s copy protection, which will make it
impossible  to  load  the  program.   The  write protect tab on the program
diskette  should be left open at all times except when saving a DEFAULT.ENV
file.

                           SET OPTIONS
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~
The  SET  OPTIONS  edit  window  allows  you  to  set a number of important
parameters used by the prog@am.  The SET OPTIONS screen can be reached from
any  edit  screen  by  clicking  on SET OPTIONS, or from any play screen by
pressing the 0 (ZERO) key.

The  SET  OPTIONS  screen  is divided into six areas, each of which contain
buttons  and  numeric  data  fields  for  a  group  of  related parameters.
Settings  for  the  different  parameters  are  changed as described in the
section on edit window in Chapter 1.  Most of the parameters on this screen
can also be loaded from or saved to disk in a .ENV file, which is described
later in this chapter.

MIDI  
~~~~
MIDI MERGE causes the program, to transmit all data received at its MIDI in
to  the  MIDI  out  jack.   MIDI  merge  can be turned on and off from this
screen, or with the SEMICOLON (;) key on any of the play screens.  You will
need MIDI merge if you are using a master keyboard and remote modules.

MIDI  merge  functions when the program is on one of the play/record
screens, though not on the edit 
screens, and MIDI merging is overridden when ECHO is on.  Also
note  that  if  a system exclusive message being received by the program is
interrupted  for  some reason, the program will hang up until you press Fl.

START IS 1ST CLOCK allows you to tell the program whether it should
respond  to  a  MIDI  start or continue command as though it were the first
MIDI  clock, or simply as an instruction to start listening
for MIDI clocks.  If you are syncing to an external MIDI clock source, pick
the setting which seems to sync better with your other equipment. In
particular, if you are transferring sequences from another instrument using
the techniques outlined in chapter 13 and the time of the first event recorded
is always off by one clock step, yu should change this setting. This option
has no effect if the internal clock is being used.

NO  MIDI  START lets the program respond to MIDI clock even if a MIDI start
command  is not received.  This is sometimes needed for certain specialized
applications  involving  recording from other sequencers, and has no effect
when the internal clock is selected.

SONG  POINTER SEND activates the transmission of MIDI song pointer messages
by  the  KCS.   When  this  option  is  turned on, the program will send an
apropriate  song  pointer  message  whenever  a song, sequence, or track is
started  from  a cue point, or when a track loops to the beginning of a cue
loop.   The DLY button, to the left of SONG POINTER SEND, adds a one second
delay  between  the  MIDI  Song  Pointer and Continue messages after CUE is
selected on any play screen.  This allows the external instruments to catch
up to the sequencer before it starts.

MIDI  CLOCK  OUT tells the program to enable or disable the sending of MIDI
clock.   If  you  are not syncing a drum machine to the KCS via MIDI clock,
you  may  want to turn this off to reduce the amount of data sent via MIDI.
For  some  specialized  applicaions,  you  may  want  to  send  MIDI  clock
selectively   from   your  sequences  using  *  events,  and  not  send  it
automatically with every clock step.

RUNNING  STATUS  reduces the amount of MIDI data transmitted by eliminating
redundant  status  bytes,  which  can  help reduce timing or other problems
caused  by  MIDI  data  overload.   Use with caution, especially if you are
using a MIDI switch box.

MIDI  SLOW  adds  a  slight delay after each byte sent out over MIDI.  Some
MIDI  instruments  cannot  respond  to  MIDI  data  when transmitted at the
standard  MIDI  transmission  rate  (the baud rate to you techies).  Yamaha
instruments  are the most notorious for this, but it is also a problem with
some  MIDIed  Drumulators.   If  your instruments randomly miss or stick on
some notes, try setting MIDI SLOW to a value in the 60's.  Use the smallest
value  that  you  can for MIDI SLOW, as increasing it causes the program to
spend time waiting around when it could be working.

MIDI  instruments  can also miss data because too much is being sent at one
time.   This sounds like the problem described above, but is acutally quite
different.   The  instruments get so much MIDI data that they have no place
to  put it while they are doing their other work, and some gets lost.  MIDI
SLOW  will  probably not help this problem.  You will have to get some MIDI
channel filters, so instruments only receive data intended for them, or you
will  have  to record less data.  Continuous controllers (mod wheels, pitch
wheels, aftertouch, etc.) are a likely cause of this problem

RECORDING  
~~~~~~~~~
The  options  in  this  portion  SET OPTIONS screen are used to set certain
parameters  which  affect  recording  in  Track  and  Open modes.  With the
exception  of  MUTE NEW TRACKS, all recording options affect both Track and
Open  mode  recording.   Many of these options can also be changed from the
record  screens  as  well,  and  further  information can be found in those
chapters.

CONTROLLERS,  AFTERTOUCH,  and  NOTE  OFF  VELOCITY  are  used to enable or
disable  the  recording  of  MIDI controllers (coninuous controllers, pitch
bend, and program changes), aftertouch, and note off, or release, velocity.
The PAUSE switch, next to CONTROLLERS, allows recording controller settings
when  the sequences is paused.  When this switch is on, the last value only
of  any  controller  that  is adjusted when the sequencer is paused will be
recorded.   This  could  be  used,  for  example,  to enter a single volume
control  message  in a previously recorded part, by playing the sequence to
the point of the insertion, pressing PAUSE, and then playing a few notes on
the  keyboard  while  adjusting  the  volume.  Once you've found the proper
setting,  restart  the  sequencer  by  pressing  PAUSE again, and the final
volume  setting  will  be  recorded.  (Of course, the RECORD switch must be
turned on, as well, and the sequence or track containing the newly recorded
data  will  need  to  be  merged  with  the  original track or sequence, as
always).

SYSEX enables the recording of system exclusive messages.  When this switch
is  on,  sysex  messages of up to 5000 bytes can be recorded as single byte
events.   This  is  less  memory  efficient  than  storing  sysex data in a
librarian program, but it may be more convenient in some instances.

ALIGN  is  used to force tracks or sequences to "line up" with the start of
each  measure,  when  recording  or  playing.  If ALIGN is on while you are
playing  sequences  from  the Open mode play screen, sequence playback will
not  start  as soon as the sequence key is pressed, but at the beginning of
the  next  measure.  If ALIGN is on while recording in either Track or Open
modes, recording will not stop immediately when the F10 key is pressed, but
will continue until the start of the next measure.

MUTE  NEW  TRACKS  causes  tracks to be muted as soon as they are recorded.
This  is  convenient, for instance, when recording multiple takes of a long
solo  over a track, since earlier takes of the solo will not be played back
as the sequencer loops.  It is also handy when looping over a short cue, to
give you a chance to play a short riff many times while you work on getting
it right.

QUANTIZE  toggles real time auto-correction.  When QUANTIZE is on, the time
values  and durations of all events recorded will be rounded to the nearest
multiple  of  the  number to the right of QUANTIZE.  Unlike auto-correction
from  the  edit screens, quantization cannot be undone.  Another difference
is  that  all event types, including controller events and program changes,
will  be  rounded  when  QUANTIZe  is  on,  whereas  only note messages are
affected by autocorrection.

ECHO  is  similar  to  MIDI  merging,  except  that  all  data  received is
rechannelized  before  recording or transmission to the MIDI out jack.  The
number to the right of ECHO is the echo channel.

FILTER  forces the sequencer to only receive data on a single MIDI channel,
called  the  filter  channel.   Data on all other channels is filtered out.
This  is  especially useful when recording data from another sequencer into
the  KCS,  or  when "expanding" a single channel's data from many sequences
into  a single sequence using the loopback recording technique described in
Chapter 13.  The number to the right of FILTER is the filter channel.

COUNTIN allows you to select the number of "free" steps that you get before
recording  starts  in  real  time.  The metronome will sound and MIDI clock
will  be sent during the countin, but the program's clock will be held at 0
until  the  count  is  over.  Remember, this is set in steps, not metronome
beats,  so  to  get a one measure countin at 96 steps per measure, you must
enter 96.  The maximum value for COUNTIN is 255 steps.

OTHER
~~~~~
SILENT  PUNCH  only  affects  the operation of the sequencer in Track mode.
When  SILENT  PUNCH  is  on, notes that are being punched out will be muted
while  punch  points  are  being  set.   Once the punch points are set, the
punched  portion  of  the  track will be muted regardless of the setting of
this  switch.   SILENT  PUNCH also affects notes that are deleted when LIVE
EDIT  is active - if SILENT PUNCH is off, notes that are being deleted will
still sound when LIVE EDIT is on.

ACTIVITY  DISPLAY  enables  the  musical  icons which appear next to active
tracks  in  the  track status display.  You might want to turn the activity
display  off when recording or playing very dense musical passages, or when
using high clock resolutions.

STEP DISPLAY enables the step portion of the measure/step counter.  Turning
the  step display off reduces the computer's work load slightly, and allows
the program to concentrate on more important tasks.

MIN:SEC  DISPLAY  enables the real time clock, which displays the amount of
time  elapsed  since  the  sequencer was started.  As with the STEP DISPLAY
switch,   turning   this  switch  off  may  help  in  hypercritical  timing
applications.  See Chapter 13 for details on the real time clock.

RE-RECORD  STOP  affects the operation of the UNDO key and RE-RECORD button
in  Track  mode  only.   When this switch is highlighted, pressing the UNDO
will   erase   the  current  recording,  stop  the  clock,  and  reset  the
measure/step counter.  When Re-RECORD STOP is off, pressing UNDO will erase
the current recording, but the sequencer will continue to play.

TRACK  MODE LOOP, suprisingly enough, controls looping in Track mode.  When
this  switch  is  off,  all trakcs will play through only once.  It is also
possible to play or record past the end of track 1 (which normally sets the
loop  point  for Track mode) by turning TRACK MODE LOOP off.  You should be
careful  about  recording on tracks other than track 1 when TRACK MODE LOOP
is turned off, since any data recorded past the end of track 1 will be lost
when  a DOUBLE, APPEND, or ALL TRACKS TO SEQ operation is performed, unless
the  length  of track 1 is extended by changing the TIME value of track 1's
final DE event.

TEMPO  CHG  BY  RATIO  changes the amount of tempo change which occurs when
tempo  is  changed  from the Track mode control panel, or from the computer
keyboard.  When this switch is off, the tempo will change by 1 BPM when any
of  the  tempo  controls is pressed; when this switch is on, the tempo will
change by about 2.5% for each button press.

MIDI  KEYS  is  a  convenience  feature for advanced KCS users, that allows
controlling  certain  sequencer  functions from an external MIDI footswitch
controller.   When  this switch is on, MIDI controllers 64, 65, and 66 (the
sustain,  portamento,  and  sustenuto  pedals,  respectively) duplicate the
functions of certain keys on the computer's keyboard on the program's Track
mode,  Open  mode,  and  step  time  record  screens.   The  sustain  pedal
duplicates  the F10 key and right mouse button on all three screens, but is
especially  useful  in Track mode, since this allows you to start recording
and  set the track loop point with no hands.  In Track mode, the portamento
pedal  is  equivalent  to  the  RE-RECORD  button,  and the sustenuto pedal
controls  the  STOP  button.   In  Open  mode, the portamento and sustenuto
pedals  are  used to start real time recording, and duplicate the functions
of  the  RETURN  (record  on next event) and ENTER (record immediate) keys,
respectively.  On the step time record screen, the portamento pedal inserts
a  rest,  and  the  sustenuto  pedal  deletes  the  previous  note.   These
controllers  are  recognized  on  all  MIDI channels, and are not merged or
recorded when MIDI KEYS is active.

DRUM  CHANNEL  selects  one channel which will not be affected by any pitch
transpositions,  either  as  part  of  a  song or control sequence, or when
editing  a  sequence  or  track.   This  is intended for use with MIDI drum
machines.   Since  drum  machines assign each drum to a separate MIDI note,
transposing  a  drum  part  will  cause the wrong drums to be played by the
sequencer; hence the need for a drum channel.

DEBOUNCE sets the amount of time a mouse button must be held down before it
will  repeat  on  the  Open  or  Track  mode play screens, in 5 millisecond
increments.   A  value of 100 corresponds to 1/2 second.  You may find that
different values of debounce are needed for different applications.

CUE  MOVE  AMOUNT  sets the amount that the cue point(s) will move when the
cue  move  buttons  are  pressed.   This  will toggle between one and eight
measures  when the INSERT key is pressed on any play screen, but can be set
to any value from 1 to 99 on the SET OPTIONS screen.

VELOCITY PEDAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  switches  in  the VELOCITY PEDAL section are used to choose one of the
three  velocity pedal options, as well as the velocity pedal channel, which
are  used to affect note velocities during Open or Track mode recording, or
when  LIVE  EDIT  is active in Track mode.  Velocity pedal in Open mode can
only  be selected from this screen.  See the chapters on the Open and Track
mode play/record screens for details on velocity pedal functions.

TIMING
~~~~~~
The  parameters in the TIMING section of the SET OPTIONS window are used to
select  the  clock  source  and set the timing resolution of the sequencer.
Chapter 13 has more information on timing resolution.

INTERNAL CLK selects the program's internal timer as the clock source.  The
number  to  the right of the switch is the tempo, in beats per minute.  The
tenths  of  BPM  digit is treated as a separate field by the program, which
means  you  will  need  to use the mouse to place the cursor on this digit.
Remember  that the internal clock is always used when playing a sequence or
track  from  the  edit  screen, so the setting of the clock source selector
switches will have no effect when working on the edit screen.

MIDI  CLOCK  selects  an  external  MIDI  clock  as  the clock source.  The
sequencer  will  wait  for a MIDI start or continue message before starting
any tracks or sequences unless the NO MIDI START button is turned on.

MIDI  W SONG POINTER selects the external MIDI clock source and enables the
reception  of  MIDI  song pointer messages.  When a song pointer message is
received,  the  sequencer  will  move to that point in the current song cue
sequence, or track, and play from that point.

STEPS/MEASURE sets the number of steps in a measure, which only affects
the  measure/step counter on the play and edit screens, and the event list
on the
edit screen.  This value will change whenever an SM event is encountered by
a sequence or track.  The followng table shows the correct STEPS/MEASURE
setting for the most common time signatures and STEPS/BEAT values.

   Time               Steps/Beat
Signature		24  		48  		96  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3/8  		36  		72 		144 
2/4 			48 		96 		192 
5/8 			60 		120 		240 
3/4 			72 		144 		288 
7/8 			84 		168 		336 
4/4 			96 		192 		384 
9/8 			108		216  	432  
5/4 			120 		240 		480  
6/4 		 	144 		288 		576
7/4 			168 		336 		672 

STEPS/BEAT  sets  the  overall  timing  resolution  of  the sequencer.  The
standard  value for STEPS/BEAT is 24.  Higher values allow for more precise
timing,  but  also  make editing more difficult and put a greater strain on
the  computer,  by  giving  it  less  time between steps in which to do its
"housekeeping" chores.

If STEPS/BEAT is changed during a SET OPTIONS session, the program will ask
if  you  want  to  "Adjust all event times?" when you @eave the SET OPTIONS
screen.   Answering  "Y" to this question will compress or expand all event
times and durations to match the new resolution.  The program will also ask
of  you  wish  to  adjust  the related parameters.  A "Y"$ answer here will
change   the   STEPS/MEASURE,  STEPS/MIDI  CLK,  and  STEPS/METRO  settings
proportionally, or "N" will leave the settings unchanged.

STEPS/MIDI  CLK sets the number of sequencer steps between each MIDI clock.
This  should  normally  be  set  to  1  when STEPS/BEAT is 24, and adjusted
proportionally  when  STEPS/BEAT  is  increased.   The  sequencer  uses the
current  tempo  setting to interpolate between MIDI clocks when an external
MIDI  clock  is used and STEPS/BEAT is greater than 24, so there will be an
improvement in resolution when STEPS/BEAT and STEPS/MIDI CLK are increased,
even if an enternl clock is in use.

METRONOME  
~~~~~~~~~
STEPS/METRO  sets the interval between metronome ticks.  The default is for
the  metronome  to occur every 24 steps.  If you want the metronome more or
less  often,  or you change the STEPS/BEAT setting, you will want to change
the number of steps per metronome.

AUDIBLE  METRONOME  enables  or  disables  the  metronome  "click"  that is
produced by the monitor speaker.

VISIBLE  METRONOME  enables  or disables the musical icon metronome that is
shown on the Track mode and Open mode play/record screens.

PLAY  METRONOME  turns  the metronome on when the sequencer is in play.  If
this  switch  is  off,  the  metronome  will only occur when the program is
recording.

Environment Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most  of  the parameters shown on the SET OPTIONS screen can be saved in an
environment  file.   This  allows  you to quickly and accurately change the
recording  and  playback  parameters  when  you  move  to  a  new recording
situation.  Environment files have a .ENV extension.

Environment  files contain the values for time, duration, and velocity used
on  the  Step  time  record  screen,  as  well as the following SET OPTIONS
parameters.  All the parameters from the MIDI and METRONOME sections of the
SET  OPTIONS  screen  (except  the DLY switch) are saved, and in the TIMING
section,   all  parameters  are  saved.   In  the  RECORDING  section,  the
CONTROLLERS,  AFTERTOUCH,  and NOTE OFF VELOCITY record switches are saved,
as  well  as  the  ECHO  status  and  channel.   In  the OTHER section, all
parameters  except  TRACK MODE LOOP, MIDI KEYS, and the CUE MOVE AMOUNT are
saved,  and  in  the VELOCITY PEDAL section, only the CHANNEL is saved.  In
the Amiga version of the program, the screen colors are also saved.

If  a  file  named  DEFAULT.ENV  exists on the KCS program disk, it will be
automatically loaded when the program boots up.  .ENV files are also loaded
and saved automatically with .ALL files, under the same file name.

If  the  STEPS/BEAT  setting  in the environment file is different than the
current  setting  when you are loading a .ENV file, the program will ask if
you  want  to  adjust  all event times.  See the LOAD/SAVE chapter for more
information on .ENV files.

While  it is possible to make good use of the Keyboard Controlled Sequencer
wdthout  detailed  knowedge  of MIDI, you will undoubtedly find that as you
start  to  realize  some  of  the  enormous potential inherent in most MIDI
instruments;  an  understanding  of  the nuts and bolts of MIDI can be very
helpful.   This  chapter  contains  information  on  a  number  of subjects
pertinent  to  the  KCS,  but  is  by  no  means  a complete guide to MIDI.
Fortunately, a number of well written books on the subject have appeared on
the  market;  we  recommend  tracking  one  down  if you need more detailed
information.

MIDI Connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A MIDI cord consists of a twisted and shielded pair of wires, with the body
of the plug isolated from the shield.  At the MIDI out jack, the MIDI cable
plugs  directly  into the synth or computer's circuitry; but at the MIDI in
of  the  receiving  instrument,  the  cable connects to an "opto isolator",
which  uses  light,  rather  than  electrons, to couple the signal into the
instrument.   This  means that there is no electrical conductor between the
MIDI  in  of  one  machine  and  the MIDI out of another, so you can't blow
something by incorrect patching.

Although  MIDI  cables look the same as standard DIN or Roland sync cables,
the  grounding  of  the  two  cables  is  different.  DIN cables can create
"ground  loops",  which  will cause hum and other nasty sounds to appear at
the output of your synthesizer(s).

As  mentioned  in  the  first  chapter  of this manual, the Atari ST uses a
nonstandard  method  for  creating a MIDI thru connection with its MIDI out
jack.   This causes a conflict with some types of (nonstandard) MIDI cables
which have the two normally unused pins (1 and 3) shorted to the pins which
carry  MIDI data (4 and 5).  The best solution to this situation is to have
the ST permanently modified to meet the MIDI spec; a less drastic s9olution
is  to  check  your cables with an ohm meter, preferably before leaving the
store with them.

MIDI Modes
~~~~~~~~~~
MIDI  modes determing how an instrument will respond to incoming MIDI data.
MIDI  modes  can  be  a  source  of confusion to beginners and pro's alike,
primarily  because  one MIDI manufacturer mininterpreted the meaning of one
of  the modes when they introduced their first MIDI synthesizer.  The three
original  modes were broken into four modes to allow for this.  Since then,
other  manufacturers  have  created  new modes to take advantave of various
types  of  multi-timbral implementations.  The original four MIDI modes can
be selected on any synth that implements them through a control change (CC)
event  called  a  mode  message;  any  other  modes must be selected at the
instrument  or  with  a  sysex  message.   The section below on USEFUL MIDI
COMMANDS  gives  an example of how to select one of the four standard modes
from the KCS.

The  four  standard  modes  are  called  Omni  On/Poly,  Omni On/Mono, Omni
Off/Poly,  and  Omni  Off/Mono;  they  are  also  known  as  modes  1  - 4,
respectively.  The two Omni On modes cause the synth to receive data on all
16  MIDI  channels  at  once; this is good for keyboards that are connected
together  in  a  layering  arrangement,  but  not  so  hot  for  sequencing
applications.   Many  earlier  synths  and drum machines power up in mode 1
(Omni On/Poly), and must be changed to one of the other modes to be used in
a  multi  instrument  sequencing  environment.   Mode  2  (Omni On/Mono) is
virtually  useless  in  all  situations, as it causes an instrument to play
ponly  one voice monophonically, from all MIDI channels.  This is the extra
mode that was accidentally created in the early days of MIDI.

The  two  Omni  Off  modes,  modes 3 and 4, are more useful in a sequencing
environment.   Mode 3 (Omni Off/Poly) causes a synth to play all its voices
polyphonically  on one MIDI channel, while Mode 4 (Omni Off/Mono) puts each
voice  on a separate MIDI channel for monophonic operation.  The CZ-101 and
Sixtrak  both  use  Mode 4 to implement their multi-timbral features, while
more  advanced  synths  like  the Oberheim Xpander, Ensoniq ESQ1 and Yamaha
FB01  use  non-standard  MIDI  modes  to allow assigning some voices to one
channel, and some to others.

Other MIDI Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some  synthesizers  can  be  placed  in an operating condition called Local
Control Off.  In this mode, they will respond only to signals coming in via
MIDI,  while ignoring their keyboards.  They will continue to send keyboard
information via MIDI OUT.  Local Control On will return the synth to normal
operation.    Local   control   messages   are  subset  of  the  continuous
controllers, and are sent from the sequencer with CC events.

System  real time messages are used to synchronize MIDI instruments in real
time.   The  timing clock message will advance drum machines and sequencers
to  move  in  time  with  the  sequencer.   Other system real time messages
include  the start, stop and continue commands.  Normally, these events are
sent  by  the  KCS at the appropriate times, but they can be sent as single
byte  messages  for  specialized applications.  Other less useful real time
messages include the reset and active sense messages.

System  common  messages  are  miscellaneous  messages which can be sent to
instruments,  regardless  of  what  channel they are on.  These include the
song select command, the tune command (which initiates oscillator tuning on
analog  synthesizers),  and  the  much  ballyhooed  song  position  pointer
message.

System  exclusive  (sysex) messages are used by individual manufacturers to
do  whatever  they want to do with their instruments that is not covered in
the normal MIDI spec.  This includes, but is not limited to, functions such
as  patch  dumps, remote button pushing, and even displaying messages on an
instrument's  display.   You  can  use  single  byte  events  to send sysex
information,  but  it  is  your responsibility to determine the response of
your  instruments  to  the  information  sent.   The  March  1987  issue of
Electronic  Musician has an article on using system exclusive data with the
KCS.

Some Useful MIDI Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All  of  the message types described above can be sent from the KCS, either
as   CC   events,  or  with  single  byte  messages.   While  many  earlier
synthesizers,  such  as the Sixtrak, have their own controller assignments,
the  assignments  of  all MIDI controllers are now standardized by the MIDI
Manufacturers Association, and are listed on the next page.

Many instruments also have assignable controls, which can be set to send or
recognize  any  MIDI  controller.   This  allows  you  to  use  any  of the
unassigned  or  less  common  controllers  for whatever purpose you'd like.
Examples  of  such  instruments are the Oberheim Xpander, Matrix 12, and XK
keyboard  the  Yamaha  KX76 and KX88 keyboard controllers, and the Kurzweil
MIDIBoard.

As  an  example  of how these might be used, here is a sequence that sets a
CZ-101  on  Channel  5  to MIDI mode 4 (Omni Off/Mono) and then turns Local
Control Off on channels 6 and 7:

MSR- ST	EVNT	 TIME	CH   TYP	NOTE	 VEL	 DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		5	CC	126	  0		
1-	1	2	  0		6	CC	122	  0	 
1-	1	3	  0		7	CC	122	  0	 


The  other  three  modes  require  two  mode  change  messages  to select a
particular  mode,  for instance, control changes on controllers 124 and 127
to select Omni Off/Poly On.

The  numbers to be entered in single byte events for the other messge types
are given below:


Message Name  		1st Byte 		2nd Byte 		3rd Byte
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sysex Start 		240 			ID #  
Song Pointer 		242  		LSB  		MSB 
Song Select 		243            Song #

Timing Clock 		248 
Start 			250 
Continue 			251 
Stop 			252 
Axtive Sense		254 
System Reset 		255

The  values used for the second and third bytes in the first three messages
must  be  in  the  range  of  0 - 127.  If is you are using the song select
message  to  select a song on an external drum machine or sequencer, you'll
need  to  send  a  stop  message just before the song select message, and a
start  message  immediately  thereafter.   The  form  of  system  exclusive
messages  varies  from  one  instrument to another; consult your manual for
details.

Program Changes  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  program  numbers  assigned  to MIDI program change
numbers  can  vary quite  a  bit from one manufacturer to the next.
Generally
speaking, sending  a program change to a Sequential of Oberheim synthesizer
will cause that patch number to be selected, while sending the same program
change to a Yamaha or Ensoniq instrument will select that patch number
minus one. Casio uses a strange overlapping system which is described in
the APPLICATIONS chapter, while Korg, Roland, and others use a "bank
system" in which programs are selected via a modified octal numbering
system.

The following table shows which numbers to enter in a PG event to select a
program on instruments that use the bank system. The Group A and Group B
columns respect another level of program selection used on some Roland
instruments. Use the values in the Group A column for synths without this
feature.

Program  		Group A 			Group B
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
11 - 18 		0 - 7 			64 - 71 
21 - 28 		8 - 15 			72 - 79
31 - 38 		16 - 23 			80 - 87  
41 - 48 		24 - 31 			88 - 95 
51 - 58 		32 - 39			96 - 103
61 - 68 		40 - 47 			104 - 111
71 - 78 		48 - 55 			112 - 119 
81 - 88 		56 - 62 			120 - 127

The  MIDI  implementation  chart  which  comes  with each instrument should
describe the program numbering scheme for that machine:  if not, REXMAN!

MIDI Note Numbers 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MIDI note numbering is also handled differently by different manufacturers.
The  note  numbering  system  used by Dr.  T's is shown in the chart below,
where  th  keyboard  represents  a five octave keyboard like those found on
most instruments today.  Note that the system we use does not coincide with
that  used  by Yamaha.  Yamaha designates the lowest key on the five octave
keyboard C1, whereas we call that key C2.

MIDI Drums 
~~~~~~~~~~
When drum machines are played through MIDI, each drum is asigned to one or
more notes on the MIDI keyboard. While newer machines allow you to assign
each drum to a specific note (and possibly to a specific channel as well),
there is sort of a quasi-standard in effect regarding drum machine note
assignments. These assignments, which are also used in our Copyist
transcription program, are listed below.

Drum				Note #'s			Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bass 			35, 36 			B1, C2
Snare 			38, 40 			D2, E2
Rim 				37 				C#2
Claps			39 				D#2
Floor Tom 		41, 43 			F2, G2
Low Tomm, 		45, 47 			A2, B2
Mid Tom 			49 50 			C3, D3
Hi Tom 			52, 53 			E3, F3
Open Hi Hat 		46 				A#2
Closed Hi Hat 		42, 44 			F#2, G#2
Crash cymbal 		49 				C#3
Ride Cymbal 		51 				D#3
Tamb/Crash 2 		54 				F#3
Cowbell  			56   			G#3
Shaker 			58 				A#3

Most  drum  machines  only allow one note number to be assigned to a single
drum.   In  this  case,  use the higher note for any drums which are listed
with two numbers.

                       TIPS FOR ADVANCED USERS
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the four years since the release of Version 1.0 of the Commodore 64 KCS,
the  thousands  or  musicians  who use the program have undoubtably come up
with  many  thousands of useful techniques, tricks, and shortcuts.  Much as
we  would  like  to,  space does not permit us to present all of them here.
This  chapter  discusses  many fundmental KCS techniques which might not be
obvious  at  first,  and  will  hopefully  serve  as a catalyst for further
experimentation.

Control Sequences in Open Mode  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A sequence shich consists of sequence control events (PRIMARY, ST, XX, XL,
MS, US, PT, or VT) is called a control sequence. You may find it beneficial
to record individual sequences or parts of songs and then use control
sequences to start them up. This example will start three sequences
together and end four measures later.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	 TIME	CH TYP	NOTE	VEL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0			A	 0	  0	 1
1-	1	2	  0			7	 0	  0	 1
1-	1	3	  0			2	-4	  0	 1
5-	1	4	384		    DE		  	

When  the  control  sequence  which  follows  is started, sequences A and B
immediately start and will play four times.  One measure later, sequence 15
(which  is  a  secondary sequence) starts playing for two repetitions.  Two
measures  later, sequence B is forced to shut off, and another two measures
later, the TM event will change the tempo to 100 beats/minute.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	   TIME	CH  TYP	NOTE	 VEL	 DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	    0		B	0	  0	  4
1-	1	2	    0		A	0	  0	  4
1-	1	3	   96	    ST 	15	  0	  2
1-	1	4	  192	    XX	B		  
1-	1	5	  192	    TM	100	

Creating Songs with Control Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two techniques that we recommend for using control sequences to
combine Open mode sequences into songs. The first technique involves
creating a control sequence that starts other control sequences and waits
for each sequence. This sequence controls the segueing of the sections of
the piece. The sequences started by this sequence each start the sequences
required by their section. In the following example, the song consists of
sequence 1, followed by 2, 3 and then 1 again.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME		CH TYP	NOTE	VEL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	0			1	0	  0	1W
1-	1	2	0			2	0	  0	1W
1-	1	3	0			3	0	  0	1W
1-	1	4	0			1	0	  0	1W

MSR-ST	EVNT	TIME		CH TYP	NOTE	VEL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	0			A	0	  0	1
1-	1	2	0			B	0	  0	2
1-	1	3	0			C	0	  0	1W
1-	1	4	0		    DE

The sccond sequence above is sequence 1.  Sequences A, B, and C are started
together,  and  sequence  1 waits for sequence C to complcte before ending.
Sequence  B is played tiwce.  When using a structure such as this, you will
probably  want  all  parts to play for the same Control amount of time.  In
the  case, sequence B would be half the length of sequences A and C.  The W
(Wait)  for  sequence  C  prevents  the song from, continuing to sequence 2
until  sequence C has completed.  The DE event may look superfluous, but it
is  necessary  to  keep sequence 1 from ending after sequence C is started,
causing the main control sequence to continue.  If you always end a control
sequence  that will be started by another control sequence with a DE event,
you  will  prevent such problems without having to think about what goes on
inside the program.

The  other  technique  is to use a single control sequence without waits to
"schedule"  the  starting of other sequences.  This has the disadvantage of
requiring  you  to  compute and enter the times necessary to get all of the
parts  to  start  exactly  when  you want them to.  It has the advantage of
comptete  flexibility.   Parts  can  be started while other parts are still
playing,  and  XX  or  XL  events can be used to stop looping parts without
calculating their normal stop points.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME		CH TYP	NOTE	VEL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0			A	0	  0  1
1-	1	2	  0			B	0	  0	2
1-	1	3	  0			C	0	  0	1
9-	1	4	768			B	0	  0	2
9-	1	5	  0			D	0	  0	99
9-	1	6	  0			E	0	  0  1
13-	1	7	384			F	0	  0	1
13-	1	8	  0		    XX    D

This  example  might  be used to play a song with the same beginning as the
one  in  the  previous  example.   Eight bars into the piece, sequence B is
started  for  two more plays.  Sequence D, perhaps just a sixteenth note hi
hat,  is started indefinitely, and sequence E is started for a single play.
Four bars after that, sequence D is stopped and sequence F is started.  The
second  method is the one Dr.  T usually prefers when he is composing music
instead of writing software.

Control Sequences as Real Time Controllers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many  of the KCS's event types which modify the playback of other sequences
can  be  used  as  real  time  controllers  themselves, by creating control
sequences  which  perform  specific  operations  on  other  sequences.  For
example,  suppose that you find that, when creating songs in Open mode, you
often  have a need to mute every part EXCEPT your drum sequences.  Assuming
that  you use channel 16 for your drum parts, enter the following sequences
in sequences 91 and 92.

MSR- ST	EVNT	 TIME  CH  TYP	 NOTE  VEL   DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		  MS	  *
1-	1	2	  0		  US   *16

MSR-	ST	EVNT	 TIME  CH  TYP	 NOTE  VEL  DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	0		  US    *

Now  typing  91 on the nuberic keyboard will mute all active sequences, and
immediately unmute all active sequences that start with an event on channel
16.   This  is  effectively  the  same as muting all sequences but those on
channel  16.   Sequence  92  will  return  all sequences to their original,
unmuted status.

Note  that,  as  with  all  applications  which  involve starting Open mode
sequences  from  the  keyboard,  the  number of repeats programmed for each
control  sequence  will have a profound effect on the operation of any real
time  control  sequences.  In the preceeding example, if sequence 91 is set
to  loop  indefinitely,  then all subsequent sequences on that start with a
channel  other  than  16  will be muted each time sequence 91 loops, and if
sequence  91  is  set  to  loop  only once, then sequences that start after
sequence  91  is  played  will not be muted.  Generally speaking, real time
control sequences should be set to repeat only once, if predictable effects
are to be obtained.

Real time control sequences can perform more exciting functions than simply
muting  tracks,  though.   Suppose  that,  for  some  reason, you'd like to
simulate  the  effect  of playing a 33 RPM record at 45 RPM.  In this case,
you'd  need  to  speed  up  the  sequencer's  tempo,  while  simultaneously
transposing each part up by a corresponding amount.  The following sequence
does just that:

MSR-  ST	 EVNT  TIME  CH  TYP  NOTE  VEL  DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	 1	  1	    0	   AC   372
1-	 1	  1	    0	   PT     *   5

If  you're  picky  about details, you could program a sequence in which the
tempo  and  pitch  transposition  are  gradually increased, to simulate the
flywheel  effect  caused  by  the inertia of the turntable.  Of course, you
will  probably  want to create a corresponding sequence to return the speed
to normal, unless you really enjoy listening to records at the wrong speed.

If you have created a series of real time control sequences that are useful
in  a  number of applications, it may be convenient to save these sequences
in  a  group, so they can be loaded for use with other sequences.  This can
be done by simply creating a song, in Song mode, which contains all of your
real  time  control  sequences.  Such a song would never be played as other
songs are, of course, but this technique allows these sequences to be saved
and loaded as a group.  See Chapter 10 for details.

Additional Control Sequence Techniques
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may wish to create a separate control sequence that contains all of the
program changes needed for your song.  You might want to put a few steps of
rest  in this sequence if using the first technique, or start this sequence
slightly  ahead  of the others.  The extra time gives the program changes a
chance to "settle" before any notes are played.

You may wish to set up the basic structure of your song using either of the
above  techniques,  and  then  use  the  RECORD  WITH  CUE  feature  to add
additional  parts  which  can start at any point in the sequence.  You must
then  add  a sequence start event (without a WAIT) for each new sequence at
the  beginning  of  the main control sequence.  Dr.  T frequently uses this
technique  to  overdub  continuous  controller  information after the basic
piece is completed.

Suggestions on Timing Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The   Keyboard   Controlled  Sequencer  defaults  to  a  resolution  of  24
steps/beat.   This  corresponds  to  clocks  that are separated by about 20
milliseconds  (ms)  at a tempo of 120 beats/minute.  The program allows you
to  increase  the steps/beat value up to 384, but there are several reasons
that we recommend a value no higher than 96.

Given  that  it  takes  1  ms  to  send  most  MIDI  messages,  and that no
instruments will respond instantly, setting the time between clock steps to
1  or  2  ms  does  not  give you as much increased resolution as you might
think.   A  higher resolution creates larger time and duration values which
are more difficult to edit.

Other  disadvantages  stem  from  the  design  of the KCS.  The program was
designed  to  use  the time between clock steps to do work to get ready for
the  next time step.  If the time steps are too close together, the program
will  not always be able to do this work.  The program was also designed to
play  the  lower  numbered  tracks or sequences before the higher numbered.
This order is preserved even when tracks are copied to a sequence.  You can
thus  improve  timing  of  critical  parts  by  putting  them on the lowest
numbered  tracks  or  sequences.   If the time steps are so close toghether
that  the program has not finished with the previous time step before it is
supposed to start the next, this advantage will be lost.

When  in  Track  mode,  timing  accuracy  may be affected slightly by mouse
movement  and  placement.   Generally speaking, if you have critical timing
requirements,  you  should avoid moving the mouse while in Track mode, and,
on the ST, keep the mouse away from any active display areas on the screen,
such  as  the measure/step counter or the activity displays.  We have never
found  a  need  to  do this, but if you are a perfectionist and are working
with a high resolution clock, these steps may be helpful.

The real time clock is derived from the same clock used to step through the
sequencer.   Thus,  when  an  external  clock is in use, the program has no
direct  knowledge  of  the tempo - so the calculations used to maintain the
real  time  clock  are based on the TM, AC and DC events within a sequence.
This  might  seem to be an inherently inaccurate method for calculating the
time,  but  as long as the external clock source is a SMPTE or similar sync
signal  (such  as that generated by our Model S synchronizer) that was laid
down  using  the  same  tempo  changes,  the results are excellent.  In our
measurements,  we  have  found  the  accuracy of this method to be around 1
second  in  4  hours using the same computer as the clock source, though in
real  life the accuracy of the clock will be limited by the accuracy of the
tape deck's motors.  The tempo events in a piece are also used to calculate
the real time clock value when chasing a cue point, either in response to a
MIDI  song pointer message or to selecting a "play from cue" operation, and
to  interpolate  between  MIDI  clocks when synchronizing to an external 24
PPQN  clock  (for instance) while using a higher internal clock resolution.
Since MIDI song pointer messages are quantized in units of six clock steps,
the  time and tempo calculation routines used for these purposes by the KCS
expect  to  see  TM,  AC,  and DC events auto-corrected to a six step grid.
Otherwise, timing inaccuracies will result.

The  longest  single  rest  (DE event) that the program can record is 65535
steps, which corresponds to about 683 bars at 96 steps/measure.  If you are
recording  a  part that begins more than this number of steps into a track,
the  part  will play 65536 steps earlier than you expect, and you will have
to put extra rests in from the edit screen.

Syncing to Tape
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you  are  using  a  sync  to tape box such as our Model S or the Roland
SBX80, we suggest that you mute all tracks, sequences, or channels when you
lay down the sync tone.  The reason for this is that, when the sequences is
playing  a full set of sequences, the MIDI data st5ream is pretty busy, and
the  timing  of  individual  clock  messages  may be affected slightly.  By
muting  all  sequences, we allow the computer tofunction strictly as a very
expensive  but  deadly  accurate  MIDI  clock  source, which is all that is
needed  when  laying  down  a  sync tone.  However, be sure NOT to mute the
conductor  track in Track mode, or any Open mode sequences that contain TM,
AC,  or  DC  events, as this will eliminate all your tempo changes from the
sync track!

The exact procedure for recording a sync tone will depend on your sync box,
but  the  basic  method  is  as  follows.   First,  set up the sequencer as
described above, then start the tape recorder.  After it has run for a bit,
start  the  sequencer.   When  the song has finished, stop the recorder and
rewind the tape.  (You might want to let the clock run on for a while after
the  song  ends, in case you decide to lengthen the song later.) Now unmute
all  the  previously  muted  tracks or sequences, set the sequencer's clock
source  to  MIDI  (or  MIDI W SONG POINTER.  if your sync box supports this
feature)  on  the  SET OPTIONS screen, and patch the MIDI clock output from
the  sync  box  into  the  computer's MIDI input.  From here on, everything
should function as described in your sync box manual.

Sending System Exclusive Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
System  exclusive  messages,  which most MIDI hardware manufacturers use to
communicate  patch  data  and  other non-standard message types, can be set
from the KCS using single byte events.

For many shorter messages, the single byte events can be simply inserted in
the  sequence without any adjustments to the remainder of the sequence, but
for  longer messages such as data dumps, it may be necessary to add time to
the sequence after the message, to allow the KCS to "settle".  For example,
it  takes  about  1 second to send a 3000 byte sysex message.  This message
should  all  be  sent  on one time step (that is, each event in the message
should  have a TIME value of zero) since the receiving instrument may react
strangely  if  delays  are inserted into the message.  While the message is
being  sent, the sequencer is accumulating a "backlog" of other messages to
be  sent  (MIDI  clocks,  note  messages,  etc.)  which  will  all  be sent
immediately after the sysex message as the sequencer tries to catch up with
itself.   For  this  reason,  it's a good idea to put a dead space, with no
activity  in  eiher the sequence itself or any synchronized instruments, in
the song immediately following any large sysex messages.

The  KCS  can directly record system exclusive messages of up to 5000 bytes
if  the  SYSEX  button  on  the SET OPTIONS page is active.  Sometimes bulk
dumps  (which  may  be  longer  than this limit) may consist of a series of
shorter sysex messages.  These will be recorded properly if each individual
message does not exceed this limit.  For larger messages, the public domain
program  DRTSYSEX.PRG  (ST  only),  which  can be found on a number of MIDI
related  bulletin  boards, can be used to converert sysex messages of up to
32K bytes into sequence files.

To  record  a  sysex  data  dump  from a MIDI instrument, turn on the SYSEX
button  on  the  SET  OPTIONS  screen, and select an Open mode sequence for
recording.    Following  the  instructions  in  your  instrument's  manual,
initiate  a data dump forom the instrument's front panel.  If everything is
working  properly,  the sequencer will start to record immediately, and the
word  SYSEX  will  appear on the screen as the name for that sequence.  The
sequencer's  clock  may  pause  momentarily while long data dumps are being
recorded.

If  you  have  an  instrument  that does not allow sending sysex data dumps
directly  from  its front panel, it may be possible to initiate a data dump
by  sending  a  "dump request" message to the instrument from the Open mode
record  screen, while recording the data dump in an Open mode sequence.  Be
sure  that  your dump request sequence is set to play only once; otherwise,
strange  behavior  will certainly result.  Synths which require handshaking
during sysex dumps, such as Casio and some Roland instruments, will need to
have  delays  inserted  a  certain  points  in  the dump request.  See your
owner's  manuals for details on dump requests, and please don't call us for
help with specific instruments!

Transferring Sequences from Other Sequencers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you  are  upgrading  to  the  Keyboard Controlled Sequencer from a less
powerful hardware or software sequencer, you might be wondering if you will
have  to  redo  all the work you've done on your old sequencer, to play the
same  music  on  the KCS.  Fortunately, transferring sequences into the KCS
from  another  instrument is quite simple.  Essentially, we treat the older
sequencer  as a keyboard player with a built in MIDI clock, and let it play
into the KCS while we record.

First,  set the external sequencer to send MIDI clock, and disable looping,
if possible.  If you can't turn looping off on the external sequencer, make
sure you have a blank sequence available in that machine.  The tempo of the
external  sequences  can  usually  be  set  to  its  maximum  value with no
problems, which is handy if you have a lot of sequences to transfer; but be
careful  when  transferring  dense  music, since minor timing discrepancies
might occur due to MIDI data logjams.

On  the  KCS,  set  the  clock  source  to  MIDI,  enable  the recording of
controllers  and  aftertouch,  and turn MIDI MERGE on.  ECHO should be off,
and  you will probably want to leave FILTER off as well, unless you want to
record  one channel at a time.  QUANTIZE should be off, and ALIGN should be
on.

Now  go to the Track or Open mode record screen, as you prefer, and you are
ready  to  record  material  from  the original sequencer.  If recording in
Track  mode,  be  sure not to set the length of all tracks.  You can either
record  a  single  sequence,  pattern, segment, whatever, from the external
device,  or  an  entire song.  We usually prefer to record single sequences
from  the external device in Open mode, and then string them together using
control  sequences or Song mode.  Once a sequence is recorded in Open mode,
it  is  a simple matter to bread it into individual channels by copying the
sequence to Track mode.

When  you  enter  the  record  screen, ensure that recording is enabled and
press  F10  or  the  SPACE bar to start recording.  The KCS will wait for a
start  signal  from the external sequencer.  Start your song or sequence on
the  external  sequencer, and data on all 16 MIDI channels will be recorded
by  the  KCS.   If  looping is disabled on the older sequencer, then a stop
signal  will  be  sent at the end of the sequence and recording will cease.
If  looping  is turned on, then select the blank sequence mentioned earlier
after  starting  the external sequencer.  On most machines, this will cause
the  blank  sequence  to  start  as soon as the first sequence is finished.
Stop  both  sequencers  after the blank sequence starts.  In this case, you
will  undoubtedly  need  to  remove  some time from the end of the recorded
sequence  or track, to compensate for recording part of the blank sequence.
In  either case, you may also need to make slight adjustments to the timing
of the first event of the track or sequence.

Since  drum machines are nothing but stripped down sequencers with built in
sounds,  drum patterns can be transferred to the sequencer in the same way.
This allows you to keep all of your drum parts on the same disk as the rest
of a song.

For more information on transferring sequences between two instruments, see
the December 1986 issue of Music Technology.

Loopback Recording
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Loopback  recording  is  an extension of the idea of transferring sequences
from  another  sequencer; but in this case, the external device is replaced
by  a  previously recorded track or sequence in the KCS itself.  This might
seem like a strange notion at first, but there are a number of applications
for  this technique.  For example, loopback recording can be used to reduce
a  complex  control sequence to a single sequence for use within a song, or
for capturing a performance using the interactive play features of Track or
Open modes.

To  set  up  for loopback recording, connect the computer's MIDI in jack to
its  own  MIDI  out,  either  directly  or through a merger.  Set the clock
source to INTERNAL CLK.  ECHO and MIDI MERGE must very definitely be turned
off,  and  MUTE  NEW TRACKS should be on of you're in Track mode.  You will
need  to  turn  FILTER  on  if you want to record on only one channel while
listening to all channels.

From  here,  the procedure is the same as recording from a keyboard, except
that  the  KCS is providing th ekeyboard player.  Simply turn RECORD on and
start  the  sequencer.   One  way  to use this technique would be to bounce
portions of several tracks down to one trakc, while muting and unmuting the
individual  tracks  as  needed.   The  result would be a single track which
contains  only the portions of the other tracks that you want to keep.  You
could  double  portions  of  a track using loopback recording by muting the
track  in  the  appropriate places, and then merging the new track with the
original.   In  Open mode, loopback recording can be used to reduce a song,
which  may  have  evolved  from  a  few  simple  sequences  to  an ungainly
collection  of  looped and unlooped control sequences interspersed with XX,
XL,  and other events, to a more manageable single sequence.  If you prefer
to  create  songs  in real time by starting and stopping sequences from the
keyboard, loopback recording can be used to capture such a performance.

The   velocity   pedal  feature  of  Open  and  Track  modes  was  designed
specifically  for  use  with  this  technique.   As  a sequence or track is
played, it is re-recorded in another sequence or track with velocity values
processed by the velocity pedal.  When doing this, you will need to set the
filter  channel  to  the  channel  of  the  sequence or track that is being
processed with the velocity pedal, so that only that channel is recorded.

                          TROUBLESHOOTING
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While  MIDI  is  one  of  the  most  successful  and consistent interfacing
standards in the computer industry, it is still possible that certain types
of  equipment won't work well together.  Many times, what might seem like a
perfectly  reasonable  configuration won't give the expected results.  This
could  be  because you are trying to use a feature which is not implemented
on  a  particular  machine,  or because you haven't initialized your synths
correctly, or for many other reasons.

When you get into a situation like this, a MIDI data display program can be
very helpful.  You can then determine if a piece of equipment is doing what
it  is  supposed  to  do, or if the problem lies elsewhere.  A MIDI display
program  for  the Commodore 64 was published in the September 1986 issue of
Electronic  Musician,  and instructions for adapting this program to the ST
appeared in the June 1987 issue.  We're sorry, but Dr.  T's can only answer
directions  directly  regarding  the  operation  of  our  software, and not
questions  regarding the idiosyncrasies of a particular piece of equipment.
See Appendix 1 for further information on customer support.

There  are  two  general  approaches that are useful when troubleshooting a
complex  system.   you  can attempt to isolate the source of the trouble by
changing one aspect of the system at a time, or you can simplify the system
by  using  fewer  pieces  of equipment or program features.  You should try
both  approaches when confronted with a problem in the use of the software.
Don't  forget  the  Doctor's  prescription  for dealing with MIDI technical
problems,  REXMAN  (Relax, EXperiment, and read your owner's MANuals).  The
remainder of this chapter outlines solutions to various common problems.

Program Gives Errors on Loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Does  the  computer load other programs?  If so, you might have a bad disk.
In  this  case, contact Dr.  T's to arrange for a replacement disk.  DO NOT
send  back your disk without contacting Dr.  T's for a return authorization
number.   Returned  products  which  do  not  display  such a number on the
outside of the package will be returned to the sender.  And remember, NEVER
save your data files on your KCS program disk!

Program Gives Errors While Running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you booted your Atari ST from a system disk containing disk accessories,
try re-booting from the KCS program disk.

If  you  are  using  an  Amiga, it is possible that some other programs may
cause  problems  when  run  concurrently with the KCS.  Try eliminating all
other  programs from the Amiga's memory, or re-booting from the KCS program
disk.   We  are  interested in hearing about any problems you may have when
multi-tasking  the  KCS  with  another  company's  product,  but  we cannot
guarantee that we will be able to solve the problem.

Computer Appears to be Dead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adjust  your  monitor settings and check for a loose monitor cable.  is the
disk drive on and is the drive cable OK?  Is the mouse properly inserted in
the  correct  jack?   Try  turning the computer's power off for at least 15
seconds,  then  re-boot.  This forces the computer to completely clear it's
memory.

Instruments Do Not Respond
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First  check  to see that all your MIDI cables are connected properly, that
data  reception is enabled on each instrument, and that the correct channel
assignments are being used.

If  nothing plays at all, the program might be set to sync to a nonexistent
external clock.  check the clock source on the SET OPTIONS page.

The  program  may  have crashed.  Save your files (if possible), remove the
disk, power down or reset the computer, and then run the program again.

If a sequence or track that you've just finished recording won't play back,
use  the  edit  screen to confirm that you have acutally recorded data, and
that  it's  on  the right channel.  Check your master synth, as well as the
ECHO and FILTER settings on the SET OPTIONS screen if not.

Continuous Controllers are Recorded Incorrectly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Occasionally,  a  long  string  of  continuous controller messages, such as
pitch  bend or the modulation wheel, may be recorded as a string of program
changes  or  other incorrect message types.  This happens if the instrument
used for recording employs running status, and recording is turned on after
the  start  of  the controller motion.  When running status is used, a MIDI
status byte is sent only at the start of the controller motion, rather than
with each individual message, and if recording is enabled after this single
status byte is sent, the KCS (or any MIDI devide, for that matter) will not
interpret the subsequent data correctly.  If this happens, simply re-record
the  controller  data, but play a single note before moving the controller.
This  ensures  that  a  status  byte  will  be sent at the beginning of the
controller  motion,  and the note can be easily removed on the edit screen.
Note  that  changing the RUNNING STATUS switch on the SET OPTIONS screen of
the KCS will not help with this problem.

Some Instruments Don't Respond Correctly All the Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some  instruments  can't  respond to MIDI information at the full specified
MIDI  rate.   This  is especially true for some DX7's.  The symptom is that
the  instrument  appears  to be missing notes.  Sometimes changing programs
will  fix the problem; a more drastic action is to re-power the instrument.
Use  the  MIDI  SLOW  function in the SET OPTIONS section of the program to
slow  down the MIDI transmission rate.  Use the lowest value which provides
acceptable  results.   MIDIed  Drumulators  are  also  susceptible  to this
problem.

Sequencer Plays Back, but Notes are Garbled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using  nonstandard MIDI cables on the Atari ST's MIDI output can cause this
problem, especially if you're playing an instrument that's connected to the
computer's  MIDI  in at the same time.  Check your cables to make sure that
pins  1 and 3 are not shorted to pins 4 and 5.  Some synthesizers also have
these pins shorted together at their MIDI inputs, which will cause problems
if you are using a 5 conductor MIDI cable, though three conductor cables do
not exhibit this problem.

Are  notes  overlapping  improperly?   If an instrument is in mono mode and
notes  overlap,  the  instrument  may  not  retrigger its envelopes.  If an
instrument is in poly mode and notes of the same pitch overlap, undesirable
results might occur.  If a note ends and a new note begins in the same time
step, the new note will start before the old one ends, causing an overlap.

Sending  program  changes  too  close to a note on or off message can cause
missing  or  stuck notes on some synths.  Try moving any program changes in
the area of the affected notes.

Synthesizers Spit Out Notes at High Speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  you  loop  an Open mode sequence that contains one or more MIDI events,
all  with times of zero, the program will send these MIDI events as fast as
it can, causing your synthesizer to sound as if it's going haywire.  If you
loop  a  control sequence of length zero, and the control sequence does not
have  a  WAIT  programmed,  that  sequence  will keep restarting all of the
sequences  it  is  controlling,  and  they  will keep replaying their first
notes.   Don't  loop any sequence whose times are all zero, unless it has a
WAIT  programmed  and  a DE event at the end.  A MIDI loop condition, where
the  computer's  MIDI  out is fed back to its own MIDI in through a merger,
can also cause this to occur.

Instrument Sends Data, but Doesn't Receive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  instrument  may  not  be set to receive on the MIDI channel that it is
sending  on.   Are  your MIDI cables good?  Some sync cables look like MIDI
cables,  but  won't  work  properly  for MIDI.  Check that the synth's MIDI
receive  channel  is the same as its send channel, and that ECHO and FILTER
are set properly.

MIDI Controllers Are Not Recorded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Have  you set the KCS to record controllers?  Does this instrument send and
receive  the controllers you're using?  Some early MIDI synths, such as the
Roland  Jupiter  6, won't send control changes over MIDI.  Others, like the
Prophet  600,  must have controllers enabled from the front panel each time
the synth is turned on.  Early DX7's sent aftertouch as controller 3.

Sequencer and Drum Machine Go Out of Sync When Looping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  can occur if the length of the sequence in Open mode or of track 1 in
Track  mode is not a multiple of the length of the drum box pattern.  Check
to  make sure that the sequence ends on the first step of a measure, rather
than step 96 or some other nearby value.

If  you do not use the ALIGN feature while recording you will almost always
end  the  recording  process a little before or after the end of a measure.
On  playback  each  loop  will  put the sequence further out of sync.  When
using  ALIGN,  you  must press the F10 key DURING the last measure that you
wish  to  record.   Pressing F10 a fraction of a beat into the next measure
will  force  the  program to continue recording for another entire measure,
even  if  you  do  not  play  any  notes.   Clicking on STOP or pressing F1
immediately stops recording and defeats the ALIGN feature.

If  a  drum box is synced to the program via MIDI, it may lose timing clock
information  if  too  much  MIDI  information  is being sent.  As the piece
progresses  the  drum  machine  will go further out of sync.  Does the drum
keep  sync  when  only  playing a few sequences?  Does it play better if no
sequences  with  PB, AT or CC events are running?  Select RUNNING STATUS on
the  SET  OPTIONS  screen  may help.  Other ways around this are to use the
drum  machine  as  the master, or to have the KCS play the drums instead of
sending time to the drum machine to play its own patterns.

Synths Not Accepting Program Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some synthesizers, for example Sequential's instruments, power up in a mode
in  which  they  do  not accept program changes via MIDI.  Your synthesizer
manual  should  contain  instructions  on  how  to make them accept program
changes.   Many instruments only accept a limited range of program numbers,
and reject all others.

A Programmed Wait Does Not Occur
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sequences which call other sequences and use the WAIT feature should have a
DE  event  with  a time of zero for the last event.  If you do not do this,
you  will  encounter  problems  when  you try to chain this sequence into a
higher level control sequence.

Noticeable Time Delays Occur When Sequences Start or Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  computer  is  a  powerful,  but  finite  tool.  If you attempt to play
several  sequences  simultaneously,  which in turn each play a lot of notes
simultaneously,  the  computer  may  lag.   If  this occurs, rearrange your
sequence  structure  to reduce the amount of work the computer has to do in
one  time  step.  Edit the timing so that not as many sequence start events
occur at the same time.

Most instruments will react strangely if you try to send a patch change and
play  a  note in the same time step.  See the note on program changes under
Sequencer Plays Back, But Notes Are Garbled.

Synthesizer Not Functioning in Multi-Timbral Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some  multi-timbral  synthesizers (the Sixtrak and the CZ-101, for example)
power up in poly mode.  To use the multi-timbral feature, you must set them
to  mono  mode,  either through MIDI (see the MIDI chapter) or by following
the  instructions in your owner's manual.  The Sixtrak will always transmit
on  its basic channel, so you may need to use Local Control Off and ECHO to
record  in  real  time.   you  will  have  to use the edit screen to insert
program  changes  for  each channel recorded, as selecting a program on the
Sixtrak affects all six voices.

If a synth appears to be responding sluggishly in multi-timbral mode (short
staccato notes are lost or one note may have a rough attack), try using the
MIDI SLOW option on the SET OPTIONS screen.

                        APPLICATION NOTES
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  Chapter  contains  tips  for making better use of certain instruments
with  the  Keyboard Controlled Sequencer.  Since new equipment continues to
be  released  at  an increasing rate, it is not possible to make a complete
listing  of  products  that  will  work with the program.  Many instruments
share  design  features, so the following information may be useful even if
you do not own the instruments discussed.

Casio CZ Series
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The   Casio  CZ-101  is  a  programmable  eight  voice  polyphonic  digital
instrument.   It  can hold 32 programs (16 of these are presets and may not
be changed) or 48 programs if you buy the optional RAM cartridge.  Dr.  T's
also  has available a patch librarian/editor for the CZ, and RAM cartridges
pre-loaded with 64 of our favorite sounds.

The CZ-101 is very useful with the KCS because it can also function as four
mono  synths.   It  may  be  programmed  to  work on any four adjacent MIDI
channels,  with  each  channel  playing a different sound.  One drawback is
that there is only one output jack for the four different sounds.  You will
have to change DCA envelope levels to balance the relative volumes.

There  is  no  MIDI  thru  on  the  CZ  synthesizers, so you'll need a MIDI
junction  box  or else patch the CZ at the end of the MIDI chain.  The CZ's
are  not  sensitive  to velocity but respond well to variations in duration
because of their three 8 stage envelope generators.  you can put the CZ-101
in  mono  multi-timbral mode by pressing the SOLO button.  You can then use
the MIDI, cursor right, and up arrow buttons to select programs, or you can
select  programs from the sequencer.  Note in the multi-timbral mode the CZ
may  not  always  react  predictably.   Notes may ge chopped or missed.  If
doing  serious  recording,  you may wish to use a syncing device and record
each  Casio part in normal rather than in mono mode.  This will also depend
on  what  patches you are using and the value of the notes it is receiving.
Casio  has an "overlap" in its program calling.  A program on the Casio can
be specified with either of two numbers when selected from the sequencer.

KCS PG Value               	CZ Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
0 - 15 					Presets 1 - 16
16 - 31 					Presets 1 - 16  
32 - 47 					Internal 1 - 16
48 -	63 					Internal 1 - 16
64 - 79 					Cartridge 1 - 16
80 - 95 					Cartridge 1 - 16

The  CZ's  have  one MIDI controller conflict with other instruments.  MIDI
controller  6, which is assigned to the data slider on most instruments, is
used  for  a  tune  control  on  the CZ's, which can cause problems if data
slider information is accidentally sent to a CZ.  Another quirk of the CZ's
is  that  in Mono mode, pitch bend is only received on one channe - and not
the  basic  channel,  as you'd expect, but the most recently selected voice
channel, which is shown beside the letters VO in the Casio's MIDI display.

Korg  EX-800, Poly-800 and DW-6000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  Poly-800  and  EX-800  are  similar,  with  the  newer  EX-800 being a
keyboardless  version  of  the  Poly-8OO  with  a  few more features.  Both
machines  send  on  channel  1 and may be set to receive on any channel and
both  may  select an external MIDI clock to drive their own sequencer along
with the KCS.  The Poly 800 sends its sequence data on channel 2.

The  DW-6OOO is a 6 voice synth with 64 programmable memories.  It features
a  digital  waveform  generator  system.  The DW-6000 will send and receive
note  data,  program  change,  pitch  bend, OSC mod, VCF mod, damper pedal,
podamento switch and system exclusive messages.

Korg  instruments  use  a modifed octal numbering system to arrange patches
into "banks", as described in the MIDI chapter.

These Korg instruments neither send or receive velocity but they do respond
to  MIDI volume information.  Standard MIDI controller assignments are used
except  for  mod  wheel and breath control (controllers 1 and 2), which are
used for joystack up and joystick down on the Korgs.

MIDI Clock and Merge Boxes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  MIDI  interfaces  used  by  the Amiga and ST do not provide any inputs
other  than  MIDI  in.   If you want to sync to tape or to an external drum
machine,  you  need  a device that provides MIDI clock to the computer.  If
you  want  to be able to use the real time record features of the KCS while
syncing  to  tape, you need a device that can combine the MIDI clock signal
from  your drum machine or sync box with the MIDI output of your keyboards.
The  Yamaha  KX76 and KX88 keyboards do this automatically, and some others
may  as well.  Harmony Systems, JL Cooper and others make MIDI merge boxex,
which  merge  two  MIDI  inputs  into a single MIDI output.  Yamaha makes a
device  which  does  MIDI  merge and provides several additional continuous
controllers.   Any  of  these  will allow you to merge MIDI clock with MIDI
keyboard  data,  and newer models will simultaneously generate a MIDI clock
and merge it with data from one or more MIDI instruments.

MIDI Junction or Thru Boxes and MIDI Switcher Boxes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many companies manufacture MIDI thru boxes.  They consist of one MIDI input
and  several  MIDI  outputs, and are useful if you have several instruments
with  no  MIDI thrus.  Kamlet, 360 Systems, JL Cooper, and others make MIDI
switcher  boxes.   These  are more elaborate boxes that allow you to choose
among  several MIDI inputs for each of 8 or 10 MIDI devices.  We find these
invaluable in our setups.

Ensoniq Mirage 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  Mirage  samplwr  responds  to  vwlocity changes particularly well with
velocity  controlled ADSR's velocity sensitive oscillator mix, and keyboard
scaled  decay.   You  may  have several samples spread across the keyboard,
giving  the  impression  that  it is several instruments (although there is
only  one  audio  output).   You  can  balance  the volunle between the two
keyboard sides.  The instrument powers up in omni mode.

The  Mirage  Operating System Version 3 update adds a lot more MIDI control
to  the instrument which the KCS can address using CC events or single byte
messages.   Among  the  performance  enhancements  are  aftertouch,  breath
controller, and Local Control Off.  The Mirage can also be made to initiate
a  disk  load by sending it an appropriate program change command; see your
Mirage manual for details.

Ensoniq  ESQ1  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  ESQl  is  a very powerful eight voice multi-timbral synthesizer, which
can receive on up to nine channels simultaneously when the instrument is in
multi  mode.   Channel  assignments  are  controlled by the ESQ1's internal
sequencer.   Since  each sequence on the iESQ1 can be selected from MIDI by
sending an appropriate song select command, it is possible to re-assign the
channel that the ESQ receives on from one instant to the next.

Since  voices  are  assigned  to  channel  on  an  "as needed" basis, it is
possible  to  play  up  to  eight voices on any of the nine channels at one
time,  without  worring about which channel has how many voices assigned to
it.  The keyboard sends release velocity through MIDI, though the ESQ won't
recognize  this information.  It is also possible to push any button on the
ESQ's front panel via system exclusive messages; see the version 2.0 update
documentation for details.

Yamaha KX76 and KX88 Master Keyboards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CAUTION:   KX76's  and  KX88's  can have problems when using the MIDI merge
feature  of  the  KCS.   If you patch a KX76 or 88 to receive data from the
KCS, and then send it on to the receiving synths, and the KX76 or 88 (or at
least  ours)  receives  too  much  MIDI data at one time, it will erase its
internal memory and go back to the state it was in when it was shipped from
the factory.  Beware of MIDI loops and length 0 sequences when using a KX76
of KX88 in this manner.

Yamaha RX11 and RX15 Drum Machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  RX11  features  several variations of the most essential drums.  There
are 8 snares, 3 kicks, 3 closed hats, 2 open hats, 2 cowbells, 2 claps, and
2  rimshots.   It  is  possible  to set the instrument select, note number,
volume,  pan,  and MIDI channel assignment for each drum from the KCS using
system  exclusive  messages;  the codes for doing this are contained in the
RX11 service manual.

One  problem  with  the  RX11  is  that it can not record when wynced to an
external  device,  either  through MIDI or the tape sync input; nor will it
send  a  MIDI clock or tape sync pulse while recording.  It also "hangs up"
and  refuses  to  accept  MIDI  information  for  about  two  seconds after
receiving  a  MIDI start command, if it is set to an empty pattern or song.
For  these  reasons,  it  is  best  to  ignore the RX11's pattern recording
features  and  use  it  strictly  as  a  drum  synthesizer,  with  the  KCS
controlling the drums via MIDI note commands.  In this case, set the RX11's
clock source to EXTERNAL.

The  RX15 is similar to the RX11, but has fewer features.  There are not as
many drums, fewer patterns and only two audio outputs.  Nor does it receive
the  system  exclusive  messages that the RX11 recognizes.  One problem the
RX15  has  when  syncing to MIDI clock is that occasionally, if it receives
too much data (such as note information intended for another instrument) it
will start to miss MIDI clocks.  This causes the drum machine to lose sync,
and  the  musician  to pull his hair out.  Try activating RUNNING STATUS on
the SET OPTIONS screen.

When  calling  Dr.   T's for customer service, there are a number of things
that  you can do to help us help you, which can also save you money on your
long  distance  bill.   Here  is  a  check list of things to have ready when
calling Dr.  T's.

1. Your diskette regstration number
2. Your manual
3. Computer turned on and KCS booted
4. Any data related to the problem
5. Information on your computer's disk configuration, monitor type, printer
type, etc.
6. Paper and pencil

When  you  call  us,  we  will  walk  you  through  the program and ask you
questions  about  what  happens, so it is very important that you have this
material  at  hand when calling.  If you don't have this ready, we will ask
you  to  call  back  later  with  the  required  information.  After you've
completed  the  checklist, call us at (617) 244-1542 between 10 AM and 4 PM
Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday.
