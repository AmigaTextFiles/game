                        GETTING STARTED
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thank  you  for  purchasing  Dr.  T's Keyboard Controlled Sequencer for the
Atari  ST  or  Commodore  Amiga.   You  now  owm  the  most  powerful music
processing  program  available  at  this time.  Before reading this manual,
check  your disk directory for a file entitled README.  If one exists print
or  view  the  file  before  diving into the manual.  The file contains any
corrections  or  additions  to this manual which were made after it went to
press.  This manual is current for version 1.6 of the KCS.

If  you haven't already done so, turn to Appendix 1 of this manual and read
it  carefully.   This  appendix contains important information on obtaining
backups, warranty service, and customer support.  We have made every effort
to  test  the program and eliminate serious software bugs.  Still, there is
always  some  possibility  that  bugs  exist.   We  suggest that you become
thoroughly  familiar  wdth the program before using the sequencer on stage.
Dr.   T's  music  Software  assumes  NO RESPONSIBILlTY for losses caused by
software errors or other problems in using the program!

How to Use This Manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  Keyboard  Controlled  Sequencer  is  a program which operates in three
modes  and performs several independent, yet inter-retated, functions.  Our
philosophy  in  designing this program has been to give the musician a wide
variety  of  methods  for  creating and manipulating music while imposing a
bare  minimum, of restrictions on the form of that music.  This allows each
user to develop a unique method of creating music without regard to our own
ideas of what form the music should or should not take.

In  addition  to  this  chapter,  the  manual  contains  two short tutorial
chapters  describing  the  six  disk  operations and sequencer options, and
several   chapters  of  application  notes  and  general  information.   We
recommend  that  you  start  by  reading  this  chapter  and the tutorials,
followed by Chapter 4 (OPEN AND TRACK MODE EDITING) for more information on
editing  and  Chapter  11  (SET OPTIONS) for information on the sequencer's
operating  parameters.   Refer  to  the  other chapters as the need arises.
Once  you  become familiar with all the features of the Keyboard Controlled
Sequencer,  you  will develop your owm method of using it, depending on the
equipment you are using and your own personal approach to music.

Program Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The   Keyboard  Controlled  Sequencer  provides  three  distinct  modes  of
operation:   Track  mode,  Open  mode,  and  Song mode.  In Track mode, the
program  acts  as a 48 track tape recorder with many special functions that
make  it  far  more powerful than an actual tape deck.  Open mode is a more
generalized  sequencing  system  which  allows  for  completely independent
looping  of  up  to  128  separate  sequences.   Song mode is used to chain
sequences created Track and Open modes into complete songs much like a drum
machine.

The  three modes allow different approaches to be used for different pieces
of  music  depending  on  the  requirements of the piece or the mood of the
composer.   An  entire  song can be done in Track or Open mode without ever
going to the other two modes or a composition could be started in one mode,
edited  in  another,  and  completed  in  a  third mode.  Individual notes,
phrases  sequences  or  entire  songs can be easily transferred between the
various   modes  using  special  copy  commands,  or  with  cut  and  paste
techniques.   Sequences  and tracks can also be merged, unmerged, split, or
appended to other sequences or tracks.

Sequences and tracks can contain any type of MIDI data including note data,
continuous  controllers  pitch bend, aftertouch, system exclusive messages,
and real time commands.  Tempo changes can be added at any point in a track
or  sequence.   In  addition,  Open mode sequences can contain events which
start,  stop,  and  otherwise  influence  other  Open mode Sequences.  This
provides  a  means  for creating music of enormous complexity, or it can be
used   simply   as  an  alternate  method  for  creating  traditional  song
structures.

Each mode has its own edit and play/record screens.  While each edit screen
has  some  unique  features,  many  of the editing commands, as well as the
overall operation of the edit screens, are similar in all three modes.  The
three play screens each have their own special methods for interacting with
a sequence as it is Playlng.

Which  mode you choose for a given piece of music will depend on your level
of  familiarity with the program, as well as the requirements of the piece.
Users who are familiar with the Commodore or Apple versions of the KCS will
probably  want  to  dive  right  into  Open  mode, to take advantage of its
expanded  structuring  capabilities.   If you are new to sequencing but are
familiar  with  multi-track tape recording you may want to work exclusively
in  Track  mode until you have finished a couple of small pieces.  Once you
feel comfortable with Track mode, you can transfer your tracks to Open mode
for  assembly  into songs, either in Song mode or, after you've gained more
experience,  with  Open  mode  control sequences.  We do some or our pieces
exclusively  in Track mode, other pieces in Track and Song modes, and other
pieces using the generalized control structure of Open mode.

The  KCS  supports  a  number  of  load  and  save  operations, for maximum
flexibility  in  transferring  music  from  one file to another.  Indivdual
songs,  tracks, and sequences may be saved, all 48 tracks may be saved as a
block,  or  the  entire contents of memory .  may be saved.  MIDI files are
supported  via an external conversion program, and the settings of a number
of  important  playback and record options can be saved in an "environment"
file.   As  with  any  piece of Software, it is a good idea to periodically
save  a  copy  of your work to disk in case of an accident.  Any work which
takes  more  than  15  minutes is probable worth backing up, and you should
also  keep alternate takes of pieces in progress, as well as archive copies
of completed works.

Open Mode Sequences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A  sequence  in  Open mode may contain any type of MIDI data or commands to
start  or  stop  other  sequences.   Sequences  are divided into two types,
primary  and  secondary.  There are 35 primary sequencesc designated by the
single  numerals  1  -  9, and the letters A - Z.  Primary sequences can be
started  and  stopped  from  the  Open  mode  play  screen  by pressing the
appropriate  alphabetic  or  numeric  key.   The remaining 93 sequences are
called  secondary sequences and are designated by two digit numbers from 00
through  92.  These sequences may be started from the Open mode play screen
by  pressing  two  digits  on  the  numeric  keypad.  They playback of both
primary  and  secondary  sequences  may be independently controlled in real
tine  using  the computer keyboard, and as many sequences as desired can be
played simultaneously.

The  KCS  contains  two  reserved  sequences,  sequence  Y  and sequence Z.
Sequence  Y  is  used  from,  the  edit screen by the BACKUP function.  The
program  will  not  let  you create or edit sequence Y, but you may play or
append  an  existing sequence Y.  Sequence Z is used as an automatic backup
for certain editing functions, and is not accessible to the user.

Using the Keyboard and Mouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  Atari ST and Amiga keyboards consist of a basic typewriter layout with
a  row  of  ten  function keys above, a group of cursor control and editing
keys  to the right, and further right, a numeric keypad.  Dr.  T's Keyboard
Controlled  Sequencer uses the mouse to move the edit cursor, to access the
various  options  on  all  three edit screens, to oontrol playback from the
edit  screens,  and  to  control  playback  and  rocording  in  Track mode.
Clicking  the  left mouse button selects the option under the mouse pointer
or  places  the  edit  cursor at that point, while clicking the right mouse
button,  or  both  buttons  at once, select a play option.  When we use the
expression  *Click  the  mouse on xxx", we are asking you to move the mouse
pointer  to xxx and then to click the left button.  "Double click" means to
click the appropriate button twice in quick succession.

The  computer  keyboard  is  used  heavily  on  the various play and record
screens.   the  functions  or  the keys vary from screen to screen, and are
described  in  detail  in  Chapters  6 - 9, and summarized in the Appendix.
When selecting tracks or sequences on the play and recoed screens, numerals
on  the numeric keypad will NOT have the same effect as the numerals on the
typewriter  keyboard.   Function  keys  Fll  - F20 are accessed by pressing
SHIFT  and  Fl  -  FlO.   The  function  of  the FlO key is also duplicated
throughout  the  program  by  the SPACE bar.  In many cases, the RETURN and
ENTER  keys  will perform the same function, though there are some parts of
the  sequencer in which these keys act differently.  Such instances will be
pointed out in the manual, as well as the Appendix.

Special Note for Amiga Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fortunately  for  us  at  Dr.   T's, the Atari ST and the Amiga are similar
enough  that  no  significant changes had to be made to the program when we
ported  it from the ST to the Amiga.  Due to some slight differences in the
two  computer's  keyboards,  however,  some  of  the  keys used for control
functions in the program are not available on both computers.  In the Amiga
version  of the program, we have substituted the following keys for keys on
the Atari keyboard.

Atari ST                           Amiga
~~~~~~~~                           ~~~~~
UNDO							Right AMIGA key
INSERT						Right ALT key
CLR HOME                           Shift-DEL
Numeric (                          Numeric - (1000 only)
Numeric )                          Shift-Numeric - (1000 only)
Numeric *                          Numeric . (1000 only)
Numeric /                          Shift-Numeric . (1000 only)

Edit Windows and Dialog Boxes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When  selecting  an edit operation or some other function in the KCS, it is
often  nccessary  to  provide  additional  information to the program.  Two
methods  are  utilized  to set the parameters for these operations.  Dialog
boxes  are  an  element  of  the ST's GEM operating system, and are used to
enter  data  for  some functions in the ST version of the program, and edit
windows,  which  were  specifically  designed  for  the  KCS,  are  used by
operations requiring more than a few data entries in the ST version, or for
all operations in the Amiga version.

Dialog  boxes,  which  are  described in the manual that came with your ST,
appear  in  the  center of the screen when certain operations are selected.
The  box  will  contain  two or more edit buttons, and possibly one or more
areas for entering numeric data or text, called data fields.  Clicking on a
data field will place the cursor at the end of that field and the BACKSPACE
and  ESC keys can be used to clear the data field.  When done entering data
click  on  the  appropriate  exit  button.   If  one of the exit buttons is
heavily outlined, it can also be selected by pressing RETURN.

Some  dialog  boxes may have radio buttons as well, which are used to choose
one  of several options.  These buttons are similar to the buttons on a car
radio, because selecting one will turn the previous selection off.

Edit windows are used by moost operations which have more than two or three
options  to  setect.  Some edit windows are quite small, while one, the SET
OPTIONS  window,  occupies  the  entire  screen.   Edit  windows contain an
assortment  of radio buttons, data fields, and exit buttons but, look quite
different  from, dialog boxes.  The radio buttons are the cyan (blue-green)
text  areas which describe the various options used to turn an option on or
off  (called toggling), while others are used to select one or another of a
set  of  mutually  exclusive choices (such as one of the three clock source
options).   Whether  a  button  is  a toggle switch or a selector switch is
usually   obvious   from   context,   and   is  easily  determined  through
experimentation.

Data  may  be  typed  into the data felds, or data can be entered using the
arithmetic  strip,  which  is  a  row of red arrow and diamond icons at the
bottom  of  the  edit  window.   After clicking on a data feld, clicking on
different  parts  of  the  arithmetic  strip  will  change the value there.
Clicking  on the leftmost diamond sets the entry to its lowest legal value,
the right diamond selects the highest value, and the middle diamond selects
the  center  of that parameter's range.  Clicking on the >>> or <<< symbols
increases  or  decreases  the  entry by ten units, while > and < change the
value  by  one  unit.  The functions of each of the icons in the arithmetic
strip are duplicated by the M, <, COMMA, L, PERIOD, >' and / keys.  The CLR
HOME  key will clear a data field, which is not always the same as entering
zero.  The cursor control keys can also be used to move from one data field
to another.

The  exit  buttons for the edit windows are the white text at the bottom of
the edit wAndow.  The RETURN key duplicates OK, and the UNDO key duplicates
the CANCEL button.

Hard Disks and Multiple Programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hard  disks  can  be extremely useful in a studio or live MIDI system.  The
KCS  can  be installed on a hard disk, but the oriUnal program disk must be
inserted  in  drive  A:   on the ST, or any floppy drive on the Amiga, as a
"key  disk"  when  the program boots.  In addition to the KCS program file,
you  will  need  to  copy the files DEFAULT.ENV and DEFAULT.VRY to the hard
disk.

For Atari ST owners who would like to have more than one program, available
for  use  at  any  time,  a new feature which allows this has been added to
version  1.6 of the KCS.  The Multi Program Environment (MPE) allows you to
load  up  to  four additional Dr.  T programs into the computer at once, by
releasing  memory  normally  used for sequence storage for use by the other
programs.   Note  that  the KCS is NOT compatible wdth other programs which
perform  this  function  externally  such  as  K-Switch.  Because of memory
limitatations  when  the KCS is running the only desk accessory you may use
with the KCS is CONTROL.ACC, which was suppUed with your Atari.

In the Amiga version of the KCS, the Amiga's multi-taskung features
are fully suppoded.  Chapter 4 contains complete details. 

Equipment Hookup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Depending  on  the equipment you have, there can be several ways to connect
the  various  synthesizers,  drum machines, sync boxes, etc.  Basically you
want  to  connect your recording synth or master keyboard's MIDI out to the
computer's  MIDI  in  then  connect  the  computers  MIDI out to the master
synth's  MIDI  in.   If  you're using an Atari ST, you can connet your MIDI
cables diretly to the computer's built-in MIDI port.  If you have an Amiga,
you  can  use  any commercial or home-built MIDI interface that connects to
the  Amiga's  serial  port.   (This  includes  just  about every Amiga MIDI
interface  on  the market, wnth the notable exception of Roland's MPU 401.)
It  is considered good practce to plug the MIDI interface into the computer
before turning your system on.

If you have more than one synth, you will need to connect any additional
synths to the computer using a MIDI through jack on your master
synthesizer, if present.  Assign each instrument to its own MIDI channel,
and make sure that data reception is enabled on each instrument.  If you want
to use  drum, machine or other MIDI clock source as a master clock while
recording you will need a MIDI merger to connect the computer's MIDI input
to both devices simultaneously. 

When  connecting  your system, there are two common conditions to watch out
for  that  can  cause major headaches.  The first is a MIDI loop, caused by
routing  the  computer's  MIDI out back to its input, either through a MIDI
merger  or  a  synth  with  a  built  in merge or echo function.  The other
condition,  which  occurs  only  on  the  Atari  ST,  is caused by the ST's
slightly  nonstandard MIDI output jack.  While the MIDI spec calls for pins
1  and  3  of  a  MIDI connector to be left open, the ST uses these pins to
provide  a thru connection from the ST's MIDI in.  Normally, this would not
be  a  problem, but some manufacturers of MIDI cables also violate the MIDI
spec and short these two pins to pins 4 and 5, which carry MIDI data.  When
used  with  the ST, these cables can cause data to become garbled, so check
your cables carefully before using them.  Worse yet, some instruments short
these  pins  together at their MIDI inputs, so that even simple 5 conductor
MIDI  or  DIN  cables  can  cause  the  problem!   If seeminly correct MIDI
connections  result in playback problems, check for these conditions.  MIDI
connectors are optically coupled so a wrong connection will at worst result
in no data transmissi@on.

Running the ST KCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To  run  the  Keyboard  Controlled  Sequencer  on  the Atari ST, insert the
program  disk  in  the  disk  drive  and turn the computer on, or press the
computer's  reset button.  The desktop will appear, with the disk directory
enclosed in a window.  Double click on the icon labeled KCS16.PRG,, and the
program  will  load and run.  <Note that future versions of the program may
have  slightly different file names.) The program will come up on the Track
mode record screen.

Running the Amiga KCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  KCS  program  disk is a bootable WorkBench disk.  After the WorkBench
appears,  run  the  program  by double clicking on the large monitor-shaped
icon, or by typing KCS when in CLI.

Before  the program finishes booting a requestor box will appear, where you
may  allocate  a  portion  of  the  Amiga's free memory for use as sequence
storage.  The amount of memory reserved for the KCS is expressed in events,
where  an  event  is the equivalent of a note on/off pair, and is six bytes
long.   The  default  is 50% of the Amiga's free memory, but you may select
any  proportion  you  want.   The trade off here, of course, is that if you
allocate  all  your  memory  to  the KCS, you'll be able to store a maximum
number  of  notes  in  the  sequencer,  but  yu  won't  have as much memory
available  for  any  other programs such as patch editors.  You may want to
adjust  this  slider  differently at the start of each session depending on
how  much multi-tasking you plan to do.  This setting can't be changed once
it's  set without re-starting the KCS.  After you click on OK the program's
Track mode play/record screen will appear.

                               CHAPTER 2
                               ~~~~~~~~~
Track Mode Recording Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  purpose  of this tutorial is to familiarize the first time user of the
KCS  with  the  program's Track mode play/record screen.  The tutorial also
provides  an  introduction  to  the  Song mode edit screen, the set options
screen, and to transferring data between the three modes.

If you have a multi-timbral synthesizer system, set it up with a four voice
fuzz  guitar or similar patch on channel 1, and a two voice dynamic bass on
channel 2.  Your recording keyboard should be set to play some sort of horn
or  other  contrasting  sound  on  channel  3.   If  your instrument is not
multi-timbral, set its MIDI receive mode to Omni On/Poly.

If  your  drum machine recognizes MIDI note messages as drum hits, then set
its  mode  to Omni Off/Poly, and its channel to 16.  If it has programmable
drum key assignments, set them according to the table at the end of Chapter
12; if not, it should work as is.  If your drum machine can't be played via
MIDI, set it to sync to MIDI clock and select a plain vanilla 4/4 pattern.

Boot  the  program as described at the end of Chapter 1, and the Track mode
Play/record  screen  will appear.  If your system is connected as suggested
in  Chapter  1,  the sequencer is ready to record immediately.  (If you are
using  a  master  keyboard and a set of expander modules, you will probably
need  to  turn  on MIDI mergng by clicking the mouse on the MERGE button in
the lower right corner of the screen.)

Play  a  few notes on your recording keyboard, and the sequencer will gtart
to  record.   The metronome will start to tick, and the MIDI channel of the
first MIDI message recorded will be displayed for track 1 in the upper left
corner  of  the  screen.  Record a few bars of keyboard noodling then press
the  FlO  key.   The  sequencer  will  continue to record to the end of the
measure, and then loop back to the beginning of track 1.  The material that
you just recorded should now play back.

If  you were to continue playing on your keyboard, recording would start on
track  2,  and  both tracks would loop at the end of track 1.  This process
can  be repeated for all 48 tracks, in much the same way that drum machines
allow continuous overdub recording.

Now  click  on  the EXIT button at the bottom of the screen.  The sequencer
will stop, and the Track mode edit screen will appear.  This screen is used
for  editing tracks, and for accessing other parts of the program.  In this
case,  we  want  to  load a set of previously recorded tracks from disk, so
insert  the  KCS  program  disk  in  drive A and click on LOAD/SAVE, in the
second column of text on the right half of the screen.

The  LOAD/SAVE  dialog  box will now appear on the screen.  The .ALL button
(and  the  A:   button on the Attari) should be highlighted; if not, change
these  settings  by  clicking on the appropriate button.  Click on the LOAD
button  and a file selector box will appear.  Click on the name of the file
to be loaded (RECORTUT.ALL) followed by OK.

Once the file is loaded, the program, will return to the play/record scree,
which should now look like this:

The  play/reoord  screen  is  divided into two major sections:  the control
panel  at  the bottom of the screen, and the track status area, at the top.
Thc  control  Panel  contains  buttons  for  the  most important Track mode
recording  functions, and there is a set of hidden controls for lesser used
runctions.   The status area shows the status and name of each of the first
36  tracks.   A  message  line at the bottom of the screen diplays messages
regarding the status of various hidden controls, and other information.

Click  the  mouse  on  the  PLAY button to start the sequencer.  Six of the
eight  tracks  in  use  will  start  to  play.   The RECORD button is still
highlighted,  which  indicates  that  the sequencer is ready to record.  We
won't  bem  recording  anything  for  a  while,  so click on this button to
disable recording.

The  control panel contains other buttons which correspond to controls on a
tape  deck.   The  PLAY,  STOP,  and  PAUSE  buttons  perform  the  obvious
functaons,  and  the << and > > icons next to the CLOCK display are used to
change  the  sequencer's  tempo,  or  speed.   All  of  these  controls are
activated  by  left  clicking on them, just as if they were actual physical
buttons.   Experiment with these controls then return the sequencer to PLAY
status at a comfortable tempo.

Click the mouse on the display for track 1 in the status area, and the word
MUTE will appear on that line, and the track will be silenced.  Clicking on
the  track  again,  or  pressing  the  1  key  on  the computer's typewiter
keyboard, will unmute the track.

Note  that  the  MUTE button is highlighted.  If MUTE is on, then selecting
any  track,  either  with the mouse or by pressing a track key will mute or
unmute that track.  The track keys are single keys on the computer keyboard
which  correspond to one of the 48 tracks, and are listed in the right hand
column  under  TRACK in the status area.  Experiment with the MUTE function
on  the  other tracks, using the mouse and the track keys.  (You might want
to avoid unmuting track 6 at this point, as his track is in a different key
than the others.)

After  you  get a feel for muting tracks, return each track to its original
MUTE  status (see the screen shot earlier in this chapter) and unmute track
4.   This  track  is  a slight variation on track 5, and doesn't contribute
anything of interest, yet.

Hold  down  the SHIFT key and press F1.  The MUTE light will go off and the
words "SHIFT 1" will appear on the message line.  Click on track 4, and the
hi-hat part will be augmented by a slightly delayed version of itself.

Click  on  track  4  again to increase the delay time.  At this setting, it
sounds  less  like  an intentional delay and more like slop, so let's shift
the  track  back  one  step.  Press SHIFT and F4, and the message line will
change  to  SHIFT  1.   Click on track 4 once, to return it to its slightly
delayed position.

MUTE,  SHIFT  1,  and  SHIFT  - 1 are all part of a set of functions called
track  options.  A track option determines what will happen to a track when
it  is  selected  with  the mouse or its track key.  There are over a dozen
different  track  options, but only one can be turned on at any time.  Some
track  options  can be selected on the control panel, while others can only
be  selected  from the computer's keyboard.  Another important track option
which  can be accessed from the control panel is the SOLO option.  Click on
the  SOLO  button,  and  experiment  with  the  track option on each track.
Select  MUTE  when  you have soloed every track and they will all return to
their originl statuses.

Now  let's  copy  these  tracks  into  Open  mode  sequences, which will be
assembled  into  a  song  in Song mode.  The ALL TRACKS TO; SEQ Option will
copy  all  unmuted  tracks  into  a  specified sequence.  By muting various
combinations of tracks and copying all tracks to a number of sequences it's
possible  to  build  sections  of  a  song in Track mode.  We will use this
technique to make a short song from these tracks.

Stop  the  sequencer,  and  mute  tracks  1,  2  4,  6, and 8.  Press the !
(SHIFT-1)  key,  and  an  edit window labeled COPY TO SEQUENCE will appear.
This window allows you to specify a sequence number, name, and comments for
the  sequence.   (For  the moment, ignore the INCLUDE MUTED TRACKS button.)
The  sequence  number  defaults to the lowest empty sequence (in this case,
sequence 2), and the comments field will show a list of the unmuted tracks.
Cllck on OK or press RETURN to copy the unmuted tracks (tracks 3, 5, and 7)
into sequence 2.

Now, using the method described in the last paragraph copy the following
track combinations into sequences 3 to 8: .

Mute tracks 1, 2, 4, and 6, and copy the other tracks into sequence 3. 

Mute tracks 1, 4, and 6, and copy the other tracks into sequence 4,

Mute tracks 4 and 6, and copy the other tracks into sequence 5. 

Mute track 6 only and copy the other tracks into sequence 6. 

Mute tracks 1 and 6, and copy the other tracks into sequence 7. 

Mute tracks 1, 5, and 8, and copy the other tracks into sequence 8. 

Now  that  we've  created  the parts to our song we can go to Song mode and
chain  them into a song.  Click on SONG MODE on the Track mode edit screen,
and  the Song mode edit screen will appear.  Songs are created by typing in
entries  in  the  event  list, the large empty area on the left side of the
screen,  The  small  square  in  the upper left corner of the event list is
called the edit cursor, and determines where data entry and editing occurs.

The  number  or  letter in the column labeled SEQ determines which sequence
will  play.   Type  2 on the computer keyboard, and note the changes on the
screen.   The  white box shows the valid area for cursor placement, and the
columns  to  the  right  of  the  SEQ  column  are  used  to  enter  tempo,
transposition,  and other information.  Use the cursor control keys to move
the  cursor  to the right end of the box, and type 2 under REP, followed by
RETURN.

In the same way type in the number shown in the following screen shot.  Use
the  UNDO key to erase mistakes before pressing RETURN, or use the mouse to
place the edit cursor over your mistake and type in the corrected data on a
previously  entered  line.   The NAME column will remain blank as you enter
each  sequence, though if we had named the sequences when creating them the
names would appear at this point.

The  numbers  in  the  SEQ column indicate which sequence will be played at
that  point  in  the  song.   TRN  specifies  a pitch transposition for the
sequence,  in  half  steps,  and REP shows how many times the sequence will
repeat.   Once  the  song  is complete, it can be played from the Song mode
play  screen;  but  since  this  is a Track mode tutorial, we will use Song
mode's  SONG TO ALL TRACKS option, which will erase all tracks and create a
new  set  of tracks that are the equivalent of the song.  This will be much
longer  than  the original tracks, and will allow us to overdub tracks that
are the length of the entire song.

Before  coping  the song to all tracks, there is one minor adustment to the
sequencer's  operating parameters that must be made.  Click on SET OPTIONS,
and  a large edit window will appear.  A number of different parameters can
be set from this screen, but for the moment, we are only interested in one,
DRUM  CHANNEL,  on the right side of the screen.  The space to the right of
this  button displays the drum channel.  Click on this space, then click on
the  rightmost  diamond in the arithmetic strip at the bottom of the window
to  set  the  drum  channel to 16.  Press RETURN or click on OK to exit the
edit  window.  Setting a channel to drum channel status tells the sequencer
not to transpose that channel, which would change each drum to another drum
if  applied  to a MIDI drum part.  Since sequence 8 is transposed each time
it's  played  in this song the drum channel must be set to 16 BEFORE coping
the song to all tracks to protect the drum parts on channel 16.

Click  on  SONG TO ALL TRACKE, and a dialog box will appear to confirm your
choice.   After  clicking  on  OK,  the  program will take a few seconds to
create  the  new  tracks.   When  the  working  message disappears from the
message line, click on TRACK MODE.

When the Track mode play/record screen appears note that the eight original
tracks  have  been compressed into four tracks - one for each channel used,
and  a  "conductor"  track  (track  1) which sets the length of all tracks.
Click on the PLAY button, and the song will start to play.

With  the  song "stretched out" into four song tracks it is now possible to
overdub  tracks that are the length of the entire song.  This allows you to
add  parts that are not locked into the repetitious patterns created by the
original tracks such as lead lines and drum fills.

The  exact  set  up  for  recording  tracks  will  vary  depending  on  the
keyboard/sound  generator  arrangement you are using.  For the rest of this
tutorial,  we  will assume that your recording keyboard is a single channel
synthesizer  such  as  a  DX7  or  a  Mirage.   If you are using some other
arrangement  see the sections on MIDI MERGE, ECHO, and Local Control OFF in
Chapters  6  and  12,  as  well as your owner's manuals, for information on
configuring your system.

Before  starting  to record, click on the CNTRLRS button.  This enables the
recording  of  MIDI  controller  infonmation  such as pitch beet modulataon
wheel, and sustain pedal movement.  Play along with the sequencer until you
get  an  idea  of  what you'd like to record then click on RECORD, and play
your part.

Chances are, the first track that you record will not be to yur liking.  In
this  case, click on RE-RECORD; the track you are recording will be erased,
the  sequencer  will  stop,  and you can sart over.  Once you've recorded a
good take, you will be ready to record another track in the same way.

By  now,  you  should have a good idea of the basic technique of Track mode
recording  on  the  KCS.   The Track mode play/record screen has many other
features which have not been discussed here.  At this point, you might want
to  record  a  short  picce  of  your  own, referring to Chapter 6 for more
detailed  information  on the recording process:  or continue with the Open
mode  editing  tutorial  for  a  look  at  how  the  sequencer  stores  and
manipulates musical data.

                               CHAPTER 3
                               ~~~~~~~~~
Open Mode Editing Tutorial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  purpose  of this tutorial is to familiarize the first time user of the
KCS with the program's Open and Track mode edit screens.  The tutorial also
provides introductions to the program's representations of various types of
musical  events,  and  to creating and editing control sequences.  The "raw
material"  for  the  editing tutorial consists of three previously recorded
sequences, which are to be loaded from disk.

If you have a multi-timbral synthesizer system, set it up with a buzzy clav
voice  on  channel  1,  a bass on channel 2, and some type of reed or fluid
lead  synth sound on channel 3.  If your synth isn't multi-timbral, set its
MIDI  receive  mode to Omni On/Poly.  If you have a drum machine, set it to
synchronize  to MIDI clock, disable the reception of MIDI channel messages,
and select a simpIe 4/4 pattern.

Now boot the program as described at the end of Chapter 1, and you will see
the  Track  mode  record  screen.   Since  we  will  be  editing  Open mode
sequences,  the  first step is to move to the Open mode edit screen.  Click
on the EXIT button in the lower left part of the screen, and the Track mode
edit screen will appear.

The  Track  mode  edit screen is very similar to the Open mode edit screen,
but  only  tracks can be edited in Track mode, not sequences.  On the right
side  of  the  screen is a list of editing options.  Click on the OPEN MODE
option,  in  the  lower  right  corner,  and the Open mode edit screen will
appear.

Now the sequences to be edited must be loaded in from the disk.  Place your
program  disk  in  the disk drive, and click on the LOAD/SAVE option on the
right  half  of the screen.  A dialog box will appear, and will ask you for
the  file  type  you  wish  to access, the drive to use, and what action to
perform!.   Confirm that the sequence type selected is .ALL and that the A:
drive  is  selected  if  you're  using  an  Atari.   If  not,  change these
selections  by  clicking on the appropriate box.  Click on LOAD, and a file
selection box will appear.

Click on teh name of the file to be loaded (EDITTUTR.ALL) and click OK.

Once the file is loaded, the program will return to the
edit screen which should now look like This:

The  edit screen is divided into two major sections:  the edit options area
on the right side of the screen, and the event list on the left half of the
screen.   The  event  list  displays  the  actual  data  which makes up the
sequence, and the edit options are used to select editing operations, or to
move  other  parts  of  the  program.   There is also a message line at the
bottom  of  the screen, which displays information and prompts when an edit
option  is  selected, and a set of select boxes below the edit options, for
moving to another sequence.

The  edit  cursor,  the  small solid square in the upper left corner of the
event  list, is used to select an event for editing or to set the beginning
or  end  of  a  range of events.  It can be moved to any point in the event
list  by  clicking  on the ncw position, or it can be moved with the cursor
control  keys.   Practice moving the cursor around the screen with both the
mouse and the cursor control keys.

The  edit  screen can only display 21 events at a time:  other parts of the
event  list  can  be  accessed  by  scrolling through the list with the red
scroll arrows, located on the left edge of the event list.  Clicking on any
of  the  top  three sets of arrows will move the diplay window up the event
list,  and  clicking  on  the  lower  sets  moves the window down the list.
Clicking  on the scroll diamonds above or below the scroll arrows will move
the  window  to  the  top  or bottom of the event list, and clicking on the
middle diamond will cause continuous scrolling.  Practice scrolling through
the event list with these controls then return to the top of the list.

Before  editing  sequencc 1, we want to play it through a few times to hear
what  it  sounds  like.   Double click the right mouse button, and the Open
mode  play  screen will appear.  Press the 1 key on the typewriter keyboard
and sequence 1 should start playing on MIDI channel 1.  After listening for
a bit, return to the edit screen by pressing F1.

Sequence  1  sounds  interesting, but is too repetitive, and is out of sync
with  the  drum  machine  and metronome.  To correct these problems we will
adjust  the  timing  of the sequence, shorten it, and make a few changes to
the second repetition of the sequence.

Before doing any editing on the sequence, it's a good idea to make a backup
copy Click on BACKUP, and a confirmation message will appear in the message
line.  Clicking on GET BACKUP will swap the backup and the edited sequence,
for  qufck comparisons.  After you're sure you're done an editing operation
correctly,  make  a  new  backup  so  that you won't have to redo the whole
tutorial if you accidentally mangle the sequence.

The  timing  of  the  sequence is controlled by the data in the TIME field,
which  is the third column in the event list.  Each entry in the TIME field
represents  the  number  of clock steps which go by before the remainder of
that  event occurs.  One quarter note equals 24 clock steps so a TTME value
of  12  means  that an eighth note's worth of time goes by before the first
note  in  this  sequence  piays;  in other words this sequence starts on an
offbeat,  namely the second haaf of the first beat of the measure.  This is
why the sequence doesn't sync properly with the metronome.

Place  the  edit cursor over the first digit of the first value in the TIME
field,  type  a  space,  and  look  at the screen.  The white box which now
outlines the first event indicates the data that can be edited.  The CURSOR
LEFT  and  CURSOR RIGHT keys, as well as the TAB and SHIFT-TAB keys@ can be
used  to  move the edit cursor within the box; experiment with these keys a
bit,  then place the cursor over the 2 in the TIME field, type 0, and press
RETURN (not ENTER).

When  RETURN  is  pressed  all the entries in the MSR-ST field will change.
This  field  marks  the location of each event in measures and clock steps.
Note  that  the MSR-ST field now reads 1-1 for the first event, which means
that the first note now occurs on the first step of measure one.

Since  the  essential  theme of this sequence repeats every measure, we can
delete  all  but the first measure of the sequence.  The first event of the
second  measure  is event 13; the event number is listed in the EVNT field.
Click  on  event 13, then while holding the left mouse button down move the
mouse  pointer  all  the  way down to the area between the end of the event
list  and  the  message  line.   The list will scroll down when the pointer
moves  below  the  event  list;  when  the highlight reaches the last event
(event  43)  in  the  sequence,  release the mouse button.  The highlighted
region  has  now  been selected for editing.  (You may need to "jiggle" the
mouse a bit at the end of the event line, to highlight event 43.)

The highlighted portion of the sequence can be played by clicking the right
ouse  button.   Do  this  now  and note that the measure/step display and a
message appear at the bottom of the Screen.

Now  click  on  DELETE in the edit options area.  A dialog box will ask for
the  range of notes to be deleted, which defaults to the range that we just
selected.   To delete the selected range, click on OK.  Clicking on UNDO at
this point will swap the sequence with a backup copy that was automatically
created  as  part of the DELETE operation.  Click on UNDO again to retrieve
the edited version.

Return  to  the  Open  mode  play  screen by double clicing the right mouse
button,  and press 1 on the typewriter keyboard.  The sequence starts okay,
but loses sync at the start of the first repetition; something is obviously
not  right.   Press Fl to return to the edit screen and look at the data in
the  MSR-ST field.  The sequence ends on measure 1, step 85, which makes it
84  steps long; but a full measure of 4/4 time at 24 steps per quarter note
is  94  steps.   The  sequence  must  be  extended by 12 steps if it[ is to
synchronize properly with the drum machine.

To  add  an  event to the end of the sequence, place the cursor in the TIME
field  immediately  below  the  last event in the list, and enter 12.  Move
over to the TYP field and type DE.  The screen should now look like this:

The  data  on the TYP field indicates the event type.  All the events up to
this  point  have been ON events, which represent note on and off messages.
ON  events  make  up  the  majority  of  most sequences.  The DE event is a
"deleted  event",  a dummy event in which nothing occurs except the passage
of  time.  When used at the end of a sequence, it sets a time delay between
the  occurrence  of the previous event, and the start of the next sequence.
Press RETURN, go to the play screen and play sequence 1.  Everything should
sync properly now.

Upon  listning  to  the  sequence,  it  seems that it might make a bit more
musical  sense  to double its length and make a slight change to the second
half.   We'll  do this by first copying part of the sequence into the paste
buffer, and then pasting it at the end of the original sequence.

Since  there  is  no  need  to duplicate the DE event, we only need to copy
events  1  to 12 into the paste buffer.  Place the edit cursor on event l2,
and highlight the events from 1 to 12 by holding the left mouse button down
and  moving the mouse pointer to event 1.  (This is known as "dragging" the
mouse).   Click  on COPY and an edit window will appear on the screen.  The
default  parameters  will  work  for this operation, so click on OK.  These
events are now stored in the paste buffer.

Move  the  edit  cursor  to event 13, and click on PASTE.  A rather complex
edit  window  will  appear  for  the  moment,  just  confirm that INSERT is
selected in the upper left corner, and enter 12 for FIRST EVENT TIME.  This
is  to  made up for the DE event and its associated TIME value that weren't
copied.   Click  on OK and move to the end of the event list by clicking on
the bottom scroll diamond.  The screen should now look like this:

If  your  sequence doesn't end with a DE event on MSR-ST 3-1, retrieve your
backup copy and go through the cut and paste proeedure again.

The  last  step  in  editing  sequence  1 is to make a slight change in the
second  measure  by  erasing the last note in the sequence.  Place the edit
cursor on event 24, and click on ERASE.  When the dialog box appears, click
on  OK to erase event 24.  ERASE is similar to erasing a small section of a
tape  recording and doesn't affect the timing of the sequence, while DELETE
is  more  like  cutting  out  a  piece  of  the tape, since the sequence in
shortened when events are deleted.

Now double click the right mouse button to go to the Open mode play screen,
and  start  sequence 1.  While the sequence is running press the DELETE key
the  word  ALIGN will appear on the screen.  Watch the measure-step display
and,  while  the  measure  is  an  even  number,  press 2 on the typewriter
keyboard.   This  will  start  sequence 2 at the start of the next measure.
This  simple three note bass line fits with sequence 1, but the timing is a
bit rough.

Return  to  the  edit  screen and move to sequence 2 by clicking on the box
labeled  2  at the bottom of the right part of the screen.  Note that while
the  TIME  values in sequence 1 were all multiples of six, this is not true
for sequence 2.  This can be fixed with the AUTO-CORRECT option.

Click  on  TRANSPOSE/AUTO  in the edit options area and an edit window will
appear.   This  is  where most of the data maniplation operations are done.
Click  on  AUTO-CORRECT  and confirm that 6 is entered in the space next to
AUTO-CORRECT.   When  this  is  done, click on OK at the bottom of the edit
wndow.   The  sequence  is  now  auto-corrected; the four values under TIME
should be 0, 192, 6, and 186.

Now  let's  return  to  the  play screen and cue sequences 1 and 2 to start
together.   First press the DELETE key to align the sequences, and then ESC
to  pause  the  sequencer.  The word PAUSE will appear above ALIGN; press 1
and  2  to  select these sequences, and press ESC a second tune to turn off
PAUSE and start the sequencer.  After listening to this for a bit, wait for
an  even  numbered  measure and press 3 on the typewriter keyboard to start
sequence 3.  This lead line was recorded using quite a bit of mod wheel and
foot  pedal  motion,  perhaps too much:  but the notes themselves are okay.
The best thing to do is probably to strip the controller data from the note
data and to re-record the controllers at a later time.

Return  to  the  edit  screen  by  pressing  Fl.  Sequence 3 looks a little
different  from  the  earlier  sequences  because of the mod wheel and foot
pedal data it contained.  The CC events represent data from these and other
continuous controllers.  The value under NOTE is the MIDI controller number
for  that  event (1 for mod wheel, 4 for foot pedal), and that under VEL is
the  value  of  that controller.  Scroll through the sequence, and note two
facts:   first,  that  continuous  controllers use up much more memory than
notes do, and second, that the many CC events make it difficult to view and
edit the ON events.

CC events can be deleted from a uequence using the ERASE CNTROLLERS option,
which   is   reached   from  the  TRANSPOSE/AUTO  edit  window.   Click  on
TRANSPOSE/AUTO,  followed  by  ERASE CONTROLLERS and OK.  Sequence 3 should
now look like this:

The  note  data  from  the  lead  synth part is much easier 3 read with the
controlier data eliminaned, and can be edited more easily as well.

Now  that we've got all three parts edited, let's combine them into a short
song.   This as done using primary sequence start events in a separate Open
mode  sequence  known as a control sequence.  Primary sequence start events
are  represented in the event list by the number or letter of the sequence,
and  the  NOTE,  VEL,  and  DUR  fields  are  used  to  indicate  the pitch
transposition,  velocity  transposition,  and  number  of  repeats for that
sequence.

We will create the control sequence in sequence A, which doesn't exist yet,
and  therefore  is  not shown in the select boxes at the bottom of the edit
options  area.  To get to a sequence that isn't shown here, click on the **
symbol in the last select box and enter A in response to the prompt.  Place
the  cursor  on  the  single  DE event, and press the INSERT key.  When the
white  box  appears, type in the following data, pressing RETURN after each
line  and  moving  the  edit cursor up or down with the cursor control keys
after the last line.

MSR	ST	EVNT	TIME		CH TYP	NOTE	VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	0			1	0	-20	2W
1-	1	2	0			1	0	  0	4
1-	1	3	0			2	0	  0	2W
1-	1	4	0			3	0	  0	1
1-	1	5	0			1	0	  0	2W
1-	1	6	0			2	0	  0  12W

The  W's  in the the duration fields are WAIT flags which cause playback of
the  control  sequence  to  wait  until  the  sequence in that line is done
playing.   In this example, starting sequence A will pause until sequence 1
finishes  its  two  repetations.   After waiting for the TIME value of zero
steps,  sequences  1 and 2 will start and run for 2 repetitions of sequence
2;  after  which  sequences 1, 2 and 3 will start together.  the -20 in the
VEL  field  for  event  1  causes sequence 1 to play its note velocities 20
units lower than normal.

This  sequence  can  be played from the Open mode play screen just like the
others were, but there is another method for playing sequences that is more
convenient  when  editing.   Place  the edit cursor on the first event, and
click  the right mouse button; the sequenoc will play from the first event.
Clicking  the  left  button  will  stop  the sequence.  The sequence can be
played  from  any  event  by placing the edit cursor on that line and right
clicking which makes it easier to listen to just part of the sequenoe.

This  tutoril  has  by  no  means  covered  the  full range of edit options
available  on  the  KCS,  but  you  should  now be familiar enough with the
sequencer  operaton  to  get  started  making  some music.  More details on
editing can be found in Chapter 4.

                           CHAPTER 4
                           ~~~~~~~~~
Open and Track Mode Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Open mode and Track mode edit screens let you make individual or global
changes  to  pitch,  duration,  velocity,  MIDI channel, and timing for all
notes  in  a  sequence or track.  Notes and other MIDI events can be edited
individually, copied to another sequence or track.  New events can be typed
in  from the computer keyboard, or can be entered in step time using a MIDI
keyboard  in  conjunction  with the computer's keyboard.  In many ways, the
KCS;s  edit  screens  act  as  a  word  processor  designed  for music.  In
addition, the edit screens are used to access the computer's disk drive(s),
to  set the sequencer's operation options, and to move from one mode to the
next.

The edit screens for Open and Track modes are quite similar, though each
mode has a few commands not shared by the other mode.

The edit screen is divided into four sections: the event list on the left
half of the screen, the edit options on the right side, the message line at
the bottom of the screen, and the select boxes, below the edit options. The
event list displays up to 21 events (notes, program changes, control
changes, etc.) of the currently selected sequence or track, and is where
the actual editing takes place. The edit options section is used to select
which editing operation is to be performed, and also contains options for
selecting a new track or sequence, changing modes, setting the sequencer's
operating parameters, and exiting the program. The message line is used to
display messages about certain editing options, and to ask for more
information about other options. The select boxes are used to select a
different sequence or track.

There are two cursors on the edit screen: the mouse pointer, and the edit
cursor. The mouse pointer indicates the current position of the mouse, as
in all ST and Amiga programs, while the edit cursor indicates the point at
which editing will take place, or from which playback will begin if the
right mouse button is clicked.

The Event List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  event  list  consists  of  five editable data fields; two fields whose
contents  are  determined  by the program, and a set of icons for scrolling
though the list.  Here is a description of each of the fields:

MSR-ST:  The measure and step at which the event occurs.  For example, 2-13
means  the thirteenth step of measure two.  This is computed by the program
and cannot be changed.

EVNT:   The number of the event.  EVNT is used to specify a range of events
in the sequence or track when you are using the various edit options.  This
is also computed by the program and cannot be changed.

TIME:   The time at which this event occurs in relation to the start of the
previous  event.  Time is measured in steps of the internal or MIDI clock.
Changing  the  current  value will move this event and all subsequent events
forward  or  backward in time (with the exception of entries followed
by  the  ENTER  key  as  described  later  in this chapter).  The range of
permissible values is 0 to 65535.

CH:   The MIDI channel or the event.  The CH field is not used for non-MIDI
events,  or for MIDI events which don't carry channel information.  Channel
numbers must be between 1 and 16.

TYP:   The  event  type.   The  KCS uses over twenty different event types,
which  are  explained  later in this chapter.  The most commonly used event
type is the note on event, which has a TYP value of ON.  The meaning of the
data  in the next three fields is dependent on the data in the TYP field so
the  names  of  these  fields are only meaningful for a note on or note off
event.

NOTE:   The  note  value and octave, where the lowest note on a five octave
keyboard is C2.  Since computer keyboards don't contain flat symbols, flats
are  spectGed  as  the  coresponding  sharps  (B  flat  3  becomes A#3, for
instance.)  The  range  of valid MIDI notes in the KCS is C-1 to G9, though
some  other  companies,  most notably Yamaha, number MIDI notes from C-2 to
G8.

VEL: Key velocity The permissible range is 0 - 127. 

DUR:  The duration of the note, or how long the key was actually held down.
The  range  for  duration  is 1 is 999.  A duration of 0 produces a note on
with  no  corresponding  note  off, which is useful for creating notes with
durations greater than 999 clock steps.

Scrolling  through  the event list is done by clicking the mouse pointer on
one  of  the diamonds or arrows to the left of the event list.  Clicking on
the  top  diamond  moves  the  cursor to the first event in the event list,
clicking  on the bottom, diamond moves to the end of the list, and clicking
on  the  middle  diamond causes continuous scrolling from the edit cursor's
current  position.   When  the middle diamond is used, pressing the CONTROL
key  will  cause scrolling to pause until the CONTROL key is pressed again,
while pressing the ESC causes scrollmg to terminate.

The  scroll  arrows  provide another method for scrolling through the event
list.  Clicking on one of the triple arrows moves the event list forward or
backward  by  eighteen  events,  the  double  arrows  move the list by nine
events, and the single arrows move the list down by one event.  Holding the
left  mnouse  button  down  while  the mnouse pointer is positioned over an
arrow causes continuous scrolling.

The  edit  cursor  may  be  moved  to any point in the event list using the
cursor  keys or by clicking the mouse on the appropriate point in the list.
Note  that  the edit cursor can not be moved into either of the noneditable
fields  (MSR-ST  and  EVNT),  so  clicking the mouse on these fields has no
effect.

Select Boxes and Edit Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  select  boxes which are the small numbered boxes stacked at the bottom
of  the right half of the screen are used to select a new sequence or track
for editing.  In track mode, each of the 48 tracks has its own box.  Tracks
which  contain  data  are  shown as boxes with a number in them while empty
tracks are represented by an empty box.  Clicking on a box will select that
track  for  editing  or  clicking  on  **  will allow you to type the track
number.

Two  sequences  or  tracks  can  also  be  swapped  using the select boxes.
Holding the left or right SHIFT key down when clicking on a select box will
exchange  that  track  or  sequence  with  the  currently selected track or
sequence.   

In  Open mode, only the first 33 primary sequences (A - X) and the first 26
of the secondary sequences (00 - 25) can be acccssed with the select boxes.
Sequences  Y  and  X  are  represented  for use by the program and can't be
dirctly edited.  Seconddary sequences above 25 must be selected by clicking
on ** and typing the sequence numbber.

The  edit options are displayed on the right half of the screen.  An option
is  selected  by  cllicking on its name.  Depending on the option chosen, a
message,  edit  window,  or dialog box may appear.  The specific details on
each option are explained later in this chapter.

While most of the edit options are identified in both Track and Open modes,
there are slight differences in some cases, and some options appear only in
one  mode  or  the  other.   If  this  is the case, it will be noted in the
section on that option.

Selecting a Range for Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Most  of  the  edit  options  will  work on a range of events, as well as a
single  event.   The  range can be entered in the dialog box or edit window
for  that  option,  or a range may be selected with the mouse.  To select a
range of events for editing.  Place the edit cursor at the top or bottom of
the  range,  and  while  holding  the left mouse button down, move the edit
cursor  to the other end of the range.  (This is called "dragging" the edit
cursor.) The selected range will be highlighted, as shown below.

You  can  drag  the  cursor beyond the bottom, of the screen, and the event
list will automatically scroll to the new position.  The selected range can
be played by clicking the right mouse button.

After a range is selected, a new range may be selected in the same way, and
the  active  select  range  can  be toggled between the two by pressing the
ALTERNATE  key.   If a range extends over more than a single screen you can
move from one end of the range to the other by pressing the CONTROL key.

When  a  range  is selected, the first and last event numbers of that range
will be diplayed on the message line.

Playing the Sequence or Track from the Edit Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
In additaon to the PLAY edit option found on all three edit screens the KCS
allows  you to play part or all of the sequence or track being edited using
the  mouse  buttons.   On  both the Track mode and Open mode edit screens a
single  right  click on the mouse will play the selected sequence or track,
starting  at  the  location  of  the  edit  cursor.   If  a  range has been
highlighted  a  single  right  click will play only the highlighted events.
Note  that  this occurs even if the selected range has been scrolled on the
screen.   If  a  single  right  click does not produce the expected results
check the message line to confirm that the proper range is selected.

A  double right mouse click will transfer you directly to the Track or Open
play  screen.  If the program seems to have a problem distinguishing single
and  double clicks you can also move to the play screen by holding down the
SHIFT button while right clicking.  The Amiga may have problems with double
clicks if you click too fast; try clicking a little slower in this case.

In Open mode, pressing the left and right mouse buttons simultaneously will
play the currently selected cue.  In Track mode, all limited tracks will be
played  starting  at  the  cue point, or if a range is selected, that range
will be played for the selected track, as well as all other umnuted tracks.

To  stop  the  sequencer  when playing from the edit screen, click the left
mouse  button.   Holding  the SHIFT key when doing this will place the last
event  played  about 2/3 of the way down the edit list, which is handy when
you need to locate a specific event by ear.

When  piaing  from the edit screen, the internal clock is always used, even
if  MIDI  or MIDI W SONG POINTER is selecled as the clock source on the SET
OPTIONS screen.

Editing or Entering a Single Event
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
To  change  a value in the event list, move the edit cursor to the location
of  the  value, and type in the new value.  When you start to type, a white
box  called the edit box will outline the fields you may edit.  You can use
the  cursor control and BACKSPACE keys to move over characters in the field
and  the  SPACE bar to clear them out.  The TAB key will move the cursor to
the  next  field,  and  SHIFT-TAB will move the cursor back one field.  The
cursor  can  also be moved to any point within the edit box by clicking the
mouse  on that point.  When you're done entering data press RETURN to enter
the data or UNDO to cancel the change.  Clicking the mouse outsfde the edit
box has the same effct as pressing RETURN.

Since  the program expects to see only certain types of data in each field,
(numbers from, 1 to 16 in the CH field, for example), entering invalid data
in a field will cause your entry to be misinterpreted or ignored.  You must
enter data that is appropriate for the type of event that you are editing.

To  add  notes  to the end of a sequence or track, place the edit cursor in
the  TIME  field  on the first line after the end of the sequence or track,
and enter the data as described above.

In  most  cases, the RETURN and ENTER keys perform the same function in the
KCS,  but  there  is  one  important difference between these two keys when
editing  events.   If  the TIME value for an event has been changed and the
ENTER  key is pressed instead of RETURN, the time of the next event will be
adusted  so  that  the measure and step of that event will remain the same.
See the sect@on on INSERT and ADJUST for more details.

Defaults and Shortcuts for Event Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  a  field  is  left  empty when entering a note or other event, then the
value  in  that field will default to some value which depends on the event
type and other factors.  If all fields are left blank and the previous line
in the event list is an ON event, then each field will default to the value
in the previous line, except the TIME field, which always defaults to zero.
If  the  previous  event  is  not  an ON event, the defaults are not always
predictable.   Usually, the TYP field defaults to the value in the previous
line,  and all other empty fields default to zero.  If the octave number in
the previous line; the same holds for octave values entered without notes.

There is also a group of single letter abbreviations for commonly used TIME
values.   Typing any of these abbreviations while the cursor is in the TIME
column  will  cause the program to immediately display the selected time in
the  TIME  column .  The TIME abbreviations and the corresponding number of
steps  using  the  system default of 24 steps/quarter note are given in the
following table:

Key	Value			Steps	Dotted	Triplet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A	Last used			
C	Last calculated
Z	Zero				0		0		0
W	Whole note		96		144		64
H	Half note			48		72		32
Q	Quarter note		24		36		16
E	Eighth note		12		18		8
S	16th note			6		9		4
T	32nd note			3		5		2

The  "last  calculated" value assooated with the abbreviation "C" refers to
the  value  returned  by  the  most  recent  use  of  the CALC edit option,
described later in this chapter.

A dotted note of any of the types listed can be entered by pressing
CONTROL and the letter at the same time.  A triplet is entered by
pressing SHIFT and the letter.  Changing the STEPS/BEAT setting, on the
SET OPTIONS screen, will change the number of steps for each letter in the
table correspondingly.

Event Types
~~~~~~~~~~~
The KCS recognizes 22 different types of events. Seven of these are MIDI
events and the rest are non-MIDI. A sequence or track may contain different
types of events. The seven MIDI events that the Keyboard Controlled
Sequencer recognizes are:

ON - Note on
OF - Note off (also entered as OFF)
PG - Program change
CC - Control change
AT - Aftertouch, or channel pressure
PB - Pitch bend
* - Single byte event

The non-MIDI events are:

PRIMARY sequence start (1 - 9, A - Z)
ST - Secondary sequence start
XX - Sequenct stop
XL - Loop stop
MS - Mute sequence
US - Unmute sequence
PT - Transpose sequence pitch
VT - Transpose sequence velocity
TM - Tempo value
AC - Accelerando (increase tempo)
DC - Decelerando (decrease tempo)
SM - Steps/measure
RA - Random event
CU - Wait and see
DE - Deleted event (rest)

PRIMARY, ST, XX, XL, MS, US, PT, and VT events are ignored when the program
is not in Open mode. ST events can also be used to start PRIMARY sequences
by entering a single digit or letter. Each event type is described in
detail below.

Note On and Off
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ON  events  are the most common events used in the KCS.  The meaning of the
date  in  ecah  field  is  exastly  as  described in the explanation of the
fields.

When recording note on and note off messages, if any note has a duration of
more  than  999 clock steps, the DUR value for that ON event becomes 0, and
the  program records a separate The program maintains 64 duration counters,
Whch  are used to keep track of the durations for up to 64 ON events.  When
this limit is exceeded during playback, the program will cut short the note
that  would  normaly end next, and play the new note.  This should not be a
problem  in  most  applications.   One other important point to be aware of
when  programming  durations is that when note on and note off messages are
programmed  to  occur on the same time step, the note off messages are sent
after the note on messages.  (This is done to keep the note on timing which
is  more critical than note off timing, nice and crisp.) This means that if
you  want  to  create  legato parts without overlapping (slurred) notes the
durations used should be one less than the corresponding TIME values.

Program Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
PG  events  will  make  the instrument on the specified MIDI channel change
programs.   For  most  synthesizers, you should make sure the instrument is
not  currenly playing a note when it is to change sounds.  Some instruments
may  quietly  shut on the note and make the change, while other instruments
will  make a very undesirable popping sound when changing.  When entering a
program  change,  the  value under NOTE represents the program number.  Not
all  instruments  begin  program  numbering  with 0.  See the synthesizer's
owner's manual, for specifics on your instruments.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME		CH TYP	NOTE	VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	0		1	PG	0
1-	1	2	0		16	PG	5


Control Change 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CC  cvents  are  control change events.  They are generated by a mod wheel,
pedal,  joystick,  sustain pedal, etc.  The value undcr NOTE will represent
the   controller  being  changed.   The  numbers  used  to  represent  each
controller  have  been  pretty  much standardizd by the MIDI manufacturer's
Association,  and are listed in the MIDI chapter.  The value under VEL will
be  the  new value for a control paramater.  The range is 0 - 127, but only
certain  values  may  be  valid  for a particular instrument and type of CC
event.   CC  events  do  not use the DUR column.  The following table shown
part  of  a  sequence  in  which the mod wheel was moved slowly seven steps
after a note was played.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME		CH TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	0		1	ON	  C 	4	64	12
1-	8	2	7		1	CC	    0	 2	
1-	8	3	0		1	CC	    1	 4	
1-	9	4	1		1	CC	    1	 6	
1-	10	5	1		1	CC	    1	 8	
1-	10	6	0		1	CC	    1	 10  

CC  events  can be recorded in real time, or entered one at a time from the
edit screen.  You will probably find it too time consuming to enter or edit
from  the  edit  control  changes from, a continuous controller (mod wheel,
pedal,  breath  controller,  etc.)  one  event  at a time.  You may find it
useful to enter sudden changes from the edit screen or to create a sequence
of  controller  events and call it up at diffrent points in the piece using
sequence start events in Open mode.

Aftertouch
~~~~~~~~~~ 
AT  events  have values From 0 - 127 in the NOTE feld, 1 and do not use the
VEL  or DUR fields.  Since AT events use up lots of memory when recorded in
real  time, you should set the sequencer to not record aftertouch unless it
is specifically required.

Pitch Bend
~~~~~~~~~~
The  value entered under NOTE for PB events can be in the range of -8192 to
8191.  The MIDI spec allows 14 bits for pitch bend, hence the huge numbers.
Not  all  synths  interpret  these values similarly so experiment and check
your manual.  PB events do not use the VEL or DUR columns.

Single Byte Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A  single  byte event may be sent over MIDI by entering a * under event TYP
and  the  byte  value to - 255) under NOTE.  This allows sending any system
common or system exclusive information from your sequences.  When sending a
single  byte  command  from  the KCS, specify the command in decimal.  Some
instrument  manuals  may show commands in hex In the following example, the
single byte events would send a MIDI song select command for song 11.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME		CH TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	0			*	  243 			
1-	1	2	0			*	   11	 	

System  exclusive  messages can be sent by entering a single byte event for
each  byte  in  the  message.  This is obviously impractical for long sysex
messages such as program dumps, but works well for shorter messages.  NOTE:
IT  IS  THE USER'S RESPONSIBILlTY TO UNDERSTAND HOW A PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT
WILL  RESPOND.   PLEASE  DO  NOT  CALL DR.T'S MUSIC SOFTWARE WITH QUESTIONS
REGARDING THE RESPONSE OF YOUR INSTRUMENTS TO SYSTEM EXCLUSIVE DATA.

Version 1.6 of the KCS has the ability to record short system exclusive
messages as single byte events. See the SET OPTIONS and TIPS AND TROUBLE
SHOOTING chapters for details.

Sequence Control Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There  are  eight  types  of  sequence  control events that can control the
playing  of other sequences.  These are PRIMARY events (which start primary
sequences),  ST  events  (which  start  secondary or primary sequences), XX
events  (which  stop  a  sequence),  XL  events (which stop a sequence from
looping),  MS  events  (which  mute  a sequence), US events (which unmute a
previously   muted  sequence),  PT  events  (pitch  transposition)  and  VT
(velosity  transposition).   These event types can be created only from the
edit screen and are ignored if the program is in Track mode or Song mode.

The  next  few  sections  of  the chapter describe how each of the sequence
control  events  work.  For more information on control sequence techniques
see Chapter 13.

Primary Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
PRIMARY  events are used to start any primary sequence (1 - 9, A - Z), When
a  PRIMARY event is encountered the sequence whose key is specified will be
started  automatically.  The value under NOTE will be a pitch transposition
in   half   steps   while  the  number  under  VEL  represents  a  velocity
transposition.   The permissible range for each is -64 to 63.  If a note is
transposed out of the MIDI keyboard range, it will be transposed to the end
of  its  range.   If  a  channel has been designated as a drum channel (see
Chapter 11), the channel will not be affected by any pitch transpositions.

The  following  sequence  will start sequences A, 2, and F as soon as it is
started.   A will be transposed up two half steps, and 2 will be transposed
down four half steps.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME		CH TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	0			A	    2	 0	 1
1-	1	2	0			2	   -4	 0	 1	
1-	1	3	0			F	    0	 0	 1

The  value  under  DUR is the number of times the sequence will repeat.  It
overrides  the  originally programed repeat value for the sequeocc.  If the
value  under  DUR is 99, the sequence will repeat until stopped by the user
or by an XX or XL evnt.  A W in the DUR column repeesens a WAIT flag.  This
causes  the  control  sequence  to  wait  until the scquence started by the
sequence  start  event has finished before any new evens can begin.  In the
next  example the program will start sequence A and play it four times.  No
other  event  in the sequence will be played until sequence A completes its
four  repetitions.   When  sequence B is started, the control sequence will
wait again.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		   A	   	 0		 0	4W
2-	1	2	 96		   E	     -2	      8	1
5-	1	3	288		   A	      7	     12	2
5-   1    4      0          B       0         0   2W

ST Events 
~~~~~~~~~
ST  events  are  another form of sequence start event.  Secondary sequences
can  only  be started using ST events, or from the numeric keypad.  To type
in  an  ST  event  put the desired event time under the TIME column, put ST
under  TYPE and put the desired sequence (primary or secondary) under NOTE.
If  you  would  like  to specify a piteh transposition, enter it in the VEL
field.   Specify  the  number  of  repeats under DUR.  You cannot specify a
velocity transpisition with an ST event.

Note  that secondary sequences can start other sequences <including primary
sequences)  with  sequence  start event.  In this example, sequences 01, 23
and A are started a measure apart.  Sequence 23 will play twice, transposed
up  eight  half  steps.   Sequence  01 will play four times and the control
sequence will wait for sequence A to finish before proceeding.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		  ST	   	 01		 0	1
2-	1	2	 96		  ST	      23	      0	2
3-	1	3	 96		  ST	       A	      0	4W

XX and XL Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
XX events are sequence stop events.  They allow you to
automatically stop one or more sequences, even in the
middle of playing. To stop a single sequence with an XX event, enter
XX under TYPE, and the desired sequence, left justified under NOTE as
shown below. 

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3-	1	1	192		   XX	  23		 	
7-	1	2	384		   XX	   A
9-	1	3	192		   XX	  01

More  than one sequence may be stopped with a single XX event by placing an
asterisk  (*)  under  NOTE.   An asterisk by itself will stop all sequences
that  are  currently playing (active), or an asterisk followed by a channel
number  will  stop  all  active  sequences that start with an event on that
channel.   The  following  example  would immediately stop all sequences on
channel 1, then stop the remaining sequences one measure later:

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		   XX	  *1
2-	1	2	 96		   XX	  *

Note  that  sequence  control  events  that use the * option take longer to
execute  than similar events affecting only one sequence, and may result in
audible delays if overused.

XL  events  are  much like XX events except that the sequences specified in
the NOTE field will continue to play to their ends before stopping.

MS and US Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
MS  and US events are much like XX and XL events, except that the specified
sequences  will  be  muted rather than dopped.  The main difference is that
when  a  sequence is muted, it will continue to play, but the events in the
muted  sequence will not be executed.  This is useful if, for instance, you
are  creating  a  piece by stringing together complex control sequences and
would  like  to  remove  a  portion of a sequence from, one occurrence of a
particular  section,  without  actually  editing  the  affected  sequences.
Inserting  an  MS  event  in  the master control sequence, followed by a US
event  at  the  appropriate time, will blank out the designated sequence in
that portion of the composition.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		   ST	  01		 0	 1
2-	1	2	 96		   MS	  01	      
3-	1	3	 96		   MS	  01

As with the XX and XL events, multiple sequences may be specified in MS and
US events usng a * in the NOTE column.

PT and VT Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PT  ana  VT  events cause a pitch or velocity transposition to oocur in the
specified  sequences.   The  sequence number, or an asterisk and an optionl
channel  number,  are  entered  in  the  NOTE column, and the transposition
amount from -64 to + 63, is entered under VEL.  If the DUR column is blank,
the  value  under  VEL is added to the current transposition value for that
sequence,  or if an S is placed in the DUR column, the program will set the
transposition  to  that  value.   Notes  played on the drum channel are not
affected  by  PT  events.   The  pitch and velocity transpositions for each
sequence  are  set  to  0 when the sequencer is started, and transpositions
will be "chased" when starting from a cue point.

In  the following example, secondary sequence 01 is transposed up an octave
from  it's  current  transposition  and  four  measures  later,  all active
sequences  that  start  with  events on channel 3 will be set to a velocity
transposition of 0.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		   PT	   01	 12
5-	1	2	384		   VT	   *3	  0    S

When  a  PT or VT event is encountered in a sequence while playing from the
Open  mode  play screen, the first four letters of the sequence's name will
be  replaced  on  the screen by the sequence's pitch transposition, and the
last four letters by the sequence's velocity transposition.

TM Events
~~~~~~~~~ 
TM  events  in  a  sequence  will  imnmediately force the internal clock to
change  the tempo to the specified value.  Sequences may have more than one
TM  event.   In  fact,  several sequences may contain TM events.  When a TM
event  as  encountered the tempo will change to that value until another TM
event is encountered.

TM  events have no effct on the tempo if the program is using MIDI clock as
its  clock source, though they are used for calculations when synchronizing
to  an  external clock.  See the section on timing resolution in Chapter 13
for details.

Enter TM under TYP, the desired tempo (in beats per
minute) in the NOTE field, and the tenths portion or the tempo under VEL. 

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		   A	   	 0		 0	4
2-	1	2	 96		   E	      0	      0	1
5-	1	3	288		  TM	    140	      2	
5-   1    4      0          B       0         0   2W

In this example sequence A is played four times, one measure later sequence
E plays one time, and three measures later the tempo is set to 140.2 BPM as
sequence B starts playing.  You should put a TM event as fhc first event in
your control sequence to assure that it always plays at the correct tempo.

To   maintain   optimum   accuracy  when  using  the  real  time  clock  or
synchronizing to an external MIDI clock, you should place all The events on
multiples  of  six clock steps.  This is because MIDI song pointer messages
(which  are  used  in  conjunction  with  tempo  settings  and  a  SMPTE or
equivalent  synchronizer to communicate the time of day between the KCS and
external devices) are quantized in units of six MIDI clocks.

AC and DC Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
AC  and  DC  events  are  used  to create proportional changes in tempo, as
opposed  to  the  absolute changes created by TM events.  Entering a number
between 1 and 3000 under NOTE will cause the tempo to change by that number
of  parts  in  1024.   For example, if an AC event has a value of 1024, the
tempo  will  double,  or if the number under NOTE were 512, the tempo would
increase  by  50%.   AC  events cause an increase in tempo, while DC events
cause  a  decrease in tempo.  AC and DC events can only be entered from the
edit screen.

Gradual  tempo changes can be made by creating a string of evenly spaced AC
or  DC  cvents,  and  playing them along with a sequence or track either by
merging  them into the sequence or track, or by playing them simultaneously
from  a  separate sequence or track.  This example would cause the tempo to
increase ty 1O% over the space of one measure.

MSR	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		   AC	  13
1-  13	2	 12		   AC	  13
1-  25	3	 12		   AC	  13
1-  37    4     12          AC       13
1-  49	5	 12		   AC	  13
1-  61	6	 12		   AC	  13
1-  73	7	 12		   AC	  13

2-   1    9     12          DE

Generally  speaking the best way to add AC or DC events to a sequence is to
first add one or two by hand to determine the corrcct values and spacing to
use,  then  using  the  PASTE edit option to merge multiple copies of these
events  with  the  sequence  or  track.  As with TM events AC and DC events
should  be  placed  on  multiples  of six clock steps for best results when
using  the  real  time clock.  You should also remember to start any pieces
that  contain AC or DC events with a TM event.  Otherwise, you will need to
reset the tempo each time you play the piece.

DE Events
~~~~~~~~~ 
DE events are most often used at the end of a sequence to instruct
the computer to wait a specified number of steps before looping or going on
to play the next sequence.  In the following example sequence A starts (and
repeats four times), and four measures later (384 clock counts) the sequence
shown ends.  If another control sequence is waiting for this one, that
sequence will now continue playing.  

MSR	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		   A	   	 0		 0	4
2-	1	2	384		  DE	     

DE  events  may  also  be  used  to  erase  or silence a wrong note without
affecting  the  numbering of subsequent events, by typing DE over the event
type  of  the  undesired  note.   Clicking  anywhere  on the event line and
pressing the DELETE key followed by RETURN will have the same effect.

SM Events
~~~~~~~~~ 
SM events are used to change the sequencer's
steps/measure setting during playback.  This will have no effect at all on
the music being played but it will change the operation of the
measure/step counter. 
Use SM events anywhere that the music changes time signatures, and the new
time signature will be used by the
measure/step counter during playback.  The number of steps/measure is
entered under NOTE, and the remaining fields are unused.

If you use a lot of SM events in a portion of a piece to represent a varing
time signature, it may prove less confusing to use a single SM setting that
is  one  beat  long,  and  then  treat  the  measure/step display as a beat
counter.   See  the  SET  OPTIONS  chapter  for  more  information  on  the
steps/measure  setting,  as  well  as a table of common time signatures and
their corresponding steps/measure values.

RA Events
~~~~~~~~~
RA events are used to select one of a number of events at random. The "hat"
out of which an event is drawn is a list of events immediately following
the RA event, and the length of this list is set by the numbmr in the NOTE colunn.  The
limits for the length of the list are 2 - 255.  After the selected event is
executed, the sequence or track will continue from the next event
after the end of the list. 

Here are two examples that illustrate the use of the RA event. The first
will play one of the five notes in the list, then continue from the G4.
Note that since the D4 occurs twice in the list, it is twice as likely to
be selected as any of the others.

The next example shows how an RA event is used to change the structure of a
piece of music by selecting from, a list of sequence control events.  The
sequences in the list could each be a set of tom rolls; for instance, which
would inject an illusion of spontaneity into a drum part. 

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0		  RA	   	 4		 
1-	1	2	  0		  ST	     01	      0   1
1-	1	3	  0		  ST	     11	      0   1
1-   1    4      0         ST      03         0   1
1-	1	5	  0		  ST	   	05		 0   1
2-	1	6	 96		  ST	     23	      0   1
3-	1	7	 96		  ST	      A	      0   4W


The  TIME  values  for the list of possible events are ignored when playing
though  they  should all be set to 0 to avoid confusion when editing tracks
or  sequences  and  especially  to  avoid  conflicts when merging tracks or
sequences.   Also  note  that while the RA event is recognized in all three
modes,  the  list  of  candidate events should only contain events that are
appropriate for that mode.

CU Events
~~~~~~~~~ 
CU  events  cause  the  sequence, track, or song that contains them to wait
until  a  specified  time  on  the real time clock.  The NOTE, DUR, and VEL
columns  hold the minutes, seconds and tenths of seconds values for the cue
point.  Minutes can be any value from 0 - 255, and seconds, of course, must
be  less  than 60.  CU events are ignored if the MIN:SEC switch, on the SET
OPTIONS screen, is turned off.

Care  should  be exercised when using CU events.  If the time specified has
already  passed  when  the event occurs, the program will think it is late,
and  will spew out notes and MIDI clocks at maximum speed, in an attempt to
catch  up with itself.  This can happen if a sequence containing a CU event
is looped, or if tracks containing CU events are appended or doubled.

See  the  section on TIMING RESOLUTION, in Chapter 13, for more information
on the real time clock.

Edit Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  right half of the screen displays the available edit options.  When an
edit  option  is selected, a message will appear on the message line, and a
dialog box or an edit window may appear.  Dialog boxes and edit windows are
described  in  Chapter 1 of this manual, and details on the individual edit
options appear below.

Name and Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The name of a track or sequence consists of eight characters. When you
start to record on an unnamed track or sequence, the program will name the
track or sequence with the MIDI channel number. The event type will be part
of the name if the first event is not a note. If you click on NAME, the
edit cursor will move to the top of the screen where the name is displayed.
Type in the new name, and press RETURN.

In  Open  mode, a thirty character comment field, directly below the EVENTS
LEFT  line,  can  also  be  accessed by clicking on NAME.  Typing more than
eight  characters  in  the  name,  or  using  the cursor control keys after
Clicking on NAME, will move the edit cursor to the comment field.

Transpose/Auto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  TRANSPOSE/AUTO  option manipulates data in a variety of ways.  An edit
window  appears  in  which  you  can  specify  the  range  of  events to be
processed,  the  operation  to  perform,  and  the  parameters  used by the
available  options.   Only one of the available options can be chosen for a
single edit operation.

The  range  of  events  to  be edited is selected by clicking on ALL, EVENT
RANGE,  or MEASURE RANGE.  If either of the last two options is chosen, the
numbers to the right of these buttons set the upper and lower limits of the
range.

Clicking  on UNDO or pressing the UNDO key after a TRANSPOSE/AUTO operation
will return the track or sequence to its previous state.

Pitch, Velocity, and Duration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  PITCH, VELOCITY, and DURATION and Duration transpose options allow you
to transpose (change by a constant amount) or invert the pitch, velocity or
duration  of  all  ON  and  OFF  events  in  the  range  processed.   Pitch
transposition  has  many obvious uses and is found in all serious sequencer
programs.   Inversion  and velocity and duration transpositions are logical
extensions  of  this  concept.  You will probably transpose pitch much more
often  than any of the others, but they are there any time you have use for
them.

After selecting PITCH, VELOCITY, or DURATION, click on TRANSPOSE or INVERT.
The  number next to TRANSPOSE is the transposition amount (-63 to +63), and
the   value  beside  INVERT  sets  the  center  point  for  the  inversion.
Transposing  pitch  by  -12  drops  all  notes down one octave, and a pitch
transposition  of 7 would raise the pitch up seven half steps (a fifth).  A
velocity  transposition  of 24 increases all MIIDI velocities by 24 (making
the  notes  louder  or brighter, depending on your synth's response to MIDI
velocity),  and transposing duration by -3 shortens all notes by three time
steps (making notes more staccato).  The program will assign the largest or
smallest allowable value to a pitch, velocity or duration if you attempt to
transpose  out  of  range.  It is possible to transpose pitch, velocity and
duration to values that are not useful for your instrument and patch.

Selecting  INVERT causes high values to become low and low values to become
high.   The  acceptable  range  for  the  inversion  point is 1 - 127.  The
program  will  perform  the  inversion  around  the  value  you enter.  For
example, if you invert velocity around 50, a velocity of 70 will become 30,
while a velocity of 20 will become 80.

If  you are inverting pitch, the number that you enter must be the MIDI key
number of the pitch that you wish to invert around.  MIDI key numbers range
from  0  for  the  lowest  MIDI key (C - 1 in our notation), to 127 for the
highest,  G9.   The  MIDI  chapter has a table of note values and MIDI note
numbers.   To invert pitch around middle C, enter a value of 60.  Inverting
the  C  scale  from,  sequence  1 around middle C will produce a descending
scale  that  goes from C4 down to C3.  Be careful, though, since inversions
will  usually  cause  the part to change keys, except for certain inversion
points.   In  the example of the C minor scale, inverting around 60 changes
the scale to a G Phrygian scale, while inverting around 62 gives an E minor
scale, etc.

Auto-Correct
~~~~~~~~~~~~
AUTO-CORRECT is used to round all of the TIME and/or DUR
values in a track or sequence to multiples of some number.  This is usually
done to smooth out the timing of a less than perfect recording but can also
be used for special effects.  The number next to AUTO-CORRECT sets the
step count for
auto-correction.  After auto-correction all times in the selected range
will be a whole number multiple of the step count.
The following table shows the step counts corresponding to several
common note values at the
stdandard 24 steps/beat: 

3 for 32nd notes 		4 for l6th note triplets
6 for l6th notes 		8 for 8th note triplets
12 for 8th notes 		16 for quarter note triplets 
24 for quarter notes 	48 for half notes 
96 for whole notes

The  number  next  to  DUR  on  the  same  line has a similar effect on the
durations  in  the  selected  range:   The entry is optional.  You can also
quantrize  only  the duration by leawng out the value for step count.  When
duration  is auto-corrected, the resulting duration values are actually one
less  than  the  nearest  multiple of the duration auto-correct value.  For
instance,  entering  a  value  of  6 for duration auto-corretion results in
duration  values  of 5, 11, 17, etc.  instead of 6, l2 and 18.  This allows
notes  played  on  monophonic instruents to retrigger when legato parts are
played,  by  ensuring  that  a  note off message is sent before the next ON
event in the sequence or track.

When  a  portion of a track or sequence containing events other than ON and
OFF  events  is  auto-correted,  the program treats all the non-note events
between  each  pair  of On events as part of the first note, and moves them
along  with  that note.  This is handy when a sequence contains pitch bends
or  other controller messages that you want to time to particular notes.  If
you want to auto-correct a part without affecting the non-note data use the
SPLIT  edit  option to separate the note data to another track or sequence,
as described later in this chapter.

Compress/Expand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  COMPRESS/EXPAND  option  changes the timing of the overall sequence or
track.   This  option  can  also  be  used to speed up or slow down a part,
relative   to   the   other   part  of  your  song.   The  number  next  to
COMPRESS/EXPAND  sets  the amount of compression or expansion (in percent),
and the DUR button on the same line causes durations to be affected as well
as  time.   Each  note's  TIME  and/or  DUR value will be multiplied by the
amount  you  enter, divided by 100.  Entering an amount of 200 results in a
sequence or track which is twice as long as the original, 50 makes the part
half as long, etc.

Time Reverse
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The TIME REVERSE option will re-arrange events
so that they play in reverse order.  The TIME values of
the first and last notes are not changed and if the last event in the range
selected is a DE event it won't be
affected either.  Note that since the value in the TIME
field represents the amount of time that elapses before
an event occurs time reversal will not preserve the relationship between an
event's TIME and DUR values.  For example, consider the following sequence:


MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0	   1   ON 	C 3	      50  10
1-  13	2	 12	   1   ON	     D 3	      50  10
1-  25	3	 12	   1   ON	     E 3	      50  10
1-  37    4     12     1   ON      F 4        50  10
1-  49	5	 12	   1   ON	   	G 3		 50  10
1-  61	6	 12	   1   ON	     A 3	      50  10
1-  73	7	 12	   1   ON	     B 3	      50  10
2-   1    8     24     1   ON      C 4        50  94
3-   1    9     96         DE      

Reversing the order of tbe sequence yields:

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0	    1  ON	   	C 4	      50  94
1-  25    2	 24	    1  ON	     B 3	      50  10
1-  37	3	 12	    1  ON	     A 3	      50  10
1-  49   	4     12      1  ON      G 3        50  10
1-  61	5	 12	    1  ON	   	F 3		 50  10
1-  73	6	 12	    1  ON	     E 3	      50  10
1-  85	7	 12	    1  ON	     D 3	      50  10
2-   1    8     12      1  ON      C 3        50  10
3-   1    9     96         DE

Now  the  C4  with  the  duration  of 94 sustains while the other notes are
playing.   In  a  case such as this you might want to swap the durations of
events 2 and 9, to preserve the original timing relationships.

Channel Assign
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
CHANNEL  ASSIGN  changes the MIDI channel numbers of events in the selected
range.   If  only  the  first  of  the two data fields to the right of this
switch  contains  a  value,  all events will be assigned to this channel if
these  values  are present, then consccutive events will be assigned to the
next  higher  MIDI  channel within the specified range.  This is useful for
playing polyphonic parts on a synth in mono mode, or for adding space to an
arrangement.

Velocity Scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Selecting  VELOCITY  SCALE  will  create  a "velocity fade-in" or "velocity
fade-out",  depending  on  the  values you gve it.  The values next to this
button  represent  the  beginning and ending velocities; leaving the second
field empty will set all velocities to the first value.

The range for velocily is 0 - 127, with 127 being the loudest or brightest.
Synths  that  respond  to  velocity  can  then  be programmed to respond in
sevcral different ways, so the result of your velocity scale will depend on
the  particular  patch  you  are  using  on  your  instrument.   Here  is a
monophonic  sequence  consisting  of  sixteenth aod eighth notes all at the
same velocity.

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0	   1   ON	   	C 3        50  10
1-	7	2	  6	   1   ON	     C 3	      50  10
1-  13	3	  6	   1   ON	     C 3	      50  10
1-  19    4      6     1   ON      C 3        50  10
1-  25	5	  6	   1   ON	   	C 3		 50  10
1-  31	6	  6	   1   ON	     C 3	      50  10
1-  37	7	  6	   1   ON	     C 3	      50  10
1-  43    8      6     1   ON      C 3        50  10
1-  55    9     12     1   ON      C 3        50  10

If  we  apply  velocity scaling and enter a starting velocity of 100 and an
ending velocity of 1, the sequence will now look like this:

MSR-	ST	EVNT	TIME	   CH  TYP	NOTE		VOL	DUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1-	1	1	  0	   1   ON	   	C 3       100  10
1-	7	2	  6	   1   ON	     C 3	      89  10
1-  13	3	  6	   1   ON	     C 3	      80  10
1-  19    4      6     1   ON      C 3        66  10
1-  25	5	  6	   1   ON	   	C 3		 58  10
1-  31	6	  6	   1   ON	     C 3	      45  10
1-  37	7	  6	   1   ON	     C 3	      34  10
1-  43    8      6     1   ON      C 3        23  10
1-  55   10     12     1   ON      C 3         1  10

Note  that  the difference in velocity between the last two events is twice
that between any other two events.  This is because the KCH scales velocity
linearly  over  time, NOT the number of events.  Since the time of the last
note  is twice that of the others, the velocity drops twice as much in that
time period as in the others.

Erase Controllers and Clear Deletes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  ERASE CONTROLLERS option is used to strip all MIDI data except note on
and  off  events  from  the selected range.  CLEAR DELETES is a convenience
feature which erases all DE events from a sequence or track, except for the
final  "trailing  DE,  if  any.  This option affects the entire sequence or
track.

Insert and Adjust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  options  are  used  to insert new data in a sequence or track at the
current  position of the edit cursor.  Clicking on either will create a new
blank  line  ahead  of  the current event, at which point new events can be
typed in as describwd earlier in this chapter.

When  INSERT  is  selected,  events  are simply inserted in the sequence or
track,  with  no  adustments to timing.  When ADJUST is chosen, the program
will  attempt  to  keep the length of the sequence constant, by subtracting
from the TIME value of the first event after the insert point.  If the TIME
value  for  this  event  becomes  0,  the program will no longer be able to
adjust,  and  the  length  of  the  sequence or track will increase as more
events are entered.

You can also insert nrw material by pressing the INSERT key.  In this case,
the  program,  will  use  the  most recently chosen of the INSERT or ADJUST
options.

When you have finished inserting use the cursor keys to move to a new event
line or click the left mouse button.

Cut, Copy, and Paste
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  CUT,  COPY,  and PASTE options are among the most powerful in the KCS.
These  commands  utilize  what  we  call the paste buffer.  You can use the
paste buffer to move and copy part or all of a sequence or track to another
sequence or track.  The same paste buffer is used for Open and Track modes,
so  you  can  use this to move information between the two modes.  Any time
you CUT or COPY, the previous contents or the paste buffer are discarded.

Cut
~~~
The  CUT  command  will  delete  or erase the events in a desired range and
place  the events into the paste buffer.  The CUT edit window allows you to
set  a  range by event or by measure.  Cutting all the events in a sequence
or  track is not allowed.  Click on EVENT RANGE or MEASURE RANGE to set the
range;  the values to the right of these buttons contain the start and stop
points for the cut.

DELETE  ORIGINAL  and  ERASE  ORIGINAL  affect the data that is left in the
original  sequence  or  track.   DELETE  ORIGINAL will remove the specified
section  and  shorten  the  sequence  or track.  ERASE ORIGINAL removes the
events  specified  but  adds  their time values to the next event after the
selected range, thus preserwng the original timing.

ZERO FIRST TIME forces the TIME value of the first event to zero: this is
usually the most convenient value when pasting.  Click on OK and the data
will be moved to the paste buffer.  This data will remain in the paste
buffer until you next use the CUT or COPY command. 

Copy
~~~~
The  COPY  command is identical to the CUT command except that the selected
range  is  not  deleted  or  erased from the sequence or track.  It is also
possible to copy all of a sequence or track.

Paste
~~~~~
Once  you  have  moved  data  into  the  paste buffer using the CUT or COPY
command,  you  can  use the PASTE command.  There are a number of different
ways  to  paste  material to a track of sequence, which are outlined below.
Because  the  PASTE edit window has so many options, a HELP button has been
provided, next to the standard edit buttons.

When  you  use PASTE in Track mode, remember that all tracks will loop when
track  1 finishes playing.  Notes that are pasted onto a track at a measure
and step that is past the end of track 1 will not sound when all tracks are
played  at once, and extending track 1 will cause a gap in the other tracks
when the sequencer loops.

PASTE OPTIONS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INSERT  will  placw  the  contents  of  the  paste  buffer at the specified
location, without changing the existing data at the paste location.  INSERT
is  like cutting a piece of tape, and splicing in one or more copies of the
paste  buffer.   The  rest of the sequence will be pushed back in time, and
the sequence will become longer.

REPLACE  will  take  the  contents  of  the  paste buffer and put it at the
specified  location.  The previous contents of the sequence will be written
over  for  the  length of the phrase.  REPLACE is like erasing a section of
tape and replacing it with the contents of the paste buffer.  The timing of
events after the end of the paste will not be altered.

MERGE  will  mix  the contents of the paste buffer with the sequence.  Both
parts will play with their original timing.  The result will be the same as
if both the sequence and paste buffer were played together.

MERGE  TO  END  is similar to MERGE, except that copies of the paste buffer
are  mixed  into  the  sequence,  one after the other, until the end of the
sequence  is  reached.   A  simple  application  would be to have the paste
buffer consist of one note, say a bass drum hit on a drum machine.  Setting
the  phrase  length to 98 steps (one measure) and performing a MERGE TO END
would cause one bass drum hit to be added every measure of the sequence.

FILL  TO  END  is  like  REPLACE,  except  that all data is erased from the
sequence  after  the  paste  location.   This  data is replaced with enough
copies  of  the paste buffer to make the resulting sequence the same length
as the original.

After  an  INSERT  or REPLACE paste operation is executed, the pasted range
will  be  highlighted  in  the event list.  This allows you to see that the
paste was done properly.

PHRASE LENGTH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  length  of  the phrase which is pasted to the new location can also be
changed  by  entering  a phrase length, in measures and steps, under PHRASE
LENGTH.   These  features  can  be  particularly useful when doing multiple
pastes.   Note  that the program will not allow you to increase the time or
decrease  the  phrase  length in a way which affects the relative timing of
the event being pasted.

LOCATION
~~~~~~~~
There  are  two different ways to select a paste location:  either by event
number,  or by specifying a measure and step.  If you specify EVENT NUMBER,
the paste occurs immediately before the event specified to the right of the
button.  If you want to paste at the beginning of the sequence, enter 1.

MEAS/STEP  is  used  primarily  when  you  want  to paste at a point in the
sequence  which is not a location of an event in the sequence.  The program
will  do  the  paste  before  any  event  at the selected measure and step.
Remember,  the  sequence or track begins at measure 1, step 1, and the next
step of any new measure in step 1 of that measure NOT step 0.

The  values  for  EVENT  NUMBER  and  MEAS/STEP will default to the current
location of the edit cursor.

Times to Paste and First Event Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You  can  also  select  the number of times you wish to paste.  The program
will  paste copies of the paste buffer, one after the other, for the number
of  times  selected.   TIMES  TO  PASTE  is  used for the first three paste
options only; it is ignored if you select FILL TO END or MERGE TO END.

FIRST  EVENT TIME sets the time of the first event in the paste, same as in
the CUT and COPY edit windows.

Backup, Get Backup, and Undo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking on BACKUP will make a copy of your current sequence or track.  The
message  "Backup accomplished" will appear on the message line, or an error
message will appear if there is no room for the copy.  It is a good idea to
make a backup before making any change that can not easily be reversed.

The  GET  BACKUP command exchanges your current sequence or track data with
the  most  recently  made  backup.  This allows you to swap and compare the
sequences.

A  separate  backup  sequence  is created whenever a TRANSPOSE, CUT, PASTE,
DELETE, ERASE, or SPLIT operation occurs.  Clicking on UNDO or pressing the
UNDO  key  will  swap  this  sequence  with  the  altered original track or
sequence.

The  manual  and automatic backups are stored by the program in sequences Y
and  Z,  respectively.   You  can thus hear either backup sequence from the
Open  mode play screen by pressing the appropriate key.  If you decide that
you  want to keep both your edited material and the backup, copy the edited
sequence  or  track  to  a  new  location and retrieve the original data by
clicking on GET BACKUP or UNDO.

If  you are planning extensive changes to a sequence or track, you may wish
to  make  a  copy of your original using one of the copy commands described
below before you start editing and then make frequent backups as you edit.

Delete and Erase 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DELETE  and  ERASE  are used to remove a range of events from a sequence or
track.   DELETE  will  shorten  the  length of the sequence or track, while
ERASE  preserves  the length of the sequence or track .  by adding the time
values  of  the events that are erased to the time or the first event after
the selected range.

After  choosing  one of these options, a dialog box will prompt you for the
range  of  events to be removed.  The beginning and end of the range can be
specified  by  typing  in the event numbers for each, or they can be set to
the beginning by clicking on START or END.  It is not possible to delete or
erase an entire sequence or track - at least one event must remain.

Text and Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  on  TEXT  provides  access to a 16 line by 68 character text area
which  can  be used to hold comments about a piece.  The text area is saved
and loaded with .ALL files.

The mouse and the BACKSPACE and cursor control keys can be used to move the
cursor  around  the  text  area, and the CLR HOME key will erase the entire
line which holds the cursor.  Note that .ALL files saved by versions of the
program  before  1.5  will  display gibberish in the text area when loaded.
This  is  normal,  and  can be written over with no danger of damaging your
data.

The MAP option displays a map of all track, sequences, and songs in memory,
including their names, comments and lengths in measures and events, as well
as  the  channel number and event type of the first event in each track and
sequence.   The  map and text area may be listed to a printer by pressing P
after  the  map is displayed on the screen.  The CONTROL key will terminate
printing when sending the map to a printer.  If SHIFT is held down when MAP
is  selected.   The map will be sent directly to the printer, without going
to the screen.

Print
~~~~~
PRINT  sends  a  copy of the current sequence or track to the printer.  The
range  is  set  as  described  above  for DELETE and ERASE.  If there is no
printer  conected  or if the printer doesn't respond, a dialog box will ask
if you want to abort or try again.
 
Change Repeats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  option,  which  only appears in Open mode, sets the number of times a
sequence  will play when started from, the Open mode play/record screen.  A
dialog  box  will ask you to specify a number from 1 - 99.  Enter 99 if you
want the sequence to repeat immediately.  When a sequence is started from a
control  sequence,  it  will  play the number of times that are specifed by
that control sequence.

Step Time Track 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
STEP  TIME APPEND is used to enter notes at the end of the current sequence
or  track  with the step time recording feature of the KCS.  See Chapter 9,
STEP  TIME  RECORD  for  more  information.   If you are in Track mode, you
should remember that the entire length of all tracks is the length of track
1.  Appending to track 1 thus increases the effective length.  Appends that
make  another  track  longer than track 1 will not be heard when all tracks
are played together.

STEP  TIME  TRACK  allows you to create a new track in step tine.  A dialog
box  will  ask  the  measure  at  which you wish to start recording and the
program  will set the time of the first event recorded so that it is at the
selected measure.  This feature allows you to add new material at any point
in a set of tracks.

Pressing F1 or left clicking on EXIT when in step time record will return
you to the edit screen. 

Find and Calc 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FIND  is  used  to  locate  a  particular  measure  in a track or sequence.
Entering  a number after clicking on FIND will place the edit cursor on the
event nearest to the start of that measure.

The  CALC  option  is  a  convenience  for  calculating the number of steps
between  two points.  Click on CALC, and an edit window will prompt you for
two  measure/step  values,  the  second  of  which  defaults to the current
position of the edit cursor.  After entering the values and clicking on OK,
the  difference  between  those  two points, in steps, will be shown on the
message  line.   If the exit button labeled CORRECT is chosen intead of OK,
the  program will attempt to "correct" the time of the current step to that
in  the  second  measure/step  entry  by  adding the calculated time to the
current  time.   This  allows you to enter a new event location in terms of
it's  measure and step directly in the CALC window without dealing with the
TIME setting.

After CALC is used to compute a time value, typing a "C" in the TIME column
will enter the calculated time value at that point.

Split 
~~~~~
SPLlT  allows  you to split the current sequence or track into two parts by
note  value.  A dialog box will ask you to specify the entire sequence or a
range.  It will also ask for a split point.  This must be entered as a MIDI
note number (60 = middle C).  All note events with note values greater than
or  equal  to  the  entered  note number will be copied to the first unused
sequence  or track and erased from, the original sequence.  Selecting SPLIT
with  a  split  point  of 60 will therefore remove all in notes at or above
middle  C  (C4)  from the current sequence or track and place them on a new
one.

SPLIT  followed  by  CHANNEL  ASSIGN  allows you to create a split keyboard
effect  for  a part that was recorded on a single MIDI channel.  It is also
possible  to  nondestructively  separate  all  the  note data in a track or
sequence  from  any  control  changes,  pitch  bends  or non-MIDI events by
setting  the  split point to 0; in this case, all note data will be sent to
the  new sequence or track, and the original sequence or track will contain
only the other data types.

Vary 
~~~~
The  VARY option is used to generate a variation on the current sequence or
track  by randomly changing the pitches, velocities, and/or location of the
ON  events  in  the sequence.  The original sequence or track is unaffcted,
the  variation  is piaced in the first available sequence or track, and the
variation  is  selected  for editing.  In Track mode, the original track is
also muted.

The VARY dialog box displays six variation presets, and asks for the number
of  individual  variations  to  perform.   The  actual number of variations
performed  might  be lower, as sometimes a note will be randonly chosen for
variation  more than once.  The presets consist of different algorithms for
altering  the  sequence or track.  HALFSTEP changes the pitch of a randomly
selected  note  by  a semitone.  This will add new notes to the sequence or
track  and  thereby  change  the  tonality of the phrase.  PITCHES randomly
transposes  selected notes by larger amounts, but won't allow any new notes
to  be  created.   (For  instance,  if  the  original sequence consisted or
nothing  but C4s and C5s, the variation might contain C4, C3, C5, etc., but
no Bs or other notes.)

SWAPS  will@ randomly swap the pitches and velocities of two notes; if they
are  adjacent  notes,  the  time,  channel  and duration values may also be
swapped.  The first note of the sequence or track is not affcted by SWAPS.

DYNAMICS  randomly  varies  the  velocities of the notes in the sequence or
track.   The  amount  or  variation  is  determined  by  the  amount in the
original.

MIX  1  and  MIX  2  make  random  changes  to  the pitches, velocities and
durations  of  selected  notes.  The amount of variation will depend on the
amount  of  variation  in the original sequence or track.  MIX 1 will allow
new  notes  to  occur,  and  MIX 2 only permits notes that are found in the
original to be used.

The  VARY  feature in the KCS is a very early spinoff from the Programmable
Variation  Generator/Master  Editor  portion  or the Level II KCS, which is
available  as  an  upgrade to owners or the current KCS.  Contact us or see
our advertising for details.

Copy Sequence, Copy Track to Track and Copy Track to Seq
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each  of  these  options  makes a permanent copy of the current sequence or
track.   In  Open mode, the COPY SEQUENCE option will bring up a dialog box
asking  you  to  select the sequence that you wish to copy to.  The default
will  be  the  first unused sequence.  If you copy to an existing sequence,
that sequence will be lost.

In Track mode, there are two ways to make a copy.  COPY TRACK TO TRACK will
copy  the current track to the first unused track.  Remember that both this
track  and  the  current  track will play unless you mute one of them.  The
MUTE and SWITCH features described in Chapter 6 allow you to easily compare
the original and edited track within the context that they are to be used.

COPY TRACK TO SEQ is used in the same way as COPY SEQUENCE.  This option is
useful for making a backup that will not be heard with your other tracks in
Track  mode.   It is also useful if you have a part that you want to use in
Track  mode  in more than one context, as you can use the COPY SEQ TO TRACK
option to get it back into Track mode at a later time.

Copy Seq to Track 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This  option  copies  an  Open mode sequence into the first unused track in
Track  mode.  Note that neither this option or the APPEND and MERGE options
descrebed  below  will have any effect on the sequence being copied, merged
or appended.

Seq to All Tracks and All Tracks to Seq
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  options  allow  you to move data back and forth between the 48 track
tape recorder environment of Track mode and individual Open mode scquences.
These  sequences can be chained or otherwise combined into longer pieces in
Song mode or by using control sequences in Open mode.

SEQ  TO  ALL  TRACKS  copies  an  Open  mode sequence into Track mode.  All
existing  tracks  are erased by this Option.  Events in the sequence copied
will  be  sorted  by MIDl channel, with each channel assigned to a diffrent
track, which makes this option handy for unmerging open mode sequences, for
editing  channels  independently  and  for  splitting up sequences recorded
from,  another sequencer.  Each track will be named with the channel of the
data that it contains.

ALL  TRACKS  TO SEQ will merge the data from all active tracks (tracks that
are  not muted) into a single Open mode sequence.  The length of the merged
sequence   will  be  determined  by  the  length  of  Track  1.   For  some
applications  you  may want to create different sequences using this option
with different combinations of muted and unmuted tracks.

When  ALL  TRACKS  TO  SEQ  is  chosen  an edit wmdow will appear after the
sequence  selection  dialog  box in which you can enter a name and comments
for  the sequence.  The comments for the sequence will default to a list of
the  unmuted tracks or the list can be cleared by clicking on the field and
pressing CLR HOME.  The edit window also has a button labeled INCLUDE MUTED
TRACKS.  If INCLUDE MUTED TRACKS is turned on, all tracks will be copied to
the  new  sequence, regardless of their status.  ALL TRACKS TO SEQ can also
be selected directly from, the Track mode play screen with the !  (SHIFT-1)
key.

Append and Append Seq to Track
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  options  allow  you  to  append an Open mode sequence to the current
sequence  or  track.  A copy of the appended sequence is simply tacked onto
the end of the sequence or track being edited.

Merge
~~~~~
Available  in Open mode only, this option merges a second sequence with the
sequence  being  edited.   The  sequence  will  now  sound  as  though both
sequences  were  playing at once.  In track mode, this task is accomplished
using the BACKSLASH key from the play/record screen.

Delete Sequence and Delete Track
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  options  allow you to delete an unwanted track or sequence.  A dilog
box  will  request  the sequence or track number; the selection in this box
defaults  to the current track or sequence.  Sequences Y and Z and track 1,
can not be deleted.

Clear and Double 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CLEAR erases all tracks in memory.  It does not erase anything from Open or
Song modes.  An edit window will allow you to set the length of all tracks,
in  measures.   If you do so, the program will create track 1 with a single
DE  event  whose  TIME  is  the  desired  length.   This will determine the
effective  length  of any additional tracks that you record.  If you change
your  mind,  you can also cancel the operation from this wondow.  After the
clear  operation,  the  program  will put you on the Track mode play/record
screen.

DOUBLE  simply  doubles  the  length of all tracks.  Any events which would
havc played after the end of track 1 are lost.  Since the length of track 1
sets  the loop point for all 48 tracks, you could extend a set of tracks by
half  their  length  by using the DOUBLE option, then shortening track 1 by
the required amount.

Ext (Atari ST Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  your ST has 1 meg or more of memory, the EXT option can be used to load
up  to  four other Dr.  T programs into memory at once, thanks to our mulli
Program Environment (MPE).  Clicking on EXT will cause a GEM file selection
window  to  appear, where you must select a .INF file for the program to be
loaded.  This file contains information about the program to be loaded.  If
there is enough memory available to load the new program, it will be loaded
and  a  three letter abbreviation for the new program (FTN for Fingers, for
example) will appear on the EXT line.

Once an external program is loaded, clicking on it's abbreviation will take
you to that program, or clicking here while holding down the SHIFT key will
erase the last prcgram loaded and free up the memory used.

Note that the external programs use memory that would otherwise be used for
event  storage,  so  there  are some tradeoffs involved in loading mulyiplr
programs,  especially  on  the  1040 ST (as opposed to a Mega ST, that is).
Some programs, especially our algorithmic composers, may also overwrite one
or  more sequences when they are loaded.  Check the manual for each program
for  this  type  of  thing  before loading the program, in order to prevent
accidental and unsightly loss of data.

Programs to be loaded via the MPE MUST be loaded from drive A. It is not
possible to load MPE programs from a hard disk, even if the original disk
is inserted in drive A. Attempting to do so will result in a system crash.
.INF files may be stored on any drive, however.

WorkBench, NewCLI, and Drag Bar -> (Amiga Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  buttons are used to access the Amiga's multi-tasking functions.  The
WORKBENCH  switch is used to toggle the state of the WorkBench window (that
is  open  the  WorkBench if it's closed, or close it if it's open).  If you
attempt  to  close  the  WorkBench while a window is open on the WorkBench,
either a CLI wndow or a window from some other program, the KCS will not be
able to close the WorkBench.

The  NEWCLI  switch  is  used  to  open  a CLl window.  When this button is
selected,  the WorkBench screen will move to the fore and a CLI window will
appear.   The  operation  of  the  KCS will be suspended until you type the
command "EndCLI".

The  DRAG  BAR -> button is intended as a reminder on how to toggle the KCS
drag  bar  at the top of the screen.  Moving the mouse to the right edge of
the  screen  and  clicking  the  left mouse button will cause a drag bar to
appear  at  the  top  of  the  screen.   You can now move the KCS screen in
relation  to  any  other screens using the gadgets on the drag bar, as with
most other Amiga programs.

The  Amiga  version of the KCS will continue running when other windows are
in  use  (except  as  noted  above), so you may use any of your other Amiga
software  (including  Dr.   T's  Caged Artist patch editors for the Amiga!)
while  your  music  plays.   See  your  Amiga  documentation  for  more  on
multi-tasking.

Play and Play/Record
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  options  take  you  to  the  play  screen  of  the mode that you are
currently in.  The Track and Open mode play screens are described in detail
in  Chapters 6 and 7.  The Track Mode Play screen automatically puts you in
record.   To  record  in  Open  mode,  you have to select the record option
described below.

The PLAY option displays a dialog box with five options.  GO TO PLAY SCREEN
takes  you  directly  to  the play screen.  Double clicking the right mouse
button  from  the edit screen (or single clicking the right mouse while the
SHIFT  key  is  held  down)  will  accomplish the same thing.  PLAY CURRENT
SEQUENCE plays the sequence or track currently displayed.  PLAY FROM CURSOR
POSITION  plays the current sequence or track from the position of the edit
cursor;  clicking  the  right  mouse button once does the same thing.  PLAY
CURRENT  CUE  plays the sequence or track from the current cue point, which
can  be  set from the play screen, or with the SET AND PLAY NEW CUE option.
In  Open  mode, a dialog box will ask for a sequence and a starting measure
when  the  SET  AND  PLAY CUE optIon is selected; play will then start from
this  point.   In  Track  mode,  the  dialog  box will ask you to enter the
measure  of  the  new  cue  point, and all tracks will be started from that
measure.

If  you choose any option other than Go To PLAY SCREEN, the edit sreen will
be  displayed  during play.  The word PLAY will appear on the mcssage line.
You  can  stop  play  at any point by pressing the left mouse button or Fl.
You  can  also  restart play from, the beginning by pressing FlO, the SPACE
bar,  or  the right mouse button.  Tf you do neither, the word PLAY will be
erased  and  all  edit  functions  will  return  to  normal as soon as play
completes.

If  a  range  of events is highlighted, then clicking the right ouse button
will play only that range.  If no events are highlighted clicking the right
mouse will play the track or sequence from the edit cursor position.

Record 
~~~~~~
This  is  used  to  enter the record screen from Open mode only.  Open mode
recording is described in detail in Chapter 7.

Load/Save 
~~~~~~~~~
Thc LOAD and SAVE options are described in detail in Chapter 10.

Set Options 
~~~~~~~~~~~
This  feature  lets  you  change  a  number  of parameters that are used by
different  parts  of  the  program.   It  brings  up an edit window that is
described in more detail in Chapter 11.

TRACK Mode, OPEN Mode, and SONG Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These options, only two of which are available from any screen, are used to
move  between  the program's three operating modes.  When you enter Open or
Song  modes, the program, will place you on the edit screen; when you enter
Track  mode, the program will place you on the play/record screen.  You can
then get to the Track mode edit screen by pressmg F1 or clicking on EXIT.

Colors (Amiga Only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When  the  COLORS  option  is  selected, a small requestor box will appear,
where  you  may  adjust  the screen colors used by the program.  The screen
colors are automatically saved and loaded with enviroment (.ENV) files.

Quit 
~~~~
QUIT  will  exit from the KCS and return you to the desktop (or WorkBench).
Be  sure  to  save your data before quitting.  A dialog box will ask you to
confirm the choice.

                               Chapter 5
                               ~~~~~~~~~
                           SONG MODE EDITING
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Song  mode provides a simple environment for creating longer pieces (songs)
by  chaining  Open mode sequences.  This task can be accomplished much more
generally   with   control  sequences  in  Open  mode,  but  Song  mode  is
conceptually  much  simpler.   You  may want to create a few pieces in Song
mode  before  you attempt to use control sequences.  You may also choose to
do  all  of  your  sequence  chaining  in Song mode.  Song mode is intended
primarily for use with multi-instrument sequences created in Track mode, as
only one sequence can play at any time.  There is certainly no limit to the
complexity of the music that you can create using Track mode and Song mode.

The  Song mode edit screen allows you to create songs that consist of up to
100  linked  segments.  For each segment you can specify the sequence to be
played,  a  tempo change, a delay, a pitch transposition, and the number of
times the segment is to repeat.  You can also specify program and/or volume
changes  on  any  or  all of the 16 MIDI channels for each segment.  Tempo,
program  and  volume  change  entries are optional; if you do not specify a
tempo  change for a segment, it will play at the current tempo.  No program
or  volume  changes  will be made by the program on channels for which they
have not been specified.  Sequences entered in Song mode should not contain
PRIMARY, ST, XX, XL, MS, or US events, as these are ignored in Song mode.

Entering Segments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Song  segments  are  entered  into an event list that is similar to the one
used  in  Track  and  Open modes.  Although the headings are different, the
procedure  for  is entry and edit of individual segments is similar to that
described  in Chapter 4.  As in the other modes, any of the edit options on
the  right  side  of the screen can be selected by clicking on that option,
and  songs can be selected with the select boxes in the lower right corner.
The fields used in the Song mode event list are:

SEG:   A  number  supplied  by  the  program indicating the position of the
segment  in  the  list.   SEG is used to specify a range of segments in the
song when you are using the various edit options.

SEQ:   The  number  <1 - 9, A - X, or 00 - 92) of the sequence to be paayed
for  the segment.  Frequently, this will be the only entry that you need to
make for a segment.

NAME: The name of the sequence to be played.  This is supplied by the
program, and cannot be changed in Song mode.

TEMPO:   The  tempo  at  which  the  segment  is  to be played.  If this is
omitted,  the segment will play at the previously established tempo.  Tempo
changes  will have no effect unless you are using the internl clock, though
it is used in calculations when synchronizing to an external clock.

DELAY:   The number of time steps that you wish the program to pause before
playing the segment.  Most of the time, you will probably not need to enter
a DELAY.

TRN:   The  number of half steps that you wish the segment to be transposed
in  pitch.   If  a drum channel has been defined on the SET OPTIONS screen,
notes on that channel will not be transposed.

REP:  The number of times that you wish the segment to repeat.  If you want
the segment to play only once, you do not need to enter this field.

When  you  first  enter  Song  mode,  the edit screen will come up, and the
cursor  will  be under SEQ on the first line.  To enter a segment, type the
desired  sequence  number, and any other fields that you wish to enter, and
press  RETURN.   You can use the TAB and SHlFT-TAB keys to move forward and
back  along  a  line.   The  DELAY and TRN fields default to 0, and the REP
field  to  1,  so  if  you  want  your sequence to play once vwih no delay,
transposition, or tempo change, you need only enter the sequence number.

Here is a shot of the Song mode edit screen, with a representative song
in ihc event list:

These  seven  segments  illustrate all of the options available on the left
side  of  the screen.  The first segment entered was sequence 1, at a tempo
of  90  BPN.   If  no tempo had been entered, the segment would play at the
previously set tempo, shown at the bottom of the play screen.  Tempo change
events  within  the  sequences  themselves  will change the tempo from that
programmed on the Song mode edit screen.

The  second  segment  plays  sequence  F  with  the tempo increased to 120.
Sequences  3  and  4 are each played once at the same tempo.  Sequence 5 is
then  played twice at a tempo of 140, and then twice again transposed up 12
half steps (an octave).  Finally, sequence 6 plays at a tempo of 120.  This
segment  does  not start until 48 time steps (half a measure at the default
setting) after the previous segment ends.

To  play  the  song,  click  the right mouse button, and the Song mode play
screen  will come up.  Click the right mouse button or press Fl to play the
song.  The Song mode play scrcen is described in detail in Chapter 8.

Editing Single Segments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Segments  are  edited  using  the same procedure used in the Track and Open
mode edit screens.  Move the edit cursor to the line that you wish to edit,
and  click  the  mouse.   Type in any desired changes, and press RETURN, or
press UNDO to cancel any changes.  If you want to remove a tempo, repeat or
delay  specification,  just  type  over  it with blanks.  You can delete an
entire  segment  by pressing the DELETE key while the cursor is on the line
you wish to delete.

If  you  want  to add segments to a song, click under SEQ on the line below
the  last segment shown.  If your song is more than a full screen long, you
can  use  the  scroll arrows to move up and down.  A song can contain up to
100 segments.

Song Mode Editing Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  Song  mode edit options, on the right side of the screen, are selected
by  clicking  the  mouse  as  in  the other modes.  Most of the options are
similar  to  corresponding options on the Open and Track mode edit screens,
described in Chapter 4.

Name
~~~~
The  song  name  is 60 characters long, and stretches across the top of the
screen.  Clicking on NAME, or anywhere on the line, will move the cursor to
this line.  Type in the desired name and press RETURN.

Text and Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  TEXT  option  provides  access to the KCS's comment text area, and MAP
displays  information  about  every  active track, sequence, and song.  See
Chapter 4 for more on these options.

Prog/Vol Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can specify program and/or volume changes for any or all of the 16 MIDI
channels  to  be sent before a segment is started.  Move the edit cursor to
the  line  containing  the segment that you want to insert changes for, and
then  click  the mouse on PROG/VOL CHANGES on the right side of the screen.
An edit window with data fields for MIDI program and volume change commands
on  all  16  channels will appear.  The segment number will be displayed at
the top of the window.

Data  is  entered  in  the usual manner for edit windows.  MIDI program and
volume  numbers  range  from 0 - 127, though not all instruments respond to
MIDI  volume changes and most instruments do not use all 128 patch numbers.
Different  instrumens  also  use  different  patch numbering systems.  MIDI
patch  number 0 will for example, call up patch off on an Oberheim Matrix 6,
patch  1  on Yamaha instruments, preset 1 on a CZ-10l, and patch 11 on Korg
instruments.   In  general  when  you  have  difficulties  interfacing MIDI
devices,  the  Doctor's  precription is REXMAN (Relax, EXperiment, and read
your owner's MANuals).

The  program and volume changes will be sent before the selected segment in
played.   No  program  or  volume information will be sent for channels for
which no data was entered.

Insert and Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking on INSERT or pressing the INSERT key will open up a blank line, as
in  the  other  modes.  Type in the new segments pressing RETURN after each
one,  or UNDO after any mistakes.  Click the m*ouse on a new line to cancel
INSERT.

Pressing the DELETE key will delete the segment under the cursor.

Copy Song to Song and Copy Song to Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COPY  SONG TO SONG lets you copy the current song to the first unused song.
COPY  SONG  TO  SEQ  lets you copy the segment list to an Open mode control
sequence.   Open  mode control sequences, described in Chapter 4, provide a
more  general way to arrange your sequences into songs.  If you decide that
your  song  needs  some more parts, you may want to use Copy Song to Seq to
get  the  song  into  Open  mode,  and then add more parts using overdub or
record  with  cue.   Copying  a  song to a sequence is also a good starting
point  for  understanding  the  structure of control sequences.  you should
remember  that  you  cannot  go  the  other  way; there is no way to copy a
control sequence to a song.

Append and Delete Song
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You  can append another song to the current song or delete an unwanted song
from memory by clicking on APPEND or DELETE SONG.  Dialog boxes will prompt
for the song to append or delete.

Song to All Tracks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  on  this  option  will  delete all tracks currently in Track mode
memory  and  place  the current song in all tracks by copying each sequence
used  in the song to all tracks.  This is useful for overdubbing solo parts
or  controllers  over  an  entire  song:   but  makes editing the song more
difficult.

Since  coping  a  song  to all tracks requires quite a bit of the computers
memory  for  work space, it is possible that you may get an "out of memory"
message when doing this with a long song.

Other Options 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  remaining  options  on  the Song mode edit screen are identical to the
coresponding  options  in  Open and Track modes.  See Chapters 4, 10 and 11
for  more  details  on PLAY, LOAD/SAVE, SET OPTIONS, OPEN MODE, TRACK MODE,
and QUIT.

                              Chapter 6
                              ~~~~~~~~~
                        TRACK MODE PLAY/RECORD
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  Track  mode play/record screen of the KCS functions as a 48 track tape
recorder, with all the controls usually found on a mehanical tape recorder,
as  well as many more that have no counterparts on the physical instrument.
All  aspects of recording and playback are controlled in real time from the
play/record screen.

Track  mode  can  be used in many different ways in composition.  An entire
piece can be recorded in Track mode, using tracks that run the whole length
of the piece, or completed tracks can be moved to Open mode and linked with
other tracks in Song mode, or in Open mode using control sequences.

Play/Record 
~~~~~~~~~~~
The Track mode play/record screen will appear whenever
Track mode is entered from one of the other
two modes, and when the program is first booted.  The play/record
screen looks like this:
 
The  screen  is  divided  into  three sections:  the track status area, the
control  panet,  and the message line.  The track status apea, in the upper
portion  of  the  screen,  displays the play status of each of the first 36
tracks.   Activity on any track is also shown in the track status area by a
musical  note  icon, which changes color as notes occur on that track.  The
control  panel,  in  the  lower  part  of  the screen, contains a number of
buttons  and  indicators  which mimic the operation of a trap recorder, the
message  line, at the very bottom of the screen, displays messages relating
to  various  controls  that aren't shown on the control panbel.  All of the
buttons  on  the control panel can be activated with the mouse, or from the
computer's  key6board.   In  addition, there are a number of other controls
which  can  be  accessed  only from the keyboard or the SET OPTIONS screen.
Each control is described in detail later in this chapter.

Each track has two designations: its track number, which is a number from 1
- 48, and an associated track key, which is a single key on the computer
keyboard. Tracks are selected either by pressing the appropriate track key,
or by clicking on that track in the status area. Selecting a track is not
used to determine which track to record on, since recording is always done
on the lowest numbered free track, but to apply the currently selected
track option to a track. The track options are used to mute or solo a
track, as well as for other functions.

Recording in Track Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recording  starts  when a note is played on the controller connected to the
computer's  MIDI  in,  when the PLAY button is clicked, or when the FlO key
(or  the  SPACE  bar)  is  pressed.  As soon as recording starts the visual
metronome  will  start  to flash, the audible metronome will start to beep,
and  the measure/step counter will start counting.  Recording ends when the
FlO  key  is pressed, or when the end of track 1 is reached, if track 1 has
already been recorded.  (The time at which recording stops is also affected
by  the ALIGN option, described later.) At this point, recording will start
on  the  next  available  track,  and  continue until the end of track 1 is
reached again.  This process repeats until all 48 tracks are full, or until
the  sequencer  is  stopped.   Recording can be turned on and off while the
sequencer  is  running by clicking on the RECORD button or pressing F2, and
all of the other controls can be changed during recoed or playback as well.

Track Options 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  track  options allow you to determine what will happen to a track when
it is selected, either with the mouse or by pressing a track key.  Only one
track  option  can  be  active at a time.  Some of the track options can be
selected  from  the  control  panel or the keyboard, while others which are
used less frequently can only be selected from the keyboard.

The  default  track option is MUTE.  When MUTE is active, selecting a track
will  "silence"  that  track;  the  track  can be unmuted by selecting it a
second  time,  as  long as the MUTE track option is active.  Muting a track
will cause that track's status display to change from PLAY to MUTE.

The other track options are SOLO, SET SWITCH, SET PUNCH, CLEAR/RESET PUNCH,
ERASE  PUNCH,  COPY PUNCH, ERASE TRACK, SHIFT, SWAP, EDIT SELECT, and NAME.
Each track option is described in detail later in this chapter.

Punch-In
~~~~~~~~
Punching is used to replace a portion of an otherwise good track.  The term
"punching"  is  borrowed  from  multi track terminology, where it refers to
re-recording  a  section of a track by punching the record button in at the
start of the unwanted section and punching out at the end.

Punching  on  the  KCS  is a little different than punching on a tape deck.
Instead  of  erasing  the  punched  portion of a track, the track is simply
muted  for  the  duration  of  the  punch and new data is recorded on a new
track.   Once  a  good  replacement  track  has been recorded, the original
punched  data  can  be  erased  and  the two tracks merged.  The details on
punching  can  be  found latcr in this chapter, in the section on the PUNCH
buttons.

RECORD 
~~~~~~
The  RECORD  button  on  the control panel is used to turn recording on and
off.   This  button  will light up when recording is activated.  Record can
also be turned on or off with the F2 key.

STOP, PAUSE, and PLAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  on  STOP  will  stop playback of all tracks, complete the current
recording  (if  record  is on), and reset the sequencer to the beginning of
all tracks, or to the current cue point, if one is selected.  The ENTER key
duplicates this function.

Clicking  on  PAUSE  or  pressing  the  ESC  key  will temporarily stop the
sequencer.   Notes  played on the keyboard will not be recorded when paused
though  controllers  may  be  recorded  depending  on  the  setting  of the
CONTROLLER  PAUSE switch on the SET OPTIONS screen.  Clicking on PAUSE will
restart the sequencer.

PLAY  starts  the  sequencer.  If recording is enabled recording will start
when  PLAY is selected.  If a cue point has been set, playback or recording
will start from that point.  Playback can also be started with the FlO key,
the SPACE bar, or the right mouse button.

CLOCK and MEASURE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The  CLOCK  display  shows  the  current clock source, and the tempo of the
internal clock.  If MIDI is displayed next to CLOCK, then the external MIDI
clock is in use.  Otherwise, the internal clock tempo is shown in beats per
minute (BPM).

Clicking  on  the  >>  or << symbols will incrcase or decrease the internal
tempo  by  an  amount  set  by the TEMPO CHANGE BY RATIO control, described
under  HIDDEN  CONTROLS,  below.   Holding  the mouse button down while the
mouse  pointer  is  on  one  of  these symbols will cause a rapid change in
tempo.   Pressing  the, and .  keys (COMMA and PERIOD) will also change the
tempo.

The  MEASURE  display  shows  the  current location of the sequencer during
record and playback, in measures and steps.

RE-RECORD, RE-RECORD STOP and ERASE TRK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking  on  RE-RECORD  or  pressing  UNDO  will  erase the current track.
Normally,  this  option  will  stop  the sequencer and set the measure/step
counter  to  the  beginning  of  the  sequence (or current cue point).  The
automatic  stop  feature  can  be turned off from the SET OPTIONS screen by
turning off the RE-RECORD STOP button.  In this case, clicking on RE-RECORD
will erase the current track, without affecting the sequencer's playback.

ERASE  TRK  causes  the most recently recorded complete track to be erased,
along  with the current record track.  This function is duplicated by the ?
key.   Be careful when using this button, as the sequencer will not ask you
to confirm this selection before erasing these tracks!

Tracks  can  also  be erased with the erase track option.  When this option
(which  can only be selected with the CLR HOWlE key) is active, selecting a
track will erase that track.  A question will appear on the message line to
confirm  this  choice.   Answer  "y" to erase the track, or "n" to keep the
track.  Select another track option, such as MUTE, to turn this option off.

CNTRLRS and AFTOUCH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  options  are  used  to  enable  or  disable  the  recording  of MIDI
controllers  such  as  pitch  bend  patch  changes and aftertouch.  CNTRLRS
affects  all  MIDI  data  except  note data and aftertouch, and can also be
toggled  with  the  COLON (:) key.  The AFTOUCH function is duplicated with
the QUOTE (') key.

When  recording controllers, if a pitch bend or sustain pedal (CC 64) event
is recorded, a zero pitch bend and/or sustain pedal off event are placed at
the  end  of the recording.  This prevents hanging or mistuned notes if the
affected  sequence  is looped or joined to another sequence, either in Open
mode  or  by  using  the  DOUBLE  or APPEND options in Trace mode.  This is
helpful in most circumstances, but you may need to edit these events out if
you are recording a part that is to be spliced into an existing sequence.

QUANT
~~~~~
When  this switch is on, any events recorded will be rounded to the nearest
time interval represented by the musical icon below the QUANT switch.  This
is similar to the AUTO-CORRECT edit option, but also effects controller and
other  non-note  data  types  as well, and cannot be undone.  Only quantize
values  represented  by  the  available note icons may be selected from the
play/record  screen,  but  any  value  desired  may be entered from the SET
OPTIONS window.

MERGE and ECHO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The MERGE and ECHO buttons toggle the MIDI merge and echo features. MIDI
merge is used to mix data from the computer's MIDI in with data from the
sequencer, for transmission through the MIDI out jack. This is necessary
when using the KCS in conjunction with a master keyboard to control a set
of expander modules.

ECHO  is  similar  to  MERGE,  except  that  data is rechannelized prior to
mergina and/or recording.  Clicking on ECHO causes a display of the current
echo  channel to appear beneath the ECHO button; clicking on the associated
>> and << symbols will change the echo channel.

The  functions  of  the  MERGE  and  ECHO  buttons  are duplicated with the
SEMICOLON  (;)  and BACKSPACE keys, respectively.  When ECHO is active, the
status of the MERGE switch is ignored.

MUTE, SOLO and SET SWITCH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These  three  track options are used to selectively mute one or more tracks
during playback.  MUTE, which was described earlier in the section on track
options can also be activated with the F3 key.

A  block of adjacent tracks can be muted or umuted by holding down the left
mouse  button and dragging the mouse over those tracks.  The status of each
track will toggle as the mouse passes over it.

The  MUTE  function can also be modified using the SHIFT and ALTERNATE keys
in  conjunction  with  the  mouse.  If ALTERNATE is held down while MUTE is
active  and a track is selected with the mouse, that track will be muted if
it ts playing, but will not be unmuted is it is already muted.  Conversely,
holding  down  SHIFT while selecting a track with the mouse will unmute any
muted  tracks, but will not mute tracks.  (Think of the ALTERNATE and SHIFT
keys as meaning "mute only" and "unmute only" respectively.)

The  SOLO  track  option  is used to solo a track, that is, mute all tracks
except  the  selected track.  Selecting the track a second time will unmute
the other tracks.  SOLO can also be selected by pressing F8.

SET  SWITCH  is  used  to set up a "switch" which will alternately mute and
unmute  two selected tracks.  Selecting a track after this option is chosen
will  change  that  track's status to SWITCH; selecting a second track will
change  the  first  track's  status to PLAY and the second track's to MUTE.
The  RETURN  key  can  then  be  used to alternately switch between the two
tracks.   After  the  second  track  is  selected,  the  track  option will
automatically  change  to MUTE.  The SET SWITCH option can only be selected
with the F9 key, and not from the control panel.

Note that muting a track which contains OFF events (which are only recorded
for  notes  with release velocity or for notes greater than 999 steps long)
could cause some notes to stick.  Stopping the sequencer, or pressing the "
(SHIFT-ACCENT) key, will clear any stuck notes.

EXIT and Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicking on EXIT or pressing F1 will stop the sequencer and transfer you to
the  Track mode edit screen.  Pressing the HELP key will stop the sequencer
and display a list of the track mode keyboard commands.  These commands are
also  listded  in the TRACK MODE COMMAND REFERENCE LISTS at the end of this
manual.

PUNCH 
~~~~~
The buttons under PUNCH are used to access the sequencer's punch in and out
capabilities.   The  punch buttons are all track options so only one can be
selected  at a time, and selecting any other track option will deselect the
punch buttons.

SET  PTS  is used to set the start and stop points for a punch.  The F4 key
duplicates  this  function.   When this track option is active, selecting a
track will set the start point for the punch:  the track will also be muted
and  will  appear  in  the status display under PUN.  Selecting the track a
second  time  will  set  the end point for the punch, and the track will be
umnuted  and  the  word  ON  will  appear  under  PUN.  If the track is not
selected  again before the track stops, the end punch point will default to
the  end  of  the  track.   As  the track loops, the display under PUN will
change  from  ON  to  OFF when the punched out section is playing, and back
again when the end punch point is reached.

If  punch  points  have  already  been set for a track, then selecting that
track  will change either the start or end point of the punch.  Selecting a
track  while that track is punched OUT will change the end punch point, and
selecting  the track while it is on will set a new start point.  Each track
can only have one set of punch points, but separate punch points can be set
for as many tracks as needed.

The  clear punch points track option is selected by clicking on CLR PTS, or
by  pressing  F5.   Selecting  a  track  while  this  option is active will
temporarily  remove  the punch points in that track, and unmute the punched
section.  Click the mouse a second time to restore the punch points.

Clicking  on  ERS  PUN  or  pressing  F6  selects  the  erase punch option.
Selecting a track while this option is active erases the punched section of
that  track and optionally merges the most recently recorded track with the
original.   When a track is selected, a prompt asking for one of three keys
to  be  pressed  will  appear  on  the  message line.  Press Y to erase the
punched data, L to erase the punched data and merge the track with the last
track  recorded  (thereby  replacing  the punched data), or N to cancel the
command.

CPY PUN or the F7 key will select the copy punch track option.  Selecting a
track with active punch points will copy the punched data to the next empty
track,  and  delete  that data from the original track.  The new track will
also be muted.

CUE 
~~~
The  CUE button is used to activate Track mode's cue loop.  When CUE is on,
the sequencer will repeatedly loop the material contained between the start
(FROM)  and  end  (TO)  points  of  the  cue  loop.   Clicking  on CUE will
immediately  start all tracks at the beginning of the cue loop; clicking on
PLAY  when the CUE button is lit has the same effect.  The TAB key can also
be  used  to  activate the cue loop, and the SLASH (/) key will turn cueing
off.

The  start  and  stop points for the cue loop can be changed in a number of
ways.   With the mouse, clicking on the > > and << symbols will move either
cue  point  forward  or  backward.   These  controls  are duplicated on the
computer keyboard by the cursor control keys, with the CURSOR UP and CURSOR
DOWN keys controlling the start point, and the CURSOR LEFT and CURSOR RIGHT
keys affecting the end point.

The  amount  the  cue points move each time one of these buttons is pressed
can bm changed with the INSERT key.  Normally, the cue point move amount is
one  measure;  pressing  the  INSERT key changes this to eight measures and
pressing it again will change it back to one measure.

The  last  one,  two,  four,  or  i@ght  measures played can be replayed by
pressing  the LEFT BRACKET ([), RIGHT BRACKET (]), ACCENT('), and EQUAL (=)
keys  respectively, Pressing one of these keys will move the cue point back
by the appropriate amount and start the sequencer at that point, though the
cue  loop  will  not  be  activated.  These buttons are handy if you hear a
mistake  or  other point of interest while listening to the tracks and want
to hear it again.

Cueing  can be used for recording as well as playback.  When a new track is
recorded  with  the cue loop active, the program adds time to the beginning
of that track to align it to the other tracks.

If  the  start  point for the cue loop has been changed since the last time
the  cue  was  played,  there  may  be  a slight delay between loops as the
sequencer advances to the start of the loop.
