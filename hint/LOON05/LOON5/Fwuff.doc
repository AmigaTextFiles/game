	First of all, WELCOME to the wonderful world of FWUFF, where
everything is cute and FWUFFY,

			BUT..............

	The evil Dr.Shpindrier is on the rampage-tring to remove all of
the FWUFFS from the face of the planet (wait for it...) FWUFF!
	
	Now, the remarkable thing about FWUFFS is their ability to transport
themselves; But they are so stupid, that they never think of transporting
to get themselves out of trouble.  This is where you come in...

	Your Job...
       =============

	You must, using your mouse (the little grey thing with a wire, NOT
the little grey thing with four legs, a tail, ears, etc. that lives in a 
cage in your kitchen?!?), click on a FWUFF, and then on an empty tile, to
make the FWUFF jump over another FWUFF, thus transporting him to a planet
far from the evil Dr.Shpindrier.

	On each level there are a cirtain number of FWUFFS, of which a
slightly smaller number of which have to be saved.  You also have a limited
amount of moves (1 move = 1 jump) in which to complete the level.  When you
have made all the possible moves, click on the QUIT icon, to move on to the
next level.  There are FORTY levels for you to work through, and in practice
I have found that people can only reach about the 9th level on their first
go.  Can you do any better?  Drop me a line....(ouch!) (address below)

	And now for the legal moves.......:-)
 (F)=Fwuff       (S)=Blank Tile
 (A)=Fruit       (N)=No tile                                                 
   
     First        Tile in           second 
        click	    the middle         click
         :               :               :
         :               :               :
         :               :               :                                                     
        (F)             (F)             (S)        Can move!!                   
         :               :               :
         :               :               :
        (F)             (F)             (F)        Can't move 
   	 : 		 :	         :
	 :		 :	         :
	(F)             (N)             (S)        Can't move
	 :		 :	         :
	 :		 :	         :                                                                 
        (F)		(A) 		(S)	   Can move!!
	 :		 : 		 :
	 : 		 :		 :
	(F)		(F)		(A)	   Can`t move

	I think that you get the general idea now-oh! and I forgot to 
mention there are transporters ( which transport the FWUFF elsewhere on
the level), and the evil henchmen ( a `wormie' and a `fuz', which don't
actually do anything, but never mind) which the FWUFFS jump ON TO, not over.
	
	If you have any problems, don't hesitate ( I think that's how you
spell it) to drop me a line (ouch!) (bad joke, not funny) at the addresssss
below...;-]     (wink,wink, nudge, nudge!!!!)

	Addressesssss and other bits'n'pieces...
