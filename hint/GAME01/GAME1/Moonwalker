-------
LEVEL 1
-------

 There are 4 different area settings in the film studios where there
are 7 parts of a rabbit costume which need to be collected by Michael
so as he can disguise himself from his fans. AMIGA users have to
collect parts of the rabbit suit in order, so watch the radar for some
flashing hints as to their location. Avoid at all costs Granny and her
Grandson, the cowboys on horseback, the Biff brothers and the Japanese
tourists aws they will take one of your coveted Platinum discs. Once
you have collected the complete rabbit suit and the 4 special items you
must find the waiting motorbike to escape to Michaelsville.


-----------------------
LEVEL 2 - MICHAELSVILLE
-----------------------

 Unfortunately Mr Big has seen through your disguise and tipped off
your fans too. Road blocks have been set up which divide the town into
sections. Bright shining orbs have to be collected whilst you're on
your motorbike to transform you into a glittering Stratus sports car
able to leap the barriers. This effect lasts for only 10 seconds so
choose your path with care. If you fail to make it, you will need a
fresh set of orbs. As you zoom around the streets, Mr Big's drug hoards
can be destroyed by running over them. Occasionally you can also run
over a trooper before he gets ahead of you. If you get far enough, then
it's only a jet-ski ride from freedom, that is if the Biff brothers
don't get you.


-----------------
LEVEL 3 - CLUB 30
-----------------

 So you think you're safe in Club 30? Not for long as Mr Big has
discovered your hideout and means to dispose of your smartly. Trooper
guards suddenly appear at windows and doors, but so do the children, so
be careful. With out disguise a gun and ammunition must be found so you
can tackle Mr. Big's task force. Act swiftly to guide the children to
safety.


-------------------
LEVEL 4 - THE ARENA
-------------------

 Mr Big has kidnapped Katy to lure you to his lair for what must surely
be the final confrontation. Troopers and Storm Troopers are gathered
together to finish you off with their powerful laser guns. Take out
each foe as they appear, but beware the mighty plasma cannon that
Mr Big has installed as you need to destroy it before it destroys you.
Can you survive to take the children to safety.
