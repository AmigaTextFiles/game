Bob Morane Ocean Instructions:

	I have not solved the game but have progressed. After the
planes drop you in the ocean you must either knock the other guy
off his watercycle or press the ESCAPE button. When the real game
starts you are a amphibious vehicle. Your screen shows the land
immediately in front of you (you only go forwards). Fire the
joystick to destroy rock formations. 

	By pressing the RETURN key, you bring up a view of the
entire playing area. The white bases are friendly©©do not destroy
them. They will refuel your engines and guns. The small red
things are enemy patrols. Simply use the joystick to move the
cursor over one of these, and press the fire button. You will
then move towards that enemy or base. Shoot all rock formations
in your way or steer clear. If you go to far, your energy will
run out and the game ends. 

	When reaching an enemy patrol, the game will automatically
ALERT and send you underwater. Simply shoot the mechanical robots
while avoiding their bombs. When you are all done, you will come
back to the ship automatically. Sometimes you will have to knife
fight a guy. Both arcade sequences are easily mastered. In the
knife fight sequence there is a robotic device which can be
knifed to the bottom the ocean floor  but I do not know what it
does.

	The two bars to the right of the screen are fuel and gun
power reserves. The rightmost is firepower, the leftmost is fuel.
Finally  you can press F7 key to auto ALERT. Note: make sure your
room is dark to see all of the detailed graphics.
