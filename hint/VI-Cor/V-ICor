Here yah go.

Put the tape recorder on the plinth in front of the Lord of Infinity then
place the light of Valhalla in it's glass case on the altar in the middle of
the room, operate the tape recorder. In his fury the Lord of Infinity
radiates lasers from his eyes and in doing so destroys the glass case
containing the light of Valhalla, grab this and insert it viciously into the
evil lords chest, he screams and wails and disappears forever.....well for a
little while at least.

Enjoy. :)
