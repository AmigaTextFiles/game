	The Ultimate Amiga Cheat list (CheatSheet) was created 
	   by Mark Shnayer, and he reserves all the rights.

	Since all of us should have notice, The Mark's Cheat List is
 great but, since it's a large list, searching a title is very slow
 and what my 'Cheat Sheet Lister' does is speed up searching whit an
 included index file called 'CheatsList'.

	I think the program is intuitibly usable, (Pointer at top of
 screen scrolls the list up, Pointer at bottom scrolls down.) just
 load it and you would not need any further instructions.

	Except off course the non so obvious:

	Print a Cheat	  - Press the Help key
	Search a Title    - Just start to type its name.
	Clean The mess    - Press right mouse button
	Quit 		  - Press left mouse button at the 
			    left upper corner of the screen.

 NOTES:
	You can still scroll the list whitout moving the cheat text.
	The files CheatSheet and CheatsList must be in the same directory
 	of the main program ('CheatLister').

 This Program is not Public Domain Its a one Dollar Share Ware.

	 Come on dollar wont turn you richer or poorer, but you'll see 
 impovements of this program, and games I'm planning to put also on
 Share Ware if this one works.
