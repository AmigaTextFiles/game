1.  Introduction

	Adv. Amiga Analyzer is a combination hardware/software diagnostic
utility for the Amiga.  It helps you narrow down the problem to specific
pieces of hardware, and most importantly lets you know when things are
functioning properly.  

Specific tests it can run include:

Game Port Function and Power

Parallel Port Function and Power

Serial Port Function and Power

Disk Drive Function

Memory Function

Video Port Power

Audio Hardware Function

In addition, the Analyzer can tell you what hardware is installed in a
system without having to open up the computer.  You can find out what OS
ROM is installed, what CPU is in there, what FPU exists, which Amiga chips
are present (regular or Fat Agnus?), memory installed, and expansion
boards.  All of these tests are run from a point-and-click interface.  In
addition, the parallel and serial port testers require that the provided
hardware dongles (see IFF cct. diagrams - Cooey) are plugged into the
appropriate data port (Amiga 1000 tests will require gender changers).
Additional dongles are provided that check the power on the game and video
ports.  To run the program, make sure the power on the computer to test is
turned off.  Plug in all the hardware dongles.  Power the computer on.  If
any of the provided LEDs do not light, there is a power problem with that
port.  If they do all light, power back down, remove the game and video
port dongles, plug the monitor and mouse back in, and power back up.  Boot
with a copy of the Analyzer disk.  Each of the following sections describes
how to run the individual tests.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  General Interface

	All tests have a very simple user interface.  At the bottom left of
the screen are two rows of buttons.  Each of these represents one of the
tests.  To leave the current test and run a different one, simply click on
the appropriate button with the left mouse button.  If one of these buttons
is ghosted out, it means that the Analyzer could not allocate the hardware
required for that test from the system.  This often happens if a terminal
program was run before the Analyzer, and did not properly release the
serial port.  At the bottom right are some testing control buttons.
Clicking on the HELP button will bring up a small on-line help screen for
the current test.  There are also RUN TEST and END test buttons, used for
starting and stopping tests respectively.  All current tests will run
until the END TEST button is selected, allowing overnight testing to track
down and intermittent problem.  At the top right is an ABOUT button.  This
will give you information about us, as well as the version number of the
copy of the analyzer you are using.  At the top left is the Window Close
gadget.  Clicking on this exits the program and returns you to the
environment from which you started the Analyzer.  Any test that shows a pin
diagram of the port being tested will let you click on the pin in the
diagram to show you what hardware on the motherboard that pin is connected
to.  If a problem is found, a similar screen will also appear to let you
know what hardware to check.  It should be noted that this information
comes from the schematics for an Amiga 2000 -- other Amiga models will vary
slightly (although the actual chips should be the same (The A2000
connections and motherboard are almost identical to the A500, A500+, A1500,
B2000, and maybe the A2500 and I have verified this - Cooey).  There are
too many Amiga motherboard revisions as well as machines for all of the
individual differences to fit on one screen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.  Game Port Tester

	This will be the initial screen when the program is started.  This
will allow you to find out exactly what pins on the mouse port are giving
problems if the mouse is not functioning properly.  As a device is
manipulated in the port, the various lines on the diagram will fire.  If
any pin does not act properly, you may click on it with the left mouse
button to get a description of the pin and what hardware it is connected
to.  Game Port 0 also shows the current mouse position.  The reason for
this is that the game ports are wired differently for mice/analog joysticks
than they are for joysticks.  A port work perfectly fine for a joystick,
but not a mouse, or vice-versa.  To do a thorough game port test, you
should run it once with a mouse, then once with a joystick.  If it passes
both tests, you may be confident that the port is working OK.  It should be
noted that the mouse position indicator may be clicked on with the left
mouse button to show the hardware that needs to be checked if the mouse
position is not working properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  Parallel Port Tester

	Proper functioning of this test requires that the Parallel Port
Dongle be connected to the parallel port on the computer.  In the center of
the screen you will see a diagram of the parallel port.  As with the game
port tester, you may click on any pin in the diagram and get an information
window telling you about that pin.  To run the testm simply select the RUN
TEST button.  The parallel port will be checked out, and any pins that do
not respond properly will be reported to you, along with what hardware
needs to be checked.  The test will run until the END TEST button is
selected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  Serial Port Tester

	Proper functioning of this test requires that the Serial Port
Dongle be connected to the serial port on the computer.  In the center of
the screen you will see a diagram of the serial port.  As with the game
port tester, you may click on any pin in the diagram and get an information
window telling you about that pin.  To run the test, simply select the RUN
TEST button.  The serial port will be checked out, and any pins that do not
respond properly will be reported to you, along with what hardware needs to
be checked.  The test will run until the END TEST button is selected.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.  Memory Tester

	This test will attempt to allocate all free memory in the system,
and the write and read patterns to that memory to check that it is working
properly.  It will report 256K blocks of memory that had problems.  265K
blocks were chosen as all memory chips work in at least 256K blocks, and
this should help you track down which chip is at fault.  Note that this
test cannot currently check memory that has been already allocated by the
system;  it is for this reason that we recommend you run this test after
booting with the Analyzer disk to give you the most free memory possible.
When RUN TEST is selected, the middle window (labelled "Memory Blocks
Checked") will show all the memory that the test was able to allocate.  The
test will then write and read its patterns to and from memory, checking as
it goes.  It will first do a write test, then a read test.  A total of four
patterns are used, so eight passes are made through each block.  The
current block being checked and the address within that block are displayed
in the top window.  Any errors found are reported in the bottom window
(labelled "Error Blocks Found").  Both the Memory Blocks and Error Blocks
windows may be scrolled while the test is running.  The test will run until
END TEST is selected, allowing a good overnight test.  A Pass counter is
maintained in the upper left-hand corner to let you know how many times the
memory has been checked.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.  Disk Drive Tester

	This test is used to check all internal and external 3.5" 880K
floppy drives (now that Commodore has released the high density, 1.76M
floppy drives, we are working on supporting them).  It can perform both
READ ONLY and READ/WRITE tests on these drives -- different problems
require different approaches.  To check a drive, select which test to
perform by clicking the buttton in the upper left-hand.  This button starts
at READ ONLY, but will cycle each time it is clicked.  Next, highlight each
drive button that you wish to check.  Any drives not connected to the
system will be ghosted.  Finally, place a blank, formatted disk in each
drive you chose to test, and click RUN TEST.  The drives will be tested in
order until the END TEST button is selected.  Any errors found will be
reported in the box for the track that had the error.  The ERRS gadget may
be used to get an explanation of the error numbers.  There are two methods
for performing a drive test, and both should be run before you are
confident that the drive is OK.  The simplest is just to perform a
READ/WRITE test on the drive in question.  Let it run for a while, and if
no errors are found the drive is reading/writing data OK.  To check for
drive alignment problems, run a READ/WRITE test on a known good drive, then
take that disk to the suspect drive and run a READ ONLY test.  If errors
are found here, but not in the READ/WRITE test, the drive itself is likely
out of alignment.  Of course, make sure the disk itself is a good disk...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.  Video Port

	The only real test we can do is to check the power coming out of
the port.  To do this, disconnect the computer completely, hook up the
Video Port Dongle to the computer's RGB port, and turn the computer's power
back on.  If any of the LEDs do not light up, there is a problem with the
power.  Check the fuses, capacitors, and filters connected to that pin.  We
have also found problems related to the resistors connected to other pins.
If the display is fuzzy, that often means one of the resistors is bad
(usually blown by the connectro being removed/inserted while the power is
on).  As usual, you may select any pin in the diagram to get an explanation
of the hardware connected to that pin.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.  Configuration Screen

	This screen will show you some information about the system being
tested.  At the upper left are the ROM version, custom chip versions, and
CPU types installed in the system.  At the upper right are all the
expansion boards, and at the lower right are all the memory blocks in the
system.  This screen should help you determine what hardware is installed
in the system before openeing the cover.  Note that there are many
expansion boards that won't show up on this list.  Many video slot boards
do not have ROMs for the system to find, nor do boards that go in the PC
slots.  Also, as we do not have access to all Amiga expansion boards, some
that are found will not be identified -- hexadecimal characters will appear
in either the manufacturer or board name positions.  If you know what board
those characters apply to, please let us know so we can add it to a future
release.  The numbers to the right of the manufacturer and board name show
the ROM address and size.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.  Audio Tester

	This test is to help you determine whether or not the audio
hardware is working properly.  I personally have missed sounds from a game
and wondered whether the computer was going bad, or ifthe game has a bug --
this will let you know.  Simply hook up speakers to the computer (a mono
monitor is fine -- just make sure you know the speaker(s) and cable(s) are
good!) and click RUN TEST.  A musical scale will be played on each audio
channel in turn, with the currently playing note highlighted.  If you fail
to hear any note, then there is a problem with the audio hardware of the
computer (clicking the HELP gadget will let you know what hardware to
check).  If all of the notes play, then it is a software problem somewhere.
As with the other tests, this one will run until END TEST is selected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

11.  A Note From the Author

	I hope that this product will prove of service in tracking down
Amiga hardware problems.  If it doesn't, or if you feel it could be
improved, please let me know.  Some of the improvements in this release
were sugested by customers, and there are some others planned for future
releases (such as batch running of the tests -- selecting multiple tests to
run overnight, and report all errors later).  As we have not even run into
a slight fraction of possible computer problems, we need your help to make
this the best possible hardware suite for the Amiga.
