                                 -----------
                                 1. TUTORIAL
                                 -----------
 This  tutorial  enables  you to strap on the seat of a helicopter and begin
 without digesting the entire manual.  However, it neither provides you with
 the  necessary  insight  to  skilfully  utilise  the various weapon systems
 available, nor details the multiple helicopter operations.  It familiarises
 you  with  the basic controls and systems of the AH-64A Apache Gunship in a
 simple training flight against simulated opposing forces.
 
                               WHERE YOU START
                               ---------------
 
 After  the  title  sequence,  you'll find yourself at brigade headquarters.
 Various  "action  areas" are placed at positions around this screen.  These
 "action  areas"  are  accessed  to  select the various options available at
 brigade headquarters.
 
 To  select  an  option,  use the controller to position the cursor over the
 desired  "action  area".   When  an  "action  area" is accessed, the cursor
 changes  shape  to  a bull's-eye and the option's title is displayed at the
 bottom of the screen.  Pressing selector 1 selects that option.
 
                                 DUTY ROSTER
                                 -----------
 As  a new pilot, your first step is to get your name up on the Duty Roster.
 As  part  of  this  process,  you  also have the opportunity to select your
 squadron unit insignia and its nickname.
 
 Position the cursor over the duty roster hanging on the back wall and press
 selector 1.  The "Duty Roster" screen now appears.
 
 By  positioning  the  cursor  over  any  one  of the six pilots, a detailed
 accounting of the flight commander and flight members, if any, is displayed
 in  the  top  section.  For now, you just want to get your name on the Duty
 Roster.  (More detailed description of Duty Roster pages24-27)
 
 Position  the  cursor over the "Erase Me" pilot and press selector #2; then
 follow the instructions to enter your name and select your squadron and its
 nickname.   Leave  the  cursor  positioned  over  your  new pilot and press
 selector  #1.   This  selects  that  pilot  and  returns you to the brigade
 headquarters screen.
 
 Notice  that  your  pilot's  name and unit are now listed at the top of the
 Duty Roster.
                               TYPE OF FLIGHT
                               --------------
 Now  position the cursor over the duty officer's desk (he is sitting in the
 foreground)  and  press  selector  #1.   The  "Type  of  Flight" screen now
 appears.
 
 Since you're in training, position the cursor over the "Training" and press
 selector  # 1.  This places you in the training mode and returns you to the
 brigade headquarters screen.
 
 Notice  that the duty officer is now holding an envelope marked "Training";
 this envelope contains your orders for this mission.
 
                               THEATRE OF DUTY
                               ---------------
 Now  position  the  cursor over the World map located on the right wall and
 press selector #1.  The "Theatre of Duty" screen now appears.
 
 There  are  simulated  training  sites  available  for  either  of  the two
 theatres-  The  Persian  Gulf  and Central Europe.  Select the Persian Gulf
 (you  will  eventually  want  to fly training missions in both theatres) by
 positioning  the  cursor  in  the  box  outlining  the theatre and pressing
 selector  #1.   You  now  return to the brigade headquarters screen; notice
 that the Persian Gulf theatre is outlined on the world map.
 
                                  BRIEFING
                                  --------
 You  are  now ready to start the training flight.  Position the cursor over
 the  door  marked  "Exit"  and  press selector #1.  The Briefing screen now
 appears.
 
 It's time to familiarise yourself with the Mission Orders.  As you look out
 at the TF Commander, the top page of your Mission Orders is just visible at
 the  bottom  of  the  screen.   Position  the  cursor on the page and press
 selector #1.  You are now looking down at the top page.
 
 Since  this is a training mission, some of the data is in abbreviated form;
 however note two important areas.
 
 First, are the "Primary Mission" and "Secondary Missions:.  Review the type
 or  nature  of  the  missions.  Additionally, the position of your base and
 FARP are also indicated.
 
 Position  the  cursor anywhere on the page and press selector #1.  The next
 page appears.  This lists the support data about the position of your base,
 FARP, flight conditions and the S2's intelligence report.
 
 Please  note that the map coordinates are read military fashion, "right and
 up"  The  first number listed is on  the horizontal scale and the second on
 the  vertical scale, eg.  00/16 is in the upper left corner.  Remember that
 maps are never 100% accurate.  This is especially true when sighting mobile
 units.
 
 Position  the  cursor  anywhere  on  the  page  and press selector #1.  The
 mission  map  appears.   This  map  indicates the relative positions of the
 different  Primary Missions (P), Your base (B) and FARP (F).  Additionally,
 the map details the major terrain features and other areas of interest (for
 a detailed description of the mission map, see pages 41-42).
 
 To  review  the Mission Orders, you may sequentially leaf through the pages
 any  number  of times.  After review, position the cursor over the envelope
 and press selector #1.  The Briefing screen now appears.
 
 For  this  flight  let's go with the armourer's recommended weapon load and
 begin the mission.  Position the cursor over the map and press selector #1.
 The Cockpit Switches now appear.
 
                              COCKPIT SWITCHES
                              ----------------
 When  Gunship  2000  is first installed, all of the switches are set at the
 lowest  difficulty  levels.  Let's leave them that way for this flight.  By
 positioning  the  cursor over a switch, a brief description of its function
 appears  in  the  "Data  Display"  at  the  upper  right  (for  a  detailed
 description of the cockpit switches, see pages 34-39)
 
 Located  in  the  centre  of the screen is the "GPS Console".  Position the
 cursor  over  this  area; the Data Display describes the Console's function
 and then displays the GPS Cipher as it appeared in your Mission Orders.
 
 You're  shown  a  Squadron  insignia along with a five figure digit.  These
 insignia  and  numbers are found later on in this manual.  Find the correct
 five digit code, and enter this number via the numeric keypad on screen.
  
 If  the  correct code is entered, the GPS Console displays "Signal Locked".
 You're now ready to start the mission.
 
 If  you can't find the correct code, you can still fly the mission, but the
 on-board GPS map is disabled along with your weapons.  Basically, you're on
 a sightseeing tour, but at least the view is breathtaking.
 
 Now  position  the  cursor  over  the "Aux Power Unit" switch.  This switch
 starts the helicopter's engines, which begins the mission.  It has a safety
 cover  so that it won't inadvertently be activated.  Press selector #1, and
 the safety cover flips up.  Press selector #1 again, and the power winds up
 - your mission begins.
 
                                  CONTROLS
                                  --------
 Now you're on the ground at your base, at the controls of an AH-64A Apache.
 You  have  a pilot's eye view of the world as you look out over the cockpit
 gauges  and indicators.  The following is an abridged version of the flight
 controls; it'll get you started in your first helicopter flight (for a more
 detailed description of flight and cockpit controls, see pages 47-51)
 
 You  start the training mission by taking off from your base, and end it by
 landing back at your base.
 
                              GETTING AIRBORNE
                              ----------------
 At  this  point,  it's  a  good  idea to locate the pause (Alt p) key.  The
 frustration factor is much reduced if you pause the flight, read a section,
 perform the actions, pause again and read on further.
 
 Your  engines  are already on line (the APU provided the necessary power to
 fire  them up).  Now engage the rotor, (number 9 key).  The rotor indicator
 light turns from red to green, and the rotor starts to turn.
 
 Vertical movement is controlled by the Collective.  Press the Collective Up
 key  (=)  a  few  times until the Apache starts to lift.  When the altitude
 reaches 200feet approx., press the Collective Down key (-) to stabilise the
 lift
 
 Horizontal movement is controlled by the Cyclic.  To move forward, push the
 joystick/up  arrow,  forward.  You now start to gain speed.  By pushing the
 joystick  fully  forward,  the maximum speed for that altitude is attained.
 The  joystick  need  not  be kept in a forward position to maintain forward
 flight; it's self trimming when centred.
 
 Next  push  the  joystick/right  arrow slightly to the right.  You bank and
 turn to the right.  If you do the opposite, you bank and turn to the left.       
 
                                  MAP VIEW
                                  --------
 Press  the  Map View key (F10); the GPS map now appears.  Don't worry, your
 Apache  doesn't  crash  while  you're  viewing  the  map  -  the  action is
 suspended.
 
 The  GPS map displays the entire world in which you're flying.  Notice that
 it  matches  the  map  you reviewed in your Mission Orders.  Your Apache is
 positioned  in  the  centre  of the map, and the first Primary Objective is
 just to the North.
 
 Let's use  the Apache's INS system to navigate to the target (more detailed
 description on page 57).
 
 Press  the  F key to select the "Fly To" command.  Position the cursor over
 the  first Primary Objective, and pres selector #1 followed by the selector
 #2.  This enters the position into the INS system.
 
 You  can  check  the  map anytime during a flight to verify positions.  For
 now, press the selector #1 to return to the cockpit view.
 
 The  heading  for  the  Primary  Mission is displayed in the INS indicator.
 More  than  likely,  your  true  heading is different than the INS heading.
 Bank  the  Apache  towards  the INS heading indicator until the two heading
 numbers match.  This new heading will take you to the first Primary Mission
 for gunnery practice.
 
                              WEAPON SELECTION
                              ----------------
 Your  Weapons  Indicator (lower left) should display "Cannon"; if not press
 the  Weapon  Select  (Spacebar)  until  it  displays  "Cannon".  You've now
 selected  the Apache's M230 30mm Chaingun.  It has a maximum range of 1,500
 meters,  but its optimum range is 700 meters dead ahead and half that for a
 "deflection shot" to the side.
 
                                  TARGETING
                                  ---------
 Before  you  can fire at an opposing unit, the TADS must be locked onto the
 target.  Look at the threat display (lower right).  If you're flying,in the
 correct  direction,  there  should  be  a  red dot directly ahead.  If not,
 adjust  your  flight  path.   Check the map to verify the placement of your
 waypoint.
 
 The  TADS  should  be  locked  onto the target, a BTR-60 APC (first Primary
 Mission).   It's displayed, along with its identification, true heading and
 range  data, in the MFD (centre of cockpit).  If the TADS isn't locked onto
 the target, press the acquire/next target key (selector #2)
 
 When  locked,  a Target Diamond appears in your view along with the Reticle
 Ring.   The  Target  Box  indicates  the  exact position and heading to the
 BTR-60.   The  Reticle  Ring is the aiming point of the cannon.  To hit the
 target,  the  Reticle  Ring  must  be superimposed over the Target Diamond.
 Adjust your flight path if necessary.
 
                                RANGE OF SHOT
                                -------------
 When the target enters maximum range for the cannon, the Target Box changes
 from  a  broken box to a solid.  This indicates that the selected weapon is
 now "in constraints".
 
 Keep  the  Target  Box  centered  in  the  Reticle  Ring  and let the range
 decrease.   As  the  range  decreases  the  Reticle Ring increases in size,
 indicating  an  increase  in  weapon accuracy.  As you gain experience, you
 will  eventually be able to determine weapon accuracy just from the size of
 the Reticle Ring.
 
 When the range reaches about 700 meters, open fire by pressing selector #1.
 You  don't  have  to  aim the M230 as it automatically tracks the target as
 long  as the Reticle Ring is superimposed over the Target Box.  After a few
 rounds, the BTR-60 is knocked out; you'll see its telltale explosion in the
 distance.
 
 Well  that's  probably enough action for this flight; let's return to base.
 Select the Map View, and set the INS for a heading back to base.
 
 Fly  the  Apache  to  a position directly over the base.  When in position,
 pull  back  on  the cyclic and allow your speed to drop to zero.  Now press
 the collective down (-) to start a slow descent on to the base.  It's of no
 consequence  if  your  descent is too fast, you can't crash on this flight.
 Perfect landings only come with practice.
 
 Upon touchdown, press the Rotor Engage/Disengage (9) key (the indicator now
 turns  from  green  to  red),  and  tthe rotor blades slow to a stop.  This
 training flight is now at an end.
 
 Good luck on your future flights.

                          -------------------------
                          2  OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
                          -------------------------
 
                             PREPARE FOR FLIGHT
                             ------------------
 Gunship  2000  provides  for  a  large  number  of game options.  These are
 presented  in  various  screens  in the form of "Action Areas" or in a menu
 format.
 
 When a screen first appears, the cursor will be positioned on the screen or
 over a menu selection.  You move the cursor or change the menu selection by
 using  the  controller.   Once  positioned  over  the  desired option, it;s
 selected by pressing selector #1.
 
                              USING A JOYSTICK
 
 If  your  controller  is  a joystick, moving the stick up or down moves the
 cursor  vertically;  moving  the  stick  left  or  right  moves  the cursor
 horizontally.  Vertical and horizontal movement can be combined.
 
                             USING THE KEYBOARD
 
 If  your controller is the keyboard, then any arrow key moves the cursor to
 the  nearest  option;  the tab key moves the cursor to the next option; the
 shift  Tab key moves the cursor to the previous option:  the Home key moves
 the  cursor  to  the top of the menus:  and the End key moves the cursor to
 the  bottom  of  the  menu  listings.   The  keyboard  can  be  utilised in
 conjunction with a joystick.
 
                                ACTION AREAS
                                
 Most  options are accessed via "Action Areas".  These are placed at various
 positions  around the different screens.  However, in some cases, menus are
 utilised where lists of data options are more functional.
 
 To  select  an  option,  use the controller to position the cursor over the
 desired  action  area.  When an action area is accessed, the cursor changes
 shape  from  an arrow to a bulls-eye and the option's title displays at the
 bottom  of the screen.  Pressing selector #1 then selects that option.  Menu
 options   are  selected  in  a  similar  manner;  the  selected  option  is
 highlighted.
 
 Whenever  an  option is selected in error, pressing the Esc kay cancels the
 selection.
 
 All action begins at Brigade Headquarters, located at your home base.  From
 this  screen,  the  selections  are  made that determine the nature of your
 upcoming mission/s.
 
 There are five action areas located at various positions around the screen,
 and these are accessed to make the various mission selections.
 
 Position the cursor over the Duty Roster hanging on the back wall and press
 selector #1.
 
 The Duty Roster is utilised to post the name of an active pilot, and flight
 members,  if  any,  for  the  upcoming  mission.  The name of the posted or
 active pilot always displays at the top of the Duty Roster.
 
 What  does it all mean:  The Duty Roster is a detailed summary of a pilot's
 career  and  the  careers  of  his  flight  members, if he is also a flight
 commander.   By positioning the cursor over any one of the six pilots, that
 pilot  is  posted and a detailed accounting of the pilot and flight members
 then displays in the top section.
 
 The  pilot's  name, rank, squadron insignia, squadron nickname, decorations
 awarded  (numerals  indicate  multiple  awards),  missions flown and career
 score/s  display.   If  the pilot is a flight commander, the flight members
 are listed along with their name, rank and decorations.
 
 RANKS:  Throughout a career, a pilot, including flight members, can advance
 through  the  ranks  from  Warrant  Officer  Candidate  all  the  way up to
 Brigadier  General.   Ranks  are indicated by a military abbreviation or by
 the actual rank insignia.
 
 The  military  abbreviations  correspond to the following ranks in order of
 achievement:
 
 WOC - Warrant Officer Candidate    
 WO1 - Warrant Officer, W-1
 CW2 - Chief Warrant Officer, W-2
 CW3 - Chief Warrant Officer, W-3
 CW4 - Chief Warrant Officer, W-4
 2LT - Second Lieutenant
 1LT - First Lieutenant
 CAP - Captain
 MAJ - Major
 LTC - Lieutenant Colonel
 COL - Colonel
 BG  - Brigadier General
 
 DECORATIONS:  For exemplary service, a pilot, including flight members, are
 awarded  decorations up to and including the Congressional Medal of Honour.
 Decorations are displayed by an abbreviation and by the actual medal.
 
 The abbreviations correspond to the following decorations:
 
 NDS - The National Defence Service Medal - awarded for successfully
       completing training.
 PH  - The Purple Heart - awarded for wounds recieved in combat.
 
 The  following  decorations  are  awarded  for  heroism and valour, and are
 listed from least difficult to achieve to the highest:
 
 ACV  - The Army Commendation Medal for Valour
 AMV  - The Air Medal for Valour
 BSV  - The Bronze Star for Valour
 SS   - The Silver Star
 DSC  - The Distinguished Service Cross
 CMOH - The Congressional Medal of Honour
 
 CAREER  RECORDS:  There are three numerical values that summarise a pilot's
 career  records. They  represent,  from  left to right, last  mission, best
 mission and total career.
 
 STATUS:  Pilots,  and consequently  their flight members, are classified by
 the current flight status.  Only "Active" pilots can be posted for duty.
 
 ACTIVE: Currently on  active  duty and  good to go. You can have up to six
 "Active" pilots on the Duty Roster.
 
 RETIRED: If  you are  successful  enough  to achieve the  rank of Brigadier
 General,  your country will ask no more of you.  There's no more flying for
 you, and you'll be posted to a cushy desk job at the Pentagon.
 
 However,  if  you've  flown  99  missions  without  achieving  the  rank of
 Brigadier  General,  and  very  few  do,  you'll be retired from combat and
 posted  to  the  Army  Aviation  Centre at Ft.  Ruckner, Alabama as a pilot
 instructor
 
 MIA: If  your  helicopter  goes  down  behind enemy lines, there's a chance
 you'll  be lost or captured.  As a result, you'll be classified as "Missing
 in Action".
 
 KIA: If your helicopter suffers a  catastrophic crash  there's a chance you
 won't  walk  away from it.  As a result, you'll be classified as "Killed in
 Action".
 
                                  CAMPAIGNS
                                 
 If  your  pilot  and  flight  are  currently  engaged  in  a campaign, that
 information  is  displayed.   Campaigns  must  be resolved before any other
 mission (except training) can be flown.
 
                                  NEW PILOT
                                 
 If  you  are  creating  a new pilot, you must permanently erase an existing
 pilot  from  the  Duty Roster; so be careful who you select for an erasure.
 An "Erase Me" pilot has been provided for your first entry.
 
 Position the cursor over the "Erase Me" pilot and press selector #2; follow
 the  instructions  to enter your name and select your squadron insignia and
 its nickname.  Notice that your pilot's name and unit are now listed at the
 top of the Duty Roster.  All new pilots start out at the rank of WOC.
 
 Leave the cursor positioned over your new pilot (the corresponding data is
 displayed in the top section) and press selector #1.
 
 
                               EXISTING PILOT
 
 If  you don't want to create a new pilot and want to continue the career of
 an  "Active"  pilot,position  the cursor over that pilot and press selector
 #1.
 
 Position  the  cursor  over  the  duty officer's desk (he is sitting in the
 foreground) and press selector #1.
 
 The open folder displays the available mission options.
 
                                  TRAINING
 
 These missions are conducted at the training centre, and are constructed to
 simulate  the  Theatres of Duty.  The opposing forces are always positioned
 in the same manner so that various weapons and tactics can be tested.
 
 Training  missions simulate all  helicopter operations  with the  following
 exceptions:
 
 NO DAMAGE: You can't be hurt, as  all the opposing shots are simulated, and
 you  walk  away  from all crash landings.  However, the opposing weapons do
 behave normally, so you can still practice defensive measures.
 
 CAREER RECORD:  The Training mission does not count as a mission flown; you
 don't receive any score, promotion or decorations for heroism or valour.
 
 Training missions can be flown at any time during a pilot's career, and, in
 fact, are the only alternative mission type that can be selected if a pilot
 is  currently engaged in a Campaign.  New pilots are not required to select
 training,  but  if you do, at least you'll receive a quick promotion to WO1
 and the NDS medal.
 
                              SINGLE HELICOPTER
 
 These  missions send you out in a single helicopter against a real opposing
 force.   While  any  pilot  can  fly  these missions, pilots of any Warrant
 Officer rank are limited to Single Helicopter Missions.
 
 During Single Helicopter Missions, you're assigned a Primary, and more than
 likely a Secondary mission.  These missions can be either "Point Attack" or
 "Search and Destroy".
 
 POINT ATTACK:  You're  directed to a  specific target or  targets  with the
 objective to eliminate the targets.
 
 SEARCH AND DESTROY: The  specific location of the targets is unknown or the
 targets  are  moving.  You need to search the area described in your orders
 to find the target units with the objective to eliminate them.
 
 FLIGHT:  Once you have received your commission (ranks of Second Lieutenant
 and  above), you are then eligible to command a multiple-helicopter flight.
 The  other  pilots  in  your flight are then assigned to you from the force
 pool, and stay with you for the duration.
 
 As  with SingLe HelicOpter MissiONS, you're assigned overall missions.  The
 missions  include  the  two  above  plus "Deep Strike", "Tactical Support",
 "Search & Rescue" and :Recon".
 
 DEEP STRIKE:  You're  directed to a target or  targets  deep in the enemies
 territory,  far  from  your  home base.  We take care of getting you to the
 "Passage Point", but you must take it from there.
 
 TACTICAL SUPPORT: You're  called  upon to pick-up or deliver troops or take
 supplies  to  the  battle  area.   There  may  also  be  wounded in need of
 immediate  evacuation.   While  these "Beans and Bullets" missions may seem
 less  sexy,  they  are  none  the less important.  Besides, you may have to
 fight  your  way  in  and  out.   A  UH-60K/L  Blackhawk  must be on tap to
 successfully complete these missions.
 
 SEARCH AND RESCUE: Friendly  forces  are in need  of  extraction, but  must
 first  be  located.  Not unlike Search and Destroy missions, but don't take
 any  shots  at  these  guys.   The  UH-60K/L  Blackhawk  must  be on tap to
 successfully complete these missions.
 
 RECON: The  scouts lead the  way here, as you're ordered  to see what's out
 there.  The OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, AH-66A Comanche or AH-6G Defender must be
 on tap to successfully complete these missions.
 
                                  CAMPAIGN
 
 This  is  a theatre  wide commitment for the long haul.  You're placed in a
 position  of continuous combat where mission after mission is thrown at you
 and your flight.
 
 Who  knows how long it will last; there's no set schedule in combat.  While
 you can't win the campaign on your own, your success (or failure) does have
 an impact on its eventual outcome.
 
 If  you are a new pilot, it's best to choose training as your first flight.
 In  any  case,  position the cursor over the desired mission type and press
 selector #1.
 
                               THEATRE OF DUTY
 
 Position  the cursor over the world map located on the right wall and press
 selector #1
 
 At this time, there are two theatres of operation available.                              
                             
 PERSIAN  GULF: No pushovers here. The Iraqis are a well equipped foe.  They
 possess a high degree of commitment and won't easily waiver.  Additionally,
 flying in desert conditions presents a whole different set of factors.
 
 As  an  added  attraction,  you and your flight may be called upon to stage
 from Amphibious Assault Ships located in the nearby waters.  Your skill and
 special training aptly qualify you for this duty.                                                          
 
 CENTRAL  EUROPE: This  region  is the  greatest  challenge since you are up
 against the best the Soviet Union has to offer.  They may be down, but they
 are  not  yet out.  The region remains very unstable; the history books are
 yet to be written on what could transpire.
 
 ADDITIONAL  THEATRES:   Gunship  2000  supports  add-on  theatres and their
 related  forces  and  equipment.  A number of potential areas are currently
 under consideration.
                            
 Make  your  selection  by  positioning  the cursor in the box outlining the
 theatre and press selector #1.
 
 
                              MISSION BRIEFING
 
 
 Depending  upon  the  theatre  selected,  you  now  find yourself in simple
 surroundings  among  the lush green hills of Central Europe or on the stark
 sands  of the Persian Gulf.  As a matter of course in the Persian Gulf, you
 may also find yourself in the ready room of an Amphibious Assault Ship.
 
 There are 3 Action Areas located at various positions around the screen.
 
 The  top  page  of your Mission Orders is just visible at the bottom of the
 screen.  Position the cursor on the page and press selector #1.
 
 These  four  pages  not  only detail the upcoming mission, but also provide
 important intelligence data about the opposing forces.  It's very important
 to  read  your  orders  carefully.   Press  selector #1 to leaf through the
 pages.
 
 CALL SIGN:  It's based  on the phoenetic  military alphabet,  you're always
 "number 1".
 
 PRIMARY MISSION:  This is the Primary reason  this  mission exists, and why
 you're being sent out.  Make sure that you understand the components of the
 primary  and  its  requirements  for  completion.   Its general location is
 indicated on the mission map with a "P".
 
 SECONDARY   MISSION:    More  than  likely  a  Secondary  mission  is  also
 assigned;its presentation is the same as your Primary.  Although classified
 a  Secondary Mission, it's still important.  You can complete it first, but
 don't  forget  the  Primary.   The  Secondary Mission's general location is
 indicated on the mission map with an "S".
 
 BASE: This is where you will start and finish the mission. Its location is
 indicated on the mission map with a "B".
 
 Note  that  on  Deep Strike missions your base is somewhere off the mission
 map.   You  start  on the edge of the world at the "Passage Point"' this is
 expressed  as  two  coordinate values.  This is the only safe exit from the
 mission.
 
 FARP: If a FARP is available, its location is indicated on the mission map
 with an "F". You may land at a FARP to replenish fuel and weapons.
 
 S-2  REPORT:   The  S-2  gives  you  his  best  estimate (guess?) about the
 opposing  force's  equipment.  Pay special attention to the availability of
 opposing helicopters.
 
 CONDITIONS:   The  meteorological  section  gives you a brief report on the
 expected  weather  conditions  in  the  flight  area.  How these conditions
 affect flying is dependent upon the flight switch settings.
 
 MISSION  MAP:  This is the flight area for the current mission.  All of the
 key points of interest are indicated on the map.
 
 Please  note that the map coordinates are read military fashion, "right and
 up".  The first number listed is  on the horizontal scale and the second on
 the  vertical  scale.   For  example,  00/16  is  in the upper left corner.
 Remember  that  maps  are  never 100% accurate.  This is especially true of
 ground unit and mobile base sightings.
 
 DECLINE  MISSION:   In  the event you really don't want to fly the mission,
 you  can  opt  to pass it along to someone else and request new orders.  If
 currently  engaged  in  a  campaign,  this  page  provides the mechanism to
 suspend or abort the campaign and return to Brigade Headquarters.
 
                             OUTFIT HELICOPTERS
 
 The  squadron  armourer  routinely places the recommended helicopters, with
 ordnance,  on the flightline.  You can accept his recommendations or change
 any or all of the helicopters and ordnance.  To review, position the cursor
 over the helicopters in the background and press selector #1
 
 This provides a complete overview of the pilot assignments, helicopters and
 their respective ordnance.  From this screen, you may shift the pilots and/
 or helicopters to other positions and also assign section leaders.
 
 SWAP  PILOTS:   Position  the  cursor anywhere in the first pilot's summary
 section  and press the "p" (Swap Pilots) key; the pilot's outline starts to
 flash.  Position the cursor in the second pilot's summary section and again
 press  the "p".  There's just one restriction, you must occupy the number 1
 position.  After all you're the Flight Leader.
 
 SWAP  HELICOPTERS:   Position the cursor anywhere in the first helicopter's
 summary  section and press the "h" (Swap Helicopters) key; the helicopter's
 outline  starts  to  flash.  Position the cursor in the second helicopter's
 summary section and press the "h" .
 
 DUPLICATE   HELICOPTERS:    Position  the  cursor  anywhere  in  the  first
 helicopter's  summary section and press the "d" (duplicate helicopter) key;
 the  helicopter's  outline  starts  to  flash.   Position the cursor in the
 second helicopter's summary section and again press the "d".
 
 SECTION  LEADERS:   Your  flight  may  be organised or "sectioned" into one
 section  of five or into two smaller sections.  The section of three is the
 "Heavy Section", the other section is the "Light Section:.  Sections fly as
 a single group, which greatly facilitates flight commands.
 
 You're  always the section leader, the pilot's occupying sections 3 & 4 may
 alternately  be assigned as a section leader.  Position the cursor anywhere
 in  the  pilots  summary  section and press the "1" (Assign Section Leader)
 key.
 
 The  Heavy  Section is identified by a blue band and the Light Section by a
 grey band.
 
 Return  to  the  Mission  Briefing  screen when satisfied with the mix, but
 first, read on.
 
                                   ARMING
 
 If  you  want  to  change  a  helicopter's  ordnance,  or change the actual
 helicopter,  position  the  cursor  anywhere  in  the  helicopter's summary
 section  and  press  selector  #1.   The Arming Screen displays the current
 helicopter along with its ordnance.
 
 WEAPONS:   A  brief description of each weapon displays at the upper right;
 for a more complete description see pages 67 - 68.
 
 To  select  a  weapon,  highlight it and press selector #1; then select the
 appropriate option among those available.  Existing weapons can be directly
 replaced; the existing weapon doesn't need to be removed first.
 
 Most  helicopter weapons are balance loaded; whenever you add or subtract a
 weapon  to one position, its twin automatically loads on the opposite wing.
 The  Defender  and  Kiowa  Warrior  are  exceptions; their pylons can carry
 different weapons.
 
 FUEL:   Highlight  "Fuel"  and press selector #1.  Expressed as a factor of
 100%  fuel  is increased or decreased as desired.  While it's real tempting
 to   trade  fuel  for  weapons,  don't  leave  yourself  short;  it's  very
 embarrassing if you have to walk back.
 
 AMMO:   This  only  applies to helicopters with integral cannons or machine
 guns.   Highlight  "Ammo"  and  press  selector  #1.  Ammo is loaded to the
 maximum, or any lesser amount.
 
 PAGE 34
 
 CHAFF  & FLARES:  Highlight "Chaff/Flares" and press selector #1.  A mix of
 60 Chaff and Flares are carried.
 
 LOAD:  All helicopters are rated for a maximum load capacity; this value is
 expressed  as  a factor of 100%.  Theatre and weather conditions affect the
 maximum  load  capacity  of  a helicopter.  It decreases as temperature and
 humidity  increase,  and  is  further  reduced by low atmospheric pressure.
 Load capacity is also reduced at higher altitudes as air becomes thinner as
 altitude increases.
 
 The  load  capacity is automatically calculated for each helicopter, but of
 course, varies by theatre and mission conditions.  As you change weapons or
 increase/decrease  Fuel or Ammo (the chaff & flare mix doesn`t impact load)
 the  load  capacity  changes.  You can load ordnance in excess of 100%, but
 the load must be 100% or less before you exit the arming sequence.
 
 A  load  of  less  than  100% is desirable since more reserve power is then
 available.
 
 CHANGE  HELICOPTER:   Highlight  "Change Helicopter" and press Selector #1.
 Select the new helicopter by highlighting it and pressing Selector #1.  New
 helicopters always arrive on the flightline "clean" (without ordnance).
 
 Return  to the Outfit Summary screen when satisfied with the mix; highlight
 "Ordnance Complete" and press Selector #1.
 
 
 You're  ready  to  start the mission.  Position the cursor over the map and
 press Selector #1
 
 Note  that  during campaigns, this map is used to advise you of the current
 state  of  a campaign.  The degree of victory or defeat is indicated by how
 far the blue side (friendly) or the red side (opposing) has advanced beyond
 the original front line.     
 
 Your  preflight,  or  set.   the  Cockpit Switches to determine the overall
 "reality"  or  difficulty  of  the upcoming mission.  Many different switch
 combinations allow you to tailor the settings to your own particular needs.
 You  must  also  enter  the  GPS  Authenticator  Code  to activate on-board
 systems..
 
 PAGE 35
 
 There  are  nine  "action  areas"  located  at various positions around the
 screen.   The  "Data  Display"  in  the upper right corner displays a brief
 description  of  each  switch  whenever an action area is accessed.  Change
 switch  settings  by  positioning  the  cursor over the switch and pressing
 Selector #1.
 
                                CP/G CONTROLS
             
 This  assigns duties to your invisible CP/G, and enables you to concentrate
 on other activities.
 
 WEAPONS/C.M.:    The  CP/G  automatically  fires  all  weapons.   The  CP/G
 additionally activates the appropriate counter-measures systems as needed.
 
 C.M,:  The GP/G controls just the C.M.  systems.
 
 NONE:  You control all weapon/C.M.  systems.
 
 While  the  CP/G  does an adequate job, you will eventually want to control
 all systems yourself.
 
                                ENEMY QUALITY
 
 This  determines  the competency level and training of the opposing forces.
 It has a direct correlation with how quickly an opposing unit can achieve a
 lock  on  your helicopter, and the relative accuracy of its weapons.  Units
 of lower quality are also more reluctant to pursue an objective in the face
 of stiff resistance.
 
 POOR:   These  guys  are best described as rabble.  an civilian force could
 probably  do  just  as well.  Not much to worry abaout here, you can mop up
 these troops with no trouble.  A good first opponent for new pilots.
 
 AVERAGE:    These   are   your  basic  every  day  troops.   Certainly  not
 exemplary,but at least they're not the bottom of the barrel.
 
 CRACK:   Now  we're  starting  to  talk  competence.  These guys know their
 business  and are a real challenge.  They are aggressive and clever.  Don't
 assume anything.
 
 PAGE 36
 
 ELITE:   The  best-of-the-best.   Not  much  more  need be said about these
 troops.   They  go to any lengths to accomplish their objectives or to stop
 you  from  accomplishing  yours.   You  need  to be exceptionally quick and
 skilful to get the upperhand.
 
 This switch sets the flight mode parameters of your helicopter.
 
 EASY:   The  pitch,  roll,  altitude and airspeed of the helicopter have no
 effect  on  lift.   No matter how you maneuvre the cyclic (joystick), lift,
 and  therefore,  your  altitude  is unaffected.  The collective is the only
 control that affects lift/altitude.
 
 REALISTIC:  Here the pitch, roll, altitude and airspeed affect lift as in a
 real helicopter.
 
 This switch sets the difficulty level or "forgiveness" associated with your
 landing attempts.
 
 NO CRASHES:  All landings are perfect.
 
 REALISTIC:   Landings  need  to  be within the design specifications of the
 helicopter if not, damage or destruction could result.  Easy does it.
 
 This switch turns the on-board collision avoidance system on or off.
 
 ON:   The  helicopter automatically avoids all intervening terrain features
 thereby preventing instant destruction on hillsides.  The system avoids the
 objects by gaining altitude, so don't deliberately fly at tall mountains;it
 can't protect you from bullets.
 
 OFF:   You're  on your own, so keep alert.  The radar altimeter is probably
 your best friend.
 
 This switch activates or deactivates wind effects.
 
 NO WIND:  The flight conditions are calm and serene.
 
 REALISTIC:  The wind is blowing across the battle field at the velocity and
 bearing  indicated  in  the  Mission  Orders.  Your helicopter displaces an
 equal amount to the wind.
 
 PAGE 37
                                 VISIBILITY
 
 This  switch  determines  the probability of naturally occurring (fog, rain,
 etc)  or  man-made  conditions (smoke) obscuring visibility or limiting the
 effectiveness of visiononics equipment.
 
 CLEAR:  Visibility is unlimited.
 
 REALISTIC:  Visibility can be limited by battlefield obscurants.
 
                                 DIFFICULTY
 
 The combination of theatre, mission type and switch settings determines the
 overall   difficulty  level  of  the  upcoming  mission.   The  higher  the
 difficulty  level,  the  greater the challenge, but the potential reward is
 heightened.
 
 The "Difficulty" indicator provides a visual gauge of the difficulty level.
 When  fully  illuminated,  the  mission  is  of  extreme  difficulty.   The
 indicator  is  unilluminated,  regardless  of  the  settings,  for Training
 Missons, as no score is awarded.
 
                                 GPS SYSTEM
 
 Located  in  the  centre  of  the screen is the "GPS Consol".  Position the
 cursor  over  this  area.   After  the Data Display describes the Console's
 function  it  then  displays  the GPS Cipher as it appeared in your Mission
 Orders.
 
 You  were  shown a Squadron Insignia along with a five digit number.  These
 insignia  and numbers are found between pages 21 & 60 of this manual.  Find
 the  corresponding  five  digit Authenticator Code and enter this number by
 pressing the apporopriate numeric keys.
 
 If  the  correct  code  is  entered,  the  GPS Console will display "Signal
 Locked".  You're ready to start the mission.
 
 If  you can't find the correct code, you can still fly the mission, but the
 on-board GPS Maps are disabled along with your weapons.
 
 Now  position  the cursor over the "Aux Power Unit" switch.  This switch is
 used  to  start  the  helicopter's engines and begin the mission.  It has a
 safety cover so that it won't be indadvertently activated:  it requires two
 keystrokes  to activate.  Press Selector #1, and the safety cover flips up.
 Press Selector #1 again, and the power starts to wind up.

                        SIMULATION CONTROLS AND VIEWS
                        -----------------------------
 
                                 CONTROLS 
 
 A  number  of  commands are available to control "overhead" or various game
 functions.   While  these commands can be utilised at any time, some relate
 to specific functions, and have no effect.
 
 Press  the  Pause  (alt  and p) key to immediately freeze the action.  Some
 computers  have specific "pause" or "hold" keys.  Depending on the internal
 design of your computer, these keys may also work.  Pause is only effective
 during flight.
 
 Gunship  2000  supports  either  a  joystick  or  the keyboard for all game
 functions.  If you're using a joystick, the keyboard also remains active.
 
 If  your joystick seems to be "drifting", press the Joystick Adjust (alt j)
 key, with the joystick centred to re-calibrate.
 
 If you have a slower computer, you may use the Detail Adjust (alt d) key to
 access  the  selection  menu.   The  simpler  detail  levels  increase  the
 processing  speed.   The  action  is  temporarily suspended when making the
 selections.
 
 Press the Quit (alt q) key to immediately end the simulation and return the
 system  to  DOS.   No information, including current scores or settings, is
 saved  to  disk.   Scores  and  settings  are  automatically  saved  at the
 completion of each mission, so only the current data is affected.
 
 Press the End Mission (alt e) key to end the current mission.  The computer
 projects  the  current  situation into the immediate future, and determines
 the  results.   Therefore,  you can't use this key to escape from impending
 disaster, and the results do count as a mission flown.
 
 The  Volume  Adjust  (alt v) key accesses the sound effects selection menu.
 The action is temporarily suspended when making the selections.
 
 Your  invisible  co-pilot  communicates  system  status  and  threat/target
 information  to  you  via  digitised  sound.  While these prompts are quite
 helpful  there's  a price to pay in computer processing speed.  If you find
 your  system  slowing too dramatically, pressing the Co-Pilot Sound (alt c)
 key turns these sounds off.
 
 PAGE 39
 
                                LAST MESSAGE
 
 The  other  section leader or pilots communicate with you during the course
 of a mission.  These messages stay visible for only a short period of time.
 If for some reason you are unable to review an entire message (you could be
 busy with some bad guys of your own), pressing the Last Message (alt m) key
 re-display the text.
 
                                COCKPIT STYLE
 
 In  addition  to  the  processing speed gained by adjusting the detail, the
 style  of  the  cockpit can be adjusted to increase performance.  Press the
 Cockpit  Style  (alt  s)  key  to access the selection menu.  The action is
 temporarily suspended when making the selection.
 
 
                               ACCELERATE TIME
 
 Press  the  Accelerate  Time  (])  key  to  increase the rate at which time
 passes,  therefore increasing the speed of your flight.  This is a variable
 setting of 16 levels.  Each successive press of the key increases the speed
 one level.  This function is best used in combination with auto-pilot mode.
 
                                 NORMAL TIME
 
 Press  the  Normal  Time ([) to immediately return to normal time; it can't
 reduce  the rate to less than normal time.  Flight automatically returns to
 normal  time  whenever  a  target  is  sighted  or  upon reaching the final
 waypoint.

                              SIMULATION VIEWS
                              ----------------
 
 Gunship 2000 offers a number of different points of view while flying.  You
 can  jump from inside the cockpit to a point of view outside or even ride a
 Hellfire into its target.
 
                           FROM-THE-COCKPIT VIEWS
 
 These views are from inside the cockpit looking out.  These are your "true"
 views.
 
 COCKPIT  F1:  This is your normal from the cockpit view.  From this you see
 the  gauges  and  controls of your cockpit panel.  When engaging in combat,
 this  is  the  most  advatageous  point of view, as you have the aid of the
 weapon targeting systems.
 
 MAST  F2:   The  OH-58D  Kiowa  Warrior, MD53OG Defender and AH-64B Longbow
 Apache  are  equipped  with mast mounted sights.  They're used to peer over
 the  tops  of obstacles while keeping the body of the helicopter hidden and
 safe from opposing eyes and more importantly, opposing weapons.
 
 They're  best  employed  from  hover  mode  (the auto-hover mode holds your
 position), as you really can't mask behind terrain in forward flight.  When
 activated,  the  controller is utilized to rotate the sight, left or right,
 through 360 degrees, not to control helicopter flight.
 
 PAGE 40
 
 LEFT F3:  View from outside the left cockpit window.
 
 RIGHT F4:  View from outside the right cockpit window.
 
 
 
                          OUT OF THE COCKPIT VIEWS
 
 As  an  aid to flight maneuvres and combat, a variety of external views are
 available.   In  all  of  them, you're "out-of-the-cockpit" looking at your
 helicopters and/or the targets.
 
 CHASE F5:  You're positioned just behind your helicopter, looking past it
 at whatever lies ahead.  You maintain this perspective no matter how the
 helicopter is maneuvred.
 
 FLIGHT  CHASE  VIEW  (SHIFT F5):  You're positioned just behind one of your
 pilot's  helicopters  looking past it at whatever lies ahead.  You maintain
 this  perspective no matter how the helicopter is maneuvred.  Press the key
 again to shift your view to the next helicopter.
 
 TACTICAL  VIEW  F6:  You're positioned just behind your helicopter, looking
 past  it  at  the target.  This view automatically rotates and pans to keep
 both the helicopter and target in view.
 
 This  view  is helpful when engaging air targets, and is also useful if you
 want  to  return  for  a  second  or  third  pass at a ground target.  It's
 probably  wise  to  return to the cockpit before firing, so as not to waste
 ammunition.
 
 REMOTE  VIEW  (F7):   You're positioned just off from your helicopter; your
 helicopter  continues its flight.  This view automatically rotates and pans
 to  keep  your  helicopter  in  view.   It's  not  unlike  the  view  of  a
 radio-controlled flight.
 
 Additionally,  by  pressing  and  holding  Selector  #2  and  adjusting the
 controller,  you  can  shift  your  point  of  view.   Holding  Selector #2
 maintains that point of view.
 
 REVERSE   TACTICAL   VIEW   (F8):    You're  positioned  just  behind  your
 helicopter's  target,  looking  past it at your own helicopter.  The target
 can either be an air or ground unit - whatever you're locked on.  In either
 case,  the  target  is  in  the  foreground  and  your helicopter is in the
 distance.   In  fact,  it  may  only  be  a  dot  in  the  sky.   This view
 automatically  rotates and pans to keep both the target and your helicopter
 in view.
 
 Experienced  pilots  find this a very dramatic view when making attack runs
 at  ground  targets.   It's a great view to show off, but keep in mind that
 your helicopter is still flying, don't crash into a hill while admiring the
 view.
 
 PAGE 41
 
 MISSILE  VIEW  F9:   You're  positioned  directly  behind  the  weapon just
 launched.   This  view  is  very  entertaining,  as  you  follow the weapon
 directly  into the target.  If you're having trouble understanding why your
 weapons are missing, switching to this view can be very helpful.
 
                                  MAP VIEW
 
 When  the  Map View (F10) is pressed, the GPS map appears.  Your helicopter
 won't crash while you're viewing the map, since the action is suspended.
 
 The  GPS  map  displays  the entire world in which you're flying in low and
 high  scales.   The  high  scale  map is the default display.  Note that it
 matches the map provided in your Mission Orders.
 
 This  map displays the positions of all friendly units and the positions of
 sighted opposing units.  Current sightings display in bright red, while old
 sightings  display  in  dark red.  Remember that the opposing forces may be
 moving,  so  don't  rely  on  old  sightings,  Icons  are  used to mark the
 sightings.
 
 PAGE 42
 
 The  different terrain features are depicted on the high scale maps.  These
 come  in  many  shapes and sizes, and vary from world-to-world.  Terrain is
 the  number one defensive measure.  Get familiar with the different terrain
 types and use them to your advantage.
 
 Press  the  Spacebar  to  switch to the low scale mode.  The low scale maps
 depict  specific  terrain  features.  Where the large scale map indicates a
 mountain  group,  the  small  scale map depicts the actual mountains of the
 group.   The  displayed  area  is  scrolled by moving the Controller in any
 direction.   A reduced version of the large scale map displays in the upper
 right  corner;  the  yellow  indicator "boxes" the display area.  Press the
 spacebar  to  return  to  the  high  scale map, or the esc key to return to
 flight mode.

                               FLIGHT CONTROLS
 
 A  number of controLs and flying aids are available tO you as a pilot.  The
 followiNg  deScribes and defines how each works but do not use this section
 as a guide to flying see "How to Fly", pages 53-59.
 
                                CYCLIC STICK
 
 Pushing the Joystick (up arrow) forward pitches the helicopter's nose down.
 Pulling  the  Joystick  (down arrow) back pitches the helicopter's nose up.
 Pushing  the  Joystick  left  (left arrow) or right (right arrow) rolls the
 helicopter in that direction.
 
 A  downward pitch moves the helicopter forward; a large down pitch causes a
 faster dive in Realistic Flight mode.  an upward pitch moves the helicopter
 backwards.
 
 Rolling  the  helicopter  left  or  right at extremely low speeds (under 10
 knots)  causes the helicopter to rotate left or right.  At low speed (under
 40 knots), it causes a skid or "sideslip" left or right.  At medium or high
 speed, it causes a banking turn left or right.
 
 The  Artifical  Horizon  Gauge  shows  the  current  pitch  and roll of the
 helicopter.
 
                                 COLLECTIVE
 
 Lift  keeps  the  helicopter  airborne.   In  level  flight, increasing the
 collective causes the helicopter to ascend, while decreasing the collective
 causes  the  helicopter to descend.  The current level of the collective is
 measured  as "torque".  When raising or lowering the collective, the engine
 torque/throttle is automatically adjusted.
 
 To  raise  or  lower  the  collective,  press  the Collective Up (=) or the
 Collective  down  (-)  keys respectively.  To raise or lower the collective
 fast, press the shift Collective (= or -) keys.
 
 The Torque Gauge indicates the current level of torque.
 
                                    GEAR
 
 Press  the  Gear (3) key (AH-66A Comanche only) to toggle your landing gear
 up  or  down.   Flying  with  the  gear  down not only reduces airspeed, it
 increases the radar cross-section.
 
 The Gear Indicator Light is illuminated when it is down.
 
 PAGE 44
 
 Press  the  Autopilot  (5)  key to engage or disengage the autopilot.  When
 engaged it flies you to the "active" INS waypoint; if no waypoints are set,
 the  autopilot  doesn't  engage.  When engaged, the autopilot locks in your
 current altitude and speed.  However, if your altitude is less than the Low
 Limit,  the  Auto-pilot  climbs  the  helicopter  to that altitude.  If the
 cyclic  stick  is  moved  in  any  direction,  the  autopilot automatically
 disengages.
 
 The autopilot Indicator Light illuminates when it's engaged.
 
 WARNING:   the autopilot doesn't avoid hills or obstacles (unless Collision
 Avoidance is engaged); it flies a straight line from waypoint to waypoint.
 
 
                                NEXT WAYPOINT
 
 Press the Next Waypoint (6) key to immediately switch to the next waypoint.
 This can be selected while the autopilot is engaged.
 
                              PREVIOUS WAYPOINT
 
 Press  the  Previous Waypoint (7) key to immediately switch to the previous
 waypoint.  This can be selected while the auotpilot is engaged.
 
                               BAY OPEN/CLOSE
 
 Press  the  Bay  Open/Close (8) key (AH-66A Comanche only) to open or close
 the  weapons  bay.   The  Comanche's  internal weapons, except for the 20mm
 cannon,  can  only  fire  when  the  bay  is  open.  However, when open, it
 increases the radar cross-section.
 
 The Bay Indicator Light is illuminated when it is open.
 
                           ROTOR ENGAGE/DISENGAGE
 
 Press  the  Rotor  Engage/Disengage  (9) key to engage the rotor (cause the
 engines to turn the rotor), or disengage the rotor (cause the rotor to spin
 freely,   unconnected   from  the  engines).   When  it's  disengaged,  the
 collective is automatically "bottomed" (set to zero).
 
 The  Rotor  Status  Light  indicates  if  the  rotor  is engaged (green) or
 disengaged  (red).   The light flashes red if you attempt to add collective
 with the rotor disengaged.
 
 When flying at speed from +10 to -10 knots, pressing the Auto-Hover (0) key
 automatically   places   the  helicopter  in  hover  mode;  your  speed  is
 automatically  reduced  to  zero.   The  collective  controls  can  be used
 normally,  but  auot-hover doesn't allow the altitude to drop below the Low
 Limit.   Therefore,  you can't land with auto-hover engaged.  If the cyclic
 stick  is  moved  forward  or  back  (you  may still rotate left or right),
 auto-hover automatically disengages.
 
 PAGE 45
 
 The  auto-hover  Indicator  Light  illuminates when it's engaged it flashes
 when engaged at too high a speed.
 
 Auto-hover is very useful to maintain a position during windy conditions or
 to  unmask and quickly mask from cover.  You can drop altitude like a rock,
 since auto-hover holds you at the Low Limit Altitude.
 
                               ONE OR LEFT MFD
 
 Press  the One or Left MFD (z) key to change the information displayed in a
 single  or  the  left  hand  MFD.   Helicopters with a single MFD have five
 possible   displays   navigation  (heading  &  waypoint  data),  low  scale
 map,mission  orders,  weapons  status,  target  camera.   The target camera
 automatically  displays,  overriding  any other display, whenever a lock-on
 occurs..
 
 Helicopters with two MFD add a sixth option -threat display.
 
                                  RIGHT MFD
 
 Press the Right MFD (x) key to change the information displayed inthe right
 hand  MFD.  Helicopters so equipped have six possible displays:  navigation
 (heading and waypoint data), low scale map, mission orders, weapons status,
 target camera or threat display.  The threat display automatically displays
 overriding any other display, whenever a target is detected.
 
                                  LOW LIMIT
 
 Press  the  Low  Limit  -  (c) key to decrease the low altitude limit by 50
 feet;  it  can not be reduced below 50 feet.  Both the barometric and radar
 altimeters  utilize  the  low  limit  setting as the basis for low altitude
 warnings.   Audio and visual indicators are activated whenever the altitude
 falls below the low limit.
 
 In  addition  to its function as a flying aid, the low limit is used to set
 the flying altitude of independent helicopters and/or sections.
 
                                 LOW LIMIT +
 
 Press  the  Low  Limit  +  (v) key to increase the low altitude limit by 50
 feet, it can not be raised above 250 feet.

                               WEAPON CONTROLS
                               ---------------
 
 A  number  of  weapon  controls are available.  The following describes and
 defines  how each works.  do not use this section as a guide to combat, see
 "How to Fight" pages 60-73.
 
                           ROCKET SALVO X1, X2, X4
   
 Press the Rocket Salvo x1, x2 or x4 (1,2,4) keys to set the number of Hydra
 70  unguided  rockets  that  will  be  fired  from  each  wing pod whenever
 "rockets"  are  selected  and  Selector  #1  is pressed.  Rockets are fired
 symmetrically  from  both  wing  pods,  except  for  the  Kiowa Warrior and
 Defender.  The Salvo mode is shown in the Weapons Display.
 
 PAGE 46
 
                             ACQUIRE NEXT TARGET
 
 Press  the  Acquire Next Target (backspace) key to lock onto a target or to
 switch  the  current lock-on.  Normally, the targeting system automatically
 locks  onto  the nearest target, this enables you to switch to an alternate
 target.
 
                             RADAR JAMMER ON/OFF
     
 Press  the Radar Jammer ON/Off (n) key to toggle the radar on, if currently
 off,  or  off,  if  currently  on.  When the radar jammer is active, a green
 light illuminates next to the "R" warning indicator.
 
                                 DROP CHAFF
 
 Press the Drop Chaff (m) key to release a chaff decoy.
 
                              IR JAMMER ON/OFF
 
 Press  the IR Jammer on/off (.) ;key to toggle the IR on, if currently off,
 or  off,  if  currently  on.   When  the IR jammer is active, a green light
 illuminates next to the "l" warning indicator.
 
                                 DROP FLARE
 
 Press Drop Flare (/) key to release a flare decoy.
 
                               ACTIVE WEAPONS
 
 Press  Selector  #2  to  change the active weapon; the active weapon, along
 with the available quantity, is shown in the Weapons Indicator.
 
 Press   Selector   #1;  to  fire  the  active  weapon.   Most  weapons  are
 fired/launched  singly;  each  time  Selector  #1  is pressed, one round is
 fired.   However,  rockets are fired in salvos and cannons and machine guns
 fire in multiple-round bursts.

                      HELICOPTER GAUGES AND INDICATORS
                      --------------------------------
 
                               AH-64A/B APACHE
 
 This  gauge  along  with  its  digital readout, shows your horizontal speed
 through the air in knots.  A speed of 100 kts equals about 114 mph, or about
 161 kph.
 
                               AIRSPEED GAUGE
 
 This gauge along with its digital readout, is your barometric altimeter, it
 shows  your true altitude in feet.  It's adjusted for you to compensate for
 ground elevation variances so that "O" altitude is always at ground level.
 
                             ARTIFICIAL HORIZON
 
 This  ball  gauge  shows your pitch(nose up or down) and your roll (left or
 right).
 
                                  AUTOPILOT
 
 The "P" illuminates whenever the autopilot is engaged.
 
                                 AUTO-HOVER
 
 The "H" illuminates whenever Auto-hover is engaged.
 
                                   COMPASS
 
 The  analog compass, along with its digital readout, indicates your current
 heading.   Note  that  the compass shows the heading your helicopter faces.
 During skids or backwards flight, your actual course is different.
 
                          CHAFF AND FLARE INDICATOR
 
 This  indicator  shows the number of defensive stores remaining.  Its shown
 as  chaff "CF" and flares "FL".  Each defensive unit is released as a group
 of three cartridges.
 
                                ENGINE GAUGE
 
 The  left  and  right  strips in the gauge marked "E" show the RPM's of the
 port (left) and starboard (right) engines.
 
                                 FUEL GAUGE
 
 The gauge marked "F" shows the amount of fuel remaining in all tanks.
 
                                     HUD
 
 The HUD (head-up display) projects bright numbers and symbols ahead of your
 view so that you can simultaneously read the display and look ahead.
 
 The left scale indicates your airspeed along with a symbolic representation
 of the artificial horizon.
 
 The  right  side scale combines the radar altimeter with the vertical speed
 indicator  (see below).  The radar altimeter is probably the most important
 indicator you have, so pay close attention to it.  It indicates your actual
 height  over ground.  There's an important distinction between this and the
 standard  altimeter.   As you fly over obstacles your true altitude remains
 constant,  but  the height over ground changes.  This can be the difference
 between  crashing or surviving.  The red band at the lower end of the scale
 is low limit.
 
 PAGE 48
 
 The top scale is your heading along with the INS and target lock-on pips.
 
 The  INS  (Inertial  Navigation  System) indicator indicates your course to
 your current waypoint.  The top fixed pip is your heading, while the bottom
 pip  is  the waypoint.  If it's right of centre, turn to the right; if it's
 left  of  centre,  turn to the left.  The waypoint course is also indicated
 digitally.
 
 The  MFD has five possible displays navigation (heading and waypoint data),
 low scale map, mission orders, weapons status or target camera.
 
 The  light  is green when the main rotor is engaged.  The light is red when
 the  main  rotor  is  disengaged,  ie  spinning  freely, unconnected to the
 engines.
                                   LIGHTS
 
 These  lights show the status of major systems on board your helicopter.  a
 green  light  means  the system is functioning normally; a yellow means the
 system  is  damaged  and  malfunctioning;  a  red light means the system is
 knocked-out and off-line.
 
 The abbreviations represent:-
 
 AVN:   Avionics(gauges, defensive measures)
 CAN:   integral cannon
 FUL:   fuel tanks
 OPT:   optics(targeting systems)
 PTE:   port engine
 PTW:   port weapons wing
 RTR:   main rotor
 SBE:   starboard engine
 SBW:   starboard weapons wing
 TAL:   tail rotor(flight stability)
 
 This  screen  shows  nearby  targets  that  can  potentially  threaten your
 helicopter.   Red  dots  are  opposing units, grey dots are non-threatening
 units  or  structures,  blue  dots  are enemy aircraft, and yellow dots are
 missiles  in  flight.   This  includes  both  opposing  missiles  AND  your
 missiles.  The white flashing dot is your present target.
 
 The  threat  display  automatically  scales from short to long range (short
 range will override long range).
 
 PAGE 50
 
 The  strip  shows  the  amount of torque in the turbine engine(s).  This is
 proportional  to  the  amount  of  collective  control and rotor lift.  The
 higher you set the collective, the higher the torque.
 
 The VSI (vertical speed indicator) shows the rate you are changing altitude
 (ascending or descending).  If the needle is horizontal, you're maintaining
 a  constant  altitude.   If  the  needle  dips downwards, you're descending
 towards the ground; if it points upward, you're ascending.  The greater the
 needle varies from horizontal, the greater the altitude change.
 
 
 The  "R"  warning  light  flashes red whenever a search radar "sweeps" over
 your  helicopter.  When tracking (firing) radar for either guns or missiles
 locks onto your helicopter, the light turns solid red.  If you turn on your
 radar  jammer,  the  neighbouring  light  turns  green  while the jammer is
 running.   If  the jamming is successful, the solid red warning light turns
 off.
 
 Note:   your jammer can't suppress radar searches, so flashing red warnings
 may continue even if your jammer is active.  If you leave the jammer active
 they'll eventually 'read' your frequency and overcome the jamming.
 
 The  "I"  warning  light  turns  solid red whenever an infrared (IR) homing
 weapon  is approaching your helicopter.  If you turn on your IR jammer, the
 neighbouring light turns green while the jammer is running.  If the jamming
 is successful, the solid red warning light turns off.
 
 While  the radar jammer can remain on, the IR jammer eventually "times out"
 due to heat.  It must cool down to again become effective.
 
 Note:   there  aren't  any active IR search devices.  IR search is passive,
 therefore there's no flashing red "IR" warning.
 
 The  "L"  warning  light  turns solid red whenever your helicopter is being
 illuminated  by  a laser ranging or targeting device.  At the present time,
 laser jammers are still on the drawing boards.  So, find the source and get
 it before it gets you or get out ofit quick.
 
 
 The  weapons  indicator  shows  the  active  weapon,  its  position  on the
 helicopter,  and  quantity  of  rounds  remaining.   For  rockets,  it also
 indicates the current salvo setting.
 
 PAGE 51
 
                               AH-66A COMANCHE
 
 The Comanche cockpit is dominated by electronic systems, and aptly fits the
 trend  towards  total  digital  display.  The first thing you notice is the
 lack of analog indicators (except for the compass).
 
                           AIRSPEED AND ALTIMETER
 
 The Airspeed (ASI) and altimeter (ALT) data are both digitally represented.
 Next  to  the altimeter is the VSI icon; it indicates ascending, descending
 and neutral altitude change modes.
 
                                    GEAR
 
 The  status  retractable landing gear is indicated by the gear ("G") light;
 its  illuminated  when  it's  down.   You can fly with the gear in the down
 position,  but  speed  is reduced and the radar cross-section is increased.
 Landings are impossible with the gear in the up position.
 
                                     BAY
 
 The  status  of the  weapons  bay is indicated by the bay ("B") light; it's
 illuminated  when  the  bay is open.  Internal weapons, except for the 20mm
 cannon,  can't  fire  when  the  bay  is  closed.   However,  when open, it
 increases the radar cross-section.
 
                               OTHER DISPLAYS
 
 The  remaining indicators, displays and HUD function in a similar manner to
 the Apaches.
 
                          THE REMAINING HELICOPTERS
 
 Although  their  cockpit  layouts  differ  from  the  Apaches,  the gauges,
 indicators  and  HUD  in  the  other  helicopters function exactly like the
 Apaches.  Just familliarise yourself with the unique layouts; the "look" of
 the gauges and indicators has been standardised for ease of use.
 
 PAGE 53
                                 HOW TO FLY
 
 Helicopters are very complex flying machines.  One wonders how a machine so
 angular and ungraceful could ever get off the ground.  In flight, they look
 like a mass of whirling blades.  Yet, helicopters do fly - and fly well for
 that  matter;  but,  the  controls  are quite different from a conventional
 aeroplane.
 
 It's  often  said that the real pilots fly helicopters; the other guys just
 dabble at flying.
 
 Remember  one thing - DON'T OVERCONTROL!  Helicopter controls are sluggish;
 they react slowly.  Even the most responsive helicopter (like the Comanche)
 takes a couple of seconds to respond to your control movements.
 
 Be  gentle  with  the controls.  After each control movement, watch for the
 result  before  you  do  anything  else.   Numerous  fast,  radical control
 movements produce unexplainable results and possibly a crash!
 
 The most common error in helicopter flight is to over control by pulling or
 pushing hard on the cyclic or pressing too long on a key.
 
 The  emphasis  is  on  realistic flight, since that's the most complex.  If
 possible,  learn  to  fly in the realistic mode from the beginning; you can
 always fall back on the easy mode if the frustration factor gets too high.
                             
                              GETTING AIRBORNE

                              ENGAGE THE ROTOR
 
 Your  power  is  already  on  line; the APU provided the power to start the
 engines.   Press  the  Rotor  Engage/Disengage  (9) key to engage the rotor
 stystem.   The  rotor  status  light turns green when the rotor is engaged.
 The rotors now come up to speed (the sound level increases).
 
 PAGE 54
 
                                 COLLECTIVE
 
 Press  the  collective Up Fast (shift =) key until the helicopter starts to
 ascend.   The  torque gauge rises as you "raise" the collective.  Press the
 Collective  Down  (-) key if the ascent is too fast.  the VSI indicates the
 rate  of  your  ascent  (the  indicator  is  above  horizontal).   Let  the
 helicopter ascend to about 100 feet.
 
 Press  the  Auto-hover (O) key anytime your speed is from +10 to -10 knots.
 It's  very  useful  to  maintain  a  position during windy conditions or to
 unmask and quickly mask from cover.
 
                                   CYCLIC
 
 Push  the  Cyclic  (left  or  right arrow keys) left or right to rotate the
 helicopter  in  that  direction.  The speed of rotation is dependent on how
 far  the  Cyclic is pushed (multiple presses of the arrow key).  Centre the
 Cyclic  (press  the  opposite  arrow  key until rotation stops) to stop the
 rotation.  You can only rotate the helicopter at speeds under 10 knots.
 
                                    PITCH
 
 Add  a  little  more  collective.   As  you begin climbing, push the Cyclic
 forward  slightly  to  'pitch  down'  the helicopter.  You'll begin to move
 forward.  At about 30 knots, you'll start to climb.  Your altimeter and VSI
 reflect  this  change  in  lift.   This  is  because  forward  motion  in a
 helicopter  adds  extra  lift  (termed "translational lift"), especially at
 30-90 knots.
 
 The  further  you pitch down, the more your speed increases.  As your speed
 exceeds 100 knots, translational lift decreases.  The VSI starts to move to
 the  negative  end  of the scale.  More pitch downward will push you into a
 dive.
 
 EASY  FLIGHT:  Lift is unaffected by forward motion.  Your altitude remains
 constant, and is therefore independent of the cyclic.
 
 Move  the  cyclic forward or back until the airspeed reads about 120 knots.
 Now   check  the  VSI.   If  you're  descending  (the  indicator  is  below
 horizontal),  add  more  Collective  until  the  indicator  is  horizontal.
 Alternately,  if  you're  ascending  reduce  Collective.   When  the VSI is
 horizontal, you're in level flight.
 
 Due  to  the  slow  control  response, it's easy to over correct and add or
 reduce  the  collective  too  much.   You'll constantly "chase the needle",
 trying  to stabilize your flight.  After each adjustment, wait a moment for
 the VSI to stabilise.
 
 EASY FLIGHT:  These adjustments are unnecessary since lift is unaffected by
 forward motion.
 
 PAGE 55
       
                              CHANGING ALTITUDE  
 
 When  flying level (about 120 knots), the easiest way to descend is to push
 the  Cyclic forward (pitch down) into a dive.  As you approach the altitude
 desired,  gently  pull  the  Cyclic  back  (pitch  up)  until the VSI again
 stabilizes.   similarly, the easiest way to ascend is to pitch up slightly,
 reducing airspeed below 100 kts.  When you reach the desired altitude pitch
 down  again  until  the  VSI  stabilises.   This  technique  is  not unlike
 conventional  airplane  flight.   You're  able  to  change altitude without
 adjusting the collective.
 
 A  second  way  to change altitude, applicable at any speed, is to raise or
 lower  the  collective.   When  you  reach  the desired altitude, adjust an
 opposite amount of collective to regain level flight.  This is the only way
 to change altitude from a hover.
 
 Regardless  of  the  technique  used,  don't  try  to fly the helicopter by
 constantly   adjusting   the  collective.   Learn  to  "feel"  the  correct
 collective setting,and then fly with just your cyclic.  This takes time, so
 be  patient.   Even  real  pilots must practice many long hours before it's
 mastered.
 
 EASY  FLIGHT:   The  collective  must be used to change your altitude, it's
 just like choosing the floors on a lift.
 
                                  LOW LIMIT
 
 The  low  altitude  limit  is  a  flying aid that warns you of close ground
 proximity.   It  works  in  conjunction  with  the  radar altimeter, and is
 displayed as a red band on the radar altimeter.
 
                                   TURNING
 
 From  the  level  flight  (about  120 kts), move the cyclic slightly to the
 left.   Your  helicopter  rolls  into  a  banking  left turn.  As you turn,
 observe  the  change in your compass heading.  Move the cyclic further left
 and  bank  into  a  right turn; you'll now start to lose lift.  Notice that
 your  altitude  is dropping and the VSI is below horizontal.  If you centre
 the cyclic and level out, you'll return to level flight.
 
 There  are two methods to maintain altitude in a tight turn:  this could be
 very  important at low altitudes.  Add some Collective before you start the
 turn, then reduce the collective just before you come out of it.
 
 Alternately  pull up your nose slightly as you enter the turn, then drop it
 back  down  as  you  come  out of the turn.  With this method, you can make
 fast, banking turns without losing altitude.
 
 PAGE 56
 
 At  speeds  of  below  40 kts, the helicopter will skid ("sideslip") in the
 direction  of  cyclic  movement,  rather  than  bank into the turn; at this
 point, you're basically flying sideways.
 
 EASY  FLIGHT;  Altitude  is  never  lost,  no  matter  how  tight the turn.
 However, the helicopter wll sideslip at speeds below 40 kts.
 
 When  flying  below  100',  you  may feel air turbulence.  You'll sometimes
 bounce  up  and  down,  or  roll  from  side  to  side.   The amount of air
 turbulence  varies  with  altitude and speed; the faster and lower you fly,
 the more turbulence you may experience.
 
 Helicopter  crew men can't eject or bail out in times of trouble.  However,
 the  total  loss  of engine power means only one thing - they must ride the
 bucking bronco in.
 
 Fortunately,  helicopters  have the equivalent of a conventional airplane's
 "dead   stick"  landing.   This  unpowered  method  of  landing  is  called
 "autorotation".
 
 To begin an autorotation, disengage the rotor.  In real life the pilot must
 also  "bottom"  the  collective  (reduce  it  to  zero), but the collective
 automatically  bottoms  when  you  disengage  the rotor.  This must be done
 immediately,  or the rotor will slow to a stop (remember it's still engaged
 to  the  now-dead  engines).   If  the rotor stops, you'll fall like a baby
 grand piano.
 
 Now  adjust  the  pitch  until your airspeed is about 70 to 90 kts (maximum
 translational  lift).  The rotor is now spinning freely because the airflow
 keeps  the  blades  turning.   The  descent  will  become quite fast, a bit
 frightening  to the inexperienced.  When you get close to the ground, raise
 the  nose  and simultaneously add Collective.  The rotor blades will "bite"
 into  the air, giving you lift and slowing the descent.  Unfortunately , as
 the blades start to bite air resistance slows them down.
 
 You  must  time  the  "Up  Collective"  so that the helicopter lands gently
 (figuratively  speaking) before the rotor slows too much.  If you raise the
 collective  too  soon, the rotor will stall and you'll be playing the piano
 again.   If  you raise the collective too late, you won't slow your descent
 and you'll crash.  Nobody said it would be easy - it just takes practice.
 
 EASY  FLIGHT:   Autorotation is not functional with easy flight.  It's best
 to set 'no crashes' when in this mode.
 
 PAGE 57
 
                               FLIGHT ENVELOPE
 
 There  are  "Unsafe"  speed  and  altitude situations that, in the event of
 total  engine  failure,  will  unavoidably result in a crash.  These unsafe
 situations are considered to be outside of the "flight envelope".
 
 Hovering  at  altitudes from 25' to 500', or high speed flight below 20' to
 30'  will  probably  result in a crash if engine power is lost.  It takes a
 certain  amount  of time to convert from normal flight to autorotation.  In
 these situations, there just isn't enough time to gain control.
 
 However,  "unsafe"  is a relative term.  In combat situations unsafe flying
 is  probably  "safer"  than  taking  a hit.  During combat, chances must be
 taken; evaluate the situation and make the best decision.
 
                             RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
 
 Everyone  has rules they must abide by, and this is no different in combat.
 Helicopters live and fight near ground level, as high altitude is only safe
 for the jet jockeys.
 
 The   high  command  wants  to  assure  that  you  will  have  a  long  and
 distinguished  career.   Therefore,  your maximum altitude is restricted to
 1000' in all situations.  Any higher, and you'd be a sitting duck.
  
                                 ----------
                                 NAVIGATION
                                 ----------
 
                                 INS SYSTEM
 
 Pressing  the  Map View (F10) key displays the high scale mission map.  You
 can  always  fly  to specific points by dead reckoning or, more simply, you
 may input up to three waypoints into the INS system.
 
 To  input  waypoints,  press the Fly To (F) key; a yellow crosshair appears
 over  your  helicopter.   Use  the  Controller to move the crosshair to any
 point  on the map, and press Selector #1; waypoint #1 is now marked.  Press
 Selector  #2  to  stop  with  less than three waypoints or continue to mark
 waypoints  #2  and  #3.   Press  esc, at any time, to cancel the waypoints.
 Existing  waypoints are automatically cancelled whenever the Fly To (f) key
 is pressed (esc will cancel the command).
 
 Because  the high scale map is only a representation of the actual terrain,
 you may want to "fine-tune" the placement of the waypoints.  After all, you
 wouldn't  want  to  fly into a mountain.  Press the spacebar; the low scale
 map  is  marked  with  its number.  To adjust a waypoint, press its number.
 It's  now  centred  in  the  map display.  Use the Controller to adjust its
 placement; press Selector #2 when finished.
 
 PAGE 58
 
 The  current  INS heading is the flight path to the "active" waypoint.  The
 waypoint  range and heading can be displayed in the MFD.  The Next Waypoint
 (6)  and Previous Waypoint (7) keys are used to change the active waypoint.
 To manually adjust your course, always turn towards the INS pip.
 
 Press  the  Autopilot  (5)  key  at  anytime to engage the autopilot.  When
 engaged, it flies you to the "active " INS waypoint.
 
 When  flying during windy conditions, the same considerations that apply to
 an  airplane  apply  to  helicopters.   Namely, the wind will increase your
 speed,  slow  you  down, and/or push you sideways, depending on your flight
 path  in  relation  to  the  wind  velocity  and  direction.   This is most
 noticeable on long distance flights.
 
 Temperature also affects helicopter flight.  As air gets warmer, it expands
 and  becomes thinner, providing less lift.  If the air gets too cold, icing
 on  the rotor becomes a problem.  Similarly, in humid conditions the air is
 composed  of  more  water,  reducing  lift.  Finally, as altitude above sea
 level  increases,  air gets thinner, reducing lift.  For helicopters, ideal
 flying  conditions  are  70  degrees  F  (21 degrees C) on a dry day at sea
 level.
 
 The  nice  thing about helicopters is their ability to land without a paved
 airstrip.   However,  they can't land on sloping ground.  Any slope greater
 than  5  degrees  causes  so  much rotor tilt that the helicopter flies, or
 skids  away from the slope, making a landing impoosible.  NEVER try to land
 on a hillside - you'll crash!
 
 Ideally,  all  landings,  and  takeoffs for that matter, should be into the
 wind.   As  you  approach  the  base,  lower your altitude to about 50' and
 reduce  your  airspeed  to  60  kts by pulling back slightly on the Cyclic.
 You'll  need  to reduce the Collective to maintain your 50' altitude.  Your
 goal  is  to  land  in  the  centre of the base.  Just before you cross the
 outside edge of the base, begin slowing down to a hover bby pulling back on
 the  Cyclic.   Note  that  as  your  speed  drops  towards 0 your lift will
 decrease.  Add some Collective to maintain your altitude.
 
 The  wind will tend to push you away from your present position; the Cyclic
 should  be  moved  slightly  toward the wind, producing just enough skid to
 counteract the wind velocity.  This will maintain hover against the wind.
 
 PAGE 59
 
 Reduce  the Collective (easy does it here) to begin your final descent.  At
 about  20'  you  may  need  to  reduce  the  Collective  further to achieve
 touchdown.
 
 EASY FLIGHT:  The collective must be used to change your altitude; however,
 altitude is unaffected by the cyclic controls.
 
                                    FARPS
 
 Forward  Arming  and  refuelling  points  (FARP)  are  highly  mobile bases
 designed  to support helicopter operations.  They are placed near or around
 the battle area, and are usually set up to support a particular squadron or
 mission.   They  are  well  stocked  with aviation fuel and a full range of
 weapons.
 
 Your  mission  orders  indicate  if  a  FARP  is  available for the current
 mission.   If availabLe, yOu may land at the FARP just like any Other base.
 The  grouNd  crew  immediately  refuelS and rearms your helicopter and your
 flight.
 
 Unfortunately,  they're not supermarkets-there's no shopping allowed.  Your
 helicopters  are  refuelled  and  rearmed  to  match  your start of mission
 configurations.
 
                              CARRIER LANDINGS
 
 You  may  ask  what  business the Army has at sea?  As a member of a highly
 trained,  elite  force,  you  are more than up to the task.  Still, carrier
 based  landings are a little more complicated than your everyday open-field
 variety.
 
 The landing pad is smaller, and the carrier deck isn't at 0' altitude.  The
 radar  altimeter  is  the  key  instrumentation;  it  indicates  the proper
 approach  altitude  as  you  centre your position over the deck.  The other
 steps  are  just like landing on the ground, but be prepared to immediately
 max the collective if you've misjudged your approach.
 
                                  SHUT DOWN
 
 When  you  have  landed  at your base (altitude is 0), disengage the rotor.
 Your postflight options now appear.

                                HOW TO FIGHT
                                ------------
 
 Helicopter  combat  systems  have  come  a  long way since the days of door
 mounted   machine-guns   and   "wing  and  a  prayer"  defensive  measures.
 Contemporary helicopters possess an extensive array of weapon and defensive
 systems.   Each  has  been  tailored  to a specific target type or purpose.
 It's  important  to  become  familiar  with  each  system's  strengths  and
 weaknesses.   It'll  be  the  difference  between getting the target or the
 target getting you!
 
 Before  you  take  off,  re-examine the mission map, and decide on a flight
 path  that  will  take you to the primary or secondary.  Remember, the most
 obvious route may end up being the most disastrous.  Bounding directly into
 the  target  at 140 kts and 500' of altitude may work in training, but it's
 suicide against well-equipped troops.
 
 A  standard  technique  is  to fly to the target in short dashes.  Fly from
 behind  one  hill to another, then, hover and pop up briefly to scan ahead.
 Drop  down, pick your next destination and repeat the process.  Stay as low
 as  possible  when  dashing,  and  use  intervening  terrain  to  mask your
 movement.  It may sound boring, but you'll enjoy the results.
 
 Fuel is a major consideration:  it isn't unlimited.  Don't stretch yourself
 to  the  point  you  can't make it back.  This is especially important when
 flying over water.
 
 Any  success  quickly turns to failure if you lose your flight to poor fuel
 planning.   Always know the position of your base and FARP.  Don't hesitate
 to "top off" your tanks if there's any question.
 
 As you fly, watch the threat display; the top of the display coincides with
 your  current  heading.   A red dot is an opposing ground unit.  A blue dot
 means  an  opposing  aircraft  is  approaching.   A  yellow dot indicates a
 missile  in flight.  Note that the threat display can't distinguish between
 friendly and opposing missiles.  A grey dot is a friendly unit or a neutral
 structure.
 
 When  units  appear  on  your  threat display, they are also plotted on the
 maps.   They  appear  darker  when they disappear from your threat display;
 that's their last known position.
 
 PAGE 61
 
 Though   virtually   every   opposing   unit   has  some  sort  of  gun  or
 shoulder-launched  missile, the most dangerous are AA guns and vehicles and
 SAM vehicles.
 
                             WARNING INDICATORS
 
 Watch your warning indicators; they are the true measure of enemy activity.
 The  "I",  "R"  and  "L"  indicators turn or flash red to indicate opposing
 search  or  tracking activity.  Additionally, the originating unit's dot on
 the  threat  display automatically changes to a cross, thereby alerting you
 to the bearing of the most dangerous threat or threats.
 
                                   JAMMERS
 
 When  a  warning indicator illuminates, the standard response is to turn on
 the  corresponding  jammer, press the Radar Jammer (n) key or IR Jammer (.)
 key  ("L"  jammers currently aren't available).  A small green light beside
 the  warning  light  illuminates,  showing  your  jammer is active.  If the
 warning  indicator turns off, the jamming was successful.  Immediately turn
 onto a new course, as jammed missiles often continue on their old course.
 
 Keep  your  jammer  active  until  you destroy or fly away from the threat.
 It's  a  good  idea  to  immediately  activate  both  jammers if the threat
 concentration is high.
 
                                   DECOYS
 
 If  the warning indicator remains illuminated, try using a decoy; press the
 Chaff  (m)  key  or  Flare  (/)  key to launch a decoy.  The decoy indictor
 illuminates  as  long  as the decoy is active.  The decoy should be drawing
 the missile or gunnery to its position.

                              ----------------
 
                              HOW THEY FIND YOU
 
 For a general description of helicopter tactics, see pages 110 - 112.
 
 Ground  based  weapons utilize active radar, passive IR or optical means to
 search out and find targets.
 
 Search  radars  can "see" you at long distances in day or night.  A distant
 red  dot  on  the  threat  display  is  probably a search radar.  Since the
 purpose of search radars is to detect your presence, jammers and decoys are
 counter-productive, as both announce your presence!
 
 Other  units  use short-range passive IR or the old standby-eyesight.  They
 can't  see  you  until you're much closer, and at night optical sighting is
 especially limited.
 
 PAGE 62
 
 All  methods  of search are blocked by objects on the ground.  As a result,
 ground-based units have a "dead-zone" they can't see.  Above this dead-zone
 the  "eyes"  will  eventually find you.  This dead zone becomes smaller and
 lower as you approach the unit.
 
                            TRACKING AND EVASION
              
 If  a  search  is successful, they switch to "tracking" mode.  If employing
 radar,  they  constantly  illuminate  you with a radar beam.  This sets off
 your radar warning and causes the indicator to solidly illluminate.
 
 When  launched,  IR weapons set off your IR warning and cause the indicator
 to solidly illuminate.
 
 If  a  laser  ranger/designator  is  "painting"  your helicopter, the laser
 warning goes off and causes the indicator solidly illuminate.
 
 If  you`re  being  tracked  by  radar  or an IR weapon,use your jammers and
 decoys.  If that fails, try evasive flying.
 
 Dive to a lower altitude while turning parallel to or away from the threat.
 If  you  get  lower  and  avoid closing the range (the dead-zone effect),an
 enemy  often  loses  it`s  track.   Evasive  flying is a superior option to
 jammers and decoys, because it doesn`t broadcast your position.
 
 Laser  guided  and  visually  aimed  weapons can't be jammed or decoyed, so
 evasive flying is your only defence.
 
 If  they  find you, opposing guns will open fire and continue to fire until
 they  shoot  you  down.   You  must  either  break the track or destroy the
 weapon.   It's  that  simple.   If the gunfire is radar controlled, you can
 probably  break  the  track  with jamming or chaff.  However, all guns have
 optical backup systems (some have laser systems).
 
 The  best  way  to  avoid  gunfire  is  skilful evasive flying and dead-eye
 firepower.
 
 If  the  find  you, SAM equipped units will launch a missile.  Missiles are
 either  IR-guided,  radar-guided  or visually-guided.  When a missile is in
 flight, you'll see a yellow dot moving towards you on the threat display.
 
 Passive  IR-guided missiles are the most common on threat.  Your IR warning
 indicator  illuminates  when  they  approach.  Use your jammer or flares to
 "confuse"  the missile, but remember to turn away so as not to collide with
 it.
 
 PAGE 63
 
 Sophisticated  IR  missiles probably have visual or laser back up guidance;
 don't  get  too  elated if you defeat the IR-guidance, there may still be a
 nasty surprise in store.
 
 While   radar-guided  missiles  are  primarily  designed  for  use  against
 conventional  jet aircraft, they still pose a serious threat.  A radar beam
 reflecting off your helicopter guides the missile.  This radar beam is what
 illuminates  your  radar  warning  indicator.   Use your jammer or chaff to
 "confuse"  the missile, but remember to turn away so as not to collide with
 it.   Just  like  IR-guided  missiles,  radar  homers probably have back up
 guidance  systems.  Therefore defeating the radar is just the first step in
 defeating the missile.
 
 Visually  or  laser-guided  missiles are the greatest threats.  You have no
 effective  jammer  or  decoy  defences;  your  only  bet is evasive flying.
 Putting  terrain  between you and the missile is the best bet.  Flying into
 the  dead zone is the only other hope.  Remember, successful evasive flying
 requires  that  you  fly lower AND away from the launcher, flying lower may
 not be effective.
 
 After  all  this, there is some good news.  All missiles have one universal
 weak  point  -  they have a wide turning radius.  If you can get one close,
 dart  off  perpendicular  to  its  flight path; it will unable to turn fast
 enough  to  hit you.  This tactic is easier said than done in a slow moving
 helicopter (fast-movers swear by this manoeuvre).  It takes enormous skill,
 and  split  second timing to turn inside of a missile screaming in at Mach.

 The  Appendix  includes  a  summary of the various AAA and SAM systems that
 await  your  pleasure.   A  description of the search, tracking and missile
 guidance systems is listed, along with an estimate of their effectiveness.
 
 Study your mission intelligence briefings closely.  If necessary, reference
 the weapon system to understand its use and effectiveness.
 
                                 OUT AT SEA
 
 When out over the water, you have lost the best means of defence - terrain.
 You'll  need to stay extremely alert, since the opposing patrol craft carry
 a number of defence weapons.  Stay low or carry long range weapons, such as
 Penguin and Maverick.
 
 PAGE 64
                                   DAMAGE
 
 If  you're  unable  to  "spoof"  the  threat,  the  gunfire or missile will
 probably  hit your helicopter.  You'll see the explosion and the shudder of
 your helicopter.  If the hit was severe, one or more of the system's status
 lights will illuminate.  Systems will start to malfunction or fail.  You'll
 need to evaluate the damage to determine if you can continue the mission or
 need to return to base.
 
 If  you  are hit in multiple or critical systems, your helicopter will lose
 power.   The  only  way to survive this is to autorotate to a safe landing.
 The  number  of  hits  required for a general systems failure varies; after
 three or four, you should expect the worst.

 Your on-board targeting system is constantly scanning the forward arc; ;the
 system  is limited to the front 180 degrees.  It can't scan to the rear, so
 pay  close  attention to your flight path, and occasionally swing around to
 check your "six".
 
 The  targeting  system is line-of-sight dependent.  As a result, the higher
 you  are  the  farther  it  can  "see".  Of course, the higher you are, the
 easier it is for the other guys to spot you.
 
 The  targeting  system  automatically  "locks"  onto the closest target.  A
 diamond  appears  in  your  forward view, and an image of the target, along
 with  its range and heading data, displays in your MFD.  You may switch the
 target  lock,  assuming  others  are  in the area, by pressing Selector #2.
 There  may  be  a  momentary  delay;  the targeting system must re-scan the
 entire area for new targets.
 
 When the locked target is within maximum range for the selected weapon, the
 target box becomes a solid.  This range varies from weapon system to weapon
 system,  as  maximum  ranges  differ.   If  you fire at a target before the
 target box changes,there's no chance of a hit!
 
                             MAST-MOUNTED SIGHTS
 
 The  AH-64B  Longbow Apache, OH-58D Kiowa Warrior and the AH-6 Defender are
 equipped with a sighting system mounted on top of the main rotor hub.  This
 system  enables  these helicopters to "see" at greater ranges.  Better yet,
 they  may  peer  over  the  top of intervening terrain without exposing the
 helicopter.   Press  the Mast View (F2) key to switch to mast view; use the
 Controller to rotate your view.

                                   FIRING
 
 Depending  on  the  weapon  selected,  a  reticle ring or a fixed crosshair
 appears  in  your  view.   The  reticle  ring works with a"guided" weapons,
 whereas the crosshair works with "unguided" weapons.
 
 The reticle ring must be superimposed over the target diamond to accurately
 engage the target; adjust your lfight path if necessary.  It has a range of
 movement  that represents the angle of offset for the selected weapon.  The
 reticle  ring  also  becomes  larger  as  the  range  drops  indicating the
 "confidence" of the shot.
 
 The crosshair is always positioned directly ahead.  Unguided weapons always
 fly  or  fire  as  you  bear.  Adjust your flight path to coincide with the
 target  box.  There's no question it's a challenge to fire unguided weapons
 at  long  range.  Aiming errors, no matter how slight, normally result in a
 miss.
 
 Pressing  Selector  #1 fires the "active" weapon.  Cannons and machine-guns
 fire  in  20 round bursts.  Rockets fire in salvos of 1, 2 or 4.  All other
 weapons fire singly.
 
                                   WEAPONS
 
 The  weapon indicator displays the "active" weapon, its position and rounds
 remaining  rockets  also  indicate  the  current  salvo setting.  Press the
 spacebar to change the active weapon.
 
 All  rockets,  both  gun  pods  and  the  AH-6  Defender's integral gun are
 unguided weapons, the remaining weapons are all guided.
 
 Certain  weapons  are  only  effective  against  certain target types.  The
 Appendix   includes   a   summary   of   the   weapon   systems,  including
 characteristics   and   effectiveness.   Familiarise  yourself  with  these
 systems.   There's  nothing  worse  than  blazing away at a target, wasting
 round after round, only to discover that you're using the wrong weapon.
 
 When  you  fire  a  cannon  or  a  guided missile, the helicopter bucks and
 recoils  upward;  some  altitude  will be gained due to the loss in forward
 motion.
 
 NOTE:  this effect isn't experienced in easy flight mode.
 
 PAGE 66
                                 SECONDARIES
 
 If  a  locked  target is part of the primary or secondary mission, a prompt
 appears in the MFD along with the other target data.
 
 Your  invisible  co-pilot/gunner  (the front seater - back seater if you're
 flying  the AH-66A Comanche) assists you in two ways during the course of a
 mission.  First, by communicating important system status and threat/target
 information;  and second, by assuming control of part of the weapon systems
 functions.  The degree of weapon system control is dependednt upon the CP/G
 reality switch setting.
                          
 The  best  thing  about  helicopters  is  their ability to approach targets
 undetected;   they   literally   live   (from  a  survival  standpoint)  at
 nap-of-the-earth  (NOE) altitude - about 100'.  They move in and out of the
 terrain like a jungle cat stalking its prey.
 
 Sneak  up  on suspected targets, and use caution.  Take a few extra minutes
 to  evaluate  the situation.  The pilot that plunges headlong into a combat
 situation  will  more  than  likely  retreat  just as quickly with his tail
 between  his  legs.  Leave the flamboyant entries to the jet jockeys - they
 need more attention, anyway!.
 
 If  possible  attack from the flank rather than the front; this is referred
 to  as  an enfilade attack.  You can engage targets in turn, while limiting
 the  number  that  can  spot you.  If you engage from the front, all of the
 targets can spot you simultaneously.
 
 Use long range engagements; the further you stay away, the better.  Most of
 your  weapons  are  longer-ranged than the opposition's - take advantage of
 it.
 
 If  you  only  remember one thing, NEVER overfly the target.  If you didn't
 destroy the target, you're giving away a free shot at your tail.
 
 First  and  foremost,  choose  the  right  tool for the job.  Evaluate your
 mission  orders  carefully  and  outfit  your  helicopters  with  the  most
 advantageous  mix  of weapons.  For example, if you're ordered to intercept
 enemy  shipping, you may want to take a few Penguins or Mavericks along for
 the ride.
 
 PAGE 67
                                   WEAPONS
 
 Once  in  combat,  make sure that the "active" weapon is the most effective
 choice.  Don't try to fire Sidewinders at tanks or TOW's at aircraft.
 
 CANNONS;  are  close  range  weapons  that  are  best fired straight ahead.
 Deflection  shots to the sides will consume more ammunition and reduce your
 chance  of  hit.   The  Apache  A&B's 30mm cannons and the SuperCobra's and
 Comanche's  20mm  cannons are essentially guided weapons - they're aimed by
 your  targeting  system.  The defender's machine-gun and pod guns must fire
 straight ahead.
 
 MACHINE-GUNS:  are very close range weapons, and can only be fired straight
 ahead.   They lack the penetrative power of cannons, and therefore are only
 effective against unarmoured targets.
 
 ROCKETS;  are  available  in  three  types.   Each  is  best  suited  for a
 particular type of target, but can be effective against other target types.
 They're  unguided weapons, and are therefore easier to fire at close range.
 However, they can be fired in salvos, and you can carry a fair number.
 
 ATGMs:   are  also  available in three types.  They're powerful anti-armour
 weapons  that can be effectively utilized against structures ships and even
 slow moving aircraft.
 
 TOW  is  a  wire-guided  weapon  that's steered to the target.  It's not as
 difficult  as it may seem.  As long as the target is locked, corrections to
 the  missile's  flight path are automatically calculated and transmitted to
 the  TOW  over  the  un-spooling  wire.   However,  the wire is the biggest
 limitation - it runs out at about 3,800 metres.
 
 HELLFIRE-A  is  a  laser designated weapon that homes in on reflected laser
 light.   It's  much  longer  ranged  than  the  TOW  and has a wider target
 envelope.   Since  the Hellfire "sees" the reflected light, the designation
 can  be switched to a different target; if it's within the target envelope,
 the  Hellfire  will  hit  the  new  target.   This allows for "ripple fire"
 tactics.   Multiple  missiles are fired at short intervals; after the first
 hits,  the designator "spots" the new target, and then, and then guides the
 second missile.
 
 PAGE 68
 
 LASERS  are  not  as effective during low visibility conditions.  Rain, fog
 and  snow  can refect some or all of the laser light limiting range and hit
 probabilities.   There's  another  disadvantage; if you're designating your
 own target, you must also expose the helicopter until the Hellfire hits the
 target.
 
 HELLFIRE  -  B is the latest version of this effective weqpon system.  It's
 the  primary  armament  on  Longbow Apaches; it can't be carried on Model-A
 Apaches.   It  replaces  the  laser homer with a fire-and-forget millimeter
 wave radar homer.  All you do is find the target, and fire the missile - it
 doesn't get any easier.  This combined with the Lonbow's mast mounted sight
 makes for a potent, unbeatable combination.
 
 SIDEARM;  is  designed  to  home  in  on  any surface radar emission source
 therefore,  it's  classified  as  an  "anti-radiation  missile".   Its  big
 brothers,  HARM, Standard and Shrike, have been utilized to great effect on
 conventional aircraft for years.  Now, helicopters possess a similar punch.
 You  don't  have  to get a target lock to fire a Sidearm; just make sure to
 fire   it  towards  the  radar  source.   It's  fragmentation  warhead  and
 fire-and-forget  technology  make  it  one  terrific  "quick-draw" weapon-a
 surefire way to permanently cancel that radar.
 
 THE  BIG  LOADS;  Maverick  and  Penguin  are  heavyweight  special purpose
 weapons.   Their  use in helicopters is shrouded in controversy; some argue
 they're  not  worth their weight.  The opponents feel that Hellfire is just
 as  effective,  and  you  can  carry  4  Hellfires  for every 1 Maverick or
 Penguin.   On  the  other hand, Maverick and Penguin are both longer ranged
 than  the  Hellfire  and  are  fire-and-forget  weapons.   The  arrival  of
 Hellfire-B makes the argument even hotter-the decision is yours.
 
 Not what you'll wear to your next costume party, it's the method of terrain
 shielding  often  called the 'pop up'.  It's also where the auto-hover pays
 for  its  weight.   It  automatically  maintains  your present position and
 altitude even in the face of a stiff wind.
 
 Pull  up  behind  a  convenient  hill position and drop your airspeed to 0:
 your  altitude  should  be  about 100' - 150'.  As your airspeed approaches
 8-10  kts  (it  must  be 10kts or less), press the Auto-Hover (O) key; this
 immediately reduces your airspeed to O.
 
 PAGE 69
 
 Now  press  the Collective Up (=) key to start a slow ascent.  As you clear
 the  crest  of  the hill, stop your ascent.  If your helicopter is equipped
 with  a  mast-mounted  sight,  stop the ascent just as the sight clears the
 hill.  You're now in position to scan the surrounding area.
 
 If  you  lock onto an important target engage it immediately, and then drop
 down  below  the crest; press the Collective Down (-) key.  Otherwise, drop
 below  the  crest  and  re-evaluate the situation.  If necessary, check the
 mission  map.   You may need to adjust your flight path, or unmask again to
 engage the other targets.
 
 As  an  alternative approach, rotate the helicopter left or right by moving
 the  Cyclic  left  or right.  Then push the Cyclick ahead slightly to add a
 few  knots  of  airspeed.   Try to keep your airspeed under 10 kts.  As you
 clear  the  side of the hill, press the Auto-Hover (O) key, and rotate back
 to  the  forward  area.   After  scanning the area or engaging the targets,
 reverse  the  process  (with  a little more haste this time), and duck back
 behind the hill.  While this method of unmasking limits the scanning range,
 due   to   low  altitude,  it's  an  excellent  method  of  engaging  known
 targets-longer ranged targets probably won't spot you.
 
 Remember  with auto-hover active,you can quickly drop altitude by virtually
 bottoming the collective it holds you at the low limit.
 
                                   TARGETS
 
 Your  missions  present  a  number  of  target  options,  each  with unique
 characteristics   requiring  different  tactics  of  engagement  or  weapon
 selection.   Always look before you shoot; the high command gets real upset
 when you start shooting up the friendlies.
 
 AAA  & SAM's:  are your biggest challenge.  These are the only targets that
 can  fire  back with any real effect.  Getting in the first shot is the key
 here.   Both types have reaction times of 5 to 20 seconds, depending on the
 sophistication  of  equipment  and the skill of the crew.  If you plan your
 attack carefully, you can "take them out" before they even get a shot off.
 
 PAGE 70
 
 TANKS  &  LIGHT  VEHICLES:   can  be  a  turkey shoot.  Attack helicopters,
 especially  the  Apache, are made to destroy tanks and vehicles.  The tanks
 don't  carry anything larger than a short range 14.5mm machine-gun; you can
 pick  them  off  easily.   IFV's and APC's can be a bit nastier; they carry
 shoulder-launched  SAMs.  Most of the other vehicles such as truck convoys,
 are totally unarmed.
 
 This  may  seem  too good to be true, but before you think it's a cakewalk,
 the  opposition  has also recognised these weaknesses.  Groups of tanks and
 other  vehicles  normally  travel with AAA & SAM vehicles.  Keep an eye out
 for these escorts.
 
 WORKING  ON  THE  RAILROAD:   doesn't  get  any easier than this.  Railroad
 'rolling  stock"  isn't  much  of a challenge, but important none the less.
 You  know  where  they  are  and  where they must go; it's just a matter of
 laying in wait and taking them out of action.
 
 NAVAL  TARGETS;  can  get  quite  pesky,  and the opposition has a habit of
 placing  armed forces on their oil platforms.  Guided weapons are a must in
 these  situations.   They  are  better  suited to deal with the maneuvrable
 patrol craft, and you need their punch to take out the oil platforms.
 
 INFANTRY:   are  difficult  to  spot and root out.  They're only armed with
 light  weapons,  but  most  also carry shoulder-launched SAMs.  Rockets and
 cannon/machine-gun fire are a good choice in this case.
 
 STRUCTURES;  pose problems similar to infantry.  Although bigger and easier
 to  spot,  they  are seldom undefended.  SAMs and all types of AAA guns are
 usually  in  the  vicinity.   If  you  pick  off  the  defenders first, the
 structures are then fair game.
 
 Bunkers  and  bridges are especially tough nuts to crack.  It may take more
 than one hit to destroy them.

                              AIR-TO-AIR-COMBAT
 
 When heLicOpters were first envisioned as cOmbat weapoNS, the importance of
 air-to-air  combat  was  all but overlooked in the USA.  Unfortunately, the
 Soviet planners were not so short sighted.
 
 The  Soviets have always placed a strong emphasis on air-to-air combat, and
 have   made   concerted  efforts  to  design  this  capability  into  their
 helicopters.   Many in the US Intelligence community consider the new Ka-34
 Hokum to be a purpose built "anti-helicopter" helicopter.
 
 Fortunately,  the  US  military planners are no longer ignoring this all to
 important  technology.  Air-to-air weapons have become a standard load when
 flying  where  air  superiority  is  in  doubt.  The new AH-66A Comanche is
 designed  with  a  high  degree of air combat functionality; it's closer in
 concept to high-performance jet aircraft than past helicopter designs.
 
 In  actual air-to-air combat, one facet that requires constant vigilance is
 a helicopter's ability to spring from nowhere.  It's on you before you know
 what is happening, snaps off a missile and vanishes in the wink of an eye.
 
 Helicopter  borne air-to-air missiles are the primary threat.  They come in
 all varieties of homers, and are usually more maneuvrable than ground based
 weapons.   The  helicopters  also  carry machine-guns or cannons.  Unit for
 unit, they can pack just as strong a punch as the friendlies.
 
 In Chapter 3, Helicopter Tactics, a number of the tactical maneuvres key to
 air-to-air  combat,  are discussed and diagrammed, but it essentially boils
 down to a few specific factors.
 
 ALTITUDE:   Stay low!  Aircraft like nothing more than to find a helicopter
 flying  up  where  only  the  eagles should dare.  It's bad enough exposing
 yourself to the ground fire, but it's murder against aircraft.
 
 TAKE  THE  FIRST  SHOT; If you can get the first shot in, you have the best
 chance of coming out on top.  Pay attention to the threat display, and stay
 ready to snap off a quick shot.
 
 PAGE 72
 
 RANGE:   Fire  at  the  longest range possible.  This gives you a chance to
 reposition  and take additional shots.  Additionally, if they have ordnance
 in the air, it gives more time to counter or evade.
 
 HOLD  THE  ADVANTAGE:  Get on the aircraft`s tail or keep it to your front.
 NEVER  lose sight of the enemy!  If they get on your tail, use a side flare
 or  a  horizontal scissors to reverse the advantage.  If necessary, use the
 LEFT VIEW (F3) key or RIGHT VIEW (F4) key to maintain visual contact
 
 There  aren`t  as many decisions to make with air-to-air weapons.  They are
 adaptations  of  existing weapon systems.  To date, the first purpose built
 helicopter AAM is yet to be seen.
 
 CANNONS;  is  the  choice  for  close quarters.  The Apache, Supercobra and
 Comanche use their helmeted mounted sights to maintain lock-on during tight
 twists  and turns.  Fixed-firing cannons can still be effective, especially
 with  tail  shots.  Don't waste your time with machine-guns; when you're up
 against gunships, their armour can't be penetrated.
 
 SIDEWINDER;  the  father  of the Sidearm, is one of the most successful and
 tested   weapon   systems   in   service.    It's   a  highly  maneuvrable,
 fire-and-forget  IR  homer.   It's  long-ranged and packs a potent warhead.
 Like  Sidearm,  you don't have to get a target lock; just make sure to fire
 it  towards  the  IR  source.  Long range multiple engagements are a simple
 process;  just  disperse  the  missiles  so  they don't home in on the same
 target.
 
 STINGER:  may be about half the weight of Sidewinder, but is certainly more
 than  up  to  the  task.   You  can  also  carry  twice as many Stingers as
 Sidewinders;  you never know when you may need those extra shots.  While it
 may  be  shorter  ranged,  it'll  reach just about every thing you can see.
 Some targets may take two hits, but those should be few and far between.
 
 HELSTREAK;  is  a  British  import  that's  derived  from  the ground-based
 Starsteak  SAM.  It's carried by the Longbow Apache and the Comanche.  It's
 not  a  fire-and-forget  system;  laser  guidance  must  be provided by the
 launching  helicopter.   Therefore,  a  lock-on  must  be attained prior to
 launch.   On  the  plus  side, it flies faster than Sidewinder and Stinger,
 which reduces the exposure time.  It's three element warhead covers a broad
 area, so close is probably good enough.  As an added advantage, it can also
 fire at ground targets.  Its warheads can pierce most medium weight armour.
 
 PAGE 73
 
                                   TARGETS
 
 HELICOPTERS:   For  the  most  part,  Stingers and Helstreaks are more than
 adequate.   It's  the  rare  case  where  one  shot  won't  do  the  trick;
 Sidewinders  may be overkill.  Don't discount Hellfires in a pinch.  If the
 helicopter  isn't  moving  too  fast,  you  can reasonably maintain a lock,
 especially  from hover.  When you get in close, switch to cannon and 'hose'
 them down.  M255 rockets can also be a nasty surprise!

                         --------------------------
 
 
 The  essence  of  Gunship 2000 is the multi-helicopter operations.  Through
 this  mechanism, you direct the flying, combat and support functions of the
 other four helicopters in your flight.  It's a simple, straightforward, yet
 powerful process that's executed through a series of single key commands.
 
 After  receiving  your  commission,  the door opens to this challenging and
 exciting process.
                          
 Press  the  Map  View  (F10)  key  to access the flight commands menu.  The
 commands are listed across the bottom of the screen.  Commands available to
 the "active" section or helicopter display "brightly"
 
 As you toggle through the helicopters, information relating to the "active"
 helicopter  displays  along  the  left  side.   The combat data link system
 automatically  tracks  key  helicopter  systems and mutually transmits this
 data via its communication link to all helicopters in the flight.
 
                              DAMAGE SCHEMATIC
                              ----------------
 
 The  schematic helicopter diagram graphically displays damage to helicopter
 systems.   A  yellow  burst  over  a  system  indicates damage; a red burst
 indicates system failure.
 
 The  Rotor,  tail  rotor, left wing, right wing, left engine, right enginge
 and  cannon  indicate  damage  in  their  respective positions.  Optics are
 located  in the nose and/or mast-mounted sight; avionics are located in the
 tail  boom;  and fuel cells are located below the cockpit positions.  While
 these  positions  may  not  be  true  location in all helicopter types, the
 consistency helps speed recognition.

                               ---------------
 
 The  command list is utilised to pass instructions to the other helicopters
 in the flight.  Commands given to a section leader apply to all helicopters
 in that section.  Helicopters in your section always fly your course, speed
 and altitude unless instructed to do otherwise.
 
                                  NEXT UNIT
 
 All  commands  applicable to a section leader may also be given to a single
 helicopter.   In  this  case,  the  helicopter  deviates  from the leader's
 control.
 
 Press  the  Next  Unit  (n)  key to toggle between the helicopters.  If the
 helicopters  are flying as part of a single section, the helicopter display
 in numerical order.  If a heavy and light section are both operational, the
 other  section  leader  displays  first, followed in numerical order by the
 remaining helicopters.
 
                                   FLY TO
 
 Press the Fly to (f) key to establish a flight path.  Up to three waypoints
 can be placed.  This command is applicable to your helicopter.
 
                                HOLD POSITION
 
 Press  the  Hold  Position  (h)  key  to  order the section to maintain its
 present  position.  The Section maintains its current altitude and heading,
 but  reduces  its airspeed to O.  This command can be given to a section at
 any point; it doesn't cancel existing waypoints.  Pressing the key a second
 time cancels the hold.
 
 Upon  reaching  its  destination,  the  section  immediately assumes a hold
 command.
 
                                    SPEED
 
 Press  Speed  (s)  key  to  modify the section's airspeed.  There are three
 possible settings-slow, medium and fast.
 
 Slow speed is 50% of the possible maximum for the current altitude.
 
 Medium speed (the default) is 75% of the possible maximum.
 
 Fast speed is 100% of the possible maximum.
 
 Pressing the key loops through the possible settings.
 
                                  ALTITUDE
 
 Press  the  Altitude  (a)  key to modify the section's altitude.  There are
 three possible settings - NOE, contour and low.
 
 NOE  altitude  (the  default)  is 20' higher than your present low altitude
 limit setting.
 
 PAGE 76
 
 Contour altitude is 150' higher.
 
 Low altitude is 350' higher.
 
 Pressing the key loops through the possible settings.
 
 Press the Land (l) key to order the section to land upon reaching its final
 waypoint.   If  no  active  waypoints exist, the section immediately lands.
 The section seeks out terrain suitable for a landing in the immediate area.
 
 Press the Return to base (b) key to order the section to immediately return
 to  base;  all  existing  waypoints  are  cancelled.   If  on a deep strike
 mission, the section returns to the passage point.
 
 The  section  initiates  the  default  speed  and  altitude  unless ordered
 otherwise.   The section takes the most direct route to the base, and lands
 upon reaching its destination.
 
 Press  Disengage  (d) key to order the section to immediately break contact
 and  move  away from all opposing forces.  Upon reaching a "safe" position,
 the  section  assumes  a  hold  command.  This command cancels all existing
 waypoints.
 
 The  section  disregards  this  command  if  not  currently in contact with
 opposing forces.
 
 Press the Regroup (g) key to order an independent helicopter to immediately
 rejoin  its section.  It takes the most direct route, and initiates default
 speed and altitude settings.  This command cancels all existing waypoints.
 
 Press  the  Weapons  Free  (w) key to order a section to engage all sighted
 targets.   The section employs the appropriate weapons, if available, based
 on  target  type.   Pressing  the  key  a second time returns the section's
 weapons  to  "hold".   Helicopters  on  "hold" status fly directly to their
 destinations.
 
 The section freely employs defensive measures on either setting.
 
 PAGE 77
                                 CARGO DROP
 
 Press  the Cargo Drop (c) to order the section's cargo carrying helicopters
 immediately  to drop their cargo.  The section's UH-60 K/L, Blackhawks drop
 their cargo upon reaching the Primary/Secondary waypoint.

                               --------------
 
 Communication is the key element to any successful operation.  Since you're
 an  active pilot in the flight, not some desk jockey, you must rely on your
 pilots to keep you abreast of developments.
 
 During the course of a mission, your pilots communicate key information and
 status   updates.    The   messages   include  target  sightings,  reaching
 destinations and damage updates.
 
 Their  call  sign  appears  on  the screen, along with their message.  This
 enables  you to fly your portion of the mission and not constantly check on
 flight status.
 
 When  important  situations  do develop, you can immediately access the Map
 view  to re-evaluate and revise orders as necessary.  You can also "jump on
 their  tail"  by pressing the Flight chase View (shift F5) to directly view
 the situation.
 
 If,  for  any reason, you are unable to read an entire message, press alt m
 to re-display the last message.
 
                                  STRATEGY
 
 It's  probably  easier  to just say I'll do it myself, but combat is a team
 effort.   The  commander  that  best employs flight assets will be the most
 successful.  You could always keep the entire flight with you at all times,
 but  that  will  limit  your options dramatically.  Give the other pilots a
 chance; they'll give you their best.
 
 PAGE 78
 
 Use your flight to the best of its abilities.  Inexperienced pilots may not
 do  exactly  what you had in mind.  Developing skills and moxie takes time,
 just  as  you've  probably  found  out  by now.  Experience is a measure of
 missions  flown, rank and decorations.  Your best pilot will have flown the
 most missions, is one rank under you, and has a chest full of decorations
 
 This  pilot  is  your  best  choice  for  the  other section leader.  Avoid
 selecting  that  wet  behind  the  ears W-O1, fresh out of flight training.
 Don't ask any of them to do more than they're capable of accomplishing.
 
 Try  to envision yourself flying this leg of the mission; what would you do
 if  you  were  there?  Apply a command stream that accomplishes that image.
 If  you  give  them  poor  orders,  they'll  perform  poorly.  You're their
 commander; they look to you for the right measure.
 
 The tactics described earlier still apply here.  fly and fight smart.
 
 Scouts  play  a  very  useful role as independent helicopters.  Send one on
 ahead  to look for enemy units and/or to clear a safe flight path.  It's no
 use  sending  loaded  Blackhawks  into  totally unfamiliar territory; their
 loads are just too valuable to squander away.
 
 A  Kiowa  Warrior  can  also  mark  targets  for Hellfire equipped Apaches,
 Supercobras  and  Blackhawks.   The  gunships can wait safely behind a hill
 while the Kiowa Warrior is out looking for some ripe targets.
 
 With  the  opposing  forces  constantly  on  the move, it`s easy to stumble
 accross  a  force  occupying  an  area  you  thought was clear or just flew
 through a few minutes ago.  It`s usually expedient to position a helicopter
 in covering terrain along any suspected movement paths.
 
 Also,  a  helicopter can be positioned to cover your "back door".  This way
 you  can be confident that your means of exit is clear of enemy forces when
 you need to get out quick.

                           SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
 Upon  landing  UH-60K/L Blackhawks automatically drop off their passengers,
 unless  at a base or FARP .  Be sure they're at the correct location before
 giving the orders to land.  They also automatically pick up any passengers,
 if in the vicinity, when they land.
 
 Cargo  drops  are  also  automatic.   Even though cargo can be successfully
 dropped  without  making  a landing.  It's easier to verify the location by
 landing  first.   Of  course, if the LZ is "hot", you may be forced to drop
 the load and get out quickly.

                              -----------------
                              AFTER THE MISSION
                              -----------------
 
                                   SUCCESS
 
 You've landed, and are relatively safe and secure.  The S2 now wants to run
 through the debriefing.  Never an easy read, you can't tell if he's pleased
 or  disappointed.   The mission replay indicates how well you did this time
 out.
 
 If  you  do  nothing else, complete the primary and secondary missions, and
 return safely to your base.  If you can manage only one of the two, make it
 the  primary.  Destroying additional units is always a plus, but not at the
 expense  of  your  missions.  Stay focused, but flexible.  The TF commander
 has a habit of changing missions.
 
 Promotions  and  decorations  are awarded for hitting the assigned missions
 and  returning  an  intact  helicopter to base.  Time is also a performance
 measure.   You can't spend the entire day flying just one mission; you need
 to  get  in  and  get  out  as  quick  as  possible.   There's only so many
 helicopters  and  pilots  available,  and  more  than  enough mission to go
 around.
 
 If  you land and abandon your helicopter, every attempt is made to pick you
 up,  but you may be captured by the opposing forces.  Naturally, the chance
 of rescue increases if you're near a base or FARP.  The best bet is to make
 it  back  to  base.   It's better to return even if you can't complete your
 missions.  You can always return to fight another day.
 
 When  a  campaign  is  completed,  you are advised as to the outcome.  This
 shouldn't  be  any  surprise,  you've  known  the  progress all along.  The
 campaign map is routinely updated when you attend briefings.
 
 Successful  completion  of  your  assigned  mission  improves  your overall
 record.   An excellent record leads to promotion.  However, even in combat,
 promotions  take  time.   don't expect a promotion after every mission.  As
 you  increase  in  rank, promotions are even harder to come by.  After all,
 not everyone can be a Brigadier General.
 
 A  reprimand  on  your  record  makes promotion more difficult.  Reprimands
 occur  whenever  you  decline  a mission, or you fail to achieve either the
 primary  or  secondary mission.  On the other hand, decorations for heroism
 move you to the head of the promotion pack.

                           BATTLEFIELD COMMISSIONS
 
 The  TF  commander  is  always  on  the  lookout for pilots with leadership
 potential.   If  you're selected to receive a commission, you're approached
 by  the  TF  commander.   The  choice  is yours to make; it's not required.
 However,  accepting the commission does open the door to the exciting world
 of multiple helicopter flight.
 
 The  TF  is  persistent.   He'll  keep  after  you  even  if  you decline a
 commission.   If  you continually decline the offer of a commission, CW4 is
 the highest rank you can attain.
 
                                 DECORATIONS
 
 If  you  do exceptionally well on a mission, you may be awarded a medal for
 heroism  and  valour.   Unlike  promotions, decorations are based purely on
 your  performance  during  a  single mission.  Your current rank and record
 have no effect on your chance of getting decorated.
 
 In   addition  to  the  decorations  for  heroism  and  valour,  two  other
 decorations  can  be  awarded.  The National Defence Service Medal is given
 for  successfully  completing training, and the Purple Heart is awarded for
 wounds received in combat.
 
                               --------------
                               MISSION REPLAY
                               --------------
 
 The  mission  replay  summarises  the key events of your mission.  It shows
 what  went well and not so well.  It's a learning experience; the next time
 out apply the lessons learned from this mission.
 
                                FILM LIBRARY
 
 Upon  the  completion  of  a  mission,  or  if you access the mission films
 through the Squadron Archives, the Film Library panel appears.
 
 Here  you  select the film to view; the last mission flown is always titled
 "Last  Mission".   To  select a film, position the cursor on the title line
 and  press  Selector  #1;  the  selected title highlights.  Press "Play" to
 begin the replay.
 
 From  this  control  panel,  you  may also rename and delete mission films.
 Remember,  if  you  wish  to  save a current mission, you must rename "Last
 Mission" or it'll be lost after the next mission.
 
 Once you fill the entire page, the slide bar to the right is used to scroll
 the film listing.
 
                             EXTERNAL VIEWPOINT
 
 In this the default viewpoint, replay displays the actual combat films from
 your  mission.  You are there again with your flight, with an "out of body"
 view of all the action.  A short mission summary is displayed at the top of
 the replay screen.
 
 PAGE 81
 
 A  running  list  of  events  is  displayed on the panel.  This way you can
 follow along with the action as it happens.
 
 Replay uses a "VCR" type panel to control the replay functions.  During the
 Conventional  Replay,  the Controller is used to position the cursor over a
 key; press Selector #1 to activate the key.  As an alternative, the tab and
 shift keys can be used to position the cursor.
 
 Press the directional keys to adjust the point of view.
 
 Press the r key to rewind the beginning of the replay.
 
 Press the s key to stop the replay.
 
 Press the p key to start the replay.
 
 Press  the n key to fast forward to the next event.  Upon reaching the next
 event, replay automatically shifts into the "play" mode.
 
 Press the f key to fast forward.
 
 Press  the respective numeric key to shift the view to that helicopter.  If
 the mission type was "single", only the 1 key is active.
 
 Press the t key to shift the view to the target.
 
 Press alt x  to resume the fight.
 
 Press alt y to activate the DEMO viewpoint.  Press alt y to return again to
 the external viewpoint.
 
 The  replay  takes  the  "pilots"  viewpoint.   In  this mode, you view the
 mission  from  the  pilot's seat.  All actions are replayed exactly as they
 occurred in the actual mission.
 
 To  exit  the replay, press alt e, this returns you to the game.  To return
 to the control panel, press alt y.
 
 Replay  offers  one  additional exciting feature.  You can jump in and take
 over a flight at any point during the replay!  Position the cursor over the
 Resume key and press Selector #1 (or press alt x).
 
 PAGE 83
 
 This  feature  is  an  excellent  combat  tool  for learning and developing
 tactics.   You can re-fly a tough mission, change your tactics, and observe
 the  impact  of  a  revised  plan  of attack.  Or, you can re-enter another
 pilot's  mission,  and see if you can top their results.  These "films" are
 loaded via the squadron archives file.
 
 When  you  re-enter  a mission, you are positioned in the #1 helicopter and
 are now in control with all game controls active.
 
 The  results of a re-entered mission never affects your record, nor are the
 results of this "mission" recorded for future viewing.  The original replay
 remains intact. 
 
 To exit, press alt e; this returns you to the game.
 
                              FLIGHT PROMOTIONS
 
 The pilots in your flight are also eligible for promotions and decorations.
 The high command makes recommendations as to who should be promoted and who
 should  receive decorations.  As the flight commander, you're authorised to
 accept the recommendations or transfer the awards to other pilots.
 
 To change a recommendation, highlight the award and press Selector #1.  The
 award  is  transferred  to  the  next  pilot.  Promotions are automatically
 adjusted  to  the  next  higher  rank.  A pilot can't be promoted to a rank
 equal to your current rank.  Decorations are awarded as presented.
 
 When  you  concur with the recommendations or changes, highlight the accept
 key and press selector #1.
 
                                REPLACEMENTS
 
 If  you're ever faced with the unfortunate situation of having to replace a
 pilot  lost in combat, you'll automatically receive a W-O1 replacement from
 the pilot pool.
 
 If  you're  not  satisfied  with  the  replacement or you wish to change an
 existing  pilot,  the  pilot  replacement  screen is provided to make these
 administrative  changes.   You  may  replace the pilot, but the new pilot's
 rank and decorations are comparable.
 
 Hilight the pilot to be replaced, and press selector #2.  Enter the name of
 the new pilot and press selector #1.
