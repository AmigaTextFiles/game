          BLADE OF DESTINY FULL MANUAL AND INSTALLATION GUIDE
          ===================================================

			        Part 2

LEAVING TOWN: PORTS AND TRAILS
------------------------------

It`s  time to break out the adventuring gear and head for the signpost.  As
you  travel  through  Thorwal,  or  any  of Arkanias towns you`ll see posts
pointing  the  way  to  one  destination  or  another.  Typically there are
numerous  posts  in  a single town each leading to a different destination.
Among all the posts though, there are two, basic differences:

Harbours:   Signposts  at  the  water's  edge give you the chance to secure
passage  aboard  ships  traveling to various locales.  Since ships come and
go,  the  destinations found at the seaports change daily.  A word with the
Harbour  Master  can  offer you an expanding look at the harbour's traffic.
When you step up to a port's signpost you'll receive the Port Options.

Path/Road:  Signposts at a villages edge note the way of roads and paths to
other  towns,  and  follow  the  general  layout  of Arkania.  For example,
signposts to the east generally lead to eastern destinations.  When you opt
to travel onfoot you`ll enter the Traveling Options

Packing Your Bags
-----------------

Before  your characters head out of town, spend a few minutes with them, It
may  be several hours (maybe even several days) before they see a town or a
merchant again.  Make certain they're prepared for the trip:

. Check the amount of rations and water each character carries
  you feel it's not enough for the trip, buy more from a merchant
  Pizza places do not deliver to the middle of Orc territory.

. How are your character's hunger and thirst levels holding out. Fill
  their bellies and quensh their thirst before they leave. Otherwise
  you may be forced to stop mid-route when a character complains
  of hunger pangs

. Are all your weapons and armor whole? If not, visit a smith to make
  the necessary reparation.

. Are your characters well rested? If not catch some shut eye.

. Should you make a last-minute trip to a healer to treat disease
  wounds or poison?

. Do you have a good selection of herbs, potions or other things that
  you nmight need? Also, don't ignore adventuring gear.

. Put your best character forward.  If you're traveling in the
  wilderness, characters with strong Nature skills are best to lead
  you party. They will also notice tracks and other landscape
  features that lesser skilled companions might miss. Characters
  traveling by boat are best lead by a character skilled in survival
  skills. As the party waits in cramped corners and shares day to day
  life with the ship's denizens, such skills come in handy.

. Did you remember your travellers cheques?

Leaving Town Via Ship
---------------------

Many of Arkania's settlements grew around bodies of water.  These waterways
allowed  for  easy passage of goods, and generally offered settlers fertile
land  on which to build their homes.  As sailing vessels evolved from small
two  man  crafts  to  giant merchant ships, Arkania's water towns developed
thriving port industries- fishing, cargo and transportation among others.

These  Harbor  towns generally service ships that travel along the coast to
the  next  settlement.   For  the  most part, the vessels travel to sizable
cities, which generally offer good trade, and within a short range of their
home port.  In the large cities, however, there are often many destinations
as  ships come and go from all areas of Arkania to purchase and sell wares.
Some large ports even offer transportation across the Gulf of Prem.

Whether  your  party  travels across the Gulf or just up the coast, it will
encounter all kinds of sailing vessels from the custom cruiser yacht to the
small,  fisherman's  dingy.   The  smallest  ships are generally capable of
travelling  30  miles per day while the large trading ships can cover up to
120  miles per day.  Often, the speed of a ships travel, not to mention its
direct  route,  is  worth  the  price  of a day spent waiting in town for a
faster ship heading to your destination.

As  you  party  nears such a harbor with plans of seafaring, you'll see its
sign, and, stepping onto the dock, will be offered the Harbour options,

Book  a  Passage:   Is your party interested in a bit of seafaring?  Select
Book  a  Passage  to make your reservations.  Blade will show you a list of
ships  at anchor in the harbor and their destinations; this list changes as
ships  depart  and new ships come in (see the Harbour master for a complete
schedule  of expected ships), so check back if nothing available suits you.
If  you`re  interested in a certain destination thats available, select it,
and  the  ships captain will tell you about his ship and your cost to board
it.   While  he  talks,  listen  carefully - the condition of his ship will
affect  your  party  greatly.   The  expensive  ships  generally travel the
fastest  and  luxurious ships offer your party a more restful (and healing)
trip.   Your  party may prefer to forgo passage on a small leaky skiff even
if  its captain offers you free passage to your destination.  On a longship
for instance your characters are expected to man the oars and wont get much
of  a  a  chance  to  rest  during the voyage.  Other times, when your cash
reserves  are  low, or if your party really, really needs to get somewhere,
any old ship will do.

Looking the current offerings over, you may select the boat of your choice.
Should  you accept the captains offer, he`ll note the departure time before
returning to his ship with your fare.  You may board the ship now or at any
time before it leaves port.  If you have a few hours on your hands, you can
head  into  town.   However,  keep  your  eye  on  the time (click the Time
Tracker),  and  return  before  your ship's set to leave Since you're not a
dignitary,  and  the captain already has your money he will not hesitate to
leave without you.

Harbour  Master's  Office:   For a small gratuity, the Harbour Master has a
world  of  information  for the roaming party.  He'll gladly tell you about
all  ships  leaving  the harbour and even those that are expected (within a
reasonable   time   frame  anyway).   For  parties  travelling  to  obscure
destinations  that  are  serviced rarely, the Harbour Master's knowledge is
essential;  he  might  be  able to tell you of a small skiff leaving in two
days that will, at long last, get you to your destination.

Go  On  Board:   If you've booked a passage on a vessel, select Go On Board
when  you're ready to leave town.  After selecting this option you'll spend
your  time chatting with other shipmates or looking for fish over the sides
of  the ship.  Once you board a ship, you are on board until it reaches its
final destination and have no influence on the ships course.

Leave  Harbour:   If  your  ship hasn't come in, or if it's not going to be
leaving for a while, select Leave Harbour to return to town,

Heading Out On Foot
-------------------

Dust  off  the  backpack  and  put  on  your  best  leather  boots ....your
characters  are  out  for a bit of that heel-to-toe shuffle.  Anywhere your
party  finds a land locked signpost, Arkania offers this type of adventure.
Just  step  up  to  the  signpost to discover where the road or path heads.
Keep  in  mind  that  each  city  typically  has more than one signpost, so
checking around, you`ll find roads to more than one destination

When your party reaches such a signpost, you'll see a screen similar to the
one below:

Description:   Move  the pointer to any area on Arkanias map and click with
the  left mouse button.  You`ll, see a description of the area, its peoples
and  its  climate.   While  your party can't travel to any old location you
click  on(  remember,you're  heading  out  on a specific road to a specific
place),  this feature allows you to see Arkanias geography and demographics
quickly.   Reviewing  this  map  can be very useful in planning your routes
across  Arkania  or  for  the curious adventurer finding out about Arkanias
many  towns and cities.  However sometimes dirt tracks or wilderness routes
will  not  be  so  obvious.   It  may  be  necessary  to check the possible
destinations   by  actually  investigating  a  settlements  journey  points
(signposts) to find these hidden routes.

Travelling  Options:   Click  the  right mouse button to show you the paths
available  from  this  signpost's road.  You will see your current location
highlighted  with  a pulsing blue circle, and the targeted destination will
be  highlighted in red.  If the destination is okay with your party, select
it and you're off.  You may also select "BACK" to return to the town you're
currently in.  If you decide to travel, your party's progress will be shown
on  the map, and will deposit you safely at your destination ...unless your
party  experiences  one  of  the  hazards  of traveling.  These hazards are
collectively  grouped  into  the next sections of the manual, "Adventuring"
and "Combat."

Travelling Time
---------------

Under normal circumstances and decent travelling conditions, your party can
cover about 30 miles per day.  Depending on the season and road conditions,
this  distance  could  be  reduced.   Wilderness  travel  along  hidden and
overgrown  routes  can be tremendously difficult, decreasing your maxinmunm
travelling distance to approximately 15 miles per day.

ADVENTURING
-----------

In  a  world  filled with creatures of untamed decorum, things such as easy
trips  and  experience  for  the  asking aren't the norm.  While your party
travels  from  one  point  to  another,  it may encounter certain problems.
Perhaps it's a bandit demanding all the party's ducats.  Yet, it could be a
kindly  old sage, wounded by an Orc attack.  Will you spare all your astral
points  to  heal  him?  And if you do, will he leave you coins in thanks or
will  he crisp you and your companions once he's restored?  These, and many
other questions, face any party out on Arkanias wilds.

Hunger & Thirst
---------------

The  most  common  problems of adventuring are hunger and thirst.  While on
the  trail,  your  characters use energy, and naturally, they need food and
water  to continue their pace.  When your characters are hungry or thirsty,
Blade will let you know.  Although the computer's CPU will not Cowl, you'll
see  a  message  telling you that your characters are in need of nutrition.
Just  click the right mouse button to stop their progress.  Soon, you'll be
at  the  Camp options (covered later in this section) While in camp, review
your characters, fill their bellies and quench their thirst.  If you're out
of  rations  and your skins are dry, try your hand at Replenishing Supplies
(also  covered in the Camp options later in this section) Should you choose
to  ignore  your  characters' hunger and thirst, starvation and dehydration
are virtually inevitable.

Elements
--------

Your  warrior's  limbs  will  barely  move, and your elfs ears have a light
coating  of  frost  on  them.   Welcome  to  the elements.  When your party
travels  through  snow or the scorching heat of summer, the weather affects
them  and  their rate of travel Crossing through the woods in the height of
winter  dressed  in  your Summer gear might cause frostbite, not to mention
the  extra  effort  required  to traverse severn foot high snowbanks.  Make
sure  that your party is appropriately equipped for the weather they may be
traveling  through.   While  traveling  through  such  extremes  check your
characters  often to be certain they're not overly exposed to the elements.
Right click to stop traveling and make Camp, covered later in this section.

Terrain
-------

Walking through (one of Arkania's many fjords, your Magician suddenly drops
from  sight  leaving  only  a  wafting  'Yelp!   ,, and a sliding footprint
behind.   Arkanias crash course in " An Up Close Look at Geography" can hit
your  party  at  any  time  during their adventure.  Whether it be a gaping
cliff  that  your  party  failed to discover in all their merry making or a
simple  step  that triggers an avalanche of snow, such geographic disasters
are not uncommon.  When your party experiences such an event, there will be
a  report  on  the  damage.  Of course your party can defend itself against
such  happenings by appointing a nature lover to head the party.  He or she
is  more  likely  to  notice  such  things, given their appreciation or and
understanding of the out of doors.

A Good Place To Rest
--------------------

Occasionally,  your  characters  will  notice  a  particularly  comfortable
looking  resting  place.   Its grass is mossy green, prodding a comfortable
ground  to  recline  on.  A brook trickles past, and the tracks of watering
game  haunt  its  sides.   You  may decide to set camnp, ending the journey
earlier than planned.  While the party won`t cover the maximum distance for
the  day,  they may rest more easily, enjoy more of its benefits, and awake
the  next morning full of energy, And, if the game is as good as the tracks
hinted, they may well leave with full bellies and packs.

Forced March
------------

Sometimes,  a  tempting camping spot may not be enough to get your party to
stop.   You  know  you can reach your destination before nightfall.  You're
fairly  certain  you  can make it, and so decide on a forced march, keeping
your  party  moving  longer than it nornmaly would.  Just right click while
travelling  on  the Journey Map and select "Force March", to push your pary
on.   Keep  in  mind, however, that there are no guarantees your party will
reach  its  destination  before nightfall or before everyone is tripping on
everyone else from sheer exhaustion.  Camping will then be necessary.  Your
party,  tired from the day's efforts, will likely require more sleep than a
simple  night's rest can offer, and won't be able to exert the extra energy
two nights in a row.

Scouting
--------

As  your  party travels along, the lead character keeps a careful watch for
any  interesting features ...  a neat trove of herbs, a collection of karen
tracks  or  perhaps your party heard a rumour in town about a wild magician
who  roams  these  parts.  Should your character notice anything out of the
ordinary  that  might help your party, or if rumours begin turning to fact,
you will be warned.

Camping On Route
----------------

As  nightfalls,  so  to  do your characters' eyelids, 'Round about 8:OO p.m
your  advanturers  will  make camp for the night.  Although they may not be
tired hungry or otherwise in need of rest, they do know well the dangers of
traversing  Arkania in the dark, and so, being intelligent characters, they
make  camp  for  the  night  automatically at 8:OOp m.  Characters may also
"force"  a Camp at any time mid-route, should they need to gather supplies,
heal  a wounded comrade or dazzle off a magic spell or two to force a Camp,
click  the right mouse button.  When your party forces a camp or settles in
at  8:OOp.m., the marshmallows come out and campfire chatter begins.  While
here, your characters may perform various activities

Set  Guard Duty:  While your characters sleep, who knows what creatures may
creep  out of the forest and into your sleeping bag.  To protect your party
from  ambushes,  rogues  and  other  creatures of the night, Set Guard Duty
before going to sleep for the evening.  When you select this option, select
a  character to stand guard for each of three shifts.  Characters with high
danger  sense  and  intuition make the best guards, but be certain they get
their fair share of sleep, too.  Characters who stand guard cannot do other
activities  like  hunting,  so  you might want to take care of other duties
before setting guards and going off to sleep.

Replenish Stocks:  As your party travels through Arkania's outback they may
use their rations and drain their waterskins dry.  Whenever your characters
make  camp  and  you're  running  low  on  supplies, its a good idea to try
replenishing  your  stores.   Select Replenish Stocks and a character to do
the  hunting,  Generally,  characters skilled in nature and perception have
the  best  chance of success, Keep in mind though, that you can captain two
expeditions in a night, and each character may hunt only once.  If all goes
well,  though,  Blade  will tell you about the grub you found; the food and
water  will  be used immediately or stored for future use, depending on the
needs  of the team.  On the other hand should your attempt fail you're free
to try again, one more time, with another character.

Use  Skill:   Leaning  heavily  against  a  tree, your hunter slowly lowers
himself to the ground, He is wounded, no doubt, and your healer goes to his
side.  Selecting Use Skill, the healer can do wonders:  Treat Wounds, Treat
Disease  or  Treat  Poison.  Select a skill to perform, and if necessary, a
person  to  perform  it on.  Depending on the skill level of the character,
life  points  may  be restored to the wounded, or the poisoned and diseased
may  be  cured.   Characters  wishing  to spend their time brewing magic or
healing  petions  may  opt  to  use  the  Alchemy skill To mix potions, the
character must have:

       An Alchemy set .       All necessary containers
       All necessary herbs    An appropriate recipe

Needless  to  say, a solid skill in Herb Lore and Alchemy helps.  When your
character  mixes  his  brew,  you  will know the outcome Regrettably if the
alchemist  puts  together  a  brew that melts the very jars in which it was
concocted,  he  or  she  will fail the attempt, and all the ingredients and
containers used in the mix will be lost (after all, who wants a potion that
doesn't work or a flask with residue of eau de la attempt on it?)
 
Use  Magic:   Magicians  just aren`t known for laying back during leisure
times  to  gossip.   They are, by the by, not interested in Ian the Brave`s
hacking  of  an  Orc  or Sir Shaun of Crispy's escapades in one of Arkanias
taverns.   Instead,  Magicians  use  the  quiet  of  camp to meditate or to
empower  their  mighty wands.  When you select Use Magic, characters may do
just that.

Meditate:   Generally  reserved  for  Magicians  of  either  sex meditation
focuses a character's energy on his or her magic power so dramatically that
it drains the character physically Doing so, he or she converts life points
(LP) to astral points (AP), Other magic using Archetypes who carry at least
one dose of thonnys in their packs may meditate as well.

Wand Spell:  Available only to Magicians or Magiciennes, this option allows
the magic user to attempt a transfer of some of his or her astral points to
a magical wand.  Cloaked in darkness the Magician spends hours focusing his
mind,  his  magic  and  his energy over the wand until it accepts the spell
itself  Taking  a  lot  of  time, the transfer of energy also consumes many
astral points, but is permanent once charged.  Should your character choose
to  cast  a wand spell, regardless of success or failure, he or she will be
unable  to perform any magic for the remainder of the camp.  (For the exact
method of transfer, refer to the Arcane Lore section of this manual)

Cast  Spell:   During camp, characters may require healing, or other spells
that  may  give  your party an advantage on the elements.  To cast a spell,
select this option, a magically talented character, the spell group and the
spell itself.  (For further information on spells, refer to the Arcane Lore
section of this manual.)
 
Gather  Herbs  :  Used in every alchemist's potion, herbs are a source of
magical  power  for  the  party  and  are  plentiful  in Arkania's forests.
Selecting  this  option,  you`ll choose a character for the search and send
them  off  for  a  time.  While a character's success depends upon the area
searched  those skilled in herb lore and perception find herbs more quickly
and  are  generally  better  at  identifying  herbs  than their less gifted
companions.   When  the  character  returns,  you'll  be told of his or her
discoveries.

Sleep:   Ah.  Rolling back their bedrolls your characters settle in for the
night  to  awaken at 8:00 a.m sharp (those medieval alarm clocks, you could
count  on  them).   Before  opting  to  Sleep, complete all your other camp
business  healing,  meditation,  setting  guard,  etc.   As your characters
sleep,  they  replenish both astral and life points.  But, then again, they
may not sleep so well.  (See Combat for more information in attacks against
sleeping parties.)

ARKANIAS RESIDENTS
------------------

The  residents  of  Arkania  possess much information that may be useful to
your  party.   Sometimes  they  can be persuaded to send a few titbits your
way,  that  is of course, if you strike the right note with them.  Some may
prefer flowery small talk while others would rather get to the point.

Talking With NPCs
-----------------

When  conversing  with  Arkania's  residents,  you  will  be presented with
several  possible  statements  that  your  party  may  make.  Often,you may
progress through several rounds of statements before the two of you reach a
mutual accord.

Travelling With NPCs
--------------------

Non-player  characaters  may be convinced that joining your party is a good
idea  in  much the same way.  Get on their good side, and they'll put their
lives  at  stake  for  you  and  your  party.  Annoy them, and well .  .  .
you'll likely find yourself at the end of their blade.

When  you  meet  an  NPC  who's inclined to join your party, he or she will
offer their services Just like your own characters, you may review the NPC`
study  his or her skills and swap items if you like.  You may not, however,
control the NPCs in combat.

Just  as they freely joined your party, NPCs may leave.  It could be you'll
wake  up  one  morning  to discover the NPC has left ...  leaving only fond
memories

COMBAT
------

On  their journeys through the northern reaches of Arkania, your characters
will  meet  more  than  friendly  fellow travellers.  Brigands, robbers and
starving  wolf  packs  will  conspire  to  deprive  them of their cash, and
possibly  their  lives.  Occasionally, your characters will be passing time
against  their bedrolls, when they are summarily ripped out from under them
(no  doubt  an  embarrassing  event  for  some characters).  When action is
required  and  the  time for polite diplomacy has passed, their Weapons are
forced  to  speak  -  so  begins combat.  For the hack- slasher this is the
ultimate event and sport.

Whos On First?
-------------

Combat  moves forward in rounds - allowing each member of each group, yours
and your opponents, a manoeuvre, whether it be a spell, a thrust of a sword
or  a  parry.   When  your  party and a group of monsters square off, Blade
determines  who  has  initiative  - the first shot.  A character or monster
with  "initiative" is allowed to attack (or move first, and initiative goes
down  the  line until the last character or monster has made a move.  Blade
determines who has initiative by checking out several factors:
 
. Were the characters or the monsters surprised! Surprised combatants
  are usually re-attaching their dropped jaw when the first blade strikes.

. How corageous (CR) are your characters in comparison to their foes!
  Courageous characters leap to the call danger, and have no fear of
  encountering a dangerous beast. Characters who are nor so coura-
  geous, however, tend to hang in the background, anxious that they'll
  break a nail.

. Every character and monster is allowed to act once per combat round.
  He or she may attempt more than one action, but they must all be
  performed back to back, without any other character acting in be-
  tween.

. Your character also automatically parries once per round. Things can
  get hairy, however, if two monsters are attacking your character ... and
  he or she can defend against only one.

. A few monsters of extreme stature can attack more than once per
  round, but they cannot parry more than once.

Ouch. Quit It
-------------

The  sword  swings, cuts your shirt in half, slices through both braces and
leaves a crimson trail across your body.  As your pants fall to the ground,
you discover youve been hit ...  a common occurance in Arkania.

When  a monster attacks a character it may land a successful hit (hopefully
your character will block it, though), and it may cause damage.  Naturally,
a  giant  Ogre  fighting with a club the size of a car is going to do a lot
more  damage  than  a  measly  dwarf  with  a  walking  stick.  If a hit is
successful,  though,  it  may  do  from 1 to 20 points of damage.  However,
depending on the armor worn, the actual amount of damage done may be lower.
Any  damage  taken by the character is removed from his or her life points.
If  his  or  her life points reach 5 or lower, the character will slip into
unconsciousness  and  become  a ridiculously easy target sometimes, though,
the  Opponent  may just leave your character for dead.  If life points fall
to zero, the character will die.

Making Your Move
----------------

Before  the  combat begins or its options are shown, a character's movement
points (MP) are determined.  Since movement takes time, and a rapid transit
system  is  not  yet  available  in Arkania, there is a limit to how much a
character  can do Each characrer may move up to eight squares in the combat
area during each round of combat.  Some characters may have less than eight
points  if  they  are encumbered, however it's a tad hard to zip across the
ground when you`re wearing 300 pounds of armour

Entering The Combat Screen
--------------------------

Movement  points are used for both movement, like stepping to the side, and
for  actions.   Each  action  you  take, whether it be to move your feet to
approach  a  monster  or  to  lift  your arms to fire a bow takes time, and
requires  a  certain  amount of points.  Throughout the combat, Blade tells
you,  the  MP  cost  of  certain  actions  while displaying the character's
remaining points

As the peaceful night passes, your characters suddenly find themselves face
to  face  with  creatures  whose  idea  of  a  good time is slam dancing to
Lawrence  Welk  music.   When your party enters combat, you'll see a screen
similar to the one below

The  Combat  screen  is made of many different parts that combine to show a
realistic view of the action.

Active  Character:  Blade shows you who's currently selecting or acting out
a  particular  move.   In this case, it's Foots who's ready to perform some
action.   However,  it  could  a  monster.  Blade allows everyone a chance,
according  to  their  initiative.   Sleeping  characters however, haven't a
chance  until  they  wake.   The  active  character stands in a highlighted
square.

Inactive  Characters:  Aside from the character currently taking his or her
turn,  all  other characters are inactive and are waiting for their turn to
take  a course.  These characters may be potential targets for a knife or a
spell,  or  they  may  be  party members you'll need to protect.  They will
automatically  parry  the  first  attack  against them, but, since they can
parry  only  once per round, they become sitting ducks afterwards (so don't
let them get surrounded)

Active  Character  Options:   As  each  character  takes his or her turn in
combat, Realms offers combat options to select from.

Active  Character  Position:   The active character stands in a highlighted
square

Combat  Area:   Blades'  combat area is representative of the terrain where
the  encounter  occurred  it  is laid out in a grid, allowing characters to
move  north,  south,  east  or west.  Characters may not move diagonally At
least  one  side of the combat area will always be open allow party members
and monsters a route of escape.

Targeted  Opponent:   A  picture of the targeted opponeint appears when you
have selected it for attack from the combat area

Damage  Inflicted:  Sharing the same space as Targeted Opponent, the damage

The Combat Options
------------------

As  your  party  prepares  to  face  off  against its foes, your magicians,
fighters  and  cutthroats  contemplate  their potential actions.  Will they
fight  the  creatures  before them?  Perhaps your warriors will move into a
better position.  Your magicienne on the other hand, prepares to unleash an
awesome blast of fire.

As your characters move through combat, each of your characters are offered
these choices and more.  Next to each combat option, Blade lists the amount
of movement points that are required to complete the action.

Move
----

The  monster's just out of reach, but dangerously close to your Warlock who
appears to be down for the count.  To get your Warrior's blade within range
of  the  creature's  body, select Move.  Unless encumbered, a character may
move up to eight squares per combat round.  Should you move your character,
keep the following things in mind:

. A character can only move forward, back, to the left or to the right, with
a cost of 1 MP per square entered.

. A character cannot pass through squares already occupied.

. Squares containing walls or certain objects cannot be entered. It's a bit
tough to pass through solid rock.

. Squares containing dead or unconscious characters or opponents can
he entered

. If a character crosses the edge of the combat area, Blade will ask you 
if the character is trying to flee. If you answer yes, the character is out
of the fight for good. This can split your team.

Attack
------

The  Attack  option  engages your characters in the art of physical combat.
To  attack  a  creature, a character must be standing in a square adjoining
the  creature's  square.  The only exception to this is for missile weapons
which  may  be  fired from up to ten squares away at a creature in a direct
line  with  no  obstructions.  When you, select attack, the character pulls
out his or her weapon and physically attacks the creature.

Any  form  of  attack  costs  three  movement  points.   It  also  ends the
characters  actions  for  the  present  combat  round,  no  matter how many
movement points or she may have left.

An attack takes place in one of three modes:

. Aggressive: An aggressive attack takes the character's full concen
tration. Since characters are entirely consumed with their targets they
may not he able to parry a counter attack aimed at them. However, the
attack's momentum will be great and will have a better chance of 
success

. Careful: A careful attack takes all the character's concentration, but
devotes most of it to protection, bettering the chances of successfully
parrying a counter attack. Since the character is concentrating on his
or her own safty as well as the monster, the momentum of the strike
is reduced

Normal: A normal attack gives equal consideration to attack and parry.

Characters  may  also  perform  a missile or throwing attack.  This type of
attack  allows characters to hurl or fire a missile at an opponent up to 10
squares  away.   The  character  must have the missile weapon in his or her
right  hand  and any necessary missiles in the left hand, and must have the
target  in  the line of sight, unblocked by high obstacles or other persons
("You  idiot,  says  the  character  with  an arrow in his arm "Last time I
checked, I did not look like an Orc ")

Guard
-----

Standing  their  ground, a character prepares to attack anything that moves
into  range  adjacent  to  their  square.   Like a careful mode attack, the
character's  parry  is strenthened when he or she opts to guard (after all,
they're standing ground zero with that blood lust in their eyes).  Securing
an  area  costs  three movement points and ends the character's actions for
the present combat round, no matter how many movenment points ,may be left.

Cast Spell
----------

Raising  his hands, your magic user sends a divine blue aura heading toward
a  monster  enveloping  him  in magical power.  When your character selects
Cast Spell he or she can do just that.  To cast a spell at an opponent, the
character  must  have a direct, non-diagonal line of sight to the opponent,
unblocked by high obstacles or other persons.  Not all spells are usable in
combat,  and spell ranges vary.  Casting a spell costs five movement points
and  ends  the  character's actions for the present combat round, no matter
how many movement points he or she may have left.

Use Item
--------

A  character  can use any item held in his or her left hand.  During combat
it's a good idea to have an elixir or (other artifact ready and in the left
hand.   Using  an item costs three movement points and ends the character's
actions for the present combat round, no matter how many movement points he
may have left.

Change Weapon
-------------

Thats  a  fine  piece  of  blade you have there.  Who knows where the other
piece  went  to  but  it's  clear  that  if  you  hope to live through this
encounter,  a  new  weapon  is necessary.  Selecting this option, he or she
puts  the  weapon  back  into  the  inventory and equips a different weapon
instead.   This  action costs two movement points.  Actions may continue if
the character has remaining movement

Exchange Item
-------------

Exchange  Item  is the equivalent of Change Weapon for the character's left
hand  and  costs  two  movement points as well.  Characters may continue to
perform so long as they still have movement points.

Check Values
------------

While  in  combat,  Blade  allows you to check out all the important hack &
slash  statistics  of  the active character.  When you select Check Values,
you'll  see his or her current attack value, parry value, armor class, type
of  weapon,  hit points of weapon, life points, and astral points.  You are
also  shown any poison or enchantment affecting the character.  This option
is  particularly  useful if your character seems to he acting strangely, or
if you're concerned for his or her life.

Wait
----

Sometimes,  doing  nothing  is better .....  waiting it out to see what the
opponents  is  going  to  do.   Select  Wait  to do so, and the character's
actions are ended for the present round of combat.

Repeat Options
--------------

Offered after a round of combat has passed, Repeat Options tells Blade that
you  want  a  character  to  perform  exactly the same actions he performed
during the previous combat round

Computer Fight
--------------

If  you  prefer  to  have Blade control all the intricacies of combat, just
select  Computer  Fight with or without magic.  Then, you can lean back and
watch  the  action  develop.  A computer fight can be especially handy once
you  have  strategically  placed  your  characters or if you've pretty much
trampled  your  opponnents.  You can take the lead again at any time during
combat by simply pressing the left mouse button or any key.  As soon as one
of  your  characters  becomes  active,  you will have all options available
again.

Quit & Reload
-------------

"Oh,  oh,"  you  think  "The  chances  of me surviving this fight are nil."
Should  you come to this conclusion, select Quit and Reload.  The programme
ends your game, and loads it again from any save game you select.

OOOPPPS! The Fumble
-------------------

During  combat,  there's  always  a  chance  of a fumble, resulting in some
serious  consequences  for  the  character  or monster involved.  When your
character juggles his weapon, there are three possible results:

. The fumbling combatant is struck for 1 to 6 hitpoints by his or her own
  weapon

. The fumbling combatant's opponent gets a free strike.

. The fumbling combatant's weapon breaks

After The Fight
---------------

When  all  is  said  and  done, your party wipes their brows of the heat of
combat, and prepares to continue with their adventure.  Before they move on
their  way,  however,  they'll  have a chance to do various things and will
receive others.

Gathering The Goodies
---------------------

If  your Party won the fight, you are shown any loot lying about the combat
area  including  all  weapons  and  items your opponents were carrying.  If
there  is  any  loot  available,  you will be asked to select the items you
want.   Just  choose  any item, and its deposited into your party's bunker.
When  you've  taken  all  the  goodies you want, press the right hand mouse
button or ESC to return to normal game mode.

Getting Extra Experience
-------------------------

When  your  party wins an encounter with monsters, all surviving characters
recieve experience points for their efforts.  The first time they encounter
a  particular  monster, however, they will receive extra points for braving
unknown forces

Returning To Adventure
----------------------

Everyone  looks around The Rogue checks out the Magicienne; she looks back.
The  Warlock  nods to the Warrior in appreciation of his efforts.  And then
the Silven Elf grows concerned.  Someone is missing.

So  it happens when your party returns to adventure and gets their bearings
about  them  following  combat,  characters may find themselves in numerous
positions:

. The team was split when one or more characters ran from the
  encounter. Bring them back together and reunite them as one team.

. One or more characters were wounded or poisoned. Have someone use
  Treat Wounds or Treat Poison on them. This reduces the danger of
  subsequent damage. In case of a fast-acting poison, you will need the
  spell Pure And Clear

. One or more characters have died. Try to leave the scene of combat
  as fast as possible and go look for a temple to pray for a resurrection.

A  well  honed  blade  is  not the only way to face the powers of a fantasy
world  like Arkania.  A well crafted magic spell can work miracles as well.
Your  team  can  use  the  arcane powers of the cosmos for their benefit or
another's demise.

Casting Spells
--------------

Your  characters  may cast spells almost anytime and nearly everywhere.  In
combat,  characters  simply choose Cast Spell.  Clicking the Use Magic icon
while  adventuring  will  provide  the same enchantment.  Remember, though,
that  a  character  can  only  cast a spell if his or her spell value is at
least -5 and preferably better than that.

Blade  allows  you  to  cast  any spell you choose.  Perhaps your eccentric
Warlock  likes  to  throw off little sparklers just to impress the Witch in
the  group.  Whatever the case, your characters have the opportunity to use
nearly any spell they please

While  in  Combat,  though,  characters  have  the option to cast a limited
amount  of  spells.   As  all  combat actions are by necessity spontaneous,
characters  can  only  use spells that require little or no time to prepare
and cast in a fight.

Your  magic using characters learn a variety of different spells, according
to their Archetype.  Spells are grouped by Arcane Lore, the ancient magical
beliefs which formed them and guided their schools of thought.

Every spell in Arkania has an origin ....  a group that long ago sought the
knowledge  of  the  gods  to produce a divine effect.  In this list, you`ll
learn about spells, their and origins.

Magicians  /  Magiciennes,  Elves, Warlocks / Witches and Druid/ Druidesses
know  a  tremendous  amount  of spells grouped into various areas of magic.
The  following  list  contains  all  spells  included in this game with the
attribute  checks  involved The letter in the Lore column gives the spell's
origin:

M ..... Magician/Magicienne
E ..... Elf
D ..... Druid/Druidess
W . ... Warlock/Witch

Although  any  character  may  learn  and  cast almost any spell, the sheer
number of spells available encourages characters to specialize.

Wand Spells
-----------

These  powerful  rituals  allow  a Magician to "charge" a wand with certain
spells.   Although  the  effort takes immense amounts of astral points, the
charge  is  permanant.   It's assumed that an appropriately charged wand is
used  automati- cally if the situation calls for it.  Further, the wand may
hold more than one spell at a time.

There are four different rituals, or charges, that wands may hold:

#1 Makes a magic wand unbreakable and prepares it to be
   charged with further spells. Any Magician / Magicienne starts
   the game with a wand already containing this charge

#2 After successful completion of this ritual (at a cost of 23 astral
   points) the wand can be used at any time as an undousable
   torch. Blade assumes any Magician with charge #2 uses it
   automatically in dungeons and caves, so no other characters
   need carry a light.

#3 This allows the caster to turn his wand into a rope 1O paces long
   whenever he or she wants to. The rope will attach itself to any
   protruding rock ledge, hook etc when thrown. The ritual has
   a cost of 19 astral points. Blade assumes any Magician with
   charge #3 will automatically use the wand as a rope when in
   an appropriate situation, like climbing for example.

#4 This ritual allows the Magician / Magicienne to cast any spell
   at a cost reduced by 2 AP (minimum cost for any spell: 1 AP).
   This ritual costs 27 astral points.

Arcane Lore: Magicians
----------------------

House Spells
------------

Every  Magician  or  Magicienne  must  decide  which  Arcane Lore he or she
favors,  be  it  demonology,  transformation  or  another.   Based  on this
specialization, he or she gains a "bonus" with certain spell values.  These
spells  are called "house spells" and their value can be increased by up to
three  points  each  when  the  character  reaches  a new experience level.
Magicians  or  Magiciennes may specialize in only one Arcane Lore grouping,
and  will  receive  the  spell  value  bonus  for  that group only.  In the
following  list, you'll see the list of house spells for the various arcane
lores.  Across from each spell, the starting bonus is listed....

the sort.

Special Training
Nature, Social, Body, Missile Weapons

Natural

Of  all  the  elven  folk  in Arkania, the Green Elves have had the closest
contact  with  humans.   They  are  not adverse to sitting 'round campfires
discussing a days events and are occasionally spotted in Thorwal's taverns.
While  slight  of  stature,  Green  Elves possess a great deal of magic and

Very  few  members  of  the  Ice  family  have ventured beyond their native
grounds,  and they are seldom seen in southern areas of Arkania.  They seem
to  possess  an almost unknown magical sense, and their spells often puzzle

their remarkable endurance, and keen sense of perception.  They're also not
too shabby when it comes to using missile weapons.

understanding of the magical elements

APPENDIX B: SKILLS
------------------

All  Arkanian  characters need certain skills to survive in their sometimes
friendly,  often  times hostile, environment.  These skills are broken down
into  seven  groups  which  all  Archetypes  have  the  ability to develep:
Combat, Body, Social, Nature, Lore, Craftsmanship and Intuition

Skills  range from -20 to a +18.  Those on the lower end of the scale would
have  trouble  pickpocketing  an  empty pair of trousers while those on the
high  side could steal money from a man counting it.  Some skills, too, are
harder to increase than others

When  your  characters  attempt  to  perform  certain actions.  The Program
checks  the  action  against  your character's skill level to determine the
action's  success.  A highly skilled character (+18) will likely perform an
action  with  ease  His  inept  companion (-20) will likely fail.  However,
regardless  of  a character's proficiency in a skill, he or she may attempt
to use it.

Combat Skills
-------------

A  characters  Combat  skills  determine  how well he or she holds up, both
offensively  and  defensively,  against  foes.   These  values  are used to
calculate  a  characters  attack (AT) and parry (PA) values.  On reaching a
new level, Combat skills can be raised by 1 point

UNARMED:   This  skill  encompasses boxing, wrestling and kicking.  It is a
skill to fall back on in case the characteres weapon breaks

CUTTING  WEAPONS:   This  skill  governs  the  use of all weapons used in a
striking  fashion  which  includes  the  majority  of  edged weapons (sabre
cutlasse  etc),  and  also  some blunt weapons such as the mace and morning
star

POINTED WEAPONS:  Epee, rapier and foil, as well as all knives and daggers,
are included in this category

SWORDS:   Swords are used as striking weapons, but can be used to pierce as
well.  They are handled easily and are readily available

AXES:   Axes and hatchets are favored weapons of the northern Arkanians and
are  easy  to  find.  Axes, like the orc hook or the barbarian war axe do a
lot of damage, but require a lot of skill to handle

POLE  ARMS:  This skill is used not only for spears and pole arms, but also
for quarterstaves and double fleurs.

TWO-HANDED  SWORDS:   This  skill governs all two-handed swords such as the
tuzakian  or the rondracomb.  Normally, only warriors learn to handle these
awkward weapons.

MISSILE  WEAPONS:  The most common types of missile weapons are the various
types of bows and the crossbow.

THROWING  WEAPONS:  Throwing weapons include all javelins, throwing knives,
throwing stars, and throwing hatchets such as the francesca

Body Skills
-----------

Body  skills  are  used  to regulate all athletic actions such as climbing,
hiding  or riding.  For a character to succeed in an action that requires a
Body  skill, good values for strength and agility are a must.  Depending on
the  skill, other attributes may play a part in an actions success as well.
These  statistics  are  listed  in  parentheses following the skill's name.
When  characters  gain an experience level, Body skills may be increased by
up to 2 points.

ACROBATICS  (CR/AG/ST):   Somersaults  and  cartwheels  are a useful way of
earning  money  by  performing  for  an  audience.   Acrobatic reactions to
unexpected situations rely more on Physical Control skill.

CLIMB  (CR/AG/ST):   Climbing  is always risky, especially at great heights
where  the smallest slip can have grave consequences.  Alone with the skill
level,  success  also  depends  on  whether  the  character  is  using  any
specialized equipment.

PHYSICAL  CONTROL (CR/IN/AG):  A successful check against this skill allows
a  character  to reduce the consequences of a fall, to escape an opponent's
grip or to squeeze through a narrow crack

RIDE  (CH/AG/ST):   This  is  the  ability to ride horse back during daring
maneuvers without falling flat on one's face

STEALTH  (CR/IN/AG):  The ability to move without a sound.  The probability
of  success  also  depends on the ground walked on and on the type of armor
worn.  Little clangs, jingling and creaking, and the crunch of dried leaves
underfoot have a tendency to alert a potential target.

SWIM  (CR/AG/ST):  Determines how long a character can keep his or her head
above water.  Any kind of armor is a large hindrance to the swimmer.

SELF  CONTROL  (CR/ST/ST):   The ability to take damage without letting the
pain  get the better of you.  With a high self control, characters feel the
wound-note  its presence -but do not react to it, allowing them to continue
an action with accuracy and skill.

DANCE  (CH/AG/AG):   Like  Acrobatics,  Dancing  offers  many  a crown to a
sufficiently skilled dancer performing for an appreciative audience.

HIDE (CR/IN/AG):  The ability to find a hiding place quickly and quietly

CAROUSE  (WD/IN/ST):   The  ability to hold oneself in check while visiting
taverns.   It  affects  the amount of beer, brandy and wine a character can
drink before he or she becomes intoxicated

Social Skills
-------------

Social  skills  help  (or  hinder) characters in the social situations they
encounter  in  towns  and  cities.   Attributes  in  parentheses affect the
skill's  chances  of  success.   Social skills aren't much use in the wild,
unless you encounter a particularly talkative rabbit.  When characters gain
a level, Social skills may be increased by up to 2 points

CONVERT (WD/IN/CH):  The ability to convince others that your point of view
is  the  correct  one,  especially  in  regard to religious matters.  ("No,

non-player characters in your party

EVALUATE  (WD/IN/IN):   This  skill helps characters to your party estimate
the value of artifacts and other useful items.

characters to feel at home with the land, and are generally used whenever a
party  ventures  outside  of  town.   Following  each  skill's name are the
attributes  that  influence  a  characters  success.   When characters gain
levels, these skills may be increased by up to 2 points.

TRACK  (WD/IN/AG):   This skill is used to find animal tracks and judge the
species that left them (wild pig, karen maybe a human?)

also the ability to correctly identify and prepare them.

ANIMAL  LORE  (CR/WD/IN):   Knowledge of animals is especially important in

difference between life and death.

setting up camp, a source of water or rich hunting grounds.

Lore Skills
-----------

Almost  all  knowledge  can  be covered by a Lore skill, and in many cases,
Lore  skills  define a character's art.  Attributes that affect the skill's
performance  follow the skills name.  When characters gain new levels, Lore

situations  or  people with their hands and mind.  All Craftsmanship skills

TREAT   DISEASE   (CR/WD/CH):    TREAT  POISON  (CR/WD/IN):   TREAT  WOUNDS
(WD/CH/DX):   A  number  of  team  members  should be proficient with these
healing  skills,  especially  TREAT  WOUNDS  a very commonly used skill for
adventurers  in  Arkania.   Untreated  Wounds  often  lead to infection and
disease.

INSTRUMENT  (WD/IN/DX):  Using this talent and the appropriate instrument a

right note and the mood of the audience

promise  for  either  silver  crowns  or gold ...  or a pummeling if you're
caught.

Intuitive Skills
----------------

Intuitive  skills  are not trained but improved primarily through practice.
They  are somewhat, the character's sixth sense.  Because of this, they can
only be improved by 1 point when characters gain a level

DANGER  SENSE  (WD/IN/IN)  This  skill  provides a warning to characters of
immediate danger posed, for instance, by an ambush or a trap

PERCEPTION  (WD/IN/IN) This skill allows you to notice hidden signs, secret
doors, movement on the horizon or sounds behind a locked door.

APPENDIX C: ARKANIAS DEITIES
----------------------------

An  ancient world like Arkania would not be complete without a multitude of
deities.   The  most important among these are the Twelve Gods the pantheon
worshiped  by the vast majority of Arkanians.  There is also another god, a
shadowy  creature  who  inspires  such fear in Arkania's residents that his
name is never spoken and has all but been forgotten.  Only in passing is he
referred to as the God Without A Name

Characters  "meet"  the  individual  divine  providences  when visiting the
temples found in nearly every settlement.  Entering temples, characters may
make  offerings  to  the  deities  out  of  reverence and in hopes that the
temple's cleric, and perhaps even the god, will smile on them.  Needless to
say, the higher the donation the larger the smile it tends to bring.  While
in  temples, characters may also ask for miracles from the deities.  As you
might  expect, however, miracles are a relatively rare occurance and do not
happen  with predictable ease.  Of course miracles, like wishes, might come
true, so be careful what it is you ask for.

The Twelve Major Deities
------------------------

PRAIOS

Empire, the largest Arkanian state.  He favors courage and truth, and shows

deserts He is considered moody and unpredictable.

TRAVIA

servants  are  forbidden  to  take  any life, and she herself occassionally

mercy  and  love  for  all  living creatures.  Clerics of peraine provide a
large and rather divine influence on Arkania healers

giant whale

IFIRN

been  built  for  her  in  hopes  that it will increase the likelihood of a
response from Firun.

THE NAMELESS GOD
Very  little is known about this creature Your characters will not find him
or  his clerics in any temple, but they might come across these servants of
the dark somewhere along the way.

APPENDIX D: HERBS & POISONS
---------------------------

Travelling  through Arkanias wilds, your characters will likely come across
a  vast  array  of  herbs  that may prove useful in their adventures.  Some
herbs  can  be  used  without any prior preparation, while others require a
skilled and knowledgeable character before their use becomes apparent.

Herbs can be purchased from Arkania's many herbalists.  Your party may also
find  herbs  throughout  Arkania's wild.  Natutally, a character skilled in
Herb  Lore will have a much better chance to find herbs.  Extremely skilled
characters  may even be able to gather extra herbs as a means to make money
for  the party, selling his or her reserves to one of Arkania's herbalists.
And  for those unlucky enough to have no party member skilled in Herb Lore,
ready made potions are available at Arkania's better herbalists.

Mixed  together with recipe in hand, these herbs can form wonderous healing
agents  and  deadly poisons.  Without a recipe, however, your character may
end  up  making  "Vaporize Party Immediatly" instead of that helpful elixir
you had in mind

ARAX  :   Concentrated  cave spider poison.  Does only light damage, but re
duces an opponent's combat values

ATMON:   This  hardy  flower,  or rather, the salve made from it, has to be
imported from the Khaorn Desert.  Atmon salve increases all Body skills.

BANE  DUST:  A powerful poison that slowly robs magically gifted characters
of their astral energy

BELMART:  The dark green leaves of the belmart bush can be used to con coct
a prevetative medicine against disease and poisons

BLACK  LOTUS:   The pollen of the black lotus is used in the preparation of
an extremely potent inhaled poison

DONF:   Donf  sprigs are a favoured remedy of Arkanian healers, pre scribed
for  just about any affliction.  They work best against paralysis and swamp
fever, though

FEAR  POISON:   A  magical  poison  of  immediate effect identical to a suc
cessful Horriphobus spell.

FINAGE:   An  infusion made from young finage tree sprigs raises attributes
lowered bv magic or disease to their former value

FOUR  LEAF LONEBERRY:  The berries of this bush are amongst the most common
medicinal  herbs of all Arka nia.  They can be eaten raw or used to prepare
a concoction.  They also figure in many recipes for healing potions.

GOLDEN  GLUE:   This  is an acidic contact poison often found on door knobs
and the opening mechanisms of treasure chests

GULMOND:  The leaves of the gulmond bush, found mostly in the Svellt Valley
to  the  east  of  the Orcish Lands, are famous for increasing strength and
endurance.   The pre ferred way to take gulmond is as a tea, but it is also
possible to chew the fresh leaves.

ILMEN  LEAF:   This  is  a weak halluci nogen imported from the south.  The
leaves  are  usually  smoked  and  their  vapors  are  said  to  calm  even
berserkers.

JORUGA:  This yellow root of about finger length is the only known cure for
rabies and valued accordingly.  In northern Arkania, the joruga root can he
found mostly within Nostria

KAIRAN:   This fern plant only grows under water.  It is extremely rare and
is  collected  mostly  along the shores of Nine Eyes Lake, though it can on
occasion be found in other Lakes and ponds

KUKRIS:   A deadly poison of almost immediate effect.  It is extracted from
a southern clinging root and is ex tremely expensive

MANDRAKE:  This common root often grows in approximate man shape and is the
base  of  many magic potions It can be found mostly in forest areas and wet
grasslands.

MENCHAL:   This  cactus  from the edge of the Arkanian deserts is a po tent
antidote to various poisons.

OLGIN  ROOT:   The  roots  of  the  this moss species build up a resistance
against all kinds of poison and disease.  Unfortunately, olgin root is very
rare and thus extremely expensive

SLEEPING POISON:  A mild, magical poison that makes an opponent fall asleep
immediately.   A strike against the afflicted suffices to wake him (or her)
up again

SHURIN  BULB:   The shurin bulb, which is found in the Orcish Lands and the
area around Thorwal, offers a strong but very slow poison.

TARNELE:  This plant, which is very similar in appearance to dandelion, can
be  found almost anywhere in Ar kania and is one of the most basic supplies
any  healer  carries.  An oint ment made from crushed tarnele leaves speeds
up the nightly regenerarion of life energy

THONNYS:   This  homely herb allows elves, witches and druids to use astral
meditation, a practice normally open only to magicians

WHIRLWEED:   Anything said about the four leaf loneberry applies equally to
whirlweed.   This,  too,  is  in  use  all  over Arkania, but its effect is
stronger than the loneberry's.  It should be present in every well supplied
adventurers back pack.

APPENDIX E: DISEASES
--------------------
 
Disease  and  infection  are no strangers to Arkania.  Anything from a bite
from  an  infected animal to a virulent strain of bacteria can bring anyone
of  a  number of ailments your way.  Characters may suffer many afflictions
from  merely  being  drunk  to  sweating  out a raging bout of Swamp Fever.
Contracting  some  illnesses  may simply be a matter of carelessness others
may  possess  such  ramifications  that a speedy treatment is critical lest
your  entire  party become infected by a particularly contagious condition.
Before  a  condition can be treated, however it must first be diagnosed.  A
character  requires  some  amount of Treat Disease still just to figure out
what the problem is ....  much less do anything about it.  A poorly skilled
character may have difflculty recognizing a common cold.

Certain  diseases  may  require a specific herbal treatment for any healing
efforts  to be effective.  Some may be so serious that trying anything less
than the most skilled healer in Arkania will be a futile waste of effort.


BATTLEFIELD  FEVER:   Ghouls  and undead are the carriers of this insidious
disease  which  is  especially  dangerous for elves.  The infection spreads
rapidly and with serious consequences, made worse by a debilitating loss of
strength  and  life  energy.   The  only  known  treatment  is the combined
application of joruga root and gulmond leaves.

BLUE  COUGH:   Blue  Cough  is only pos sible as a consequence of numskull.
The  patient must be confined to bed to prevent the disease from worsening.
If  this  regimen  is kept up, the disease will likely pass.  It may take a
long  time,  but rest and waiting is the only way to get rid of Blue Cough,
once it develops

FROSTBITE:  There is no real treatment for frostbite.  The best thing to do
is  to  prevent  it  by  wearing  good  shoes and warm clothes.  In extreme
weather  conditions  especially in winter, the characters should avoid long
marches

NUMSKULL:  A character suffering from numskull feels weak and listless, and
also  suffers  some  damage.   The biggest danger connected with a numskull
infection  is  the  possibility to develop Blue Cough.  The usual cause for
numskull  is staying in cold water for too long without drying off properly
and  getting  warmed  up  again afterwards.  Almost any healing herb can be
used to treat numskull.

PARALYSITIS:  This Dangerous disease, which can lead to total paralysis, is
mainly transmitted by undead.  The only chance a character with paralysitis
has of being cured lies in fast treatment and application of Donf sprigs
 
RAIBIES:   Rabies is transmitted by bites of wild animals.  It is a rare,
but  often  deadly  disease.   Also,  there  is the danger of the infectecd
character attacking his or her own companions as he or she is driven mad by
the  pain.   For  treatment,  the patient must stay in bed.  The only known
herb of any effect against rabies is joruga root.

TETANUS:   It  is almost certain that the characters will have to deal with
this dangerous disease some time during their adventures.  Tetanus develops
from  in  fected  wounds  made  by  monster  bites  or rusty weapons if not
treated,  the  infection  can cause the character's death.  The char acters
should  therefore  make  a  habit of cleaning and dressing all wounds after
battle

APPENDIX F: ROLE PLAYING TERMS
------------------------------
 
ARCHETYPE:   As  part  of creating a character, you have to choose an Arche
type  to  conform  to.   An  Archetype  de scribes the basic profession and
physical  makeup  of  your character.  There are twelve Archetypes for your
characters.  See Appendix A for complete information on the Archetypes

ARMOUR  CLASS  (AR):   Armour  is meant to protect its wearer from harm The
armour class is Subtracted from the hit points of a weapon when calculating
dam  age.   Unfortunately, armor also restricts its wearer, possibly to the
point of hardly being able to move.

ASTRAL POINTS (AP):  All kinds of magic are powered by astral energy, which
is  measured in astral points.  The amount of astral points a character has
is  an  indi cation of his or her magical powers.  Magi cians / Magieiennes
start the game with 30 AP, all other magic Archetypes start with 25 AP.  AP
can  be  increased  at  new  levels AP can be regained through sleep, magic
potions or meditation.

ATTACK (AT):  Any combat maneuver designed to harm an opponent.  The attack
value has a range from 0 to 20 points and measures the ability to direct an
attack.

ATTRIBUTES:   A  character's  attributes  present  a  profile of his or her
personality  with  strengths  and weaknesses.  Attribute values can change.
Realms  differentiates  between positive attributes and negative attributes
(Superstition, Acrophobia, Claustrophobia, Avarice, Necrophobia, Curiosity,
and Violent Temper)

BREAKING  FACTOR  (BF):   Arkanian  weapons  are  not made to last forever.
Their  deterioration  is  measured  by  means  of the breaking factor.  The
higher  the  BF,  the  more brittle (and thus the more likely to break) the
weapon.

CHARACTER:   An  inhabitant  of  the  fan  tasy  world  of Arkania.  Player
characters,  also  known  as  heroes,  are part of the adventuring team and
controlled by the player

CHECK  (ATTRIBUTE  CHECK,  SKILL CHECK, SPELL CHECK):  Whenever a character
attempts  an action with no pre determined result, there is the possibility
of  a  check  against  the appropriate at tribute, skill or spell value(s).
These  checks  simulate rolling a varying number of twenty sided dice.  The
attributes  listed with each skill or spell are imporrant to the success of
a  check,  giving  a  character with high values in the listed attributes a
better spell check.

EXPERIENCE  POINTS:   (EP)  Experi  ence  points  (also  known as adventure
points)  are  awarded  for  good  role playing, solving difficult tasks and
overcoming  tough  opponents.  Once a character reaches a certain threshold
of  experience  points  he  or she has reached a new level and can increase
various game values.

HITPOINTS  / DAMAGE POINTS (HP / DP):  Whenever an attack is successful and
the  blow  is  not  parried,  it hits the target for damage.  The amount of
damage  depends  on  the  weapon  used  and is measured in hit points.  Any
protection,  like armor, is subtracted from the hit points leaving only the
actual  damage  penetrating  the  armor.   These  points are ultimately sub
tracted from the wounded's life points.

LEVEL:  The experience a character gath ers is expressed in levels

LIFE POINTS (LP):  The sum of life points determines vitality.  The average
character  starts  the  game  with 30 life points.  Magicians / Magiciennes
possess  25  LP and dwarves 40 LP.  Whenever a char acter is wounded, he or
she loses life points Should the life points be lowered to 5, the character
loses  conscionsness.   He  or she dies if the LP reach 0.  Life points are
increased  on  reaching  a  new level.  LP can be regained through sleep or
healing
 
MAGIC  RESlSTANCE  (MR):   Every  liv  ing  being has a certain chance to
resist  a  spell  directed against it.  With intelligent beings, this magic
resistance  is  influenced  by courage, wisdom, superstition and experience
level

NON - PLAYER CHARACTER (NPC):  Inhabitants of the fantasy world of Arka nia
who  are controlled by the game master (or the computer).  They are used as
chance  encounters,  opponents,  or  acquaintances  who  can  be a valuable
addition to the team, for varying amounts of time

PARRY  (PA):   A  protective combat manoeuvre.  The parry value has a range
from 0 to 20 points and measures the ability to parry an attack.
 
SKILLS:   Skills  add  detail  to  a character's personality profile.  In
contrast  to  his  or  her attributes, skills can be learned and im proved.
They  give a precise indication of a character's abilities.  All skills are
grouped   into  combat,  nature,  body,  social,  lore,  craftsmanship  and
intuition skills, For more information see Appendix B:  Skills.

SPELLS:   Magic  comes  in handy to cure your characters, aid them in their
adven  ture and to vanquish creatures bent on your destruction, Magicians /
Magiciennes,  Elves,  Druids / Druidesses, and Warlocks/ Witches can use up
to  84  different  spells in Realms.  These are grouped into various arcane
lores.   How well a character knows a certain spell is expressed by a spell
value  ranging  from a -20 to a + 18, (For more information, see the Arcane
Lore section of this manual,)

God  bears  none.   The  first  month of the year is Praios.  It is roughly
equivalent to July.  During the winter months of Boron, Hesinde, Firun, and
Tsa,  much of Arkania is covered in snow making travel difficult.  The five
days  between  the 30th of Rahja and the 1st of Praios are called "the days
without a name", and are considered cursed.  Years are generally counted by
the  reign  of  the  emperor  governing the Central Empire.  Another common
counting  method comes from the fall of Bosparan.  At the start of the game
it  is  the  15th  year in the reign of emperor Hal and year 1009 after the
Fall of Bosparan.

CENTRAL  EMPIRE:   An  empire  in the middle of Arkania, covering about one
third of the continent.  At the moment the capital of Gareth is the seat of

largest coin is the gold ducat (D), worth 10 silver crowns (C) - Each crown
is worth 10 copper bits (B).

GARETH:   With  more than 100,000 in habitants, this is the largest city in
Arka  nia.   It  is  also  the  capital  of the Central Empire, the largest
Arkanian  nation  Thor  walians consider all inhabitants of Gareth snobbish
couriers and arrogant fops.

GULF  OF PREM:  A gulf between Thorwal and Prem.  The center of the Thorwal
region,  as  far  as  settlement and ship traffic are concerned.  There are
five  islands situ ated within the gulf, the two biggest being Hjalland and
Runin.

HJALDING  GULF:   A  gulf to the north of the Hjaldor range, protected from
the  open  sea  in  the  west  by  the Overthorn headland and the island of
Manrek.   The coast of the Hjalding Gulf is one of the most important areas
of Thorwalian settle ment, second only to the Gulf the Prem.

HJALIDOR  RANGE:The  Hjaldor  range forms the back of the peninsula between
the Hjalding Gulf and the Gulf of Prem

HJALLAND:   An  island  in  the  Gulf  of Prem.  The only settlement on the

countryside  is  dominated  by  low, bleak hills and a cover of light green
grasses,  with small copses of birch trees here and there.  Along the Bodir
River  Valley  ruins  bear  witness to failed human attempts at settlement.
Rumor  has  it  that  a  number of orcish tribes are assem bling on the Orc
Skull Steppes to march on Thorwal

PHEXCAER:   A  town of 1100 at the banks of the Bodir River, situated smack
in  the  middle  of  the Orcish Lands.  Phexcaer is dedicated to the God of
Thieves and probably harbors more of them than any other town in Arkania.

PREM:  Situated in a coastal valley and almost unconquerable by land.  Prem
is  the  guardian of the gulf named for the town, The 2350 inhahitarnts are
quite  as mixed as the architecture present - here you can find any kind of
building,  from  a  long house raised on stilts to a round tower built from
rocks.   Prem  is famous for the large hall above the town, the Free Combat
School,  and its Premian Brandy, a very high proof concoction also known as

STONY  OAK FOREST:  The Stony Oak Forest marks the southern boundary of the
Orcish Lands.  The giant, gnarly trees grow ing there give the place a dark

again,  as  the  tough wood of these stony oaks is excellent house and ship
building material.

THORWAL:   A region and town on the north western coast of Arkania, between
the Ingval and Gjalska rivers, bordered in the east by the mountains of the
Orcish  Lands.   The  "Home of Dragonships" is considered a rough area, and

famous  for  their  skill as sailors, but at the same time feared for their
combat  skills  and  love  of  fighting.   The  Free  City of Thorwal (6750
inhabitants)  is  the  largest  settlement  of  the region and the pride of
Thorwallians.   This  is a place where men and women drink ale from barrels
and chug brandy from tankards

TWELVE  GODS:   Most  inhabitants  of  Arkania worship a pantheon of twelve
deities  in constant conflict with their op ponent, the God Without A Name.
For more information see Appendix C.

APPENDIX H: CUSTOMER SERVICE
----------------------------

We appreciate your comments ???????????

APPENDIX I: HINTS & TIPS
------------------------

1.   Read  Gerbod's  Diary  -  there's a host of info about life in Arkania
there and some useful tourist tips about places to visit in Thorwal.

2.   When  creating  your  party,  as in most fantasy role - playing games,
strive for balance and diversity.

You  will  want  at least a couple of characters with good fighting skills,
and  a  couple  different  types of magic users to cover a broader range of
spells  Magicians  and  Magiciennes  offer a couple unique abilities making
them  very  desirable  (don't  forget  about  their wands).  Another really
useful character is one that can use missile weapons.  Hunters are the most
obvious  choice, but don't ignore the Elves.  Dwarves provide good fighting
talent (and also tend to bring funds with them when they join your party).

Plan  ahead  so  that  you  have  characters  proficient  in  the key skill
categories  survival  in  wilderness; perception in dungeons, herb lore and
alchemy haggling in shops travel through towns and on ships, just to name a
few.   And  make  sure  the  leader of your party possesses the appropriate
skills for the area you're traveling in

3 The first thing on your agenda should be to gain some experience to build
your characters.  Master Dramosch can really use your help .....

4 Outfit your characters to the best of your ability.  Don't hold back when
buying  armor  and  weapons,  but  do  try  to outfit as many characters as
possible  Try  to  cover as many "body parts" as possible.  (A bullet-proof
vest  is  great  but  your  bare  feet may give the opponent the opening he
needs.)

5  It's  also  a  really  good  idea to focus some attention on potions and
herbs.   Read carefully what Some of the herbs can do, and whether they can
be  eaten  raw  Healing  potions  are  a  virtual  requirement for any well
supplied  adventurer.  If you have them ready in your characters left hand,
they can be used in a instant, even in the thick of battle.

6 Poison and a magician's wand is a marriage made in heaven.

7  When traveling, be brave and try everything.  Take options to try things
when  given the chance to do so.  It may not always work to your favor, but
you  never  know what you may find (you are adventurers after all).  If you
save your game as often as possible, this curiosity may not kill the cat.

8  Explore  the  towns,  even  the "residences" where possible.  If you get
caught  breaking  into people's houses though, you're going to jail (do not
pass Go do not collect 200 pounds

9  Talk  to  people,  get  them  on  your side, and get the inside scoop on
Arkania

10  Plan  out your combat approach.  Where you position your characters can
mean  life  or death.  A useful tactic can be to tie up an opponent in hand
to  hand  combat  with  a  strong  fighting character (Thorwalian, warrior,
Dwarf)  while  you pelt him from afar with a character using missiles.  Try
to  take  the  opponent  out  of the action with a Lightning or Somnigravis
spell which eliminates their ability to attack.
