Time Runners II - The Space Stone - Quick Docs/Hints...Fixed by S0REHEAD!

Here it is Simulmondo's sequel to Time Runners 1. I don't really remember
enjoying the first one much, but here we go with the follow-up release!

The first thing that hit me was that the  install program  was completely
graphical.  It's nice to see this sort of thing because it adds a certain
class to the program.   Unfortunately,  the install program doesn't allow
you to pick which directory to install to.  In this day and age, I expect
that sort of thing from install programs so this really peeved me.

The graphics are Time Runners 2's strong point.   There are nice close up
shots, when you're interacting with other characters.   Plus,  the normal
"walking around"  screens are quite  pleasing to the  eye.   My main beef 
is that the speed is phenomenally slow. I realize that I only have an a500
but we're talking about a fairly common "walk around"  screen.   I would
hit a key and have to hold it for a second or two before  there would be
any results.  Even the character just walking across the screen was painfully
slow.   I'm use to a certain amount of slow down due to my machine speed,
but this is just unacceptable.

In terms of originality, it reminds me a lot of Flashback.<-HAH) The interface
is almost the  same with you  running  around  on the  screen and killing
robots and other mutants.   It even reminds me a bit of Prince of Persia,
but it is just too slow.

The playability is just not there.  I guess if it was on a faster machine
and they included some better sound support, then maybe it would be worth
playing.  In it's current state though, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Time Runners 2 'The Space Stone' Quick Docs

Time Runners 2 takes place in the prehistoric era.  You've just been
captured for trying to steal 'The Space Stone'.  The reason for stealing
the stone was to allow you to travel through time and save the love of
your life. [All this over a girl? :)]  As fate would have it, you were
going after a fake stone and were captured.  So, you start the game in
a holding cell on a space vessel in prehistoric times.  [Don't ask me how
a space ship got into the past!]  Your mission now is to get out of jail
and recover the stone so you can save your girl.

All the commands necessary to play the game can be found in the online
help.  There is a section called VIDEO MANUAL where it explains the game
and all the commands.  Also, if you hit 'h' anytime in the game, it will
give you a list of all the commands.  Here are most of them:

SPACE   Select an arm
P       Pause game
ENTER   Help for the situation you're in
U       Show all exits and actions
M       Map
I       Status and Inventory
H       Help

The movement keys are pretty straight forward.  Just use the arrow
keys and SHIFT to fire.  Again, press 'h' for a complete list of movement
keys.

That's about all you need to play this game.  It's a pretty straight
forward game and doesn't require much explanation.
