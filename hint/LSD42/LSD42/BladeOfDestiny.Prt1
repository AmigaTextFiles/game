WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF ARKANIA

INTRODUCTION
------------

"It  stretches  from  the  rocks  of  Windhag to the coast of Mendena, from
Ifirn's Ice Mountains to the damp woods of the Moha, and true enough, it is
a  strange  land.  It is lovely at times, mild and full of good men, but it
remains  bleak  and  hostile  most of the time, not tolerating any innocent
wanderers.  Of its regions, there are some travelled only by those who know
how  to  wield  a  sword;  others,  still  more  fierce,  welcome  only the
courageous  and  crazy.   Whonever  goes there typically finds, nothing but
death and horrors to freeze the mind.  The forests in Borland too, with the
giant Milzenis amidst, is a place much like that, and so, too is the desert
Khorn,  the land off pagans.  The Lord Praios himself haunts man and animal
there,  and sends the land heat to make every herb wither and all creatures
skinsburn.

To  the  North,  it  is no better.  Praios' grim brother, Firun, covers the
land  with  an icy shield and blows a wind so cold that birds fall from the
skies  dead  and  rigid He who travels this land successfully from north to
south  might  be  pleased  and  wonder  how  he survived.  But we shall not
quarrel  with  the land.  Arkania called, for the Twelve Divines have given
it  to  us  and  surely  they  know  why  they  created  it  as  is and not
differently."

From the book The Healing Herb - How to Find and Prepare
written by the Peraine Devoted
Sister Larissa in Mendena, 80v.11.

Geography of Arkania
--------------------

The  region  of  Arkania  is one of the smaller lands of Ethra, a primitive
world,  and  land which most Arkanians suppose to be flat.  Although in the
past  years the hypothesis arose that Ethra was a sphere, none ever managed
to prove it.  Even today, no Arkanian has succeeded in crossing the world

To  the  east  the  Arkanian  continent  is limited by the "Iron Sword," an
almost  invincible  mountain range that rises to more than 30,000 feet.  To
the  west  is the "Sea of Seven Winds," a treacherous ocean unnavigabile by
Arkania's  meagre  flotilla.   Beyond  this lies a legendary continent, the
"Golden  Land".   Whether  the  world ends at the Golden Land is beyond the
kndowledge of Arkanian geographers

To the north of Arkania - provided it is not covered in ice - are both deep
woods  and  long,  treeless plains.  Settlements are rarely found here, but
those  that  do  remain  belong  to  the  Nivese,  groups of steppe nomads,
following the trail of the huge Karen herds through its plains

To  the  northwest,  there  is Orcland, highlands enclosed by many mountain
ranges  and  aptly  littered  with  numerous Orc tribes.  Relentlessly, the
multiple  tribes  engage  one  another in bloody feuds for hunting grounds,
pastures or servants

Sporadically  the tribes will join together, and, as one massive unit, they
will  force  their  wayv South.  And so it is again ...  as these lines are
written,  the  people of Arkania are witness to another Orcish raid, one of
the  most  horrible  in  recorded history.  The dark furred hordes, full of
blood  lust,  have left unspeakable devasstation in their wake.  But what's
more, they have reached the gates of the imperial city, Gareth.

To  the far west of Orchland is Thorwal, the empire of a race of pugnacious
and  rapacious  seafarers.   With their light, single masted ships, locally
referred  to  as  "ottas,"  the Thorwalians travel the coasts of Arkania in
search  of new goods and traders.  Finding small, unfortified harbours, the
Thorwalians  are  quick  to  raid  yet  the  red haired giants will attempt
trading should they meet with any resistance from the harbour's citizens

Beyond  Arkatnia's  northeastern  corner  is Borland, a densely wooded area
which  like  Arkania's  eastern side, ends abruptly where it meets the Iron
Sword Mountains.  Borland is well-known for its harsh winters and poor, but
hard-  working,  farming  communities  who  make  life sorrowless for their
barons,  counts  and  princes.  Festum, the land's capital and residence of
the noble's marshal is known to be one of the most gorgeous and pleasurable
harbour towns in all Arkania

South  of Borland's forests are the Red and Black Sickle Mountains.  Though
not  as  treacherous or steep as the Iron Sword, the mountains are infested
with  goblins  and  rarely  traveled.  Between the two ranges is the Middle
Reich,  a zone of moderate climate.  Many settlements and clearings dot its
hills  and  a  smattering  of roads connect the communities to one another.
Gareth,  Arkania's  largest  town  with  approximately 120,000 citizens, is
Middle Reich's capital, and serves as the nerve centre of the area.  On the
outskirts  of  the  Middle Reich, dense forests grow and meet with those of
the  Sickle  Mountains.   According  to  the dwellers Dwarves inhabit these
woods, making travel through their realm foolish at best

An  island proivince of the Middle Reich, Maraskan, lies to the east of the
Arkanian  continent  in  the  Sea  of  Pearls and is rich with mountainous,
wooded  beauty.  It is normally a quiet land where conflicts seldom occurs.
The  rest  of  Arkania often makejokes about the status of supplies in this
area,  knowing  full  well  that  nothing  much else is worth the words its
people,  secreted  and  of their own, are now seeking independence from the
powers of the Middle Reich.  Their goal of freedom, some say, is not so far
off.

South  of  the  Middle  Reich lies the desert Khorn, home of the Novadis, a
proud race of desert nomads.  The desert is met by the Etern and High Etern
Mountains  to  its west, slopes which shield the Khorn from the rain clouds
that drift west with the winds toward the "Lovely Field."

A  rich  and fertile land, Lovely Field is bright with the seasons, blooms,
and is home to numerous Arkanian residents, most of which live in Vinsault,
the  capital city.  Other towns in Lovely Field, including Grangor, Kuslik,
Belhanka  and  Sihas,  are  said  to  be  the  most fertile lands in all of
Arkania.   Naturally,  most  of Lovely Field`s residents farm by trade, and
their  settlements  flourish with an abundance of food and grains.  Most of
the  villages  in  Lovely  Field are well fortified to protect their bounty
from  the  endless  raids  drawn by its wealth.  From its eastern side, the
Novadi  tribes  attack  the  province again and again, while the coasts are
plagued by the Thorwalian ottas.

Southwest of the Etern Mountains, Arkania's tropical area begins.  The land
is marked by the high peaks of the Rain Mountains, whose tips jut above the
dense  jungle.   Aborigines and settlers from northern Arkania populate the
area,  but  remain  apart as much possible.  Generally, only trading brings
them  together.   The  Arkanian  settlenments  decorate  the  shoreline and
support  flourishing  trade.   On  the  other  hand  the aborigines, called
"Moha",  live  deep  within  the jungle in small villages secured on stilts
high  above  the  jungle's  sometimes dangerous floor.  They are experts in
herbs,  poisons, tinctures and animal preparations, and are sought after by
alchemists throughout Arkania.

In  the  Southern  territories  of Arkania, slavery is widespread.  In many
houses,  it  is  impressive to have a real "Woodsman" as a servant or maid.
Al'Anfa,  the  city  state  at  the  southern end of the east coast, is the
center  of  slavery  commerce and long ago earned the nickname "Town of Red
Gold."  It  has,  however,  drawn another name, "Plague Spot of the South,"
from those opposed to slavery.  The most prominent adversary of Al'Anfa and
its  policies is the small kingdom of Trahelia.  Located on the south coast
of  Arkania,  Trahelia recently fought for and was granted its independence
from the Middle Reich.

The  southwestern  point  of the Arkanian continent leads to an archipelago
whose  largest islands, Token, Iltoken and Benbukkuha, are highly respected
as suppliers of various spices

Arkania  itself  measures  up  to  3,000  miles  from its very north to the
jungles at its southern tip not a very long distance for a continent it may
seem,  but  it  would  take  an  Arkanian at least three months of constant
traveling to cross it.  Only a very few men and women would relish the idea
of  such  a  daring  journey .....  transversing wide areas without hope of
seeing another human face for months on end, crossing hostile lands overrun
by  Orcs  and  Ogres,  surviving  the  imminent  danger of such encounters,
perhaps only to fall prey to simple, wild animals

It is into this world that your party arrives.

Politics and History
--------------------

"From  the  landman  be  it  farmer  or  knight, in this world, there is no
right!"

From  the  song The Knight and the Maiden written by an unknown worker from
Lovely Field

"In  the name of Lord Praios, His Sister Rondra and the other immortal Ten,
in the name of Honor, Courage and Divine Might, in the name of Loyalty, the
Reich  and  Imperial  Majesty  in the name of Love and Respect for any good
natured  creature  I  do  lower this Blade onto, your shoulders so it shall
carry an honorable but heavy burden Raise now, Knight...."

From a formula used to confer knighthood in many parts of Arkania


A  democratic  state is no climate for dragons, orcs and goblins to thrive.
Instead  there  are  rulers, people who wear crowns and are called princes,
emperors  queens,  kings and counts.  The most common type of government in
Arkania  is  monarchy,  but  Arkanian  rulers are by no means comparable to
Kings  from  fairy tales who do little but stroke their beards and fear for
the destiny of their disappeared daughters.

The  state  of Arkania is much like Earth's early Renaissance period.  Just
as  rulers  on  Earth  behhaved during this time, so too do the monarchs of
Arkania; they use any means and methods offered ...  diplomacy, corruption,
war  and  intrigue.   Still the well being of their people and their empire
reigns above all, and nearly all are divinely honored by their citizens.

Among the states and their monarchs, however, Middle Reich and Lovely Field
are  considered  the  most  important.   Both  are  now reigned by a single
empress,  Amene III, who has less than a year's experience in the monarchy.
The  original emperor of Midddle Reich, Had I, disappeared under mysterious
circumsrances a short time ago and Amene III assumed his rule.  Both states
are organized in a classic feudal system
 
As  your  characters  enter into this political system, their position in
society  depends upon their origins.  A noble warrior or knight will likely
hold  the  honour  of  his  or  her  emperor highly.  A rogue raised in the
gutters of Gareth, on the other hand, will be more interested in collecting
ducats  than  respect.   A  magician might have, the wish to serve Arkanian
sciences,  while  an  ernstwhile  elf  may  leave home early to explore his
world.   A  social career is open to any of these individuals; each will be
recognized for their deeds in time, and emperors might grant them a reward,
a medal knighthood or even a small barony.

Mythology of the Gods
---------------------

"For   see,   the   blasphemers   and  assassins,  the  pillaging  mob  and
well-poisoners and what ever riff raff there be, the stubborn and hardened,
who  know  neither  remorse  nor penance, will not be given the key to open
heavenly gates by Boron.

From The Twelve Divine Paradises by Ahrik v.  Angbar, Praios 12Hal

No  matter  how  mighty  some  Arkanian monarchs are, they are not the real
guides  of history, the world or the people.  A multitude of gods hold this
power.   The  deities  draw their might from the faith of those who worship
them, but are not simple visions or created images.  They are, rather, very
real  and  powerful  creatures  who  present themselves to their believers,
perform  miracles  and  intervene  in  the  events  of the world.  The most
accepted belief in Arkania is in the Twelve Divines.  They are:

Praios..........Sun, Might and Rule
Effered.........Rain, Sea and Voyage
Boron...........Sleep and Death
Firun...........Hunting and Winter
Phex............Trade and Band of Thieves
Ingerimm........Fire, Skill of Iron Work
Rondra..........War, Lightning and Thunder
Travia..........Hospitality and Marriage
Hesinde.........Arts, Science and Magic
Tsa.............Renewal and Youth
Peraine.........Seeding and Healing
Rahja...........Love, Ecstasy and Wine


These  gods  are worshipped in Borland, Middle Reich, Lovely Field and many
other  regions  of the continent.  Even the months of the Arkanian calender
are named after them.  Of the other gods, there is Rastullah, worshipped by
the  desert  people, Novadi, and the Divine Twins, Rur and Gror, worshipped
by the citizens of Maraskan.

Between  all  these  gods,  which  are  complemented  by  an  assortment of
demigods,  there  is  occasionally a dispute or serious fight, but all have
one common enemy - The God With out a Name.  Even this one, epitome of evil
and  depravity that he maybe, has lured a number of worshippers in Arkania,
bribing them with the riches and power other gods do not willingly give.

Temples  are  found  in  nearly  every  Arkanian  village,  and  offer your
character  respite from his or her adventure.  Your characters will develop
a  following  for  one god or another, and will be guided in the god's way.
However,  gods,  virtuous  as they are will not turn away those who worship
any one of the Twelve.

Gerbods Diary
-------------

Thorwal,  on  the  23rd  day  of  Travia in this year 15 in the rule of his
divine magnificence, Emperor Hal I of Gareth ......

Arrived here late yesterday evening aboard the Storm Swalhow apparently the
last  ship  going to Thorwal before winter.  The harbor was full of vessels
from  all  corners  of the world, but the most common were the dragon ships
(or  ottas,  as they appear to be called around here).  Many of them seemed
to  originate in Thorwal, Prem and Olport judging by some of the flags they
were flying.

It  didn't take long to find that the inns were full up to the last bale of
straw  so  I  took  shelter  in  the Temple of Travia, obviously a place of
worship  to  the  Arkanian deity of the same name.  A house to our Mistress
Rondra  would have been more to my liking, not that I could find fault with
the  hospitality  of the people here.  The temple wasn't the most spacious,
so  I  did what I could to stash my few belongings in a corner.  Not having
an abundance of gear, just my trusty sword and a few writing imphements, it
didn't take long before I was comfortably wrapped in blankets.

A  group  of adventurers soon arrived and settled themselves down very near
to  my corner.  They seemed a remarkable sort of group whose minds were not
on continuous prayer, judging by the conversations I could overhear.  As if
sensing  my  interest, they were kind enough to invite me over to join into
their conversation.

Delo a young mage from Andergast, seemed to have just finished his studies.
Swanja,  a sailor maid from Prem seems to possess enormous strength; in the
course  of  her story telling, she easily hefted up an axe that my fighting
instructor  Alrik  would  have been hard pressed to lift!  Gurbosch, Son of
Gradobar of the Little people, left his spot only long enough to refill his
tankard  with  stout  from a seemingly endless supply in his backpacks.  He
constantly  hummed a bawdy miner's tune, stopping only when his tankard met
his  lips.  Rhenaya obviously an other magician of some kind, spent much of
her  time  sorting  her little bags of aromatic fresh herbs.  Finally there
was  Erinniha,  an  elf  woman  of  such  unreal beauty that I could hardly
believe  my eyes.  Through not much for words she occasionally responded to
Gurbosch's incessant humming with little more than an upturned eyebrow

It didn't take long to learn that they too were strangers, and so it seemed
natural that we explore the town together tomorrow.

The  night  of  talking  didn't stop us from leaving the temple at dawn.  A
tremendous  crowd  was  gathered  in  the square just outside the temple in
spite  of  the  early morning hour.  Seems that a daily market is held here
and  it's  quite  possible  that  the early attendees hoped to beat out the
latecomers  to  the  most  choice  items that the merchants had on display.
There  was  at  least  one  stall  for  every type of merchant that you can
imagine  but  it  is  said  that  the  quality  of  the  merchandise varies
enormously from one day to the next.  At least there is a market here daily
though,  even  in winter, since in some of the settlements further into the
wilderness it may be weeks between visits from a travelling merchant

Erinnila  found a marvelous lute and we each chipped in a few silver crowns
toward its purchase.  We figured that she would earn it back from her first
performance  in  one  of  the local taverns.  It was quite an experience to
watch Gurbosch do his part to haggle the merchant down.  I suspect that the
merchant  was  so dazzled he is only now realizing that he was paid a third
of the asking price.

Feeling quite triumphant with our success in the market, we left to explore
the  streets  of  Thorwal.   we  found  an  abundance  of  outfitters, arms
merchants  and  herbalists not to mention a number of healers and smiths as
well.   There were plenty of temples to the different Arkanian deities, but
I  could`nt  find  one  dedicated  to  our  Mistress Rondra.  I made due at
Swafnir's hall to give thanks for our rewarding journey.

A  freak accident marred our explorations today.  Rhenaya was debating with
a  herb merchant about the quality of his whirlweed when a supply cart came
barreling   around   the  corner  with  such  tremendous  speed  it  almost
overturned.   Thanks  be  to Rondra for her quick reflexes!  Rhenaya barely
saved  herself  from the cart's wheels by diving head first into a potter's
display.   Unfortunately, she was left with a number of scratches, although
not nearly as many as suffered by the potter's wares.

Her  wounds  were  serious  enough  to make us search out the services of a
healer.   We  found Noro Mystico in the "Strangers Quarter," located in the
western part of Thorwal where few locals reside.  The look of the place did
nothing  to  inspire  our  trust,  but he seemed to know his trade.  To his
credit, Rhenaya is already feeling much better.
 
We have moved our belongings to an inn called the "Hetman Oremo" near the
Temple  of Peraine.  We decided that we would be more comfortable here even
though  it's  somewhat  on the expensive side.  But it is clean and we each
have a decent bed to sleep in.  Maybe tomorrow we'll have the chance to let
Erinnila try out her lute in one of the taverns.

We  made it into one of the taverns yesterday, and Erinnila proved to be as
much  a success as we thought she would be.  I'm thinking of paying a visit
to  that  healer myself as my head feels as if someone has been pounding on
it  with a war hammer.  These Thorwalians can drink like fish, only its not
water  that they toss back.  I met two, Sir Shaun of Crispy, a regal knight
of his kingdom and Sir Ian of Metavira, a mere jester in his.  Nonetheless,
they  travel together bringing unique brews to the taverns where they stop.
They  specialize  in  producing  something  they  call  "Fire" and "Premian
Brandy," both pretty potent brews

Swanja was certainly enjoying both of them and she drank the vicious liquid
without even batting an eyelid.  I have a hazy recollection of her dragging
the rest of us back to Hetman Oremo.  sir Shaun, meanwhile, spent the night
near  his horse, and Ian the jester was found outside his room, still sound
asleep,  just this morn.  Swanja who happened upon him said he was mumbling
incoherent  things  about  trees  and fruit and his aim being off.  Indeed,
Thorwal is a strange town.

Nonetheless,  the  adventures  at the Four Winds last night were well worth
this  morning's  pain.   A  lot  of  seafaring  folk  gather there, and the
boatswains  and  sailors  tell  many  hair  raising  tales.   I  was  quite
fascinated by the story of the ghost ship rumoured to be sailing the waters
around Arkania.

For  some reason I can't get the story of the ghost ship out of my mind.  I
listened to it again today, drinking somewhat less Fire in the process, and
really  believe that it may be more than just a tall tale.  It just doesn't
sound  like  the tales I've heard in every other tavern.  This story has me
really  curious,  and  since  I`m  beginning to feel the urge to leave town
before  winter  sets in, I believe I'll go down to the harbour tomorrow and
ask around.

I  was  able  to find out quite a lot today.  There is a cutter leaving for
Varnhome  tomorrow.   We'll have to wait another day, but I'm sure that the
sea  and  the  ghost  ship,  will  still  be there.  Gurbosch was less than
thrilled  on  hearing  my plans, but allowed himself to be convinced by the
lure  of the treasure that could be waiting for us on that ghost ship.  The
harbour  master mentioned another ship leaving in three days, but I'm going
to push my companions to be ready to leave tomorrow

So  far  the  journey  to Varnhome has proven to be rather uneventful We've
found  out a little bit more about the ghost ship from some of the sailors,
but there has been no sign of the ship itself.  They claim it usually sails
farther  west across the Seven Winds Ocean.  Well, maybe tomorrow we'll see
the ship's sails at last

Having  reached  Varnhome,  we look back upon a most disappointing journey.
Not  only  did  we not see the ghost ship, but adding insult to injury, the
sea was very rough on the last leg of the passage.  Gutbosch and Delo spent
most of the day leaning on the rails.

Talking  to  the  harbour master in Varnhome has revealed that we dont have
any  chance  of finding a vessel back to Thorwal for at least several days.
Since  we  haven't  really  come across any interesting merchants here, and
we've pretty much had our fill of taverns for the time being, we've decided
to tackle the trek back on foot.

We  spent  most  of yesterday outfitting our group with some basic supplies
required  for the journey, and wasted no time in heaving the boring town of
Varnhome.   Just  as we were heaving the last merchant's shop, he warned us
that  the  Orcs  were  getting  more  and  more  daring, and have even sent
marauding forays out to the coast.  We've seen none of the blackfurs so far
though, but are quite prepared to give them a taste of Swanja's axe if they
show up.

The  marching  is  proving to be slower than we had anticipated.  Our short
legged  friend  finds it hard to keep up and DeLo just doesn't seem to have
the  stamina  to  push on as we would like.  But the weather is fair and we
fally expect to reach Thorwal in a couple of days.

We  finished  our  first  battle  moments  ago!   A  group  of goblins were
harboring  a  delusion  that they had a chance of defeating us!  We lost no
time in proving to them the fatal error of their beliefs!

Their advantage lasted no longer than our first attack as Deho and Erinnila
were  quick to let go with a couple of Lightning bolts, helplessly blinding
two  of the opponents.  The rest of us let our swords speak for us!  Swanja
and  Gurbosch felled their opponents with two blows, and while it took me a
few more than that to dispose of my attacker, he did not hand a single blow
against me

Rhenaya had a close call when her cudgel broke on her first parry, but when
the goblin noticed Erinnila and Delo turning in his direction, he was quick
to  turn  tail and run.  The rest of the cowardly filth took flight seconds
after that

We took a couple minutes to check out their supplies, but true to form they
had  nothing  worthwhile.  Even the food packs seemed contaminated by their
filth.   None  of  us experienced any injuries during the battle, but as we
dragged  the bodies off the road, Swanja received a small wound.  We set up
camp  so  that  we could attend to the wound immediately.  It's not wise to
invite  infection.   We will continue on our way in the morning, and do not
expect any further attacks this close to Thorwal.

We  made  it  back  to  town  and found sleeping in a comfortable bed quite
pleasant  after  our  days  on the road.  Before retiring for the night, we
were  sure  to unwind with a night of carousing at a tavern called the Lost
Bit.  It was a prosperous evening!  We learned more about the town from the
patrons  and  the  tavern  keeper  than from any others we have so far met.
Tomorrow  we'll  have chance to try out the smiths in town as we still need
to  find someone to repair Rhenaya's cudgel and Swanja's axe could use some
attention  and  care.   Any  decent Thorwalian smith should be able to take
care of it though.

I  wasn't  surprised to learn that Thorwal offers a warriors academy in the
southwest  corner  of  town, but I can't say that I'm too excited that it's
run  by  one  of the LittLe People.  Probably all anyone can learn there is
how  to  swing an axe!  Gurbosch, of course, is quite taken with visiting a
distant  relative,  a  definition  which  seems  to  apply to anyone of the
dwarven  race,  and is offering our services to help him out, as is typical
among this chosely knit race.

It  turns out that there are some problems at this academy, at least that's
what  our innkeeper told us this morning.  According to rumour, the faculty
and  students  at  the  "Old  Ungalf," the local name for the academy, have
noticed  some  thieving  on  their  grounds.  It seems that even though the
lower  floors are no longer in use and that the entrances to these sections
have  been  bricked  up,  that  somehow  a band of brigands must have found
access  somewhere in the lower tunnels.  We'll find out the true story soon
enough.

We  visited  Master  Dramosch  at the academy today.  Even though access is
supposed to be restricted, the guards at the academy's gate are rather lax,
and  all  you  need to do is bark at them like you're supposed to be there.
We  found  out  that  not  only  are their supplies being spirited out from
beneath their noses but one of the their students has been missing for some
days now.

Oddly  enough,  the  academy doesn't seem to possess nearly enough fighting
power,  much  less  magical abilities, to investigate the crime.  Turns out
they`re all novices here.

Gurbosch, Delo and Swanja were very taken with the idea of helping out from
the  start,  but Erinnila and Rhenaya took some convincing.  The thought of
spending  several days crawling around dark cellars doesn't appear to be to
their liking.

We  spent the day stocking up on everything we're going to need to properly
explore  the  dungeons  of  the  academy.   We went to the supply stores of
Mr.Stoerrebrandt-Grassberg  and  a  dwarven  arms  merchant known as Grollo
Gumbladsson.   They are both the best, and the most expensive, offering the
finest  selection in town.  We made sure to purchase the best arms we could
afford  in  addition  to  plenty of torches ropes and tinderboxes.  We even
took  care to buy throwing irons, crowbars and shovels, as well as food and
water for several days.

Before  hiking  down  to  the  dungeons with all our supplies we figured we
would  spend this night at the inn to be sure of a good night's rest.  Delo
performed  some  kind of magical ritual on his wand the other night, and is
still  a  little  bit  tired because of it.  But none of us are complaining
about  the  use  of a few soft pillows since who knows when we will next be
able to enjoy a comfortable bed again.

I  don't  imagine  I'll  find  much  time to write of our experiences as we
travel  the  musty  vaults beneath this castle.  I pray to the gods we will
survive  and to Rhondra for our victory.  If we can pass this test we might
be trusted with a truly honourable mission leading us far into the wilds of
the  Orcish lands.  On we must go, and we must never falter.  It is time to
face the darkness.  For Rondra!  For the Hetman!  For Master Dramosch!
 
BEGINNING: BLADE OF DESTINY 
---------------------------

You've just opened the package, installed Blade and are eager to set off on
your  adventure.   With  Blade,  it's  just  a  few  clicks away!  (For the
quickest  route  into Blade, see your reference card.) In this section, you
may  read  about  Blade's  different  levels of play to find the one that's
right for you and that suits your taste in fantasy role playing games.

The Novice And Advanced Game
----------------------------

Beginning  Blade of Destiny, you may choose between a Novice or an Advanced
Game.   While  both levels allow you to get an adventure full of challenge,
each is designed for your gaming preference:

. Novice: The novice level is designed for gamers who want to enjoy the
  game but don't want to juggle all the statistics that are common to any
  role playing game. While playing in Novice mode, your computer
  handles all values for skills and magic (including increases). It also
  highlights the best character for any task your party is asked to perform
  You, may change to Advanced mode any time you restart.

. Advanced: The advanced level offers you complete control over your
  characters, statistics, skills and magic, allowing you to custom tailor
  your characters. You will have full access to all the statistics that 
  role players love to collect. As your characters progress through the 
  game, you may customize these facets even further. While this process 
  of fine tuning takes time, as does any role playing experience, it allows
  you to define your characters to your personal tastes.


Once  you  select  the  Novice or Advanced game, you may choose between the
Main  Program  and  the  Generation.   Since  you're  new  to Blade, select
Generation  to create your party.  You may also select Main Program to play
with a pregeneated party

How Should You Create Your Party?
--------------------------------

Some  people  like to create their own parties.  Others prefer to play with
ready  made  characters.   Whatever your preference, it is here.  There are
four  different  methods,  or  routes,  you  may  follow  to get your party
together  and  off  to  adventure  Depending  on  your  Advanced  or Novice
selection,  you'll  have  certain  choices all of which are detailed on the
next page

Regardless  of which path you take to get you and your party together, it`s
recommended  you  check  out pages 16 and 17 for character attributes along
with  the  Review screen section beginning on page 20.  Here, you can learn
about  your  characters'  statistics  like  LP (life points) and AP (astral
points)  and  other  important  facets  that  are  important  to characters
regardless of their generation history.

CHARACTER GENERATION
--------------------

Creating Your Characters
------------------------
           
Creating  your  own  characters  is  an  important part of any fantasy role
playing  experience.   Nursing  them from level one tots to mighty warriors
provides  a  feeling  and a challenge unlike any other.  In Realms, you may
create  your  party  in any one of four different ways and on two different
levels.   The  Advanced  Mode allows you full control over each character's
statistics  while the Novice Mode provides you with the fastest and easiest
way to create a character.

Once  you begin Realms, just select generation to create your own character
Soon,  you'll  see a generation screen similar to the one below (just click
the  right  mouse  button or press ESC to remove the genetation menu for an
exact  replication).   Here,  you  see all the attributes that make up each
Arkanian woman and man,

Character  generation  in  Realms  allows you to control all facets of your
Characters  development.   You  may  define  their statistics individually,
placing  each  roll  strategically  ...   where  you  feel  it  will make a
difference.   Or,  if  you  prefer the more casual approach, Realms will do
most  of  it  for  you.   Although  Realm`s character generation is "open,"
meaning  you  can  select  the  available options in almost any order, it's
recommended  you  follow  the  order of the manual, at least for your first
time through.

Deciding On An Archetype For Your Character
-------------------------------------------

Before  you begin rolling your characters, it's important to determine what
types  of  characters  you hope to create.  Just as on Earth, characters in
Arkania  have  professions  and  fields of knowledge they follow, learn and
perfect.   Everything  from  a  characters strength to his or her skills is
influenced  by  their profession.  A character's profession is known as his
or  her  Archetype.  In Realms, your characters may pursue anyone of twelve
Archetypes (detailed in Appendix A)

Once you`ve reviewed the Archetypes available and have ideas for your party
make up the actual character creation begins.

Selecting a Name
----------------

Like  most  good adventurers, Arkanian characters don't like to be referred
to as "Hey You," To give characters a name, select the menu option or click
"Name",  on the character screen.  You may name your character anything you
like, but his or her name will be abbreviated if it's over seven letters.

Selecting a Gender
-----------------

Next  select  your  character's  gender  by  choosing the menu option or by
clicking  on  the  gender symbol (the upper right hand corner).  Characters
may  be  male  or  female.  Men and women are equally skilled, talented and
trained  in  Arkania.   You may change their gender anytime prior to saving
the character.

Choosing Your Course Of Action
------------------------------

Depending  on  which  generation  method  you  prefer you may select Choose
Archetype or New Attributes.

.Choose Archetype: Selecting this option, Realms allows you to choose
 the profession your character will follow from any of the twelve
 Archetypes available, and assigns the minimum attribute values for that
 Archetype to the character, If you wish to use Choose Archetype, you
 may skip to the Choose Archetype section of this chapter on page 19.

.New Attributes: Selecting this option, you take the dice into your
 hands. First, decide on an Archetype for your character. but keep
 it in your head for the time being. Then, following the minimum
 entrance requirements for your Archetype as listed in Appendix A, you
 manually distribute the attribute values to qualify for the Archetype.
 Characters who are hand crafted in this manner have higher overall
 attributes than those created with Choose Archetype. If you select this
 option, move to the next section.

Selecting New Attributes
------------------------

Characters  earn  their  mettle when you define their atttibutes.  When you
select  this  option,  Realms  "rolls" values for their positive attributes
(the  left  hand  column)  and  their  negative  attributes (the right hand
column).

Positive Attributes
-------------------

Like  you,  your  characters  have  certain levels of wisdom, dexterity and
strength among other statistics.  In Arkania, the seven positive attributes
are  tracked numerically and, for newly created characters, range from 8 to
13.

. Courage (CR): A high courage influences quick decisions, and provides
  a high amount of willpower. This can be of value in a fight, when trying
  to resist a spell or when conversing.

. Wisdom (WD): This attribute measures the theoretical or "bookish"
  knowledge a character has, memory, ability to plan ahead and to think
  in abstract terms. This makes it the basis of most magic.

. Charisma (CH): A character with a high charisma value will find it
  easier to influence others. Also, his or her team mates will be more open
  to the character's suggestions.

. Dexterity (DX): This atttibute is needed to manipulate small objects. It
  affects disarming traps, opening locks and other maneuvers which
  require slight of hand. It also affects a magician's ability to weave
  a magic spell.

. Agility (AG): This measures the ability to move skillfully and to avoid
  sudden obstacles. It also helps characters to avoid blows in combat.

. Strength (ST): More than just brute muscle power, this is also the
  knowledge of how to use it to the fullest. A necessity for moving heavy
  objects, using heavy weapons, strength also determines a characters
  maximum load.

. Intuition (IN): It's not necessarily anything you heard or anything you
  saw, but something just tells you that something's up. A characters
  intuition affects their ability to perform many skills and also influence
  a magic user's ability.

You`ll  see  Realms  initial roll on your screen.  This roll, a 13 lets say
can be used for any of the seven attributes; you select which one depending
on  the  Archetype you`re hoping to create.  After placing the first value,
Realms  will  roll  again  until  you have placed each roll with a positive
statistic.

Negative Attributes
-------------------

Next you'll assign values for the negative statistics just like you did for
his  or her positive atributes.  Keep in mind that Archetypes have negative
attribute requirements as well.  The seven negative attributes, which range
from 2 to 8 for new characters are;

. Superstition (SN): Characters with high superstition notice certain
  things, black cats and the like, and instantly understand their meaning.
  A high superstition often makes a character particularly susceptible to
  magic.

. Acrophobia (AC): A fear of heights, leading to a distinct feeling of
  vertigo. A large acrophobia value can be a severe handicap when forced
  to cross a suspension bridge or standing at a cliff edge.

. Claustrophobia (CL): The fear of being buried alive which can close
  in when traveling through narrow halls and low corridors.

. Avarice (AV): The urge to gather gold, jewelry and other precious
  items. A character gripped by avarice will often forget all else happening
  around him or her just to loot something that has caught his or her eye.

. Necrophobia (NE): A particularly terifying fear of death and anything
  connected with it, especially the undead, mummies, zombies, and
  skeletons. A character with a high necrophobia value will sometimes
  refuse to fight against undead and may run away instead.

. Curiosity (CU): A healthy amount of cutiosity is something of a
  prerequisite for a true hero, but too much of evetything is a curse, and
  so it is with curiosity. Magicians especially are often overcome with
  curiosity upon discovering old scrolls and magical artifacts.

. Violent Temper (VT): A character with a violent temper is easily
  insulted and quick to draw a weapon to right any perceived wrong.

Select Archetype
----------------

After  assigning your character's attribute values, choose Select Archetype
Realms  will  show  you  alist  of Archetypes your character qualifies for.
Just  select  one to make it official.  At times, however, you may see that
the  character you've created doesn't qualify for any Archetype at all.  In
this  case,  Realms  will  tell  you that you've failed to meet the minimum
entrance  requirements for any Archetype Perhaps, he or she is just a point
or  two  shy where it counts.  You don't need to start over.  just roll the
dice  a  bit more!  Select the Change Attribute option, covered in the next
section,  to  modify his or her current values.  If you find yourself miles
away  from  your  desired  Archetype,  though,  you  may  also  select  New
Attributes and re-roll.

Change Attributes
-----------------

When  you  've  placed  all of your rolls and are still just one point away
from  creating that Silvan Elf that you've been trying for, don't worry ...
you still have another option open to you.  Change Attributes allows you to
alter  both  positive and negative attributes by trading off points between
the two.

For  example,  a  Silvan  Elf requires an agility of 13, but, let's say, in
your attempt to create this Archetype, your agility is only 12.  Otherwise,
you  qualify  for the Archetype.  It's just too close for a re-roll, so you
select  Change  Attributes.   Realms  shows  you  a menu listing all of the
positive attributes.  Select the atribute, agility in this case, and you'll
have  the  option  to  increase  or  decrease  the atribute value Selecting
increase, his agility jumps to 13.

But,  there  is  a  price  .......for  every one point change you make to a
positive  attribute,  you  will be required to make a two point change to a
negative attribute.

After  you  increase  the  positive  atribute,  Realms  shows you a menu of
negative  attributes  ...   and  asks  you  to  trade  off for the positive
increase  in  agility by increasing your negative attributes by two points.
You  may  put  both  increases  in  one attribute or split them between two
different  atttibutes.   Just  be carefull not to alter a negative atribute
above  (or below) the minimum entrance requirement for the Archetype you're
hoping to create.

Change  Attributes  also  allows  you to decrease negative atribute values.
For  example,  say that same Silvan Elf has a 5 for avarice, but needs a 3.
You  can  use  this  option  to  decrease  two  points  from  your negative
attributes by choosing to remove one point from a positive attribute.

Regardless  of  which way you do your point trading, remember that positive
attributes  cannot  be  decreased below 8 or above 13.  Negative attributes
can  not  go below 2 or above 8.  Additionally, once you begin to change an
atttibute  you  may not turn in the other direction values that are lowered
may  not  be  raised later on.  Likewise, values that are raised may not be
lowered.  You may, however continue heading in the same direction.

When  you  have  completed  the  adjustment to your character's negative at
tibutes,  Realms will return you to the character screen.  Just right click
or  hit  PgUp  to return to the menu options.  If you have further changes,
though, select Change attributes again.

Choose Archetype
----------------

If  you  prefer  to  select your Archetype without rolling all the attibute
values yourself Realms will do it for you, by selecting Choose Archetype, A
menu  shows  you a list of all available Archetypes in the land, and allows
you  to  select  the  profession of your choice.  Once you have selected an
Archetype,  Blade  automatically  gives  the character his or her attribute
values.

While  using  choose  Archetype is quick, characters created by this method
have certain drawbacks:

. The characters attribute values will be the minimum amount required 
  for entrance into the Archetype you've selected. Characters created 
  manually tend to benefit from the "roll of the dice."

. Their positive atttibutes will not be above 12, versus 13 for manually 
  created characters

. Their negative attributes will not be below 3, versus 2 for manually 
  created characters

Choosing An Arcane Lore
-----------------------

If  you  created  a magician or magicienne, You will be asked to choose the
character's  preferred arcane lore.  Arcane lore influences the character's
magical  focus  and affects his or her spell casting skill for the selected
category.   The different lores as well as their magical spells are covered
in  the  Arcane  Lore  section  of  this  manual.   In the Advanced mode, a
magician  or a magicienne also has the option to convert increase attempts.
You  may  choose to trade either spell increase attempts for skill attempts
or  vice versa.  Additionally, this Archetype can give up 10 spell increase
attempts  for  an additional 10 astral points (AP).  (For more information,
see page 23).

Choosing A Portrait
-------------------

After  you've chosen your Archetype, a selection of portraits will be shown
appropriate  for  your  Character's Archetype and gender, Just click on the
arrows to scroll through the available portraits.

Additional Character/ Archetype Attributes
------------------------------------------

With  your  character's  Archetype  in place, you'll see that he or she has
several, new attributes.

. Money: As in any World, money is an important commodity in Arkania
  This statistic shows the amount of money your character currently has
  (and, hey, there's no income tax in Arkania).

. Gold Ducats: Are the highest form of currency and are displayed as "D"

. Silver Crowns: 10 Silver Crowns equal a Gold Ducat. Silver Crowns
  are displayed as "S.

. Copper Bits: 10 Copper Bits equal a Silver Crown. Copper Bits are
  displayed as "B."

You may see, for instance, 10D 2C 5B on your character's screen.  He or she
has  10  Ducats, 2 Crowns and 5 Bits, Your character's make up and a bit of
luck determine how much money he or she receives.

. Height and Weight: Help to define the physical aspects of your
  character and are based on the Archetype you selected for your
  character

. Deity: A character's deity is very important in Arkania. Based upon the
  month the character is born, the deity determines the character's
  general way of life and may offer bonuses to attribute or skill values
  (then again, they may not .... deities are funny that way). Throughout
  this world, temples offer respite for travelers, and occasionally, charac
  ters in need may enjoy divine help. Steady worship and sacrifice to their
  deities will go a long way toward making a favorable impression on the
  Gods

. Life Points (LP): Represent the amount of damage a character can take
  before it dies. A character's life points are based upon his or her 
  statistics. and increase with experience. Should the life points reach 
  five or fewer. the character will lose consciousness; he or she will 
  die at Zero. Life points can be regained through sleep, potions or 
  magical intervention.

. Astral Points (AP): All kinds of magic are powered by astral energy
  which is measured in astral points. These points represent the amount
  of magical power your character has and also the amount of points
  available to cast spells. Astral points are also based upon your 
  character's Archetype. Astral points increase with experience and are 
  replenished through sleep, potions or meditation.

. Endurance: Reflects your characters ability to withstand strain and is
  a key factor in the movement points the character has available, and
  how much burden can be tolerated before sacrificing movement points.
  Endurance is based upon a characters life points (LP) and strength (ST)

. Magic Resistance (MR): Represents a characters ability to ward off
  the effects of magical spells. A characters magic resistance is based
  upon his or her courage (CR) wisdom (WD) and superstition (SN)

For Novice Mode
---------------

If  you`re  creating your character in the Novice mode, you`re nearly done.
Skip  to  page  24  to save your future hero.  Your characters have all the
values  that  may  be  customised in the Advanced game, skills, attack, and
parry  values  and magic powers, but Realms automatically handles skill and
spell increases, assigning and tracking all of their calculations for you.

For Advanced Mode
-----------------

If  you  created  your  characters  in  the  Advanced mode, you may further
customise  your characters in three areas:  skills, attack and parry values
and,  for magic users magic.  These changes are explained the the following
sections.

Increasing Skill Values 
-----------------------

Arkanian  characters  have  lots  of skills that are needed in their world.
When  you  first  create  your character in the Advanced mode, he or she is
given  a  set  of statistic values that reflect the standard training for a
character  of  that Archetype.  To review your character's skills, click on
either arrow at the bottom of the generation screen until you reach any one
of  the  character's  skill  screens.  Press the arrow again to review more
skills (Skills are fully explained in Appendix B:  Skills.)

At  the  bottom  of  the  skill  screens  between the arrows you`ll notice:
REMAINING ATTEMPTS :  20.  This number may vary depending on the characters
Archetype

Your  characters remaining attempts are a chance for you to increase skills
you consider important for the character and your adventure in Arkania.  To
attempt a skill increase:

. Move to the skill screen that contains the skill you want to increase.

. Press the right mouse button to open the Skill Increase Menu.

. Next, select a skill group.

. From the group you have selected, choose a skill to increase. Blade rolls
  a die to determine your success or failure, and tells you of the out come

. Repeat these steps until all of your skill attempts are used.

While increasing your skills, keep the following things in mind:

. Combat and Intuitive skills cannot be increased by more than one point
  when creating characters or when gaining levels.

. Knowledge skills cannot be increased by more than three points when
  creating characters or when gaining levels.

. All other skills areas cannot be increased by more than two points 
  per level.

. If you increase a Combat skill, you will increase the skill's attack 
  and parry value as well. You may further adjust these values, though 
  this is covered in the following section.

. You have three attempts available to increase any one skill. Should you 
  not succeed in increasing a skill within those three attempts, wait until
  the character gains a level of experience to try again.

. The highest skill value possible is + 18. The lowest value is a -20.

Changing Attack And Parry Values
--------------------------------

A  character's  attack and parry values reflect their statistics and combat
skills and determine how they perform in combat.  In general, there are two
different parts to the attack and parry values.

Understanding The Values
------------------------

1. Basic Values: Overall reflections of the character's ability to fight
   offensively (ATtack) and to protect defensively (PArry).

   AT: The basic value for Attack is based upon your characters
   courage (CR), agility (AG) and strength (ST).

   PA: The basic value for Parry is based upon your characters
   intuition (IN), agility (AG) and strength (ST).

2. Mode Values: Mode Values are based upon the combination of your
   characters actual combat skill (SV, from the skill list) and the
   Basic Values. Like the Basic Values, Mode Values are split into two 
   categories, attack (AT) and parry (PA).

Modifying The Values
--------------------

While  Blade  initially  determines  your  character's Mode Values, you may
change  the  individual  AT (attack) and PA (parry) values to suit your own
taste.   If  you prefer an offensive hack slashing type character, increase
their  AT values.  If, on the other hand, you prefer someone whos better at
protecting him or herself from a blow, increase their PA values.

Increasing values is easy, just remember the total from Step 2 in the above
example  (Naturally.   this  total may be different for your characters and
varies  from  Mode  to  Mode).   To  get  this total, add both Basic Values
together,  and  then  add  the SV (skill value).  You may split this number
between  the Mode's AT and PA values anyway you like so long as they do not
fall  below  the  AT or PA Basic Values.  For instance, if your total is 14
and your Basic Values are both 6, like above, you can have an AT value of 8
and  a  PA  value  of  6  (or 7 AT and 7 PA and so on.As you distribute the
values,  consider  where  you  want  the  character's  proficiency  to lie:
defensive  moves  or  offensive moves.  Though they are calculated the same
way, the values for missile weapons and thrown weapons may not be changed

What  happens  if a character has a negative combat skill value?  You won't
be  able  to  do  any  adjustments  for  starters.   The  negative value is
subtracted,  more or less evenly from the character's Basic Skill values to
produce the AT and PA values.  If the characters skill level is so low that
it  exceeds the total of the Basic Values, he or she would have zero AT and
zero  PA.   He  or  she  will not be able to protect themselves from such a
weapon's attack, and can't attack very well with it either.  (Hey norm, old
buddy.   That  was  a fine trick you pulled with that sword.  Must say I`ve
never  seen  any one miss monsters with such grace and defiance.  You did a
heck  of  a  job  on  those  air  molecules,  though, I can`t tell, they're
hurting)

Increasing Spell Values
-----------------------

Magic  users  in  the  Advanced  mode may also increase their current spell
values  Just like increasing skills, Realms allows your character a certain
amount  of  attempts,  magical  bonus  points  of a sort, to increase spell
values.  Obviously, characters who are not magically gifted won`t have this
option.  To attempt a spell increase:

. Move to the spell screen that contains the spell you want to increase.
  There are seven screens of spells, and each is fully explained in the
  Arcane Lore section of this manual

. Press the right mouse button to open the Spell increase Menu

. Next, select a spell group

. From the group you have selected, choose a spell to increase Realms
  rolls a die to determine your success or failure, and tells you of the
  outcome

. Repeat these steps until all of your spell increase attempts are used


While trying to create a super spell caster, keep these things in mind:

. Depending on your characrer's Archetype, he or she will have a varying
  amount of increase attempts. Magicians and Magiciennes have 40,
  Druids, Druidesses, Warlocks and Witchs have 25. All Elves have 20
  attempts.

. Certain spells have increase limits. After all, a level 1 character who can
  blow up Thorwal and most of the surrounding fauna does not a
  balanced game make. The limits depend on your character's Archetype

. Spells that are part of a character's Archetype can be increased by two
  points when you first create your character and as he or she gains levels
  (See the Arcane Lore section of this manual for further information)

. Spells not in a characrer's Archetype can be increased only a single point
  when you first create your character and as he or she gains levels,

. Magicians and Magiciennes can increase all spells belonging to their
  Arcane Lore by 2 points when you first create them and as they gain levels

. Musicians and Magiciennes also possess certain "house spells" they can
  increase up to 3 points when they're first created and as they gain levels

. You have at most three failed attempts available to increase any one spell
  Should you not succeed in increasing a spell with those three attempts
  wait until the character gains a level to try again.

. Your character cannot use any spell with a value below - 5, (In fact, it
  might be downright dangerous if they could,)

. The highest spell value possible is + 18.

Saving Your Character
---------------------

Once  you're  happy  with  your  character,  select  Save  Hero to add your
character  to  the  ranks  of  the elite, albeit inexperienced adventurers,
awaiting  you.   If  your  character  profile  is incomplete, or if another
character by the same name already exists, Blade will let you know

A New Hero
----------

Once  you,ve  saved  your  character,  select  New  Hero  to create another
character  New Hero is also helpful if your current character isn't cutting
it, and you'd like to begin anew with a fresh slate of attributes

You  may  create  as many characters you like, and select up to six to join
you  in  your  adventure.  The program comes with six pre-rolled characters
that  you  may  use  as well.  Newly created characters maybe added to your
party at the Temple of Travia in Throwal

Exit Program
------------

Select  Exit  Program  to  exit the character generation and autonmatically
enter  the  Realms  of Arkania Blade of Destiny Main Program.  To return to
the character Generation program, you must exit the program and restart.

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
---------------------

Gaining Levels
--------------

As your characters travel through Arkania, they will gain experience points
as  they  face  numerous  foes,  perform herculian tasks and overcome other
perils  common  to  daily life in Arkania.  When your characters accumulate
enough  experience  points, they become eligible for new experience levels.
These  levels,  along with all their benefits, are granted in towns.  Here,
citizens  recognize  the importance of your deeds; Orcs in the wilds of the
forests, on the other hand, could not care less

To reach the next level of experience, characters need to gain:

    EP |    LEVEL      EP  |  LEVEL      EP     |  LEVEL
       |                   |                    |
     0 |    1       15000  |  3          50000  |    5
  5000 |    2       30000  |  4          75000  |    6


When your character gains a level, they will enjoy, numerous benefits:
 
. You may choose to increase any positive attribute, followed by a
  decrease of two points to your negative attributes.

. Life points (LP) will increase by up to six points. For magic users, these 
  points may increase by up to eight points

. Magic users may divide these eight points between LP and AP

In The Advanced Game
--------------------

If  you  are playing in the Advanced mode, you will have the opportunity to
use  skill  and  spell  increase  attempts  to  continue to shape the ideal
character,  much  as  you  may  have  or  would  have  done in the Advanced
Character Generation.  Additionally, other factors come into play:

. Archetypes get 20 skill increase attempts except for the Magician and
  Magicienne who receive 15

. When increasing combat skills, you will have the opportunity to adjust
  AT and PA values.

. Spell increase attemnpts depend on Archetype Magicians and Magici-
  ennes receive 40, Druids, Druidesses, Warlocks and Witches recieve
  25 and Elves receive 20

. With the exception of Elves, magic users may convert skill increase
  attempts into spell increase attempts and vice versa

. Magicians and Magiciennes may forgo some spell increase attempts in
  return for astral points

When your chatacters gain a level, it's agood idea to save your game at the
nearest Temple

TOWNS CITIES & VILLAGES
-----------------------

With  your  team  of  heroes eager for adventure, their swords polished and
held  high,  you're  off  to  Arkania to explore all it has to offer.  Your
journey begins in the Temple of Travia located in the heart ofThorwal.

Visiting Temples
----------------

Like  temples  throughout  Arkania,  the Temple of Travia offers your party
respite  from its adventure, a chance to kick back, have a word or two with
a  deity,  and  if  the stars are right, your characters might even benefit
from a miracle.  These Temple options are available to you.

ADD CHARACTER
If  you  created your own characters select this option to form your party.
You`ll  see  a list of characters eager and ready and may select up to six.
You  may  also  use  this option to add one or two characters to your party
(after  removing  the  same  amount  of  course)  at  any  time during your
adventure.

Note:  You may add newly ctreated characters to your party at the Temple of
Travia  in  Thorwol.   At all other Temples you may only add characters who
have been let go at that location.

LET GO CHARACTER
Sometimes  characters  just dont turn out to be all that you had hoped for.
Perhaps your parties Archetype mix could have been a bit better.  If you`re
so  inclined to remove a character from the group, select this option to do
so.   You`ll  see  a list of your parties members and with just a click you
can remove any character from the group.

ERASE CHARACTER
The  permanent  version  of  LET  GO  CHARACTER erase Character removes the
unlucky  one  from Blades register of characters.  Party members may not be
erased  however until they are Let Go from the party.  keep in mind that an
erased character is gone for good.

LOAD GAME
Your  party  has just come from a tavern or rather was summarily thrown out
of  the  tavern  -  after your rogue assured you he could cheat the best of
them  and  only  ended up with someones pocket lint.  Not exactly the plans
you  had  in  mind.   It`s  the  perfect  time to Load Game.  A list of the
currently  saved  games  will  be  shown.  Select the proper game, and your
affairs  will  once  again be in order.  To begin with an empty slate for a
new  party,  select  None,  or select Start to use Blades set of pre-rolled
characters.

SAVE GAME
After  a particularly hectic encounter, or perhaps a good bit of sleuthing,
it's  a  great  idea  to save your game, and Temples are the most rewarding
places  to  save  it.  Parties brave enough to travel from temple to temple
between  saves  recieve the full value of their experience points.  Parties
who  save  outside  of  temples  lose 50 experience points per save (saving
every other step doesnt an adventurer make).  When you select Save Game you
will  be  shown the list of current saves (if you`ve just begun, you`ll see
the  start, Game 1 and so on).  Select any game slot and customize its name
if you wish.

END GAME
Select  this  option  to end your travels in Arkania.  This option will not
save your game.  Select Save Game first if you wish to do so.

ASK FOR MIRACLE
It never hurts to hope for a bit of divine assisstance When your party asks
for a miracle, two factors come into play:

1. Does any character worship this particular deity? Who?

2. Has your party paid their due respects to the deity?

If  your  character  is  successful,  he or she may recieve the benefits of
their pious worship (or their generous contributions).  Keep in mind though
that like here on earth, miracles in Arkania are not a common occurance

DONATE
It never hurts to butter up your favourite deity, and donating a few silver
crowns  to  his  or  her  cause  is one of the best ways to do it, When you
select  Donate, you will be asked to enter your tithe in silver crowns, and
will remove the money from your packs

LEAVE TEMPLE
When  you've finished worship, select Leave Temple to return to the streets
of the city.

The Review Screen
-----------------

After youve rounded up your party and take a minute or two to review one of
your  characters  (just double click on their portrait), you'll notice that
he or she has several new attributes that weren't apparent during character
generation.   Additionally,  when  you  review your characters, you'll also
have new options available to you.

The  character  review  screen  shows you everything you need to know about
your  character,  and also allows for their feeding and care.  Nearly every
section of the review screen offers some kind of informtaion.

New Statistics
--------------

Once  characters  are  generated  and  have joined your party, they acquire
three  new,  secondary  statistics, each of which are seen in the character
review.

. Encumbrance (ENC): A character can only carry so much before his
  knees start to buckle and his back gives out. Encumbrance tracks this
  load, and tells you how many ounces of armour, weapons and supplies
  a character carries - At most, a character can carry 100 x strength (ST)
  ounces, However, characters who push the limit or exceed it are not
  able to move as quickly or as much, and lose movement points.

. Movement Points (MP): A character's movement points determine
  how far they can travel and how many actions they can perform in one
  round of combat. The higher the movement points the better
  Characters with low movement points may be carrying too much
  around.

. Armour Class (AR): A characters armour class shows you how well he
  or she is protected against a creatures attack. Armour class ranges from
  0 (stark naked) to 11 (scale mail over chain mail covered with plate
  armour and a bullet proof vest).

The Value Of Statistics
-----------------------

When  you  review your characters, you`ll notice that their statistics have
two values:  a base value and the current value.

. Base Value (right): The statistics normal level.
  This value changes only when characters gain a
  level. It serves as a reminder of the actual values peak level.

. Current Value (left): the current level of the
  statistic that changes as characters become hurt or
  suffer a malady or are influenced by magic, potions or herbs.

As characters travel through Arkania, the values for certain attributes may
change.   When  a  character is hurt by a monster, for instance, the actual
value  of  LP (life points) will decrease.  Other times, the atttibutes are
affected.    Charisma   for  example,  goes  down  when  characters  become
intoxicated.

Eating And Drinking
-------------------

After  a  hard  day's travel, your characters are hungry, their throats are
parched  and  they're  all  looking  forward  to  a good meal.  To serve up
dinner, just review your character.  Characters eat "rations," picnic style
meals with good helpings from each food group, Nearly every chandler's shop
offers rations, and your party may occasionally find several left behind by
wandering  groups  or  hunt  down  dinner in the wild.  Along with rations,
characters  take  water to soothe their palates.  Carrying their waterskins
everywhere,  characters  may  refill  their  skins  at the many streams and
rivers that weave through Arkania.
 
To  feed  your  characters  or to give them drink, pick up an approptiate
item  (a  waterskin  for example) from the inventory by clicking on it with
the  left mouse button.  Next click on the mouth icon and it hits the spot.
The characters hunger or thirst lines, depending on what you fed them, will
reflect  the  satisfaction  of  these  basic needs.  This icon is also used
should you wish to consume a herb or potion.

Unlike  Earth,  characters in Arkania can eat all they like withour gaining
weight  However  if  you  try  to  feed  a  character a something thats not
normally  eaten  (Thanks but I`ll pass on the filet of leather boot) Realms
will let you know.

Examining Items
---------------

To  look at an item in your character's possession, click on it followed by
the eye icon.  You will be told what it is, and what condition it is in.

Items In The Backpack
---------------------

Every Arkanian character has a backpack, a place where they can store up to
16  items.   By  left  clicking on an item to select it, it highlights red.
Characters  can  drop it, give it to another player or use it in some other
way.   Handling  items,  in all different ways, is covered later on in this
section under Review Options.

Items On The Body - Equipping Characters
----------------------------------------

In  addition  to  their backpacks characters may carry seven items on their
body.   These items are considered "equipped" and at the ready.  Obviously,
a  sword  in the backpack won't be nearly as as useful in combat as a sword
in  the hand (unless you fall backward onto a monster.  that is) Items such
as swords affect your character's performance in combat.

Items that cover parts of the body work to improve their armour class (AR).
Each  of  the seven carrying slots represents a part of the body.  To equip
your  character,  just  select  an  item from inventory, and drag it to the
approptiate  body  icon.   Boots,  for example, would go in the Foot Covers
icon.   Should  you  try to equip something your character can't wear, like
pants on his head, Blade will let you know.

The Left & Right Hand
---------------------

While most of the body icons are used for armour and clothing, the left and
right  hand  icons  have  a  special significance.  Only items in those two
boxes can be used instantly.

. Right Hand: The right hand is the weapon hand. This weapon will be at
  the ready should a monster approach. If characters don't have a weapon
  here and are attacked, they will have to arm themselves in the first
  round, losing precious time, or fight unarmed.

. Left Hand: The left hand is the potion, herb, shield or missile hand. The
  items in the left hand are held readied for use at a moment's notice
  during combat (for more information, see Use Item in the combat
  section).

Review Option
-------------

While  reviewing  your  character,  you  have  numerous  options aside from
equipping them or investigating their basic statistics.  To see the options
available  to  you, click the right mouse button You`ll see a menu box.  To
select any option highlight it and press the left mouse button.

. Change Name: Just as it implies you may rename your charcter by
  selecting this option

. Use Object: Some items can be used, like using a tinder box to light a
  torch or using a scroll by reading it. Select the item gfollowed by Use
  Object. If you select an item which cant be used like leather leggings
  Realms will let you know.

. Drop Object: If you're hoping to lower your encumbrance, or if your
  character is pack ratting a lot of junk, you can get rid of it using Drop
  Object. First, select the object you wish to drop, then select Drop
  Object. Items that are dropped are gone for ever. Just in case you made
  a mistake, Realms will ask you if you really want to Drop the item before
  it Disappears.

. Sickness: This Option will only appear on the menu if the character is ill
  After selecting it, you will receive information about the characters
  condition.

. Poisoning: This option will only appear on the menu if the character
  is actually poisoned. After selecting it, you will receive information 
  about the character's condition.

. Use Talent: Certain skills may be used while reviewing your Character
  Generally, these skills are of the healing variety, Treat Wounds for
  example. To use any of the skills available, just select it.

. Cast Spell: To have your character whip off a spell, select Cast 
  Spell. You will be asked to choose the spell group, followed by the 
  actual spell. In general healing or adventure type spells (like light
  spell) are the type that you would cast in review. Detonating a fire 
  ball into empty air, after all, could prove rather hazardous, not to 
  mention a waste of time. 

. ATT/PARRY Values: To toggle between the characters basic values
  and his/her Attack and Parry values select this option. This option
  is only available in the Advanced mode

. Skills: To review a characters skills, select the skill option. This 
  option is only available in the Advanced mode.

. Magic Skills: Magic skills allows you to review your characters magical
  proficiency This option is only available in the Advanced Mode.

. Exit: Selecting this option you leave the characters review and return,
  to the Main Screen.

Trading Items
-------------

That  wand your warrior found would certainly be better used in the handsof
your  Magicienne.   So  naturally he hands it over.  To trade items between
characters,  click  on the item to select it as your cursor.  The inventory
square  will  be  highlighted  in red.  Next, click on the arrows under the
character's  portrait until you reach the character you desire.  Once there
just  deposit  the  item  in  his  or her inventory by clicking on an empty
backpack  icon.  If you place the item over a full inventory spot, however,
the items will swap.

Merging Items
-------------

Items  that are alike and that can be grouped can be merged in Arkania.  To
merge  two items, like two rations for example, click on one item to select
it.   The cursor will shape itself as the ite m, and its inventory box will
be  highlighted  in red.  Next, click on the item to merge it with.  If the
items  may  be  merged, they will join together, occupying only one spot in
your character's inventory, If the items cannot be merged, you'll just swap
one for the other.

Managing Your Funds
-------------------

Arkania  is  an equal opportunity world.  All members of the party, man and
woman  alike  make  an equal amount of money for their efforts.  This money
goes  into  the  partys  coffer  with each character having an equal share.
When  your  party visits a merchant, this money goes into a community slush
fund,  allowing  the  party  to  pool their money for goods that need to be
purchased.

Main Play Screen
----------------

Steppin  out  into  the sunshine and fresh air, your party looks around and
takes  in all they have yet to explore.  welcome to Thorwal.  As you travel
this  town  as in any other town, the screen and options below will be your
guide.

Each  section of the Main Play Screen offers you a bit of information about
your  adventure,  takes  you to another place or allows you access to other
features

The  Main Window:  Through the main window you'll see everything around you
and to your sides.  Moving the mouse pointer up, down or to the sides shows
the directions you may travel, and a click will get you on your way.

Credits:   Click the Realms of Arkania Logo to reveal the people behind the
game.

Time:   Your  characters  have  places  to  go  and  things  to do, so they
naturally need a watch to go by.  As the days pass, you'll see the sun rise
and set; the moon will come to take its place Clicking on the time tracker,
will tell you the current day, month, year and time.

Direction  Indicator:   The compass tracks your every move and reports your
party's current bearing - North, South, East or West.

Location  &  Info:   The  program  allows  your party to know their current
whereabouts  whether  it be a town, Thorwal for example or a place within a
town,  Temple  of  Travia,"  and  reports  it  in the Location & Info line.
You'll also see other important messages here.
 
Character  Icon :  All characters in your party have their own icons that
show their most important attributes.  Besides a character's name, life and
astral points, an icon also has two other important functions:

Moving  a  Character:   Click  once on a characters icon and it will follow
your  mouse.   Now  click  again on another character's icon.  The two will
change places.

Reviewing  a Character:  To get the complete scoop on any character, double
click on the character's portrait to move to the character screen.  You may
review  your  character  almost  anytime during play.  For the complete run
down  on a character's review see "Reviewing Your Charac- ter" beginning on
page 29 of this manual.

NPC:  Occasionally a non-player character (NPC) may wish to join your party
for  a  stretch  of its adventure.  When you have such an NPC along, his or
her  icon  will  appear  here  (See  the Arkania's Residents section of the
manual for further information.)

Main Screen Options
-------------------

The  movers  and shakers of the main play screen are the Game Option Icons.
Here you can do almost anything.

Split  Team:  There are times when adventurers are torn between two or more
different  quests  that  call  their attention.  At other times it may be a
member  of  the  party  who is unable to travel.  Each seems important Each
warrents  attention.   Not a problem.  Split the team.  Realms allows.  you
to  separate  your party into two or more independant groups, each of which
travels  as they please.  Selecting this option you will see a list of your
current  perty  members.   Just  select  those  players  who  will form the
separate team.  When you opt to separate your group keep in mind:

1. You can control only one team at a time.

2. Active team members icons will appear as usual. Characters
   in other teams will have shaded icons.

3. Time passes simulaneously for the separate teams.

4. You can unite teams using the Unite Team option only
   when they are both at the same location.

5. Occasionally, splitting the team will allow the party to travel
   more quickly, and infinetly easier, than with a full team.

6. In the automap mode the team you`re not with will appear as a purple
   arrow.

Unite  Team:  It`s been a long hard road for both teams, and the reunion is
at  long last here.  When you`ve split your team, use the Unite Team option
to  re-group.   When  the two teams are at the same location the Unite Team
icon  will be available; at all other times, it is crossed out.  Just click
to join the two teams together.

Next  Team:   While your party is split, you can easily flip from one party
to another.  Clicking the Next Team icon you instantly join the other party
(at  which  point they put away their laptop and get ready for some serious
stuff).   if  your  party  is  split  into three or more groups this option
scrolls from one to another in the order they were split.

Game Options:  A click of this icon gets you behind the scenes and lets you
perform  several  game functions.  Moving to the book screen you`ll see the
time  and  date,  a  description of your current location and the following
game options:

Load Game:Just like the Temple options you can load a previously saved game
using this option.  Just select one from the menu of six saves.

Save  Game:  While out on an adventure, it is possible to save your game at
nearly everytime.  Just select this option to do so.  You will be presented
with  your  current  list  of saves.  Select one and rename it if you wish.
Caution:   Its  better  to save your game at a Temple found in nearly every
town  or  city.  Blade rewards players who brave it from town to town those
who  take  the  safe  approach  and  save  outside  of Temples will lose 50
experience points each time.
 
Erase  Character:   Select  this option to permanently remove a character
from the register.  You may only erase characters who are not in the party.
Erased characters are gone forever

Examine  Map:   As  your characters travel through Arkania.  they will come
across  numerous informative map fragments To view them select this option.
Display  the  map pieces your party currently possess are displayed and you
are shown where they fit into the overall, larger map.

View  Diary:  Your characters keep a log of their travels.  You may view it
any time by selecting View Diary.  You'll see a listing of their travels by
Date, month and location.

Adjust Performance:  An option that would have been ideal during final exam
time.   Adjust Performance allows you to slow down or speed up according to
your  system's  speed.  The default setting is 4.  Use setting 1 for faster
combat; use 10 to slow it down.

Toggle Sound:  When you just can't sleep but others can, this allows you to
turn its sound on and off

End  Game:   When  your  day in Arkania is at an end, select this option to
return  to  the  real  world.  This option does not save your Game.  Select
Save Game to do so.

Back To Game:  When you`ve finished saving your game, toggling the sound or
otherwise, click the right mouse button to return to your adventure.
 
Map:  While in towns and dungeons, your party's progress is automatically
tracked.   To  view  your  party's current automap, just select this option

While  in  Map  mode,  you  may scroll the map picture to the right or left
should  the  entire map be larger than your screen.  Just select either the
Move  Right  or Move Left icon to do so.  You may also click on the left or
right sides of the map itself.

Back to Game: Select this option to return to Arkania

Cast Spell:  While travelling in town, you may need to cast a healing spell
or  an adventuting spell.  Select the Cast Spell option to do so.  You will
be  asked  to select a character to cast the spell, its group and the spell
name.  (For further information on spells and their casting, see the Arcane
Lore section of the manual.)

Camp:  After a long day trekking through Thorwal's taverns, there's nothing
quite  like a good night's sleep.  When that urge to get some shut eye hits
your characters, click the Camp option.  Out come the sleeping bags as your
characters  drop  in  their  tracks.  remember however that sleeping in the
streets isnt always a good idea.  Aside from its effects on your reputation
as  respectable  heroes,  your  party  may  be  robbed  or otherwise rudely
awakened.

While  your  party  sits discussing the day's events, you will have several
options:

Set  Guard  Duty:   Since  sleeping  characters are all too easy a prey for
looters  and  other creatures of the night (or day, depending on how crispy
you  are),  setting  guard duty is an important task.  You will be asked to
assign  guards  for three different shifts (although the late shift gets no
overtime).   Naturally,  characters assigned to the various shifts will not
get  the  full  benefits  of  sleep  while  guarding.   Keep  in  mind that
characters with high intuition skills make the best guards.

Use  Talent:   While  sitting 'round the campfire, your Char- acters survey
their  wounds and hope for treatment.  By selecting the Use Talent option a
character  may treat others for poison, disease or wounds.  after selecting
the  desired action, you will be asked to select a character to perform the
treatment.   Remember,  characters  with the highest skill levels for Treat
Poison,  Treat  Disease  and  Treat  Wounds are the best performers for the
respective  malady.   In  fact  a  poorly  skilled character may worsen the
situation  by  injuring  the  patient further.  if you`re playing in Novice
mode  the  most  skilled  characters  name will highlight in yellow.  ln Ad
vanced  mode,  you  must  determine  the  best  character your self.  After
selecting  the healer, choose the one who is ill.  The character will apply
his art, and Blade will let you know the outcome.

Use Magic:  Just as in the main Cast Spell option, your characters can cast
day`s end spells while in camp.  You will be asked to select a character to
cast  the  spell,  its  group  and  the spell name.  Protective and healing
spells are especially popular with happy campers.  (For more information on
casting spells see the Arcane Lore section of the manual).

Sleep:   When  all  is  said  and done, the pillows hit the ground and your
characters  drift  off  for the night.  With a click on the Sleep icon, you
will  be  asked how long you want your characters to sleep.  With the hours
known,  your characters head off to la-la land and recieve sleeps potential
benefits;  Healing,  curing  of  sickness and an increase in the characters
astral points (AP)

Back  To  Game:  If you werent really tired after all, but merely wanted to
check  the  status  of your pillows, this option will return you to Arkania
and active adventure.

Pause:  If you need to pause game play at anytime, just press P.  Press any
other key to resume play.

Visit  Market:   Throughout  Arkanias  many  towns  and  cities you`ll find
numerous  vendors  peddling  their  wares  in the cities markets.  In their
booths  you  can find the finest in armour, herbs and other goods that your
party  may  need on an occassional or daily basis.  When you`re in the area
of  such  a  market, the Visit Market icon will be available otherwise this
icon will not appear.  When you opt to enter the market you will be shown a
menu  of  vendors  whose tables are out and about Select one to enter their
booth, Once inside, lots of options are available.

Visiting The Markets & Merchants
--------------------------------

Visiting  a  town's  market  is  often  the  highlight  of many adventures.
Sequestered  in box-filled booths, the vendors wait inside to offer you the
essentials  they have for sale, an inventory which changes as merchant sell
and  get new wares.  When your party enters a market area (see Visit Market
section  above),  the  Visit Market icon will be available.  Just click its
icon to see the vendors waiting for you.  Once you select a booth to enter,
the  browsing  begins, Entering a merchant's shop or a market booth, you'll
see the following options:

Buy Goods:  The merchant allows you to look at his or her wares.  The price
along  with  a picture of each item is shown.  The merchant also identifies
the  item  as  usable  (yellow)  or  unusable  (white) by highlight ing the
characters name.  Of course you`re welcome to take a look around.  Move the
cursor  box  over  an  item  to  see  its price and the item's name, On the
location  and Info line, you'll see:  0 Torch.  The "0" (zero) reflects the
number  of  items  cureently  in your shopping cart for purchase, and torch
tells  you  the  name  of the item.  If you`re interested in the item, just
click  on  it,  and the 0 will turn into a 1.  if you want to purchase two,
click again.  Another click will bring you to three and so on.  Should your
mouse  finger  get  a  bit over eager, just click the right mouse button to
return  an  item  to the shelf.  After you have finished with one item, you
may  move  onto  the  next,  and  make  your selections in the same manner.
Viewing  your  selections  is  just  as  easy.   Just move through the list
holding  the  pointer  over  items  to see 0 of this 2 of that and 1 of yet
another  item.   when you`ve finished making your selections on page one of
the merchants catalog you may move to page two.

Next/  Previous page:  If a merchant has a large selection of goods, it may
take more than one page to present it.  Selecting these options you move to
the next page or the previous page in the merchant's catalogue.

Haggle(PayForGoods):   With  items  in your cart you approach the merchant.
Since  he  or  she  is  the  owner and chief executive officer of this sole
proptietorship  (with no reporting to the taxman), the chance to dicker the
merchants  price  down  is available to your party.  When you select Haggle
you will be asked to enter the discount you`re hoping for and will show you
the  range  of  bearable discount.  After you enter the discount 10 for 10%
for  example,  select  a  person  to  do  the haggling.  Of course a person
skilled  in  Haggle  has  the best chance of making a favourable offer.  In
Novice mode will be highlighted the most skilled; in Advanced mode you have
to  select the character yourself.  With the offer made the vendor mulls it
over.   Depending on your tact, diplomacy and haggling skill, he or she may
accept it, grip at it or, after three insulting offers throw you out of the
shop.   Keep in mind that one ticked off merchant may pass word to another.
Of  course,  if  you feel the merchant's prices are good, or if you wish to
impress  him  or  her,  you  may enter "0" percent to purchase the items at
their shelf price

Leave:   When  you've  finished,  or if you are not interested in the items
offered, select Leave to return to the main market offerings.

Sell:   Maybe  you`re  hard  up  for  Ducats.  Perhaps you have one to many
daggers hanging around your belt.  Whatever the reason you`re interested in
selling  some of your items.  just click Sell followed by a character to do
so.   Soon  you`ll  see a catalogue of your characters items along with the
price  the  vendor is willing to pay you.  In most cases you`ll see several
silver  crowns,  however if the merchant isnt interested, he`ll offer 0 and
will  refuse  to  even  take  whatewver  it  is  off  your hands.  If youre
interested  in  selling  an item just click on it.  For multiple items five
food packets for example, the merchant will ask how many you wish to sell.

Next   /  Previous  Page:   Should  your  character  be  carrying  Arkanias
equivalent to Marks & Spancer, select next page to scroll through the pages
of  items  that  your character is carrying.  previous of course brings you
back.

Haggle:  Once you`ve selected the items you wish to sell, its the merchants
turn  to haggle your offer.  You`ll see his or her offer in the upper right
portion  of  the  screen,  and may take this opportunity to smooth talk him
into  offering  you  a better price.  He may think you`re dreaming when you
ask him to double his offer, but then again he may not.

Another  Character:  If another character wishes to sell items click on his
or her portrait to display the next characters wares.

Leave:  To return to the main market menu, select this option.

Talk:   Arkanias merchants see hundreds of folk every day.  Passing through
their  booths,  the  travellers speak of the tales they have heard while on
the  road,  people  they have spoken with and secrets they hope to uncover.
With  all  this  juicy  news  entering their ears, merchants tend to be the
biggest gossipers in town!  Just select Talk to get in on the action.  Many
times  the merchant will tell you of rumours hes heard.  Other times he may
become  irrated  at  something  offensive you`ve said.  And theres also the
merchants  who  having  spent  years in the market are tuned out to all its
hustle and bustle, and haven't taken in a thing to tell you.

Pick-pocketing A Merchant
-------------------------

If  you  're  a  bit  low  on  cash, you may be able to pickpocket the very
merchant  you're  trying to buy goods from!  Just review a character, right
click  to get the Options Menu select Use Talent and choose Pickpocket.  If
luck  is  with  you,  a  few  of  his or her coins may be yours, If you get
caught, though, it could cost you plenty.

Inns & Taverns
--------------

Arkania's  a world filled with wandering souls, traveling from town to town
to peddle their wares and purchase exotic goods not available on their home
soil.   So to is Arkania filled with hetmen, enterprising warlords who hire
the  brave  to embark on missions they can assign, but havent the mettle to
complete  alone  Around  such travelers, a cottage industry has sprung, and
your  party  will  find evidence of its succcss in virtually every town and
city they enter.

Inns  and  taverns  offer  a  soothing break for any adventurer.  For those
traveling  throughout Arkania's wilderness, the comfort of a soft bed and a
prepared  meal  are  worth twice the price of the ducats paid.  For others,
the  relaxed  conversation  flowing  in  a  town's tavern is welcome enough
change  from  the  campfire  conversations  of  Orc  raids and catastrophic
battles.   Some  adventurers  travel to a towns taverns and inns to collect
information,  and  those  enterprising enough may even be able to swindle a
few silver crowns from patrons.  When your party enters a tavern or an inn,
they'll have all these opportunities and more.

Talk:   Like merchants, the innkeepers and bartenders have seen their share
of  adventurers come and go.  Hidden beyond their entrepreneur - ial spirit
is often a blanket of information awaiting inquisitive visitors.  Selecting
this  option  you  may get the chance to discuss the local gossip.  However
dont  forget  the  barkeep  has a business to run, and doesnt usually stand
around for idle chat.

Eat  and  Drink:  Your characters may order a meal by selecting this option
The  innkeeper  will  tell  you  of the daily special along with his price.
Should you accept, and have the money to pay for it, the meal is served.

While  the  stout  might  be  flowing  like  Niagara, a word to the wise is
"moderation,"  Alcohol's  effects can go beyond medicinal, and too much can
leave  your  characters  without their wits.  Characters who drink too much
can  certainly become drunk and, just as in real life, may suffer temporary
losses  to  their  intelligence  and  charisma  and  other  typical drunken
effects.

Rent  a  Room:  Arkania's rooms range from your finest noble suites to "the
cot  in the closet" shacks.  Depending on your party's taste and funds, you
may  select  the room of your choice.  Room quality varies inn to inn, but,
in  general,  the  better  the  room  the  better the nights sleep (and its
restorative effects).  Selecting this option, the innkeeper will show you a
selection   of  available  suites,  and  will  allow  you  to  select  your
accommodation.   After  you've finished other bedtime tasks (using magic or
talents), select Sleep to head to your rooms for the night.

Use  Talent:  Depending on the inn or tavern and your characters abilities,
Use  Talent  offers  your  party  numerous  options.   From treat Wounds to
Alchemy.   Your  characters  may  perform  necessary  healing and quizzical
chemistry before heading off to bed.  Once you select a talent, you will be
asked  to  choose  a  character to work his or her art and let you know the
outcome.

Use  Magic:  Rolling her crystal ball side to side, your Magicienne watches
as  a  character  vainly  attempts to Treat Wounds to patch a badly wounded
arm.   A  simple spell would do, she knows, and although her magic power is
valuable,  she  weaves  the spell none the less.  Poof you're cured.  Along
with   spells   of  the  healing  variety,  magic  users  may  chant  their
incantations  in  the comfort of an inn.  Selecting this option you will be
asked to choose a character to work the magic, the spell group, and finally
the spell (For further information on magic, see the Arcane Lore section of
this manual).

Sleep:   Your  eyelids weigh a ton, it's been a long day, and it's time for
the  party  to  head to their suites for a little shut eye.  Just click the
Sleep  icon  to  do  so.   Once you select Sleep, provided you have already
booked a room, your party is whisked away by the bellman and brought to the
comfort  of  their  respective  rooms.   Your  party will sleep for as many
nights  as  they  have  paid  for, and will wake at dawn on the last day of
their  stay  Any  restorative  effects will be reported at the end of their
stay.   To  Arkania's  credit, your party does not have to tip the bellman,
nor  are  they  promised  one  of  those  continental  breakfasts,  usually
patterned after a Continent about the size of a ducat.

Leave:  Select this option to return to the out of doors.

Visit  Tavern:   Should  the inn have a tavern as part of the establishment
the  Visit  Tavern icon will be available.  Just select this option to move
into the bar

More Tavern Options
-------------------

Whether  your  party enters a tavern within an inn or a stand-alone saloon,
they  will have additional choices found nowhere else in Arkania.  Like the
gossip,  the  mead and stout flows freely in the taverns, just as it did in
medieval  Earth.   Stepping  up  to  the  bar,  your  party has several new
options.
 
Use  Talent:   In addition to treating wounds, taverns offer your charac-
ters  a  chance to show off some of their more, well, enterprising talents,
While  playing in Novice mode, the best character for the particular talent
will highlight in yellow.

1.  Cheat:  Maybe its a new card trick you learned or one of those I`ll bet
you  that  you  can`t  deals.   Whatever  the  case, Cheat puts one of your
characters  into  action.   Selecting  the character he or she performs the
handiwork  and Blade lets you know the outcome.  Naturally, characters with
the  Cheat skill tend to perform better than those without agile hands.  If
all  goes well a few Silver crowns may come your way.  Should you be caught
in the midst of your trickery, however your party could find themselves out
on  the  street without hopes of entering the establishment again for quite
some time.
 
2.   Acrobatics:   For  those characters skilled in such a talent, a good
show  could  prove profitable.  When you select this option, you choose the
agile  character for such a task.  After the performance, money or boos are
delivered as deserved.

3  Instrument:   Bards are often a welcome sight in Arkania, their melodies
taking  the  battle  worn patrons to relaxing places far removed from their
hectic day-to-day life.  Should your character be skilled in such a talent,
and  if  an instrument is at hand, such a rhapsody could earn the party its
keep.   After  selecting  Instrument and a character to perform, Blade lets
you  know  the  outcome.  As with Acrobatics, cheers and money or cat calls
(if you're really bad) are delivered as warranted by the performance.

Visit  Inn:  If the tavern is part of a larger establishment, you will have
the chance to return to the Inn, Select the Visit Inn icon to do so.

Visiting A Healers Shop
-----------------------

Your Magician's astral points are wiped out and your most skilled healer is
still  trying to shake arrows out of her arm.  It's a tough situation to be
in.   If a character lets a wound go too long, he or she will llkely become
infected  or  diseased  Thankfully,  towns  throughout  Arkania  offer  the
services  of  healers  who  can help your party heal its wounds.  When your
party enters a healer's shop, you'll have a selection of these options.

Treat  Wounds:   After a vicious battle, your proud but worn characters may
have  a  few  wounds  that  need  tending.   Selecting  treat  Wounds and a
character  in  need, the healer surveys his or her damage, notes the price,
and allows you to accept or reject his proposal.  Should you hand over your
crowns,  the  healer begins to work his trade.  Hopefully, if the healer is
skilled, he or she will heal your character.  Certain healers however, have
no medical talent but use the healer banner merely to make money

Treat  Illness:  Characters may incur numerous maladies in Arkania Luckily,
skilled  healers  can offer the proper cure for most any illness Should one
of your characters require such an elixir, select Treat Illness followed by
the  ill  character.   While  the  healer  reviews  symptoms  and  the work
necessary  to cure it, he'll quote you a price which you may take or leave.
Should  you  accept, the mystic begins his handiwork.  If he is successful,
the  fee is collected in full.  If however, the cure is not successful, the
healer will only charge you a portion of his quoted price

Neutralize Poison:  Along with wounds and illnesses, many healers can treat
poison and neutralize its devastating effects.  Just select this option and
the  afflicted  character,  and  the  healer  will suggest a price.  If you
accept,  he  begins  his  work.   As  with  illnesses, if the healer is not
successful, he or she will only ask for a portion of the total amount due.

Leave  Healer:   When  your  characters have been nursed, and their ills no
longer affect them, select this option to return to the out of doors.

Blacksmith Shop
---------------

From  battle to battle, warriors, swords suffer wear and tear.  Their edges
grow  dull and eventually, they may break.  Armour, too, can be broken from
a  strong  blow  Needless  to  say, a breast plate hanging in pieces from a
character's  shoulders  doesn't  do much to protect him; it would, however,
make a nice wind chime.  If your characters' goods are in such a shape, get
them  to  a  smith  to  make  the  repairs  Entering the smith's shop, your
characters will have numerous options:

Talk:   Having  seen  the  battle-worn  pass through their doors smiths can
offer the party a tale or two about combat around the area or an inside tip
on  the  best  way to use a weapon.  The weapons traders who frequent their
establishment  also  leave  behind their news, and the smith might pass the
information along to you .....if he takes a liking to you that is.

Have  Something  Repaired:  That fine two-handed sword you're carrying ....
the  hilt  in one hand the blade in the other....  isnt going to do ypou or
your party much good in combat, although it would make a divine shish-kebab
stick.  To have your sword or armour fixed, select Have Something Repaired.
You  will  see  a list of the characters items and the cost to repair each.
Select  one,  and the smith will quote you his fee.  Whenever money changes
hands, the options don`t stop there.

Haggle:   Think  he`s asking too much to put your armour back together?  If
you  do,  select  haggle,  a  character to do it and finally the percentage
reduction  you`re  looking  for.   If the merchant agrees to your offer, he
will  begin  work.  Of course you may enter 0 if you feel he`s giving you a
good  deal  to  begin with.  Keep in mind that metalwork, like any trade is
not  exacting  nor  does  it happen at the speed of light.  You may have to
leave  your  weapon,  and there is a chance that upon returning you'll find
your  sword or armour is beyond repair or at least beyond the skills of the
smith you're working with.

Next  Page and Previous Page:  If your character is carrying lots of items,
Next  Page will move you further into his inventory.  Previous Page returns
you to the previous page.

Another  Character:   Sometimes your journey has been so long, your battles
so hard, that numerous characters come back with their armour and swords in
pieces, Select the Another character option to bring your characters before
the smith one by one

Exit:  Select Exit to return to the Main Smith options

Leave  The  Smith:   When  you've  finished tending to your swords' wounds,
select Leave The Smith to return to the streets of town

Leaving Town
------------

Your  party has had its fill of town life, and they're itching to be off on
a  more  urgent  quest.   To leave any town, just look for a signpost or an
exit  inside a building (check the AutoMap for a bright orange square), and
you'll  be on your way.  See the Leaving Town:  Ports and Trails section of
this manual for further information.
 
DUNGEONS
--------

Dungeon Options
---------------

Entering  an  otherwise  Normal apartment, you spy a set of stairs.  In all
likelihood  you know, they lead to an underground cavern of some sort.  You
pull a torch from your pack and nervously head down the stairs.

As your party travels through Arkania, you'll come across many dungeons and
caves  just  like  this.  In addition to many of the options covered in the
Game  Options section, like Split and Unite Team, your party will also have
several new options,

Map:  While similar to the map you see in cities, dungeon maps use slightly
different  colouring,  and  only  show  the level of the dungeon your party
currently occupies.  The colours for the map are covered in the map section
of Game Options.

Open  Door:   The old oak is worn, heavy with exposure to the dungeons damp
air.   Your  party stands before it wondering what it conceals....  or what
it  holds back.  Click the Open Door icon to let yourself in.  Some times a
door may be locked, however.  Should you attempt to open a locked door, you
will be presented with the folIowing options:

Break Door Down:  Two of your strongest characters take the front positions
in the party (you may need to move them there) and prepare to slam into the
doors  centre.   Depending  on  the solidity of the door (after all no ones
going  to  break through a 10 foot thick steel plated door), your party may
succeed,  opening  the  pathawy.   Doors  which  are  broken down cannot be
closed.   If  your  characters were particularly strong theres probably not
much left to close anyway.

Pick  The Lock:  Pulling a set of lockpicks from his pocket your Rogue will
need  to move to the front of the party tpo begin work on his exacting art.
Depending  on the complexity of the lock and your Rogues skill you may hear
that fateful click and watch as the door slides open before you.

Cast  Foramen  Spell:   The  rest  of your party moves aside as one of your
magic users begins to weave the incantation that will hopefully get you by.
If  successful,  the lock is magically altered, and will remain permanently
unlocked.

Close  Door:   Your  party  barrels  down a hall with 50 different forms of
dungeon  denizens  hot  on  its trail.  Finally, you reach a room, open the
door  and run inside.  The last thing you want to do is leave the door open
behind you!  Select Close Door Instead.

Open  Chest:  It's a happy sight for tired and battle worn eyes.  It`s what
you've come so far and found so hard to achieve .....  the trinkets nestled
safely  in  a  treasure  chest.  When your party finds a chest, just select
Open Chest to attempt to get inside to the goods.  Just like Open Door, the
character  at  the  front  of  the  party flips the lid on the chest, so if
something blows, it'll be in his or her face.

Travelling Tips
---------------

While exploring dungeons, keep these things in mind:

. Put your character with high perception, strength and agility
  in the front of your party. They`ll have the best chance to
  notice traps before there set off and will be able to open doors
  with a shove

. Most dungeons are not lit. Be certain you`re carrying torches
  or a lantern and a tinder box to light them. Magically gifted
  characters may also light the way with a Fiat Lux spell or
  Magicians may magically charge their wand to contain an
  automatic, inextingushable light spell.
