    THAI BOXING
    
    Documentation for Thai Boxing:
    
    Thai Boxing combines the lightening-fast movement of karate with the
    brute strength of boxing.  In this sport there is only one aim, to
    inflict as much punishment as possible in the shortest amount of time. 
    The face of your boxer will show the punishment he receives at the
    hands of his opponent.  The cuts, bruises, and the bloody nose as the
    knock-out punch lands are all shown in excruciating detail.
    
    There are six levels of play and each level gets progressively more
    difficult.  You can only get to the next level by reducing your
    opponent's stamina to zero.  If you defeat your opponent before the
    counter reaches zero, bonus points will be added to your score.  Each
    level consists of three rounds, each lasting one minute.  Stamina is
    displayed by the two colored bars at the top of the screen, one for
    each player.  Each kick or punch landed causes a reduction of stamina. 
    It is a good idea to move back if you are under a sustained attack, in
    order to recoup some of your lost stamina.  However, be careful that
    your opponent does not use this opportunity to deliver a deadly flying
    kick.
