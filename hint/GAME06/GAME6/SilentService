Loading Instructions
  Amiga
    Start your Amiga with Kickstart 1.1 or higher, the eject the disk and 
insert Silent Service. It will load automatically. Leave the disk in the 
drive during the game. You can use either the mouse (port 1) or a joystick 
(port 2) to play the game.
  Atari ST
    If your computer already has TOS in ROM, simply place the Silent Servive
 disk in your computer and turn it on. Leave the disk in the drive during 
play.
    If you have an early version ST with no ROM TOS chips, insert your Atari
 TOS disk in the drive first, then turn on the computer. When the desktop 
appears, remove the TOS disk and insert the Silent Service disk. Then press 
the ESC key to display the contents of the disk. When the contents appear, 
use the left button to double-click on the folder called AUTO. The AUTO 
folder will open to show a program called SERVICE.PRG, double-click on this 
program and the game will start.
   IBM PC or TANDY 100
     NOTE:Your IBM PC must have a color graphics card to play this game. You
may use either keyboard or joystick to play.
     Place the game disk in your drive and turn on the computer. The disk 
will boot automatically. Leave the disk in during play.

OPTIONS
  Upon loading, you will be allowed to select the senario, options, and 
skill factors you wish to use.
Scenarios

   There are three types of scenarios. "Torpedoe/Gun Practice" places you 
outside the American base at Midway Island. Four old cargo ships are 
anchored there as torpedoe and gunnery practice targets. The second set of 
scenarios: "Convoy Actions", recreate various actual submarine attacks on a 
convoy. "War Patrols", allow you to command an entire patrol, beginning at 
the submarine bases at Midway, Brisbane, or Fremantle; continuing through a 
number of convoy actions; and concluding with a return to base.

Skill Levels
   You may select from one of four skill levels: "MIDSHIPMAN", "LIEUTENANT",
 "COMMANDER", or "CAPTAIN". The skill level affects the accuracy of torpedo 
runs, damage sustained from depth charges, the skill of enemy lookouts and 
sonar operators, as well as other factors.

Reality Levels
   In addition, you may customize the similation with various "reality 
levels". Each level introduces an element which makes the similation both 
more realistic and more diffilcult. To select the reality levels, use the 
joystick to mve the flashing asterisk and press the trigger to toggle the 
YES/NO indicator or use the left button on the mouse to toggle the levels 
on and off.
  1) Limited Visibility
If this level is selected enemy ships which are beyond radar/sonar range 
will not appear on the map displays. Enemy ships which were detected but 
have moved out of range will blink slowly at their last known position. 
If this level is not selected, all enemy ships will appear on the map 
displays requardless of their range or location.
  2) Convoy Zig-Zags
If this level is selected enemy convoys will "zig-zag"(change course) at 
regular intervals. If this level is not selected, cargo ships will steam 
straight ahead unless they are attacked by torpedoes or encounter land 
masses.
  3) Dud Torpedoes
If this level is selected some of your torpedoes may be duds, especially 
during the years 1942-1943. Dud torpedoes may hit the enemy but will not 
explode, only the splash will be seen.
  4) Port Repairs Only
If this level is selected repairs will no longer be accomplished 
automatically while in battle or on patrol. Once an item of major equipment 
is damaged, it may not be repaired.
  5) Expert Destroyers
If this level is selected certain enemy convoys will be escorted by 'expert'
destroyers. These escorts are more persistant and have better trained sonar 
operators.
  6) Convoy Search
If this is selected convoys will not always appear within radar range. You 
will need to search them out. Far off convoys are best sighted by performing
a 360 degree periscope/binocular sweep of the horizon.
  7) Angle-on-the-Bow Input
If this level is selected the computer will no longer calculate the 'Angle-
on-the-Bow' for torpedo shots. You must enter the angle yourself based on 
periscope observations. Be sure you understand the workings of the Torpedo 
Data Computer before attempting this level. Recommended for experienced 
players only.


Instruments and Gauges
  This screen displays vital status information. The straight up position 
for all gauges represents a zero value, with increasing values in the 
clockwise direction. The primary instruments and gauges are:
a) BATTERY LEVEL- Shows how much electicity is remaining. The battery is 
used for submerged running and is gradually recharged while on the surface 
so don't be cruising all the time underwater for if it runs out, you will 
be unable to move save for up and down.
b) BATTERY CHARGE LIGHT- indicates the battery is being charged
c) BATTERY IN USE LIGHT- indicates the battery is being drained.
d) SPEED- indicates speed of sub. Max suface speed is 20 knots and max speed underwater is 10.
e) DEPTH- indicates current depth. Periscope depth is 44 feet or less.
f) PERISCOPE INDICATOR- guess what this does??
g) TORPEDO READY INDICATOR- shows how many are ready for firing. Green 
indicates ready and red means not ready. Reloading is done automatically 
and requires about 10 game minutes per tube.
h) FUEL LEVELS- Another puzzling instrument. See if you can figure it out!
i) DEPTH UNDER THE KEEL- a gauge showing the depth from your sub to the 
ocean floor. When this gauge reads zero you will run aground. Max reading 
is 500 feet.
j) WATER TEMPERATURE- shows temp of water outside sub. A blue dial hand 
indicates that the sub is below a thermal gradient layer.
k) CHRISTMAS TREE- light indicating the status of all hull openings. Green 
means open. These are closed automatically when you dive.
l) COMPASS- ???/
M) THROTTLE- 0-4 setings. Shows speed of craft.
n) CLOCK- shows time of day
o) DIVE BUBBLE- a horizontal tube showing whether the sub is diving or 
surfacing.

Damage Reports Battle Station
 This screen indicates the nature of any damage to the submarine. Damage 
may be caused by depth charge attacks or enemy gunfire. Types of damage 
include:
1) Bow/Aft torpedo damage: these torpedo doors have been damaged. The 
torpedoes will not fire.
2) Periscope damage: the periscope housing has been damaged. It cannot be 
lowered or raised.
3) Dive Plane Damage: the bow and stern dive planes have been damaged. The 
sub will only dive or surface at half its normal rate.
4) Fuel Leaking: the external fuel tank are leaking. Fuel will be consumed 
at twice the normal rate. In addition, fuel rising to the surface will make 
the sub easier to detect by enemy destroyers.
5) Engine damage: the main diesel engines are damaged. Speeds are reduced 
by half.
6) Machinery Damage: internal pumps and engines are damaged. The extra noise
will make the enemy's sonar tracking easier.
7) Battery Damage: batteries are used at twice the normal rate.

If the "PORT REPAIRS ONLY" reality level is not selected, repairs are attempted by the crew automatically.
If your sub is taking on water, the leakage rate is indicated in gallons per
second (GPS). Leakage will often cause your sub to decend, although the dive
planes may be able to counter-act the dive. This information is provided in 
the top right hand side of the Damage Reports Screen.
