SECTION 1 - IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------------------

MEMORY
Dawn Patrol requires at least 1 MB of memory to run successfully.If your machine
has only 1 MB of memory, you will not be able to make use of any additional disk
drives. (Simply disable/disconnect). If your machine has more than 1 MB, you may
be able to take advantage of the MUSIC option on the Preferences screen.

Before playing Dawn Patrol,ensure that the power for your Amiga has been off for
at least a minute.  This will minimise the chance of your Dawn Patrol disks
becoming infected with a virus and should effectively clear/defragment the 
memory.


MAKING A USER DISK
Before playing Dawn Patrol from floppy disk, you are advised to make a USER disk
to save Preferences and Pilot Biographies - See Appendix B of this guide.

ON-DISK PROTECTION
The enclosed disk 1 of 3 is copy-protected. If you intend to play the game from 
a floppy-drive, please ensure that you use your original disk 1 when booting the
game.  You may however, make a single user copy of disk 2 and 3 since these are
accessed frequently for individual parts of the game.

USER GUIDE ADDENDUM
The enclosed User Guide is based on the IBM PC version of the game however much 
of the information is essential to the Amiga version also. Please ignore 
references to IBM PC/CD-ROM - These will include the following:-

Double click the 'Dawn Patrol Disk1' icon and then the 'HD-Install' icon. Soon
after this you will be presented with the Installation Window.Using the keyboard
and the mouse, change the Hard Disk partition and path to read your desired
destination.

eg. WORK:GAMES/PATROL

Once the program has successfully installed, follow the on-screen prompts to 
begin the game.

FLOPPY DRIVE USERS

The program will prompt you to insert other disks when required.


APPENDIX A - CONTROLS
---------------------

CONTROLLING THE INTERACTIVE BOOK
The interactive book in Dawn Patrol can be controlled using your mouse and/or
keyboard - The TAB key (and SHIFT TAB) will move between the selectable items 
and the RETURN/ENTER key (left mouse button) can be used to make your 
selections. The joystick is not available as an option for this part of the 
game.

IN-FLIGHT CONTROLS
Options for in flight control are listed below and are obtainable by selecting 
the Preferences screen or by pressing F10 in-flight. Additional keys will be 
required for in flight views and options. These keys are listed as a chart on 
pages 6-8 of this guide.

Keyboard
Mouse
Joystick
Gravis (Mouse stick) - Remember to have the Mouse stick in Port one of your 
Amiga.

Analogue - This will allow you to configure your Analogue joystick. Once this
option is selected you will not need to select it again, unless you have 
restarted Dawn Patrol.

Recalibrate - This option allows you to change your previous Analogue joystick
settings. It can be selected as many times as you wish.

Some keys have been duplicated for the A600 machine.

APPENDIX B -SAVING/LOADING
--------------------------

If you intend to play the game from the floppy drive, you are strongly advised 
to make a USER disk before booting the game. This will enable you to save and
restore Pilot Biographies and Preferences, however, it is not essentlal to play
the game.

To create a USER disk simply format a disk using Workbench and rename the disk 
as USER.This name is essential for Dawn Patrol to recognise it for this purpose.

The SAVE and LOAD selections can be made on the following pages of the 
interactive book-

Page 1   - Contents Page
Page 94  - Pilot Biographies Page
Page 159 - Preferences Page

Clicking on SAVE or LOAD on any one of these three screens will account for both
Pilot Biographies and Preferences. You do not have to save or load these
individually.

If you are running the game from a Hard-Disk, you will not be prompted for a 
USER disk.

PREFERENCES
The following options are available on the Preferences Screen.

Distant 3D   On/Off
Roads        On/Off
Trenches     On/Off
Rivers       On/Off

The options below may not be available if your Amiga does not contain enough 
free memory or a 68020 or higher.

Land Detail    High/Medium/Low

guide.


APPENDIX C - TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------------

Problem:  'Failed to install CIA timer interrupt.  Please refer to technical
          information'

Solution: If you have an Amiga CD-ROM drive on your machine, it is likely you 
          have installed driver software on your hard disk to run it. You will 
          have to remove this software before you can run Dawn patrol. If you 
          are unsure how to do this please contact the Empire Interactive 
          technical support line.

Problem: 'Memory has become too fragmented to continue...'

Solution: This problem should only ever occur if you have been playing for 
          several hours. It would then be neccessary to reset your machine as 
          detailed in the 'Important Notes' section of this guide.

Problem:  After inserting disk One, the game fails to load.

Solution: Please ensure that your Amiga has 1Mb or FREE memory and that you are
          using your original copy of disk 1. If the disk still fails to load,
          this is likely to be caused by a defective disk. In this case, please
          return the offending disks only to our customer services department.
          The address can be found on your warranty card.
