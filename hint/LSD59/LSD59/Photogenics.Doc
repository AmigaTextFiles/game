System Requirements/Recommendations
-----------------------------------

Minimum System:      Kickstart 3.0 and 2Mb RAM.
Recommended  System: AGA  or  graphics display card, 4Mb RAM and a Hard
                     Drive.

Users  with  only 2 Megabytes of RAM should be aware that memory will be
very  tight  when  running Photogenics.  Picture size and number of open
images will be severly limited and render some operations impossible.

Installation
------------

Floppy disk users

1. Boot  from  your  Workbench  3.0 disk and insert the Photogenics
   Program disk.

2. Open the disk icon and double-click on the "Photogenics" icon.

Photogenics  will  now  load.  Please note that this may require several
disk swops depending on whether there is an external drive present.

Hard disk users

1. Open  the  disk icon ond double-click on the "Install Photogenics"
   icon.

2. Follow the instructions given on screen.

Included  with  the  installation  is  a  last  minute changes file that
documents  any features that were implemented at the last minute and did
not  make  it  to  this manual.  Please read this as it may also include
essential information.


Introduction to Photogenics
---------------------------

Photogenics  is the first full 24-bit painting program allowing the user
to  spray  special effects onto images.  Many other packages are limited
to  applying  effects  to  the whole screen - not to selected areas with
such  versatility  and subtlety.  An image might be perfect except for a
section  that needs sharpening or darkening for example.With Photogenics
this  operation  is simple - just select the desired effect and spray on
with the airbrush, draw with pencil or chalk pastel.

Photogenics  provides  many  different  drawing   tools   to   give your
compositions  a  real  life  look and feel.  If you are unhappy with the
result  then  change  the effect or the colour - Photogenics will "redo"
your  image ond you can see your changes immediately.  If you have found
that you have overdone the painting you can "spray back" to the original
image using the right mouse button easily removing the "paint".

An  explanation  of  24-bit  graphics  and  image processing is given in
Appendix  1.    This is suggested reading for users who are not familiar
with computer graphics.

Tour for Beginners
------------------

This tour is intended for Amiga beginners and casual users.

Experienced Amiga users should skip to the Tour for Experienced Users in
the next chapter which is essentially the same as this chapter but there
is no extra explanatory text.

Some  things may be a little unusal at first - if you find anything that
you  don't  understand then please read the 'common problems' section in
the back of this manual.

Upon starting Photogenics, the program will open it's own screen with an
about  information  window.    Click  the left mouse button to enter the
program.

Let's create a picture within the program:

1.    Select  the "Open as/Other" option which appears under the Project
menu or hold down the right Amiga key and press 'L'.

A  list  will  open  showing  the  many  different types of loaders that
Photogenics can use.

2.    Click on the "Plasma" item in the list.

The  Photogenics  size  requester will appear.  From this you can select
the size of Plasma to create.  Lets create a small one for now -

3.    Move  the  sliders  by holding down the left mouse button when the
pointer is over the "knob" in the slider and moving the mouse.  Make the
X and Y numbers indicate approximately 100.

4.    Click  on OK and a progress indicator will appear showing how long
the  loader  will take to complete.  This can be interrupted by clicking
on CANCEL - let's allow this one to finish.

When  complete  you  should see your first Photogenics image appear in a
window - a 24 bit colour plasma.

You  hove  seen  just  one of the powerful features of Photogenics which
allows you to create the program with no effort at all.

There  are  a  number  of  similar loaders to Plasma which create images
rather  than  load them from disk.  These can be used to generate images
in their own right or as ways to add special effects to other images.

We  can  paint  on your plasma by holding down the left mouse button and
drawing  over  the  window.    The  colour  shown in the Toolbox will be
applied  with the default drawing tool - Airbrush.  The Airbrush applies
your  colour  in the same way as a real airbrush does - a smooth flow of
paint  that  increases the longer you hold it.  It also has smooth edges
so  you can blend colours into each other.  Using the right mouse button
we  can "un-spray".  This can be used to remove any paint we have added.

Another powerful feature is the ability to change the colour of the area
we  have just painted.  Open the Palette by clicking on the colourbox in
the  Toolbox  or selecting it from the Windows menu.  Here we choose the
colour to paint with.

Colours  can  be  chosen  using  RGB  (Red,  Green,   Blue),   HSB (Hue,
Saturation,  Brightness)  or CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) colour models -
dont  worry  about these for the moment because you have a large list of
colours  to  choose from and a colour wheel where you can see the colour
you  want.    Spray some colour onto your image.  Now select a different
colour  and  click  on the Use button in the Palette window.  You should
see the area you painted change to the new colour.

When  you are happy with the paint you have applied then clicking on the
FIX  button in the toolbox will make our changes permanent.  You can now
choose a different colour and paint with that over the first colour.

Please  note  that  after  FIXing, we cannot remove paint with the right
mouse button or change the colour of that paint.

Close the plasma image by clicking on the top left of the window.

Let's load a picture from disk:

1. Select Open from the Project menu.

2. Choose the Girl.JPG image from the list that appears.

3. Click on OK.

4. Photogenics will load the image and you will see a face appear in a
   window.
   
5. Apply some paint to the face with the left mouse button.

   Don't forget we can remove paint with the right mouse button.

   Let's change the way that the paint is applied to the image:

6. Click on the Mode button in the Toolbox.

   A window will appear showing all the different ways that paint can
   affect your image.

7. Choose Negative.

   This works just like a photographic negative, making all your colours
   "opposite" - blue becomes yellow, green becomes magenta etc.

8. Add or remove more paint.

9. Click on the Mode button again and choose Tint.

Every time we change the Mode, Photogenics will "redo" the paint we have
applied  with  the  new  effect.    Tint has a kind of transparency that
allows us to see the original image under the paint we have applied.

This  tour  is finished now.  You may continue adding/removing paint and
changing  the  mode.    Experiment  -  some  things may look better than
others.    Remember that once you are happy with an effect then you must
FIX it.  Then you can add some more paint and a different effect.


Tour for Experienced Users
--------------------------

This  quick tour will give experienced users a brief overview of some of
the features of Photogenics.

Some  things  may be a little unusal at first- if you find anything that
you  don't  understand then please read the 'common problems' section in
the back of this manual. 

Start  Photogenics  and  we'll  begin  by  creating a picture within the
program.

1. Select the Loaders option which appears under the Windows menu.

2. Click on the Plasma loader.

3. Move the sliders in the size requester so both the X ond Y numbers
   indicate opproximately 100.

4. Click on OK.

When  complete  you  should see your first Photogenics image appear in a
window - a 24-bit colour plasma.

You  have  seen  just  one of the powerful features of Photogenics which
allows  you  to create images within the program with no effect at all. 
There  are  a  number  of  loaders similar to Plasma which create images
rather  than  load  them.  These can be used to generate images in their
own right or as ways to add special effects to other images.

Paint  can be applied to the plasma image with the left mouse button and
removed  with the right button.  The colour shown in the Toolbox will be
applied  with  the  default drawing tool airbrush.  The Airbrush applies
your  colour  in the same way as a real airbrush does - a smooth flow of
paint  that  increases the longer you hold it.  It also has smooth edges
so you can blend colours into each other.

Another powerful feature is the ability to change the colour of the area
we  have just painted.  Open the Palette by clicking on the colourbox in
the  Toolbox  or selecting it from the Windows menu.  Here we choose the
colour  to  paint  with.    Colours can be chosen using RGB (Red, Green,
Blue)  or  HSB  (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) colour models.  Spray some
colour  onto your image.  Now select a different colour and click on the
Use  button  in the Toolbox.  You should see the area you painted change
to the new colour.

When  you are happy with the paint you have applied then clicking on the
FIX  button in the toolbox will make our changes permanent.  You can now
choose a different colour and paint with that over the first colour.

Please  note  that  after  FIXing, we cannot remove paint with the right
mouse button or change the colour of that paint.

Close the plasma image and we will load a picture from disk:

1. Select Open from the Project menu.

2. Choose the Girl.JPG image from the list that appears.

3. Apply some paint to the face with the left mouse button.

   Let's change the way that the paint is applied to the image :

4. Click on the Mode button in the Toolbox.

5. Choose Negative.

6. Add or remove more paint.

Note  that  we are now applying a different sort of paint that is making
the image Negative.

7. Choose Tint.

Every time we change the Mode, Photogenics will "redo" the paint we have
applied  with  the  new  effect.    Tint has a kind of transparency that
allows us to see the original image under the point we have applied.

This  tour  is finished now.  You may continue adding/removing paint and
changing  the  mode.    Experiment  -  some  things may look better than
others.    Remember that once you are happy with an effect then you must
FIX it.  Then you can add some more paint and a different effect.


General Theory
--------------

Photogenics  works  a little differently to conventional paint and image
processing  programs.  When you apply paint to an image it is drawn into
a  separate  "paint  layer" that is then combined with the image to give
the image you see on screen.  To permanently combine this layer with the
image  you  need  to FIX your changes making them permanent and clearing
the  layer  so  you  can  apply  more  effects.  This system gives great
flexibility  for  applying   and   removing   paint   and   changing the
effect/colour  of the paint to see what the final result will look like.

To  give  an example, you may wish to alter the skin tone of a digitised
image of a friend.  You could start by selecting a dark tone and drawing
over the face with the Tint effect.  The affected area can be constantly
revised by adding/removing paint with the left and right mouse button.

After  covering  the whole face you may find that the tone is too dark. 
At  this point, before FIXing, you can alter the chosen colour or effect
to  give  different  results.    You may wish to try some of the special
effects  such as Solorize to see what that would look like.  All this is
possible with Photogenics.  Once a satisfactory effect has been achieved
then the changes can be FIXed.

Transparency/Pressure
When  applying  paint, some effects can be too conspicuous.  This can be
lessened  by  increasing  the level of transparency allowing some of the
original image to be seen underneath the new paint.

Secondary Buffer
Some effects require you to have a picture in the secondary buffer.  The
obvious  example of this is Rub-Thru.  This enables you to paint through
from your selected image to the image in the secondary buffer.

Alpha Channels
An  Alpha  channels  is  a mask that sits over your image.  Any paint or
effects you apply will only affect the parts of the image not covered by
the alpha channel.  Paint will affect the current image in proportion to
the brightness of the alpha channel.

See the tutorials section for information on how to use alpha channels.

Compose
Photo_montage  can  be  easily  achieved with the Compose function.  The
following procedure should be used when composing:

1.    Put image to be pasted from into secondory buffer by selecting Use
      As  Secondary  from the Options menu, or by moving the images icon
      into the Secondary box on the Images window.

2.    Select  the image to paste onto by clicking in the title bar or by
      clicking on its icon.

3.    Select Compose from the Windows menu.

A  window will appear with two radio buttons and OK/Abort.  The image in
the  secondary buffer will appear over the primary image with handles on
each  of  the  corners and in the centre.  The image can be resized with
the corner handles and moved with the centre one.

When the image to be posted is in the desired place:

4.   Click on Fade In/Out.

5.   Activate  the picture window by clicking on its title bar with the
     left mouse button.

6.   Use the right mouse button to reveal the old image underneath.

At  any time during Compose, the mode can be swapped between Edit Points
and Fade In/Out but any fading will be lost once the image is resized or
moved.

When  the  desired  effect has been achieved, click on OK in the Compose
window.  Abort will clear the image and end Compose.

Undo
Photogenics  has  an  undo  feature which allows the removal of previous
FIXed changes.  Selecting Undo a second time will replace the changes.

Please note that this option has no effect on the paint layer!


Reference
---------

Almathera  has tried to make Photogenics adhere to the Amiga Style Guide
dictated  by Commodore.  This enforces a standard user interface for all
programs  making  learning  a new package as easy as possible.  All menu
options with three periods after the name indicate that a requester will
open.    An  absence  of  the  periods indicates that the operation will
happen with no further input from the user.

To  only  paint  on  the red channel, ensure only the Red box is ticked.
Test  will  apply  this  to  the  current point to give a preview of the
effect.    Each image remembers whether its red, green, or blue channels
are active.  An indication of the channels for the active image is given
in the title bar.

Compose
Please refer to the special section on Compose.


Brush Menu

Choose Brush
Open  brush  list.  Changing between some brushes will require the image
to  be  FIXed.    This  is  a necessary inconvenience due to the way the
brushes work.

Brush Settings
Open  brush  settings window.  Size is relative to the resolution of the
picture.    Editing a very large picture will result in a small brush so
it  should  be  increased  using  the  size slider.  The pressure slider
indicates the speed at which point will be applied.  A higher value will
result  in  large amounts of point applied very quickly.  Smaller values
will  give  more  subtle  results.   The transparency slider is a global
setting  for  the  point  layer.  Altering the value of the transparency
will immediately update the paint layer.

Pick Colour
The  mouse pointer will change to a colour selector pointer allowing the
current  drawing  colour  to  be changed to the colour under the pointer
when the left button is clicked.


Alpha/Paint Layer Menu

Move Paint Layer to Alpha
The  opposite  of  Move  alpha to Paint layer.  The changes in the paint
layer  are  moved  into  a  new  image  that  is designated as the alpha
channel.

Invert Alpha
The  alpha  channel image is inverted - light areas become dark and dark
areas become light.

Move Alpha to Paint Layer
The  opposite of Move Point Layer to alpha.  The image designated as the
alpha  channel is moved into the paint layer applying the current colour
and effect.  Dark areas will be transparent, light areas will be opaque.

Invert Paint Layer
The  paint  layer  is  inverted  - opaque areas will become transparent,
transparent areas will become opaque.

Fix Paint Layer
Same  as  FIX  on  Toolbox.    The paint layer is FIXed to the image and
cleared.

Fix & Keep Paint Layer
The  paint  layer is FIXed to the image and kept.  Use this operation to
build up effects on selected areas of an image.

Clear Paint Layer
Same as clear icon on Toolbox.  The paint layer is cleared.


Windows Menu

Loaders
Opens the Loaders list.  Loaders are listed here to allow the generation
images  within  the program : Plasma, Streaks, Interference all generate
patterns  that  can  be  used  as  images  themselves or for interesting
alpha-channels  and  secondary  images  for  DisplaceMaps   for example.
Digitising  hardware  is  accessed  from  this  list  by clicking on the
appropriate loader.

Savers
Opens the Savers list.  Photogenics can save images in a wide variety of
different  formats  they  can  all be selected from this list.  Graphics
cards  are  supported in the form of Photogenics savers.  It is possible
to  utilise  a  supported display card by "saving" the image to the card
for viewing in full 24-bit.

Modes
Opens  the  Modes  window.  When painting, there are numerous modes that
can  be  used to affect the picture in different ways.  These range from
the  standard  colour  painting to making a picture brighter, darker, or
special effects such as negative and pixelise.

The  mode can also be changed from the Toolbox by clicking on Mode.  The
Modes  window  is  opened  allowing selected of a new effect.  The Modes
window  is  immediately  closed.   The Modes window will stay open until
closed with the close gadget, if opened from the menu option.

Please see reference section on Modes.

The  Images  window shows all current loaded images.  Images are show in
the  main area, alpha channel, or secondary buffer.  Images may be moved
into the alpha channel or secondary buffer by moving their icon into the
appropriate slot.  Only one image may bein each of the alpha channel and
secondary buffer.

Supported Hardware
The  programmers  have  tried  to  incorporate as much support for third
party hardware as is possible.  This list is constantly being updated so
if something is not already here then ring almathera and we will try our
best to help.  We would request hardware manufacturer to send us details
so that we may include their products in the support list.

The V Lab card is accessed from the Loaders list.

Supported File Formats

GIO  stands  for  Graphics  Input/Output.   A .GIO file contains code to
handle  loading  and  saving  images  from  Photogenics.    As these are
external  files  and  not part of the main program other programmers can
write  .GIO  files  for other formats that Photogenics does not directly
support.    Some  of  these  new .GIO files may become available through
Public  Domain  libraries  or  magazine  cover-disks,   others   will be
available  on  upgrades from almathera.  Simply copy new .GIO files into
your  Photogenics/data/GIO  directory and Photogenics will automatically
use them the next time it is run.

Some  GIOs  have  the  ability to autodetect a file.  When the 'Open...'
option  is  chosen from the Photogenics menu it will try and detect what
sort  of file it is loading.  Other GIOs do not support autodetect (some
files  are  impossible  to  identify  -  they  do  not  carry  a  unique
'signature' to determine them from other possible filetypes).  To lood a
file  which is in one of these formats you will need to select the 'Open
as/other...'  menu  option  and  select  the  file  type  from  the list
manually.

Other GIOs do not use files at all.  For example, the V-Lab GIO controls
the  V  Lab Video Digitizer to create new images, and the Opalvision GIO
'saves'  images by displaying them on the Opalvision graphics card (both
of  these  require  extra hardware).  For these autodetect is irrelevent
and they must always be called from the Loaders and Savers lists (opened
by 'Open as/other...' and 'Save as/other..')

The following GIO files are included as standard with Photogenics:

ACBM
Format: ACBM (Amiga Contiguous BitMap)
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Yes

The ACBM format is a very old Amiga graphics format, first used with the
Amiga  Graphicraft  paint  program  (published by Commodore).  It become
popular for use with Amiga Basic, which had routines to load ACBM format
files.

Save is not supported as IFF has totally replaced it for modern use.

AmigaScreen
Format: Grabs an Amiga screen display 
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Not a file

A  requester  opens  offering  you  the  choice  of Left Mouse button or
Joystick  Fire  button  to  activate.   If you use the left mouse button
option  click on the quickly and carefully otherwise it will immediately
grab the Photogenics screen!

Arrange your screens with the Amiga screen you want to grab at the front
and  top of your display (all other screens should be hidden behind it).
Then  press  the button (left mouse or joystick) that you selected.  The
screen  will  be  loaded  into Photogenics as a new buffer.  This can be
used  as  a  simple  way  of  transfering  images  from another graphics
program, for example Deluxe Paint IV (remembering to press F10 in Deluxe
Paint to hide the menus and toolbar)

Unlike  other  screengrabbers this should work fine with any screenmode,
including  third-party  display  cards (Picasso II, Retina, Rainbow III,
etc)


Ascii Art
Format: Ascii Text
Loads:       No
Saves:       Yes
Autodetect:  Does not load.

Saves  an  image  as  a picture made up of text characters (as if it had
been  'typed'  on  a  typewriter,  although almost totally useless, this
loader  is  quite fun and can be used to create interesting ASCII art to
use on BBS (Bulletin Board Systems) or in Desk-Top Publishing.


Backdrop
Format: Creates a new image
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Not a file

Backdrop  creates  gradiated backdrops that are suitable backgrounds for
composing images or text onto.

When  selected  the  requester  gives  you  two  choices - Horizontal or
Vertical.    With  a Horizontal gradient the colour changes from left to
right, with a vertical gradient the colour changes from top to bottom.

Once  you  have selected the type you must load in an IFF palette file. 
The  IFF  palette contains 256 colours which are spread over the picture
to  create  the  gradient.   You can create new palettes simply with the
Colours window (opened from the Palette requester) in Photogenics.


BMP
Format: Windows BMP (BitMaP)
Lood:       Yes (1,4,8 and 24 bit Windows BMP)
Save:       Yes (24 bit Windows BMP)
Autodetect: Yes

Windows  BMP  is  the native format of Microsoft Windows 3.  As it is an
uncompressed format BMP files can be quite large.


CDXL
Format: PAN format CDXL video stream
Load:       Yes (one frame at a time)
Save:       No
Autodetect: Yes

PAN  format  CDXL  is  the video format used by many CDTV and Amiga CD32
titles  to store animation sequences.  When loading a requester asks you
to select which frame of the animation you wish to load.


ColourNoise
Format: Create a new image
Load:       Yes
Save:       No
Autodetect: Not a file

This  creates  a new image of random pixels (you specify the size of the
image  you  want).  The resulting image can be used as the basis of many
textures and effects.


GIF
Format: Compuserve GIF87, GIF89a (Graphics Interchange Format)
Load:       Yes
Save:       No
Autodetect: Yes

The  GIF  format is popular on the PC and other computer systems.  It is
well  defined and well compressed, but it is limited to only 256 colours
so other formats (mainly JPEG) are now replacing it in common use.

HAM8
Format: Amiga IFF-ILBM HAM-8 files
Load:       No (but HAM-8 files are automatically loaded by the ILBM loader)
Save:       Yes
Autodetect: Does not load.

To  save  files  that  other Amiga paint programs can easily use, or for
fast  display  on  an  AGA  Amiga, the HAM8 saver is good.  It creates a
HAM-8  version  of the image (note that this results in a little loss of
quality  so  make  sure  you do not save over your 24 bit original files
with HAM 8), displays it if possible and saves it to disk.


IFFDeep
Format: IFF DEEP (uncompressed)
Load:       Yes
Save:       Yes
Autodetect: Yes

IFF  Deep was developed as a replacement for the Commodore IFF-24 format
(which  is  very  inefficient  and  slow).    Although it has not gained
massive  popularity it is a good format, and although it is uncompressed
(and  therefore  takes up lots of hard disk space) it is the fastest way
to work with 24-bit files in Photogenics.


ILBM
Format: IFF ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap)
Load:       Yes (2-256 colour, Extra-Halfbrite, HAM, HAM8 & IFF-24)
Save:       Yes (IFF-24 compressed and uncompressed)
Autodetect: Yes
 
IFF-ILBM is the standard graphics file format of the Amiga.  While it is
not  ideally  suited for 24-bit graphics it is supported by almost every
Amiga  application that can create or use graphics.  If you want to load
in a graphics file created by another Amiga program, chances are it will
be an IFF-ILBM file of some sort.

Only  24-bit  IFFs are saved by this loader.  There is also a HAM8 saver
that will create and save HAM-8 pictures.

IMG
Format: Gem IMG (Image)
Load:       Yes (only tested with monochrome colour images)
Save:       No
Autodetect: No

Gem IMG is the standard clip-art format for the Atari ST computer


JPEG
Format: JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) JFIF
Load:       Yes
Save:       Yes
Autodetect: Yes

JPEG  is  the  most  popular  format  currently for 24-bit graphics.  It
compresses  images  by applying 'lossy' compression (it cuts down detail
in  the  image).   Because of this you will not get an exact copy of the
image  you created, but it will be very close and only a fraction of the
size it would be when saved with IFF Deep, for example.

When  saving  an  image  you  are asked for a Quality level.  At 100 the
image is stored as well as JPEG can, at lower rates it tries to compress
the image down more, so the quality of your saved image is lower.

Always  save images at 100% quality if you intend to continue working on
them (or use a non-lossy saver like IFF Deep).


OPALVISION
Format: Display image on Opalvision 
Loads:      No 
Saves:      Yes (requires OpalVision card)
Autodetect: Not a file.

This  saver  will display the currently selected image as a 24-bit image
on an OpalVision card, if fitted.


PBM
Format: PBM (Portable BitMap)/PGM (Portable Grey Map)/PPM (Portable Pixel Map)
Loads:      Yes (1-bit PBM/8-bit PGM/24-bit PPM), Binary formats only
Saves:      Yes (24-bit PPM binary format)
Autodetect: Yes

The  PBM/PGM/PPM  formats  were  defined  for the PBM image manipulation
utilities  (PBMPlus,  NetPBM) available for many computer systems.  Many
programs exist that create images in the PBM formats.


Picasso II
Format: Display image on Picasso II
Loads:      No
Saves:      Yes (requires Picasso II card)
Autodetect: Not a file.

This  saver  will display the currently selected image as a 24 bit image
on a Picasso II card, if fitted.


PLASMA
Format: Create a new image
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Not a file.

This creates a 24 bit 'plasma' pattern.


QRT 
Format: QRT (Quick Ray Trace)
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      Yes
Autodetect: No

This  loads and saves files used by the QRT raytracing and other similar
packages.


QUADANIM
Format: .Qa Quadanim
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Yes

This  loads  a single 80x64 frame from a Video Creator Quad Anim.  Video
Creator is a CD32 title developed by Almathera that allows you to create
your own music videos.


RAW
Format: Raw 24 bit image data
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      Yes
Autodetect: No

This  loads and saves raw 24-bit image data.  It can be used to transfer
data across to other computer platforms that do not understand the other
file formats.

You have an option of adding a 'pad-byte' to the file.  This is an extra
zero byte that some systems will require.


RGB8
Format: Impulse RGB8
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Yes

This is a format used by TurboSilver and Imagine raytracers


RGBN
Format: Impulse RGBN
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Yes

This is another format used by TurboSilver and Imagine raytracers


RIPPLES
Format: Creates a new image
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Not a file

Ripples  creates  a  new image of concentric circles (ripples).  You can
specify  the  size  of  the  final  image  and  the centre point for the
circles.    The  files  created  are  ideal for use with the DisplaceMap
operator (see tutorial)


SCULPT
Format:Raw R,G,B files
Loads:      No
Saves:      Yes
Autodetect: Does not load

The  'sculpt'  format  (originally  used  by the Sculpt 3d/4d raytracer)
saves  data as 3 seperate R G and B planes of raw data.  This format can
be very useful for transfering raw data to other systems.


SHOWHAM8
Format: Display a HAM-8 image
Loads:      No
Saves:      Yes
Autodetect: Does not load

If  you  have  the  AGA chipset fitted to your machine, you can use this
saver  to display the current image on a HAM8 screen at full size.  This
is  useful  if you are editing a large image in a small window.  You can
scroll around large images using the mouse.


STREAKS
Format: Create a new image
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Not a file

Streaks  generotes  a  new  image  of  a  given size containing a random
streaked and textured background.


TEXT
Format: Create a new image from given text
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Not a file

After  selecting  a  font  from  the  standard system font requester and
entering  some  text,  a  new  buffer  is  created with your chosen text
rendered  in  the  selected   font.      This   supports standard fonts,
compugraphic fonts and colour fonts.

For  overlaying  text  over pictures load text into a new buffer and use
the  Compose  function  (with  brightness key enabled).  This works best
with  anti  aliased colourfonts (see examples on disk 3), or if the text
is slightly blurred before composing.

Over  200  good quality anti-aliased colourfonts are available on CD-ROM
from  almathera  (on the Amiga Desktop Video CD-ROM) which are ideal for
use with Photogenics.


V-Lab
Format: Digitise image from VLab card.
Loads:      Yes
Saves:      No
Autodetect: Not a file

Grab  a  frame  from  the Macrosystems VLab digitiser card.  Options are
selectable for the image resolution and which VLab input to use.


WhiteNoise
Format: Create a new image
Load:       Yes
Save:       No
Autodetect: Not a file

This  creates a new image of random grey pixels (you specify the size of
the  image  you  want).  The resulting image can be used as the basis of
many textures and effects.

Brushes

Photogenics  comes  with  a variety of realistic brush types.  Different
brushes allow you to choose how your chosen colour and effect is applied
to  the  image.   Airbrush gives a smooth flow of paint with soft edges,
others give different textures to your painting like a chalk pastel. 

Airbrush
The  Airbrush  is selected by default when you start Photogenics, and is
usually  the  best brush to use for image processing.  By default, it is
set  up to provide a fast flow of paint, which is no good when trying to
do  smooth shading.  The example picture shows the different effects you
can easily acheive by changing the brush settings.  The left image shows
the  default  settings.    You  will  find that going over what you have
already  done  will  quickly cover what was underneath.  On the right is
the kind of shading you can do with the pressure set low (about 5 - 15%)
and the size around 50.  Note that the faster your computer is, then the
better you can paint with the larger brush sizes.

Pencil
Pencil  is  one  of most realistic of the artists tools in Photogenics. 
Altering  its  pressure  can  give  a good deal of control over what you
draw.   For instance, if you were drawing a picture you might do a rough
outline  with  the  pressure  set  to  20% and the size set to 1 or 2 To
subtly  shade  in  a picture, you should set the size to 3 or 4, and the
pressure  to  3-5  %  .  However, if you want to do something like cross
hatching, then reduce the size to 1 or 2 and the pressure to 1 - 15%.

From  left  to  right, the example picture show what you can do with the
pressure  set to 4%, and the size set to from 1 to 8.  Note that like in
real  life,  pencils  work  best  on white background, although there is
nothing to stop you experimenting with other colours.

Chalk Pastel
Chalk  Pastel  is  best for shading in quite large areas, and works best
with  a  large  brush  size  and  a  pressure of about 20%.  The example
picture  illustrates  chalk  pastel with a pressure of 20% and a size of
20,  30,  and  40.  Chalk pastels are usually used with black paper, but
also  work well with other colours.  This brush is very good at blending
colours  together,  as  the  colour  builds up gradually as you move the
mouse,  (unlike  the  airbrush  which  builds up colour as you press the
mouse button)

WaterColour
WaterColour,  like  the  real  thing  builds up colour so that it doesnt
quite  obscure  what  you  are  drawing  over.   For best results, start
shading  with  lighter  colours  and  gradually  build  up the amount of
colour.    Also, with large brush sizes move the mouse slowly, at around
the  same speed you would use a normal paint brush.  The example picture
shows  what you can acheive with pressure at 2%, and size set to 10, 20,
30 and 40.

Note that this works best on a very fast machine, due to the large brush
size  needed.   Also note that this brush subdues whatever paint mode is
in  operation,  as if you had set the Transparency to 50%, so some image
processing modes may not work as they would do with other brushes.
 
Felt Tip
Felt  tip may not be the most used artistic medium, but Photogenics will
do  a good rendition of one anyway.  Like the real thing, if you go over
a  dark  colour  with a lighter colour, nothing will happen.  This means
that  it will only work on a light coloured background.  Also, if you go
over one colour with another colour, the colours will mix like real ink.
For  example if you go over orange with magenta you will get red, and if
you go over yellow with cyan then you will get green.  If however you go
over  a  colour  with  one that doesn't mix, then you will get black, ie
going over red with blue.

The  example  show  what affect the pressure has on the brush, here at a
size  of  6.  From left to right the pressures are 2%, 6%, 10%, 15%, 30%
and  finally  100%.    Note that this brush will not work well with some
image processing modes.

Crayon
The  example  picture  illustrates  the kind of effect that using crayon
gives.  Changing the pressure or size loses the impact of the crayon.

Sponge
Sponge  is  a useful medium for covering large areas with an interesting
texture.   You can create nice clouds and landscapes using it.  It works
just as well when used on a dark background.

The  example shown shows sponge with the size set to 30, and pressure at
10%, then size kept the same but pressure set to 4%.  Below it shows the
size set to 50 with pressure at 4%, and next to it the size was kept the
same but pressure increased to 10%.

Cloth
Cloth  is  a  nice  media for covering large areas.  Cloth is unusual in
that its results can be changed drastically depending on whether you are
in  the dotted line mode or in continuous line mode.  In dotted mode you
get the effect of dabbing a cloth over you image, and in continuous mode
it  has the effect of wiping a damp cloth with a little paint on it over
the  image.    Unfortunately  cloth  in  continuous mode requires a very
powerful  machine  such as an Amiga 4000/040, so by default it is set to
dotted mode.

The  first  picture  illustrates cloth in dotted line mode.  Top left is
with  a  size  of  30  and  pressure at 20%, then size kept the same but
pressure reduced to 6%.  Below it shows the size set to 100 and pressure
to 6%, and then finally size set to 50 and pressure at 8%.

The  second example picture shows cloth in continuous line mode.  On the
left it has a size of 40, and a pressure of 3%, and below it with a size
of  25  and  a  pressure  of 3%.  The effect on the left was achieved by
going  over  an  area  several  times  but with the strokes in different
directions.

Neon
This  brush produces glowing strokes of light.  It is most used for text
or decoration, and works best with contrasting colours such as yellow on
black or blue on white.  Note that if you increase the size then you may
wish  to  alter the pressure to keep the glow effect.  The straight line
draw mode works particularly well with neon.


Paint Modes

Definitions

Secondary
Whether the effect requires a picture in the secondary buffer

Uses Colour
Whether the effect uses the currently selected colour

Options
Variable parameters that can be changed with the Mode Option button (not
all modes have options that can be changed)

Remember
All  these  modes  can  be  painted on with any brush type with variable
transparency.

AddDust
Secondary:   No
Uses Colour: No
Options:     Dust Amount (Percentage)
Description: Adds a layer of dust to the image, by randomly altering the
brightness of each pixel.
             

AddNoise
Secondary:   No
Uses Colour: No
Options:     Noise Amount (Percentage)
Description:  Add  multicolour  noise.    Adds  'noise'  to an image (to
simulate bad TV reception or a grainy image).  100% is full noise, which
is  identical  to  creating  a new buffer with the 'ColourNoise' loader.
Nice  'stone' effects can be created by using AddNoise followed by Blur.


AlterHue
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: Yes
Options:     None
Description:  Change  hue  to  current  colour.  A powerful type of Tint
operation  that changes the hue (or colour) of an image without changing
the  brightness or saturation (so coloured pixels change but grey pixels
remain grey).  Compare with Tint.


Antique
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Tints a picture with a sepia tint to simulate an old faded
photograph.  Best used in combination with AddDust, AddNoise and Blur.


Balance
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     -256 to 256 for Red, Green and Blue channels.
Description:  Allows  individual adjustment of the brightness of each of
the  three colour components - Red, Green and Blue to adjust the tone of
an image to correct it or to add a new colour scheme.


Blur
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Blurs  an image by averaging the values of each pixel with
its  surrounding  pixels.    More  subtle  than  HeavyBlur  and good for
smoothing a harsh-edged picture without losing too much detail.


Brightness
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Brightness level -256 to 256
Description: Affects the brightness of the selected area.  Option values
above  zero  will  brighten  an  image, values below zero will darken an
image.


Cloner
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Line to select offset.
Description: Cloner is one of the most useful features of Photogenics. 
Selecting  the  cloner allows you to duplicate features from one part of
an  image to another.  Use this to copy a feature (a cloud, tree, house,
person)  seamlessly  to  another  part  of  the  picture,  or  clone the
background to remove features from photographs.

 
Contrast 
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Contrast level -256 to 256
Description:  Adjust the contrast level of the image in a similar way to
the  contrast  settings  on a televison or monitor.  -256 is no contrast
(image goes completely grey) and +256 is full contrast.


Deinterlace
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Odd field/Even field
Description:  This  effect is designed to help clean up interlaced video
frame  grabs  from  devices like the V-Lab Video Digitizer, but can also
work  with  other  images (such as high resolution pictures intended for
display on interlaced computer screens).

Interlaced  frames may appear to "jitter".  Deinterlace will remove this
error.    This option controls whether the 'odd' or 'even' field will be
kept  in  the  area (each video frame contains two fields, odd and even.
It  is  differences  between  these  fields  that cause the flicker with
interlaced pictures)


DisplaceMap
Secondary:   Yes
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Displace  pixel according to intensity of the pixel in the
secondary picture.  This can distort pixels in a variety of unusual ways
to create waves, ripples, squashed, stretched and other images.  This is
a  very  powerful  feature,  see the tutorial on how to create a rippled
picture with DisplaceMap.


Emboss
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Colour/Greyscale
Description:  Embosses  an  image  by  creating  a  grey  image with the
appearance  of  the  image  pressed into it.  Normally this can maintain
some  of  the  original  colour  of the image, but it can be switched to
greyscale (which looks better in some cases).


False Colour
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Load an IFF Palette file
Description:  Every  pixel  is  converted  to  one of 256 colours in the
palette  you  select  from  disk.    Dark  colours  are  chosen from the
beginning of the list, light colours from the end.  This provides a huge
variety  of  ways  to  remap pictures to different colour schemes.  Many
example palettes are provided.


FlipX
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Flips  the  selected area around the vertical axis running
down the centre of the image.


FlipY
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Flips the selected area around the horizontal axis running
across the centre of the image.


GradientTint
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: Yes
Options:     Position (Percent), Smoothness (Percent)
Description:  Simulates  the  two-tone  filters produced for photography
that are coloured on one half of the filter and clear on the other half.
These  are often used to give skies deep colours (simulating a sunset or
making  a  light  sky  a  deep  blue)  without  tinting  the rest of the
landscape.  This paint mode is very powerful as you can specify both the
position of the half-way mark (the boundary between the coloured portion
and  the  clear  portion) and the smoothness of the join - at 0% it is a
sharp  transition  between coloured and clear, at 100% the transition is
totally smooth.


GreyScale 
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Video Levels/Simple Average
Description:  Convert  to greyscale.  There are two different algorithms
used  to  create  Greyscale.    The  default  is  based on the different
brightness of the Red, Green ond Blue components of light to give a more
accurate  conversion,  there  is  also  a  simple  average   [(R+G+B)/3]
algorithm which can sometimes give better results.


HeavyBlur
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Apply  a heavy blur to the picture.  This uses a different
blur  matrix  to  provide  a  heavier blur to the image than with normal
Blur.   Use this in certain cases when Blur is not enough.  If HeavyBlur
is  not  enough to smooth out your image then either use several 'coats'
(by Fixing and reapplying blur) or use the Gaussion Blur option from the
menu (which is a lot slower but very powerful).


Highlights
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Any  pixel  darker  than  mid-grey is set to black.  Other
pixels are mapped to different greyscales depending on their brightness.
This, with Lowlights, is very useful for creating Alpha Channels.


HueMap
Secondary:   Yes
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Change  colour  according to intensity of the pixel in the
secondary  picture.  Can create unusual 'rainbow' patterns on an image. 
With no secondary selected the current image will be used as a HueMap on
itself,  which can sometimes give very interesting false colour effects.


LimitMax
Secondary:   No 
Uses colour: Yes
Options:     None
Description:  Limits  the  maximum  colour  range  in the picture to the
colour  you  have  selected.  If a colour is brighter in either the Red,
Green  or  Blue  levels  to your selected colour then the components are
rounded  off  to the level of the colour selected (so if medium grey was
selected, no pixel brighter than medium grey would remain).


LimitMin
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: Yes
Options:     None
Description:  Limits  the  minimum  colour  range  in the picture to the
colour  you  have  selected.    If a colour is darker in either the Red,
Green  or  Blue  levels  to your selected colour then the components are
raised  to  the  level  of  the colour selected (so if a medium grey was
selected, no pixel darker than medium grey would remain).


LineArt
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Colour/Greyscale
Description:  Simulates a line-art drawing of the image by detecting the
borders  of an image.  Very effective with photographs.  You may want to
change the contrast levels of a picture before or after using LineArt to
enhance  the  effect.    You  can  limit  lineart to using greyscales by
selecting greyscale in the mode options.


Lowlights
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Any  pixel  lighter  than mid-grey is set to black.  Other
pixels are mapped to different greyscales depending on their darkness.


Masking Paint
Secondary:   No
Uses Colour: Yes
Options:     None 
Description: This paintmode is a very simple paint with 20% transparency
to  show the original picture underneath.  It is not meant to be used as
a  paint  mode  in  its  own right, but it is very useful for accurately
selecting areas to then process with a different paintmode.


Matrix
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Create matrix (9 input boxes), Load and Save Matrix.
Description:  Matrices are very powerful image manipulation tools.  They
work  by combining the pixel with the value of its neighbours in various
ways.    You  can load in a variety of pre-defined matrices and save out
new ones from the mode options.


Maximum
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  Sets  the current pixel to the value of the brightest Red,
Green  and  Blue  values  from  the  surrounding 8 pixels.  Makes bright
objects 'expand' into darker areas.


Minimum
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description:  The  reverse  of Maximum.  Dark areas expand into brighter
areas.


Mix
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: Yes
Options:     Add, Sub, Or, Xor, Diff,
Description:  Mixes  the  pixel  colour with the selected colour using a
variety of different logical operations:

ADD:   The colour is added to the pixel.
SUB:   The colour is subtracted from the pixel.
AND:   The colour is logical ANDed with the pixel.
OR:    The colour is logical ORed with the pixel.
XOR:   The colour is logical XORed with the pixel.
DIFF.  The pixel is set to the difference between the new colour and the
       current pixel colour.


Monochrome
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: Yes
Options:     None
Description:  Convert to a purely black and white (2 colour) image.  All
pixels  darker  than  the  selected colour are turned black, others turn
white.   This works best if the selected colour is Mid Grey, but you can
change  the  colour  and  Use  to find the best value.  This can produce
excellent  Alpha Channels (remember to Blur the image after fixing it!).


MotionBlur
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Length (2 to 50) and Angle (degrees)
Description:  This  powerful  (and slow on high lengths) effect blurs an
image  as  if  it  is  a  photograph  of the object moving in the chosen
direction.  It is useful for giving an object in an image the impression
of movement.


Negative
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     None
Description: Inverts the selected pixels.  The following table will help
you understand what the inverse of colours will be:

Red     goes to Cyan
Yellow  goes to Blue
Green   goes to Magenta
Cyan    goes to Red
Blue    goes to Yellow
Magenta goes to Green
Black   goes to White
White   goes to Black.


NegBright
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No 
Options:     None
Description:  Inverts  brightness  but leaves the colour of an image the
same,  so  red  pixels  stay  red, but dark red pixels turn to light red
pixels  and  vice  versa,  black turns white and white turns black.  Can
produce  quite  unusual  ghostly  images  when applied to photographs of
people.


Paint
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: Yes
Options:     None
Description:  Simple  paint.  The current selected area is replaced with
the selected colour, EXCEPT that certain brushes can work in a different
way.    Some  paint  tools  (Marker  pen,  for  example)  mix paint in a
different  way,  so  when  a  light colour goes over a darker colour the
darker colour shows through.


Pixelise
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Width ond height of pixeIs
Description: Converts the selected area to a 'blocky' image, this effect
is often used to hide the identity of people on TV police programmes.


Posterise
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Colour levels
Description  :  Creates  a  version of the image using only a few shades
(based  on  the  colour  levels  setting).   This produces an effect not
dissimilar to the images from 1960s 'pop art' posters.


Randomise
Secondary:   No
Uses colour: No
Options:     Maximum displacement
Description:  Randomly  shifts  the  pixels  in  an image up to a chosen
distance  from their current location.  This can make pictures 'explode'
into  a  cloud  of  pixels  (at a high setting), or merely give images a
fuzzy, grainy look (at a low setting, best Blurred afterwards).


Roll
Secondary:   No
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     X and Y offset
Description:  Rolls  the  picture (or selected area) through a set pixel
offset.  The picture wraps round at the edges.
 

RubThru
Secondary:   Yes
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     None
Description:  Rub  through  to the secondary image.  Pixels are replaced
with the equivalant pixel on the secondary image.


RubMix
Secondary:   Yes
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     Mode- Thru, add, Sub, Or, Xor, Diff
Description:  Mixes  the pixel colour with the equivalant pixel from the
secondary image using a variety of different logical operations.

ADD:    The secondary pixel is added to the pixel.
SUB:    The secondary pixel is subtracted from the pixel.
AND:    The secondary pixel is logical ANDed with the pixel.
OR:     The secondary pixel is logical ORed with the pixel.
XOR:    The secondary pixel is logical XORed with the pixel.
DIFF.   The pixel is set to the difference between the secondary and 
        primary pixel colours.


RubTint
Secondary:   Yes
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     None
Description: Tints the current picture using the colour of the secondary
picture behind, leaving the texture of the original picture.


Rub Texture
Secondary:   Yes
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     None
Description:  This  is  the  opposite  of  RubTint,  the colour from the
current picture is kept and only the texture is rubbed through.


Saturation
Secondary:   No
UsesPoint:   No
Options:     -256 to 256
Description:  Raise  or  lower  the saturation of a selected part of the
image.    Colours  get  stronger  with  higher  saturation (at very high
saturation colours turn white) and weaker with low saturation.


Sharpen
Secondary:   No
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     None
Description:  Edges in the current picture are detected and sharpened to
enhance  the  image.  This is quite powerful, so you may need to turn up
the transparency to get the desired level of change.
 

ShiftHue
Secondary:   No
UsesPoint:   No
Options:     Shift amount (degrees)
Description:  Any  colour  can  be  described  as a combination of three
components - Hue, Saturation and Value.  Shifting the hue can be used to
alter the colour component only.


ShiftRGB
Secondary:   No
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     Backwards Yes/No
Description:  Photogenics  images  are  stored as RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
data.  By swapping the R, G and B values different false- colour effects
can  be produced.  Default is R goes to G, G goes to B and B goes to R. 
This direction can be reversed with the Backwards option.


Solarize
Secondary:   No
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     None
Description: This simulates a classical photographic trick, deliberately
exposing  a  negative before developing to produce unusual colouring and
shading.    This will enhance the darker colours but invert the brighter
colours.


Tile
Secondary:   No
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     Width and height of tiIe
Description:  This fills the selected area with tiles, each tile being a
miniature  copy of the full screen.  You can select the width and height
of the tiles.


TileBrick
Secondary:   No
UsesPaint:   No
Options:     Width ond height of tile
Description:  This  works  like Tile, except the tiles are arranged in a
brickwork  pattern  with every other row of tiles offset horizontally by
half a tile.


Tint
Secondary:   No
UsesPaint:   Yes
Options:     None
Description:  This  replaces  the  colour  of the selected area with the
chosen  colour  while retaining the brightness of the original pixels so
the  detail  (features  in the original picture) remain, but tinted to a
new colour.


Tutorials
---------

These  tutorials  have  been written to explain some of the more complex
features  of Photogenics.  Some are here to give you ideas for using the
package more creatively. 

Tutorial: First steps.

This  tutorial  will  give  you  a  few ideas for making interesting and
colourful  backgrounds.    The  easiest  way  to  create  a nice looking
background is to use the plasma loader.

Firstly,  you must open the loaders window by selecting Loaders from the
Windows  pull  down  menu.   Select the plasma loader by clicking on the
word  Plasma.  You will then be presented with a screen size requester. 
Select  a screen size of 320 x 256 by clicking on the appropriate box or
by  using  the  sliders.  The plasma will take a little time to generate
and  once  it  has  finished you will be presented with an image full of
nicely blended colours.

An  effect  that  works well with plasma images is Sharpen.  To add this
effect  open  the  Modes  window by selecting Mode from the Windows pull
down  menu.    Now  select  Sharpen by clicking on the word Sharpen Once
Sharpen  is  highlighted click on the Fill Screen button in the tool box
(located  in  the  left  column  above the Fix button).  The Fill Screen
button will fill the screen with the selected mode, in this case it will
Sharpen the whole image.  Once the image has been sharpened fix it using
the Fix button in the tool box.

The  plasma  will now have much greater definition.  From this image you
can  create  a  stoney looking texture by using the Emboss mode.  Select
Emboss  from the modes window and turn the greyscale option on.  You can
do  this  by clicking on the Mode Options button located to the right of
the  Mode  button  in  the  tool box.  A box will now open with the word
greyscale  in it, click on the button and then click OK.  Now Emboss the
whole  screen  by  clicking  on  the fill screen button and then fix the
image.

You  will  now have Grey stony texture.  If you wish to make the texture
stand  out,  then  you  can sharpen it in the same way you sharpened the
original plasma image.  You can also change the colour of the texture to
any colour of your choice.

To  do  this  select the Tint mode from the Modes window.  Next you must
open  the  palette  window by clicking on the colour block at the top of
the  Toolbox.    By clicking anywhere on the colour wheel you can select
your  desired  colour,  or you could select one of the preset colours in
the  list  on  the right of the palette window.  The colour block in the
palette  window  shows  your  currently  selected colour.  Once you have
found  the  colour that you want to use click on the "Use" button in the
palette  window.   Don't forget to FIX after the desired effect has been
achieved.

Plasma  Text: This effect uses the RubThru mode to fill text with plasma
colours.

Select Text from the loaders window and you will the be presented with a
font  requester.  Click on the Diamond font in the fonts list and select
a font size of sixty by clicking on box at the bottom of the sizes list,
typing the number 60 and pressing return.  Now click on the OK button.

A  box will appear with the word Text in it.  Click on the word text and
delete  it,  type  in  your  own text and press return.  Click on the OK
button  and  after a few seconds the text you typed will appear.  Select
Blur  mode  and  use it to fill the whole screen and then fix the image.
Using  the  Clone  option from the Project pull down menu make a copy of
your  text  image.   Put the copy of the image into the alpha channel by
selecting  the  'Use as Alpha Channel' option from the options menu when
the  copy is selected.  Now select the plasma loader and choose the same
height and width as your text image.  Once the plasma has been generated
make  it  the  secondary  imoge by selecting 'Use as secondary' from the
options menu.

Select  your  original  text image and change the mode to RubThru.  Fill
the  screen.    Finally fix the image and you will see that the text has
changed from white to plasma.

Blue  Sky:  A  quick  way to create a sky like background is to create a
plasma  then  select the antique mode and fill the screen.  After fixing
the  image  select  the  negative  mode and fill the screen again.  This
should leave you with a nice pastel blue and white image.

Ripple: Nice backgrounds can also be created by using the ripple loader.
These  look  especsially  good when used with the displace map mode.  To
create  this  effect select Ripples from the loaders window and select a
screen size.  Select Use As Secondary from the Options menu.

Load  an  image, and select DisplaceMap from the modes window.  Fill the
image.    The ripples will displace the new image giving a very pleasant
effect.

Tutorial - Compose:

This  tutorial  will show you some of the power of the Compose function,
which allows you to easily combine any images inside Photogenics.

First  load  a  background  image.  We will be using SeaSky.jpg from the
tutorial directory on disk 2.

Now,  choose  an image for the foreground.  We will use the portrait.jpg
file.    Load  this with the 'Open as/secondary..." menu option, it will
load  straight into the secondary buffer and will not open a window (you
will  see a new picture icon in the secondary box in the images window).

Select  the  seasky image again by clicking on its window titlebar Go to
the image menu and select 'Compose...'

The  second  image (the portrait) will now appear in a box on top of the
first  image.  With compose you can size this box and position the image
whereever you want.

Hold  down  the  left mouse button with the pointer over the positioning
box  (the  small box in the center of the new image).  While keeping the
left mouse button held down move the mouse.  When you are happy with the
new position let go.

The  boxes at each corner of the image are for stretching the image.  Do
the  same  procedure as you did for moving the image, except now it will
resize the image instead of moving it.

Move  and  resize  the  image until you are happy with the position, and
then  go  back to the compose window (you may have to click on the depth
gadget  in  the top right hand corner of the compose window to bring the
compose  window  into  view)  Note  that  the boxes at the bottom of the
compose  window  allow  you to enter co-ordinates manually for the image
width and height.

Click on the little button marked 'Blend In/Out'.  This will enter blend
mode.    In  blend  mode  you  can  blend  the  image  smoothly into the
background.    Simply  use the right mouse button to paint-out the image
and  the  left mouse button to reapply it in exactly the same way as you
normally  paint.   You can even use different brushes to apply a rougher
texture to the blends.

For  now  keep  the  standard Airbrush and use the right mouse button to
erase the background of the portrait.  If you accidentally erase some of
the face then simply use the left mouse button to reapply the image.

Once  you are happy with your composition, click on the OK gadget in the
Compose window and it's finished!


Tutuorial - Rippling an Image.

One  of  the  most  powerful  features of Photogenics is the DisplaceMap
paintmode.    With  this  you  can  distort  one  picture, using another
picture,  selected as the secondary buffer, as a 'map'.  You can use any
picture  as a displacement map, but it works best with pictures that are
primarily  greys, and it is best if the background is set to a mid grey.
Pictures created with the Emboss paintmode can work particularly well.

Here are a few tricks you can do with DisplaceMap...

Step 1.
Open an example picture, we will use "tutorials/Girl.jpg" for this one.

Step 2.
Create a displacement map: Do 'open as/other.' ond select "Ripples" from
the  list.    Change  the width and height in the requester to match the
width  and  height  of the picture you loaded (200 wide and 256 high for
the  girl.jpg  example)  and  select OK.  For the next requester (centre
co-ordinates) just press OK.

Step 3.
The  concentric  circles  image  you  have just created will be an ideal
Displace  Map.    Select  the image (by clicking on the title bar of the
image)  and  select 'Options/Use as Secondary' from the menu (or drag it
into the S box on the Images window.  It should now disappear.

Step 4.
Select  the  main  image again.  Click on the MODE button in the toolbar
and select "DisplaceMap" from the list.

Step 5.
Fill  the  screen  (with  the white button above FIX in the toolbar) for
instant  ripples!   You can mess around with the strength of the ripples
by changing the mode options for DisplaceMap (the button to the right of
the  MODE  button  in the toolbar).  Try different combinations of large
and small values for X and Y for different effects.


Tutorial - Creating special text effects - using Alpha Channels

This  tutorial  requires  the  special anti-aliased fonts from disk 3 of
Photogenics.  To use these fonts Photogenics must be installed on a Hard
drive.

Alpha  channels  allow  very powerful image manipulations.  Here we will
show you how to create some different fancy text effects starting from a
simple plain font (or for better results an anti-aliased colourfont)

The  first  step  is to enter some text.  Select "Open as/Other..." from
the  menu and click on the TEXT loader.  Select a font.  You can use any
font for this, but the larger the font the better the results will look.
Choose  the Bodocious font (if you have installed it to your hard drive)
and select the size 85 from the right hand column.  Then click on the OK
button.

Enter some text now, we will type "Amiga" into the Gadget.

A  new buffer is created, called Unnamed, with the Amiga text in a plain
white  font on a black background.  If you zoom in with the magnify tool
you  can  see  that  the  edges of the letters are not sharp they have a
blurred  outline  (called  anti-aliasing).    This  makes  the font look
smoother  than  other standard fonts.  Zoom out again by clicking on the
button to the right of the magnify button.

If  you  are  using  a standard font (not a colourfont) you can blur the
edges and smooth it out by using the Blur or Heavy Blur paint modes.

The  next step is to clone the buffer.  Select the Clone option from the
Project  menu.    You  will  now  have two identical pictures.  Move the
window for the new image to the bottom of the screen so you can see both
buffers  (they  may  be  overlapped  slightly  on  some systems - do not
worry!)

Select  the  second  buffer  (marked Copy of unnamed) by clicking in the
window  titlebar  (the  window  border will turn blue).  Go to the image
menu and choose Gaussian Blur Select a Blur radius of 4 and click on OK.
Warning!    This  may  take a long time to complete.  Gaussian Blur is a
very powerful and complex operator.

We  are  making  a  heavily  blurred  version  of the text to use as the
starting point for our text effects.

Once  it  has finished, select the original text (the buffer you did not
blur)  and  press  key  '3'  to  use it as an alpha-channel.  Select the
blurred  buffer  again, chose 'Emboss' from the paintmode list (the MODE
button  on  the toolbar), and click on the Fill Screen gadget (the white
square above the FIX gadget).

Now  we  have  some text that appears to be a raised, embossed text.  It
looks quite nice as it is, but we can play around some more and try some
different tricks...

First  click  on  the FIX gadget to make this change permanent.  Now try
some  different  paintmodes.    Fill the screen again and open the Modes
window  from  the  Windows  menu  (or press Amiga-M) so the window stays
open.    Click  on  different  modes  to  experiment  -  you can see how
different modes provide different effects.

AddDust  and  AddNoise  turn the boring grey text into a more stone like
grainy texture.

Monochrome  (assuming  you haven't changed the current colour) turns the
inside  of  the  text dark leaving the outer glow of the letters.  Point
leaves  the  glow  but fills the inside of the letters with the selected
colour.    Tint  changes the colour inside, but leaves the nice embossed
texture.

We  will  do  a  combination of different effects.  First we will select
AddDust and click on Fix.

Now  select  GradientTint  from the modes list, click on the Fill Screen
button and fix again.

Now  we want to change the outer glow to a different colour.  To do this
we  have to invert the Alpha Channel (the alpha channel determines which
bits  of the picture are altered.  So far we have only been altering the
inside  of  the letters, now we only want to alter the outside).  Select
Invert Alpha from the Alpha/Paint Layer menu.

Now  fill  the  screen  again and set the paint mode to tint.  The outer
glow  changes  colour  to yellow, which was the colour we had previously
set.  Open the palette requester (click on the Yellow box in the toolbar
or  press  the 'p' key).  Select a new colour, try Blue from the list on
the  right.   Then click on the 'Use' button.  It's too dork.  So we can
change  it  with the sliders.  Change the hue slider (H) by moving it to
the  left  until  you  get  a value of around 138.  You should now see a
brighter, more cyan, shade of blue.  Click on Use again.

Close the palette requester and click on FIX to apply this change.  Now,
the  outer  glow  isn't  big  enough.    Simple.    Choose the 'Maximum'
paintmode  and fill the screen again.  Now the glow will expand into the
dark background.  Fix it and fill and fix again.

And  that's  it.    A nice colourful logo created in a few minutes.  And
it's  so  easy  to  change this procedure, apply a few Negatives, blurs,
different tints or filters to create totally different effects.


Artists Tutorial
----------------

This  tutorial will teach you how to use the Airbrush more artistically.
You  will  be  drawing  a  nice  and  shiny  red  ball,  complete with a
convincing shadow.

Starting  from  scratch,  create a new, white 320 by 256 buffer (you can
create new buffers by selecting from the Project Menu/New).

Open  up  the  brush  setting  window  by  clicking  on  its icon on the
Tool-Box.    Set  the brush size to around 25, and the pressure to about
20%.  Open the Palette by clicking on the coloured box at the top of the
Toolbox.    Change the colour to black by finding the Black entry in the
Presets list on the right of the Palette.

You  will  now create a mask (another term for Alpha Channel) for you to
draw  through.  Draw an unfilled circle in the middle of your buffer, so
that  it  is about a third of the heiqht of the buffer.  Fill the inside
of  this  circle  by  using  the filled circle tool.  This gives a solid
circle with very smooth edges.

Now  select the menu Alpha/Paint Layer/Move Paint Layer to Alpha.  After
a short delay, your mask will have been moved to the Alpha Channel.

You will find that you picture will be cleared, but dont be alarmed.  If
you  now  try  and  draw on your buffer, you will find that you can only
draw in the parts of the picture that you originally drew the circle in.

To  get a better idea of the area you can draw on, clear the buffer, set
the  colour  to  red  and  fill  the screen.  To create a guide, set the
transparency to around 90%, and fix the picture.  Reset the transparency
to 0% before you proceed.

Set  your  brush  size  to  around  50,  and  the  pressure to about 10%
(Remember, the lower the pressure, the greater the control you have)

Starting  from  the bottom left edge of the circle, gently draw with the
mouse around the outline of the circle, decreasing the amount you rub as
you  get near the highlights.  Remember, if you go wrong, you can always
rub mistakes out with the right mouse button.

FIX  to  store  your  changes.    Now  darken  the  red using moving the
brightness  slider  in the palette to the half way setting.  Repeat what
you did before, but be more sparing with your paint.  Fix the image.

Darken  the  red  a  bit more, so its about twice as dark as before, and
then  just sparingly draw softly around the bottom right.  Fix the image
of the sphere.

We will now give the sphere a shadow.  As the Alpha Channel is set up to
only  let  us  draw  on  the sphere, you will need to select Alpha/Paint
Layer/Invert-Alpha

Set the colour to black.  Now lightly draw the shadow as shown.  Fix the
image, and save your masterpiece!


Appendix I - Introduction to 24-bit Graphics
--------------------------------------------

The  human  eye has the ability to distinguish over 16 million different
shades  and  colours.   A computer that can display this many colours is
said  to  have true colour capability (or photo-realistic graphics).  In
technical  terms, each pixel or dot on the computer screen needs to have
24  bits  (Binary  digits)  to  represent  each colour.  24 bit computer
graphics  are the ultimate in representing photogrophs and images of the
real world.

Although  the  Amiga  1200  and 4000 do not posess a real 24-bit display
they  come  very  close  with  the HAM-8 (Hold and Modify - 8 bitplanes)
display  mode.  This is used for the main Photogenics display to provide
photo realistic displays while editing images.

Image Processing

When  scanning  photographs  into  a  computer,  combining images into a
collage,  or  putting  together graphics for a presentation, it is often
necessary  to edit the source material into a form more suitable for the
selected  application.    In  it's  simplest  format  this  can   be the
conversion of a picture from a foreign graphics file format into another
which  can  be  loaded  by  the  chosen  application program.  In a more
complex  situation  we  might  need  to  sharpen a photograph or make it
brighter.


Appendix II - Common Problems
-----------------------------

Q.    When  I  change the colour in the Palette box and try to paint the
colour stays the same.  Why?

A.   When you have decided on a new colour then you must click on either
the "Use" or "Fix and Use" button in the Palette box.

This  is  one  of  the powerful features of Photogenics, allowing you to
alter  the  colour  or  mode  of any paint you have applied to achieve a
pleasant effect.  If you have applied some paint you are happy with then
FIX  the image.  You may then change the colour and add some more paint.

Q. Why is there no "smoothing" option when loading JPEG picture.

A.    The  smoothing  operation  is no longer supported in code from the
Independant  JPEG Group.  Better smoothing can be applied using the Blur
and  Heavy  Blur  PhotoGenics paint modes or the Gaussic Blur menu item.
Transparency can be increased to give more subtle Blurs and Heavy Blurs.

Q. What is the advantage of the JPEG saver?

A.    The  JPEG format compresses the image using clever algorithms that
give  a  much  smaller  filesize on disk.  However, this compression can
lose  detail from an image (see below), so use IFF Deep or IFF-24 if you
need to keep an EXACT copy of your image.

Q. What effect does the quality setting on the JPEG saver mean?

A.    JPEG  is  what is know as a "lossy" image format.  This means that
some  picture  information  is  lost when the image is saved.  Setting a
higher  quality  will  result  in a saved image that is more true to the
original.    Higher quality increases the filesize.  Small filesizes can
be obtained with lower quality settings but some quality will be lost.

Q.    What  is  IFF-Deep  format, and why is IFF 24 not the default save
format? 

A.    IFF  24  was the first 24-bit file format for the Amiga, developed
long before AGA and before 24-bit graphic cards became available.  It is
badly  designed  for  storing 24-bit Graphics and converting to and from
this file format is a slow process.  IFF-Deep is a much faster format to
work  with,  although the files are larger.  IFF 24 is still provided so
you can import and export files for other older Amiga applications.

Q.   How can I save out pictures that I can use in other Amiga programs?

A.    Most  Amiga  programs  use  the  IFF format for loading and saving
pictures.    Photogenics  can  save two different standard IFF formats -
HAM8  (with the HAM8 saver) and IFF-24.  Most modern Amiga packages will
be able to load one or both of these formats.

Q.   When I draw a line, I cannot undo it with the Undo menu item - why?

A.    The  Undo menu item only affects the lost FIXed chonges.  To clear
the  line you just drew use the Clear Paint Layer button on the Toolbox.

Q.    How do I draw thin lines, boxes or circles?  Every time I draw one
it uses the spraycan to produce big, blurred lines.

A.  You need to change the size and pressure of the brush.  Set the size
to  the  minimum  (1 pixel) and set the pressure to maximum (100%).  You
may find this is not clear enough, if so try a size of 2 pixels.

Q.    Why  does  Photogenics  seem  to  run slower on the new DBIPal and
DBINTSC screen modes?

A.    The new double scan screenmodes have greater system overheads than
the  old  PAL  and  NTSC modes.  Running Photogenics in Pal or NTSC will
give faster operation.

Q.    How  do I add text onto a picture?  I can only seem to create text
into a new image.

A.    Create  text into a new buffer and use Compose with the Brightness
Key option selected to smoothly combine text over an image.


Appendix III - Hints & Tips
---------------------------

Photogenics  will paint faster on smaller image windows.  Try working on
smaller windows.

If  the  painting  speed is slow then try reducing the size of the brush
and maybe increasing the pressure.

When  composing  it  is  often  useful  to  turn  up transparency so the
original  image  can  be  seen  underneath.    This  gives a more visual
indication of the position of the composition.

The  Palette window can be made smaller by clicking on the resize gadget
(the  one  next  the front-to-back gadget, top right).  The colours list
will  be  hidden.    Clicking  on  the  gadget again will bring back the
colours list.

It  is  easier  choosing  colours with HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness)
than  with the standard RGB colour system.  HSB uses three sliders.  Hue
determines  the  base  colour  or  tone of the colour, Saturation is how
saturated  the  colour  is (zero saturation is white, full saturation is
the  colour  at full intensity) and Brightness varies from Block at zero
to  the  full  brightness  of  the colour at the other end of the scale.
When  shading  images  you  often  only need to change the brightness or
saturation sliders.
