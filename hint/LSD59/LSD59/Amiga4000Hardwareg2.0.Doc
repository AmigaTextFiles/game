  Introduction

  The Amiga 4000 Hardware Guide was compiled from online messages posted by
  many different folks, various hints and tips I've collected elsewhere, and
  from my own experiences with the 4000. So it is by no means complete.
  Corrections or additions are welcomed.

  The purpose of the guide is to help make A4000 troubleshooting easier by
  gathering all kinds of Amiga 4000 hardware information into a single,
  easy-to-use guide file.

  This guide is specifically for the Amiga 4000; however, at the prompting of
  several other individuals, I've compiled a short A1200 hardware FAQ to
  address those same old questions I see popping up in c.s.a.hardware all the
  time. Both are or will be available in the hard/misc directory of Aminet.

  All of the people who have contributed are listed under CREDITS. I can't
  thank them enough! At this point in time, information of this type can be
  very valuable in keeping A4000 systems alive and running, and they have
  been gracious enough to freely share this information with everyone.

  Comments on this document should be addressed to the EDITOR.



                               Common Problems

                                Fan Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A4000 makes rattling noises, fan stalls on powerup, or fan does not turn.
  Solution: replace fan. Replacement fans: Radio Shack #273-243 or Panasonic
  FBK-08A12M, available from Digi-Key, Hosfelt, and others (see SOURCES).

  Please be aware that I've seen two styles of power supplies in the 4000;
  the fans may differ slightly. Some older 4000s had a power supply with a
  large hole for the fan, and a bolt-on grill protecting it. This power
  supply used an actual Panasonic FBM-08A12M. A newer power supply design has
  a built-in grill formed by holes in the side of the power supply; in this
  case, the fan is held in place by four odd-looking screws that tapped
  directly into the holes in the fan's plastic frame, and the fan itself is a
  "MAX FLOW" generic.



                             -5V Power Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Problems with large hard disk transfers, discolored Toaster output (pink or
  magenta display of white areas), system crashes, or Emplant diagnostic
  failures. (See EMPLANT REFERENCE.) Solution: U198 7905 -5V regulator is
  probably bad. Replace with new 7905 1-amp -5V regulator (see SOURCES).

  The easiest way to replace this component may be to clip off the leads
  close to the body of the defective part, then trim the leads of the
  replacement and solder it to the old pins.

                                            New 7905 regulator

                           Video Banding Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Display on monitor has faint, darker vertical bands or stripes. See the
  Tips section for the VIDEO BANDING MODIFICATION.



                           Green Display Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Video output from the A4000 has a greenish tint. This may be caused by the
  Sync On Green jumper (J500) being in the wrong position. Unless the monitor
  is set up to receive sync signals piggybacked on the Green video input,
  pins 1-2 of J500 should be jumpered. See Internals/MOTHERBOARD JUMPERS.



                             Backplane Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  After adding or removing expansion cards, system no longer boots, displays
  yellow screen. Solution: too-long resistor and capacitor leads on solder
  side of backplane daughterboard are bent and shorting together. Remove the
  backplane and trim leads.



                           Cable Routing Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Make sure that signal and power cables aren't blocking the power supply fan
  air intake. The floppy ribbon cable can be routed from the motherboard
  between the power supply connector and the power supply itself. If there is
  only one drive installed, excess ribbon can be pushed under it.



                              Battery Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Battery (BT176) is "furry." Batteries can actually leak and destroy part of
  the motherboard, so replacement of corroded batteries is advised. DALCO's
  3.6V 3-pin battery, part #46875, is an almost-identical part: the pins and
  size are identical, but it is rated for 60 mAh rather than the A4000 stock
  battery's 40 mAh.



                           Zorro-III DMA Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Problems with transfers when using 4091 or Fastlane SCSI-2 controller
  boards. Check for revision of Super Buster; the revision 9 chip had
  problems with DMA transfers to or from Zorro-III boards (like the
  controllers mentioned above). Revision 11 of the Super Buster fixed this
  problem. (Note: it is unclear whether there is a problem with Zorro-II
  boards and the revision 9 Buster; Zorro-II or Zorro-III video boards that
  do not use DMA should not encounter this problem, which is not to say that
  there might not be others! Problems may also be encountered with the 2091
  or GVP Series II SCSI controller boards. To isolate this problem, check 
  disk transfers to Chip RAM with a program like Diskspeed 4.2.)

  There can be a software component to this problem, also. Check that
  libs:68040.library is at least version 37.30. Note that due to the way
  the library version numbers are handled, version 37.4 is an earlier
  version. The later 37.30 library handles Zorro transfers better.



                           SCSI Reselect Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  System reports "SCSI Bus Phase Error." Check that all SCSI devices support
  Reselect; if not, disable Reselect mode for the entire bus (how to do this
  varies depending on the SCSI host adapter).



                            Dead Machine Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A4000 does nothing on power-up; keyboard light, power light, and hard drive
  spin-up show that power supply is working, but screen is gray or black, and
  disk drive doesn't click. Possible cause: the motherboard is not supported
  very well near the internal IDE connector. Solution: gently lift the
  motherboard near this connector. Installing an insulating support
  underneath the motherboard near here will be a more permanent solution.



                             Slow 2091 Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  2091 SCSI controller in A4000 performs very slowly. Solution: the 2091
  controller has problems with the A4000 environment (see 2091 REFERENCE in
  the Boards section). Several utilities are available in the "hard"
  directory of Aminet that can help speed up the 2091's performance in an
  A4000.



                              Common Questions

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              Memory Questions

  Question: What type of memory does the A4000 use?
    Answer: The A4000 comes with a single 2M SIMM installed for Chip RAM, and
            has four SIMM sockets for expansion memory (Fast RAM). These
            sockets hold 72-pin SIMMs, either 1M or 4M in capacity, 80 ns or
            faster. All Fast RAM SIMMs must be the same size. To fit
            properly, these SIMMs must be single-sided modules. (These
            specifications describe the motherboard memory; expansion boards
            may use other types of memory.)

  Question: Can the A4000 use 36-bit SIMMs, instead of 32-bit?
    Answer: Yes. The extra parity bits are ignored.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          IDE Hard Drive Questions

  Question: Can the A4000 support two IDE hard drives?
    Answer: Yes, since IDE supports a master/slave drive setup. Make sure the
            DRIVE JUMPERS are set properly for two drives.

  Question: Can the A4000 use IDE hard drives larger than 512M?
    Answer: Yes. The supposed "limit" of 512M is a limitation of the BIOS in
            MS-DOS machines, and the A4000 is not subject to this limit. The
            maximum supported size of a hard drive is 2G (~2000 megabytes).

  Question: Can "EIDE" or "Fast ATA" hard drives be used in the A4000?
    Answer: Yes. These are just revised versions of IDE, and should work fine
            with the A4000's on-board IDE controller.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                          SCSI Hard Drive Questions

  Question: Does the A4000 come with a SCSI or SCSI-2 hard drive controller?
    Answer: No. The A4000T (tower) model did come with a built-in SCSI-2
            controller, though. The A4091 and FastLane expansion boards are
            common SCSI-2 controllers for the A4000, and the 2091 is a fairly
            common SCSI-1 controller.

  Question: Why doesn't SCSI work on the A4000?
    Answer: It does. But because of a bug in early versions of the Zorro-III
            DMA controller (the "Buster" chip), DMA SCSI controllers didn't
            work properly. This problem can be fixed (by replacing the early
            revision 9 Buster with a revision 11 version) or avoided
            altogether (by using a SCSI controller that doesn't use the
            Zorro-III bus, like the one built into the WARP ENGINE
            accelerator).

  Question: What are SCSI terminators?
    Answer: Terminators are resistor packs attached at both ends of the SCSI
            chain. The resistance reduces ringing and noise on the bus, and
            is necessary for reliable operation. Terminators that install
            directly on a drive are usually black or yellow SIPs (Single
            In-line Package), and there may be one, two, or three of them. An
            alternate method is to package the resistors into a connector
            which may be plugged into an external SCSI port. These
            terminators may be of several types: a Centronics 50-pin
            connector, a DB-25, or a high-density 50-pin "SCSI-2" connector.
            Finally, there are "passive" terminators like the SIP packs
            described above, and "active" terminators that incorporate a
            voltage regulator to do a more precise job. An active terminator
            may work when a passive one won't, but they tend to cost somewhat
            more than the passive variety.

  Question: What is the proper setup for SCSI termination?
    Answer: Both ends of the SCSI chain need to have terminators, and there
            should be none in the middle. If you have a controller and one
            hard drive, there should be terminators on each. For a larger
            chain, just make sure that the end devices are terminated, and
            those in the middle are not. Don't forget that the controller
            counts as a device on the chain. (Now, the catch: some SCSI
            devices are not very compliant with the SCSI specification, and
            require oddball setups. Devices made within the last couple of
            years are usually pretty compliant.)

  Question: Can a SCSI-1 drive be used with a Fast SCSI-2 controller?
    Answer: Yes, and vice versa. SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 (and Fast SCSI-2) are
            compatible. Of course, a SCSI-1 drive won't go any faster when
            plugged into a Fast SCSI-2 controller; neither will a Fast SCSI-2
            drive connected to a SCSI-1 controller go any faster than SCSI-1.

  Question: What is the pin-out for a DB25 SCSI connector? What about the
            standard 50-pin SCSI header?
    Answer: See the Drives/SCSI PIN-OUTS section for both.

  Question: Will SCSI hard drives meant for the Mac work on an A4000?
    Answer: Yes. The cable included with most external Mac hard drives is a
            DB25-to-Centronics 50 adapter, and this will work on a SCSI
            controller with DB25 external SCSI port. Software is available
            for accessing an existing Mac filesystem, so file interchange
            with a portable SCSI device is possible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                              CD-ROM Questions

  Question: Will an EIDE CD-ROM drive work with the A4000's IDE interface?
    Answer: Not unless you can locate a replacement for the scsi.device
            driver, which isn't capable of dealing with CD-ROM drives. SCSI
            is usually simpler to set up. Beware of pseudo-IDE CD-ROM drives,
            like the older Mitsumi, Panasonic, and Sony drives which will not
            work unless you have a special interface board for them.



                                     Tips

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           Connecting VGA Monitors

                           Video Banding Modification

                           Connecting VGA Monitors

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  VGA monitors can be connected to the A4000; however, since the special
  circuitry in the Amiga video output can mistakenly identify a monitor as a
  genlock and thus cause problems, a special cable or adapter is the best way
  to hook them up. All this cable really does is buffer the horizontal and
  vertical sync signals by double-inverting them through a TTL gate.
  Commodore's DB23-to-HDD15 adapter (supplied with most A4000s) used a
  74HCT08 for this, but you can use a 74LS04 or other low-power TTL-level
  inverters (or other gates wired as inverters, of course).

  Remember that most VGA monitors won't sync at 15.75 kHz, so you'll have to
  set the A4000 to use the Double NTSC (or Double PAL) or Multiscan video
  modes. Even using these modes, the video output may not work with some VGA
  monitors, since some of the modes use horizontal sync frequencies as low as
  23 kHz, and normal VGA starts at 31.5 kHz. Using the VGAOnly monitor driver
  will bump these frequencies up a bit, perhaps enough to make them usable
  with picky monitors.

                         Video Banding Modification

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Video Banding Modification: Many (most?) A4000s show some faint vertical
  bands on the display. There is a modification to prevent this, but, like
  anything else, it has advantages and disadvantages.

  Advantages:
    Removes vertical bands from display.
    Simple modification.
    Relatively easy to disable.

  Disadvantages:
    Interferes with operation of attached genlocks and deinterlacer
    boards like the Amber A2320 board (see Boards/A2320 'AMBER' REFERENCE).

  The modification involves connecting pin 15 of the video port connector
  through a 100 ohm, 1/4 watt resistor to ground. This can be done inside the
  A4000, but it's safer and more versatile if the modification is performed
  on the DB23-to-HDD15 adapter that was included with the A4000. That way the
  adapter can be unplugged from the machine if a genlock or Amber board is to
  be used.

  There are two grounds on the adapter PC board: shield ground and video
  ground (pins 16-20). Since all the other components on the board use the
  video ground, it seems reasonable to use it for this modification, rather
  than the more-easily-reached shield ground. The resistor fits nicely on the
  bottom of the adapter PC board, running from pin 15 to pin 18 of the
  connector's soldered pins. 



                          Processor Board Mounting

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The nylon standoffs that hold the A3640 processor daughterboard in place
  grip the board very, very tightly, making removal difficult and prone to
  flexing this fragile board. Pushing the two halves of the standoff together
  with needle-nose pliers makes it somewhat easier to remove the processor
  board, but it may still be a fight, putting stress on the motherboard, the
  processor board, and the person removing it. After removing the board, you
  can clip off one "prong" of the side that plugs into the processor board.
  If you leave one of these prongs in place, the processor board will still
  be held firmly in place, but removal will be much easier, next time,
  anyway. If you are afraid that the processor board will not be held firmly
  enough, do this modification on only two of the standoffs.

                              Processor Cooling

  A company called PC Power & Cooling makes a stick-on cooling fan for the
  486 processor that just happens to fit the 68040 perfectly. The fan uses a
  stick-on backing to attach to the chip, so you don't have to mess with
  little clips or spring wires. It spins on ball bearings instead of a
  bushing, so life expectancy is claimed to be 50,000 hours instead of the
  ordinary bushing fan's 5000 hours. A disk-drive power connector powers the
  fan. Finally, it's only .6 inches high, no more than the heat sink that
  comes with the A3640 processor board. PC Power & Cooling calls it the
  "CPU-COOL," and they sell it for $24. In the United States, you can save a 
  few dollars by ordering it from large mail-order companies like PC
  Connection.

  Jumper Listing:

    J351: DF1 Enable
          Closed: Enable low-density (880K) floppy as DF1.
          Open:   No DF1 *OR* for high-density (1.76M) DF1.

    J852: Fast RAM SIMM Size (Chip RAM is always 2M.)
          256K: 1M SIMMs.
          1M  : 4M SIMMs.

    CN404: Internal Audio Connector
           Audio signals attached here will be mixed with the A4000 audio
           output. The A4000 audio is somewhat louder than the normal line
           level output from most CD-ROM drives, presumably to make sound
           effects audible over background music. Setting the software-
           controlled A4000 audio level lower (to 32 instead of 64) will help
           match the levels.

                               A3640 Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The A3640 is the stock 68040 processor board that comes with most A4000s.
  It contains a 25 MHz 68040; some boards came with the 68LC040, which is a
  68040 with no built-in math coprocessor functions. The A4000 User's Guide
  has instructions on upgrading from a 68EC040, which has no math coprocessor
  or memory management unit (if any A4000s were ever shipped with 68EC040
  processors, there were very few of them). Some A3640 boards (notably,
  revision 3.1 boards with U209 marked as "-02" or "-03") can be used in
  A3000 or A3000 tower computers.

                    68020/68030 Processor Board Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This processor board is the board supplied with the A4000/030. It may
  contain a 68030, 68EC030 (functionally equivalent to the 68030 but without
  a memory management unit), or even a 68020 processor. The 68020 option was
  apparently for an extremely low-cost version of the A4000; it is unlikely
  that any boards using the 68020 were ever sold.

  A possible cost-reduced variation of this processor board has no jumpers.
  This type of board has a PLCC socket for the math coprocessor, which runs
  at the same speed as the processor.

                            Warp Engine Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Warp Engine is a popular 68040 processor board that replaces the A3640.
  It includes four 72-pin SIMM sockets and a Fast SCSI-2 host adapter.

  Memory: Any combination of 4M, 8M, 16M, or 32M 72-pin SIMMs, either 32-bit
  or 36-bit wide. Add them starting with SIMM4 and working down to SIMM1. It
  is advised that you put your largest SIMM in the SIMM4 socket.

  SIMM Speed: For a 28 MHz Warp Engine, 80 ns SIMMs are adequate. A 33 MHz
  Warp Engine requires 70 ns SIMMs, while a 40 MHz board needs 60 ns.

  SIMM Types: Single or double-sided SIMMs will work, although the double-
  sided 16M SIMM is not recommended due to high power consumption. (This
  probably also applies to double-sided 32M SIMMs; the Warp Engine manual
  doesn't say so, perhaps because they are rare at present.)

  Upgrading: All that is required to convert a 28 MHz Warp Engine into a
  33 MHz or 40 MHz Warp Engine is to replace the oscillator and processor.

                           A2320 'Amber' Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The A2320 is a video deinterlacer board originally built for the A2000. It
  is essentially the motherboard deinterlacer circuitry from the A3000 on a
  board. Based on the Amber chip used in the A3000, the board is often
  referred to as the Amber board. Physically, the board is designed to fit
  into the video slot of an A2000. Electronically, it works fine in an A4000.

  Why would you need a separate deinterlacer board when the A4000 already has
  AGA circuitry that can scan-double? If you have a VGA or multisync monitor,
  there are two main reasons:

  A. Not all programs can be mode-promoted to "double" screens through
     software (games, for instance). The Amber board will scan-double all
     15.75 kHz screens.

  B. The AGA "double" modes are not truly double in frequency. A 640x200
     "doubled" screen syncs at about 27.5 kHz, not the 31.5 kHz that you'd
     expect. Some multisync monitors can't sync this low. With an Amber
     board, the output is 31.5 kHz, the same as "stock" VGA.

  Physical Mounting

  A modified "slot cover" can be attached to the back panel of the Amber board
  to allow it to be attached securely to an A4000 slot. You'll also need to
  trim a bit off the "top" of the Amber's metal panel to allow clearance for
  the A4000 case (a nibbling tool is useful here). The board will only fill
  part of A4000 video slot; it looks funny this way, but it works.

  Don't remove the enable/disable switch! The Amber gets confused by some of
  the "doubled" screen modes, and rather than passing them through, tries to
  double them to 55 kHz or above! On these modes, you'll need the disable
  switch to force the board to pass the video through. (Productivity mode is
  passed through correctly, since it was part of the ECS chip set that was 
  around when the Amber board first came out.)

  Disadvantages

  The Amber board was designed before AGA came out, and doesn't really under-
  stand AGA. As noted above, some modes are not passed through properly unless
  the board is disabled with the switch. Also, I believe that AGA screens with
  more than 32 colors or HAM-6 will have the colors quantized to a certain
  degree, although I haven't really been able to prove this. It hasn't been a
  problem so far. Games that use the AGA color abilities but don't allow for
  promoting their screens to doubled modes are the only likely sources for
  this trouble.



                              Emplant Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Emplant is a Zorro-II board that, in combination with the appropriate
  software, makes it possible to emulate other computers on the Amiga system.

  The Emplant hardware performs several functions. Sockets are provided for
  both DIP- and SIMM-packaged ROMs (the ROMs of the "target" computer are
  installed on the board, then copied to image files, then removed). Also
  provided are two Macintosh-type serial ports and a basic, no-frills, non-
  autobooting SCSI-1 interface based on the 53C80 SCSI chip.

  Dual serial ports and the SCSI controller are optional, and some models of
  the board come without one or both of these options.

  Early versions of the board came with "ST" brand serial chips or "LOGIC"
  brand SCSI chips, both of which caused various problems with their
  respective ports. Utilities Unlimited has offered free replacements for
  these problem chips in the past. Contact them at:

      Utilities Unlimited International, Inc.

  A commonly-defective -5V regulator on the A4000 motherboard can cause the
  Emplant board to fail diagnostic tests and not perform properly in other
  ways, including unreliable operation of AppleTalk devices. See the Common
  Problems section on -5V POWER PROBLEMS for more information.

                               2091 Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The 2091 is a Zorro-II DMA SCSI hard drive controller that was originally
  introduced with the A2000HD. Because of the 2091's high availability, it is
  often found in A4000s, even though it performs very slowly in them. The
  2091 apparently can't use DMA to transfer data to 32-bit Fast RAM, and so
  uses a very small buffer in Chip RAM, making for extremely slow disk
  transfers. There are utilities in the "hard" directory of Aminet that may
  help alleviate this problem.

  ROM revisions are a common problem with the 2091; 6.6 or later ROMs are
  recommended.

  Sixteen sockets allow for the addition of up to 2M of 16-bit Fast RAM,
  using CMOS 256K x 4 DRAMs (44C256) rated at 120 ns or faster. (This is not
  normally very useful on the A4000, since a SIMM added to the motherboard
  RAM sockets is simpler to obtain and install, and will operate *much* more
  quickly.)

  Usually looked on as a cheap (sometimes very cheap) way to access SCSI
  peripherals from the A4000, the 2091 is certainly better than no SCSI
  controller at all.

                     Building An External SCSI Connector

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Pin connections for external SCSI-2 half-pitch connector:

  NOTE: Connector is VIEWED     |\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/|
  FROM THE BACK, or inside      |  1                       49  |
  of the computer.  All odd-    |  --------------------------  |
  numbered wires go to the      |  \\                        /  |
  top of the connector, and     |   ------------------------   |
  all even-numbered wires go    |  2                       50  |
  to the bottom.                |/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\|

  Procedure: obtain the connector from REDMOND CABLE. Split the 50-pin SCSI
  ribbon cable connectors back a couple of inches. Start with pin 1, lay it
  in the crimp-on pins at the upper left of the connector (again, viewed from
  the back of the connector). By placing the two sides of a small pair of
  needle-nose pliers on the wire on either side of the crimp pins, you can
  gently force the wire down into the V-shaped gap between them. Locate wire
  #2, then use the same procedure to connect it to the other side of the
  connector. Repeat for all 50 wires, then clip the plastic retaining clips
  onto the connector and give it a final squeeze to make sure all wires are
  making contact.

  You can cut a hole in the A4000's "Expansion" port cover on the back of the
  machine to hold this new connector (a "nibbling" tool works well for this).

  Don't forget proper SCSI termination: the devices at both ends of the chain
  should be terminated. If the internal SCSI cable leads from the controller
  to an internal drive, and then to this connector, the internal drive must
  be unterminated for this port to be functional. When used in this
  configuration, the external device plugged into this port needs to be
  terminated. Half-pitch terminators are available from DALCO; using one of
  these would allow you to operate the A4000 with or without an external SCSI
  device without having to open up the computer to change termination.

  Information needed! Who made it? Common problems? Pinouts for connectors?
  Tips?

  Similar to the 1084, with SCART and composite video connectors. Probably
  made by Philips. The 1081 may have only been distributed in Europe.

  A common problem is for the monitor to "pop," then go dark. Hitting it may
  bring back the picture. This is often caused by cold or cracked solder
  joints on the flyback transformer, which resoldering should cure.



                               1084 Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Information needed! Who made it? Common problems? Pinouts for other
  connectors? Tips?

  The 1084 and its variants (1084S, 1084S-P, 1084-P, 1084S-P2, 1084-D, and
  2080) are all 15.75 kHz monitors. They do not handle AGA "double"
  screenmodes, nor will they display the deinterlaced output from the A2320
  Amber board or the motherboard deinterlaced output on an A3000. However,
  they will show all normal 15.75 kHz displays, and many (most? all?) of the
  1084 versions have a separate input for composite video.

  Common problems:
    * The door covering the front-panel controls is typically broken off.
    * The attached cables or connectors on some models tended to fail,
      causing loss of color.
    * Failed or insufficient insulation may cause arcing.

  Only the six-pin DIN connectors are used for analog RGB. Some 1084 monitors
  also have digital RGB (PC clone CGA) inputs.

  Other notes:

  * The 2080 was a long-persistance phosphor variation.
  * The 1084-D may have been made by Daewoo of South Korea.

  This monitor is a 13-inch bisync (not true multisync) monitor built by
  Samsung for Commodore. It has two ranges of sync frequencies to match both
  normal (15.75 kHz) and doubled screen modes. The 1942 differs from the 1940
  only in that it has a smaller dot pitch. MonEd may be useful in getting the
  picture to fill the entire screen. Both variations feature stereo speakers.

  Specifications:

      Sync Frequency: 15.6-15.8 kHz and 27.3-31.5 kHz Horizontal
                      47 Hz to 75 Hz Vertical

           Dot Pitch: 0.39 mm (1940)
                      0.28 mm (1942)

        Sound Output: 1.0 W RMS/Channel at 5% max. THD

    Input Connectors: One permanently attached DB15 and Audio R/L

                               1950 Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Information needed! Connector pinouts, specifications?

  The 1950 monitor was actually produced by a company called AOC. Parts may
  still be available direct (although there have been conflicting reports).
  The AOC model of the monitor was known as the AOC CM314.

  AOC International
  311 Sinclair Frontage Road
  Milpitas  CA  95035
  (408) 956-1070

  A sync problem may be caused by the monitor detecting sync on the Green
  input and then disabling the horizontal and vertical sync inputs. Removing
  the 10K R854 resistor or the 10uf C812 capacitor on the small vertical
  board may fix this.

  The analog/TTL switch appears to be prone to failure. However, if switching
  the switch brings back the picture, it may actually be that the 74LS123
  (IC805) on the same board is failing. The suggested course of action is to
  first replace (or at least resolder) this chip first, since it's a commonly
  available part.

  Another common problem is the failure of a multifunction sync chip.
  Replacements should be available from Sony.



                               1960 Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Information needed! Connector pinouts, specifications?

  The 1960 may have been made by Daewoo (Korea) or a Taiwan company.

  A common problem involves a component that is insulated with eletrical tape
  (inadequately) from the factory, resulting in arcing. Replacing this
  insulation can cure the problem.

  Typical failures also result from cold solder joints on the 1960 boards,
  which can be repaired by resoldering.

  The screen size adjustment pots may be prone to failure, making adjustments
  difficult.



              Idek Iiyama Vision Master 17 (MF-8617) Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This is a fairly popular monitor for use with the Amiga, since it is a high
  quality, relatively inexpensive 17-inch monitor that can sync down to about
  23.5 kHz, and therefore works with most (all?) AGA "double" screenmodes. All
  presets and controls are digital, set through three front-panel buttons and
  an LCD display.  The image can easily be expanded to fill the screen in all
  modes. (See Boards/A2320 'AMBER' REFERENCE for information on the A2320 
  'Amber' board that may be used with this monitor.)

  Specifications:

      Sync Frequency: 23.5 kHz to 86.0 kHz Horizontal
                      50 Hz to 120 Hz Vertical

          Resolution: Maximum 1280 x 1024 at 80 Hz

    Input Connectors: Five BNC connectors and one DB15 (not high density)
                      (A cable is included to connect a HDD15 VGA-type
                      connector to the DB15 connector on the monitor.)

                 Mitsubishi DiamondScan AUM-1381A Reference

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The DiamondScan is one of the few VGA-type multisync monitors that has a
  composite video input, and that made it relatively common for use on the
  Amiga (although I believe that Mitsubishi no longer makes this model). The
  official scan rates cover the range from 15.6 kHz to 36 kHz, so the
  DiamondScan should work with all normal Amiga video modes. User controls
  are standard knobs and buttons, and there are no digital memory features,
  so using it with the Amiga means that you have to juggle the monitor's
  picture location settings along with the Amiga overscan and screen position
  settings. The DiamondScan works fine with the Amber board (see Boards/
  A2320 'AMBER' REFERENCE).

  One feature of the DiamondScan is particularly applicable to the video
  production uses of the Amiga: the "Composite/RGB Select" (pin 22) on the
  DB25 input. Connect this pin through a switch to ground, and then a flip of
  the switch will select composite video or analog RGB display without
  reaching for the switches on the back of the monitor.

  Specifications:

      Sync Frequency: 15.6 kHz to 36 kHz Horizontal
                      45 Hz to 90 Hz Vertical

          Resolution: Maximum 800 x 560 (Rated...normally considered
                                         to be an 800x600 monitor.)
