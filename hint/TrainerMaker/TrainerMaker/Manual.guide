@NODE Introduction

With Trainer Maker it is possible to get unlimited lives, ammunition or
money in every game that does not disable @{"Multitasking" LINK Multitasking}.

To do this, the program modifies the memory addresses of games where several
informations are stored like the amount of lives, ammunition or money

You can even use freezer addresses with this program.

@NODE Multitasking

Multitasking means that many programs (tasks) run simultaneously.
To switch between these you can click the gadget at the top-right position
of the screen or press Amiga (left) and M.

@NODE Interface

Trainer Maker opens a window after you started it.

Format: Changes the @{"numberformat" LINK Numberformats}.

Search: Searches the chosen memory-area (see "From" and "To") for the
        value, that stands under "Value" (see below).
        "Value" is the number, you want to change, for example "3"
        for 3 lives.
        Searching takes a while. A fast processor is commendable.
        A 68020 needs to search at the first 512 KByte approximately 20
        seconds, a 68030/50 only 3 seconds.

If you don't find any addresses:
Values (lives, etc.) are saved at different addresses, so the reason can
be that you just searched in the wrong memory area.
If you've got Fast-RAM, it's possible that the value is saved there.
So search in Fast-RAM or disable it with SYS:System/NoFastMem.
With Sys:Tools/ShowConfig you can see the memory area where your value
COULD be. It's in hex-format so don't forget to enter a "$" before
the address if you want to search in these addresses.

Compare: After searching is completed, change the value in the game and enter
         the new value at "Value". After clicking this gadget all values that were
         found before with "Search", will be compared with the new
         value. If the memory address of a value is the same, the address
         will be shown in the listview on the right side of the window.

Value: Here you enter the number (amount of lives, ammunition, money etc.)
       you want to change.

From: This is the memory address where the program starts to search.

To: This is the address where the program stops searching.

View changes: If more than one addresses are printed on your screen after
              "Compare" and you want to know which one is the right, change
              the value in the game and click this gadget which shows the
              content of all addresses. The address that has the same value
              than the value in the game is the right address.

Modify address: Now you can change the number of lives, money etc. At
                "Adress" you enter the adress you want to modify. At
                "Value:" you can enter the new value you want to have now.
                If you want to have 5000 lives, enter "5000". The adress
                will be modified after clicking the gadget.

M: Disables or enables multitasking while searching to improve the speed.
