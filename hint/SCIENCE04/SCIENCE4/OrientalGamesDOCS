           --------------------------------------------
                     GENERATIONS AHEAD!!!!!


THE START UP OF THE GAME:

ONCE THE GAME HAS LOADED, YOU WILL BE SHOWN THE `DOJO` OR THE FIGHTING SCHOOL.
IN WHICH THE THE ORIENTAL GAMES ARE HELD. OVERLAYED BY 4 ICONS, REPRESENTING
THE CHOICES WHICH WILL BECOME AVAILABLE TO YOU: REGISTRATION FOR THE ORIENTAL
GAMES (WHICH IS THE ONLY CURRENTLY SELECTABLE ONE) OR TO COMPETE IN ONE OF THE
THREE EVENTS--KENDO--KUNG FU--OR KYO KUSHINKAI. THESE WILL BE SELECTABLE ONCE
YOU HAVE REGISTERED.

REGISTRATION:

EVERY TOP MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT DEPENDS UPON HIS COACH FOR SUCCESS, YOUR HAS
TRAINED YOU TO THE PEAK OF YOUR FITNESS, AND HAS TAUGHT YOU ALL THE MOVES
NEEDED FOR THE THREE EVENTS TO PERFECTION. HE HAS ALSO INSTALLED IN YOU THE
DICIPLINE NECESSARY TO TRIUMPH IN THE ORIENTAL GAMES- SHORTLY IT WILL BE UP TO
YOU ALONE TO PERFORM IN THE PACKED AREANA. BUT WHILE YOU MEDITATE IN THE
DRESSING ROOM SUMMONING YOUR `CHI` FOR THE FIRST BOUT, YOUR COACH WILL
REGISTER YOU WITH THE JUDGES, SO THAT THE COMPETION DRAW MAY BE MADE. ALL OF
THE `HUMAN` CONTROLLED PLAYERS COMPETING IN THE ORIENTAL GAMES HAVE BEEN
TRAINED IN THE SAME FIGHTING SCHOOL. SO YOU WILL PROBABLY BE KEPT APART IN THE
EARLY STAGES OF COMPETITION. BUT WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH NEARER TO THE
FINAL, IT`LL BE TIME TO FORGET YOUR FRIENDSHIP WHILST YOU BATTLE FOR MEDALS!

ON ENTERING THE RECEPTION AREA OF THE DOJO, YOUR COACH WILL BE GREETED BY THE
OFFICIAL, SITTING BEHIND THE REGISTRATION DESK. SHE WILL ASK FOR INFORMATION
REGARDING THE COMPETITORS, AND THE TYPE OF LEVEL OF COMPETITION THEY WISH TO
ENTER. THIS INFORMATION IS GIVEN TO THE OFFICIAL VIA THE GAME OPTIONS SCREEN.

THE GAMES OPTION SCREEN:

THERE ARE FIVE FEATURES WHICH MAY BE ALTERED VIA THE G-O-SCREEN. THE FEATURES
ARE SELECTED BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK UP AND DOWN UNTIL THE FEATURES YOU WISH TO
CHANGE IS HIGHLIGHTED. THE OPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR FEATURE MAY
THEN BE VIEWED BY PUSHING THE JOYSTICK LEFT OR RIGHT UNTIL THE OPTION YOU WISH
TO SELECT IS DISPLAYED.

FIRSTLY YOU MUST DECIDE WHICH LEVEL OF OPPOSITION YOU WISH TO BE MATCHED WITH.
DO YOU WISH TO ENTER THE ORIENTAL GAMES AT `NOVICE`, PROFESSIONAL OR MASTER
CLASS, IT IS ADVISEABLE TO ENTER YOUR FIRST ORIENTAL GAMES AT NOVICE CLASS, AS
YOU WILL FIND IT EASIER TO LEARN THE MOVES FOR THE THREE EVENTS WITH NOVICE
CLASS OPPOSITION..IF YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO SUCCEED AT NOVICE LEVEL, YOU CAN
ALWAYS TRY YOUR LUCK AGAINST TOUGHER OPPONENTS LATER ON.

GAME TYPE:

THE REGISTRATION OFFICIAL NEEDS TO KNOW THE TYPE OF COMPETITION YOU WISH TO
ENTER. THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS: TO COMPETE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE ORIENTAL

THE THREE EVENTS. THIS IS DONE BY USING THE JOYSTICK EDITOR. YOU MAY DECIDE TO
SKIP THE JOYSTICK AND USE THE PRE-PROGRAMMED MOVES, BUT YOUR EFFECTIVENESS AS
A FIGHTER MAY BE DIMINISHED, ONCE YOU HAVE USED THE JOYSTICK EDITOR YOU CAN
SAVE YOUR OWN MOVES TO DISK. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY EDITED POSITIONS, AND WISH TO
LOAD THEM. YOU SHOULD SELECT EDIT/LOAD STICK. FULL DETAILS OF LOADING SAVED
GAMES CAN BE FOUND ON PAGE 15 OF THE MANUAL.

THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND THE JOYSTICK EDITOR IS ONE ALLOWING YOU THE FLEXIBILITY
TO CUSTOMISE THE JOYSTICK TO DEVOLOP YOUR OWN FIGHTING TECHNIQUES. FOR EACH OF
THE THREE EVENTS. THERE ARE UP TO 16 JOYSTICK POSITIONS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO
BE CUSTOMISED, EITHER WITH SINGLE MOVES OR WITH COMBINATIONS OF YOUR OWN
CHOOSING.

THERE ARE EIGHT POSITIONS TO BE UTILISED WITHOUT THE FIRE BUTTON PRESSED, AND
EIGHT WITH THE FIRE BUTTON PRESSED.

THOSE ON THE JOYSTICK WITH FIRE BUTTON REFERRED TO IN THE MANUAL BY COMPASS
REFERENCES.....N.NE.E.SE  ETC...FOR CLARITY.

THOSE ON THE JOYSTICK WITH FIRE BUTTON PRESSED ARE LABELED xN, xNE , xE ,X SE
ETC...

THE JOYSTICK ORIENTATION DIAGRAM:

WHEN THE JOYSTICK EDITOR SCREEN IS FIRST DISPLAYED, THE JOYSTICK ORIENTATION
DIAGRAM (WINDOW 2..SMALL WINDOW TO THE RIGHT) SHOWS THAT THE JOYSTICK IS
CENTRED. MOVE THE CURSOR OVER THE JOYSTICK ORIENTATION DIAGRAM AND PRESS FIRE.
NOW WHEN YOU MOVE THE JOYSTICK ORIENTATION DIAGRAM CHANGE ACCORDINGLY. YOU CAN
MOVE THE JOYSTICK TO ANY ONE OF EIGHT POSITIONS. THESE POSITIONS CORRESPOND TO
THOSE LABELED N,NE,E,SE,E ETC...

IF YOU PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON AGAIN WITHOUT MOVING THE JOYSTICK, YOU WILL SEE A
RED JOYSTICK BUTTON ILLUMINATED ON THE JOYSTICK ORIENTATION DIAGRAM.(PRESSING
THE FIRE BUTTON WHILST THE JOYSTICK IS CENTRED WILL TOGGLE THIS BUTTON ON/OFF)
WHEN THE BUTTON IS ON, MOVING YOUR JOYSTICK CHANGES THE JOYSTICK ORIENTATION
DIAGRAM IN THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE. THE POSITIONS YOU ARE MOVING THROUGH NOW
CORRESPOND WITH THE EIGHT POSITIONS LABELED  xN,xNE,xE,xSE,xS ETC...

SELECTING A POSITION:

WHILST HOLDING YOUR JOYSTICK IN ONE OF THE 16 POSITIONS, PRESSING FIRE AGAIN
WILL LOCK ONTO THAT POSITION, MOVING YOUR JOYSTICK WILL NOT ALTER THE
JOYSTICK ORIENTATION DIAGRAM, THE CURSOR WILL REAPPEAR ON SCREEN, AND THE MOVE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOYSTICK POSITION YOU ARE LOCKED ON TO WILL BE SHOWN IN
THE EDITOR WINDOW.

THE MOVES WHICH FIRST APPEAR WHEN A POSITION IS SELECTED ARE THE DEFAULT
MOVES, THE NAME OF THE MOVE IS SHOWN IN THE EDITOR WINDOW, AND THE ANIMATION
OF THE MOVE MAY BE VIEWED BY MOVING THE CURSOR OVER THE EDITOR WINDOW AND
PRESSING FIRE. ALL THE DEFAULT MOVES ARE SINGLE RATHER THAN COMBINATIONS. EACH
JOYSTICK POSITION MAY BE PROGRAMMED TO HOLD UP TO FOUR MOVES TO FORM A
COMBINATION. AS EACH DEFAULT MOVE IS A SINGLE MOVE. THE `1` ICON WILL BE
RAISED TO SHOW THAT THIS IS THE FIRST MOVE OF A COMBINATION.

PRACTISE SELECTING VARIOUS JOYSTICK POINTS AND HAVE A LOOK OF ANIMATED MOVES,
BEFORE THINKING ABOUT DEVISING YOUR OWN COMBINATIONS. ONCE YOU HAVE
FAMILIARISED YOURSELF WITH THE LAYOUT OF THE EDITOR SCREEN, AND THE RANGE OF
MOVES AVAILABLE, YOU WILL FIND THAT THINKING UP YOUR OWN MOVES IS MUCH EASIER.

YOU MAY VIEW THE ENTIRE RANGE OF MOVES AVAILABLE BY TWO OTHER MEANS. DETAILS
OF ALL SINGLE MOVES AVAILABLE FOR EACH EVENT CAN BE SEEN ON THE COMBAT
REFERANCE CHART, SELECT ONE OF THE JOYSTICK POSITIONS, AND ONCE A MOVE IS
DISPLAYED, CLICK ON THE ~NEXT~ OR `PREVIOUS` ICONS TO SCROLL FORWARDS OR
BACKWARDS THROUGH THE RANGE OF MOVES AVAILABLE FOR THAT POSITION. AND THEN
CLICK ON THE MAIN DISPLAY WINDOW TO WATCH THE ANIMATION MOVE.

HOW TO PROGRAM THE JOYSTICK:

TO BEGIN PROGRAMMING THE JOYSTICK, SELECT THE POSITION YOU WISH TO CUSTOMISE
VIA THE JOYSTICK ORIENTATION DIAGRAM. THE DEFAULT MOVE WILL BE SHOWN IN THE
`EDITOR` WINDOW. USE THE ~NEXT~ OR ~PREVIOUS~ ICONS TO SCROLL THROUGH THE
MOVES AVAILABLE UNTIL YOU FIND ONE YOU WANT TO USE. THEN, IF YOU WISH TO
PROGRAM A COMBINATION, CLICK ON ~2~ ICON AND REPEAT THE SCROLLING PROCESS FOR
THE SECOND MOVE OF THE COMBINATION. YOU CAN CHECK THE ANIMATION OF THE
COMBINATION AT ANY TIME, BY CLICKING IN THE EDITOR WINDOW, ANY MOVE WITHIN A
COMBINATION MAY BE DELETED BY SELECTING THE CORRESPONDING ~ICON~ NUMBER AND
THEN SELECTING THE ICON LABELED ~CLR~ TO CLEAR IT FROM THE EDITOR WINDOW,
REMOVING IT FROM THE COMBINATION. IF, FOR EXAMPLE YOU DELETE THE SECOND MOVE
IN A COMBINATION OF THREE MOVES, THE THIRD MOVE AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES MOVE
NUMBER `2`. THEREFORE THE EFFECT SEEN IN THE EDITOR WINDOW WHEN A MOVE IS
DELETED MAY NOT BE TO CLEAR THE WINDOW COMPLETELY, BUT TO REPLACE THE DELETED
MOVE BY THE MOVE WHICH FOLLOWED IT IN COMBINATION.

~PLEASE NOTE THAT CERTAIN JOYSTICK MOVES CANNOT BE CUSTOMISED` AS THEY ARE
RESERVED FOR MOVES NEEDED IN EVERY EVENT. THESE ARE:

FOR ALL THREE EVENTS:  E = WALK FORWARDS
                       W = WALK BACKWARDS

FOR KUNG FU AND KYO-KUSHIN-KAI: xW = TURN AROUND

YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PROGRAM ALL AVAILABLE JOYSTICK POSITIONS. THOSE YOU DO NOT
PROGRAM WILL BE LEFT WITH THEIR DEFAULT MOVES. HOWEVER, POSITIONS MAY BE
CLEARED OF ALL MOVES, LEAVING THEM BLANK. A FULL LIST OF DEFAULT MOVES CAN BE
SEEN LATER ON.

LOADING AND SAVING EDITED JOYSTICKS

ONCE YOU HAVE PROGRAMMED YOUR JOYSTICK, YOU MAY WISH TO SAVE THE MOVES FOR USE
THE NEXT TIME YOU PLAY ORIENTAL GAMES. TO DO THIS,SELECT ICON (9),~SAVE~ AND
INSERT IN YOUR BLANK FORMATTED DISK. A LIST OF THE 16 AVAILABLE SLOTS WILL
THEN BE DISPLAYED IN THE WINDOW. SELECT THE SLOT YOU WISH TO SAVE TO, AND
PRESS FIRE. A BOX WILL APPEAR, INTO WHICH YOU TYPE THE NAME UNDER WHICH YOU
WISH THE EDIT TO BE SAVED, FOR EASE OF ID, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU TYPE IN
YOUR NAME. SIMPLY PRESSING RETURN WILL INSERT YOUR GAME NAME.

ONCE YOU HAVE A NAMED SLOT, YOU MAY USE THAT SLOT TO SAVE EDITS FOR ALL THREE
EVENTS. WHEN YOU RELOAD THE EDITS, THE COMPUTER WILL AUTOMATICALLY RECOGNISE
WHICH EVENT IS BEING PLAYED NEXT.

LIGHTS, WHICH ARE GREEN AT THE START OF A BOUT. WHEN A FIGHTER RECEIVES A
SCORING HIT FROM HIS OPPONENT, ONE OF HIS LIGHTS TURNS WHITE. WHEN THE NEXT
SCORING HIT IS RECEIVED, THE SAME LIGHT WILL TURN ORANGE, THE THIRD SCORING

RESTARTING THE BOUT. IN KUNG FU AND KYO-KUSHIN-KAI, FIGHTING IS CONTINUOUS.

STAMINA FLAGS:

AS THE COMPETITORS FIGHT, THEY SAP THEIR STAMINA, AS THEIR STAMINA DECREASES
THE FLAGS MOVE DOWN THE POLES. WHEN THE STAMINA IS LOW, CERTAIN MOVES
REQUIRING A LOT OF ENERGY MAY FAIL DURING EXECUTION. STAMINA WILL INCREASE IF
THE FIGHTER AVOIDS MAKING ATTACKING MOVES FOR A WHILE.

COMPUTER CONTROLLED FIGHTS:

WHEN NEITHER COMPETITOR IN A BOUT IS FROM YOUR SCHOOL, THE INFO YOU RECEIVE
ABOUT THE FIGHT DEPENDS UPON THE CHOICES YOU MADE DURING THE REGISTRATION
