A bit stuck with Mean Streets?

Here's some hints...


   [1] Go to the Law & Order Office (NC - 5037). Shutting off the alarm is
       your problem. You don't want us to spoil your fun, right? Assumming
       you were successful in turning off the alarm, you can take your time
       turning things over (as the saying goes, "Leave no stones unturned").
       Look for the all important memo. Ask Lee for info. Be generous with
       your offer. After all you got some extra money & ammos from the office.

   [2] Bribe Sonny Fletcher. You have to be a bit more generous with this guy.
       He's got a big fantasy about being Rich & Famous. You don't know where
       to find Sonny? C'mon...

   [3] If you have been really generous with your informants you should have
       no problem finding the man that will lead you to...

   [4] An aching head...It's worth it! You get to meet the Big Man...which
       leads you to a potentially hot & suffocating situation. Be sure to
       wear your gas mask to get out of that one.

   [5] You'll need the Green Pawn, Yellow Queen, Gray King, Black Rook, Orange
       Checkmate, Purple Knight, Blue Bishop & Red Stalemate to keep you from
       getting fried to the crisp with 1000 lasers! Just kidding, it's a lot
       less but you get fried anyway if you fail.

   [6] Take her for a ride in you speeder ala Back to the Future - 17. Oh and
       give our regards to President Michael J. Fox.
