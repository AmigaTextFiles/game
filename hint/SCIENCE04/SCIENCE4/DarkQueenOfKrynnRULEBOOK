                                  RULE BOOK 

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Welcome to the official ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS computer product,
THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN, a DRAGONLANCE fantasy role-playing epic.  
This game is based on the rules and background created by TSR,
Inc. and a story line created especially for this game.

THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN begins two years after the overthrow of Lord
Soth in DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.  General Laurana, the commander of the
united forces which defeated the evil dragons in the War of the Lance,
has requested your presence at her headquarters in the city of
Palanthas.  Responding to her summons brings you face-to-face with
the greatest threat Krynn has ever known.     

Your Game Box Should Contain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o Disks         o Adventurer's Journal
o Rule Book     O Data Card

This Rule Book is designed to explain all your options and guide you
through playing the game.  If you are not familiar with the ADVANCED
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game system, you will find helpful information
about how things work in the Adventurer's Journal.

The Adventurer's Journal contains a variety of information including
details about character classes, magic, combat, and an introduction
to the adventure story.  The Journal also includes the maps, information,
rumors, and stories that you need to play the game.  As you play the game,
you discover for yourself which of the tales you hear are fact and
which are fiction.

The Data Card explains how to start the game and how to select items
and menu commands with your specific computer.  It tells you how to
transfer characters to THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN from the fantasy role-
playing game, DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.  It also shows how to get
right into the game without having to read through the rules.

Transferring Characters from DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN accepts characters who have adventured in DEATH
KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.  (See your Data Card for complete details).

Before Beginning Play
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(See your Data Card for complete details). 
    
Getting Started Quickly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN comes with a ready-made party that allows
you to begin adventuring immediately.  Use the instructions on the
Data Card to load the saved game that has been provided and being playing.
Use this Rule Book to answer any questions during play.
     
Using Menus
~~~~~~~~~~~
All commands are menu based, and menus are displayed either vertically
or horizontally.

Vertical menus indicate a character, item, or spell to be acted upon.
If there are more choices than fit on the screen at one time, use the
arrow keys, or the PageUp and PageDown keys to view the additional
selections.

Example:  When purchasing items, they are highlighted on a vertical list
then purchased with the BUY command.

Horizontal menus list available actions.  In this Rule Book, menus are 
shown with all of their options, although in some cases commands are not 
available every time a menu appears.

Example:  

TREASURE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE DETECT EXIT

The commands TAKE and SHARE only appears if there is treasure to take.  
The command DETECT only appears if there is treasure and the active 
character has a detect magic spell available.

The Rule Book only shows the general menus.  Special menus appear at
various times to give you all available options.

The concept of the active character is central to the game.  Outside of
combat the active character's name is highlighted on the vertical menu.
During combat the active character begins his combat segment surrounded
by a cursor.

If a command affects the whole party, just select the command.  If the
command affects a single character, make that character active and then
choose the command.

Example:  To look at a character's items: highlight the character, then 
select the VIEW then ITEMS commands.  However, to have the entire party 
camp, simply select the ENCAMP command.

BEGINNING TO PLAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To begin playing the game, you must load a saved game or generate
characters and band them together into a party.  

Starting Options

This first menu gives you the initial options.

STARTING MENU

ADD CHARACTER
CREATE CHARACTER
LOAD SAVED GAME
EXIT FROM GAME

ADD CHARACTER allows you to add characters to the party from the saved 
game disk.  A party is a group of characters composed of up to six player 
characters (called PCs) and up to two non-player characters (called NPCs).  
A party should have a balanced mix of characters with different classes.  
For more information about building parties see the "Characters and 
Parties" section in the Adventurer's Journal.  There is an ADD FROM WHERE? 
option that allows you to add characters from either THE DARK QUEEN OF 
KRYNN or DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.
 
CREATE CHARACTER is used to build a new character.  Detailed information 
about characters, races, classes and so on is available in the Adventurer's
Journal.  This command displays a menu to define the following character
attributes.  DONE is used to proceed to the next menu.

* PICK RACE lists the seven races a player-character can be in
DRAGONLANCE.

* CLASS lists the class or classes the character is qualified for
based on race.

* ALIGNMENT lists all the possible alignments for the character based on 
character class.   

* GENDER lists the sex the character can be.  Gender affects the
character's maximum strength.

After you are done selecting these attributes, the PICK DEITY menu 
appears if you have a cleric.  PICK DEITY lists all of the deities 
a cleric character can choose to worship.  Each deity confers unique
powers to its clerics, and determines which alignments a character
can be.  See the "Deities" section in the Journal for more details.


Once all of the attributes have been selected, the computer randomly 
generates the character's ability scores.  If you are not happy with the 
character's scores, you may REROLL STATS to roll them again.  Remember 
that you can use the MODIFY command to change the character's ability
scores and hit points.

Next, you must choose a name for the character.  CHARACTER NAME provides
a 15-letter space to type in the character's name.  This name is
automatically saved to disk.

After naming a character, you must select an icon which will represent
the character in combat from the 49 combat icons provided.  The standard
icon for the character's race, class, and sex is highlighted; the
arrow keys or mouse may be used to change the highlighted icon.  DONE
is used to confirm the selection of the highlighted icon.

o EXIT at any time during character creation aborts the creation of the
current character and returns you to the Party Creation/Training Hall 
Menu.

LOAD SAVED GAME permits you to resume a game that has been previously 
saved.  The saved game provided with THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN can also be
loaded.  There is a LOAD FROM WHERE? option that allows you to load
saves from either THE DARK QUEEN OR KRYNN OR DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.

EXIT FROM GAME ends play without saving the game.

Modifying Characters and Parties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Party Creation/Training Hall Menu shows the characters currently in
your party and lists the commands for creating, modifying, and training
the party.  Not all of the options are available at all times.
     
PARTY CREATION/TRAINING HALL MENU

ADD CHARACTER
REMOVE CHARACTER
MODIFY CHARACTER
TRAIN CHARACTER (Training Hall Only)
KNIGHT NEW ORDER (Training Hall Only)
VIEW CHARACTER
CREATE CHARACTER
DELETE CHARACTER
LOAD SAVED GAME
SAVE CURRENT GAME
BEGIN ADVENTURING
EXIT FROM GAME

REMOVE CHARACTER transfers a character from the party to the saved game 
disk.

MODIFY CHARACTER changes the character's ability scores and hit points.  
Use MODIFY CHARACTER to change a character generated in THE DARK QUEEN
OF KRYNN to match a favorite AD&D game character.  A character cannot be
modified once the adventure has begun.

TRAIN CHARACTER (from Training Hall Menu only) increases a character's 
level when he has gained enough experience points (EXP).  Choose the 
character to train and, if he has sufficient EXP, he will be able to 
advance one level.  If a character has gained enough experience to 
advance more than one level, he will advance only one level and then 
lose all experience points in excess of one point below that required 
for advancement to the next level.  See the section on "Experience 
Points" in the Adventurer's Journal for an example.

Advancing in levels takes no game time.  When magic-users advance, they 
may add a spell to their spell book.  See the "Maximum Level Limits by 
Race, Class and Prime Requisite" chart in the Adventurer's Journal for 
level limits.

KNIGHT NEW ORDER (from Training Hall Menu only) allows a knight of
sufficient experience and abilities to petition for admission into the
next higher order.  Look under Solamnic Knights in the Adventurer's
Journal for more information.

VIEW CHARACTER displays a character's ability scores, readied weapon and
armor, and more.  See the "Viewing Characters" section for more 
information.

DELETE CHARACTER erases a character from the saved game disk.  A deleted
character may not be recovered.
     
SAVE CURRENT GAME stores the current game to the saved game disk or
directory.

BEGIN ADVENTURING starts the game.
     
Non-Player Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During the game, the party encounters non-player characters (NPCs).  
There are three kinds of NPCs: those who volunteer to join the party, 
and those who will only fight.  NPCs that join the party are treated 
like player characters with a few differences.  The computer commands 
NPCs in battle.  They also have morale.  If things are going badly for 
the party, NPCs may run.  Items can be traded to some NPCs, but they 
cannot be traded from conscious NPCs to other characters.  If an NPC 
dies, however, you can use the TRADE command on the Items Menu to take 
his items.  Only two NPCs at a time may join the party, and they may 
take a share of all treasures found.

Viewing Characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Character Summary Screen is displayed anytime you select the VIEW
command.  This screen displays important information about a character,
such as ability scores, current and maximum hit points, readied weapons
and armor, and wealth.

Characters accumulate wealth in the form of gems, jewelry, and coins as 
they go.  The value of gems and jewelry varies, and can only be 
determined by having the items appraised in a shop.  

Encumbrance is the total weight the character is carrying.

Combat Movement is how many squares a character can move during a
combat segment.  This is based on his readied armor, strength, and total
encumbrance.

Character Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OKAY status means that the character has positive hit points and can 
move and fight normally.

UNCONSCIOUS status means that the character has exactly 0 hit points.  
He cannot move or fight, but is in no danger of dying.

DEAD status means that the character has died.  Non-elf characters have
a chance of being resurrected with a raise dead or resurrection spell.  
The character's chance of being resurrected is influenced by his 
constitution.  See the "Constitution Chart" in the Adventurer's Journal.  
     
FLED status means that the character has fled from a battle.  After the
battle he rejoins the party.

DYING (combat only) status indicates the character has between -1 and
-9 HP, and is bleeding to death.  Use the BANDAGE command to have 
another character stop the bleeding before the character dies.
  
STONE status means that the character has been turned to stone.  The
character can be returned to normal with a stone to flesh spell.

GONE status means that the character has been totally destroyed.
Nothing can bring the character back to life.

From the View Menu several options are available to inspect the active
character.  Not all of these commands are available at all times.
     
VIEW MENU
~~~~~~~~~
ITEMS SPELLS TRADE DROP LAY CURE EXIT

ITEMS displays all the equipment the character is carrying and the
Items Menu.  Items preceded by a YES are ready for use.  Not all 
commands in the Items Menu are always available.

ITEMS MENU
~~~~~~~~~~
READY USE TRADE DROP HALVE JOIN EXIT

* READY changes the status of a weapon, armor or other item.  Only
readied items can be used in combat.  A character cannot ready more than
two hand-held items at once.  Arrows and crossbows are assumed to be in a
quiver and can be readied at all times.  Some items take both hands
when readied (bows, quarter staffs, etc.), some take only one (long
swords, wands, etc.), and others take no hands (rings, armor, etc.).  
READY is sometimes abbreviated RDY.

* USE activates an item.  In combat the Aim Menu appears if the item can 
be targeted.  See the "Combat" section for details about the Aim Menu.

* TRADE from the Items Menu transfers an item from one character to 
another.  Highlight an item to trade, select TRADE, then select a
character to receive the item.  Remember: a conscious NPC will not give 
up items.

* DROP permanently removes items from a character.  Dropped items
cannot be recovered.

* HALVE divides a bundle of like items into two bundles.  For example,
HALVE would turn one bundle of 42 arrows into two bundles of 21 each.  
This is handy for dividing items to distribute among party members.

* JOIN combines all like items into one group.  No more than 255
similar items can be joined.  Some items, such as potions, cannot
be joined.

SPELLS is a listing of the spells a character has memorized and can
cast.


TRADE from the View Menu transfers coins, gems, and jewelry from one 
character to another.  Select TRADE, choose what type of money and 
how much to trade, then select the receiving character.

DROP permanently removes money from a character.  Dropped money cannot
be recovered.

LAY is a healing ability of paladins.  Paladins may lay on hands and
heal two hit points per level of damage a day.  Select the LAY command, 
then select the character to be healed.  This command is only displayed 
when a paladin has not yet used it that day.

CURE is another healing ability of paladins - they may perform one sure
disease per week for every 5 levels.  For example, at 1st to 5th levels,
a paladin may perform one, at 6th and 10th levels two, etc.  This command
is only displayed if the paladin has a cure available.

ADVENTURING
~~~~~~~~~~~
After setting up your party and reading the background information in
the Adventurer's Journal, it is time to head for adventure and glory.  
The party will engage in fierce battles, find treasures, and sometimes
have to stop, recuperate, and memorize spells for future use during
adventures.

Display Screens and Points of View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN uses four different points of view: 3-D,
Area, Wilderness and Combat.

3-D appears in areas such as towns or underground.  This view appears in
the top-left view window to show the surrounding area from the party's 
perspective.  Rotate the party's facing and move using the directional 
controls that are described in your Data Card.
     
Area provides an overhead view of the party's surroundings, replacing 
the 3-D view.  Choose the AREA command from the Adventure Menu.  This 
view is not available in many regions.

A cursor in the area display shows the party's position and facing.  
Simply move the party with the direction controls around the area map.

Under the point of the view window are displayed the phases of the three
moons of Krynn.  Solinari is shown on the left, Lunitari is shown in the
center, and Nuitari is shown on the right.  For more information about the
effects of the moons, see the heading "The Moons of Krynn" in the 
Adventurer's Journal.  To the right of the point of view window is a 
list of the party members, showing their armor classes and current hit
points.  Below this list is a compass, showing the direction which the 
party is facing, and a status window, which displays the party's current
location (if known), its current activity (searching, camping, etc.) and
the current time.

Wilderness view displays a map in a large view window with a cursor 
indicating the party's current location.  You get to this view this when 
you leave a town or other developed area.  Use the direction controls
to move around on the map and go from location to location.

Combat view occurs automatically whenever the party engages in battle.
The combat screen is a detailed view of the area the party was in when the
encounter began.

Adventuring Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following menus controls basic adventuring, moving, encamping,
and casting spells.

ADVENTURE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AREA CAST VIEW ENCAMP SEARCH LOOK INV

The party can use the arrow keys or mouse to turn right or left, turn
around or move forward.  Normal movement in 3-D or Area mode takes one
minute of game time per square.  If the party has Search on, each move
takes ten minutes.  Refer to the Data Card for computer-specific 
movement information.

AREA toggles between the Area (overhead) and 3-D view.  This command may
not be available in some regions.

CAST displays the Cast Menu if the active character is a spellcaster.
See the "Magic" section for more information.  Remember: Some spells 
only work in combat, others only while encamped.

VIEW displays the Character Summary Screen and the View Menu.

ENCAMP displays the Encamp Menu.  See the "Encamping" section for a
description of the available commands.

SEARCH toggles searching on and off.  With Search Off, the party takes
one minute per move.  With Search On, the party takes 10 minutes per move 
because they are checking for secret doors, traps, etc.  When a party 
has Search on, SEARCHING is displayed on the screen to the right of the 
point of view window.  Because the party is moving very slowly with 
Search On, the chance for random encounters is greatly increased.

LOOK is used to search an individual square.  A LOOK command acts as if 
the party moved into the current square with SEARCH On.

INV displays a list of the special items and artifacts which have been
acquired by the party.

Encamping
~~~~~~~~~
The Encamp Menu includes options such as saving the game, resting to
heal and memorize spells, and changing items such as game speed or 
party order.
     
ENCAMP MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
VIEW MAGIC REST ALT FIX LOAD SAVE EXIT

VIEW displays the View Menu and the character screen of the active 
character.

MAGIC is a very important part of THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN and is
described under its own heading on page 8.

REST allows characters to memorize spells and to heal naturally.
When spells are being memorized, the initial rest time is established
by the time necessary to memorize any spells selected with the MEMORIZE
command in the Magic Menu.  For every 24 uninterrupted hours of rest in 
camp, each wounded character regains one hit point.  Rest may be
interrupted by encounters.  If possible, find safe places to take long
rests, such as an inn or places that you are told are safe during the
game.

REST MENU
~~~~~~~~~
REST DAYS HOURS MINUTES ADD SUBTRACT EXIT
       
* REST begins resting process.  Unless interrupted, the party rests
for the indicated time.

* DAYS/HOURS/MINUTES selects the unit of time to be changed by the ADD 
and SUBTRACT commands.

* ADD/SUBTRACT increases or decreases the time that the party attempts 
to rest.  Decreasing the time may not allow spellcasters to memorize all 
of their spells.

ALT displays the Alter Menu that is used to change the characters in the 
party and the parameters of the game.

ALTER MENU
~~~~~~~~~~
ORDER DROP SPEED ICON LEVEL EXIT

* ORDER changes how the characters are listed on the screen and how
they are deployed in combat.  Characters at the top of the list tend to
be at the front line in combat.

* DROP eliminates a character from the party and erases him from the
saved game disk.  A dropped character is gone forever and may not be
recovered.

* SPEED controls the rate at which messages are printed on the screen.
If the game is running too slowly, use the FASTER command to speed up
the displays.

* ICON is used to change a character's combat icon.

* LEVEL displays the Level Menu that permits you to adjust combat 
difficulty.  
     
Level Menu
~~~~~~~~~~
NOVICE SQUIRE VETERAN ADEPT CHAMPION 

The game is preset at the Veteran level.  This is the level at which we 
consider the game to be "balanced."  To make the combat encounters easier, 
choose either the NOVICE (easiest) or SQUIRE level.  To make the combat 
more difficult, choose either the ADEPT or CHAMPION (hardest) level.

When you choose to make the game more difficult, you are rewarded
by receiving more experience points from you combat encounters.
When you choose to make the game easier, you are penalized by
receiving fewer experience points from your combat encounters.

FIX is used to heal many wounded characters with a single command.
All characters with at least first level clerical spells memorize as
many healing spells as they can, cast them on the party, and then 
rememorize their previous spells automatically.  FIX takes game time 
and may be interrupted by an encounter.  If the party is severely
damaged, you may need to select FIX more than once.

LOAD allows you to load a saved game to replace your current game without
first exiting from THE DARK QUEEN OF KRYNN.  This may be desirable if
your current game is an untenable position, or if you have accidentally
loaded the wrong game.

SAVE stores the characters and current game disk or directory.  Saved
games may be loaded either from the Starting Menu when you start the game
or from the Party Creation/Training Hall Menu.  Save often- especially
after surviving really tough encounters.
    
EXIT returns to the Adventuring Menu.

Magic
~~~~~
To get the Magic Menu options, the active character must be able to
cast spells.  Spellcasters can get a list of their memorized spells from
the CAST command of the Magic Menu or from the SPELLS command of the View
Menu.  Magic-users can get a list of their spells on scrolls from the 
SCRIBE command in the Magic Menu.

Spells are defined by who can cast them, when they can be cast, their 
range, duration, area of effect, and, of course, their actual effect.  
The "Spell Parameters List" in the Adventurer's Journal summarizes
all of the available spells.  When using spells from the Encamp Menu or
the Adventure Menu (such as find traps or haste), remember that one round 
equals one minute of game time (one normal move), and one turn equals ten
minutes of game time (ten normal moves).  Look in the Adventurer's Journal
for more information on spells land magic.
    
MAGIC MENU
~~~~~~~~~~
CAST MEMORIZE SCRIBE DISPLAY REST EXIT
       
CAST displays the Cast Menu and the character's list of memorized
spells.  Select the spell to cast and then indicate the target of the
spell.  Once a spell is cast, it is gone from memory until it is 
memorized again.  Some spells only have an effect when cast during 
combat and others may only be cast while encamped.

MEMORIZE displays the Memorize Menu, the character's spell book or
clerical spell list, and how many spells of each level the spellcaster
may memorize.  Once all characters have selected the spells they want to
memorize, choose the REST command to actually memorize the spells. 

Remember that spellcasters can have the same spell memorized multiple 
times, and they can automatically rememorize used spells simply by
selecting the REST command.

MEMORIZE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHOOSE SPELL: MEMORIZE EXIT
      
* MEMORIZE selects a spell to be memorized.  A spell is not actually
memorized until it has been chosen from the Memorize Menu and the 
character has rested long enough to imprint the spell on his or her mind.  
After selecting the spells to memorize, the computer verifies your 
choices.

SCRIBE displays the Scribe Menu and a list of all of the spells
on magic-user scrolls.  Before spells can be scribed, they must
either be identified at a shop or the magic-user must cast read magic.
To scribe, select any spells to be scribed into the character's spell
book and select REST to actually scribe the spells.  Scribing a spell 
takes the same amount of time as memorizing the same spell.

SCRIBE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
CHOOSE SPELL: SCRIBE EXIT

* SCRIBE selects a spell to transfer from a magic-user scroll into a
spell book.

DISPLAY lists the magic that currently affects the party.  This
includes spells like bless or invisibility, plus effects like diseases. 
This is an important command because diseased characters cannot regain
hit points until they have a cure disease spell cast on them.

REST is identical to the Encamp Menu command.  Remember: A character's
spells are not memorized until he has rested the necessary time.

CIVILIZATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Towns provide many valuable services and supplies for the adventurer.
In these places you find inns, shops, training halls, temples,
and taverns.  Go to town not only to adventure, but also to purchase
new equipment and magic items, and to rest and regain spells and hit
points.

Inns are safe resting places where party members can recuperate and
regain spells and hit points.

Shops are places to buy and sell equipment using the Shop Menu.

SHOP MENU
~~~~~~~~~
BUY VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE APPRAISE EXIT

BUY displays the items available in the shop.  Highlight the items that
the active character will buy and select BUY.

VIEW displays the character screen with the SELL and ID commands 
available in the Items Menu.

* SELL causes the shopkeeper to make an offer on the highlighted item.
Sold items may not be recovered.

* ID is used to identify an item.  The shop charges 20 steel pieces for
the service.

TAKE is used to pick up coins from the party's money pool.  Select TAKE
and choose the type and amount of coins, gems, or jewelry to take.

POOL places all of the party members' coins, gems and jewelry into a pool 
which any member may use to make purchases.  Use the TAKE or SHARE 
commands to pick up coins, gems, and jewelry from the money pool.

SHARE picks up all the coins, gems, and jewelry from the pool and 
distributes even shares among the party.

APPRAISE determines the monetary value of any gems or jewelry the
character has.  Select Appraise, then choose a gem or item of jewelry,
and an appraisal and purchase offer is made.  Accept the offer and the
item is sold.  Reject the offer and the gem or piece of jewelry becomes
an item on the character's item list.  Gems and jewelry cannot be used
directly for purchases, they must be appraised and sold first.

Temples offer healing spells and perform other clerical services.  
Temple services are free.
     
TEMPLE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
HEAL VIEW REPAIR EXIT
      
HEAL displays a list of the temple's healing spells.  Select HEAL, 
choose the character on whom to cast the spell, and then the spell to 
be cast.

VIEW is identical to the Adventure Menu command.

REPAIR has the clerics cast all of the healing and restorative spells
needed to return your party to full strength and health.

EXIT returns you to the street outside the temple.

Taverns are rowdy places full of gossip, stories and information.
Buy a round of drinks and listen to the stories.

Banks are used to store items and money for you.  The following menu
appears when you select this command.

BANK MENU

VIEW TAKE POOL MONEY ITEMS EXIT

VIEW is identical to the Adventure Menu command except that in the
Items Menu, DROP is replaced by DEPOSIT, which places items in storage.
To store, select ITEMS, highlight an item, then select DEPOSIT.

TAKE allows you to retrieve items and money from storage.  Select TAKE,
then select what to retrieve.

POOL places all of the party members' coins, gems, and jewelry into
storage. 

MONEY is used to deposit money in storage.

ITEMS takes you directly to the Items Menu of the active character 
where you can store items.

EXIT returns you to the street outside of the bank.
 
ENCOUNTERS
~~~~~~~~~~
When a party comes across monsters or NPCs, an encounter occurs.  If
the party attacks immediately, it may receive a bonus to combat 
initiative.  If the monsters surprise the party, the monsters can attack
immediately and get a bonus to their combat initiative.  If the monsters
do no attack immediately, the party can react by choosing from an 
Encounter Menu.  Encounter menus vary, listing options for each situation.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTER MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
COMBAT WAIT FLEE ADVANCE

In this sample menu you have opportunities to fight immediately, wait and
see, run away, or move forward.

COMBAT
~~~~~~
In this sample menu you have opportunities to fight immediately, wait and
see, run away, or move forward.

Combat

In combat the computer chooses the active character.  Characters with
higher dexterity tend to go before characters with lower dexterity. 
A character may hold his action until later with the DELAY command. 
There is more detailed description of combat in the Adventurer's Journal.

The active character is centered on the screen at the start of his
combat segment.  The active character's name, hit points, AC, and current
weapon are displayed.  The Combat Menu lists the character's options.

COMBAT MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~
AIM USE CAST TURN GUARD QUICK 
DELAY BANDAGE YELL VIEW SPEED END

The arrow keys or mouse may be used to move a character to adjacent
squares.  While moving, the number of squares of available movement
remaining is displayed, as are the options UNDO and DONE.  UNDO returns
the character to his original square, but leaves intact any damage 
suffered by the character during the cancelled move.  DONE concludes
the character's movement and allows the selection of another option;
the character may subsequently continue moving with any remaining
movement allowance if no other option is selected.

AIM allows weapons or spells to be targeted.  When aiming a ranged
weapon, the range to the target is displayed above the menu bar.
If a character moves adjacent to an enemy, and has no more movement 
remaining, the AIM command can be used to attack with a melee weapon 
(sword, mace, etc.).  The AIM command can also be used to survey the 
condition of your party and enemies.  As you move the aim cursor over 
a character or monster, information about him is displayed on the right 
of your screen- use this to survey the battlefield.

AIM MENU
~~~~~~~~
NEXT PREV MANUAL TARGET CENTER EXIT

* NEXT is used to look at all possible targets, starting with the
closest target and then going to the next farthest and so on.  NEXT 
and PREV only indicates targets in the character's line of sight.

* PREV (Previous) is the opposite of the NEXT command.  Use this
command to look at the possible targets with the farthest target and
working back toward the character.  This command is most often used to 
select a target for a missile or magical attack.

* MANUAL permits the player to aim anywhere on the map.  However, only 
targets in the character's line of sight can actually be fired at.

* TARGET is used to fire a missile or spell at the enemy where the 
cursor is currently located.  This command can also be used to attack an 
adjacent enemy with a melee weapon (sword, mace, etc.).  If this command
is not displayed, the target is out of range, not in line of sight, or 
invisible.

* CENTER centers the screen around the cursor.  This is helpful when
targeting manually.  

* EXIT returns to the Combat Menu.

USE allows a character to activate an item without having to go
through the View Menu.  Items such as scrolls and wands are then 
targeted with the Aim Menu.

CAST is only available to spellcasters when they have spells available.  
The spellcaster selects from the list of available spells and then 
targets with AIM.  If the character has been hit recently, his 
concentration may be broken and the CAST command does not appear.

TURN is a clerical power that attempts to destroy undead monsters or
drive them away from the party.  This affects only weak undead
monsters.

GUARD sets a character to stand and attack the first enemy that moves
adjacent.  GUARD is only an option if a character is armed with a melee
weapon.

QUICK turns control of the character over to the computer.  Under
computer control, a fighting character with a readied missile weapon
will tends to hang back and attack from a distance.  If a character has
no readied missile weapon, he readies a melee weapon and charges. 
Single class magic-users fire missile weapons and cast spells if magic is
turned on (see your Data Card for details).  They never rush into close 
combat, even if all of their missile attacks are expended.

Consult your Data Card for instructions on regaining manual control
and toggling magic on and off for your computer.

DELAY causes the character to hold his turn until after the other
characters and monsters have acted.

BANDAGE gives first aid to a party member who is bleeding to death.
BANDAGE stops the bleeding and keeps the character from losing more
hit points.

YELL (kender only) orders an active kender character to taunt opponents.
If the taunt is successful all opponents become enraged, suffer a 
combat penalty, and direct as many attacks as possible at the yelling
character.

appears on the Items Menu to permit items such as wands to be used
in combat.

SPEED changes the game speed and is described under the ALT command in
the Encamp Menu.

END quits a character's turn.

When combat is over, you will see how many experience points each
character receives and then the Treasure Menu is displayed.  Most of 
the Treasure Menu commands work like the commands in the Shop Menus.

TREASURE MENU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE DETECT EXIT

VIEW displays the character screen and View Menu.

TAKE permits the active character to pick up treasure from defeated
monsters.  This only appears if the monsters had a treasure or the
party has pooled its funds.  A character carrying a large number
of coins and heavy equipment may be slowed in combat.

TAKE MENU
~~~~~~~~~
ITEMS MONEY EXIT

* ITEMS lists the equipment in the treasure.  Frequently, the weapons
and armor used by monsters are not listed because they are poor quality
and not worth taking.

* MONEY displays the number and type of coins, gems and jewelry in the
treasure.  Indicate the type then number of items the active character
takes.
     
POOL places all of the party members' coins into the treasure.  Use the 
TAKE or SHARE commands to pick up coins from the treasure.

SHARE picks up the money treasure, divides it into shares, and distributes
it among the party.

DETECT has the active character cast a detect magic spell.  Magic items 
in the treasure or party will be marked with an '*'.  This command only 
appears if the active character has a detect magic spell available.

EXIT leaves the scene of the battle.  If any treasure remains, the
option to return to the Treasure Menu is displayed.
