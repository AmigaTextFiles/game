          with maximum combined load od 6000 lbs
     Air-to-Air Radar Quality: No radar; medium range FLIR/TV optical fire
          control system
     Maneuverability: Fair to good

     Created at the Lockheed 'Skunk Works' in Burbank, California, this
     novel aircraft sacrifices almost everything to a nearly invisible
     redar signature. The shape minimizes radar reflections. A large quantity
     of RAM (Radar Absorbent Material) panels, wedges and coatings are
     located on the ventral and dorsal surfaces, including the wings. All
     leading edges are cased in heat-resistant ceramics for minimum infrared
     signature, while engine exhausts are directed through low-signature
     slats.
     The aircraft is designed for all-weather reconnaissance and strike
     missions, but can use its internal 20 mm cannon, AIM-9 Sidewinder, or
     AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles for air-to-air interception and combat. The
     latest version uses a sophisticated zoom FLIR/TV/laser target tracking
     system that allows the pilot to see a close-up picture (either TV or
     thermal) of the target at all times, regardless of angle.
     The aircraft is air-transportable in C-5A Galaxy transports, and can
     be launched and recovered from US Navy aircraft carriers.
                                                                       - 4 -

                                 Introduction:
                                 -------------

     On a moonless night a huge C-5A Galaxy transport plane touches down in
     Saudi Arabia and taxis to a distant hanger guarded by DIA (Defense
     Intelligence Agency) operatives. A large black object is rolled from the
     Galaxy into the hangar. Under red night-lights the hydraulic whine of
     unfolding wings is counterpointed by the hum of fuel tanker trucks
     pumping aviation gas, while sweating ground crewmen hoist bombs and
     missiles into weapons bays. As the Galaxy rools away, an Air Force pilot
     climbs into the black plane, puts on his helmet, and begins preflight
     checkout. Minutes later the distinctive whine of F404 turbofans fills
     the hanger. A strange, rounded shape noses out of the dark hangar
     doorway and onto a runway. A hand pushes the throttle to full forward.
     With a roar the two big turbojets hurtle the craft airborne. Another
     Stealth Fighter mission has begun.
        Tomorrow the U.S. Navy is performing retaliatory strikes against
     Iranian-sponsored terrorism. The Iranian planes at the Shiraz airfield
     must be rendered harmless tonight!
        The dark waves of the Persian Gulf roll 200 feet below the wings. Off
     to the left are the twinkling lights of dueling Iraqi and Iranian
     artillery. Blue light bathes the cockpit: enemy radar is awake tonight,
     but the American fighter is returning a signal too weak for the enemy
     radar to perceive.
        Two hundred miles away, 30000 feet over the Saudi Arabian desert, an
     American crewman sits at one of the 22 consoles on a E-3C "Sentry" AWACS
     plane. The powerful AWACS radars and signals processors are monitoring
     the entire Persian Gulf and southern Iran areas. The crewman's fingers
     dance over the keyboard as he describes aircraft takeoffs, movements,
     and landings, as well as enemy radar and radio activity. Deep inside its
     massive computers, the AWACS encodes the message and transmits it in a
     fast, tight burst.
        Dancing lights play across a HUD 200 feet above the water. As his
     computer decode the radio burst the lone Air Force pilot reads the
     incoming information. His cockpit CRTs automatically update also. He
     makes minute adjustments and examines his consoles once more. Yes, very
     good. He's timed the adjusted flight path so he'll pass behind the enemy
     fighter patrol, their nose radars looking away from him.
        Minutes later, he accomplishes just that, then plunges into the
     desolate mountain valleys of southern Iran. Mountain goats and sheep
     scamper across the descolate highlands as a black roar passes overhead,
     twisting and turning to follow the valley floor.
        At last he passes out of the last mountain range. Then a yellow light
     blinks: they got a good radar return there! Will they alert their SAMs
     and interceptors? It's all academic as the fighter's nose rolls downward,
     aiming at the military airfield on the outskirts of Shiraz.
        The throttle goes to the wall and a rolling sonic boom follows behind
     the
                                                                       - 5 -

     dark avenger. Warnings blin as Iranian radars suddenly see an intruder
     directly overhead. Sirens erupt, sleppy SAM crews leap to their radar
     consoles while fighter pilots tumble out of bed. Above, the pilot flips
     arming switches. Targeting symbology flashes up on his HUD while
     underneath bay doors whine open. A weapon pylon extends into the night
     sky, a stubby Maverick missile's FLIR sensor scanning until the pilot
     sees the distinctive heat signature of a HAWK battery controller. The
     missile's brain locks onto the image and its engine flares bright in the
     sky. Simultaneously below the battery commander launches his first HAWK
     surface-to-air missile at the intruder.
        The HAWK's control-guidance beams cause new warnings in the cockpit
     followed moments later by a strident klaxon. The missile is just seconds
     away. A cloud of aluminum chaff erupts behind the intruder. The HAWK
     attacks the cloud and explodes far behind the stealth fighter. Seconds
     later the slower-travelling Maverick hits the SAM controller's bunker,
     wrecking its radar and communications gear, disabling the entire battery.
        The black fighter rools steeply, airbrakes out. The sonic boom roars
     ahead of it, crashing over the airfield like the thunder of the gods.
     Five hundred feet above the tarmac two Durandals drop from a weapons
     pylon, chutes springing free at the tail of each. The bombs nose
     downward, floating in air over the runway. Then rocket motors explode
     and the bombs leap toward the ground, armored heads cutting through the
     thick concrete. Three feet down the warheads explode, hurling slabs of
     concrete in all directions.
        The American pilot loops around and dives over the runway again. Two
     huge craters sit squarely in the middle, while nearby a number of
     carelessly parked jets are crumpled under pieces of concrete. A major
     unit of the Iranian air force is now grounded, unable to fly until
     lengthy repairs are made. In a single blow over forty enemy aircraft
     have been rendered harmless.
        The black plane roars away into the mountains at 200', closing his bay
     and switching off jammers. To the military search radars all around,
     watching in helpless fury, the intruder seems to disappear. Interceptors
     vectoring in from other bases block the airwaves with confused chatter.
     The American pilot smiles and throttles back for the slow cruise home,
     another F-19 Stealth Fighter mission accomplished.
                                                                       - 6 -
                                  Quickstart:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You have three options when learning to fly your F-19 Stealth Fighter.
        Try & See Method: You can juust dive and try things out, referring to
     this manual and the Technical Insert as necessary. In this case we
     strongly suggest that you (a) use the keyboard overlay, and (b) glance
     over "Aircraft Controls" in Part II (pages 34-48) to familiarize yourself
     with the HUD and cockpit. As you fly, you'll find Part II in general to
     be an excellent reference aid. Be warned, the F-19 is a complex aircraft.
     Sooner or lter you'll have to look at the manual.
        Tutorial Method: You can use the "Quickstart" method described below
     for your first flight, or you can work through the more detailed tutorial
     on pages 11 through 23. If you like to be guided through a situation, we
     suggest the full tutorial. Note that the tutorial urges that you atleast
     skim through Part II (pages 34-38)
        Study Method: You can study the actual controls and operating
     instructions for the craft, then attempt to fly it. This is what real
     pilots do (or should do). In this case, read all of Part II (pages 34-38)
     before flying, and refer back on the section as necessary. You can use
     the tutorial on your first flight, or skip it, as you prefer. However,
     we suggest a practice mission as your first flight.

     ========================================================================
     Abbreviated Tutorial
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        1. Install the game as suggested onto floppy disk or hard disk (if you
     have one). See "Installation" in the Technical Supplement for details.
     You can skip installation, but if you do none of your records can be
     saved.
        2. Load the Simulation: see "Loading Instructions" in the Technical
     Supplement for details and specific commands.
        3. Answer the Aircraft Identification Quiz: Check the back part of
     this manual ("Warplanes", pages 157-169) to see what aircraft is
     illustrated. If you give a wrong answer, you are automatically sent for
     training. If you give the correct answer, you are given a complete
     selection of all options.
        4. Log onto the Pilot Roster: Following the instructions on the screen
     erase one of the pilots on the roster and type your name. Enter the name
     by tapping the "Return" or "Enter" key.
        5. Accept the Current Mission: As a new pilot, your first assignment
     is a standard training mission. We suggest you accept this challenge. The
     default options are:

          * Libya region
          * Conventional War situation
          * Strike Training as your mission
          * Green Opponents
          * No Crash flight realism
                                                                       - 7 -

        6. Intelligence Briefing: Be sure to highlight and read both of the
     following options:

          * Mission Targets
          * Flight Plan

     These describe your objectives, takeoff and landing points, and the Rules
     of Engagement (what you should and shouldn't destroy). See page 29 for a
     more detailed description of the Intelligence Briefing screen, its
     options, and information.
        7. Arming Complete: Use the default armament, so select the "Arming
     Complete" option on this screen.
        8. Begin Mission: Select this option to start your training mission.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flying the Mission:

     If you selected the starting options described above, you're flying a
     training mission. This is just right for your first flight, since in
     training enemy weapons do no damage. On the first mission we recommend
     you concentrate mainly on flying, with a bit of simple weapons use, and
     ignore all those enemy planes and missiles buzzing around.
        A Quick Checkout: Place and examine the keyboard overlay. This device
     is an invaluable aid in flying your F-19.
        Find the Pause key command on the overlay. This command is always
     useful while learning.
        Skim through "Aircraft Controls", pages 34-48 of this manual. They
     describe the cockpit and HUD (head-up-display). You'll need some
     familiarity with these before you fly.
        This first mission is exactly the mission described in the "Tutorial"
     (pages 11-23). You're invited to follow the step-by-step instructions of
     the tutorial.
        You are also invited to look at the Simulation Controls, especially
     the Out of Plane Views (see pages 31-33). Experiment with these on your
     first few flights. You'll find the views quite interesting, and often
     quite useful.
        1. Takeoff: Power up the engines (tap the Max Pwr key) and release the
     Brake (tap the Brake key) to fire the aircraft carrier catapult. Once
     your aircraft passes stall speed (stall speed bar drops below the center
     tickmark on the left-hand HUD gauge) you can pull up the nose. You must
     do this as you clear the carrier's deck, or else you'll fall into the
     sea. Tap the Gear key to retract your landing gear.
        See "How to Fly" (page 49) for a more detailed description of takeoff
     procedures.
        2. Fly to Your Target: Turn on the autopilot (tap the Autopilot key)
     to get on course to your target. Every time you touch the control stick,
     the autopilot automatically turns off. Therefore, you can experiment a
     bit with flight on the way to the target, then turn the autopilot on
     once more to get you back on course.
        You'll be using your AGM-65D Maverick missiles to attack the target,
     so you might want to read "How to Fight", especially page 57, which
     describes how to operate this weapon.
                                                                       - 8 -

     Tap the Ordnance key to see which weapons are aboard your plane. Next
     find the select Ordnance key and tap that, rotating through the various
     weapons until AGM-65D "Maverick" is highlighted. You'll notice its name
     also appears in the lower left corner of the HUD.
        3. Attack the Target: When you get close to the Libyan coast, switch
     the HUD to air-ground mode (tap the HUD Modes key until the bottom-center
     label of the HUD is "AIR-GROUND") and turn on your tracking camera (tap
     the Cam Ahead key). If your primary target, the Tripoli Depot, does not
     appear in the lower right cockpit CRT, tap the Select Target key until
     it does.
        Up on your HUD, you'll notice a box appears around an area of ground
     when the tracking camera finds the target. As you get closer, the box
     changes to a circle on the CRT screen shows the words "Missile Lock".
     Your Maverick missile is now locked on and ready to fire.
        To fire, first open the weapons bay (tap the Bay Doors key), then tap
     the Fire Ordnance key to release your Maverick missile. It will find its
     own path to target. If you want insurance, wait a second or two, then tap
     the key again to fire the second missile at the same target.
        4. Finishing the Mission: You can either continue the mission
     according to the tutorial instructions, or you can return home
     immediately.
        To return home immediately, tap the Select Way Pt key to display the
     waypoints list on your right-side cockpit CRT. Then tap the Next Point
     key until the last of the four waypoints is highlighted. This point is
     your final destination, your landing strip. Now that the proper waypoint
     is set, you can tap the Autopilot key. The autopilot will turn the plane
     onto course for home.
        As you approach the island of Sicily, switch the HUD to navigation
     mode (tap the HUD Modes key until the "NAV" label appears in its bottom
     center) and return to using the tracking camera (tap the Cam Ahead key
     once more). This will show the local airfield on the right-side cockpit
     CRT.
        Landing this hot jet is tricky, if you follow the instructions on
     pages 54-55 you've got a good chance. Fortunately, the simulation is set
     in "No Crash" mode, so you'll survice a poor landing too. To end the
     mission, make sure the plane is stopped by putting the brakes on (tap
     the Brakes key) and then turn off the engines (tap the No Pwr key).

                                                                       - 9 -
                               <<< EMPTY >>>                          - 10 -

                                  1: TUTORIAL
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Your First Mission:

     This tutorial is designed to be your first mission. Flying this tutorial
     is not required. It's purely a convenience. For a faster entry into your
     first game, turn to "Quickstart" on page 7. If you prefer to study the
     aircraft before you fly it, go directly to Part II on page 25. 
        In either case, before you start the simulation you may wish to
     install it on either floppy disks or a hard disk (see "Installation" in
     the Technical Supplement for details). You can run the simulation
     without installation, but no information is saved.
        Now load the installed game (or the original disks, if yoy didn't
     install it) into your computer. See "Loading" in the Technical Supplement
     for details.
        Your first mission is a practice strike against a SAM radar
     installation guarding the city of Tripoli, in Libya.

     Terminology:

     Keys: Each key control has a name in UPPERCASE LETTERS, which appears on
     the keyboard overlay. A master list appears in the Technical Supplement.
        CONTROLLER refers to the pointing device used by your computer. This
     may be a mouse, joystick, or cursor keys, depending on your hardware.
        SELECTOR refers to the mouse button, joystick trigger, return key, or
     enter key, depending on your hardware setup. See the Technical Supplement
     for details.
        During flight, the function of joystick and mouse buttons are defined
     in the Technical Supplement. For example, on a typical two-button
     joystick, the first button acts as the FIRE CANNON key, the second as
     the FIRE ORDNANCE key.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Preflight Briefing Options:

        Answer the Aircraft Identification Quiz: Check pages 157-169 of this
     manual to see which aircraft is illustrated. Although a correct answer
     is not necessary for training missions, it's wise to acquire good habits.
        Log onto the Pilot Roster: Following the instructions on the screen,
     use the CONTROLLER to select a name to erase, press the proper key to
     erase it, and type your name. Finish entering your name by tapping the
     "Return" or "Enter" key.
                                                                      - 11 -

        Accept the Current Mission: As a new pilot your first assignment is
     always this training mission. Use the CONTROLLER to highlight Accept
     Mission and then press the SELECTOR. The tutorial training mission uses
     the following selections: LIBYA region, CONVENTIONAL WAR situation,
     STRIKE TRAINING as the mission category, GREEN opponents, and NO CRASH
     flight realism.
        Inteligence Briefing: The briefing map shows the general topography
     of the area, your takeoff point (T), your primary (P) and secondary (S)
     targets, and your landing point (L).
       Be sure to highlight, select and read each of the following options:

          * Mission Targets
          * Flight Plan

     These describe your objectives, takeoff and landing points, and the Rules
     of Engage,ment (what you should and shouldn't destroy).
       A wise pilot also investigates the other options. If you wish to, see
     "Intelligence Briefing" on page 29 for details.
        Arming Complete: You'll use the default armament, so highlight and
     select the ARMING COMPLETE option on this screen.
        Bgin Mission: Highlight and select the BEGIN MISSION option to start
     your training mission.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Helpful Hints:

        No Danger: In practise missions, enemy weapons do no damage. You can
     safely ignore enemy aircraft and missiles. In addition, the "No Crash"
     selection means you cannot crash into the ground and will "bounce" over
     any hills you hit.
        Furthermore, you have an automatic radar altimeter that tries to keep
     you above 200'. However, it onlu makes mild corrections, and is
     therefore helpless if you make truly wild maneuvers.
        "Pause": To use this tutorial best, pause the simulation and read just
     the next few paragraphs, then "un-pause" and resume action for a short
     period. Whenever you're confused, just pause. Note that tapping any key
     (except pause) will "un-pause" and resume the action.
        Resupply: In training scenarios (only) you can get an infinite supply
     of fuel and ammunition. Each time you tap the RESUPPLY key, your fuel
     tank is filled to maximum and your ammunition is increased to the maximum
     possible level. This option is especially useful in target practise.
        A Light Touch: Usa a light touch on the CONTROL STICK. The most common
     pilot error is a "ham-fist" on the stick, throwing the plane around the
     sky in uncontrolled abandon. Only emergencies should cause you to "peg"
     your stick (push it up against the stoppers, beyond which it cannot
     move).
        Chasing the Gauges: When you roll an aircraft left or right, pitch it
     up or down, change the throttle, the flaps, or the brakes, it takes
     awhile for the plane to "settle out". Good pilots fly by making a change,
     then wait a couple of seconds to see the results. If you don't, you'll
     just "chase gauges" that are themselves still changing.
                                                                      - 12 -

     Airspeed settles out much more slowly than other settings. It takes time
     for your plane to build up velocity or lose momentum in level flight.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Familiarization: the Cockpit and the HUD:

        The Controls: Place the appropriate keyboard overlay on your computer
     keyboard. It shows all the controls for your F-19.
        The HUD: The upper half of your screen represents the transparent HUD
     (head-up display), through which you can see the world beyond. The
     various symbols and numbers are described on pages 35-37.
        The HUD has three operating modes: NAV for navigation, AIR-AIR for
     aerial combat, and AIR-GROUND for ground attacks. Tap the HUD MODES key
     to toggle through the three settings. Also note that in the AIR-AIR and
     AIR-GROUND modes the exact symbols depend on the current ordnance. Tap
     SELECT ORDNANCE to toggle through your weapons. If you're unsure of what
     weapons you have on board, tap the ORDNANCE key to see a graphic display
     in your cockpit.
        The Cockpit: The lower half of your screen represents the cockpit of
     your aircraft. The various elements are described on pages 38-39. We
     suggest you toggle through the various CRT displays to get familiar with
     them.
        The left-side CRT has two different map displays. Tap the CRT MAPS
     key to toggle between them.
        The right-side CRT either shows a camera view or a data screen, as
     you prefer. The data displays include:

        DATA key: data on target you're tracking
        ORDNANCE key: the weapons currently in your weapons bays.
        SYSTEM DAMAGE key: which systems (if any) are damaged.
        SELECT WAR PT key: list of the current INS waypoints, including the
     one you're currently being steered toward.
        CHANGE WAY PT key: list of the four INS waypoints, which you can
     change on the satellite/radar map (on the other CRT).
        RESET WAY PT key: resets waypoints to the initial defaults.
        ILS key: toggles instrument landing system graphics on and off the HUD.
        MISSION key: brief summary of your mission order.
        The CRT camera views are a zoom TV (day) or FLIR (night) image of your
     target, with its name, range and bearing superimposed. The camera is
     limited to 80-100 km range (less at night). You have these viewing
     options:

        CAM AHEAD key: aims cameras at nearest standard target ahead.
        CAM REAR key: aims cameras at nearest standard target behind.
        CAM LEFT key: aims cameras at nearest standard target to left.
        CAM RIGHT key:  aims cameras at nearest standard target to right.
        SELECT TARGET key: toggles through all standard targets in current
                           direction.
        DESIGNATE NEW TARG key: aims forward camera at nearest target (any
     type) ahead. For more information on the tracking camera system, see
     pages 43-44.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Takeoff:

     Your mission starts aboard the aircraft carrier America sailing on a
     southerly course in the central Mediterranean. The preflight checklist
     for your F-19
                                                                      - 13 -
     Stealth Fighter is:
        Check your INS system. Tap the CRT MAPS key to display the
     satellite/radar map on your left-side cockpit CRT. Next tap the SELECT
     WAY PT key to display the INS waypoints on the right-side CRT. Look up on
     the HUD and note on the heading indicator the location of the INS
     Direction Indicator, You must fly in this direction to reach the first
     waypoint.
        Check Armament: Check your ordnance (tap the ORDNANCE key) on the
     right-side CRT. As you use the SELECT ORDNANCE key to toggle through the
     weapons, note the active weapon in the lower left corner of the HUD.
        Extend the Flaps by tapping the FLAPS key. Note the "FLAPS" indicator
     in the lower right corner of the HUD, Flaps give you more lift during
     takeoff.
        Check the Catapult System: When launching from an aircraft carrier, as
     you are now, the brakes must be set. This represents attaching the
     aircraft to the deck's steam catapult. If the HUD does not show "BRAKE"
     in the lower right corner, tap the BRAKE key to set the brakes and engage
     the catapult.
        Start the Engines: Turn on your engines by tapping the MAX PWR key.
     Notice the throttle power indicator rising on the far left side of the
     cockpit.
        Activate Catapult: When the throttle indicator shows maximum power,
     tap the BRAKE key. This release the brakes and catapult, hurtling you off
     the deck.
        Accelerate Past Stall Speed: As you zoom down the deck, watch the
     speed scale (left side of the HUD) very carefully. A colored bar on that
     scale will gradually drop down. This is the stall speed indicator. When
     the stall speed bar drops below the center tick on the scale your plane
     is past stall speed. You are travelling fast enough to get into the air.
        Climb: Once you're more than 10 kts faster than the stall speed, pull
     back on the stick a bit to point your nose upward. Be firm, but don't
     pull all the way. Once the nose is skyward, release the stick. Watch the
     altitude scale on the right side of the HUD: you'll start climbing. Don't
     climb so steeply you lose sight of the horizon. That can cause a stall.
        You must start climbing by the time you reach the end of the carrier
     deck. Otherwise you'll plunge into the sea.
        Retract Landing Gear: Once you're airborne, immediately tap the GEAR
     key to retract your landing gear. Don't leave the gear down - high speeds
     can rip off your landing gear.
        Retract Flaps: Tap the FLAPS key to retract your flaps. You no longer
     need the extra lift. Again, high speeds can rip off the flaps, causing
     serious damage to your wings.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flying to the Target:

        Level Flight: Once airborne your first step is to echieve level
     flight. Push the control stick forward or back until the horizon is level
     across the middle of the HUD. Then make fine adjustments until the round
     flight path indicator (on the HUD) cuts through the middle of the horizon
     and you're neither gaining nor losing altitude.
                                                                      - 14 -

        Don't confuse the nose indicator with the flight path indicator (see
     illustration on page 34). Always use the flight path to aim your plane
     (even though the indicator bounces around some). Do not use the nose
     indicator, since a plane's nose and its flight path rarely point in
     exactly the same direction! 
        Since this is a stealth mission, you want level flight at 500' to
     1000'. Look at the altimeter (strip gauge on the right side of the HUD).
     If you're above the lk mark (1000') you're to high. Push the nose down
     into a gentle dive until you reach the desired altitude. Then level out
     and again place the flight path indicator on the horizon.
        Flying on Course: Now it's time to get onto the right course. Look at
     the heading indicator across the top of your HUD, and the INS Sirection
     Indicator (the small, bright triangle somewhere on the top of the scale).
     Turn toward the indicator. As you turn the triangle moves toward the
     center; when the triangle is in the center of the scale you're "on
     course" to the first waypoint.
        To turn, gently pull the stick left or right. The plane will bank.
     Release (center) the stick when the bank angle is about 45o. To increase
     the rate of turn you can pull back on the stick somewhat. As you do this,
     watch your speed (on the left on the HUD) and altitude (on the right). A
     turn with backpressure can slow your plane and rob you of lift, causing
     altitude loss.
        MINIMUM SAFE speed varies with the current situation of your aircraft.
     A "stall indicator" bar will rise from the bottom of the scale when you
     travel too slowly. If this bar reaches the tick-mark in the center of the
     scale, your plane is stalling. In a stall the plane is no longer
     airworthy, and begins to fall out of control, do not stall the plane.
        If you do stall the plane, lower your nose to regain airspeed, then
     pull out into level flight.
        MINIMUM SAFE ALTITUDE is about 200'. However, in this training mission
     stay at 500' above the ground.
        Autopilot: If you're hopelessly confused about which direction to fly,
     and how to do it, just tap the AUTOPILOT key. It will take over
     immediately, turning you onto the current course. If you're below 500'
     the autopilot will climb to that altitude. If you touch the control stick
     the autopilot automatically turns off.
        Enjoying the Flight: Once on course, enjoy yourself by trying out all
     the nifty viewpoints available. You can return to the cockpit at any
     time: just tap the COCKPIT key.
        You can see out the front, rear and sides of the cockpit canopy using
     the VIEW AHEAD, VIEW REAR, VIEW LEFT, and VIEW RIGHT keys. These keys
     assume you are looking past the cockpit area. They give a nearly
     unobstructed view of the outside landscape. In mountain valleys and over
     urban areas the scene can be quite thrilling.
       You can also step "outside" your aircraft and watch it using the CHASE
     PLANE, SLOT VIEW, and SIDE VIEW keys. Bank the plane left and right to
     observe the difference between the chase plane (where you appear to be
     in a plane following in the "footsteps" of the F-19) and the slot (where
     you remain behind
                                                                      - 15 -

     the F-19 and always remain level). Although the chase plane is more
     visually exciting, the slot view is handy when learning aerobatics.
        The TACTI VIEW, INVRS TACTI and MISSILE VIEWS are used in combat
     situations. See pages 31-33 for more detailed description of these
     options.
        Passing the First Waypoint: When you reach the first waypoint you'll
     see a message in your HUD. Your INS system immediately switches to the
     next waypoint, which is your primary target. If it isn't (because you've
     accidentally changed the waypoints) just tap RESET WAY PT. This resets
     the waypoints to the starting default, with waypoint #2 at your primary
     target and waypoint #3 at the secondary target.
        Extra Fuel: You'll notice that one of the four items in your weapons
     bay is an extra fuel tank. This is because the mission from the CV
     America, to Tripoli, and then to Sigonella in Sicily, is a very lon trip.
        To see your fuel status, tap the SELECT WAY PT key. The bar gauge
     across the bottom shows the fuel on hand. The dark area at the right end
     of the bar is fuel consumed already. The four bands in the middle
     represent the amount of fuel needed to reach each of the four waypoints.
     Fuel calculation is based on your current altitude and speed. The final
     band to the left represents the amount of spare (reserve) fuel available.
        Your jets engines cannot draw fuel directly from the extra tank. They
     can only draw fuel from the regular, main tanks. Therefore, to use the
     extra fuel you must pump it from the extra tank into the main tank.
        To accomplish this task, first tap the SELECT ORDNANCE key until the
     extra fuel is the current weapon. You can tell this by the text in the
     lower left corner of the HUD. You can also change the right-side CRT to
     display the weapons and highlight the current one by tapping the
     ORDNANCE key.
        Now that fuel is selected, tap the FIRE ORDNANCE key to "fire" the
     fuel from the spare into the main tank. If you tap the SELECT WAY PT
     key once more, you'll see the fuel status has changed.
        Accelerate Time: If you find the journey somewhat dull, you can speed
     the passing of time by tapping the ACCEL TIME key. This doubles the rate
     at which time passes. To return to normal time, simply tap the NORM TIME
     key. Combat activity or landing automatically returns you to normal time.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Attacking the Target:

        Once you are well past the first waypoint and the coast of Libya is
     on the horizon, it's time to start thinking about the target.
        Check the Tactical Situation: Switch your left-side cockpit CRT to the
     gridded tactical map (tap the CRT MAPS key). Your target is a radar
     station, so look for a radar symbol on this map.
        Acquire the Target: Switch your HUD to AIR-GROUND mode (tap the HUD
     MODES key until it comes up), then tap the CAM AHEAD key. If your target
     doesn't appear in the right-side CRT, tap the SELECT TARGET key until it
     does. If you cycle through every targets and still don't see the primary,
     you're either too far away to see it or you're somehow flying in the
     wrong direction.
                                                                      - 16 -

        Select your Weapon: Tap the SELECT ORDNANCE key until the weapon in
     the lower left corner of the HUD reads "2 AGM-65D" and/or "2 Maverick".
        Wait for Range, Altitude and Missile Lock: You'll notice that a box
     appears in the HUD. This is the "target box"; the target seen on the
     zoom TV CRT is in the middle of this box.
        When you get within launch range for a missile this box changes to an
     oval shape. In addition, "Missile Lock" flashes on the right-side CRT.
        The oval shape means your missile can hit if you attack at maximum
     speed. If you wait longer, eventually the oval changes color. This means
     the missile can hit regardless of your speed. Of course, if you fire the
     missile at an inappropriate target, it might hit but not cause damage -
     the ability of weapons to destroy targets is summarized on page 131.
        It's important that you not launch a weapon too low. You may be caught
     in your own bomb blast, or a missile may hit the ground before its motor
     can power it up and away. A simple rule to get you started is that
     missiles and retarded bombs require at least 500' altitude, free-fall and
     laser bombs 3000'.
        Launch: When you have "Missile Lock", open the weapons bay (tap the
     BAY DOORS key), then launch the missile by tapping the FIRE ORDNANCE key.
     After launching, turn away slightly, since flying through and exploding
     target could damage your aircraft.
        Shortly thereafter the missile should hit the target. A successful hit
     causes a fire and sends a cloud of smoke up into the sky.
        The Secondary Target: You can now fly to the secondary target and
     attack it as well, using the same procedure. Or, if you wish, you can
     call it quitz and immediately start for home.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Return Trip:

        Setting the INS to the Landing Point: Tap the RESET WAY PT key and
     then the SELECT WAY PT key. The reset way point insures that the default
     waypoints are now loaded in your INS (inertial navigation system).
        Now examine the list of waypoints on the right-side cockpit CRT. There
     are four waypoints listed. If the bottom (forth) point is not
     highlighted, tap the NEXT POINT key until it is highlighted. This
     switches the INS and waypoints system to that point. The last point on
     the default list is always your return base.
        Flying Home:  You can either use the autopilot or manually fly the
     plane home. As before, guide yourself using the heading scale (horizontal
     scale at the top of the HUD). When the INS Direction Indicator triangle
     is lined up on the center of this scale, you're on course toward your
     home base.
        If you look at the map, you'll notice there's a small island (Malta)
     just south of Sicily. You should steer just east (to the right) of Malta.
     As you near Malta, change your HUD to NAV mode (tap the HUD MODES key),
     then tap the CAM AHEAD key. If the Sigonella airbase comes up on the
     right-side CRT, fine, this is your destination! However, it's likely that
     Halfar airfield on Malta will appear instead (since it's closer).
     Therefore, tap SELECT TARGET until Sigonella appears.
        The Satellite/Radar map on the left side CRT may help you see this
     better. Tap the CRT MAPS key if the tactical display (the gridded map)
     is still on the left-
                                                                      - 17 -

     side CRT. You can enlarge and reduce either map by tapping the ZOOM and
     UNZOOM keys.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Landing at Sigonella Airbase:

     About 50 km from Sigonella start lining up your approach for landing.
        Level Flight: First achieve level flight at 500' to 100' altitude.
        ILS: Next, turn on the ILS (instrument landing system) by tapping the
     ILS key. A horizontal and vertical bar appear on your HUD. These ILS
     symbols represent your position in relationship to the "glide slope". The
     glide slope is an invisible "beam" that angles out and up from the end of
     the runway. First you'll line up beneath this glide slope, and then
     follow it into the airbase, eventually intercepting the descending slope
     line and following it down to the end of the airstrip. For more
     information on ILS systems, see "Using the ILS" on page 42 and
     especially page 52.
        Line Up Your Approach: If the vertical bar is left or right of your
     HUD nose indicator, turn about 90o in that direction and fly until the
     bar start moving toward the center. Then turn toward Sigonella. You want
     to get back onto a course od 000o just as the bar centers on the HUD.
     However, don't worry if the bar is a off center. As long as Sigonella is
     dead ahead the vertical bar will gradually creep toward the center.
     However, if the bar is moving away from the center, it's a sign you're
     travelling away from the glide slope - in that case turn the other way
     to correct the problem.
        Reduce Speed: Now cut your throttle back to about 50% power (tap the
     DECR key a few times). Your speed will graduallu decrease. To maintain
     level flight you'll have to pitch up your nose a bit (watch the altimeter
     on the right side of the HUD).
        Extend Flaps: When your speed reaches about 300 kts, tap the FLAPS
     key. This extends the flaps (notice that "FLAPS" appears on the HUD).
     This slows you further and gives you more lift. You'll have to readjust
     the nose a little to maintain level flight.
        Lower Gear & Reduce Speed Again:  Tap the GEAR key to lower your
     landing gear. You can visually check that the gear is down by tapping
     the SIDE VIEW key. Return to the cockpit view by tapping the COCKPIT key.
     You can also check this by the color of the "GEAR" light on the left
     side of the cockpit (see the Technical Supplement for the color key).
        Now cut the throttle back to about 40% power. As your speed gradually
     decreases you'll have to raise the nose to maintain level flight. By
     this time you should be close to the glide slope, and travelling about
     200 to 250 kts with your speed still decreasing.
        If you're moving too fast, tap the BRAKES key (to open your air
     brakes), then a few seconds later tap it again to close the airbrakes.
     Do not leave the airbrake open, it may cause you to stall and crash
     later.
        Intercept the Glide Slope: As you get near the airfield, the
     horizontal ILS bar begins to move downward on the HUD. When the bar
     approaches the HUD nose indicator center (the middle of the HUD), pitch
     your nose down a little.
                                                                      - 18 -

     Your objective is to go into a gradual descent that keeps the bar
     centered in the middle of your HUD (crossing the center of the HUD nose
     indicator). To avoid gaining speed in the descent, reduce your power
     (DECR key) a tap or two.
        As the airstrip comes up, first check youe speed. You should be
     travelling 150-200 kts, or decreasing from 250 kts towards 200 kts.
        If your speed is above 250 kts, you're coming in too "hot" (too fast).
     Go to maximum throttle (tap MAX PWR), retract your landing gear and
     flaps, and try again: fly to Malta, turn around there, and start over.
        If your speed is too low, look at the stall bar (the colored bar
     rising from the bottom of the airspeed gauge). If the stall bar is close
     to the middle of the scale, you're getting into trouble. Tap the INCR
     power key once or twice.
        Touch Down: If your speed is correct (150-200 kts), start watching
     the altimeter. It should be at 300' to 100' and decreasing. Make small
     adjustments with the control stick to keep the descent rate steadily, but
     not too fast. The runway is at 0' altitude. When you hear the squel of
     your wheels on the pavement, tap the BRAKES key instantly, then shut off
     the engines by tapping the NO PWR key. You've just made a safe landing.

                              The Second Mission:
     ========================================================================
        On your second practise mission it's time to learn about enemy radars,
     aircraft and missiles. Select exactly the same options as the first
     mission - you'll fly the same strike against a Tripoli radar station, but
     now you must worry about the enemy too.
        Mission Planning: Before takeoff, check out the intelligence briefing
     in more detail. Highlight the RADAR SITES option and select it. An
     overlay of concentric circles appears on the map. Each solid circle is a
     doppler radar, each dotted circle a pulse radar. Moving the CONTROLLER
     left and right cycles through each radar station, giving you additional
     data.
        This screen helps you plan a route to Tripoli and back. Remember, the
     waypoints in your airplane are the default route shown on the map. You
     may wish to fly a different route, to evade enemy detection as much as
     possible.
        Basically, you avoid detection by doppler radars if you arc around
     them, keeping a constant range to the radar. You avoid detection by
     pulse radars if you fly directly toward or away from them. For more
     information about this see "Radar & Stealth, Stealth Tactics" starting
     on page 76.
        When you're done, you should hav a mental "map" in your head of
     where enemy radars are, how you'll fly through them to avoid detection,
     and what weapons you'll use where to achieve your objectives.
        Adjusting Waypoints: After you select BEGIN MISSION, but before you
     takeoff, you may wish to adjust the waypoints to fit your new mission
     plan. The first waypoint, by default, is half way between your takeoff
     point and the primary target. Most pilots adjust this point.
        To make adjustments, first tap the CRT MODES key until the colored
     satellite map appears on the left-side cockpit CRT. Then tap the CHANGE
     WAY PT key to
                                                                      - 19 -

     display the waypoints list on the right-side CRT (and, incidentally, the
     waypoints course plan on the left-side CRT). Use the ADJUST WAYPOINTS
     keys to move the waypoint around the map. Notice that the course lines
     automatically "snap" to the new waypoint as you move it. If you don't
     like your adjustments, just tap RESET WAY PT. This resets all the
     waypoints to the initial default.

        Default waypoint settings always are:
        Waypoint #1: halfway between takeoff point and primary objective.
        Waypoint #2: the primary objective.
        Waypoint #3: the secondary objective.
        Waypoint #4: the landing point.

        Flying to the Target: After takeoff, as you fly to the target, watch
     the radar patterns on the satellite/radar map (on the left-side CRT).
     Enemy radar signals are displayed graphically. Dotted arcs are pulse
     radars, solid arcs are doppler radars. Ground search radars are entire
     360o circles, while ground fire-control tracking radars are short arcs.
     Aircraft radars, search or fire-control, are short arcs (except for
     AWACS aircraft that have entire 360o circle).
        Missiles and aircraft also appear on this map as color-coded dots.
     See the Technical Supplement for details.
        You'll notice that enemy aircraft with their forward-facing radars
     may complicate your original plan for penetrating enemy air defenses.
     You'll have to sneak behind or underneath the enemy.
        Flying Stealthy: Now that you understand the situation, it's time to
     watch the EMV (electro-magnetic visibility) scale.
        The "visibility" of your plane to enemy radar appears as a bar rising
     from the bottom of this gauge. Your visibility increases as you climb to
     higher altitudes, increase speed, open bay doors, lower gear, or use
     jammers.
        The bars coming down from the top of the scale are incoming enemy
     radar signals. Ground-based radars appear on the left, aircraft radars on
     the right. The bar color represents whether the radar sees you or not
     (see the Technical Supplement for a color key). Bar colors match the
     radar arc colors that appear on the Satgellite/Radar map (on the
     left-side CRT).
        You want to fly low (about 200') to keep your EMV small. You want to
     fly toward or away from pulse radars (especially the strongest!), and fly
     at a constant distance (arcing around) doppler radars. This keeps the
     enemy signal weak (i.e, reduces the size of their "bars" coming down the
     gauge).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Warnings:

        Eventually, though, you may make a mistake, or a previously silent
     enemy radar may suddenly turn on. Even if enemy radars don's see you, a
     successful attack always alerts them.
        Search Warning: Enemy search radar detects your plane when the enemy
     radar strength bar overlaps your EMV bar.
        Search detection means that enemy fighters are vectored toward your
     location, and that any surface-to-missile (SAM) batteries in the area
     start
                                                                      - 20 -

     tracking you as a target.
        Tracking Warning: Long-range and medium-range SAMs must track a target
     with radar before firing. Tracking radar appears as a short, norrow arc
     on the Satellite/Radar map.
        When the enemy tracks you, the "TRAK" warning is lighted in the
     cockpit.
        Some short range enemy missiles do not use a radar tracking system.
     Therefore, "TRAK" is not a foolproof warning of impending attack.
        Missile Warning Light: If a radar-homing missile is launched toward
     you, the "R" missile warning light flashes in the cockpit. If an IR
     (infrared) homing missile is launched toward you, the "I" missile
     warning light flashes.
        The appropriate light continues to flash as long as the missile is
     homing on your plane. If jammers or some other device confuse the
     missile, the light goes off. If the missile later finds you again and
     starts homing once more, the light begins flashing again.
        If two or more missiles of the same type are homing on you, that
     light continues to flash as long as any missile is homing.
        Missile warning lights are very important, since they're the only way
     to tell what kind of missile is attacking. The type of attacking missile
     (radar or infrared) determines what sort of defenses you should use.
        Missile Proximity Klaxon: When a missile approaches within a few
     seconds flight time of your plane, the proximity klaxon goes off. This
     very loud signal means you must do something, immediately, or you'll be
     hit. Typically you'll drop a chaff or flare cartridge, depending on the
     type of threat (chaff for radar missiles, flares for IR missiles).
     However, you can also attempt some last-second maneuvering.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Missile Defenses:

        When the TRAK or missile warning lights go off, it's time to warm up
     your missile defense, since an attack is incoming.
        Understand the Attack: The first step is to check out the attack.
     Switch the left-side cockpit CRT to the tactical display (tap the CRT
     MAPS key). Use the ZOOM and UNZOOM keys until the you find a useful
     scale. Missiles are small color-coded lines (see the Technical
     Supplement for a color key).
        Disppearing: If you're attacked by radar-guided missiles (either the
     "TRAK" light is on, or the "R" missile warning is lighted), you can
     evade the attack by reducing your EMV or lowering the enemy radar's
     effectiveness (or both). If the enemy radar loses sight of you, the
     missile loses guidance and flies on blindly.
        Decoys: Your F-19 carries only three decoys. To launch a decoy, tap
     the DECOY key. The "DCY" light in the cockpit turns on, and remains
     lighted while the decoy is running.
        Each decoy is a computer-controlled "imitation" of your aircraft that
     is easier for the enemy to detect and lock onto. Enemy missiles, aircraft
     and radars will follow the decoy, thinking it's you. Meanwhile you can
     pour on the speed and escape. Eventually the enemy will discover the
     ploy and start
                                                                      - 21 -

     looking for you again. The amount of time varies with the skill of the
     enemy. The"DCY" light in the cockpit remains lighted while the decoy is
     functional.
        Jammers: Use the ECM jammer against radar-guided missiles (missiles
     that light the "R" warning). Tap the ECM key to toggle the ECM jammer on
     and off.
        Use the IR jammer against IR guided missiles (those which lightthe
     "I" warning). Tap the IR JAMMER key to toggle the IR jammer on and off.
        After you turn on the jammer, change to a different course and get
     away from the missile. If you don't, when you turn off the jammer (or
     when an advanced missile gets close close enough to "burn through" your
     jammer), the missile starts homing on you again! Advanced missiles that
     "burn through" jamming include semi-active radar missiles, command
     guidance radar missiles, and second generation IR missiles.
        Don't leaveyour jammers running. The ECM jammer increases your EMV,
     while the IR jammer reduces your speed. In addition, the IR jammer can
     overheat, causing it to automatically shut down until it cools off.
        Chaff and Flares: A chaff or flare cartridge decoys a missile for two
     or more seconds. During that time the missile flies toward the chaff (if
     a radar homing missile) or the flare (if an IR homing missile).
        Fire a chaff cartridge (tap the CHAFF key) when a radar-guided
     missile sets your missile warning klaxon and "R" warning light.
        Fire a flare cartridge (tap the FLARE key) when an infrared or
     visually guided missile sets causes off your missile warning klaxon and
     "I" warning light.
        Maneuvering: Missiles only have a 45o forward "view". If you're
     outside of this arc, the missile cannot track you. Therefore, if you
     "blind" the missile with a decoy, jammer, chaff, or flare, then fly
     outside its arc, the missile may lose you and fly away. Some missiles,
     unfortunately, can circle around for another pass.
        Missiles also have very wide turning circles. You can "turn inside" a
     missile, causing it zoom past you. See "outmaneuvering a Missile" on
     pages 87-88 for more details.

     Advanced Combat: Weapons & Techniques:

        You'll want to try various waepons against land and air targets on
     this mission.
        To learn the more about weapons, read the "Weaponry" section on pages
     43-45. Then turn to "How to Fight" on pages 56-63 for more details and
     specific instructions. Additional background and sophisticated tactics
     are explained in "Air-to-Ground Tactics" (pages 78-88) and "Air-to-Air
     Tactics" (pages 89-97).
        The Data Charts, on pages 129-134, provide a useful summary of
     various weapons, including which is most effective against which type of
     target.
                                                                      - 22 -

                           2: OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Preflight Briefing

        F-19 Stealth Fighter has many options. To make a choice, move the
     CONTROLLER up and down to highlight the option, then press the SELECTOR.
     See the Technical Supplement for the location of the CONTROLLER and the
     SELECTION on your computer.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hardware Options

     You may be asked questions about your equipment. See the Technical
     Supplement for details, including advantageous trade-offs.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Aircraft Identification

        To choose your own mission assignment, you must correctly identify an
     aircraft. Flip to the back of this manual (see "Warplanes", pages
     157-169) and find the drawing which matches the screen illustartions.
     Observe carefully the shape of the wings, fuselage, nose and cockpit for
     accurate identification. Then select the correct name.
        If your identification is wrong, you're automatically assigned to
     training. If the identification is correct, you have your choice of
     assignments.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Duty Roster

        On the "Duty Roster" you can start a new career or continue an
     existing one. Instructions appear on the screen. Note that if you erase
     a pilot's name here, the results are permanent.
        You cannot save pilot records unless you follow the installation
     instruction. See the Technical Supplement. Here you see your current

                                                                      - 25 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mission Assignment

     mission assignment. You can either accept these, or request a change. If
     you accept the assignment you go directly to the intelligence briefing
     for the current mission.
        If you request a change, you'll see a variety of options, starting
     with which region of the world you prefer. Requests for a changed
     assignment are not held against you (scoring and promotion are not
     affected).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Region of the World

        Here you select one of four regions for your new assignment.
        LIBYA is a modernately challenging client state of the Sovie Union.
     In the recent past the Libyan government has been one of the main
     supporters international terrorism, and on the receiving end of Amercan
     air and naval air attacks
        Training missions in Libya are fixed. Strike training is always a
     mission from the USS America to Triopoli; Air-Air training is always an
     interception of fighters patrolling over Benghazi.
        PERSIAN GULF: This region is a slightly more complex and challenging
     situation. Iran is a radical, revolutionary state involved in a long war
     with Iraq, as well as numerous shooting incidents with the US Navy.
        NORTH CAPE & CENTRAL EUROPE: These regions are the most challenging.
     Here the full strength and power of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact
     are opposed by numerically inferior but qualitatively superior NATO
     forces (including your F-19). Should superpower skirmishing or a
     full-blown World War III occur, victory and defeat would hinge on events
     in these two regions.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Level of Conflict

        The level of conflict in the region has a dramatic effect on how you
     must fly your missions. Each type of conflict has its own challanges. No
     choice is easier than another. In general, the hotter the war situation,
     the more violent and frenetic the situation, while cold war demands
     careful planning and good judgement - different skills, but no less
     important ones!
        COLD WAR means clandestine missions. Flying without being detected is
     paramount. If you are detected, you must destroy the plane or radar
     which saw you. However, the more you use weapons, especially against any
     other targets, the greater the scandal, and the less successful your
     mission. In fact, many missions in the cold war involve photo
     reconnaissance, flying secret materials in or out, or surgicially
     "removing" a single, specific target.
        In the COLD WAR stealthy flying is crucial. Foryunately, enemy radars
     and SAMs aren't expecting trouble. They often confirm a contact many
     times before attacking.
        LIMITED WAR missions are also clandestine. It is still important to
     fly without being seen, but since warfare is ongoing, military targets
     are fair game now. However, be careful to avoid hitting civiliance and
     clandestine spy missions. In limited war enemy radar operators expect
     some trouble. Their reactions are slightly faster.
                                                                      - 26 -
     CONVENTIONAL WAR is all-out conflict. Inflicting the maximum destruction
     upon the enemy is the main objective here. Avoiding detection has no
     political importance, but is useful if you want to survive the mission!
     Any target in enemy territory is fair game, military or civilian.
     However, enemy air defense operators rarely confirm their targets - in
     wartime everybody shoots first and asks questions afterward!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Type of Mission

        You may select from two types of "real" missions and two types of
     "training" missions. Training missions represent flying a flight
     simulator instead of flying a real aircraft.
        AIR-TO-AIR MISSIONS have an enemy aircraft as your primary objective.
     If you're a hotshot with AAMs (air-to-air missile) and dogfighting, this
     is your cup of tea. However, the secondary objective is often a ground
     target.
        STRIKE MISSIONS have a ground target as the primary objective, and
     usually as your secondary objective too.
        TRAINING MISSIONS generate normal air-to-air or strike missions, as
     appropriate, with three exceptions:
        (1) NO DAMAGE: You cannot be hurt be enemy enemy fire. Hits inflict
     no damage on your aircraft.
        (2) NO SCORE: You are not scored for the mission. You receive no
     rating points, no decorations, no promotions. After all, the mission
     wasn't real! On the other hand, a poor showing doesn't bring down your
     average (as it might after a real mission).
        (3) LIBYA: If you selected Libya, your specific mission orders are
     always against a ground target in Tripoli, Air-to-Air missions are
     always against fighters over Benghazi. If you're just learning to fly
     and fight the F-19, this feature allows you to try the same mission over
     and over, until you understand fully what's happening.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Opponent Quality

        The quality of your opponents controls the difficulty of the simulation.
     The better your opponents, the more difficult your job, but the greater
     your rewards.
     Your score is significantly affected by this option.
        Selecting regular or green opponents reduces your score, making
     promotions slower and putting the highest medals out of your reach.
     Selecting elite opponents increases your score, speeding up promotions
     and making medals easier.
        Green Opponents: Here the enemy has older aircraft and SAMs. His
     radar sets are poorly maintained and frequently out of order. Radar
     operators only understand the rudiments, and therefore are very bad at
     understanding the sometimes strange signals given off by your plane
     (allowing you to fly closer to them without being spotted). Enemy pilots
     have virtually no skill in aerobatics and dogfighting (just flying the
     plane is a big challange for them).
        Regular Opponents: Here the enemy has missile and SAMs appropriate to
     the region: older equipment for third world and client states, more
     modern equipment when you face a uperpower directly. Radar operators are
     trained
                                                                      - 27 -
     and drilled, but lack combat experience. Enemy pilots have practiced
     mock dogfights and aerobatics, but lack the quick perception and
     aggressive maneuvering of combat veteran.
        Veteran Opponents: Here the enemy has aircraft and SAMs appropriate
     to the region, like regulars, but tend to use only the better equipment
     in combat (veterans realize the futility of using absolescent weapons
     against a first class enemy like you!). Radar operators are experienced,
     with a good sense of judgement that makes your job harder. Enemy pilots
     are skilled dogfighters, often with a few kills to their credit. Except
     fast, aggressivemoves from them.
        Elite Opponents: Here you face the enemy's best. Elite troops always
     get the best available equipment. Radar operators know their equipment
     inside out, and can interpret your faint, confusing returns only too
     well. Enemy pilots are often aces who know every trick in the book, and
     aren't above inventing new tricks where they can. Dogfighting against
     these guys is the ultimate challange.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flight Performance

        No Crashes: This is the ideal choice when learning to fly. Your F-19
     literally cannot crash. In a crash situation it just rights itself and
     keeps on going. If you hit a mountainside you're bounced upwards and
     keep on going. When landing you can hit the ground as hard as you like
     and still survive. Unless you're landing (i.e., with landing gear down),
     an automatic barometic altimeter keeps your plane above 200',
     simplifying low-level flying.
        However, enemy weapons are not affected by this choice. If your plane
     is shot out of the sky by guns or missiles, it will crash and kill you
     (unless you successfully eject first).
        Your score is significantly reduced if you select this option, making
     promotions and medals hard to get.
        Easy Landings: This is the pregferred choice of casual, weekend
     flyers. Safe landing parameters are relaxed considerably, which makes
     one of the toughest jobs (landing a really hot jet) much easier. To
     avoid a crash you must touch down a runway, aircraft carrier, or
     prepared landing strip. Hittingthe ground or water anywhere else
     destroys the plane. As in "No Crashes", an automatic barometic altimeter
     keeps your plane above 200' unless you're landing (i.e., with landing
     gear down).
        Exact landing parameters are shown on the screen. You may wish to
     copy these down for future reference.
        Your score is only slightly reduced if you select this option.
     Promotions are not materially affected, and you can quality for all but
     the highest medals.
        Realistic Landings: This is the real experience, in full. You must be
     skilled and "in practice" to be consistenly successful with realistic
     landings. Coming down too fast (either vertically or horizontally) can
     mean instant death.
        Exact landing parameters are shown on the screen. You may wish to
     copy these down for future reference.
                                                                      - 28 -
        Your score is full value if you select this option. If all other
     selections are of similar difficulty, you gain higher rank and medals
     quickly.

        On this screen move the CONTROLLER up and down to highlight one of
     the options below. Then press the SELECTOR to toggle that option's data
     on and off the map. When an option's data on and off the map. When an
     option's data is visible, moving the CONTROLLER left or right cycles
     through specific data on each item.
        This screen, with its great variety of information, is the perfect
     place to plan your mission. You may wish to yake notes about especially
     dangerous enemies, or the route you have in mind.
        Your takeoff point (T), primary target (P), secondary target (S), and
     landing point (L) are always visible on the briefing map, as reference
     points.
        Mission Targets: This presents a detailed description of your
     operational orders, with specific information about the primary and
     secondary objectives. You should also look at your flight plan (below)
     for additional information.
        Radar Sites: The SELECTOR toggles radar sites on and off the map.
     You can use the Controller to cycle through data on each site in turn.
        Missile Ranges: The SELECTOR toggles missile sites on and off the
     map. You can use the Controller to cycle through data on each site in
     turn.
        Air Bases: The SELECTOR toggles airbase sites on and off the map.
     You can use the Controller to cycle through data on each site in turn.
        Flight Plan: This presents a detailed desccription of your takeoff
     and landing sites, estimated fuel required, and your ROE (Rules of
     Engagement).
        Special Events: This shows any special enemy activity. Areas marked
     as especially active are likely to have lots of small shoulder-launched
     SAMs, and therefore be quite dangerous.
        Exit Briefing Room: This ends the intelligence briefing. You can
     return later if you desire.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        here you can select whatever weaponry and equipment you desire for
     each of your four weapons bay.
        To select a weapon, use the CONTROLLER to move the highlight among
     the weapons, then use the SELECTOR to choose the highlighted weapon.
     Then you must use the CONTROLLER once move to move the highlight among
     the bays (to select which bay will carry the weapon) and press the
     SELECTOR a second time to put the weapon in that bay (removing the
     weapon originally present).
        Note that your estimated fuel required, and current fuel carried,
     appear along the bottom of the aircraft diagram. Make sure you have
     enough fuel to complete the mission!
        Default Armaments: The initial weapons loaded in Bays #1 and #2
     represent your crew chief's choice of ordnance for your mission. The
     weapon in Bay #1 (the upper left graphic) is for the primary target,
     the weapon in Bay #2 (the upper right graphic) is for the secondary
     target. Extra fuel in Bays #3 or #4 represents the crew chief's guess
     that you'll need it, given the distance involved.
                                                                      - 29 -
        Choosing Armamanets: See the "Data Charts" on pages 129-134, for
     details about each weapon. The "Weapon Effectiveness against Common
     Targets" chart, page 131, rates all weapons against all common targets.
     It's wise to carry at least one "A" or "B" rated weapon for the primary
     and secondary objectives.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Final Choices:

        Your final option before leaving the preflight briefing area has the
     following four choices:
        Select New Mission: You can refuse the current mission and ask for a
     new one. There is no penalty involvrd in this, but it's considered a
     cowardly and unpatriotic act that earns the disdain of real fighter
     pilots everywhere.
        Intelligence Briefing: This returns you to the intelligence briefing
     screen, where you can further examine the current situation and orders.
        Arm Your Plane: This returns you to the arming options, where you can
     reconfigure your aircraft as you prefer.
        Begin Mission: When you select this option, you're ready to fly. In
     seconds you'll be in the cockpit, ready to take off.
                                                                      - 30 -
                              Simulation Controls:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        As an aid to learning flight maneuvers, a variety of out-of-plane
     viewpoints are available. In all these views you are outside of your
     aircraft, looking at it and/or the enemy. Many different perspectives
     are available.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Return to the Cockpit

        Press the COCKPIT key to return to the normal in-the-cockpit
     viewpoint.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Slot View

        Press the SLOT VIEW key for this view. It is named after the famous
     "in the slot" position used by aerial acrobatic teams.
        Here you are positioned directly behind the F-19. Unlike the chase
     plane, the viewpoint remains level with the ground, so you can clearly
     see the degree of pitch and roll in the F-19 itself.
        The ZOOM and UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your viewpoint
     closer to (ZOOM) and farther from (UNZOOM) the F-19.
        This view is an excellent one for learning the most efficient and
     effective flight maneuvers.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Chase Plane View

        Press the CHASE PLANE key for this view.
        Here you are positioned in a "chase aircraft" that follows a short
     distance behind the F-19. As the F-19 accelerates, it will tend to "run
     away" from the chase plane, while when the F-19 slows down it tends to
     "fall back" toward the chase plane.
        Although this view is very dramatic, its use as a teaching and
     learning aid is limited.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Side View

        Press the SIDE VIEW key for this view.
        Here you are positioned to the right side of the F-19. The ZOOM and
     UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your viewpoint closer (ZOOM)
     or farther from (UNZOOM) the F-19.
        this view can provide a useful reference point. It's also an
     excellent way to check the state of your landing gear. Missile launches
     are most dramatic when seen from this viewpoint.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Tactical View

        Press the TACTI VIEW key for this view.
        Here you are positioned right behind the F-19, looking past it at
     whatever target is being tracked on the plane's HUD. This view
     automatically rotates and pans to keep both the F-19 and its target in
     view.
        The ZOOM and UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your viewpoint
     closer to (ZOOM) or farther from (UNZOOM) the F-19.
        This view is invaluable when dogfighting. It helps you outmaneuver
     and
                                                                      - 31 -
     line up on an opponent (although it's wise to return to the cockpit
     before shooting, to avoid wasting ammo). The view is also useful if you
     want to return for a second or third attack run on a ground target.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Inverse Tactical View

        Press the INVRS TACTI key for this view.
        Here you are positioned right behind the F-19's target, looking past
     it at the F-19 itself. The target may be another plane, or a ground
     target - whatever your tracking camera is following (see pages 43-44).
     In either case, you see the target in the foreground, and the F-19 far
     away. In fact, often your F-19 is nothing but a dot in the sky. This
     view automatically rotates and pans to keep both the target and the
     F-19 in view.
        The ZOOM and  UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your
     viewpoint closer to (ZOOM) or farther from (UNZOOM) the F-19's target.
        Experienced pilots find this a very dramatic view when making attack
     runs on ground targets. It's a great showoff view, swinging to follow
     your plane as you fly overhead.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Missile View

        Press the MISSILE VIEW key for this view.
        Here you are positioned directly behind the F-19's active weapon. If
     ordnance is in flight, you are positioned behind the weapon launched
     most recently. If no ordnance is in flight, you are positioned behind
     the plane, and will follow the first item launched.
        The ZOOM and UNZOOM keys function in this view, moving your viewpoint
     closer to (ZOOM) or farther from (UNZOOM) the missile.
        This view is very entertaining, as it lets you follow the weapon
     directly to the target. If you're having trouble understanding why your
     weapons miss, switching to this view after launch can be extremely
     educational.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Standard & Wide-Angle

        The VIEW ANGLE key toggles a 60o standard view arc and a 120o
     wide-angle viewing arc. This inclusion/exclusion of peripheral vision
     applies to all the views above.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Movie Director

        An experienced pilot, flying in training mode, can use these views to
     good effect. By switching between the cockpit and various views, you can
     illustrate what's happening and impress casual bystanders.
        For example you can use the CHASE PLANE view to watch your plane
     launching from the carrier and turning onto course (use the autopilot
     after launch to simplify this). Then switch to SLOT VIEW and show off
     loops, rolls, split-S turns and Immelmans (see pages  94-95 for details
     on these maneuvers). Find an enemy aircraft and use the TACTI VIEW to
     show your plane maneuvering against his. Then switch to INVRS TACTI to
     watch his responses. Before launching a missile go to the SIDE VIEW, to
     watch the weapon dropping away. Then jump to the MISSILE VIEW to follow
     it into the target. The possibilities are as endless as your
     imagination.
                                                                      - 32 -
     ========================================================================
                                 Other Controls
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Pause

        The PAUSE key immediately and instantly freezes the simulation. To
     resume action, press any key. Some computers have a special "pause" or
     "hold" key. Depending on the internal design of your machine, this key
     may also work.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Accelerated Time

        The ACCEL TIME key doubles the rate at which time passes. "ACCEL"
     appears on the HUD. Accelerated time is useful when flying long
     distances without encountering any significant threats or opposition.
        The NORM TIME key returns the simulation ti its normal time rate,
     regardless of what the accelerated rate was. You should return to normal
     time before combat: it's very hard to control and fight your craft in
     accelerated time.
        In combat and landing situations you're automatically returned to
     normal time. Accelerate time automatically stops if either (a) you're
     detected by enemy radar, (b) open a weapons bay, or (c) lower the
     landing gear.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Detail Adjust

        The DETAIL ADJUST key allows you to change the amount and depth of
     ground detail visible through the cockpit. See the Technical Supplement
     for, details. In general, the slower your computer, the lower the level
     of detail you should use.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Volume Adjust

        The VOLUME ADJUST key allows you to change the type and variety of
     sounds used in the simualtion. See the Technical Supplement for details.
     When you press the key, the new sound settings appears briefly on the
     HUD.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Resupply

        The RESUPPLY key is available ONLY in training missions. Pressing
     this key fills the plane's fuel tanks and gives it extra weapons.
     Resupply is designed for sight-seeing and target practice. Needless to
     say, those who prefer realism in simulations (including in training)
     should never touch this option.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     "Boss" Hide Game

        The "BOSS" HIDE GAME key immediately pauses the simulation and clears
     the screen, effectively concealing what software is really running on
     the computer. To resume, you must press the "BOSS" HIDE GAME key again.
        This key is not only useful at the office, but also to forestall
     irate parents, children, spouses, and relatives who complain time you
     spend at the computer.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Save

        There is no "SAVE" key in F-19 Stealth Fighter. Instead the
     simulation automatically saves your record as a pilot whenever you
     leave the pilot roster during the preflight briefing.
        This "automatic save" feature requires you to be using a copy of the
     program (a copy on either a floppy or hard disk), rather than the
     original MicroProse disk from the box. If you are using the original
     disk, you cannot save data, although you can otherwise run the
     simulation normally.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Quit

        The QUIT key immediately ends the simulation. It does not save any
     information to disk, so any accomplishments since the last time you saw
     the pilot roster will be lost.
                                                                      - 33 -
                               Aircraft Controls
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     terminology

        KEYS: Each control has a name in UPPER CASE letters, which is used
     on the keyboard overlay. A master list of all names and keys also
     appears in the Technical Supplement (in case your overlay is damaged or
     lost).
        CONTROLLER refers to the pointing device used by your computer. This
     may be a mouse, joystick, or cursor keys, depending on your hardware.
     See the Technical Supplement for details.
        SELECTOR refers to the mouse button, joystick trigger, return key, or
     enter key depending on your hardware setup.
        During flight, the function of joystick and mouse buttons are defined
     in the Technical Supplement. For example, on a typical two-button
     joystick, the first button acts as the FIRE CANNON key, the second as
     the FIRE ORDNANCE key.

     ========================================================================
     Head-Up Display (HUD)

     The HUD is designed to provide you, the pilot, with all the crucial
     flying and weapon information in a graphic format. HUD data is projected
     onto a wide angle clear pane in the front of the cockpit. You look
     "through" the HUD display to the situation outside. As a result,
     valuable information is right in front of your eyes, where it is most
     useful.
        See the Technical Supplement for a detailed depiction of the HUD and
     cockpit display.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     HUD Modes

        The HUD display has three modes:  NAV, AIR-AIR, and AIR-GROUND. You
     switch between modes using the HUD MODES key.
        The current HUD mode appears on the bottom center of the HUD display.
        The NAV mode is designed for flying and navigation between airbases.
     In this mode your tracking system is restriced to friendly and neutral
     airbases and aircraft carriers.
        The AIR-GROUND mode is designed for attacking ground targets. Your
     tracking system is restricted to these targets. Although your tracking
     system contains only a limited subset of the possible targets, you can
     temporarily add more using the DISIGNATE NEW TARG key.
        The AIR-AIR mode is designed for attacking aircraft. Your tracking
     system is restricted to these targets only.
        Some HUD information is iuniversal across all modes. Other
     information is specific, available in just one of the modes.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Universal HUD Informtion

        Airspeed appears on the left-side vertical scale, in knots. Beside
     the tickmark showing your current speed is a digital readout of your
     speed.
        Stall Speed Indicator: At times a colored bar rises from the bottom
     of the scale. This bar represents your stall speed. If the bar rises
     above the center tickmark on the scale, your plane has stalled. A
     stalled plane falls out of control for a period of time before the
     automated recovery system takes over. A stall at low altitude is often
     fatal.
                                                                      - 34 -
        Altitude appears on the right-side scrolling vertical scale, in feet
     above average ground level. At 1000' and higher the scale changes to
     thousands  ("2K" means 2000' altitude, "13K" means 12000' altitude,
     etc.). A digital readout of your current altitude appears next to the
     scale's tick-mark.
        VVI Indicator: At times a colored bar extends upward or downward from
     the center tickmark on the altitude scale. This is the VVI (Vertical
     Velocity Indicator).
        If the VVI bar extends downward, your plane is losing altitude. Each
     tickmark represents 100 feet per minute. Therefore, the larger the bar,
     the faster you're going down.
        If the VVI bar extends upward, your plane is gaining altitude. Each
     tickmark represents 100'/min. Therefore, the longer the bar, the faster
     you're going up.
        Landing Speed Indicator: This colored arrow appears only when your
     landing gear is down. It indicates the safe maximum VVI for landing. If
     the VVI bar is below this mark, attempting to land risks a crash.
        Heading: horizontal scale across the top is your heading in degrees.
     North is 000o, East is 090o, South is 180o, and West is 270o.
        INS (Waypoint) Direction Indicator: The colored diamond marker on
     the top of the scale shows the heading you should fly to reach the
     currently selected INS "waypoint". To get "on course", turn until the
     diamond marker is above the middle tickmark on the scale.
        Nose Indicator: This indicator shows the direction you are flying
     (which can be different from the nose indicator!). It is available only
     in the NAV and AIR-GROUND mode. In AIR-AIR mode it is replaced by the
     gunsight.
                                                                      - 35 -
        The plane is geometrically level when the nose indicator and flight
     path indicator overlap. However, this is rare in an aircraft.
     Furthermore, LEVEL FLIGHT (where you are neither climbing or diving)
     often requires the nose to be pitched slightly above the flight path, to
     achieve a useful ANGLE OF ATTACK. See Aerodynamics and Flying
     Techniques, pages 70, for more information.
        G-Indicator: This readout in the upper left corner of the HUD
     indicates the current G-forces on your plane's airframe. In general,
     the plane can withstand more G stress than the pilot, whose limits are
     between -3 G and +9 G, depending on training and experience.
        Pitch Lines are superimposed on the HUD if your nose is pitched so
     far up or down that the horizon is invisible. each major line represents
     10o of pitch up or down. If your aircraft is geometrically level, pitch
     is 0o. If your aircraft is climbing straight up or diving straight down,
     the pitch is 90o.
        ROLL is indicated by the relationship of the horizon or pitch line to
     the cockpit and nose indicator. If the horizon or a pitch line is
     perfectly horizontal, your craft is level. If the line angles to the
     left or right, your craft is rolled to the right or left.
        Current Armament: In the lower left the HUD indicates what weapon is
     currently selected, and the number currently available, such as 3
     Sidewinder AIM-9M missiles, or 2 Slick Mk 82-0 bombs, etc.
        Below this line is the word "Gun" followed by the number of rounds
     currently available. This refers to your 20mm cannon and its remaining
     ammunition. A jam or loss of the gun, should it occur, is noted here
     also.
        Flight Equipment Indicators: If special flight equipment is
     functioning, a note appears on the lower right of the HUD. "FLAPS"
     appears when the flaps are extended. "BRAKE" appears when the airbrake
     is extended or wheelbrake is on.
        Control Stick Box: If you aren't using a physical joystick, the
     control stick locator box appears in the lower right corner of the HUD,
     to help you see the current stick position.
        Radio Messages: Coded burst transmissions arrive by radio
     periodically. These are decoded by your onboard computers and displayed
     as text across the top of the HUD, just underneath the heading scale.
        Tracking Box: Tap the CAM AHEAD key to activate (or reset) the F-19's
     computerized optical tracker. A small box appears around the nearest
     standard target ahead, to help you locate it. The HUD mode determines
     whether ground or air targets are tracked. The CAM REAR, CAM LEFT and
     CAM RIGHT keys set the optical tracker in that direction instead (see
     below). Once the tracker is locked onto a target, it follows that
     target, even if it moves from one quadrant to another. Of course, the
     box is only visible on the HUD when the target is directly in front of
     you.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air-Air Mode Indicators

        Tap the HUD MODES key to change your HUD^into air-air mode.
        Gunsight: In this mode the gunsight circle replaces the flight path
     indicator
                                                                      - 36 -
     The gunsight shows where your shells would be landing if you'd fired two
     seconds ago (the time it takes them to travel the 6 kilometer maximum
     range). If you're tracking a target that's closer than 6 km, it shows
     where the shells would land if you'd fired the proper time in the past
     for them to travel that range. See "How to Fight, the 20mm Cannon"
     (page 57) for details on using the gunsight.
        Missile Targeting Envelope: This is a large but faint circle fixed on
     the HUD. It represents the area of the sky where and air-to-air missile
     can be aimed and "locked on" to a target.
        Tracking Box & Oval: Any of the four CAM keys activates the tracking
     camera system in that direction. A small box appears around the target,
     to help you locate it. On most systems the tracking box is
     color-coordinated with the current armament (as shown on the HUD, see
     above). The box color indicates whether the current weapon is effective
     against that target. See the Technical Supplement for details on colors.
        When using missiles or other self-guided weapons, the box turns oval
     when the targets is within firing range and the missile is "locked on".
     This is a maximum range shot that assumes the target is stationary and
     your plane is moving at maximum speed (over 500 kts). When the oval
     changes color the shot is now a "sure thing", with nearly no chance of
     missing.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air-Ground Mode Indicators

        Tap the HUD MODES key to change your HUD into air-ground mode.
        Tracking Box & Oval: Any of the four CAM keys activates the tracking
     camera system in that direction. A small box appears around the target,
     to help you locate it. On most systems the tracking box is
     color-coordinated with the current armament (as shown on the HUD, see
     above). The box color indicates whether the current weapon is effective
     against that target. See the Technical Supplement for details on colors.
        When using missiles or other self-guided weapons, the box turns oval
     when the targets is within firing range and the missile is "locked on".
     The oval changes color when accuracy has reached its maximum.
        Bombsights: When free-fall and/or retarded bombs are the current
     armament, a special set of bombsight aids appears on the HUD. Note that
     the fall-line and bullseye only appear for free-fall bombs.
        Bombing Flightpath Guie: This indicates the "path in the sky" you
     should fly for a perfect bombing run. Keeping your flight path indicator
     centered within this symbol means you're "on course".
        Bombsight Ranging Bar: This indicates the distance before
                                                                      - 37 -
     proper bomb release. As you get closer to the drop point, the bar
     compresses. When it becomes a single vertical line (or dot) it's time
     to drop the bomb
        Bombsight Fall-line: This appears only if free-fall bombs are the
     current armament. A line extends from your flight path toward the
     ground. At the end of this line is a circle. Your bomb will land in
     the middle of this circle.
        Bombsight Bullseye: This is a circle at the end of the fall-line. The
     center of the circle indicates the predicated strike-point of the bomb.
        Killing Yourself: If your current course, speed and altitude will
     take you within a bomb blast, the HUD bombsight symbology flashes. You
     can still drop a bomb in this situation, but you should take appropriate
     action to escape the resulting blast.
        Camera Lens Sight:  If your current armament is the 135 mm/IR camera,
     the camera lens sight appears on the HUD. This is a small "+" symbol in
     the lower center. It represents the direction your camera lens aims.

     Cockpit CRTs
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Maps (Left-Side) CRT

        This CRT appears on the left side of the cockpit. It displays two
     differenttypes of maps. Tap the CRT MAPS key to toggle between the two
     types.
        Either map can be expanded or contracted to show more area or more
     detail, using the ZOOM and UNZOOM keys.
        THE SATELLITE/RADAR MAP portrays the geographical features of the
     region, and is oriented so North is always toward the top of the CRT.
        Enemy radar signals are displayed graphically on the map. Dotted arcs
     are pulse radars, solid line arcs are doppler radars. Ground search
     radars are entire 360o circles, while ground fire-control tracking
     radars are short arcs. Aircraft radars, search or fire-control, are
     short arcs except for AEW&C aircraft (the I1-76 "Mainstay" or E-3C
     "Sentry"), which have an entire 360o circle.
        Missiles and aircraft also appear on this map as color-coded dots.
     See the Technical Supplement for details. If a dot is your primary
     target, it flashes and glows.
        THE TACTICAL DISPLAY portrays the local tactical situation. It is
     oriented so the top of the face corresponds to your flight path. Thus
     the map rotates as you turn.
        The map graphically depicts aircraft (color-coded for altitude),
     missiles, ground radar sources, airfields, and incidental ground
     targets. A 16km square grid is superimposed for range referencing. See
     the Technical Supplement for details on the color coding of this map.
        WARNING: The airbase symbols on this map are icons only. They may
     not be correctly aligned. Do not use this map for landings!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Camera/Data (Right-Side) CRT

        This CRT appears on the right side of the cockpit. It has many
     different functions. Tap the appropriate key to activate the desired
     function: 
        CAM AHEAD: This aims the tracking camera ahead and locks it on the
     nearest standard target. A zoom TV view of the target appears on the
     CRT with
                                                                      - 38 -
     range and direction information.
        CAM REAR: This aims the tracking camera to the rear, locking it onto
     the nearest standard target, and showing the zoom TV picture on the CRT.
        CAM LEFT: This aims the tracking camera to the left, locking it onto
     the nearest standard target, and showing the zoom TV picture on the CRT.
        CAM RIGHT: This aims the tracking camera to the right, locking it
     onto the nearest standard target, and showing the zoom TV picture on
     the CRT.
        DATA: Displays data on the target currently targeted by the tracking
     camera.
        Ordnance: Displays the ordnance currently on board your F-19.
        Damage: Displays which system (if any) are damaged on your F-19.
        Waypoints: Displays waypoint data for each of the four INS waypoints,
     and displays predicted fuel consumption (given current flight
     performance).
        Way Reset: Resets the INS (inertial navigation system) waypoints to
     the initial (default) values. Wypoint #2 always becomes the primary
     target, waypoint #3 always becomes the secondary target.
        ILS:  Toggles the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on and off. When
     turned on, it projects ILS symbology on the HUD and locks the tracking
     camera to an airbase.
        Mission: Displays a summary of your mission orders.

     ========================================================================
     Flight Controls
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Control Stick

        The F-19 has a standard aircraft control stick. Pushing the stick
     forward pitches the plane down, pulling it back pitches the plane up.
     Pushing the stick left rolls the plane to the left, while pushing it
     right rolls the plane to the right.
        Note that the more you push the stick, the more the aircraft pitches
     or rolls in that direction. When you release the stick (i.e., center it)
     the aircraft remains pitched or rolled in that attitude. You must move
     the stick in the opposite direction to level your plane.
        The control stick may be represented by a physical joystick,
     numeric/cursor keypad, or some other device. See your Technical
     Supplement for details. If you are not using a "real" joystick, a
     control stick locator box appears in the lower right corner of the HUD.
     This shows you the current position of your stick.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Throttle

        The throttle controls the power output of your engines. Maximum
     throttle ("full military power") gives you maximum speed and
     performance, but also uses up fuel faster and increases your EMV
     (electro-magnetic visibility).
        Throttle Handle & Indicator: The twin handle device on the far left
     of the cockpit represents the throttle control. The closer the handles
     are to the main cockpit panel, the greater your engine power. On the
     base of the handles is a bar-like scale that shows the amount of thrust
     being generated.
        Throttle Controls: The MAX PWR key immediately opens the throttle,
     giving you maximum thrust.
                                                                      - 39 -
        The NO PWR key immediately closes the throttle, shutting down the
     engines.
        The INCREASE key opens the throttle a small amount.
        The DECREASE key closes the throttle a small amount.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Autopilot

        The AUTOPILOT key toggles the automatic pilot on and off. The
     autopilot, when active, flies you toward the next INS waypoint. If
     you're below 500' altitude, the autopilot climbs to that altitude. When
     the autopilot is on, the cockpit "AUTO" light is on.
        If you touch the control stick in any way, the autopilot
     automatically turns off. In other words, it works like the "cruise
     control" of a modern American automobile.
        WARNING: The autopilot does not avoid hills and mountains!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Brake

        If your aircraft is airborne, the BRAKE key toggles the airbrake
     retracted (in) and extended (out). When the brake is extended the
     aircraft slows down because the airbrake causes extra drag.
        If the aircraft is on the ground, the BRAKE key toggles the landing
     gear brakes on and off.
        In either case, if the brakes are on, the word "BRAKE" appears in
     the lower right corner of your HUD.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flaps

        The FLAPS key toggles the wing flaps between extended (out) and
     retracted (in). When the flaps are extended (out) the aircraft slows
     down, gains lift, and stall speed is reduced.
        If the flaps are extended, the word "FLAPS" appears in the lower
     right corner of your HUD.
        Do not have your flaps extended above 300 kts speed. Higher speeds
     can rip off the flaps, causing serious damage to your wings.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Landing Gear

        The GEAR key toggles your landing gear up and down. The "GEAR" light
     in the cockpit indicates the landing gear position (see the Technical
     Supplement for colors).
        If the "GEAR" light flashes, it means the gear is down at too high a
     speed - you should either slow down or raise the landing gear. Not only
     does extended landing gear slow you down, but high speeds can rip it
     off entirely, causing serious damage.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Viewing Controls

        Cockpit:  Tap the COCKPIT key for the standard pilot view, looking
     out of your cockpit through the HUD.
        View Angle: The VIEW ANGLE key toggles between a standard viewing arc
     (about 60o) and a wide-angle viewing arc (about 120o). The wide angle
     arc is an excellent way to spot and track objects, especially in a
     fast-moving dogfight.
        The current viewing angle (standard or wide) applies to all other
     views, and can be changed from any view.
        View Forward: Tap the VIEW AHEAD key to turn off the HUD and look up
                                                                      - 40 -
     over the cockpit control panel. This vire gives you maximum visibility
     forward, unobstructed with the cockpit or HUD.
        View Rear: Tap the VIEW REAR key to look out the back of your
     aircraft.
        View Left: Tap the VIEW LEFT key to look out the left side of your
     aircraft.
        View Right: Tap the VIEW RIGHT key to look out the right side of
     your aircraft.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     INS "Waypoints" System

        Concept: The INS (inertial navigation system) has up to four
     programmable "waypoints". you use these to map out a route to your
     target(s) and back again. The default waypoint setup puts the first
     point halfway between your starting base and the primary target. The
     second is the primary target; the third is the secondary target; and
     that last is your landing point.
        Waypoints Display: The SELECT WAY PT and CHANGE WAY PT keys display
     the INS waypoints list on the right-side CRT and your projected flight
     path from waypoint to waypoint on the satellite/radar map on the
     left-side CRT.
        The waypoints list includes the current time at top, the flight time
     to each waypoint, and across the bottom a fuel gauge. The fuel gauge is
     a bar-graph of predicted fuel consumption, given your current speed and
     altitude. The far right side of the bar shows the amount of empty space
     in the tank, the far left side shows your reserves, while the center
     parts show the amount of fuel needed to reach each waypoint. The gauge
     is color-coded, see the Technical Supplement for details.
        Selecting Waypoints: The INS waypoints list on the right-side CRT
     has one point highlighted. Your HUD's INS Waypoint Direction Indicator
     steers you toward the highlighted waypoint.
        To select a new destination, tap the SELECT WAY PT. Then use the LAST
     POINT and NEXT POINT keys (among the WAYPOINTS controls) to move the
     highlight up and down the list. As you move the highlight the HUD's INS
     Direction Indicator moves accordingly.
        Changing Waypoints: To change a waypoint to a new location, first
     tap the CHANGE WAY PT key. Then use the LAST POINT and NEXT POINT
     controls to select the waypoint you wish to move. Finally, use the
     keypad waypoint keys to actually move the point.
        To observe the results, make sure to tap CRT MAPS. This sets the
     left-side CRT to the satellite/radar map. Then use the UNZOOM key as
     necessary to show the entire course. Notice that as you move a waypoint
     the flight paths adjust accordingly.
        Tap the RESET WAY PT key to reset all waypoints to the original
     (default) waypoints described in "Concept" above.
                                                                      - 41 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Fuel

        Fuel Warning: The "FUEL" light on the cockpit control panels goes on
     whenever your fuel tanks are low.
        Extra Fuel: If you are carrying extra fuwl in your weapons bay, you
     can pump that fuel from the bay into the main tank by tapping the SELECT
     ORDNANCE key until "EXTRA FUEL" appearson the lower left of the HUD.
     Then tap the FIRE ORDNANCE key to move the fuel from the bay into your
     main tanks.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ILS (Instrument Landing)

        The ILS key toggles the ILS (instrument landing system) display on
     and off your HUD. When the ILS is on, a vertical and horizontal bar
     guide you toward the nearest friendly airbase.
        Principles of Operation: The ILS is designed to aid you "on final",
     steering you down the descending "glide path" to the runway. if you are
     flying a pattern to land, use the ILS to guide you to the airport, then
     turn it off until you are "on final".
        The ILS guides you to the runway or carrier deck, but end there.
     Rather than produce inaccurate readings over the runway, the ILS
     automatically turns off before it degrades to being useless.
        Vertical "Course" Bar: To use the ILS, fly the plane so that the
     vertical bar lines up with your HUD Nose Indicator. This means you're on
     course toward the airbase.
        Horizontal "Glide Slope" Bar: The horizontal bar of the ILS
     represents the "glide slope", an imaginary line extending from the
     airbase up into the sky. You can either fly straight ahead until you
     "intercept" it, or climb to get to the glide slope faster.
        If the bar is beneath your HUD Nose Indicator, you are above the
     glide slope. You should descend until the bar crosses directly through
     the HUD indicator.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Mission Summary & Success

        Tap the MISSION key to display a short summary of your mission on
     the right-side CRT.
        When you accomplish your primary or secondary mission, the mission
     summary is updated to show this. Therefore, if you're uncertain wheter
     you hit the target, just check this display.
                                                                      - 42 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Bailing Out

        Tap the EJECT key to "punch out" of your plane. Your F-19 has a
     zero-zero ejection seat, the safest and most flexible design available.
     Ejection is never entirely safe, but your best chance of survival exists
     if your altitude is between 2000' and 14000' while you are flying level
     or slightly climbing.
        To prevent sensitive technology from falling into hostile hands, you
     should eject far out over open sea whenever possible. If not, bail out
     in friendly territory where you can. Ejections while over enemy
     coastlines or inland territory should be avoided at all costs.

     ========================================================================
     Weaponry

        These instructions only give the bare rudiments of how to operate
     each weapon. Many important secondary considerations (like not launching
     some too low) and tactical tricks are described in "How to Fight"
     (pages 56-63) and "Techniques & Tactics" (pages 78-97).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Selecting Weapons

        See "Equipment, USAF Ordnance", page 131, for a chart that indicates
     which weapons are most effective against which targets. Further details
     about each weapon can be found on pages 140-146. The Ordnance currently
     available always appears in the lower left corner of the HUD.
        Cannon: Your 20mm cannon is always available for use (unless out of
     ammo or damaged).
        Ordnance: Tap the ORDNANCE key to display your weapons bay equipment
     on the right-side CRT. This includes both names and illustrations of all
     weaponry, cameras, fuel, etc. The ordnance currently selected is
     highlighted. The current armament also appears in the lower left of the
     HUD.
        Tap the SELECT ORDNANCE key to change the weapon "locked into" your
     fire control system. Each keypress changes you to the next item in a
     weapons bay.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Tracking Targets

        If your HUD is in AIR-AIR mode you can track aircraft targets. If
     your HUD is in AIR-GROUND mode you can trach ground targets. The F-19
     uses a zoom TV system with backup thermal imaging. Although the most
     useful and flexible system available today, it is limited to about 80
     to 100 kilometers maxumum range in day time, less at night.
        Tracking Camera: Tap on of the CAM keys to lock your target tracking
     camera onto the nearest target within 80-100 km ahead of you plane. A
     zoom TV view of the target appears in the right side CRT, including the
     target's name, range, and bearing.
        Primary and secondary objectives are listed as such. Civilian targets
     (which you shouldn't hit in Cold War or Limited War situations) are
     noted also.
        Normally you'll use the CAM AHEAD key to track a target in front of
     you. This is because all your weapons are forward firing. However, you
     can use the CAM LEFT, CAM RIGHT, and CAM REAR as well, although weapon
     launches are unlikely to hit the target.
        Tracking Box:  On your HUD the target is framed by a colored box
     (see the Technical Supplement for the meaning of various colors). If
     the box is invisible
                                                                      - 43 -
     on the HUD, but you have an image on right-side CRT, mission target is
     not directly ahead of you.
        The color of the target box indicates whether the target can be hit
     with the current ordnance selected from the bay. The size of the box
     indicates the potential effectiveness of the weapon (a small box means
     poor effectiveness, a large box means superior effectiveness).
        NOTE: If you have the weapons bay open and selected the 135 mm/IR
     recon camera as your current weapon, the right-side CRT shows the view
     through the fixed recon camera rather than the normal tracking camera.
     Close the weapon bay or select a different weapon to see the tracking
     camera view.
        Target Data: Your F-19 has an onboard computer file of data on common
     targets for that region. Tap the DATA key to get additional information
     about the current target.
        Changing Targets: The onboard computer has a pre-programmed list of
     possible targets in the region, including your primary target and
     secondary targets. Tap the SELECT TARGET key to move the tracking camera
     to the next nearest target within 80-100 kilometers.
        Designating New Targets: In addition, you can reprogram the tracking
     camera to aim at any target on the ground. Simply aim your nose at the
     target and tap the DESIGNATE NEW TARGET key. The camera will lock onto
     the nearest new target.
        Due to a limitation in your onboard computer, you can only designate
     new targets ahead of your aircraft. When you select this option the
     tracking camera automatically switches to the view ahead.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Firing Weapons

        See "How to Fight", pages 57-60, for specific instructions on
     launching ordnance. Alos see "Air-to-Ground Tactics" (pages 78-88),
     "Air-to-Air Tactics" (pages 89-97), and "USAF Ordnance" (charts on
     pages 129-134, detailed descriptions on pages 135-146).
        Cannon: The FIRE CANNON key (or button) fires one burst. Your 20mm
     cannon is always available for use (unless out of ammo or damaged).
        Weapons Bay Doors: Before using ordnance you must toggle open the
     weapons bay doors, using the BAY DOORS key. The "BAY" cockpit light
     flashes when the bay doors are open.
        After you have launched the ordnance you should toggle the doors
     closed again (tap the BAY DOORS key once more).
        Launching Ordnance: Tap the FIRE ORDNANCE key (or button) to launch
     a weapon. This fires one missile or drops one bomb. The weapon
     currently selected is the one used.
        Reconnaissance Cameras (the 135 mm/IR Camera) are "fired" like a
     weapon from an open weapons bay. Each "shot" takes on picture.
        SPECIAL EQUIPMENT can be airdropped by opening the doors and "firing"
     it out. It floats to the ground using a parachute. It is also loaded or
     unloaded on the ground at appropriate airstrips automatically (a message
     appears on your HUD when loading or unloading is complete).
                                                                      - 44 -
     ========================================================================
     Evasion & Defense

        For detailed information on the concepts of stealth aircraft, enemy
     weapons, and appropriate defensive tactics see Part 3 ("Techniques &
     Tactics", pages 74-97) and Part 5 ("Equipment", pages 129-156).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     EMV (Electro-Magnetic Visibility) Scale

        This gauge shows the "stealthiness" of your aircraft.
        Your EMV: The "visibility" of your plane to enemy radars appears as a
     bar rising from the bottom of this gauge. Your visibility increases as
     you climb to a higher altitude, increase speed, open bay doors, lower
     gear, or use jammers.
        Enemy Radars: The bars coming down from the top of the scale are
     incoming enemy radar signals. Ground-based radars appear on the left,
     aircraft radars on the right. The bar color represents whether the radar
     sees you or not (see the Technical Supplement for a color key). Bar
     colors match the radar arc colors that appear on the Satellite/Radar
     map (on the left-side CRT).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Warning Devices

        Select Warning: Enemy search radar detects your plane when the
     enemy radar strength bar overlaps your EMV bar, on the EMV scale. Search
     radar appears as a round, expanding circle on the Satellite/Radar map
     (on the left-side CRT).
        The enemy radar symbol changes color on the EMV scale. The
     Satellite/Radar map also shows these color changes. (See the Technical
     Supplement for the radar color key).
        Frequently a single search detection does not give the enemy
     sufficient data to recognize your plane. A message on the HUD warns you
     when repeated detections indicate the enemy has "found" your plane.
        Tracking Warning: Long-range and medium-range SAMs must track a
     target with radar before firing. Tracking radar appears as a short,
     narrow arc on the Satellite/Radar map.
        When the enemy tracks you, the "TRAK" warning is lighted in the
     cockpit.
        Some short range enemy missiles do not use radar tracking system.
     Therefore, "TRAK" is not a foolproof warning of impending attack.
        Missile Warning Lights: If a radar-homing missile is launched toward
     you, the "R" missile warning light flashes in the cockpit. If an IR
     (infrared) homing missile is launched toward you, the "I" missile
     warning light flashes.
                                                                      - 45 -
        The appropriate light continues to flash as long as the missile is
     homing on your plane. If jammers or some other device confuse the
     missile, the light goes off. If the missile later finds you again and
     starts homing once more, the light begins flashing again.
        If two or more missiles of the same type are homing on you, that
     light continues to flash as long as any missile is homing.
        Missile warning lights are very important, since they're the only way
     to tell what kind of missile is attacking. The type of attacking missile
     (radar or IR) determines what sort of defenses you should use.
        Missile Proximity Klaxon: When a missile approaches within a few
     seconds flight time of your plane, the proximity klaxon goes off. This
     very loud signal means you must do something, immediately, or you'll be
     hit soon. Typically you'll drop a chaff or flare cartridge, depending on
     the type of threat (chaff for radar missiles, flares for IR missiles).
     However, you should also make some last-minute maneuvers, especially if
     under attack by missiles with doppler radar guidance systems.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Missile Defenses

        ECM (radar) Jammer:  The ECM key toggles this device on and off. When
     the jammer is running the cockpit "ECM" light is on.
        The ECM radar jammer "blinds" radar-guided missiles. Their missile
     stops homing on your plane and just flies straight ahead. The jammer is
     very effective against older "beam rider" (command guidance) radar
     homing missiles, but only good at long ranges against advanced
     "semi-active" radar homing missiles. These can "burn through" your
     jamming at short range.
        When the ECM jammer is running your EMV is much larger.
        IR (infrared) Jammer: The IR JAMMER key toggles this device on and
     off. When the jammer is running the cockpit "IRJ" light is on.
        The IR jammer "blinds" IR (infrared) guided missiles. They missile
     stops homing on your plane and just flies straight ahead. The jammer is
     highly effective against older "first generation" IR missiles, but only
     good at long ranges against advanced "second generation" missiles.
        When the IR jammer is running your speed is reduced. In addition, the
     jammer cannot run for long periods. When it gets too hot it shuts down
     automatically!
        Chaff:  Tap the CHAFF key to release one chaff decoy cartridge into
     the sky
                                                                      - 46 -
     behind your plane. For the next two or more seconds most enemy radar-
     guided missiles will home in on the chaff instead of your aircraft.
        IMPORTANT EXCEPTION: Enemy doppler-radar guided missiles will not
     home on the chaff unless your on course is perpendicular (at right
     angles to) the missile. As long as the missile chases you from the rear,
     or attacks from straight ahead, chaff has no effect on doppler radar
     missile.
        Flare: Tap the FLARE key to release a flare decoy cartridge into the
     sky behind your plane. For the next two or more seconds all enemy IR
     (infrared) guided missiles will home in on the flare instead of your
     aircraft.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Decoys

        Your F-19 carries only three decoys. To launch a decoy, tap the DECOY
     key. The "DCY" light in the cockpit turns on, and remains lighted while
     the decoy is running.
        Each decoy is a computer-controlled radar emitter and reflector, plus
     IR source. To enemy radar and infrared it looks just like your plane,
     only stronger. The decoy gradually floats down under a parachute. It
     self-destructs before hitting the ground.
        Enemy missiles, aircraft, and ground radars are all fooled by decoys,
     although the amount of time depends on the experience and skill of the
     opposition (time typically varies from 15 to 60 seconds). During this
     time the enemy chases and attacks the decoy instead of you.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Damage

        Theupper left of the cockpit has a bank of "telltale" lights that
     indicate which systems (if any) are damaged. See the Technical
     Supplement for the layout and color-coding of these telltales.
        To see a detailed display of your F-19, with all systems and their
     status, tap the DAMAGE key. The display appears on the right-side CRT.
        RWR/IWR: The Radar Warning Receiver and IR Warning Receiver are
     inoperative. The "R" and "I" warnings of approaching missiles will not
     work.
        Engines:  Engine damage reduces the maximum thrust possible.
     Additional damage anywhere on the aircraft further reduces thrust.
        Flight Controls: Control surface damage makes the plane more
     difficult to control.
        Avionics: Avionics damage means the INS system is malfunctioning, so
     waypoints are no longer available. In addition, the autopilot is
     disabled, since without an INS it cannot function.
        Bay Doors: The ordnance bay doors are damaged and jammed open. Your
     EMV is permanently increased.
        Jammers: The ECM and IR jammers are inoperative.
        Fuel Tanks: Damage and stress breakage is causing fuel to leak. Once
     a leak starts, any further damage, anywhere on the aircraft, increases
     the rate of fuel loss.
                                                                      - 47 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Random Malfunctions

     Your F-19 is an extremely complicated piece of equipment. Random
     malfunctions are possible in any of the systems at any time. The
     malfunction may include the reporting systems on board the craft. If so,
     you won't know that something has malfunctioned until you discover it
     doesn't work!
        Malfunctions are more likely in intense combat situations, due to the
     heavy burden that places on your sophisticated electronic systems.
                                                                      - 48 -
                                   How to Fly
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This section only provides the rudiments of flying. For a more in depth
     description see "Aerodynamics & Flight" (pages 69-73).
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Takeoff

        The preflight checklist for your F-19 Stealth Fighter is:
        1. Check your INS system. Display the satellite/radar map on your
     left-side CRT (using the CRT MAPS key), and the INS waypoints on the
     right-side CRT (using the SELECT WAY PT key). Look up on the HUD and
     note on the heading indicator the location of the INS Direction
     Indicator. Fly in this direction to reach the first waypoint. Advanced
     pilots often adjust their waypoints at this time.
        2. Check Armament: Check your ordnance (tap the ORDNANCE key) on the
     right-side CRT. Use the SELECT ORDNANCE key to toggle through the
     weapons. Note the active weapon is in the lower left corner of the HUD.
        3. Extend the Flaps by tapping the FLAPS key. Note the "FLAPS"
     indicator in the lower right corner of the HUD. Flaps give you more
     lift during takeoff.
        4. Check the Catapult System (on Aircraft Carriers only): When
     launching from an aircraft carrier, the brakes must be start set
     (i.e., "on"). This represents attaching the aircraft to the deck's
     steam catapult. If the HUD does not show "BRAKE" in the lower right
     corner, tap the BRAKE key to set the brakes and engage the catapult.
        5. Start the Engines: Turn on your engines by tapping the MAX PWR key.
        6. Activate Catapult (on Aircraft Carriers only): First wait until
     the bar gauge on the throttle (left side of the cockpit) shows maximum
     power. Then tap the BRAKES key. This releases the brakes and catapult,
     hurling your off the deck.
        7. Accelerate Past Stall Speed: As you move down the runway or
     carrier deck, watch the speed scale (left side of the HUD) very
     carefully. A colored bar on the side of that scale will gradually go
     down. This is the Stall Speed Indicator. When the bar drops below the
     center tick-mark on the scale your plane is past stall speed. This
     happens very quickly on a carrier deck, and somewhat slower on a runway.
        8. Climb into the Sky: Pull back gently on the stick. Watch the
     altitude scale to the right side of the HUD: you'll start climbing.
        9. Retract Landing Gear: Tap the GEAR key to retract you landing
     gear. Don't leave the gear down - both it and your can be damaged if
     left down at too high a speed.
        10. Retract Flaps: Tap the FLAPS key to retract your flaps. You no
     longer need the extra lift.
        11. Turn onto Course: Pull the control stick left or right until the
     INS Direction Indicator along the top of the HUD matches up with the
     center tick of the Heading scale. Since this is a stealth mission,
     you'll want to stay low. About
                                                                      - 49 -
     200' to 500' is ideal.
        Alternatively, you can simply tap the AUTOPILOTkey and let your
     autopilot turn you onto the correct course to the first waypoint.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flying Techniques

        A Light Touch:  Use a light touch on your CONTROL STICK. The most
     common pilot error is a "ham-fist" on the stick, throwing the plane
     around the sky in uncontrolled abandon. That kind of heavy-handed flying
     may be fun in a dogfight, but it's tottaly useless for lining up a
     bombing run, or making a landing. Unless it's an emergency never "peg"
     your control stick (push it to the limit).
        Chasing the Gauges: When you change an aircraft's operating regime,
     by moving the stick, changing the throttle, etc., the effects of the
     change don't happen instantly. It takes a second or two for your gauges
     and displays to "settle out" and show the new situation. For smooth
     flying a pilot always makes a change, then observes the effects.
     Constant adjustments and correction should be avoided, because all
     you'll do is "chase the gauges", overcorrecting every move.
        Straight & Level Flight: To be a good combat pilot, you need to
     master level flight. Do this in a training scenario, rather than real
     life.
        To learn level flight, climb to an altitude above 500' (say 2000',
     or 2K on the HUD altimeter). Now level the aircraft so the nose of the
     plane points at the horizon. Next reduce the throttle to about 75% to
     achive an economical cruising speed.
        Although the cross-hair nose indicator on the HUD may appear level
     with the horizon, a glance at the HUD's altimeter and VVI will probably
     show that the plane is gradually climbing or descending. If you're
     gradually climbing, push forward a tiny bit on the Control Stick (pitch
     down), then let go and see what happens. If you're descending pull back
     (pitch up) a bit instead. Your objective is to keep the altimeter rock
     steady. You'll notice that your flight path indicator aims at the
     horizon, but your nose indicator may be pointed above or below it,
     depending on your speed. Generally, the slower you're travelling, the
     higher you must pitch the nose up to achieve level flight )i.e., to
     place the flight path indicator on the horizon).
        Now experiment. Tap the BRAKES key. This slows down you plane. Watch
     the HUD and notice how the flight path indicator frops down. Meanwhile,
     on the sides of the HUD, your speed is dropping (no surprise, with the
     brakes on!) and so is your altitude. To achieve level flight at this
     new, lower speed pitch up (pull back on a stick a tiny bit) until the
     flight path indicator is level with the horizon. You may adjust once or
     twice to find the setting.
        This adjustment of pitch to achieve level flight is called changing
     your "angle of attack" (the angle at which your wings slice through the
     air). See "Aerodynamics & Flight", page 70, for a detailed explanation.
        Turns: As your roll angle (when turning right or left) increases
     beyond 45o, your stall speed rises from the normal 120 knot range to
     over 200 knots (in a 90o
                                                                      - 50 -
     roll). Since tight turns often "bleed off" airspeed, a long, tight turn
     can reduce your airspeed below the stall speed. Keeping an eye on the
     airspeed and stall speed is especially important when making tight turns
     at low altitide. If you're only a few hundred feet from the ground, a
     stall means a crash!
        In very tight turns (where you roll 80o, 85o, or even 90o), once in
     the turn uou can tighten your turn rate by pulling back on the stick
     (i.e., pitching up the nose). However, this trick bleeds off airspeed
     even faster, so keep a close eye on the stall speed bar (on the HUD
     airspeed gauge).
        LOOPS are easy in your F-19 Stealth Fighter, but ballistic ("straight
     up") climbs can only be maintained for short periods: the engines are
     insufficient for a prolonged ballistic climb.
        Remember that any prolonged vertical maneuver greatly reduces
     airspeed, which risks a stall if you didn't start the maneuver with a
     lot of speed. However, going vertical is very handy for changing
     direction, since you can roll while vertical, quickly pointing your nose
     in the desired direction, then push down into level flight again.
        Low Altitude Flying: At altitudes under 500 feet you can expect
     increased buffets, downdrafts and other irregularities that make flying
     difficult. Also beware of low ridges and mountains. It's easy to fly
     into a mountain if you're not looking. Good pilots develop a "cross
     check" routine of scanning the entire HUD periodically, to make sure
     everything is okay.
        In "No Crash" and "Easy" flight options you have a barometic/laser
     altimeter. If you drop below 200' this device automatically but gently
     pushes your plane above 200 feet. Be warned, the device does
     automatically turn off when the landing gear is down, or when the gun is
     firing. The device is not proof against power dives, stalls, or other
     radical maneuvers, but works fine in normal flight regimes.
        In fully realistic flight the automatic altimeter that keeps you
     above 200' is turned off. This allows a skillful pilot to cruise at even
     lower altitude.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Runway Layouts

        Airbases: All ground runways and aircraft carriers have a nort-south
     orientation and a center stripe down their middle. On approach a course
     of 000 (if coming from the south) or 180 (if coming from the north) will
     aim you directly at the runway.
        Airbase runways are more than twice as long as your safe landing
     distance at 200 kts. You have a large safety margin.
        Aircraft carriers have arrestor wires near the stern. You must touch
     down before or on these wires, which catch and stop your plane. If you
     miss the wires, which catch and stop yor plane. If you miss the wires
     you will you will roll off the deck (your brakes aren't good enough to
     stop the plane in such a short distance). Do not attempt to land on the
     bow of an aircraft carrier. There are no arrestor wires there.
     Furthermore, regular aircraft spotted for launching may be positioned
     there. You don't want to crash into them!
        The ILS glide slope (see below) for aircraft carriers is steeper. In
     fact, some pilots refer to a carrier landing as a "controlled crash".
,                                                                       - 51 -
        Aborted Landings: If you get in trouble landing, open the throttle to
     full power, thenretract the flaps and landing gear. Climb away and come
     around for another try. Do not make wild movements with the control
     stick while landing or aborting. Wait for your airspeed to exceed 300
     knots before making any big turns or similar maneuvers. Until then,
     gross maneuvers with the control stick may stall the plane, causing a
     fatal crash.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Using the ILS (Instrument Landing System)

        To use the ILS, switch the HUD to NAV mode (tap the HUD MODES key as
     necessary), turn on the tracking camera (tap the CAM AHEAD key), and tap
     the ILS key. The ILS and camera will automatically track the nearest
     friendly or neutral landing site. It will not track on rough air-strips
     behind enemy lines; there you must land without ILS aid.
        Concept: The ILS symbols represent your position in relation to the
     "glide slope". The glide slope is an invisible "beam" that angles out
     and up from the end of the runway. Approaching from a distance (say, 50
     km away) you first fly beneath the glide slope and turn onto its
     bearing. Then you follow it toward the airbase, eventually intercepting
     it. Then you follow it down to the airbase.
        Line Up Your Approach: The first step is to line up on the correct
     course to the airbase (or aircraft carrier). To do this, fly at 500' to
     1000' ('1K') to a point about 40 to 50 km north or south of the base and
     turn until the ILS vertical bar is centered on your HUD's nose
     indicator.
        If the horizontal bar is above the HUD's nose indicator, you are
     flying beneath the glide slope (the bar represents the position of the
     glide slope). This is correct. Since all airbases and carriers are
     north-south oriented, your course should be either 000 or 180.
        If the bas is beneath your nose indicator, you are flying above the
     glide
                                                                      - 52 -
                               <<< EMPTY >>>                          - 53 -
     slope. You are either too high to the airbase, perhaps both. Fly away
     and/or lower and try again.
        Intercept the Glide Slope: Once you are beneath the glide slope
     (vertical bar centered, horizontal bar high), fly along this course. The
     horizontal bar should gradually drop down, until it tii us centered.
     When the horizontal bar is centered, you are now intercepting (flying
     through) the glide slope.
        As you fly your course to the intercept, you should prepare for
     landing by reducing the throttle (see below). Using this "straight-in"
     approach, you can now extend (open) the flaps.
        Descent: When you intercept the glide slope, begin your landing
     descent. You want to keep the horizontal bar centered, which means
     making a gradual descent.
        You must manage the descent like a normal landing (see below). This
     means opening flaps, extending the landing gear, reducing the throttle,
     and making small pitch-up adjustments to maintain the correct descent
     speed.
        Touch down: The ILS will not guide you to touch down. It is not
     accurate in the immediate vicinity of the base. It turns off
     automatically before you reach the runway.
        ILS and Landing Patterns: The ILS is designed to guide you to the
     airbase. It does not control your plane through a landing pattern.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Straight-in Landing

        1. The ILS (Instrument Landing System): First use the ILS to line up
     onto a correct approach (see above). Beginners should plan to intercept
     the glide slope (i.e., get onto their approach) about 40 km to 50 km
     from the runway. Attempting to find the approach and make a landing
     less than 20 km from base is NOT advised for beginners.
        2. Approach at 300 kts: Fly your approach at 500' to 1000'. Reduce
     the throttle to about 70%, which should reduce your speed to about 300
     kts. Eventually you'll need to pitch up (raise the nose) a little to
     maintain level flight.
        3. Level flight at 300 kts (throttle 70%): As you approach in level
     flight, reduce your throttle until the airspeed shows 300 knots (about
     70% throttle). You'll need to raise the nose 5o to 7o maintain level
     flight until you're about 20 km from base.
        4. Flaps Out, Throttle 50%, Gear Down: Now extend the flaps and
     reduce the throttle to about 50%. This slows the plane to about 230 kts.
     As you reach this speed, lower your landing gear. If you're moving to
     fast, extend the brakes (tap the BRAKE key) for a brief period, then
     retract them again.
        5. Descend 'On Final': When the ILS horizontal bar reaches the
     middle of the
                                                                      - 54 -
     HUD nose indicator, you should start descending down the glide slope.
        There are two methods for descending. One is to reduce the power
     slightly. If you were in level flight, but now have less thrust, you
     will gradually descend. This method is generally preferred by pilots,
     but in a hot jet like the F-19 it takeseffect very slowly.
        The other method is to reduce the pitch of the nose slightly.
     Typically you're landing with the nose pitched up about 5o to 7o, to
     maintain level flight at low power. Therefore, reducing this upward
     pitch a few degrees will cause a gradual descent. Do NOT point the nose
     down and dive for the runway.
        In either case, your nose should always have a positive pitch (i.e.,
     the HUD nose indicator should be above the HUD flight path indicator).
        Use the ILS horizontal bar to control your rate of descent. Adjust
     the throttle or pitch (depending on your technique) to keep the bar in
     the middle of the HUD's nose indicator. A good pilot will set up his
     descent rate as he enters the glide path and leave it untouched as the
     plane gradually descends.
        Finally, keep an eye on your airspeed and the stall bar. If the stall
     bar indicator gets too close to your current airspeed (within 25 kts),
     your throttle is too low or you're flying with brakes on. Increase the
     throttle or take off the brakes. Conversely, if you're moving too fast
     (over 250 kts), extend the brakes (tap the BRAKE key) for a breif
     period, then retract them again.
        6. Touch Down: Your altimeter will read an altitude of 0o' on a
     runway, and 125' on an aircraft carrier deck. These are your "touch
     down" altitudes. The safe touch down verticaly velocity is shown by an
     arrow on the VVI portion of your HUD altimeter. A VVI of 400'/minute or
     less (4 ticks on the scale) is always safe. In certain conditions a
     higher VVI is allowable.
        The easiest and safest touch down is simply to gradually continue
     the descent until you're on the runway. Then cut the power (tap the NO
     PWR key) and engage the brakes (tap the BRAKES key).
        Aircraft Carriers: Landing on a carrier is slightly more difficult,
     since you must touch down in the arrestor cables area. To avoid
     overshooting the cables, increase your descent by lowering the nose a
     little extra, then at the last second extend the air brake (tap the
     BRAKES key) as you pull the nose back up a bit.
        If you miss the carrier's arrestor cable area, don't bother trying
     to touch down. Instead close the brakes (if you opened them earlier)
     and hit maximum throttle (tap the MAX PWR key). Since your nose is
     pointed up, you'll climb upwards again.

                                                                      - 55 -
                                  How to Fight
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This section provides a short primer is how to engage the enemy, and how
     to defend yourself from their attacks. For more information see
     "Techniques & Tactics", pages 74-97
     ========================================================================
     Firing Procedures
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hitting the Target

        See "Aircraft Controls, Weaponry" (pages 43-44) for a detailed list
     of each weapon control.
        (1) Find the Target: The world is a very large place. Fortunately,
     your primary and secondary targets are stored in the memory of your INS.
     Initially your #2 waypoint is always the primary target, #3 your
     secondary target. If you've changed the waypoint positions, you can
     recover the initial default by pressing the RESET WAY PT key.
        To reach to the target easily, call up the waypoints (press the
     SELECT WAY PT key), step by keypress down to the appropriate point (#2
     or #3) using the NEXT POINT key, then steer toward it using the INS
     Direction Indicator on the HUD's heading scale.
        (2) HUD: Change the HUD to the correct mode. Use the HUD MODES key
     to select the right mode: NAV (for takeoffs and landings), AIR-AIR (for
     firing at aircraft), or AIR-GROUND (for firing at everything else).
        (3) Camera: Lock your tracking camera onto the target. Tap the CAM
     AHEAD ket to aim the camera at the nearest standard target ahead. The
     camera remains blank if there are no targets ahead within 80 to 100 km
     in daytime, less at night.
        To see other standard targets, tap the SELECT TARGET key. However,
     the selection is limited to those "standard" targets in your onboard.
     This group always includes the primary and secondary target, of course.
        To line up a target not in your onboard computer tap the DESIGNATE
     NEW TARGET key. The nearest target ahead is temporarily added to the
     computer's database. If you previously designated some other target,
     this new designation replaces that one. Once you've added a target, it
     remains in the computer, and becomes part of the group that "Select
     Targets" cycles through.
        (4) Weapon Selection: Make sure you have the correct weapon selected.
     The size and color of the tracking box on the HUD indicates whether the
     current weapon is effective against that target. The larger the box, the
     more effective the weapon. See the Technical Supplement for the color
     key.
        Press the SELECT ORDNANCE key to cycle through the weapons available
     in your bay. The 20mm cannon is always available (it has a separate
     firing control).
        (5) Aim & Fire: Different weapons are aimed in different ways,
     described below. Depending on the weapon selected, make sure it is
     correctly aimed at
                                                                      - 56 -
     the target before you fire. See below for details.
        (6) Results: Friendly AWACS aircraft observing your mission will
     report the result. Sometimes a hit will damage a target without
     destroying it, sometimes you may miss entirely, and other times a hit
     may be ineffective. Ineffective hits are caused by using the wrong
     weapon (your fault), or because the weapon was a dud.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The 20mm Cannon

        See "Equipment, USAF Ordnance", page 131, for a chart that indicates
     the cannon's effectiveness against various targets.
        Air-to-Air - Anticipation Firing: The tracking box on the HUD shows
     the enemy airplane that's your target. The range appears in the
     right-side CRT. Your maximum cannon range is 6 kilometers. Effective
     cannon range is about 3 km (beyond that shells miss frequently).
        The moving gunsight shows the position your shells would be landing,
     assuming you fired in the past. This is called an "historical gunsight".
     It takes cannon shells about 1 second to travel 3 kilometers. The
     gunsight assumes shells will travel about 2 seconds (6 kilometers)
     unless you are tracking closer target.
        To fire, you must "anticipate" when the enemy and your gunsight will
     meet. At the appropriate time before that meeting you open fire. For
     example, if the enemy and your gunsight are converging and the range is
     6 km, you should open fire 2 seconds before they converge. If you
     estimated correctly, they will converge just as your gunsight moves
     onto them.
        Air-to-Ground - Walking Fire: Attacking ground targets is much
     easier, since they don't move. The easier way to score hits is by
     "walking" your fire over the target. Do this by opening fire about 6 km
     from target and observe where the shells hit the ground. Guide your
     plane to "push" the advancing explosions onto the target. Unfortunately,
     this technique consumes ammo rapidly unless you fire in short bursts,
     spaced well apart until.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Guided Missiles

        See "Equipment, USAF Ordnance", page 131, for a chart that indicates
     which weapons are most effective against which targets.
        Target Envelope: If the HUD is in Air-Air mode and an AAM is your
     current armament, a wide circle appears on the HUD. This is the target
     envelope of your missile's seeker head. The missile can lock on to enemy
     aircraft within this area, provided it's within range.
        Oval lock-on: The tracking box on the HUD shows your target. When the
     tracking box becomes an oval, the missile is locked on and has a good
     chance of hitting. When the oval changes color, the missile has superior
     accuracy.
        To fire, open the weapons bay (tap BAY DOORS key) and then tap the
     FIRE ORDNANCE key.
                                                                      - 57 -
        Restrictions: Missiles drop about 300 to 400' from your plane when
     launched, depending on weight, etc. In addition, they drop away with
     whatever airspeed, climb rate, or dive rate your plane has. As a general
     rule, don't launch a missile below 500' or in a power dive - it may hit
     the ground before it can fly away! See part 5, "Equipment, USAF
     Ordnance", page 131, and the descriptions following on pages 140-142 for
     more details.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PAVE TACK Laser-Guided Bombs

        These weapons are essentially motorless missiles. They glide from
     your plane to a target "painted" by the PAVE TACK laser mounted on the
     bottom of your plane. See part 5, "Equipment, USAF Ordnance", page 131,
     for a chart that indicates which weapons are most effective against
     which targets.
        Oval & CRT lock-on: The tracking box on the HUD shows your target.
     When the tracking box turns oval, the bomb is locked on and has a good
     chance of hitting. When the oval changes color, the bomb has superior
     accuracy.
        You should always use the tracking camera (tap CAM AHEAD key) with
     these weapons. When the box turns oval the "Missile Lock" crosshairs
     appear on the right-side CRT. If you are "toss-bombing" (see below) the
     HUD box/oval is often invisible, so the tracking camera message on the
     CRT is your only indication of lock-on.
        Toss Bombing: The problem with glide bombs is that they travel about
     as fast as your plane. If you launch them from low altitude, they arrive
     at the target about the same time as your plane, and the resulting
     explosion can damage or destroy you.
        Therefore, the standard attack technique is "toss bombing". Approach
     level, flying full speed at 500' altitude. At 3 km to 6 km from the
     target you pitch up into a climb (30o to 40o) and watch the CRT until
     lock-on occurs (see below). Then launch the bomb and turn away. you must
     keep the underside of your plane aimed at the target until the bomb
     hits, so don't make the turn too violent! For more details on toss
     bombing, see page 79.
        To fire, open the weapons bay (tap the BAY DOORS key) and then tap
     the FIRE ORDNANCE key.
        Restrictions: Laser-guided bombs glide to the target; they have about
     1 km of range for every 500' of altitude you have. The weapon explosion
     has a danger space of 3000', so it's important that you gain enough
     distance or altitude to avoid being caught in the blast. However, you
     must keep the underside of your aircraft facing the target until the
     bomb hits. If not, the laser guidance for the bomb breaks and it will
     almost surely miss.
                                                                      - 58 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Retarded Bombs

        These are unguided bomb with special fins that slow them down very
     quickly. As a result, they rapidly fall behind your aircraft, allowing
     safer bombing at lower altitudes. See "Equipment, USAF Ordnance Charts",
     page 131, for a chart that indicates which weapons are most effective
     against which targets.
        Level Bombing: In this standard technique for retarded bombing, you
     fly straight over the target at low altitude, releasing the bomb(s)
     according to the cues on your HUD. For details and tactics on level
     bombing, see page 79.
        Flightpath Guide: Begin your bombing run by flying level above 500'.
     Turn to match your course (the flightpath indicator) to the
     diamond-shaped flightpath guide on your HUD.
        You can be above or below the flightpath guide without losing
     accuracy, but being left or right of the guide will cause a miss.
        Ranging Bar: As you approach the target, the ranging bar gets shorter
     and shorter. The cue to release a bomb is when the line becomes a single
     dot. You may wish to extend your brakes (tap the BRAKES key) to make your
     bombing run slower and more manageable.
        To Fire: Open the weapons bay (tap BAY DOORS key) and then tap the
     FIRE ORDNANCE key. If your brakes are extended, retract them immediately
     (tap the BRAKE key a second time) after firing to hasten your escape
     from the blast area.
        Restrictions: The HUD bombing symbols flash if dropping a bomb could
     injure your aircraft. For example, this may occur early in a bombing run,
     before you climb above 500'. However, the computer predictions assume
     you continue to fly "as is". If you drop the bomb, then immediately turn up
     and away, you could drop a bomb within the "danger area" and escape.
        As a general rule, it's very unsafe to drop retarded bombs below 500'
     altitude.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Free-fall Bombs

        These are traditional bombs that arc down at high speed toward the
     target. See "Equipment, USAF Ordance", page 131, for a chart that
     indicates which bombs are most effective against which targets.
        Level Bombing: This is the easiest method of using free-fall bombs.
     Level bombing with free-fall bombs is essentially the same as using
     retarded bombs, except the minimum safe bombing altitude is 3000' instead
     of 500'.
        See page 79 for additional tactics and techniques, notablt dive
     bombing.
        Flightpath Guide: Begin your bombing run by flying level at 3000'.
     Now turn to match your course (the flightpath indicator) to the
     flightpath guide on the HUD.
        You can be above or below the flightpath guide without losing
     accuracy, but being left or right of the guide will cause a miss.
        Ranging Bar: As you approach the target, the ranging bar gets shorter
     and shorter. The cue to release a bomb is when the line becomes a single
     dot. You may wish to extend your brakes (tap the BRAKES key) to make
     your bombing run slower and more manageable.
                                                                      - 59 -
        Bombsight Fall-line & Bullseye: In level bombing the fall-line
     indicator usually extends off the HUD, with the bullseye out of sight
     below.
        To fire, open the weapons bay (tap BAY DOORS key) and then tap the
     FIRE ORDNANCE key. Then immediately turn away. Don't fly over the
     target, since you could be caught in the explosion. If your brakes are
     extended, retract them immediately (tap the BRAKES key a second time)
     after firing to hasten your escape from the blast area.
        Restrictions: The HUD bombing sysmbols flash if you're within the
     blast area of the bomb (within 3000' of the predicated drop point). Do
     not drop the bomb unless you are confident you can escape the blast. As
     a general rule, you need 3000' altitude when level-bombing with
     free-fall bombs.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     135 mm/IR recon Camera

        This is a reconnaissance camera mounted in the weapons bay that is
     fixed forward (unlike your target tracking camera, which moves):
        Camera Operations: To configure your HUD and cockpit for camera
     operations, follow these steps:
        (1) Switch the HUD to Air-Ground mode (use the HUD MODE key).
        (2) Select the 135mm/IR camera as your ordnance (use the SELECT
            ORDNANCE key).
        (3) Aim the tracking camera at the target (use the CAM AHEAD key,
            with the SELECT TARGET key if necessary).
        (4) Open the weapon bay doors (tap the BAY DOORS key).
        Taking pictires: To take pictures, fly the plane so the small cross
     symbol passes through the center of the target box on the HUD. As this
     happens, you'll see the object pass through the lens on the CRT. As it
     does, hit the FIRE ORDNANCE key once or more to take the pictures.
     You'll see a message on the CRT indicating a good picture (when and if
     you get one).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Special Equipment

        Delivering or Picking Up Equipment: Finding the secret airbase and
     landing there is a major challange. Secret airstrips have no ILS system
     - just a few flares at each end of the runway! Furthermore, the runway
     is very short: only half the lenght of the runway at a major airbase.
        To pick up or deliver equipment at a secret airbase, land at the
     airbase. Equipment is unloaded or materials delivered to you
     automatically. A message in the HUD indicates when this occurs. Then
     you can take off again.
        Airdropping Equipment: To airdrop equipment, open the weapon bay
     (tap BAY DOORS key) and make sure the equipment is the current bay
     ordnance (tap SELECT ORDNANCE key until it appears in the lower left
     corner of the HUD). As you pass over the top of the radio beacon launch
     the equipment by tapping the FIRE ORDNANCE key.
        The minimum safe altitude to airdrop equipment is 500'. Try to avoid
     dropping it from altitudes above 1000' (1K'), since the higher you are,
     the less accurate the drop.
                                                                      - 60 -
     ========================================================================
     Stealth & Defenses
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Evading Detection

        Keeping a Low EMV: The lower your EMV, the more difficult it is for
     enemy radars to spot your aircraft. To maintain a low EMV you must fly
     low and level. Your gear should be up and your weapons bay doors closed.
     The jammers should be off.
        Enemy Radar Effectiveness: Enemy radars vary with terrain, range, and
     type (pulse or doppler). On must systems, color represents the strength
     of an enemy radar signal. See the Technical Supplement for the color
     codes used.
        Terrain: Radar is most effective over open water or flat countryside.
     In wooded and rolling hills radar effectiveness is less, while in
     mountainous country radar effectiveness is greatly reduced. The lower
     the radar effectiveness, the weaker their signal. This weakening is
     visible on the EMV scale: the bars represents enemy radar signals become
     shorter.
        Range: At very long ranges enemy radar is weak. As the range gets
     smaller, the radar becomes more powerful. Maximum range for a radar
     varies dramatically with the set. As enemy radars emit signals you can
     graphically see their ranges on the Satellite/Radar map on the left-side
     CRT (use CRT MAPS key).
        Pulse Radar: These radars are represented by dotted arcs on maps.
     Pulse radars are least effective when your nose or tail is pointing
     toward them, and most effective when your side points at them. Therefore
     a common tactic is to fly directly at a pulse radar, then just after it
     emits a signal make a tight turn and fly away from it again.
        Doppler Radar: These radars are represented by solid arcs on maps;
     they are generally more powerful than pulse radars. Doppler radar is
     most effective when you are flying toward or away from them, and least
     effective when you keep a constant distance from it (i.r., your side
     point at it). Therefore a common tactic is to fly toward a doppler until
     just before it detects you, then turn and fly in an arc around it,
     keeping a constant distance.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Rules of Engagement

        The war situation (Cold, Limited or Conventional) determines the
     Rules of Engagement (ROE) in force. In Cold or Limited War you must
     prevent enemy aircraft and radars from reporting your presence. This
     means any who do see you should be destroyed if possible.
        Aircraft visual sightings are especially dangerous. You should make
     every effort to shoot down an aircraft that gains a visual sighting.
        Radar sightings are less dangerous, but a number of sightings is also
     very bad. Destroy radar sets that sight you where possible.
        Also note that the ROE during Cold and Limited War will penalize you
     for hitting certain targets. Indescriminate slaughter and destruction is
     not rewarded in these situations! See "Briefings, Rules of Engagement",
     page 99 for more details.
                                                                      - 61 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Defending Against Attacks

        Recognizing an Attack: Missiles cannot be fired until the enemy
     discovers your presence. As long as enemy search radars don't see you,
     you're safe from attack (with one exception, see below.
        Enemy radar-guided missiles and longer-ranged IR (infrared) missiles
     "telegraph" their intentions by tracking you on radar first. This
     activity lights up the "TRAK" warning light in your cockpit. Once a
     missile is fired the "R" radar missile warning light, or "I" infrared
     missile warning light begins flashing. When a missile is within a few
     seconds of hitting your craft the missile alarm klaxon sounds.
        Many short-range Ir missiles don't use radar guidance. Therefore,
     these missiles do not activate the "TRAK" light. Instead they're
     launched from a visual sighting. They do not require any radar searches
     or tracking. If you fly near these launchers or over troop
     concentrations, you can be attacked at any time.
        Disappearing: If you are attacked by radar-guided missiles (either
     the "TRAK" light is on, or the "R" missile warning is lighted), you can
     evade the attack by reducing your EMV or lower the enemy radar's
     effectiveness (or both). If the enemy radar loses sight of you the
     missile loses guidance and flies blindly ahead. It continues until
     either the enemy finds you again and steers the missile back on course,
     or the missile runs out of fuel.
        Decoys: Your F-19 carries three (3) general-purpose decoys (launched
     with the DECOY key). Each one lasts 150 to 60 seconds after launch,
     depending on enemy quality. Launch a decoy to draw the enemy away from
     your course, or if you're under attack by so many missiles and planes
     you can't possibly evade them all.
        Jammers: Use the ECM jammer against radar-guided missiles (missiles
     that light the "R" missile warning in your ockpit); use the IR jammer
     against IR guided missiles (those which light the "I" missile warning
     in your cockpit).
        After you turn on the jammer, change to a different course and get
     away from the missile. If you don't, when you turn off the jammer (or an
     advanced missile gets close enough to "burn through" your jammer), it
     will start homing on you again. Advanced missiles that can "burn
     through" jamming include semiactive radar and second generation IR
     missiles.
        Don't leave your jammers running. The ECM jammer increases your EMV,
     while the IR jammer reduces your speed. In addition, the IR jammer can
     overheat, causing it to automatically shut down until it cools off.
        Chaff and Flares: A chaff or flare cartridge will decoy a missile
     for a few seconds. During that time the missile flies toward the chaff
     (if a radar homing missile) or a flare (if an IR homing missile).
        Fire a flare cartridge (tap the FLARE key) when an infrared missile
     ("I" missile warning is lighted) causes the klaxon to sound.
        Fire a chaff cartridge (tap the CHAFF key) when a radar missile ("R"
     missile warning is lighted) causes the klaxon to sound. Then
     immediately turn
                                                                      - 62 -
     perpendicular to the missile's path, which is the safest way to evade
     a doppler-radar missile.
        Maneuvering:  Missiles only have a 45o forward "view". If you are
     outside of this arc, the missile cannot track you. Therefore, if you
     can lure the missile with a decoy, chaff or flare, or jam it, then fly
     outside of this arc, it will fly off. Some missiles, unfortunately, may
     circle around for another pass.
        Missiles also have very wide turning circles. you can "turn inside"
     a missile, causing it to zoom past you.
        A Note on Missile Warheads: Most missiles have proximity warheads:
     they explode when they pass within a certain distance of an aircraft.
     The warhead is in the center section of the missile. However, the rocket
     motor to the rear is often unaffected by the warhead, and continues
     running. Therefore a missile may appear to keep on going after it
     explodes.
                                                                      - 63 -
                             Postflight Debriefing
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ending a Mission

        Safe Landings: When you land, stop, and turn off your engines the
     mission is over. Once you land, you CANNOT refuel or rearm to continue
     the mission. All stealth missions are costly, carefully planned "one
     shot" operations. If a missile fails, higher-ups will decide later
     whether to try again, and if so, when, where and how. You may even get
     the same mission again some day!
        Crashes: If you're using easy or realistic flight, crashing the
     aircraft ends the mission. It also ends your career. To remain alive,
     you must eject before the plane hits the ground. Of course, selecting
     "no crash" eliminates this problem. Its also greatly reduces your
     possible score.
        Bailing Out: Safe ejection occurs between 2000 and 14000' altitude
     with the plane in a gentle climb. Ejecting outside of these limits,
     especially from a plane under 2000' altitude or in an inverted dive,
     can cripple or kill you.
        Where you eject is important. Ejecting over water, away from an enemy
     coastline, is the ideal location. You can be rescued and the aircraft
     sinks out of sight. The next best location is over friendly territory.
     Again, you can be rescued, but fragments of the wreckage could be found
     by the public or enemyspies. Bailing out over enemy territory is the
     worst option. You will probably be captured, and fragments of the
     wreckage will certainly be found by the enemy, helping them learn the
     secrets of American stealth technology. Furthermore, if you are
     captured, you may suffer a public trial and other humaniliations before
     the Air Force manages an exchange to get you back.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ratings

        After the mission you are debriefed. Your cammander goes over the
     mission step by step, evaluating each event as it occurs and assigning
     a numerical score. Basically, if you accomplish the mission and follow
     the Rules of Engagement (ROE, see page 99), you'll  do well. The more
     difficult or impossible to gain any credit.
        Cold War: Here it's important that nobody detect your presence.
     Visual sightings by enemy aircraft do the most damage. Enemy radars
     that positively track your plane are also bad. On the other hand, your
     commander gives you some credit for undetected flight through enemy
     territory.
        Needless to say, random destruction is also a "no-no" in cold war.
     Naturally, destroying friendly planes and ground installations is the
     worst possible event. However, destruction of neutral or civilian
     target is almost as bad. The least embarassing events are destruction
     of enemy military targets, although even that should be avoided. In
     fact, the only time it is "permissible" to destroy
                                                                      - 64 -
     targets is if your mission orders require it, the enemy has sighted or
     tracked you, or if the enemy fired first.
        Limited War: Here it's still important to avoid detection, although
     the penalties aren't as great. Flying undetected is worth a bit, but not
     much. On the other hand, your commander wholeheartedly approves of
     attacks on enemy forces, including military aircraft and obvious
     military installations. Civilian targets (such as passenger airliners,
     oil wells, refineries, bridges, etc.) will cause political problems and
     lower your rating.
        Conventional War: Here your commander doesn't care if you're
     detected. Of course, you may still care, since when the enemy detects
     you they tend to launch all sorts of aircraft and missiles in your
     direction!
        You will gain credit for destroying anything in enemy territory, even
     civilian targets (although military ones are worth more). In fact, your
     commander rather expects that you'll do a bit more than just hit the
     objectives. The only negatives possible come from the destruction of
     neutrals and friendlies.
        Training: You get no credit for training missions. Training missions
     do not count toward promotions either (and therefore don't "drag down"
     your average either).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Decorations, Promotion & Reputation

        Combat Decorations: If your rating on a single mission is high, your
     commander will recommend you for a decoration. The five possible
     decorations, from easiest to most difficult to achieve, are:
        AM:    Airman's Medal - recognizez heroic performance
        DFC:   Distinguished Flying Cross - for superior performance in
               combat
        SS:    Silver Star for Valor - for heroism in combat
        AFC:   Air Force Cross - for extreme heroism
        CMOH:  Congressional Medal of Honor - America's highest military
               decoration

        You'll find that you must be outstandingly successful against the
     toughest opposition in the world to be nominated for the Congressional
     Medal of Honor.
        Other Decorations: The PURPLE HEART is awarded to pilots who come
     home wounded. Surviving a mission with a badly damaged aircraft
     frequently yields this award.
        The COMBAT READINESS MEDAL is awarded to pilots who successfully
     complete combat training by achieving the mission objective. Beyond
     this, the number of missions you survive determines what other ribbons
     you may receive: 5 missions for the OVERSEAS RIBBON - SHORT TOUR, 15
     missions for the OVERSEAS RIBBON - LONG TOUR, 30 missions for the
     LONGEVITY SERVICE RIBBON, and 60 missions for the LONGEVITY SERVICE
     RIBBON with GOLD CLUSTER.
        Promotions: Your starting rank is 2nd Lieutenant. Promotions are
     based both on your total score and on your average score per mission.
     Therefore, if you "goof up" and do badly in a mission, you may need
     extra high-scoring missions before you quality for promotion. In
     addition, you can't get promoted
                                                                      - 65 -
     without having sufficient experience (at least 2 missions for First
     Lieutenant, 5 missions for Captain, 10 for Major, etc). Ranks available
     from lowest to highest, include:

          2nd Lt:   Second Lieutenant (lowest)
          1st Lt:   First Lieutenant
          Capt:     Captain
          Maj:      Major
          Lt. Col:  Lieutenant Colonel
          Col:      Colonel
          B. Gen:   Brigadier General (highest)

        Brigadier General is not a flying rank. You don't have a chance of
     earning that until you're retired from active duty. No pilot is
     expected to fly more than 99 missions. After that the Air Force
     decides: are you promoted to Brigadier General, are you simply given
     a Washington desk job, or do they suggest you leave the service and
     seek your fortune in civilian life? Very, few pilots survive 99
     missions  with a record good enough to earn their "star".
        Incidentally, don't feel badly about a middling rank. In active
     fighter squadrons most pilots are First Lieutenants and Captains.
     Majors serve as flight leaders, Lieutenant Colonels as higher squadron
     officers or commanders, and full Colonels as squadron or wing
     commanders. Promotion to Major or above is increasingly difficult. A
     Lieutenant Colonel still flying active combat missions is an awesome
     thing in the USAF.
        Reputation: In the Officer's Club ("O-club") bar, a flier's
     reputation is based primarily on how many missions he's flown. A
     50-mission veteran has much greater prestige than a 1-mission greenhorn.
     Veterans of similar seniority mat sometimes compare ratings, but nobody
     worries much about ranks or medals: as a fighter pilot, you're already
     a member of a very exclusive club.

     Saving Your Record & Ending the Simulation

        Pilot records are saved automatically. Every time the simulation
     exits the Pilot Roster screen (either to quit the game or to start a
     new mission) the records for all pilots on the roster are updated.
        Note that dead (KIA - killed in action) and retired pilots cannot
     fly missions, but you can leave them on the roster to remind you of
     past glories (or failures).
                                                                      - 66 -

                            3: TECHNIQUES & TACTICS
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Aerodynamics and Flying

     This discussion of lift and flight is not rigorous or precise in a
     scientific sense, It only provides a rudimentary portrayal of the
     physics of flight and its practical effect on aircraft handling.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Basic Forces

        Lift: Aircraft fly because of a pressure difference as air flows over
     and under the wing. The wing design and airflow result in air moving
     faster over the top than over the bottom. This causes high pressure
     beneath the wing and low pressure above it. The wing is pushed upward,
     providing lift. If the pressure difference is great enough, the upward
     lift is greater than the plane's weight (i.e., the force of gravity)
     and the aircraft flies.
        The Four Forces: Aircraft in flight have four basic forces acting on
     them. Thrust pushes the plane forward; it varies with engine power. Drag
     reduces the effct of thrust, but is relatively constant. Therefore, when
     horizontal, more thrust means faster forward velocity. Gravity pulls the
     plane toward the ground, regardless of the plane's attitude. Lift pushes
     upward from the wings, directly opposing gravity gravity when the wings
     are level.
                                                                      - 69 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     How Lift Varies

        Speed & Lift:  The amount of lift generated by the wing varies with
     airspeed. The faster the plane flies, the faster the air flows, so the
     greater the pressure difference. If your plane is in level flight at a
     certain speed, reducing the speed reduces lift, causing a descent (even
     though you didn't nose down).
        Angle of Attack & Lift: The amount of lift generated also varies
     with the angle between the wings and the airflow. If you pitch up a few
     degrees, you increase the pressure difference across the wing,
     increasing the lift. If you pitch down the nose, the reverse occurs.
     This difference between the airflow direction and a line through the
     wing (the wing "chord") is the "angle of attack" (AoA).
        Angle of attack is visible on your HUD in NAV and AIR-GROUND modes.
     In level flight, whenever your nose indicator is above your flight
     path, the difference between the two is the Angle of Attack.
        Level Flight: To acheive "level" flight at a given power setting, a
     pilot raises or lowers the nose until the VVI shows zero (i.e., no
     ascent or descent appears on the "V" strip gauge). Note that a pitch
     of 0o may show ascent or descent. Nosing up or down to a new "angle of
     attack" adds or subtracts lift as needed to acheive level flight.
     NEVER assume that a pitch of zero automatically means level flight.
     Chances are good it doesn't!
        To achieve "level" flight at a specific airspeed, the pilot first
     gets into level flight, next adjusts his throttle to achieve the
     desired speed, then adjusts his nose to find level flight for the new
     airspeed.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Effect of Roll

        Lift is a force perpendicular to the wing. If the wings are tilted
     (your aircraft is rolling or banking) the lift force is no longer
     straight up. Instead it has two components, one moving the aircraft
     sideways, the other straight up. This causes the plane to turn.
     However, it also reduces the force opposing gravity.
        As the bank increases, more and more force is needed to keep the
     plane flying level, since a smaller part of the fource counteracts
                                                                      - 70 -
     gravity. This forece is measured in Gs, and is the reason pilots are
     pressed into their seats during a tight turn. Normal gravity and weight,
     standing on earth, is 1G. Pilots normally cannot survive more than
     7 to 9Gs; any more and they black out, losing control and crashing.
        During a turn a pilot can adjust the angle of attack by control stick
     "backpressure", that is, by pulling back slightly on the stick. The
     amount of adjustment is very small. Overcorrecting is a common error
     among beginner pilots.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Special Situations

        Stalls: An aerodynamic stall occurs when the wing's angle of attack
     becomes too large. The air stops flowing smoothly over the wing, and
     instead part breaks away onto an independent path. This erases the
     pressure difference, vastly reduces lift, and generally causes the nose
     to drop. Stall speed varies considerably depending on aircraft attitude,
     flaps configuration, etc. Tight turns increase the stall speed. Note
     that simultaneously the act of turning tends to decrease your airspeed.
     As a result, stalls are quite common in tight turns.
        Some versions of the F-19 have an audible stall warning horn. All
     versions have a colored bar showing stall speed on the HUD's airspeed
     indicator.
        The F-19 includes a computerized stall recovery governor that
     instantly reconfigures the wing edges for automatic recovery, making
     your job much easier. To recover from a stall, first level the wings,
     then bring the pitch back to normal. A stall invariably costs you
     altitude, so a stall at low altitude can be fatal!
        Flaps: Lowering flaps extends the wing surface and increases the
     pressure difference, adding more lift. They also increase drag, which
     lowers your speed. However, flaps are only useable at low speeds
     (under 300 knots).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Military Landings

        The "straight-in" landing technique described on page 69 is used by
     pilots who are wounded or are flying damaged aircraft. Military pilots
     normally use a 360o Overhead Pattern for maximum speed and efficiency in
     the landing pattern. Pilots who fancy themselves "real Air Force men"
     should use real military landings, not simple straight-in landings.
        A military land pattern has 7 parts: Initial, Pitch Out, Inside
     Downwind, Perch, Final Turn, Final, and Touch Down.
        Pitch Out: Shortly after the runway disappears beneath you, begin the
     "pitch out" turn by banking gradually to a 45 to 60o roll (a left bank
     is preferred by many pilots). This will be a full 180o turn. Your speed
     should drop to about 300 knots while in the turn. You may need to raise
     or lower your nose in the turn to maintain your altitude.
        Inside Downwind: When you finish the turn and level out, you're on
     the
                                                                      - 71 -
     "inside downwind" leg of the landing. Immediately reduce the throttle
     and nose up a bit more to maintain level flight at 300 kts, then lower
     your landing gear.
        Pearch: Look to the side at the runway. When you are even with the
     end of the runway or carrier deck, you've finished the inside downwind
     and are at "the perch", ready to start the final turn. Don't be
     surprised if the first time you look, you're already at the pearch - it
     comes up fast!
        At this point you lower your flaps. Now pitch the nose down until
     your VVI indicates a descent. As you drop the nose begin your final
     turn.
        Final Turn: This is a slow 180o descending turn. You will descend to
     about 300' (for a runway) or 100' (for an aircraft carrier) at 200 to
     230 knot airspeed. Your roll should be 15o to 30o in the turn. Notice
     that the altitude gauge on the HUD gains speed and detail once you pass
     the 1000' (1K) mark. Make sure you don't start out with too fast a
     descent.
        Change your nose pitch (up or down) to control the rate of descent in
     this final turn. You should finish the turn with the runway or carrier
     deck dead ahead.
        Final: When you finish the final turn lined up with the
     runway/carrier, pull the nose up to gain level flight, then back off a
     tiny bit for a very gentle descent. Change pitch to adjust your descent,
     and your throttle to adjust your speed. However, regulating your descent
     rate with pitch changes takes practice. You regulate with pitch (not
     throttle) because if you're too fast you can always cut the throttle or
     use the speed brake at the last minute, or at least come around again
     for another try. But if you get the throttle setting too low you may
     stall and crash
        Touch Down on Runways: When the wheels touch down on the runway, cut
     the throttle, lower the nose wheel to level, and apply the brakes. When
     you stop moving the
                                                                      - 72 -
     mission is over. As in all landings, the downward vertical velocity
     should be less than 400'/minute at touch down.
        A gradual touchdown, as described on page 55, is the safest and
     easiest method. However, "real" pilots reduce the throttle and pull on
     the stick slightly to "flae" on touch down. This scrubs extra speed and
     softens the landing. Of course, this can be tricky - novices sometimes
     "porpoise" or "bunny hop" down the runway because of too much stick
     movement, or worse yet, go too far and stall the plane.
        Touchdown on Aircraft Carriers: When the wheels touch down on the
     stern of the carrier, you should snag an arrestor cable and stop
     immediately. Cut the throttle and apply the brakes to end the mission.
     You can touch down on a carrier at greater vertical velocity than on a
     runway.
                                                                      - 73 -
                                Radar & Stealth
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Radar

        Radar sends high frequency electro-magnetic waves through the
     atmosphere at virtually light speed. These waves bounce off solid
     objects. Some bounce back toward the radar set, which includes a signal
     receiver. By measuring the strenght of the returning signal, angles of
     returning waves, time it took to return, etc., radars estimate the
     range, position, and size of an object.
        Radar waves bounce best from solid, dense, flat, perpendicular
     surfaces. Traditional aircraft shapes, especially aircraft engine
     intakes, slab-sided fuselages, and vertical tail fins make excellent
     radar reflectors

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Stealth Technology

        The radar reflections of an object are greatly reduced if its shape
     minimizes the returning waves. This does not make the object invisible,
     but does make it very hard to "see". For example, if a normal airplane
     is visible to a radar at 200 kilometers away, a carefully shaped
     airplane might be invisible beyond 50 kilometers! Creating this shape
     in a form that is also aerodynamic requires extremly complex computer
     modeling. As the world's leader in computer applications, it's
     inevitable that America would be first in this field. The SR-71 spy
     plane is an early example of such shapes in aerodynamics; the redesign
     of the B-1 bomber fuselage is another example.
        In addition to shape, certain rubber and ceramic compounds tend to
     "absorb" radar waves, making the return signal weaker than normal. Known
     generically as RAM (Radar Absorbent Material), it can be incorporated in
     paints, or plantes in "wedges" along the surface of a wing or fuselage.
        Finally, an airplane's heat signature is an important consideration.
     Many airplane-killing missiles home on the heat sources. The newer
     longer-wavelenght sensors see warm parts of the craft (such as leading
     edges of the wings, tail, and air intakes) heated by air friction. The
     main defense against heat-seekers is to incorporate heat-resistant
     materials onto edges that "cut" through the air, and to mask and
     disperse the hot engine exhaust as much as possible.
        "Stealth" is the combnation of superior shapes and RAM materials
     that vastly minimizes the radar and infrared visibility of an aircraft.
     The F-19 design sacrifices speed, maneuverability, and payload for
     maximum stealth. The air intakes to the twin turbofan engines are
     masked. The fuselage is molded into the wing shape to eliminate hard
     angles, as well as letting the
                                                                      - 74 -
     fuselage itself act as a "lifting body". The tail is twinned and tilted
     inward to reduce reflections. Upper and lower hull and wing surfaces are
     covered with RAM inserts. All weapons are carried internally, since
     external pylons and armaments are excellent radar reflectors. All
     leading edges incorporate heat-resistant surfaces. The jet exhausts is
     directed through slats that absorb heat and mix in cooler air to break
     up the rearward heat signature.
        Stealth also demands a new approach to combat operations. For decades
     jet aircraft have carried radars of increasing power, using them to aim
     weapons, check altitude, and to fly low at high speeds. All this radar
     broadcasting often reveals a plane long before enemy radars discover it.
     A stealth aircraft must fly without active radar emissions. The F-19
     uses visual, thermal and laser systems instead of radars. In addition,
     it has radio burst decoder that is designed compatible with other USAF
     transmission equipment. On an active mission the F-19 constantly
     receives data bursts from friendly AWACS planes and ground radars.
        Overall, the F-19 is most difficult to detect at very low altitudes.
     Even at higher altitudes (over 1000') it is far less visible on radar
     than a normal aircraft. This not only allows the F-19 to "sneak up" on
     the enemy, it also reduces the range and accuracy of enemy weapons.
                                                                      - 75 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Stealth Tactics

        Planning: As a stealth pilot, you must plan your mission. You're
     seeking the best way to slip past the enemy radar defenses, a route in
     and out that either makes you invisible, or makes you visible for the
     shortest periods of time.
        Even the best of plans must be modified once the mission starts.
     Enemy fighter patrols and Mainstays can force you to change your plan,
     while the periodic shut-downs of enemy radars can suddenly open new
     opportunities. You must keep your plans flexible.
        EMV: The F-19's stealth configuration is most effective when flying
     at very low altitude (at 500' or less, and preferably about 200'). The
     EMV is further reduced if the engines are throttled back to cruise speed
     (70% power). Level flight, which presents a horizontal profile, is best.
     The steeper the turn, the more topside or underside surface is presented
     as a radar reflector, and thus the higher your EMV.
        Your flight path is a crucial consideration with enemy doppler
     radars. Changing distance to a doppler radar increases their detection
     abilities manyfold. If you remain at a constant distamce, arcing around
     the radar, their detection ability drops precipitously.
        On the negative side, opening the weapons bay, firing a weapon, or
     using the ECM jammer all raise your EMV, making the plane more visible.
     On the plus side, if you want to deliberately lure the enemy to a
     certain location without wasting a decoy, then turn on your jammer,
     opening the bay, and spiralling upward in a tight turn often raises the
     EMV enough to make you visible. You can then close up, dive down to
     200' again, and zoom away while they chase phantoms.
        Low Altitude Tactics: On long missions with flight legs outside
     effective enemy radar range it's perfectly safe to use the autopilot
     and cruise at 500'. When within enemy radar maximum range, get down as
     low as you can. Flying through valleys between hills and mountains is
     always better than flying over them. Although coming up over ridgelines
     is fun flying, every time you crest a ridge you're a sitting duck for
     enemy radar. Under 500' be prepared for a rough ride due to air
     temperature changes near the ground.
        One especially sneaky tactic is to fly extremely low (200' or less)
     and throttle back your engine to about 30% power. You'll need to extend
     flaps and pitch up (far a high angle of attack) to stay airborne, but
     your EMV is now extremely low. F-19s have skimmed underneath patrolling
     MiG-29s and MiG-31s using this tactic.
        Threading the Needle:  Penetrating through enemy radar umbrellas is
     a tricky job. Remember that you should arc around doppler radars, but
     fly directly toward (or away from) pulse radars. The plotting of paths
     through radar areas is sometimes termed "threading the needle".
        Typically the pulse radars are shorter ranged and less efficient,
     making the dopplers your biggest problem. If you must fly into a pulse
     radar's effective range, you can arc around just inside and hope that
     your EMV is low enough,
                                                                      - 76 -
     and their crews sleepy enough that they don't see you.
        Beware of enemy fighter and AEW&C patrols when "threading the
     needle". Your ideal course can turn into a death trap if enemy fighters
     are waiting for you, or you fly strait toward an Il-76 "Mainstay".
        Decoys: In Cold War or Limited War you must avoid leaving a positive
     radar ID. If your flight path takes you too close to enemy radars, you
     can try leaving one or two decoys behind you. This can prevent them from
     getting a positive radar ID on you.
        Dash: Many radars turn off periodically. If you see a critical
     doppler radar station stop broadcasting, that may give you just the edge
     you need to get past them without being seen. Dashing through a radar's
     area while he's off the airis always risky: you never know if he'll
     "wake up" and find you. Alas, sometimes there's no better way.
        Blast: If you can't think of any better way to get through the
     enemy radar screen, a final device is to use a Maverick or HARM missile
     to destroy the radar, opening a gap. Of course, you've got to dash
     through the gap and get away quickly, since enemy aircraft are drawn
     like flies to the site of any attack. Other radar stations also tend to
     "wake up" and stay on the air more after an attack. One way to "set up"
     a blast attack is show yourself briefly in one location, drawing enemy
     fighters away from the area you plan to fly through and/or attack.
                                                                      - 77 -
                             Air-to-Ground Tactics
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ground Attack
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Target Selection

        Regardless of the weapon system you're using, attacks are much easier
     if your tracking camera is following the target. Remember that the color
     and size of the target box on your HUD graphically illustrates the
     effectiveness of your current ordnance. A totally ineffective weapon
     shows a special color target box (see the Technical Supplement). If a
     weapon is effective, the larger the box, the greater its effectiveness.
        The SELECT TARGET key cycles among all pre-programmed targets in the
     near vicinity ahead of you. Pre-programmed targets include your primary
     and secondary targets, SAM sites, warships, and airbases.
        If you wish to select some other target, you must use the DESIGNATE
     NEW TARGET key function. This locks the tracking camera onto the nearest
     available target directly ahead. The new target joins the pre-programmed
     list (in the Select Target cycle) until you either destroy it or
     designate something else instead. A nearly infinite variety of ground
     targets can be designated, from troop concentrations to major bridges.

        Using your M61A1 20mm Vulcan cannon against ground targets requires
     some skill. In a strafing attack you fly low (under 500') and level.
     Because the cannon gunsight is optimized for air-air combat, "walking"
     your shells across the ground is the be way to hit a target.
     Unfortunately this uses a lot of ammunition. Experienced pilots confine
     themselves ranging bursts until they're close, then use continous
     "walking" fire at the very end, just before they pull away.
        The most difficult problem in strafing runs is your limited range.
     Maximum cannon range is only 6 kilometers, and effective range really 3
     kilometers. This means you have a couple of seconds to hit the target
     before it passes beneath your gun.
        A common error when strafing is "target fixation" where you ignore
     altitude. Remember that strafing means diving - and you've got to come
     up again sometime!
        After you pass your target, close the air brakes, open the throttle
     and turn away. Keep an eye on your missile warnings and be ready to
     drop chaff or flares.

     Air-to-Ground Missile Launch

        See Aircraft Controls, Weaponry, page 43-45 for specific
     instructions on how to use air-to-ground missiles.
        The Maverick (AGM-65D) and HARM (AGM-88A) missiles are both "fire
     and forget" weapons. Once your tracking camera is on the right target,
     it's just a
                                                                      - 78 -
     Matter of waiting for the tracking box to change from square to oval
     (indicating a lock-on), and then the oval to change color (indicating a
     high-accuracy firing solution). Air-to-Ground missiles are valuable, so
     it's generally wise to wait for the highest accuracy shot possible.
        When launched the missile starts with your course and velocity, but
     will fall through the air about 300' before its motor fully ignites and
     accelerates the weapon. Therefore, unless you're climbing, it's unwise
     to fire below 500', and very unwise to fire in a power dive (as the
     missile may slam into the ground before it can fly away). It is also
     extremely unwise to fire while in a tight turn or inverted, as the
     missile may tumble when leaving the bay, losing guidance or even
     smashing into your plane.
        The maximum range of a missile depends both on the amount of fuel it
     has and its launching speed. The faster you're flying, the greater the
     missile range. The tracking box turns oval when you are in absolute
     maximum range. Therefore, if you're flying slowly it's wise to wait a
     bit before launching.
        Once the missile is launched you can change to new targets, new
     weapons, and maneuver as you wish.

     PAVE TACK: Laser Glide Bombing

        See "How to Fight", page 58 for specific instructions on operating
     PAVE TACK laser-guided bombs, including toss bombing.
        Range: Glide bombs can fly about 2 kilometers distance for every
     1000' of altitude you have.
        Toss Bombing: This tactic (described on page 58) is the best method,
     since you can approach the target low (about 500'), and only pitch up
     briefly during the release, after which you roll over and turn away as
     the bomb hits the target.
        Level Bombing: You can level bomb with glide bomb weapons. As a
     general rule you'll need to attack from at least 2000' altitude. Here
     you can lock onto the target at 4 km range. Attack immediately and turn
     away. Remember, though, to keep your underside facing the target. You
     can fly over the target instead of flying past at an angle, but you must
     rise above 3000' to do this safely.
        Needless to say, these high altitudes make you a sitting duck for
     enemy radars and SAMs.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Retarded Bombs

        See "How to Fight", page 59 for specific instructions on launching
     retarded bombs.
        Altitude: Retarded bombs are the easiest and safest weapons to use,
     and one of the most popular among USAF pilots. If you keep up speed in
     your bombing run, you can safely release from just above 500' altitude,
     even though the burst area is 3000'. This is because retarded bombs
     lose speed very quickly,
                                                                      - 79 -
     causing them to rapidly fall behind your aircraft.
        Accuracy: Retarded bombs are also less accurate than free-fall or
     laser-guided bombs. Therefore it's unwise to attack from a high
     altitude, since they will probably miss. It's also very difficult to hit
     pin-point targets with retarded bombs, although cluster bombs (like the
     Rockeye or the Mk 35) give good area coverage, compensating to some
     degree for drop inaccuracies.
        Dive bombing and toss bombing don't produce useful results with
     retarded bombs. You must use level bombing.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Free-Fall Bombs

        See "How to Fight", pages 59-60 for specific instructions on dropping
     free-fall bombs in level flight. Although easily perfected, this
     technique requires you to fly a long, straight course at high altitude
     (3000') - a rather dangerous practice! Dive bombing is a more accurate
     technique, but requires considerable practice and skill.
        Dive Bombing Technique: To make a dive-bombing attack, start by
     flying low toward the target. Switch your HUD to Air-Ground mode, make
     sure the correct ordnance is selected (Mk 82-0 Slick or Mk 122 Fireye),
     and put your tracking camera onto the target. Now follow these three
     steps:
        (1) GUIDE ON THE BOMBSIGHT FLIGHT PATH: Approach the target by
     flying straight at the diamond-shaped bombing flight path indicator.
     It's okay if the indicator is above or below your flight path, but make
     sure it's not to the left or right.
        (2) CLIMB TO ATTACK POINT: As you get to 6 km from the target, zoom
     up into a 55o climb to reach an altitude of 8K (8000') opening your bay
     doors as you climb. Your objective is to reach the 8000' point about
     1.5 to 2 km away from the target.
        (3) DIVE ONTO THE TARGET: Level out, flick open the brakes (tap the
     BRAKES key), and at just under 1 km away push down into a steep (80o)
     dive. As you plummet earthward, line up the bomb bullseye (the circle
     on the end of the fall-line) onto the target box center. Keep an eye on
     your altitude. If you drop below 3K' (3000'), pull out and try again -
     you must drop before reaching 3K' altitude.
        (4) RELEASE BOMB AND TURN AWAY: If you manage to keep the bullseye
     steady within the
                                                                      - 80 -
     target box before reaching 3K' altitude, release a bomb immediately.
     Then continue the dive and alignment, releasing another just before you
     reach 3000' assuming you can keep the plane aligned on the target box.
     After the release pull up sharply and roll away in a 90o turn. Close the
     brake as you do this, to maintain maximum speed into the turn. Then
     close the weapon bay doors.
        Notes: The zoom climb to 8K is the most critical phase of the attack.
     If performed flawlessly, a 55o climb will cover 4 km of ground, assuming
     you start at maximum level speed with 200' altitude and wish to arrive
     at 8000'. Some pilots refer to use a slightly shallower zoom climb up to
     10000', but this exposes you longer, at higher altitudes, to enemy fire.
        Climbing to a dive bombing position usually broadcasts your presence
     to the opposition. Therefore, once you're turning away from the target
     after the bombing run, look over and check the R and I missile warning
     lights for an attack.
        The most common mistake when dive bombing is forgetting to open the
     brakes at the top of the climb (i.e., just before you dive). With the
     brakes closed you plummet so fast it's almost impossible to line up the
     target and release the bomb before reaching 3K' altitude.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Cameras

        See "How to Fight", page 60 for specific instructions on how to
     operate the 135mm/IR camera. Always remember to use Air-Ground mode and
     lock the tracking camera onto the target at the start of the run. After
     you open the bay doors you'll fly to align the Camera Lens Sight in the
     target box, snapping the pictures as you do so.
        Camera runs are similar to strafing runs, but somewhat easier because
     the downward cant of the camera means you can fly a level run, rather
     than dive and pull-out. Some camera experts prefer to fly in a gradually
     increasing climb to hold it on target.
        The greatest difficult in camera runs is clicking the picture at just
     the right instant. Flying with air brakes extended slows your speed,
     making it easier to line up your shots.
        Remember: A successful photographic mission requires a safe landing
     to deliver the film.

     ========================================================================
     SAMs (Surface-to-Air Missile Systens)

     To avoiding enemy SAMs you must understand them. Then you can
     intelligently apply the appropriate defense.
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Radar-Controlled SAMs

        Concept: Medium- and long-ranged SAMs are controlled by radar. All
     types use the same three-step process to engage you, their target:
        (1) RADAR SEARCH: Their search radar scans the sky for alien planes,
     such as yours. Although human eyesight can aid in the search, its range
     is much less,
                                                                      - 81 -
     especially in bad weather. Search radars scan an entire 360o area
     periodically.
        (2) RADAR TRACKING: When a search radar finds your plane, it "hands
     off" the prospective target to a narrow-beam fire control radar,
     usually running on a different frequency. This narrow beam finds and
     locks onto your craft. When the fire control operators are sure their
     beam is tracking correctly they launch a missile.
        (3) RADAR CONTROL: Once the missile is launched, the ground radar
     continues tracking your plane so the missile's course can be updated
     and corrected. There are two common methods of doing this, the older
     "beam rider" (or "command guidance") technique, and the newer
     "semi-active homing" technique.
        Beam Rider SAMs: Using this system, the tracking radar simply
     continues tracking you, its target, while the SAM guides along that
     radar beam toward you. As long as the tracking beam remains on your
     plane, the SAM will hit.
        ECM jammers are an excellent all-purpose defense against beam riding
     missiles. Since your radar reflections must travel all the way back to
     the ground radar, the jammer remains effective even if the missile is
     very close.
        Beam-riders are also the least maneuverable of missiles. If the radar
     beam moves too fast the missile can't correct fast enough and "loses"
     guidance.
        Semi-Active SAMs: This type of missile has a radar receiver and
     computer in its nose. The tracking radar on the ground "paints" your
     aircraft with a radar signal and the missile's nose receiver "catches"
     the reflections. The missile homes on these reflections until it hits
     you.
        ECM jammers are useful only at long range against these semi-active
     SAMs. At close range the "painting" reflections to the missile are very
     strong - strong enough to "burn
                                                                      - 82 -
     through" your jamming. As a result, the missile finds you again,
     assuming you've remained in its 45o field of view.
        Command Guidance SAMs: These modern missiles use semi-active guidance
     (see above). In addition, the firer has a command link to the missile,
     which he can use to override the semi-active guidance. This means that
     if the missile loses guidance or is otherwise confused, the ground
     controller can turn the missile around and try again.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Evading Radar Guided SAMs

        Reduce EMV: The basic way to evade radar-guided SAMs is to disappear
     from their radar. If their signals are just barely overlapping your EMV,
     you should find a way to simply "disappear".
        First and foremost, the further you are from the enemy radar, the
     weaker their signal. Therefore you may wish ti simply turn and run away
     from a while,  until their signal is too weak to "see" you. If the enemy
     is a doppler radar, at various points you should turn parallel to the
     radar. When you do, his signal weakens.
        Also remember that reducing your altitude, lowering your engine
     power, and levelling out your flight all help. Make sure the weapon bay
     doors are closed, the landing gear up, and the ECM jammer is off.
        Decoys: A decoy will fool enemy radars for 15 to 60 seconds,
     depending on the skill of the enemy. During this time missiles, like
     everyone else, will pursue the decoy instead of you. This gives you a
     perfect opportunity to outmaneuver the missile by escaping its 45o
     field of view.
        ECM: Your ECM (electronic counter-measures) radar jammer is an
     excellent defense against beam-riders. As long as it's running they are
     flying blind, and therefore unable to hit you. However, ECM is effective
     against semi-active SAMs only at long range. Remember that if you
     continue flying toward a jammed semi-active missile, eventually it will
     "burn through" and start homing on you.
        ECM jamming makes a lot of noise. Therefore, don't use a jammer
     against semi-active SAMs unless you're going to turn away.
        Chaff: Each chaff cartridge deploys a cloud of tiny tin-foil strips
     that reflect enemy radar. For two or more seconds the strips from a huge
     radar reflector, effectively blinding it, lika a smoke screen.
        Therefore, the classic chaff technique is to wait until a
     radar-guided missile is just a couple seconds away (i.e., when the
     missile proximity klaxon sounds). At that instant fire a chaff cartridge
     (tap the CHAFF key) and turn away. The blinded missile will fly straight
     into the chaff, missing you.
        WARNING: Chaff may not fool a doppler-guided missile (SA-10, SA-12,
     SA-N-6, or AA-10). In this case, you must turn perpendicular to the
     missile.
        Maneuvering: It's important to remember that defense devices aren't
     perfect. Some missiles can "burn through" your ECM. All missiles
     continue seeking after your decoy or chaff expires. Doppler missiles
     will ignore chaff if you're on the wrong course.
                                                                      - 83 -
        Therefore, it's important to maneuver out of the missile's field of
     view when the defense expires. If you don't, the missile will re-acquire
     you and continue on a collision course!
        If you're an especially skillful pilot, you can try out-maneuvering
     and enemy missile without mechanical aids.
        In any case, see "Outmaneuvering a Missile", below. Smart pilots
     normally use both their equipment and their maneuvering skills.
        Warnings & Responses: Your first warning of a radar SAM attack is
     when enemy search radar finds you. Your second warning is when they
     switch over and begin tracking. This sets off your cockpit TRAK light.
     During these stages reducing the EMV is your best defense.
        Your third and most important warning is when the missile warning
     light (in this case the "R" light) comes on. This means a missile is in
     the air, flying toward you. Reducing your EMV may derail the enemy
     attack, but if you're too close to their radar you must use other
     defenses.
        Against a beam-rider you can turn on the ECM, change course a bit,
     and laugh as it flies blindly past.
        Against a semi-active missile you can either jam with ECM or drop a
     decoy, then change course. Some people use both - decoy first, then the
     jammer for insurance. However, this technique only makes sense if you
     can escape the missile's 45o field of view before the decoy and/or ECM
     effects end.
        Your final warning is the missile proximity klaxon. It sounds when
     the missile is just a couple of seconds away. Check the cockpit - if the
     "R" light is burning then a radar missile is inbound. IMMEDIATELY drop a
     chaff cartridge and turn away.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     IR (Infrared) Homing SAMs

        Concept:  Short-range SAMs are usually IR (infrared) homing. The
     largest and most powerful use a three-step process like radar-guided
     missiles:
        (1) Radar search: A search radar inds your aircraft (the "TRAK" light
     comes on in the cockpit).
        (2) Radar tracking: A tracking radar follows your aircraft (the "TRAK"
     light comes on in the cockpit).
        (3) Missile launch: The IR homing missile is launched (the "I"
     missile warning light comes on in the cockpit). At this point tracking
     radar is unnecessary, as the missile can guide itself to target.
        (1) Search: The enemy, searching the sky, detects your plane. Some
     systems use a search radar, others get search information from other
     radar stations over the radio, and some rely on simple eyesight.
        (2) Missile lock-on: The missile is aimed at your plane. If you're
     close enough and "hot" enough, the missile will see your heat signature
     and lock on.
        (3) Missile launch: Once locked on, the missile launches and guides
     itself toward you.
        Shoulder-Launched IR SAMs: The existence of man-portable IR SAMs

                                                                      - 84 -
     makes your life difficult. The enemy frequently waits until point-blank
     range to launch these missiles, the preferred technique being to launch
     them during your attack run.
        Carried by infanterymen, in trucks and jeeps, or stacked inside a
     building door, they are virtually undetectable until fired. Whenever
     significant enemy military forces are deployed you can except these
     weapons. This includes rear area headquarters and depots as well as
     frontline troops.
        First Generation IR Hormers: Early IR homing systems required a large
     heat signature as a target. On a jet airplane, the only area hot enough
     was the engine exhaust. As a result, the missile wouldn't "lock on"
     until aimed at the rear of the plane. Furthermore, the homing head
     wasn't especially sophisticated or sensitive. Just about anything would
     confuse it (including the sun or hot rocks on the ground!)
        Your IR jammer is almost guaranteed to confuse a first generation IR
     homer. As long as you leave the jammer on, the missile will be unable to
     follow your plane. Remember, though, that the jammer slows you down, and
     will eventually overheat, causing it to shut off automatically.
        You can also outmaneuver first generation IR missiles by turning
     tightly toward them. This "rotates" your hot exhaust away from the
     missile's view. The missile may try to turn and follow your exhaust,
     but a tight enough turn always outmaneuvers it (see "Outmaneuveringa
     Missile", below).
        Second Generation IR Homers: Modern IR homing systems are far more
     sophisticated or sensitive. They are tuned to fine changes in
     temperature, and only "recognize" temperature variations typical of
     aircraft. This includes not only the hot exhaust, but all surfaces
     heated by air friction. This heating typically occurs at the nose, wing
     roots, and across the upper surfaces of the plane. Therefore the front
     and top of a plane appear "hot", while the underside is relatively
     "cool". The missile can lock onto your plane whenever it "sees" a hot
     surface.
        IR jammers are only effective at long ranges against second
     generation IR homing missiles.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Evading IR SAMs

        Reduce EMV: As with radar-guided SAMs, if you reduce your EMV and
     disappear from search radars, the enemy is unable to launch new missiles
     at you. Unfortunately, it has no effect against missiles already in the
     air.
                                                                      - 85 -
        EMV reducing methods are the same as above (see "Evading Radar Guided
     SAMs").
        Decoys: A decoy will fool enemy IR missiles (like everyone else) for
     15 to 60 seconds. Tactics are therefore just like decoys against radar
     missiles - outmaneuver the missile by getting outside its view before
     the decoy expires.
        IR Jammers: This device is a heat strobe. It sends out pulses of heat
     that confuse a missile's warhead. The disadvantage of this equipment is
     that it must deploy a generator to provide sufficient power, slowing
     your airspeed by roughly 15%. In addition, the strobe can overheat if
     left running too long. When it overheats an automatic shut-off occurs
     (before it melts down!). If you try to turn it on again shortly after
     shut-off, the strobe is still hot. It will only run for a short time
     before shutting off again!
        First generation IR missiles are easily confused. The jammer is
     effective at virtually any range against these missiles. Unfortunately,
     second generation IR missiles are more "intelligent". They are "fooled"
     by IR jammers only at longer ranges. Even then the strobe pattern can be
     recognized by a seeker with advanced computer logocand once recognized
     the seeker actually homes on the jammer, instead of being confused by it.
        Therefore, it's unwise and sometimes downwright dangerous to leave a
     jammer running when second generation IR missiles are getting close (not
     to mention the jammer overheating and shutting off at an inconvenient
     time).
        Flares: Although called "flares", these are really small, finely
     tuned heat decoys. A flare lures an IR missile toward it (and away from
     you), but only during the 2 to 3 seconds it burns. After that the flares
     dies and the missile resumes seeking. Therefore, like chaff, the
     standard technique is to wait until the missile is a couple of seconds
     away (the klaxon sounds), then drop a flare while you turn away.
        Maneuvering: Maneuvering techniques against IR missiles are the same
     as those used against radar guided missiles. The only differnece is that
     IR missiles tend to be smaller and more maneuverable. Second generation
     missiles are often the most maneuverable, so you're best off relying on
     decoy, jammer and/or flares agianst them.
        Unlike radar guided SAMs, most IR SAMs are very maneuverable, with
     the ability to turn toward their target almost immediately after launch.
     As a result, flying low and close to a battery of maneuverable IR SAMs
     is very dangerous!
        Warnings & Responses: Your first warning of an IR missile attack can
     occur at any time. A search or tracking radar may alert you, just like a
     radar-guided SAM attack. In fact, at that point you can't tell that an
     IR missile attack is coming. However, when the missile is launched, the
     "I" missile warning light goes on (rather than the "R" light).
        In many cases your first warning of attack is the "I" missile warning
     light. This is because lots of cheap IR SAMs have no search radar - just
     eyesight searching. Your first warning is their launch.
        If you know the missile is a first-generation homer, you can turn on
     the IR
                                                                      - 86 -
     jammer, change course and laugh it off. However, it pays to be wary.
     Against second generation missiles the IR jammer may still work - if you
     can get outside it's 45o field of view before it gets too close, or the
     jammer overheats. The reduced airspeed due to using the jammer doesn't
     help, either. Otherwise, you'll have to wait for the proximity alarm
     klaxon.
        Many IR missiles are fired from very short ranges, so short that the
     "I" light is almost immediately followed by the proximity alarm klaxon.
     When you hear the klaxon and see the "I" light burning, your first act
     must be to drop a flare and then dodge!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Outmaneuvering a Missile

        Whether you're using jammers, decoys, or just plain guts, the basic
     principles of outmaneuvering a missile remain the same.
        Evading the Missile's View: SAMs can only "home" on targets within
     the acquisition arc of their seeker. This arc is a bare 45o ahead. If
     decoys, jammers, or whatever temporarily confuse a missile, you evade
     attack by moving outside this 45o arc. Usually the quickest escape
     course is one perpendicular to the missile's flight path.
        Turning inside a Missile: When a missile is close, you still have a
     chance to outmaneuver him. Its turning arc is larger than yours.
        If the missile is trying to fly up your tail, roll over onto a wingtip
     for a tight turn, then pull back hard on the control stick to tighten
     the turn further. Keep an eye on the airspeed, since you can't stay long
     in this kind of a turn - soon the plane will stall. But meanwhile, the
     missile is making a wider, faster turn that causes it to zoom past
     harmlessly.
        Turning toward a Missile: If a SAM approaches you from the side,
     gradually turn toward it, increasing the tightness of your turn as it
     comes closer. The objective is to keep the missile's course at right
     angles (perpendicular) to your own.
        This tactic works because the missile cannot turn with you. Instead
     it gradually falls behind, zooming past your tail.
        Evading Frontal Attacks: If a SAM approaches you from the front, wait
     until it's about 8 to 12 kilometers away (about 2/3rds of a grid square
     on the tactical display).
        Then make a quick 90o turn. This puts the missile facing your side.
     Now roll over 180o and turn toward the missile. Now you're set up for a
     turning battle (see "Turning toward a Missile" above).
                                                                      - 87 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Special Tactics & Problems

        Missile Minimum Range: Large less-maneuverable missiles fire straight
     up when first launched. This means that they can't begin homing until
     they're beyond a certain distance (in range and altitude) from their
     launchers. As a result, circling right over a battery of low-
     maneuverability SAMs can actually be very safe.
        Doppler Missiles: Enemy missiles with doppler guidance systems are a
     special danger. These missiles will not home on the chaff unless your
     course is perpendicular (at right angles to) the missile. If the missile
     chases you from the rear or attacks from straight ahead, chaff has no
     effect.
        Only three SAMs (Surface-to-Air missiles) currently have doppler
     guidance: the SA-10, SA-12, and SA-N-6. Only one AAM (air-to-air missile)
     has doppler guidance: the AA-10.
                                                                      - 88 -

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Attack Techniques
     ========================================================================
     Missiles

        Missile Ranges: The maximum range of a missile depends not only on
     its motor, but your plane's speed at launch and the direction of enemy
     movement. The initial "lock-on" range corresponds to missile maximum
     range if you're at maximum speed. However, if you're moving slower the
     missile may not get that extra boost needed to reach the target.
        A much more important consideration is the enemy's flight path. If
     the target plane is flying toward you, even a maximum range launch is
     likely to reach him. However, if the target plane is flying away the
     missie has a long "stern chase" ahead of it. In such a situation you
     should wait until the oval turns red before launching.
        Radar Guided Missiles: Your AIM-120 AMRAAM missile is one of the best
     medium-range weapons in the world. It is the only "fire and forget"
     radar-guided missile in American inventory. It has sufficient circuitry
     to penetrate most defenses, and sufficient maneuverability to chase down
     most fighters, not to mention nailing bombers and transports. Because
     the AIM-120 has greater range than the Sidewinder (32 km compared to 17
     km), pilots typically open fire with the AIM-120, then switch to
     Sidewinders if any enemy aircraft survive to that range.
        IR Guided Missiles: The short-range AIM-9M Sidewinder is probably the
     best dogfighting missile in the world. It is more maneuverable than the
     AMRAAM, giving it a better chance of "hanging on" to a twisting, turning
     target. The most advantageous firing position for the Sidewinder is up
     the enemy's tailpipes. The next best position is from above, diving down
     onto the top (hot side) of the enemy plane. The third best position is
     directly into the enemy's nose. Shots against the enemy as it crosses in
     front of you, or at its underside (the cold side) have very little
     chance of hitting.
        The main weakness of the Sidewinder is its limited range.
        Technique: When firing a missile, always remember to (1) open the bay
     doors, and (2) wait for the lock-on. If you don't wait for the target
     box to become oval-shaped, you're firing without a lock-on, and will
     almost certainly miss. Then look at your airspeed. If you're moving fast
     (around 500 kts) or the target is closing, a maximum range lock-on shot
     will probably hit. However, if your speed is low or the target flying
     away you should wait until the range closes, ideally until the oval
     turns red.
        Missile accuracy doesn't take into account enemy defensive equipment
     or evasive maneuvering. First line and elite fighter aircraft may prove
     more difficult to hit. Although the "Mainstay" AEW&C craft maneuvers
     poorly, it has superior defensive equipment. You may find that guns are
     necessary against Mainstays flown by a capable crew.
                                                                      - 89 -
        Firing Attitude: Also remember that AAMs, like other missiles, will
     fall 300' to 400' before their motor is powerful enough to guide them
     away to the target. Until then the missile has your speed and VVI. If
     you're diving at the ground, the missile may slam into the ground before
     it can fly away. Firing in a tight turn, or while inverted, can cause
     the missile to tumble as it leaves the weapons bay. The wisest method is
     to fire only when you're level and above 500'.
        Target Discrimination: Sidewinders and AMRAAMs always home on the
     most prominent target, which is usually the nearest. They will do so
     even if you were tracking someone else. In Cold War and Limited War,
     beware of this limited "brainpower" in your missiles. You may be
     tracking a primary or secondary target, fire a missile, and then
     discover it goes for one of the fighter escorts that happens to be
     closer!
        Notes: Your F-19 uses a tracking camera instead of weapon guidance
     radars. This system "downloads" appropriate launch parameters to the
     AIM-120 AMRAAM. Although the AIM-120 itself uses radar, the set switches
     on when the missile is launched. As a result, missile targeting does not
     increase your EMV. Of course, opening the bay doors to fire does
     increase your EMV. A skillful stealth pilot only opens the bay doors
     just before a launch, or during a dogfight.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Guns

        Jet aircraft travel so quickly that conventional machine guns and
     cannons cannot fire fast enough to guarantee a hit: a plane could
     literally fly between the shells. Therefore, modern aircraft cannon are
     either a group of guns (such as the twin 23mm cannons in many Russian
     MiGs) or a multi-barrel gatling gun (such as the six-barrel 20mm M61A1
     on most American jets). Cannons are used because they fire explosive
     shells (machine guns fire less destructive solid lead slugs). Small 20mm
     to 30mm cannons are used because large weapons cannot fire fast enough.
        Aircraft cannons have an effective range of 0.5 to 3 kilometers, a
     maximum range of 6 kilometers. Inside 0.5 kilometers there is a
     significant danger that a piece from a disintegrating target might hit
     you.
        The Historical Gunsight: Your F-19 has the most modern and advanced
     gunsight available: a "historical" gunsight with automatic laser
     rangefinder. In normal operation this gunsight "assumes" you are firing
     at maximum range (6 kilometers). However, if your tracking box is on a
     closer target, that shorter range is used instead for gunsight
     calculations.
        The gunsight computer constantly calculates range, flight path, and
     ballistics for you. It then displays where your shells would be if they
     were hitting the target now. The gunsight continually calculates firing,
     delays the appropriate time and display potential hits as they would
     occur. Therefore, the sight is "assuming" that you fired at the correct
     time in the past (hence the term "historical" gunsight).
        Anticipation Firing: It takes about two seconds for M61A1 20mm shells
     to travel the maximum 6 kilometer range. Therefore, to hit a target you
     must
                                                                      - 90 -
     judge the speed at which the target and your sight converge. You
     should fire about two seconds before they meet. If the range is less
     than 6 km, wait a little less. For example, at 3 km wait until target
     and sight are one second apart; at 1.5 km wait until target and sight
     are a half second apart, etc.
        You can use this sight like an old fashioned predicting sight. That
     is, wait until the sight is on the target, then shoot. But at 6 km range
     you'll have to hope the target stays on the same course for two seconds
     to insure a hit. Airplane targets aren't always so obliging!
        In short, the key to using a historical gunsight is anticipation.
     Don't wait for the sight to reach the target. Instead, learn to
     ANTICIPATE the meeting of sight and target, then shoot ahead of time.
        Performance Limitations: Although the maximum range of your M61A1
     20mm Vulcan cannon is 6 kilometers, this is not the recommended
     engagement range. At ranges beyond 3 kilometers accuracy falls off
     considerably. Also beware of firing at ranges less than 0.5 kilometers.
     If the enemy is any closer, you could be hit by pieces of wreckage.
        Your 20mm cannon has a large ammunition supply, bu the huge rate of
     fire means it goes quickly. Fire short bursts instead of long ones,
     especially against aircraft. "Hosing down" a target is extremely
     wasteful. If the shot is that difficult to achieve, you're crazy to
     waste ammo on it. In air combat cannon shots are usually very good or
     very bad, with very few intermediate cases.
        Notes: The historical gunsight requires conscious "retraining" to use
     well, since it doesn't require you to "place the sight on the target".
     However, this weakness is more than compensated for by the advantages of
     anticipation firing. The sight allows you to fire sooner, and more
     accurately, than any other sight in existence. The historial gunsight is
     the device of choice among "in the know" fighter jocks.
        The gunsight on this model uses a laser rangefinder slaved to the
     tracking camera, rather than the traditional ranging radar. This means
     you can use your gun without increasing your EMV.

     ========================================================================
                                Air-to-Air Duels
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Ambush

        The best way to start air-to-air combat is to surprise your opponent.
     Enemy aircraft have only forward-facing radars (except the Il-76
     "Mainstay" AEW&C craft). The best way to ambush an enemy plane is to
     slide up behind him.
        Traditionally fighter pilots prefer to attack from above. This gives
     them an energy advantage in any dogfight. However, missile tactics and
     the importance of secrecy make a height advantage less valuable for a
     stealth pilot. Gaining height makes you visible to enemy radar, which in
     turn will certainly warn your targets. Therefore, approaching low and
     from behind is often wiser. Only if your missile attacks fail and the
     enemy discovers you should you begin to seek an altitude advantage.
        If you're surprised or "bounced" (attacked from above) by the enemy,
     immediately
                                                                      - 91 -
     look for incoming missiles and take appropriate defensive action.
     Missiles arrive faster than aircraft, and therefore must be avoided
     first. Only then can you begin dogfighting or attempt to escape.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The Missile Exchange

        Often an air-to-air battle starts because the enemy has discovered
     you, and vectors fighters in your direction. The result, quite
     frequently, is a head-to-head face-off, you against him.
        In this western-style showdown each side starts with an exchange of
     long- to medium-ranged radar missiles. Be prepared to decoy, jam, and
     possibly chaff the "incoming". Once your radar missile is away, switch
     to an AIM-9M Sidewinder. You may get a second close-range missile shot
     if the AMRAAM fails. Scoring with a head-to-head cannon shot is much
     more difficult, and not worth the ammo unless either (a) you're out of
     missiles, or (b) you're an incredibly good marksman.
        Naturally, if you can get off a second missile shot, so can the enemy
     if he carries second-generation IR missiles (the AA-8 or AA-10 IR
     version). These nasties show up frequently on MiG-29s and Su-27s, but
     aren't unknown on other craft flown by Veteran or Elite pilots.
        The Early Turn: One of the most difficult, but most useful tactics in
     a head-to-head match is making an early turn. This is a maneuver where
     you make a tight 180o turn so that you come out of the turn already
     closing on the incoming MiG's tail. Against inexperienced pilots this
     trick is easy, since greenhorns usually keep boring in, hoping for a
     cannon shot, and only thinking about a turn after they've passed you.
     Against vets and better an early turn requires fine timing. If you turn
     more than a second or two ahead of the enemy you're just telegraphing
     your intentions. If you wait too long, you get no advantage at all.
                                                                      - 92 -
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Enemy Missiles

        Radar-Homing AAMs: The Russian AA-10 Alamo is a "fire and forget"
     missile just like your AIM-120 AMRAAM. All other Russian radar-guided
     weapons are semi-active homers. Here the launching aircarft must
     continue to "paint" you with its radar - the missile homes on the
     "paint".
        You avoid radar-homing AAMs just like SAMs (see Air-Ground Tactics,
     Defensive Tactics Against SAMs, earlier). That is, use reduced EMV, ECM
     jamming and ultimately chaff. Decoys can be very effective. Note that
     the MiG-25 and MiG-31 carry extremely long-ranged radar AAMs. Low EMV,
     ECM and decoy tactics are especially effective against these weapons.
        Consider yourself fortunate that none of the Iranian F-14s have
     operational Phoenix missiles. These long-range killers are especially
     difficult to evade.
        Infrared (IR) Homing AAMs: All IR homing AAMs are "fire and forget"
     weapons. Of these the AA-8 is the most dangerous because of its second
     generation IR seeker and great maneuverability. If enemy MiGs and
     Sukhois close to AA-8 range (8 kilometers) you're often in trouble.
        Techniques to evade IR AAMs are the same as those used against IR
     SAMs (see Air-Ground Tactics, Defensive Tactics Against SAMs, earlier).
     That is, use the IR jammer at long range, flares at short range. The
     decoy also works.
        In practice, many IR homers are fired at short ranges during a
     dogfight. This means that you've got to leap onto the IR jammer when you
     get a launch warning, then dodge out of the missile's 45o field of view
     immediately. At dogfighting ranges missile flight times are very short -
     you don't have time to fool around! If this fails, or you delay too
     long, the missile approach klaxon will go off. Now you've got bare
     seconds to react: dump a flare immediately and dodge, or you're history.
        One nice thing about IR AAMs is that the older AA-2, AA-6 and AA-7
     designs all use first generation seekers. The enemy must get on your
     tail before these missiles lock on. Keep him off your tail and you avoid
     this entire class of weaponry. Of course, doing that requires
     dogfighting skills.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Dogfighting

        The essential rule in dogfighting is to get on the enemy's tail. On
     all fighter aircraft, guns and missile guidance systems only face
     forward. If you're on the enemy's tail, you can shoot and he cannot. If
     you can't get on his tail, at least try to place his aircraft ahead of
     you as much as possible, so you have the maximum number of firing
     opportunities.
        Maintaining higher speed or altitude is valuable in a dogfight. A
     plane slower and lower can only dodge attacks. A plane faster or higher
     can attack or retreat as desired. Having a higher speed or altitude is
     termed the "energy advantage".
        If the enemy is behind you, there are various classic escape
     maneuvers: Turning Inside, the Scissors, the Immelmann, the Split-S, and
     the Yo-Yo. Not only should you learn them, but also learn to recognize
     these maneuvers so you can apply the appropriate counter-maneuver.
        Turning Inside: The simplest solution to an enemy plane coming up
                                                                      - 93 -
     behind you is - turn toward him (i.e., turn in the direction of the
     enemy aircraft). If you're turning faster than he, you'll gradually
     circle around and get onto his tail. This kind of a "turn match" is
     frequently seen when greenhorns dogfight.
        Of course, if the enemy is turning faster than you, he will
     eventually come around behind you. If this happens try something else
     immediately. The longer you wait the worse it gets, until he lines up a
     shot and toasts you.
        Scissors: A more complex way to out-turn an enemy aircraft is the
     scissors maneuver. Begin a turn toward him, but once he begins to turn
     with you, quickly roll over to turn in the other direction. This opens
     the scissors. As the enemy realizes you've turned away and turns toward
     you again, you reverse the procedure and roll back toward him again. If
     your turns were quicker and tighter than his, and/or you're a slower
     plane, he will eventually pass in front of you. This allows you to get
     onto his tail.
        Novice pilots trying to turn with you can be lured into a scissors
     with ease. Even if their planes turn better, their slow reactions to
     each scissor opening and closing will quickly give you the edge. More
     experienced enemies may avoid this tactic by anticipating your next turn
     and blasting you (if they're less maneuverable), or by pulling up and
     over in a yo-yo (if they're faster).
        Immelmann Turn: This maneuver is an excellent way to reverse
     direction quickly. First you perform a half loop to reverse direction,
     then a half roll to right your aircraft. If an enemy aircraft is behind
     you, an Immelmann can bring you nose-to-nose with him.
        The original Immelmann, a German WWI fighter pilot, reputedly rolled
     while vertical, allowing him to finish the loop in whatever direction he
     desired. He still finished the half-loop inverted - it's aerodynamically
     more efficient that way.
        Note that an Immelmann gives you an
                                                                      - 94 -
     altitude gain but costs speed, since a half-loop upward slows you down
     significantly.
        Split-S Turn: This maneuver complements the Immelmann. Begin by
     rolling inverted, then pull the stick back to half-loop downward. Many
     pilots begin the loop before the roll is completed, rolling the plane
     while looping. The split-S causes you to lose considerable altitude, so
     it's often wise to reduce throttle and/or use speed brakes to minimize
     altitude loss.
        The Split-S complements the Immelmann because you gain speed and lose
     altitude. Unwary fighter pilots have sometimes tried to Split-S into or
     away from the enemy without remembering their altitude. The result can
     be a Split-S right into the ground!
        Yo-Yo Turn: This maneuver is used mainly by higher speed jets against
     slower opponents. Therefore the relatively slow F-19 has little occasion
     to use it dogfighting. However, you may see enemy MiGs attempting it
     against you! This turn also requires excellent cockpit visibility,
     something that both the F-19 and early MiGs lack.
        In a Yo-Yo turn you climb and roll toward the enemy - until he's
     visible out the top of your canopy. Then pull over into a dive while
     still turning. During the dive you roll the plane to help line up your
     shot. Very often you'll take that shot while inverted. Don't let it
     bother you.
        Because a Yo-Yo requires good spacial perception, first practice it
     using the Slot View (if alone) or Tacti View (if you've got a target).
     In combat conditions switching to a wide angle view is extremely helpful
     in pulling the HUD around onto the enemy after you come over the top.
     Then you can switch back to normal view again.
        In effect a Yo-Yo plane makes a very big turn in three dimensions.
     Most of the turn radius is "consumed" with the climbing and diving,
     allowing a faster plane to travel further and turn wider, yet still come
     out on the tail of the more maneuverable plane. American F-4 Phantom
     pilots used the maneuver with great success against slower but more
     maneuverable MiG-21's over North Vietnam during the Vietnam war.
        Note that the best defense against a Yo-Yo is to

                                                                      - 95 -
     reverse your turn, or to use the third dimension yourself, usually by
     going into a split-S).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Enemy Guns

        The enemy has cannons equivalent to yours in range and power.
     However, the enemy still uses old predicting gunsights. This means they
     are virtually required to get behind you before they can make a decent
     shot. In addition, all but the most elite pilots will be slow to fire,
     since they must place the gunsight on the target and keep it there to
     score a hit.
        If you sense the enemy is behind you and ready to fire cannons,
     "jinking" (small violent moves in random directions) can throw off his
     aim.
        Finally, Russian-built aircraft with the older GSh-23 cannon may not
     always hit, since the lower volume of firepower increases the chances of
     you "flying between the shells" and escaping serious injury. Don't rely
     on this, though - not every 23mm shell is an unlucky one!
                                                                      - 96 -

        Rules of Engagement (ROE) outline what targets a pilot can and cannot
     attack. In an age of nuclear weapons unrestricted warfare would destroy
     the planet within 24 hours. Therefore, all wars are limited to some
     degree. If warfare is limited to just a local area with specific goals,
     ROEs are much more restrictive. If an official state of war does not
     exist then the rules will be extremely restrictive.
        In stealth missions, ROEs also determine what "exposure" of your
     aircraft is allowed. In cold and limited war situations it is important
     that the enemy not know exactly who or what performed the attack. This
     allows the politicians to say whatever they want.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Cold War Situations

        ROE: "You may attack and destroy a target only if it is specifically
     required by your mission orders. You may engage other targets only if
     they fire first, or if they have spotted your plane. The mission is
     completely clandestine. You must avoid detection, especially visual
     detection by enemy aircraft. Enemy air or ground forces that do detect
     your should be destroyed, to prevent embarassing disclosures. Neutrals
     and civilians must be considered friendlies, and above all you should
     avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars."
        Background Notes: In cold war situations the State Department must
     have "deniability" for every mission. If the mission is successful and
     the political climate seems good, the USA may claim credit for the deed.
     In other cases, however, American may not wish to attach its name to the
     action.
        You are warned when enemy radar returns are good enough to spot your
     craft, or when enemy aircraft come close enough to visually identify
     you. These enemies should be destroyed, although the effort can be
     counterproductive if the attack generates lots of additional sightings!
        Gratuitous or wanton destruction of all other targets is very bad in
     cold war. Hitting targets of value to the civilian sector, such as
     bridges, oil wells and tanks, refineries, etc., is especially bad. Your
     record will rapidly accumulate
                                                                      - 99 -
     black marks if you act like "Rambo" during the Cold War. After all,
     Rambo is fiction, this is reality!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Limited War Situations

        ROE: "You will engage, attack, and destroy all targets specifically
     required by your orders. In addition, all other targets with active
     weaponry (i.e., which could fire on your craft) may be attacked. You may
     engage these military targets even if they haven't seen you yet. You may
     never attack non-military targets unless so required by your orders.
     Neutrals must be considered friendlies at all times, and in addition you
     should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars at all costs."
        Background Notes: In limited war the State Department may require
     deniability, since American aid to the contestants may need to be secret.
     However, since there is a war, and military targets get destroyed in
     war, you can attack military targets of opportunity and be rewarded
     (rather than penalized) for your efforts. However, hitting non-combatant
     targets of value to the civilian sector (unless ordered to) is
     forbidden.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Conventional War Situations

        ROE: "You will engage, attack, and destroy all targets specifically
     required by your orders. In addition, any and all other targets in enemy
     territory may be attacked, including civilian targets. If able to select
     additional targets, select those with immediate military capability
     first. Neutrals must be considered friendlies at all times, and in
     addition you should avoid detection by neutral aircraft and radars at
     all costs.
        Background Notes: In a conventional war you are allowed unrestricted
     conventional attacks on enemy territory. This includes civilian targets
     formerly forbidden. However, targets with immediate military capability
     are more important. Therefore, destroying enemy aircraft, airbases,
     SAMs, radars, depots, headquarters, etc., gives more reward than
     bridges, oil refineries, oil wells and platforms, etc., whose importance
     is long-term. This is because even conventional wars are fought for
     short-term goals (such as the Grenada invasion in 1983, or the Falkland
     Islands campaign of 1984).
        However, from a pilot's point of view, conventional war is "fun"
     because anything in enemy territory is fair game. Of course, the
     disadvantage is that the enemy are prepared and alert for intruders.

     ========================================================================
     ONC Map Coordinates

        ONC maps use the standard US Army military grid system for locating
     positions anywhere on the globe.
        The maps are divided into large squares. Each square is identified by
     a two-letter code, such as WX, JC, etc. Within each square are smaller
     rows and columns, ruled into smaller squares. These smaller squares are
     identified by a column and row number from 0 to 9. Following the "read
     right and up" rule, the column number appears first, then the row
     number. This is the same as basic algebra, where the "x" horizontal
     value is given first, then the "y" vertical value.
        For example, coordinate JC79 means large map square JC, column 7,
     row 9.
                                                                     - 100 -

                                    Missions
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Air-Air Missions
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Selecting Armaments

        In limited or conventional war situations the AIM-120A AMRAAM is the
     missile of choice. You can lob these at the enemy from a full 30
     kilometers range. If you're firing at a plane with close escorts, space
     the shots 5 to 10 seconds apart (the higher their altitude, the longer
     the spacing). This is because a burning, exploding plane is a prominent
     target to the missile's seeker. If your missiles arrive right behind one
     another, those following may home on the plane hit by the first. Worse,
     the terminal homing of the AMRAAM is somewhat questionable - it tends to
     take the closest target at the time, rather than the target you
     originally designated! Therefore, when shooting into a group you can't
     count on which plane will be hit. Finally, if the enemy is veteran or
     elite, don't be surprised if the enemy manages to outmaneuver your
     missile by turning inside it.
        In cold war, guns are the weapons of choice. With these you can
     insure the proper target is hit, and no others. Unfortunately, getting
     close enough for a shot may reveal your presence. A good compromise is
     the AIM-9M Sidewinder, a fast-turning close-in dogfighting missile. It's
     usually easy to line up a 5 to 8 km shot, where the Sidewinder has a
     clear run at the target and nobody else is likely to get in the way.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ambushing a Leader

        Here an important personage is travelling by plane; your job is to
     make sure he doesn't arrive! The plane takes off about the same time as
     your own. Remember that his plane, your objective, is NOT the flashing
     dot on the satellite/radar map (on your left-side cockpit CRT).
        Although it's possible to just fly to his destination and wait,
     roving fighter patrols or local air defenses eventually will spot you.
     In general, the wiser approach is to find the best way to "sneak through"
     enemy patrols and SAM radars to intercept him EN ROUTE.
        In limited or conventional war you can take down his plane and escort
     with AMRAAMs. In a cold war situation you'll need to close for a clean
     Sidewinder or gun shot. Remember, though, that if the fighter escorts
     get a visual ID on your plane you must "zap" them too. If your attack
     location is well away from any ground radars or Mainstay AEW&C planes,
     you can attack from above, hit your man, drop a decoy to confuse them,
     and zoom away with maximum speed at low altitude (say 200').

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Intercepting Terrorists or Commandos

        In this mission you know a transport plane, accompanied by fighters,
     will head for friendly territory. Your objective is to eliminate them
     before they arrive. The problem is, you don't know their destination.
        As you take off, watch the enemy aircraft carefully. Circle around a
     bit,
                                                                     - 101 -
     observing their course until you can guess their objective. Once you
     know their goal, it's easy to pick a nice quiet spot to ambush them.
     Often you can stay in friendly territory all the way! Properly executed,
     this mission is a nice, easy milk run.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Eliminating a Fighter Patrol

        Enemy fighter patrols have a nasty habit of lurking near their own
     air defense systems, and/or being supported by Mainstay AEW&C planes.
     Going in after them can cause quite a battle.
        One trick to avoid this mess is to publicize your presence in a
     nearby area. You should pick an area with little or no SAM coverage, and
     with no nearby airbases. If you can lure the fighter patrol to you, at
     this spot, the battle may be much easier. The typical way to accomplish
     the lure is to raise your EMV (by flying high, turning on the ECM, and
     opening the bay doors). If that doesn't work, clobbering a thing or two
     on the ground may catch their interest.
        Once you've "dangled the lure", it's wise to take a low profile
     again, so you can ambush the enemy fighters as they arrive. As in many
     other aspects of modern warfare, getting the first shot is a big
     advantage.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Destroying a Recon Bomber

        In most cases you must chase an enemy plane on its way home. Catch
     and attack him as quickly as possible. The longer you delay, the closer
     he gets to SAM cover and fighter aid. This is one mission where climbing
     to a higher altitude can be rewarding - you travel faster, farther at
     high altitude than low. Of course, don't go so high that you wake up the
     enemy and attract lots of fighters and missiles.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Attacking a Cruise Missile

        These aircraft are most unobliging targets. They cruise around deep
     behind their own lines, guarded by SAMs and closely escorted by
     fighters. Given the defenses, attacking these planes is like hitting a
     ground target. You need to sneak or punch your way through defenses,
     elude counterattacks, and blast the primary, just like a strike mission.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Taking Down the Mainstay

        The Il-76 "Mainstay" AEW&C plane is the most difficult aircraft
     target. Sooner or later its radar will see you, forcing you to fight
     through fighters and SAMs to reach it. Make your approach as stealthy as
     possible: it postpones this hour of reckoning. Destroying one or two
     crucial SAM radar sites on your way in can be useful - it opens a
     radar-free corridor to the target, and at the same time may draw off
     enemy interceptors, perhaps even some of the Mainstay's fighter escort.

                                Strike Missions
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Choosing Your Weapons

        Selecting armaments for ground attacks is always difficult. The
     favorite weapon is the AGM-65D Maverick missile. It's your longest-
     ranged ground attack weapon (30 km; the Harpoon fires farther but is
     only good against warships). The Maverick's also an accurate "fire and
     forget" weapon. Its only
                                                                     - 102 -
     weakness is that one missile can't always do the job (see the Weapon
     Effectiveness Chart at the end of this doc - ratings below B- mean the
     missile may not destroy the target). Fortunately, Mavericks are just
     fine against radar installations. Most pilots carry as many as they can
     afford, and fear the day when the crew chief tells them no more are
     available.
        Choosing between laser-guided bombs, retarded bombs, and free-fall
     bombs is often a matter of personal preference. Many times more than one
     weapon will do the job, so you can pick a type whose attack run suits
     your style. Other times you may be forced to use a certain weapon
     because nothing else does the job right.
        When choosing weapons, don't expect much from a weapon rated C or D
     against a target. Scoring a hit with such always requires a lot of luck.
     Certainly don't rely on such to take out your primary target. Weapons
     rated A or B can be relied upon, provided you deliver them accurately.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Secret Airstrips

        Dropping off or picking up items deep behind enemy territory seems
     rather straightforward. After all, you don't have to fly into SAM
     batteries or go head-to-head with fighter patrols.
        Instead, a secret airstrip challenges your flying skill. You must
     manage a landing without an ILS to guide you. Worse, the strip is only
     half the length of a normal runway. You must land gently, at low speed
     (under 160 kts, preferably), and touchdown near the start. Otherwise
     you'll roll off the other end and crash! To make matters worse, the
     strip's lights are only on for a limited time. Make a note of the time
     the lights go off, then periodically check the Waypoints screen on the
     right-side CRT (tap SELECT WAY PT key) to see how much time you've
     got. Once the lights are out landing is virtually impossible.
        If your opponents are skillful, their intelligence may have dangerous
     information about this mission. You could find enemy fighter patrols
     uncomfortably close to your objective, or bouncing you just as you're
     trying to land!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Airdrops

        These missions are usually "milk runs". Your job is to avoid action
     and just fly over a radio beacon that's quite clear on your HUD. The
     only real worry is reaching the beacon before it is turned off. Make a
     note of the "turn off" time and periodically check the Waypoints screen
     on the right-side CRT (tap SELECT WAY PT key). Once the beacon turns off
     there's no way to find the drop site.
        Be warned that skillful opponents may have intelligence about this
     mission from their spies. You could find enemy fighter patrols lurking
     around the objective. If so, you could attempt to lure them away, or
     blow them away, depending on your ROE (rules of engagement).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Photo Recon Runs

        There are two hard things about photographic missions: using the
     camera, and keeping a low profile while you're doing it!
        Because the 135mm/IR camera is on a fixed mounting, you must steer
     the plane to aim the camera. This is more difficult than it seems, since
     the target swims into and out of view all too fast. Experienced pilots
     advise you to line up
                                                                     - 103 -
     on the target 8 to 10 km away. Set up a perfectly straight course and
     keep to it. At 2 km to 4 km hit the bay doors and brakes, then pull the
     nose gradually up, bringing the camera's aim onto the target. Keep in
     this regime, using subtle pitch changes to keep the target in the
     camera, while snapping pictures. You've got plenty of film: don't be
     afraid to take plenty of extras!
        Success is announced right on the CRT. As soon as you have it, close
     the doors and brakes, then dive low for your escape. Don't be surprised
     if the enemy spots you during the photo run.
        Photo runs over enemy troop concentrations and/or near SAMs are
     especially nerve-wracking. You may need to take out a SAM radar before
     making the run. If shoulder-fired SAMs infest the area, your only hope
     is to dump a decoy before you start, run your IR jammer as long as you
     can, and/or periodically dump flares.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Flying against SAMs

        Destroying a SAM battery requires that you "sneak up" on them as best
     you can, then nail his radar first with a Maverick or HARM. With the
     radar out of action, the missiles are helpless. Unless there are other
     SAMs nearby you can have a strafing "picnic" with the missile launchers
     until a fighter patrol shows up.
        Remember that the safest place around a SAM battery is directly above
     it. The radar cannot look straight up, and the longer-ranged missies
     (such as the SA-2, -5,-10 and -12) have a minimum range of 4 to 5 km. Of
     course, getting to this point can be rather tricky. It doesn't hurt to
     run over the litany of defense techniques before going after a SAM:
     disappearing, decoys, ECM, chaff and manuevering.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hitting the Sub Pens

        The Severomorsk submarine pens in the North Cape are a unique and
     special target. These must be attacked by toss bombing from the north:
     you must place an FAE THROUGH the sea doors. This means flying straight
     at the mountain, pulling up at the last minute. You may wish to make
     your run at 500' to 1,000', instead of 200'. This lets you begin the
     toss sooner (about 3 to 4 km away), giving you more leeway to clear the
     mountainside.
        Beware the Krivak-class frigates that patrol seaward of this
     submarine base. Their radars and SAMs cannot be ignored! You'll want to
     bring along a couple of Penguin-3 ASMs to eliminate these fellows. Even
     in Cold War, chances are good a Krivak will get a radar "make" on you,
     forcing you to hit him.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Sinking Ships

        The ideal ship-killer is the AGM-84A Harpoon. This heavy missile is
     your longest-ranged weapon. It has a superb targeting system that hits
     the ship you target, even a carrier with a ring of escorts.
        However, don't underestimate enemy warships, especially those of the
     Russian Northern Fleet. The larger ships have exceptionally good radars
     and very powerful SAMs. Patrol ships can be knocked out with a single
     missile, but a task force has so many ships that any close approach
     means you'll be dodging missiles left and right.
                                                                     - 104 -
        Most enemy ships stay close to friendly shorelines, with fighter
     cover nearby (if not overhead already). Don't forget that enemy
     aircraft carriers have their own fighters: you can count on a few
     flying CAP (combat air patrol).
        When fighting a conventional war with Libya, or in the Persian Gulf,
     be careful about attacking merchant ships. Avoid those on the high seas
     or near friendly coastlines; only attack ships close to enemy ports or
     shore. Otherwise, you could end up hitting a neutral ship by accident.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Bombing Runs

        When attacking with laser or free-fall bombs, you'll have to rise
     above minimum altitude during the attack run. This, combined with the
     open bay doors, raises your EMV considerably. Try to minimize this
     exposure as much as possible. Remember, the higher your EMV, the better
     target you are for enemy missiles. The longer you're a big target, the
     more chances the enemy has to launch and hit you.
        The most frightening prospect is a bombing run directly over enemy
     troop concentrations. There's nothing worse than a host of shoulder-
     fired SAMs rising up at you. These are on the one missile site you can't
     knock out. Fortunately, they have a very short range. Still, flying
     through a barrage of SA-14s, dumping a flare every two seconds, while
     trying to line up a bomb, will turn your hair prematurely white.
                                                                     - 105 -
                                     Libya
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Introduction

        Politics: Libya is ruled by Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhaffi, leader of the
     secret army organization that deposed the former king in 1969. The
     capital city is Tripoli and the nation's cjief source of wealth is oil
     sold to western nations.
        Military Forces: Rich by third world standards, Libya buys most of
     its armaments from the Soviet Union. Personnel are trained by Soviet
     military advisors, but national pride has prohibited (so far) any
     significant Soviet presence. Soviet advisors are not invited on combat
     operations.
        The Libyan Army has approximately 60000 men, the Navy has 53 ships
     and 6500 men, while the Air Force has about 530 planes, 30 combat
     helicopters, and 8500 men. A paramilitary "Pan-African Legion" of about
     10000 also exists.
        In addition, Libya has built and supported a variety of training
     camps for terrorist groups.
        Geography: Libya is a desert nation. Along the coast it has only one
     mountain region that is visually distinctive: the Jabal al Akbar to the
     east of Benghazi. These mountains greatly restrict the capabilities of
     Benghazi and Benina radars. Deep in the desert, east of Sabha, are the
     more desolate and isolated mountains of the Al Haruj al Aswad, while to
     the west are the great sand seas (ergs).

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Level of Conflict

        Cold War: At times Libya has been enthusiastic backer of
     international terrorist organizations. It provides funds, arms, military
     training, and base camp sites for a variety of Arab and other terrorist
     groups. America has already attacked tactical military targets in
     retaliation for Libya's role in numerous incidents of international
     terrorism in Europe and the Mediterranean.
        Limited War: The Libyan army has fought minor border clashes against
     Egypt to the east. Egypt is an American ally, and so far has proved
     considerably superior, militarily, to Libya. The Libyan army has also
     attempted an invasion of Chad to the south. After a protracted campaign
     against Chad and her ally France, Libyan supply lines through the Sahara
     desert were cut, forcing a Libyan retreat. Future limited wars between
     Libya and any of her neighbours are possible.
        Conventional War: In the even of NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict in the
     Mediterranean and/or Europe, Libya is expected to provide bases for
     Soviet aircraft and warships operating in the Mediterranean. These bases
     could become the westernmost outposts of Russian forces contesting the
     Mediterranean.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Friendly Bases

        Sigonella on Sicily (UD15): The USA maintains a military base at
     Trapani, on western Sicily, and the Sigonella military field in
     southeastern Sicily. The Sigonella runway is the main staging point for
     air attacks against the North African coast, especially Libya.
     Unfortunately, the flight distances are quite long. Using this base
     virtually requires that your F-19 carry extra fuel.
                                                                     - 106 -
        CV America at Sea (UD70): This 60000-ton "Kitty Hawk" class
     conventional aircraft carrier, designated CV66, often serves with the US
     6th fleet in the Mediterranean. It participated in the 1986 raids
     against Tripoli and Benghazi. The carrier is ideally positioned for
     launching and recovering strikes against Benghazi, the Gulf of Sirte, or
     targets deep in the Libyan desert. Here it cruises on a southerly course
     with its traditional ring of close escorts. The carrier remains well
     north of the Gulf of Sirte to avoid SSM attacks from enemy ships and
     aircraft. It is surrounded by escorts and regularly replenishes the CAP
     (combat air patrol) with F-18 launches.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Neutral Bases

        These airbases are in neutral territory. You should not use these
     bases unless specifically so ordered, or if you must make an emergency
     landing.
        Suda Bay on Crete (VD41): This airfield, near the city of Khania, is
     not an American base, although in years past it was a major NATO air
     and naval base. It has the advantage of being both closer and less
     public than equivalent airfields in Greece or Egypt.
        Halfar on Malta (UD13): This airfield is on the island of Malta. Once
     a critical strength position for the British Commonwealth in the
     Mediterranean, it is now a neutral port and sometime tourist haven.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Seeing the Sights in Libya

        Flying over Libya is a unique experience. It is a truly desert
     nation, a land of red and brown hardscrabble with patches of tan sand
     and gray boulder fields. Water is all underground, seeping to the
     surface in occasional patches of green oasis or mountain valley.
     Mountain ranges are low, undulating areas full of small hillocks and
     short peaks. From the air it's often hard to tell the difference between
     again roadways and the dark wadis (gullies) in the desert. But some
     works of man stand out, particularly the rust red of oil wells and
     pipelines, or the distinctive star-pattern of SAM batteries.

     Libya

        Tripoli (TC87): The capital city of Libya has a large military-
     civilian airbase at Idris, and is well protected by SAM batteries. Until
     recently these were long-range SA-5 Gammons, but there are indications
     that Russian military advisors may replace these with the formidable
     SA-12 Gladiator.
        Tripoli is also the site of a major army headquarters, various
     military depots, oil storage areas, and sometimes terrorist training
     camps. Missile boats often cruise off the coast.
        Sabha (UB17): This southern town is the main military base supporting
     Libya's southerly border expansion. It was the major depot for the Chad
     war, and is still extremely important to Libyan trans-Saharan ambitions.
     The most important military installations here are the large airbase and
     the SAM battery protecting it.
        Misratah (UC26) & Sirt (UC43): These two coastal towns are much
     smaller areas, with lower level military headquarters. The ports include
     oil storage tanks for refueling ships. Sirt is a secondary naval base,
     supporting missile boats that cruise the western side of the "Line of
     Death".
                                                                     - 107 -
        Ras Lanuf (UC82) & Port Brega (UC92): Ras Lanuf is Libya's largest
     and newest oil facility. The majority of all oil for export is stored
     here, and a large number of oil tankers are usually coming and going at
     all times. There is also a refinery, vast "farms" of oil tanks, and a
     major military headquarters. Port Brega is an older oil facility, still
     in operation despite the completion of Ras Lanuf.
        A number of SAM batteries are sited in this strategically vital area.
     In addition the Port Brega airfield, west of the town, serves both
     ports.
        Benghazi (VC16): This city is the site of Libya's second-largest
     military base, including the Benina airfield and powerful protective SAM
     batteries. The city itself is large, with a military headquarters and a
     few small oil storage facilites to serve the ancient port. Terrorist
     training camps are not uncommon in the hills to the west.
        Al Badya (VC37): This sleepy coastal town in the mountainous Jabal al
     Akbar has major military significance. It overlooks the narrow Ionian
     sea between Libya and Greece, making it an ideal site for anti-ship
     missiles. There is a small airstrip and SAM site as well.
        Oil Fields: The great oil fields of Libya are in the southeast,
     where literally thousands of wells pump crude from the ground, which is
     piped to Ras Lanuf and Port Brega. The great producing fields can be
     found near Raguba (UC90), Waha (VB18), Amal (VC30), Jalo Oasis (VC40),
     and Gialo (VB49). Most of the great fields have a few storage tanks on
     site, to hold crude temporarily until it can be piped to the port.
     However, the majority of storage tanks are at the ports, not here on the
     fields.
        Secret Bases: Western intelligence operatives in Libya are preparing
     two secret, hard-pack surfaces suitable for aircraft landings. One is
     at Al Mukhayli (ONC VC43), the other is on the edge of the great ergs,
     at Yafran (ONC TC93).
