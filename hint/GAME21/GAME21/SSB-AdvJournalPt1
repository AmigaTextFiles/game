How the Heroes Arrive...

The Miners haul the chest of gems to the edge of the well.  The iron-banded
boxes teeter a moment on the brink then tumble over and break the glassy 
surface with a splash.  The mayor steps forward, clad in worn armor, and 
raises his hands skyward, beseeching "Great Well of Knowledge, I call upon
you to bring us champions to defeat the evil that infests our mine."
  
The Sky grows dark and the ground rumbles.  The air is electric with eldrich
power.  With a crackle of light appear several figures, laying dazed and
naked upon the ground.  One of the miners moves cautiously to the nearest,
and shakes him, eliciting only an incoherent groan.  He looks up at the mayor
and asks, "You sure these folks are worth the entire treasury? They don't
seem too impressive to me.  Maybe you should have asked for armor and swords
and stuff too?"

The mayor frowns in concentration.  "The ways of the well are mysterious ...
it has always been reliable, but not predictable.  Our wish has summoned these
heroes bereft of equipment or sence.  We must take them back to town and give
them whatever help we can.  Only then can we hope for their aid."

  Page 2 of the Adventurer's Journal

The Dazed bodies are loaded into cards and they begin weaving their way
through a maze of collapsed buildings.  Suddenly streaks of fire light
the overcast sky and shoot toward the well.  Straggling miners rush up to
the carts yelling incoherently.  "Flames from the sky ... creatures attacked
and encircled the well ... teleporters shut down ... Fritz is dead!"

The carts bounce on more quickly util they pass through a gateway and pull
up at a large house.  The miners lift the still limp adventurers and take
them inside.  The mayor steps forward and states,  "Now we wait.  They
must recover from the shock.  We must trust that the well has provided
what we need."

  Page 3 of the Adventurer's Journal

To Play secret of the Silver blades you must have a party of adventurer
characters.  To build a party you must make characters of varying race
and class.  The characters have different attributes that will be indicated
by their ability scores.  The following sections will explain what you need
to know to create successful adventuring parties.

 The Player Races --

There are six races from which you may construct your player characters (PCs).
Each race has different talents and limitations.  Charts and tables in the
appendix at the back of the Journal summarize the abilites and class
limitations for the different races.  Non-human characters can also combine
character classes and may also have additional special abilities.

DWARVES are a cunning race of sturdy workers and craftsmen.  They are 
expecially resistant to magic and poison.  During combad, Dwarves receive
bonuses when attacking man-sized giant class creatures and are adept at
dodging the attacks of larger giant-class creatures.  Dwarves can be
fighters, thieves, and fighter-thieves.

ELVES are a tall, long-lived race.  They are nearly immune to sleep and
charm spells and are adept at finding hidden objects.  During combat, Elves
receive bonuses when attacking with swords and bows.  They cannot be raised
from the dead.  Elves can be fighters, magic-users, thieves, fighter/magic -
users, fighter/thieves, magic-user/thieves, and fighter/magic-user/thieves.

HALF-ELVES are hybrids with many of the virtues of both human and elves.
They are resistant to sleep and charm spells and are adept at finding
hidden objects.  Half Elves can be fighters, magic-users, clerics, thieves,
rangers, cleric/fighters, cleric/rangers, cleric/magic-users, fighter/magic-
users, fighter/thieves, magic-user/thieves, cleric/fighter/magic-users,
or fighter/magic-user/thives.

GNOMES are shorter and slimmer than their dwarf cousins.  They are especially
resistant to magic.  During combat, Gnomes receive bonuses when attacking
man-sized giant-class creatures and are adept at dodging the attacks of
larger giant-class creatures.  Gnomes can be fighters, thievs, and fighter/
thieves.

HALFLINGS are about half the size of a human, hence their name.  They are
especially resistant to magic and poison.  They can be fighters, thieves,
and fighter/thieves.

HUMANS are the most common player-race in the Forgotten Realms.  They suffer
no level racial limitations or ability modifiers.  Humans do have the
disability of shorter lifespans than the other races.  This may be a 
problem, especially if human characters have come from Curse of the Azure
Bonds or they have been subjected to many Haste Spells.  They can be
fighters, magic-users, clerics, thieves, rangers, palidins, and
Dual-Class Characters.


Ability Scores --

Every character has six randomly generated ability scores.  These scores fall
within the range determined by the race and class of the character (see the
range of ability scores by race table on page 47) for humans, that range
is from 3(low) to 18(high).
 
  Page 4 of the Adventurer's Journal

Depending on the character class, one ormore of these abilities will be
a prime requisite.  A prime requisite is an ability especially valuable to
a given class (strength for a figher, wistem for a cleric, Intelligence for
a Magic-User, Dexterity for a Thief, etc.). Characters receive bonus 
experience points when their prime requisite scores are at or above a
certain number ( 16 in most instances ).

Non-human characters may receive modifiers to the basic ability scores to
reflect differences between the races.  Dwarves, for instance, get a +1
constitution bonus and may have a maximum constitution of 19 instead of 18.
When a character is generated with the CREATE NEW CHARACTER command, all
racial modifiers are calculated automatically.
 
  ( Writer's Note -- Skipped the rest of page 4, wasn't important )

  Page 5 of the Adventurer's Journal

Experience Points (XP) ---
 Are a measure of what the character has learned on his adventurers. 
Characters receive XP for actions such as fighting monsters, finding treasures
and successfully completing quests.  See the Advancement Tables for each
class XP requirments.

Level ---
 Is a measure of a character's ability in his class.  As characters gain XP,
they may go up in levels.  Most new characters will begin the game at 8th
level except for magic-users which start at 9th level, and thieves which start
at 10th level.  Characters with racial level limits may start the game at
their maximum level if it less than the normal starting level.  When 
charactters have enough XP they can go to the hall and receive the
training required to increase in level.  Characters may only advance one
level at a time.  If a character has gained enough XP to go up two or more
levels since the last time he has trained, he will go up one level and lose
all XP in excess of one point below the next level.  Once Characters have
reached their maximum levels for this game, they should not train.

Hit Points (HP) ---
 Represent the amount of damage a character can take before he goes unconscious
or dies.  Characters gain HP every time they increase in level.  Bonuses
for high constitutions are calculated automatically.  When a character takes
enough damage that his HP reach 0, he is unconscious.  If the character's
HP drop to anything from -1 to -9, he will lose 1 HP per turn from
bleeding until he is bandaged or dies.  A character is dead if HP drops
to -10 HP or less.  When you view a character, his HP on the screen will be
displayed as less than 0.

   Page 6 of the Adventurer's Journal.

Character Classes ---
 A character must belong to at least one character class.  Non-human
characters can have more than once class at the same time.  Non-human 
characters with multiple classes have more playing options, but increase
in level slower because XP is divided evenly among all classes.

CLERICS have spells bestowed on them by their deity and can fight 
wearing armor and using crushing (no edged or pointed) weapons.  Clerics
must memorize their spells just as magic-users, but they do not use
grimoires (Spell Books).  When clerics gain a new spell level, they will
automatically be able to use any of the available spells for the new level.
The prime requisite for clerics is Wisdom.

FIGHTERS can fight with an armor or weapons, but they cannot cast magic-user
spells.  Fighters can have exceptional strength and gain additional HP
bonuses if they have a Constitution of 17+.  The prime requisite for fighters
is Strength.

RANGERS can fight with any armor or weapons.  Rangers can have exceptional
strength and gain additional HP bonuses if they have a constitution of
17+.  They do additional damage in combat when fighting giant-class 
creatures.  At 8th level rangers may begin to cast druid spells, at
9th level they gain magic-user spells.  Rangers must be of good alignment
and have ability scores of at least 13 in strength and intelligecne and at
least 14 in wisdom and constitution.  The prime requisites for rangers are
Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom.

PALIDINS can fight with any armor or weapons and cast a few clerical
spells once they reach 9th level.  Palidins can have exceptional strength
and gain additional HP bonuses if they have a constitution of 17+.
They are more resistant to spells and poison, can turn undead creatures
as if they were a cleric two levels below their current level and are
always surronded by the equivalent of a protection from Evil spell.
A palidin may heal two HP of damage per his level once a day.  A Palidin
may Cure Disease once a week at 1st-5th levels, twice a week at 6th-10th and
 
   Page 7 of the Adventurer's Journal

three times a week at 11th-15th level.  At 9th level palidins gain the ability
to cast clerical spells.  A palidin will not adventuer with any evil
characters.  Palidins must be of lawfull good alignment and have ability
scores of at least 9 in intelligince and wisdom, at least 12 in strength,
and at least 17 in charisma.  The prime requisites for palidins are
Strength and Wisdom.

MAGIC-USERS have powerful spells, but can use no armor and few weapons.
They can only memorize those spells available in their magical grimoires
(personal magic spell books) or use scrolls.  Magic-users may add new spells
to their grimoires whenever they go up in level or find scrolls with
spells of levels that they scribe.  The prime requisite for magic-users
is Intelligence.

THIEVES can fight with swords and slings and wear leather armor.  In combat
they do additionaly damage 'back stabbing' which is described in the
combat section.  Thieves also have special skills for opening locks and
removing traps.  High level thieves also have a chance of casting magic-user
spells from scrolls.  The prime requisite for thieves is Dexterity.

MULTI-CLASS are non-human characters who belong to two or more classes
at the same time.  The character's experience points are divided among each
of the classes, even after the character can no longer advance in one or
more of those classes.   The character's HP per level are average among the
classes.  The multi-class character gains all the benefits of all classes
reagard to weapons and equipment.

DUAL-CLASS are human characters who had one class for the first part
of their life, and then changed into a new class for the remainder.  Once
a character changes classes, he cannot advance in his old class.  Dual-class
characters do not gain HP and cannot use the abilites of the old class while
their new class level is less than or equal to the old class level.  Once
the character's level in his new class is gerater than the level in his
old class, he gains HP according to his new class and may use abilites from
both classes.  Human dual-class magic-users may not cast magic-user spells
while they are wearing armor.

ALIGNMENT - is the philosophy a character lives by.  Alignment can affect how
NPCs and some magic items in the game react to a character.

  Page 9 of the Adventurer's Journal.

PREPARATION TIPS -- ONce the party has been outfitted, encamp at the mayor's
house and ready your weapons, armor and shields.  Then ahve all spellcasters
memorize spells.  Finally, save the game before continuing.

  COMBAT --
 Combat occurs often during your adventuers.  Combat takes place on a tactical
map.  This map is a detailed 3-D view of the map terrain that they party was
in when combat began.  This map is overlaid with an invisible square grid.

As you move characters, you will notice that everything moves on the grid
from square to square.  Moving diagonally often costs more movement points
than moving horizontally or vertically.

INITIATIVE -- Each round of combat is divided into 10 segments.  Which
segment a character or monster acts in depends on his initiative number.  This
is a randomly generated number for each character and moster.  This random
number is generated at the beginning of each combat round and is modified
by dexterity bonuses or penalties and random factoers ( such as surprise) to
arrive at the initiative number.

COMPUTER CONTROL -- The computer controls the actions of monsters and NPCs.
The computer also controls any PCs set to computer control with the QUICK
command.  You may take control of PC characters during any combat round.

AC - A character or monster's difficulty to be hit is represented by his
Armor Class or AC.  THe lower the AC the harder it is to hit the target.
AC is based on the armor a character is wearing and any dexterity bonus.
Some Magic items, such as enchanted armor, will help a character's AC.

THAC0 -- The character's THAC0 represents his ability to hit enemies in
melee or with missle fire.  THAC0 stand for TO HIT ARMOR CLASS 0.  This
is the number a character must 'role' equal to or greater than to do
damage on at targent with an AC of 0.  The lower the THAC0 the better the
chance to hit the target.

Page 10 -

    NOTE: The regeneration of a random number is often referred to as a 
    "roll". In determining if an attack is successful, the roll is a random 
    number from 1 to 20.

An attack is successful if the random number is greater than or equal to the 
attackers THAC0 minus the target's AC. THAC0 may be modified by range, 
attacking from the rear, magic weapons, and magic spells among other things.

  Example:
  
  A fighter with a THAC0 of 15 attacking a monster with an AC of 3 would need 
  to roll:
 
  (THAC0 15) - (AC 3) = 12+
  
  But to hit a monster with an AC of -2 he would need to roll:

  (THAC0 15) - (AC -2) = 17+


DAMAGE

When a hit is scored, the attacker does damage. Damage is the range of HP loss 
the attacker inflicts when he hits an opponent in combat. Damage depends on 
the attackers strength and weapon type. The Damage each weapon can do is 
summarized in the Weapon List on page 54.

Some monsters take only partial or no damage from certain weapon types. Giant 
Slugs, for example, take no damage from blunt weapons (Maces etc..), while 
some of the other monsters only take damage from magical weapons.

SAVING THROWS

Whenever characters or monsters are poisoned, or attacked by most magic 
spells, such as FireBall or Lighting, the computer checks to see if they made 
their saving throw. A successful save means that the target had some innate 
immunity to the poison, or was not hit full-force by the spell. Generally, a 
successful save will mean that the target was unaffected or damaged that would 
have otherwise be taken is halved.

BACK STABBING

A thief will stab if he attacks a target from exactly opposite the first 
character to attack the target. The thief may not back stab if he has readied 
armor heavier than leather (Exception: Elfin Chain Mail). A back stab has a 
better chance of hitting and does additional damage.

MISSLE ATTACKS

A character may not attack an adjacet target with a missle weapon (Bow, Sling 
etc...). A character may attack an adjacent target with a thrown weapon (Axe, 
Club etc...). Bows can attack twice per turn. Thrown darts can attack three 
times per turn.

MULTIPLE ATTACKS

Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers attack more than once per combat round when 
they get to higher levels. The first bonus is three attacks every two rounds. 
Later, they attack twice each round. See the chart on page 49.

All of a charcters attacks are aimed against the first target. If the first 
target goes down with the first attack, aim any remaining attack at another 
target.

Page 11 -

MOVEMENT -

The number of squares a character can move is affected by the weight he's 
carrying, his strength, and the kind of armor he has readied. A character's 
movement range is displayed on the view screen and when moving during combat.

RUNNING AWAY

A character may flee from the battlefield if he can move faster than all 
enemies. A character may not move off the battlefield if he moves slower than 
any enemies. A character has a 50% chance to move off the battlefield if he can 
move as fast as the fastest enemy.

Exception - If a monster or character can reach the edge of the combat map 
without any of his opponents being able to see him, he may then flee 
successfully even though he may be slower than his opponents.

A Character that moves off the battlefield returns to the party after the 
fight is over. If the whole party flees it will not receive any XP for 
monsters killed before retreating.

AFTER COMBAT

If one or more characters survive on the battlefield at the end of combat, the 
bodies of the unconscious or dead party members stay with the party. If the 
entire party flees from combat, all unconscious or dead members are 
permanently lost. If all the party members are slain, go back to your last 
saved game and try again from that point.

COMBAT STRATEGIES

Throughout "Secret of the Silver Blades", your party engages a colorful 
collection of foes. At times, the party may elect to avoid a confrontation, 
choosing conversation or flight instead. More often, however, they must stand 
and fight.

To succeed in combat, a skilled player deploys his party well, casts effective 
spells before and during combat, maneuvers his characters into advantageous 
position, and attacks using his most powerful characters and weapons.

DEPLOYING THE PARTY

When a battle begins, your party is automatically positioned based on the 
existing order of the characters. Characters near the top of the order will be 
in front lines and volunerable to attack. To change the starting deployment, 
change the order from the Alter Menu while encamped. Shift the heavily-armored 
fighters up the list and the vulnerable magic-users and thieves towards the 
bottom of the list. Party order my not be changed while in combat.

When battle begins, your party may be placed in a bad position. If you wish to 
be defensive, move your characters to anchor your flanks on an obstacle such 
as a wall. Keep your magic-users behind the front line. Setting up behind a 
doorway that your enemies have to move through makes for a very strong 
defensive position.

Characters who are seriously Injured should be moved out of the front lines if 
possible. Be warned, If you move away from an adjacent enemy, he will get a 
free attack at your back. Back players have an improved chance to hit.
Page 13 -

A magic-user can also scribe spells from indentified scrolls if he is of high 
enough level to cast them. A magic-user must cast the Read magic spell in 
order to indentify the spells on the scroll. A spell disappears after it has 
been scribed or cast. Only magic-users (And high level theives) can cast 
magic-user spells from scrolls.

CLERICS

Clerical magic requires no spell books. All clerical spells of the apropriate 
level are always available to a cleric or high-level Paladin, the character 
needed only memorize them.

When a cleric finds a clerical scroll, he can use the spells directly from the 
scroll regardless of level. Paladins can never use clerical scrolls, even if 
they may cast the spell.

TIPS ON MAGIC SPELLS

Both Clerics and magic-users may cast spells which assist the party in combat. 
Preparatory spells just before a battle can protect and strenthen characters. 
During battle, your spells will damage your opponents and help your party.

Spells should be memorized as soon as possible after they are used. This is 
most likely to happen after combat. Encamp, have your spell-casters memorize 
spells and select REST to allow them to imprint the spells for later use.

NOTE: After resting, it is a good idea to save your game after every tough 
combat. You should have at least two seperate saved games at all times and 
alternate between them. This will allow you to  go back to a saved game before 
a fatal battle.

Page 14 -

MAGICAL TREASURES

As you travel about and encounter the monsters and puzzles that stand between 
you and finishing your various quests. You will also find magical items to 
help you on your way. Here are descriptions of some items that you may find. 
Not all of these items may be found in your adventure. You can find out if 
there is a magic item in a treasure by doing a DETECT Magic spell using the 
DETECT command. To find out specifically what an item is, you must take it to 
an armoury or finfd a shop and have it indentified. 
 
Some magic items are, in reality cursed and can do great harm. When a 
character readies a cursed item, a Remove Curse spell must be cast before the 
item can be dropped. Some magic items, such as wands or scrolls, may only be 
used by certain classes. Others may not work at all if certain other magic 
items are also in use.

WANDS

Wands are the traditional objects of enchantment. Wands generally will cast a 
set number of a given spell (10 FireBalls or 15 Magic Missles for nstance). 
Only experimentation or paying to have them indentified will tell what a wand 
does. The USE command allows a character to cast spells with a readied wand.

POTIONS

Potions are a common magical treasure, Potions may heal wounded characters, 
cause them to become hastened or invisible, or cause any number of other 
effects. The USE command will allow a character to drink a readied potion.

SCROLLS

Either clerical or from magic-users, these items may have spells that 
characters couldn't otherwise cast. A Magic-User may use SCRIBE to permanently 
transfer a scroll into his grimoire if the spell is of a level that he can 
memorize. Magic-Users and clerics can cast spells directly from scrolls with 
the USE command. High level theives may also attempt to cast

Page 15 -

magic-User spells from scolls. Scrolls disapear after they have been used or 
inscribed.

ENCHANTED ARMOR AND SHIELDS

Sometimes you may run across armor or shields that have been created by skilled 
craftsmen and then enchanted with protective spells. The power of magic of 
these items may vary a great deal. Enchanted armor has the great advantage of 
offering improved protection with less encumberance than the same type of 
mundane armor. To use these items merely ready them from the Items Menu.

ENCHANTED WEAPONS

Enchanted weapons come in many sizes, shapes and potencies. Sometimes a weapon 
will add between one and five or so to your THAC0 and damage. Other weapons 
may have other fantastic magical properties including extra bonuses against 
specific types of creatures. Once a magic weapon has been readied from the 
items menu, the character will have it for all combats.

ENCHANTED ADORNMENTS
  
racers, Necklaces, periapts, and especially rings are favorable objects for 
magical enchantment. These items may have any number of magical properties. 
Some items will help your AC, others may fire Magic Missles, or even be 
cursed. Once one of these items has been readied from the items menu, a 
character will automaticaly gain all effects. The exception to this rule is 
that certain magical necklaces require the USE command to work.

ENCHANTED CLOTHING

Wizards will sometimes cast enchantments on commonplace items of clothing such 
as gauntlets or clocks. A wide variety of these items are known to exist. To 
use these items ready them from the Items Menu.

Gauntlets Of Ogre Strength

When worn, these gauntlets will give a character the tremendous strength and 
combat bonuses of an ogre. To wear the gauntlets, ready them.

CREATURES OF THE FORGOTTON REALMS

The denizens of these regions are many and varied. Here is a list of monsters 
you may encounter in your adventures. Some of these creatures are extremely 
rare, and you may never cross paths with them at all.

Page 16 -

BASILISK

Description: Crocodile-like with a curved and pointed tail and nose.

Reptillian monsters whose very gaze can turn to stone any fleshy creature.

behind its schoulders. These beasts have the magical ability to displace their 
image about three feet from their actual body, making them an especially tricky
oppponent.

DRAGONS
   
These are some of the most powerful and dangerous of the monsters a party can 
encounter. The older and larger the dragon, the more damage it can do, and the 
harder it is to kill.

-RED DRAGON

Red dragons can exhale great spouts of flame or attack with their claws and 
fangs.

-WHITE DRAGONS

Unique dragons in their preference for cold climates, these evil beasts can 
attack with their freezing cold breath in addition to razor sharp claws and

GARGOYLE

Ferocious predators of a magical nature. Gargoyles are typically found amid 
ruins or dwelling in underground caverns.

Page 17 -

GIANTS

Giants vary greatly in power, intelligence and tastes. The following is a list 
of the types of giants you are likely to encounter.

-CLOUD GIANT

These members of the giant races conssider themselves to be above all others 
of the species, except storm giants, whom they view as equals.

-FIRE GIANT

Brutal and ruthless warriors, these giants resemble huge dwarves and have 
flaming red or orange hair and coal black skin.

-FROST GIANT

These giants have a reputation for crudeness and stupidity. While the 
reputation may be deserved, frost giants are crafty and skilled fighters.

-HILL GIANT

One of the smaller of the giant races, they are brutish hulks pocessing low 
intelligence and tremendous strength.

-STORM GIANT

The most noble and intelligent of the giant races. These giants are dangerous
