OK guys, its 2 in the morning, and I decided to do this for some
strange reason.. NOTE: I will not tell you exact directions,
that is impossible. You will have to walk around and find your own 
way through dungeons, etc....
     Also note that some events may be sequencial, that is that one
thing will only happen if you do something else first.. so bear
with my dox, and follow them... not the best solve, but good enough,
you have to be a spaz not to finish the game...
     The game has a lot of bugs; save a lot, then quit and backup
your saved games so if it screws up, you always have backups,
reload and start from there.. im SURE ive missed some stuff, so if
you have any problems, get a hold of me(or someone else) and ask..
my addresses are at the end of the solve.

ok DUDES, well this is going to be a real quicky solve.. I'm not
going to include much so here goes...

     To use the moon stone you start with, you have to talk to Lord
Brit. and say STONE to him and he will tell you how to use it.
     Im not too sure of all the stone uses (I didn't need them) but
here are the ones I know...
     If you use the stone and cast it a certain amount of distances
away from you, it will take you to different places... here are some
locations.
     1 N - Lord British's room
     1 E - forgot (not important)
     1 W - forgot (not important)
     1 S - shrine of diligence (gargoyle world)
     1 NW - shrine of control (gargoyle world)
     1 NE - shrine of passion (gargoyle world)
     1 SE - N of gargoyle town
     1 SW - in front of gates to Codex
     2 N - E of Briton
     2 NE - Jhelom
     2 E - Yew
     2 SE - NE of Minoc
     2 S - S of Trinsic
     2 SW - Skara Brae
     2 W - Magincia
     2 NW - Moonglow



     Levels are gained as follows:-
          1 - 0
          2 - 100
          3 - 200
          4 - 400
          5 - 800
          6 - 1600
          7 - 3200
          8 - 6400

Here are the three important places to buy scrolls for your
spell book.
     N of the Lycaeum
     N of Trinsic (island)
     NE of Cove

You should find all the spells that are necessary there.    

     NOTE: in your travels, if you come across a glass sword, KEEP
it dont use it, you will need ONE at the end of the game.


     When you start the game, after killing the gargoyles in LB
castle, talk to LB, whenever you want say HEAL and he will heal all
your party.. ask LB about the STONE, then talk to the mage and
fighter to either side of LB.
     Then you should go out of LB room and go to the corridor W
(through a door).. your room is the one S as you enter the corridor
(ther eis one door N and one S, yours in the one S).. go into the
room, search the chest and get all the crap from there, and pick up
the magic book from the table and let you guy have that (since he
has most spell points)... after equipping all your guys as best you
see leave... to open the drawbridge at the castle, unlock one of
the doors either side of the gate, and use the drawbridge thing to
open the drawbridge.  

     Ok, im not going to write a walk through, because that will be
stupid, but I'll tell you enough to finish the game with no problems.
     I found the best way to get experience points it to go take
the path outside LB castel and go S until you reach the 3 way..
make a left (W) and keep following the path, everyday, in the
afternoon-ish there will be a group of
fighters/swashbucklers/mongbats at the next 3 way junction you come
across. So you can just move a distance away from it, sleep and
keep checking the place, and they should keep returning, kill them
and take all their treasure you need and you get the XP rolling in.

     You must go around and get a whole load of people to join
you. Now I don't remember where who is exactly but, here are some...
At serpents hold there is Segallion (cool fighter) and Sentri (so-
so fighter).. there might be another person who will join you
around there.. there are a few people who will join you in Minoc,
one in Magincia (shitty one).. anyways, just walk around and find
as many people to make 8 in your party... make sure you get the 2
fighters I mentioned.. its good to get your party to max, because one
problem about this game is that you run out of places to carry
stuff, so you need more people (prefebaly stronger ones to carry
the shit for you).... there are plenty of people who will join you
just ask around.. JOIN is the magic word....

     Ok, easiest place to buy water transport is in Britain, a
little south of LB's castle... dont bother buying a ship (unless
you want to), I managed to finish the game with a skiff... buy a
skiff, and every time you exit it, get one of your characters to
pick it up and carry it around with you, they only cost around 30
gold..

     
     Hmmm, best armor is the ones in Trinsic, the magic ones, but
they are expensive, if you have extra cash, buy one of those...
Best weapons for your fighters and maybe yourself is a Halberd
(think you can get some at Serpents Hold)..  and for Iolo and
Shamino it is BEST to buy them both a magic bow (they KICK ass with
it).. not sure where the magic bows are sold so look around..

     Ok, lets get on with the important stuff now.... first, its
best to get all the moonstones and runes...

     Rune of compassion - ask Ariana in Britain (one of the bards).
     Rune of ?? - in Yew, go to the pub, and move the plant, its
                  under it. 
     Rune of Valor - you have to go to LB's castle, look around
                     the castle until you find a mouse, (make sure
                     you have some cheese, you can buy some just
                     south of Britain) talk to the mouse, ask it
                     to join you, go to Jhelom, go to the pub, and
                     SOLO mode the mouse and walk him in the mouse
                     hole to get the rune... get rid of the mouse
                     then by asking him to LEAVE
     Rune of ?? - go to Skara Brae, N of the town there is the
                  a chick, Quenton's daughter, open her chest and
                  take the Rune, NOTHING else..
     Rune of humility - go to new Magincia, talk to the head of the
                        town, and say CONOR.
     Rune of ?? - Go to Trinsic, and WOW!! its right there in front
                  of your eyes, take it.
     Rune of ?? - go to Moonglow, go to the pub, talk to one of the
                  guys drinking (the one with the tattoo on his
                  head) say to him KEYS, hell give you a key.. stay
                  in the pub, go through the arch to the N, there
                  is a door to the right of you, open it (or pick
                  the lock) and to the NW corner you can see a
                  secret door, move all the crap and open it, then
                  move some more crap until you can see the ladder
                  going down to the cellar in the corner... go down
                  walk around and search the skeletons in the wall
                  if you want to find some treasure... from the
                  ladder, go W until you see another ladder going
                  down.. look around the tombs until you see the
                  one with the note and flowers next to it, unlock
                  it using the key you got, search the bones and
                  get the rune. phew!
     Rune of ?? - go to Minoc (this ones a pain!) talk to 
                  the leader and ask him about the rune, go talk to
                  whoever he/she sends you to.. eventually you will
                  find out that you have to become a member of the
                  giuld first... you need a board... you can get
                  yew log from Yew, the guy who sells the log is 
                  not IN the town, but more to the W oustide 
                  somewhere, get the log, go back to Minoc, go 
                  outside Minoc, to the E, find the lumber jack,
                  him to cut your log, get the board, go and talk
                  to the chick who makes the whatever, make it, 
                  find the chick in Minoc who will teach you the 
                  stones song, and then go back and talk to the guy
                  with the rune and he'll give it to you.

That's it, not bad eh? anyway, once you have the runes, use my
moonstone positioning crap to teleport to the shrines... kill the
gargoyles there... use the appropriate rune for the shrine, (in
front of it), then the force field will disappear, then take the
moonstone from the top of the shrine... if you want to go up
levels, TALK to the shrine, and follow the instructions.
hmmm. here, if you want some treasure.. go to buckaneer's den (SW of
briton, W of new magincia, you MUST have a boat)... go to the pub,
go into the kitchen, look for the secret door on the north wall,
open it, go through and talk to the guy inside the house on the
other side... (if you can't open the door, you can't talk to him
through the window).. say GUILD... now.. go to LB's castle, go down
in the catacombs (REMEMBER ---- BEFORE YOU GO DOWN, YOU MUST HAVE
A PICKPOCKET SPELL)... keep going down, look for a house in the
caves, go in the house, wait until the thief falls asleep, cast a
pickpocket spell, take the belt.. go back to buccaneer's den, go to
the pub, talk to the guy sitting in the NW corner of the pub, ask
him about HAWKINS, TREASURE, MAP and crap like that....

Once you've done that crap.. I guess you want to look for the
treasure map.. here are where the pieces are:-
(NOTE... after talking to the guy about the treasure, I don't think
you need to find the map pieces, if you dont want to.. skip all
this crap and I'll tell you where the treasure is at the end of it..
if you want to play the game proper, then don't read my NOTE at the
end of the map locations....)

     1 in shipwreck (seach it) W of Serpants Hold on one of the islands
     1 in the dungeon SHAME which is SW of Briton, to get to it,
       you have to go way W of the map, and use a skiff to sail
       down the river into the lave which is surrounded by the 
       mountains on the map.. its there.
     1 in the Dungeon WRONG which is in the NE tip of the mountains
       which are on the other side of the sea W of minoc (note, you
       can also enter through COVETOUS which is directly S of
       Minoc, you have to get to it by skiff, its in the mountains.
       NOTE, in this dungeon, you will NEED a telekenises spell,
       when you come across the port cullis which is close and that
       you can see a level on the other side of if (on the second
       level of the dungeon) cast a telekenises spell on the lever
       to open the PC on the other side of the dungeon with the ladder.
     1 with the gypsies just S of Trinsic (or was it N..     
       thereabouts).. say MAP to the stupid gypsie, and say no
       to the price until he gets down to 50 gold and buy it.
     1 on dagger isle, which is the island N of Lyaceum, got the
       NE of the island, and go in the hermits house, move some
       of his furniture until you find the ladder, go down and get
       it.
     1 with mayor of Trinsic.. ok, talk to him, and say PIRATE, or 
       HAWKINS, and MAP...(note- this MIGHT not work.. if it DIDN'T
       then its a sequencial puzzle.. ONLY if this didn't work, go
       SW of Trinsic in the mountains and enter the dungeon
       DESTARD, walk around, going down until you eventually find
       the dragon eggs, get one, go back to Trinsic, talk to the
       chef at the pub, say MAP, then give him the egg, THEN the
       mayor should give you his map.. this is ONLY if the mayor 
       doesnt give it to you in the first place, because DESTARD is
       a TOUGH dungeon, you don't want to waste time down there)
     1 in Serpents hold.. you have to find a shield (in battle)
       one with a snake on it (i think they're called curved       
       heaters), also, find a gem, and one nugget of gold (you
       can find gold nuggets buy using a shovel and digging in
       dungeons with earth).. take these items, to the weapons
       store in serpents, talk to the guy, say SHIELD, hell make
       you a magic shield...  go to the pub in serpents hold, way
       E, talk to one woman there (don't know which) say MAP and shell
       trade you the map for the shield..
     1 in the deserts, you have to walk around until you find
       a hole in the desert, and fall down it in the ants nest.
       this is a real tough maze, walk around until you find it.
       its WAYY down.
     1 with the guy in buccaneers den. once you have 8, talk to him
       and hell give you the last piece.


NOTE--- if you want to go directly to the treasure... it is found
on the island DUE SOUTH of Magincia, when you get on it... go to
the centre(-ish) of the island.. find the place where the hydra is
standing (the big thing with long arms) kill it, and with a shovel
dig the only earth spot under him that isnt poinsoness or,  grassy.
when you do this, go down the hole, and g'luck in finding the
treasure..

Now would be a good time to make a balloon eh? E of serpents
hold, there is an island surrounded by mountains, go to the south
of it, and enter the castle, again use a telekenises spell to open
the gate... go to the other side of the bridge, move the wall
decoration around until you find the secret passage.. go through
the castle until you find stairs going down, go down and look for
a dead body, search it, and it has balloon plans on it.. take the
plans to a basket weaver in Minoc, say PLAN and she will build you
a basket, then go to new magincia, say PLAN to the silk weaver to
the N of the town, her name should be Charlotte or somethnig like
that. then just follow her instructions to make it.. buy some rope,
you can get a cauldron from the dungeon WRONG (dont worry, first
level).. and you dont need an anchor, so don't bother... hmmm...

In the pirate treasure you should have picked up the other half of
the tablet.. take it to Mariah in the Lycaem, show her, then go to
the Gargoyle world (take a skiff)... go to the sea, and sail
around.. you want to get to the exit of Hythloth to the gargoyle
worth.. it is found at 64 s and 72 e   (use sextant which you can
buy at lycaeum, to the NE of it, or cast locate spell)... NOTE once
you are at the dungeon entrance, there will be a small gargoyle
there DONT KILL HIM!!!!!! enter the dungeon... S (you DONT have to
go up or down levels).. talk to captain John.. get the scroll for
translation.. go out of the dungeon the same way you came in, use
the scroll to learn the language, talk to the little gragoyle
outside the dungeon (if hes not there, wait, hell be there around
noon).. ask him to join you, if you have too many people, dismiss
a lamer..  ask him FATHER and he will direct you to his fathers
house..  go there.. talk to him, write down his name (I forgot what
it was).. go to the gargoyle town.. go to the cheif's hut, NW of the
gargoyle museum place (which is all the way south of town) say
SURRENDER to him, and when he asks you why, mention the gargoyles
father's name. Accept the necklace he will give you... with the
necklace on you can talk to everyone with no probs (remember not to
talk to anyone before that).  ok, go to the healers hut, which it
NE of the chief's hut.. talk to the sick gargoyle ask him about
QUEST.. go all the way north until you reach the slabs and
crosses.. read the signs, go to the one that directs you to the
temple of singularity... use the balloon to get over the mountains.. 
enter the temple casting a couple of dispell fields.. talk to the
triangle in the center of the room... say QUEST, and it will tell
you to go to the shrines.. well at the top of this solve I have all
the mantras so you don't need to go (you might have to if its
sequencially done). talk to it again, and when it asks you for the
mantra, tell it... it will then ask you a question.. the answer
is.....   ALL   wow... isn't that nice.. now, you can go to the
codex using the moonstone, look at it.. go back to gargoyle world..
go to the seer (NE of museum , due E of chief) talk to him say
SACRIFICE, ask him about sacrifice of things, go read the book of
rituals as he tells you (in gargoyle museum), then take the broken
lens from the museum, go back to the seer, then he'll tell you to go
to the lens make in the gargoyle world.. go to him (NE of seer)
he'll fix the lens.. go back to human world, to moonglow (using the
stone) go to lycaeum, go NE to the human lens maker, ask him to
make the lens, he will want a glass sword (you should have saved
one from before).. then you just need one more object... go towards
minoc.. get your skiff out, sail directly south of minoc into the
little pass into the mountains.. find the big cyclops, talk to the
mail and ask him for KEY, go fish for him, give him the fish, get
the key, go down in his cellar (note if you get stuck here, there
is a secret door on the top level between the four ladders) go
down, find the cube of vortex... go back to the codex, and follow
what the book does, and THE END!!!!
