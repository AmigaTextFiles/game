                              Game: German Dice


    I originally wrote this game on the Spectrum when my kids were  small.
    It  is  based on a Dice game played in the small bars around Frankfurt
    when I lived there in the early 70's. It's a simple  enough  game  for
    any  age. The idea is to be first to score 10000 points by saving dice
    and rethrowing the remainder After each throw you can save  the  score
    or  gamble on another throw. If you fail with the gamble then you lose
    the score for that turn. Don't be too greedy! Full playing details are
    on  the  menu  screen  under  "Help". It can be played with up to four
    players any number being computer controlled.

    I wrote it  using  Amos  Pro(AF  Coverdisc),Octamed  V(AF  Coverdisc),
    Dpaint  IV,  PPaint  6.4(AF  Coverdisc)  and  Malcolm Lavery's pour on
    routine  from  an  Amos  routines  disc.  It  has  gone  through  many
    incarnations as I have learnt more about Amos Pro programming.

    I  had  to  finish  work  2 years ago through illness, (see below) and
    replaced my Speccy with an Amiga 600. As soon  as  I  saw  a  1200  in
    action  my  600 was out. I now run a A1200 with 2m Chip & 4m Fastram &
    FPU. I have an internal 2.5 inch 420M Harddrive & external Toshiba  x2
    CD-Rom with classic SCSI controller. My printer is a Citizen ABC.

    The  game  will boot from floppy or double click on the icon from Hard
    Drive. I've only tested it on my 1200 but if you  can  load  Amos  Pro
    then you can run German Dice.

    The  object of the game is to score 10000 points by throwing the dice.
    After each throw you must save at least one dice. This increases  your
    Temp  Score. If you have no legal throw then this is a Wipeout and the
    next player has his turn.

    If you manage to save all the dice then you have Blitz and must  throw
    all  the  dice again. After each save you will be asked if you want to
    Twist or Stick. If you Stick your Temp score is added  to  your  Total
    Score but if you Wipeout then you lose the Temp Score.

    The scoring is as follows:-

    Except for 1, throw 3 of a kind and score value x 100.
                        4 of a kind scores value x 1000.
    Save 3 of a kind and 1 more on the next throw will increase your
    score to the 4 of a kind rate.

               Any 5 scores 50 points.
               Any 1 scores 100 points but
               Treble 1 is worth 1000
               Quad 1 is 10000 - Game Over!!

               Blitz Bonus increases every throw

    Select the dice you wish to save by clicking on any dice  on  the  top
    row inside a white box.

    When  you are happy, click on the OK box. The computer will then check
    your move is valid If not you try again. If move OK then dice selected
    will  move to the bottom Saved row. When asked to Stick or Twist click
    left button to stick or right button to twist. The game is for up to 4
    players  any or all can be played by the computer. Click on the bar to
    select your choice.
