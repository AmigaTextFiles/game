   Dear Users,

   this new version of ArtEffect now features  a  full-fledged  ARexx  port
   that allows you to automatize frequently performed tasks.

   This  manual  assumes  that  you are proficient in the operation of your
   Amiga and know at least the basics about programming in ARexx.

   Please note that at times it is very hard  to  accurately  describe  the
   effect  of  a certain command - if you are not sure what a given command
   does, just try it with different parmameters  or  take  a  look  at  the
   supplied example scripts.

   Here  is  a complete list and a short description of every ARexx-command
   ArtEffect offers. The commands are sorted by their internal numbers, but
   you can find an alphabetical list in the index.

   Parameters Template

   FROMPICTURE=FP/S, ELLIPTIC=EL/S, RECTANGULAR=REC/S,  SIZE/K/N,  PROP/K/N
   ANGLE/K/N

   Parameters

   FROMPICTURE=FP/S

   uses  the  current  picture  as an image-brush, all other parameters are
   then ignored.

   ELLIPTIC=EL/S

   generates an elliptic brush, EL and REC are mutually exclusive.

   RECTANGULAR=REC/S

   generates a rectangular brush, EL and REC are mutually exclusive.

   SIZE/K/N

   the size for the brush.

   PROP/K/N

   the aspect ratio of the brush.

   ANGLE/K/N

   the angle of the brush.

   Hinweis:

   the effects caused by this command are identical  to  those  achvievalbe
   through the appropriate controls of the brushmanager.

   Example

   CREATEBRUSH EL SIZE 100 PROP 50 ANGLE 45

   Creates an elliptic brush that has a size of 100, is twice as high as it
   is wide and is angled 45 degrees.

   OPTION/A

   Determines which Parameter is changed:

   INTENSITY

   DENSITY

   ROUGHNESS

   ENTRIES/F/A

   A  field of 128 entries that must be separated by commas - these entries
   determine the shape of  the  curve  for  the  selected  parameter.  This
   command  is  best  understood by looking at the changes it causes in the
   brush-editor. As entering 128 values by hand is quite a task, you should
   generate  the field through an ARexx-function - see the supplied scripts
   for an example.

   should be stored - the first (upper left) register has the number zero .

   BACKGROUND=BG/S

   the background color is changed instead of the foreground color.

   Examples:

   SETCOLOR R 255 G 0 B 0

   Sets the foreground color to "red".

   SETCOLOR R 0 G 255 B 0 REG 11 BG

   GRADIENT

   Fill-options

   Everytime  a  command  allows  GRADIENT as a Parameter, GRADIENT must be
   followed by a list of parameters:

   (linear|radial),(rgb|hsb|alpha),steps,roughness:(x1,x2,y1,y2|mx,my,r)

   what each parameter means:

   linear selects a linear gradient

   radial selects a radial gradient


   rgb selects an RGB-Gradient

   hsb selects an HSB-Gradient

   alpha selects a stencil-gradient (alpha-channel)


   steps selects the amount of steps for the gradient

   roughness selects the roughness of the gradient

   x1,y1,x2,y2 start- and endcoordinates of the gradient-line  (for  linear
   gradients).  before reaching the x1,y1-coordinates, only the first color
   of the gradient will be used, after reaching x2,y2 only the last color.

   mx,my are the X- and Y-coordinates for the center, r is  the  radius  of
   the gradient circle.

   It  is  very  hard to describe what effects can be achieved - we suggest
   that  you   try   different   sizes   and/or   angles   while   manually
   gradient-filling areas of the picture, so that you get a feeling for the
   parameters.

   GRADIENT will use the range that has been previously defined by the user
   or by use of the PALETTE PALETTE} command.
