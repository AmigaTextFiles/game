    Changes and additions of version 2.0

    Dear Users,

    this AmigaGuide-file  contains  all  changes  and  additions  made  to
    ArtEffect since version 1.1.

    Before you proceed, please read this note

    Most  likely  you  will  not  notice  the  biggest change - the entire
    program that was originally developed with SAS/C and made use  of  the
    bgui.library   has   now   been   completely   converted  to  our  own
    StormC-Compiler and relies on StormWizard for its GUI:

    However, you as a user will be more interested in the "real" additions
    and changes made:

    If  you'd  like a little more information on each topic without having
    to read each section, go here" link content} for a  short  description
    of all new and changed features.

     ARexx           through the addition of ARexx, ArtEffect
                  has become even more flexible and powerful.

     Transparent Background    When you generate a new project, the
                   background may now be transparent, too

     Arithmetic Operations     "1+1", "3*5", etc. are now valid entries
                   in integer-gadgets

     Copy/Paste          The Copy and Paste items from the
                   Edit -Menu now affect the current brush .

     content "Overview"
     Additions:

    With the introduction of layers we place in your hands a very powerful
    tool  to  work  on several parts of a picture without risking to loose
    vital parts of it.

    ArtEffect now features a dedicated Eraser.

    Every project-window now has its own PopUp-Menu.

    Furthermore  we  have  equipped  ArtEffect  with  a  complete  virtual
    memory-manager  thus  eliminating the need for VMem or other 3rd party
    virtual memory handlers.

    As a direct result ArtEffect now  also  offers  multiple  undo/redo  -
    there  is  no  longer the danger of completely destroying a project by
    making more than one accidental change to it.

    Last but not least we also generated  a  couple  of  new  plugins  for
    ArtEffect.


     Changes:

    The space in the Toolbox that was formerly occupied by the trashcan is
    now  taken  by  the  REDO-icon.  Also,  we  added two new icons to the
    toolbox.

    Due to the increased number  of  prefs-options  we  have  changed  the
    preferences a little bit.

    For  all  those  of you who have always enjoyed fingerpainting we have
    made the airbrush-modes Smudge/Fingerpaint a tool in its own right  an
    gave it an icon in the toolbox.

    In  the  process of converting the program to StormC, a few menu items
    have become temporarily unavailable.

    The Lighten and Darken modes now work slightly different.

    You can use arithmetic operations into  integer-gadgets:  1+1,  2*3+4,
    etc. are all valid entries.

    When  generating  a  new  project  you  can  now  choose a transparent
    background.

    The menu-items Copy and Paste in the Edit -menu no longer  affect  the
    current project but the current brush .

    Finally,  the  Blur  -plugin has been moved from the Pixelate -submenu
    into the Blur -submenu.

    LAYERS "Layers"

    What are layers?

    Layers are several "planes" you can split your  project  into  -  just
    imagine  painting on several transparent films that are then placed on
    top of each other.

    You could, for example, paint the  background  of  a  picture  on  one
    layer,  the sky on the second, and the foreground on the third one. No
    changes made to a particular layer will affect any of the others.

    How do I work with layers?

    By default, every document consists of one layer called  "Background".
    If  you  open the Layers-Requester you can add layers to your project,
    delete them, rename them, set their opacity, and  decide  whether  you
    want  them  displayed  at  all. You can access the Layers-Requester by
    choosing Layers from the Windows -Menu or by pressing F6 . The maximum
    amount of layers available is three .

    In this requester you can see a list of all layers currently available
    in your project with the active layer being highlighted in a different
    color. Each entry in the list has three parts:

     The area to the left (with the lightbulb in it) allows you to switch
    the layer on and off - just toggle-switch the bulb by clicking on it.

     to the right of that there is a small preview of the layer

      and  to the far right you can see a big area that contains the name
    of the layer

    The order of the layers in the list equals their order in your project
    -  this  means  the topmost layer will be completely visible with only
    its transparent areas letting the layers below show through.

    Arranging layers

    By simply dragging and dropping the layers up and down in the list you
    can  put  them  in  any  order you want. While using a white-and-black
    dashed line shows you where the layer will end up. In case  you  don't
    know  what  means  - just click left on the layer to move and keep the
    left button pressed, move the mouse to the desired position  and  then
    let  go  of  the  button.  (  Note  :  if  you chose a non-transparent
    background for your  project,  the  background-layer  will  completely
    cover  all  layers  below  it.  You could then use the eraser to punch
    holes into this layer in order to let the other ones show through.)

    Combining Layers

    If your project contains two  layers  that  you  don't  need  to  edit
    separately  anymore,  you can combine those two layers into one. First
    of all, make sure these layers are next to each other in  the  list  -
    then  either  one  of them on top of the other - they will be combined
    into one layer.

     Setting layer opacity

    At the very top  of  the  layers-requester  there  is  a  slider  that
    controls  the  current  layers's  opacity. The higher the value set by
    this slider, the less transparent the layer will be.

    Naming layers

    Directly below the slider you'll find a string-gadget which allows you
    to change the name of the current layer.

    Creating/deleting layers

    Finally,  at  the very bottom of the Requester, you'll find buttons to
    create and delete layers. If your project has  only  one  layer,  this
    layer   can  not  be  deleted.  If  this  last  layer  still  contains
    transparency information, this information  will  be  deleted  if  you
    apply the Delete button.

    Saving Layers

    Please  note  that  pictures  containg more than one layer can only be
    saved in IFF (ArtEffect  will  generate  a  separate  chunk  for  each
    layer).  The  Save-Requester also gives you the options flatten Layers
    which will combine all layers into one  (not  recommended  unless  you
    don't  need to edit the separately anymore) and include alpha channels
    which will preserve all transparency information.

    Important Note

    When used with anything else than the cloner, the impressionist  -mode
    only sees one layer - this leads to very strange effects if applied to
    layers that contain transparent areas.

     ERASE "Radierer"

     The eraser

    The eraser is located in the toolbox directly below the airbrush.

    The function of the eraser varies: if you  only  use  one  layer,  the
    eraser  will  always  paint with the current background color while it
    will completely remove all color  if  you  use  several  layers,  thus
    allowing  lower  layers  to shine through. Erasing on the lowest layer
    will cause the chessboard-pattern of the window-background to appear.

    In the prefs-window for the eraser you will find the usual slider  for
    the  strength  and  the  "pressure"  switch.  Aditionally, there is an
    "Erase Image" gadget which takes the function the trashcan-icon in the
    toolbox  used  to  have.  You can also achieve this by clicking on the
    eraser-icon with the shift-key held down. Either way, if you have more
    than one layer in your project, only the current layer will be erased.

    winpop "Window-PopUp"

    The popup-menu in the project window

    If  you have already taken a look at ArtEffect 2.0 before reading this
    manual, you will probably have noticed  the  new  gadget  in  the  top
    left-hand corner of every project-window.

    Using this gadget opens a popup-menu.

    This menu has five items:

      mark  as  Source  - has the same effect as clicking on the top left
    corner of the window with the left ALT-key pressed.

     mark as Destination - has the same effect as  clicking  on  the  top
    right corner of the window with the right ALT-key pressed.

     Pixel

     cm

     Inch

    The  last three items allow you to select the unit of measurement used
    for the project's ruler. Please note that this replaces the  menu-item
    Settings/Ruler .


    virtmem "Virtual Memory"

    Virtual Memory

    You probably know already: Working with computer-based graphics  takes
    lots and lots of memory and you can never have enough of it...

    Granted,  the  prices  for  RAM have been quite low for a considerable
    amount of time, but not everybody is willing or able to get another 32
    MByte-SIMM  for his computer. Therefore some smart person came up with
    the idea to use the computer's harddrive  as  a  (slow,  but  big  and
    cheap) RAM-expansion.

    Programs  for  providing  and managing virtual mem have been around on
    the Amiga for a good while now, but those are often difficult  to  set
    up and/or use.

    For  this  reason,  the  current version of ArtEffect features its own
    built-in virtual memory handler -  some  of  the  new  functions  even
    require the use of virtual memory: without VMem you cannot make use of
    layers" link layers} and there is no unlimited undo/redo" link undo}.

    As long as you are not extremely low on harddisk-space, we suggest you
    give  ArtEffect  a generous amount of virtual memory to use - about 32
    MB (or more) are ideal for most tasks.

    In the VMem -area of the program-settings" link newprefs} you can  set
    the  size  and  location  of  the swapfile that serves as your virtual
    memory.

    undo

    Multiple Undo/Redo-steps

    One disadvantage of many graphicsprograms is the lack of undo-buffers.
    Most  of  the  programs  (including older versions of ArtEffect) would
    only allow you one step of undo, making  it  virtually  impossible  to
    revert more than one false step without loosing hours of work.

    ArtEffect  2.0 allows you to save as many undo-steps as your (virtual)
    memory permits - this means you can actually click yourself "backwards
    in  time"  by  repeatedly  applying  undo until you reach a stage when
    everything still was to your liking.

    If you have gone back one or more steps too  far,  you  can  redo  any
    number of steps to finally end up where you want to.

    If  for  example  you  have  undone  10  steps  and  then  come to the
    conclusion that you liked the situation better before  undoing  those,
    you can simply use redo 10 times to get back where you came from.

    If you are low on RAM and/or HD-space, you can set a maximum number of
    undo-steps to save in the Other -area of the program-settings.

    Furthermore,  UNDO  can  now  take  back  all  operations,   including
    Imagesize/Canvassize/Crop .

    plugins "New plugins"

    Description of new plugins


    The following blur -filters have been added:.

    Radial Blur

    Generates a circular blur-effect around the middle of the picture. You
    can  control  the  strenght  of  the  effect  with  the  slider or the
    integer-gadget.


    Zoom Blur

    Generates  a  blur-effect  very  similar  to the distortions generated
    towards the rim of a strong magnifying-lens. Again, the  strength  can
    be controlled through the slider or the integer-gadget.


    Motion Blur

    This filter generates the popular effect of an object that moves  very
    quickly  past a camera. The sliders control the speed and angle of the
    simulated movement while the two radio-buttons determine  whether  the
    movement occurs at constant speed or is accelerated.


    Note the Blur -Plugin has been moved from the Pixelate-submenu to  the
    blur-submenu.


    These plugins have been added to the Other -submenu:


    Make Tile

    This  plugin  generates a tile out of a picture by generating a smooth
    transition between the left and right as well as the  top  and  bottom
    edge. Tiles generated in this way can be seamlessy placed next to each
    other using the Tile-plugin. aneinandergereiht werden.

    The strenght-slider determines how many pixels of each edge are  taken
    into  account  for  making  the transition - the higher the value, the
    better the result.

    Tiles that are generated this way are ideal for  use  as  textures  in
    raytracing programs or as background-pictures for WWW-pages

    Tile

    This plugin completey fills the active project with the current brush.
    It is ideally used with a brush that was generated by  the  Make  Tile
    -plugin - to do this, use Make Tile on a picture then use "Pic->" from
    the   brush-manager   and   finally   use   Tile   in   the    desired
    destination-project.

    EMERGENCY "Emergency Exit"

    The "Emergency Exit"

    To  keep  crashes from happening, ArtEffect now monitors the condition
    of several parts of this program, automatically terminating itself  if
    everything  is  not  well,  but allowing the user to save all his work
    before doing so.

    If this case ever occurs, ArtEffect will mostly output the  number  of
    an  "internal  error"  -  please  note  down the number and send it to
    Haage&Partner along with a detailed description of the  steps  leading
    to  it,  we  will  then  try and remedy this in future releases of the
    program.

    newprefs "Changes made to the preferences"

    Changes made to the preferences

    The four tabs in the prefs-window now have  the  following  names  and
    functions:


    Screen

    This section has remained unchanged

    VMem

    Here you can set everything concerning virtual memory

    In the upper area you can select how much RAM ArtEffect is supposed to
    leave free for use by other programs and how much RAM it is allowed to
    use.

    In the lower area you can specify a pathname  and  the  size  for  the
    swapfile.

    Priorities

    With  the  upper  slider you can specify a task-priority for ArtEffect
    and its plugins when you are  actively  using  it.  The  lower  slider
    allows  you  to set a priority for the occasions when ArtEffect has do
    do  time-intensive  calculations  in  the  background  (such  as   the
    twirl-effect).  The  Plugins  will  always have a priority that is one
    lower than ArtEffect's  thus  keeping  your  machine  usable  even  if
    ArtEffect has to some heavy calculations.

    Other

    In the upper area you can control how ArtEffect frees  undo-memory  if
    your (virtual) memory starts to run low:

     oldest : the oldest undo-step of the active project is freed

     all oldest : the oldest undo-step of all projects is freed

     other : only undo-steps of non-active projects are freed

    Please  be aware, that this only controls the desired behaviour - even
    if you chose other ,  ArtEffect  will  delete  Undo-Buffers  from  the
    current project as soon as there aren't any left in other projects.

    The  slider  below controls the maximum number of undo steps to save -
    if you move this slider all the way to the right this means "unlimited
    undo/redo".

    In  the  lower  half  you  will find a slider to control the number of
    available colors (formerly located in the "Other  1"  section  of  the
    prefs).

    Below  the  slider there is a checkmark to toggle the One picture path
    option that used to reside in Other 2 .

    In addition to  the  program  settings  -requester  there  also  is  a
    settings-requester.

    In  this  requester  you  will  find  the  options for Brush display ,
    Anti-Alias , Snap windows , auto Preview  ,  Auto.  activation  ,  and
    Stencil  color  ,  all  of which used to be in the Other 1 and Other 2
    sections of the program settings.

    SMUDGE "Smudge/Fingerpaint"

    The Smudge/Fingerpaint-tool provides these two paint-modes  that  were
    part of the airbrush in earlier version as separate tools in their own
    right.

    The behaviour of the tool is toggled with the  Fingerpaint  -checkmark
    in the tool-settings:

    No checkmark - the tool acts as "Smudge"

    checkmark - the tool acts as "Fingerpaint"

    The actual function of the tools is still identical to the description
    provided in the printed manual.

    menugone "Removed menu-items"

    These menu itmes are not available anymore:


    - Window/Create Workspace
    - Window/write back Workspace

    - Settings/Crosshair

    The  item  Settings/Ruler  has  been  rendered  obsolete  through  the
    introduction of the window-popup" link winpop}.

    Lighten/Darken

    The function of these paint-modes has been slightly changed:

    Lighten  only  lightens  up to the current pencolor, while Darken only
    darkens down to the currecnt background-color.

    Using a  white  foreground  and  a  black  background  reproduces  the
    behaviour you are used to from earlier versions.

    "Note"

    To  make this manual even better we have included links to graphics in
    several places - these graphics  are  there  to  help  you  understand
    certain  functions of the program better and are displayed through the
    "Multiview" program.

    For this reason, Multiview should be located  in  your  SYS:Utilities/
    drawer, wehre it is very likely to be unless you run a very customized
    workbench.

    Because these graphics are displayed in a separate window, the  manual
    should  be opened on the workbench screen, so that the text and images
    can be viewed at the same time.

    If this manual does open on its own screen,  just  de-select  the  Use
    separate screen item from the Window -menu.
