    ======================================================================

    Welcome to Spin Brix, and thanx  for  taking  the  time  to  read  the
    instructions.

    Well  you've  no  doubt  played the game by now. OK so it's no Genetic
    Species but it did take several months (6 to be exact) to complete and
    a large amount of work and coke (& various substances for benny 8*]).

    Story
    -----

    Don't be a fool !


    Game Play
    ---------

    The main aim is to stop the blocks reaching the top of the screen. You
    do  this  by manipulating th blocks to form lines. When a line is made
    it will disapear.

    You score points for manipulating the blocks and for making lines. The
    amount  you  score  depends  on  what  difficulty  and  level  you are
    currently playing on. If you manage to get 4 lines at once you  get  a
    BONUS.

    Simple enough but totaly addictive.


    There are 2 methods of play :-

    'Tetris'  - This is standard Tetris mode. Simply position the standard
                 blocks.

    'SpinBrix' - In this mode the game is harder & there are some new
                 blocks to deal with.


    'Duel' mode
    -----------

    This is where the real fun starts. This allows you to play  2  players
    against  each  other. The idea is to make lines yourself and block the
    other player from making any. Simple eh ? Nah !

    When you select 'Duel' mode you can set the number of  lines  for  the
    duel. Simply type in the number you want on the appropriate screen. If
    you just press <RETURN> then the default is 50 lines.

    In this mode Player 1 uses the Joystick & Player 2 uses keys.


    There are 9 different start levels to play from. We recommend starting
    at level 6 if you are a seasoned Tetris player if not start from  0  &
    work up.

    As  you progress the speed (level) will increase until you reach level
    8.

    Controls
    --------

    There are 2 methods of control.  Either Joystick or Keyboard.

    The joystick controls are :-

            LEFT = Move Left     RIGHT = Move Right

                   DOWN = Increase drop speed

                        FIRE = Rotate Block

    The keyboard controls are :-

            LEFT ARROW = Move Left   RIGHT ARROW = Move Right

                    DOWN ARROW = Increase drop speed

                        SPACE BAR = Rotate Block

                                M = Toggle Music/SFX ingame
                                P = Pause
                                Q = Quit
