    Introduction
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Welcome  to  the  Squares/Megabounce  compilation.  Licenced   to   5D
    Licenceware.  Two  arcade style games created with the aid of Amos Pro
    in 1997.

    Squares
    ~~~~~~~
    The game Squares is a multi-level  avoid  em'  up  where  you  are  in
    control  of  Ronnie  worm  , who's duties include the painting of each
    square in Wormland. Apart from this  artistic  body  painting,  Ronnie
    also  has to avoid the attentions of the Evil-Eye, Burping Frogs & Ray
    Gun.

    Along the way Ronnie will encounter hostages of Evil-Eye's in the form
    of  sickly  baby worms kidnapped from Dr Wormardoes. Ronnie must carry
    the babies to the gold transporter  which  will  whisk  them  away  to
    safety and deposits Ronnie back into the game to continue his tasks.

    Other features in this 20 level romp include...

      - Random powerups (+ 1000 points for each collected)

      - Time bonus ( The less time taken for each level = more score )

      - High score table ( Saves to disk - leave write enabled )

      - Quit to game menu ( Press escape on the title screen )


    Control of Squares is by joystick and the game should run on any Amiga
    1  meg  or  over. I have included options for different Amiga's in the
    game so you may speed up or slow  down  the  game  to  suit  different
    machines. The options guess what Amiga you have and suggests an option
    : experiment to find your own preference.

    NOTE:
    1 MEG A500 OWNERS SHOULD SELECT THAT CONFIGURATION ONLY ; AS OTHERWISE
    THE  GAME  WILL  NOT  RUN  - THIS IS BECAUSE SQUARES REQUIRES TOO MUCH
    MEMORY. THE 1 MEG A500 OPTION DOES NOT LOAD THE MUSIC MODULE INTO  THE
    GAME; THUS SAVING MEMORY!

    Some of the inspiration for this game comes from...

                    Q-BIC ( A great pd game - buy it now ! )

    Squares has been written & tested on a....

    Megabounce
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    Megabounce is an Arcade bat & bricks game in the style of Breakout and
    the  Arkanoid  series  of games. Megabounce is controlled by the mouse
    and features an editor to create your own extra levels.

    Other controls & features in the game include.....


     - Scoring ( Each brick is worth 10 points )

     - High score table ( saves to disk - leave disk write enabled )

     - Music volume ( F1- increase music volume  F2- lower music volume )

     - Soundfx ( F3- Kill music sfx only  F4- Restore music )

     - Powerup collection ( Allow the powerups to fall on the bat )

     - Multiple powerups ( Slowball | points bonus | clear wave etc )

     - Laser powerup ( Allows you to shoot the bricks with the lmb )

     - Quit to game menu ( Press escape on the title screen )


    Hints...

    Powerups collected stay with you and do not erase the powerup you  are
    presently  using.  Beware  of  the skull powerup as this kills you and
    ends the game. ( You will still be  able  to  enter  your  high  score
    though )

    You will be awarded an extra life after so many levels - so stick with
    it -the more levels you complete the more you are rewarded.

    Try and get the ball along the edge of the right wall as sometimes you
    may  knockout  alot  of the middle section of bricks or send it to the
    top allowing you time to relax and position  the  bat  for  your  next
    strike.

    Machine requirements...

    Although  Megabounce  was  written  on  an A1200 it should work on any
    Amiga.

    Thanks to...

    Special thanks go to Dark-Knight for his superb module I have used  in
    the Megabounce game.


    Playing from Disk
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Playing Squares or Megabounce from floppy is easy , just boot with the
    disk  in  the  internal  drive of the Amiga and select an F key on the
    menu screen to choose either game or docs.


          DO NOT CLICK THE MOUSE ON THE GAME MENU PICTURE AS THIS

                     WILL DISABLE THE F KEY FUNCTIONS.


    If you wish to run the games from Workbench , first make sure you have
    the game disk libraries and the game disk fonts on your hardrive. Then
    insert the game disk ; double click on the game or doc icon  you  wish
    to run.


    Installing to Hard Drive
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Both games will install to hard drive fine and provided you follow the
    guidelines below there shold be no problems running them.

    Installing Megabounce...

    Copy the entire Megabounce directory and its contents over to wherever
    you  wish  the  game  to  be  on your hard drive. Providing you DO NOT
    rename the sub directory "levels+hiscores" to any  other  name  ;  the
    game will run correctly. The amos library and crunchmania library will
    both need to be in your Workbench: Libs directory.

    Installing Squares...

    Copy the Squares directory over to where you  want  it  on  your  hard
    drive  and  make  sure  you  have  the  following  on  your  Workbench
    partition....

    Fonts
    Times 13
    Mfast 20

    These can all be copied from the fonts directory on this disk to  your
    fonts  directory  in  Workbench. ( Remember to copy both the directory
    and the .font file over )

    As with Megabounce , the amos library  and  crunchmania  library  both
    need to be in your Libs directory.
