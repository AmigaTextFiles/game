                                   ~~~~~~~~

                                   METHOD 1
                                   --------

    You are now in charge of  the  movements  of  Dino  Fagoli,an  Italian
    ex-boxer  who's  a  bit  dim.You  start off this part of the game on a
    wharf in a small town.
    Leave the wharf and head for the drugstore (OPPOSITE THE CIRCUS IN THE
    CIRCUS  SQUARE).Go over to the shelves and purchase a can of beans and
    eat them.This will make Dino feel lively so go  into  the  circus  and
    enter  the  weightlifting contest.Do this by walking straight into the
    tent and getting stopped by the ringmaster.Ask him who he thinks he is
    and he will announce that we have a volunteer to challenge Big Urus in
    the weightlifting.Then go inside and  lift  the  same  weight  as  the
    champion  to win 100 Rouble Dollars.Go to the drugstore and purchase a
    casket of rum and the headache pills.Go back to the  wharf  and  enter
    the  inn.Pick  up  the tankard and give it to the landlord who'll will
    fill it with water.
    Leave the inn and go back to  the  circus  square  and  enter  Zelda's
    cabin.Talk  to  her  about  your  future.Madam Zelda will tell you she
    visualises a land scorched by the sun,a man  on  a  horse  and  hidden
    treasure.She  will go on to say she sees two syrangers called Alex and
    Kos telling you your future depends  on  them.When  Zelda  leaves  the
    room,talk  to  the  parrot  who'll  tell  you  he wants some sunflower
    seeds.Exit and head back to the wharf.
    Combine the headache pills with the water and give the mixture to  the
    drunk.Talk  to  the  drunk  and ask him about his box.The box contains
    sunflower seeds that he'll exchange for a cask of rum.Swap the rum for
    the  box and open the box.Go back to Zelda's and give the seeds to the
    parrot.The parrot will then have a argument with  his  female  partner
    and  leave  her  to  go  with  you  saying  married  life  didn't suit
    him.Before leaving,pick up the skull and potion.
    Head back to the inn and show the parrot to the old  sea  dog  sitting
    near  the  door.The  old  dog turns out to be a captain who originally
    owned the parrot.When the captain asks how he can repay you,ask  about
    the route of the oil tanker Potemkin and when it's due to dock here.
    The captain will get round to telling you but don't rush him,he  wants
    to  tell  you  a  few tales about his life on the high seas.Eventually
    he'll tell you the ships heading for Stokafisburg (ABOUT 60 MILES FROM
    THE INN).You'll find out that there is a ship heading for Stokafisburg
    called the Santa Rosalia and the captain is a good friend of  the  old
    sea dog,named Vito Corallo.Sadly,the Santa Rosalia's not leaving for a
    week so you'll have to find another way of getting there.
    Walk  over  to  the  innkeeper   and   ask   him   how   to   get   to
    Stokafisburg.He'll   tell  you  to  go  the  Orient  Express  line  at
    Zerograd,just  up  the  road.Leave  the   inn   and   head   for   the
    crossroads,which you'll find just beyond the circus.
    At the crossroads,go straight towards the woods  and  enter  them.Head
    for  the  dark  wood  and  turn  into  the channel that leads into the
    distance.You will arrive at a sign with a wasp's nest to the  left  of
    it.
    Select your lollipop and show it to the wasp's nest.They'll chase  you
    to a nearby cave.When you arrive,throw the lollipop inside so that the
    wasps follow it.This gets rid of the pair of wolves which  means  that
    you can safely enter.
    The cave leads to another part of the woods so keep  going  until  you
    reach  the town of Zerograd.You'll see the train station in the center
    of the town.Pick up the poster in the  wall  and  go  to  the  luggage
    office  and  show  the  poster  to  the ape.This makes the ape throw a
    banana at you.Pick up the banana and talk to Miss Molatova's bodyguard
    back  on  the platform.He will be extremely rude,so eat the banana and
    drop the skin  on  the  floor  and  then  talk  to  Miss  Molatova.The
    bodyguard  tries to hit you but slips on the banana skin.The bodyguard
    breaks his leg which leaves a vacancy that you fill by talking to Miss
    Molatova,she'll  ask you to escort her to Venice,so you can get on the
    train.

                                  METHOD TWO (Slightly Different)
                                  ----------

    Go into the inn and pick up  tyhe  jug.Give  it  to  the  landlord  to
    receive  some  water.Examine  the  wine  list and talk to the landlord
    about one of the wines.Buy the goldengrape and when he disappears take
    all of the items from the walls.
    Head for the drugstore (OPPOSITE THE CIRCUS IN THE  CIRCUS  SQUARE).Go
    over to the shelves and purchase a can of beans and eat them.This will
    make  Dino  feel  lively  so  go  into  the  circus  and   enter   the
    weightlifting  contest  (AS  IN  METHOD  OME)  and  win the 100 Rouble
    Dollars.Go back to the drugstore and buy a casket of rum.
    Now go to Madam Zelda's cabin (ON THE CIRCUS SQUARE) and talk  to  her
    about  your  future.She'll  tell  you  she sees a land scorched by the
    sun,a man on ahorse and hidden  treasure.She'll  tell  you  your  life
    depends on two strangers called Alex and Kos.
    Zelda now leaves the room so  take  the  opportunity  to  examine  the
    headache  potion  and  mix all the ingredients together.Give the drunk
    the headache potion and ask him about his box.It will turn out that it
    contains sunflower seeds and the drunk's willing to swap the box for a
    casket of rum.Swap the rum for the box and open it.Take the  seeds  to
    the parrot in Zelda's cabin and take the parrot along with you.
    Go to the inn and reunite the parrot with the old sea dog,then go  and
    talk to the sword swallower.When he swallows his sword,pick up another
    from the front of the stall.Go to the  crossroads  and  head  for  the
    lake.Pick up all the items from the snowman,use the sword on the ice.
    Combine the broom with the pendant  to  catch  a  fish  from  the  ice
    hole.Take  it back to the wharf and show it to the cat.Take the cat to
    the inn and show it to the dog.Grab another sword and combine the  two
    swords and the box to make a sledge.
    Head back to the lake and sledge across it to reach Zerograd.You  will
    eventually  arrive at the train station in the center of town.Take the
    poster on the wall then go to the luggage office and show  the  poster
    to  the  ape  who'll throw a banana at you.Pick it up and talk to Miss
    Molatova's bodyguard on the platform.
    The bodyguard will be rude so eat the banana and drop the skin on  the
    floor before going and talking to Miss Molatova.The bodyguard will try
    to hit you but slips on the skin,breaking his  leg,leaving  a  vacancy
    you can step into by talking to Miss Molatova.She'll ask you to escort
    her to Venice and you'll be able to board the train.
