                                     2. Hacks


    1. Cheats:
    =========
    Type your first and last names and call sign. Push [Ctrl]+[Enter]  and
    you'll  be  warped  past the training missions. While flying hold down
    [Right  Shift]  and  type:  plop  -  this  will  render  your  fighter
    invunerable  to  missiles.  When  you  crash  you'll  skip to the next
    mission!



    2. Hack:
    =======
    Hack your way through TFX saving you time and putting an  end  to  the
    frustration  of having to replay through missions every time it's your
    misfortune to die. Read on for how to do this and how to achieve  some
    other handy cheats ...

    1. Backing up your pilot:
    ------------------------
    There are 10 pilot spaces on the roster board in TFX. If  you  save  a
    pilot on the first space the file is saved under TFXSAV.0. If you save
    your pilot under the second space it's saved under TFXSAV.1 and so on.
    Let's  assume  that  your  pilot  is  saved  under  TFXSAV.0. Copy the
    TFXSAV.0 file to TFXBAK.0 by typing:

    copy tfxsav.0 tfxbak.0

    2. Cheating to increase your points:
    -----------------------------------
    Go into your C:\TFX directory and type the  following:  copy  tfxsav.0
    tfxsav.ba1

    then  type:  debug  tfxsav.0 or any other TFXSAV file. Finally type in
    the following to give yourself a massive 16777215 points:

    E 0140 00 00 FF FF FF
    W
    Q

    3. Increasing your pilot rank:
    -----------------------------
    Debug any TFXSAV file and then enter the following codes to  become  a
    1st Lieutenant:

    E 013F 01
    W
    Q

    Change the 01 on the first line to a higher number for higher rank:

    02 Captain
    03 Major
    04 Lt Colonel
    05 Colonel
    06 General

    4. Resurrect yourself if you happen to crash or be captured:
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Debug any of the TFXSAV  files  and  enter  these  simple  but  highly
    effective codes:

    E 01F4 00
    E 01AB 00
    W
    Q

    5. How to bypass the training missions and get on to the Tours of Duty
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Do the debug routine - as mentioned countless times before - and enter

    E 01AB 00
    E 01AD 01
    E 01AF 3E
    W
    Q

    6. Skipping through the Tour of Duty and Flaspoint missions:
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Debug TFXSAV.2 (ooh! A different one) then to put yourself in  one  of
    the Tour of Duty or Flashpoint missions type in one of the following:

    E 01AD 10       The F117-A
    E 01AD 0F       The YF 22
    E 01AD 0E       The EFA
    E 01AD 0A       The Drug War
    E 01AD 0B       Defiance in The Desert
    E 01AD 0C       Operation Restore Hope Two
    E 01AD 0D       Bosnia: The Never Ending War
    E 01AD 0C       The Doomsday Ship

    Having done this you must now put in one of the following codes:

    E 01AF 05       Mission 1
    E 01AF 0A       Mission 2
    E 01AF 10       Mission 3
    E 01AF 15       Mission 4
    E 01AF 1A       Mission 5
    E 01AF 20       Mission 6
    E 01AF 25       Mission 7
    E 01AF 2A       Mission 8
    E 01AF 30       Mission 9
    E 01AF 3A       Mission 10
