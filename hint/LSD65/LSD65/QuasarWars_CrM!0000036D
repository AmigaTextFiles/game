                                 MISSION KODES




                              Mission.o2 - NRRH1
                              Mission.o3 - CHMH7

                           Here my Fröjdepinn broke

                              Mission.o4 - 6K6RZ

                   Found out that the keyboard almost works





    Couldn't get past objective 15, for  some  unknown  reason.  Destroyed
    everything  that  could  be  destroyed  but nothing happens. You try..
    Misson-4 code brings you to number 13.
                                                                HÄFTIG/EFK

    P.S
    The briefing says that its the last mission.. The  great  elephant-god
    knows  if  that  is  true,  or  if  them spanish developers have a bad
    knowledge in english. (they do lack here and there all over the  game)
    D.S
