                               THE BIG RED ADVENTURE
                               ---------------------

    BIG RED INTRODUCTION!
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    In the old Russia there  was  Communism,queues  the  Kremlin,Lenin,the
    KGB, Queues,Karl Marx,the Cold War and Queues...

    But  in  the  new Russia,things have changed. Now there is Capitalism,
    KGB TV,Burger Czar and Trotsky Interactive Games...

    Oh and Queues(some things never change)...

    Embroiled on this seething cauldron of cutthroat competition and cruel
    commercial cossacks, we find the beginning of our adventure -A BIG RED
    ADVENTURE that spawns an entire continent.

    In a story of truly  epic  proportions,  we  are  taken  on  a  crazy,
    off-the-wall   flight   of   fancy,   from   the   snowy   streets  of
    Moscow,slipping and sliding across the icy steppes of Zerograd,  along
    the  route of the famed Orient Express -and into the deep red heart of
    a secret so weird even David Lynch could never match it ...

    BIG RED REVOLUTION!
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    In spite of the benefits of Perestroika, not everyone  is  happy  with
    the  decline  of the Soviet state. In a secret meeting place somewhere
    in Moskow, a few old men in faded Red Army uniforms hark back  to  the
    days when Marx was called Karl and not Groucho or Harpo.

    They  formulate  a  cunning  plan to return Mother Russia to Communist
    rule - only,they didn't  reckon  on  a  trio  of  foreign  adventurers
    accidentially getting in on the action...


    BIG RED CHARACTERS!
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    DOUG NUTS
    ^^^^^^^^^

    Doug is a techno-nerd of the  first  order.There's  nothing  he  likes

    often puts his ability with electronics to criminal use sometimes with
    hilarious results.

    DINO FIGOLI
    ^^^^^^^^^^^

    An ex-boxer of  Italian  origin,  Dino's  more  than  a  little  punch

    into traps set by people taking advantage of the fact that  his  brain
    is the size of a shrivelled wallnut...

    DONNA FATALE

    blackmailers.
