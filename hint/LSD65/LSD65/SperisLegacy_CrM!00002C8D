                               SPERIS LEGACY

    THE PLOT

    It was the same old story, the evil Prince  Gallus  slew  his  brother
    Kale  to gain the Kingdom. Now only Cho, boyhood friend of Kale, stood
    in his way. This was Cho`s chance for adventure. His chance  to  prove
    his  worth.  He  couldn`t  wait for Gallus to seek him out. Instead he
    would take the fight to Gallus, and end the threat to  the  Sperisland
    forever.

    THE LAND OF SPERIS

    Cho  begins  his  quest from within his home in Sharma City. The quest
    through Speris will take you through many adventures in different  and
    unusual  locations.  You play the character Cho, guide him through his
    quest to overcome the evil Gallus. You are given complete  freedom  to
    traverse the entire land of Speris. All locations are there for you to
    discover and explore, be wary as some are hidden  and  not  so  easily
    found..!

    On  your  journey  you will meet many weird and wonderful people, both
    good and evil, who may hinder or help your quest.
