    THE GAME.
    =========

    You should now be looking at a screen which shows which team  you  are
    contracted to.

    got a lot of loading to do.

    The screen will then show you all the  participating  teams,click  the
    left mouse key to continue.

    You    should    now    be    looking    at   a   screen   with   four
    options,Squad,Fixtures, Tables,The Match.

    SQUAD.
    ======

    In front of you now should be your squad of 15 players.

    By clicking on one of the players with your right mouse key  you  will
    bring up their statistics.

    This  shows  their  age,how  many  they have played,how many they have
    scored and also  all  their  different  attributes,such  as  pace  and
    stanima.

    Two  new  factors that you dont see in many games of this type are the
    average ratings and the assists.

    The former being that after every game each player gains a mark out of
    ten for their performances.

    Through  the  tournament  they are given an average rating to show how
    well they are performing.

    For example a player  with  an  average  rating  of  2.84  is  playing
    extremely poorly.

    The  latter  feature is the assists,this shows who is actually setting
    up the goalscorers so that you can find your best playmaker.

    Going back to the squad screen you will see four buttons.

    The first is obvious as that it takes you back to the first menu.

    The second is the match info screen clicking this with your left  left
    mouse  button  brings  up  all the info on your next opponents,such as
    their

    Star Player. The third is the tactics screen this is where you sellect
    your different strategies,such as playing deep ect.

    The  fourth  is  to select and move your team around to best suit you.
    Firstly click the move button,then click on the  player  you  wish  to
    move, then click on the player you wish to swap him with.

    You must select each option with the left mouse key to accomplish this
    task.

    Your team is based on six outfield players,three substitutes and three
    reserves.

    You  are  only allowed three substitutions in one match and cannot use
    your reserves.

    FIXTURES.
    =========

    This option is straight forward by selecting  it  you  will  see  your
    tournament  fixture  list. To get back to the main menu just click the
    left mouse key.

    TABLES.
    =======

    This is also straight forward as this  screen  will  show  your  teams
    current  standing.  There  is  also four extra buttons to select these
    are;the first option shows a table of each  of  your  players  average
    ratings for your persual,the second shows a table of each players goal
    scoring prowess,the third shows a table of the assist  kings  in  your
    team and the fourth shows each teams manager.

    THE MATCH.
    ==========

    This option goes directly to the game,firstly it shows you  the  teams
    line  ups,then  by clicking the left mouse key youre straight into the
    action. The match is twenty minutes each way and is played on  one  of
    twenty courts. To use substitutes you must click the left mouse key on
    the subs/tactics button,this will bring you to the squad screen  where
    you  can change tactics and make substitutions in just the same way as
    you would move a player. Remembering of course that you can only  move
    three substitutes.

    The tournament is eighteen games long and is a realistic challenge all
    the way. Can you make it to the  top  and  become  the  Premier  Sixes
    Champion ?.
