    ***********************************************************************
    Due to lack of  interest on  my part, this will be my final  release of
    Sweet Cheater.  If anyone is  interested in continuing the list, I will
    gladly forward all  new cheats that I come across to you.  Since my new
    passion is writing hard drive installers, I don't  have the time to put
    into the cheat list.
    ***********************************************************************

    This cheat list contains well over 1000 cheats, hints,  and level codes
    for the Amiga and CD³². The game titles with my name after them are the
    ones that I have  found.  I have put quite a  bit of time into  finding
    some of these cheats, so if you  add any to your list all I ask is that
    you give me credit.   If you upload  the list to a bbs or include it on
    a compilation disk please do not remove or alter the header.

    All the games with an asterick (*) in front of them have been verified.
    If the game  has been verified and  has more than one cheat,  the cheat
    right after the  game title is  the one that has been verified,  but in
    some cases all the cheats may work.

    Some of the cheats may have changed throughout the list due to the fact
    that I have verified a  lot of them  and made corrections  when needed.
    If a cheat  didn't work before you may want to look at the cheat again,
    it may have been fixed.  I try to verify as  many as I can, but I don't
    have most of the games.  I won't verify a cheat with an * unless I have
    personally tested it and found that the cheat works.
