1.Installation

This chapter provides the basics on the VIDEO BACKUP SYSTEM. The
installation procedures for both hardware and software are explained.

1.1 Before you get started
....you need to make a backup of the original Video Backup System disk.
Use this as your working copy.

1.2 What you should have

The following are the Video Backup System components:
--- Video Interface: This is a small unit which has a 25 pin
    connector to connect the Amiga's serial port and two
    phono plugs on the other side.
    (see VBS-BEST.lha) Only Amiga! BBS   219-493-4318
                       complete schematic available 
--- Amiga-to-VCR cable: this is an ordinary phono-to-phono
    (rca-style) cable to connect the Amiga'a video output to the
    VCR input
--- One 3.5" system disk (Video Backup System Rev 1.5) (5/93)
--- This manual
--- Your pirate registration card...get your own updates!

1.3 Hardware Installation

Figure 1.1 shows the hardware setup for operation of the VBS
at a glance.
  

               Reference Figure 1.1 VBS Hardware Setup
                      
                     ( See FIG1.1.IFF )

Before you connect anything, be sure to turn off your computer and video
equipment first.
After these precautions, plug the Video Backup System interface
into the SERIAL port.
Next connect its black plug to your VCR's Video Output.
When you use a 1084s or equivalent monitor, you can optionally
connect the red plug to the composite video input jack at the back of
the monitor. You enjoy the facility to use the 1084s as
a control monitor for viewing the video signal. Using the
CVBS/RGB switch on the front panel (or on rear of d-1 & d-2
style 1084s), you can either choose the CVBS source (VCR) or the RGB
signal (Amiga).
Using the other cable to connect the Amiga's composite output to the
VCR input jack. (This is a standard rca-phono to rca-phono
cord of appropriate length. It is not connected to the VBS interface
module, just Amiga composite out to VCR.)
{***** Note Amiga 3000 & 3000-T require a source for the
composite output....the makers of VBS can supply you one...cost
unknown.., you may substitute and Amiga A520 adapter that
is available new for less than $40 to used at $X ... I use
a digiflex adapter that provides pass thru RGB, S-VHS output
and composite output...S-VHS to VCR gives equivalent results
as composite output..reliabilty wise...both work well. An additional 25pin
M-F db25 adapter is necessary to use with either of these later two
that stands the adapter out about an inch so that the adapter case does
not conflict with insertion of the adapter to the amiga's video RGB
output connector..on my 3000-T it needed this extension to fit the
confines of the case...you'll just have to check to see if it will fit
on a 3000 using an a520 adapter.***}

Via this connection data flows from the Amiga to the VCR.

1.4 Contents of the disk

To check out the original disk, please put your working copy in a drive
and double click on the VBS disk icon. After a few seconds, you'll see
a window. Figure 1.2 shows the structure of the VBS program disk.
            
           Figure 1.2  Structure of VBS program disk

                 ( See FIG1.2.IFF )

In the root directory you'll find the Video Backup System program file,
>>VBS<<. This single program comprises all the video backup and restore
facilities of the VBS. The seperate utility, >>HD install<< is provided
for easy hard disk installation.
The Shell icon gives you access to the Amiga's command line
interface. Furthurmore, the following drawers exist:
     System: This is the standard drawer for system utilities
             like format and diskcopy
   LogFiles: Initially, you'll find no log file here. Later you will
             keep logs of your own video tapes here.
      Fonts: This is the standard drawer for Amiga fonts. By default VBS
             uses melba.font for its visual headers (see 2.2.5)

1.5 Installing the software on a hard disk

In case you have a hard disk, you probably want to install the VBS on it
so that you can start it from there at all times. On the disk, there is
a utilty called >>VBS_Install<< which caries out this job for you.
Boot from the hard disk to make sure the FONTS: path is set to your hard
disk's font directory. On double-clicking the >>VBS_Install<< icon, a
window appears on the Workbench screen as shown in Figure 1.3

            Figure 1.3  Installation Utility
  
                  ( See FIG1.3.IFF )

Using the string gadget above, you can indicate which directory is to be
used for the VBS. By default, the directory is set to Work:VBS
Click on OK to start installation, or Cancel to abort. After clicking OK,
all necessary files are copied to the hard disk.
To be able to start the VBS by double clicking a log file icon
(See2.2.4), the logical device >>VBS<< needs to be assigned to
the directory where VBS was installed.
To accomplish this, your startup-sequence need to contain a line
>> Assign VBS: <path to VBS> <<. Click on OK if you want the installation
 utility to insert this line in your startup-sequence automatically. 
The default here is >>s:startup-sequence<< for systems running
 Amiga Dos 1.3 or less, and >>s:User-Startup<< for 
Amiga Dos 2.0 or above. Click Cancel if you prefer to add it yourself.
After this the installation is finished.

1.6 Copyright Notice

The VBS is not copy protected. This means that you can copy
you original disk without difficulties...etc etc..snarf snarf


2.   Using The Video Backup System

This describes the use of VBS software in full detail. If you did not
connect the hardware and you VCR to the Amiga yet, please do so first.
The VBS software fully uses the capabilities of Intuition to provide an
easy to use and easy to learn user interface. The main means of issuing
commands to the program is the mouse, as all functions are accessible
 through gadgets and pull down menus.

2.1 VBS Main Menu

Please put your working copy into a drive and open the disk's window on the
workbench. A double-click on the icon labelled
VBS starts the program. 
When the program shows up, you'll see the main screen (Fig2.1)
                  
                  Figure 2.1  VBS Main Screen
                  
                    ( See FIG2.1.IFF )

To the left, you see ten gadgets which give you access to the program's
main functions. The large black area at the right is  used to display
the contents of log files (See 2.2.3). At the top of the log file box,there
is a pad that shows the name of the log files, now indicating >> None<<.

2.2 Concepts behind VBS

For a better understanding it is important to be familiar with some of
the basic ideas behind VBS.

2.2.1 Floppy Vs. Filesystem Backup

These are the two kinds of backups available. A floppy backup is a
track-by-track image of 880k AmigaDOS disk, written to video.
A filesystem backup is normally used to save the contents of hard disks,
but you can make a backup of any filesystem device like Ram: , Rad:, etc.
It uses the file system instead of reading raw tracks, so that you can
include and exclude individual files 
and directories.

2.2.2  Video Connection Check

The VBS software does this check before starting a backup
operation. This makes sure that your backup really gets recorded on video
tape, because the check fails when:
 -- Your VCR unit is not turned on
 -- The connections are not OK
 -- You VCR is not tuned to the AUX channel (external source).
    The channel display on the VCR should show 0 or AUX (not a
    viewable TV channel number). refer to your VCR instruction 
    manual for details.
When the check fails, you will see a requester that tells you so.
Then you can either correct the mistake and click on >>OK now<< or click
on >>Abort<< to abort the operation.

2.2.3  Using the Tape Counter

The tape counter is necessary to find locations on the video tape easily.
For the VBS, it is assumed that your VCR has a real time counter,the format
of which is H:MM:SS (Hours,Minutes,Seconds).
When inserting a new video tape, make sure that counter value 0:00:00
corresponds with the beginning of the tape. This is achieved by rewinding
the tape and pressing the "counter reset"
button on your VCR.
Many VCR's have a Time-To-Go function, which gives you access to
any point on the tape by simply specifying the time from the beginning of
the tape.
The tape counter also plays an important role when using the log files.

2.2.4  Log Files

Log Files are a means of keeping track of what is on a tape. For
practical reasons, they are not kept somewhere on the tape.
Instead, they are stored as a file on floppy or hard disk.
For each tape that you use for video backups, you should have a seperate
log file. To avoid confusion, a good suggestion would
be to write the name you chose for the log file on the tape label.

Log Files contain lines of the form:

START   TIME-END   TIME   BACKUP TYPE    NAME    DATE

Each of these entries represents a backup once made.

Start
This indicates the starting position of this backup on the video tape.
This value was specified when the backup was made. as the
Amiga cannot determine the current counter value automatically.

End
This indicates where the backup ends. This value was computed from the
starting time and the measured duration of the backup 
operation.

Type
This is an indicator of the backup type. Currently two values
are possible. "ADF" means AmigaDos floppy. "FS" means Filesystem

Name 
In case of a floppy backup, this is the AmigaDos name of the floppy.
{(VBS also recognizes quarterbacked disks and names
them usually as NDOS with unusual, extraneous characters after the name,
and also gives a screwy date...but it does back up the disk perfectly..
a .good idea to use the counter on these to note where Qb47 is located on 
tape when recording a large number of
quarterbacked disks..see example below of a quarterback disk backup 
logfile and some of the ways it is presented as recorded

{just to show you how it looks with qb'd disks}

Date
In case of a floppy backup, it is the creation date read from the disk.
In the case of Filesystem backup, it indicates the date the backup was 
made or whatever date is on your system at that time if you dont have a
battery-clock function or current date set manually.
Each time you make a backup, such a line is added to the log file.
Note: The software deliberately doesn't take any action when two entries
overlap in time,to avoid data losses when you make a mistake. For instance,
if you record something over a previous recording, you get conflicting
entries in the log file
table. You can remove obsolete entries by using the >>Del Log
Entry<< function.
The log files are stored in plain ASCII format. This means that you 
can modify the file by hand if necessary, and that you can print it.

2.2.5  Visual Headers
A visual header is an image which is recorded on the VCR for about 5 
seconds, just before the actual backup starts. In a large font 
{melba.font-61...you can change to another if you wish by selecting 
the font you want to use and entering it in the icons tool selection...
see information pull down menu for the icon for VBS on the workbench 
screen...can change to other fonts, if you have a composite type that 
displays color, A1000 or visa Diga-Flex composite output adapter!} 
, the name of the backup and other data are shown. See Figure 2.2 for an
example.

                  Figure 2.2  A Visual Header
    
                     ( See FIG2.2.IFF )

This concept enables you to locate backups easily. Look at your control 
monitor (In case you connected the 1084s as described in 
section 1.2 , press the CVBS/RGB button to select the VCR signal), 
and use the search forward/backward buttons on your VCR
until you see the right visual header.

2.3  Floppy Backup

This function deals with the storage of AmigaDOS floppies on video tape.

2.3.1  Floppy Requester
When you click on the gadget >>Floppy Backup<<, the Floppy Requester 
comes up (See Figure 2.3).

                 Figure 2.3 The Floppy Requester
                    
                      ( See FIG2.3.IFF )

Drive Selector
At the top, you see the drive selector. Units that are not
available are shown ghosted (overlaid with a faint pattern of dots).
Using the Left Mouse Button, you can select which drive(s) you 
want to backup from. The drive(s) selected are changed to black
background in button.

Entering start time
When a video tape log is in use (See 2.2.4), you must enter
the starting tape location in the time gadget after >>Tape
Start Position<<. This will be used to create a log file entry for 
this disk. A good idea is to enter a time a few seconds ahead of the 
current cointer reading. This allows some time for the VCR to get going 
after pressing RECORD, and this allows a good s
ynchronization as well.

Multiple Disks
The VBS also allows you to store multiple floppies directly after one 
another on the tape. This is useful to store large
games or pd collections {or WAREZ!} on tape.
If you want to store multiple disks, toggle the gadget 
>>Multiple<< by clicking on it with the Left Mouse Button.
When >>Multiple<< is enabled, you may select more than one drive. 

For instance, when you select both DF0: and DF1:, the software will 
alternate between DF0: and DF1:. This means that the first disk comes 
from DF0: and the next from DF1:,the next from DF0:
again and so on until you stop the series. {be prepared to be able to 
insert disks at time of restore with the same manual speed that you 
inserted them when they were backed up for timeing reasons...as the 
tape keeps going and if you dont insert them as requested....
you can loose track quickly of where you are in the process.}

Ending the floppy requester
Click >>Cancel<< to cancel the backup operation.  To continue
click on >>OK<<.

2.3.2   Backup Operation

Making the backup involves the following steps:
-- First the video connection is checked (See 2.2.2).
   If this is OK, the screen gets black.
-- Make sure the disk to be backed up is in the selected drive
-- Make sure the right video tape is loaded and it is at the
   desired position.
-- Press RECORD on the VCR.
__ Press the Left Mouse Button to start. In case you use a log 
file, click when the video counter exactly matches the value
you typed in. Then you realize the best synchronization.
Now the video backup starts. For 5 seconds, you will see the
Visual Header. Then, the actual backup takes place for 1 minute
{approx.}. You can abort this operation by just clicking the Left Mouse Button.
When multiple is not enabled, you get back to the VBS main screen when the 
operation finishes. Press STOP on the VCR at this moment.
If it is enabled, VBS will make a backup of the next disk. If you 
selected more than one drive, the next disk wiil be read from another 
drive (the next in line). You have a chance at this time to insert the 
next disk in this drive while the first was written.
After the last disk of your series, click the Left Mouse Button
to get back to the Main Screen. In fact, you can do this at ANY
time you want to abort.

2.4   Floppy Restore

This feature enables you to retrieve floppy disk contents from
video. Within a minute, VBS writes the floppy image from video
directly to a blank disk. The disk doesn't even have to be formatted 
beforehand!

2.4.1  Name Requester

When you click on the >>Floppy Restore<< gadget, the Name
Requester pops up. Now, you are requested to enter the name of 
the floppy disk you would like to restore. It is sufficient that
the string you type here matches the first few characters of the
real name (case sensitive). This implies that entering nothing is 
allowed and OK: it then matches the following file found on the tape 
without regard to what it is named.

Click >>OK<< to continue, >>Cancel<< gets you back to the Main Screen.
After clicking >>OK<<, the Floppy Requester pops up. Here, you
select the drive(s) you wish to restore to. Read section 2.3.1 for a
full description of this requester.In case you enabled >>Multiple<< to 
restore a series of floppies, the name entered in the Name Requester 
only applies to the first disk. For any subsequent disks, this name doesn't 
have to match anymore: the following backup found on the video is restored.

2.4.2   Restore Operation

After completing the floppy requester, the screen gets cleared
and the text >>Searching for AmigaDOS floppy:<NAME> << appears.
Remember, you can abort at any time by pressing Left Mouse Button. 
Follow this procedure:
-- Wind the tape to the location of the disk to be restored.
   Use the Go-To function of your VCR if it has one.
-- Make sure there is a write-enabled disk in the selected drive
   and that is does not contain valuable data. WARNING: All data
   on this disk will be overwritten during a restore!
-- Press PLAY on the VCR.
-- If VBS encounters a backup which doesn't have a matching name
   or is of a different type. (e.g. FS, the message         
   >>Encountered...<< is displayed.
-- When the desired backup is found, a message saying so is
   displayed and the data transferred from video tape to floppy
   disk.
When >>Multiple<< is not enabled, you go back to the VBS Main
Screen when the restore operation finishes. Press STOP on the
VCR at this moment.
In the other case, VBS will restore the next disk it encounters on the 
video tape. If you selected more than one drive, the next disk will be 
written to another drive (the next in line). This gives you the chance to
change disks in one drive while the other is involved in a restore operation. 
The VBS monitors the disk changes. It prevents you from restoring twice 
to the same disk by accident, by requesting you to remove that disk before
continuing.After you got the last disk of your series, click the Left
Mouse Button to get back to the Main Screen.

2.5  Filesystem Functions

The Filesystem functions can restore and retrieve data on a file-by-file 
basis. In practice, they are used to save the contents of hard disks on 
video tape. Chapter 3 covers a description of these functions.

2.6  Log File Functions

2.6.1  The File Requester

The purpose of the File Requester is to enable you to inform
the VBS of which file to process. You specify the file name, and also the 
drawer and disk device where this file is located.
Figure 2.4 shows the file requester in action.

                 Figure 2.4  The File Requester

                      ( See FIG2.4.IFF )

At the top you see the operation which will take place after selecting a 
file, in this case >>Select Log File<<.
Beneath, there is a file select box, which shows the contents of
the current drawer. This drawer can contain files and sub-drawers. 
Sub-drawers and files are shown seperately: Sub-drawers
(if there are any) are at the top part of the box, marked, 
>>(DIR)<<, and files at the bottom part. The files and drawers are 
alphabetically sorted. If the current drawer is not the root
of the current drive (i.e. it is a sub-directory),there will be a 
special name at the top of the list. It is >>/(DIR)<<, and it
denotes the parent drawer.
At the right of the file box, you will see arrow gadgets at the top and 
bottom edges, and a slide bar between them. The arrow
gadgets are of use when there are more entries in the current
drawer than fit in the box. In this case, clicking once with the left 
mouse button on the lower arrow will shift the list one line up. 
Conversely, clicking on the upper arrow will shift a line down.
The slide bar's knob has a variable size. It indicates what
percentage of files and drawers in the current drawer are
actually visible in the box. So, when there are at most 9 files
and drawers, the knob is full size (100%). As there are more entries in 
the list the knob becomes smaller. The other purpose
of the knob is to indicate the position of the part of the list
currently displayed. When you click on the knob with the left mouse button 
and hold the button down you can move the knob to a
new position. As soon as you release the left mouse button, the
corresponding portion of file names will be shown in the file
select box.
You can use the left mouse button to select items in the file 
select box. When you click on a drawer entry (labeled >>(DIR)<<)
this drawer becomes the current drawer and you see its contents in the file 
box. It means, you get one level deeper in the disk structure this way. If 
you click on >>/(DIR)<<,which is the parent drawer, you will get one level 
up in the disk structure, and
 the contents of the parent drawer will be shown. And if you click on a file 
name,the gadget labeled >>File<< will display this file name. You can then 
get this file by clicking >>OK<<.
Beneath the file select box, there is a variable number of
gadgets. There's a gadget representation for each disk device
(>>DF0:<<. >>DF1:<<, etc) available in the current system configuration. 
For instance, the number of gadgets here changes
if you add more disk drives, a hard disk, etc. to your system.
If you click on one of these gadgets the file requester will
switch to the new drive, and the file box will show the contents
of the root directory of the selected disk.
The next gadget is labeled >>Drawer<<. It is a string gadget and
it shows the name of the currently displayed drawer. You can also use this 
gadget to change to a new drawer of your choice. To do this, you click on the 
gadget to activate it. Now, a cursor appears. You can delete the existing 
name by typing
<R-Amiga>+<X> or by using the <DEL> and <BACKSPACE> keys. Then
type the full name of the new drawer. Alays use a drive name
(like >>DF0:<<) at the beginning of the name. Finally, confirm
your entry by pressing <RETURN>.
The gadget beneath this one is labeled >>File<<. This is also a string 
gadget. It shows the name of the file if you selected
one in the file select box. Alternatively, you can enter a name
yourself as described above. As soon as you press <RETURN>, this
file will be used.
At the bottom, selecting the gadget >>Abort<< causes the
operation to be canceled. The file requester will disappear and
nothing will happen.
Click on the other gadget, >>OK<< to finish your selection. The
file name as displayed in the >>File<< gadget will be used for the 
load or save. If the >>File<< gadget is empty because you
didn't either select a file in the file box, or enter a name yourself, 
the file requester will disappear and nothing will 
happen.

2.6.2   Log File / Diable Logging

Depending on whether you are already using a log file, this
gadget has text >>Log File....<<  or >>Diasble Logging<<.
See Section 2.2.4, if your not familiar with the concept of a
Log File and it purpose.

Enable Logging
To select an existing log file and to enable logging, you should
click the gadget >>Log File...<<. In reaction, the File
Requester appears.
Select the log file that corresponds to the video tape you want
to use here. Its contents will be listed in the Log File window at the 
right of the screen. At the top, the name of this log file is displayed.
If the file doesn't fit in this window entirely, use the scroll
bars at the right and at the bottom to see more of it.
Note: An alternative way to start the VBS is to double click a log file 
icon. Then this log file is immediately available after start-up which 
means you don't have to go through this procedure again.

Disable Logging
When you don't need to keep track of your backups anymore, or want to 
switch to another log file because you changed the video
tape, click on this gadget.
If there are any unsaved changes in the log file, you are asked
whether you want to save the changes first. When you click on
>>Yes<<, the changes are stored. After this, the log window
becomes black again.

2.6.3   Del Log Entry

This function enables you to erase a line from the current log file. 
This is useful when you record something over a previous
recording. In this case you get a new entry in the log file which 
conflicts with that of the previous recording. In this case, you get a 
new entry in the log file which conflicts with that of the previous 
recording.  VBS doesn't automatically remove this 
obsolete entry, so you should use the >>Del Log
Entry<< function.
You can also choose to edit the log file with your favorite
ASCII editor instead of using this function.

2.6.4   Update Log File

Use this gadget to write the log file from the Amiga's memory
back to the disk file it came from. As a result of making some backups, 
entries may have been added to the table. This function secures those changes.

2.6.5  Create New Log

When you start using a new video tape for video backup purposes,
you can use this function to create a log file for it.
This feature is accessed by clicking on >>Create New Log<<.
However it doesn't work when a log file is already active. If so, please 
Disable it first, then click the gadget again. 
Immediately, the File Requester comes up. Go to the drawer where
you keep your log files and specify a NEW file name. Choose a 
name which is easily connected with the new tape.
VBS will now create an empty file. If you started from Workbench, an 
associated icon will be created as well.
From now on, your backup operations will be recorded to this log
file.

2.7   Quit VBS

This is used to finish your session. If there are any unsaved changes to 
the log file, you are asked whether you want to save
it first. When you choose >>Yes<<, the file is stored. Then the program 
quits and you will return to Workbench (or CLI).


3.    Filesystem Backups

A filesystem backup is used to store files and directories on
video tape. In practice, you will use the Filesystem Functions
to secure your hard disk's contents. 
The VBS allows you to select the files and directories to be included in 
the backup. The directory tree provides a visual way to view and select the directories and files you want to backup. With the mouse, you need only point and click on the files or di
rectories you want. Furthermore, this directory tree structure
is preserved on the video tape.  { you can display each directory and 
record it on tape for viewing at a later date as to what is on the tape ...
visually..in case you lose or can't find the logfile or printout! }

3.1  File & Directory Selection

The VBS filesystem functions all use a windowed, mouse-driven
environment to make choosing files and directories to back up, 
restore or verify easy.  This section explains how to use the File & 
Directory Selection Screen.  Figure 3.1 shows its layout.

       Figure 3.1 File & Directory Selection Screen Layout

                  ( See FIG3.1.IFF )

From the top to bottom, the Selection Screen contains the
following parts:
-- Menu Bar: This is the top line of the screen where all menu selections 
are made. Also: drag bar to slide screen up and down.
-- Backup Status Box: This box displays the currently selected drive and 
path to be backed up. If you want to change this, select >>Cancel<< from 
the menu and adjust the Path Dialog Box.
Furthermore, it shows you just how many subdirectories you have
selected to backup,how many total files across all subdirectories and how 
many bytes the files occupy.
-- Directory Tree Window: This is the window on the left side of your 
screen. It lets you see and select the subdirectories you wish to backup. 
You can use the mouse to position the highlight
bar in the window, the highlighted directory is indicated by a light blue 
bar. using the scroll bars at the right and bottom, you can reveal more of 
the tree in case it doesn't fit entirely
in the window.
-- File List Window: This is the window on the right side of the screen. 
It lists all files in the highlighted directory. These
files are shown in columns here by default: the software determines how 
many columns will fit given the file name lengths. You can toggle files 
on and off by clicking over them with the Left Mouse Button. Yellow 
indicates that a file will
be included, Black indicates exclusion. When the file list is 
bigger than the window permits, you can scroll bars to see more.

3.1.1   Selecting Files

Selected files and directories are highlighted in yellow,
unselected items are in black. As you can see all files and directories, 
except for unreadable files (which don't have their
r protection bit set), are automatically selected initially.
There will probably be occasions when you want to back up only certain 
directories and/or files instead of the entire tree. 
Mouse clicks and menu commands give you flexible options to
specify these directories and/or files.
By clicking on a different directory entry with the Left Mouse
Button, you can make the blue highlight bar jump to that directory. 
The File List Window will reflect the contents of this directory immediately.
Clicking again on the highlighted directory toggles its
selection state. This means that its color changes from yellow to black 
or visa-versa. When you select or deselect a sub-directory this way. 
the whole tree of sub-directories and files beneath it also gets selected 
or deselected.
This implies that all of the directories and files can be unselected by 
moving the mouse to the root directory and clicking on it once or twice, 
depending on whether the highlight bar was already at the root directory.
If you then want to select your >>IFF_Images<< directory and all
of its files, click twice on the >>IFF_Images<< entry in the
tree list window.
If you only want to select certain files of your >>IFF_Images<<
directory, click on it once to make it the highlighted directory. 
Then go to the File List Window, and click on each file you want to 
include. Note that when you select a file of a previously unselected 
directory, it automatically gets selected as well.
Clicking again on a selected file brings it to the unselected state again.
Note: VBS will let you select and backup empty directories.

3.1.2   Menu Options

Press the Right Mouse Button to reveal the menus available on the 
File Selection Screen.

Action Menu
The Action Menu consists of two items. The text content of the first 
item depends on whether you delected the Filesystem Backup, 
Restore or Verify option. In all cases you select this item when you have 
selected files and directories and want to continue the operation. 
This feature is also accessible via short-cut <RightAmiga-S>.
The second item is used to cancel the operation. It bring you back 
to the VBS Main Menu. For a quick Cancel, press <RightAmiga-C>.

Include/Exclude Menu
This menu provides powerful options to include and exclude groups of 
files to backup. It consists of 6 items:
Include Files: On selecting this, all files in the highlighted
               directory are included.
Exclude Files: On selecting this, all files in the highlighted
               directory are excluded.
Toggle Files : This item toggles the selection state of all 
               files in the highlighted directory.
Exclude All Archived:  This item influences the whole directory
               tree. It excludes all files which have their
               archive bit set. The archive bit is used to      
               identify files that are unchanged since the last
               backup operation. when you create or modify a 
               file, its archive bit is cleared.
Include all Archived: This is the opposite of the above item:
               all files which have their archive bit set get
               included.
Long File List:  Use this item to toggle between long and short
               file list. When disabled, you get a short file
               list: only the file names arranged in as many
               columns as will fit in the File Window. When
               this item is enabled, you see a check mark next
               to it.  VBS will then show more information on 
               the files. They are listed in a similar way as 
               the >>List<< command of AmigaDos would do:
               Name,Filesize,Protection Bits,Modification Date
               and Modification Time. For instance, this allows
               you to see whether a file's archive bit is set or
               not. The drawback is that less files will be 
               visible simutaneously, since each one occupies
               a whole line.

3.2   Filesystem Backup

This feature lets you make a backup of a filesystem directory structure 
and its contents.

3.2.1  Choosing the Files

On selecting this gadget, the following dialog box appears as
shown in Figure 3.2

    Figure 3.2 Entering the path to backup from

              ( See FIG3.2.IFF )

This is where you enter the drive and directory path you want to backup. 
If you wish to backup an entire hard disk, you would normally enter
>>DH0:<< here and press <Return> or click >>OK<<.
You might not want to backup everything however. For example, if
you just want to backup IFF images you just created, type the path name 
for your IFF directory (e.g. >>DH):IFF_Images<<). This
will select all files in this directory and its sub-directories.
The File Selection Screen willonly show the contents of the subtree 
>>DH0:IFF_Images<<. After completing the Path Dialog Box, you get to the 
File and Directory Selection Screen.
If you discover you made a mistake when typing the path just select 
>>Cancel<< from the menu to get back to the Main Screen.
Otherwise, select the files to backup. After doing this, select
>>Start Backup<<.

3.2.2   Backup Requester

Now, you will find yourself at the Backup Requester, see
Figure 3.3

       Figure 3.3     The Backup Requester

                      ( See Fig3.3.IFF )

Assigning a Name to this Backup
Type a name which you want to give to this backup as a whole, in
the string gadget at the top. This is the name that appears in the 
Log File. When you restore this backup later, you refer to it with this name.

Entering start time
When a video tape log file is active (See 2.2.4) you MUST enter
the starting tape location in the time gadget after >>Tape Start
Position<<. If it isn't this gadget will not be shown. This time
value will be used to create a log file entry for this filesystem backup. 
A good idea is to enter a time which is a few seconds ahead of the current 
counter reading. This allows some time for the VCR to get going after 
pressing RECORD, and it allows a good synchronization as well.
Note: Especially with large hard disk backups, make sure that there is 
enough room left on a tape, to avoid dissapointment.
EXPECT A TYPICAL RATE OF ABOUT 40MB PER HOUR.

Archive Bits
This is a toggle gadget, which is in a disabled state by default. 
Click on it with the Left Mouse Button to change its state.
When this gadget is enabled, it causes VBS to set the Archive
bit on each backed up file.
The Archive bit is used to identify files that are unchanged
since the last backup operation. When you create or modify a file,its 
Archive bit is cleared.

Reporting
At your option, VBS can generate a report after the backup is finished. 
By default, the name after >>Send Report To...<< is
None, indicating no report will be made.
If you want a report, click on the >>Send Report To<<. Immediately, the 
File Requester shows up. Use it to specify which file the report is to be 
written to. It automatically proposes a backup name (if already specified) 
followed by the extension >>.Report<<
The following example report shows what is included in the report:

{etc., etc.}

Click >>Cancel<< to get back to the File Selection again.
Click >>OK<< if you decide to make the backup.

3.2.3   Filesystem Backup Operation

Making the backup involves the following steps:
-- First, the video connection is checked (see 2.2.2)
   If this is OK, the screen gets black.
-- Make sure the right video tape is loaded and it is at the
   desired position.
-- Press RECORD on the VCR
-- Press the Left Mouse Button to start. In case you use a Log  
File, click at the moment the video counter exactly matches the value you 
typed in. The you realize the best synchronization. Now,the backup starts. 
For 5 seconds, you will see the Visual Header. This header shows the name 
you gave to this backup, the path from which the backup is made and current 
system date. The duration of the actual backup depends on the amount of data
to be stored, but EXPECT it take about 1 HOUR/40MB with the current version. 
A good suggestion would be to make the backup at night, or when you'll be out 
for a while. You can abort the backup operation by pressing the left mouse 
button. As a safety feature, the button is only sampled once every few 
seconds, so you might need to hold the button down for several seconds before 
the VBS actually aborts the operation. When the backup finishes, you 
go back to the Main Screen. Press STOP on the VCR at this time.

3.3 Filesystem Restore

This feature enables you to retrieve a part or entire file system backup. 
On restore, the original tree structure is reconstructed. You can use 
this to restore files lost after a disk crash, restore files to a 
previous state, transfer files to a different machine, etc.

3.3.1   Name of Backup to Restore

On selecting the >>Filesystem Restore<< gadget, the Name Requester pops up. 
Now, you are requested to enter the name of the filesystem backup you would 
like to restore. It is sufficient that the string you type here matches the 
first few characters of the  real name. This means that enetering nothing 
is always OK: it matches the first filesystem backup found.
Click >>OK<< to continue, >>Cancel<< gets you back to the Main Screen.

3.3.2   Restore Operation

After completing the Name Requester, the screen gets cleared and the 
text >>Searching for Filesystem:<Name> appears. Remember, you can abort at 
any time by pressing the Left Mouse Button.
Follow this procedure:
-- Wind the tape to the location of the filesystem backup to be 
   restored. Use the Go-To function to get there if your VCR has one.
-- Press PLAY on the VCR.
-- If VBS encounters a backup which doesn't have a matching name or is of a 
   different type (e.g. ADF, the message 
   >>Encountered..<< is displayed.
-- When the desired backup is found, a message saying so is
   displayed.
-- VBS then read the information that describes the tree
   structure.  This lasts only a few seconds.
-- After this, you get to the File Selection Screen. WITHIN
   5 SECONDS YOU MUST PRESS PAUSE (OR STOP) ON YOUR VCR.
-- If you want to do a full restore simply select >>Start
   Restore To ..<< from the menu. Otherwise select those files
   you wish to restore first (See Section 3.1)
-- At this stage, a requester pops up. Type the drive and 
   directory to restore to. When you're doing a full restore of
   your hard disk, this could be >>DH0:<< or >>Work:<<. In any
   case,this entry must refer to an EXISTING directory, so if
   you need to restore to a path which does not exist yet,first
   use the AmigaDOS command >>Makedir<< to create it.
-- After finishing the requester, press PLAY again on the VCR to
   continue the operation.
-- At this time, the actual files are transferred from video
   tape to your selected path. If errors occur during the operation, 
   they will be listed to the screen. VBS is able to
   continue to restore after an error occurred. As with making a
   backup, you can abort the operation by holding down the Left
   Mouse Button for awhile.
   Note: Existing files will NEVER be overwritten. VBS will 
         create the directories necessary to reconstruct the
         backup tree's structure.
-- When the restore operation finishes, press STOP on the VCR.   
   use the Left Mouse Button to get back to the Main Screen

3.4   Filesystem Verify

This command is used to compare a backup to the original data
(on disk). It will not affect your disk: it will check whether
the backup is OK.
As VBS uses an effective error-correction scheme {very}, it is
unlikely that the backup is bad. However, if you want to absolutely 
sure that your backup is good, you should use the Verify function.
The user interface of this function is equal to that of the Filesystem 
Restore feature (Section 3.3), so its operation is not repeated here.
The only difference is that data isn't written to disk, but instead, 
disk data and video data are compared. Each file that is affected by a 
verify error will be reported on-screen.

4.   Some Hints

The previous chapters were concerned with a full description of all 
features that the VBS offers. This chapter gives important
hints which enable you to get the most out of VBS.

4.1 Configuration Parameters

When you start VBS software from Workbench, it takes advantage of the 
Workbench mechanism for setting program options. This feature is called 
TOOL TYPES.  You can see the Tool Types of VBS by clicking once on its 
icon, and then selecting >>Information<< from the Workbench menu.
The Tool Types gadget is a string gadget on the Info window. It
contains entries to allow you to set SOME of the configuration
values, which have influence on the program's behaviour. There
are two arrows associated with this gadget which allow you to
scroll through the available entries. The following settings are
recognized by VBS:

LOGDIR=VBS:LogFiles
Here you can specify which directory the log files are to be kept. 
Of course, you can use any directory for saving log files if you like. 
But this will be the initial proposal in the File
Requester, which can save a lot of mouse clicks!

WORKBENCH=ON/OFF
For this entry you can specify either >>ON<< or >>OFF<<. When
it is >>ON<<, VBS leaves the Workbench open. In case it is 
>>OFF<<, the Workbench is closed on start-up of the program.
This feature is used to save memory. On 512k machines, it is 
recommended that you set this entry to >>OFF<<, since it gives
VBS some extra memory space.

LARGEFONT=melba.font-61
This specfifies the name and size of the font to use for the
large characters in the Visual Header (See Section 2.2.5) Of
course, this font must be available in the Fonts: directory
of your system.

SMALLFONT=melba.font-29
Similarly, You can indicate here which font and size to use for
small text in the Visual Header.

PADFONT=topaz.font-8
This indicates which font to use inside Pads. The term >>Pad<<
refers to windows having scroll bars at the bottom and right, used to 
show Log Files, Directory Trees and File Lists.

DISKCHANGE=ON/OFF
Normally VBS checks whether you changed the disks properly when you use 
>>Mulitple<< on floppy backups and restores. This serves to avoid  making a 
backup of the same disk twice, or restoring twice onto the same disk.
In the rare case you have non-standard drives which have trouble with the 
disk change signal, you can turn of this feature by specifying >>OFF<< here.

VIDEOCHECK=ON/OFF
This feature controls whether Video Connection Checks are to be
performed prior to each backup operation (See 2.2.2)
These checks are based on the fact that most VCR's route the incoming 
video signal at the video-in to the video-out directly when they are tuned 
to the AUX or 0 channel. When your VCR doesn't do this, set the tool 
type to >>OFF<< to disable checks.

4.2 Using the Right Tapes...
To achieve maximum security, it is recommended that you use
High Grade tapes for Video Backup purposes.
To avoid losing data, don't store tapes near a magnetic field.

4.3 Additional Hints
When experiencing problems, vary Picture Sharpness or similar
controls, if your VCR has them. Usually, a sharper picture
signal improves the backup reliablity.
During a backup operation, it is important to turn off
screen blankers or other utilities that might affect the screen
while it is being recorded. {IMPORTANT!}
For AGA chipset-equipped Amigas it has to be made sure that the VBS can 
work in a 15KHz line frequency display mode. This can be achieved by NOT 
using Mode Promotion, VGAOnly, or similar setting.

4.4 Indy speaks!
yup this puppy works well!...very happy with it
a few items i have found...it doesn't multi-task...whatever
is on your screen is what is recorded on tape..and if you hit
the Left Mouse Button...your processing aborts...period
High quality tapes work the best...i have backed up over
a gig and a half of files and not 1 unrecoverable error
(i only had 1 error at all and by rerunning the tape it
was found and restored properly)
I have provided tapes for others to restore to their systems
using their vcrs...all 4 have worked...no two models the same
i use a JVC S-VHS in plain VHS mode..a high end deck but
tapes were easily restored on no-name generic OLD two head
machines, again with no problems..and also cheap, re-recorded
demo 15 minute tapes were used and reliable...but for long
term storage...i again highly recommend HIGH GRADE TAPES
such as Memorex HG 120's  (NOT HS!)
a few of the reasons for this is data retentention for years
is better with a tape with a better base and formulation, less
shedding of particles when recording, and higher recording flux.
Make sure to store your backup video's in a safe and relatively
stable environment 60-85 degrees...not your attic or  refrigerator!...
shrinkage and expansion is an unmentioned
and often overlooked aspect of video tape storage for LONG periods of time.
Also i have used the SP mode..giving 80megs per standard
two hour tape...hey they're cheap enuf.. i may try
6hr mode to get a large drive on 1 tape...but it is sure to
be more reliable at the higher speed...
This is a cheap and reliable...albiet slow method..it is
Very effective and useful...especially if you have the time
to spare...also an easy way to exchange data..anyone want to swap tapes?
Hope this helps you as much as it has me!....Indiana Jones
