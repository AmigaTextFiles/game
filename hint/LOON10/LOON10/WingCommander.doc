NOW HEAR THIS: WORDS FROM THE EDITOR
------------------------------------

Space  is  a near vacuum as all good Academy Graduates and most two year
old  children know.  And if you ask, "If I drop a pebble into space like
I  do  into  a  pool  of  water, will it cause ripples?" you'll get some
strange looks from everyone

Nevertheless,  someone  dropped  a pebble in space not too long ago, and
we're still encounter- ing the ripples.

Last  month,  two  very  good pi lots (Lt Larry Dibbles and Captain R A.
Skinner)  went  out on a rou tine mission and didn`t come back.  Here in
Vega  Sector,  it happens all the time.  You sit for awhile; you look at
your  pal`s  empty  bunk;  you  think about where he's gone and hope you
won't  soon follow his lead; you probably get drunk.  Then, it's back to
work.

Yes, it happens all the time.

But, it's been happening a lot lately - and not just routine casualties,
but  casualties  caused by sloppi ness, over eagerness, and a variety of
other  fatal  diseases.   The  ship's  statistical  resources  show that
avoidable  casualties  are up 5% over this time last year...  and are up
9% over expected optimum per formance.  So, we`re seeing ripples.

Here's one ripple; Two pilots are gone and won't be back.

Another;  This  issue,  we`ve  asked one of the ship`s most expe rienced
pilots,  Major  James  Tag  gart (aka Paladin on the flightline) to talk
about  The  Basics; Basic tactics, goals, and maneuvers.  Even if you're
sure  you  know  the  Basics,  read what he has to say and remember that
Paladin  is  still  going  strong  after  twenty-plus  years as a combat
jockey,..   and  even  if  he  doesn't wear his Ace of Aces ribbon, it's
still there.

Another:   You  won't  be  seeing  Hornet's  Nest  from here on in.  The
strange  and  silly adventures of the TCS Hornet's Nest - a carier which
bore  an  unfortunate and unmistakable resemblance to the Tiger's Claw -
were  the  product  of  an  artist  and pilot who went by the moniker of
Tooner.   We  like  to  re-  member  Tooner  as  having a deft wit and a
diseased  mind, but all we can do is remember him.  He was also known as
Lt.  Larry Dib- bles R.I.P.

Then,  it`s  back  to work.  Also in this issue, we have the latest Vega
Sector update from Joan's Fighting Spacecraft, including the most up- to
date data on the Kilrathi ships we're facing:  an excerpt from Borg er`s
new  survev  of  Terran  and  Kil  rathi  weapons systems; and our usual
assortment  of  news,  facts,  trivia  and profiles.  Enjoy them...  but
think about them.

TAGGARTS TACTICS
----------------

How To Go Out There, Accomplish Your Objective and
(Best Of  All) Come Back Home Again

Here's  a  simple  question  from  a  simple  test.   Every fighter jock
answered hundreds of these at the Academy.

Hypothetical Situation:  You and your wingleader, flying Scimi tars, are
on a Strike mission against a Ralari-class destroyer.  En route, you see
two damaged Jalthi-class heavy fighters, the sur vivors of an engagement
which must have just ended.

Ordinarily,  you  would  not  wish  to  engage the larger fighter craft.
However,  both of these craft are in dire straits.  One is tumbling help
lessly, all stabilization hardware destroyed; the other is limping away,
his  thrusters  blasting  inter  mittently,  his  maneuvering obvi ously
impaired.   One  target  lies a few seconds to port of your flight path,
the other a few seconds to starboard.

Your  wingleader  is  not inclined to go after either of these marks; he
presses on, plodding toward the strike objective.

Question:   Do  you  (a)  keep with your wingleader, ignoring these easy
marks;  (b)  roll  out for a couple of seconds to destroy the completely
helpless  fighter;  (c)  roll  out  for a very brief engagement with the
seriously  damaged  fighter;  (d)  go after both damaged enemies; or (e)
none of the above?

If  you  answered (e), do the corps a favor; Resign your com mission and
stay  away  from  civil- ian piloting jobs.  Indecision kills faster and
more reliably than mak ing the wrong decision.

If  you  answered  (b), (c), or (d), well, everyone who's ever put on an
acceleration  suit  knows  how  you  feel.   but you know it's the wrong
answer.   It's  not  "by  the book", as boring as that may sound; you`ve
left your wingleader unguarded for a few critical sec- onds.

If you answered (a), you de- serve congratulations...  but per- haps you
don't  deserve  many.   It's  easy to pick the right, by the-book answer
when filling out a test in the placid atmosphere of your own quarters or
a  testing  hall.  It's a little tougher in the cockpit during an actual
mission.   In  the  field,  the  urge  to  mark  up  a couple more kills
especially  safe  ones,  and especially when youre only one or two kills
short  of  your  Ace  classifi cation - will often overcome your Academy
drilled by the book im pulses.

Of  course, this is only a hypo thetical situation.  Unfortunately, it's
only  hypothetical  for  you:   It  was  real  for  Captain R.A.  ("Mule
Skinner") Skinner and Lt.  Larry ("Tooner.') Dibbles.
 
Truth From the Black Box

A  month  ago  at  the  time  of  this  writing, Captain Skinner and Lt.
Dibbles  went  out  as  part  of  a  strike team assigned to destroy the
Ralari-class  destroyer  Rathiak.   They  launched  from Tiger`s Claw at
ship's   2300  hours.   At  2321  hours,  the  carrier  bridge  received
transmissions  from Skinner to Dibbles, ordering him back into position.
This was the last trans mission from either man.  Ever.

Follow  up  crews were eventu ally able to find the remains of Skinner's
Scimitar  and  its  "black  box"  flight  recorder,  and  were  able  to
reconstruct what happened from its record of radar images

The  real  scenario  unfolded  ex actly like our hypothetical situa tion
above,  Mule Skinner and Tooner ran across the scene de scribed.  Tooner
decided  for a quick kill, and spun out to engage the damaged, but still
active,  Jalthi  Class  fighter.   Mule  Skinner  or dered him back into
position  and, either presuming that Tooner would immediately turn back,
or just unwilling to abandon or delay his mission because of a some what
flaky  wingman,  pressed  on  toward  the  objective.   Tooner  did  not
immediately  turn back, prob ably planning to make just one straftng run
before turning back to rejoin his wingleader.

Unfortunately,  the  painful truth was that neither Jalthi class fighter
was damaged.

When  Lt.   Dibbles  came  within  a  reasonable assault distance of his
target, that target abruptly rolled out in controlled flight and engaged
him.   Simultaneously,  the  "dead" Kilrathi fighter powered up, stopped
spinning, and moved into position behind Captain Skinner.

To  Lt Dibbles' credit, he was able to hold off his opponent for quite a
while,  But  while he was in a dogfight with one Kilrathl, the other was
destroying  his  wingleader, Skinner's flight re corder blacks out owing
to  the  destruction of his fighter craft with the radar showing Dibbles
still in desperate combat with his opponent.

Even  without  the  benefit of Dibbles' unrecovered flight re corder, it
doesn't  take  too  much creativity to reconstruct what hap- pened next.
The second Jalthi moved in to engage Dibbles.  Be tween the two of them,
they blew Dibbles out of space

"Sometimes  you've  got to throw the book away." I hear this from pilots
both  young  and old...  and sometimes, maybe, it's true But was it true
in this case?  No Dibbles didn't have to throw the book away.  He wanted
a  kill, an other bright spot on his personal record and to obtain it he
endan gered the mission objective.

What  were  the  results of this decision?  The carrier lost two pi lots
with several years' worth of combat experience.  The carrier's commander
had to write the ap propriate letters of condolence.  The overall strike
mission  dam-  aged, but did not finish off, the de stroyer objective...
and  while it is not conclusive that the presence of Skinner and Dibbles
would  have  resulted in Rathtak's destruction, it is at least possible.
Last  of  all,  this error cost the Tiger's Claw a great morale booster:
Dibbles was the writer and artist of Hornet's Nest.  the wonderful comic
strip  which  appeared  in  every  Issue  of Claw Marks for the last two
years- Terran.

The  "Book"  you`re  trained  to go by was written for a reason.  It's a
good book, one worth following,

It`s worth reviewing now.

Basic Tactics:  A Review

Let's  go over the basic, Acad- emy standard tactics you`re sup posed to
follow in the field.

Individual Objectives

Here  is the simplest thing in the world to remember - if you're willing
to remember,

Wingleader Objective:  Ac- complish the mission objective.

Wingman  Objective:  Protect your wingleader.  If he is elimi- nated you
must accomplish the mission objective vourself

There's not much room for variation here, Oh.  a seasoned wingleader may
decide  to  trade  roles with his trainee wingman, or he might decide to
send  his  wingman  to protect a buddy who's being swarmed while he, the
wingleader,  goes  after another swarm.  But in all these cases, no body
is  solo.   If  the  two  trade  roles, we still have a wingleader and a
wingman.   If  the two split up to help friends under siege, the two are
acting  temporarily  as  wingmen  to  temporary  wingleaders.  The buddy
system is still intact.

Obviously, the important thing here is to maintain the buddy sys tem, we
live by that system.  With out it, we die.

Mission Objectives

Mission  objectives  vary  with  the different flight mission types.  On
Tiger`s  Claw,  98%  of  our  Night missions fall into these five catego
ries:

Defend:  You are assigned to guard a stationary position a capital ship,
base, or jump point.  Orbit that position at a distance of 2,500 meters.
Do  not,  repeat,  do  not  break to engage oncoming en emies until they
reach  a  distance  of 5,000 meters from the position you're protecting.
That's not 5,000 meters from you.

Escort:    You   are  assigned  to  guard  larger  ships  on  rendezvous
assignments.   Fly  parallel  to the ship you're escorting at a maxi mum
distance  of  2,500  meters.   and  keep your eyes open.  In the face of
oncoming  hostiles  don't  break  and engage too soon:  The best time to
break formation is when the hostiles have penetrated within 5,000 meters
of the ship you're protecting.

Intercept:   You are assigned to seek out and engage enemy ves sels in a
particular area - an an ticipated Kilralhi jump point or a halfway point
between   oncoming  enemnies  and  the  ship  you're  pro  tecting.   No
particular  tactics  are  called  for,  except the standard tac tics for
keeping yourself and your wingmate alive

Patrol:    You  are  assigned  to  a  night  pattern  through  unsecured
territory.   You can decide whether to engage the enemy or to head on in
to  base, -This is where a lot of Novice (and some experienced) pi- lots
make  lethal  errors:   Nobody  likes to back down.  Well, tough, Nobody
wants  to talk to your widow or widower, either.  Consider the situation
carefully before en gaging the enemy.

Strike:   You are assigned to destroy an enemy target, usually a capital
ship.  Obviously, the idea is to get in quick, launch missiles, blow the
thing up and get out quicker.  Unfortunately, the enenmy usually decides
to   defend   any   tar   get   worth   destoying,  this  is  where  the
wingleader/wingman  relation  ship  becomes  especially  critical:   The
wingleader  must get his mis siles placed, and the wingman must keep him
alive so be can do it.  This means that, at the cost of his own personal
objectives, the wingman must stick to his wingleader like glue, take out
on-  coming  fighters  before  they can take out his wingleader and only
drop his own missiles if he has a clear opportunity

First Contact
 
When  you  first  encounter  a flight of enemy fighter craft they will
almost  always  be  flying in for mation.  Once initial contact has been
made,  they  will  break  forma  tion  in  pairs at roughly four sec ond
intervals.   Generally  you should likewise break formation to match and
engage them.

All  of this leads to the question of what to do once you've engaged the
Kilrathi,  the  Book  has  some  thing to say about that, as we dis cuss
immediately below.

Maneuvering

Twenty  years  of  fighting  the  Kilrathi  have  shown  us  some  basic
maneuvering  tactics  which im prove your chances of survival.  In other
words,  until your personal flying instincts give you a tactic for every
situation,  go  with  these  "by-  the book" maneuvers and you'll have a
better  chance  of  making it home in one piece.  All the Book can do is
tip  the odds a bit in your favor, but the record shows that this slight
improvement  in  your  chances  is worth the embarrass ment you may feel
about doing something the way you were taught at the Academy.

Standard Maneuvers

You  learned  all  of  these in ba sic flight training, but let`s review
them here.  In addition to standard turns, rolls, dives, and climbs, you
became familiar with these:

Burnout:   Hit  the afterburners and increase speed until your pur- suer
is  no longer gaining on you or the afterburners finish their burn, then
perform  as  tight  a  180°  turn  as you can handle:  if your target is
within your cone of fire, open up on him.

Fishhook:  Calculate the new heading you want.  Turn to a head ing which
is  at  a  180°  angle off that figure, then almost immedi- ately make a
180°  turn  to  your course of choice.  For instance, if you are on a 0°
course  and  want  to  make  a 90° left turn, you first make a 90° right
turn, then follow up immediately with a 180° turn.

Hard  Brake:   Reduce  forward  velocity  as quickly as you can.  If you
brake  sooner,  harder, and bet ter than your pursuer, he will overshoot
you and enter your cone of fire, Open up on him.

Kickstop:   Make  a  hard  90°  turn  in any direction and hold your new
course  for  a  moment.   If your pursuer overshoots and doesn't turn in
your wake, 180° spin back and open fire,

Roll:  Close on your target while performing a corkscrew roll.

Shake:   Also  called  Zig-Zag,  Perform  back  and  forth  45° eva sive
maneuvers  while  closing  on  a target.  Varying between Shake and Roll
tactics while closing is usually termed a Shake, Rattle, and Roll,

Sit-'n'-Kick:   An  evasive  ma  neuver  especially useful against large
ships.   Make a 90° turn in any direction.  Shut off engines and spin to
face your target:  open fire, then, make another random 90° turn and hit
your afterburners,

Sit-'n'-Spin:   Kill your engines and perform a 360° spin, firing on any
targets that enter your cone of fire.  Once you've spun to your original
course, re-engage engines and continue

Tail:  You all know how to tail a target ship, But don't forget:  Un til
you're  sure  of  your most effec- tive tailing range, try to maintain a
range of 1000 meters, the "by the book" range.

Tight  Loop:   Perform a mini mum radius turn in any direction until you
resume  the  course you held at the beginning of the ma neuver "Properly
performed"  this will put you behind your pursuer" or at least shake him
off your tail for a moment.

Turn-'n'-Spin:   This  is  like  the Kickstop, except that you also kill
engine power.

Evasion Tactics

With  that  review of maneuvers fresh in our mind, let`s review eva sion
tactics  for  combat  situations.   Yes, aggressiye tactics will let you
rack  up the kills, but evasive tac tics will keep you alive so that you
can rack up the kllls.

Here`s the situation:  You have an enemy to your rear, and you're in his
sights.  what now?

If  you  have  a  critical target in your sights, and you know that your
pursuers  guns are not going to crack your shell with one hit, then it`s
permissible  -  barely  -  for you to take that hit, drop your load, and
then  come around to deal with your attacker.  In any case, dont do this
unless you`re within 2,500 meters of your target

If you don't have that critical target in your sights, or you don't know
that you can take a direct hit, then evade.

Evading  involves  a pretty com plicated series of decisions you have to
learn to make by reflex.

If you have better maneuver ability than your pursuer, try a Tight Loop,
Kickstop,  or Fishhook, If you`re hurt, though, and prefer not to mix it
up, you can try to evade with a Turn `n` Kick or any hard turn , if your
acceleration is better than the enemy"s.  If it isn"t" try any number of
hard turns and rolls, and hope for the best.

If  your  pursuer  has  better  ma  neuverability  than you but you have
superior  acceleration, try a Burnout Or a Hard Brake, and prepare to be
very accurate with ship`s weapons.

If  your  pursuer has better ma neuverability aad acceleration than you,
you  have a problem.  If you want to make it a slugging match, try a Sit
`n`  Spin  or  Turn  `n`  Spin.  If you`re already hurt, try any sort of
evasive  maneuver  you  can  zig  zags,  hard  turns,  and  rolls.  In a
succession  of  different di rections, and pray, because you`re going to
need some divine intervention.

Last Notes

There`s  no  sure  way,  no  sure tactic, to keep you alive on a Com bat
mission.   You  may be good, but so are the Kilrathi.  Somebody`s got to
win, and somebody will prob ably die.

The  Book,  sneered  at  by  up  and coming aces, is nothing more than a
manual which teaches you how to slant the odds in your fa- vor.  It says
nothing  more  than  this:  "Protect your wingman and he`ll protect you.
Learn these tac- tics and they'll improve your chances, "that's all"

And just remember:  You`re-not the only one who wants your chances to be
improved.   Your  Wingman  does.  Your commander does, Your family does.
Ultimately,  the  entire Terran Confederation does.  Because if we fail,
our  people  and  our  planets  will  end up "pro- tected" by pilots who
proved  them-  selves  better than us, fliers who showed they could beat
us:  The warriors of the Empire of Kilrah.

Vega Sector Supplement For 2654.092

This  is  the latest update for Joan`s Fighting Spacecraft, specifically
revised  for  Terran  per  sonnel  in  the Vega Sector.  This supplement
contains   the   latest  specifications  on  both  Terran  and  Kilrathi
spacecraft, particularly the types of craft most commonly encountered in
this sector.

All   servicemen   are   urged  to  familiarize  themselves  with  these
specifications.

Computer files of this material are avail able in the ship`s library, at
> > Reference > > Technical > > Hardware > > Joan`s > >.

Here  is  a  quick  guide  for  those of you un familiar with the Joan`s
system of evaluation.

Maximum Velocity/Cruise Velocity

These  are the settings to which a ship`s speed governors are set.  This
is  always  a relative ve locity:  a ship's computer sets it relative to
(a)  the  flagship, (b) an escorted vessel, (c) a nearby planetary body,
(d)  a  Conferation bea con, or (e) a value derived from radar positions
of  all  vislble  ships.   The  velocity  is expressed in kilometers per
second.

Acceleration

This  shows  the  Joan`s  evaluation  of  the  ships  acceleration rate,
described as "Bad", "Poor", "Average", "Good", or "Excellent."

Maximum Yaw, Pitch, and Roll

These characteristics are expressed in degrees per second (dps)

Ship`s Armor

Joan`s   evaluation  of  a  ship`s  defensive  armour  is  expressed  in
centimeters  thickness  of  Dura  steel.  Fore and Aft Shield values are
given in values equivalent to centimeters thickness of Durasteel.

WEAPONS
-------

What  Joans  does  for ships, Ivan Borger does for weapons systems.  The
following  excerpt  from  Borgers  All  The  Sectors  Weapons Systems is
presented as a crash course for those new to the fighting front.

Dumb Fire Missile 
The  Dumb  Fire  missile  is a point and shoot weapon just aim it at the
target  and  hope  the  target can't get out of the way.  With no homing
capability  the  Dumb Fire is most effective in the hands of a pilot who
can  anticipate  the  target's  reactions  When  possible  it  should be
reserved for use in close quarters or against slow moving targets.

Heat-Seeking Missile
The  engines  of a modern space fighter or capital ship generate alot of
heat  a  fact  the  heat seeking missile uses to great advantage.  All a
pilot  has  to  do is park himself on an enemy's tail, wait for the heat
seeker  to  lock  and  then  fire.   (NOTE:  If the target shakes a heat
seeker,  the missile locks onto the nearest heat source perhaps even the
ship that originally fired it!)

Image Recognition Missile
To  fire an image recogni.  tion missile, the pilot must keep the target
in  view for several seconds, after which the missile memorizes the ship
type in the pilot's sights.  Once the image recognition missile locks it
doesnt  let  go  -  it  tracks  the  targeted  ship  like  a very lethal
bloodhound.
 
Friend or Foe Missile
The friend or foe missile locks onto the nearest enemy ship.  Capable of
identifying  the  distinc tive signal broadcast by all Terran ships, the
friend or foe makes a bee-line for the nearest ship whose communicatians
systems are damaged.  Even the firing ship is not safe)

Laser Cannon
Lasers don't do a lot of damage.  Still, nearly all pilots have at least
one story in which the long range of the laser allowed them to get first
strike  on  a  foe.   Despite  their  low  damage  potential  lasers are
reliable,  versatile  and  effective  - they have probably accounted for
more enemy kills than any other weapon.

Neutron Guns
Neutron  guns  do  heavy  damage,  but  only  at  close range.  No other
projectile   weapon   provides   an   equivalent  level  of  destructive
capability.   The down side is that the neutron guns heat up rapidly and
eat  up power at an alarming rate.  Also the neutron gun's lack of range
has led many fool-hardy or underskilled pilots into close quarter combat
for  which  they  were ill prepared.  Some of those pilots never made it
home.
 
Mass Driver Cannon
The  basic  fighter weapon, medium range, medium damage, nothing special
The  mass  driver  weapon  is  reliable and accurate.  Heat build up and
power  drain  are  minimal.   Though  lasers  and  neutron guns are more
effective  in  certain situations, no pilot ever went wrong activating a
mass driver.

Porcupine Mines
These  deadly  devices  have  limited  homing  capability  and  built in
proximity  sensors,  detonation  does`nt  require contact.  If there`s a
Kilrathi on your tail, just open up your rear doors and drop a Porcupine
in  his  path.   He`ll be off your tail in no time.  Or he`ll be dead...
If  you ever see one of these irregular spheres tumbling your way, punch
the throttle and steer clear.

Flak Guns
Fighters provide the bulk of the ships defense, but the largest ships in
the  Terran  and  Kilrathi fleets lay down heavy flak barrages which can
bring down any ship in space.

Turreted Lasers
Terran  and  kilrathi  destroyers, cruisers, dreadnoughts, carriers, and
bases  are  equipped  with  heavy  turreted  lasers  linked  to advanced
targetting systems.  Only the most maneuverable ships have any chance of
surviving concentrated fire from these formidable weapons.

PILOT PROFILES
--------------

The Unstoppable Force
1st  Lt.  Tanaka Mariko goes by the tag of Spirit a rough translation of
Kami,  as she`s called by the Japanese pilot instructors responsible for
her  ini  tial  training.   In  the  cockpit,  Spirit  is  known for her
deceptive,  defensive  piloting, her ability to sense and avoid incoming
fire,  and  her  habit  of  creeping in as close as possible to a target
before cutting loose with ship`s weaponry.

A native of Sapporo on the Japanese island of Hokkaido.Tanaka is a third
generation    military   pilot.    Her   father,   Major   Tanaka   Shun
(affectionately  remembered  as  Go Devil), died twenty years ago in the
brutal McAuliffe ambush of `34.

The  24 year old ace explains...  I did not join the armed forces for re
venge.   I  have  no  fantasies of personally gunning down the pilot who
killed  my father.  It is a matter of tradition and duty.  The tradition
is  my  families  and  the duty is to the Earth...,I am often asked if I
think  of  my  self  as  a  modern  samurai.   The answer is no.  I am a
military  pilot,  not a feudal retainer.  But there is nothing to keep a
modern pilot, Japanese or not from trying to adhere to the best elements
of  the warrior codes of the past:  The code of the samurai, the Code of
the knight errant, any code of honour and service.

Loose Cannon On Deck
Captain  Ian  St.  John" or Hunter to the spacecrews, is one of the best
pitots  in  the service.  and has racked up a impressive number of kills
in the years he has been stationed on the Tiger`s Claw.  He`s known as a
seat  of  the  pants flier, and Kitrathi opponents tend to be baffled by
his un predicable, spontaneous flying style.

The  27  year  old native of Brisbane, Australia is sometimes accused of
excessive independence and a casual attitude toward regulations.  "Maybe
So"  he  explains  "but I`d never leave my wingleader hanging.  However,
every  (expletive  deleted)  thing we`re given ships, weapons, training,
an`  standing  regs - is there for us to push to the limit, an` a little
further, if we`re going to get the job done.

Notice  I say push to the limit, an` not break.  `Maybe there`s not much
of a difference but usually the difference between dusting a furball an`
sucking vacuum.

Leader By Example
Major  Chen  Kien is known as Bossman to the spacecrews, but that wasn`t
always the case.

"When I was young-er, younger they called me Ripper my old friends still
do.   I  was  a lot like Hunter, pushing everything to the limit.  But I
might  have  been  a  little  too  good,  or  at  least  lucky,  at  it.
Replacement crews coming in, bright young second looies, took my lead...
and  got  themselves  shot to hell.  When I started burying young pilots
who  had  been  killed  for  behaving like me, I decided to give them an
example  that  would  not  get them blown out of space.  It is sort of a
vicious  cycle:   You  try  to act as an example, and young pilots start
coming to you for advice.  That is when they started calling me Bossman.
I  do  not  regret all these changes....  but there are times I miss the
old days.

The   39  year  old  native  of  Kaohsiung,  Taiwan,  has  a  degree  in
aeronautical  engineering  from the Confederation Net university system.
He  is  married  to  ergonomics  engineer Chen Mingxing and, last March,
became the father of a baby girl.

Ace Of Aces
Major  Michael  Casey,  or  Iceman  to  the  crews,  has  racked up more
confirmed  kills  while serving on the Tiger`s Claw than any other pilot
in  the  carrier`s  history.  In the cockpit, he is known for calm under
fire,  letter  perfect  flying  technique,  and  deadly  aim with ship`s
weapons,  a  combina  tion  which  guarantees disaster for Kilrathi oppo
nents.

Angel,  frequent  wingman  for Iceman, de scribes flying with him:  "You
must  learn  to  listen for Iceman.  On the comm unit, in a large engage
ment,  everyone is either shouting or at least very excitable; Iceman is
whispering.   You  have  to  strain  your ears to hear him.  It`s always
terse little statements:  Moving in.  `Rolling right.  `Target in sight.
`Objective  accomplished.`  Head  for  home..   And I will tell you:  He
talks ten times as much in the cockpit as he ever talks on the carrier"

Iceman is 31, a native of Vancouver, British Columbia.

By The Book - Or Else
"I  cannot  stand  `rebels`  or  hot  doggers, or any of these so called
intuitive  know-it  alls, explains Captain Jeannette Devereaux, who goes
by  the cockpit moniker of Angel.  "We have used flying craft in warfare
since  1914.  As a race, we have nearly eight centuries of combat flying
experience,  and  we`ve  had nearly eight centuries to define, re- fine,
and  perfect the rules by which we fly.  These are rules desired to keep
us alive, keep our wingmen alive, and win our wars, n`est ce pas?

"But  every class that comes out of the Academy is stuffed full of these
talented  fliers who think that, because they can do new and interesting
things with their machines, they must be smarter than eight centuries of
military thinkers..  and so the rules don`t apply to them.  They shut up
fast  when they start seeing their class mates eat missiles and it is at
that  point  they join the human race and begin to contribute to winning
this war."

The  28  year  old  Devereaux  is a native of Brussels, Belgium.  She is
widely  known  for  her  marksmanship;  Her  accomplishments with ship`s
weapons dot the Tiger`s Claw performance records.

New Kid On The Block
Fresh from the Academy is 2nd Lt.  Todd Marshall, known as Maniac by his
graduating class.

Marshall,  23,  tries  hard to live up to his moni ker.  "Plodding along
with your joystick in one hand and a copy of the naval regs in the other
is  not  going  to  impress the Kilrathi" he says.  "They know our regs.
They  know the Book" they know how we do things".  If we`re going to put
them  on  the  ropes,  we  have  to adapt our rules, tactics, and flying
styles.   We have to outfly them, outfight them...  we`ve got to want it
more.  And I want it.

"I`m  a  Proxie  -  Homeworld  Leto,  Proxima  Centauri  IV.   When  the
colonization started anyone with any brains or skills high-tailed it off
Earth,  and  most  of  them  ended  up on Leto.  That`s why Proxies kick
homeborn Terrans around in the ratings."

Despite  his creative interpretation of colonial history and comparative
Naval  Standings,"  Marshall  was  one  of  the  highest  rated  Academy
graduates  of  the `54 class and promises to be a worthy addition to the
Tigers Claw pilot roster.

A Professionals Professional
"The  laddies coming out of the Academy think I was born old" says Major
James  Taggart"  who is known as Paladin to the spacecrews.  "But when I
took  my  commission  not  too  long  after we dis covered the Empire of
Kilrah  I  was  just  a  kid.   I  was  charged  up on stories of knight
errantry, on The Death of Arthur and The Song of Roland.  So when we ran
into  the  Kilrathi,  I  knew I was going to grab up a lance, hop into a
cockpit,  and  change  the  course  of history.  Naturally "he jokes" "I
did."

Taggart,  45,  is  a  native of Ares" the self-suffi cient space station
built  in  permanent  orbit  around  the  planet Venus; his parents were
terraforming engineers from Wick, Scotland.

Though  an  effective  wingleader, Taggart is especially appreciated for
his  wingman skills.  He has a reputation for protectiveness when flying
wing.   On an average of three times a year, pranksters get to his space
craft  scape  the  name  "Paladin"  from his cockpit and replace it with
"Mother Hen"

"Appreciate it while you can" he grins.  "Combat flying is a young man`s
game  and  I`m  having  trouble convincing the medics that I`m still 25.
I`ll  be  flying  a  desk  before  too  long...   If  I can and one with
afterburn ers and smart missiles.

Reliability Under Fire 
Captain  Joseph  Khumalo,  known to the crews as Knight, admits that his
piloting accomplishments don`t dot the record books.  "I`m not a cockpit
ge nius like Hunter or a marksman like Angel.  I`m an ordinary man.  I`m
a pilot.  It`s my job.

Yet  wingleaders tend to breathe a sigh of relief when they draw Khumalo
as wingman.  Knight has a reputation of utter reliability in combat.  "I
got  my  nickname  in  the Enyo Engagement".  The Kilrathi were swarming
like  flies",  I was a second looie assigned as wingman to Captain Maria
`la  Dona  Alvarez.   We  were  hurting  the  deck of this transport and
strafing  it, did a tight turn going from its back to its belly, and ran
right  through  a swarm of fighters headed the other way.  Any defensive
maneuvering  in  those  quarters  would`ve cut me off from la Dona, so I
just  fired  as fast as I could, and got lucky:  I was an ace coming out
of  that  pack,  and  had picked off a couple of fighters going after my
wingleader,  La  Dona put on her thickest accent and said "Ooh, eet`s my
White Knight" and the name stuck.

But  honestly,  I  don`t feel that way.  I`m not a knight errant.  I`m a
soldier.  Not all of us can be geniuses...  but I`m going to do the best
I  can  with  what  I  can".   Khumalo,  36, hails from Kroonstad, South
Africa.

Keen Competitor
Best  known among the Kilrathi aces is Bhurak, called Bhurak Starkiller.
He  is  regarded  as  the  best  living pilot among the Kilrathi in this
sector.

He flies a Salthi Class Light Fighter.
 
Strengths:   Bhurak`s  an  excellent  pilot  and shot.  He has optimal
reflexes  and  there  are  no  se rious weaknesses to be detected in his
flying style

Weaknesses:  Psych profiles indicate that Bhurak is probably addicted to
speed,  thrills,  and  sport.  Though a courageous pilot, he is not with
out  a  survival instinct; A sufficient number of op ponents or a sudden
turn in fortune could panic him into retreat.

Tactics:   Bhurak likes the dogfight.  He prefers a maneuverable foe and
standard  dogfight  tactics.   He  almost  always  uses his ship`s laser
cannon, reserving his standard dumb fire missile for stationary targets.

Recommendation:   If  possible,  put several pilots on him at once; deny
him  a  fair  fight or anything he would consider fun.  He might be come
disgruntled  and  choose another target, or rout.  If you`re forced into
single  combat  with him, don`t try to outfly him:  You might do best by
go  ing  stationary,  spinning  to  keep him in your sights, and trading
licks.   He  does`nt  appear  to  consider that fun and-may choose a new
objective.

Cold As A Vacuum
Khajja  the Fang is not so affectionately called "the Machine" by Terran
intelligence.   He  is  the  most  efficient, mission oriented pilot the
Kilrathi have.

He pilots a Krant Class Medium Fighter.

Strengths:   Khajja`s  greatest  asset  is his clear thinking.  He never
panics  or  falters and appears to have utter confidence in his wingmen.
He is not vulnerable to taunts, goads, or insults

Weaknesses;  Khajja`s  faith  in his wingmen may be misplaced.  Analysis
indicates  that  some  Kilrathi  pilots  may  be afraid of him.  He will
single  mindedly  ignore  incoming  ships  in  order to concentrate on a
strike ob jective, meaning he might ignore you.

Tactics:   Khajja prefers straight in, straight out strafing approaches.
He uses his laser cannon for most encounters, saves his heat seekers for
mission  objectives  or  particularly troublesome enemies, and saves his
friend or foe missile for emergencies.

Recommendation:   If he`s approaching a mission objective, you might get
a  free  shot by eluding his wingmen.  If he`s moving in on you, utilize
classic  dogfight  tactics;  Try to outfly and outshoot him, or lead him
towards unengaged friendlies.  He doesn`t like bad odds.

Extreme Prejudice
Dakhath,  whose  name translates literally as Deathstroke, is one of the
most  dangerous pilots alive.  According to our (incomplete) records, he
has  55+  confirmed  kills  on  file.   He pilots a Dralthi Class Medium
Fighter.

Strengths:   Dakhath  appears  to  be  utterly  without  fear.  He never
retreats from an engage- ment until every enemy within 1000 klicks is de
stroyed,  and  will  not  abandon  a  wounded  enemy until that enemy is
destroyed.   This  courage  and lack of self preservation instincts make
him  par  ticularly  dangerous.   So  does  his  apparent  affection for
inflicting pain.

Weaknesses:   Dakhath  lives only to kill and will not retreat or change
targets  until  his  first  target  is dead, if at all possible, use his
single  mindedness  against  him...   if only by leading him away from a
strategically important target so that he can concentrate on you.

Tactics:   Dakhath launches his missiles at maximum range (he appears to
like explosions), then closes for the kill on one target.  He will cling
to  that target until he destroys it, then choose another, as methodical
as clock circuits.

Recommondation:   It might be possible to lead him into the path of fire
friendly  to  you  and is equally possible that he won`t notice new pur-
suit on him until it`s too late.  (Important Note:  If your ship takes a
lot of damage and looks shaky, do not eject if you`re in the vicinity of
Dakhath.  One of his hobbies is target practice against ejecting pilots)

Danger And Distain
Bakhtosh  Redclaw  is  a  rash  on the comm utilts; he is best known for
extremely sarcastic gloating during combat engagements.  It appears that
he  belongs  to  an aristocratic Kilrathi family and has been trained in
the  politics  of superiority from birth.  He flies a Jalthi Class Heavy
Fighter.

Strengths:  Bakhtosh is the best Kilrathi shot in Vega Sector, bar none.
His  accuracy  with  ship`s guns is becoming legendary even among Terran
pilots,  which  is  another strength; Some Terrans feel intimidated when
confronting   the  legendary  Bakhtosh  and  consequently  their  flying
suffers.   Additionally,  he  is  a  master  of the crowning insult, the
patronizing remark, and the racial slur.  He often goads Terran fighters
into bad tactical errors.

Weaknesses:  Bakhtosh`s piloting is nothing special.  Like one legendary
figure  of  Terran  combat  aviation,  the Red Baron, he is an excellent
marksman  but  a  mediocre  flier.  Additionally, his insults and better
than  thou  atittude are not a pose:  he believes himself to be superior
to all Kilrathi as well as all humans.

Tactics:   Bakhtosh  prefers  to fire at a distance.  He will get at the
maximum  effective  range for his weapons and chew his target to pieces.
The  extra  distance allows him a little time to cope with the maneuvers
of  superior flyiers.  If forced to close with a foe, he will launch one
of his missiles

Recommendation:   Close,  firing continuously, then try to outfly him in
standard fashion.  Do not be daunted by his substantial reputation.

PLAYING WING COMMANDER
======================

Starting the Game

After  loading,  the  title/credit sequence appears.  The credits repeat
until you press a key.  Then you will be asked if you want to "Start New
Compaign" or "Continue Compaign".  First time users should select "Stort
New  Compoign".  If you have already played Wing Com- mander and wish to
continue with a saved character, choose "Continue Compaign".

You  begin  the  game seated at the controls of the TrainSim unit in the
bar  of  the  Tiger's  Clow, the carrier on which your character serves.
Almost  im- mediately, your ship will explode and the words "Gome Over",
will   oppear  in  the  view  window  of  the  TrainSim.   You  will  be
congratulated for a high score, and asked to input your name.  Enter the
last name and callsign you want your character to go by during the game.
Then return to the view of the bar of the Tiger's Claw

In the Bar
 
The  bar  is  the  favorite gathering spot for the crew of the Tiger's
Claw  and  the perfect place to hear the latest scuttle- butt on current
events  in  the Vega Sec tor.  While in the bar, you can select from the
following options:

The  TrainSim:  At the far left of the bar is the TrainSim unit, a video
game/  training  simulator.   Select  it  and  you  find yourself in the
simulator`s  hot  seat.  After viewing the top scores, you are presented
with  a screen of four Kilrothi enemy Fighter-craft.  Select the foe you
want  to fight.  This sets the difficulty level of the game - the Solthi
(upper  left)  is  the  easiest opponent, followed by the Dralthi (lower
left),  and  the  Krant  (upper right).  The Gratha (lower right) is the
toughest  enemy ship type in the TrainSim.  Select your opponent and you
find yourself on a training flight against the Kilrathi.

The TrainSim unit is a safe, painless opportunity to learn the basics of
flying   and   combat.   Certain  game  functions  (eg,  navigation  and
communication) are disabled in the TrainSim, but its still a good way to
brush up your skills, try a new moneuver, or just fly for the fun of it.
TrainSim  missions are timed and you receive bonus points for destroying
waves  of  ships  quickly.  Try to beat your wingman's high Scores.  For
details  on  using  the  cockpit equipment (most of which appears in the
TrainSim cockpit as well as in the real ships) see In the Cockpit, below

Talking  to  People:  You`ll always find the bartender and, usually, one
or  two  pilots  in the bar.  Talk with every one you can you never know
who  will have clues and information helpful to you.  The table reserved
for wingmen is on the right side of the screen.

The Pilots` Scores chalkboard:  Above the table is a blockboard.  Select
it  to  see  how  the  game`s  pilots  are do- ing in the campaign game,
relative  to  one another.  The number of missions flown and total kills
are displayed.

Barracks  Door:   On  the far right of the bar is the doorwoy leading to
the barracks.  Select it to get to the next stage of the game.

In the Barracks

Bar:  On the far left of the barracks is the hallway leading back to the
bar.   When  you  want  to  return there (to use the TrainSim, engage in
conversation, and so forth), select this area.

Bunks  (Saved  Gomes):   In  the middle of the barracks are eight bunks,
They`re  not  just decoration.  They're the means to save and load games
if your system allows this (See your Reference Card for details)

Airlock:   In the rear wall of the bar racks is an airlock.  Moving your
pointer over it brings up a message asking if you want to quit the Game.
Se- lecting the airlock returns you to your computer`s operating system

Mission  Hangar:   To the far right is the doorway to the Mission Hanger
Selecting it takes you to your next com- bat mission

Mission Hangar

Selecting  Mission  Hanger  puts  you into the briefing room.  There you
receive  or-  ders  from Colonel Halcyon, including your objective, your
novigation route, and your wingman assignment.  In Wing Commander you`re
always the wingleader and as long as you keep your wingman alive, you`ll
always have a wingman

Don`t  worry  about writing down details of your navigation route; it`ll
be loaded into your ship`s computer auto_ matically.

After  being  dismissed  from  the  Mis-  sion  Briefing,  you go into a
cinematic  sequence  that  takes  you  to  the  ship`s hanger, into your
fighter, and through the launch sequence.

In the Cockpit

Now  you`re  in  your  fighter`s  cockpit  The wide array of information
screens  available  to you may seem a little in timidating at first, but
reading them quickly becomes second nature

When you launch, you see space through your ship's front viewscreen

You  can  also  select  side  and  rear  views,  as well as chase plane,
missile, tactical, and cinematic views.

During  a  Wing  Commander campaign you will have the opportunity to fly
four  types  of  ship.   Though  each  cockpit  has a slightly different
arrangement  for  information  screens,  they all have the same screens.
Refer to the diagrams in this section for the layout of each cockpit.

Viewscreen:  The viewscreen and Heads up display provide a clear view of
space  directly ahead of you.  A circle with crosshairs shows where your
ship`s  guns  are  aimed; brackets indicate the position of the ship you
currently have targeted.  Naturally you`ll want to maneuver the brackets
when  you  fire  your  ship`s guns.  When other vessels communicate with
you, colored brackets appear around them.

Radar  Display:   The  circular  screen  in  every  cockpit is its radar
display.   Unlike most radar displays; this one doesn`t show you how far
away  targets are but, instead, how far you have to rotate to bring them
into your front viewscreen.

The radar display is divided into six sections.  Radar contacts are dis-
played as dots.  The outermost ring shows the position of enemies behind
you;  the  center circle shows the position of enemies ahead of you; and
the four middle sections represent enemy posi- tions alongside and above
or below you.

Tactical  Tip:   To  head  toward a tar get, select the dot representing
that  tar get on the radar display and maneuver your ship until that dot
is  centered in the inner most circle of the display.  A dot centered in
the  radar  display  represents  a  ship  directly  ahead of you in your
viewscreen.

Left  VDU  (Video  Display  Unit):  On the left VDU is a profile of your
fighter, showing your ship's status

You  can  cycle  through  screens dis playing damage your ship has taken
Damaged systems appear in a different color, along with a description of
the system

You  can  change  your  ship's  active gun, if you have more than one to
choose from.  The "full Guns" option fires all guns at once.

You  can  also  change  your  active weapon delivery system (missiles or
mines), if you have more than one to choose from.

Right  VDU  (Video Display Unit):  The right VDU has several func tions.
Here,  you can display the Target ing Screen, which indicates the status
of the ship you are currently targeting

This screen appears automatically when you fire your ship`s guns or when
you select the targeting feature

In  addition,  you can display range information when navigation mode is
active

Finally, the right VDU functions as a Communication Screen, showing both
your  communications  options  and, on some systems, incoming video from
other  ships  when  they  talk  to  you.  See In Flight Systems and your
reference card for details.

Armour  and  Shield  Indicator:   Small bars on this screen indicate the
status  of  your  ship`s  armour  and  shields.  These bars disappear as
armour and shields take damage.  Shields gradually regenerate unless the
shield  generator  is  destroyed.  Once damage gets through the shields,
armor begins taking damage and won`t regenerate

Fuel  Indicator:  This bar shows how much fuel you have; the bar becomes
shorter as you use up fuel.  Afterburners boost your speed dramatically,
but  use up fuel at a ferocious rate, so use them sparingly.  If you run
out  of fuel you will only be able to coast on reserves at a speed of 50
KPS.

Speed  Indicator:   The  Speed  In- dicator may be one gauge or two, de-
pending  on  your cockpit type, "Set Speed" shows the speed your fighter
will  try  to  maintain  on  its  own  (like  the  cruise  control on an
automobile),   "KPS"   shows   your  ship`s  current  speed,  in  klicks
(kilometers) per second.
 
Tactical Tip:  The safest speed for negotiating asteroid fields is 250
KPS.

Blaster  Indicator:   This Gauge shows the power level of your ship`s ac
tive  gun.   Frequent use of the gun runs down your blaster power.  Your
guns  will  not  fire  if you have no blaster power.  Guns recover power
gradually, and recovery is slowed if your shields are also regenerating.

Eject   Warning:    This  light  flashes  if  your  ship  has  sustained
significant  damage.   When  the eject warning starts flashing, you must
decide how serious the situation is and whether to eject or not.  If you
decide  to  eject,  the  Confed  eration  will suffer from the loss of a
starfighter, but you will live to fight an other doy
 
In-Flight Systems

Targeting  System:   When  the  Targeting  Screen  is  up, it displays a
profile  of the ship you have targeted, along with any damage the target
may have sustained

To  target  a  ship,  position  it in the center of your view screen and
activate the ship's targeting feature.  Brackets appear around the enemy
ship.   Nor  mally,  you  lose  the  lock  on a target you are no longer
facing.  If you want to keep a target locked even when you`re not facing
it, select "Lock Target" (See Reference Card for details,)

Tactical  Tip:   If  you`ve  just dis patched an enemy in the midst of a
crowded  dogfight,  and  you  don`t  wont  to divert attention from your
viewscreen  to  look  at the radar, just set your fighter into a spin or
tight  turn.   Out  of the cor ner of your eye, you can see whenever the
right  VDU  switches  from  its  neutrel status to the Targeting Screen.
Even  if  the  next target is so far ahead of you that you con`t see the
torgeting  brack-  ets,  or it is just out of sight (left, right, up, or
down  from  where you`re cur- rently looking), the Targeting Screen will
come up and you`ll know you`re facing an enemy

Navigatian  System:   In  Naviga  tion  Mode,  the Nav screen shows your
currently  selected  Nav point and the distance you must travel to reach
that  objective.  Selecting Navigation a sec ond time brings up the full
screen.   Navi-  gation  map, so that you can give it a good look.  When
you`re  in  the Nav Map, game can study the mission in as much detail as
you want, for as long as you want

Each  mission  you  fly  consists of several objectives at different Nav
points.   You  can  move  the  pointer  to any Nav point in your current
mission.

When  you point at something, it will be highlighted, and notes about it
will  ap-  pear  on  the  left  side  of the Nav map You can also scroll
through the Nav points and the information about them.

You  may  examine  any  Nav point, but when you have highlighted the ob-
jective  you  are  expected  to  tackle  next in your mission, the words
"Mission flight Path'" appear on the right side of the Nav map

When  you  return to the cockpit screen, the last Nav point you selected
becomes your new destination auto- matically

When  you  reach a Nav point, the navigation computer intelligently (and
automatically)  selects  the  next  assigned Nav point for you.  You can
either  fly  there or anywhere else) manually or activate the auto-pilot
and let it take you to your next objective,

Tactical  Tip:   The  Nav  map is drawn in only two dimensions, so it is
possible  for your ship to appear right on a Nav point while your ship`s
systems  tell  you  you`re  thousands  of  kilo-  meters  away from your
objective.   This  simply  means that you are "above" or "below" the Nav
point.

Autopiloting  System:   When  you  activate  Navigation Mode, crosshairs
appear  on  your  radar  display  and  in  your  heads-up  display.  The
crosshairs  on  the  radar  screen represent the location of the current
selected Nav point relative to your starfighter.  To reach your selected
destination,  maneuver  your ship until these crosshairs are centered in
their  respective  displays  You can fly to the destination manually, by
keeping the crosshairs centered, but this may take a while

You  can  shorten  the  trip by activating the autopilot if there are no
hazards  (enemy  ships,  asteroids, or mines) in the area.  When this is
the case, the auto pilot light (marked "auto") Goes On Select autopilot,
and  your  ship,  wing man and any escorted ships form up and proceed to
the  destination auto- matically.  If you encounter any enemy vessels or
hazards  (asteroids,  etc,)  on  the  way,  you leave the autopilot mode
before you encounter the hazards.

Autopilot  automatically  disengages  e  few  thousand  meters from your
destination

Communications System:

When  you  activate  the  Communication Screen, you are presented with a
screen showing a menu of potential re- cipients for your message.

Select a receiver, and another menu appears listing the messages you can
send.    The  communications  system  intelligently  determines  who  is
eligible  to  receive a message from you and what messages you can send.
If there is only one pilot who could receive your communication, no menu
is presented and the message goes to the sole eli gible recipient

When  other pilots decide to send a message to you, a box appears around
their ship in your viewscreen,

Wingmen sometimes disobey, but you can give them the following orders:

1) Break and Attack - A command to leave formation and engage
   enemy ships within 12000 meters

2) Keep formation - Denies a wingman`s request to break and
   attack on his own initiative.
 
3) Form on My Wing - Return to formation and follow your vessel

4) Return to Base - A command instructing your wingman to return to
   the Tiger`s Claw immediately

   Note: If obeyed, your wingman will not be available to you for the
   duration of this mission

5) Help Me Out Here - A command to your wingman to engage the
   enemy attacking you.

6) Attack My Target. A command telling your wingman to engage the
   enemy you have currently targeted This is the only way your wingman
   will attack an enemy capital ship

7) Keep Radio Silence - Prevents your wingman from talking to you until
   a "Broadcast Freely" is sent

8) Broadcast freely Allows your wingman to talk to you; negates
   "Keep Radio Silence"

9) Never Mind Disregard communication

Activate  Communications when you have an enemy ship targeted and a menu
of  taunts  appears.  Select one of these and your insult is sent to the
tar get.

Tactical  Tip:   Taunts  sometimes  at tract enemy ships to you, drawing
fire  away  from  a ship you're protecting or, perhaps, saving a wingman
whose ship has been damaged

Landing

Once  your mission is done, head back to the Tiger`s Clow.  When you are
ready  to  land,  target  the  Claw,  ap-  proach  from the front of the
carrier,  and use the Communications system to signal the ship`s traffic
control  officer  to  "Request  Landing".   If  you  have met any of the
following  conditions,  the  Claw  will  clear  you for landing and your
ship's  in  fliGht computer will initiate the auto-landing sequence when
you  get  close  enough  to  land  you must hove accomplished one of the
following:

a) traveled to any Nav point

b) achieved any mission objective

c) killed at least one enemy ship.

If  your  ship  is heavily damaged, you will be granted emergency clear-
ance.  If there are any active enemy ves- sels in the some area of space
as  the  Tiger`s Claw, however, you cannot land until they are destroyed
or have been routed.

Landing  takes  you  back to the han- gar, where you can see what damage
your  ship has sustained from the han- gar, you go to a debriefing where
your  performance during the mission is evaluated, and every siGnificant
mis-  take  or achievement is noted by Colo- nel Halcyon.  Afterward, if
you`ve   done  anything  particularly  noteable,  you`re  taken  to  the
Colonel`s office for con gratulations or a chewing-out.

The Campaign

As  mentioned  earlier,  each  campaign has its own plot and conclusion,
Each series of missions you fly - and whether or not you`re victorious -
af  fects  the  Confederation`s  chances  for  ultimate  victory in Vega
Sector.

After  several  missions  you`ll  be  presented  with  Campaign Progress
Screens,  story  updates which describe what`s happening in the war.  Do
badly  and  the  forces  of the Terran Confederation take a beating.  Do
well  and  the  Terran  forces  prevail.   Do  very  well and you may be
responsible for Con federation victory in the Vega Sector.
