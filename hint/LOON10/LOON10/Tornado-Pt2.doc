DEBRIEF 
-------

Ending or Aborting your Flight

At the end of your flight, you must use the key combination Ctrl Q to leave
the  cockpit.  For any flight outside the Simulator or the 2-player option,
you  must  land and bring the aircraft to a halt before you do this, or you
will  be considered to have aborted the flight, and you will not be allowed
to log it.

No  matter how you started a flight, at the end of every one you`ll see the
Debrief  Screen.   This will summarise your performance, and the exact data
will  differ  depending  upon  what  you`ve  been doing.  For every type of
flight  expect  when using the Quickstart option or Group Captain deFault`s
log,  or  if  you aborted you`ll be presented with the choice of whether or
not  to  log the flight and add the flying time and achievements to the log
record.   If  you  died, went missing or were captured in the course of the
mission, logging the flight (by clicking on the "OK" button) will mean that
the  current  log will lose its Active status, and you won`t be able to use
it again.

If  you  decide not to log the flight, click on the "Cancel" button and the
mission  and  its  outcome  will  completely  disappear  from  the  record.
Everything  will  be exactly as it was just before you took off, so you can
try it again or go back to the drawing board, whichever seems better.

You  can`t  be  killed or captured in the Simulator, in a 2-Player game, or
under the Quickstart option.  All other types of flying involve some degree
of risk whether from flying accidents or enemy action

Regardless  of  the  outcome  and the type of flight, your flying time will
always  be  shown.   Other information presented will depend heavily on the
type  of  flight  -  the  following  list is not exhaustive, but most items
should explain themselves.

Landings

You  will  be notified if you touched down heavily, and the aircraft may be
damaged.  If you landed hard enough to collapse the gear, the aircraft will
certainly be damaged and may be destroyed.

Damage

If  your aircraft was damaged in flight or by a hard touchdown, you will be
notified

Repair

Within  a Campaign or Command scenario, an aircraft will be unavailable for
the time taken to repair it.

Diversion

Within  a  Campaign or Command scenario, if you land away from your current
base you will effectively lose the time taken to ferry your aircraft back

Targets

If  your  mission included planned targets, you will be informed whether or
not you achieved their destruction.

Victories

If you shot down aircraft or destroyed other vehicles in the course of your
flight you will be told how many.

Losses

Losses  of  aircraft  and vehicles during your flight will be tabulated for
both sides.

Bombing Accuracy

This  only applies to the Bombing Range mission available in Training where
you  must  drop  a  single  weapon  on  the practice target.  Four types of
message are possible:

Score:  "50 at 1", or "180 at 6" are examples of typical scores.  The first
figure  is  your miss distance in feet, the second gives the miss direction
in  clock  face  terms.  For example:  "180 at 6" would mean that your bomb
fell short by 180 feet, "30 at 3" would mean that your bomb fell 30 feet to
the  right  of  the target.  Note that you must make your attack run flying
directly  North  (a  heading  of  360o),  or  the  clock  figures  won`t be
meaningful.  Miss distances of greater than 500 feet will not be scored.

"Delta Hotel"      A dead hit, a perfect score.

"No Spot"          The bomb wasn"t seen Presumably you didn"t drop it

"Splash"           No score a miss distance of over 500 feet

Leaving the Debrief screen

This is done by clicking on one of the two buttons in the lower part of the
screen  The  text  on these buttons will change according to the situation,
but  will  always start with either "OK" or "Cancel".  When you were flying
under  a log identity you created yourself, provided that you did not abort
the  flight  one  button  will  show OK Log Flight" and the other will show
"Cancel  Do  Not Log".  Be sure that you understand the consequences before
you choose to log the flight.

When  you  leave  the Debrief Screen, you may find yourself on any one of a
wide  variety  of  screens, depending on the nature and the outcome of your
flight

Quickstart flights

You will always be returned to the Main Screen.

Simulator flights

If  this  was  a  "start  airborne" exercise, you will always return to the
Mission  Selection  Screen.   If  the exercise started on the runway (which
means that you reached the cockpit by way of the Mission Planner), the "OK"
exit will take you back to the Mission Selection Screen, while the "Cancel"
exit  will return you to the Mission Planner, giving you the opportunity to
review the flightplan and try again, or leave using the Exit button.

Training

The  "Cancel"  exit  will always return you to the Mission Planner.  If you
click on OK, what happens will depend on the outcome of the flight.  If the
pilot  is  still  Active,  you`ll  find  yourself  on the Mission Selection
Screen.   If  your  pilot  lost  Active  status through death or dismissal,
you'll  be returned to the Log screen to choose another pilot, and when you
leave there you`ll be on the Mission Selection Screen.

Mission

As for Training.

Campaign

Cancel,  will  always  return  you to the Mission Planner and set the clock
back,  regardless of the outcome of the mission.  If you click on "OK" with
your pilot still active and the Campaign unfinished, the military situation
will  be  updated  to take account of everything which happened during your
flight,  and  you will be returned to the Mission Planner to fight the next
round.   If your pilot lost Active status, the campaign will end and you`ll
be returned to the Log screen to choose another pilot.

If  you  want  to  save the situation to continue later, you can do this by
selecting  Exit  from  the  Mission  Planner.   This will return you to the
Mission  selection  Screen,  where you will automatically be presented with
the option of saving the current state.  This is your only chance to save -
do it now or lose the opportunity

Command

As for Campaign.

2-Player

You will always return to the 2-Player screen, where you can choose whether
to fly again or disconnect.

Quitting Tornado

The  most  convenient  way  to  do  this  is  by using the "System" command
available  from  the  Options  button.  Alternatively, you can use the Exit
button  to  step  back  through  successive  screens  to  the  Main Screen.
Selecting Exit from there will give you the choice of quitting the program.

ELEMENTARY FLYING TRAINING 
--------------------------

Introduction

If  you`re  at all uncertain about how to fly Tornado, this is the place to
start.  In this chapter we begin from absolute basics, and aim to reach the
point  where  you can take off, fly simple manoeuvres safely, and land with
assistance  from the autopilot.  Simply flying an aircraft a short distance
from  A to B is not al all difficult, as any light-aircraft pilot will tell
you  -  in  many  ways  it`s less demanding than driving the same distance.
Over  longer  distances  navigation  becomes  the  biggest problem, but the
Tornado  automates  almost all of this Taking off is a little more complex,
but  still  quite  straightforward.   Landing  is admittedly most difficult
manoeuvre  in ordinary flying, but the Tornado autopilot can give you a lot
of  help.   Mainly it takes practice to get it right - and you can practice
in  the  simulator,  where you can learn from your mistakes rather than die
from them.

STARTING THE SIMULATOR

If  you  haven`t  done  so  already,  start  the  program  according to the
instructions on the separate Technical Supplement.  Once the Main Screen is
displayed,  click  on the large triangular "Flight" icon, which will divide
into  three  parts.   Click  on the part marked "Simulator" and you will be
presented  with the Mission Selection Screen.  Click on the first choice in
the  list,  marked "IDS - Free Flight - Airborne" and a window will appear,
giving details and showing two buttons.  Click on the one marked "Confirm".
After a pause for loading, you`ll find yourself in the air.

Quick Cockpit Tour

The  aircraft will fly itself straight and level quite happily, but just to
be  on  the  safe  side,  before  you  do  anything  else let`s turn on the
autopilot  Hit  F8,  which turns on the AFDS (Autopilot and Flight Director
System)  in  its  Altitude  and  Heading  Hold  mode,  which means that the
aircraft  will continue on in a straight line unless you tell it otherwise.
A  green  light  on the panel illuminates to tell you the AFDS has control.
The  yellow light beside it means that the Autothrottle is already engaged.
Until  you  tell it otherwise, this system will throttle the engines up and
down  to  try  and keep you lying at the same speed.  The aircraft will now
look after itself while we show you around.

At  the  moment,  you`re seeing the view from the pilot`s seat in the front
cockpit, looking forwards.  The lower part of the screen is occupied by the
Front  Panel  the  outside world is visible above, through and past the HUD
(Head up Display), the HUD support brackets and the canopy frames.  Hit and
hold  the  Look  Left  Key,  and you`re looking out of the left side of the
cockpit.  Release the key and you`re looking forward again.  The Look Right
Key does exactly the same on the other side.

Once you`ve returned to the forward view, hit the Back Cockpit key.  You`re
now  looking  at  the  Navigator`s Panel.  Though the panel and the pilot`s
ejector  seat  block  the view forward, you can use the Look Left and Right
keys  to  see  out  -  and you can also call up various camera views on the
displays (more about this later) Hit the Front Cockpit key to return there,
then  hit the key again and you`re looking up and forward.  Hit it again to
return to the standard front cockpit view.

Look Down - Choosing your Control Stick

Using the Look Down key in either cockpit gives you a view of your own legs
and  more  importantly, the kneepads which display a range of configuration
options.   Most  of  these  are  intended to allow you to set up the detail
level  of the outside visual to suit your preferences and the speed of your
computer,  but  the  important item for the moment is option 7 on the right
hand pad.  This lets you select which of the available devices you`re going
to  use as your control stick - the basic steering control of the aircraft.
The  options  available will differ from computer to computer, but wherever
possible  the  program  will  find  out  what`s  available on your machine,
displaying  unavailable choices in grey text rather than black.  Check with
the Control Summary and the Technical Supplement for your machine to ensure
that  you understand what each of the options means, and what each requires
in the way of extra hardware.

What  you  choose  for  your control stick will obviously depend upon whats
available  and  your  own  preference, but if you have any form of analogue
joystick  plugged  in,  that`s  what we would recommend.  As with all these
kneepad  options,  you switch the settings by pressing the number key (from
the  horizontal  row  on  top  of  the  typewriter keypad - NOT the numeric
keypad)  corresponding to the number of the item - in this case, the 7 key.
Each  press  advances  the setting through the range available.  These keys
work  the  same  way  in all view modes.  Now select the control device you
want but DONT move it.

Switch  back  to  the  Front  Cockpit view.  and you`re ready to start your
first flying lesson.

FLYING THE AUTOPILOT AND READING THE HUD

The  first  thing  we  asked you to do was to switch on the autopilot - now
let`s  put you in control of it.  If you look at the Multi-Function Display
(MFD) screen in the centre of the instrument panel, you`ll see that this is
showing something like AFDS:  ALT/HDG, followed by ALT 6000 HDG 270 and IAS
400.

These  figures  mean that the aircraft is trying to fly itself due West - a
heading  of  270°  at an altitude of 6000 feet above sea level (flat ground
level in this case), and the Autothrottle has control of the engines and is
trying  to  maintain  an  Indicated  Air  Speed  of 400 knots.  This is the
Altitude  /  Heading  Acquire and Hold mode of the AFDS.  You tell it which
way  to  fly  and  how  high,  and the aircraft will turn, climb or dive as
necessary to fly in the right direction at the right height.  These figures
are not telling you the current state of the aircraft - they`re telling you
what orders the autopilot is trying to carry out.  So how is it doing?

Look  up  at  the Head Up Display (HUD) - diagram 7.1.  At the top left you
can  see  the  Indicated Air Speed figure - it should show 400 (knots).  At
the  top  right  is  the  Altitude  figure  - this should read 6000 (feet).
Across  the bottom of the HUD is a strip of figures above a scale marked in
dots,  and  under  both  is a short vertical line, which should be directly
below  the figure 27.  This is the Heading Strip, and it`s telling you that
the aircraft`s compass heading is 270o all the figures on the heading strip
represent  TENS  of degrees.  These are the actual readings telling you how
fast, how high and in which direction the aircraft is currently flying.  If
you  haven`t changed anything, they should confirm that the AFDS is working
well.

You  should  also  take  a look at the pairs of horizontal bars with turned
down  inner  ends  which  appear  in  the  wide  central section of the HUD
(diagram  7.2)  These  are  called  the  Pitch Bars (collectively the Pitch
Ladder)  and each is marked with an angle in degrees, at 10o intervals.  At
the  moment  they`re  doing nothing because the aircraft is flying straight
and  level,  but  they give you vital information.  Among other things they
tell you which way is up, and whether the aircrafts nose is pointing at the
ground or into the sky.

In  this  AFDS mode, your control stick does not fly the aircraft directly.
Instead  you  use it to alter the autopilots instructions and the autopilot
then  flies the aircraft to carry them out.  Lets tell the aircraft to turn
north.   Move  your  control  stick  slightly  right while watching the HDG
(Heading)  line on the Multi Function Display (MFD) screen.  You should see
the  heading  figure start increasing towards 360° (at which point it snaps
back  to  0),  and the aircraft will start manoeuvering to follow.  Set the
Heading  figure  to  somewhere  between  0 and 10 degrees, moving the stick
right  or  left  to nudge the number up and down - but don`t worry about an
exact  value  for  the  moment.   If you`re using an analogue joystick, the
further  you  push  the stick, the faster the numbers change.  If not, then
the longer you hold the stick over, or the key down, the faster the figures
will change.  If you hold the stick over too hard for too long and the AFDS
heading  figure  goes past 090°, the aircraft will reverse its direction of
turn  because  it`s now quicker to turn left than right to get there!  Just
set  the  heading figure somewhere near 0° and let the AFDS sort it out for
itself.

If  you  look back up at the HUD and the outside world, you`ll see that the
aircraft  has  rolled banked - to an angle of about 45°, and the figures on
the  heading strip are sliding across as the heading changes.  You can also
see  that  the  bars of the Pitch Ladder are at an angle on the HUD they`ve
stayed parallel with the horizon outside - and they always do.  Notice that
the  turned  down  inner ends of the ladder bars point down at the ground -
this, too, is always true.

When the aircraft rolls level again, you should SEE that the reading on the
Heading Strip is the same as the heading figure you set on the AFDS display
(diagram  7.3).   Now  look at the ALT figure on the AFDS display.  Pulling
back  on the stick will nudge this figure up, pushing forward will nudge it
down.   Set  the  figure  to about 10000 feet.  The aircraft will raise its
nose  and  start  climbing  On  the  HUD,  you  can see the Altitude figure
changing,  and  the  pointer  on  the  clock,  swinging clockwise around it
(diagram 7.4)

Half  way  up  on  the right-hand side of the HUD is the VSI - the Vertical
Speed Indicator (diagram 7 5).  This is shown as a vertical bar which rises
or falls from a centre position as the aircraft climbs or dives.  Its scale
is  calibrated with dots at intervals of 5 feet per second.  If the rate of
climb or descent is bigger than the scale allows (and it often is), the bar
extends  to  the  end of the scale and stops.  The precise rate of climb or
descent  is only normally relevant in the last stages of a landing, but the
movements of the bar serve as a reminder of what the aircraft is doing.

If  you  look  at  the Pitch Ladder, you can see that it`s showing that the
aircrafts nose (represented bythe circle-and-two-lines symbol in the centre
of the HUD) is pointing above the horizon.  Now hit the F8 key again, which
will reset the Altitude Hold target to your current height.  We`re about to
reverse your last action and command the aircraft back down to its original
height,  but  the  aircraft will probably accelerate in the dive.  With the
wings  swept  forward  for  low-speed  flight the aircraft will complain if
asked  to  fly too fast.  Hit the S key, pause for a second or two and then
hit S again.  This will ensure that the wings are fully swept back for high
speed flight.  We`ll look at why and how to manage wing-sweep later on.

Now  push  the  stick forward to set the AFDS desired altitude back to 6000
feet - no lower.  You can see that the aircraft puts its nose down, the VSI
changes  from showing a climb rate to a rate of descent, and the pointer on
the  Altimeter clock, is now swinging anti clockwise as the Altitude figure
winds  rapidly down.  Looking at the Pitch Ladder, you can see that whereas
all  the  bars  above the horizon are solid, all the bars below the horizon
are  drawn  as  broken  lines  -  another useful reminder that your nose is
pointed at the ground.

If  you`ve  absorbed  all this, you can now read most of the more important
instruments,  and you`re ready to try flying for yourself, rather than just
giving commands to the autopilot.

LEVEL TURNS AND AUTOTRIM

Remember  the  green and yellow lights near the top left of the panel?  The
green  light  is on when the autopilot has control, and the yellow light is
on when the autothrottle is engaged.

When the aircraft is flying straight and level again, hit the Esc key.  The
green  light  should  go  out Congratulations, you`ve just switched off the
autopilot.   If  the  aircraft  was flying stably before you turned it off,
nothing  very  much  will  change unless you move the control stick.  Don`t
immediately  grab  the  stick  and clutch it with a vice like grip unlike a
car,  an  aircraft  can  be  left quite safely hands- off for long periods,
provided  that  it starts in a stable condition which is what the autopilot
should have left you with.

During  all  of the following exercises feel free to use the P key to pause
while  you  catch  up,  read  ahead  or try to work out what`s going wrong.
Hitting  P again will restart the simulation.  If you end up in a situation
you   can`t  handle,  quit  the  simulator  by  holding  down  Ctrl  and  Q
simultaneously, then restart.

Let`s turn the aircraft to the left.  Move the control stick a short way to
the  left  and  then release it to spring back to the centre.  The aircraft
should bank to the left and then stop rolling.  If it doesn`t stop rolling,
move the stick right and then release.  Try to set up a bank angle of about
45o and stop it there, but you dont have to be exact.

If  you  now look at the HUD and the outside world, you should see that two
things are happening:

. The aircraft is turning slowly to the left.

. The nose is dropping, and the aircraft is starting to dive and pick up 
  speed.

The  turn  is what we wanted, but and who said anything about diving?  Pull
back  gently  on the stick, and hold it slightly back.  This should produce
two results:

. The rate of turn increases.

. The nose should rise again. If it doesn`t, hold the stick back furthur

When the nose is roughly level with the horizon, relax the back pressure on
the  stick  and try to keep the nose on the horizon.  The outside world and
the Pitch Bars on the HUD are the easiest visual references to use for this
kind of manoeuvering

If  you`re  trying  to  fly  with the keyboard you won`t be able to use the
stick this way.  Because there is no way of reading how hard you`re pulling
back,  the  stick  force  just  increases  as you hold the key down longer.
There`s  no  way  of  reducing  the  stick force short of releasing the key
altogether.  All is not lost however.  Raise the aircraft`s nose until it`s
level with the horizon or climbing slightly the HUD VSI is a useful aid for
this - and then quickly hit the Autotrim key (on most machines this will be
the S key on the numeric keypad).

Autotrim  is  always  available when the aircraft is upright, regardless of
whether  or  not  you`re  using the keypad as your control stick.  When you
engage  Autotrim,  you can move the control stick right or left to bank the
aircraft to any angle short of about 80°" and the Autotrim system will pull
back  as  hard  as necessary to maintain the same rate of climb or descent.
Autotrim is cancelled when you make any pitch input (that is, when you pull
back  or  push  forward  on  the  control  stick),  or  when the bank angle
approaches  90° and it just isnt possible to keep the nose up any longer by
simply pulling back on the stick

Practise changing your bank angle and pulling back to speed up the turn and
keep  the  aircraft  level  - but for the moment, don`t try pulling back if
your  bank angle is much greater than 60°.  Instead, roll the aircraft more
upright before you try.

At  any  time  when the aircraft is not banked beyond 60o you may re-engage
the AFDS in Altitude and Heading Hold mode by hitting key F8 at which point
it  will  take  the current heading and altitude as the values to hold.  If
you  try  re-engage the autopilot while the aircraft is rolled further than
this limit all hell will appear to break loose as red lights start flashing
and  sirens  sounding.  Its just the aircraft`s way of making sure that you
know  that the autopilot is NOT flying the aircraft for you even though you
tried  to  switch  it  on  - you still have control.  Cancel the Warning by
hitting  the  *  (numeric  pad)  or  `  key and everything should return to
normal.

Now  that  you know what to do to keep your turns level, let`s look at why.
You  don`t  need  and  you quite probably don`t want an aerodynamics degree
course but you do need some kind of simple mental picture of the situation.
The simplest and best one available is the idea of the Lift Vector.

The Lift Vector

A Vector, for our purposes here, is just a force with a direction.  Vectors
are  usually  drawn on diagrams as lines with arrowheads.  The direction of
the line and the arrowhead shows the direction of the force.  The length of
the  line represents the strength of the force.  Look at diagram 7.6.  Here
is an aircraft stopped dead in mid air.  The only force acting on it is the
force  of  gravity,  so  we  draw a vector straight down towards the ground
that`s  the way the force will act.  Let`s say that the length of this line
represents  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity,  times  the  weight of the
aircraft call it the Gravity Vector.

In this situation, the aircraft will obviously fall straight down.  There`s
only  one force acting on the aircraft, and it`s acting straight down.  Now
imagine  the  aircraft  flying straight and level.  The force of gravity is
still  acting  on the aircraft but it`s not falling.  There`s another force
acting  in  exactly the opposite direction to the force of gravity, with an
exactly  equal  strength.   This is the lift force generated by air flowing
over the wings - the Lift Vector (see diagram 7.7)

If  the  length  of  the Lift Vector is less than the length of the Gravity
Vector,  then  the  force acting up is less than the force acting down, and
the  aircraft  will  slowly  sink (diagram 7.8).  If the force acting up is
greater  than  the  force acting down, the aircraft will rise (diagram 79).
How fast it will rise or sink depends on the size of the difference between
the  two  forces.   When you pull back on the control stick, you are making
the  Lift Vector longer.  When you push forward on the control stick, first
you  shorten  the Lift Vector, and then if you keep on pushing, you reverse
its direction and increase its length that way (diagram 7.10).

Now let`s look at what happens when the aircraft banks (diagram 7.11).  The
Gravity  Vector always points straight down, but the Lift Vector rolls with
the  aircraft.   It  always  acts at a right angle to the wings when you`re
looking  at  the  aircraft  from  in  front.  The length of the Lift Vector
hasn`t  changed  but  its  direction  is  no longer exactly opposite to the
direction of the Gravity Vector, so only some of the lift force is opposing
the  Gravity  Vector  the  rest  is  turning  the  aircraft and dragging it
sideways.   Because  the  Lift  Vector is no longer cancelling out the full
force  of  the  Gravity  Vector,  the  aircraft  starts to sink, and in the
resulting  imbalance  of  forces the nose drops and the aircraft dives more
and more steeply.

Pulling back (diagram 7.12) lengthens the Lift Vector, so that the fraction
of  its  force  opposed  to  the  Gravity Vector is enough to counteract it
entirely.   This  means that the sideways force is greater too, so the turn
also speeds up.

You can see that the steeper the angle of bank, the harder you need to pull
to maintain level flight, and the faster you turn (diagram 7.13).  How hard
can  you  pull?   The  Tornados  wings  are  built to support 7.5 times the
aircrafts weight as a safe maximum, so at most you can make the Lift Vector
seven  and a half times longer than the Gravity Vector.  The flight control
system knows about this limitation, and won`t allow you to pull hard enough
to break the aircraft.

Positive G and G-LOC

As  you may have realised, if you`re pulling this hard, you, the pilot, are
being  pushed  down  into  your  seat  with 7.5 times the force of gravity.
Lifting  a  hand  -  or even supporting your head upright takes seven and a
half  times more effort than usual.  Even worse, your heart and circulation
are  struggling  to pump blood "uphill" to your brain and slowly losing the
battle.   If you keep this up for too long, you will black out.  Since this
usually  means that you stop pulling, the force becomes less, blood returns
to  your  brain, and you wake up again unless, of course, you`ve crashed or
been  shot  down meanwhile.  The situation is sometimes known as G-LOC:  G-
induced  Loss  Of  Consciousness.   The G stands for Gravity - but here its
just being used as a unit of measurement.  If you`re pulling hard enough to
make  the  Lift Vector 7.5 times as long as the Gravity Vector, we say that
you`re  pulling 7.5 G.  You and the aircraft are experiencing 7.5 times the
normal force of gravity.

The  G  force  reading  is shown on the G-meter (upper right centre) on the
instrument  panel.   In  the Simulator you can ignore G-LOC if you wish, by
using  the  switch  on  the Mission Selection Screen to disable it.  In the
real world this desirable option is unfortunately not available.

Because  there  is a limit to how long the Lift Vector can become, there is
also  a  limit  to  how  far  you  can  bank and still hold the nose up see
(diagram  7.14).   Beyond this angle, the fraction of the Lift Vector which
opposes  the Gravity Vector can never be long enough to cancel it entirely,
though  the turn can and will get faster.  If you want the absolute maximum
rate  of turn, you bank to 90o and pull as hard as you can, but you have to
accept  that  the  nose  will  drop  while  you`re doing it (unless you use
opposite  rudder  to try and hold the nose up).  This is why Autotrim can`t
handle bank angles beyond a certain limit.

Pointing the Nose; ROLL then PULL

The  idea  of the Lift Vector is important for every kind of manoeuvre, not
just  level  turns.   Imagine a line running straight up from the centre of
the  HUD pointing in the same direction as the Lift Vector, so, that as the
aircraft  rolls  the line still points straight up the HUD.  In general, if
you  want  to  point  the aircraft nose at any thing or place, the best and
fastest way to do it is to roll to point the Lift Vector at the target, and
then pull back until the target is in the centre of the HUD

But  what  if the target`s below the centre of the HUD?  Can`t we just push
forward to point the nose at it?  For small corrections, yes, but there are
two major reasons why this is not a good habit to develop

Negative G

When you push the control stick forward from the central position you first
shorten  the  Lift Vector, and then reverse its direction.  When the length
of  the  Lift  Vector is reduced to nothing, the G-meter reads zero and you
and  the  aircraft  go  into  free fall.  When the Lift Vector extends down
beyond that point you experience negative G:- you, the pilot, find yourself
rising  out  of the seat and hanging in your straps, dust and loose objects
(there  shouldn`t  be  any,  but  there  often are) rise from the floor and
collect  in the top of the canopy, and blood rushes from every extremity of
your  body  to  pool  in  your  head, at an increasing pressure.  If a high
negative-G  manoeuvre  continues  for  too  long, it produces the condition
called  "red-out" which is even less pleasant than a positive G "black-out"
and much more likely to cause permanent injury or death.

Because  the  human body has such a relatively low tolerance for negative G
the  aircraft  is  built to tolerate about as much as the body and not much
more.   What  good would it do if the aircraft survived in conditions where
the  crew  couldn`t?   The  structural  weight  saved is considerable.  The
Tornado  flight  control  system  will not deliver more than -3 G, which is
still more than you can sustain for long without red out.

When you`re flying straight and level and you want to dive, the obvious way
to  do  this  is  to push the control stick forward to lower the nose.  For
small  corrections this is a perfectly valid method, but pushing forward to
enter  a  steep  dive  is  not  a  good  idea.   The risk of red-out is one
excellent  reason  to avoid this practice, the other is that its a slow way
to manoeuvre - just not good enough in combat.

The  reason  it`s  slow  is because the aircraft`s negative-G limit is less
than  its  positive-G limit:  -3 G against +7.5 G.  You`ve already seen how
the  length  of  the  lift  vector  governs the turn rate, and there`s very
little  difference between a steep hard turn and a hard climb or dive:  the
force  of  gravity makes some difference but not a lot when the Lift Vector
is  up  to  7.5  times longer.  Diagram 7.16 gives some idea of the maximum
turn rates available by pulling +7.5 G as against pushing -3 G.

In  the light of this, use the method described above - ROLL to line up the
Lift  Vector  and  then  PULL  to  point  the nose for all but the smallest
corrections.   If  this  leaves the aircraft pointed in the right direction
but flying upside- down, just roll it upright again.

THE AUTOTHROTTLE

If  you haven`t already done so, hit F8 again for Heading and Altitude Hold
and  watch  the HUD Airspeed figure until it becomes steady.  All this time
you`ve  been  flying  with  the  engines under control of the Autothrottle,
which is throttling the engines to try and maintain the requested Indicated
Air Speed, which is shown on the AFDS display on the MFD.

Just  as  the  control stick (which flies the aircraft manually) is used to
change  the autopilot's orders when the AFDS is flying the aircraft, so the
throttle  controls  (which  normally vary the engine RPM manually) are used
under  Autothrottle  to  change the desired speed up and down.  Look up the
Throttle  Controls  on  the Control Summary.  On most machines they will be
the  +  and  -  keys  on the numeric keypad.  The F10 key is used to switch
Autothrottle  on  and off, and the yellow indicator light next to the green
AFDS  indicator turns on when the Autothrottle is engaged.  When you switch
from  manual  throttle  to  Autothrottle it takes the current Indicated Air
Speed  figure  as  its  target speed.  When you switch from Autothrottle to
manual  throttle  control,  the  engine RPM and reheat settings stay at the
last value commanded by the Autothrottle.

Limits of the Autothrottle

Autothrottle  is  an enormously useful feature, and you`ll probably want it
switched  on most of the time you`re flying.  All the more important, then,
that you learn its limitations.  For the moment, don`t set the Autothrottle
target  speed  below  about  250  knots  - with the aircraft in its current
configuration  (i.e  with the wings swept back as far as they will go), the
aircraft  will  stop flying and stall not far below this speed.  We`ll look
at the reasons for this behaviour (stalling) later

Other  limitations  exist mainly because the Autothrottle controls ONLY the
throttles.   If  it  wants  to  accelerate  the  aircraft, all it can do is
throttle  up.   If  it wants to decelerate, all it can do is throttle back.
But if the aircraft is climbing at a steep angle, the engines simply cannot
develop  enough  thrust  to  accelerate  that  much weight "uphill" or even
prevent  the speed from dropping.  If the aircrafts nose is pointed down in
even  a moderate dive, the aircraft will accelerate as it coasts "downhill"
even  though  the Autothrottle has cut the engines back to idle thrust (63%
RPM)

You  can  cope with the first situation (the climb) either by climbing at a
gentle  angle  which  the engines can sustain (generally less than 20° nose
up)  or by accelerating to a high speed in level flight before pulling back
into  a  steep climb (a "zoom climb").  In this case you will lose speed in
the  climb, but you started with a high speed, so you can carry on climbing
for some time before the speed falls to a dangerously low figure.

To  handle  the  second situation (unwanted acceleration in a dive) use the
Airbrakes.   Look it up in the Control Summary but in most machines the key
will  be Backspace.  While you hold this key down, the Airbrakes, which are
large  panels  on  the upper rear fuselage, are swung open to increase drag
and  slow  you down.  If you look at the Airbrake Position Indicator (lower
left  on  the Panel) you`ll see a needle flick in and out as you deploy and
close  the  Airbrakes.   This technique will work for moderate dive angles,
but  there  is  a  limit to the effect.  If you think about it, you can see
that  it  would  take  an  extremely large parachutes to do very much for a
45000 lb.  (22000 Kg.) aircraft in a vertical dive!

Manoeuvre Drag

There  is  another  Source  of  drag  which  can make it impossible for the
Autothrottle  to  maintain its target speed, and this is the drag caused by
manoeuvering.   When  you  pull  back hard on the stick you are forcing the
wings  to  generate a large amount of lift, but it is impossible to do this
without  also  generating  a large amount of drag (though the proportion of
drag  to  lift varies with the wing sweep setting - see later).  If you set
the  aircraft up in level flight at a constant speed under Autothrottle and
then  enter  a  steep  hard turn, you will see the Airspeed start to decay,
while the Autothrottle cuts in maximum thrust and still can`t keep up.

While this increased drag and loss of speed is usually a severe nuisance in
air  to-air  combat manoeuvres, it does have a practical use if you want to
slow  down  in  a hurry.  Turning hard is probably the best way of losing a
lot of speed quickly - even more effective than the Airbrakes.

There  is one more corollary of the relationship between lift and drag.  If
more  lift  means more drag, less lift means less drag, and presumably zero
lift  means  zero  drag!  Unfortunately drag comes in many flavours and the
drag  due  to lift is not the only form of drag affecting the aircraft, but
it  is  possible  to  improve your acceleration by pushing forward till the
G-meter reads 0.  This manoeuvre can be important when you need to run away
from  a  fighter  or a missile, and is generally called "unloading", but if
you  keep  it  up for too long you'll dive into the ground.  We should also
point out that negative lift unfortunately does not imply negative drag!

STALLING
 
Several  times  above  you  will  have  seen  the  caution; don`t let the
aircrafts  speed  drop too low, or it will stop flying.  Now we`re going to
show you what happens next and why.  Since stalling behaviour is so heavily
related  to  airspeed,  we`ll  start  by  explaining  just  what we mean by
"Indicated" Air Speed

Indicated Air Speed - IAS

Indicated  Air  Speed  (IAS)  is  one  of four common ways of expressing an
aircraft`s  speed.   The  others are True Air Speed (TAS)" which represents
the speed relative to the air you`re flying through, Ground Speed, which is
actual  speed over the ground, and Mach Number, which represents your speed
as a multiple or a fraction of the speed of sound at your current altitude.
So what can IAS be if it's not the same as any of these?

At  ground  level Indicated Air Speed is exactly the same as True Air Speed
speed  through  the  air.  As the aircraft climbs, however, the outside air
pressure  and  density  fall.  The higher you go, the thinner the air.  The
amount  of  lift  generated  by your wings depends largely on the speed and
density  of the air flowing over (and under) the wing.  At higher altitudes
and  lower  air  densities  you need to fly faster just to stay in the air.
The  Indicated  Air Speed figure takes air density into account, and so for
any  given  aircraft  weight, wing sweep and flap setting the aircraft will
always  stall  (ie.  stop flying) at the same IAS.  If the pilot used a TAS
figure  the  stall  speed  would  increase  with  altitude,  which would be
confusing and dangerous.

At  ground  level  an Indicated Air Speed of 200 knots means that your True
Air Speed is 200 knots.  At 30000 feet, an IAS of 200 knots means that your
TAS  is  about 327 knots.  In both cases you can look at the IAS figure and
know  that  your  speed  is dangerously low in fact, with wings fully swept
back  the  Tornado  would  quite  possibly  have stopped flying and started
falling at 200 knots IAS.

Angle of Attack

Lift  can  also  be varied more directly by changing the angle at which the
wings  meet  the  airflow  (the Angle of Attack, aka Alpha angle).  Diagram
7.17  shows  how  this  angle  is defined.  Suppose your aircraft is flying
straight and level.  If you now raise the nose slightly, that will generate
more  lift,  and  the aircraft will climb.  The problem is that tilting the
wings  at an angle to the airflow generates more drag as well as more lift,
and  either  the engines must produce more thrust or the aircraft will slow
down.   The  steeper  the  angle of attack, the more lift and the more drag
produced.

The  trouble  is  that  your  wing  only generates lift when air is flowing
smoothly  round  it on both surfaces.  If the Angle of Attack increases too
far,  the  airflow  over  the  upper  surface simply cannot follow the wing
surface.  It breaks away and becomes turbulent and the wing suddenly ceases
to  generate  any  useful  quantity  of lift.  This is the STALL condition,
where the aircraft stops flying and starts falling.  At this point you lose
most  flight  control  because  there just isnt enough air flowing over the
control  surfaces  to  make them effective.  If the aircraft is left to its
own devices at this point, the nose will drop, the aircraft will accelerate
as  it falls, and it will usually regain flying speed within a few seconds.
This  is  fine  if nobody`s shooting at you, and you can afford to lose the
height.  If you can`t (for example, at 200 feet while approaching to land),
it  can be lethal.  So you must know how to avoid stalling if possible" and
how to handle the situation if not.

Use  the  AS  in  Altitude  and  Heading Hold mode to set the aircraft u in
straight  and  level  flight  at an altitude of at least 000 feet, with the
autothrottle  at  about  00-450  knots.   When  you`ve  done this, turn the
Autothrottle  off  by  hitting a, but leave the autopilot engaged.  Look in
your  Control  Summary  and  find  the throttle "Slam Shut" and "Slam Open"
commands.   Use  "Slam shut" to bring the engines down to idle thrust - you
should see the RPM gauges drop to a figure of 63%.

Now  watch  the  HUD Airspeed Indicator "the Pitch Ladder" and the vertical
strip  meter  on  the  left side of the HUD, opposite the VSI.  This is the
Angle of Attack (Alpha) meter (diagram 7.18).  With the engines idling, the
airspeed will drop but you may want to use the Airbrakes carefully to bring
your  speed  down  to about 250 knots - let your speed decay naturally from
that  point.   You  should  see  that  as  the  speed  drops, the autopilot
maintains  the set altitude.  In order to do so it raises the nose more and
more,  which  will show up on the pitch Ladder.  At the same time the Alpha
meter shows a steadily rising trend.

Finally  the  stall  point  is reached, the nose drops uncontrollably.  The
AFDS  system  realises  that it can`t handle the situation and turns itself
off   -   and   tells  you  so  by  sounding  an  alarm  and  flashing  the
Attention-Getter  lights.   Now  its time for you to act; slam the throttle
open  and  push  the  control stick forward (you`re trying to accelerate to
flying speed as fast as possible).  As soon as you see that the aircraft is
actually  pitching  down  in  response  to your command pull the stick back
GENTLY  and level off.  Now let`s cancel that infuriating warning.  You can
do  this from either cockpit, but shift into the back cockpit first, so you
can  see  the  Warning Panel (lower right), with the flashing light telling
you  what  the  warning was about.  To cancel the Warning, hit the * key on
the numeric keypad or the key.

If  you  didn`t notice the airspeed reading when the stall occurred, try it
again.   Its impossible to tell you exactly what speed you`ll find, because
stalling  speed  varies with the aircraft weight, which changes as you burn
fuel.   The LOWER the weight, the LOWER the stalling speed.  You don`t have
to  memorise  all  the  possible values, but it`s important that you get an
idea of the sort of speed at which you`re likely to run into trouble.

Once you understand what causes a stall and how to recover from it, the aim
is  to  be able to recover while losing the absolute minimum of height.  It
is  crucial to be able to do this if you stall while taking off or landing.
The  indispensible  factor  for  recovery  is  Airspeed  -  the  faster you
accelerate,  the faster you recover, but if that recovery involves pointing
the  nose straight down for maximum acceleration, then you`re going to lose
a  lot  of  height.  You will generally find that because the nose falls of
its  own  accord  you  need  not push forward to lower it; the really vital
action  is  opening the throttles.  Open them right up to Combat Power (Max
Reheat),  which  may  be  done  fastest  by  using Slam Open, releasing the
throttle  control  (stick  or  key),  and then Using Slam Open again.  Just
remember to shut off Reheat once you have reached a comfortable speed (Slam
Shut  while  in reheat cuts the throttles back to maximum RPM dry), because
fuel consumption at max Reheat is appalling, especially at low altitude.

WING SWEEP

Assuming that you`re back in control, set an altitude of 8000, and lets try
something  a  little different.  Make sure that your speed is less than 500
knots  and  steady.   Now  look  in  the Control Summary for the Wing Sweep
controls  W  and  S  on  most  machines)  and  find the Wing Sweep Position
Indicator  (lower  left  on the Panel).  The indicator should show that the
wings  are at maximum sweep (67o sweep).  Hit the F2 key for Satellite View
to  see  the  aircraft from outside and above so that you can see what this
looks  like.   Go  back  to  the Front Cockpit and hit the W key once.  You
should  see  the  Wing Sweep Indicator needle move forward to the mid sweep
(45°  sweep) position When the needle has finished moving, flip back to the
Satellite view so you can see what this looks like.

Now  try  the  stall  again, watching the airspeed and the Alpha meter, and
recover  as  before,  ensuring  that you return to a steady speed no higher
than  about  500  knots.   You  should  find  that  the  stalling  speed is
noticeably  lower than it was at full sweep, but the behaviour of the Alpha
meter  looks  much  the  same  it rises as the speed falls off and the nose
rises,  and  the stall occurs not long after it reaches a point just beyond
the  fourth  marker  on  the scale of dots If you try some turns you should
also find that the aircraft manoeuvres more.  crisply and turns faster than
it did at full sweep.

Set  Autothrottle  and reduce your speed to about 350 knots indicated.  Hit
the  W  key  again to sweep the wings all the way forward to 25° sweep.  Go
through  the  stall routine again and you will find that the stalling speed
has dropped once more.  Turns will reveal that the aircraft feels even more
nimble than it did at mid sweep.

This series of tests should have convinced you of a number of things:

.  The further forward the wings are swept, the lower the stalling speed.

.  The further forward the wings are swept, the better the aircraft turns.

.  Whatever the sweep angle, the Alpha Meter is a more consistent indicator
   of an approaching stall than the Airspeed Indicator

The conclusion is obvious - if you`re flying slowly, or you need to turn as
tightly  as possible, sweep the wings forward.  You can reduce the stalling
speed  even  more  by  lowering  the  Flaps as well, but we`ll come to that
later.

So  why  bother  with sweeping the wings back, if the aircraft flies better
and more safely with the wings forward?  Let`s demonstrate.

Mach Number

Starting  with  the aircraft flying level at about 5000 feet with 25° sweep
at  about  400  knots under Autothrottle.  Check that you know how to sweep
the  wings  back  again  (usually the S key).  Now set the Autothrottle for
about  480  knots  and watch carefully as the aircraft accelerates.  Before
you`ve reached the target speed you`ll hear a rumbling, buffeting noise and
possibly  notice  some vibration.  When you do, sweep the wings back to the
mid sweep position and the buffeting should stop.

You`ve  just run into what are called compressibility effects - the fringes
of  what  used  to  be  called the Sound Barrier.  Though the aircraft as a
whole is nowhere near the speed of sound yet, the airflow over parts of the
wings  was  beginning  to  approach  sonic  speeds  at  different places at
different  times.   Shockwaves  are  constantly forming and collapsing in a
chaotic  pattern,  causing turbulance and shaking the aircraft.  If you had
carried  on  accelerating without sweeping the wings back, the effect would
have grown more severe, and eventually aircraft would become uncontrollable
and  /  or shake itself to pieces.  The the wings back delays the formation
of the shockwaves until you reach a higher speed.

Now  set  the autothrottle for about 600 knots.  Once again as the aircraft
accelerates,  you will hear and / or see buffeting, which will disappear if
you  sweep  the wings back all the way to 67o.  You can now accelerate past
the  speed  of  sound  (Mach 1) all the way to the limits of the aircraft`s
performance  at the current altitude before you will experience any further
buffeting.



CONFIGURATION     25 SWEEP     45 SWEEP     67 SWEEP

MANOEUVRABILITY     BEST         FAIR         WORST
STALLING SPEED     LOWEST       MEDIUM       HIGHEST
LIMITING SPEED     LOWEST       MEDIUM       HIGHEST
(MACH NUMBER)      (0.73)       (0.88)       (2.2+)


So  now you know why variable-sweep wings are such an attractive idea.  Low
sweep  angles  allow  a  low  stalling speed, so the aircraft can land more
slowly  and  stop  on  a  shorter runway.  They also make the aircraft more
agile.   High sweep angles are not so good for manoeuvre, but they do allow
you  to  reach  high  speeds.   We`ll  go a little further into the subject
later.   For  the  moment the important thing is to give you an idea of the
speed  limitations  of  each  sweep  setting.   Because  those  limits  are
intimately related to how closely you approach the speed of sound, the best
way  to  express  them is as Mach Numbers; fractions of the speed of sound,
which like the aircraft`s performance changes with altitude.

The critical Mach numbers (the numbers you shouldn`t normally exceed) are:

      at 25o sweep:   Mach 0.73
      at 45o sweep:   Mach 0.88
      at 67o sweep:   Mach 2.20

You can switch the HUD airspeed indication from knots IAS to Mach number or
back  using  Alt  H.   Here  are  some figures to give you some idea of the
relationship between True Air Speed, Indicated Air Speed and Mach number at
different altitudes (see table opposite).

Like  any  other  fastjet,  the Tornado`s top speed depends on how high its
flying.   At sea level the high drag due to high air density means that the
aircraft  can  make 800 to 850 knots (Mach 1.21 - 1.29) flat out, depending
on  the weight, which is still faster than any other aircraft flies at that
height.   At  high  altitude  (say  36000  feet), the limit is roughly Mach
2.2,which  is about 1262 knots TAS, 689 kts IAS.  This is clearly not slow,
but  most  fighters  are  faster than this at these altitudes.  The obvious
moral  is:   if  you  have  to run away from a fighter do it as low down as
possible.


ALTITUDE     TAS     IAS      MACH      MACH 1    (speed of sound) is:

Now  that  you  have  some idea of how to fly, and what to do about stalls,
lets try something a little more challenging - landing.

AUTOMATED LANDINGS

Landing  is  the  most  difficult  of  ordinary  flight manoeuvres, but the
Tornados AFDS can do a great deal to make it easier.  In order to achieve a
successful landing, you must do the following four things in this order:

1.   You  must  arrive  at  a  suitable point to start your approach to the
runway  at  a  sensible  speed  and  pointing  in  approximately  the right
direction.

The  Mission  Planner systems will normally be helping you plan to do this,
and  the AFDS in Track mode will get you there if necessary.  We`ll look at
this in more detail in Advanced Flying Training.

2.   You  must fly the approach to the runway accurately while decelerating
sweeping  the  wings forward and lowering the flaps and landing gear, so as
to  arrive  at the runway threshold just above the ground, flying as slowly
as safely possible in the right direction.

The AFDS in Approach mode will fly the approach path for you and manage the
throttle.   All  you will have to do is deploy alrbrakes, wing sweep, flaps
and gear at the appropriate times.

3.  Just before the aircraft touches down you must "flare" raising the nose
and/  or  throttling  up to reduce the rate of descent to a figure the gear
legs and tyres can take comfortably.

The AFDS won`t do this for you, but it`s not too difficult.

4.   Having  touched  down, you must slow the aircraft so that you can turn
off the runway, or stop, before overrunning the end.

This  you  will  have  to do for yourself, and it`s high-pressure work, but
quite  mechanical.  Overrunning an 8000' runway takes some doing, but being
able  to  land  and  stop  short  on a damaged runway can save you and your
aircraft in wartime.

For  the moment, all you`re going to do is learn to use the AFDS to fly the
approach  for  you,  and  then  how to handle the necessary manual tasks at
touch-down and just after.

Landing Practice for Auto Approach

From  the  Main  Screen, select Flight, then Simulator.  From the Simulator
Missions,  select  "Landing Practice".  Having clicked on "Commit" you will
find  yourself  in  the  cockpit.  Hit the Pause key.  You are straight and
level  at  4000  feet  ASL  heading  towards  a  runway.   Just outside ILS
(Instrument  Landing  System) range, with autothrottle set at 450 knots and
wings at 45 sweep.  The HUD shows the standard nav display.

Unpause  and  wait  a few seconds.  As you come in range of the ILS system,
you`ll  see the HUD symbology change the centre symbol becomes a small open
cross,  and  a larger open cross appears off centre This will always happen
when  you  enter range of an ILS system if the HUD is in nav mode (ie not a
weapon  aiming  mode).   Take  a  look  at  diagram  7.20, which shows your
situation  in  plan  view.   The sequence of operations from here should go
like  this  -  you  may  want  to  use  the  Pause key to stay ahead of the
instructions:

Hit Key - AFDS Approach Mode.  (F6)

The  aircraft  will start manoeuvering to put the large cross on the HUD in
the  centre  WITH  the  aircraft on the runway heading.  The throttles will
also  be  adjusted as the autothrottle seeks the correct approach speed for
the  aircraft  weight and configuration.  The aircraft should start to slow
down.

Hit/Hold Key - Airbrakes

Use Airbrakes to bring the speed down to 350 knots.

Hit Key - Sweep Forward (to 25 sweep)

As  you  do  this  you should see the throttles close briefly.  You`ve just
lowered the stalling speed, so the AFDS can fly the approach more slowly.

Hit Key - Flaps Down

Do  this  once,  for the moment, to lower Manoeuvre Flap.  You will see the
Flap/Slat position indicators droop to the first position.

Hit/Hold Key Airbrakes

Bring your speed down to less than 280 knots.

Hit Key - Flaps Down

Now  you`re  below the limiting speed for Mid Flap.  This will have a large
effect on the stalling speed, so you should see the throttles close again.

Hit/Hold Key Airbrakes

Bring your speed down to less than 225 knots.

Hit Key - Flaps Down

Now  you`re slow enough for Full Flap, which will bring your approach speed
down to the slowest possible.

Hit Key - Gear Switch

Watch  the  Gear  Indicator lights to make sure it does come down and lock.
Initially  there  will  be  no lights, then three reds as the gear travels,
then  finally  three  greens  to  show that all three legs are locked down.
Anything  else means trouble.  Putting the gear down creates a lot of extra
drag,  so  the  aircraft  should  be  slowing rapidly if it has not already
reached the autothrottle speed setting If the throttles are still closed at
this  point,  use  the Airbrakes to slow the aircraft still more, until the
engine  RPM  gauges  rise  from  idle thrust and reach a steady value.  You
should now be in a stable approach, descending smoothly toward the runway.

Now  look  for  the  Approach  Progress Indicator light (upper right on the
panel), and wait for it to start flashing.  When it does.......

Hit Key - Cancel Autopilot

The  aircraft  should continue stably and smoothly down the approach, hands
off  since  everthing  is  already  set up.  Watch the HUD Altimeter as you
approach  the  runway  threshold,  and as the figure reaches 50 feet, start
pulling  back  gently  on  the stick, until you can see the rate of descent
start to slow down.  Try to avoid going back up!

Ideally, you will descend most of the way to the runway fairly rapidly, and
take  just  the  last ten feet or so more slowly.  As the main gear touches
down  (you  should  hear and see the thump, as well as the 0 reading on the
HUD altimeter), release the stick and...

Hit/Hold Key Thrust Reversers

The  Thrust  Reverser  buckets  close  over  your engine nozzles and divert
thrust  forward,  slowing  you  down.  Watch your airspeed, and at about 70
knots...

Hit Key - Slam Throttle Shut

Release Key - Thrust Reversers

Hit Key - Wheelbrakes

You must disengage the Thrust Reversers before your speed drops below about
50  knots, or your engines will start re-ingesting their own exhaust, which
will  do  them  no  good  at all.  Close the throttle first, or you`ll just
accelerate  again.   By  the time you reach these speeds, you can apply the
wheelbrake  without  fear  of  burning  them  out, and you should now coast
gently to a halt, having used up very little runway.

If  you  managed  to  do that all first time, congratulations.  Whether you
succeeded  or  not,  you  need  to practise it some more.  Over most of the
approach,  there  are a fair number of things to do to set up the aircraft,
but  not too much time pressure.  Just before touch down, the time pressure
suddenly  becomes  acute  and  every  action  is critical you must know the
sequence  of  operations  in advance, and mentally rehearse it in the final
seconds.   Eventually  it  will  become automatic.  When you've had enough,
read on.

Heavier = Faster = Scarier

The  aircraft weight affects your landing in two important ways.  First the
heavier  the aircraft, the higher the stalling speed the faster it must fly
just  to stay in the air.  The AFDS system knows this, and in Approach mode
it sets the autothrottle speed setting to stalling speed plus a percentage.
Any  higher  weights,  this  obviously  means that you touch down at higher
speeds,  and  roll  further  before stopping.  At maximum weight, even with
wings  fully forward, you will find that the AFDS wants to set the Approach
speed  at  or  above  225 knots - which is the limiting speed for Full Flap
leaving  you  in  a  complete Catch 22 situation:  you`ve got to reduce the
stalling  speed  (and  therefore  the approach speed) before you can deploy
Full  Flap,  but  the whole reason you want to lower Full Flap is to try to
reduce the stalling speed!

The  second  difference  weight makes is in how hard you can hit the runway
without  collapsing  the  gear.   At  light  weight,  with  a  nearly empty
aircraft,  the  absolute  limit  is  20  feet  per second, which is easy to
achieve.   Even  though anything above 10 feet per second counts as a heavy
landing, it isnt difficult beat this figure either.  But at maximum weight,
the absolute limit is one fifth of that - 4 feet per second.  This is a far
more difficult condition

But what can I do about it?

There  is  a  simple  answer  dump some weight.  The medium Jettison option
(external tanks and air-to-ground weapons) will bring your weight down to a
comfortable figure even if your internal tanks are still full.  The maximum
Jettison  dumps  most  internal  fuel  as  well,  giving you a nearly empty
aircraft The section on Emergencies in the Advanced Flying Training chapter
goes into this subject in more detail.

Operational Conditions

The  Mission  Planning  software will always insist that a flight plan must
include an Approach Point.  located in a runway`s ILS beam, and will ensure
that  you  arrive  at  this  point  flying  in the general direction of the
runway.   One  further condition should also be satisfied - that you arrive
at this point at a sensible speed, ideally no faster than 450 knots or so.

When  you  arrive  at  an  Approach  Point  in  Track  Mode,  the AFDS will
automatically  engage  Approach Mode, and the aircraft will start to follow
the  ILS  beam  down  to  the runway.  From this point on, the procedure is
exactly  the  same as for the Landing Practice sequence.  Provided that you
stick  to your flightplan and you can handle the last seconds of touchdown,
landing  should not be too much of a problem.  In the next chapter, we will
look at how to set up a landing anywhere you like, and do it manually.

TAKING OFF

Taking off is a far simpler manoeuvre than landing, you`ll be glad to hear,
but  it involves using a lot of different controls in quick succession.  It
also  helps  if you have some idea of how to fly once you`re in the air and
if you`ve followed through the exercises this far, now you do.

To  get  off  the  ground and stay in the air you`ll need fo know something
about the following controls and instruments:  (look them up in the Control
Summary and fhe Aircrew Notes)

. Throttle Control, Engine Instruments
. Wheelbrakes Switch and Indicator
. Control Stick (Joystick/Keyboard)
. HUD Airspeed lndicator. Altimeter, VSL, Pitch Bars
. Landing Gear Switch and Indicator
. Flaps Up Switch and Flap Position Indicator

From  the  Main Screen select Flight, and then the Simulator On the Mission
Selection  Screen, choose the option "Free Flight (from runway)".  You will
find yourself in the Mission Planner.  If this is your first take-off, just
click  on  the  button  marked "Take off" on the right-hand side.  You will
find yourself in the cockpit, on the runway, with engines idling and Medium
Flap selected, all ready to go.

Step  1.   Fully  open the throttle.  You'll see the Engine RPM gauges rise
till  they  show  100%.   At the same time, the Fuel Flow gauge will show a
moderate  rise.   Now  release  the  Throttle  control.   Light  up  Reheat
(Afterburners), by fully opening the throttle again.  The Engine RPM gauges
will stay on 100%, but both Reheat Indicators will light, and the Fuel Flow
gauge  needle  will  spin  clockwise  and jam itself against the stop.  The
aircraft  is  now  at absolute maximum power, held only by the brakes - you
may notice some vibration.

Step  2.   Release  the Wheelbrakes, watching the indicator to make sure it
goes out.  The aircraft will start rolling.

Step  3.   Watch  the HUD Airspeed Indicator, and stand by with the Control
Stick.   When  the speed reaches 140 knots, pull the stick back and hold it
back  If  the aircraft is lightly loaded the nose will immediately start to
rise,  if  its heavy this won`t happen until you have more speed.  Hold the
stick  back  until you`re pitched up about 8-12° according to the HUD Pitch
Bars,  from  just below to just above fhe first bar above the horizon.  Now
release the stick.

Step  4.   Watch  the HUD Altimeter.  As soon as it leaves 0 you`re off the
ground  You  will  also  see the HUD VSI indicator rise to show that you're
climbing  Check the Airspeed to see that you`re still accelerating.  If you
are,  hit  the Landing Gear Switch to retract the undercarriage.  Check the
Gear  Indicator  which  should  change from three green lights (gear locked
down)  to three reds (not locked down or up), and finally go out altogether
(locked up).

If  you`re  not accelerating, you`ve got the nose too high - push it down a
little carefully!

Step  5.   Watch the HUD Airspeed Indicator.  When you reach 215 knots, hit
Flaps  Up twice.  You`ll see the Flap Position Indicator rise from Mid flap
to Manouevre Flap to No Flap.  You`re now cleaned up and ready to fly.

In short form, the drill goes like this:

Throttle OPEN, Reheat ON FULL
Wheelbrakes OFF  (at 100% RPM and Max Reheat)
Pull back        (at 140+ knots)
Gear UP          (at 10+ feet)
Flaps UP         (at 215 knots)

After  Take  off,  you  will normally (in the Tornado IDS) be levelling off
quite  low  while you continue to accelerate to cruising speed it should be
quite  safe  to engage Track mode autopilot as you pass about 200'.  Normal
practice  would be to cut Reheat as you pass 300 knots, and make the switch
from  25  sweep  to  45 sweep at about 350 knots.  Operationally, your next
task  will  usually be to turn on the AFDS in Track mode and watch the Time
Early  /  Late  indicator  on  the  HUD,  fine-tuning  your  speed with the
autothrottle  in  order  to  arrive  exactly on time at your first en route
waypoint.

Variations:

As we said above, the speed you need to rotate and lift off the runway will
be  strongly affected by the aircraft weight - a heavier aircraft will need
a  longer  run  to reach a higher speed.  You can try the effect of varying
the  aircraft  weight by increasing or decreasing the fuel load and loading
stores  of various weights, using the Payload Window in the Mission Planner
(see the Mission Planner chapter for details of how to do this).

ADVANCED FLYING TRAINING
------------------------

Introduction

This  chapter  assumes  that you are reasonably confident that you know the
functions  of  the major controls and instruments, you can fly the aircraft
through  simple  manoeuvres,  and  you  can  take  off  and  land  with the
assistance  of  the AFDS.  We`ll look more closely at the uses of flaps and
slats  as  aids  to  tight  manoeuvre and low-speed flying, leading up to a
discussion  of  how to fly a loop and the many more useful variants of this
trick.   We  then  cover  Terrain  Following,  the full range of navigation
displays,  Target  of  Opportunity waypoints how to use AFDS Track mode and
the Time Early / Late indicator.

Once  you`ve  been  introduced  to  the full capabilities of the aircraft`s
navigation  systems  we  go on to discuss how to set up for an approach and
landing  wherever  and  whenever you want, and then how to fly the approach
for yourself without using AFDS Approach mode.

Finally  we  look  at possible emergency situations and how to handle them,
including  Spin  Recovery,  the jettison options and Ejection.  When you`ve
covered all this material you`ll understand the aircraft`s capabilities far
better and you`ll be ready to learn how to fight and survive.

MORE ABOUT FLAPS AND SLATS

As we said in Elementary Training, the primary use of flaps is to lower the
stalling  speed  to  allow  the  aircraft  to fly as slowly as possible for
approach  and  landing.  Flaps are surfaces which slide out of the trailing
edge  of  the  wing  and  hinge downward.  Slats are smaller surfaces which
extend  forward from the leading edge of the wing in a similar way.  On the
Tornado  both  flaps  and  slats extend and retract together in response to
Flap  Up and Flap Down commands and both extend for almost the full span of
the  wing,  which is unusual.  Its only possible because the Tornado has no
aileron  control  surfaces on the wings for roll control, which IS provided
instead  of  differential  movement of the tail surfaces and by spoilers on
the upper wing surface.

When  flaps  and  slats  are  down  they  extend the chord of the wing (the
distance  from  leading  to trailing edge), increasing the wing area.  They
also  deepen  the  camber  of  the wing, making it act like a wing which is
thicker  from  top to bottom.  There are other more subtle effects as well,
but  the  end  result  of all of the changes is that the wing develops more
lift  for a given airspeed and will tolerate higher angles of attack before
it stalls, so the aircraft can safely fly more slowly.

As  you  might expect, there`s bad news as well as good.  The price for all
the  extra  lift  is  extra drag, so it takes more thrust to fly at a given
speed.   When  slowing  down  to land normally the drag is more useful than
not,  but  if  you`re landing without power you won`t be able to afford the
loss  of  speed  until  the  last  moment.   The other drawback is that the
elaborate  mechanisms  add  weight  and  bulk especially so in as wing-wing
aircraft  like  the  Tornado.   If  the  designer  tried  to specify flaps,
linkages and actuators strong enough to operate over the entire speed range
the resulting aircraft would be so heavy and draggy it would probably never
leave  the  ground.  So flaps and slats are only certified to operate below
certain  speeds  -  the  limiting  speeds.  If you attempt to lower them or
leave  them down above these speeds, the best that you can hope for is that
the  mechanism will jam.  The worst case occurs when the overstrained flaps
collapse  on one wing but not the other, leaving an uncontrollable aircraft
corkscrewing towards the ground.

Need  I  say  more?   DON`T exceed the flap limiting speeds!  Here they are
again:

    Flap Limiting Speeds

    Manoeuvre Flap:   450 Knots IAS
    Mid Flap:         280 Knots IAS
    Full Flap:        225 Knots IAS

Because  the  Tornado has variable sweep wings there is one more constraint
on flap operation than you`ll find in most aircraft.  When the wings are at
mid sweep, the full-flap setting is unavailable because the extending flaps
would foul the fuselage side and the slot into which the wing trailing edge
disappears  When  the  wings are at full sweep, no flap extension at all is
possible  -  the  flaps  are actually trapped inside the slot.  Conversely,
with  mid  flap  selected  you  can`t sweep back beyond mid sweep, and full
sweep  is  unavailable  if  the  flaps are in any position except fully up.
There are automatic interlocks to prevent you from doing these things.  One
consequence  of  the interlock system is that you can't sweep the wings and
change  the  flap  setting at the same time you must do one thing first and
then the other.  Here`s a table of the possible combinations:

    Flap / Sweep Compatability
                      
                    25 Sweep   45 Sweep   67 Sweep
Zero Flap            Yes        Yes        Yes
Manoeuvre Flap       Yes        Yes        No
Mid Flap             Yes        Yes        No
Full Flap            Yes        No         No


Flaps and Manoeuvre

Manoeuvre  Flap is the "highest" flap setting, and as the name suggests its
intended  to  help  you  manoeuvre rather than land.  This flap setting was
chosen  as  an  acceptable  trade  off  between the benefit of lift and the
penalty of drag.  If you`re below the limiting speed for Manoeuvre Flap you
can  use  it to turn more tightly than you can with the flaps fully up, and
the  extra  drag  is  hardly  worth  worrying  about.   This  boost  to the
aircraft`s  handling  is  mainly useful in air combat.  The Tornado was not
designed  as  a world beating air superiority fighter it`s not possible for
any  one  aircraft  to  do everything well - and its strengths lie in other
areas.   As  a result, most purpose- built fighters can out turn if in many
situations, though very few can roll faster.  Using Manoruvre Flap can help
to  narrow  the  gap in capability.  See the Weapons Conversion chapter for
detailed advice on Air Combat Manoeuvering (ACM).

As a simple exercise and demonstration of the use of flap for manoeuvre, go
to  the  Simulator  and call up the "Free Flight (Airborne)" mission.  Lets
try  flying  loops:   they`re  a useful starting point for many more useful
types of manoeuvre.

Setting up for a Loop

The  first  essential  for looping the aircraft is enough airspeed.  Unlike
the  most  powerful  fighters,  the  Tornado  cannot  stand on its tail and
accelerate  straight up.  You`re going to lose speed on the way up, and you
don`t  want  to stall if you can avoid it.  We would suggest that you start
with  an  airspeed of about 450 knots IAS.  If you have height to spare you
can speed up your acceleration by means of a shallow dive, but beware...

The second essential condition is that you have enough height to recover if
something  goes wrong.  For the moment let`s set a lower limit of 5000 feet
for  starting the manoeuvre.  As you gain experience and confidence you can
bring  this height down, but it`ll be healthier for everyone if you do your
experimenting in the Simulator.

The third condition is not strictly essential, but it`s a good idea.  Start
the  loop  with the aircraft in a sensible configuration.  Looping with the
wings  fully  swept back is certainly possible, but only at high speed, and
the diameter of your loop will be enormous.  Mid sweep is probably the best
all-round  starting  configuration  Above  all,  don`t  try  this  sort  of
manoeuvre with a heavily loaded aircraft until you know what you`re doing -
and preferably not even then.

Finally, turn off the Autothrottle.  You`ll see why in a minute.

Looping Step-by-Step

Read this drill first and then try it out:  don`t attempt to do both things
at once!

1 Slam the throttles open to Combat power (Full reheat) and give the engine
RPM and fuel flow a moment to catch up.

2  Pull the stick back all the way and hold it back.  Be decisive about it.
Though there`s no need to punch yourself in the stomach, don`t dither.  The
aircraft  will pitch up and the airspeed will start to drop off.  Watch the
airspeed closely, and keep an eye on the pitch bars to monitor the progress
of  your  loop.   As  you  rise  to the vertical the 90o bar will pass down
across the HUD, then the pitch figures will start to fall again.  The pitch
bars will also help you to keep the wings level.

3  As  soon  as you`re safely below the limiting speed (450 kts), sweep the
wings  forward  to the 25° setting; you`ll see the pitch rate increase (the
pitch  bars  will move faster down the HUD).  When the indicator shows that
the wings have stopped moving, hit Flaps Down once to select Manoeuvre Flap
and  you`ll  see  the  pitch  rate  increase  again.   If  your airspeed is
worryingly  low,  you might want to drop the flaps further before you reach
the  top  of  the  loop, though this shouldn`t happen at moderate weight if
you`ve followed the directions exactly.

4  At the top of the loop the aircraft is inverted, peep pulling, though if
your  airspeed  is  dangerously  low you might let the stick come forward a
little way.  Remember that the harder you pull, the bigger the drag.

5 As the nose passes the horizontal on the way down and the aircraft starts
to  accelerate  again, cancel reheat and close the throttle (just Slam Shut
twice).   What  we  want  is  a  loop, not a power dive.  The aircraft will
rapidly  acelerate  downhill under its own weight, and we`re about to point
the  nose straght down at the ground.  As the speed builds up again be sure
to  retract  the  flaps  well below the limiting speeds, and be ready to go
back to mid-sweep if necessary.

6  As  the nose rises to the horizon again (the right way up this time) let
the  stick  relax  forward  to level off.  Note your altitude and speed and
compare  them with your starting values.  And don`t forget that you`ll need
to reopen the throttle!

Beyond the Loop

Keep  practising  this manoeuvre till you can do it easily, and then try to
find  the  limits.  Try it at lower speeds, higher speeds, with and without
Autothrottle.   There  are many variations on the basic manoeuvre, and most
of  them  are  more  useful than a straight loop.  If you roll the aircraft
level  at  the  top  then  you`ve  reversed your course in the quickest way
possible.   Try  making  a  low  fast  pass  over some point on the ground,
carrying  on  a  short distance, then pulling back into a loop.  Wait until
the  nose  is pointing back at the target and then roll upright for another
pass.  Tactically this is a bad idea on two grounds:

1 ) making a second pass on a defended target is probably the cause of more
combat  aircraft  losses  than  any  other single mistake.  and 2) a single
aircraft  hurling  itself  vertically upward will attract SAMs and AAA from
miles around.  But it`s good exercise and good fun, and the mental exercise
involved  in keeping track of which way it is to the target, which ever way
up  you are, is invaluable if you lack experience.  If you start pulling up
sooner  rather  than  later after passing over your chosen target, you will
also  discover  just  how much height you need to pull out of a dive.  Make
sure that collision-detection is disabled (on the Mission Selection Screen)
before  you  experiment,  or  you`ll  waste  a  lot of time crashing and re
starting.

Try  pulling  up to the vertical, rolling 180°, then pulling back again and
rolling  level  at  the  top.   This  will  leave  you more or less on your
original  heading,  but  several thousand feet higher.  Obviously you could
also  roll  through  more  or less than 180°, in either direction.  This is
known as the Immelmann manoeuvre.

There is also a downward counterpart to each of these manoeuvres, the split
S.   I  don`t  mean  an outside loop (pushing the stick forward all the way
rather  than pulling it back), which is strictly the province of aerobatics
professionals  in  special  aircraft  (or  suicidal  masochists).  What I`m
talking  about is rolling inverted from level flight and THEN pulling back.
Obviously  you  need  a fair amount of height before trying these variants.
Find  out  how  much.   

You  can  string  these various manoeuvres together in many different ways,
for many different purposes, provided that you don`t run out of airspeed or
altitude  When  you`ve  tried  all  these  things,  one  at  a  time and in
combination,  you`ll  have  afar  better grasp of what the aircraft can and
can`t  do.   Everything you can learn from these exercises will benefit you
when it comes to Air Combat Manoeuvering

TERRAIN FOLLOWING (IDS ONLY)

The  aircraft`s  ability  to fly automatically at low level over undulating
terrain  is  probably  the  best-known  feature of the Tornado IDS variant,
though  several  other  aircraft  also have this ability.  The original GR1
model  does  this  by  scanning  the  ground ahead with a radar to find the
ridges  it  must climb above and the valleys it can dive into.  In practice
it`s  a  very reliable system - it has to be, or the aircrew wouldn`t trust
it or use it.

Why Follow Terrain?

For as long as radar has existed, low-flylng aircraft have been the hardest
to  detect.   High ground between the radar and the aircraft will block the
signal  entirely.  Even, if there is a clear line of sight, a radar looking
horizontally  across  the  ground is half-blinded by echoes from the ground
itself.   A low flying aircraft is also less visible to every other kind of
sensor,  from an infra-red system to the human eye.  The later the aircraft
is detected and the sooner it has passed out of sight, the shorter the time
available  for  ground-based  weapons to be aimed and fired.  Anti-aircraft
missiles,  too  have  a harder time tracking low-level targets, and may fly
into  the  ground themselves.  Even fighter pilots, who are not notoriously
modest  or  timid people, will manoeuvre more cautiously when the ground is
just a few aircraft lengths away.  With modern look down fighter radars and
snap-down  missiles  they  can  attack  you  from  above but you`re still a
difficult  target.  If you have to be a target then that's the best kind to
be.

The  Tornado`s  TF  system gains you all these advantages, and lets you use
them  in conditions where most other aircraft would not even be flying, let
alone  flying  at  treetop-height.  Night and low visiblity mean nothing to
the TF system, provided that you trust it and know its limitations.

Disadvantages

The  main problem with the GR1 Terrain Following Radar (TFR) is that its an
active  system:   like  any  radar  it works by transmitting powerful radio
signals  and  listening for the echoes (normally known as returns).  Though
most  of  the  TFR  signal  is directed at the ground the radar has to scan
ahead  of  the aircraft, and an enemy with the right kind of receiver (like
the  Tornado`s  own Radar Warning Receiver) can pick it up from a distance.
The  Tornado  has no pretensions to passive Stealthiness - if the enemy can
point  a  radar  at it under good conditions, he will definifely be able to
see  it  -  so  every  possible  effort should be made to avoid drawing his
attention.

Another  (lesser)  problem  is  that the radar-reflective properties of the
ground  vary  considerably  with  soil  type, vegetation cover and man-made
features.   At  one  end  of  the  scale, this means that the system may be
spooked  by  metal  structures on the ground into pulling up higher than it
really  needs  to.   At the other, some Tornado pilots in the Gulf had very
narrow  escapes  indeed  in  the  process of discovering that some enormous
sand-dunes were effectively invisible to the radar!

TRN versus TFR

The solution proposed for the Tornado GR4 is based on digital mapping.  For
the  last  decade  or more, cruise missiles have used stored digital relief
maps to provide a cross-check on their navigation and to enable them to fly
accurately at extremely low level.  This is Terrain-Referenced Navigation -
TRN.   The  guidance system uses radar briefly and discreetly to capture an
image of the landscape, and then compares this with the stored maps to find
its  true  position.   To  keep down the storage requirement (and hence the
weight,  bulk,  complexity  and  cost),  such missile guidance systems only
store maps for a few critical portions of the route.

The  cost,  weight  and bulk of computer memory have changed enormously for
the  better  since  then, the quality and quantity of digital map data have
also  been drastically improved, and the processing power now available can
be used to analyse and present more data, more usefully, in less time.

The  GR1`s navigation systems combine automatic dead-reckoning and inertial
navigation  to  keep track of the aircraft`s position with a high degree of
accuracy.   But  even  so,  the calculated position "drifts" over time.  It
needs  to  be  checked by the navigator at intervals, and brought back into
line  with  reality  In the GR4 this realignment is performed by TRN, using
only the data from the radar altimeter, which is designed to be as close to
undetectable  as  a  radar can be.  A radar altimeter, which only transmits
straight  down,  is  inherently  a  lot stealthier than a Terrain Following
radar, which must look forward.

Because the GR4`s navigation system holds a digital terrain map, and always
knows  precisely  where the aircraft is, it can "look ahead" on the digital
map in order to follow the terrain.

Terrain Following with the AFDS - a demonstration

Select  the  Simulator,  and  call  up  the IDS - Free Flight (from Runway)
option  Select  "Take  Off"  in the Mission Planner, and once you`re in the
cockpit, get the aircraft off the ground.  Fly straight ahead (a heading of
270),  and  once you`ve cleaned the aircraft up for cruising flight, engage
the  Autothrottle  with  a  speed  setting  of  about 420 knots.  Now climb
straight  ahead  to about 2000 feet.  When you get there, hit the F9 key to
put  the AFDS into Terrain Follow (TF) mode.  You`ll see the mode change on
the  AFDS MFD display and the ALT status will change to 1500 RIDE (maintain
a  Ride Height of 1500 feet).  If you look at the HUD altimeter, you`ll see
that  a  letter  T has appeared below the digital altitude figure, which is
prefixed  by  the  letter  R  to show that this is a radar altitude (height
above ground) rather than a barometric altitude (height above sea - or flat
ground - level).

If  you`re  over hills, you`ll see that the aircraft is now pitching up and
down under automatic control to maintain 1500 feet above ground, as closely
as  it  can.   if  you`re not above hills at the moment, look about to find
some,  and  use  left  or  right Control Stick movements to set the Heading
Acquire  figure  to  steer  towards  them,  just as you would in Altitude /
Heading  Acquire  mode.  Moving the stick forwards or backwards will change
the  Ride Height figure, which can be set to 1500, 1000, 750, 500, 400, 300
or  200  feet.   Set  the  Ride  Height down to 200 feet by stages, pausing
briefly each time to let the aircraft stabilise at the new Ride Height

As  you  reach  about  500 feet you`ll notice that the E Scope (the display
above  and  to the left of the MFD) is starting to show an undulating green
zone  in  its  Bottom  section.  As the Ride Height is reduced further, the
green  zone  will  rise up the display.  The zone represents the profile of
the ground directly ahead of the aircraft, shown relative to the fixed mark
on  the  left-hand  side  of  the display As the aircraft moves, the ground
profile  shown  in the E-Scope scrolls in on the right and out on the left.
This data the TF system is using to decide whether it must climb to clear a
ridge, or can dive to take advantage of a valley.

Now  set  the Autothrottle to a higher speed, say 550 knots, not forgetting
to  adjust wing sweep as necessary and try to find some more hills.  As the
aircraft`s  speed  increases,  so the TF system needs to look further ahead
for obstacles.  The vertical scale of the E-Scope remains the same, but the
horizontal  scale  changes  to  compress  a greater distance into the fixed
width of the display, this means in effect is that the slopes start to look
steeper The faster you go, the more dramatic the effect becomes.

The  TF  sysfem  is  smart  and  trustworthy, but it does have limits.  The
faster  the  aircraft  flies, the more difficult it is to follow the ground
closely,  and  the  more  dangerous it becomes to do so.  The system allows
itself  a margin of error below the set Ride Height, and flashes the B risk
indicator  (a red light below the E Scope) when it exceeds that margin.  If
the B risk indicator is flashing frequently, you should either slow down or
increase  the  Ride  Height  if  the  situation  allows.   There is also an
absolute  limit  below the safety margin.  If the radar altitude falls this
low,  the  system  goes  into panic reaction.  It instantly rolls the wings
level and pulls up hard away from the ground, then automatically disengages
itself and sounds a warning to tell you.

The  emergency  pull-up is intended to save you if possible, but it may not
be  triggered until it`s too late.  It is not guaranteed to save your life.
If  you  want  to try it out, find a long stretch of level ground free from
tall  obstructions  and very carefully fly the aircraft by hand down to 100
feet  or less.  When you`ve done this, engage TF mode and the system should
trigger an emergency pull up immediately.  As you engaged it, the TF system
automatically selected the nearest Ride Height (200 feet) and found that it
was below the absolute safety limit.

Quite  apart  from the fact that it can`t be guaranteed to prevent you from
flying  into  a  steep  hillside  at high speed, there is another excellent
reason  to  avoid  relying  on  the  emergency  pull-up.  The reason you're
Terrain-Following  in  the  first  place  is  to  avoid drawing the enemy`s
attention,  and a Tornado rocketing upwards like a scared pheasant is bound
to attract it!

MAPS, THE MFD AND THE TAB DISPLAYS

Because the navigation displays and systems are powerful, comprehensive and
quite  complex, there`s a lot of material to cover, so you`ll probably want
to  use  Pause frequently, or even restart the whole exercise at intervals.
As  an incentive to wade through this stuff; when you`ve absorbed it you`ll
be  able  to  tell  the  aircraft  to fly itself to any point on the map by
simply pointing with the mouse and clicking.  To get things started, select
Simulator,  and  the Free Flight - Airborne mission and commit.  Engage the
AFDS  in  Altitude  /  Heading  Acquire mode, so that you hold your current
heading of 270° (due West).

Full-Screen Moving Map

To  call up the Full-Screen Moving Map hit the M key(check with the Control
Summary).   As  the  name  suggests,  this  uses  the entire screen area to
display  a  map.  The map scrolls automatically to keep the aircraft in the
centre,  shown  as a symbol surrounded by a compass rose with North marked.
The map also rotates as the aircraft turns, so that the direction of flight
is always straight up the screen.

Because  of the large size, this map covers a larger area and offers better
resolution  than  any  of  the other map displays available in the cockpit.
You can also zoom in and out - check the Control Summary to find out how to
do it.  To go from this display to any other view, just hit the key for the
view you want.

Multi-Function Display (MFD) Modes

Shift  to  the  front cockpit view.  By repeatedly hitting the MFD Function
Select  key  (probably D) you can cycle through a variety of displays.  The
full list of possible MFD displays is as follows:

1.  AFDS / Autothrottle Status Display

You`ve  already  seen  this display.  It will be available whenever AFDS or
Autothrottle  are  engaged.  Engaging either will automatically select this
MFD  display, though you can still select any other available display using
MFD Function Select.

2.  ILS Display

This display is available at any time.  but it will only become active when
you  are  inside the ILS coverage of an allied airfield and pointing in the
general  direction  of  the  runway.   For  details,  see  the  section  on
Semi-automatic and Manual landings later in this chapter.

3.  Local Map Display

Available  at  all  times,  and  covered  in detail below.  Users of slower
computers  may want to use this display only from the Back cockpit since it
requires heavy processing and may have a visible effect on the frame update
rate.   The  impact  is much less when the map is zoomed in to show smaller
areas.

4.  Forward-Looking Camera

Available on the back seat MFD at all times, but only at night on the Front
Panel.   Displays  a  normal  full-colour  image in daytime, and an image -
intensified  view  at night.  When used in the front cockpit it may visibly
slow the frame update rate.

5.  Ground Radar Display (IDS only)

Available  only  when  the  radar  is  on,  and  in Ground mode.  This is a
synthetic  composite  display combining digital map data and radar returns.
Returns from objects not found in the map database are shown as bright dots
-  this  is a good way of locating vehicles or trains.  Ground Radar can be
used  to  designate targets of opportunity, and is covered in detail in the
Weapons Conversion chapter.  This is another power-hungry display, but like
the Local Map Display it is less demanding when the range setting is short,
and  of  course it can be used from the back cockpit without visible impact
on the frame rate.

6.  Air Radar Display

Available  only  when  the  radar  is  on, and in Air mode.  This is a plan
display  showing  aircraft detected in a fan-shaped volume in front of your
Tornado  Short  and medium range settings are available in both IDS and ADV
aircraft  but only the ADV radar offers the long-range setting.  Allied and
Enemy  aircraft are distinguished by different symbols, and the display can
be used to designate targets in air combat.  Air Radar is covered in detail
in the Weapons Conversion chapter.

7 Display Unavailable/MFD damaged

If  a  particular display is not available because of equipment failure you
may see a green diagonal cross substituted for the normal display.  The MFD
itself  may  also  suffer damage, in which case the disp!ay will degenerate
into noise If you find this annoying, you can turn the MFD off altogether.


The Local Map Display in detail

Use  the  MFD  Function Select key to Bring up the Local Map Display.  Like
the  Full  screen Moving Map, this display rotates as the aircraft turns so
that  the  aircraft  always points straight up the screen - as shown by the
vertical  line  of  dots  projecting  the  current  heading.  Also like the
Full-Screen  Moving  Map, this map scrolls to keep your current position in
the same place on the screen, but you have two Map Origin Modes giving some
choice as to where the display will be centred.

When you first see this display it will show the aircraft`s position at the
centre of the screen, with the dotted line extending from there to the top.
This  is the Centre Origin mode, which lets you see the area Behind as well
as  in  front of the aircraft.  Hitting the Map Origin Select key (probably
D),  will  switch  to Base Origin mode, which puts the aircraft position at
the  bottom of the display in the centre.  The dotted line now extends from
top  to  bottom of the display.  Base Origin mode allows you to see further
ahead  of  the  aircraft.   Hitting  the  Map Origin Select Key will always
switch  from  one  mode  to  the other.  The map can Be zoomed in or out in
either of these modes (see the Control Summary under Local Map Zoom).

Into the Back Cockpit:  TV Tab Displays

Because  of  the  restricted size of the MFD, the Local Map is intended for
short  range  orientation and navigation only.  For serious work we need to
shift  to  the  back  cockpit,  where the Navigator / Weapon System Officer
works.   Here there are three displays side by side.  The centre display is
an  MFD  just  like  the  one on the Front Panel, with all the same display
modes available plus a daytime forward camera view.  The larger displays on
either side are known as the Tab displays.  This peculiar name is short for
TV  Tabulator  (a relic of early computer equipment nomenclature), but they
are simply a larger form of multi - function display

Look  up  Left  Tab Function Select and Right Tab Function Select (probably
the  [and]  keys), which are used to cycle each screen through its range of
displays.   Some  of  these  are  unique  to the Tab displays, and some are
shared  with  the  central  MFD.   To  save you time in cycling through the
options  for  any  of  the three displays, you will only be offered display
modes  which  are  not already shown on another screen, e.g.  if you select
the Local Map on the right Tab display, you will find that the MFD will not
offer  this  display  if you cycle through its options.  Similarly, you can
never  have  the  same  display on Both Tabs at the same time.  Use the MFD
Function  Select key to bring up the AFDS display which is not available on
the  Tab  screens  (remember  that you wont see this unless the AFDS or the
Autothrottle  are  engaged).   This  will ensure that the full range of Tab
displays are available for you to see.

In  the  bottom  left corner of each of the three displays is a green light
which  only  ever illuminates on one display at a time.  This light is used
to  show  which  display currently has use of the mouse as an input device,
and  pressing  the  Select  Active Display key (probably T) will switch the
mouse  from one display to the next in a continuous cycle.  For the moment,
make sure that the right Tab`s green light is on.

Now  use  the  Right Tab Function Select key to cycle through the available
displays.  Between the modes available on the right Tab screen, and the one
displayed on the Left Tab screen, you should find all of the following:

1.  Forward Looking Camera

Exactly like the corresponding MFD display, But larger and more useful.

2.  TIALD lmage

TIALD  stands  for  Thermal Imaging And Laser Designation, and this mode is
unique  to  the  Tab  displays.  This is the view from a steerable downward
looking  camera  system  on  the  underside  of  the  aircraft.   It is not
available  when  the  aircraft is on the ground, because the lenses must be
protected  from  debris  thrown  up  by  the  landing  gear.   It  is  also
unavailable when roll or pitch attitudes are extreme.  When the view is not
available a large diagonal cross fills the display.

The  TIALD  system is mainly used from medium altitude to designate targets
for  Laser-Guided  bombs,  and  it  is  described  in detail in the Weapons
Conversion chapter.

3.  Local Map Display

This  works  exactly like the MFD Local Map Display, but is larger and more
useful.  It is not available if the back-seat MFD is already displaying the
Local Map

4.  Scrollable Map

This  mode  is  only available on the Tab displays.  You can distinguish it
from  the  Local  Map because it doesn`t have adotted line down the centre.
It is described in detail below.

5.  PLN (Flightplan) Display

This  mode  is only available on the TaB displays.  It shows a schematic of
the  flightplan  currently  stored in the aircraft`s navigation system, the
location of any target-of opportunity waypoint, and the aircraft`s position
relative  to  these Zoom level and display origin will change automatically
to  keep  all  of these elements on the screen, provided that you don`t fly
off the map.

The  PLN display is described in detail below, in the section covering AFDS
Track mode.

The scrollable Map Display in detail

This  is your most powerful navigational aid.  Like the Local Map, this map
display  rotates  as  the  aircraft  heading changes, so that the aircrafts
direction  of  movement is always straight up the screen.  Unlike the Local
Map,  however  this  display  does  not  scroll  automatically to keep your
current  position  at  a  fixed  point on the screen.  Check that the right
Tab`s  green  Mouse Active light is on and try moving the mouse about.  You
will  see  that  moving  the  mouse  scrolls  the  map  freely  in all four
directions,  out  to the limits of the Training Area.  You can also zoom in
and out by clicking the left and right mouse buttons while holding down the
Control key

There  is  a  numerical  readout in each corner of the display, and working
clockwise  from  top  left these are:  current aircraft heading, Bearing to
the  map  position centred on the screen (marked by the small fixed cross),
range  in  nautical  miles to that position and time in minutes and seconds
required  to  get  there  at  current  speed (provided that the aircraft is
pointing in that general direction)

If you scroll away over the map and lose track of your current position you
can  find  the  aircraft  quickly  by  clicking the left mouse button while
holding  down  the  Alt  key.   This  centres  the  display at your current
position  where  you  will see a small aircraft symbol.  Wait a few seconds
and you will see the symbol move up the screen as it tracks your position.

These features make the Scrollable Map the most useful of all.  However its
most  powerful  feature  is  the  ability  to  set  a Target of Opportunity
waypoint

Setting a Target-of-Opportunity Waypoint

Use the Alt and left click combination to find your aircraft again.  Scroll
the  map  some way ahead of your current position, and find an identifiable
feature.   For  example,  this might be an airfield, a city, a village or a
bridge.   Now  click  the left mouse button on its own.  This will create a
Target  of  Opportunity waypoint at that location.  If you scroll the map a
little  away from the point you selected, you`ll see that it is marked by a
flashing cross.  If you click the RIGHT mouse button while holding down the
Alt  key,  the  map will centre itself on the waypoint again.  Clicking the
RIGHT mouse button on its own cancels the waypoint.

A  waypoint  is  just  a  map  position  stored  by the aircraft navigation
systems.  It may be the position of a target, more often it`s a place where
you  want  to make a course change.  Waypoints which are part of the stored
flightplan are labelled in alphabetical order from A to O, with the letters
X,  Y  and  Z used for planned targets you can see the stored flightplan on
the  Tab PLN display (call it up on the other Tab display if it isn`t there
already).   These waypoints can only be set up in the Mission Planner.  The
waypoint    you`ve    just    placed   is   different;   its   called   the
Target-of-Opportunity waypoint, it`s shown on the PLN display by the tetter
T,  and  obviously you CAN set this one in flight, at any position you like
(provided that it`s within the current map area).

Target-of-Opportunity  (ToO)  waypoints  can  be  used  exactly as the name
implies - to make accurate attacks on unplanned targets with the aid of the
navigation  systems.   You  can  also create ToO waypoints using the Ground
Radar display on the MFD.  We`ll deal with how to make attacks of all kinds
in  the Weapons Conversion chapter, but here we`ll talk about using the ToO
waypoint for navigation.

AFDS Track Mode

So  far we`ve used the AFDS in Attitude/Heading Acquire, Terrain Follow and
Approach  modes.   Track  mode  is  the "smartest" mode of all, and the one
you`ll  use  most  often  operationally.   In  Track mode the aircraft will
automatically  follow the stored flightplan, flying itself from waypoint to
waypoint,  performing attacks (in most delivery modes), adjusting height fo
terrain  follow  or  hold  altitude as laid down in the flightplan.  In the
absence  of  interruptions  from the enemy, the AFDS in Track mode is quite
capable  of  flying  an  entire  strike  mission for itself from just after
take-off to just before touchdown.

Human  intervention  is only required for takeoff, setting autothrottle and
wing sweep, arming and committing weapon release, pulling up if it's a loft
delivery landing and bringing the aircraft to a halt.  Later on, we`ll look
at  the  normal  use  of  Track mode to follow a complete flightplan.  What
we`re  going  to do now is use Track mode to fly the aircraft automatically
to the Target of-Opportunity waypoint, T.

One  of the waypoints shown on the Tab PLN display is highlighted.  This is
the  currently  selected  waypoint,  and  if you engage AFDS Track mode the
aircraft   will   automatically  fly  towards  this  waypoint.   Flightplan
waypoints  are  normally  selected  in  automatic  sequence, though you can
override  this  by hitting the Skip Waypoint key.  The only way to select T
as the current waypoint is to hit the T key.  Do this now, and check to see
that the T on the Track display is highlighted.  Now engage AFDS Track mode
(F7),  and  watch  the  aircraft  turn and flytowards T.  This is literally
point-and-click  navigation,  a  boon  for  the  lazy  the  confused or the
preoccupied!

If  you`ve followed the directions in this tutorial faithfully, you were in
Altitude  /  Heading  Acquire (AHA) mode before you switched to Track mode,
and  you`ll  see  that the hold altitude carries over despite the switch of
mode.  While the AFDS is in Track mode, hitting the TF Engage key (F9) will
toggle  altitude control between AHA mode and Terrain Following.  (provided
that  you`re  flying  an  IDS  Tornado the ADV can`t Terrain Follow) and in
either  mode  you may change the height setting in the normal way by moving
the  Control  Stick  backwards or forwards.  Be careful when switching from
Terrain  Following  to Altitude Hold or you may find yourself flying into a
hill!   You  cannot change the heading manually in Track mode, because this
is automatically defined by the bearing of the selected waypoint.

In  Track  mode the AFDS MFD display shows several new items.  One of these
is the letter identifying the currently-selected waypoint the one which the
system  is  steering  towards.  At the moment it should show T.  When Track
mode  is  engaged  there  will  always  be a TTG (Time To Go) legend on the
display though a figure will not always be shown beside it.  This shows the
time  in minutes and seconds before you reach the selected waypoint at your
current  speed.   It is only displayed when the aircraft is pointing in the
general  direction  of  the  selected  waypoint; if it`s pointed away (e.g.
when  there`s  a large angle to turn through) it`s difficult to calculate a
meaningful Time To-Go figure.

You  should  notice an arrow-shaped symbol beneath the heading strip on the
HUD  this  also shows the bearing to T, the currently-selected waypoint (or
any other waypoint which is selected).  When the Bearing symbol is lined up
with  the  vertical "lubber line" you`re pointing straight at the waypoint,
allowing you to follow a flightplan manually as well as automatically.

The Tab PLN Display

We`ve  already  introduced  you  to most of the uses of this display in the
sections  above,  but  let`s  sum  up  the  details  now  and  complete the
description.    The   PLN  display  shows  all  waypoints  and  the  stored
flightplan, plus your current position (as a small circle).  It will change
scale  and  re  centre  itself  automatically  to keep all this data on the
screen  as  the  aircraft  moves  or  ToO waypoints are created; but if the
aircraft  moves too far outside the current map it will give up the attempt
to  keep  it  on  screen.   The  PLN  display does not rotate and is always
oriented  North-up,  like  the  map in the Mission Planner which is used to
create flightplans.

The  currently  selected waypoint is shown highlighted, and is normally one
of the stored flightplan waypoints.  If you create a ToO waypoint using the
Scrollable  Map,  you can select and highlight it by hitting the T key.  To
deselect  the  ToO  waypoint, use the key combination Control+T, which will
also reselect the previously selected flightplan waypoint.

As  on the Scroltable Map, figures are shown in the four corners of the PLN
display.   Clockwise  from  top  left these are:  current aircraft heading,
bearing of the selected waypoint, range (in nautical miles) to the selected
waypoint and (when appropriate) time to reach it at current speed

Using AFDS Track Mode with stored flightpaths

This  is  the  normal use of Track mode.  Whether it`s supplied ready- made
for a Single Mission, or hand-crafted by yourself using the Mission Planner
software  the stored flightplan consists of a sequence of waypoints and the
legs connecting them.  Flightplan waypoints may also have other information
associated  with them.  This may specify the altitude or Ride Height to fly
at  the  time  at  which  you  plan to pass the waypoint, or the method you
intend  to use to attack a target located there.  We describe the system in
exhaustive  detail  in  the chapter of this manual dedicated to the Mission
Planner.   All  we`re going to do now is demonstrate how to use the AFDS to
follow the flightplan.

From the Simulator Mission Selection Screen, select the Nav Exercise option
and commit.  This will take you to the Mission Planner, where you should be
able  to  see a preset flightplan on the map.  When you know how to use the
Mission Planner you`ll be able to change this to suit yourself, but for the
moment just click on the button marked Take Off, which is on the right hand
side of the screen.

When  you  arrive  in  the cockpit, take off and climb straight ahead to an
altitude  of  at  least  200  feet, not forgetting to raise gear and flaps.
When  you  reach  200  feet, hit F7 to engage Track Mode.  Let the aircraft
accelerate  to  about  420 knots, then cut in the Autothrottle and go to 45
sweep, the normal cruise configuration.  On the MFD AFDS display you should
be  able  to see all the data we've explained above, and one more line will
have become active, titled TEL

TEL (Time Early / Late) Displays

If  you're  taking  part  in a multi aircraft attack, then every aircraft`s
time  of  arrival  and  attack  should be planned to the second in order to
cause  maximum  confusion  and embarassment to the target defences - and to
minimise  the  chances  of  one  aircraft  being  damaged  by  the blast of
another`s  weapons.   On  the  way to and from the target, Tornado IDS will
normally  fly  in  widely spaced tactical formations, and its impossible to
hold your place in the formation by eye.  Absolutely precise timekeeping is
a  necessity  if  the  mission  flightplan is to stand any chance at all of
surviving contact with reality.

When  the  mission  flightplan is created, most of the waypoints are tagged
with  planned  times-of-arrival.   When  the  aircraft  is flying towards a
selected  waypoint  which has a set time-of-arrival, the navigation systems
continuously  calculate  a  predicted  time-of arrival on the basis of your
current  position and speed.  The difference in seconds between the planned
and  predicted  figures is shown as the Time Early / Late.  The TEL line on
the  AFDS display is self explanatory, but the TEL display on the HUD needs
description, though it`s simple once you know how it works.

When the TEL HUD display is active, it appears as a short vertical line and
three  horizontally  spaced dots just below the HUD Airpeed indicator.  The
vertical  line  moves  sideways between the centre position and the outside
dots, left for late and right for early.  If you`re right on time, the line
is below the centre dot:  if it's at the left dot you`re 30 seconds late or
more;  at  the  right  dot  you`re  early  by  30 seconds or more.  Smaller
deflections left or right indicate smaller deviations from the schedule.

While  the TEL displays make really accurate timekeeping much easier you`ll
find  it difficult to achieve this in practice unless you have some idea of
what speed the mission plan required over each leg of the flightplan.  This
subject  is treated in much more detail in the Mission Planner chapter, but
in general you won't go far wrong if you assume that the flightplan expects
a  cruising  speed  of  420  knots,  rising to 500-600 knots for attack and
egress runs.

The  drill  for adjusting your speed to stay on schedule might go something
like this:

1.   Adjust Autothrottle setting for the nominal speed over the current leg
of the flightplan

2.   Wait for the aircraft speed to adjust to the new setting and watch the
TEL  indicator.   If you`re late, adjust the speed upward, if early, reduce
it.   Remember  that  the adjustment won`t act the TL calculation until the
actual aircraft speed has changed.

3.   Keep  an  eye on the figure as well, if possible.  The further you are
from  the  waypoint, the less accurate the TEL fIgure is.  Unless you`re on
an  attack  run,  don`t  bother to adjust small discrepancies until the TTG
figure shows less than a minute to go to the waypoint.

When  the  aircraft  reaches  the currently selected waypoint while in AFDS
Track  mode,  the next waypoint in the flightplan is automatically selected
and  the  aircraft  turns towards it.  If it`s a target, you`ll need to hit
"arm  air-to  ground  weapons".   The AFDS can fly most planned attacks for
itself,  though  you`ll  need  to  fly  loft profiles manually, and weapons
cannot be released unless you hold down the Commit button.  See the Weapons
Conversion  chapter  for more details.  If the aircraft reaches an Approach
Point  within  an  allied ILS beam while under Track mode control, the AFDS
will automatically switch to Approach mode for landing.  If you want to fly
parts  of  the  flightplan  manually  you`ll  have  to advance the selected
waypoint  yourself  at  the end of each leg using the Skip Waypoint command
(see below).

When you reach a waypoint and the aircraft turns onto the next leg, the TEL
displays  will  not  be  active  until  the nose is pointing in the general
direction of the next waypoint.  Don`t adjust your speed during the turn if
you  can  avoid it.  There are two good reasons for this:  a) you can`t see
the  indicator,  and  b)  the  mission  flightplan assumes that even if the
planned  speeds for the two legs are different, you won`t change your speed
until you`ve finished the turn.

It will take some time and practice before you become proficient at keeping
to your timetable, which is why this "Nav.  Exercise" mission exists.  Once
you  are  familiar  with  the  Mission  Planner  you can construct your own
exercises  if  you  wish, starting either from here or from the Free Flight
(from  runway)  option  Until  you  can  fly accurately to schedule, you`re
nothing but a menace on a multi-aircraft mission.

Having  said all this, it`s a foregone conclusion that things will still go
wrong for you, as long as the enemy refuses to cooperate.  So what then?

Desperate Measures:  Skipping Waypoints

Suppose  that  you`re flying an operational mission, you`re on track and on
schedule,  and  then  suddenly  your  Radar Warning Receiver tells you that
there`s  an  unexpected  AAA unit ahead, or an interceptor coming your way?
Either  you  abandon  the  mission  or  you  try to find a way to dodge the
hazard.   If  you  decide  to press on you`re going to have to manoeuvre or
change  your  speed  or  both,  and that will definitely interfere with the
timetable.  Assuming that you do evade the threat, there`s only so much you
can  do  in  the  way  of  speeding  up or slowing down before you run into
problems with stalling speeds, limiting speeds or fuel constraints.

One  of  the  options  open  to you is to cut a corner.  This might run you
straight  into  a  new hazard, but it could be your only chance to make the
target  on  time.  This is why the Skip Waypoint command exists.  It`s very
simple  to use; just move to the back seat, call up the PLN display if it`s
not  already visible, and hit the Skip Waypoint key (probably N) to advance
the  currently selected waypoint to the next in sequence.  You can use this
command  from  the  front  seat  if you wish, but it`s easier to see what`s
going on if you watch the PLN display.

You  can repeat the comand as many times as you like, and cycle all the way
through the list again if you overshoot, but if you leave the AFDS in Track
mode  while  you  do  it, be aware that the aircraft is going to twitch all
over  the  place  in  response  to  the flurry of rapidly changing steering
demands.   Even  more significantly, the altitude authority mode and height
setting  may  change from waypoint to waypoint, possibly running you into a
hill.  To avoid this problem disengage the AFDS and either fly the aircraft
manually  or  re  engage  in  plain TF mode until you`ve selected the right
waypoint.

SETTING UP YOUR OWN APPROACH AND LANDING

If  you`re  following  a properly made flightplan and nothing goes wrong en
route  you  can  arrive at the Approach Point under AFDS Track mode control
flying  in  the right direction to make a straight-in approach.  There will
be  times  though,  when you`ll need to approach from another direction, or
land  at  another  airfield  altogether.   Let`s look at how to do this for
yourself;  now  that  you`ve  been  introduced  to  the  map  displays, the
Target-of-Opportunity waypoint and AFDS Track mode it`s not too hard to do,
or to explain.

The  problem  breaks  down  into two main sections:  1) Finding a runway to
land  on,  and  2)  Setting up to approach it from a sensible direction and
distance,  so that you can use the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and AFDS
Approach  mode if you wish.  If you want to follow this exercise through in
the  Simulator,  select a "Free Flight (start airborne)" mission, but don`t
try  to  set  up  to  land  on  the airfield beneath your starting position
without first flying a good way away from it.

Finding a runway, placing an Approach Point

Finding  a  runway  isn`t  difficult if you use the map displays.  The Full
screen  map,  zoomed well out, is probably the best one to start with.  Use
this  to find an airfield which is neither too close, nor too far away, and
remember  roughly which way it is from your current position (remember, the
map rotates so that your aircraft is always flying straight up the screen).

Now switch to the back cockpit and call up the Scrollable map on one of the
Tab displays.  Use Alt +left click to centre on your current position, zoom
right  out  and  scroll  the map in the right direction to find your target
airfield.  Refer back to the Full screen map if necessary to find your way.
When  you  bring  the  airfield  on screen you will be able to see that the
active runway (the one you want to use) is shown in a contrasting colour.

If  there`s  a  significant  wind blowing, landing in one direction will be
vastly  preferable  to  landing the other way, but we`ll leave this subject
for later.  With the airfield on screen and the Scrollable Map zoomed right
out,  click  the  left mouse button to place waypoint T about 7 or 8 runway
lengths  from  the  airfield,  IN  LINE  WITH  THE  RUNWAY.  You now have a
home-made  approach point.  Hit T to make waypoint T the currently-selected
waypoint, and you can engage Track mode to fly you there.

Why put the Approach Point there?

At  this point we need to remind ourselves of the size and shape of the ILS
coverage,  but  we`ll leave till later the details of how the system works.
As  you  can  see from diagram that the ILS beams cover a spike shaped zone
which is widest and highest at its furthest point from the runway.  This is
about  60000  feet  (10  nautical  miles  or 18 kilometres) from the runway
threshold.   Since  all the active runways you`ll find in Tornado are about
8000  feet long, this means that the big end of the wedge is almost exactly
8 runway-lengths from the middle of the runway That`s why we advised you to
place  waypoint  T  at  that  distance from the runway end.  You`ll have to
enter  the  ILS  zone and point the aircraft in roughly the right direction
before  the  ILS  displays  will  activate  and  AFDS  Approach mode can be
engaged.

You  can  see  from  diagram 88B that the beam is 8000 feet high at extreme
range, and the AFDS will find it easiest to line up for the approach if you
enter  the  beam  near the centre, so set the AFDS for Altitude hold (still
under  Track  mode)  at  about  8000 feet.  The next question, and the most
important,  concerns  how you`re going to line up for the approach when you
reach waypoint T.  This depends entirely upon the angle between the line of
runway   (call  it  the  centreline),  and  the  line  along  which  you`re
approaching waypoint T.

How to line up for your Approach

Diagrams  8.9 A,B and C illustrate a number of situations and possible ways
of  dealing  with  them.   You  can  find  out  which  diagram most closely
resembles  your  real-life  situation  by  looking  at  the  scrollable map
display.   Because  this  display rotates to keep your aircraft pointing up
the  screen,  you  should  be  able  to tell at a glance what sort of angle
you`ll need to turn through in order to line up.

Take  special  note  that  whenever  the  approach is from anything like an
unfavourable  angle we show the aircraft turning the longer rather than the
shorter  way round towards the runway.  Once you`ve acquired experience and
confidence  you  won`t  have to do it this way all the time, but as diagram
8.9D shows, it gives you far more space and time to line up.

As  you  approach waypoint T, call up the Local Map on the MFD, select Base
Origin display (aircraft at the bottom, not in the middle) and look out for
the  letter  T  marking  the  position.   When  you  get  close, cancel the
Autothrottle  and disengage the AFDS, then start your turn.  If you make it
a  tight turn you`ll lose a good deal of speed as well as staying closer to
your  reference  point.  If you think your speed is dropping ominously low,
lower  the  nose  a  few  degrees below the horizon, slacken off the turn a
little,  sweep  the wings forward, put down manoeuvre flap, and if all else
fails, throttle up.

Keep an eye on the outside world and the Local Map so that you know when to
stop  the  turn.   Remember  that  it`s  not  good enough just to point the
aircraft  at  the  airfield; you`ve got to be more or less in line with the
runway.   If  you`re off the centreline, line the aircraft up to cross it a
fair  distance  out (see diagram 8.10).  If you do this even halfway right,
you  should  see  the  HUD  switch  mode  as  you enter ILS coverage.  Your
troubles are almost over!

Almost,  but not quite.  There`s still one potential problem Once you`re in
the  beam  you can engage the AFDS in Approach mode, but if you`re crossing
the  centreline  at  too  great  an  angle  and too high a speed you`ll fly
straight out of the other side of the beam before the AFDS can line Up (see
diagram 8.11 ).  If this happens, the AFDS will turn itsell off and sound a
warning.   It`s  almost  always possible to haul the aircraft back into the
beam  and  recover  the  situation,  but  it`s  better to avoid the problem
altogether  This  is one reason why it`s a good idea to enter the beam at a
fairly  low  speed  -  say  no  more  than  350  knots.  The other and more
significant  way  to avoid the problem is to ensure that the closer you get
to the centreline, the smaller the angle at which you`ll cross it.  This is
illustrated  in  diagram  8.12, and is effectively what you'll be doing all
the  way down the approach once you learn to fly it manually, which is what
we'll be looking at next.

SEMI-AUTOMATIC AND MANUAL LANDINGS

AFDS  Approach  mode  control  is  a  neat  and  useful aid, but any self -
respecting pilot should be able to fly the entire approach and land by hand
with  a minimum of automatic help or (s)he will have no choice but to eject
if  the  AFDS  fails  or  the  airfield  ILS  system  is  bombed  out.  The
sophistication  of  the  Tornado  systems  means  that  there  is  an  easy
intermediate stage between a fully automatic and a fully manual landing.

Semi-automatic Approach:- ILS and Autothrottle

In this type of approach we`ll use the ILS (Instrument Landing System) as a
manual steering cue, and leave speed management to the Autothrottle.  First
let`s  look  at the ILS system in detail.  Your aircraft's ILS displays are
driven  by transmitters and aerials on the ground, pointing up the approach
path.    There  are  effectively  two  fan-shaped  radio  beams;  one  (the
Localiser)  to  tell you whether you are to the left or to the right of the
runway  centreline,  and the other (the Glideslope) to tell you whether you
are  above  or below a steady 3o slope which meets the ground at the runway
threshold.  The coverage of these two beams defines a square wedge with one
side resting on the ground and the point at the runway threshold.  To avoid
your  being misled by weak and possibly distorted signals, there is a sharp
range  cut-off,  so the blunt end of the wedge is flat.  This end defines a
square  "hoop"  in  the sky with 8000 feet (2440 M,) sides.  To exploit the
maximum  range  of the system, you need to enter the beam by flying through
this hoop.  See diagram 8.8A for a full schematic.

In  the  aircraft,  the  localiser  and  glideslope  beams are received and
interpreted  to  drive ILS displays, which are provided in triplicate (HUD,
MFD  and  HSI  displays)  because  in  the worst of weather conditions your
chances  of  landing  safely  without  ILS  assistance  are very slim.  The
easiest  form  of the display to use is the one which automatically appears
on  the  HUD  when you enter ILS coverage with the HUD in standard NAV mode
(i.e  no  weapon  aiming  displays).   On the HUD ILS display, the aircraft
datum  in  the  centre is shown as a cross and a second, larger cross moves
left,  right,  up and down to indicate which way it is to the centre of the
ideal  approach  path.   When  you  are  in  the centre of the path the two
crosses are exactly superimposed.

For  comparison you can call up the MFD ILS display by using the D key (MFD
Function  Select)  to  cycle  through  the possible displays.  Here the ILS
display  shows  fixed dashed crosshairs equivalent to the aircraft datum on
the  HUD  and moving solid crosshairs which correspond to the larger moving
cross.  This display also shows, clockwise from top left; Aircraft Heading,
Bearing  to  the  airfield  (to runway midpoint).  Range to the airfield in
nautical  miles (to runway midpoint) and Time to go in minutes and seconds.
The  two ILS needles on the HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) instrument
are minute and hard to read; we only provide them as a last-ditch backup in
case both HUD and MFD are unserviceable for a foul-weather landing.

Leading and Reacting to the ILS display

On  the  face  of  it,  then,  reaching the ideal approach path is simply a
question  of  flying  the  aircraft towards the cross on the HUD.  It`s not
quite that simple there are two other points to bear in mind.  The first is
that  the  ILS  display  is  only telling you where you are relative to the
ideal  approach path - it is NOT telling you if you`re pointed in the right
direction  to stay there.  To stay in the centre of the localiser beam (the
left-right  reference) you need to be pointing in the same direction as the
runway  you`re  approaching.  If you`re landing on runway 09 the aircraft`s
got  to  be on a heading of 090° as well as in the centre of the beam Don`t
make  big,  radical manoeuvres to try to reach the centre of the beam - the
closer you get to it, the smaller your corrections should be.

This  is a highly important point, and one which many people find difficult
to  grasp:  if the ILS display is telling you that the runway centreline is
off  to  the  left  of  your current position, it`s NOT telling you to keep
turning  left  until you reach it.  If you`re approaching runway 09 and the
ILS  shows that the centreline is off to the left, what you should be doing
is  taking  up a heading to the left of 090o (say 080 or 085°), so that you
reach  the centreline before you arrive at the threshold.  In the same way,
if the ILS showed the centreline to the right, you should take up a heading
to  the  right of 090 (say 095 or 100°).  Hold that until the ILS shows you
that  you  are  close  to  the  centreline, and then bring the heading back
towards 090.  If you correct your heading in this way but find that the ILS
is not creeping back towards the centre, only then should you make a bigger
correction.

The  second  point to remember is that the glideslope beam (the up and down
reference)  slopes down.  You cannot track the glideslope centreline unless
the  aircraft  is  descending  steadily.   Just  as  in  lining  up  on the
localiser;  the  closer you get to the centreline, the more slowly you want
to approach it.  We`ll deal with the classical method of using the throttle
to  manage  your  rate of descent when we look at purely manual approaches;
here  we`re going to cheat by using the Autothrottle to hold a steady speed
while you actually fly the approach path using the stick only

Don`t be Hypnotised by the Instruments

As  you  get  closer  to  touchdown  and the runway looms larger you should
transfer your attention from the ILS cues to the outside world.  The ILS is
highly  useful when the runway is distant, but in all except the very worst
visibility  the  last  stages of the approach will be much easier to fly by
eye.   It`ll also be much easier to achieve the shortest possible touchdown
and landing run.

Setting your Approach Speed

So  what  do  we tell the Autothrottle?  If you remember, approach speed is
calculated by taking stalling speed in the current configuration and adding
a  percentage.   Stalling  speed  for  the Tornado depends on 1) Wind Sweep
position, 2) Flap setting and 3) Aircraft weight, so there`s a lot of scope
for  variation.   We  give  a  ready  reckoner  approach speed table in the
Aircrew  Notes, but here`s a simplified version of it predigested for three
different weights:

Recommended Approach Speeds at 25° Wingsweep

           Weight:   Flap Setting:

                    Zero  Man`vre  Mid   Full
           Light     180    172    153   135
           Medium    210    202    183   165
           Heavy     248    240    221   203


Light case:      33000lb / 15000kg - Virtually empty aircraft
Medium case:     45000lb / 20400kg - No external stores" full internal fuel
Heavy case:      60000lb / 27200kg - Near maximum take-off weight

Note  that we only give figures for 25° wingsweep here.  You`d never expect
to  touch  down with the wings in any other sweep position unless the sweep
mechanism  itself jammed - we`ll try that later.  While you can drastically
speed  up the process of approach and landing by coming in at higher speeds
and  decelerating  at  the  last minute, don`t try it until you really know
what you`re doing.

The  medium  weight case is probably the most useful:  set the Autothrottle
to  about  210  knots  to  bring you within flap-limiting speeds, lower the
flaps  all  the  way  and  then set 165-180 knots.  Just be aware that this
won`t  work  if  the aircraft is too heavy.  If you`re carrying more weight
than  this  it  would  normally  be  sensible  to dump some of it using the
External Stores Jettison option before starting the approach.

When  setting the Autothrottle as low as this you must remember that you`re
not far above stalling speed.  If you manoeuvre hard to chase the localiser
needle  or  point  the nose high in the air to climb to the glidepath, your
airspeed may fall to the danger point.

Another  way  of  gauging  the correct approach speed is to watch the Alpha
(Angle  of  Attack)  meter - either the HUD display or the mechanical guage
next  to  it.   If  you`re in the right speed range for an approach at your
current  weight,  the  reading  should generally be somewhere between 8 and
12°.   If  it`s higher than this then you`re too slow, if lower then you`re
too  fast.   Check the Approach & Landing Emergencies section at the end of
the Aircrew Notes for the figures to use in unusual cases.

Semi-automatic Approaches - Summing up

Provided  that  you understand what the ILS display is telling you, and you
can  fly  the aircraft to centre it in the beams ON THE RUNWAY HEADING with
the  Autothrottle  holding  a  sensible  airspeed, you should arrive at the
runway  threshold  in  good  shape for touchdown.  Use the Landing Practice
Setup in the Simulator until you`re confident that you can track the ILS by
hand.
 
There  is  one  further  technique  you may find helpful for making small
corrections  left  or  right  to  track  the  localiser  - using the rudder
controls.   We  havent  said much about the rudder so far, and we won`t say
much  more,  because  in  modern aircraft it`s almost redundant as a manual
control,  and  has  a very limited effect at any but the lowest speeds.  On
the  approach, however it can be useful.  Look up the rudder commands under
Primary Flight Controls in the Control Summary.

MANUAL APPROACHES

Once  you  can  fly  a  semi-automatic  approach as described above, you`ve
mastered  the  art of reading the ILS and acquired a feeling for the art of
correcting  into  the  centre of the beam without overshooting.  There is a
furthur challenge you may wish to take up:  purely manual landings with and
without  the  aid  of the ILS.  If you can do everything we`ve discussed so
far, you should be able to handle this without too much trouble and no self
respecting  pilot  should  ever  be satisfied until (s)he can land with the
absolute  minimum  of  artificial  aids  The  AFDS, the Autothrottle or the
airfield  ILS may be knocked out by battle damage.  You may have to make an
emergency  landing  on  a  airfield, taxi track or a road.  In any of these
cases  you`ve  got  to be able to cope.  If you can`t, you can only eject -
and throw away an extremely valuable aircraft

Manual Approach with ILS

Here we`re talking about flying an approach without using the Autothrottle.
Managing speed at the same time as flying the approach adds considerably to
the  difficulty  and  demands a quite different flight technique.  Normally
you  think  in terms of controlling speed with the throttle and controlling
rate  of  descent  or  climb  by  pointing the nose up or down.  At the low
speeds  involved  in flying an approach.  However, it is actually easier to
reverse  this  convention.   Think in terms of controlling speed by raising
the  nose (to slow down) or lowering the nose (to speed up) and controlling
rate  of  desecent  by  opening  the  throttle  (to descend more slowly) or
closing the throttle (to descend faster)

Obviously  there  will  be  side  the nose will usually reduce your rate of
descent  as  well  as  your airspeed, and so on, but these side effects are
actually  easier  to  deal  with using the reversed convention of airspeed,
pitch  and  rate  of-descent:  thrust.  Let`s give some examples of how the
process works:

1.  Speed correct, but BELOW the glideslope

You  respond by throttling up to raise the engine RPM figure one or two per
cent.   Now  watch  your airspeed.  As soon as this starts rising above the
target  figure,  raise the nose slightly to bring the speed back on target.
The  end  result  is  that  you`re still at the correct approach speed, and
you`re descending more slowly than you were.

2 Speed correct, but ABOVE the glideslope

Throttle  back a little.  As the airspeed drops below the target, lower the
nose a little to recover the speed.

3 ON the glideslope, but speed LOW

Lower  the  nose  slightly, and watch for the speed to start rising.  As it
reaches  the  correct  figure, raise the nose again very slightly.  If this
leaves you below the glideslope refer to example 1.

4 ON the glideslope, but speed HIGH

Raise  the  nose  a little till the speed starts to drop.  Wait till you`re
close  to the target speed and then lower it a fraction to stabilise at the
new  speed.  If this leaves you above the glideslope, deal with the problem
as in example 2.

It`ll  take  a  lot  of  practice  in  the Simulator before you can do this
reliably.   To  make  your  initial  attempts easier, use a higher approach
speed  than  normal  This  will  give  you  more  margin for error.  You`ll
probably  find  that the largest problem is the time lag in engine response
to  throttle  changes,  and aircraft response to the change in thrust.  For
this  reason  it`s  best  to try to avoid large changes of throttle setting
unless  absolutely necessary.  Having said that there`s no way to avoid one
large  throttle  movement:   your  first  action  in  the Simulator Landing
Practice  scenario should normally be to close the throttle completely (and
use  airbrakes)  in  order to lose speed.  As your speed decays towards the
chosen  approach  value  you will need to open the throttle again, but it`s
best to do this in gradual stages, starting well above the approach speed.

Until  you`ve  got  the  feel  of  the  situation  its best to be very very
cautious  and  make  the  smallest possible control inputs.  Line up on the
localiser  (left-right  reference)  first,  and  then  devote  most of your
attention to matching the glideslope by juggling speed and rate-of-descent.
Be  wary  of trying to fly to a fixed rate of descent in feet per second as
shown on the HUD or the VSI; the higher your approach speed, the faster you
must descend to match the fixed 3o glideslope.

This  sort  of  flying takes intense concentration and a thorough practical
understanding  of  how  and why the aircraft responds to the controls.  Its
very hard work.  If you want a break from the grind, try some purely visual
landings  (see  below).  But if you can learn do this.  Be assured that you
could learn to land most aircraft in the real world.

Manual Landings by Eye

Purely  visual landings are actually far easier than manual ILS approaches.
Once  you`ve  got  the  knack.   If you`re going for a straight-in approach
(like  an  ILS approach) you`ll usually find that it`s best to start closer
to  the airfield and higher than usual.  This will improve your view of the
runway,  and  it  will also mean that you can fly most of the approach with
the  throttle  more  or less closed, using brief bursts of power to stretch
your glide.

You  will  probably  also  find  that  it`s  easier  if you fly most of the
approach  a  little  faster than usual, with manoeuvre or mid flap settings
and  the  gear  up.  This means that you can drop the gear and the flaps at
the  last  minute as extra airbrakes, rather than hang about on the edge of
the stall point.  Use the Angle of Attack to judge your approach speed.

If  you`re  really  ambitious,  you  might  try  a standard military curved
circuit approach.  Lining up on the runway from the final 180o turn is more
difficult than in real life because of the restricted and inflexlible views
available  from  the cockpit - something which we can`t do much about until
Virtual Reality style helmet mounted displays become commonplace.

Once  you become accustomed to visual, manual landings you`ll probably find
yourself  doing it this way most of the time.  The ILS is a godsend in poor
visibility,  but  it takes a long time to fly the full distance at approach
speeds.   You can put the aircraft on the ground much faster for yourself -
provided that you can see to do it.

LANDINGS AND WIND DIRECTION

Up  to  now  we`ve  more  or less ignored the influence that wind speed and
direction  has on landing, but in the real world it`s a major safety issue.
The  "Landing  Practice" Simulator exercise gives you still air, which is a
very  rare  situation  in  real  life.  In practice the wind direction will
dictate  your  take  off and landing direction and the length of ground run
required.

The  reason  isn`t  all that hard to understand.  If an aircraft was flying
straight   and   level  at  an  Airspeed  of  150  knots  directly  into  a
hurricane-force  wind  blowing  at  150  knots, it would be hovering over a
point  on  the ground.  The Airspeed Indicator shows your speed through the
air,  which  is itself moving over the ground as the wind blows.  To take a
more  realistic (though still extreme) example, an aircraft flying directly
into a 50-knot wind at an airspeed of 150 knots is actually travelling over
the  ground  at 100 knots.  If that aircraft flew at the same airspeed (150
knots)  in  the  same  direction as the 50-knot wind it would be travelling
over  the ground at 200 knots.  In both cases, the wind speed and direction
make no difference to the flying qualities of the aircraft - its flying the
way  you  would  expect  it to at an airspeed of 150 knots.  The difference
lies in how fast it`s covering ground.

Speed  over  the  ground  makes  at least two important differences when it
comes  to  landing.   The first is in the approach.  If you`re landing into
the  wind,  subtracting  its  speed  from  your own, the approach will take
longer and you`ll need a lower rate of descent than you would in still air.
This may be tedious, but it`s not unsafe.  If you land with the wind behind
you,  adding  its  speed to yours, everything will happen faster and you`ll
need  to  descend faster than usual to stay on the glideslope.  Rushing the
process is clearly not desirable.

The  other (and more important) difference comes when you touch down.  When
your  wheels  hit  the  runway  airspeed ceases to matter (you`re no longer
flying), and groundspeed becomes all-important.  Landing into the wind your
groundspeed  is  lower and your landing run shorter.  Landing downwind your
groundspeed  is  higher  and  your  braking distance increases.  The choice
should be obvious.

Wind  direction  also  matters  for take-off, for similar reasons.  If your
aircraft  standing  on  the runway facing into a 20-knot wind, it need only
accelerate  to  a  groundspeed  of  130 knots before the Airspeed indicator
shows  150  knots  and  you  can rotate to lift off.  If you started with a
20-knot  wind  blowing  past the aircraft from behind, you`d need to roll a
lot further to reach a groundspeed of 170 knots in order to have an airflow
of  150  knots over the wing.  Everything which flies and has a brain takes
off  and  lands  facing INTO wind whenever possible.  If it isn`t possible,
you may be in trouble.

Crosswinds

When  an  airfield is built the designers do their best to line up the main
(or  only) runway with the prevailing wind in the area, so that most of the
time  aircraft  will  be  able  to  take  off  and land directly into wind.
Sometimes,   however,   geography   and  financial  constraints  make  this
impossible; the longest possible runway on the site just has to run in some
other  direction.   The wind is also less than 100% reliable, and will blow
from inconvenient directions at least a part of the time.

You  can`t  usually  suspend  operations  altogether  because the wind isnt
cooperating;  you  just  have  to  make the best of it.  Unless the wind is
blowing  across  the  runway  exactly at right-angles, which it very rarely
does,  you  can always resolve it into a component along the runway (a head
wind  or  tail wind), and a component across it, the crosswind (see diagram
8.21  ).   When  the  time comes to learn about the Mission Planner; you`ll
find  that  there`s  help  available  to analyse the situation and help you
select  sensible  take  off  and  landing  directions.   Here and now we`re
concerned with how to deal with the practical results.

It  shouldn`t  take much reflection to decide that you want to take off and
land with a head-wind rather than a tail wind.  But whatever you do, you`ll
just  have  to live with the crosswind component.  A crosswind component at
take  off will make very little difference to a heavy and powerful aircraft
like  the  Tornado,  but  a stiff crosswind will make a large difference to
your approach.

There`s  a Simulator exercise called "Crosswind Landing Practice" which you
can  try  out.   You`ll  find that in order to fly a straight line down the
centre of the beam you will need to keep the nose pointing a few degrees to
the upwind side of the centreline.  If you point the aircraft straight down
the  beam,  it`ll  be  blown  sideways  by  the  crosswind  component.   Be
especially careful at and after touchdown when flying this sort of approach
-  you  may need to do some brisk steering to avoid veering off the runway.
If  you  can  afford a good long roll after touchdown, you can mitigate the
effects  of  a crosswind by flying a faster approach than usual.  This will
mean that you can point the nose closer to your intended path.  Conversely,
a  slow  approach  with  a  heavy  crosswind  will be very difficult to fly
accurately.

LANDING DAMAGED AIRCRAFT

You  can  practice various emergencies quite easily in the Simulator.  Want
to  try  a  wheels  up  landing?   Simple!   Just leave the gear up.  It is
possible,  but  you  must touch down very lightly.  Lighten the aircraft as
much  as possible, but you a flapless landing, leave the flaps up.  Pretend
that  the  wing  sweep mechanism has failed, and try landing with 45 or 67°
sweep  (check  the  Approach  &  Landing  Emergencies  data  in the Aircrew
Reference  section  first!).  Try a landing with the engines at idle thrust
without touching the throttles.

For  a  real  dead-stick  landing, do a maximum jettison then light up full
reheat  to  burn off the remaining internal fuel.  Keep the aircraft at low
level and that won`t take long.  When the engines flame out, zoom-climb the
aircraft  to turn as much speed as you can spare into altitude.  If you can
find  a runway, well and good - if you can reach it.  If not, it`ll have to
be  a road.  Try to find a stretch without bridges.  Obviously the aircraft
will  glide  furthest  in a shallow dive at 25 sweep, but that`s not saying
much  - no fast jet glides well.  Hold off on the flaps and the gear to the
very last minute unless you have speed or altitude to burn.

There  is  also  a  special-purpose Simulator mission called "Single Engine
Handling"  -  try  it.  If you examine the Control Summary you`ll find that
you can turn off the HUD, the MFD or the back-seat Tab displays.  Flying on
the  panel  instruments  without  the HUD is difficult but possible, and an
excellent way to put some excitement back into the job of landing if you`re
beginning to find it too easy.

On Damaged Runways

Don`t  forget that while you`re off trying to crater the enemy`s runways he
may  visit your home airfield to return the compliment.  Apart from leaving
your  gear  up,  it`s  hard  to  think  of a more humiliating way to end an
otherwise  successful  mission  than  to  land  perfectly  and then run the
aircraft into a hole on the roll out.  Keep your eyes open on the approach,
and  use  the  forward looking camera at night.  If your runway is damaged,
you`ve either got to stop before, land after or swerve around the craters -
or  land  on  another  runway.  If you dont want to divert or you can`t for
lack  of  fuel,  you  must either land on one of the long taxiways or use a
disused  runway  (these  are the ones with white crosses at the threshold).
Provided  that  they  haven't  been  damaged  in the attack, these surfaces
should be perfectly suitable, though respectively narrower and shorter than
the  main  runway,  and  of  course  there`s no ILS.  Watch out for taxying
aircraft  on  the  taxiways and parked aircraft on the disused runways.  In
the Simulator there's nothing to stop you trying a landing like this at any
time  If  you really want to get into the spirit of the thing you might try
attacking  your  own airfield and then landing - it'll give you a whole new
perspective  on JP233 attacks ln the last resort you can always try landing
on a nearby road.

EMERGENCIES

Emergencies  divide into two rough categories; recoverable ones which offer
some  prospect  of saving the aircraft as well as yourself, and those where
you  must abandon the aircraft in order to save your life.  The tricky part
is deciding which kind of emergency you`re facing, and doing so fast enough
to take the appropriate action in time.

Emergencies  include  systems  failures  and loss of control for any reason
We`ve  already dealt with stall recovery, and suggested Simulator exercises
to  practise landing with various equipment failures.  If you make yourself
familiar  with  the controls available you can simulate and try out a great
many system failures, and the exercise can only do you good.

Here  we`ll discuss three topics;jettisoning stores to lighten the aircraft
ejection  and  spin  recovery  drill.  Jettisoning weight will usually mean
aborting  your  mission,  but it will always improve the performance of the
aircraft  if you still have control.  Ejection is always the right response
in  any of the following situations; Engine Fire, permanent loss of control
at  any  altitude,  any  loss of control at low altitude.  The Tornado will
never spin unless the SPILS system is disabled or damaged, but when it does
the recovery technique is highly unconventional.

Jettison Options

There  are  three graduated jettison commands, and three matching lights on
the Front Panel.  In increasing order of severity these are:

Jettison External Tanks only

Releases the drop tanks on your inboard pylons to save weight and drag.  If
the  tanks  are empty then you improve performance and range at the expense
of  losing  re-usable  tanks,  the supply of which is not infinite.  If the
tanks  still contain fuel then the relative performance improvement will be
far  greater,  but  you  will  probably have sacrificed range or endurance.
This  may  prevent  you  from completing your mission, or returning from it
safely,  but  if a Tornado is involved in any kind of close air combat your
chance  of surviving, let alone winning is not good unless you dump as much
weight as possible.

The green Jettison light illuminates to confirm separation

Jettison Tanks and Offensive Stores

This  is  the  option you need if hard-pressed by an enemy fighter in close
combat,  or  in  the  event of engine damage.  It dumps all external stores
except AIM9L air-to-air missiles for self-defence.

The amber and green Jettison lights illuminate to confirm separation.

Jettison All External Stores and Internal Fuel down to 1000 lbs / 450 kg

This  option is intended for use just before landing a damaged aircraft, if
the   situation  demands  it.   All  external  stores  are  dumped  without
exception,  and  all  internal  fuel bar 1000lbs with which to complete the
approach,  leaving  you  with  an aircraft in its lightest possible powered
configuration.

The  red,  amber  and  green Jettison lights will all illuminate to confirm
that the stores are gone and the fuel dumped.

Ejection

Ejection  itself is a very simple action once activated.  The system thinks
for  itself and does its best to maximise your chances of survival right up
to  the point when it opens your parachute for you.  However, it`s still up
to  you  to  decide  when to pull the handle.  You must decide for yourself
whether  a)  the  situation  is  so  dire  that  you  must eject now or you
definitely  won`t survive, b) with the aircraft in its current attitude you
probably  won`t  survive ejection, or C) the aircraft will probably stay in
one  piece,  under  control,  for  long enough to allow you to manoeuvre to
improve your chance to survive or avoid capture

There  are two situations in which ejection is definitely the only way out.
These  are an engine fire, which (for our purposes) will always result in a
catastrophic  explosion  within a few seconds, or a loss of control with no
prospect  of  recovery before the aircraft hits the ground.  If and when an
engine  fire  is  detected the warning system will go off and the condition
will  be flagged on the Warning Panel in the back cockpit.  Loss of control
can occur in many different ways, but you will probably be in no doubt when
it  occurs.   All  that  remains  is to decide whether your chances will be
improved by waiting and normally, they wont.

The  Tornado`s  ejection  seats,  like  those  in  almost all modern combat
aircraft  have  what  is  called a zero / zero capability the zeros are for
altitude  and  airspeed.   In  other words, you can eject from a motionless
aircraft  on  the ground and expect to survive.  The seat contains a rocket
motor  to lift you and throw you far enough away that a) your parachute has
time  to  deploy  before  you hit the ground and b) with any luck you won`t
come  straight  back  down on top of the burning wreckage of your aircraft.
The seat is quite smart, and will do its best to tailor its response to the
situation but there are unavoidable limits to what you can expect.  Because
the  ejection system fires the seats upward from the cockpit, ejecting with
the aircraft inverted is suicidal at low level.

At the other end of the scale, ejection at a high Mach number is also risky
because  of  the  appalling  air blast.  Another hazard is involved because
high  speed  usually  means  high altitude.  The seat mechanism contains an
automatic  opening  device which will normally delay the deployment of your
parachute  till  you have fallen to a survivable altitude (10000-20000 feet
might  be  a  common  setting)  and  decelerated  to a sensible speed.  The
mechanisms  involved  are  simple, robust and highly reliable, but they are
not  immune  to  damage - and they are designed to fail safe.  If possible.
For an automatic parachute opening device, failing safe means deploying the
parachute  sooner  rather  than later (or not at all).  All parachutes open
harder the higher the deployment altitude, and a high-speed opening at high
altitude  may  cause serious injury or death through opening shock (even in
the  normal  case  this  might involve a 20 G jolt), or through the risk of
anoxia and exposure on the way down.

If  time  and the situation allow, the best way to maximise your chances is
to  eject  at  low speed (up to 300 knots, say) at a moderate altitude (say
10000  to  15000  feet).  When all is sad and done, however, there are many
situations  where  ejection  is  the  only option you have left, and if you
don`t pull the handle straight away you won`t get another chance.

SPILS, SPINS AND SPIN RECOVERY

The  Tornado,  like  all modern combat aircraft, has a sophisticated flight
control  system.   In  simple  aircraft  the  pilot`s controls are directly
connected  to  the  control surfaces of the wings and tail, which are moved
either  directly  by  the  pilot`s muscles, or by a servo system which uses
hydraulics  to boost muscle power.  In more sophisticated aircraft like the
Tornado,  the  pilot`s  controls  are not directly connected to the control
surfaces.   Instead, the pilot uses the controls to tell the flight control
system  what he wants the aircraft to do and the flight control system then
decides  for  itself how to move the control surfaces in order to carry out
the pilot`s command.

Without  systems  of  this  sort,  modern  combat aircraft could never have
achieved  their  current  high standard of agility.  They are agile because
they  are  unstable; a small control surface movement can produce a radical
change of attitude, and they have no inherent tendency to fly in a straight
line,  or  even  the  right way up Flying such an unstable aircraft by hand
would  be like walking a tightrope in a high wind; even if you could do it,
the  effort,  concentration  and stress would exhaust you in a few minutes.
When  the  flight  control  system  is  working,  it  constantly senses the
aircraft`s  departures  from  the  commanded  flightpath  and  makes  minor
adjustments  of  the control surfaces to correct them before the pilot even
has time to notice.

Extra  protection  is often built into such a system to enable the pilot to
manoeuvre the aircraft aggressively and confidently right up to the extreme
limits of its performance (as in air combat), while the automatics keep the
G  load  within  the structural limits and monitor the angle of attack.  If
the  aircraft  stalls  despite all their efforts, such systems will then do
all they can to keep the aircraft stable till it regains flying speed.  The
system  which provides this extra safeguard in the Tornado is called SPILS,
standing for Spin Prevention and Incidence Limitation System.

Spinning

Spinning  is  a hazard associated with stalling.  When the airflow over the
wings and the tail breaks down the aircraft is left falling through the air
rather than flying.  If the aircraft is rolling or yawing (changing heading
without   banking)   when   control  is  lost,  a  complex  combination  of
aerodynamic,  inertial  and  gyroscopic forces may arise in which the whole
aircraft  either  rotates constantly round one or more axes (a steady spin)
or  alternates  between  two  unstable positions (an oscillatory spin).  In
this situation normal flight control just doesnt exist, and the aircraft is
falling rapidly out of the sky.

Fast  jets  with  swept wings have the most vicious spin characteristics of
any  aircraft, and some are impossible to recover - all the pilot can do is
eject.   When  it  is  working, the SPILS system in the Tornado detects any
incipient spin problem at the stall point and acts to correct it before the
spin  can  become  established.   Like  any  other  system in the aircraft,
however,  the  SPILS  system  may  be  disabled  by combat damage or random
failure.   If  this happens any stall may develop into a spin - so you need
to know how to recover once the spin has started.

Spin Recovery

The  Tornado`s  spinning characteristics and recovery drill are unusual for
two  reasons; first, it is a swing-wing aircraft and the nature of the spin
changes  with  wing-sweep setting; second, it is unlike most other aircraft
in  that  it  has no aileron control surfaces on the wings, moving the tail
surfaces  differentially instead.  If you are an experienced pilot of other
aircraft types, DON`T ASSUME THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW THE RECOVERY DRILL!

Let`s  set  up  the  problem in the Simulator Select one of the Free Flight
(Airborne)  exercises.   When you arrive in the cockpit, turn off the SPILS
system.   This  should probably be done with the Control+I key combination,
but  check  with  the  Control  Summary  for your machine (Secondary Flight
Controls  section).   Be  careful  when doing this:  just hit the key once,
because  the  control toggles SPlLS on / off and there`s no indicator apart
from  the  one  on  the  wings  right  back  panel  in the back, which only
illuminates  when the system fails due to damage and NOT when you switch it
off   deliberately.   Now  sweep  the  wings  right  back  to  67°"  cancel
Autothrottle  and  go  to  full reheat (Slam Open twice).  Let the aircraft
accelerate  to  high speed on the level, then cancel reheat (just Slam Shut
while  in  reheat).   Leaving  the throttles at Max.  Dry power (100% RPM).
Pull the aircraft up into a near vertical climb and take your hands off the
controls.

The  aircraft will zoom-climb to a high altitude, losing speed rapidly.  At
about  220  knots  IAS  you should see the nose begin to drop in the stall.
Now apply full sideways stick - the direction doesn`t matter.  Suddenly the
aircraft  goes  crazy - the HUD references and the instruments are all over
the  place  and  the  horizon flashes past your nose at short intervals and
strange  angles.   Hit  F1  for  an  external  view and you`ll see that the
aircraft  is  tumbling end over end in all three axes as it falls.  This is
characteristic spinning behaviour when the wings are fully swept.

Now  hit  the  Sweep Forward key twice, to bring the wings to 25 sweep.  As
the  wings  move  forward  you  should see the wild tumble stabilise into a
rapid  rotation.   If  you  move  back to the cockpit you will see that the
horizon  is  now  fairly  stable,  but  the  aircraft  is  twirling  like a
propeller.  In order to recover from the spin you must first identify which
way  the  aircraft  is  rotating.  This one excellent reason why you should
bring  the  wings  to  25 sweep first, because it is extremely difficult to
tell which way you`re going if the aircraft`s in a full blooded tumble.

Having  identified  which way you`re turning:  APPLY AND HOLD FULL BACKWARD
STlCK  AND PRO-SPlN AILERON!  In other words, hold the stick right back and
to  the side you would normally use to bank in the direction you`re already
turning.  This is almost the exact opposite of the spin recovery drill used
in  most  aircraft,  which is classically performed by centering the stick,
pushing  it forward and applying opposite rudder.  This classical procedure
is utterly useless in a spinning Tornado.

Having  applied  full backward stick and pro-spin aileron, you will need to
hold  the  stick in this position for a variable length of time, which will
never  be  less  than a couple of seconds and sometimes a good deal longer.
Meanwhile  watch  the  Altimeter  and  the  Airspeed  Indicator.   Standard
Operating  Procedure in the Tornado is to eject immediately if the aircraft
enters or continues a spin below 20000 (yes, twenty thousand) feet, but you
may  find  that  you are willing to continue recovery procedures below this
height after you have some experience.  The decision is entirely up to you.

In  a  steady  spin the Airspeed Indicator will show a very low figure, far
below  normal  flying  speeds.   One  of  the first signs that the recovery
process  is  working  will be a steady rise of speed.  As the figure climbs
towards  the  normal  ranges  you should also see that the rotation rate is
slowing.    When  it  stops,  the  aircraft  is  under  control  again,  so
immediately  center the stick and (if you can still afford the height loss)
push the nose down to accelerate faster.

Here`s the Spin Recovery Procedure again, in short form:

Once you realise that the aircraft is spinning:

1  Eject  immediately  if  there is insufficient height for a recovery (say
20000  feet),  otherwise  monitor  altitude closely throughout the recovery
process.

2 Command full forward sweep to 25°.

3  As  soon as the direction of rotation is identified, apply and hold full
backward stick and pro spin aileron.

4 First sign of recovery will be a sustained increase in airspeed.

5 When rotation ceases, accelerate to a safe speed as quickly as possible

EXTERNAL VIEWS
--------------

Although  "stepping  outside"  as  you  are  flying  along  is  not exactly
"authentic",  a  different perspective on a problem can often be useful and
let`s  face  it  -  its  fun!   We have included no less than six "external
views"  that  range from the commonplace to the spectacular.  A status line
at the bottom of the screen shows your aircraft speed, altitude etc.

(a) Tracking view

Perhaps  most common of all is the option to "step outside..  your cockpit"
and  watch yourself fly along.  When first selected, you will be positioned
immediately  behind  your aircraft, following at a fixed distance.  If your
prefer, you may use the zoom in and out facility to adjust your perspective
at either normal or fast rate.

When  you`ve  had enough of looking at tailpipes, try the "adjust tracking"
controls.   These allow you to swing your viewpoint around your aircraft in
either  direction, quickly or slowly, to give you a full 360° outside view.
The "reset" option will position you behind the aircraft again and for good
measure  we  have the "toggle lo/hi" feature which puts you level with your
aircraft or slight below it.

It  is  worth  mentioning that when you leave Tracking View, your viewpoint
and  zoom  level  are  stored so that when you next select this option your
viewpoint  appears  just as you left it.  For example, if you wish to watch
an attack from a particular angle say looking back at your aircraft from in
front and below - you can set the viewpoint in advance, fly the attack, and
then switch to Tracking View at the moment of weapon release.

(b) Satellite view

Select  this  option  for a bird`s eye view looking directly down onto your
aircraft.   Select  again  and you`ll get a worm`s eye view looking up from
underneath!   We  do  not  recommend this second option when sitting on the
runway  as all you will get is a close-up of the underside of the fuselage.
The  plan  view  though is very handy when taxiing around the airfield.  We
suggest  that  you zoom out to a reasonable height in order to see ahead of
your aircraft.

(c) Remote view

This  option allows you to hop outside and watch your aircraft from a fixed
position.   The  viewpoint is fixed at the position of your aircraft at the
moment  of  selection,  and turns to follow your aircraft as you manoeuvre.
This  gives  a  superb impression of the true speed of your aircraft and is
great  fun  if  you wish to brush up your radio control techniques but it`s
very easy to get disorientated or lose sight of yourself altogether.....

(d) Drone view

"Drones"  are the numerous computer-controlled aircraft and ground vehicles
moving  around  the  combat area simultaneously to yourself.  By repeatedly
pressing  "drone  view  select"  you may observe their activity and impress
your  friends.  Zoom and track controls are available.  You may also switch
between allied and enemy drones, aircraft or ground vehicles.

(e) Weapon view

What  better  way  to  approach a target than alongside your weapon?  Again
zoom  and  track  adjust is available.  Just prior to impact, air to ground
weapons will switch to a plan view to help assess accuracy of delivery.

(f) Spectator view

Spectator  view  isn`t  strictly a separate view mode - it`s an extra twist
you  can  apply  to any other view mode to achieve cinematic effects.  When
you  select  Spectator view, the viewpoint is "frozen" in space wherever it
happens  to be at that moment (unless it`s already a Spectator view), while
the action carries on.

For  example, you could call up the Tracking view.  Move it around ahead of
the  aircraft  and  zoom  it  out, then select Spectator view and watch the
aircraft  approach  and flash past the stationary viewpoint.  If you select
Spectator  view again as the aircraft passes, the view point will be frozen
at  the  aircraft position again, but this time watching it recede into the
distance.

You  can use the track adjust controls to rotate a Spectator view, and once
you  have  set up the camera angle to your liking, return to the cockpit to
fly  the  aircraft back into shot.  Selecting "restore Spectator view" will
put you back at your chosen spot to watch the effect.

If we tried to describe all the tricks you can play with Spectator view, it
would rate a substantial chapter on its own.  You`ll have to experiment for
yourself and use your own imagination.

WEAPONS CONVERSION
------------------

When a pilot under training has reached the stage where flying the aircraft
to  its  safe  limits  does  not  demand 100% attention, it`s time to start
learning  how  to  fight.   The  RAF  call  this  phase of training Weapons
Conversion.  There are two very different subjects to cover:  ground attack
and  air  combat.   In this chapter we`ll also be looking at how to use the
Tornado`s  radar  in  both  its air and ground modes, and the Radar Warning
Receiver.   In  the  process we`ll be considering a variety of tactical and
operational problems.

AIR-TO-GROUND

The  Tornado  IDS  was  built  to deliver the largest practical load of the
cheapest,  simplest weapons as accurately as possible regardless of weather
and  visibility.  You may well be surprised at how accurately simple "dumb"
bombs  can  be  placed  by  a  smart bombsight.  In addition, three special
grounds  attack  weapons  are  available, two of which are smart.  You will
need  to  understand the nature of each weapon, when and why to use it, and
how to deliver it.  First we`ll look at the list of air to-ground weapons

The Weapons

1000 lb.  General Purpose Bomb (GPB)

A  plain  and  simple  unguided  bomb,  effective against a wide variety of
targets.   Quite  effective  against a hardened target provided you can hit
it,  and the blast and fragments will affect softer targets (most vehicles,
aircraft  etc)  over a fair radius.  GP bombs are the cheapest of all major
ground-attack  munitions, so large stocks are available.  They also allow a
wide  variety  of  delivery  methods,  so  a  good  deal  of flexibility is
available  in trading off accuracy against risk.  Usually delivered four at
a time.

1000 lb.  Retarded Bomb (RET)

These  are  1000  lb.   GP  bombs  fitted  with an alternative tail section
incorporating  a  braking  parachute.   This means that they can be dropped
safely  from much lower altitudes than Gp bombs, since the aircraft is much
further  ahead  of  the  bomb  by  the time it hits the ground (see diagram
10.1).  Minimum dropping height for Retarded Bombs is 100 feet (just enough
time  for  the  fuse to arm), as against 1000 feet for unretarded GP bombs.
Because  the  retarder  hit  is  a cheap and simple fitting for a cheap and
simple bomb, they are usually in good supply.

1000 lb.  Laser Guided Bombs (LGB)

The  original  "smart"  bomb.  This is actually another special kit fitting
for a standard bomb carcase, providing a nose assembly containing the laser
seeker  and  control  surfaces,  and  a  tail with flip-out cruciform wings
giving  it the ability to glide further than a standard bomb.  LGB are used
in  conjunction  with the launching aircraft`s TIALD system.  The navigator
slews  and  zooms  his  camera  view  to place the aiming crosshairs on the
precise point he wants to hit, which is illuminated by the laser designator
in  the TIALD system.  The seeker in the nose of the LGB "sees" the spot of
reflected  laser  light and tilts the bomb`s nose control surfaces to steer
towards  it.   Phenomenal accuracy is possible - missing the target spot by
as much as five feet would be a very poor performance.

This  degree  of accuracy makes laser-guided bombs the ideal weapon against
hardened  installations  or  major  bridges, which must be hit with extreme
precision  to cause more than superficial damage.  The downside is that the
designating  aircraft must fly quite slowly at medium-to-high altitude in a
fairly  straight  line  for  twenty  to thirty seconds in order to keep its
designator  on  the target till the bomb hits, and if there is cloud in the
way  the  laser  couldnt  illuminate  the target even if the TIALD operator
could  see  it.   Laser  guidance kits are not cheap, and therefore not all
that  plentiful,  but  on  the other hand, few weapons are as efficient and
cost-effective; use it properly and every bomb scores a direct hit.

BL755 Cluster Bomb

Looks  like a plain bomb, though less well streamlined is actually a casing
for  many  smaller  bombs  (submunitions).  After dropping, the case splits
open  at  a  preset  height  (set  at  150  feet in Tornado) and ejects the
submunitions in a dense cloud.  If properly delivered, a salvo of four will
devastate  all  but  the  hardest targets in a "footprint" perhaps 100 feet
across  by  300  feet long.  This is the weapon of choice against groups of
vehicles  or  parked  aircraft.   Its  main  drawback  is  that  it must be
delivered from about 200 feet for maximum effect (see diagram 10.2)

JP,233 Dispensers

This  is  the  mother  and father of all runway-attack systems, the Tornado
version  comprising  two  giant  pods weighing a total of nearly five tons!
The pods contain two types of submunition:  60 large (56 lb.) SG.357 runway
penetrators  and 430 small HB.876 "area-denial" mines" both types parachute
retarded.   As  the  aircraft  overflies  the  runway, the submunitions are
continuously  ejected  in  a stream.  When the runway-penetrators reach the
surface,  a  shaped  charge punches a small hole right through the concrete
and a second charge is then fired into the hole, exploding beneath to crack
and  "heave"  the  surface  over as wide an area as possible.  This type of
damage  is  far  more difficult and time- consuming to repair than a simple
crater.   Meanwhile the smaller mines land softly, discard their parachutes
and spring upright, deterring and delaying repair through the deadly danger
they present to men and vehicles.

JP.233  will  make a really impressive mess of any runway if used properly.
Its  main  disadvantage  is  the  fact  that the delivering aircraft has to
overfly  the  target  at  low  level holding a straight course for the four
seconds  needed to dispense the whole load - manoeuvering strews the things
all  over  the  place!   It  is also a Heavy, draggy load for the aircraft,
though the pods jettison automatically when empty.

ALARM (Air Launched Anti-Radiation Missile)

ALARM  is  probably  the most capable and sophisticated missile of its type
currently  in service (the US Tacit Rainbow project had even more ambitious
aims,  but  died the death of a thousand budget cuts).  Like any other anti
radiation  missile  ALARM homes on the transmissions of enemy ground radars
(EWR, search, SAM or AAA radars, for example) in order to destroy them, but
it is far more resourceful than most

ALARM  has many different operating modes, some of which are classified but
we  have implemented two which seem most characteristic and useful.  One is
a  simple  Direct mode, allowing ALARM to be used like any other anti radar
missile.   In  the  other  mode (Indirect) ALARM can be launched at distant
suspected  targets  before you reach them or they see you.  When the target
is reached, the missile will zoom-climb to a point high above it, shut down
its  rocket  motor (if it`s still burning) and deploy a parachute.  It then
loiters  nose  down, descending slowly and scanning the ground beneath.  If
any  hostile  radar is switched on, ALARM jettisons the parachute and falls
on the target like a guided bomb.

Weapon Packages and the Stores Management Display (SMD)

Weapons  for  ground attack are grouped together in "Package".  One package
contains  all  the  weapons intended for one target, which will be released
together  as  a  salvo.   You  might,  for  example, load a package of four
retarded bombs for a planned attack on airfield installations, and a second
package of two BL 755 to attack targets of opportunity.  The maximum number
of weapons in a single package is four, and all must be of the same type if
they werent the bombsight would lose its accuracy because different weapons
have different ballistic properties.

The  content  and  status  of any weapon Packages loaded can be seen on the
Stores  Management  Display  (SMD),  bottom centre in the rear panel, where
each  of  the  top three lines can describe a single package.  Suppose that
the top line reads:

X GPB1000x4 LFT

This specifies from left to right the target, if any, for which the package
is  intended (X).  The type of weapon (GPBl 000), the number in the package
(x4)  and  the  Delivery  Mode selected (LFT).  The Delivery Mode specifies
whether  you  intend  to use manual or automatic release, a laydown or loft
trajectory a laser guided attack.  Some weapons, like JP.233, have only one
delivery  mode  available.   Others,  like GP bombs, offer several options.
When  you  start  your  attack  run and flip the "arm air to ground weapon"
switch.   the  HUD  will  display  different  aiming  cues according to the
delivery  mode selected.  We will explore the various delivery mode options
later, in detail.

Packages are created at the Mission Planning stage, either when you plan an
attack  on  a specific target, or when you use the Payload window to create
packages  to use against Targets of Opportunity.  If you planned attacks on
two  targets (X and Y) in one mission, and then loaded one more package for
opportunity  targets.  When you looked at the SMD the first line would show
the  package  for  target X.  The second line the package for target Y, and
the  third line the Target of Opportunity package, with a dash ("-") on the
left rather than a letter.

The  currently  selected  Package  is shown highlighted.  When you turn the
arming  switch on, this is the package that will be used in the attack, and
the  appropriate line on the SMD will flash continuously.  When the package
is released the Arm status cancels itself, the HUD resets to its normal nav
mode  the  package disappears from the SMD and the next package is selected
and highlighted, ready to be armed.

You  may  override  both the assignment of packages and the delivery modes,
attacking any target with any package, using any delivery mode suitable for
the  weapons  in  the package.  Hitting the K key will select and highlight
the  next  package  down  the  list,  or  skip  from the last to the first.
Hitting  the  L key will cycle through the available delivery modes for the
currently  selected package.  You cannot do either of these things when the
arming  switch  is  on - if you want to change package or delivery mode you
must hit "Cancel Arm" first.

The Delivery Modes

This section provides a brief summary description of the various methods of
placing freefall bombs on the target.  After this familiarisation, we`ll go
through a complete hands-on exercise with each weapon and mode in turn.

Manual (SMD shows MAN)

This  is  a  simple  "point  and shoot" system intended for snap attacks on
targets  of  opportunity.   The  HUD  provides  a bombsight, but aiming and
release are entirely manual.

GP  bombs,  retarded bombs, BL755 and laser guided bombs (unguided) can all
use manual delivery.

Laydown (SMD shows LAY)

Targets for this delivery mode must be entered into the navigation systems,
either at the mission planning stage or "on the fly" using the Ground radar
or  the  Scrollable  Map display.  The HUD shows the bombsight and a marker
over  the  target,  and  the attack run can be flown manually or under AFDS
control.   The  exact  moment of weapon release is automatically calculated
but  the  weapons cannot be released unless one of the crew is holding down
the Commit button.

Strictly  speaking,  a  laydown delivery means releasing the bombs with the
aircraft  flying  straight and level, but the bombsight systems will handle
dive attacks or shallow lofts perfectly well in this mode.

GP  bombs, retarded bombs, BL.755 and laser-guided bombs (unguided) can all
be delivered in Laydown mode

Loft (SMD shows LFT)

Targets  for loft attacks must be known to the nav systems.  As for Laydown
mode.  This type of attack is sometimes also called "toss-bombing", because
the  bombs  are thrown rather than dropped.  The aircraft starts its attack
run  a  good  way  out from the target, and while it is still miles away it
pulls sharply up into a climb.  The bombs are released in the climb and the
aircraft is free to go while the bombs fly on for several miles, rising and
then  falling  onto  the  target  in a trajectory like that of a long-range
artillery  shell.   The  bombsight cues on the HUD are quite different from
the  Manual  or  Laydown  sights,  and the attack profile can only be flown
manually  -  unfortunately the AFDS can`t fly the pull up for you.  Release
is automatic, but only permitted if the Commit button is held down.

BL  755  cluster  bombs  are  too  aerodynamically  "unclean"  to be lofted
accurately  and  lofting  retarded  bombs would make about as much sense as
trying  to  pole  vault  with  a  ball  and chain round your ankle, so Loft
delivery is only available for GP bombs and (unguided) laser guided bombs.

Laser-Guided (SMD shows LGB)

An  LGB  attack  is  run  entirely by the navigator, who must use the TIALD
system  to  aim  the  laser designator at the precise spot he wants to hit.
The  laser guided bombs are normally released in level flight at over 20000
feet,  in  order  to  allow  the TIALD system the widest possible view, and
after  release  they  aim  themselves  at the laser illuminated spot on the
target.   The  aircraft  is  normally  flown  by  the AFDS for this type of
attack,  but  target  designation  and the release of the bombs can only be
performed manually.

Unsurprisingly, this delivery mode can only be used for laser-guided bombs.
