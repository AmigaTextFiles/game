Welcome to Digita Print Manager.
--------------------------------

Digita Print Manager works with Digita software to fully maximize the
quality and performance of your printer

Digita Print Manager supports the following types of printer:

9-pin dot matrix (for example, Citizen Swift 9).

24/ 48-pin dot matrix (for example, Citizen Swift 240C).

HP Deskjet 500 / 510 (or compatible), black and white.

HP Deskjet 500C/550C/1200 (or compatible), colour

HP Laserjet II/III/IV (or compatible),

Canon BJ 5/ 10/20/200/230 bubblejet.

How Digita Print Manager Works
------------------------------

Workbench (the software which controls your Ainiga), is supplied with a
selection of printer drivers.  Printer drivers are software which, when
printing, communicate information from your Amiga to the printer (for more
information, refer to "Amiga Workbench Users Guide", supplled with your
Amiga).

Digita Print Manager works by adding an enhanced printer driver to Amiga
Workbench, along side your existing printer drivers (these are located in
the Devs:Printers drawer). Refer to "Printer Preferences Editor", in the
"Amiga Workbench Users Guide"

Digita software, like Wordworth, will automatically use these enhanced
printer drivers whenever you print, improving the performance of your
printer.  If you use any other third party software, you will need to
revert to the standard Amiga Workbench printer drivers.

Compatability
-------------

Digita Print Manager has been especially designed to work with Wordworth.
It will also work with Money Matters, Digita's personal finance software,
and new Digita software being released in 1994.

However, Digita Print Manager will not work with any other Amiga software,
including Deluxe Paint and early Digita titles such as Day By-Day and
Mailshot Plus.

Therefore, carefully follow the installation instructions in this book
which will install Digita Print Manager printer drivers for the exclusive
use of Wordworth

Preparing to Use Digita Print Manager
-------------------------------------

Before starting, install Wordworth.

Refer to the following sections in your Wordworth Instruction Book:

"Conventions Used in This Book".

"What You Should Already know".

You have been provided with one disk, Digita Print Manager

Step 1

Make a backup copy of your master disk.

It's important to work with a copy of your master disk rather than the
original.  If a copy is damaged or lost, you can go back to the original
and make another copy.

Before copying, slide up the small tab in the upper left corner on the back
of the disk so that it is in the uppermost position (the tab will no longer
be visible from the front side of the disk). This locks information on the
disk, preventing accidental deletion of files and documents

Step 2

Now copy the disk as follows:

Switch on your Amiga and insert the Amiga disk titled Workbench. Open a
Shell by double-clicking its icon in the System drawer. Then type:

Sys:System/diskcopy from df0: to df0: and press the Return key

Step 3

Now place the original master disk in the internal disk drive and when
prompted. press the Return key. Follow the on-screen instructions

If you make backups from the Workbench screen instead of the Shell, be sure
to rename the backup disks removing copy of and make sure there are no
hidden spaces contained in the disk title

Installing Digita Print Manager
-------------------------------

Step 1

Floppy Disk Users:  Switch on your Amiga, and insert the disk titled
Wordworth.

Hard Disk Users: Switch on your Amiga and wait for Workbench to start as
normal

Important If you get the message to insert a disk which is already in a
drive, then the disk is incorrectly titled and needs renaming.

Step 2

When the Workbench screen appears, insert the disk titled Digita Print
Manager.  Double-click the disk icon and then double-click the InstalDPM
icon.

Step 3

When the "Installation options" screen appears, click the Proceed button,
and click Proceed again when the Welcome screen appears. This will start
the installation process.

Step 4

When prompted, select your printer model from the list and click Proceed.
Depending  on your selection, you will be asked for more specific
information about your printer (if you are asked about the emulation mode
of your printer, this information will be contained in your printer manual)

A  message  will  appear confirming that the installation has been
successfully completed

One of the following printer drivers will have been placed into your
Wordworth:devs/printers  drawer  (Hard  Disk  Users:  Amiga Workbench
devs/printers drawer):

PRINTER TYPE              DRIVER NAME       PREFERENCE EDITOR

Canon BI 5/ I0/20/200/230 Digita-CanonBI5-230     Digita-CanonPrefBJ5-23'J

Using Wordworth With Print Manager
----------------------------------

Start Wordworth and choose "Print setup" from the Project Printer menu.

Select  the  Digita  print  driver which you installed previously (it's the
driver prefixed by Digita).

Density:  Auto

Shade:  Set B&W, Grey1 or Colour as appropriate (B&W is the quickest).

Click  OK and choose the Preferences command (Wordworth menu).  Click Save,
and then click Save again to permanently save your new print driver
setting.

From now onwards, whenever you use Wordworth, it will automatically use the
Digita print Manager high performance printer driver (if you wish to revert
to your original Amiga Workbench printer driver, simply repeat this
process, changing your printer driver selection).

Print Setup Command (Project menu)
----------------------------------

Use the tables below to set the Density ("print setup" command) to the
optimum for your printer (the higher the horizontal (X) and vectical (Y)
DPI, the better the quallty):

Modifying Digita Print Manager
------------------------------

For adventurous Amiga users, it is possible to customise the setting: to
tailor the output to a particular printer model.

To modify the Digita print Manager printer driver you previous installed,
you need to edit its preference file, which is located in the Wordworth
Prefs drawer (Hard Disk Users: Amiga Workbench Prefs drawer).

Double-click the Digita Prefs icon to open the preference requester for the
printer driver (in this example, Digita-Pin9Pref)

Each preference requester will vary slightly depending on the type of
printer driver you installed. Most settings are explained in Section 5.1,
"Digita-Pin9Driver"

Now refer to Section 5.1, "Digita-Pin9Driver" for general details

Then, proceed to one of the following sections, which will be specific to
your printer driver:

SECTION           PRINTER DRIVER .
5.1               Digita-Pin9Driver
5.2               Digita-PinDriver
5.3               Digita-DeskDriver
5.4               Digita-DeskDriver4C
5.5               Digita-LaserDriver
5.6               Digita-CanonBJ5-230

To modify this printer driver, double click the icon Digita-Pin9Pref
(located in your Wordworth Prefs drawer, hard disk users - Amiga workbench
prefs drawer) and then click on the copywrite message window.

Silent Mode
If your printer has a silent, or quite mode, you can use this option.
Printing is quiet, but slower.

Fast Graphics
With some printers, dramatically improves the speed of the graphics output
by making the printer skip over white areas. This results in a sharp
reduction in the amount of data that is transferred to the printer.

Colour Mode
Switch between Colour and Supergrey printing.  Normal Amiga Workbench
printer drivers are limited to 16 shades of grey (after brightening the
graphics output, even fewer shades are available). Digita Print Manager
can print colour pictures using up to 256 shades of grey.

With Supergrey enabled, every colour picture will be printed as a greyscale
picture.  Remember to select Colour instead of Grey as the Shade in
Wordworth ("Print setup" command, Project menu). To print more than 16
shades of grey you will need to define a custom dither matrix that enables
you to print more than 16 shades

Supergrey can be disabled in several ways. Take care that none of the
following special cases are in effect if you want to print pictures using
Supergrey:

"Custom dither". and "Colour adjustments" options are by passed if you use
a Density below 3, or if you do not use Workbench Dither method Ordered (to
print halftone dithers with Supergrey, use the Digita Print Manager dither
routines)
 
These are the parameters that must be enabled for printing with
Supergrey: , FUNCTION DENSITY WORKBENCH DITHER Supergrey >2 Ordered Colour
adjustment >2 Ordered Ink compensation >2 Ordered Dither routines >2
Ordered


Note:  The number of printable shades of greys in Supergrey depends on the
number of shades supported by the dither method you set.

Job End
If the printer device gets closed after printing, you can tell the driver
to signal the end of the print job. There are three kinds of signal: Beep
on the printer, DisplayBeep on the Amiga, or both.

arXon Port
Digita Print Manager supports the arXon parallel switch-box, an external 1
to 3 Centronics switch controllable by software. You can ask Digita Print
Manager to automatically switch to the required port for printing. This
enables you to use a scanner, a digitiser and a printer from your Amiga
parallel port, without having to switch between the devices manually. If
you specify Disabled as the port, no switching will take place.

The Environment variable Sbox-printer must be specified before using the
driver in order to enable the switch box feature of the driver.

For information about arXon, write to arXon GmbH, Assenheimer Str 17,
D-60489 Frankfurt, Germany.

Customise Tabulators
Digita software fully supports tabs and so this option should be ignored.

Page Size And Margins
Digita software fully supports page size and margin control and so this
option should be ignored.

Separ. (separation) 
Prints  each primary colour separately (C=cyan, M=magenta, Y=yellow,
K=black).  This option is useful if your printer only has one ink
cartridge.  By printing each of the 4 primary colours in turn, a complete
colour picture can be created.

Mirror
Prints a mirror image of the page, ideal for T-shirt art.

TimeOut
Most Amiga users are familiar with the "printer trouble." requester

This requester most often appears when you print a document that is several
pages long. It is caused by the Amiga not transferring waiting data to the
printer for a period of time (usually 30 seconds). This is called a
timeout error

A timeout may also appear without a real error happening, for example, if
your printer is waiting for a new sheet of paper. This option lets you
override the setting from 1 to 999 seconds.
 
However, if a real time out error occurs you will have to wait the
specified time until the timeout error requestor appears (to cancel the
print job).
 
Text Color 
Digita software fully supports text colour and so this option should be
ignored

Typeface
Digita software fully supports typeface and so this option should be
ignored

Customize Dither 
Most printers print pictures using "binary codes" (put simply, print a dot
or do not print a dot). There is no way to control the brightness of a
single dot. A monochrome printer can only print one colour black. Colour
printers can print three or four primacy colours-cyan, magenta, yellow and
black

A special technique is needed to print more shades, this is called
dithering.  Dither routines print dots of a primacy colour in various
patterns, creating the impression of different shades. The pattern is
described by a dither matrix. For example, as there is no orange ribbon in
the printer, the computer will mix red dots with yellow dots to give the
impression of orange, the patterns of dots for each colour is called a
dither

There are almost no limits to the size of the dither matrix. Amiga
Workbench dither matrices (Ordered and Halftone) are 4 x 4, which is equal
to printing 4 x 4, which creates 16 shades. A dither matrix consists of
threshold values.  Each matrix value is compared with the picture's pixel
value. If the value of the pixel is higher than the matrix value, a dot is
printed.

Many printers have problems with inks running or overlapping dots. These
problems have a huge influence on the decision as to which dither matrix to
use.  There is also a strong relationship between a dither matrix and the
colour adjustment required.  A change of print density often requires a
change of the dither matrix and / or "Colour adjustment".

A selection of dither matrices are included with Digita Print Manager, and
by experimentation you will discover which produces the best results for
your current printing requirements.

You can edit and even create your own dither matrices. However, the
theoretical aspects of dither matrices and digital halftones are complex
and way beyond the scope of this instruction book. For more detailed
information, refer to Digital Halftoning by Robert Ulichney (MIT Press,
ISBN 0-262-21009-6).

Colour Adjustments.
This requester lets you make colour adjustments and compensate for ink
impurities.  This is why colour adjustments and ink compensation are
necessary:

To correct graphics printing which is often too dark, or contains too much
red.

The output quality of printers depends largely on the ink/ ribbon and type
of paper (inkjet printers are particularly sensitive to paper type). The
colour adjustment lets you optimize the settings for your ink/ribbon and
paper type

You can perform image processing by controlling the contrast, gamma
correction and brightness of each primary print colour. You can even
filter out unwanted colours

Printer inks are not completely pure materials (for example, magenta ink
contains yellow).  You can type your own ink compensation values for
magenta and yellow to correct for these impurities, and so for example,
allowing blues to be printed as blues, rather than purples.

Before Digita Print Manager can process a picture for printing, it is
separated into its primary printing colours. You can adjust each primary
printing colour using the 16 sliders.

Colour adjustment is useful because the colours displayed on a monitor are
different when you print.  For example, a bright red on the monitor is
usually printed as dark red, blue is often printed as violet, and
generally, the printer output is often too dark.

Most printers cannot print two adjacent dots (colours) without overlapping
slightly. This problem is known as "dot gain", and causes a muddy and dark
output.  You can avoid dot gain by printing in a lower resolution (for
instance 180 DPI on a 360 DPI printer), or by using a special dither matrix
and colour adjustment which is not affected by dot gain.

You can control the colour adjustment sliders in several ways The three
sliders in the top right corner of the requester (Gamma, Brightness,
Contrast) provide global control over all 16 sliders

Color:  Colour pictures are printed by most printers using three or four
primary colours.  Usually these colours are cyan, magenta, yellow and
black.  All 16 colour adjustment sliders are applied to one primary colour
which is selected using the Color cycle gadget. For grey scale gamma
correction, set Color to "B/W-Grey"

Level: Displays measurement of sliders from 0 to 255

Push & Pop: Click Push to memorize the current settings for the 16 sliders
of the selected colour. You can then change colour (using the Color cycle
box), and click Pop to apply the 16 slider settings from the previous
colour to the current colour

Load & Save:  Use these commands to save and reload individual colour
adjustment settings

Gamma: Significantly brightens a colour component without losing detail.

It does this by introducing a curve into the colour map, whereby the colour
map is shifted upwards or downward (made brighter or darker respectively),
but no portion of the colour map gets to the maximum or minimum values.

Figure 5-4 shows an example colour map which has a positive gamma
adjustment.  The gamma adjustment also affects the contrast of the colour
component. In the darker part of the spectrum, contrast is decreased.

Click Set to implement the new settings.

Adjustment sliders:  The 16 colour adjustment sliders in the centre give
you precise control over the colour adjustment function of the driver.
Each slider can be set to one of 256 shades. A higher level means less of
the currently selected primary colour. A lower level means more colour,
causing a darker picture. Dark input values are adjusted by the sliders to
the right.

Brightness:  This is like a television brightness setting, except that it
modifies just one specific colour component. It does this by uniformly
shifting the colour map upwards or downward. All input intensifies of one
primary peting colour will be shifted upwards (made brighter) by the colour
map.

If you brighten all the primary printing colours, the whole picture gets
brighter.  Beware-as you increase the brightness, the darkest intensity
also lightens, and most of the brighter levels share the same intensity
levels, which results in an overall loss of detail

Click Set to implement the new settings.

Contrast:  This is like the television contrast setting, except that, like
the Brightness setting, it modifies just one specific colour component, At
one extreme the colour map becomes flat, which means that all input
intensities map to the same output intensity (no contrast). The other
extreme is a vertical line for a colour map, which produces a primary
colour with exactly two intensities (maximum contrast).

Click Set to implement the new settings.
 
Set:  Implements the adjustments for Gamma, Brightness, and Contrast
sliders.

Comp, M Y (Compensation Magenta and Yellow):  Use to adjust the ink
compensation of the printer driver, Printer inks are not completely pure
materials.  "Comp.  M" defines the percentage of magenta ink in the cyan
ink "Comp, Y" defines the percentage of yellow ink in the magenta ink. You
could, for example, set the ink compensation value "Comp, M" to 31 (%) and
"Comp.  Y" to 40 (%) for better results with impure inks on the Deskjet
printer.

Invert: Inverts all 16 sliders,

Bright gadgets:  Lets you increase or decrease the brightness of all 16
sliders

Default:  Resets all 16 sliders to the default values used by most Amiga
printer drivers (no colour adjustment)

Greyscale Adjustments
Follow the previous section, "Colour Adjustments".  Simply ignore the
reference to colour settings and colour compensation

Save
Click Save to permanently save the settings to disk. The requester will
then close.
 
Use 
Click Use to use the settings for the current session only (until the Amiga
is switched off). The requester will then close.

Cancel
Click Cancel to close the requester without using or saving any of the new
settings.

Digita PinDriver

Refer  to  Section 5.1, "Digita-Pin9Driver", and note the following
additions:

To modify this printer driver, double-click the icon Digita PinPref
(located in your Wordworth prefs drawer,hard disk users- Amiga Workbench
Prefs drawer), and then click on the copyright message window.

Graphics Mode
Set the graphic emulation for printing (described in your printer manual).

Text Mode
Set the text emulation for printing (described in your printer manual).

LineFeed
Some printers produce unsightly horizontal stripes when printing graphics.
Often, the line feed is slightly too much or too little, causing dark or
white horizontal lines.  This is called "banding" With LineFeed you can
even compensate for the mechanical inaccurary of the printer. Set LineFeed
to -1 if you are experiencing white lines when printing, or +1 if you are
experiencing dark lines.

Optimize
Dramatically improves the printing speed of graphics by making the printer
skip over white areas (reducing in the amount of data transferred to the
printer)
 
The slider lets you set the amount of data reduction to suit your
printer. Printers can be classified in three categories:

Improved speed and quality, include Nec, Epson and the latest Star
printers.

Reduced speed and quality, include Panasonic, Seikosha, Oki and Citizen
printers.

Non-compatible printers, include Fujitsu and Some old Star and Panasonic
printers.

To find the best Optimize setting for your printer:
---------------------------------------------------

Step 1
 
From Wordworth, choose "Place picture" command (Utilities menu), and place
the file Optimize.iff located on the Digita Print Manager disk).

Step 2

Double-click the Digita-PinPrefs icon (Prefs drawer, Wordworth disk, hard
disk users:  Amiga Workbench Prefs drawer), and, using the slider, set
Optimize to 100%.

Step 3

Print the docunment and study the printer head closely while printing the
graphic. Three things may happen:

Vertical lines are left justified. Your printer is not compatible. Set
Optimize to 0%.

Printer head movement slows on each vertical line, which may appear offset
(or uneven). Set Optimize to 50%.

No side effects, Set Optimize to 100%.

Considerable experimentation may be necessary to find the best Optimize
value, but you will be rewarded by increased printing speed, possibly two
or three times faster.

Digita DeskDriver

Refer  to Section 5.1, "Digita Pin9Driver", and note the following
additions:

To modify this printer driver, double-click the icon Digita DeskPref
(located in your Wordworth Prefs drawer, hard disk users-Amiga Workbench
Prefs drawer), and then click on the copyright message window

Depletion
Modern Deskjets (DJ500C and DJ550C) use an intelligent algorithm to
selectively remove dots from the printed image. 25% Depletion will remove
about one quarter of the dots from the image, 50% will remove about one
half.  Using depletion may improve the print quality where there is severe
colour bleed. The hue of the colours will be changed slightly.

Set Depletion to 0% if printing a greyscale picture, otherwise you will not
be able to print real black areas.

With the Deskjet 500C and 550C, Depletion may be used with greyscale and
colour graphics. The setting will be ignored by Deskjet 500 (and earlier)
printers.

Shingle
Shingling, or check boarding, is a process of printing in an interlaced
manner on a Deskjet 500C or 550C. You can remove possible stripes from a
picture, though colour pictures tend to be dark and muddy. If this is the
case, a different dither method and/or colour adjustment may help.

even compensate for the mechanical inaccuracy of the printer. Set LineFeed
to -1 if you are experiencing white tines when printing, or +1 if you are
experiencing dark lines
