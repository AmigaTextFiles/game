WEAPONS TRAINING IN THE SIMULATOR

The  Simulator  provides  the  ideal environment for practicing any kind of
attack.   You  can  start in mid-air, not far from the target, and there is
even  an  "infinite weapons" option which instantly replenishes any package
used.   Select  the Simulator from the Flight options, and look through the
options  on  the Mission Selection Screen until you find the mission titles
with  the  letters  TWCU - for Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit.  Select the
first  of  these,  titled  "IDS - TWCU Freefall Bombs".  Make sure that the
Simulator  Options  switch for infinite Weapons is ON.  Now Commit, and you
will  move  straight  to  the aircraft in flight.  Engage the AFDS in Track
mode  -  you  will find yourself Terrain-Following at a ride height of 1000
feet.

Switch to the back seat and you will see from the Track display on the left
Tab  that  the  aircraft  is approaching the Initial Point for an attack on
target X.  On the SMD you will see that the first package is selected; four
GP bombs for Laydown delivery There are two other packages loaded, one with
two retarded bombs, and one with two BL.755 cluster bombs.  For the moment,
we`re going to attack target X as planned, with the four GP bombs.

Laydown Attack (LAY on SMD)

Laydown  bombing is "traditional" bombing, where the aircraft flies more or
less straight and level over the target to release its bombs.  Lining up on
the  target is the responsibility of the pilot (or the AFDS in Track mode),
but  the  exact  moment  of bomb release is controlled automatically by the
bombsight.  The automatic release will not occur, however, unless the pilot
or navigator permits it by holding down the Commit button.  Laydown bombing
is  potentially very accurate at low level, since most pilots find it quite
easy  to  line  the  aircraft  up  on the target, whereas judging the exact
moment of release by eye is difficult to do consistently.

Wait until the aircraft passes the Initial Point and starts turning towards
X.   The first thing to do is hit the "arm air-to ground" switch, which you
can  do  from  either  seat.   From  the back seat, you`ll see the selected
package  on  the SMD start flashing.  In the front seat you`ll see the Late
Arm Switch cover raised, and the HUD mode will change to show the Bomb Fall
Line, the CCIP (Continuously Computed Impact Point), and the Target Marker,
which may well be partly hidden behind the Bomb Fall Line (see diagram 10,4
to find out which is which).

For  the  moment  the  autopilot has control, but to do this manually, your
first step would be to line up the Bomb Fall Line so that it passes through
the Target Marker.  The upper end of the Bomb Fall Line provides you with a
Safety  Height Cue.  So that the aircraft isn`t damaged by flying debris as
the  bomb  goes  off,  You  can see how this works in diagram 10.5.  If you
can`t  see the Bomb Fall Line at all, you"re far too low - it's disappeared
off  the  bottom edge of the HUD!  The ideal minimum height attack is flown
with  the top of the line right in the centre of the Target Marker, but for
now  you  might  want  to allow the normal training safety margin, with the
Target Marker in the gap below the top of the Bomb Fall Line.

The  CCIP is the other element of the bombsight symbology.  The point where
the  CCIP  line  crosses the Bomb Fall Line is the point where a bomb would
hit if released now.  In Laydown attacks, the release is automatic when the
CCIP reaches the Target Marker, but the symbol serves to show you how close
you are to release.  Shortly before the CCIP reaches the Target Marker, you
must  press  and  hold  the  Commit button to permit the automatic release.
When  release  takes place, the HUD changes back to normal navigation mode,
and the Late Arm Switch flips back down.

If  you  hit  the Weapon View key just after bomb release you`ll be able to
enjoy  a bomb`s eye view of the approaching target, followed by a plan view
at  impact.   It`s a good idea to ensure that the aircraft is in a sensible
autopilot mode before you go sightseeing.

Having  flown  the  attack  under  automatic  pilot in order to see what it
should look like, try it again manually.  You can quit and restart, or turn
the  aircraft  around and come back to X, or you can use the Scrollable Map
to  set  up  a  Target  of  Opportunity waypoint to attack (don`t forget to
select  T).  If you want to make another pass on X, you`ll need to hop into
the  back cockpit and check that waypoint X is still the currently selected
(highlighted)  waypoint.  If it isnt, use the skip to next waypoint, key to
cycle  round  until  it  is.   For each fresh attack you`ll need to hit the
arming  switch  to  arm  the  release  system  and  call  up  the bombsight
symbology.  Because you`ve selected Infinite Weapons, you wont need to make
any  new  selections on the SMD - your GP bombs will be replaced the moment
they`re dropped.

Once  you`re  comfortable  with  the  bombsight,  try  the same attack with
retarded  bombs  and BL.755 cluster bombs.  Just use the K key to highlight
the  right  package,  but  remember that you can`t do this while the arming
switch is ON.

The  main difference you`ll notice is that the Safety Heights for these two
weapons are much lower than for GP bombs.

We  talked  in  Advanced  Flying  Training  about  how  to  set a Target of
Opportunity waypoint using the Scrollable map.  There are two other ways to
set  a  ToO  waypoint, one of which is to use the Ground Radar, which we`ll
look at here.

Designating a Target of Opportunity on the Ground Radar

This can be done from the front or back seat.  Hit the R key to turn on the
radar and show the radar image on the centre MFD.  This is not a pure radar
image but a synthetic composite.  The landscape and fixed objects known, to
the  digital  map  system  are  always shown in dim green shades.  When the
radar  detects an object which is not in the map database it displays it as
a  bright  green  dot.   This  is  especially  useful  for finding vehicles
(including SAM and AAA defences) and trains.  Note that the radar can`t see
through  hills.   In  the dead ground, behind a crest the display will show
you only stored map data.

The  mouse  is used to control a designator cross which can be moved around
the  display  check  that  the MFD`s green Mouse Active light is on, and if
not,  use  the  Tab key to turn it on.  Just as with the Local Map display,
the  radar  display can be zoomed in or out by clicking left or right mouse
buttons with the Ctrl key held down, and targets are designated by clicking
left or cancelled by clicking right.

Remember  that  using the ground radar may draw the attention of the enemy,
if he hasn`t already seen you.  If you select another MFD display while the
radar  is on, there is a warning light on the panel to remind you that your
radar  is  still transmitting.  Always turn the radar off if you don`t need
it.

Manual Delivery (MAN on SMD)

This  is  a  simple  "point-and-shoot"  system intended for snap attacks on
targets  of opportunity when there is no time to designate or the target is
moving.   The  HUD  displays  the Bomb Fall Line and the CCIP (Continuously
Computed  Impact  Point) across it, showing where the bombsight thinks your
bombs  would  go  if  released  at this moment.  No Target Marker is shown,
because  you  haven`t told the navigation systems where the target is.  You
just  fly  the  aircraft  to  place  your  visually  selected target at the
intersection of the two lines, and then press the Commit button to drop the
bombs.  The important difference between the symbology used here and in the
Laydown mode is in the way you interpret the Safety Height cue.  In Laydown
mode  you  compare  the  top of the Bomb Fall Line with the position of the
Target Marker, but in Manual mode there is no target marker, so you compare
the  top  of  the Bomb Fall Line with the position of the CCIP (see diagram
10.6).   At  low  level you can achieve quite reasonable accuracy in Manual
mode, but it`s not exactty precision bombing.

To  change  the  delivery  mode;  go  to the back cockpit and highlight the
package  you  want to use using the K key, then hit the L key repeatedly to
cycle  throught  the delivery mode options for that package until you reach
MAN.   As  with  any weapon delivery mode, you must Arm before you can drop
the package.

Loft Delivery (LFT on SMD)

A  Loft  attack  (you  might  have  heard  this  called toss bombing.) also
requires  that  the  target  position  should  be  known  to the navigation
systems.  A Loft attack comes in two phases; in the first you run in at low
level  and  fairly  high speed starting a good distance (say 10 miles) from
the  target; you line up the Bomb Fall Line with the Target Marker and wait
for  a  'countdown  clock'  on  the  HUD  to count down to zero.  When that
happens,  the  second  phase starts as the HUD changes to display a "rubber
triangle"  steering  cue  and  another countdown clock.  You pull up into a
climb,  trying  to  place  the  cross at the apex of the triangle (the Apex
Marker)  in  the  centre  of the aircraft datum ring.  As you do, the clock
winds down.  When it reaches zero the bombs are released (provided that the
Commit button is down) and you are free to get the aircraft out of the way.
The  bombs fly on, rising to the top of a long arc and then curving down on
or near the target.

In  a  typical Loft attack, an aircraft running in at 550 knots at 200 feet
would start its pull-up about five or six miles from the target and release
its  bombs  just  below  1000 feet, climbing at an angle of just over 20o -
still four or five miles from the target.  The bombs would take about 20-25
seconds  to  reach the target, climbing to 8-9000 feet before they start to
descend.

In  a  Loft attack, the bombs travel a very long way from the release point
with  no  form  of  guidance, so absolute accuracy can`t be guaranteed.  In
practice,  however,  you`ll  be  amazed  at  how much accuracy is possible.
Nonetheless,  Loft  bombing  is not recommended for precision attacks.  The
great  advantage  of  this  form  of  attack  is that the aircraft need not
overfly the target, and may never even come within range of its defences.

Restart  the Simulator "Freefall Bombs" mission, engage AFDS Track mode and
switch  to the back cockpit.  The first package, (four GP bombs) is already
selected  and  the  delivery  mode is shown as LAY.  Hit the L key to cycle
around the delivery options until the display shows LFT.  When the aircraft
turns  to run in on target waypoint X, hit the arming switch.  The HUD will
now  show  the Target Marker, a solid Bomb Fall Line, and a Countdown Clock
slowly  unwinding  anti-clockwise  around the Aircraft Datum.  Use the Bomb
Fall  Line  to line up on the Target Marker, or let the AFDS do it in Track
Mode,  and  whether  manually or under AFDS, set your altitude to about 200
feet  and  your airspeed to about 550 knots.  The Clock is counting down to
the  point  where  you  start  pulling up into a climb in order to loft the
bombs.   This  point,  the Pull up Point, is constantly recalculated on the
basis  of  range  to the target, speed (the faster you`reflying the further
you  can  throw the bomb) and altitude (the higher you are, the furthur the
bomb  will  fly).   The Pull-up Point is determined by the maximum range at
which  your lofted bombs could reach the target if released at your current
height  and  speed  in  a  45° climb.  This is the climb angle at which you
would achieve the theoretical maximum range.

As  the Countdown Clock approaches zero, stand by when the Pull up Point is
reached.   The HUD symbology changes, to show another Countdown Clock and a
"RubberTriangle"  steering cue.  The Clock shows the difference between the
range  to  the  target,  and the distance your bombs would be thrown if you
released  them now.  The steering cue directs you to pull up and steer left
or  right  as  necessary  to stay lined up with the target; the small cross
(the  Apex  Marker)  moves  up  and  down,  left  and right relative to the
Aircraft  Datum,  the  base  line  of  the triangle is fixed and the middle
horizontal  line is drawn halfway between the two, skewing right or left as
the  Apex Marker moves.  The position of the Apex Marker in relation to the
Aircraft  Datum  tells you which way to steer - when you`re pointed exactly
the  right  way,  the Apex Marker is in the exact centre of the ring of the
Aircraft Datum.

Assuming  that  you  are still well lined up on the target, the Apex Marker
will  be  directly  above  the centre of the Aircraft Datum, telling you to
pull  straight  up  If you`ve flown this far under AFDS control, now is the
time  to  cancel it.  Pull back firmly on the stick, and hold it back - the
standard practice is to pull up at about 3.5 G.  As the aircraft pitches up
and  starts  climbing  you will see the Countdown Clock run down rapidly as
your bomb throw distance increases, and the Apex Marker will also move down
closer  to  the  ring  centre.   Both  of  these signs tell you that you`re
getting  closer  to  the  release  point.  You may also see the Apex Marker
deflecting  sideways.   If  it  does, bank towards it to line up again, but
dont  overshoot  on the correction.  When the Clock and the Apex Marker are
indicating  that  you`re nearly at release, hold down the Commit button and
let  the stick come forward to the neutral centre position .  At the moment
of  release the HUD reverts to normal nav mode symbology and the Arm status
cancels  as  for  any  other delivery mode.  Diagram 1O.1O shows a complete
sequence of HUD images for a loft attack, from the start of the run through
to just before release.

Accuracy in a Loft Attack

As  with  any  other  form of attack you must line up exactly on the target
before  release,  but  because the bombs travel so far in a loft attack any
directional  error will result in a miss by a correspondingly large margin.
If  you can see any heading error at all you must correct it before release
or your bombs will be wasted.

The  other  great  factor  in  loft  accuracy is the pitch rate just before
release.   Remember  that  the  bombs  will  be  automatically released the
instant  that  the  throw distance is equal to or greater than the range to
the target.  The bombsight computer repeats its calculations for bomb throw
distance  at  very frequent intervals, but each calculation takes time.  If
you   are   pulling   up  steeply,  the  throw  distances  from  successive
calculations  go  up  by leaps and bounds and the throw distance at release
may  overshoot  the target by hundreds of feet.  Diagram 1O.11A illustrates
this problem, by showing how the predicted bomb trajectory and impact point
change  at  half-second intervals through a pull up.  You should be able to
see  that  accuracy  in  these circumstances is a matter of blind luck.  If
instead  you  let  the  stick  come forward as the release point approaches
diagram  1O-11S, the throw distance still increases as the aircraft climbs.
but it increases in much smaller steps.  The resulting release will stand a
far better chance of being accurate in range.

Recovery and Escape after a Loft Attack

The  moment  the  bombs  are released you`re free to turn the aircraft away
from  the  target  and its defences, and you also want to avoid climbing so
high  that  you`re  exposed  as an easy SAM or AAA target.  While the exact
profile of your escape manoeuvre will vary according to what you plan to do
next, a standard procedure for recovery might go like this;

1 Cancel Reheat

This  reduces  your heat signature, and reduces your chance of attracting a
SAM

2 Roll to 135o, pull hard

You need to turn hard and get the nose down at the same time

3 As the nose passes below the horizon; roll to 90o bank

You`ve  stopped  the  climb, and the nose will continue to drop as you turn
away at the maximum possible rate.

4 As the nose passes 5o pitch down; roll to 60o bank

Pointing  the  nose  at  the  ground at high speed and low level is a risky
business you need to ensure that you can pull out of your dive at a moments
notice

Delivering Laser-Guided Bombs (LGB on SMD)

This must be done using the TIALD system.  TIALD stands for Thermal Imaging
And  Laser  Designation.   Rushed from development into service in time for
the  latter  stages  of  the Gulf War, it provides TV and Imaging Infra-red
cameras  plus  a laser designator mounted together in a swivelling eyeball.
In  its original form this is mounted on an external pod providing services
and attachment points to make the system suitable for fitting to almost any
aircraft  (at  the 1992 Farnborough AirShow it was on display attached to a
prototype  Sukhoi  Su  35!) but it is proposed to make the scanning head an
integral installation on the Tornado GR4.

You can only laser designate what the TIALD head under the aircraft can see
and the higher you are, the further you can see.  We suggest an altitude of
about  23OOO feet.  As with Loft attacks, a long run-in is desirable (say 6
miles or more) but we want a moderate-to-low speed (say 250 knots IAS).  An
LGB  attack  is  executed  entirely  from  the  navigator`s  seat, with the
aircraft under AFDS control.

Select  and  commit  to  the  Simulator  Mission "TWCU - LGB Attack".  This
places  you  in flight at 23000 feet, heading toward a Target Waypoint X on
an  airfield  Having  assured  yourself that the aircraft is heading in the
right direction at the right speed under the AFDS, switch to the back seat.
Looking  at  the  Stores  Management Display you will see that you have one
package  of  three  LGB loaded, with the Delivery mode set to LGB.  Use the
"Right  Tab  Function  Select"  key  to cycle through the right Tab display
options  till  you  see a downward looking camera view (infra-red at night,
visible light in daytime) with boxed crosshairs in the centre.  This is the
TIALD  view.   Check that the green light in the corner of the right Tab is
on,  indicating  that  mouse control is active on that display.  If it isnt
hit the TAB key once or twice until it is on.
 
You  will  now find that moving the mouse scrolls the camera image in the
corresponding  direction,  but  there are limits to the field of view.  The
direction  of  the aircraft`s movement is always up the screen, so that the
image  will  rotate  as the aircraft turns.  Push the mouse forward so that
you  are  looking  at  the  forward edge of the camera`s coverage, which is
where  approaching  targets  will first appear, and sweep the field of view
from  side to side.  The TIALD image can be zoomed by holding down the Ctrl
key and moving the mouse forward or back.  When zooming, the image locks on
the  point  at  the  centre of the display, compensating for the aircraft`s
movement,  unless  the  trailing edge of the camera coverage catches up and
pushes it forward.

Zoom  out as far as possible and move the view forward and backward between
the  leading  and trailing edges of the available area, watching the centre
symbol  of  the  display.  You should see that when the view centre is near
the  forward  edge  of  coverage  (ahead  of the aircraft) the centre cross
symbol  is  surrounded by square brackets, which disappear when the view is
centred  nearer  the trailing edge (behind the aircraft).  While the square
brackets  are  shown,  you  could drop a bomb and continue to designate the
current  centre  spot long enough for the bomb to reach the ground.  If the
square  brackets are absent the spot in the centre of the camera view would
be too far behind the aircraft for you to keep it illuminated till the bomb
hit.

Use a wide zoom to search for some recognisable feature in the forward half
of  the  available  camera  coverage  and then click the left mouse button.
This  locks the view and the laser designator on the point at the centre of
the  image,  and  sets  the Target of Opportunity waypoint T at this point.
Now  zoom  in  closer  While  you  are locked on, you may finely adjust the
designator  spot  by  moving  the  mouse  while holding down the left mouse
button.   It is normally best to do this in several stages, starting with a
wide  zoom,  placing  the  point, zooming in closer and adjusting position,
then closer for a further adjustment until you are satisfied that the laser
spot  is  on  the  precise point you wish to hit.  Clicking the right mouse
button  cancels  the  lock,  letting  the camera view roll forward over the
ground at the aircraft`s speed.

Use  the D key to cycle display options on the centre MFD you`re looking at
the  Local  Map display (with the dotted orientation line down the centre).
Hit the 0 (letter "o") key to switch the map origin (the aircraft position)
from  the  centre of the MFD down to the bottom centre, so that you can see
ahead as far as possible.  As the aircraft approaches Target Waypoint X you
will  be able to see it marked on the map, which will help you locate it in
the TIALD image.

When  the target airfield starts to appear at the leading edge of the TIALD
view  start  zooming  in to find a target -for the moment.  Any target will
do.   Dont  bother  to place the lock precisely for the moment, just set it
somewhere  in  the  general  area of the target.  Hit the arming switch and
release  the  package  immediately  with  the Commit button.  This triggers
immediate  release  of  the  first bomb.  The arming status will not cancel
automatically  until  the  package  is empty.  This allows you to release a
second  and a third bomb manually at intervals of several seconds.  In this
way  you  can either make repeated attacks on one difficult target or guide
each  bomb  in  turn  to  a  different target.  An interval of four seconds
between bombs is a good choice for closely spaced targets.

It  will  be  at  least 20 seconds before the first bomb reaches the ground
from  this  altitude,  and  you can use this time to zoom in and refine the
position of the designator spot.  When you`re satisfied with this, zoom out
a  little  to give yourself a more general view.  When the bomb arrives you
will probably be able to see it flash into view before striking the target.
If  you  don`t  change  anything  a  few seconds later the second bomb will
strike the same spot, followed by the third.

Normally  a "slow ripple" of LGB like this would be used to strike multiple
targets  clustered  in  a  group  a HAS (Hardened Aircraft Shelter) complex
would  be  a  classic  example.  It is simply a matter of shifting the spot
quickly  after  each  bomb strikes.  There are limits to how fast the bombs
can  manueuvre,  so the successive targets cannot be too far apart.  If you
wished to strike widely separated targets, you would need a longer interval
between releases.

Delivering JP.233

Apart  from  the risks you run flying straight and level through the middle
of  an  airfield`s  defences,  the  trickiest  aspect of a JP.233 attack is
ensuring  that  your  attack  run is lined up accurately to put the maximum
number  of  craters in the desired section of runway.  This should normally
be  catered  for  at  the  Mission  Planning  stage, but be aware that very
accurate  flying  will  be  required  to  deliver  the  attack precisely as
planned.

Select  the  Simulator Mission "TWCU - JP.233" and start it up.  You should
be approaching the Initial Point of your attack run on Target Waypoint X at
500  knots,  at  200 feet.  When the aircraft starts its turn to line up on
the  target,  hit  the  arming switch.  You will see a solid Bomb Fall Line
with  no  Safety Height cue, the Target Marker and the CCIP.  As usual, the
idea  is  to lay the Bomb fall Line over the Target Marker - with the added
complication  that  you  must  try  to  ensure that your course towards the
Release  Point  matches  the  direction  of  the  runway under attack.  The
problem  is effectively identical to the problem of lining up for a landing
approach,  and  learning  to  cope with either one of these problems should
mean that you can handle both.

As  the  CCIP  approaches  the  Target Marker, hold down the Commit button.
Release  starts  automatically  and  continues  till  all  submunitions are
dispensed.   Starting  from  the  moment of release, the HUD will display a
Countdown  clock  This  counts  down  through the four seconds necessary to
dispense  the  full  load.   Remember  that  any  radical  turn  will spray
submunitions  in  a wide curve You may notice vibration and noise while the
release continues.

When  all  submunitions  are  gone,  the  HUD  reverts  to nav mode and the
dispenser  pods  are  automatically jettisoned - you may notice the bump as
these go.  Now it`s time to get the hell out of here!  If you ever wanted a
good excuse to fly very, very low and fast you have it now.  No-one but the
enemy will complain.

ALARM Attack

Hard  data  on ALARM is scarce and some of what there is looks deliberately
misleading.   The  most  detailed  documentation  we`ve seen describes four
different   operating  modes,  but  claims  that  there  are  others  still
classified.   We  have  provided for two different modes of operation which
seem  to  us  to  be  among  the  most useful of those claimed for the real
missile, and modified some of the figures quoted

ALARMS  are  loaded  and  managed  in packages like all other ground attack
stores, and Direct (DIR) or Indirect (IND) mode operation is selected using
the normal select delivery mode, key.

Launching ALARM - Direct mode (DIR on SMD)

Direct  mode  provides  for  a  defensive snap shot in response to a sudden
threat  in front of you, the missile taking targetting information from the
Radar  Warning  Receiver.   In  this  mode  ALARM  behaves very much like a
conventional  anti  radiation  missile  such  as the AGM-78 Standard ARM or
AGM-88 HARM

In order to launch an ALARM in this mode you must first select a package of
ALARMs.  Set the delivery mode to DIR, then hit "arm air-to-ground weapon".
The  HUD  symbology  will change to show a Boresight Marker in place of the
aircraft  datum, and the ground radar emitter most directly in front of the
nose  (within  an  angle  of  plus  or  minus  45o)  will  automatically be
designated  as the target.  The standard Ground Target Marker will be shown
on the HUD, and a Range Clock centred on the Boresight Marker will indicate
the  range  to  this  target.   Maximum reading of the Range Clock is 40000
metres (130000 feet or 21.5n.m.).  If there is more than one hostile ground
radar  showing  on  the Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), swinging the aircraft
nose  left  or right will automatically switch the designation to whichever
is most directly in front.

Once the target is designated, hitting the Fire / Commit button will launch
a  single ALARM from the selected package on a direct trajectory.  Provided
that  the  ALARM  package  is  not  empty,  the  arm status will not cancel
automatically on launch.  If you want to disarm in order to select Indirect
mode,  or  another weapon package, you`ll need to do this manually with the
"Cancel  Arm"  key  combination.   When  the package is empty, however, the
arming  status  will  cancel  automatically and the next package on the SMD
will be selected by default.  If there is no ground radar on the RWR within
45°  on  either side of the nose, no target will be designated and you will
not be permitted to launch in Direct mode.

When launched in Direct Mode an ALARM will normally fly a direct trajectory
to  the target, accelerating to about Mach 2 while the motor burns and then
coasting  and  slowing  down.   If  the range is excessive and the missiles
speed  drops  below  a  given  threshold  before it reaches the target, the
missile  will  go into a zoom-climb to convert all its remaining speed into
altitude,  then  deploy  the  parachute  and  scan for a target beneath, as
described below for Indirect mode operation.

Launching ALARM - Indirect mode (IND on SMD)

In order to launch an ALARM in this mode you must first select a package of
ALARMs,  Set  the delivery mode to IND, then hit "arm air-to-ground weapon"
The target will be the currently-selected waypoint, whether from the stored
flightplan  or  a Target-of-Opportunity.  The HUD symbology is identical to
that  provided  in  ALARM Direct mode, showing a Ground Target Marker and a
Range  Clock  with the same calibration, subject to the same condition that
the target must be within 45° of the nose on one side or the other.

Once  the system is armed and a valid target exists, each press of the Fire
/  Commit  button will immediately launch one ALARM at the target.  The Arm
status  will  not automatically cancel while there are still ALARMs left in
the selected package.

After  launch,  each  missile  will  cruise  toward  the  target  at medium
altitude.  Shortly before the target is reached, the missile will execute a
zoom  climb  to  about  10000 feet and deploy its parachute.  It then hangs
nose-down  over  the  target, scanning for hostile radar emission.  When it
finds  one  (or  more)  active radars, it will select the one most directly
beneath,  cut  away  the  parachute and drop on it as a guided bomb.  If no
target  has appeared by the time the missile has descended to 1000 feet, it
will cut away and drop unguided to the ground

If  the missile is fired at a target beyond effective range, and it detects
that  its speed has dropped below a threshold value, it will zoom-climb and
loiter  wherever  it  happens  to  be  at that point.  If a threat radar is
detected beneath, it will attack it as normal.

SAMs and AAA, Tactics for ALARM

Radar  is  used  by  SAM  (Surface-to-Air Missile) launchers, and AAA (Anti
Aircraft  Artillery) vehicles, both to look for targets and to direct fire,
thus  ALARM can be used against either - provided you can persuade or trick
them into switching on.

In Tornado, we assume that only search radars are left permanently on.  SAM
and  AAA  radars  will be switched on quite late as an aircraft approaches.
By  the  time  they appear on your Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) your almost
within maximum range of a SAM.  While your flightplans will, of course, try
to  avoid  known  threats wherever possible, you will inevitably run across
unexpected,  unmapped  threats  from time to time.  It`s always sensible to
assume  that  any  target worth hitting is also worth defending, whether or
not  there  are any known threats in the area.  Defences around the planned
target are an unavoidable risk.

As always, you`ll have to balance risk and reward in deciding how to handle
the  problem.   If  you use Ground radar, the mobile SAM and AAA units will
show  up on it but so will all other types of ground vehicle.  Ground radar
cant  see  through  hills,  so  you`re  still  subject  to  the  occasional
unpleasant  surprise  as  you pass over the crest.  Using Ground radar will
also  make  you  more  conspicuous and easier to find, but if you know that
you`ve  already  been  detected or that help is available, you may consider
that it`s worth the extra risk

When  an  unexpected threat appears on your RWR you`ve got to make a choice
from  among  the  following  options:  avoid it or face it:  shoot at it or
rely  on  defensive  measures such as ECM, manoeuvre, chaff and flares.  If
you  decide to shoot back, ALARM in Direct mode is by far the safest weapon
to  use.  All other available weapons and modes of attack would require you
to  approach  the  target  closely, flying in a more or less straight line.
We`ll  discuss deflection shooting in detail later on, but take it on trust
that  it`s  far  easier  for  a  gun or a missile to hit an approaching (or
receding) target than one which is flying past a good way off to the side.

If you want to use ALARM in Direct mode to shoot your way out of unexpected
trouble, you`d better have it armed and ready so that all you have to do is
hit  the Fire button.  In the time needed to set up a launch from astanding
start  you`d  probably  have  flown straight past the threat, for better or
worse.  See also the section below on ECM (Electronic Counter Measures).

ALARM`s  Indirect  mode  is  designed  for  use  against known or suspected
defences  which  you  can`t  avoid.  They might be the defences around your
planned  target, or the optimum route to or from your target might take you
over  a  defended  area.   A  planned  attack  using Indirect mode might be
organised  somethlng  like  this:  From a sensible stand off range you fire
several  ALARMs  each  targeted  on  a different point in the suspect area.
We`ve  assumed  that  extreme  range  for a launch at sea level is about 10
nautical  miles  (18.5  km)  and  from high altitude about twice that.  The
missiles  will  reach the target area ahead of you, climb and loiter.  They
will  not  attack until a radar activates in response to an aircraft flying
nearby  -  this  could be an aircraft from either side There`s a catch here
which  you  must understand.  We set the loiter altitude for ALARM at 10000
feet  (a quarter of the published figure).  If ALARM sees a target and cuts
away  from  this  altitude, it`ll take about 23 seconds to reach the ground
with  nothing  but  gravity to accelerate it (ignoring air resistance which
would  only make the problem worse).  In that time your aircraft will cover
about  three  miles  at typical speeds, which by coincidence is roughly the
maximum effective range of the SAM systems you`ll encounter.  In Tornado if
you simply fly straight on towards the target, in all probability you`ll be
hit  by  a  SAM coming the other way shortly before your ALARM lands on the
launcher

What  you`ve  got  to  do  is launch your indirect ALARMs, then provoke the
targets  to  switch  on  and activate the loitering missiles while exposing
yourself to the minimum risk.  You`ve got to enter the threat zone in order
to  trigger  the  defences,  but  having  done so you`re free to turn away.
Against  a  heavily defended target it`s still safer than charging straight
in and trying to pick off the defences with ALARMs in Direct mode.

ECM (Electronic Counter Measures)

ECM  represents  a  last line of defence against SAMs and AAA.  It comes in
many  forms,  but  the  one we`re particularly interested in is intended to
degrade  the  enemy`s  radar performance.  If you turn on the Tornado`s ECM
system,  SAM  and AAA units will find it more difficult to obtain a lock on
you,  and  fighter  radars and missiles may also be affected.  This form of
ECM  tries  to  give  the  enemy  a  false  or  unusable  range  reading by
transmitting  carefully timed and shaped false return signals at the threat
radar.

ECM  can  certainly  help  when the enemy is shooting at you, but it is not
guaranteed  100°o effective.  It also suffers from the same drawback as any
other  active system it can attract the attention of sensors which would`nt
notice   you   otherwise.    While  it  destroys  the  precision  of  range
measurements  the added signal strength can actually make it easier to find
your  bearing.   As  with your radar, if you want to stay unobtrusive don`t
leave  it  on  all  the  time.   A light on the panel reminds you when it`s
active.

The  Tornado  IDS  does  not have a built in ECM system - this is loaded as
apod  on  one  of  the  outer  wing  pylons,  balancing the chaff and flare
dispenser  on  the other side.  On the Mission Planner Payload Window these
are  collectively  described  as  "Defensive  Pods".   The  Tornado ADV has
integral  chaff  and  flare  dispensers and internal ECM equipment, so this
does not need to be loaded separately.

Cannon

The  Tornado  IDS  carries  two and the ADV one integral Mauser BK2 cannon.
The  gun  outfit  of  the IDS is intended for use against ground targets as
well as air to air, and HUD symbology is provided for both uses.

Because  the  cannon  can  be used against ground or air targets we`ll deal
with  both  its  applications here in the same section, and describe how to
use the Air Radar mode which is essential for Air to Air combat.

There are in fact three HUD displays associated with the guns:  one for use
against  a  designated  ground target, one for a designated air target, and
one  (the Standby Sight) which is the default when no target of either type
is  designated  or within view.  To use the cannon in either mode, you must
start  by  hitting  the  Arm  Air-to-Alr key combination (Alt+Enter on most
machines),  and  you  may  then  cycle  through  the weapons available with
Air-to-Air  Weapon  Select.   You`ll know when you've selected Guns because
you`ll  see  GUNS x180 in the bottom left corner of the HUD (on the ADV the
Weapon  status panel will also show GUNS illuminated).  In addition, if you
have  no  target currently designated, the Standby Sight will appear on the
HUD.   This  is  highly  distinctive because unlike all other HUD symbology
it`s coloured red.

Guns - Standby Sight

The  Standby  Sight  is a simple "iron" sight, replacing the aircraft datum
symbol in other words, it makes no attempt to show you where your target is
or  predict  its motion; its only function is to show you where your cannon
shells  will  go.  It can be used against any type of target, but only with
the  aid  of  blind luck or genius will you ever score air-to air hits with
this sight from more than a couple of hundred feet away.

It  has  only the virtues of its defects:  it doesn`t require you to switch
on  the  radar  because  it doesn`t use it, and you don`t have to designate
targets for it because it neither knows nor cares what you`re shooting at.

Guns - Air-to-Ground

This  mode  is intended to help you attack Targets of Opportunity typically
groups of unarmoured or lightly-armoured vehicles, parked aircraft or other
grouped soft targets.  In order to use it you must set a ToO waypoint using
the  Scrollable  Map  or  the  Ground  Radar,  and select it as the current
waypoint  You don`t need to have the radar on, but if it is you must ensure
that  its  in  Ground  mode,  not  Air  mode.   Once  these  conditions are
satisfied,  the HUD will show the Air to Ground Guns symbology whenever the
nose is pointed within a reasonable angle of the target.  If you`re pointed
too far off, the Standby Sight will appear.

The Air-to Ground Guns symbology is quite simple and straight forward.  The
normal Ground Target Marker is superimposed on the target, and the aircraft
datum symbol is replaced by the Boresight Marker, which should obviously be
placed over the Target Marker and kept there in order to hit the target.  A
Range  Clock  is shown centred on the Boresight Marker, giving the range to
the  target.   If the clock is showing a complete circle, the range is 2400
metres  (8000  feet)  or more.  The two marks on the lower rim of the clock
indicate  recommended  maximum (1500m / 4900ft) and minimum (900m / 3000ft)
ranges.

Apart  from  the  obvious problem of hitting the target in the first place,
the  main difficulty involved in using the guns to attack ground targets is
due  to  the fact that you have to dive the aircraft at the ground in order
to  do  it.   The  temptation to hang on a few seconds longer and take it a
little  closer  is a strong one, and must be firmly resisted or you`ll wind
up  destroying the target by crashing the aircraft on it.  Quite apart from
other  considerations  this  is not cost- effective.  Keep the dive shallow
and pull out as soon as the range falls below the minimum recommended mark.
Try it in the Simulator and you`ll soon see why we make a point of this.

Strafing practice

You  can practice this kind of attack on almost any Simulator mission.  The
best  way to find suitable targets is to use the Ground Radar.  If you have
enemy  activity  switched  on  (use  the  switches on the Mission Selection
Screen)  then  some of these targets will shoot back at you watch out.  SAM
launchers and AAA units will show up on the Radar Warning Receiver when you
get within range.

Moving  targets  are  obviously  the most challenging, and for our purposes
these  will  either  be  road  convoys or trains.  They will show up on the
Ground  Radar,  but unfortunately the designation system for ground targets
wont track a moving vehicle.  On the other hand, there's nothing to prevent
you from setting a ToO waypoint to help you pick up the target visually.

Attacking  a  convoy  or  a  train  from  the  side is not recommended.  It
involves  deflection shooting with no artificial aids, which is another way
of  saying  that most of the time you`ll miss.  The best way to attack this
sort  of  long  thin target is with a run along its length.  This minimises
the  deflection problem and groups all the targets together, giving you the
best  probability  of  scoring  some  sort of a hit.  Because trucks run on
roads  and trains on tracks you always have two immediately obvious choices
of  attack  run,  and good visual cues for lining up.  For the ideal attack
you  want to come in from behind rather than in front giving you the lowest
possible relative speed and the longest window of opportunity

Having  said  all  this,  experience  suggests  that  if you spend too long
setting  up  the ideal attack you`ll probably find that your targets turn a
corner  and  trundle  off  in  a  new direction just before you come within
range.

AIR-TO-AIR

Air Radar

Whether  you  are  using  guns or missiles in air combat, you will need the
radar  switched  on  in  Air  mode to designate targets.  If you don`t have
radar  switched  on  you  will  have  no  indication  of  target range, and
therefore  no  sighting information.  You can use the guns with the Standby
Sight.   But  you`ll  have  to  estimate  deflections by eye, and you`ll be
unable to use missiles at all.

Turning on the Radar in Air mode is done by hitting Alt R on most machines.
This  will also automatically select the Air radar display on the MFD.  The
display  is  a  plan view of the volume ahead of the aircraft nose, showing
enemy  and  allied  aircraft within range as two different types of symbol.
Short  range  (2n.m./ 3.8km.) and medium-range (10n.m/18.5km.) displays are
available  in  both  IDS  and  ADV  Tornados,  and  the  ADV  also offers a
long-range setting (30n.m./ 55km.).

There are three different ways of designating an aircraft as a target.  One
is  to  use the mouse to point and click on the display.  The second method
is  to  point the aircraft`s nose in the general direction of the enemy and
hit "boresight designate" (Caps Lo on most machines).  This will select and
designate the nearest aircraft in front of you.  The third method is to hit
"next  air  target"  (probably  Alt+Caps  Lo).   If  there is no air target
currently  designated,  this  will work exactly like "boresight designate".
If  there  is  already  a  designated  target  this will designate the next
available  candidate,  so  you can use it to cycle round all targets on the
radar, designating each in turn.

It`s  important  that  you realise and remember that the radar can only see
targets  within  a  wedge-shaped  volume  in front of the aircraft.  If you
designate  a target which then passes out of the radar`s field of view, you
will  lose  lock  If  and  when  you  re-acquire the target, you`ll need to
designate  again.  Boresight designation is the quickest and easiest method
to use in close air combat - just point your nose somewhere near the target
and hit the key.

The  other  thing to remember is that if you can see the target on your air
radar,  he can certainly see you on his Radar Warning Receiver.  The "radar
on  indicator"  on  the  panel  will  help  to remind you that you`re still
transmitting  even if you replace the radar display on the MFD with another
mode.  If you don`t need it, turn it off.

Air to Air Weapon Management

Air to air weapons are armed with the arm air to air weapons key.  The main
difference  between  air-to-air and air-to-ground weapon management is that
you  can  switch between air-to-air weapons without disarming.  This allows
you  to  choose the optimum weapon for the current range and rapidly change
your  mind  as  the  situation changes.  In addition, all air-to-air weapon
modes  stay  armed  after  firing  (like  ALARM  or LGB), provided that you
haven't  run  out of weapons.  The normal "Cancel Arm" key works exactly as
it does in air to ground modes.

Guns - Air-to-Air

In  order  to  use  this  mode:   a)  you  must hit "arm air-to-air weapon"
(probably  Alt+Enter)  and select the guns using "cycle air-to-air weapons"
b) the Radar must be on and in Air to Air mode, c) you must have designated
an aircraft as your target.

When  you`ve designated your target a column of four numbers will appear in
the  lower  right corner of the HUD In order from top to bottom these show:
target  Range  in  nautical  miles;  target  Altitude in thousands of feet;
target  Speed  in  knots  and  target  Heading  in  degrees.  If you want a
mnemonic, think RASH for Range, Altitude, Speed, Heading.  If the target is
within  the  HUD  field  of  view you`ll see the symbology shown in diagram
10.19.   The  aircraft  datum  is  replaced  by  a  medium sized cross (the
boresight symbol), a large Air Target Marker cross will overlay the target,
with  a  concentric  Range  Clock  attached,  and a small cross, the Aiming
Point, will be there as well.

If  the Range Clock is showing a full circle, this means that the target is
at  least 1000 metres (3000 feet) away.  The two marks on the lower half of
the  Clock  correspond to the maximum and minimum recommended ranges, which
are  600 metres (2000 feet) and 400 metres 1300 feet) respectively.  Beyond
the  maximum  range  you`re  very unlikely to score any hits, and if you`re
closer  than  the  minimum  you run the risk of hitting or ingesting debris
from a damaged enemy.

The  Aiming  Point  is  the  only  part  of this display which really needs
explanation.   In  order  to hit a target moving across your field of view,
you  must  allow  for  the distance the target travels between the time you
fire  and  the  time the shot reaches the target.  You have to aim ahead of
the target ("lead" it) in order to have any chance of hitting it, unless it
is  travelling  directly  towards  or  away  from  you.  This is the art of
deflection  shooting.   Given  that you have to aim a shotgun a metre or so
ahead of a pigeon or ask to hit it from a range of twenty metres you should
see  that when shooting at a 500-knot target from a range of 600 metres the
lead  distance  will  be considerable, even though cannon shells travel far
faster than birdshot.

The history of air combat consistently shows that only a tiny proportion of
pilots are capable of accurate deflection shooting without a lead-computing
sight to help them.  Before such sights were available, most gun kills were
made  at  short  range  from almost directly ahead or astern of the target,
thus  effectively  eliminating  the need to estimate deflection.  Even with
sophisticated  modern  gunsights,  there`s  still a lot to be said for this
method.

When  you  designate  a  target,  your  radar  measures  its range, bearing
elevation  and  radial  velocity  (by Doppler effect).  Each measurement is
integrated  with the previous ones to work out speed and precise direction.
The  gunsight  computes  how long it would take your cannon shells to cover
the  intervening  distance,  calculates  how  much  lead  is  necessary and
projects  the  Aiming  Point ahead of the target.  Aim the Boresight at the
Aiming  Point  not  the Target Marker, in order to maximise your chances of
hitting the target.

The  Aiming  Point  is  useful  for  more  than  just  aiming.   Because it
represents  a  prediction of the target`s position some time in the future,
it  shows you his line of flight long before you`re close enough to see the
aircraft  clearly,  and  immediately signals any major course change.  This
information  can  (and must) be used to help you close the range, line up a
tracking shot and react quickly and effectively to counter manoeuvres.

Air to Air Missiles

Both  IDS  and ADV Tornados can (and usually do) carry the AIM9L Sidewinder
missile  for  short-range  air combat.  The Tornado ADV carries as its main
weapon payload the British Aerospace Sky Flash missile, which is for use at
medium  ranges,  in  BVR  (Beyond  Visual  Range) combat.  In the following
sections  we  will  discuss  both  missiles,  how  to  launch them, and the
problems involved in any missile engagement.

AIM9L (Sidewinder) missile

There  can`t  be many of our potential users out there who haven`t heard of
this  one.   The  original of this missile first went into service in 1956,
but  its been upgraded so many times since that while the name is still the
same  and  its  still  a  heat  seeking air-to-air missile, everything else
except  the  body  diameter  has  changed.  Early versions were appallingly
ineffective  and  erratic  in  real  air  combat situations, but this didn`
prevent  the  Soviet  Union  from manufacturing a direct copy, the K13 (aka
"Atoll").   This  copy  was then copied in turn by the People`s Republic of
China  as  the  PL-2.   Both copies were later upgraded but have since been
replaced in front-line service by weapons of indigenous design.

Heat  seeking missiles as a class have a simple low resolution "eye" in the
nose  which  "sees"  infra-red  radiation  rather  than  the  visible light
perceptible  to you or me.  Every warm object gives off an infra-red glow -
this  is  simple  radiated  heat.  If it`s strong enough you can feel it on
your  skin,  even  though  you  cant see it.  A properly designed infra-red
seeker  head  is much more sensitive than this, so that even a poor one can
see a glowing jet exhaust from miles away while the best modern seekers can
see  the  heat  radiation caused by skin friction on a fast moving aircraft
from a similar distance.

Why  look  in  the  infra  red?   When  the  first self-guided weapons were
developed  in  the  forties and fifties, compact electronic control systems
were  primitive  or  non-existent  -  the  control systems of early weapons
tended  to  use  very  simple analog electronics.  Even today with sensors,
computers and software of a power and sophistication then undreamt of, it`s
still  a major challenge to build a system which is capable of looking at a
picture of an everyday scene and recognising even one object reliably, from
any  angle.  What the pioneers needed was a signature of some sort a signal
that was characteristic of the sort of target they wanted to hit and really
stood  out  from  the  background  so  that a simple system could detect it
reliably  and  tell whether it was coming from above, below, left, right or
straight  ahead.  Heat and infra-red radiation offered a promising solution
to  this  problem, since there are few things hotter than the back end of a
jet engine.

A  simple form of heat seeking missile is easy to imagine.  The seeker head
can  see  very  hot  objects from a reasonable distance, and distinguish up
from  down  and left from right.  It takes the hottest object it can see as
its  target.  If the target is to the left, the control system commands the
missile  to  turn  left,  etc.  If its in the centre then the missile flies
straight  on.  With any luck you would have thought it would come somewhere
near its target, if it`s not out of range.

In practice the problem is not that simple.  You have to try to prevent the
missile  from  locking  onto  the Sun, the sun`s reflection, and many other
potential  distractions, without interfering with its ability to detect and
recognise  the  target signature.  You have to provide it with some kind of
proximity fuse so that it knows when to detonate.

The  Sidewinder  is  designed to be small and light enough to be carried as
defensive  armament  by  an  aircraft  which is already heavily loaded with
other  weapons.  This means that it has to be a fairly short-range missile.
The  only  sort  of  propulsion  which makes sense for a small missile is a
small  solid-fuel  rocket  motor  - the alternatives would be prohibitively
expensive,  heavy  and  bulky.  So the Sidewinder spends just a few seconds
accelerating  to  high  speed, and the rest of its short life coasting to a
halt after the motor burns out.

Launching AIM9L

The  following  conditions are necessary to launch an AIM9L:a) you must hit
the "arm air to air" key combination, b) you must use the "cycle air to air
weapon  key  to select AIM9L, c) you must turn on the radar in Air mode and
designate  your  target, d) the missile seeker head must be able to see and
lock on to the designated target.

When  the  target has been designated but the missile seeker cannot see it,
the  HUD  symbology  is as shown in diagram 10.20.  The weapon name and the
number  available  appear in the lower left corner, target Range, Altitude,
Speed  and  Heading  are  shown  in the lower right corner.  The Air Target
Marker  and  Range  Clock  overlay  the target position.  In this mode, the
maximum reading on the Range Clock is 10000 metres (33000 feet).  An Aiming
Point  is  shown just as in Air-to-Air Guns mode, because it gives a useful
visual  indication of the target`s direction of motion, and a missile tired
at  close range may well not be able to hit the target unless it`s launched
with some degree of lead.

The  other  element  of  the  symbology  is the Lock-on Diamond.  Until the
missile  seeker  head  acquires the target, this will rest at the centre of
the  HUD  surrounding  the Boresight Marker.  When the seeker head picks up
the  target  and  locks on, the Lock-on Diamond shifts to the Target Marker
and  tracks  it as shown in diagram 10.21.  Lock-on is also confirmed by an
audible signal, a steady tone.

Active Sky Flash (ADV only)

Sky  Flash  is  a medium-range air-to-air missile derived from the American
AIM  7 Sparrow.  This missile entered service in its original form in 1956,
with  radar  beam  riding guidance.  This meant that the launching aircraft
kept a radar beam locked on the target, and the missile treated this rather
like  an  ILS  beam, automatically steering to reach the centre of the beam
and  stay  there.   This  system  is  still widely used for ground-launched
(especially  anti tank) missiles but it is far from ideal for an air-to-air
missile.

The  next  major version (in service 1958) adopted Semi Active Radar Homing
(SARH).   This  is  a compromise solution used in many air to air missiles.
By  far  the largest, heaviest and most power-hungry part of a radar system
is the transmitter, since this must develop and control very large energies
in order to provide a strong enough signal to give good range and signal to
noise  characteristics.   Fitting  a  really  good radar transmitter into a
sensibly  sized  missile  is  extremely  difficult  today,  and was totally
impossible  in  1958.  A semi Active missile carries a radar receiver only,
to  pick  up  the  signal  transmitted  by  the  big Radar in the launching
aircraft and reflected by the target.

SARH  is  an  enormous  advance  on  beam  riding,  but it`s still far from
perfect.   The  main  disadvantage  is  that  the  launching  aircraft must
continue  towards the target, with its radar on, for the entire flight time
of  the  missile.   If  the  enemy  fires  a  missile  back the result is a
desperate  game  of  'chicken'.  Whose missile will reach the target first?
Will ALL the enemy missiles lose guidance even if the launching aircraft is
destroyed?   In  general, western short range missiles are heat-seeking and
medium or long-range missiles are radar-guided, but the Soviet Union made a
practice  of  developing both radar and heat seeking versions of almost all
its  air-to-air  missiles,  regardless  of  size  and  range  class.   This
obviously increases the uncertainty factor.

The  AIM-7 Sparrow was in its E version by the time of the Vietnam War when
it  was  first  fired  in  anger.   Its  performance was widely regarded as
unsatifactory,  though  some argued that its low success rate was due to it
being used at shorter ranges than it was really intended for.  Over Vietnam
it  was  usually  necessary  to  close  to visual range to be sure that the
target  wasn`t a friendly aircraft, and if you were within visual range you
were  really  too  close for Sparrow to work as designed.  The new spurt of
development  resulting  from  combat  experience  placed  heavy emphasis on
reducing the minimum range requirement.

Development  of Sparrow in the USA continued into the eighties, when it was
supposed  to  be replaced by the AIM-120 AMRAAM, but ten years later AMRAAM
is  still  not in full-scale service and the supposedly obsolescent Sparrow
is still in widespread use.  Meanwhile in the UK a program began in 1969 to
build  the basic AIM 7E2 missile airframe under licence, but to fit it with
an  alternative  seeker  head and fuse more capable than the contempary USA
standard.   The  program  was  considered  to be highly successful, and the
resulting  missile, christened Sky Flash, was first delivered to the RAF in
1979 and also sold to the Swedish Air Force.

Sky  Flash  as  such  is  still  a  semi-active  missile,  but  most of the
development  work  has  been  done  for  a  fully  active  version, roughly
equivalent  to  AMRAAM British Aerospace have been proposing such a version
for  years,  and  its  probably  only  financial  stringency  and  confused
political  decision  making  which  have prevented its production.  We have
accordingly  equipped  our  Tornado ADV with the proposed Active Sky Flash.
At  launch the fire control system supplies an aiming point and information
on  the  target,  and  the  missile  then  steers  towards that point using
inertial  navigation.  At a preset point it turns on its own radar guidance
system  and  uses  that  to  home on the target without assistance from the
launching  aircraft.   Thus it`s a real "fire- and-forget" missile like the
Sidewinder, and the pilot can manoeuvre as he likes after launch.

Launching Sky Flash

To  launch a Sky Flash missile you must hit "arm air-to-air weapon" and use
"cycle  air-to-air  weapon" to select Sky Flash.  This will be shown in the
lower left corner of the HUD, and on the Weapon Status indicator.  A target
must  also  be designated on the Air Radar, using any preferred method, and
to  take  full  advantage  of  Sky  Flash, the radar should be set for long
range.   The  HUD  symbology  is  almost exactly like that provided for the
AIM9L,  except  that  there  is  no  Lock-on Diamond, and the maximum range
reading on the Range Clock is 40000 metres (130000 feet / 21.5 nm)

Missile Ranges

As  we  mentioned  above, most air-to-air missiles (and all of those you`ll
encounter in Tornado) are powered by solid- fuel rockets which provide only
a  few  seconds of thrust.  Thereafter the missile coasts, slowing down due
to  air  resistance,  manoeuvre drag, and the direct or indirect effects of
gravity.   Any  attempt to give a single straight answer when asked about a
missile`s  range  is  bound to fail.  The first uncertainty arises when you
try  to  decide where to draw the line.  Is the missile`s extreme range the
distance  it  can  travel  before it loses all forward momentum, or are you
going  to recognise that there`s a speed below which it cannot manoeuvre or
keep up with a given target?  Among other factors affecting the range are:

Altitude

Drag  is  less  at high altitudes, so the missile reaches a higher speed at
burn-  out, decelerates more slowly and travels further.  Missile ranges at
low  altitudes  tend  to be disapointing, so the manufacturer will normally
quote  the high altitude figure as the brochure range.  In practice, modern
missiles  may  also  be  launched  from  high-flying aircraft at low-flying
targets or vice versa, which further complicates the issue.

Target Speed and Aspect

If a missile is launched head-on at an oncoming enemy aircraft.  The target
and  the  missile  are  travelling  toward  one another at high speed.  The
maximum  launch  range  is  greater  than  it would be against a stationary
target, by the distance the aircraft travels in the missile`s flight time.

On  the  other  hand,  if  a missile is launched at a retreating target the
opposite  is  true.   Maximum  launch  range  against  a receding target is
considerably  less  than  maximum  range against a stationary one, and it`s
easy  to  see that once the missile`s speed has fallen below the target`s a
hit is impossible.

Missile  theoretical  engagement  ranges are frequently shown by means of a
diagram  like  diagram  10.23,  called  an  engagement  envelope, where the
egg-shaped  boundary  defines  maximum  Range  from  any  (flat)  direction
relative  to  the  target`s  own course.  Such diagrams are helpful in that
they  give  you  an  idea  of relative range from different directions, but
remember that the size of the boundary will change radically with altitude.

The  other large assumption implicit in such a diagram is that the enemy is
flying in a straight line at a constant speed throughout the attack.  If he
knows  or  suspects  that  there`s  a missile coming his way this is highly
unlikely behaviour.  If you assume that the target turns at a constant rate
throughout  the  missile`s  flight  you  end up with a distorted engagement
envelope  something  like  the  shape in diagram 10.24, where the target is
assumed to be turning left.  If you draw the matching envolope for a target
turning right, lay it on top of the first and shade in the area they share,
this  represents the area within which you can launch the missile with some
reasonable  hope  that  it  can actually reach the target.  As you can see,
it`s a LOT smaller than the first envelope we looked at - and this is still
an unrealistic, idealised version of the problem.

Suggested Ranges

How  about  some  hard figures?  For Sky Flash, which is normally quoted as
having  a  "range" of 30 miles or so, an RAF Tornado ADV pilot (interviewed
in  an  unclassified video) has quoted launch ranges of 20 miles from ahead
and  5  miles  from  astern.  We assume that these are probably figures for
fairly high altitude, against a target doing a little less than Mach 1.  At
low altitude, these figures might well be halved or worse.

For  the AIM9L, the maximum engagement ranged by the maximum range at which
the infra red seeker can acquire and lock the target, which we have elected
to  set  at  8  nautical  miles  or  so.   As a rough guide, let`s say that
sensible  maximum launch ranges at high altitude might be 5n.m.  from ahead
or 1.5 from astern, or half of these figures at low altitude.

We  may  be doing the makers an injustice here, but if you use these ranges
as  a guide then at least you can be reasonably sure that the missiles will
reach their targets.  Whether they hit them is another question.

Missile Countermeasures:  Flares, Chaff and Manoeuvres

Flares  have been used to decoy heat seeking missiles for almost as long as
they  have  existed.   As we said when discussing the AIM9L, it`s difficult
enough  to  build  a infra red seeker which is immune to accidental natural
distractions  let  alone deliberate ones.  However, modern IR seekers are a
great  deal  more  discriminating than they used to be.  In some cases they
can  distinguish  between a brightly burning flare and an aircraft, or they
may not be fooled for long.

Chaff  -  radar-reflecting  strips  dispensed  in a cloud - has been in use
against search and gunnery radar for even longer than radar-guided missiles
have  existed.  Even though modern systems increasingly have the processing
power necessary to recognise and ignore returns from chaff clouds, they may
take  time  to  reach  a  decision,  and nothing much can be done about the
actual screening effect of the cloud.

Neither  of  these  countermeasures really gives you immunity from missiles
though  they  can  help  a  lot  if  used properly, and in conjunction with
manoeuvre  The  basic  principle  is  that  you must use the decoy when the
missile  is fairly close, so that the aircraft will be out of the missile`s
field  of  view  by  the  time  the decoy has lost its effectiveness.  If a
missile  is  approaching  from  behind,  for  example,  dumping  decoys and
continuing  in  a  straight  line may do you very little good:  the missile
will  pass  them and you will still be in view.  If, on the other hand, you
drop  chaff and flares as the missile approaches and then turn hard or dive
out of the way, you may well be more successful.

Another  idea  to  bear  in  mind  is  turning towards the attack.  This is
recommended as a standard defensive move against a human fighter pilot, but
it  may  also  have  applications  to  missile evasion at close range.  The
attractive  point  about it in either case is that it speeds up the rate at
which  you  cross  the  enemys field of view - just what you need against a
temporarily-decoyed  missile.   The  ultimate  form of this manoeuvre would
take  you  behind the missile before the decoy lost its usefulness, and the
seeker head will never see you there.

All of this advice is totally useless, however, unless you know or strongly
suspect  that there`s a missile on the way, and don`t forget that the enemy
will also be using all these tricks against you and your missiles.

The Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)

Strictly  speaking,  a  Radar  Warning Receiver "listens" for hostile radar
signals  using  a  system  of antennae distributed all around the aircraft,
identifies  the  type  of  radar  and the threat it presents, and shows the
result  on  a  plan  view  display.   This will tell you, for example, that
there`s  an  enemy  fighter  behind and to your right pointing its radar in
your direction, and there`s a SAM launcher looking at you from the left.

The RWR we`ve provided on the Tornado`s front panel will do these things of
course,  but  it  has  a significant extra capability.  One of the features
proposed  for  the Tornado GR4 is a Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS).
Such  systems  (like the RWR itself) tend to be very highly classified, but
there are several possible ways in which it might work, including detecting
the  sudden  infra-red  flare  of  a  missile  launching  and  the use of a
short-range  omni directional radar with very high resolution to detect the
missiles themselves

Such  a  system  would  aim to warn you of an approaching missile, show you
which  direction it was coming from, and possibly even discriminate between
heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles.  We`ve assumed that all this can be
done,  and  incorporated  the result into the Radar Warning Receive display
which  thus  becomes  something  more  like  a "Threat Display" in American
terminology.

The display itself shows a "clock-face" of bearing markers on the left, and
a  column  of  text "discretes" down the right hand side.  When a threat is
detected,  a symbol with a characteristic shape is placed on the clock face
at  the  appropriate  relative  bearing, and the matching text on the right
will  be  lit up Every time a new threat is detected, there will also be an
audio warning which sounds rather like a telephone ringing.  It`s important
to  realise that the top of the clock face display represents the direction
in  which  your  aircrafts  nose is currently pointing, so that a threat on
your right will be shown at 3 o`clock whichever way you`re heading.

Symbols  for  radars will be shown in green, and on the PC version at least
missile symbols are shown in two different colours; orange for radar guided
missiles  and  red  for  infra-red  (or  visually-guided  SAMS).  Check the
Technical  Supplement  to  see  how  missiles  are  distinguished  on other
machines.

Air to air Tactics

As  a  pilot,  your  attitude  to  air  combat should be entirely different
depending  upon  the  Tornado variant you`re flying.  Air combat is the ADV
pilots  primary  mission, though there will be times when it`s only prudent
to  avoid it, and in an aircraft like the Tornado it`s especially important
to choose your targets tactics carefully.  If an IDS pilot becomes involved
in  air  combat  it  usually  means  a  stark choice between abandoning the
primary  mission  or  losing  the  fight.   The  Tornado  is  NOT the ideal
dogfighting  aeroplane  at  the best of times, and an IDS pilot who becomes
involved  in  air  combat without jettisoning ground attack weapons is at a
huge disadvantage.

We'll look at the ADV pilot`s particular tasks and problems before going on
to look at air combat in general, as it applies to both variants.

Interception

The  really  important  differences  between  ADV and IDS are the ADVs more
powerful air radar and the ability to carry Sky Flash medium-range missiles
The  ADV  is  described  as  an  interceptor rather than an air superiority
fighter  Its  design  role is to loiter on patrol for long periods, waiting
for  enemy  bombers  to approach, sprint to the best position for an attack
and  use  Sky  Flash  to  kill  from as far away as possible, as quickly as
possible,  with  the  minimum  of risk if the bombers are escorted then the
tactical   problem   is  much  more  difficult,  but  if  your  mission  is
interception  it  is  vital  to  remember  that you are there to knock down
bombers.   Defeating  the  escort  comes nowhere in your fist of priorities
unless you can`t get a shot at the bombers any other way.

Escort

This sort of role was not among the highest priorities in the design of the
ADV  but  in  many  ways  it`s  well suited to the task.  Using fighters to
escourt  strike  missions  is  an American rather than an RAF practice, but
let`s  keep  an  open  mind  and  be  prepared  to give it a try.  The full
American   concept  involves  a  "strike  package"  consisting  of  several
different  aircraft  types tasked with suppressing ground defences, jamming
and  air escort as well as the aircraft carrying the ground attack weapons.
It`s  a  huge noisy collection of aircraft which cannot hope to conceal its
existence  or location altogether, so it must be strong enough to fight off
any likely enemy reaction.

The classic RAF concept for employing Tornados is to depend entirely on the
aircraft`s  terrain  following  ability  to postpone or totally avoid radar
detection   until  it`s  too  late  for  the  enemy  to  react  by  sending
interceptors.   The  RAF  has  no  direct  equivalent  of  the USAF`s "Wild
Weasels"  (aircraft exclusively equipped and tasked for defence-suppression
work), but the Tornado IDS is already quite well suited for this, and ALARM
gives  it  a good capability.  The demand or defence suppression is already
less  than  for the "strike package in any case" since the route is planned
to  avoid  known  threats  and  the  formation is a smaller, lower and more
difficult target.

If you do get involved in escorting a strike mission there are many ways to
deploy  an  escort.   One way to use Tornado ADVs to protect a force of IDS
might  be  to  arrange  for  the escort to trail the strike formation a few
miles back at low level, relying on the defence-suppression capabilities of
the  leading  IDS  to  clear a path where necessary.  Though the ADV has no
terrain following capability, and the pilot must work a lot harder in order
to fly low safely, it shares with the IDS all the other features which make
the  aircraft  relatively  easy  and  pleasant  to fly at low level, and it
certainly  has  the  endurance  to  stay  with the formation all the way if
necessary.

The  all Tornado strike package is an intriguing concept.  Don`t dismiss it
just  because the RAF doesn`t do it that way at the moment.  Every airforce
evolves  and  uses  a standard set of operating doctrines in peacetime, but
the  well led ones are prepared to experiment if combat experience suggests
that  there  might  be  better  ways  of  doing things.  Be prepared to try
anything once, and if it works, use it.

Air Superiority

The Air Superiority mission is to drive the enemy`s fighters out of the sky
by  engaging  them directly.  This is the air combat task for which the ADV
is  least  well  suited.   It`s optimised for long endurance and long range
missile  engagements  rather  than  seeking  out  the  enemy`s fighters and
shooting them down.  If possible, you should never use the ADV this way but
instead  rely  on  allied  air  superiority  fighters to attack the enemy`s
fighter forces directly

But all is not lost...

We`ve  laid  stress  on  the  fact  that  a Tornado is not the world`s best
dogfighting  aircraft because you`re in for unpleasant surprises if you try
to  use it like an F- 16.  Having said that, don`t get the idea that you`re
just  a  helpless  flying  target.   A  Tornado  pilot goes into air combat
knowing  very  well  that  if  he tries to rely on brute force and superior
aerodynamics  he`ll  lose the fight against any halfway competent opponent.
In  order  to  win he`s got to work out his tactics advance and know how to
make  the  best  of  his  aircraft`s  qualities.   This  can  be a decisive
advantage  against an opponent who`s grown complacent because he knows he`s
flying  one  of  the  world`s  hottest  fighters, as many mock combats have
shown.

Close Air Combat

There`s  no  rigid set of commandments which will guarantee victory or even
avoid  defeat.   All  we  can  give  you  are  suggestions,  some  of which
contradict  one another, but all of them contain at least a grain of truth.
Some  of  them  are  intended purely for simulator pilots, and would be bad
practice in the real world.

Either fight to win or run away

If  you`re  totally  preoccupied  with  defending yourself, you`ll miss the
opportunity  to  attack.   If  you  miss the opportunity to attack, you can
never  gain  the initiative If you can`t gain the initiative, you can never
win the fight.

Keep your eye on the target

Especially  if  you`re  flying a simulator like this one rather than a real
aircraft Your view is unavoidably restricted, and if you once lose sight of
the enemy it`ll be difficult to find him again.  If possible, hold him in a
position on the screen where he can`t quickly slip out of sight.

If  the  enemy is there but you can`t see him, don`t fly straight and level
while you`re looking.

Don`t give your opponent an easy target.  Manoeuvering will also sweep your
visual  and  radar  fields of view about, giving you a far better chance of
finding your opponent.  Don`t forget to consult your RWR.

If in doubt, do something radical - anything!

This  is  related  to  the previous point.  If whatever you`re doing at the
moment  isn`t  working  and  you  have no better ideas, a sudden unexpected
manoeuvre  will  at  least  change  the  situation,  and  may  gain you the
advantage of surprise Just be ready to seize any opportunity that may occur
be less surprised than the enemy.

A two-dimensional fight is a brute-force fight - you'll lose it!

The  classic  public conception of air combat pictures two aircraft chasing
around  and  around in a flat circle while one aircraft tries to get on the
tail  of  the  other.  This is a bad idea on two grounds.  First, a Tornado
will  eventually  lose  this  sort  of  "winding  match"  against  any  air
superiority  fighter.   Second,  it  shows a desperate lack of imagination.
Use  the  third  dimension,  Luke...   If  you can give the enemy a complex
problem  to  solve,  it`s  surely  better  than  giving  him  a simple one.
Remember  the  variants  we  suggested on the basic looping manoeuvre?  Try
them out.

Use your roll rate

The Tornado has a fairly small wing area compared with most air-superiority
fighters  -  this  is  part of the reason why it can fly fast at low level.
While  this means that the turn performance suffers, it also confers a very
fast roll rate up to 180° per second.  In this respect the Tornado is equal
or  superior to most fighters.  Use the advantage to change your flightpath
quickly.

If you`ve got to fight at close quarters, do it at low level..

At  low  level  you`re  probably  faster  than the enemy and the Tornado is
performing at its best.  At high level, the advantages are all on his side

Think Energy Conservation

Yes,  that`s  right;  energy conservation.  This is the core concept of the
theory  of  air combat currently taught to most fighter pilots.  The energy
we`re  talking  about  is  the kinetic energy of the aircraft - speed times
weight, which can be converted into altitude by pointing the nose up - plus
its  potential  energy;  altitude  which  can  be  converted  into speed by
pointing the nose down.  Drag is constantly draining energy from the system
and  the  thrust  from  your engines is replacing at least some of it.  The
biggest  drain  of  all  is manoeuvre drag, which gets worse the harder you
pull.   You  can  see  speed bleed off in a hard turn - even at full Combat
Power.   Try  to  minimise  this loss if you can by not turning harder than
you`re  forced  to.   If  you  run out of airspeed and altitude at the same
time,  you`re in deep trouble.  If you`re bleeding energy and can`t recover
it,  you  might  do  better to try to break off and run away while you can;
you`re about to run out of options.

Don't overshoot your target from behind

If you do, you`re giving him a very easy shot.

If the enemy is close behind, try to make him overshoot

See the above.

A  slow-moving  aircraft  has  a  smaller turning circle than a fast moving
one..

This  is  one  excellent  reason  why  air  combat  normally takes place at
moderate  speeds  (say  400 - 500 knots).  Simplifying slightly, we can say
that  turning  performance  is  described by two factors.  One is speed, as
described.   The other is RATE of turn; how many degrees the aircraft turns
per  second,  which is mainly governed by how much G is pulled in the turn.
If  you experiment, you`ll find that the Tornado`s maximum 7.5 G just isn`t
available  below  a  speed  somewhere  in  the region of 400 knots.  Flying
faster  than  this doesnt give you any greater G capability, because it`s a
structural  limit of the aircraft.  If you fly faster, all that will happen
is that your turning circle becomes larger.

At  the  minimum  speed  which allows you to pull 7.5 G the aircraft`s turn
rate  is  at its maximum and its turning circle is at its smallest for that
rate.   This  is  called the Corner Speed, and it`s good practice to try to
stay somewhere near this speed for combat manoeuvering.  Unfortunately, the
Tornado`s engines are not powerful enough to make up for the manoeuvre drag
at 7.5 G, so maximum turn performance is only available in a diving turn.

The other side of this particular coin is that a aircraft with a moderate G
limit  flying slowly can sometimes out-turn an aircraft with a high G limit
flying faster.

n.b. slat and flap positions are linked and not separately controllable

Jettison indicators

Three lights to confirm successful jettison of:

Left:     all external stores plus internal fuel to minimum
Centre:   all external stores except AlM9-L
Right:    external fuel tanks

Radar altimeter

Indicates  height  above  ground  level when below 5000 feet barometric Non
linear scale with highest resolution at low altitude.

Indicated Airspeed / Mach number

Analogue  dial  showing  Indicated  Airspeed  up  to  800 knots and digital
readout of Mach number.

Altimeter

Analogue  dial  showing  barometric altitude.  Each revolution of the large
needle   represents  1000  feet.   Each  revolution  of  the  small  needle
represents  10000  feet.  Also incorporates a numeric display for those who
prefer a digital presentation.

E-scope (IDS) or Weapon status (ADV)

(a) E-scope (IDS Tornado)

Shows  projection of terrain ahead of aircraft when flying at low altitudes
distance  of  "look  ahead"  is  automatically  adjusted  to  increase with
aircraft  speed.   The  small  marker  on  the  left  edge  of  the display
represents your aircraft.

(b) Weapon status (ADV Tornado)

The  weapons  status  indicator  shows  which air-to-air weapon is selected
(highlighted)  and  armed  (flashing).   The pilot may select between guns,
AIM9  L  Sidewinder or Sky Flash.  The weapon name will not highlight if it
is not available.

Attitude direction indicator

Otherwise  known  as an artificial horizon, this instrument shows the pitch
and  roll  attitude  of your aircraft relative to the ground.  For example,
pitch  up  and  the  artificial  horizon  will  fall,  roll  right  and the
artificial   horizon  rolls  left.   A  small  "bug."  travels  around  the
circumference  of  this  instrument showing your roll orientation.  This is
particularly  useful  when  your aircraft is pitched so far up or down that
the Horizon is no longer visible.

Horizontal situation indicator (HSI)

This instrument has two functions:

Firstly,  it  indicates  your  aircraft's  heading  by  means  of  a  "bug"
travelling around the circumference of the compass rose.

examples: bug at 12 o`clock heading due North
          bug at 3 o`clock heading due East
          bug at 6 o`clock heading due South
          bug at 9 o`clock heading due West

Secondly,  it  is part of the Instrument Landing System and shows localiser
and  glideslope  deviation  during  an  approach  to  an  allied  airfield.
However, it is strongly recommended that you use the ILS mode of the HUD or
the  ILS  mode  of  the  MFD  in preference to this instrument under normal
circumstances.   The  limitations  in  resolution  on  the  HSI  make  it a
difficult  instrument  to  use but in the event of simultaneous HUD and MFD
failure it is a useful "last resort"

The  vertical  needle is linked to the runway localiser and shows deviation
from  the  runway centreline.  If the needle is to the left of centre, this
indicates  that  the  runway centreline is to the left of your aircraft and
that  you should adjust your heading by turning left a few degrees.  As the
needle returns to centre adjust your heading by turning right until you are
aligned  with the runway Likewise, turn right if the needle is displaced to
the  right.   A  small  vertical  scale  can  be  seen  on  the left of the
instrument  and  this  may be used to follow the correct glideslope down to
the  runway  threshold.   If the marker is above centre this means that you
are  below  the correct glideslope and that you need to reduce your rate of
descent normally achieved by opening the throttle slightly If the marker is
below centre, this means that you are above the correct glideslope and that
you  need  to  increase your rate of descent - normally achieved by closing
the throttle slightly.

Multi Function Display (MFD)

Mounted  centrally  on the instrument panel of both pilot and navigator you
will  see  the  Multi Function Display, a distinguishing feature of the GR4
Tornado  This  unit  offers a variety of functions, selected by the "Centre
MFD Function Select" key

. Autopilot and Flight Director System (AFDS) plus Autothrottle if active
. Local map
. ILS
. Ground radar - if active
. Air radar if active
. Forward looking camera

All of these are described in detail in the Avionics Reference section.  It
is  possible  to  switch  off  the MFD by pressing the MFD On/Off key.  The
buttons surrounding the MFD are not functional.

Mouse active indicator

When  mouse  control  is  appropriate  to more than one current display eg.
with  the  radar on the MFD and the moving map on a TV TAB display, control
may  be  passed  between the displays by use of the "Select active display"
key.  The indicator will illuminate to confirm mouse control is active.

Engine rpm indicators

Individual  analogue  rpm  indicator  for  each  engine  (left  and right).
Normally  shows  63%  at  engine  idle.   Full  scale deflection of 100% at
maximum dry thrust (no reheat) and throughout all reheat settings.

Engine temperature indicators

Individual analogue temperature indicator for each engine (left and right).
Normal reading of 400oC at idle and 700oC at full reheat.  Higher than this
probably means that you are on fire.....

G meter

Shows  g  force  due to aircraft manoeuvres.  For straight and level flight
the  reading  will  be  1  g  with  the  pointer at the 9 o'clock position.
Maximum positive g force of 7 5.  maximum negative g force of 3.

Fuel flow indicator

Very  little  movement  is  evident  on  this  instrument  unless reheat is
selected  This  instrument  is  then  particularly useful for assessing the
extent  of  reheat  in  use.   nb  Fuel flow for any given throttle setting
decreases as your altitude increases .

Fuel quantity indicator

Shows  total  quantity  of  fuel  remaining.   Fuel  in  external  tanks is
represented by the red-bordered sector from 12 to 3 o`clock on the gauge

Standby compass

Shows magnetic compass heading of aircraft.

Radar warning receiver

This display shows when your aircraft is being tracked by enemy radar, both
ground-based (e.g.  SAM or AAA) and airborne (e.g.  fighter aircraft).  The
display  also shows incoming ground-launched or air-launched missiles, both
infra  red  and  radar-guided.   Discretes on the right of the display will
illuminate as follows:

SAM   you are being tracked by a SAM launcher
AAA   you are being tracked by anti-aircraft artillery
EWR   you are being tracked by ground-based early warning radar
AC    you are being tracked by an enemy aircraft
MSL   incoming missile. infra-red or radar-guided, ground or air-launched

HUD symbology

Symbology  on  the  HUD  will  vary  depending upon the mode in use Without
weapons armed, the HUD defaults to NAV mode.

Indicated airspeed or Mach number

Digital readout of Indicated Airspeed (IAS) in knots or Mach number

Time early/late

Three  graduations  and a marker found immediately below the speed readout.
The  marker  will drift left or right of centre to indicate arrival at next
waypoint  up  to  thirty  seconds  late  or early respectively.  If time of
arrival  differs from plan by more than thirty seconds then the marker will
remain  at  full  scale deflection.  This symbology only appears if you are
flying  in  the  general  direction of a timed waypoint.  thus permitting a
meaningful calculation of time of arrival.

Angle of attack (Alpha)

A  vertical  strip  meter  on  the left hand side of the HUD, calibrated by
single  and  double dots, each representing 5° of alpha.  Maximum alpha for
any  wing  sweep  is approximately 21 ° and beyond this, your aircraft will
stall

Altitude

Height  of  own aircraft above sea level (barometric altitude) or height of
own  aircraft  above  ground level (radar altitude), both measured in feet.
Whenever  you  fly  within  5000  ft of the ground, the readout will switch
automatically  from  "barometric"  to "radar" signified by the symbol, "R".
When below 5000 feet the readout will vary as you fly over hills.  "T" will
appear beneath the readout whenever Terrain Following is active.

Altitude clock

Circular  graduations  around  the  digital  altitude readout calibrated in
units  of  100  feet.   One full "revolution" of the marker represents 1000
feet.

Vertical speed

Half-way  up  on the right hand side of the HUD is the VSI - Vertical Speed
Indicator.   This  is  shown  as a vertical bar which rises or falls from a
centre  position  as the aircraft climbs or dives.  Its scale is calibrated
with  dots  at  intervals  of  5  feet per second.  If the rate of climb or
descent  is greater than the scale allows (and it often is), the bar sticks
at  the  end  of  the  scale.  The precise rate of climb or descent is most
useful during landing.

Aircraft datum

The  position of this symbol relative to the HUD pitch ladder indicates the
aircraft`s  attitude  i.e.   nose  up  or  down.   n.b.  Alignment with the
horizon will only correspond to level flight at higher speeds.

Pitch ladder

Bars  showing  aircraft  pitch  and  roll  attitude relative to the ground,
calibrated  every  10°.   The  bars  will  always  remain parallel with the
horizon  with  their  inner  ends  pointing  at the ground.  Bars above the
horizon are solid, bars below the horizon are broken.

Heading strip

Aircraft  compass heading across the bottom of the HUD, calibrated in units
of  10°  (eg  270 is shown as 27), calibrated every 5° with a resolution of
1o.  A heading of 36 corresponds to your aircraft flying due North (360°)

Waypoint bearing

An inverted V on the heading strip showing the required aircraft heading in
order  to  fly  directly  towards  the  selected waypoint.  If the required
heading  is  off  scale,  the  V  will  remain  at  full  deflection on the
appropriate side of the heading strip

The HUD in ILS mode

ILS steering marker

The  steering  marker  is linked to the runway localiser and glidescope ILS
transmitters.   If you are aligned with the runway centreline and following
the required glidescope the steering marker will overlay the aircraft datum
symbol  in  the  centre  of  the  HUD.   If the marker is off centre, steer
towards it.

Rubber triangle

A  steering  cue consisting of an apex point (small +), a short middle line
and  a  long  base line.  The position of the base line is fixed.  The apex
marker  moves  left,  right,  up and down relative to the aircraft datum to
indicate a steering demand to the pilot.  The middle line is drawn half way
between the apex marker and the base line and moves left and right.

Stores Management Display

This  small screen is dedicated to the display of available weapon packages
and  the selection of weapon delivery modes.  All available weapons will be
listed  together  with chaff and flare availability.  Packages and delivery
modes  will  usually  be  allocated  during  mission planning prior to your
flight.  If necessary, prior to arming, use the "Select weapon package" key
to highlight the required weapon during your approach to the target and use
the  "Select  delivery  mode"  key  to  specify your method of attack.  The
highlighted name will flash once you have armed the weapon.

8 Sound effects      off or on
0 Minimise / restore

Options  1 to 6 adjust aspects of "Tornado" that will affect the smoothness
with  which it runs on your computer.  For example, reducing the visibility
will  mean that ground objects cannot be seen until you get closer to them.
Less  ground detail on the screen will give a smoother simulation on slower
computers  Selecting  the  "plain"  options  in  2  to  5 will also improve
performance on a slow computer.

Option 7 allows you to select different primary flight controls:

(i)  keyboard  1  roll  rate and pitch rate proportional to how long key is
depressed Roll and pitch rates reduce to zero when key released

(ii)  keyboard  2  roll rate and pitch rate proportional to how long key is
depressed.  Roll and pitch rates maintained when key released.

(iii)  joystick 1 single joystick option.  Joystick provides pitch and roll
control

(iv)  joystick  2  two joystick option.  Joystick 1 provides pitch and roll
control Joystick 2 provides throttle and rudder control.

Option  0 - Reduces Visibility to 6 miles and selects "plain" for options 2
to  5 with single keystroke.  This option offers instant frame rate boost -
useful in combat.  To restore your previous setting hit 0 again.

AVIONICS REFERENCE

Multi Function Display (MFD)

Mounted  centrally  on the instrument panel of both pilot and navigator you
will  see  the  Multi Function Display, a distinguishing feature of the GR4
Tornado  This  unit  offers a varIety of functions, selected by the "Centre
MFD Function Select" key:

(a) Autopilot and Flight Director System (AFDS) and Autothrottle settings 
    - if active
(b) Local map
(c) ILS
(d) Radar - if active
(e) Forward looking camera

(a) Autopilot Flight Director System (AFDS) and Autothrottle

Depending  upon  the mode selected, the autopilot will take control of your
altitude  (ALT),  your  heading  (HDG)  and your Indicated Air Speed (IAS).
Five autopilot modes are available:

(i)   Track
(ii)  Altitude/Heading Acquire
(iii) Terrain Follow
(iv)  Approach
(v)   Autothrottle

(i) Track (AFDS TRACK (-) ) this mode will command the aircraft to follow a
flight plan defined during your pre flight briefing or to fly to a waypoint
set  at  a  target of opportunity during flight (waypoint T).  The aircraft
will  fly  automatically from each waypoint to the next, adjusting altitude
and speed accordingly.  The letter of the next waypoint (e.g.  B,C, etc) is
shown  in  brackets  at  the top of the display.  If you wish to bypass the
next  waypoint, use "skip to next waypoint" key.  The system may be toggled
between  Terrain  Follow or Altitude Acquire when in track mode by pressing
the  Terrain Follow key.  Altitude acquire (ACQR) or ride height (RIDE) may
be adjusted with the pitch control.  Heading adjustment is not available in
Track  mode (HDG display will read AUTO).  Time To Go (TTG) is displayed as
minutes  :   seconds.   Time  Early  /  Late (TEL) will be displayed if the
waypoint  has  a  predefined time of arrival.  The autothrottle facility is
available in this mode.

(ii)  Altitude  /  Heading  Acquire (AFDS ALT/HDG) this mode enables you to
specify  a required barometric altitude and a required heading by using the
normal  pitch and roll control inputs in conjunction with the AFDS display.
ALT and HDG will show ACQR to confirm autopilot acquire mode.  The aircraft
will  make  the  necessary  manoeuvres  in  order to acquire the conditions
specified  Selection  of this mode without further control input will cause
the  aircraft  to  hold the current altitude and heading.  The autothrottle
facility is available in this mode.

(iii)  Terrain  Follow  (AFDS  TF) this mode instructs the autopilot to fly
your aircraft at a given ride height (RIDE) above the ground, selectable in
seven  stages  from 200 feet up to 1500 feet using the normal pitch control
input.   Roll control sets desired heading as in Altitude / Heading Acquire
mode.   The  system  will do its best to follow the contours of the ground,
thereby  minimising  your  exposure to enemy radar.  Watch for the "B risk"
indicator  when  travelling at high speed on the lowest ride heights.  This
warning  light  illuminates  when  the  system  believes that it may not be
possible  to  maintain the desired safety margin ignore it and you may find
yourself  crashing into a hillside.  Either slow down or increase your ride
height.   If the radar altitude falls below the safety margin the AFDS will
roll  the wings level, execute a hard pull up, disengage itself and trigger
a warning.  The autothrottle facility is available in this mode.

(iv)  Approach  (AFDS  APRCH) links the autopilot to the Instrument Landing
System  for  an  automatic  approach  to an allied airfield Altitude (ALT),
heading  (HDG)  and  airspeed  (IAS) are all under autopilot control (AUTO)
Time  To  Go  (TTG)  is  displayed as minutes:seconds.  An AFDS approach is
manually  selectable  only  if you are within an allied ILS beam and flying
towards the airfield.  At this point the ILS marker will be on your HUD and
the localiser/ glideslope needles will have appeared on your MFD.  It is in
ILS  mode.   The Approach mode is automatically selected when you arrive at
an  approach waypoint in Track mode.  Once active, the autopilot will steer
the  aircraft  onto  the  correct  approach  path  to the runway and adjust
throttle  setting  for correct speed and rate of descent.  n.b.  This is an
"auto-approach" mode - not an "auto landing" mode.  During your "hands off"
approach,  it will be necessary for you to make the appropriate adjustments
to  wing sweep, flaps, gear etc.  While the autopilot does the hard work of
adjusting  speed,  heading and rate of descent You will also need to cancel
the  autopilot  just prior to touchdown, flare, land, apply reverse thrust,
brake etc.....

(v)  Autothrottle - (AFDS THROT) -this facility allows you to set a desired
airspeed  and  may  be used independently or in conjunction with AFDS modes
(i)  to (iii) described above.  Selection is confirmed by IAS changing from
manual (MAN) to acquire (ACQR) and illumination of the "autothrottle engage
indicator".   When  active,  the normal throttle control is used to set the
desired speed on the AFDS display.  The autothrottle system will adjust the
engine  thrust  accordingly  in  an attempt to maintain the demanded speed.
However,  please  note  that this is not possible in all circumstances e.g.
in a steep climb or dive or high "g" turn.

Finally,  if  you disengage the autopilot, pitch and roll control revert to
manual  (MAN)  and  the  MFD  will  confirm AFDS OFF if autothrottle is not
active, or AFDS THROT if autothrottle is active.

(b) Local Map

This  is  a moving map display orientated about your present position.  The
display  shows hills, roads, rivers, airfields (active runway in white) and
waypoints (B,C,D etc).  The map origin may be toggled between the centre of
the  display or at the base of the display.  Your aircraft is always at the
map  origin,  heading along the dotted flightpath.  The scale of the map is
selectable  (i.e zoom in and out) from 0.5nm.  1nm, 2nm, 4nm, 8nm and 16 nm
with a base origin.

(c) Instrument Landing System (ILS)

Select this display during your final approach to see the ILS localiser and
glideslope  indicators.   Additional  information  on  this screen includes
aircraft  leading  (top  left corner), bearing to the runway mid-point (top
right corner), estimated time to touchdown (lower left corner) and distance
to runway mid - point (lower right corner).

(d) Radar

The  radar  has  two  independent  modes  of  operation, each with on / off
control.   If  the  desired radar mode does not appear as you cycle through
the MFD functions, first check that the radar is switched on.

(i)  air  mode  used for detecting, designating and tracking aircraft.  The
air  radar  is  a  plan view display showing target range and bearing only.
Both enemy and allied aircraft are shown, differentiated by symbology.  Use
your mouse to move the designator symbol to coincide with the chosen target
and  designate  with  the  left mouse button.  Designation may be cancelled
with  the right mouse button.  If the designator does not appear to respond
to  the  mouse  check  that  the MFD is the active display for the mouse by
pressing the Tab key.

The  ADV  air  radar  has three selectable ranges:  30 nm (for use with Sky
Flash) 10 nm (for use with AIM9L) and 2 miles (for use with guns).  The IDS
radar  has  only  the 10 nm and 2nm range settings.  It is also possible to
lock  on  to  a  target  visually  through  the  HUD by using the boresight
designate  key.   Please  note  that use of the radar at very low altitudes
will be affected by terrain masking ie.  it cannot see through hills!

(ii)  ground  mode - used primarily for detecting, designating and tracking
military  ground  vehicles.   The  display  is  a  composite image of radar
returns  and  digital map data which are compared to identify and highlight
vehicles.   Due  to  terrain  masking,  vehicle returns may be intermittent
whereas  mapped  features will always be shown.  Use your mouse to move the
designator symbol to coincide with the chosen target position and designate
with  the  left  mouse button.  Designation may be cancelled with the right
mouse  button.   If the designator does not appear to respond to the mouse,
check  that the MFD is the active display for the mouse by pressing the Tab
key.

The  IDS  radar  has  six selectable ranges:  0.5nm, 1nm, 2nm, 4nm, 8nm and
16nm.  The ADV is not fitted with a ground radar.

(e) Forward looking camera

This  display  provides  a  daytime  forward  view for the navigator and an
image- intensified view for both crew at night.

TV TAB displays (navigator's cockpit)

Both  left  and  right  TV  TAB  displays offer a variety of functions on a
mutually  exclusive  basis.  Items such as Forward Looking Camera and local
map  are  also  available  on  the  central  MFD  Functions are selected by
repeatedly pressing the Left (or Right) Tab Function Select key:

(a) Flight Plan Display (PLN)
(b) Thermal Imaging and Laser Designating (TIALD)
(c) Scrollable map
(d) Local map
(e) Forward looking camera

It is also possible to switch off each TV Tab display.

(a) Flight Plan Display (PLN)

Normally displayed on the left hand TV TAB, this option shows your aircraft
position relative to your flight plan.  All pre-planned waypoints are shown
(A,B,C  etc) plus any target of opportunity waypoint (T) set during flight.
The  scale  of the display adjusts automatically in order to keep both your
current  position  (small  circle)  and your pre-planned flight path on the
display  simultaneously  Also  appearing  on  the  Flight  Plan Display are
aircraft  heading  (top  left  corner)  bearing of next waypoint (top right
corner),  estimated  time to next waypoint (lower left corner) and distance
to the next waypoint (lower right corner).  nb The estimated time will only
be  displayed  if  you  are  heading  in  the general direction of the next
waypoint, otherwise calculation would be impossible.

(b) Thermal Imaging and Laser Designating (TIALD)

This  is a steerable plan view camera with laser designator.  It is capable
of  looking  ahead,  behind  and  to the sides of your aircraft.  Its range
increases  with altitude and ideally it would be used at above 20,000 feet.
In  order  to  give  the  widest field of view.  Camera steering and target
designation  is  by  means of the mouse.  As the camera looks ahead of your
aircraft,  the  designator  symbol  changes  to  confirm  this fact.  It is
recommended  that  you designate targets ahead of your aircraft in order to
give  the  laser-guided  bombs  sufficient  time to reach their targets.  A
continuous  zoom  facility allows pin-point accuracy Prior to take-off this
equipment does not function and the TV Tab will display.  a large cross

(c) Scrollable map

This  is  a  slewable map on which the navigator may designate and select a
target  of opportunity waypoint (waypoint T).  Map scale is selectable from
0.75nm  up  to  24nm.  Unlike the Local map where your aircraft is fixed at
the  centre  or  bottom  cemtre the display, on the scrollable map your air
craft  symbol  scrolls  with  the map and may leave the display altogether.
Pressing  the  "locate  aircraft"  key  will centre the map at your current
position if you are within the boundaries of the map.  Pressing the "locate
target"  key  will  centre  the  map  at  the position of waypoint T ie set
Additional navigational data is presented in each corner:

Upper left: aircraft heading
Upper right: bearing to position of cursor
Lower left: estimated time to reach position of cursor
Lower right: distance in n.m. to position of cursor

nb  If  you are flying away from the cursor position, it is not possible to
display an estimated time.

(d) Local map 

This  is  very similar to the Local Map mode of the MFD but with selectable
ranges from 0.75nm, 1.5nm, 3nm, 6nm, 12nm and 24nm with the base origin.

(e) Forward looking camera 

This  display  provides  a  daytime  forward  view for the navigator and an
image-intensified nightime forward view for the navigator.

Full-Screen Moving Map 

A  full  screen  moving  map  display is available with zoom controls.  The
boundaries  of the combat zone are not shown.  The map is always centred at
your  present  point  and orientated so that you are flying directly up the
screen Please note that the simulation continues in real time when this map
is  displayed.   For  safety reasons we recommend that you select autopilot
before switching to the map.
