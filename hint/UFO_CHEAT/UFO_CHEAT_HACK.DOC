    If you have Downloaded this text file..you must be really agravated with
how difficult and slow playing UFO is, although it is a really good game.

This text file will enable you to Edit your UFO save game file in order
to win well actually realy realy help you at playing the game.

Your will be able to use alien weapons even though you did not collect the
technology from them, however you will have to Research the alien weapons
technology. Same for UFO construction. You will have Acess to researching
all availlabe (or most) UFO ships and Alien life forms, including
researching the cyclona bust (or whatever) which will enable you to go to
mars and beat the shit out of the alien base. only an avenger can fly to
mars..and equip your players with fusion ball launchers and the most
destructive weapons availlable for mars..no stun..just kick arse!

Now take a peek at the picture and come back here for explanations.


In order for the Cheat to work..you must FIRST construct all 3 bases
on earth. Try to spread them out wisely!

Once you have done this, ave your Game and use newzap to edit the file.

use the picture file as a refference to edit the save game file.

change all the values that were EXACTLY INDICATED in color, to FF ex:

ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff ffffffff
ffffffff etc...

The colors were just to show the different bases which they affected.


The Value for money must be set to what is indicated in the Picture
, 3B9AC9F8 for 999,999,999 dollars US.


The awesome thing about this hack is that you also get to research and build
all the advances buildings such as psionic lab and fusion ball befences
 etc.. early in the game!!

Also..after changing all the weapon values (top newzap in picture file),
you only need to manifacture one of each item, and your inventory will
indicate yu have 255 or 226 of these items! (Although some items may be in
the reearch window..they might already be availlable ei:Flying suits!)

Best of all..you get a shit load of elyrium !!!!!!!!

One draw back is that I was not able to find out the location for the
UFO power source and UFO Navigation. Once you get these from a mission, I am
not sure if these items will go to 256 (items) or you might have to re-edit
the save game file to update/refresh your FF's.



Weapon storage buildings are not neccessary when using the cheat..although
it might help to build 2 or 3 of them.

One problem is the fact that your bases will have 255 scientsts and 255
technitians (or whtever, can't remember their title). so you will not
be able to purchase soldiers in bases 2 and 3 until you build enough Living
space for all the 255 scientsts and other dudes and the soldiers themselves.
you can try selling Scientisis etc to make space.

A Formidable ship is the Avenger with Fusion ball launcher/Ammo!


NOTICE: When editing, be sure to have the Current sector and ending sector
at the same location, and above all..backup your save game file.

Included is an Example Save game file that has been already Edited.



Disclaimer: Use this hack at your own risk. If you Computer pukes and our
monitor jumps off your desk, it's not my fault.
