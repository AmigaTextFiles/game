answers though! Please do not change this file - mail A. Ferrier if you have any

Points to note:
1. Because of long cut-sequences, instructions may not make sense until
you perform them.
2. Changing to Characters is represented by CAPITAL LETTERS.
3. You may need to do exploring to find rooms - although some directions are
given.
4. Some parts can be done in a different order - it won't matter. Because of
this, if you have already gone part of the way through the game, just ignore
bits you have already done.
5. You can't do anything in the game that will prevent you from winning - so
don't be afraid to experiment.
6. I assume that you know how to use all the controls in the game.
7. Print this file out to follow it through with the game.
