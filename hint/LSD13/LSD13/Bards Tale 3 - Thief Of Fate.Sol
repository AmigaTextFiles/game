TENABROSIA
To teleport to Tenabrosia cast: OLUK
To teleport to Skara Brae cast: ECEA

    In Tenabrosia you will want to go inside of the city gates to Black Scar.
Here you will find a Bard's Hall that will teach your Bard some new songs. You
will also find a Wizard's Guild that will teach you the ever-powerfull
Goderdammerung spell (NUKE). Once you learn those, you may exit the city and
set out to fulfill your quest. Find the Canyon in nowhere, and the shadow lock
will be in it somewhere. After you find it, leave the canyon and find the Tar
Pit. It looks like a hole in the ground. It would be very wise to save your
game before entering this death pit. Once you are in the pit go south down the
wall you enter by. Then turn west and proceed about 10 paces. You want to be
at the very center of the southern wall. Once you are at the center,slowly and
cautiously go north. You will be walking over tar, so you will get stuck many
times, and you might lose a few characters. Don't worry,just cast REST if your
hit points are getting too low. You should find a place where tar is bubbling
up in the middle. Use a wineskin or canteen to collect some of it. Go back the
way you came. Once you exit the dungeon, go to the dense forest (6S,7W) and
find a group of trees that are blocking the entrance to another dungeon. It
looks like a hole between a few trees. Once you are facing the trees, use the
tar that you just gathered. The tree will go up in flames, allowing you to
enter the dungeon within. Once in the dungeon, you must find the shadow door.
    When you have the shadow door and lock, go to the 'middle of nowhere.' Use
the shadow door and lock. A magic door will appear which you will be able to
go through. Once inside, wander around until you find Scedeau. He will be
guarding the prizes you seek.Since he will keep moving you further and further
away, the olny way to kill him is to have your rogue hide in the shadows.
It may take a while to get him/her out to 90',but when you do so, it is a good
idea to cast DIVA to increase the damage inflicted upon Scedeau. If you don't
kill him the first time,just go back out again until you do. Another good idea
is to cast PREC, because while you are hiding in the shadows, Scedeau just
might want to conjur up some friends to mess you up.

TARMITIA
To teleport to Tarmitia cast: AECE
To teleport to Skara Brae cast: KULO

    Tarmitia was meant to be harder than it actually is. All you have to do
is answer a riddle and kill some one. Walk around in Berlin until you find
a floating head. The head will ask 'Who am I?' Respond with:Tyr. Then the head
will ask 'Who am I really?' Respond with:Werra. You will then be teleport to a
new dungeon. There, go the the bottom left corner. Enter Werra's chamber and
kill him. It is a good idea to cast PREC and DIVA. This part looks easier than
it really is. After you kill Werra, he sits up and laughs at you, while six
black slayers try to destroy you. 2 NUKE spells should take care of them, but
watch out, because the Black Slayers critical hit everything they touch! Once
you kill the Black Slayers,you will receive your prizes and will be able to go
back to Skara Brae. To do so, go to the top right corner and walk through the
teleport.

SKARA BRAE
   To complete the level of Skara Brae, one must venture into the Mad God's
Temple, and utter the words 'chaos.' Once inside of the dungeon, teleport
immediatly two levels down using the APAR spell.Once there, find a portal that
goes down. It will be much easier to find using the SOSI spell. When you are
within three or four paces of the portal, the spell will tell you 'Something
special is near.' Once you are in the room with the portal, cast LEVI and hit
'W' to levitate down the portal. Walk around until Brilhasti tells you that
you are close. When he does so, he should be right around the corner. Once you
hear him for the second time, go to the west and stay against the wall, turn
north and precede cautiously.After going north for aproximately ten paces, hit
'?' to see the dungeon map (you may want to do this during other dungeons.) If
you see on the map that you have passed through a door, go east one and south
one. You may want to save the game before you go south. Once you go south, you
will enter his chamber. As soon as possible, cast the PREC spell. This spell
will prevent Brilhasti from conjuring up more foes for you to fight. Try to
kill his guards as soon as possible. After killing all foes except Brilhasti,
advance until at 10'. Once you kill him, you will be teleported back to
the Review Board where the old man will teach your Chronomancer (if you have
one) the spells to get to Arboria. Which is our next dimension to solve.

MALEFIA
To teleport to Malefia cast: EVIL
To teleport to Skare Brae cast: LIVE

    Malefia was absolutely the hardest and most time consuming dungeons of all
Bard's Tale dungeons. We refer to it as the S.O.B. dimension. I will simply
explain the goals,and let you experience the hell we went through solving this
dungeon by ourselves.It's helpful to cast SCSI to find out how lost you really
are. On the main level, you will have to find a statue. Once you do so use the
corresponding item.On the first level down, there are two more statues. On the
second level down, there are three more statues. Once you complete all of the
statue business, go to the bottom right corner of the first level down and
levitate down the portal in a big room. Go north to find THE door. If it's a
'faint door'then you haven't found all of the statues (six of them.) We advise
saving the game numerous times while venturing beyond THE door. You must kill
the first group of foes to enter the sacred chamber. Once in the chamber, you
must fight more foes to cross a bridge. Running from the second group of foes
can do more damage than good.Once you past the second group, you must go after
Tarjan himself. Tarjan isn't exactly in a cheerfull mood when you find him. He
will conjurer up some 'friends' that you must play with (the trainer would be
nice right now, wouldn't it??) After playing with the first group of friends,
guess what? Yep, another group of friends.These friends aren't really friends.
These friends don't like you very much. If you are lucky enough to kill the
second group, Tarjan is all yours.Since he likes to conjur up 10 black slayers
every round,casting PREC might not be a bad idea. Once you have killed the Mad One, you will enter adventurer heaven and will be put to sleep until part IV
comes out. You may now turn it off and go back to Skara Brae, where you will
welcome a group of Hedge Lizards. Beat the %$#% out of them and then you may
want to do one of the following:

 1. If you have to cut the grass tommorow, use some of the gasoline (all if
   necessacary) and play Pyro-Bardia.
 2. If you don't have to cut the grass, you have a couple of nice frisbees to
   throw at your dog.
 3. If you just happen to have some hydrochlroic acid laying around, we hear
   disks react violently to it.
 4. Have you ever studied the anatomy of a diskette?
 5. If you have a trash can in the corner,here comes your chance for 2 points.
 6. Call your lawyer, and sue the hell out of EA for making the false claim
   that a thief is needed to solve the game.
 7. Take a trip down to Panama and celebrate!
 8. Experiment with a diskette's bouyancy. (Preferrably the Pacific)
 9. The next time you see Kool Kat, Wildcat, or Marduk, give him a million
   dollars for spending all of this time writing this file for you after we
   already had it solved!
 10. Break into your local hospital, and steal a bottle of Ether to use until
    Bard's Tale IV comes out.

venture around until you find a dungeon with a bunch of zig-zags. A beautiful
looking shadowy figure should ask you for the 'Flower of Truth.' Give her the

Blue rose. After going through a teleport on the same level she will ask for
the 'Flower of Kinship.' Give her the Red rose. She will later ask for the
'Flower of Nature.' Give her the Yellow rose. Then, right before you enter

peacefully or violently. Answer yes to the question. He then will allow you to
enter his chamber. Go south for about 4 paces. You should find him waiting for
you. There you will be able to convert one of your characters (monk, paladin,
bard, or rogue) into a Geomancer. After doing so, look around the chamber for
his chest. The prizes you seek will be in them.

GELEDIA

the third riddle. Once you find it, cast the following spells: LEVI, ANMA,
PHDO. Enter the passage way, go up, defeat the guardians, go down, leave the

ARBORIA
To enter Arboria cast: ARBO
To return to Skara Brae cast: ENIK

     Once in Arboria, seek the fisherman's hut. Go inside and pay him money to
learn the GILL spell. This spell will allow you to breathe under water. After
learning the spell (which can also be learned in the Wizard's guild inside of
Ciera Brannia) go in the lake right next to the hut. As soon as you are under
water, cast the GILL spell. It only last for a short while, so move quickly.
Head towards the west. After going west for about 20 paces, you should be near
the water of life. To get some,make one of your characters use a wineskin or a
canteen. They will collect some of the water which will play an important role
in the future. Once out of the lake, look around for an oak tree. It is close
to the city gates. When you run into it,it will ask you if you want to pick an
acorn. Type yes and give it to one of your characters.
     Now you must go to the top of Valarian's tower and get the nightspear.
Teleport straight up about two or three levels using the APAR spell. Once you
make it two the top,there is a place where you must plant the acorn. To do so,
make the character use the acorn. He/she will plant it. Then use the Water of
Life. The acorn will grow into a full size tree.Climb the tree and look around
on the top level for the nightspear. Give it to one of your characters. To get
out of Valarian's tower, teleport straight down two or three levels, and find
the stairs going out of the tower.

in front of the city gates. The king will tell you to bring Tsolaths head to
him. Then you will exit the city and find the festering pit. It looks like a
hole in the ground. After you enter it, teleport down with the APAR spell
and find Tsolath. Cast a PREC spell as soon as you find him. The best way to
kill him is to use something quick and powerful, such as the DEST spell. Once
you kill him, he will try to come back to life, but the nightspear will absorb
the light that controls him,killing him for ever. Then you will be able to get
his head and heart. Take them and go back to the King's castle. The King will
take Tsolaths head and let you into his Sacred Grove,which is right outside of
his castle.

You should find a door there. Enter the door and use Tsolaths heart. One of
your characters will put it in a bowl in his chest.Then use the Water of Life,
this will make the heart start pumping and bring Valarian back to life. You
then will have to exit and re-enter his burial chamber to discover a door to
the east. Enter the door and head towards the south-east. There you will find
Valarian's bow and arrows. Give them to your characters and make you way back
out of the grove to the city gates. Find the well worn area where you will
teleport back to Skara Brae. Go to the old man in the Review Board. He should
give you 600000 experience points and tell you of your next quest. Be sure
to have your chronomancer talk to him to learn the new teleporting spells.

End.
