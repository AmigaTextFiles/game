              THANKS TO BLACKHAWK FOR THE INITIAL DOC


                       ACTION REPLAY IV - BETA
                       =======================


Action Replay III updated and changed to work 99% with all games out, and
only for A1200/A4000 with or without FAST MEMORY....

All functions like TRACE,TRAPS, and breakpoints are fully working....


You can train you A1200 games, and rip pictures and music..  Its possible
to Show the AGA pictures but not SAVE AGA PICTURES, with the 'SP' option,
Only Normal chipset pictures can be saved!

Want to rip the latez music on your A1200???
 The newest Replayer included!!

A few other options is included....

1. disassebly of a few 680x0 instructions....like MOVEC
2. A special Rob Northen Decrypter and encrypter for those who
   know how to use it!!! (What a RND is??? ask your local cracker)
3. All memory is possible to view without any special SYSOP MODE!!!!!!
   NO SECRET SYSOP MODE IS INCLUDED SO WHY TRY TO FIND IT????!?!?!!?
4. The entering of the MASTER monitor, can be done in several ways!
   explained later!!

THE REST IS EXPLAINED IN THE INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION IN Action Replay!

FIRST!!!!!

 This is NOT the REAL Action Replay IV, but as Datel haven't released one
 yet!  I think its fair to call it IV, bcoz the next update HAS to be
 more powerful as the 680x0 processor is more complex, and with the AGA
 chipset they need to change several routines!!
 like their TIMING routines!!!  (hmmmmm)


How to enter Action Replay for the first time!!!!!
-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Just  press  your right mouse button and you will go into the ARIV...  If
you want to change the enter mode, write :

   IMODE        (+return)
or 

   IMODE 0

you  can  choose  between  0  to  2 , the rest is undefined...  A level 7
interrupt is also available!  you just go aheah and make the cable for it
and make your interrupt, and ARIV will pop up!

0:  Left+right mousebutton + 'F' key  ']' (on the keypad) disables ARIV
1:  '*' (on the Keypad)      ']' (on the keypad) disables ARIV
2:  Right mousebutton)       ']' (on the keypad) disables ARIV
3:  Level 7 interrupt        ']' (on the keypad) disables ARIV
4:  NOT USED!!!! DO NOT TRY IT!!

If Action replay is disabled you must run the program once again to enable it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Action Replay activates WHEN:

 Any Exception is made!!!!
 So use the 'ALLEXC' command to ignore exception like:
 TRACING, and exceptions like a TRAP command...

 if you disable it, Action Replay will activate only, when you
 want it to (by the mouse press or so).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Action  Replay  is RESET PROOF!  so if you have disabled the program, and
you  make a reset the program will be reactivated at the reset...  Action
Replay will remove itself WHEN:

IF: program checksum fails!
OR: Vectorbase has been changed!
OR: reset vectors for OS has been cleared by a VIRUS DETECTOR!!

BLUE SCREEN AT RESET MEANS CHECKSUM FAILURE (RELOAD ARIV)
RED SCREEN MEANS Allocation failure, but is still installed!!!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action Replay IV has been tested on an A1200 +4MB FAST +Coprocessor
                                    -- A1200 STANDARD

And i think it works fine on an 680x0 computer as well...



***************************************************************************
A little Programmers note:

The Fastmemory version is placed at hex: $5a0000 (Inc. $a000 at $1a8000)
 And allocated
The Chipmemory version is placed at hex: $1a8000
 And allocated

To restart the monitor yourself. Jump to Startlocation
Disable AR IV  by jumping to     ------- Startlocation+4

OTHERS: Just reload program!!!
***************************************************************************

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So there's nothing more to say than: 

 HAVE FUN! and crack/train all the A1200 games coming up!

DISK AND DISK CODING COMMANDS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

BOOTCODE (codenumber)
---------------------
This  is  the  only  way to boot a disk that has been protected using the
BOOTPROT  instruction  as  below.   if you wish to boot a protected disk,
enter the freeze command then type BOOTCODE followed by your code number,
eg.   to  boot  the  disk  that  was encoded in the example below use the
following.

    BOOTCODE 1234

Then  restart  the machine by typing X to exit from action replay, reboot
the machine and the disk will start.  Note that once a boot code has been
entered  it will remain until the machine has either been switched off or
a  new bootcode has been entered.  To show the current bootcode enter the
line.

   BOOTCODE

with  no  number.   to  get  rid  of  the  bootcode use the value 0.  The
bootcode value can also be viewed from the F3 preference screen.


BOOTPROT (codenumber)
---------------------
This  instruction  will  protect  the bootblock of the disk in the active
drive  with  a  unique  8  digit number and make it totally unbootable to
normal  users  who do not possess the code.  To boot a protected disk you
must  use  the  bootcode  instruction.   It  is  not recommended that you
attempt to write a protection number to a disk more than once,

   BOOTPROT 1234                   {typed in}

   SURE TO PROTECT DRIVE IN DF0:   {the reply}

   Y                               {typed in}

will  code your disk with the unique number 1234 which should be recorded
or memorized

CODE (drive) (codenumber)
-------------------------
This is another rather complex encryption tool that to get fully to grips
with  will  take  some  experimentation  before  you fully understand it.
(drive) is the drive number 0-4 and (code number) is a value in the range
0-!65535.   The  easiest  way  to  show you how to use this feature is by
example.

   CODE 0 3

will  have the effect of encoding all disk writes to drive 0 so that they
can  only  be  read  in future by setting the drive code to 3.  All reads
from  this  drive will also be de-coded using this number so normal files
will be read as corrupt data.  For example the following

   CODE 0           {remove encryption from drive 0}

   SA TEST          {save a frozen file to disk}

   CODE 0 3         {en-code disk 0 with the number 3}

   LA TEST          {re-load the frozen file}

will load a corrupt file as a different code has been used to load (3) as
that used to save (none).  The instruction

   CODE

will display all the en-coded drives and an encryption number.  Note that
this  number  will not be the same as that entered, and whether the drive
is  protected  or not eg.  the status after the previous command would be
as follows.

   ACTION REPLAY DISK CODER V1.1
   -----------------------------

   DRIVE0 CODE:00000005 PROTECTED!
   DRIVE1 CODE:00000000 NORMAL
   DRIVE2 CODE:00000000 NORMAL
   DRIVE3 CODE:00000000 NORMAL
   DRIVE4 CODE:00000000 NORMAL

The  code  of  5 will always correspond to the entered number 3!  This is
the same for all codes.  PLEASE use this feature with care, we would hate
you  to  save  your  most precious files and forget the code number!  The
Diskcode values can also be viewed from F3 preference screen.

DCOPY (source drive) (destination drive)
----------------------------------------
diskcopy

This instruction will copy an Amiga DOS disk from the source drive to the
destination  drive.   The  source and the destination may be the same but
the computer will warn you that any program in memory will be destroyed.

Due  to  the  nature  of  Amiga  drives  we  recommend that you use blank
unformatted  disks  to copy onto.  If you do not no damage will occur but
sometimes the copy may fail.  eg.

 DCOPY 0 1

BURST
-----
Activate Burst Nibbler

This  is one of the major new introductions with Action Replay.  It is an
advanced  fast  disk  copier  similar to DCOPY command but more powerful.
You can enter Nibbler section by BURST from the freeze screen.  (there is
no  returning from the nibbler so make sure you have nothing important in
memory.).   The  advantage  of the nibbler is that you can copy a disk to
multiple  outputs and it can also be used for duplicating MSDOS and Atari
disks.

The  features of the nibbler are not too difficult to understand.  On the
left  hand  side  of  the  screen there is a mode box.  This is to toggle
between  Amiga  DOS disks and DEEP which is for other formats.  The start
and end values are the track numbers to be copied, for example if you are
duplicating  public domain disks with only the first 40 tracks used there
is  no  point  copying  the  higher tracks.  The side selector is for the
upper,  lower  or  both  sides  of  the  disk  -  of  most use if you are
duplicating single sided atari disks.  The sync option should only be set
to either the default value for Amiga disks or index for MSDOS.  Only use
other  values  if  you understand disk sync marks.  The 4 images of disks
each  represent  a  drive number (only appropriate if they are present of
course).  Each disk is a color representing what action is to be taken on
that  drive.   Blue  is  not  acted upon, green defines the source drive,
brown  defines a destination drive without verify and purple represents a
destination  drive  with  verify.   the  start  button begins duplication
(assuming  both  start and destination drives are selected).  To exit you
must reboot the Amiga.  Quit will cause a system crash.

CODECOPY (source)(destination)
------------------------------
This  is  used in conjunction with the CODE instruction.  it will de-code
all data from the source drive using the code number then en-code all the
data  going  to the destination drive using its number.  You may use this
feature for encoding or de-encoding entire disks.

SAFEDISK (n/b/s/u/v/q/a)
-----------------------
Trackdisk Functions Noclick (n)
                    Bugfix (b)
                    Read damaged tracks (s)
                    Verify writes (v)
                    Update tracks (u)
                    All above (a)
                    Quit trackdisk (q)

This  command  depends  on the argument supplied.  An arguement of B will
instruct  the  trackdisk  feature  to remove the Amiga DOS bugs which can
cause  files  to  be  damaged  and/  or lost.  The option N will stop the
annoying  clicking  of  drives  that  the Amiga does every few seconds to
check  if there is a disk in the drive.  The S option will, when there is
a  read  error,  attempt  to  load  the track anyway and continue.  The U
option will if there is no access to the disk for a short while reset the
track  buffer  and  switch  off  the  drive motor.  An argument of V will
verify  all  writes  to  the  disk.  An argument of A will switch all the
above options on; Q will switch them all off.

CD (path)
---------
This  instruction  on  its own will display the current directory path or
tree.   If  you  specify  a path in the standard CLI format the directory
will be changed to that specified by (path) eg.

   CD QWERTY/SUBDIR

will  change  the  current directory to sub-directory SUBDIR in directory
QWERTY

   CD/

will return you to the previous directory.

DIR (path)
----------
This instruction will give a list of all the files and sub-directories in
the  current  directory  if  no path is specified.  A path however may be
specified to show the contents of a particular directory eg.

   DIR QWERTY/TWO

will list the contents of subdirectory two in directory qwerty regardless
of the current directory.

DIRA (path)
----------
This  instruction  is  similar to DIR except it will list the contents of
all sub-directories as well

COPY (path)(source)(dest)
-------------------------
Copy a file.

This  will  copy  a  file  from the source to the destination leaving the
original  program  intact.   This  is  essentially  the  same  as the CLI
instruction.

MAKEDIR (path)
-------------
This  instruction  will  create  a subdirectory at the point specified by
(path).   If  no path is specified a new directory will be created in the
current directory.eg.

  MAKEDIR SUB1

will create the sub-directory SUB1 in the current directory

   MAKEDIR MAIN/SECOND/SUB1

will  create  the  sub-directory SUB1 in sub-directory SECOND in the main
directory MAIN

DELETE (path)(filename)
-----------------------
This  is a simple delete instruction.  The file specified will be removed
from the current directory if no path is specified eg.

   DELETE WAYNE

will  remove the file named wayne from the current directory.  If however
the path is specified the current directory is ignored eg.

   DELETE MAIN/SUB/WAYNE

will  remove  wayne  from  the  sub-directory  SUB  which  is in the main
directory MAIN

FORMAT (name)
-------------
This  instruction  will  format  a  disk in the currently active drive to
standard Amiga DOS format, with the disk titled (name).  For example type
the line

   FORMAT DEMO

The computer will respond with the line

   READY TO FORMAT DISK IN DRIVE DF0:

to which you should reply (if you are happy) Y return.  The computer will
then format a disk in drive DF0 and call it DEMO

FORMATQ (name)
--------------
Format a disk quickly

This  will effectively reformat a previously formatted disk and hence all
files will be erased yet tracks will not be reformatted so it does it vey
fast

FORMATV (name)
--------------
Format and verify disk.

This is essentially the same as FORMAT in that it will format the disk in
the  active  drive and title it (name), the difference being that it will
then  step  through the tracks of the disk again verifying that there are
no errors on the disk.

INSTALL (bootblock number)
-------------------------
This  is  used  to  create  an autobooting disk which enters a dos shell.
From this shell you may run programs which are on the current floppy disk
especially  the ALOAD program, which is used to load Action replay freeze
files  independantly  of the cartridge.  There are two forms of bootblock
number  which  correspond  to  the values 0 and 1 The first is a standard
bootblock,  the  second  is an anti virus bootblock which can detect many
forms  of virus before they have the chance to damage your valuable data.
For example to install an anti-virus bootblock on the current disk in the
active drive type the command

   INSTALL 1

DISKCHECK (drive)
-----------------
Check disk in drive.

This  instruction  will  scan  all  the tracks on a disk in the specified
drive for errors; any none Amiga DOS tracks will be reported as errors.

DISKWIPE (drive)
----------------
Wipe disk clean of data.

Destroys  data  on  the drive specified.  The disk will then be of no use
until it is completely reformatted using either FORMAT or FORMATV eg.

   DISKWIPE 0

will destroy all data on the disk in drive DF0

TYPE (path)(filename)
---------------------
This  will  type  the  contents  of  a  file  in ASCII to the screen.  An
executable  file may appear as meaningless characters whereas a file from
a  wordprocessor  may  have  extra characters which are control codes for
text formatting.  The path and filename are as the DELETE instruction.

RENAME (path)(oldname)(newname)
-------------------------------
Will  change  the  name  of the file specified by (path) and (oldname) to
(newname)

RELABEL (name)
--------------
This  command  will change the name of the disk in the current drive to a
new name.


FREEZER AND RIPPER COMMANDS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

SA (path)(name)(crate)
----------------------
Save all.

This  instruction  will  save  a  copy  of  the frozen program to disk in
standard  amiga  format.  (path) is the standard path as mentioned in the
disk  section.  (name) is what you wish to call your program.  (crate) is
the compression rate which is in the range 0-!65535; the higher the value
you  specify  the  shorter  the  final  file will be.  however the actual
compression  will  take  longer  and  longer.   At  the maximum value the
compression  can  take very long.  As a simple rule a value of about !200
should be plenty.

The  following  is an example of workbench 1.3 with 0.5 Meg RAM extension
in place and not switched out.

   SA TEST             {no compression}
   SA TEST1,!50        {compression 50 decimal}
   SA TEST2,!200       {compression 200 decimal}
   SA TEST3,190        {compression 400 decimal}

Will give for example if we do a DIR.

   184210 TEST
   145862 TEST1
   091226 TEST2
   084690 TEST3

Notice how the saving becomes less even even though the rate is doubled.

SR (path)(name)(crate)
----------------------
Save and restart

This  instruction  is identical to SA apart from the fact that as soon as
the file is saved the frozen program will be restarted.

LA (path)(name)
---------------
Load all.

This  instruction  will  reload  a  frozen file from disk and place it in
memory ready to restart.  Essentially the opposite of SA.

LR (path)(name)
---------------
Load and restart.

This  instruction  will  load  a  frozen  file  from  disk and restart it
immediately.

SLOADER
-------
Save loader.

Saves a copy of the loading program to disk called aload.  This is used o
load  a frozen file independently from Action Replay.  Its primary use is
when  a bootblock is installed onto a floppy disk drive using the install
instruction.   From  the DOS shell which is displayed after the installed
disk is booted you should type the follwing line.

   ALOAD (name)

where  name  is  a valid frozen file saved using SA or SR commands.  This
command is also useful for loading frozen files when you are using a hard
drive.   You should transfer both your frozen files and the aload program
to your hard disk and then from CLI type the above command.

LQ
--
Load Quick.

This command is the opposite of save quick, it reloads a frozen file from
the ramdisk ready to restart.

LQR
---
Load quick and restart.

This  command  is  the  opposite of SQR/SQ.  It will load a file that has
previously  been  saved  to  a ramdisk using save quick or save quick and
restart.   After  loading  it  will  start at the point it was originally
frozen.

SQ
--
Save Quick

Will  save  the  current  program in memory to ramdisk if there is enough
free memory to do so.

For information on how to restart see LQ, LQR, EXQ, and EXQR.

SQR
---
Save quick and restart.

Will  save  the program to ramdisk as in SQ, only the frozen program will
be  restarted  immediately after completion.  Ideal for saving a point in
the game in case you die so you can restart from a setpoint quickly.

EXQ
---
Exchange quick.

Effectively  a combination of SQ and LQ this command will swap the frozen
program in the ramdisk with the frozen program in main memory.

EXQR
----
Exchange quick and restart.

The  same  as  EXQ  except  that  the  program  taken from the ramdisk is
restarted automatically.

SQMEM
-----
Save quick in fastmem.

This  command allows you to define that fastmem is used as the quick save
area or to release it if it is already defined, eg.

   SQMEM 200000

would  define  that  fastmem  area 200000 would be used as the save quick
area.  There is a unique command

   SQMEM 0

which tells Action Replay to use the normal area. 

TRACKER
-------
Search for music track.

Will  search  through  frozen  memory for certain music format sequences.
This  will work best on public domain software where the authors are more
likely to have used these packages.  Please do not expect this feature to
work miracles as music has no standard format like screens and samples do
- so many commercial programs use their own.

A counter will be displayed as memory is searched.  Three passes are made
for  different  music  formats.   If  any  music  is recognised a display
similar to the following is shown.

   SONG LOCATED IN MEMORY AT:$011BB2,SONGTYPE=SOUNDTRACKER
   (32 SAMPLES)
   SONGNAME:LOADING............   YOU CAN NOW:
   F1 PLAY MODULE, F2 STOP MODULE, F3 SEE MORE DETAILS, 
   F4 SAVE MODULE
   F5 RENAME SONG, F6 SHOW SONG DATA, F7 CONTINUE SEARCHING
   F8 CHANGE TO ST-16, F9 CALCULATE PATTERN LENGTH F10 EXIT

The  first  number in the display is the address in memory where the tune
is situated.  The songtype is the piece of software that has been used to
write  the track, in this case it was sound tracker with 32 sound samples
available  to  the  track.   The songname is just that, the name that was
given to the piece of track when it was written.

The function keys act as follows

   F1  = PLAY MODULE               {needs no explanation}
   F2  = STOP MODULE               {just that}
   F3  = SEE MORE DETAILS          {gives a more detailed view of the
                                   tune ie. sample names etc}
   F4  = SAVE TUNE                 {simply enter a filename and the tune
                                   will be saved in the current format}
   F5  = RENAME SONG               {this will give the track a new name}
   F6  = SHOW SONGDATA             {useful for showing song data while
                                   playing a track}
   F7  = CONTINUE SEARCHING        {will continue searching for more
                                   tunes from where the tracker left off}
   F8  = CHANGE TO ST-16           {attempts to change the track to 
                                   soundtracker with 16 samples} 
   F9  = CALCULATE PATTERN LENGTH  {re-calculates data}
   F10 = EXIT                      {exits from tracker}

SCAN
----
Scan memory for sample.

Will  display  a  new  menu as below and a graph.  The graph displays the
contents of chipmem as a sound sample.

   F1 =        HEAR SOUND             {plays sample between selectors}
   F2 =        CALCULATE NEW GRAPHICS {redraws the screen to show the
                                       sample between selectors}
   F3 =        RESET                  {resets selectors to full memory
                                       size and redraws graph}
   F4 =        EXPAND RANGE           {expands the size of the sample
                                       on screen and redraws the graph}
   F5 =        SAVE SAMPLE            {saves the sample between selectors
                                       to disk in IFF format}
   SPACE                              {toggles the active selector
                                       between start and end} 
   Left Arrow                         {move the current selector down
                                       in memory}
   Right Arrow                        {move the current selector up
                                       in memory}
   Mouse                              {holding the left or right mouse
                                       button down and moving the
                                       mouse will move the start and
                                       end selectors}
   Up Arrow                           {increase period of sample}
   Down Arrow                         {decrease period of sample}

To  find  an  appropriate sample in memory first play the whole of memory
(F1)  and  notice  whereabouts the + symbol is when it plays your sample.
Then  move the start selector to about this point and the end selector to
roughly  the  end.   Now resize the screen using (F2) and play the sample
again.   You  may keep doing this until you have found the correct limits
for the sample then when you are happy save it (F5)

P (picnr)
---------
Where  (picnr) is the picture number, usualy 1 or left blank.  The screen
will  then  be  displayed and a large range of commnds made available for
the manipulation of these screens which are shown below or shown when the
(F8) key is pressed.  The possible combinations and types of manipulation
could  take  a  book  in themselves, due to the great complexity of Amiga
graphics.   A  bit of practise will soon get you used to what effect they
have even if you are not sure what they are doing.

SP (path)(name)(nr)(height)
--------------------------
Save picture

(path)  and  (name)  are  the  usual  format.   (nr) and (height) are the
picture number and height of the screen.  Say for example we wish to save
the frozen kickstart 1.3 screen to save it as an IFF file we could use.

   SP KICKSTART,1 !232

We  could then reload this file into something like Photon Paint and edit
your own Kickstart screen.

SPM (name)
----------
Save picture mempeeker

Simply saves the screen we have been editing to disk and call it by name.
Any  modifications  we  have  made  to the mempeeker picture will also be
saved  out,  for example changing the colours.  This feature is ideal for
saving out screens from games and using packages such as Photon Paint for
editing and printing.

There  now  follows  a  very  brief  example of how to use the mempeeker.
First  switch  on  your Amiga and when the Kickstart screen appears press
the freezer button and type in the following

   P (enter)             {to enter mempeeker}
   (help)                {for the helpscreen}
   Shift-w               {to make the helpscreen visible}
   LMB                   {to reduce the size of screen}
   9                     {increase green}
   esc                   {exit mempeeker}
   SPM KICKSTART         {new green kickstart, will save a new greener
                          kickstart}

DISKMONITOR COMMANDS
++++++++++++++++++++

RT (strack)(num)(dest)
----------------------
Read tracks from active drive

Will  read  tracks  starting  from track number strack and a total of num
half  tracks  into  the meory address pointed to by dest.  If DEST is not
defined,  Action  Replay  will  attempt  to  assign  an area of meory for
tracks.   If  you  do not assign a memory area for the tracks you can use
the  monitor  commands  to reference the tracks.  See the monitor section
for  more details.  Note the number of tracks are half tracks, ie.  Track
0  side  0 counts as one half track and track 0 side 1 counts as another!
eg.  to read 20 half tracks (10 whole tracks)

   RT 0 !20

WT (strack)(num)(source)
------------------------
Write tracks to active drive.

Will  write  a total of NUM half tracks starting from the point in memory
specified  by  SOURCE  to  the  active  drive starting from track STRACK.
Again T can be used to define a track address eg.

   WT  0 7 TO

DMON 
----
Display disk monitor buffer

Will  display  the  area that has been assigned to store disk tracks with
the  read  track  command  as above.  This area can then be disassembled,
dumped etc.  using the standard monitor instructions.

CLRDMON
-------
Clear disk monitor buffer

Will  clear and de-allocate the area of memory that has been defined as a
buffer  for  disk track reading and writing.  When examining a disk using
the  RT command you should use this command before loading another set of
tracks to avoid any confusion between the two lots of data

BOOTCHK (sectoraddr)
--------------------
Check boot block checksum

This  command is used on a sector that has been read into memory using RT
command.   It  will make a checksum of the bootblock located in memory at
address  (sectoraddr).   If the checksum is incorrect it will be changed.
Note  that  you  can  also use T0 etc, if you have created a track buffer
using the dmon command.

DATACHK (sectoraddr)
--------------------
Check data checksum

This command is used on a sector that has been read into memory using the
Rt  command.   It  will make a data checksum on the sector located in the
computers  memory  at address (sectoraddr).  If there is a checksum error
the  checksum  will be corrected Note again this command can be used with
the T option to define half tracks in the track buffer.

BAMCHK (sectoraddr)
-------------------
Block allocation memory checksum.

This command is used on a sector that has been read into memory using the
RT  command.   It  will  make  a  checksum  on  the sector located in the
computers  memory  at address (sectoraddr).  If there is a checksum error
the checksum will be corrected.  The T options can again be used.

TRAINER COMMANDS
++++++++++++++++

The  trainer  commands are used to find various features such as infinite
lives  etc.   which could ordinarily only be found by the most proficient
hacker !!!  There is a problem however in that if the original programmer
did  not  want  you to find his secrets he could easily protect his code.
For  example  if you want to find 3 lives the programmer could count this
as 2 or even 128+3 so confusing the trainer.  These techniques can now be
beaten by the deep trainer, for more info see the following section.

The easiest way to understand how the trainer works is to explain how the
programmer accesses the number of lives.

When  the  game  starts  the programmer sets up all his locations such as
number  of  lives and energy and colors etc.  The number of lives will be
stored  in a certain location in memory and each time a life is lost this
value  will be changed (usually decreased by one) until no more lives are
present,  in  which case the game over sequence is displayed What we need
to  find is the instruction that decreases the number of lives and remove
it, then we will never get to 0 lives hence infinate lives.

TS (value)
----------
Trainer start

We  use  this instruction when starting to look for our feature (infinite
lives,  energy etc).  This clears all locations found so far and searches
for all occurances of the number (value)

T (value)
---------
Trainer continue

We  use this command after we have used the TS command, exited and lost a
life  or  energy  etc  and re-frozen.  Usually the value will be one less
than the TS command.

TX
--
Exit trainer

Exits trainer mode.  Note that if you have got infinite lives it will NOT
go back to normal mode

TF (address)
------------
Trainer find decrement instruction

We use this instruction after the TS and T commands and are left with one
address  This will themn find any possible machine code instructions that
decrement  the  location  (address).   This instruction is of more use to
someone  that  has a bit of machine code knowledge.  Others will find the
TFD command more useful.

TFD (address)
------------
Trainer find decrement instruction and remove

This  command  is  the one that gives you infinite lives.  it will search
through  for  decrements  of (address) and remove them.  (address) is the
value  found using TS and T.  After issuing this instruction, try exiting
and  continuing  the game.  If it has worked you will have infinite lives
or energy.

PC
--
Picture and energy count.

Displays  the  frozen  screen so you can view how much energy or how many
lives you] had when the game was frozen.

TDS
---
Deep trainer start

This  command  starts  the  deep  trainer  mode.   Note  how there are no
variables in the line, it is quite simply TDS.  You will use this command
when  you  have  just started a game, when you have full energy or lives.
Each  time  you  freeze the game and the value is the same (full energy 3
lives or whatever) you will use the TDS option.

TDC
---
Deep trainer Change

This  command  is similar in a way to the T command.  You enter this when
the  original  value  entered has changed.  So if you started a game with
say  full  energy  you would start using the TDS command.  Then you would
lose  some  energy,  re-freeze  and enter the TDC command.  Notice how no
numbers  are  entered.   From  here  on  you keep re-freezing the game at
different  points.   If you have full energy you will use the TDS command
if you have anything but full energy you will use the TDC command.

TDD (start)(end)
----------------
Deep trainer delete address.

This  command  is  for  the  more experienced hacker.  It will remove all
search addresses within the range start-end.

TD
--
Display deep trainer addresses.

This command will display a list of all the addresses under investigation
by  the  deep  trainer.   If  you try it after just starting with the TDS
command the list will be very long.

TDI
---
Display probable deep trainer addresses

This  is  the  most important of the deep trainer commands.  It will list
all  possible locations that your energy/lives etc can be at.  You should
repeat  the  TDS  and TDC commands over and over until typing the command
TDI  comes  up  with  the  same values over and over again.  One of these
values is the address you are looking for.  If you find that there are no
possible  adresses  it  is  more  likely that you have made a mistake and
typed TDC instead of TDS or vice versa.  You should TDX then start again.

TDX
---
Exit deep trainer

This  command  is  used to abort the previous deep trainer commands.  All
addresses will be reset.  This is useful when you have made a mistake and
need to restart.

MISC COMMANDS
+++++++++++++

RAMTEST (start)(end)
--------------------
Check memory for faults

This  instruction  will  destroy  all data between (start) and (end).  It
writes  0  to  all  locations  in the region (start)-(end) and reads them
back, then does the same for FF (hex)

PACK (start)(end)(dest)(crrate)
-------------------------------
Pack memory

This  command  will  pack  the  block of memory between start and end and
place  it  at  (dest).  (dest) may be at (start) if required and uses the
compression rate (crrate) as explained in the SA command.  When completed
the length of the compressed data will be displayed, eg.

   PACK 40000 4FFFF 50000 !200

will  pack all data between 40000 and 4FFFF and place the compressed data
at  50000  using a compression rate of 200 decimal.  Make sure you keep a
note of the length.

UNPACK (dest)(end of packed)
----------------------------
Unpack packed data

This  is  the  reverse  of PACK.  You must specify the destination of the
unpacked area (NOT OVER ITSELF!) and the last byte of the compressed data
(end  of  packed)  which  can  be  calculated  by  the  state  of the art
compressed  data + length displayed after completion of the PACK command.
For  example  assuming  the  length  of  the  packed data in the previous
command was 1234 then the reverse of the above example would be

   UNPACK 40000 51234

COLOR (back)(pen)
----------------
Set screen colors

Will set the screen colors using the amiga palette (0-!4095) (back) being
of  course  the background color and (pen) the foreground color.  This is
an  alternative  to  the  preference  screen  (F3).  When used on its own
(colour) it will display the background and foreground settings.

RCOLOR
------
Reset screen colors

This command is for when you have made a mess using the COLOR command

TM
--
Show marker

Will display the current memory markers

TMS (address)
-------------
Mark address

This  command  is  used as a note pad for reminding you of an address you
are  currently  investigating.  They are also saved using SA and reloaded
using  LA/LR  so  you can remember for example where an infinite location
is.  There are 10 possible memory markers

TMD (address)
-------------
Marker delete

This will delete one of the current memory markers

SPR (nr/addr)
------------
Edit Sprite

Will  edit  the  sprite  number (nr) or the sprie address (addr).  If for
example we have frozen workbench we type the line

   SPR 0

and  press  (return)  about twenty times the outline of the pointer would
appear  in various numbers, each number corrsponds to a color.  we can if
we  like  move  the  cursor keys and edit the sprite making sure we press
return  after  every  line  we  have  changed.  Note you can only use the
numbers 0-3 as you can only have 4 colors per sprite.

VERSION
-------
Show ROM version

Will display the date and version number of the current ROMs

MEGASTICK (1)
-------------
Joystick handler

This  command  invokes a new screen - the joystick handler screen.  It is
used  so  you  can  set the joystick up to act as certain keys, eg.  type
megastick,  press  the fire button on player 1 joystick, pull to the left
and  press  space.   From  now  on  when  you restart moving the player 1
joystick  to  the  left  and  pressing  fire  will  produce a space.  All
directions  can  be  set  up and combinations of fire pressed etc.  Press
escape  to  accept  a setup.  Use the option 1 if you only wish to select
player 1.

NOSTICK
-------
Remove joystick handler.

Disable the mega stick feature.

CLRSTICK
--------
Clear megastick values

This command clears any codes set by the mega stick command back to zero

LSTICK
------
Load megastick values

Loads the values for the megastick command that have been saved using the
sstick

SSTICK
------
Saves megastick values

Saves  the  values  that  have been set up using the megastick command to
disk for reuse at a later date

RESET
-----
Reset amiga

Resets the amiga as though CTRL-A-A has been pressed

PAL
---
Switch to PAL mode

Switched the amiga into the European PAL standard

NTSC
----
Switch to NTSC mode

Switches the amiga into the American/Japanese NTSC mode

SETMAP
------
Set keymap

Will  display a screen which will (if possible) allow the editing of keys
on  the Amiga keyboard.  For example the function key 1 can be changed to
send  the  words  function  key pressed.  To use this command simply type
setmap.   Use  the mouse to select which key you wish to change and click
on  it.  A new window is displayed with the current string and allows you
to  change it.  When you have entered a new value press (enter) and click
on  Ok to accept.  When you are happy with the new keymap you can save it
by  clicking  on  the  appropriate option for re-loading at a later date.
When  you  wish  to install the new keymap click on (install) and the new
map  will be written to memory so when you exit action replay the new map
will be used.

SETCOP (address)
----------------
Copper specify for exit of ARIV

ASCII
-----
Display ASCII map.

This  deceptively  useful  command will show the ASCII (american standard
code for information exchange) character map and corresponding codes.  It
is ideal for programmers who do not have a reference manual to hand.

ALERT (guru-number)
------------------
Display guru list.

This command is useful for programmers - when you get the guru numbers it
is often difficult to remember what thefunction is.  For example the guru
exception 8400000C does not mean much but if you type the line

   ALERT 8400000C

will  reaveal  all.   Typing Alert on its own will list all the gurus and
descriptions of such.


PRINTER COMMANDS
----------------

SMALLCHAR
---------
Small printer characters

If  you  have an Epsom printer attached this command will reduce the size
of the text sent to your printer.

NORMALCHAR
----------
Normal printer characters

Reverses the action of smallchar

PRT
---
Print string

This  instruction  sends a sequence of characters to the printer.  Either
the  text in quotation marks may be sent or a number may be sent in which
case  the ASCII value is sent to the printer.  The following example will
print "hello there" in expanded print to an Epson printer.

   PRT 1B 57 31 "hello there"


VIRUS COMMANDS
+++++++++++++++

VIRUS
-----
Search memory for virus

Will  search  through  memory  for  any known virus.  This is not usually
necessary  if  you  have  left  the  virus test ON in the (F3) preference
screen  as  you will be warned of any virus.  Please note if you have any
virus  killers  in  memory  this may confuse action replay as the program
will have bits of the viruses DNA in memory.

KILLVIRUS
---------
Search and remove virus

Search for and remove any viruses resident in memory.


MONITOR COMMANDS
++++++++++++++++

The   following  set  of  commands  are  of  most  use  to  machine  code
programmers.   Again  I  must  stress  that  to  beginners  they may seem
completely  bewildering.   However,  if you are interested in programming
machine  code there are numerous amiga books that could start you off and
as  you  read  the action replay monitor commands they will begin to make
sense.   For those of you that are already conversant in machine code you
will  find  that these commands will become essential and you will wonder
how  you  ever  did  without them.  One or two significant additions have
been  made  to  make  life  easier  such  as the im command and the trace
commands.

SETEXCEPT
---------
Sets the exception handler

Gets rid of those annoying guru messages.

COMP (start)(end)(dest)
-----------------------
Compare memory blocks

Will  compare  the  memory between (start) and (end) with that located at
(dest).  All differences in the destination block will be displayed

LM (path)(name)(dest)
---------------------
Load file to memory

This allows machine code or data to be loaded straight into memory at any
point  and  be  investigated  at  leisure.   The  memory remains when the
program  is  restarted  so  is ideal for changing blocks of data/graphics
etc.  eg.

   LM DATA,70000

will  load  the  contents  of  file data into memory starting at location
70000 in hexadecimal.

SM (path)(name)(start)(end)
---------------------------
Save memory to disk

This  command  is used to save a block of memory to disk, in the standard
(path)(name)  format  which  is located between (start) and (end).  Ideal
for saving blocks of machine code or other forms of data eg.

   SM scroll,3021F 312EA

SMDC (path)(name)(start)(end)
----------------------------
Save memory to disk in DC.B format

This  feature is ideal for the assembly language programmer where a block
of  memory  can  be  saved out as ASCII in the style DC.B followed by the
byte  values  separated  by commas which can be loaded into most assembly
packages such as DEVPAC ARGASEM etc

SMDATA (path)(name)(start)(end)
------------------------------
Save memory to disk in DATA format

This feature is similar to SMDC only the format is DATA instead of DC.B

A (address)
-----------
Start M68000 assembler

Begin enetering assembly language instructions from the specified address
all  standard  68000  instructions are supported and as long as you enter
valid  instructions  you  can  keep  on entering.  To finish simply press
(ESC).   I am not going to explain the 68000 instruction set as there are
plenty of good books etc on that.

B
-
Show breakpoints

Will show all breakpoints set using the BS command.

BS (address)
------------
Set breakpoint.

This  command  is  ideal  for  the  hacker  or  programmer  who  requires
information  at  a  certain point in the program.  You can set a point in
memory  specified by (address) to break out of the main program and enter
action  replay.   You may use this instruction after using the TF command
and  finding a life decrement instruction, say at location 41259.  So you
could  investigate  in  more  detail  the  screen  and registers, use the
commands.

   BS 49152
   X

and  as  soon  as  the  location 49152 is reached you will get the action
replay screen back.

BD (address)
------------
Breakpoint delete

Delete the breakpoint previously set at memory location (address)

BDA (address)
-------------
Delete all breakpoints

Remove all breakpoints that have been set using the BS command

MW
--
Show watchpoints

This  will  display  a  list of all the memory locations set using the MS
command

MS (address)
------------
Set memwatch point

This  is  a wonderful instruction for all ypou programmersout there - how
mant  times  have  you  found  memory  locations  becoming  corrupted and
wondering  what on earth was responsible for doing this?  All you need to
do  is  use the MS command with the byte address you wish to keep a check
on  and  start  your  program  (either  change  register PC or the G or X
commands) and as soon as any command changes your location, action replay
is activated and the program counter points to the next instruction after
the one which has done the damage, eg.

   MS 70000

would  as soon as any new value is entered into location 70000 freeze the
program  and  display  a  message.   This  I find is of more use than the
breakpoint instructions

MD (address)
------------
Delete mem watchpoint

Will delete an address from the memwatch list 

MDA
---
Delete all watchpoints

Will remove all addresses set using the MS command

TR (steps)
----------
Trace without subroutines

This  is  another  useful  command,  it will trace a machine code program
(steps)  number  of  steps  from the frozen data position (defined in the
registers).   All  memory  and  system data is upadated including screens
tec.   This makes this instruction far more powerful than equivalent disk
based  monitor trace commands as all system information can be viewed eg.
the  screen using PC.  Note that all subroutines are executed as a single
instruction

ST (steps)
----------
Trace with subroutines

This  is  similar to the Tr command apart from the one difference in that
subroutines are stepped down as continuous order and are not treated as a
single instruction as is TR.

X
-
Restart current program.

This  will  quite  simply  start  the  program from where you pressed the
freeze  button.   Any changes you made to the registers or memory will be
kept  and  so  if  you  have  made major changes the computer may produce
unexpected results or crash.

C (1/2/address)
---------------
Copper assembler/ disassembler

The  line  that  should  be  entered is C then 1 or 2 or an address.  The
amiga  is  equipped with a copper or co-processor which can be programmed
in a similar, but more limited fashion to the 68000.  After you enter the
C  and  one  of  the  possible  options  the  copper  instructions of the
locations  will be displayed.  Pressing return will enter the instruction
on  the line and move to the next instruction in memory.  For information
on the copper chips please consult an amiga technical reference manual.

ROBD
----
Enable / disable Rob Northern mode

D (address)
----------
Start disassembly

D followed by the return key will begin disassembly in 68000 m/c from the
point  at  which the program was frozen.  If an (address) is entered then
disassembly  is  started  from  that  point.  Please note you can specify
numbers in different ways eg.  T0 for track 0 if the diskmonitor is being
used or \a0 etc.  for the machine code registers, for example

   R

the computer may respond with

   D0=FFFF1234 000000000 00000028 000059d2 etc
   A0=00000676 0000FFE1E 000FFF75 00004984 etc

to view the machine code starting at the address in A1

   d\A1

will   start   disassembly   from  address  FFE1E  pressing  return  will
dissassemble  the next line and so on until (ESC) is pressed.  The cursor
keys can be used to control the direction of assembly

E (offset)
----------
Show/edit chip registers

Will show the contents of the chip registers in binary.  These values can
be changed using the cursor keys and pressing return when a line has been
modified.

F (string)(start)(end)
----------------------
Find string in memory

Will  search  through memory between (start) and (end) for all occurences
of  (string)  which  should be surrounded by quotes.  This search is case
sensitive.   This  command is also useful for finding occurances of bytes
in  memory  or even instructions.  FS will search for a string but is not
case sensitive eg.

   F"COMMODORE",0 7FFFF

will  search  for COMMODORE (note in upper case) between the limits 0 and
7FFFF

   F 4E 71,70000 80000

will  search through memory from hex 70000 to hex 80000 for occurances of
bytes  4E  followed  by  71  which  also  corresponds  to  the  assembler
instruction NOP

FA (address)(start)(end)
------------------------
Search for Adr addressing opcode

Will  search  through  memory  for  adr addressing opcodes.  This is very
useful  debugging/hacking tool for the more advanced user.  Its action is
to  search  through  all  locations between (start) and (end) for machine
code  instructions  that access location (address).  FAQ will fast search
through  memory.   The  use  of these instructions is to find out where a
subroutine is called from eg.

   FA 71000 60000 80000

on my machine responed with the following lines

   070002 BSR 00071000
   07000C BRA 00071000
   Searched up to adr: 080000

FAQ (Fast search for adr addressing opcode - SEE FA)
-----------------------------------------------------

FR (string)(start)(end)
-----------------------
Search relative for string

Searches  through  memory  for a relative string and displays the offset.
For  example if a piece of text is hidden by adding one character it will
be  shown  as  occuring  with an offset of one so a search for "HELLO" on
finding "IFMMP" will display an offset of one

FS (search for a string - not case sensitive - SEE F)
-----------------------------------------------------

G (address)
-----------
Goto address

On  its own will act the same as X.  With an address specified G will set
all  the  registers to what they were when the program was frozen (unless
they  have since been modified) and jump to (address).  Ideal if you want
to  re-direct  the  program or test out an Assembly program you have just
entered.

TRANS (start)(end)(dest)
-----------------------
Transfer memory block

Will  transfer a block of memory between (start) and (end) to destination
(dest).   The  transfer  is intelligent so you may specify a (dest) which
lies between start and end

WS (string)(address)
--------------------
Write string to memory

Will  write  a  string  (bounded  by  quotes)  to  the memory starting at
(address) you can also use numerical values (not in quotes) eg.

   WS "HI THERE", 41259

M (address)
-----------
Show/ Edit memory as bytes

This  will  display a line of data in byte format in hexadecimal starting
from  location  (address).   The  bytes  can  be  changed  to  any  valid
hexadecimal number using the cursor keys and appropriate numbers.  When a
line  has  been  altered  pressing return will enter those alterations to
memory  and  display  the next set of bytes from memory.  Press escape to
exit this feature.

MEMCODE (start)(end)(code)
--------------------------
Encode memory

Will  go  through  a block of memory encrypting each byte using the 68000
EOR  instruction with (code).  This has the effect of rendering the block
unreadable.   To  decypher  this  code  you  may  either  use  the  68000
instruction EOR.B or execute the instruction again in an identical manner
eg.

   MEMCODE 312FE 345A1 EA

will  encode a block of memory using the key EA (in hex).  To get it back
to normal simply type

   MEMCODE 312FE 345A1 EA

ADD (start)(end)(value)
-----------------------
Adds value to memory range

N (address)
-----------
Show / edit memory as bytes

Similar to the M command but memory is shown as ASCII 

NO (offset)
-----------
Show/set ASCII offset

When a value is entered as (offset) any furthur use of the N command will
add the (offset) value to the characters in memory that are displayed eg.
if we did an ASCII dump using N and got the following in a block of text

   IFMMP

and we then entered the line

   NO 1

The same piece of text viewed using another N command would be

   HELLO

So  the command can be used for showing hidden text.  NO on its own shows
the current (offset)

NQ (address)
------------
Display memory quick

Will display memory in ASCII in quick format

O (string)(start)(end)
----------------------
Fill memory with string

This  command  will  fill  a  block  of memory with repeated sequences of
(string) which should be bounded by quotes.

R (register)(value)
-------------------
Display / modify registers

R return will display the contents of all the 68000 registers at the time
of freezing If you wish to modify these registers you should specify both
a (register) number and the (value) to be inserted in it eg.

   R DO !1000

will  insert 1000 decimal into the 32 bit register DO.  Any modifications
to  these registers will become valid when you either exit using the X or
G commands

W (register)
------------
Display CIA contents

Displays  the  contents  of  both  the  CIA  (8520)  chips.  The value in
(register)  used  to  define the offset from the start of the CIAs.  Both
chips  are  displayed on the same line the first and second numbers being
the first and second CIAs correspondingly for example.

   W 4

will  display  the  contents of the fourth register on both the first and
second CIAs

Y (address)
-----------
Display memory in binary form

This  instruction  is  vey  similar  to  the M command although memory is
displayed and edited in binary form.  The amount of bits displayed on one
line  is specified by YS (value) where value is 1 -8 giving the amount of
bytes displayed per line eg.

   YS 8

will tell the Y command to display 64 bits per line.  The address will be
updated accordingly

YS (see Y above)
----------------

? EQUATION
----------
Calculate value

This  instruction is ideal for altering between number bases.  The result
of the (equation) will be displayed in binary hex and decimal eg.

   ?8+7+!15*2

will  give  the  result  !60.   Notice  this  is not the same as previous
versions  of action replay the standard priority orders of multiplication
and  division  first  and  addition  and subtraction second are now used.
Valid symbols are +, -, /, *.
