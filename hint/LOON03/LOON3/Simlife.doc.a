                                INTRODUCTION


"Life! Don't talk to me about life."

 - Marvin The Paranoid Android
   from The Hitchhiker's Guide to
   the Galaxy by Douglas Adams


      
                                                                [PAGE:   2]
INTRODUCTION

SimLife is an Artificial Life Laboratory/Playground designed to simulate
environments, biology, evolution, ecosystems, and life.


WHAT IS SIMLIFE?

SimLife is a game, a toy and an experimental tool to learn about life, real
and artificial.

As a game, SimLife challenges you to successfully solve the problems
presented to you in each of six different scenarios.

As an experimental tool, SimLife gives you the power to:

   * create and modify worlds;
  
   * create and modify plants and animals at the genetic level;
  
   * design environments and ecosystems;
  
   * simulate and control evolution; and even

   * change the physics of the universe.

A major feature and purpose of SimLife is that it is an exploration of the
emerging computer field of Artificial Life.


YOUR REASONS TO (SIM)LIVE

The goals in playing SimLife are many, and, as with most Maxis products,
are entirely up to you.

If you approach SimLife as a game, then your goals can be to win each of
the scenarios. If you approach SimLife as a "laboratory in a computer,"
your goals are as limitless as your imagination. If you approach SimLife
as a toy, you don't need goals; you can just play with plants, animals and
ecosystems.

If you are interested in monitoring your personal progress or understanding
of the ecological systems in SimLife, you can keep an eye on the Ecology Score
in the Graphs Window. It displays an ongoing score of the ecological soundness
of your ecosystem, which you can view as a rating of how well you are doing as
master of life on your world. There is also an evaluation window that 
graphically shows how complex your ecosystem is, as well as assigning a score
to your performance.

      
                                                                [PAGE:   3]

THE ULTIMATE GOAL?

Perhaps the greatest challenge of playing SimLife is to start from scratch
and design and build a world with a sustainable ecosystem.

It's not an easy task, and once tou do it you may realize just how fragile
an ecosystem can be: how a small change in the environment or the extinction
of a single species can cause a wave of destruction that destroys life up and
down the food chain.

What can be considered the ultimate goal of SimLife is to look beyond the 
game, to understand that the real world with its millions of species with
their combined billions of genes are all interrelated and carefully balance
in the food chain and the web of life, and that this balance can be upset. 
Once we realize this, maybe we'll treat our planet, our environment and life
itself with the respect they deserve and need. OK. Enough heaviosity. Go play.


LEVELS OF PLAY

SimLife was designed to be played at different levels:

   * On the simple game level of trying to solve the scenarios;

   * On a simple experimental/play level of building your own
     worlds, animals, and ecosystems; and
 
   * On a complex experimental level where you control (or
     meddle with) the laws of physics and manipulate plants and
     animals at the genetic level.

You can do these things in any of five difficulty levels, from beginner to
expert.

      
                                                                [PAGE:   4]

SOFTWARE TOYS AND SYSTEM SIMULATIONS

SimLife isn't exactly a game - it's what we call a Software Toy. Toys, by
definition, are more flexible and open-ended than games.

As an example, compare a game, tennis, with a toy, a ball. In every tennis
game, there is one way to begin, one goal to pursue and one way to end. There
are infinite variations in the middle, but they all start the same way, chase
the same goal and end the same way. A ball is more flexible - there are more
things you can do with it. With the ball, you can play tennis. You can play
catch. You can throw it at someone. You can bounce it. You can make up a 
hundred different games using the ball. Besides games, there are other things
you can do with a ball. You can paint it, use it to plug a leaky roof, or just
contemplate its roundness.
  
In SimLife, the "toy" is a biology laboratory in a computer.

When you play with SimLife, or any of our other Software Toys(R), don't limit
yourself to trying to "win." Play with it. Experiment. Try new things. Just
have fun.

There are many types of toys. SimLife, like SimCity(R), SimEarth(R), and
SimAnt(R) before it, is a SYSTEM SIMULATION toy. In a system simulation, we
provide you with a set of RULES and TOOLS that describe, create and control a
system. In the case of SimLife, the system is an ecosystem. Part of the 
challenge of playing with a system simulation toy is to figure out how the
system works and take control of it. As master of the system, you are free to
use the Tools to create and control an unlimited number of systems (in this
case, ecosystems) within the framework provided by the Rules.

In SimLife, the Rules to learn are based on biology and behavior, including:

Environment: All life is affected by its external environmental conditions,
including the landscape, the climate, physical disasters and most importantly,
other life-forms.
      
                                                                [PAGE:   5]

Genetics: Living beings are defined by the genes they carry and pass on to 
their offspring.

Evolution: Life changes in response to its environtment; species adapt to 
their surroundings and evolve into new species.

Behavior: To survive individually and as a species, life-forms must find food
and water, defend themselves from predators and reproduce.

The Food Chain: For an ecosystem to be stable, the food chain must be a 
complete circle; herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat herbivores, plants
consume animal waste and rotted carcasses. The sun provides the energy to keep
the cycle going.

Ecosystems: In addition to the cycling of material in the food chain, a
stable ecosystem has to efficiently cycle oxygen, carbon dioxide, water and
other important gasses and minerals between life, the atmosphere and the land.
  
The Tools provide you with the ability to design and build worlds and 
ecosystems:

   * Create landforms with lakes, mountains, rivers and impassable barriers.

   * Modify the climate: set temperature ranges, humidity, seasonal changes,
     and day-length variations with the Weather Lab.

   * Mix and match pre-defined plants and animals, modify them at the genetic
     level, or create your own life-forms in the Biology Lab.

   * Use mutagens to cause mutations and speed up evolution.

   * Change the laws of physics: set the lengths of days and years, change the
     energy it takes to walk, swim, or fly.

   * Track your data with graphs and charts that display population and
     genetic changes through time.
      
                                                                [PAGE:   6]

But the most important Tool of all is the simulator itself. Test your 
knowledge, plans, theories and ideas as you watch your creatures and
ecosystems thrive or die.


WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL LIFE?

SimLife is an Artificial Life playshop/toolkit/workshop.

Artificial Life (A-life) is an emerging new field in computer science that
is giving us a whole new way to study biology, evolution and life itself. Our
Software Toys make use of A-life technology to simulate living systems that
change and grow depending on the choices you make.

The idea behind A-life is to produce lifelike behavior on a computer (or
other artificial media), where it can be studied in ways real living things
cannot. A-life creates a laboratory in a computer, where the scientist can
completely control all environmental factors - even time.

One of the most important features of A-life is emergent behavior - when 
complex behavior emerges from the combination of many individuals following
simple rules. Two examples of emergent behavior are ant colonies in the real
world, and SimCity in the computer world. In fact, biologic "life as we know
it" can be considered a form of emergent behavior.

Another important aspect of A-life is evolution - artificial life-forms can
react to their environment and grow, reproduce and evolve into more complex
forms.

The future of A-life holds much potential and promise. It may someday go
beyond the experimental world into the practical realm of design. The tools
and techniques being developed now will someday allow us to grow or evolve
designs for complex systems ranging from software to airplanes to 
intelligence.

In a sense, A-life has the same ultimate goal as Artificial Intelligence (AI),
but uses opposite methods. AI uses a top-down approach to create a thinking
      
                                                                [PAGE:   7]

machine that emulates the human brain. A-life uses the bottomup approach - 
start with single cells and grow/evolve life with intelligence.


ABOUT SIMLIFE DOCUMENTATION

There are five parts to the docs for SimLife: the manual, the machine-
specific addendum, the lab book, the registration card and the President's
letter/support info card.

The manual (that which you now hold in your hands) was typed by Rygar and has:

   * An introduction chapter that gives you a little background on the game
     and a brief explanation of Artificial Life;

   * A Getting Started chapter to get you up and running;

   * A three-part Tutorial that gives you some background info, leads you
     through many of the windows and functions of the program and shows you
     how to set up, conduct and evaluate an experiment;

   * A Reference section that gives more background information, complete
     descriptions of every menu, window, button and function, sample 
     experiments to try and miscellaneous information on the simulation; and
 
   * A Glossary, a Bibliography and an Index.
  
The machine-specific addendum gives you any special info you'll need for your
particular computer, including loading, saving, printing, special menu items,
and keyboard shortcuts. It also has any last-minute features that were too
recent to make it into the manual. If you have any questions that aren't 
answered in the manual, check your machine-specific addendum.

The lab book goes along with the experiment in the tutorial to give you an
example of one way to write up SimLife experiments. The lab book also has data
sheets containing printed blanks of most of the windows that you can copy,
draw in the data, and include in your own lab reports.
      
                                                                [PAGE:   8]

Sending in the registration card entitles you to free technical support, an
extended warranty on SimLife and a while bunch of other things. Read it,
fill it out and send it in. You'll be glad you did.

The President's letter invites you to contact Maxis about any problems or
suggestions you may have with or for SimLife. The support info (on the back of
the President's letter) tells you how to contact us for customer service and
technical support.


VARIOUS SIMLIFE VERSIONS AND MANUAL GRAPHICS

SimLife is (or soon will be) available on a number of different computer
systems. We try to keep all the versions as close to each other as possible, 
while staying true to the individual interface differences of each machine.

The graphics for this manual are taken primarily from the Color Macintosh
version of SimLife because it was ready first. On any other computer, there
will be some slight differences in the look of the program. All the same
features and functions will be there, but some things (like buttons) may be
moved around a little. If you screen doesn't exactly match the graphics in the
manual, check in the machine-specific addendum for a complete explanation of
how SimLife has been customized for your computer
       
                                                                [PAGE:   9]

On most computers, SimLife must be installed to a hard disk before it can
be run. See your computer-specific addendum for installation instructions on
your computer


STARTING THE PROGRAM

Once again, see your computer-specific addendum for starting instructions.
  

ABOUT THE TUTORIALS

There is an on-screen tutorial built into SimLife. Once you start the program,
you will see the New Game Window. Click on the button that says Tutorial, then
click on Make It So. You will be taken on a quick tour through the basic 
features of SimLife.

In addition, there is a fairly extensive tutorial in this manual, written in 
three parts.

The first part gives some background information on SimLife, and on life
itself. You may want to skim through this section before going on. Most
of you will just jump right in and start messing around with the game.
Enjoy yourself - the information will be here when you want it.

The second part is a tour of the major features, functions and windows. We
won't be chasing any particular goal here, just playing around and getting
familiar with many of the things you can do with SimLife.

The third part of the tutorial is the complete design, setup and execution
of an experiment. We'll define the goals of the experiment, decide what
kind of world and what kind of life would be best to reach the goals, and
carry it out. Included in the SimLife package is a "lab book" that 
summarizes the steps in the experiment, and leaves room for recording data
and conclusions [SORRY LAB BOOK NOT INCLUDED - JUST EMPTY PAGES ANYWAYS - [R]
      
                                                                [PAGE:  11]

 long line of determined, resourceful,
 microscopic tadpoles - champions

TUTORIAL

This tutorial covers a lot of material fairly quickly. If you're not already
somewhat familiar with SimLife, you'll probably want to run through the
on-screen tutorial first. It can be started from the New Game Window. Or
you may want to give the Before You Being section below a quick onceover,
then do the on-screen tutorial.

The graphics in this tutorial are from the color Macintosh version. The
screens on your computer may vary a little. See your machine-specific
addendum for more details.


BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Before playing SimLife, there are a few things you'll want to know.


WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

I hope you have many heads, because while playing SimLife you'll be
wearing many hats. Depending on the scenario you play or the experiment you
design, you can think of yourself as:

   * a planetary game warden trying to protect and improve
     various ecosystems;

   * a behavioral ecologist exploring the different ways plants
     and animals interact in their ecosystems;

   * an evolutionary biologist trying to prove theories;

   * Charles Darwin (only in his dreams);

   * a being with amazing powers who creates worlds, populates them with
     plants and animals, and balances ecosystems for fun;

   * an Artificial Life experimenter; and
   
   * a normal human trying to play and win a pretty complex computer game.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  13]


What you are trying to do is:

   * win each of the scenarios;

   * stick your finger into an ecosystem, muck it up a bit and see 
     what happens;

   * simulate current ecological situations (and disasters) and
     try to recover before it's too late;

   * build your own ecosystem from scratch;

   * design and carry out any number of experiments that deal with plants,
     animals, genetics, evolution and ecosystems;

   * casually observe the interactions between plants, animals and the
     environment over a long period of time; and
 
   * have fun.


OF MICE AND KEYBOARDS

SimLife is much easier and more fun to play if you have a mouse. This 
tutorial and the manual in general assume you have one.

If you don't have a mouse, check in the computer-specific addendum for
instructions on using menus and controlling windows, and for keyboard
equivalents to terms like "clicking" and "dragging."


SIMPLICITY AND RICHNESS

SimLife deals with life and ecosystems in a very simplified way. 
Simplification serves a few purposes. If it were even 1/10th as complex as the
world we live in, it would have taken us 100 years to make the program, it
would cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you'd need a computer
the size of Baltimore to play it.

Because it is simple, time can be sped up and experiments that would take
hundreds of years in real time can be performed in hours or minutes. Because
it is simple, many external influences can be removed for experimental
controls that cannot be removed in "real world" experiments.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  14]

SimLife, even while extremely simple compared to life as we live it, is a
fairly deep game/simulation/toy. It has many interrelated features and
functions that make it quite powerful and take a bit of htinking to master.

One of the most powerful features in SimLife is the ability to limit or 
ignore many of the features. Depending on the game or experiment you may
require a large, rich, complex world with climatic changes, mountains and
valleys, and a convoluted web of plants and animals preying on each other, or
just a small spot of ground with no mountains, no weather changes and only one
type of life.

Both the tutorial below and some of the scenarios will deal with some small,
simple setups so you can play and explore right away without learning 
everything first, and gradually deal with more complex worlds and experiments.


BUTTONS AND MORE BUTTONS

This game has more buttons than all the bellies in Chine. It can be a little
confusing at first, but follow the tutorial and you'll meet most of them
one at a time. Then you can read the reference section of this manual (just
kidding - I know nobody reads reference sections of manuals) to find out 
exactly what each and every button does. If all else fails and you can't
decide which button to press, try eeny-meeny-miney-moe.


IT'S ABOUT TIME

Time in SimLife consists of Ticks, Days and Years. Each year is divided up
into four seasons of equal length: summer, fall, winter and spring.

A tick is one simulation cycle. The actual length of a tick in real seconds
depends on your computer's speed, the size of the world and the number of
organisms in the world.

The number of ticks per day and days per year varies with the different
scenarios and can be customized for different experiments. By adjusting
ticks and days, you adjust the rate at which time passes. When a scenario
or experiment deals with the behavior of one animal or one generation, then
you will want time to go slowly so the animal has time to exhibit its
behavior. When a scenario or experiment deals with the genetic drift
over many generations, then you will want time to pass quickly.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  15]



OTHER STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW (SIMLIFE CONVENTIONS AND TERMINOLOGY)

Here are a few things to keep in mind while working your way through the
tutorial:


MENUS

To play SimLife, you'll have to understand how to use menus. Many computers
these days have menuing systems built into their operating systems, including
Macintosh, Amiga and Windows-based computers. In these cases we follow all
the standard menu-use conventions for your computer/operating system.

Check your machine-specific addendum for special menu details (if any) and for
keyboard shortcuts for opening menus and selecting menu items.


DOWN-ARROW (TRIANGLE) BUTTONS

Whenever you see a button with a down-arrow, or traingle pointing down, it
means you can click and hold on this button to open a pop-up menu of choices.

Clicking quickly on any down-arrow button wil automatically reselect the last
selection without opening the submenu.


SELECTED SPECIES

Within most windows, only one species will be "active" at a time. And when 
playing SimLife, you usually play with one species at a time, checking it out
in one window, spreading it in another, and modifying it in yet another.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  16]

Reselecting the species each time you jump to another window would be a 
hassle, so in most windows, when you select a species, it becomes the
default or Selected Species for most other windows. The Selected Species
stays selected until you pick another one.


LOCAL SPECIES

Selecting a species in some windows does not make that species the "official"
Selected Species. The lucky plant or animal you choose in these windows
becomes the center of attention for the current window only - they are local
stars. Since we need to call the something, these are called the Local
Species.

Choosing or changing the Local Species in these windows does not change the
Selected Species or Local Species in any other windows.


WHAT IS:

Warning: the following definitions are very short and simplified to give you
just enough of a background to get started with SimLife. This is not a 
complete discussion of these topics, and they are dealt with primarily as 
they are used in SimLife, which is not a totally accurate representation of
the real world. (In spite of this warning, I know I'll get some tersely
reprimanding letters from biologists and other scientists for my casual
treatment of these issues. I'm doing my best. So it's not perfect. So shoot
me. I'll be taking notes for the upcoming manual for SimMartyr.)


LIFE

Defining life is not easy. (As if you'd believe me if I told you.) You'll get
a different answer from everyone you ask and every book you read. But
basically, life is a gene's way of making copies of itself.

Some definitions of life include the requirement that organisms be composed
of one or more cells. Is this chauvinism? If cells can be considered "building
blocks," can we stretch the definition of cell to include building blocks made
of computer code as well as protoplasm? Is this a subject that is likely to
keep philosophers and science fiction afficionados occupied for years to come?
      
                                                                [PAGE:  17]

For the purposes of playing with SimLife, we'll define life as anything that
exhibits lifelike behavior, including: adaptive behavior, self-replication
and the ability to extract order from the environment.

That's what life is. For answer to why it is or what it means, you'll have to
look somewhere other than in a computer game.


SPECIES

A species is a group of related organisms or populations capable of
interbreeding.


ENVIRONMENT

The environment, as used in SimLife, is the total external influence upon an
organism. This includes the influences of climate, landscape, other life-forms
and your computer. In fact, everything but the organism's genetic code.


ECOLOGY

Today, when most people hear the word ecology, they think of all the things
that are going wrong, like pollution, endangered species and declining
rainforests. But ecology, in our world as well as in SimLife, is also the
"good stuff."

Ecology is the study of the interrelationships of organisms and their
environment. All the interrelationships, both good and bad.


ECOSYSTEM

An ecosystem is the combination of the environment and the life in it
functioning together as an ecological unit in nature (or in computer).

In SimLife, we will often refer to the world as an ecosystem, and use the
words "world" and "ecosystem" interchangeably, since the SimLife world is such
a small place compared to the world we live in. It is, however, possible to
have two or more ecosystems running simultaneously in a SimLife world.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  18]



PLANTS AND ANIMALS

In SimLife, there are two basic types of life-forms: plants and animals, which
roughly correspond to plants and animals in our world, but are, of course, 
much simplified.

All life wants to survive, individually and as a species. In order for an
animal to survive as an individual, it must find food and eat without being
eaten. To survive as a species, many of the individuals must also live long
enough to find a mate and reproduce.

The process of an animal finding food while simultaneously avoiding becoming
food is called foraging. Foraging includes defense from predators, and is 90%
of animal behavior.

Finding a mate (in SimLife, at least) is almost a byproduct of foraging.
Animals follow their foraging patterns looking for food and water and get
distracted and sidetracked by the presence of the opposite sex.

Plants, as well as animals, have behavior. They aren't as active or as noisy
as animals, but they have to absorb nourishment, reproduce and spread their
seeds.

Plants don't have to forage for food; they get their nutrients from the soil,
the atmosphere and the sun. In SimLife, areas with deeper soil have more
nutrients for plants. Unlike animals, plants can't move around, but their
seeds can.

As plants and animals die, they decompose and enrich the soil (increase the
soil depth).
      
                                                                [PAGE:  19]



FOOD, FOOD CHAINS AND FOOD WEBS


FOOD

Food is anything that can be consumed by the life in SimLife. All the food
that plants need is found in sunlight, air and soil. Food for animals is more
varied and includes plants and plant products, other animals, filter food and
Ultra-Food.


PLANTS

When animals eat plants, they don't necessarily eat all the plant, or enough
of the plant to kill it. They can nibble the leaves and the plant can grow new
ones. Animals can also eat seeds. fruit and nectar from plants.


FILTER FOOD

Filter food is the microscopic and near-microscopic plants and animals in the
water, air and soil that are eaten by filter food-eating animals. For example,
some whales live on plankton, tiny plants and animals that live near the
surface of the ocean.

Filter food is alive and needs nourishment, and often sunlight, so it 
concentrates at the surface of the water, and near shorelines both in and out
of the water.


OTHER ANIMALS

Animals can be predators and can eat other animals - if they can catch them.


ULTRA-FOOD

The closest thing to Ultra-Food that occurs in our world is the supermarket,
where you can walk in and get any and all of the food you need. In SimLife,
this food source looks like a shopping cart. It supplies an unlimited amount
of whatever food an animal needs to any animal that approaches it.

Ultra-Food is a useful tool for helping new ecosystems get started and for
miraculously saving the lives of starving animals.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  20]



FOOD CHAINS

A food chain is an arrangement of plants and animals in an ecosystem 
structured according to who eats whom. Usually with the eater shown above the
eatee.

Plants and filter food are usually considered the bottom of the chain, with
herbivores (animals that eat plants) in the middle and predatory carnivores
(animals that eat other animals) at the top.


FOOD WEBS

A food web is the combination of all the interactive food chains in an
ecosystem.


GENETICS AND GENES

Genetics is the study of genes, the carriers of the genetic code that defines
what we are and sets the limits of what we can become.

The genetic code of plants and animals in SimLife is much shorter and simpler
than for organisms in our world. Whereas our genes are encoded and stored in
a complex molecule called DNA, SimLife genes are encoded and stored in 
something like a database file.

While fewer and simpler, genes in SimLife are very powerful. One gene in a
SimLife organism has the equivalent effect on that organism as hundreds or 
thousands of our genes have on us.


CHROMOSOMES

Chromosomes are long chains of genes. There can be many (thousands to 
millions) genes in a single chromosome. Different life-forms on earth have
different amounts of chromosomes: Humans have 46, the fruit fly has 8, an
onion has 16, a dog has 78, a goldfish has 94, and a rygarius has about 451.

In SimLife, each chromosome consists of a single gene.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  21]



GENOMES, PROTOTYPES, POPULATIONS AND GENE POOLS


GENOMES

In SimLife, a genome is the set of all the genes in an individual organism.
The genome will be different for each species and may vary from individual to
individual within a species.


PROTOTYPE GENOME

Every species in SimLife has a "prototype" genome. This is the original or 
master set of genes - the genetic starting point when a species is created.
Through evolution, individuals will vary from the prototype genome. Over time,
individuals may vary so much from the prototype that they would no longer be
able to successfully mate with it, and by definition become another species.


POPULATION

A population is a group of organisms from a single species.


GENE POOLS

A species' gene pool is the total of all the genes in a population. It
represents all the genetic possibilities currently being explored by that
population.

A gene pool isn't an actual physical gathering of the genes - you don't take
all the genes out of their organisms and mix'em up in a big vat or pool. It's
just a way to think of the information contained in a while mess of genes at
once, while they are spread out in their various organisms.


EVOLUTION

What most people think of as evolution - adaption of plants and animals to 
changes in their environment, physical changes in plants and animals, survival
of the fittest, and new species evolving from older ones - are not evolution,
they are the results of evolution.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  22]


Evolution, simply put, is the constantly ongoing process of changes in the
gene pool over time. Nothing more, nothing less. It is the combination of many
minute genetic changes over a long period of time that produces the noticeable
results mentioned above.

The mechanisms that bring about changes in the gene pool are natural
selection, genetic drift, gene flow, mutation and recombination.

In SimLife, evolution can occur by all of these naturally occurring 
mechanisms, plus one more. In SimLife, you can directly look at an organism's
genes and physically change them.


SPECIATION

Speciation is the process of one species evolving into another (or group of
other) species. It usually occurs when populations of the same species become
physically separated and are subject to different environmental pressures. 
Over a long period of time, the gene pools in the two populations drift apart
and eventually the two populations cannot interbreed (even if physically 
brought back together), and they become two different species.

In SimLife, species will automatically change into new species as they diverge
from the prototype (if you have AutoSpeciate turned on). These new species 
will retain the same icon and name - with the addition of the subname 
Version 2 - until you change them.

You can also manually speciate - pick an individual and change it into another
species.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  23]



TAKE A TOUR OF YOUR COMPUTERIZED ECOSYSTEM

Make sure the game is installed properly, then start it up. See your machine-
specific addendum for instructions.

This tutorial assumes that you have amouse and know how to click, double-click
and click-and-drag. If you don't have a mouse and/or don't know how to do 
these things, see the manual that came with your computer, and the SimLife
machine-specific addendum.


DECISIONS, DECISIONS

Once the game has started, you will immediately be faced with the New Game
Window and a decision: picking a scenario to play.

                                   Tutorial 


                              Meadows to Forests

                               Predator & Prey
  
                              The Longest Chain?

                             The Roaches' Revenge

                             Battle of The Sexes
  
                               E Pluribus Unum


                              Experimental Mode


Each of the six scenarios present a different gaming and learning challenge.
You can also play SimLife in Experimental Mode and set up your own scenarios
and experiments. In addition, this window can launch you into the on-screen
tutorial. (If you haven't already been through it, now would be a fine time
for it.)
      
                                                                [PAGE:  24]


Click on (and highlight) the names of each of the scenarios - without clicking
on the Play Scenario button. Read the descriptions of each scenario as they
appear in the big box in the upper-right corner of the window.

After you've looked them all over, click on Experimental Mode, then click
on Play Scenario. We'll take a quick tour of the various menus and windows
in SimLife, then build our own scenario.


AND ON THE MENU TONIGHT...

Take a moment and look at the Menu Bar. It will be at or near the top of the
screen. As usual, these menus group similar types of commands together for
easy access: all the file-related commands are in the File Menu and so on.

Click and hold on each of the menus and take a quick look at the commands. 
Slide the pointer (while still holding down the mouse button) down to the
differnt menu items. Notice that some items bring up submenus. Look these 
over, too.

Check your machine-specific addendum for special menu details for your
computer and keyboard shortcuts for opening menus and selecting menu items.


HOW DASHING!

The Dashboard is your control center.

The Dashboard will differ more from computer to computer than anything else
in SimLife. Depending on your computer, it may appear as either a separate
moveable window at the bottom of the screen, or as a control bar at the top of
the screen. It may or may not have the game clock included, and it may have 
some other slight variations.

In addition, in some versions (including DOS and Windows), the Map and Edit
Window Control Panels appear at the top of the screen along with the 
Dashboard.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  25]



MACINTOSH DASHBOARD

DOS AND WINDOWS DASHBOARD, WITH EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL

DOS AND WINDOWS DASHBOARD, WITH MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL

(skipped - later in the manual you will see what all the icons do! -RYGAR)
      
                                                                [PAGE:  26]



NOW YOU SEE IT...

The left side of the Dashboard has lots of buttons and pictures. These are
for controlling which plants and animals are visible in the Edit and Map
Windows.

A row of icons displays the differnt life-forms in SimLife, and how they will
look in the Edit Window

Click on the "A" button to display animals, and the "P" button to display
plants. There are more plants and animals available than can be seen at one
time. Click the right and left arrows to scroll through all of them.

There is a little rectangle below each icon. Depending on your monitor, the
rectangle will be a color, a shade or a symbol. This rectangle shows what
the organism will look like in the Map Window. (Since the Map Window covers
such a big area, the life-forms look so small that they can't be shown as
icons or pictures, so they show up as small colored dots on color monitors
and little symbols on black and white monitors.)

What if two of the animals you want to use are the same color or symbol? You
won't be able to tell them apart in the Map Window! Or what if you just don't 
like the color we chose for your favorite electronic pet? Your aesthetic
sensibilities might be offended!

Never fear: you have the power to change the color/shade/pattern of any
organism. Click and hold on any rectangle to reveal a submenu of all the 
available colors/shades/patterns. (This is a super-secret hidden feature,
      
                                                                [PAGE:  27]

so don't tell anybody about it. This information isn't in anyone else's
manual, just yours. We think you're special.)

Below each rectangle is an On/Off button. Clicking these buttons toggles
the display of each organism on and off in the Edit and Map Windows.

Turning a plan or animal off in the Dashboard does not kill it or change
it or remove it from the game or disk. It only turns the organism invisible.

At the moment, other than the buttons changing from saying "on" to "off"
and back again, nothing will happen since we haven't placed any of these
life-forms in the world yet.

Why not see everything all the time? It can be confusing to have hundreds
or thousands of animals running around on your screen. Sometimes it's
easiest to remove all the clutter and just look at one plant or animal (or a
couple of each) at a time.


A STAR IS BORN

The middle section of the Dashboard displays and lets you choose the
"Selected Species," which is, at least for a while, the star of the show.

Often while playing with SimLife, you'll be concentrating on one species at a
time, jumping from one window to another gathering information. If you select
a species in one window, it is automatically selected for most of the other
windows. This way you don't have to reselect the same organism every time you
switch windows.

The Selected Species can be chosen in most windows. To select it in the
Dashboard, read on.


GETTING DOWN

Some buttons in SimLife open pop-up menus when you click and hold on them.

These buttons are marked by a small down-arrow. The Dashboard has two of them,
one near the middle, and one near the right side.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  28]


Depending on your computer, click or click and hold on the down-arrow
button near the center of the Dashboard. You now see a menu of all the
plants and animals in SimLife. To select an item, click on your choice or
slide the cursor to it and let go.

The name of the new Selected Species will appear in the middle of the
Dashboard, and its icon will be highlighted in the Display section to the 
left.


WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY BUTTONS

As you may have noticed, many of the windows in SimLife have a lot of
buttons, including the Dashboard. To help you remember what all the buttons
do, we give you yet another button.

Click and hold on the Help button. As long as you hold down the mouse button,
you'll see a display of what every button in the Dashboard does.

Most windows in SimLife have these Help buttons, and they all work the
same way. Use them any time you want a reminder of what does what.

Near the Help button are a couple of words. These words indicate the currently
active tool in the Edit Window. We'll come back to this later.


                                              These Five buttons from Left

HOLD ON A MINUTE

The button on the far right of the Dashboard pauses the simulation. It works
just like a pause button on a tape player. Click it to stop time. Click it
again to start time.

When you're done playing with it, leave the Pause off.


YOU CAN GET THERE FROM HERE

To the left of the Pause button are five window-opening buttons

(from Left to Right)

Open Edit Window, Open Map Window, Open Biology Lab, Open Climate Lab, Open
Census Window Pop-up menu

Notice that the Census Windows button has the down-arrow - that famous down-
arrow that means a pop-up menu is hidden under it.

Click and hold on the Census Windows button and look at the pop-up menu
of all the Census Windows.

Take a minute or two and click on each of these buttons, open all the windows,
including all the Census Windows, take a quick look at them and then close 
them. Except for the Edit Window, they can all be closed by clicking in the
close box in the upper-left corner of the window. As the windows appear, 
you'll notice a couple of things:

   * The Dashboard always stays on top of any other window - even active ones.

   * Only one Census Window can be displayed at once.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  30]



SEE THE WORLD

Once you've had a chance to glimpse each of the windows, take a closer look
at the Map Window. You can open or activate it either by clicking on the Map
Window button on the Dashboard or by selecting Map in the Windows menu.

This window shows you the entier world. If you screen is big enough, you can
move the window around by clicking and dragging the title bar. You can close
the Map Window by clicking in the Close Box in the upper-left corner.

The main portion of this window is the map of your world. Somewhere in the map
is a rectangle - the Edit Rectangle. It outlines the part of the map that is
visible in the Edit Window (a closeup view of parts of the world that we'll be
looking at soon).
      
                                                                [PAGE:  31]



CONTROL THE WORLD

Note: as shown in this manual, the Map Window Control Panel is found at the
bottom of the Map Window. On some computers, it will appear at the top of the
screen, as part of the Dashboard. Don't worry, it's there somewhere. See your
machine-specific addendum for details.

At the bottom of the window is the Map Window Control Panel. It controls what
information is seen in the map.

In just about the middle of the Map Window Control Panel is a Help button.
Click and hold on it to see an explanation of what all the other buttons do.

The five buttons on the left toggle on and off displays of multi-level data.
Each of these displays a range of information, like Altitude low to high.
Only one of these can be on at a time. Just to the right of these buttons
is a color key to help interpret the multi-level information.

Go ahead and click on them. When you're done, leave the Altitude display on.

To the right of the Help button are seven buttons that toggle on and off 
displays of single-level information. Any or all or none of these can be on
at the same time.

At this point, since the world is still very empty, the only button that will
change anything in the display is the Water button. But go ahead and click on
all of them if it makes you happy.

At the far right of the Map Window Control Panel are two buttons that open
two more windows, one to build worlds and one to populate them.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  32]



WORLD BUILDING 101

We will now design a world and build it. For this tutorial, any world will do,
so go ahead and be rash in your upcoming decisions.

Click on the Build World button in the Map Window Control Panel to open the
World Design Window.

The World Design Window has a number of sliders and buttons. Three of the
sliders control the world's climate, controlling the average weather variation
average temperature and average moisture. (In SimLife, moisture includes both
humidity and precipitation.)

Set these anywhere you want by clicking and sliding the arrows on each slider.

Next, set the sliders for the amount of rivers and lakes you want and for the
number of mountains you want.

Over on the right are sliders that control how many artifacts will be spread
around the world. In SimLife, artifacts are anything that can appear in the
world that is not plant, animal, land, or water. The four artifacts are:

   * Toxins - poisons that negatively affect the health of organisms;

   * Mutagens - substances that increase the odds of mutation;
      
                                                                [PAGE:  33]


   * Food Sources - this refers to Ultra-Food sources that supply any and all
     food that animals require; and

   * Barriers - barricades that SimLife organisms cannot cross.

Set these four sliders anwhere you want.

Next we'll pick a size for the world. There are four choices, each of which
is best for different experiments. Keep in mind while choosing a world size
that the larger the world, the longer it takes the computer to build it, and
the slower the simulation will run.

Choose the world size you want (I recommend small, but it's your world.)

Now you get to name the new world. Highlight the words below New World Name:
and type in whatever you want.

Now, click on the Make It So button, and the world will be built, layer by
layer, before your very eyes. If a dialog box or requester asks if you want
to save the current world, click No.


LIVE AND LET SIMLIVE

Now we have a world. A barren, desolate, lonely world. Nothing to do, no one
to talk to. Time to get a life - or better yet, a whole lot of it. Click on
the Populate... button in the Map Window.

The Populate Window lets us add plants and animals to the world singly or
in large groups.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  34]


Click or click and hold on the down-arrow button in the Species box. A
submenu of all the available plants and animals - just like the one in the
Dashboard - appears. Slide the cursor until the llama is highlighted,
then either click or release the mouse button.

Now click on the up-arrow in the Number box until you reach 10 or 20.

Click on the Add a Group button.

Click on the On the Land Button

Now click on Make It So. Ten (or however many you wanted) llamas are now alive
and kicking in the new world. Now we have ten lonely llamas.


THE LIFE OF THE PARTY

Let's get this party moving and really put some life into it. Again, open
the Populate Window by clicking on the Populate... button in the Map Window.

Click and hold in the Species box, then slide the cursor to All Plants. Set
the Number box to 25. Click on Add Scattered. Click on On the Land, then
click Make It So. Twenty-five of each plant species will be scattered all
over the world.

Repeat the above process, but for Species, select All Animals.

The world is now filled with life of all sorts. You can see the animals
scurrying around in the Map Window, but let's take a closer look.

Find the Edit Rectangle in the map. Drag it to a part of the world you want
to explore, then double-click in it.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  35]



LOOK CLOSELY

You are now in the Edit Window, ready for a close-up tour of the world.

You can move the Edit Window around the screen by clicking and dragging the
Title Bar. You can resize the window by clicking and draging the Resize Box
in the lower-right corner. You cannot close the Edit Window.

The main section of the window is the Display Area, where you can see varios
plants, animals and artifacts, as well as land and water.

      
                                                                [PAGE:  36]


THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS. SO DOES THE LAND.

Since the world is too large to show in the Edit Window all at once, you
can scroll the window to show different parts of the map.

Depending on your computer, there are a few ways to scroll. Check with
your machine-specific addendum for more information on scrolling with your
computer.

There is a "joystick" for scrolling. Click or click and hold on any of the
arrows to scroll the window in the arrow's direction.

Note: On computers with small monitors the joystick will not be visible. Sorry

In addition, if your Edit Window has Scroll Bars and Arrows, you can use them.
If not, you can move the mouse to any edge or corner of the screen to scroll.

However you do it, scroll around and look the world over.


THE DISTINGUISHED PANEL

Note: as shown in this manual, the Edit Window Control Panel is found on the
left side of the Edit Window. On some computers, it will appear at the top
of the screen, as part of the Dashboard. See your machine-specific addendum 
for details.

Along the left-side of the Edit Window is the Edit Window Control Panel,
filled with buttons and tools. Notice our old friend, the Help button. Click
and hold on it to see a display of what everything does.

At the top of the panel is the clock. It graphically shows the passing of day,
night and the seasons. It also gives the Tick, Day and Year. Ticks are the 
smallest unit of time in SimLife. A tick is the time it takes an animal to
move one step and do one thing. The actual time a tick takes depends on your
computer's speed, the size of the world and the number of plants and animals
currently living.

Below the clock are a lot of buttons that activate the different Edit Window
tools. The name of the active button is displayed in the Dashboard to the left
of the Help button.

Immediately below the clock are three groups of buttons. These let you not 
only choose whether or not to display the simulation information on 
temperature, moisture and altitude, but let you adjust the settings.


MOVING UP IN THE WORLD

Click on the Altitude button. Notice that the land is all shown in one
color/shade/pattern. The altitude data is not shown. Click on it again and the
mountains and valleys come back.

Now click on the up-arrow button to the right of the Altitude button, then
click and/or click and drag the cursor in the Display Area. A mountain
rises from the land.

Click on the down-arrow button to the left of the Altitude button, then click
and hold on the mountain. It settles back into the plains.


A HOT TIME IN THE OLD WORLD TONIGHT

Now click on the Temperature button. A display of the temperature data is
added to the Display Area using colors or shades, depending on your computer.
A key to interpreting the colors/shades can be found in the Map Window Control
Panel, when the multi-level temperature display is on. If you can arrange
your screen so the Map Window Control Panel shows below the Edit Window, it
will make it easier to see the key.

Click on the up-arrow button to the right of the Temperature button, then 
click and/or click and drag the cursor in the Display Area. The temperature
rises.

Click on the down-arrow button to the left of the Temperature button, then
click and hold in the Display Area. The temperature lowers.

The Moisture buttons work the same way.

Turn the temperature display off.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  38]



JUST THE ARTIFACTS, MA'AM

Now look at the four buttons just above the Help button. These let you place
or remove Artifacts.

Click on the Food Source button (the one that looks like a shopping cart).
Now click or click and drag in the Display Area. You've placed Ultra-Food
(a universal, unlimited food source) for your animals. To remove the sources,
just click on them.

The other artifact buttons let you place and remove barriers, toxins and 
mutagens in the same way.


WATER YOU DOING?

Just above the Barriers button is the Water button. Click on the little On/Off
button below it to toggle the display of water on and off. Turning it off
doesn't make the water go away, it just makes it invisible.

Make sure the display of water ins set to On. Click on the Water button, then
click or click and drag the cursor in the display area to make water. If you
click or click and drag on water, it will turn back into land.


THIS IS THE LIFE (BUTTON)

We've saved the most powerful button for last. The Life button does a lot
of different things, all related to adding, removing, displaying and modifying
life.

Note: In any of the steps below, if you find it difficult when asked to click
on animals while they are moving, pause the simulation by clicking on the 
Pause button in the Dashboard.

Click on the little On/Off button below it to toggle the display of life on
and off. Turning life off doesn't make the life go away, it just makes it
invisible.

To choose what you want the Life button to do, click and hold on it. A
submenu of all the button's functions will appear. Then slide the cursor
to your choice and release the mouse button.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  39]



POP-YOU LATE!

The defaul setting for the Life button is Populate, which adds life to the
world. The species to be added can be set in the Dashboard (the Selected
Species).

Go to the Dashboard and select LLucia's Llama as the Selected Species. Then
go back to the Edit Window, click and hold on the Life button, and select
Populate. Now click in the Display Area to add llamas.


I SMITE AND I SMITE NOT

Click and hold the Life button, and select Move. Now click and drag any
living thing to move it to another location.


SEND IN THE CLONES

Click and hold the Life button, and select Clone. Now click and drag any
living thing to another location. Instead of moving the original organism,
Clone makes a duplicate organism and places it where you release the mouse
button.

If you hold down the Option key - or Control key if your keyboard has no
Option key - while cloning, the clone will be mutated in some random way.


HIGHLITE THE LOW LIFE

Click and hold the Life button, and select Highlight. Now click on an animal
to highlight it. Open the Simulation Menu, open the Goodies submenu, and 
select Auto Tracking. Now the Edit Window will automatically scroll to keep 
your highlighted animal showing. The animal will stay highlighted until it
dies or you highlight something else.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  40]



I DON'T CARROT ALL FOR THIS

Click and hold the Life button, and select The Carrot. Now click and hold
somewhere in the Display Area. All the members of the Species you highlighted
will flock to the cursor.


PULL DOWN YOUR GENES

Click and hold the Life button, and select Show Genes. Click on any plant.
The Genome Window with the complete genetic code for the plant will appear.
We'll play more with the Genome Window later. For now, click on Never Mind.

Now, wit the Life button still set to Show Genes, click on an animal. The
Genome Window with the complete genetic code for the animal will appear.
Notice that animals have a more complex genetic code.

Click on Never Mind.


LET'S GET PERSONAL

Click and hold the Life button, and select Show Variables, then click on a
plant. This brings up the Variables Window, which gives the current status
of the plant you clicked on. The Variables are all the information the
simulation has about an organism that isn't in its genetic code, like age
and size.

Click in the Close Box to close the Variables Window. Repeat the process for
an animal.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  41]



LET ME LOOK AT YOU

Click and hold the Life button, and select Show Phenotype, then click on an
animal.

This opens the Phenotype Window for the animal you clicked on, which is sort
of a close-up view of the animal - and sort of isn't.

This picture isn't really what the animal looks like. It's a compilation
picture made out of parts of animals that we are all familiar with, to give
us some idea of how the animal fits into its environment.

From the picture, you should be able to tell what the animal eats, how it
moves, where it lives, and how many young it has at a time.

These compilation pictures are the flash cards used in the Biology Lab for
designing plants and animals.

Click in the Close Box to close the Phenotype Window. Repeat the process for a
plant.


LET'S SPLIT

Click and hold the Life button, and select SPecieate. Now click on any plant
or animal. The Speciate Window opens.

Among other things, you can use this window to change the organism into
another species, or a new species. For complete details, see the Refernce 
section below.

Click on Never Mind to make this window go away.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  42]



A HISTORICAL EVENT

A goodly amount of time has passed since this world was created. And a lot of
things have happened. But what happened when? And what might have happened 
that we didn't notice?

Click and hold on the Census button in the Dashboard, slide the cursor to
History and release the mouse button.

This window lists the world's important events along with the date they
happened. You can use the Older, Newer and Latest buttons to page through
all the events.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  43]



DEATH, WHERE IS THY STING?

All things come to an end. And until you get the hang of building a viable
food chain and ecosystem, you may be tempted to call this game SimDeath 
instead of SimLife.

Tracking down the causes of death can give you insight into problems in the
ecosystem. And to help you investigate the causes of death, we present the
Mortality Window.

Click and hold on the Census button in the Dashboard, slide the cursor to
Mortality, and release the mouse button.

This window graphically and numerically shows how many organisms have died
and what killed them. You can look at mortality data for an individual
organism, or for All Animals or All Plants at once. The data shown goes back
five years.

When you've had enough of digging through death, close the Mortality Window
by clicking in the Close Box.


GOING TO SEED

Let's design a new plant. Click on the Biology Lab button in the Dashboard to
open the Biology Lab.


BIOLOGY LAB AT SELECT/EDIT LEVEL
      
                                                                [PAGE:  44]


The Biology Lab has two levels, the Select Level and the Edit Level. You are
now looking at the Select Level. This is where you can load and save 
organisms individually or in groups, or start new ones.

We're going to make a new plant, so click on the New Plant button.

You are now at the Edit Level of the Biology Lab, ready to work on your new
plant.


A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME

Right now the name for the new plant is New Plant, which isn't very charming
or expressive. Click the Rename button, highlight the words "New Plant," and
type in a new name - how about Rover? - and click Make It So.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  45]



WOW. WHAT A FLASH

Below the name is the composite "flashcard" picture of the plant, as seen
in the Phenotype Window. The plant is made of three pictures. To the left of
each picture are arrows.

You can click on these arrows to cycle through all the pictures. Go ahead and
do some clicking. As you do, notice the text below the pictures - it
describes the plant you are designing.

The top line of text describes the top picture, which defines the plant's
flower: whether or not it makes nectar, and what type of seeds it has.

The middle line of text describes the middle picture, which defines the
plant's structure, its preferred climate and whether it is deciduous or
evergreen.

The bottom line of text describes the bottom picture, which gives the plant's
sprouting needs and tells whether the plant lives on land or water.

So we're on the same track for the next step, click around until your text
and picture match this:

No nectar, fruit seeds

Deciduous temperate shrub

Floating, sprouts in warm dry weather


Once your picture matches, notice the row of buttons below the plant
description. Click on the third button on the left. This button writes the
genetic code for your new plant based on the flash cards you chose.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  46]


That was easy. We designed a plant by making only a few major decisions and
left the details up to the computer. Let's go a step deeper and play directly
with the plant's genetic code to do some fine-tuning.

Roll up your sleeves and read on.


I DREAM OF GENOME

Look again at all the buttons below the text section. Click and hold on the
Help button and look it over for a few seconds.

Most of these buttons are very powerful tools for advanced experiments, so for
now, we'll only deal with one or two.

Click on the Edit Species Prototype Genome button.

You now see the Genemoe Window that defines Rover. All the genetic information
in the text and pictures is here, plus a few other genes.

Let's modify Rover a little. First, we'll give Rover male flowers instead of
both. Click and hold in the little down-arrow button to the right of the word
Gender, slide the cursor to Male, and release the mouse button.

Now, let's let Rover make Nectar, so click on the button next to Nectar.

Now, something big: let's turn Rover into a tree. Click and hold on the down-
arrow button to the right of the words Structure and Floating, slide the
cursor to Tree andrelease the mouse button.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  47]


When it was a floating plant, Rover didn't need to store much water, but
now as a tree, it will need a lot of water storage capability. Click and drag
the arrow on the Water slider about three-quarters of the way to the right.

Note: when you make major changes in the genome, be sure to check over any
related genes. If we didn't adjust the Water Storage gene while making Rover
a tree, they all would have died of thirst before maturity.

That's enough genetic tinkering for now. Click on Make It So to return to
the Biology Lab.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  48]



FLASHBACKS

Now look at the flash cards. The flashcard image automatically updated to
match the changes in the Genemo Window.


TIME OUT!

OK, here's something to remember: we haven't been designing an individual 
plant - we've been designing an entire species. The "Rover" we've been
working on is the prototype for a whole species of Rovers.

As you place new Rovers into the world, they will be based on this prototype,
and vary only slightly. When new Rovers are born, they will be based on
their parents.

OK. Back to the Biology Lab.


THE FINAL TOUCHES

Just three more items to be mentioned and Rover is done. There are three
sliders in the upper-right section of the Biology Lab.

The top slider sets the amount that the Rovers you place in the world will
vary from the prototype. The farther to the right you set the Gene Pool
Diversity slider, the more variation in the genes in all the Rovers-to-be.
The more the variation, the more possibility for evolution. This slider
does not affect Rovers that are born to other Rovers.

The middle slider, Mating Difference, sets how genetically different two
Rovers can be and still produce offspring.

The last slider, %Genes from Father, sets how many of the Rover-offspring's
genes come from each parent. We humans get ours 50/50, but you can set 
Rover anywhere you want.

That's it. Rover's all designed and done... except for the way it looks in
the Edit Window. Now we get to draw some pictures.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  49]



ICON DO IT. CAN YOU?

The icon we draw for Rover won't affect it or its genes in any way. The
only thing the icon does is help us identify it when we see it in its 
environment. You can be as silly or abstract as you want when drawing
icons, as long as you can remember what they are.

A plant needs four icons, one for when it's a seed, one with no leaves, one
with leaves, and one with flowers.


A SEEDY SPOT

First, we'll draw the seed icon. Click on the little icon for seeds, then
click on the Clear button.

Now click on a color. Draw the seed just as you would with any paint program:
click or click and drag on a blank spot to draw, click or click and drag on a
colored spot to erase it. As you draw the icon in the large drawing area, it
appears real-size above.

If you wish, and you have them, use other colors to adorn the seed.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  50]



BRANCHING OUT

CLick on the "No Leaves" icon, then click Clear. This icon represents the
plant when it has branches, but no leaves or flowers.

Draw it however you want (but remember, Rover is a tree). 


LEAF ME ALONE

Now we want to draw the same thing and add leaves. Before changing to the
next icon, go to the Edit Menu at the top of your screen, and select Copy 
Icon. 

Next click on the Leaves icon, then select Paste Icon from the Edit Menu. 
We've got our branches - all we need to add are the leaves.

Go ahead and add leaves.


ROVER IN BLOOM

Choose Copy Icon from the Edit Menu again, select the "Flowers" icon, then
select Paste Icon from the Edit Menu.

Now add your flowers.


THE EASY WAY

For those of us who can't draw worth beans - or are in a hurry - there are a
number of professionally pre-drawn icons. Click and hold on the Icons button
just above Undo to see a submenu of 32 icons to choose from. Just look now -
be careful not to choose one or your personal artwork will be lost.

Each of these icons only shows the one stage with leaves, but if you choose
one it supplies all four icon stages of the plant.

We could have just chosen one of these and saved all the time and trouble
of drawing our Rover, but don't you feel like a better human being for having
done it yourself?
      
                                                                [PAGE:  51]



ROVER'S ALL OVER

Now click on the Return To Edit button.

Notice that Rover is now amongst all the other plants in the Species Display.

Click on the Save button to save all our hard work to disk for future use.
Not only can you use Rover now, but you can load it into any future games or
experiments.

If you have any questions about saving plants, see your machine-specific
addendum.


SPREADING YOUR SEED

Close the Biology Lab by clicking in the Close Box.

Make sure Rover is the Selected Species in the Dashboard.

Go to Edit Window, set the Life Button to Populate and place a few Rovers.
When you place them, they are seeds. As time passes, they grow branches,
then leaves, then bloom. If Rover is too stupid to bloom, it must be a 
blooming idiot.


YOUR REPORT CARD

Now we'll look at one more window. Open the Windows Menu and select 
Evaluation.

The Evaluation Window lets you know how well you're doing at ecosystem 
management by giving you a Score, a Rating, and a Status report. It also 
pictorially shows which ecological niches are currently filled with plants
and animals. You can click on any of the pictures to get an explanation
of what they represent.

SEMI-SORTA-SUMMARY

This concludes Part 2 of the tutorial. We've been through a lot of windows,
features and functions and you should understand enough to figure out
any new ones you run across. Congratulations.

In addition, we've gone through the process of plant design. The process
of animal design is very similar and will be dealt with in detail in the
next section of the tutorial... speaking of which...

The next and final part of this tutorial will be the design, setup and
execution of a complete experiment. Thrills, spills and fun for the whole
family. Don't miss it!
      
                                                                [PAGE:  53]



BUILDING AN EXPERIMENT: SPLATT

Now it's time to design, set up, carry out and evaluate an experiment.

SimLife is very complex and has a massive amount of features. One of the most
powerful features in SimLife is the ability to turn off or eliminate many of
the features for better experiment control.

In any experiment, control is a primary issue. All possible outside 
influences must be eliminated for the experiment to be valid and to really
find out who did what to whom and why.

Now, we'll set up a very simple experiment. We'll turn off and leave out a
number of factors. This gives us complete control over the experiment and
will also make the simulation run faster.


THE SIMLIFE LAB BOOK

A summary of this experiment, along with blanks to fill in your data and write
your conclusions, can be found in the lab book included with this product.
If you don't want to mark up your lab book, you may make a photocopy of it
for your personal use and mark that up. No selling copies of the lab book
in dark alleys to minors while weaing a trenchcoat.


THE GOAL OF THIS EXPERIMENT

The goal of this experiment is to observe evolution (a change in the gene
pool) through natural selection.


THE APPROACH

We will focus on a few genes in particular: Roaming, Turning, Turn Type and
Turn Angle. The Roaming controls how likely an animal is to keep moving even
though it is not necessarily hungry or thirsty. The Turning gene controls
how often the animal turns while moving. The Turn Type and Turn Angle genes
control how the animal moves when it is turning.

We will set up a world where environmental pressures favor survival for
an animal with a high tendency for roaming and turning and see if, after a
number of generations, the animal's gene pool changes to increas these
tendencies.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  54]


For simplicity - and control - the world will have only two species of 
animals - the experimental subjects and the control group. Both species will
be supplied with all the food and water they need.

Environmental pressure to promote roaming and turning will only be applied
to the subject group. And that pressure will be you. You will act as the
predator and use the Smite function of the Life button to kill any of the
subject animals that hold still too long - those that don't roam very often.

No other predators will be allowed into the world where they might cause
different or unknown environmental influences.


THE PLAN OF ATTACK

The steps we'll be taking in setting up the experiment will be:

   1. Design and build the subject animal. 
   2. Duplicate and rename the subject as the control animal.
   3. Design and build the world needed for the experiment.
   4. Modify the climate for optimum control.
   5. Change the laws of physics for optimum time passage.
   6. Populate the world with the subject and control species.
   7. Record the starting genetic data for both populations.
   8. Apply the environmental pressure for a number of generations.
   9. Observe the results, at two points in time.
  10. Analyze the results.


STEP ONE: BUILD-A-BUG

The first thing we need to do is design and build the animal that we will be
hunting down and killing.

We at Maxis believe in the sacredness of all life, both real and artificial.
All life-forms have their place in the ecosystem and the universe. We suggest
you only destroy animals, even electronic ones, for a good cause - like this
tutorial.

When deciding who should live and who should die, keep in mind that some
organisms are, well, let's just say that killing some animals inspires less
guilt than others. Speaking of cockroaches, let's model our experimental
subject after them.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  55]


If you feel personally offended by using cockroaches as test subjects, then
you can always turn off your computer and curl up with a good Franz Kafka 
story. Or, instead of modeling the subjects after cockroaches, base them on
something else... since we're dealing with the Roaming gene, you can make your
critters look like noses and call them the Roamin' Noses. (I was going to use
the Roamin' Noses in this experiment, but i couldn't draw good nose icons.)
Or you could make the animal look like your older brother, your boss, or
anyone or anything else you'd enjoy splatting.


PREPARATION

Before you can continue with this experiment, make sure SimLife is running and
in Experimental Mode.


BIO-MANIPULATION

Click on the Biology Lab button in the Dashboard.

When the Biology Lab opens, click on New Animal.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  56]


Now we name our new test-subject-to-be. Click on the Rename button, highlight
the old name, type in a new one, and click Make It So. I'm naming my new
animal Splatt.

Next, we'll set the three sliders above the icon section. Since we'll be 
dealing with a relatively small population, we'll need as much Gene Pool
Diversity as possible. Set it all the way up.

Set Mating Difference all the way up, and set %Genes from Father to 50%.

We've got some serious gene-splicing to do, so we'll skip the flash cards and
go straight to the Genome Window. Click on the Edit Species Prototype Genome
button.


YOU ANIMAL, YOU

Notice that the Genome Window for an animal is much more complicated than for
a plant. In addition, there are two indicator bars in the lower-right corner,
for Maximum Size and Energy Requirements.

There is no free lunch in SimLife. The more powerful and versatile you make
an animal, the more energy it will need to survive. You can an animal so 
strong and fast and stealthy and dangerous with such great vision that it
would be invincible - but even if it lived in a supermarket it couldn't eat
fast enough to survive.


THE SPLICE OF LIFE

In general, our requirements for this animal aren't very demanding. All we
want it to do is eat and reproduce and roam. It won't have any enemies to
contend with, and it won't have to search for fight for food or water.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  57]



ANIMAL DESIGN SUMMARY

Here I will just mention what each setting should be. See the Reference
section below for a complete description of what each gene does.

   1. Keep the Gender Male or Female; if it's sterile or asexual it won't
      show us very much evolution.
   2. For Movement, just Walking will do.
   3. It will only need one Food Source, but since we're using cockroaches for
      our model, click them all. (Notice that each type of food you add
      increases the animal's energy requirements. For this experiment, it 
      won't matter, but be careful in others.)
   4. Set Share Food and Persist to about 50%.
   5. Set Roaming and Turning to about 25%.
   6. Set Turn Type to Zig-Zag, and Turn Angle to Medium-Low.
   7. There will be nothing to prefer, avoid or ignore, so we'll prefer to
      ignore the avoidance settings.
   8. Set Life span to 50%. (We don't want the older bugs to clutter up our
      ecosystem.)
   9. Set Adult to 25% so they'll mature quickly.
  10. Set Die-off to middle-Age.
  11. On the Features, set Size and Vision to about 25%, and Stealth and
      Weapons to 0.
  12. For Gestation, set Size to 25% (or less), Time to about 5%, %Female to
      50%, and Mutation all the way down.
  13. Set Number Of Children to 4.
  14. For Food (internal food storage), set Max to 50%, Danger to 25%, and
      Action between them.
  15. Set Water the same as Food.
  16. For Health, set Max all the way up, Action at about 50%, and Danger
      at about 25%.

Now click on Make It So to return to the Biology Lab.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  58]



PRETTY PICTURES

The final stage in designing Splatt is making the icons. With plants, there
were four. With animals, there are only two, one for the animal as a child
and oe for the animal as an adult. (there are actually four animal icons:
the other two are flipped images of the first two, so when the animals
move around the Edit Window they don't look like they're going backwards.
These flipped icons are automatically made for your, courtesy of your 
friendly local computer.)

Now is the time to let your artistic talents shine, to express the very soul
of Splatt in a grid of 16 x 16 colored dots. Try to evoke the essence of
Splattness, or just do anything - as long as you will be able to recognize
it in the Edit Window, and are able to distinguish it from any other life-
forms.

Click on the Adult icon, then click Clear. Now draw an icon to represent
Splatt the Roach, or Splatt the Nose, or Splatt the little sister, or
whatever. 

So, maybe it does look more like a rabbit than a bug. I now what it is, and
that's what counts.

Next click on the Child icon, then click Clear. Now draw a portrait of the
insect as a young bug. Make sure it looks different enough from the adult
so you don't stomp on children by mistake during the experiment.

Once you're done with the icons, click on the Return to Edit Level button.

Now click on the Save button. If you need help saving Splatt, see your
machine-specific addendum.

Close the Biology Lab for now by clicking in the Close Box.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  59]



THEY'RE ALIVE!

Look at the Dashboard. Notice that Splatt is now the Selected Species, and 
its icon has been added to the other icons.

Now go to the Edit Window. Click and hold the Life button. Slide the cursor
to Populate and release the mouse button.

Now click or click and drag the cursor in the Edit Window Display Area
to set a bunch of Splatts loose in the world.


FOR USE AT A LATER TIME

This new animal we've created will not automatically appear in the Dashboard
if you start a new game at a later time. If you have saved the animal to disk
you can load it into the game (and Dashboard) by using the Load Species
button in the Biology Lab at the Select Level.


STEP TWO: THE CONTROL SPECIES

Take a few moments to watch your creations scurry about, living and dying;
then it's time to get back to work. Click on the Pause button in the Dashboard
to pause the simulation.

We are now going to make our control species. It will be an exact duplicate
of Splatt except for two things: its name and its icons. We need to give it
another name so the simulation will keep its data separate from Splatt's,
and we need it to look different so we can be sure to apply our environmental
influence only on the subject and not the control.

Double-click on Splatt's icon in the Dashboard. The Biology Lab will open,
with Splatt ready to edit.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  60]


Click on the Return to Select Level button to go to the Select Level of the
Biology Lab.

We now want to make a duplicate of Splatt, so click on the Copy button.

Look at the Dashboard. Notice that there is now a duplicate of Splatt 
pictured just to its right. If it isn't showing, click on the right arrow to
scroll until you see it. This is our copy. Double-click on the copy's icon in
the Dashboard.

Our new species is now showing in the Biology Lab. It has been named Copy of
Species, which is kind of a dumb name, so let's rename it. Click on the
Rename button, type in a new name (I'm using Control), and click Make It So.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  61]



A BUG OF A DIFFERENT COLOR

We need to make our control bugs look different from Splatt, so we need new
icons. You can be as creative as you want here, but I'll be lazy and make 
mine identical, except for the color. My Splatts are black. I'll make
Controls red.

Be sure to change both the adult and child icons.

Once you've changed the icons, click on the Return to Select Level button, 
then save the new species.

Close the Biology Lab.


ON DASHBOARD!

One Last Detail: check the colors assigned to Splatt and Control in the
Dashboard.

Below the icons of each species is a colored rectangle. This is the
color that the animal will appear in the Map Window. (The Map Window
represents such a large area that there's no room for icons, just colored
dots.)

If the default colors for Splatt and Control are aesthetically pleasing to
you and different enough from each other that you can easily tell them
apart, do nothing. If you want to change one or both, click and hold on
the colored rectangles to open a submenu of color choices, then slide
the cursor to the color you want.


STEP THREE: ADVANCED WORLD DESIGN

Now it's time to custom-build the laboratory/world for this experiment.

Open the Map Window bu clicking on the Map Window button in the Dashboard,
then click on the Build World... button to open the World Design Window.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  62]


Adjust your World Design Window, using the settings following below. You can
name it anything you want. I'm using Splatter.

In general, we want our experimental world to be absolutely non-hostile.
We, as the smiters, are going to be the only danger to life in this world.


WORLD DESIGN SUMMARY

Here's a listing of all the settings and why I chose them.

   1. We want the climate to be pleasant and forgiving, so set Regional
      Weather Variation low (about 25%), and the Average Temperature and
      Average Moisture to average (about 50%).
   2. We'll bu customizing the terrain later, so for now, set Rivers and Lakes
      and Mountains all the way down. In any event, we won't want any 
      mountains in this world, because mountains affect the climate and we 
      want our climate to be identical in all parts of the world.
   3. We'll want no Toxins that might interfere with our experiment; set them
      to none.
   4. Absolutely no Mutagens! We want all evolution in this experiment to
      result from natural selection.
   5. We'll be strategically placing Food Sources by hand, so, for now, set
      them to none.
   6. We won't need any Barriers, so set them to none.
   7. Set World Size to Tiny. We won't need much space, and since we'll be
      dealing with a number of generations, we'll want time to pass quickly.
      (The smaller the world, the faster the simulation runs.)

When you've made all the adjustments and named your world, click on the
Make It So button.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  63]



EXTERIOR DECORATING

Our new world is pretty boring, and very barren. Now it's time to put on
some finishing touches.

We want our Splatts and Controls to have unlimited food and water, so let's
ring the world with water, and place lots of food sources around the border.
We'll also want to scatter numerous watering holes and more food sources all
over the interior.

Go to the Edit Window, click on the Water button, and draw a border of water
all the way around the world, then dot the interior of the world with small
ponds. Be careful not to put so many that it makes it hard for the animals to
move around.

Next, click on the Food Source button, and scatter food around the border.
Place a Food Source near each pond.

We now have our world. It would be a shame to lose all your hard work, so
open the File Menu and select Save. See your machine-specific addendum if 
you need more information on saving games.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  64]



STEP FOUR: CLIMATE CONTROL

Click on the Climate Lab button in the Dashboard to open the Climate Lab.

We don't really need to mess around with the climate for this experiment, but
since this is a tutorial, we'll go through the motions so you'll know how to
do it when you need to.

Remember way back when we set the average moisture and average temperature in
the World Design Window? Here you can set the amount that the heat and water
vary around the average we already set. You can also set the amount of 
variation in day length during the year.

Set all three of the sliders around 50% - we don't want to put our little
critters under too much climatic stress, but we don't want to bore them to
death, either.

Each of these three settings lets you select the season at which it peaks.
Set the Temperature Variation peak to Winter by clicking and holding on the
down-arrow button, opening the submenu, sliding the cursor to Winter and 
releasing the mouse button. Why would anyone want to make it hot in the 
winter? Because they can.

Close the Climate Lab.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  65]



STEP FIVE: THE LAWS OF PHYSICS

Next, we need to mess with the Laws of Physics to compress time and remove
other influences and factors that might "taint" the experiment.

Open the Simulation Menu, then open the Technical Submenu and select
Change Physics... to open the Laws of Physics Window.

This is the stuff experimenters' dreams are made of. The control over time 
and energy this window gives you is one of the main incentives for 
experimenting with artificial life (as opposed to non-artificial life). 
Every biologist in the world would love to have this type of power and 
control over experiments. (So would every meglomaniacal lunatic, but that's
another story.)

Basically, what we want to do here is make life as easy as possible for our
bugs, make time pass very quickly and make a few other minor adjustments.

To change any of the settings, click and hold on the down-arrow buttons,
slide the cursor to your new choice, then release the mouse button.

Go ahead and adjust your Laws of Physics Window to match the picture
above, then click on Make It So. The Laws of Physics Window will close.


LET'S GET PHYSICSFUL

Here's a summary of all the settings, with brief reasons why they suit this
experiment. A more complete explanation of what each control does can be
found in the Reference section below.

Set all the Movement Costs, Metabolism Costs and Health Costs to Tiny.
We don't want to drain our critters of any more energy than we have to.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  66]


Since we're supplying the animals with unlimited Food Sources, the Food
Value settings don't really matter. But go ahead and set them all to Huge, 
just for the principle of the thing.

We won't have any plants in this world, so you can set Plant Costs to
anything your heard desires.

In the Simulation Stuff section, set Life span to Short, We want our older
generations to pass on their genes, then nobly die, and not clutter up the
world. (Sometimes science is cruel.)

Set Day Length to 8 Ticks and Year Length to 16 Days to set time moving
at a fast clip. We'll be dealing with a number of generations in this
experiment, and don't want to spend the next 10 years of our lives working
on this stupid tutorial.

Plant Limit doesn't matter, since we'll have no plants. Go wild.

Set Mutation Rate to Zero. We want to see if we can reproduce evolution
through natural selection without the advantages that mutations can give.

Set Animal Limits to 200. We don't want to overcrowd the world.

You can set the Soil and Climate Change slider anywhere you want, as it won't
affect anything in this experiment.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  67]



STEP SIX: POPULATION EXPLOSION

Now we'll set our Splatts and Controls loose in the world, using the
Populate Window.

In order to have evolution through natural selection, without any mutations,
we'll need a good spread of genes in the gene pool. To do this, we'll set
loose some Splatts and Controls, then make some modifications to both species'
Genome Prototypes, and set some more loose.

If it isn't already paused, pause time now by clicking on the Pause button in
the dashboard.


LET THERE BE SPLATT

Open the Map Window by clicking on the Map Window button in the Dashboard.

Click on the Populate... button in the Map Window Control Panel.

Click and hold on to the down-arrow button in the Selected Species box, drag
the cursor to Splatt's icon, then release the mouse button.

Click on Add Scattered, and On the Land.

Click or click and hold on the up-arrow button in the Number box until 40 is
displayed.

Click on Make It So. Fifteen new Splatts will be scattered about the world.


LET THERE BE MORE SPLATT

Double click on the Splatt icon in the Dashboard to open the Biology Lab with
Splatt ready to edit.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  68]


Click on the Edit Species Prototype Genome button.

Now make the changes to the Splatt genome as shown above to give us a good 
spread of turn- and roam-related genes.

Here are the changes to make:

   1. Slide the Roaming and Turning genes up to 75%
   2. Change Turn Type to Random.
   3. Change turn Angle to Medium-High.
 
Click on Make It So, then close the Biology Lab.
 
Click on the Populate... button in the Map Window Control Panel, then 
populate the world with another 15 Splatts, scattered on the land.


TAKE CONTROL PLEASE

Now you will need to repeat the same process you just went through with
Splatts, but with the Controls.

Briefly, here's how to do it:

   1. Open the Populate Window.
   2. Set the Selected Species to Control.
   3. Set the Number to 40.
   4. Click Add Scattered.
   5. Click On the Land.
   6. Click Make It So.
   7. Double-click on the Control icon in the Dashboard.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  69]

   8. Click on the Edit Species Prototype Genome button.
   9. Slide the Roaming and Turning genes up to 75%.
  10. Change Turn Type to Random.
  11. Change Turn Angle to Medium-High.
  12. Click on Make It So.
  13. Close the Biology Lab.
  14. Click on the Populate... button in the Map Window Control Panel.
  15. Click on Make It So.
 
You should now have 40 of each Splatts and Controls with the low settings for
turns and roaming, and 40 of each with the higher settings.
 

BREAK TIME

Before going on with the experiment, we need to take a time out and get 
familiar with a few more SimLife features. First we'll talk a quick tour of
the many Census Windows, then we'll think about how to record out data, then
we'll do an in-depth personal interview with the Gene Pool Window. 
 
Now would be a great time to save the experiment to disk. Open the File Menu
and select Save Game. Information on saving games with your computer can be
found in the computer specific addendum.


TIME OUT 1: TAKING THE CENSUS
 
We will now take a few moments to explore the Census Windows, where you can
get massive amounts of data about the life and times of your world. These
windows show the status and results of all games and experiments.
 
Click on the Pause button in the Dashboard and let the simulation run for 10
or 20 seconds, then click Pause again. This will give the Census Windows a 
chance to update and analyze the genes of your new population.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  70]


To open any of the Census Windows, click and hold on the Census Window button
in the Dashboard to reveal a submenu, then slide the cursor to the window you
want to open and release the mouse button. For now, open the Graphs Window.

In the upper-right corner of the window are up and down arrow buttons that let
you cycle through all the Census Windows. Go ahead and click on one of the 
arrows a few times, looking briefly at each window. When you get back to the
Graphs Window, stop.
 
A complete description of each and every button and control of each and every
Census Window can be found in the Reference section below.
 
 
TIME OUT 2: RECORDING DATA
 
In this experiment and in any SimLife games or experiments, you will probably
want to sketch copies of the Census Windows into your beloved and trusty lab
notebook. If you're not already following and recording this experiment in the
provided SimLife Lab Book (or a copy of it), you may want to start now.
 
In the back of the Lab Book, we have provided a full complement of data
sheets with blank windows for you to copy, fill in and include in any
write-ups of SimLife experiments.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  71]


If you don't like lab books, you can write up and record your experiments in
any word processor.
 
If you have a way to take screenshots of your computer screen and print them 
out and tape them into a lab book (or place the screenshot files directly into
word processor documents), you'll find it very useful. (You may have better 
luck printing the data if you run SimLife in black and white before taking 
screenshots.)
 
Note: Some versions of SimLife, depending on the computer, have
built-in facilities for capturing windows to a clipboard or disk. See
your machine-specific addendum for details.
 
 
TIME OUT 3: THE GENE POOL WINDOW
 
This window is crucial to understanding the results of our experiment. A 
complete explanation of this window can be found in the Reference section
below, but we'll spend a little time here covering the basics.
 
Open the Gene Pool Window by clicking and holding on the Census Window button
in the Dashboard, sliding the cursor to the words Gene Pool and releasing the
mouse button.
 
This window shows the combination of all the genes in the population. At the
top-left corner of the window is the Population Box, which shows the total
population for the Local Species. The Local Species is selected just below the
      
                                                                [PAGE:  72]

Population Box. Click and hold on the down-arrow button to see a pop-up menu
of all icons for all plants and animals. (Notice that you can also choose All
Plants or All Animals and see all their genes at once.)
 
To choose a Local Species, slide the cursor to the icon you want, then release
the mouse button. For now, select Splatt.
 
Somewhere around there is a yes/no button for using (or not) color. Don't 
worry about it for now. Worry about it later.
 

BE DISCRETE
 
Below the Local Species Box is the display area for Discrete Genes, the genes
that are set in the Genome Window with buttons.

There are too many of these genes to show in the window at one time, but you
can see all of these genes a few (one group) at a time. To change the group,
click and hold on the Group Select down-arrow button, slide the cursor to the
group you want, then release the mouse button.
 
The checkmark(s) on the left of the discrete gene bar graphs indicate the 
setting(s) of the species Prototype.
 
Take some time and, in turn, select each group and see the results.
 
 
BE INDISCRETE
 
The whole right side of the Gene Pool Window displays the Continous Genes-those
that are set with sliders in the Genome Window.

This section can display the data in two ways: by using colors, or by using
black bar graphs. While a little confusing at first, once you get the hang of
the color display, it gives a lot of information quickly. Besides, it looks
cool.
 
But alas, for now, click on the button over on the left that sets Use Colors
to No.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  73]


At the top of this part of the window is a key to help you interpret the data.
It changes depending on your choice of color or black and white.
 
Each of the rectangles (made up of small slices) corresponds to a gene slider
in the Genome Window. For one animal, and arrow or a line can mark the value
for the gene. But when you need to see the gene values for a larger number of
animals, it's a little trickier.
 
We use little bar graphs (or color graphs). Wherever there is a bar, at least
one of the animals has that value for the gene. The height of the bar (or the
shade of the color) indicates how many of the population have that value.
 
Only nine continuous genes can be shown at once. You can choose which genes to
display by... I bet you can guess how to do it. I have faith in you.
 
If you are truly daring, switch back to Use Colors (if you have a color 
monitor), study the key and see if it makes sense to you.
 
Now it's time to go back to the experiment. Close the Gene Pool Window by
clicking in the Close Box.     .

                               |This doc was typed by *RYGAR*  Don't steal it
STEP SEVEN: TAKE STARTING DATA |and say u did it! Thanks! Fuckings to Sorehead
                               |
Time to take our starting data. You can use a piece of paper, your own lab
book, or the official SimLife Lab Book (or a copy of it).
 
Open the Technical submenu in the Simulation Menu and select Set Time to 0 so
your experiment starts at Tick 0, Day 0 and Year 0. Be sure to record the time
along with your other data.
 
Next, open the Gene Pool Window. Select Splatt as the local species. Chances
are that you now have less than 30 of each of Splatts and Controls because
some died during the 10 seconds that the game was unpaused to let the Census
      
                                                                [PAGE:  74]

Windows update. Unless you have less than 20 of each, don't worry about it. If
you have less than 20, go to the Edit Window and use the Populate mode of the
Life Tool to add more Splatts and/or Controls. 
 
On paper or in the Lab Book, record the following discrete gene information:
 
   1. Population
   2. Turn Angle
   3. Turn Type

Record the same information for Control.
 
Now record the information for the following continuous genes:
 
   1. Roaming
   2. Turning
 
Record the same information for Control.
 
Here's my data:    Tick:        0
   
                   Day:         0
 
                   Year:        0
 
SPLATT                                         CONTROL
 
Population:    56                              Population:     59
 
Once the data is recorded, you're ready to start stomping bugs.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  75]



STEP EIGHT: SPLATT THEM BUGS

Time to kill bugs.
 
 
BUT WHAT'S MY MOTIVATION?
 
The idea here is to be a predator. You like to kill and eat Splatts. You find
it easier to catch the ones that:
 
1. Stay still too long, or
2. Go in a straight line for a long while. 
 
You won't smite any of the Control species because you are a predator that
wants its experiment to work.
 
You won't kill of so many that you deplete the population. 
 
As you begin smiting, depending on the speed of your computer, it might be far
too easy or far too difficult to catch the Splatts. Adjust the speed of the 
game in the Speed submenu of the Simulation Menu to make time move fairly
quickly and to give yourself a little challenge.
 
One more thing: you may want to turn of the Play Animal Sounds in the Goodies
submenu of the Simulation Menu if others are listening, but it is helpful to
have the aural feedback whenever there is a birth, death or mating.
 
 
LET THE SMITING BEGIN
 
Click on the Pause button in the Dashboard to start the clock.
 
Now, smite the wee bugs, and remember:
 
   * Go for the ones that stay in one place too long, and that go in a 
     straight line for a while.
 
   * Avoid smiting the Controls.
 
   * Speed up or slow down the simulation speed as needed.
 
 
PROGRESS REPORT
 
When your population starts to dwindle a little, take some time off (stop
smiting, but leave the simulation running) and look through the various
Census Windows while the Splatt population builds back up.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  76]


 
WHAT CAN GO WRONG AND HOW TO FIX IT
 
It's possible that there are so many water holes or food sources that some 
creatures are trapped and can't move, as opposed to not wanting to move. If
so, lower the amount of water holes and food sources.
 
It's possible that your population could die out, or all the females or males
will kick. Go ahead and add some new ones, Ideally this shouldn't happen, and
it will set you back a little by diluting the gene pool. 
 
If the Controls start crowding out the Splatts and using up most of the 
alotted Animal Limit (remember out settings in the Laws of Physics Window?),
use the Populate Window to kill off some Controls and give the Splatts a 
chance.
 
If you have a slow machine, the bugs may be too easy to catch and you'll kill
too many. Try increasing the simulation speed. You can also try holding the
cursor over the bug you want to smite and counting to three slowly before
pulling the trigger.
 
Check the Mortality Window-one of the Census Windows-for causes of death. If
many of them die from the lack of food or water, add more food and water to
the world.
 
 
STEP NINE: TAKING DATA
 
After at least five or six generations, pause the simulation, and take down 
the Tick, Day, Year and Population as well as the same genetic information you
at Time 0.
 
Smite away for many more generations.
  
When you've done all the smiting you can stand, pause the simulation and take
a complete final set of data for both species.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  77]



STEP TEN: ANALYSIS
 
This is perhaps the most important part of any experiment. Look over your
before, after, and in-between data. And think about it and the following
questions.
 
What does it mean?
Was there evolution?
Did the gene pool change?
Was it by natural selection?
Why or why not?
What went wrong?
What went right?
If you had to do it over again (and you do), would you do it differently?
What would you change?
 
Write a report with all the answers to all those questions and have it on my
desk by 8:00 AM tomorrow morning.
 
 
EXPERIMENT SUMMARY
 
Depending on quite a number of factors, your Splatt experiment may or may not
have demonstrated evolution in action. Whatever happened, don't be 
disappointed. We usually learn more when things go wrong than when they go
right.
 
Splatt was a very short, simple experiment, and now that you've been dragged
through it, you should have a good idea of the power and flexibility of
SimLife.
 
Happy simulating.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  78]


 
TUTORIAL SUMMARY
 
Well that's quite enough of a tutorial if you ask me. If you made it all the 
way through, be proud.
 
You've been introduced to a lot of information in this tutorial, and it only
hinted at the possibilities of this program. Only by playing around, coming
up with your own ideas and testing them will you fully master SimLife.
 
Go. Play. Experiment. The reference section is here if and when you need it.
There's another manual section with suggested experiments. There is also a 
bibliography at the end of this manual to point you to some great books about
life, artificial life, biology, evolution, genetics, and other related 
subjects.

INTRODUCTION/THE BASICS
 

DOWN-ARROW (TRIANGLE) BUTTONS
 
Whenever you see a button with a down-arrow, or a triangle pointing down, it
means you can click and hold on this button to open a dropdown menu of
choices.
 

SIMLIFE CONVENTIONS AND TERMINOLOGY
 
Clicking quickly on any down-arrow button will automatically reselect the
last selection without opening the drop-down menu.
 
 
OPTION KEY OR CONTROL KEY
 
The Option key, if you have one, is used for a number of shortcuts in SimLife.
If you don't have one, use the Control key for the following shortcuts:
 
 
IN THE DASHBOARD
 
Option-click on the Animal or Plant display On/Off buttons to turn the display
of all animals or plants on or off. This is handy if you want to see, for
instance, just one animal: turn them all off at once, then turn the one you
want back on.
 
Option-click on a color in the color submenu under any of the icons to turn
all the plants or animals to that color. Use this if you want one animal to 
stand out in the crowd: turn them all to a single color, then turn the one 
you want to a different color.
 
 
IN THE MAP WINDOW CONTROL PANEL
 
Option-click on the Populate... button to automatically populate the world
with a random assortment of plants and animals.
 
 
SPECIES NAMING SYSTEM
 
You can name species anything you want, up to 15 characters. Each species also
has a version number attached to its name. (The version number is displayed in
the Dashboard when the species is the Selected Species.)
       
                                                                [PAGE:  81]


As these species split into new species, the new species will become Version
2, Version 3, and so on. The name will remain the same until and unless you
change it.
 
 
INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM NAMING SYSTEM
 
Individual organisms have two-part names: their species name and a number. The
numbers are given to individuals in the order they're born and continue to 
increase during the duration of game. There are no "go-backs" to reuse the
numbers of organisms that die. The numbers start at 0 (zero). The biggest
number that can be used in an organism's name is 
200000000000000000000000000000000-1, or 4,294,967,296. If all numbers are 
used, they start over again at 0.
 
 
TERMINOLOGY


SELECTED SPECIES
 
Within most windows, only one species will be "active" at a time. And when
playing SimLife, you usually play with one species at a time, checking it out
in one window, spreading it in another, and modifying it in yet another.

Reselecting the species each time you jump to another window would be a 
hassle, so in most windows, when you select a species, it becomes the default
or Selected Species for most other windows. The Selected Species stays
selected until you pick another one.
 
 
LOCAL SPECIES
 
Selecting a species in some windows does not make that species the "official"
Selected Species. The lucky plant or animal you choose in these windows 
becomes the center of attention for these windows or parts of windows only-
they are local stars. Since we need to call the something, these are called
the Local Species.
 
Choosing or changing the Local Species in these windows does not change the
Selected Species or Local Species in the other windows.
      
                                                                [PAGE:  82]

 
 
PROTOTYPE GENOME
 
Each species in SimLife has a Prototype Genome. This is the genetic starting
point for a species: the baseline from which evolution can be measured. 
Through evolution, individuals will vary from the Prototype Genome. Over time,
individuals may vary so much from the prototype that they would no longer be
able to successfully mate with it, and by definition become another species.
 
 
ABOUT LIFE IN SIMLIFE
 

LOOKS OF LIFE
 
As you play SimLife, the different plants and animals will visually appear in
a few different ways. None of these ways truly and accurately shows the way
these organisms look. 
 
These electronic organisms exist as ones and zeros-energy states in 
transistor switches in the memory chips of your computer. Assuming that most
of the beings that play SimLife are human, and that none of the humans we know
can see energy states in transistor switches, we figured we'd better find some
way to visually present SimLife-forms in a way that humans can see and  
understand.
 
One way they appear is as a series of three "flash-cards" as seen in the
Biology Lab and Phenotype Window. These flash card pictures were chosen and
drawn to express the organisms' physical and behavioral traits in familiar
terms. you may not know what the organism looks like, but by looking at 
combinations of familiar earth plants and animals, you will know how it fits
into its world.

Another way the organisms appear is as icons in the Edit Window. These icons 
are pretty small (16 by 16 pixels) and can't be very fancy. Their main purpose
is to help you distinguish one organism from another (and to look pretty).
 
The last way the organisms appear is as small squares or dots (sometimes a
single pixel) in the Map Window. When looking at this window, you can tell
that organisms are there and that they're moving (if they are).
       
                                                                [PAGE:  83]


 
PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE
 
For the purposes of playing SimLife, we define life as anything that exhibits
lifelike behavior, including: adaptive behavior, self-replication and the
ability to extract order from the environment.
 
SimLife-forms easily meet this definition, and more. They metabolize energy
from your wall socket. They require the proper environment-the SimLife
program-to survive. They react to stimuli in the environment. They evolve.
 
In a way, they are like viruses and need a host-the computer-to live in and 
with.
 
 
SIMLIFE ON DIFFERENT COMPUTERS
 
We did our best to keep different SimLife versions as close to each other as
possible while staying true to the interface conventions of each type of
computer.
 
All the main features and functions are the same in all versions, but some
things have been moved around. The main places where differences are found are
in the Dashboard, the Edit Window Control Panel, and the Map Window Control
Panel. Check with your machine-specific addendum for details.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  84]

Populate... open the Populate Window. 
 
 
BUILD WORLD...
 
Build World... opens the World Design Window.
 
 
LAYERS
 
This submenu lets you easily turn on and off many of the layers of data that
can be displayed in the Edit and Map Windows. This only affects the display of
these layers, and in no way changes or deletes the actual data from the
simulation.
 
 
HIDE ALL LAYERS
 
Hide All Layers turns off the display of all data layers.
 
 
SHOW ALL LAYERS
 
Show All Layers turns on the display of all data layers.
 
 
HIDE ALL ANIMALS
 
Hide All Animals turns off the display of all animals.
 
 
SHOW ALL ANIMALS
 
Show All Animals turns on the display of all animals

SHOW PLAGUE/STD PINK (AS "P)
 
Show Plague/STD Pink (as "P"), when active, turns the display of diseased 
animals in the Map Window pink on color monitors, and into the letter "P" on
monochrome monitors, so you can easily track the spread of disease through the
ecosystem. 
 
 
DIFFICULTY
 
This submenu lets you adjust a number of factors that affect ease of play. All
these adjustments can be seen in the Laws of Physics Window.
 
Typical changes that affect ease of play are length of day, higher or lower
energy value for food, higher or lower energy loss for toxins and injuries,
higher or lower health costs and movement costs. 
 
 
BEGINNER 
 
Beginner is the easiest setting.
 
 
NOVICE 
 
Novice gives you a little bit of a challenge. Barely.
 
 
AVERAGE
 
Average is the difficulty level that provides a good challenge without taxing
your innermost brain reserves.
 

ADVANCED
 
Advanced requires a lot of thinking, but not complete mastery of all the ins
and outs of the simulation.
 
 
EXPERT
 
Expert requires complete knowledge of everything to do with the simulation and
life and evolution and everything else. And a lot of luck.
 
 
MODIFIED
 
Modified means you've gone into the Laws of Physics Window and changed 
something so it is no longer in any of the preset difficulty levels. To 
return to a preset setting, choose any of the above choices.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  90]


You can't choose Modified from this menu. It will be ghosted unless you make
changes in the Laws of Physics Window, in which case Modified will be black
with a checkmark beside it.
 
 
TECHNICAL
 
This submenu gives you access to a number of advanced simulation 
manipulation functions.
 
 
SET RANDOM SEED...
 
Set Random Seed... opens a dialog box or requester that lets you modify the
seed number from which random numbers are generated. Random numbers are used
in a number of places, most notably in the world building.
 
You cannot set the seed to zero.
 
One use of changing the random seed is to recreate worlds without taking up 
all the disk space that's needed when saving a complete game.
 
Here's how to do it:
 
   * Enter a number and write it down.

   * Open the World Design Window, write down all your settings and
     build a world.
 
   * If you like the world you get, you recreate it at any time with the
     random seed and World Design settings.
 
   * If you don't like it, recycle the paper you wrote the seed down on.
 
People who use this method of returning to particular ecosystems receive a
free membership in the Save The Seed Not The World Club. Details on this club
might be found in some cereal box, but I'm not sure.
 
 
CHANGE PHYSICS...
 
Change Physics... opens a dialog box or requester that lets you modify the

of play, or let you experiment with worlds that are very different from ours.
 
When you make a change in this window, the Difficulty setting is set to
Modified.
 
 
LOCATE AN INDIVIDUAL...

Locate An Individual... opens a dialog box or requester that lets you locate
specific plants or animals in your ecosystem.
 
 
WORLD BUILDING OPTIONS...

World Building Options... opens a dialog box or requester that lets you modify
the way SimLife builds new worlds.
 
 
RECORD ALL STATISTICS
 
Record All Statistics... toggles between the simulation saving statistics for 
every possible graph and saving all but the "percentage" graphs. When you
sacrifice the information in the "percentage" graphs, you gain simulation
speed and use less memory.
 
 
SET TIME TO 0
 
Set Time to 0 resets the Tick, Day and Year to zero. Use this item to reset 
the clock when you are ready to begin an experiment.
 
 
RUN CONTROL...
 
Selecting Run Control... opens a dialog box or requester that lets you tell
the simulation speed to pause after a certain amount of time and wait for you.
 
You can set it to pause after any amount of days or years, depending on your
experiment, but the most useful is 50 years. All the graphing, history and
census data is only kept in memory for 50 years: if you stop the simulation
every 50 years and save it to disk (each time under a different name), you can
get continuous data and graphs for the whole experiment.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  92]



DATA LOGGING...
 
Data Logging..., when active, continually saves simulation data to a disk 
file. When you select this item, it will open a dialog box or requester and 
let you choose a name and location for this file.
 
The data log file is in a standard ASCII, tab-delimited format and can be 
loaded into a number of spreadsheets or databases for charting, graphing and
statistical analysis. This is an advanced feature for people who really love
to play with spreadsheets and charts and graphs. The format for the data file
can be found in your machine-specific addendum.
 
Warning: The data log file can get very big and will fill your drive
if you're not careful.
 
 
AUTOSPECIATE
 
When AutoSpeciate is selected, organisms that diverge so much from their 
Prototype Genome that they could not successfully mate with the prototype will
automatically be classified as a new species.
 
The new species version will be changed, but it will retain the same icon and
name until and unless you change it.
 
 
RECONVERGE SPECIES
 
Reconverge Species recombines multiple species into a single species. If you
have AutoSpeciate activated, you can end up with a large number of very
similar species. Reconverge Species cleans up the clutter, combining a number
of almost identical species into one or a few species.
 
This adds genetic diversity to older, existing species, and makes more room in
the ecosystem for new species.
 
Here's how it works:
 
   1. The total population of each existing species is examined, and all the
      genes are combined and averaged.
   2. The species prototype is changed to match the average genotype.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  93]

   3. Starting with the newest species, each species prototype is compared to
      the prototype of every other (newer) species.
   4. If, when the comparison is made, the two prototypes are able to 
      successfully mate, the popolations are combined into one species-into
      the first of the species to exist.
       
                                                                [PAGE:  94]

DISASTERS MENU
 
This menu lets you activate a number of disasters that will test the stability
and resilience of your ecosystems, as well as show the dire consequences these
disasters can produce.
 
Disasters that are currently in progress are indicated by a checkmark to their
left. All disasters that you activate stay active until you select them again
in the menu to terminate them.
 
Disasters will occur randomly in games unless No AutoDisasters is selected.
Random disasters will turn themselves off after a while. As disasters turn 
off, they take a few simulation cycles to finish up and go away, so they don't
cause worse problems by stopping abruptly (like beaching fish after a flood).
Random disasters are those that that occur as part of a scenario that can't be
turned off. They'll stop when they're good and ready. The lenght of and 
destruction caused by disasters depends on the difficulty setting in the 
Simulation Menu.
 
 
PLAGUE
 
Plague releases a deadly disease into the ecosystem. Plagues are passed from
animal to animal. When an infected animal is right next to an uninfected 
animal, there is a 10% chance of the plague being passed on.
 
 
STD 
 
STD releases a sexually transmitted disease into the ecosystem. STDs are 
passed when animals mate.
 
 
HEAT WAVE
 
Heat Wave causes the temperature all over the ecosystem to increase.
 
 
COLD WAVE
 
Cold Wave causes the temperature all over the ecosystem to decrease.
 
 
FLOOD
 
Flood causes a flood to occur.
 
        
                                                                [PAGE:  97]


DROUGHT
 
Drought causes a drought to occur.


FIRE 
 
Fire starts a fire in the ecosystem, but only if there are plants.
 
 
COMET
 
Comet causes a large, destructive comet to impact somewhere in the ecosystem.
 
 
TELEPORT
 
Teleport causes many of the plants and animals to be randomly redistributed
around the ecosystem.
 

CIVILIZATION
 
Civilization allows an invasion of our pristine ecosystem by land developers.
Land developers are members of some strange industrial species that bulldozes
the land and builds houses. (Humans. Can't take them anywhere.)
 
 
NO AUTO-DISASTERS
 
No Auto-Disasters eliminates random disasters from occuring, but won't stop 
disasters that occur in scenarios, or disasters you activate yourself. 
Selecting No Auto-Disasters after a disaster has begun will not stop it or
make it end sooner.
        
                                                                [PAGE:  98]



WINDOWS
 
SimLife has a lot of windows. More windows than you can shake a stick at (or
throw a stone through). You don't have to use all of them all of the time, so
don't panic. They're all there for a reason, and will be more and more useful
as you become more familiar with SimLife. Here is an explanation of each and
every window, each and every button, slider and feature in each window, and an
explanation of what they all do and why you'll want to do it.
 
 
DASHBOARD
 
The Dashboard is a row of buttons that gives you easy control over plant and
animal display, access to all the other windows and a simulation pause button.

On the Macintosh, the Dashboard is a separate small window at the bottom of 
the screen, and will be displayed on top of any other window on the screen,
with the exception of dialog boxes or requesters that wait for an "OK," 
"Never Mind," or "Make It So" before you can do anything else.
 
On DOS and Windows computersm the Dashboard is found at the top of the screen,
and is a control bar, not a separate window. Also, on these machines, the Edit
Window Control Panel and the Map Window Control Panel (one at a time) are 
displayed as part of the Dashboard. Here's how the Dashboard looks on a DOS or
Windows-based computer while combined with the Edit Window Control Panel. For
more details and for other computers, check your machine-specific addendum.
        
                                                                [PAGE:  99]



TITLE BAR (MAC VERSION ONLY)
 
At the top of the Dashboard is the Title Bar. While badly named (since it
contains no title), it is still useful.

You can click and drag the Title Bar to move the Dashboard around the screen.

On the left side of the Title Bar is the Close Button. Clicking on the Close
Button will make the Dashboard go away. You can bring it back by selecting
Dashboard in the Windows menu.
 
 
ORGANISM DISPLAY CONTROLS
 
Below the Title Bar and on the left are the controls for displaying (or not
displaying) different plants and animals.
 
The "A" and "P" buttons choose between dealing with animals and plants 
respectively.
 
The animals or plants are displayed in a row. These are the icons that 
represent the organisms in the Edit Window. Only 12 show at a time. You can
use the left and right arrows to scroll through all possible organisms.
 
If you click on the picture or icon of any organism, it is highlighted and
becomes the Selected Species. The name and type (plant or animal) of the 
organism appears in the center section of the Dashboard. The Selected Species
becomes the default choice for use in most windows. For example, if you 
clicked on the Rose, then went to the Edit Window, the Rose would be the 
default organism to use with the Populate tool. Then, if you went to the 
Biology Lab, the Rose would be the default organism to genetically modify.

If you double-click on any organism's icon, the Biology Lab will open with 
that organism ready for dissection.
 
Right below the picture of the organism is a colored rectangle. This shows the
color of the dot that the organism is represented by in the Map Window.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 100]


To change the color, click and hold on the rectangle to reveal a menu of color
choices, slide the pointer to the color you want, then release the mouse 
button.
 
If you hold down the Option Key (or Control key if your keyboard has no 
Option key) while selecting a color for a plant, then that color will be 
selected for all the plants. If you hold down the Option key (or Control Key)
while selecting a color for an animal, then that color will be selected for
all the animals.
 
Below the color rectangles are the display On/Off buttons for each organism.
Clicking them toggles their display on and off. Turning them off does not 
remove them from the simulation, just from view.
 
If you hold down the Option Key (or Control key if your keyboard has no 
Option key) while turning a plant on or off, all the plants will be turned
on or off. If you hold down the Option key (or Control key) while turning 
an animal on or off, all the animals will be turned on or off.
 
 
SELECTED SPECIES SECTION

The middle of the Dashboard displays and selects the Selected Species, which
is the default organism to be used or manipulated in any of the windows.
 
The display shows three pieces of information: whether the Selected Species is
a plant or an animal, the name of the Selected Species, and the version number
of the Selected Species.
 
The Selected Species can be selected in two ways: click on its icon in the
Organism Display Section to the left, or click and hold on the Select button
(the one with the down-arrow) to reveal a menu of all possible organisms, then
slide the pointer to the one you want and release the mouse button. 
       
                                                                [PAGE: 101]

 
 
WINDOW BUTTONS 
 
There are five buttons that open or activate different windows:
 
The Edit button opens or activates the Edit Window.
 
The Map button opens or activates the Map Window.
 
The Biology button opens or activates the Biology Lab.  
 
The Climate button opens or activates the Climate Lab.                 [RYGAR]
 
The Census button opens a submenu (notice the down-arrow) that lets you open
or activate any of the six Census Windows. Each of these windows will be 
described in detail below.
 
 
PAUSE BUTTON

The Pause button stops time in the simulation. Click on the Pause button again
to resume at the previous speed.
 
If you wish an experiment to proceed at a very slow, controlled pace, pause 
the simulation, the hold down the Option key (or Control key) and click on the
pause button. Time will move forward in a single step of one Tick (one 
simulation cycle) for each time you click.
 
 
EDIT WINDOW TOOL INDICATOR
 
The Dashboard also contains an indicator that tells which tool is active in 
the Edit Window. 
 
 
HELP BUTTON 
 
Many windows in SimLife, especially those with many buttons, have a Help
button to give you a quick on-screen reminder of what everything does. Click
and hold on the Help button to get help.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 102]



OTHER BUTTONS 
 
On some computers there may be a few other buttons in or near the dashboard,
such as Populate... and Build World... which are duplicated from the Map
Window Control Panel. See your machine-specific addendum for details.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 103]



NEW GAME WINDOW

The New Game Window lets you select any of the nine scenarios, or start a new
game in Experimental Mode. It opens when you first start SimLife and when you
select New from the File Menu.

From this window you can start the on-screen tutorial, the scenarios, or 
Experimental Mode.
 
The six included scenarios deal with ecosystems and evolution. When you click
on a scenario name, it will become highlighted and a brief description of its
goals will appear in the upper-right corner of the window.
 
When you choose Experimental Mode, you are free to create your own scenarios
and experiments.
 
Once you have highlighted the Tutorial, Experimental Mode, or the scenario you
want to play, click on the Play Scenario button.
 
When you first start SimLife, you must select either a scenario or 
Experimental mode. When you first load the game the Never Mind button will not
be available. If you open the New Game Window at a later time, you will have 
the opportunity to leave this window without selecting a scenario by clicking
on Never Mind.
 
The YES/NO button lets you play any scenario in a world of your own design
instead of the default world. First, build or load that world, then click this
button to say NO, then highlight the scenario and click Play Scenario.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 104]



EDIT WINDOW
 
The Edit Window is a close-up view of the world. Here you can modify the 
terrain and the microclimate, populate the world with plants and animals,
and manipulate the environment.
 
It can be opened or activated by selecting Edit Window in the Windows Menu or
by clicking on the Edit Window button in the Dashboard.
 
Note: on some computers, the Edit Window Control Panel is found at the
top of the screen, integrated with the Dashboard. See your 
machine-specific addendum for details.
 
 
EDIT WINDOW TITLE BAR
 
The Edit Window Title Bar displays the name of the current scenario or game.
The Edit Window can be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the
Title Bar.
 
Clicking on the Grow Box on the right side of the Title Bar expands the window
to fill the screen. Clicking on it again shrinks it to its previous size.
Depending on your computer, you may or may not be able to close the Edit
Window while SimLife is running.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 105]


 
THE DISPLAY AREA
 
The biggest section of the Edit Window is the display of the world. The world
is too big to be shown in its entirety in this window at one time, so there
are Scroll Bars, Scroll Arrows and Scroll Boxes to help you navigate to any
place in the world.
 
On some computers there is a scrolling "joystick" in the lower-left corner of
the window. Clicking and clicking and holding on any of the arrows will scroll
the Display Area over the world in the direction that the arrow points. 
Clicking on the blank space in the middle where there is no arrow doesn't do
anything, but you can click there if it makes you happy.
 
You can resize the Edit Window by clicking and dragging the Size Box in the 
lower-right corner of the window.
 
 
THINGS IN THE DISPLAY AREA
 
In the Diplay Area, you will see: Land (in 16 levels of altitude), Water, 
Plants, Animals and Artifacts.
 
Artifacts are special items you can place in the ecosystem such as barriers,
Ultra-Food food sources, toxins and mutagens. 
 
 
DRAWING ORDER 
 
Often more than one "thing" will occupy a place at a time even though only one
can be seen at a time. Things are drawn on the screen in the order below, from
top to bottom:
 
   1. Temperature or Moisture Layers (only when turned on)
   2. Animals
   3. Plants
   4. Artifacts
   5. Water
   6. Altitude
 
Turning off different layers in either the Edit Window Control Panel or the
Simulation Menu can help clear the clutter.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 106]



THE EDIT WINDOW CONTROL PANEL
 
This control panel graphically displays the passage of time, controls what
data is shown in the Display Area, and provides all the tools you will need to
modify the land and environment.
 
As shown here, it is a vertical panel on the left side of the Edit Window. On
some computers it is a horizontal panel at the top of the screen, integrated
with the Dashboard.
 
An indicator that tells which tool is currently active in the Edit Window can
be found in the Dashboard.
        
                                                                [PAGE: 107]


 
TIME DISPLAY
 
This display shows the passage of time. The sun and moon cycle showing day and
night. At the peak of each lunar circle, and icon depicting the current season
is displayed.

Below the sun and moon is a digital clock that displays the Tick, Day and 
Year.
 
A tick is the amount of time it takes your computer to completely calculate 
one simulation cycle. The actual (real-time) duration of a tick varies with 
the speed of your computer.

The number of ticks per day and days per year varies with the different 
scenarios, and can be customized for different experiments.
 
Each year is divided up into four equally lengthed seasons: summer, fall, 
winter and spring.
 
 
TEMPERATURE TOOL
 
The Temperature tool controls the display of temperature data in the Edit
Window and lets you modify the local temperature.
 
To toggle the display of the temperature layer in the Edit Window on and off,
click anywhere on the button. The words "on" or "off" will appear below the
temperature icon, indicating... well, you know.
 
The temperature is displayed as colored or shaded squares. A color key to
help you interpret the temperature can be found in the Map Window Control 
Panel when the temperature display is active in the Map Window.
 
Turning off the temperature display does not affect the actual temperature in
the simulation, only whether or not it is shown in the Edit Window.
 
To raise or lower the temperature in a specific area of the ecosystem, click
on the up or down arrows on either side of the temperature icon, then click,
       
                                                                [PAGE: 108]

click and hold, or click and drag in the display area. After you have adjusted
the temperature up or down, it will still vary with the seasons.
 
If you want to raise or lower the temperature in a very small area (a cell or
tile, the size of one plant or animal), hold down the Option key while you 
click. If your keyboard doesn't have and Option key, use the Control key.
 
When the cursor is in the Edit Window Display Area and the temperature tool is
active, it will appear as as thermometer.
 
Seeing the temperature display can help you understand you ecosystem's climate
and discover reasons why different plants or animals thrive or die in
different areas.
 
Adjusting the temperature directly affects the local plant life and indirectly
affects the animals. By raising or lowering the temperature in one (or more)
section(s) of a world, you can have two or more ecosystems existing 
side-by-side for comparison experiments.
 
If you change the temperature slowly over a period of many years you might be
able to track the genetic changes of the local plant life as it adapts to its
changing environment.
 
 
MOISTURE TOOL
 
The Moisture tool controls the display of moisture data in the Edit Window,
and lets you modify the local moisture in the air.

In SimLife, moisture is the combination of humidity and rainfall - all the
water that stays in or passes through the atmosphere.

To toggle the display of the Mositure layer in the EditWindow on and off,
click anywhere on the button. The words "on" or "off" will appear below
the moisture icon, indicating... I'll give you two guesses.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 109]


Moisture is displayed as colored or shaded squares. A color key to help
you interpret the moisture can be found in the Map Window Control Panel when
the moisture display is active in the Map Window.

Turning off the moisture display does not affect the simulation, only whether
or not it is shown in the Edit Window.

To raise or lower the moisture in a specific area of the ecosystem, click
on the up or down arrows, respectively, to either side of the moisture
icon, then click, click and hold, or click and drag in the display area.
After you have adjusted the moisture up or down, it will still vary with the
seasons.

If you want to raise or lower the moisture in a very small area (a cell or 
tile, the size of one plant or animal), hold down the Option key while you
click. If your keyboard doesn't have an option key, use the Control key.

When the cursor is in the Edit Window Display Area and the moisture tool is
active, it will appear as a water drop.

Seeing the moisture display can help you understand your ecosystem's climate,
and discover reasons why different plants or animals thrive or die in 
different areas.

Adjusting the moisture directly affects the local plant life and inderectly
affects the animals. If you change the moisture slowly over a period of
many years you may be able to track the genetic changes of the local plant
life as its adapts to its changing environment.


ALTITUDE TOOL

The Altitude tool controls the display of altitude data in the Edit Window
and lets you rais or lower the land.

To toggle the display of the altitude layer in the EditWindow on and off, 
click anywhere on the button. The words "on" or "off" will appear below the
altitude icon, indicating... I'll let you figure it out.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 110]


The altitude is displayed as a range of colors or shades, from dark to light
as altitude increases. A color key to help you interpret the altitude can be
found in the Map Window Control Panel when the altitude display is active in
the Map Window.

TUrning off the altitude display does not affect the simulation, only
whether or not it is shown in the Edit Window.

TO raise or lower the land in a specific area of the ecosystem, click on the
up or down arrows on either side of the altitude icon, then click, click and
hold, or click and drag in the display area.

When the cursor is in the Edit Window Display Area and the altitude tool is
active, it will appear as a mountain.

Seeing the altitude display can help you understand you ecosystem's climate,
and discover reasons why different plants or animals thrive or die in
different areas.


LIFE TOOL

The Life tool is a multi-function tool that gives you the capabilities of
displaying, placing, marking, moving, cloning, smiting and inspecting
any organism in the ecosystem.

Click on the small On/Off button below the icon to turn on and off the display
of all life in the ecosystem.

Click and hold on the Life icon to see a pop-up menu of all the capabilities
of this tool.

Click quickly on the Life icon to reselect the previous submenu choice 
without opening the submenu.
       
                                                                [PAGE: 111]



POPULATE

Populate lets you add plants or animals to the ecosystem.

When Populate is active, the cursor will appear as a DNA spiral. Clicking
or clicking and dragging will place the Selected Species into the ecosystem.
To change the Selected Species, see the section on the Dashboard above.

There are places where you cannot place a new organism. You can't place a
plant on a plant, or an animal on an animal. Sometimes when you place an
organism, you cannot see it any more. That's usually because there is 
something else in that spot that has drawing priority, i.e., animals are drawn
over plants, etc. A complete explanation of drawing order is given in the Edit
Window Display Area section above.


SMITE

Smite lets you remove individual plants or animals from the world. When Smite
is active, the cursor becomes a lightning bolt. Click on any life-form to end
its miserable existence (or enjoyable existence, if you want to feel guilty).

To remove an entire species, see the Populate Window below.


MOVE

Move lets you drag an individual plant or animal to another location. When
Move is active, the cursor becomes a hand. Click and drag to move any organism
to another place.

When moving an organism, you can't place a plant on a plant or an animal
on an animal. If you place an organism and cannot see it any more, it's
because something else in that spot has drawing priority, i.e., animals are
drawn over plants, etc.


CLONE

Clone lets you make a copy of an existing plant or animal. When Clone is 
active, the cursor becomes a double set of DNA spirals. Click and hold on any
       
                                                                [PAGE: 112]

organism, then drag the cursor to a new location and release the mouse 
button.

If you hold down the Option key (or Control key on computers with no Option
key) while cloning, the clone will mutate. For more information on mutations,
see the section on Mutation below.

When cloning an organism, you cannot place a plant on a plant or an animal
on an animal. If you place an organism and can't see it any more, it's 
because something else in that spot has drawing priority, i.e., animals are
drawn over plants, etc.


THE CARROT (RECRUIT)

The Carrot is for calling individual animals. When the Carrot is active, the
cursor will appear as a carrot. While the Carrot is active, and you click
and hold (for a while) in the display area, the animals of the Selected
Species (the one listed in the middle section of the Dashboard) will try
to go to where you click.

To change the Selected Species, see the section on the Dashboard above.

If you hold down the Option key (or Control key if your keyboard has no
Option key) and click, only the highlighted animal will be called to your
click.

This tool is useful for separating individuals or groups so it is easier to
move, clone, relocate or otherwise play with them.
