   WHEN PLAYING YOU WILL PROBABLY NOTICE THAT YOU NEVER GET WHAT YOU ARE
   LOOKING FOR.TRY TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE UNEXPECTED,UNTIL MR RIGHT TURNS
   UP,OR START AGAIN.
      THE GAME GIVES YOU VERY LITTLE OF ANYTHING.BIG ARMIES ON LONG TRIPS
   ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION AT THE BEGGINING.GETTING THE CORRECT BALANCE
   BETWEEN TOO MUCH AND TOO LITTLE IS WHAT CAN MAKE OR BREAK YOU RIGHT FROM
   THE START.
      TO START WITH,ARMIES ARE GREEDY ! THEY CAN EAT YOU OUT OF PALACE AND
   CALIPHATE-LITERALLY.SO TO GET THINGS GOING TRY THIS AS A FAIRLY ACCURATE
   GAUGE.THE RATIO FOR ONE MAN PER MONTH IS:-
   1 MAN=3 UNITS CASH,15 UNITS FOOD AND 30 UNITS WATER.
   SO A TYPICAL ARMY OF 200 MEN WOULD CONSUME AN AVERAGE OF 600 CASH UNITS,
   3000 FOOD UNITS AND 6000 WATER UNITS AND THATS ONLY FOR A MONTH.
      ONLY SEND OUT ARMIES YOU KNOW CAN AFFORD (YOU ARE NOT ALOWED A
   BUDGET DEFECIT).
      WHEN THE ARMIES ARE READY YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING NOT TOO FAR AWAY
   FOR THEM TO ATTACK.THIS SHOULD NOT BE A CALIPHATE AS HE WILL HAVE TOO
   MANY MEN FOR YOU TO FIGHT.AN INDIPENDANT FORT IS THE ANSWER.IF ON YOUR
   FIRST ATTEMPTS YOU SEND OUT TWO ARMIES,TO THE SAME CASTLE,ONE CAN ATTACK
   AND THE OTHER SIT IN RESERVE UNTIL NEEDED.IF YOU SHOULD FAIL TO TAKE THE
   PRIZE THE FIRST TIME ROUND,YOU CAN BRING UP THE SECOND ARMY FOR A CRACK
   AT THE PLUM.YOU SHOULD FIND THAT THE FORT IS SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKER.
      IF YOUR FIRST ARMY WAS SUCCESFUL,CHOOSE THE FORT ICON ON THE LEFT HAND
   SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND SELECT MILITARY.TAKE THE SUPPLY OPTION,THEN USE
   THE ARMY AS A SUPPLY POST FOR THE FORTRESS.
      YOUR SECOND ARMY CAN THEN GO ON TO CONTINUE YOUR `MESSAGE OF FRENDSHIP'
   TO OTHER TIN POT DICTATORS AND THE LIKE AND SPREAD A LITTLE SUNSHINE.

STORMING A FORTRESS
   IF YOU CHOOSE `STORM THE FORTRESS' OPTION YOU STAND A VERY POOR CHANCE
   OF SUCCEDING.YOU MARCH YOUR ARMY AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE FORT AND
   THEN CHOOSE `OFFENSIVE' OPTION FROM THE MILITARY MENU.THIS WILL ENABLE
   YOU TO TAKE THE ENEMY HEAD ON,RATHER THAN TRYING TO BRIBE YOUR WAY IN
   THE BACK DOOR,NEVER A GOOD OPTION.

OTHER METHODS OF ATTACK
   TRAP DOOR SPIDERS HAVE A NOVEL WAY OF ATTACK.THEY LIE HIDDEN UNTIL THEIR
   PRAY WALKS PAST THE DOOR,THEN THEY LEAP OUT AND ATTACK.USE THIS METHOD
   OF AMBUSH AGAINST OTHER ARMIES.FIRST SEND OUT A SPY TO DETERMINE THE
   SIZE OF THEIR ARMY,THEN IF ITS WORTH THE EFFORT,RAISE AN UNREALISTICLY
   LARGE ARMY AND JUMP THE UNSUSPECTING BADDIES,GET THE LOOT AND GO HOME.

FIGHTING
   ARCHERY IS ONE OF THE FIRST METHODS OF ATTACK THAT YOU WILL BE USING-
   UNLESS YOU BUMP INTO AN ARMY ON YOUR `GOODWILL MISSIONS',THEN IT IS DOWN
   TO SWORD FIGHTING.
      WITH ARCHERY YOU MUST BE CAREFUL THAT YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR ENEMY IS.
   THEY HAVE A HABIT OF GETTING BEHIND YOUR LINE OF VISION.TO COMBAT THIS
   ALWAYS KEEP ON THE MOVE AND TRY TO AVOID INCOMING ARROWS.A GOOD MOVE IS
   IS TO AIM-MOVE-FIRE CONTINUESLY UNTIL ONE SIDE IS DOWN.
      WHEN SWORD FIGHTING,A SURE FIRE WAY IS TO COSH THE ARAB OVER THE HEAD
   RATHER THAN SLICE IT OFF.TO DO THIS MOVE THE MOUSE FORWARD AND THEN PRESS
   THE LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.

SEA BATTLES
   THESE ARE A DIFFERENT KETTLE OF FISH ALTOGETHER.SOMETHING YOU SHOULD
   AVOID IS TO GET TOO CLOSE.THIS MEANS RAMMING IS OUT-THIS TACTIC
   INVARIABLY ENDS IN BOTH SIDES SINKING.
      GET CLOSE,THEN LET THE ARCHERS AND CANNONS LOOSE AT YOUR ENEMY.WHEN
   HE HAS A FIX ON YOUR DISTANCE,CHANGE DISTANCE AND START AGAIN.

TRADE
   TRADE IS ONLY REALLY GOOD IN ONE OF TWO SITUATIONS,THE FIRST BEING THE
   BEST-YOU HAVE MONEY TO BURN AND YOU WISH TO BUY CASTLES.THIS WAY YOU
   GAIN A FORT,MEN AND WHATEVER ELSE IS IN IT AT THAT TIME,GIVING YOU
   ANOTHER FOOT IN THE DOOR.
     THE SECOND,WHICH IF DONE INCORRECTLY CAN SPELL CERTAIN DOOM,IS IF YOU
  SELL TOO MANY FORTS TO RAISE MONEY.THIS WILL ENTAIL YOU BECOMING TOO POOR
  TO RAISE ARMIES.
     THE FINAL WAY,WHICH ALSO IS NOT ENTIRELY ADVISABLE,IS TO MOVE AN ARMY
  OUT AND GIVE THEM ENOUGH SUPPLIES TO LAST THEM FOR A WHILE.THEN GET A
  CARAVAN TO TAKE THE REST OF THE GOODIES OUT OF THE FORTRESS.SELL THE
  FORTRESS TO SOME UNSUSPECTING NEIGHBOUR AND IF AND WHEN IT IS BOUGHT,GO
  ON THE OFFENSIVE AND ATTACK IT,THUS GAINING THE MONEY YOU SOLD IT FOR
  AND THE FORTRESS (IF YOU MANAGE TO WIN).EITHER DO NOT DO THIS OR ONLY
  ONCE OR TWICE.OTHERWISE THERE GOES THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.

KEEPING CASTLES
  IF YOU WISH TO STOP YOUR CASTLES FROM BEING TAKEN FROM YOU,IT IS
  SOMETIMES A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP A GOOD SIZED ARMY IN THE FORT.THIS PREVENTS
  YOUR NEIGHBOURS GETTING BIGHEADED AND TRYING TO TAKE OVER YOUR FORTS.ONE
  WAY OF ACTUALLY GETTING SOLDIERS ON YOUR SIDE (NOT YOURS) IS TO CORRUPT
  THEM,BUT YOU NEED YOUR SPIES TO ENABLE YOU TO KNOW HOW MUCH IS REQUIRED
  TO BRIBE THEM TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.
     REGULAR CARAVANS FROM YOUR FORT ARE A VERY GOOD IDEA,THIS PREVENTS THE
  ENEMY FROM GETTING THEIR HANDS ON YOUR LOOT,IF THEY ATTACK AND WIN ONE OF
  YOUR FORTS.

PEOPLE,PROBLEMS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM
  YOU`VE GOT TO KEEP THE MASSES HAPPY-MILITARY AND NON-MILITARY PERSONEL.
  YOU NEED INCENTIVES TO KEEP THEM ON YOUR SIDE.BEING A GOOD GUY IS NOT
  ALWAYS ENOUGH.IF THEY ARE MALTREATED FOR TOO LONG-THEY REBEL,EITHER BY
  BURNING THE TAXES OR KILLING YOU.NEITHER IS A GOOD IDEA,SO THIS MUST BE
  AVOIDED IF YOU ARE TO GET ANYWHERE IN YOUR REGIME.
     CITIES NEED CERTAIN AMOUNTS TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR YOU LOSE THEM.THIS
  MEANS FINDING OUT HOW MUCH EACH CITY NEEDS AND EITHER KEEPING IT STOCKED
  UP OR REGULARY SUPPLYING IT.
     EVERY SO OFTEN YOU HAVE TO BE A GENEROUS RULER AND GIVE BACK TO THE
  PEOPLE WHAT YOU TOOK FROM THEM.THIS HAS TO BE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF
  MONEY,OTHERWISE THEY THINK YOU ARE TAKING THEM FOR GRANTED.
     WHATEVER YOU DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP A BALANCE IN YOUR FORTS OR THEY WILL
  BECOME INDEPENDENT,AND YOU WILL HAVE TO FIGHT ALL OVER AGAIN TO REGAIN
  YOUR FOOTHOLD

CALIPHS ALI BAHR
  CHOOSE THIS CHARACTER FOR A REALLY TESTING GAME.IT SEEMS THAT HIS
  CITEZENS ARE NOT VERY HAPPY AND KEEP BURNING HIS TAXES,THUS MAKING IT
  VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ANYWHERE IN THE GAME.

ALI
  THIS MAN MAY BE OLD BUT HE HAS A NICE BALANCE OF MOST THINGS.HIS PEOPLE
  TEND TO BE QUITE LOYAL,BUT CAN BE PUSHED IF NOT KEPT HAPPY.

UTMAN
  THIS CHARACTER IS MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

UMAN
  CHOOSE THIS ONE IF YOU WANT A REASONABLY EASY LIFE.MAKES A GOOD BALANCE
  OF TAXES AND LACK OF FIRES,BUT HAS AN ISLANS SO YOU CAN SEE ATTACKS FROM
  AFAR.HOWEVER,WATCH YOU DON`T GET CARRIED AWAY.

End.
