You play the part of Quiffy a green blobbie that lives in secret
caverns . he lives of trash left behind by an ancient and enigmatic
civilization . of cause these caverns are overrun with nasty creatures.
If that wasnt enough ,the mysterious taps of wrath have suddenly
ended their years of arid indifference and have started to cascade
vast quantities of water in the caverns .Because Quiffy cannot breathe
under water , he has decided that enough is enough and has resolved
to make his way to the surface and escape the creeping doom of flood !

bottom of the screen .it will tell you how much more trash needs to be
