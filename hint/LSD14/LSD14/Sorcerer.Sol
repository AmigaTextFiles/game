YOU START IN WHAT WILL TURN OUT TO BE A DREAM SEQUENCE. INGNORE THE PROBLEMS
AT THIS TIME,JUST WAIT OR DO THINGS UNTIL YOU WAKE UP.

           DO NOT TYPE `WAKE UP`UNLESS YOU WANT A VERY SHORT GAME!

YOU START THE MAIN GAME IN YOUR OWN QUARTERS.YOU ARE IN A BED AND ARE
CARRYING A SPELL BOOK. IT IS PITCH DARK. START BY GETTING SOME LIGHT.IF YOU
USE THE COMMAND TO MEMORY THE GNUSTO, REZROV AND FROTZ SPELLS. THESE SPELLS
HAVE THE FOLLING POWERS:-

        GNUSTO         WRITE A SPELL INTO THE SPELL BOOK
        REZROV         OPEN LOCKED DOORS OR CONTAINERS (SOMETIMES!)
        FROTZ          CAUSE AN OBJECT TO GIVE OF LIGHT

START THEN WITH FROTZ BOOK.YOU HAVE SOME LIGHT NOW.GET OUT OF BED AND GO
WEST. TAKE AND READ THE NOTE YOU FIND TACKED TO YOUR DOORFRAME. IF YOU READ
YOUR SPELL BOOK YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE THE FOLLOWING SPELLS
WRITTEN IN IT:-

        GNUSTO
        VEZZA         VIEW THE FUTURE
        PULVER        CAUSE LIQUIDS TO BECOME DRY
        IZYUK         FLY LIKE A BIRD
        YOMIN         MIND PROBE
        REZROV
        FORTZ

FROM THE HALLWAY GO ONCE SOUTH TO THE LOBBY AND THEN GO WEST TO THE
STOREROOM.TAKE THE CALENDAR, THE VIAL AND THE MATCHBOOK.READ THE MATCHBOOK
THEN GO EAST TO THE LOBBY. OPEN THE RECEPACLE,PUT THE MATCHBOOK IN THE
RECEPTACLE AND CLOSE IT. THIS MUST BE DONE EARLY IN THE GAME.
NOW GO AGAIN TO THE TOP OF THE HALLWAY AND THEN WEST INTO BELBOZ` QUARTERS.
LOOK BEHIND THE WALL HANGING TO GET THE KEY.EXAMINE THE DESK TO FIND THE
DRAWER. OPEN THE DRAWER TO FIND A JOURNAL, AN INFOTATER AND A BOX. TAKE AND
OPEN THE JOURNAL (WITH THE KEY). AT ABOUT THIS TIME YOU START TO GET
THIRSTY AND HUNGRY. OPEN THE OCHRE VIAL YOU FIND AND DRINK THE
CONTENTS.READ THE JOURNAL TO FIND A CODE WORD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE.
THE INFORTATOR IS THE ONE YOU GOT WITH THE INFOCOM GAME,USE THE CODE WORD
TO FIND THE RELEVANT PAGE IN THE INFOTATOR.TAKE AND OPEN THE BOX TO REVEAL
AN AMULT. WEAR IT. NOW GO BACK INTO THE HALLWAY THEN SOUTH. NOW GO WEST
INTO HELISTAR`S QUARTERS.HERE YOU WILL FIND A SCROLL,THE GASPAR.TAKE IT AND
GNUSTO IT. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SPELL.IT WILL HELP YOU LATER IF YOU GET
KILLED.SO, LEARN GASPAR AND THEN GASPAR SELF. NOW GO EAST AND SOUTH THEN
EAST INTO THE LIBRARBY. THERE IS ANOTHER SCROLL HERE, THE MEEF, TAKE AND
GNUSTO IT. ALL SCROLLS CAN BE SAFELY READ BEFORE YOU GNUSTO OR CAST THEM TO
FIND WHAT THEY CAN BE USED FOR. THE ENCYCLOPEDIA CAN BE READ. THE METHOD IS
READ ABOUT (ITEM) EG.READ ABOUT INFOCOM.
GO BACK TO THE LOBBY AND OPEN THE RECEPTACLE. IT NOW CONTAINS A MAGAZINE
AND THE ORANGE VIAL THAT YOU MAGICALLY ORDERED BY POSTING THE MATCHBOOK.
YOU HEARD THE CIMES WHEN YOU WERE DELIVERED EARLIER.
NOW GO DOWN TO THE CELLAR WHERE YOU WILL FIND A TRUNCK. IT IS LOCKED AND
CAN BE OPENED BY PRESSING THE BUTTONS IN THE RIGHT ORDER.THE ORDER CHANGES
AT RANDOM EVERY GAME AND THE ONLY WAY YOU KNOW THE CORRECT ORDER IS TO USE
THE CODE FROM THE JOURNAL AND THE COLOUR ORDER FROM THE INFOTATER. GOT IT?
RIGHT.PRESS THE BUTTONS IN THE REQUIRED ORDER AND THE TRUCK WILL OPEN TO
EXPOSE A MOLDY SCROOL, THE AIMFIZ SCROLL. THIS ONE CANNOT BE GNUSTO`D AND
THERFORE CAN BE USED ONLY ONCE.AT THIS POINT IT MIGHT BE AN AIDEA TO SAVE
YOUR PROGRESS TO DATA.IT IS QUITE A GOOD IDEA TO DO THIS TIME TO TIME
ANYWAY IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS.
NOW IS THE TIME TO GO TO THE MAIN PART OF THE ADVENTURE. UP TILL NOW WE
MERELY BEEN SCENE-SETTING . YOU WILL NEED TO USE AIMFIZ.READ ABOUT IT IN
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA. TRY THIS...AIMFIZ BELBOZ. OF COURSE, YOU COULD
TRY...AIMFIZ HELISTAR....
THE MAIN GAME AREA STARTS IN THE TWISTED FOREST....WITH A HELL HOUND AFTER
YOU! JUST GO NORTHEAST TO ESCAPE. REMEMBER THIS AREA FROM YOUR EARLIER
DREAM SEQUENCE? THERE ARE SEVERAL PROBLEMS HERE AND THEY CAN BE SOLVED IN
MORE THAN ONE ORDER. THE ROUTE GIVEN HERE IS JUST ONE WAY.
LEARN IZYUK,IZYUK AND PULVER BECAUSE YOU WILL NEED THESE SOON. FROM THE
FORSET EGDE TO GO DOWN, DOWN, SOUTH AND WEST TO THE EDGE OF THE CHASM.IZYUK
SELF AND GO WEST (YOU ARE NOW FLYING).
