THE GAME
Select a pilot from the roster using cursor keys and Return to select. If
you wish to create a pilot, you'll need to erase one of the entries
pressing Esc. Then type in your pilot's name.
Now select the level you wish to play at:

Rookie      No takeoff required. Automatic landing. No damage. Chaff and
                  flares totally effective.
Pilot       No takeoff required. Automatic landing. Chaff and flares
            totally effective.
Veteran     No takeoff required. Automatic landing. Chaff and flares
            effective when missile is close enough.
Ace         Chaff and flare only effective against non doppler missiles
                  and when missile is close enough. Doppler missiles require
                  maneuvering to avoid.
Demo        The game goes into a demonstration mode. You can take control
                  in training mode at any time by pressing a key.

GAME FEATURES

DIRECTOR
The director is a mode that makes the game more visually interesting for
spectators. In mode 1, any missiles you fire are shown being launched and
impacting the target. In mode 2, any occurence in the battle area is
shown, for example if an enemy plane takes off or a SAM is fired, you
will see it all in glorious 3D. This gets extremely annoying and
disorientating,so only use it to impress people!

TRAINING
If you are a complete pansy, you'll want to use this mode. In training
mode you cannot be damaged and you can refuel and rearm by pressing AltÄR
at any time.

MAP
The large display on the left of the cockpit shows a map of the
surrounding area. Map symbology is as follows (VGA):

Bright green rectangle:   Friendly airfield
Flashing yellow square:   Incoming missile
Black ^ shape:            Enemy SAM radar

The map can be zoomed to show greater detail.

RADAR
The radar has three ranges; short, medium and long. Long range is best
for when you are looking out for incoming enemy aircraft and doppler
missiles. Medium is best for general use, giving the best warning of
approaching missiles and aircraft (as well as the proximity of targets),
and short range is useful in dogfights.  When the sky is black with MiGs!
Radar symbology is as follows:

Red aircraft shape:       Aircraft at your altitude
Dark red aircraft shape:  Aircraft below your altitude
Yellow aircraft shape:    Aircraft above your altitude
Blue boat shape:          Missile boat
Red crossed circle:       Ground target
Green radar dish shape:   SAM radaR
Yellow line:              Radar homing missile
Red line:                 Infrared homing missile
Orange glowing line:      Doppler radar homing missile
Grey line:                Any missile that is inactive
White line:               Any missile you have fired
Orange glowing star:      Primary or secondary target
Thick white rectangle:    Airfield

COCKPIT DISPLAY
R: Radar homing missile is incoming if light flashes
I: Infrared homing missile is incoming if light flashes
L: Landing gear up if RED, down if GREEN, down at too high a speed if
   flashing
B: Wheel and airbrakes are deployed if light is yellow

HEADUP DISPLAY
The head
up display occupies the top half of the cockpit view. It follows the
same conventions as in FÄ19 Stealth Fighter:

HUD symbology that is not on every HUD:

White box:    Target camera locked on
White oval:   Weapon locked on
Red oval:     Weapon locked on; definite hit if you fire
Black box:    Target camera locked on; no weapons available though
Yellow box:   Incoming missile (enemy)
Green box:    Fired missile (friendly)
Large circle: AAM aiming reticle
Small circle: Gunsight

The HUD also tells you how many gun rounds are left after you fire the
cannon, how many weapon rounds are left after you fire one, how many
chaff/flares are left when you dispense one, whether TRAINING mode is
active and whether ACCELlerated time is in use.
In the centre of the HUD the flight path indicator is also displayed;this
shows what direction your aircraft is flying in,whereas the crosshairs
only show what direction the nose is pointed in. The crosshairs and
flight path indicator will both be central much of the time, but during
landing, for instance, the flight path indicator will (should!) be below
the crosshairs. This indicates that although the nose may be pitched up
slightly, the aircraft is actually descending. A good way to line up in
the final 10 miles of landing approach is to position your aircraft so
that the flight path indicator is just above the runway threshold and on
the centerline.

PLAYING THE GAME!
In each mission you will be assigned a primary and a secondary target.
Destroy both to complete the mission.Use any remaining ordnance on
opportunity targets.  Friendly targets will flash NO TARGET in the target
camera display.  DO NOT fire upon such targets!
After completing your mission objectives, you may land at any friendly
airfield or aircraft carrier.
The enemy, strange chaps, aren't overly keen about you waltzing in and
nuking half the countryside, so (oddly enough) they will fire SAMs at you
and launch interceptor aircraft against you. Depending upon the
difficulty level you select at the start of the game, you will have to
put up with more and more SAM and AAM launches against your aircraft.
Chaff and flares used correctly will decoy any missile except a doppler
one. These are not fooled by chaff, so you must maneuver your aircraft so
that the missile approaching from the left or right side;perpendicular to
your flight path. This also helps with normal radar missiles, but chaff
is a better bet with those. Once the missile icon in the radar display
turns grey, kick in the afterburners to get yourself well away from the
area the missile is going to pass through; just because it's blind
doesn't mean it won't hit you anyway!

You can land and rearm, refuel and repair damage at any friendly airfield
as long as you haven't completed the mission; i.e. you haven't hit the
primary target.  Rearming, etc., is done automatically; just land, shut
down the engines and after a couple of seconds with the aircraft
stationary, you will be given a message 'WEAPONS REPLENISHED'.
Chaff/flares are also topped up. Rearming costs you points, so you can't
go around the landscape hitting all the enemy targets to try and boost
your score; you'll get better scores without rearming.

NOTE: The following may not bew correct for the Amiga!

There is a way to get two more scenarios added, get F19, add the
following files from F19 to F15 and you will get two new scenarios; North
Cape and Eastern Europe.  The files to copy are:

DBICONS.SPR
CE.3D3
NC.3D3
CE.3DG
NC.3DG
CE.3DT
NC.3DT

CEUROPE.SPR
NCAPE.SPR

The file 'DBICONS.SPR' will need to overwrite the existing file of the
same name if the new scenarios are to be recognised.

There are some little quirks you'll have to put up with... for instance,
in Northern Europe you will have to put up with the Soviets using Mirage
F1s!  Also, the little snapshots in the debriefing won't be always
correct; your F15 changes into an F19 for instance, and the pic for
refuel/rearm is the pic you get in F19 when you photograph a target. But
who cares anyway!

End.
