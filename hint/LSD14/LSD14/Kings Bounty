CHANGES
  A few changes have been made on the Amiga version of King's Bounty.
Keyboard Equivalents:  CONTROL-S will save your game, 'E' will end the
current game, 'H' or the Help key will bring up the help box (described in
the OPTIONS menu in the manual). Most requesters can be exited with the ESC
key. Pressing RETURN or ENTER is equivalent to clicking on an 'OK' button.
Pressing the SPACE BAR while a sound is playing will abort that sound.
