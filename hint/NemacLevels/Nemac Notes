                           Nemac IV Level Files

Here are saved games for all the levels of Nemac IV Director's Cut
including the secret ones. There are 2 sets--one done on the normal
setting and one done on the hard setting. I really didn't notice much
difference between the two. The normal games are named L01, L02, etc. 
The hard games are named H01, H02, etc.

To use them simply load them into the saved_games drawer in your Nemac
drawer and use the Load Old Game menu option.

Enjoy! If you get enjoyment from this please drop me an email!
