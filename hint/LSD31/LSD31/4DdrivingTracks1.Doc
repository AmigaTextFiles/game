Hard Drive Installation
-----------------------
To install MASTER TRACKS I to your hard drive, simply copy all files (not
including any directories) to the drawer on your hard drive that contains 4D
SPORTS DRIVING. This can be acomplished in a variety of ways, using the CLI
COPY command, your favorite directory utility, etc. If you are unsure how to
go about copying files please consult your AmigaDos manual.

Introduction
------------
MASTER TRACKS I contains 10 new tracks designed for 4D Sports Driving. Each
of the 10 featured tracks is quite a challenge in itself, but together these
10 tracks provide for countless hours of pure racing entertainment. All
tracks are considered to be very tough to complete, so the first time you
drive a new track a speed of 20-40 miles per hour is recommended depending
on your level of driving expertise. 

Loading New Tracks
------------------
To load the 10 new tracks included on your disk load 4D Sports Driving as
usual (if you are unsure how to accomplish this refer to your 4D Sports
Driving manual), select TRACK option then MORE TRACKS. If you are using a
hard drive and have installed the tracks select the one you wish to drive
from here. Otherwise insert your Track disk and select off disk what track
to drive. Return to the main menu and select DRIVE. Off you go.

anyone who wants a copy can afford.

Support BBS
-----------
At this time Bitmask Softworks does not have a support bbs, however, we plan
to change this is in the near future as we launch a line of productivity
titles. Registered users of our software will be notified when the bbs
becomes active. Look for a long series of productivity titles coming from us
this summer, like ProDex and MathCalc.
