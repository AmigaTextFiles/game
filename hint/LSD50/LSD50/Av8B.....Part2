SECTION VI - ABOARD THE TARAWA
------------------------------

After  the  animated  sequence  which  starts  the game, the player will be
placed  in the command center of the Tarawa.  The entire game is controlled
from this location, including command of the task force and the despatch of
aircraft on combat missions.

From this location, you have four options:

1. Move around the carrier to visit other compartments.

2. Use  the  Tactical  Amphibious Warfare Data System (TAWADS) to plan or
   change combat operations.

3. Save the current state of the game, or reload a saved game.

4. Pause the game

5. Quit to DOS.

Below  deck, a single corridor gives access to all parts of the ship you`ll
need  to  use.   To  get to it, click on the EXIT sign at the top left hand
corner  of  the  screen.   (Similar  EXIT  signs  will  be found in all the
compartments you visit.)

Along  one  side of the corridor are the Pilot's Briefing Room, the Command
Center,  the  Acclimatization Room, and the Hanger.  From the other side, a
passageway leads to the flight deck.

You'll  see  the  corridor  from a position about half-way along its length
Clicking  on  the  red-coloured arrow marking on the deck will allow you to
look in the opposite direction.

To  enter one of the compartments, click on its name, or in the case of the
flight  deck,  on the sign "TO THE FLIGHT DECK".  Note how the shape of the
cursor  changes  from  an  arrow  to a cross as you align it with the name,
sign, or arrow.  This change is shape shows that the cursor is aligned with
a selectable option.

At  either end of the corridor are elevators.  These will take you to three
other levels of the ship;

PRIMARY FLIGHT CONTROL (PRI-FLY) 

COMMAND CENTER (COMM. CNTR)
 
CARGO HOLD

VEHICLE DECK

Clicking on the appropriate switch will take you the level you've selected.

Clicking  on the EXIT sign at the top left of the screen will take you back
to  the  corridor, directly in the case of compartments in the corridor, or
via the elevator in the case of the other decks.

Modern  warfare  is  fast moving, and in the heat of battle, time is short.
To  help  you  "short  cuts" are provided to those parts of the ship you'll
need to visit most often.

There are telephones in most compartments.  Clicking on these will take you
immediately to the Command Center.

WHAT THE COMPARTMENTS DO

Each compartment of the ship has its own specialised function:

The Command Center

The  Command Center has two large wall mounted displays, and three computer
consoles.   As  was  the  case in the corridor the cursor will change shape
from an arrow to a cross to indicate possible selections.

The  central  computer  console  in  the Command Center gives access to the
Tactical   Amphibious   Warfare   Data  System  (TAWADS),  a  sophisticated
integrated computer system designed to provide command and control over the
group's aircraft, weapons, sensors and landing craft.

TAWADS  has  two main purposes.  Before the campaign begins, it is used for
detailed  strategic and tactical planning.  When TAWADS is ordered to run a
plan, it will automatically send the relevant orders to the units which are
tasked with carrying them out.  No military plan ever survives contact with
enemy  but  must  be modified and updated as the campaign proceeds.  TAWADS
will  allow you to assess the progress of the conflict, and to issue direct
orders  to  ground  and  air  forces,  ordering  them to carry out specific
tactical tasks not envisaged in the original battle plan.

Full  information  on  the  use  of  TAWADS  is contained in the Task Force
Commander's Manual.

Pausing the Game

When  the  phone rings, or other interruptions disturb the player, its easy
to  pause  the simulation.  Just click on the command centre digital clock.
(When  you're  in  the  cockpit flying a mission, the game can be paused by
pressing the P key).

Saving the Game

The  Command  Center  is  the  only location where you can save the current
state of the game.

As  you  play  through  a campaign, the computer keeps track of the current
position  of  the  fleet, plus the position of all US and Indonesian ground
forces,  and  what  they  are  currentlv  doing.  It also keeps a record of
damage  which you have inflicted on the enemy`s fixed bases, and the losses
in  aircraft,  helicopters,  vehicles,  and  men  which  you have suffered.
Finally,  it  must  also note any changes that you have made to the current
battle plan.

Saving  a  game  takes an electronic "snapshot" of all this information and
stores  it  on the hard disk.  You can reload this saved game at any time -
this  will reset the entire game world back to where you were when the save
was carried out.

There  are  at  least  two  reasons for saving a game.  After you have been
playing  for  several  hours, the Real World may suddenly intrude - the dog
demands to be walked, it's time to eat, or time to sleep.  It might even be
time to use the computer for something so mundane as work.  Saving the game
before quitting will allow you to continue play at a later date.

The  other  reason  for  saving  is to preserve a record of your success to
date.   Saving  regularly  is  an  insurance policy against things suddenly
going wrong.  If you make a tactical error, or the Indonesians hit you with
a  brilliant  counter attack, you can effectively reset the clock and try a
different strategy.

The  save/load game screen is called up by clicking on the disk icon on the
command  center  desk  (You'll  see it to the left of the white telephone).
The  screen has save/load facilities on the left hand side, and a record of
the game-configuration preferences on the right.

There are 10 slots available to hold saved games.

To save a game, click on one of the slots. It will become highlighted.

Click  onto  the  Save Game icon (an arrow pointing at a floppy disk).  The
current  game state will be saved into the hard disk, and the selected slot
will  now  contain  the name of your saved state.  It should read something
like  SABER  0/9:50.  The name is made up to the name of the plan currently
being run, plus the current date and time.  The example shown contains Plan
SABER at the state it had reached by 9.50am on day 0 of the campaign.

A saved game can be retrieved at any time by entering the SAVE/LOAD screen,
clicking  on  the  slot which contains the saved game, then clicking on the
Load Game icon (an arrow pointing away from a floppy disk.

The  Preferences section of this screen allows you to permanently configure
some  features  of the game.  (These can be configured for the current game
session only by the means of a menu accessible by pressing ESC while in the
AV-8B  cockpit).   Each  customizable  feature  has its own icon.  Click on
these  to change a preference for example, click on Joystick Control to set
the  default  control to joystick.  Preferences can be saved by clicking on
SAVE PREFERENCES.

Useful Short Cuts

The  Command  Center also provides three useful "short-cuts" to other parts
of the ship:

This  is the only compartment where clicking on the telephone does not take
you  to  the  Command  Center.   When  playing  the  game,  you`ll often be
switching  between  the  Pilots  Briefing  Room  and the Command Center, so
clicking on the white telephone in the Command Centre takes you directly to
the  pilots  briefing room.  If a red light is flashing on this phone, this
indicates  that  fresh  missions  have been posted on the whiteboard of the
Pilots Briefing Room.

Clicking  on  the  left-hand wall-mounted display takes you directly to the
aircraft cockpit.

Pilots' Briefing Room

Visit  the  Pilots'  Briefing Room to select the AV-8B missions you want to
fly,  and  to  receive  pre-flight briefings before take off.  Return there
after  landing  to  receive  a debriefing report summarizing the success of
your attack.

Central  item  in  this  compartment  is a large whiteboard used to display
information  to  pilots.  On either side are monitor screens which are used
to call up further information.  Clicking on these selects the type of data
displayed on the whiteboard.

When  you  enter  the  room  from the corridor or directly from the Command
Center,  the whiteboard will show the new missions waiting to be flown.  If
you  want  to  see  this at any other time, click on the right hand monitor
screen.   Clicking on the left-hand monitor will bring up on the whiteboard
a list of currently-airborne AV-8Bs.  Clicking on any one of these will put
you into the cockpit of that aircraft.  Turn off its autopilot, and you can
fly the mission.

Consult  the  AV-8B Pilot's Manual for full information on how to use these
displays.

The AV-8B Cockpit.

Once  you`re  in  the  cockpit and airborne, there are four ways of getting
back to the ship:

The  most obvious to is complete the mission, then land (either manually or
under  autopilot control).  After landing, pressing Ctrl-D or waiting for a
short  time will take you back to the Pilots Briefing Room for a debriefing
session  which  will  tell you how well the mission went.  The only type of
mission  which  does  not  result  in  any  debrief is a Combat Air Patrol.
(Having  flown  the  mission you'll already know how many aircraft you shot
down.)  If  you want to skip the debrief press Ctrl-C after you land.  This
will take you directly to the Command center.

Like  all  pilots  sent to war, you run the risk of being shot down.  Using
the  ejection  seat to escape from a crashing AV-8B should see you returned
to  the Pilots Briefing Room for a debriefing session.  Whether you land in
the  sea or on East Timor, a rescue helicopter will almost certainly get to
you, and return you to the ship.  Like AV-8Bs, the small force of pilots is
a valuable resource.

If  you  crash,  either due to pilot error or by being shot down, you'll be
returned  to  the  Command  Center  -  dead  pilots  don't  need debriefing
sessions!

If you press ESC, then select Commander from the menu which appears, you go
back  to  the  command  center,  while  the computer takes over the task of
automatically  flying  your aircraft.  You can jump out of a Harrier at any
time,  return  to  the  command  center,  then  rejoin the mission from the
currently  active  missions  displayed  in  the  pilots  room.   (The phone
shortcut from the Command center to the Pilots Briefing Room makes it quick
to get back to the aircraft.)

Acclimatization Room

This  compartment contains an AV-8B flight simulator.  Here you can practce
flying  the  AV-8B.   Clicking  on  the up and down arrows on the simulator
control  console allows you to select the type of training mission you want
to  fly.   The  simulator  will  then put you in the cockpit of an aircraft
which  has  been  correctly  set  up  for  the  sortie.  At the end of each
training mission you are returned to the Acclimatization Room.

Hangar Deck

From  here,  the  AV-8Bs are raised on the deck-edge elevator to the flight
deck.   Tarawa  carries  eight  aircraft,  and  this view will show you the
number  currently available to fly missions.  Clicking on the ARM icon will
raise  and aircraft to the flight deck, then take you to the Weapon Loading
Screen, and then into the cockpit to begin a Combat Air Patrol.

Flight Deck

Walking onto the flight deck takes you into the Weapon Loading screen, then
into  the  cockpit to begin a Combat Air Patrol mission.  No waypoints will
be  set  in  the Nav system.  One Harrier will always be available to fly a
Combat Air Patrol.

Primary Flight Control (PRI-FLY)

The island is the tall superstructure on the starboard (right hand) side on
the  Tarawa.   A  glassed-in  compartment high up on the island acts as the
shipboard  equivalent  of  the  Control Tower at a land-based airfield From
here, the Air Officer (known as the "Air Boss") controls flight operations.
Seated  in  a  padded chair, he can turn to look out of any of the windows,
observing  the  entire flight deck.  Once the amphibious landings get under
way, the flight deck will be a busy place at times.  Try to stop by Pri-Fly
and watch the flight deck operations.  Pressing Keys F1 F2 F3 F4 will allow
you look out of the various windows.  Esc returns you to the elevator.

Cargo Hold

By  visiting the Cargo Hold, you'll get an idea of how much of the on-board
stores  are  still available for use.  The number of crates visible gives a
general  indication  of  the amount of stores available, and you can assume
that the proportion of the stores available on board the other ships in the
task  force  are  similar  to those on Tarawa.  If the Cargo hold starts to
look  empty,  the  cargo  holds  on the other amphibious ships will be in a
similar condition.

Vehicle Deck

The  vehicle  deck  shows the next group of vehicles available to go ashore
with  the  Marines.   When  the campaign begins, you'll see a group of LVTs
(Landing Vehicle Tracked) ready to go ashore.  As was the case in the Cargo
Hold,  this  view  gives  an indication of the vehicle availability for the
entire task force.

Simulation Viewpoints

As  you`ve  already  seen, the game allows you to jump from one aircraft to
another,  or  back  to  the  Tarawa.   These  are not the only views of the
simulated world you can look at.  Several keys flip you to more spectacular
viewpoints.   Before  trying  this,  you'd  be  advised to hit the A key to
engage  your  aircraft's  autopilot.  It's easy to crash while admiring the
visuals.

Pressing  the  V key switches to an outside view of your aircraft.  You can
move  around  your AV-8B by pressing the appropriate function keys.  F3 and
F4  will  position  you  60  degrees  on  either  side  of the nose of your
aircraft, F5 and F6 will put you 60 degrees on either side of the tail.  F7
and  F8  with smoothly rotate the view left or right respectively, while F9
and F10 rotate the viewpoint up and down.

Pressing  the  0  key  effectively  places  a  TV camera in the sky at your
current  location,  and  provides a movie-like view of your aircraft flying
off into the distance.

The  J  key  switches  to  the  enemy's  viewpoint.   This takes you to the
selected  or designated target.  In air combat, this key will take you into
your  opponents  cockpit,  so gives you a quick way of checking that you`re
not about to be shot down.

If  you launch a guided missile, the M key will show you the view seen from
the   missile  seeker.   It's  not  particularly  useful,  but  it  can  be
spectacular.

SECTION VII - FLIGHT TRAINING
-----------------------------

Primary Training

If  you've never flown a flight simulator, you need to understand the basic
rules of how to fly an aircraft.  (If you already understand these, you can
go directly to the heading "Using the Part-Task Simulators").

An aircraft must be maneuvered in three dimensions - pitch (nose up or nose
down),  yaw  (nose  left or nose right), and roll (nose rotated to move one
wing  down  and the other up).  In a conventional aircraft, these movements
are  generated by hinged control surfaces whose position is controlled from
the cockpit.

The  control  column  often referred to as the joystick - is used for pitch
and  roll  control.   Yaw  is controlled by the rudder pedals.  Luckily for
computer  based  flight  simulations,  the part played by yaw is relatively
minor.  Most flying maneuvers are commanded using the control column.

Dozens  of old movies on TV will have made you familiar with how to control
an  aircraft in pitch, showing pilots pulling back on the control column to
bring  an  aircraft out a dive.  Pulling back the control column causes the
elevators  moveable  surfaces  on  the  aircrafts  horizontal  tailplane to
deflect  upwards  into  the  flow  of  air caused by the aircraft's forward
speed.   The  result  is  similar in effect to moving the rudder of a boat:
The nose moves in the direction in which the hinged surface was moved.  The
airflow  pushes  against  the  raised  elevator,  pushing  the  tail of the
aircraft  downward,  and  lifting the nose.  Cockpit scenes from old movies
showing  dive  bombers in action illustrate the opposite rule - pushing the
control column forward causes the nose of the aircraft to fall.

Given  that an aircraft has a moveable rudder surface on its vertical tail,
it would be reasonable to assume that steering to right and left is done by
moving  the  rudder  to  right  or left.  That works with a boat, but on an
aircraft  produces  a skidding turn which is not particulary useful The way
to turn an aircraft is to roll it in the required direction.

This is done by moving the control column from side to side.  To fly to the
right, move the control column to the right.  A hinged control surface near
the  right wingtip will rise, while a similar surface on the left wing will
droop.  These surfaces are known as ailerons, and always respond to control
column  movements  by  moving in opposite directions In this case the right
aileron will force the right wing down, and the left airelon will cause the
left  wing  to  rise.   This  will start the aircraft turning to the right.
Pulling  back  on  the  control column will tighten the turn.  Once you get
close  to  the  desired  bearing,  reduce  the back pressure on the control
column, and move it to the left until the wings return to level.

Centering  the  controls  after  demanding  a  maneuver does not return the
aircraft  to the straight and level.  At first sight, this may seen hard to
understand,  but  an automobile provides a simple analogy.  If your driving
north, and use the steering wheel to turn onto an eastbound road, returning
the  wheel  to  its  central position once you're headed eastwards does not
bring you back to running north.  Like the steering wheel on an automobile,
the  controls  of  an  airplane  are  used  to order a change of direction.
Centering  them  tells  the  aircraft that the change of direction has been
completed.

In  a real aircraft, the rudder is controlled by the rudder pedals.  In our
simulation,  you must use the < and > keys.  These move the rudder left and
right  respectively.   In a normal flight simulation, the rudder has little
effect.   Its main function is to make small horizontal aiming corrections,
or  to  final  heading  corrections  when landing.  On the AV-8B, it serves
another purpose, one which is unique to V/STOL aircraft.

Lift  the  nose of a conventional aircraft too far and the speed will start
to  fall.  As the speed of the aircraft falls, so does the speed with which
the air flows over the wings and movable control surfaces.  Just as a boats
rudder loses effectiveness at slow speed, so do elevators, ailerons and the
rudder.   Fly  slower still, and the flow of air over the wing is no longer
fast enough to maintain the lift needed to support the aircraft.

Effectiveness  of  the control surfaces falls away steadily but in the case
of  wing  lift  the  deterioration is quite sudden.  The upper surface of a
wing  is  slightly humped in cross section, and at speed the airflow across
the upper surface will cling to the wing on the rear side of the hump.

If  the  speed  of  the  aircraft  gets  too slow this process breaks down.
Instead of staying at the surface of the wing, the air breaks away from the
wing  along  the  highest point of the hump.  This sudden breakaway sharply
reduces wing lift.  In technical terms the wing is said to be "stalled".

Deprived  of  lift,  the aircraft will lose height, and its nose will drop,
and  the resulting shallow dive will build the speed back up until the wing
functions  normally.  At low level, that height loss can cause you to crash
If  you  were  turning  at the time of the stall, the aircraft will enter a
spin.  Ejection may be the only course open to you.

By  moving  the nozzles of the Pegasus engine downwards, an AV-8B pilot can
substitute  engine thrust for wing lift, flying at ever - decreasing speeds
below the stall until the aircraft is in a hover.  At these low speeds, the
control surfaces have no effect, so control is automatically transferred to
a  system  of nose, tail and wingtip mounted reaction jets.  Similar to the
thrusters  used  to orientate spacecraft, these reaction jets allow control
to be maintained even in the hover.  Using the rudder in the hover can send
the  aircraft  pirouetting  round  -  a  trick  often demonstrated when the
Harrier appears at air shows.

Like  an  automobile,  an  aircraft has controls for increasing or reducing
speed.   The throttle controls engine thrust, so works like the accelerator
pedal  of  an  automobile.  The other control you need to know about is the
airbrake.   This  is  a  hinged  surface  which swings downward beneath the
fuselage  of the AV-8B.  It creates drag, reducing the aircrafts speed much
faster than throttling back can.

If  this is the first flight simulation you've purchased, try the exercises
offered by the Part-Task Simulators described below.  The take off exercise
will  give  you  the  chance to fly around and try out the controls without
falling  foul  of  an Indonesian F-16.  Once you can maneuver the aircraft,
and have fired a few weapons in practice, try your hand at combat missions,
opting  to  fly  the Simple Model.  This will be easier to control than the
Advanced  Model.   The  autopilot is there to help you both in the training
exercises  and in combat.  Don't hesitate to use it, particularly when it's
time to land.

Using the Part-Task Simulators

Like USMC pilots assigned to fly the AV8B, you'll learn to fly the aircraft
by carrying out a series of exercises on Part Task Simulators (PTS).  These
are  designed  to help to learn the different aspects of flying and combat.
You'll find the Part Task Simulators in the Acclimatization room of the USS
Tarawa.  There are five different PTSs, each of which will take you through
one  main  aspect  of  the  operation of the AV-8B Harrier.  Information on
recommended  flight  procedures,  and  how  to  aim and fire the weapons is
contained  in  the  AV-8B  Pilot's  Manual, which you should consult before
starting your training exercises.

Take-Off

This  places you in the cockpit of an AV-8B with no underwing stores.  This
lightly  loaded  condition  will  allow you to practice vertical as well as
short  take-offs.   Although  able  to  carry  out  vertical  takeoffs  and
landings,  the  AV-8B  can  carry a heavier weapon load if it makes a short
take  off run.  The PTS will allow you to try.  This section teaches how to
take off and land under heavy load conditions, using the vectored thrust to
keep take off and landing distances to a minimum.  Hovering manoeuvering in
the  hover,  making  the  transition to forward flight, then the transition
from forward flight back to the hover can all be practised in this PTS.

Landing

Landing  an  aircraft  aboard a ship is never easy but Harrier's ability to
fly  at very slow forward speed supported by downward thrust eliminates two
of  the  hazards of conventional carrier landings - the high approach speed
and the need to catch a braking wire with the fighters tail hook.  To quote
Mike  Gaines, defence editor of the magazine Flight International, "It is a
lot easier to stop and land than to land and try to stop."

Landing  is made harder when the ship is stationary since this requires the
pilot  to perform a hover.  This simulation teaches the trainee to approach
the  carrier  from  the  correct angle and height, then to get down without
crashing into the island or any other aircraft on the deck.  You will start
in  the  cockpit of an AV- 8B with no underwing stores.  You will be flying
at  a  height  of  around 250ft, and Tarawa is directly ahead of you, about
five  miles  away.   The  nearest ship visible directly ahead of you is not
Tarawa.  Don't waste time trying to land on it!

Simple Weapons

This  PTS  places  you  in  the  cockpit of an AV-8B flying at around 550ft
altitude  and  heading  toward  a barge target about seven miles away.  The
aircraft  is  armed  with  Mk81 iron bombs.  Hydra rocket launchers and its
25mm cannon.  Fly this exercise several times, trying each of these weapons
in turn.  Diving attacks with guns and rockets are the best way of knocking
out  small  targets,  but  in  combat exposes the aircraft and pilot to the
dangers  of light AAA fire and the risk of failing to pull out in time, and
flying  into  the  ground.   Practice  your  tactics before trying them out
against an enemy who shoots back.

Guided Weapons

You're  at  the  same  height and facing the same target as in the previous
exercise,  but now your aircraft is armed with laser-guided versions of the
Mk81  bomb  (shown  in  the  HUD  as  "Mk81L",  and AGM-65E Mavericks.  Try
attacking the target barge with both types of weapon.

Air Combat

In  this case, your target is an unmanned drone aircraft, programmed to fly
a  circular  flight  path.  This will allow you to practice approaches from
different  angles,  engaging  the drone either with an AIM-9M Sidewinder or
with the 25mm cannon.

SECTION VIII - TASK FORCE COMMANDERS MANUAL
-------------------------------------------

As commander of Operation Ocean Saber, you have two responsibilities Before
the  outbreak  of  hostilities,  you  must  devise  an overall plan for the
amphibious  landing  and  the  subsequent  ground  battle  with the enemy's
forces.   This  will  specify  the  movement of the assault ships and their
escorting  warships,  the  targets  to  be  attacked from the air, also the
landing  points,  subsequent  movements,  and  targets  for  the ground and
airborne troops.

Once  the plan is complete, you can start the simulation.  As this proceeds
under  the control of the computer, your job as commander is to monitor the
air  and  ground war you'll have to "fine tune" the battle plan, responding
to  the  movements  of  the enemy and the successes or failures of your own
forces.

CREATING A BATTLE PLAN

When  planning  a  campaign, the first step is to locate the most important
targets of the map.  These are the major towns, the air bases, and the most
important  fixed military bases.  Having noted their position, identify the
nearest  beaches  on  which  you can send Marines ashore.  Can any of these
inland  targets  be  "taken out" by units landed by helicopter?  Once these
airborne  forces  have  landed,  and  completed their mission, will they be
strong enough to beat off counter attacks?

Once  ashore,  your Marines will advance to attack the inland targets which
you've  assigned  to them.  Use the Tactical Amphibious Warfare Data System
(TAWADS)  to  identify  the enemy forces based at these locations, and work
out  how large an attacking force you`ll need, and how much air support you
can afford to provide with the numerically small fleet of AV8Bs.

Some  targets  can  be  destroyed by air attack using the AV-8Bs.  Identify
these, and decide in which order they should be attacked.

How  are you going to deal with the Indonesian Air Force?  Attack it on the
ground  and accept the losses which will result from flying against heavily
defended air bases?  Or wait for it to come up and fight?

Many of the Indonesian units are mobile, and will only appear on the TAWADS
map if they lie along the route of an AV-8B or helicopter mission which has
been  flown.  To locate those in areas not overflown by current operations,
you may want to launch aircraft on reconnaissance missions to these areas.

Having  listed your priorities, determine where to position the fleet.  The
AV-8Bs  can  travel  to  a distant target quite quickly but the slow-moving
landing  craft  cannot.   The  closer  you  are to a planned beachhead, the
faster the landing craft can make the round trip to the shore and back.

Having  the  ships repeatedly rush from one end of East Timor to another to
get aircraft and landing craft close to their targets will waste time - try
to develop a single integrated plan under which the ships will cruise along
the shore, launching their attack missions.

The  battle  plan  contains  several  components.  At the top level are the
movements  planned  for the ships of the task force.  These fleet movements
are  specified  as  a linked set of numbered waypoints.  At most waypoints,
the task force will launch one or more combat operations.

The  heart of the plan you devise will be a route off shore along which the
fleet  will  sail.   This  route  will  consist  of a series of interlinked
waypoints.   At each waypoint, you will have created one or more operations
-  air or ground missions which must be launched from this location.  These
can  be  assaults  by  ground  forces,  attack or transport missions by the
fleet's helicopter force, or air missions for Tarawa's AV -8B Harriers.

These  operations  in turn will follow routes which are themselves a series
of  linked waypoints, some of which mark the position of targets which must
be  attacked.   Each combat operation is based on a ship in the task force.
When the task force reaches the appropriate waypoint, the combat operations
associated with that waypoint are automatically launched.

It's  impossible  to  "muddle  through" a major amphibious operation Before
starting  the  campaign,  it's essential that you have a clear and coherent
plan.  The US, British and French units which General Schwarzkopf sent deep
into  Iraq  during Operation Desert Storm knew when they crossed the border
where they were going, what to do when they got there, and what to do after
that.   If  you want to win, make sure the Marine units you send ashore are
equally well informed.

TAWADS  will  allow you to create and position waypoints for the fleet, the
AV-8Bs,  the  helicopters,  and  the  ground forces.  It will automatically
handle  much  of  the detail, such as waypoint arrival and departure times,
freeing you to concentrate on shaping the overall plan.  By the time you've
created  a  plan  of  your  own, you'll realise why the job of commanding a
Marine  Expeditionary  Brigade  is  normally  given to a Brigadier General.
It's not easy.

Since  the  software  comes with at least one pre-defined campaign, you may
find  that examining these will give you ideas on how to construct your own
plan.   For example, battle plan SABER sends Harriers to the fixed bases to
bomb  them  heavily  then  relies  on ground forces to mop up the remaining
mobile units.  This is one potential solution - others may be better.

It's  essential  that  your plan should be balanced.  Sending ground forces
onto  East  Timor without air cover will result in them taking heavy losses
as  they  attempt to destroy the fixed bases.  You can`t just leave the job
to  the  infantry.  Don't let the spectacular air component of Desert Storm
fool  you  into thinking that the fight against the Indonesians can be left
to air power.  General Swarzkopf had hundreds of aircraft at his disposal -
you have only eight!  If you rely on air power to attack fixed/mobile units
on  Timor  you  will  probably miss the supporting mobile units.  After the
AV-8Bs  have gone, the mobile forces will get to work to repair the damaged
bases.

FIGHTING THE CAMPAIGN

Once  a  plan has been devised, you can start the simulation running.  Once
activated,  it  will  automatically generate detailed mission instructions.
The  computer  will  act as your staff passing commands to the units tasked
with  carrying  out the individual parts of your plan They in turn will try
to  achieve  what  you  have  asked  them to do.  As the fleet reaches each
waypoint, it will launch all the operations due to begin at that location.

As  your  ground  forces  are  committed  to battle, the multi layer expert
systems  within the software will react to your actions, taking action with
its  own  forces in real time.  Moving in a realistic manner these computer
controlled  enemy  units  will  defend  their ground, advance to fight your
forces, or retreat.

As the campaign gets under way you'll then have to monitor the intelligence
information  and  decide  how  to  counter the enemy's moves In running the
battle you`ll have three main sources of information.

1. The TAWADS map display

2. Intelligence reports.

3. Pilot briefs.

TAWADS  will allow you to assess the progress of the conflict, and to issue
direct orders to ground and air forces, ordering them to carry out specific
tactical  tasks not envisaged in the original battle plan.  It will be your
job  to  modify  the  battle  plan, responding both to the movements of the
enemy and to the successes or failures of your own forces.  You may have to
send  out  new  units or alter the orders of units in the field in order to
reinforce  a  critical  part of the battlefield, exploit a breakthrough, or
stop a retreat.

Like  a  good  military commander, the expert systems controlling the enemy
forces  will not waste time in indecision.  They will monitor the movements
of  the  US  forces,  and  once combat begins will try to identify tactical
weaknesses,  and  move enemy forces to exploit these.  Its view of tactical
priorities  may  not be the same as yours.  Look out for the unexpected and
remember that the enemy may respond faster than you anticipate.

Don't forget that as task force commander you have more information on what
the  enemy  is  doing than your commanders on the ground.  Your guidance is
essential to the efficient operation of your troops.  Every action you take
effects  the  world  you  are  playing  in  thereby giving you a feeling of
realism  never  encountered  before.  Your decisions and actions, successes
and failures will swing the whole conflict one way or the other.

THE COMMAND CENTER

The  Command Center has two large wall-mounted displays, and three computer
consoles.   As  was  the  case in the corridor the cursor will change shape
from an arrow to a cross to indicate possible selections.

The  central  computer  console  in  the Command Centre gives access to the
Tactical   Amphibious   Warfare   Data  System  (TAWADS),  a  sophisticated
integrated computer system desigued to provide command and control over the
group's aircraft, weapons, sensors and landing craft.

The  monitor  on  the  left-hand  side  is  for Tarawa's Air Data Computer.
Clicking  on  this  screen  shows the current state of fleet of eight AV-8B
Harriers  based  on the ship.  It will report on aircraft lost in action or
accidents.

The  monitor  on  the  right-hand  side  is  for  the Ground Data Computer.
Clicking  on  this  will  display the latest combat reports from the Marine
units operating on shore.  These messages will detail major gains or losses
of territory made by the Marines, and report casualties.

Remember to check these monitors regularly.  If one or more unread messages
are  waiting  on  either  of the monitors, the monitor will scroll, and its
cursor  will  flash.   If it isn't flashing, there are no fresh reports for
you to look at.

USING TAWADS

The TAWADS system has 11 operating modes:

BATTLE PLAN SELECTION Selection, overview and activation of Battle plans.

BATTLE  PLAN CONTROL Control over fleet movements and access to battle plan
operations.

OPERATION   DETAILS   Allows  the  creation,  review  and  modification  of
operations associated with the selected fleet waypoint.

HARRIER WAYPOINTS Entry and amendment of individual helicopter movements of
an AV-8B.

HELICOPTER WAYPOINTS Entry and amendment of individual helicopter operation
movements.

GROUND   FORCE  WAYPOINTS  Entry  and  amendment  of  individual  operation
movements by ground forces.

AIR  PLAN  Give  new  instructions  to  an  immediate and unscheduled AV-8B
sortie.

OVERIDE Give new instructions to a ground unit for immediate action.

INTELLIGENCE Provides information on a designated unit or location.

KEY Explains the symbols used on the tactical map.

MENU Customises the running of TAWADS.

Each  of  these modes opens a command window offering tactical information,
and most have two levels of control functions.

The  first  level  of  control are the options available by clicking on the
icons  contained  within  the  window.   Every window has at least one icon
(EXIT or CLOSE), and some have several.

The  second  level of control is via a submenu.  Not normally visible, this
can  be  opened  by clicking anywhere in the grey background of the window.
This  small menu will list the control options available in this particular
TAWADS mode.

Display Conventions

On  the TAWADS tactical map, the routes between mission waypoints are drawn
automatically.   Ground  and  air  routes and waypoints shown in yellow are
currently  active.   Those shown in light grey are planned operations which
have  yet  to  begin, while those in dark grey are history and have already
been  completed.   With its default display options active, TAWADS does not
display  missions  which  have been completed.  The waypoints and route for
the fleet are shown in blue.

Inputting Your Commands

The  main  interface with TAWADS is a two-button pointing device - either a
mouse or a joystick.  The keyboard is used only to enter names of Plans and
Operations.

The left-hand button on the mouse provides the Select function; that on the
right  provides  the  View  function.   The  location  of  the buttons on a
joystick  varies from one model to another.  Later you'll be shown a simple
way  of  determining which provides the Select function, and which the View
function.

The  buttons can be used in the normal three ways - to single click, double
click, or drag.  If the manual simply tells you to click, use the left-hand
button as normal.

The  pointer  is  generally  free  to move over the entire display, however
during  certain  operations  the  pointer  movement will be restricted to a
limited area (for example, during menu operations).

STARTING TAWADS

The  centre  computer  console in the Command Center is the TAWADS display.
The green shape visible on the screen is an electronic map of the island of
Timor.   Clicking on this screen will provide a full screen TAWADS display.
If  no battle plan is being executed as will be the case the first time you
look  at this screen - a rectangular battle planning window will be open at
the top left hand corner of the map.

The  TAWADS  synthesized  map is a simple contour view of the active combat
area  in  this  case  the  island of Timor.  Overlaid on this basic map are
symbols  indicating  the  position  of towns, villages, and roads.  A small
white shape off shore marks the current position of the US naval force.

EXPLORING TAWADS

The  TAWADS interface can be a bit daunting when first seen, so let's try a
simple walk-through of its main features without actually trying to fight a
campaign.   A window in the battle-planning window should show "SABER", the
name  of  the  pre-loaded  battle plan.  If it doesn't, click on the SELECT
icon  (the  up and down arrows) until SABER is displayed.  Now click on GO.
The battle-planning window will close, the battle has begun.  You'll notice
that the fleet has now moved up to the coastline of East Timor.

You`ll  see  various coloured lines and symbols overlaid on the map.  These
represent  the opening moves of battle plan SABER.  For the moment lets get
rid of them and declutter the screen.

Clicking  on  the  MENU  icon will open the Options Menu.  Click on DISPLAY
OPTIONS,  and  you'll  see  a list of features which can be overlaid on the
map.  The default conditions at startup are for Cultural features, Military
Units,  Plans  Forward and Plans Current to be displayed.  Click on Plans -
Forward  to  remove  these.   The menu will close.  Reopen it, and click on
Plans  Current  to  eliminate  these.   Now  you  should  have a reasonable
decluttered map to explore.

With  the  map  set to its initial relatively small scale, it will still be
fairly cluttered, even on a 17" monitor.  The first thing you'll want to do
is  to  centre the map on an area of interest, and change the scale to make
more detail visible.  There are two ways of doing this.

Surrounding  the  map are control icons.  These provide access to the major
functions  of the system.  A single click on any icon performs the function
associated with that icon.

The two icons at the bottom left of the screen provide control over the map
view.

Clicking  on  the up, down, right or left arrows within the MAP SCROLL ICON
scrolls the map view in the appropriate direction.

Clicking on the MAP ZOOM ICON with the select button decreases the scale of
the map, zooming in by a factor of two.  Clicking on the same icon with the
view  button unzooms the view.  A little experimentation at this point will
show joystick users which button is which.  The button which makes the view
of the island get larger is the select button; that which makes the view of
the island larger is the View button.

A small horizontal marker at the top of the map gives an idea of the amount
of  terrain  being  viewed.   As  the zoom setting is changed this line can
indicate  anything  from  tens  of  meters  to hundreds of kilometers (km).
Other  data  displayed  on  the  map surround shows is the current date and
time, also the system mode and selected battle plan.

Trying Out the Map

To  get an idea of how to use the map, use the MAP SCROLL icon to bring the
eastern  tip  of  the island to the centre of the screen.  Click on the MAP
ZOOM  icon  several  times  to  zoom  in.   You'll  soon be able to see the
individual  ships  in  the  fleet, plus several other types of symbol - red
diamonds,  blue  rectangles,  and  faster-moving  orange  airplane symbols.
These  are  military  units taking part in the battle.  Clicking on the KEY
icon at the top right will open a window listing the symbols.  (This can be
closed when no longer required by clicking on its CLOSE icon.)

Keep  zooming  in,  and  place names will appear.  You`ll see that the town
nearest the eastern tip of the island is Tutuala.  (You may have to use the
MAP  SCROLL icon to re-center Tutuala.).  Zoom in further, and you`ll start
to  see  finer  detail.   For example, there is a small wood some ikm north
east of Tutuala.

Click  right  on the MAP ZOOM icon until Lore becomes visible in the bottom
right  corner of the map.  We will use this to become familiar with another
way of moving around and zooming on the map.

Place the cursor on Lore, then use the View button to drag it to the centre
of the screen.  (As you do this, the cursor will change from being a single
arrow  to a tiny version of the MAP SCROLL icon.) When you release the View
button,  the map will move to bring Lore to the location where you released
the button.  If you think of this process as "Dragging Lore into View", you
will  have  a  neat way of remembering how its done - a drag operation with
the View button.

Move  the  cursor onto Lore, then click the view button.  This will magnify
the  map  by  a  factor of two centered about the pointer position.  Double
click with the view button reverses the magnify operation.

To  find  out  more  about  any  location  on  the map, you need to use the
INTELLIGENCE  icon.  To see this feature in action, click on Lore to expand
the  scale.   Clicking  on  the INTELLIGENCE icon will open a window giving
details of enemy strength in the town.

Use  your pointing device to explore the map, zooming in and out to examine
some of the towns and villages, checking the identity of the military units
you  encounter.   You'll  soon become accustomed to using the map controls,
and will be ready to tackle the task of planning an operation.

TAWADS OPERATING MODES

Let's look at each of these TAWADS operating modes in more detail.  To help
you  find the information you need to control combat operations, a standard
format is used to describe each mode:

STARTUP - how to enter this mode.

PURPOSE - a Summary of what this mode does.

LIMITS ON POINTER MOVEMENT - the area of the display over which the pointer
can be moved.

DESCRIPTION  - a fuller description of the purpose of this TAWADS operating
mode.

COMMAND ICONS - the function of each of the icons contained in this window

SUBMENU the command options available from this windows hidden menu.

BATTLE PLAN SELECTION

STARTUP  -  Automatic on the first use of TAWADS.  Subsequently by clicking
on the PLAN icon on the map surround.

PURPOSE - Selection, overview and activation of battle plans

LIMITS ON POINTER MOVEMENT - restricted to the battle planning window.

DESCRIPTION  -  Opened over the top left corner of the map, the Battle Plan
Selection  window  allows  the  commander  to review existing battle plans,
create a new plan from scratch, and activate a chosen battle plan.  A brief
outline  of  the  selected  battle  plan  is shown in the lower half of the
window.

Command Icons

          Click right to select the previous plan.

OUTLINE   Edit the outline description of the battle plan.

GO        Instructs TAWADS to activate the selected plan.

EXIT      Closes this window.

Submenu 

Clicking  anywhere  on  background of the Battle Plan Selection window will
open a menu offering the following functions :

Review/Change Battle Plan

Review or change the operational details of the selected plan - clicking on
this  will  take  TAWADS into the Battle Plan Control mode described in the
next section.

Add New Battle Plan

Create  a new battle plan - the system has a maximum capacity for 99 plans,
so  feel  free to create lots of new ones.  You will be prompted to enter a
name for the plan.  Type this, then press RETURN.  This newly- created plan
will  contain  no  orders.   To  create the orders which will make up a new
plan, re-open this menu, and click on REVIEW/CHANGE BATTLE PLAN option.

Remove Plan

Remove an unwanted battle plan from the TAWADS computer.

If  you  decide  not  to carry out any of the above functions, you can exit
from this menu by clicking outside of it.

BATTLE PLAN CONTROL

STARTUP  via  the map surround PLAN icon when a battle plan is active, also
via the Battle Plan Selection sub-menu "review/change" option.

PURPOSE  -  provides control over fleet movements and access to battle plan
operations.

LIMITS ON POINTER MOVEMENT Map and Battle Plan Control window.

DESCRIPTION  -  The  movement  of  the  task  force is directed by a set of
waypoints  defined  by the battle plan.  A waypoint is a map location where
something  is  scheduled to happen - once arrived there, a military unit is
to  make  a  change of course, loiter, or carry out some action.  Waypoints
are used to direct the fleet, and to provide start points for operations.

The  fleet waypoints are shown as a linked set of diamonds on the sea.  All
waypoints are numbered.  Waypoints which the fleet or other forces have not
yet  reached can move moved, but not waypoints that your units have passed.
By definition, these are now part of history, so cannot be altered.

Fleet waypoints can be selected using the pointer select button.  The lower
part  of the Battle Plan Control menu will show the time at which the fleet
is due to arrive and depart this waypoint.

Fleet waypoints can be moved by dragging them with the Select button.  This
will automatically update the displayed fleet arrival and departure times.

Double-clicking on a waypoint will take TAWADS into Operation Details mode.
Described  later  in this section, this will allow you to review change, or
add operations associated with this waypoint

Command Icons

EXIT  -  closes the Battle Plan Control window.  If your designing a battle
plan, this will save any changes you have made to the plan.

Submenu

Clicking  anywhere on the background of the Battle Plan Control window will
open a menu offering the following functions:

Review/Change Operations

This  is  the most common function used in plan updating.  It activates the
Operational  Details window control function, allowing review/change to all
operations  initiated  at the currently selected waypoint.  Double clicking
on a waypoint on the map also activates this function.

Add New Waypoint

This  adds  a  new  waypoint  to  the  plan.   When building a plan, you'll
normally  want  to  add  the new waypoint at the end of the existing set of
waypoints,  so  this  is  where the new waypoint will normally be placed by
TAWADS.  If you`re modifying an existing plan, you may want to insert a new
waypoint between two existing waypoints.  This can be done by selecting the
waypoint before where you want the new waypoint to be.

For  example  if  you  want  to  create  a new waypoint between waypoints 5
waypoint  and 6, click on waypoint 5, open the submenu, then select ADD NEW
WAYPOINT.   A  new  waypoint  6 will appear close to waypoint five, and the
later waypoints in the plan will automatically be renumbered, and the later
waypoints in the plan will be recalculated.

In  every  case  the  newly-created waypoint will be positioned close to an
existing  waypoint  - either the last waypoint of the intermediate waypoint
you  selected.   You'll now need to drag it to the final location where you
want  it  to  be  positioned.   TAWADs  will  automatically compute the new
arrival and departure times for this and any subsequent points.

Remove Waypoint

This  will  remove  the  selected  fleet waypoint from battle plan.  Before
removing  a  waypoint, make sure you have removed any operations associated
with this waypoint.

Change Departure Time

Normally  TAWADS  will  automatically  plan a departure time which allows a
long  enough  interval  for  all  the  operations  you've  planned for this
waypoint.   If  you  add  more operations, TAWADS will increase the time at
this waypoint to accommodate the extra operations.  Sometimes, you may want
the  fleet  to  loiter  at  a  waypoint for a predetermined period of time.
Clicking  on  Change Departure Time will open a submenu showing the current
arrival  and  departure  time.   Clicking  on  the minutes displayed in the
departure  time with the left button will add a minute to the time spent at
this  waypoint;  clicking  with  the  right  button will subtract a minute.
Clicking on the hour or the day will change these values in the same way.

OPERATION DETAILS

STARTUP  -  via  the  Battle  Plan  Control  window's submenu, or by double
clicking on a waypoint while in Battle Plan Control mode.

PURPOSE  -  Allows  the  creation.   review  and modification of operations

Depending  on the type of mission being added, TAWADS will now enter either
the  Harrier  Waypoints,  Helicopter  Waypoints, or Ground Forces Waypoints
mode,  so  that  you  can  define waypoints and targets for this operation.
Consult the relevant heading later in this section for furthur information.

Remove Operation

Remove  selected  operation from the battle plan.  (This is not possible if
the operation is already active or finished).

Operation Schedule

An  Operations  Scheduling  window  will  open  listing  all the operations
planned  from  this  waypoint.  These will be listed in date/time order and
the  list is scrollable by clicking on the up and down arrows at either end
of the vertical orange scroll bar.  If an operation has not yet begun.  its
priority  may  be  changed.   Select  the  operation  to be re scheduled by
clicking on the appropriate line in the listing.  The line will turn red to
show that it has been selected.  Clicking on the clock face icon at the top
left  corner of the Operations Scheduling window with the right button will
advance  the  operation one position up the list:  clicking the left button
will demote it one position further down the list.  When satisfied with the
changes, click on this window's Exit icon.

HARRIER WAYPOINTS

STARTUP  from  the  Edit  Mission  or  Add  New  Operation functions of the
OPERATION  DETAILS  window's submenu, or directly from the AIR PLAN icon on
the map surround.

PURPOSE  -  entry  and  amendment of individual operational movements of an
AV-8B.

LIMITS ON POINTER MOVEMENT - Map and Harrier Waypoints window

instruction,  which is highlighted red on the map.  In planning your route,
remember  that  the  AV-8B  has  no  forward  looking radar able to provide
terrain-avoidance  information.   If  mountains lie between an aircraft and
its  target,  you  should  add  one  or  more navigational waypoints to the
planned  route in order to take the flight path around these.  Waypoints on
the  planned flight path may be designated as primary or secondary targets.
Waypoints marking targets should be positioned as accurately as possible on
the  map,  since these mark the point to which the aircraft Nav system will
guide  you.  The more accurately the waypoint is positioned, the closer the
target  will be to your flight path, making it easier to locate visually in
the forward view

information.   If  mountains  lie  between  an aircraft and its target, you
should add one or more navigational waypoints to the planned route in order
to take the flight path around these.  Waypoints on the planned flight path
may  be  designated  as  primary  or  secondary targets.  Waypoints marking
targets  should  be  positioned as accurately as possible on the map, since
these  mark the point to which the aircraft Nav system will guide you.  The
more  accurately  the waypoint is positioned, the closer the target will be
to  your  flight  path,  making it easier to locate visually in the forward
view.

PURPOSE - Give new instructions to a Marine unit operating on East Timor.

LIMITS ON POINTER MOVEMENT - none.

DESCRIPTION  -  During combat the commander may wish to issue a last-minute
change  or  orders  to  ground  forces already sent into action, overriding
their  current orders with a new assignment of higher priority.  The ground
unit  to  be  given  the  new command must be selected on the map using the
Select button.  Opening the Intelligence window (if it is not already open)
will confirm the identity and current status of the unit).

Selects  the  new  primary  target  -  this  is done by clicking on the new
target.

This change of plan takes place immediately

CONFIGURATION MENU

STARTUP - from the MENU icon on the upper left border of the tactical map.

PURPOSE - customizes the operation of TAWADS.

LIMITS ON POINTER MOVEMENT - individual menus.

DESCRIPTION  -  The  operation  of  TAWADS  can  be  configured to meet the
preferences of the player.

Submenu

Clicking  on  the  MENU  icon on the upper right border of the tactical map
will open a menu containing the following options:

Stop Time

This pauses the simulation.

Normal

The  simulation  runs in real time - this is the normal operating mode when
playing the game.

Fast

The  simulation  runs  at four times normal time.  This can be useful while
units are on the move, but little else is happening for example, if landing
craft are heading from the assault ships to the beachhead.

Step 1 Min

This is an alternative method of temporarily speeding up the game.

Step Next Mission

This  advances  the game to the point where the next mission is about to be
launched.   This  allows  the player to "fast forward" through parts of the
plan  in  which  no  operations are to be launched.  For example plan SABER
contains  relatively  few  night  missions  for  the  AV-8Bs.   If none are
scheduled,  selecting  "Step  next  mission" will advance the simulation to
dawn of the next day.

Speeding  up  time is something a commander will want to do quite often, so
you  can jump directly to this function by clicking on the digital clock on
the upper border of the TAWADS map display.

Pressing  any  key during time advance will stop the advance and return you
to normal time.

SECTION IX - INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING
----------------------------------

Lower  the blinds, lock the door and post sentries to make sure we won`t be
disturbed  by  those  not  cleared  for Secret material.  The spooks of the
Defense   Intelligence   Agency  have  prepared  the  following  classified
presentation to guide you through your mission;

THE INDONESIAN ARMY

Current   total   strength  of  the  Indonesian  Army  is  around  210,000.
Provincial and District commands have at their disposal some 80 battalions.
Nominal  strength  of  a  battalion  is around 1,500 - 2,000 men.  Most are
infantry  units,  but  there  are also four airborne battalions, plus eight
artillery  battalions,  and  eight for air defense.  East Timor covers some
7,700  square  miles.  Normal Indonesian Army force level in this region is
between 20,000 - 30,000 soldiers, probably 10 - 15 battalions in all.

For  years,  counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency have been major tasks
both  for  the  Indonesian  Army  and  its  Special Warfare Command and for
specialised  anti-terrorist  units  such as the Armys Detachment 81 Special
Forces,  the  Navy's Kesatuan Gurita, and the Air Forces Satgas Atbara, and
the Satgas Gegana (Counter terrorist Task Force) of the National Police.

Years of combat experience has made Indonesia's commando units probably the
world's   most  effective  counter-insurgency  force.   Over  almost  three
decades,  almost  all  of  the Army's senior commanders have served in East
Timor and regard the campaign as valuable training for the service.

In   its  anti-guerrilla  operations,  the  Army  makes  extensive  use  of
helicopters  to  move  its  commando  forces.   Under  a  scheme designated
Territorial  Counter-Guerrilla  Warfare, the commandos have demonstrated an
impressive  ability to move, fight and survive by using tactics copied from
their guerrilla opponents.

This  sort  of  extended  anti-guerrilla  campaign  has  proved  costly  in
financial terms.  The East Timor National Council of Maubere Resistance has
estimated  that  the  annual  cost  to  the  Indonesian  Government  of its
counter-insurgency campaign is $1,200 million.

Given  Indonesia's long standing and expensive military struggle to end the
rebellion,  the  rulers  of Indonesia will almost certainly use their large
reserve  of forces to reinforce East Timor once Ocean Saber gets under way.
The  Kostrad  (Indonesia's  strategic  reserve)  consists of three infantry
brigades,  three  airborne  brigades,  two regiments of field artillery, an
air-defense  artillery regiment, and two engineering battalions.  There are
also  two  brigades  of  Marines,  Assuming  a typical size of 6000 men per
brigade, this provides a reserve force of at least 30,000 men.

The  Indonesian  Air Force has a fleet of around 19 Lockheed C-130 Hercules
Transports.   Each  of  these four-engined aircraft can carry more than 100
soldiers or up to 20 tons of cargo on a typical mission.  These will almost
certainly be used in attempts to ferry soldiers and marines into East Timor
landing them at the airfields on the north coast.

Other  reserves  exist  in  the form of the Wanra (People's Resistance) and
Kamra (People's Security).  These are local auxiliary forces supporting the
Army  and  Police  respectively.   Lightly  armed and with minimal training
neither should pose any threat to the Marines, and are unlikey to be met in
combat.

Indonesian battalions are identified by three digit numbers, and like their
US   equivalents   consist  of  companies  subdivided  into  platoons.   By
monitoring  radio traffic between units, the general operating area of each
battalion  has  been  established, and this information is contained in the
databanks  of  the  TAWADS  system.   Identification  does  not  stretch to
companies  or  platoons,  since communications at this level are largely by
phone  or  messenger,  rather  than radio.  Intelligence can thus establish
that  a  town  is  being held by the 239th battalion, but not that the cook
house was being guarded by the 3rd platoon, 5th company

To label unidentified enemy units, the US Marines use the following scheme:

U/<unitnumber>,<battalionnumber> bn

For example:

U/7, 239 bn
U/1, 409 bn

The  "U"  in the designation indicates that the identity of this subunit is
unknown.   Each  battalion  has  its  own  set of "U" numbers, so the first
example  would  be  the seventh subunit of the 239th battalion to have been
located.

THE EAST TIMOR RESISTANCE

Although the nominal strength of the East Timor resistance is thought to be
around  1,400,  this  force  is in no position to provide assistance to the
Marines.   The  resistance  operates in units of between 10-50 men, average
age being in the teens or early twenties.  Shortage of radio communications
forces  individual  units  to  operate  autonomously,  without  any form of
effective central control.

Weaponry  is largely small arms, mostly captured M16 rifles, but there is a
shortage of ammunition.  Lacking a large scale backer prepared to arm them,
the  rebels  are  also  short of hand grenades, and light machine guns, and
have no shoulder-fired SAMs able to deal with Indonesian helicopters.

The  resistance tends to avoid pitched battles with the Army.  It considers
itself  a  political  symbol  rather than a fighting force, and is only too
aware  that  it  lacks  the strength and numbers needed to capture and hold
territory.   Once  the  Marines  land, we expect the resistance will do its
best  to  harass  the  defenders with ambushes and diversionary hit-and-run
attacks,  but  it lacks the weapons and manpower to take direct part in the
fighting.

INDONESIAN NAVY

Under normal circumstances, the 17 frigates, four Exocet-armed fast- attack
craft,  and  two  submarines of the Indonesian Navy would pose a formidable
threat  to the US task force.  However, the Indonesian Navy took no part in
the coup, and has publicly distanced itself from the ruling junta.  Through
diplomatic channels, senior Indonesian Navy commanders have informed the US
government  that  their  service  will  not oppose any UN sanctioned action
against  Army  and Air Force units in East Timor.  The US government has in
turn  assured  the  Indonesian  Navy that its neutrality will be respected,
provided that its warships remain north of East Timor and at least 10 miles
from  the island's northern coastline.  This condition has been accepted by
the  Indonesian  Navy,  but  to  avoid the risk of accidental confrontation
between the two navies, the President has directed that the US fleet remain
south of East Timor throughout Operation Ocean Saber.

INDONESIAN AIR FORCE

The  Indonesian  Air  Force  is  relatively small, but well equipped.  With
limited  funds  for  aircraft purchase over the years, the Indonesians have
always  chosen  wisely.   Every type of jet fighter currently in Indonesian
service  was  good  enough  to  be selected by the US Air Force and Navy as
"aggressor" aircraft for Top gun and other air combat training schemes.

F-16 Fighting Falcon

The  newest  and  most  potent  warplane  you'll face is the single engined
General  Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon.  A batch of 12 - eight single- seat
F-16A  and  four  two-seat  F-16B entered service in 1990.  These are basic
Block  15  version of the aircraft, rather than the more potent Block 50/52
model  now  in  service  with  the  USAF but it remains an agile and highly
effective  fighter.  On paper, the F-16 totally outclasses the AV-8B in air
combat.   It has a top speed of around Mach 2.0 compared with the Mach 0.85
of the AV-8B, while its combat ceiling of around 50,000ft is around 5,000ft
above that of the Harrier II.

In  practice,  most  modem air combat takes place at altitudes of less than
20,000ft,  and  at speeds ranging from Mach 0.8 - 1.2.  Here the difference
between the two aircraft is less obvious.  Under typical combat conditions,
the  AV-8B and the F-16 are in a similar weight category.  The F-16's Pratt
&  Whitney  F100  engine  generates  about ten per cent more trust than the
Rolls  Royce  Pegasus in the AV-8B, but burns about twice as much fuel when
doing so.

An  F-16  can  only  reach  full  engine  thrust  by  using  a  fuel hungry
afterburner.   Any  extended  use of afterburning will have the enemy pilot
peering  nervously  at his fuel gauge and wondering if its time to head for
home.   The  AV-8B  develops full thrust without afterburning, so its pilot
can  make  more  use  of full power in combat.  When attacked by F-16s, use
that  thrust, plus all the maneuvering advantage which can be obtained from
"viffing" .  Try to fight on your terms, not his.

The  main  air-to  air  armament of the F-16 is the AIM-9 Sidewinder plus a
built-in  2Omm Vulcan cannon.  The latter has a similar rate of fire to the
25mm  cannon  carried  by  the  AV-8B, but its 20mm shells cannot match the
explosive  power  of  the  larger  25mm projectiles.  The export version of
Sidewinder supplied to Indonesia is less sophisticated than the AIM-GM used
by the AV-8B, so should be more vulnerable to decoy flares.

Indonesia  uses  the  F-16  both  as  an air combat fighter and as a strike
aircraft.   On  a  short-range  attack  mission,  an  F-16  can carry up to
12,0001b of bombs.  If F-16s are sighted, always remember that their target
may not be you, but Tarawa or one of the other ships in the fleet.

F-5 Tiger II

Much the same applies to the other supersonic fighter in Indonesian service
- the Northrop F-5E and F-5F Tiger II.  Top speed in this case is Mach 1.64
at  36,000ft, while the combat ceiling is 54,000ft.  The F-5 lacks the high
thrust-to-weight ratio of the F-16, but its high maneuverability makes it a
dangerous opponent.  In the 1970s this aircraft was used by the "Aggressor"
and "Top Gun" training units of the USAF and USN, who found it well-matched
to the task of simulating the small and agile Soviet MiG-21.

Ten  single  seat  F-5E  and  four  two-seat  combat  capable  trainers are
currently  in  service.   They have two 2Omm internal cannon, and can carry
AIM-9 Sidewinder, or several tons of bombs.

A-4 Skyhawk

The  final  aircraft  you can expect to meet is the McDonnell Douglas A- 4E
Skyhawk.   Originally developed as a lightweight shipboard attack aircraft,
this  small  subsonic bomber can carry up to 8,000lb of ordnance, including
bombs  and unguided rockets.  Britain`s Royal Navy lost several warships to
A-4  attacks during the Falklands War and the 26 in Indonesian service will
pose a high threat to the amphibious- warfare ships of the US force.

After  releasing  its  bombs, the A-4 is a capable subsonic opponent in air
combat.   It can carry the AIM-9 Sidewinder, and has a built-in armament of
two  20mm  cannon.  In air-to-air combat, US and Israeli Skyhawks have used
cannon or unguided rockets to down MiG-17 and MiG-19 fighters.  Indonesia's
pilots  will  be hoping to add the AV-8B to this list so treat the A-4 with
respect in a dogfight.  It's not known as "Heinemanns Hot Rod" for nothing!

Other Aircraft

Indonesias  final  operational  jet  is the British Aerospace Hawk advanced
trainer.   Although an effective light-strike aircraft, it is not currently
based in East Timor and you are not likely to meet it in combat.

The  final  type  of  aircraft  in  East  Timor  is the Bell Model 205 UH-1
Iroquois  better  known  to  the  US services as the "Huey".  The 16 strong
fleet  is  operated by the Army rather the Air Force.  Widely used as light
troop  transports, these can carry between 11 and 14 soldiers.  Since these
are  regularly  used  as light inter-island transports, it is impossible to
determine how many of the 16 are currently in East Timor.

GROUND TARGETS IN EAST TIMOR

Mobile Units

Years  of anti-rebel operations have taught the Indonesian Army the virtues
of  mobility.   Much of the strength of the resident garrison will probably
be  found in small groups of between two and six tanks, personnel carriers,
trucks,  or other heavy vehicles.  Normal development practice is for these
to  be  stationed  around fixed bases, villages and towns, but there should
also  be  opportunities  to  attack  such  units while they are on the road
travelling operating locations.  These units will move when and if they are
required  to  support  their home bases.  The position of mobile units will
not be known until they have been sighted by US aircraft.

Fixed Bases

Typically these will be military camps, with several buildings and bunkers.
Some  have  radio antenna masts.  Installations of this type are positioned
at  road  functions  and further intelligence information relating to these
can be found in the TAWADS databank

Fixed  bases  are  always supported by a number of mobile units, the number
depending  on the importance of the base.  Some indication of the number of
mobile units around a fixed base should be available to pilots during their
pre-mission  briefing, and more exact information on the mobile units which
have  been  detected by US aircraft will probably be available from TAWADS.
These defending units may have shoulder launched SAMs.

If  a  fixed  base  is attacked, normal Indonesian Army doctrine is for the
surrounding  mobile units to regroup around the base and support it.  These
include  engineering  units  which  will probably attempt to repair damaged
bases.   If  you destroy the buildings in a base, but fail to hunt down and
destroy  any  enemy  mobile units in the locale, those building could quite
quickly be repaired and returned to operational status

Fuel Dumps

Petroleum,  Oil,  and Lubricant (POL) supplies for the Indonesian forces in
East Timor are stored in several Fuel Dumps.  These are major installations
with  large  above-surface fuel tanks on ground.  The latter will be highly
vulnerable  to  air attack, but pilots should avoid overflying at low level
the massive explosion which results from the destruction of the filled fuel
tank.   Like  the  Fixed Bases, fuel dumps are located near road junctions,
and will protected by a significant defensive force.

Air Bases

Five  air  bases  have  been  identified.  All are heavily defended by both
fixed  and  mobile  units.   The  two  biggest  air bases are Dili and Vila
Salazar  on the north coast.  Dili also serves as the civil airport, having
taken over this role from Vila Salazar.  By local standards, both are major
airports  with  several  runways,  substantial numbers of hangers and other
buildings, and a control tower.  These are the main operating bases for the
F-16s,  and  would  be  the arrival point for any Indonesian reinforcements
flown in by air

Three  smaller  bases  are  at Suai, Same, and Viqueque on the south coast.
These  have  a  single runway and several hangers, and are normally used by
the F-5 force.  The possibility of F-16s being moved forward to these bases
cannot be ruled out.

Electronic  intelligence  gathering  has  produced  no  evidence  that  the
Indonesian  Air  Force  is  planning  a  pre  emptive  strike on the fleet.
Fighters   are  unlikely  to  be  scrambled  until  US  warplanes  approach
Indonesian Airfields or begin attacking targets on East Timor.

SAM Sites

All the SAM systems in service with the Indonesian forces are either mobile
or  easily  transportable.   Normally  these  are  kept at fixed bases, but
electronic  intelligence gathering operations conducted over the last eight
hours suggests that these are now being deployed under cover of darkness to
their  operational  positions.  As soon as a SAM site is detected, the area
it covers will be noted in the TAWADS databanks.

Villages and Towns

These have no fixed defenses, but mobile units may be based around them.

INDONESIAN ARMY EQUIPMENT

Since  seizing  power the military junta has embarked on major purchases of
military  hardware.  These have greatly increased the striking power of the
Army particularly in terms of tanks, artillery and surface-to-air missiles.

Standard  main battle tank is now the Chinese T-59, a version of the Soviet
developed  T-54/55.   Armed  with  only a 100mm gun, these 38 ton tanks are
outclassed  by the US M1 Abrams.  Although crudely made, these are reliable
and  well-armored  for  their  weight  class.   If unsupported by the small
number  of  tanks  available  to  the  landing  force,  Marine  units which
encounter  T-59s  should  be  able  to  deal with these using TOW anti-tank
missiles.   The  T-59  will  also  be vulnerable to attack by the AV-8Bs or
AH-1W attack helicopters.

The  main  artillery used by the Indonesian Army is a Chinese built version
of  the  Soviet 122mm D-3O howitzer.  With a maximum range of just over 9.5
miles  (15km),  these are out-ranged by the more modern M198 howitzers used
by the Marines.

Two  types  of  mobile Anti-Aircraft Artillery (AAA) have been purchased in
large  numbers.   The  heaviest  is  a  Chinese-built version of the Soviet
ZSU-57-2 a twin-barrelled 57mm gun mounted on a T-54 tank chassis.  This is
a  relatively slow-firing weapon, but a single hit can do massive damage to
your aircraft.

Much  more  likely to score a hit is the radar-guided ZSU-23-4 Shilka radar
guided  AAA  gun,  significant quantities of which have become available on
the  international  market  with  the  collapse of the former Soviet Union.
Mounted  on  a  PT-76  tracked chassis, this four barrelled weapon combines
accuracy with a high rate-of fire.

Until  recently  Indonesian  surface-to-air  missile  (SAM)  defenses  were
restricted  to small numbers of British and Swedish systems, but these have
not  been deployed in east Timor.  The SAM defenses of East Timor are based
on  two types of missile purchased from one of the former Soviet republics.
The  SA-3  is a transportable command-guided SAM with a maximum range of up
to  15  miles (25km).  The smaller SA-6 is mounted on tracked vehicles, and
has a range of 18 miles (30km) against low altitude targets, or about twice
this distance against aircraft flying at high altitude.

SA-3  and  SA-6  will  probably be used to defend airfields, and other high
value  targets  such  as  fixed  bases  and fuel dumps.  Flying at very low
altitude  (around  300ft)  should  dramatically reduce the effectiveness of
these  both  types of SAM, but will increase the risk posed by AAA weapons.
The  ALQ-164  jamming  pod  should  also  reduce the effectiveness of these
missiles as will the release of chaff.

Mobile  units  have  been  armed  with  the Chinese built HN-5, an improved
version  of the Soviet SA-7 shoulder fired missile.  This is a heat seeking
missile,  with  a  maximum  range  of  around  two miles (3.5km).  The best
counter to this weapon is to release flares.

INDONESIAN COMBAT PERFORMANCE

The  Marines  have  the  edge  over  Indonesian soldiers in both quality of
equipment  and  level  of  training.   In a firefight against an Indonesian
mobile  unit,  a  US  unit  of  similar size will probably win with minimal
casualties.  When sent against defended fixed bases, the Marines will be an
a  disadvantage,  since  they not only cope with dug-in defenders, but must
also concentrate on trying to destroy base facilities.  Without air support
the marines are likely to take significant casualties in such an attack you
are  advised to bomb fixed bases using the AV-8Bs, then send in the Marines
to  mop  up  any  remaining  defenses.  If this is not possible, the AV-8Bs
should at least provide Close Air Support for the attacking Marine forces.

THE HARRIER AT WAR

Harrier  has  twice seen combat action.  USMC AV-8Bs were deployed to Saudi
Arabia in 1990, and played a successful role during Desert Storm.  Almost a
decade  earlier,  Britain  successfully  used  the aircraft during the 1982
Falklands  War.  Both campaigns illustrated the strengths and weaknesses of
the aircraft, offering useful lessons for the current East Timor campaign.

OPERATION CORPORATE: THE LIBERATION OF THE FALKLANDS

On  April  2nd  1982,  Argentinian  forces  invaded  the  Falkland  Islands
overcoming  the  token  UK  military  forces  stationed there.  The US Navy
believed  that  the  recapture  of  the  islands  by Britain was a military
impossibility  a  view obviously shared by Argentina.  This view overlooked
the  presence  of  two  strong-willed  individuals - British Prime Minister
Margaret  Thatcher and the head of the Royal Navy, First Sea Lord Sir Henry
Leach.   Even  before  the  Argentinian  fleet had reached the Falklands to
begin  what Argentina saw as the liberation of part of its territory, Leach
had  begun  to  assemble  the  naval  task force whose first elements would
depart for the south Atlantic on April 5th.

Britain's  Royal  Navy no longer operates full-sized aircraft carriers able
to  operate  conventional catapult launched fighters.  To provide air cover
for  the  task force, the UK had to rely on the Sea Harrier.  A total of 28
were  deployed  on two vessels.  Invincible was the first of a new class of
light  carriers,  while  the larger Hermes was a conventional carrier which
had  been  rebuilt  as  a helicopter equipped assault ship.  To improve the
endurance  and  firepower of the Sea Harrier, a modification program fitted
the  aircraft  with  larger drop tanks, and increased its armament from two
Sidewinders to four.

In  theory  at  least,  the  British aircraft should have been no match for
Argentina's  top  fighters.   The  21  Mirage  III  and  26 examples of the
Israeli-built  Dagger  copy of this French fighter were supersonic aircraft
with  a  top  speed  of  Mach  2.  Luckily for the British, the Mirage is a
delta-winged  aircraft,  a configuration which requires a long runway.  The
airfield  at  Port  Stanley  was  the largest in the Falklands, but had too
short  a  runway  to handle these aircraft.  The Mirages and Daggers had to
fly  their combat missions over the Falklands from bases on the Argentinian
mainland.   Like  the  Messerschmitt Bf109 fighter which escorted Luftwaffe
bombers  attacking  Southern  England  fifty years earlier, the Argentinean
fighters  were  forced  to carry external fuel tanks to extend their range,
and  even with these could spend only a few minutes flying at full power in
the combat zone.

On May 1, Hermes launched 12 Sea Harriers to carry out attacks on
the airfields at Port Stanley and Goose Green. An hour after their
return, these aircraft were once more airborne on air-defense patrols.
Despite being outnumbered six to one, the force of 28 Sea Harriers
scored 20 "kills" and three "probables" during the brief war. Sixteen of
the Argentinian aircraft were downed using the AIM-9L Sidewinder
the other four by fire from the Sea Harrier's internal armament of two
30mm Aden cannons.

Six  Sea  Harriers were lost.  One was shot down by a Roland surface-to air
missile  the other by AAA.  The remaining four were lost in accidents - one
crashed  after  take  off  while  the  others fell victim to the foul South
Atlantic  weather.   Two which went missing while on patrol are believed to
have  collided  in poor visibility while another rolled off the deck of the
carrier and fell into the sea.

To  supplement the small Sea Harrier force, 14 Royal Air Force Harrier GR.3
fighters  were  selected  to  handle  much  of the ground-attack role.  RAF
pilots  were  hurriedly  trained  in the art of flying from a carrier while
their  aircraft  were  modified to carry AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles.  These
aircraft  were  flown  to  Ascension  Island.   Six  were sent to the South
Atlantic aboard a container ship, then transferred on arrival in mid May to
the  flight  deck  of  Hermes.   Two  more  flew  from Ascension to Hermes,
arriving  on  June  1,  and were followed by a further two which arrived on
June 8th.

The  RAF  Harrier  GR.3s flew 125 ground-attack and tactical reconnaissance
sorties  in  the  face  of  heavy  defensive  fire,  mainly from light anti
aircraft  weapons.   Three  of  the  10  aircraft  were lost in action, all
believed to have been the victims of anti-aircraft gunfire.  "Most aircraft
engaged  in  offensive support survived damage, which usually resulted from
intense  Argentinian  anti-aircraft  gunfire, said the British Government's
official  report  on the campaign.  Most of the close support missions used
unguided  bombs,  the  British  BL775  cluster  bomb  proving  particularly
effective.

Throughout  the  brief  war  task force commander Rear Admiral John "Sandy"
Woodward  was aware that the success of the amphibious landing would depend
on  the  survival  of  his two aircraft carriers, particularly the flagship
Hermes.   Wherever  possible,  he  kept  these  vessels  well  east  of the
Falklands,  and  thus out of range of the Argentinian Mirages, Daggers, and
Skyhawks.  Even at this distance, Woodward still faced the threat of attack
by fighter-bombers equipped with the French built Exocet anti-ship missile,
but Indonesia has no weapons of this type.

For  Ocean  Saber,  the US has only one carrier, while the number of AV-8Bs
available  is  around  a fifth the size of Woodward's combined force of Sea
Harrier  and  Harrier  GR.3 aircraft.  This small air component must handle
both the air to-air and air-to-ground missions, flying against an air force
about a third the size which Britian faced in 1982.  Without Tarawa and its
AV-8Bs,  the landings are doomed to failure.  Lose Tarawa, and you lose the
campaign.

During  the  Falklands War the Argentinian Air Force made two main tactical
errors.   One  was  for  its  fighters  to launch their missiles at maximum
range,  then  turn  away  to retreat at supersonic speed.  The Sea Harriers
were  able to dodge the incoming missiles, close the range, then fire their
own  Sidewinders.   The  other  was the fact that for most of the brief war
aircraft  tasked  with  attacking  the fleet concentrated their fire on the
escorting  warships  rather  than  the  amphibious  ships  and  transports.
Destroyers and frigates could be replaced by others despatched to the South
Atlantic  in  the  wake  of the main task force, but the carriers and their
aircraft,  plus  the  assault  ships  and  transports  with  their cargo of
soldiers and equipment were irreplaceable.

Neither  error is likely to be repeated by the Indonesians.  The F-16 has a
much  longer  range  than  the Mirage and Dagger so will have ample time to
engage  the  AV-8Bs.   It  also  has  a  much  higher  performance than the
Argentinian fighters, and is armed with more effective air to air missiles.
Unlike  Rear-Admiral Woodward, the commander of Ocean Saber does not have a
supply  of fresh escort vessels.  Like the amphibious ships and transports,
Kidd and her Perry-class companions are irreplaceable.

OPERATION DESERT STORM: THE LIBERATION OF KUWAIT

The  part  played  by  the AV-8B in Desert Storm was relatively small.  Two
squadrons  of AV-8B were among the first Marine aircraft to arrive in Saudi
Arabia.   By  the time that the air war began, 6O AV-8B were operating from
shore bases, and a further 26 aboard amphibious- warfare ships operating in
Gulf waters.  This was a total of four squadrons and one detachment.

The  land  based aircraft operated from King Abdul Aziz Airfield.  This was
the  most northerly airfield used by the Allies, and ensured a short flight
time  to  the  combat  zone.   Other  deployment  locations  included rough
airstrips and concrete forward sites.

The AV-8B went into action on the first day of the ground war, knocking out
Iraqi  artillery  which was bombarding Marine ground positions near Khafji.
By  the end of the Gulf War the small force AV-8B force had flown more than
3,380  combat sorties, and some 4,000 flying hours.  During this time, they
delivered  more  than 5.9 million pounds of ordnance.  Mission capable rate
averaged 90 per cent.

To stay out of SAM and light AAA fire, AV-8Bs typically flew at an altitude
of around 15,000ft high enough to say out of trouble, but low enough to see
trucks  moving  on  the  ground.   Assigned  a primary and secondary target
within  a  30  by  30  mile "kill box", pairs of aircraft would make diving
attacks  on  their  designated targets.  If these couldn`t be found, pilots
would  follow  the  roads  until they found a target.  Few AGM-65 Mavericks
were used by the AV-8Bs; the best warload turned out to be between four and
six  bombs  mounted  one  per pylon.  These were normally 500lb, 1,000lb or
Rockeye  bombs.   In a typical CCIP attack the weapons would be released at
around  6,000ft  while  the  aircraft  was  flying at around 525kts in a 45
degree  dive.   At first, the AV-8Bs would trade two bombs for Sidewinders,
carrying  four  bombs  plus  two missiles, but the absence of the Iraqi Air
Force  made this a pointless precaution.  The number of Sidewinders carried
was reduced to one under the left wing, then to zero.

Five  AV-8B  were  lost in combat - two from VMA 542, and one each from VMA
231,  311.   and  331.   Two  of  the pilots - Captain James M Wilbourne of
VMA-542,  and  Captain  Reginald  C.   Underwood  of  VMA  331 were killed.
Captains  Michael  C.   Berryman  (VMA-311)  and  Russell  A.   C.  Sanborn
(VMA-231)  were  taken  prisoner,  and  later released, while Captain Scott
Walsh of VMA-542 was rescued.

Combat experience showed that the aircraft's main weakness was the location
of  its  engine nozzles.  Heat-seeking missiles home of the hottest part of
the target which is normally the jet pipe.  On a conventional fighter, hits
from  light  heat-seeking missiles tend to be one the tail but on the AV-8B
the hot jet pipes are much closer to the engine and cockpit area.

Gulf  War  combat  experience  shows  versatility  of  the  unguided  bomb,
particularly  the  Rockeye,  and the wisdom of staying above the ceiling of
light  AAA  weapons.   If  losses  due to heat-seeking SAMs build up during
Operation Ocean Saber, it may be advisable to carry an external chaff/flare
dispenser so that you can drop flares more frequently during your attack.

SECTION X: HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

DEVELOPMENT OF THE HARRIER

At  Britain's  1968  Farnborough  Air Show, three officers of the Us Marine
Corps  walked  into  the  hospitality  suite  of the British company Hawker
Siddeley  Aviation and announced "We're interested in the Harrier".  The US
services  are  not  in  the  habit  of buying jet fighters from an overseas
supplier, but this was the start of a process which would see the US taking
into  service  Britain's revolutionary vertical take off and landing (VTOL)
fighter and which would lead to todays AV- 8B Harrier II.

To  an  Englishman,  the sale of Harrier to the US Marines might be seen as
evidence  that  his nation can still teach the "Yanks" a thing or two about
aviation,  but  in fact US involvement in the Harrier program dates back to
the  late 1950s.  Without US financial assistance, the airplane would never
have left the drawing board.

Back  in  the  mid-1950s, the Cold War was at its peak, and the NATO allies
had  based their air plans on a network of 8,200ft runways based in Western
Europe.  These would have been priority targets in wartime a fact which led
French  airplane  designer  Michel  Wibault  to  purpose  the  Gyroptere, a
ground-attack fighter able to take off and land vertically.

The  idea  of  a  vertical  takeoff and Landing (VTOL) fighter was not new.
Several  experimental  aircraft  had  already  flown, and others were being
built.   Some, like the turboprop-powered Convair XFY-1 and the jet powered
Ryan X-13 Vertijet, were "tail-sitters." From a vertical starting position,
these  climbed  away  from the take-off point under the power of their main
engine, then reversed this manueuvre in order to land.

An  alternative  solution  explored  by  aircraft  such  as the Shorts Sc.1
involved  taking  off  with the fuselage in the normal horizontal position,
the aircraft being raised by a battery of downward-pointing lift engines.

Both  arrangements  had disadvantages.  The pilot of a tail-sitter was in a
most  uncomfortable position.  During take-off and landing - the very times
when  his concentration needed to be at its highest.  This was not the case
with  an  aircraft  which used liftjets; here the problem was that the lift
engines  occupied much of the internal volume of the fuselage, reducing the
amount  of  fuel  which  could  be carried, and for much of the flight were
simply unwanted dead weight.

Wibault  proposed to get around these problems by using vectored thrust.  A
single  huge engine whose thrust was greater than the aircraft weight could
lift  the aircraft if its thrust could be directed downward, then propel it
in normal flight by directing the thrust rearward.

This  idea  had been tested in 1954 with the twin-engined Bell Model 65 Air
Test Vehicle, and would be explored further in the new Bell X-14 then under
construction  in  the USA, but these aircraft were too small to perform any
military  task.  On the tiny Model 65, the two J44 jet engines were mounted
outside   of   the   fuselage   and   could   be  moved  from  rearward  or
downward-thrusting   positions.    For   the   X-14,   two  British-  built
Armstrong-Siddeley Viper turbojets would be mounted side by side within the
forward fuselage, discharging their exhaust through belly mounted steerable
cascade nozzles.

In  a conventional aircraft, safety is improved by having multiple engines.
If  one  fails,  the  aircraft can keep flying.  This isn't the case with a
VTOL  aircraft  any significant loss of thrust while in the hover will turn
that  hover  into  a  crash.   Having multiple engines simply increases the
chance  of  an engine failure.  This was the problem faced by 1950s designs
such as the Model 65, the X-14, and the Shorts SC.1, and by todays Yakovlev
Yak 38 Forger and Yak 141 Freestyle V/STOL fighters.

For  the  Gyroptere, Wibault planned that the thrust would be generated not
by  several jet engines but by four steerable air blowers, all mechanically
driven  by the most powerful engine he could find - the Bristol Orion rated
at around 8,000hp at sea level, this would be connected to the blowers by a
system  of  shafts  and  bevel  gears.   The  four  blowers would be angled
downwards  to provide the thrust needed for vertical takeoff then turned to
face aft to create the power for conventional flight.

Conventional control surfaces such as ailerons, elevators and rudder obtain
their  effect  by  deflecting  the  rapid  flow  of  air passing around the
aircraft's  wings,  tail fins, and rudder.  When the Gyroptere was hovering
or  flying  at  low  speed, they would be useless.  Wibault realised that a
practical VTOL aircraft would require a second control system for low speed
flight  and  hovering.   He  proposed  to fit the aircraft with a system of
nose,  tail,  and wingtip mounted reaction control jets.  Fed by compressed
air,  these would be used to maintain control until the airplane was flying
fast enough for conventional control surfaces to take over.

Unwilling to fund such as novel airplane, the French suggested that Wibault
apply  for  funding from the Mutual Weapons Development Programme (MWDP), a
scheme  under which the US could fund promising foreign weapons.  Gyroptere
was  too complex to be practical, but gave two British companies Hawker and
Bristol Aero Engines the inspiration to devise a more sensible design.

Bristol  engineers  looked at Wibault's proposal, and decided his estimated
weight  of  only  1,0801b  for  the  four  blowers  and bevel gearboxes was
unrealistic.   Instead,  they proposed that the Orion engine should drive a
single  large  fan section "borrowed" from the companys much larger Olympus
engine.   This in turn passed its output of compressed air to two steerable
nozzles.

Hardly  had  this  BE.48  engine  been  sketched out on the Bristol drawing
boards  when  Hooker  realised  that Bristol's new Orpheus jet engine would
make  an even better power source than the Orion.  This BE.52 engine design
was equally short-lived.  The improved BE.53 eliminated the gearbox used to
drive the fan.  Instead, the fan was driven by its own turbine stage.

The idea of using a second turbine was not new.  Until 1949 all jet engines
had  used  a  single  shaft.   Air from the inlet was compressed by a multi
stage  compressor whose airflow entered a combustor section, where the fuel
was  burned.   The  hot efflux gases leaving the combustor passed through a
turbine used to drive the compressor, before passing to the jetpipe.

This  layout  was  simple,  but  the rotational speed of the turbine-driven
shaft  which  drove  the  compressor  was  always  a compromise between the
optimum  speed  needed  by the early stages of the compressor and the speed
best for the later stages which were handling a higher pressure airflow.

In  1949  two  engine  manufacturers  Pratt & Whitney and Bristol Engines -
tested  new  engines  which introduced a twin-shaft layout, a configuration
still  used  for  most  present-day aero engines.  A low- pressure (LP) fan
feeds  air  to a high-pressure (HP) compressor.  After fuel has been burned
in  this  HP airflow the hot gases pass through an HP turbine used to drive
the  HP  compressor,  then  an  LP  turbine which drives the LP fan, before
passing to the jetpipe.  The two section of the engine - LP and HP can each
rotate at the speed which gives highest efficiency.

On  the  B.53  the fan did not feed the HP compressor.  All its air went to
the  two  large steerable nozzles.  Two small inlets mounted directly above
and  below  the  fan were used to feed air to the Orpheus section whose hot
exhaust  gas  was  released  from  a  rearward-facing  jetpipe just as in a
conventional  engine.   Since  all the compression was done by a compressor
which  was entirely driven by a single shaft and turbine, the BE.53 was not
a  true  two-shaft engine, but it promised enough power to allow the design
of a warplane.

In  the spring of 1957, the Hawker team led by Sir Sidney Camm, designer of
the  World  War II Hurricane, Typhoon and Tempest piston- engined fighters,
drew up plans for what was then known as the P.1127.  With its ugly tadpole
shaped  fuselage,  unswept mid set wing, and tail wheel undercarriage, this
design  looked more like the primitive jet fighters of the mid 194Os than a
combat  aircraft  for  the  196Os.  Air from the nose inlet entered a BE.53
engine in the lower part of the centre fuselage.  The two steerable nozzles
were  located  on  either side of the fuselage directly under the wing, the
jetpipe emerging from the lower fuselage just aft of the wing.  A slim rear
fuselage led to a tail assembly which would not have looked out of place on
a Second World War piston engined fighter.

Since only part of the thrust of the BE.53 was vectorable, the aircraft was
designed  for  short  rather  than  vertical  take-offs  and landings.  Its
take-off and landing speeds would be too low for aerodynamic controls to be
effective,  so  Camm's team planned to feed some of the fan air to a system
of  nose,  tail, and wingtip-mounted reaction control jets similar to those
first proposed by Wibault.  Too small and lacking in engine thrust to carry
a warload, the P1127 was proposed as a lightweight reconnaissance aircraft.

While  this design work was going on, back at Bristol Engines, Hookers team
had  come  up with further improvements.  In a normal two shaft engine, the
task  of the fan stage is to provide LP air for the HP compressor.  The new
engine  now  being  sketched out on Bristol drawing boards had an oversized
fan  which produced enough LP to feed not only a pair of steerable nozzles,
but  also the HP compressor.  Having passed through the HP and LP turbines,
the hot engine efflux entered not a single conventional jetpipe, but a pair
of   steerable  aft  nozzles.   All  four  nozzles  of  this  "four-poster"
arrangement  could be simultaneously moved so that they pointed downward to
provide  the  vertical  thrust  needed for VTOL, then backward to power the
airplane for normal flight.

This  new  engine  allowed  the  Hawker team to make a fresh start.  By the
autumn  of  1957  they  had  created  a  design  able  to take off and land
vertically.   Although  the wing was still unswept, it was recognisably the
ancestor of today's AV-8B Harrier II.

The  new airplane and engine could not have been born at a worse time.  The
British  Government  had  just  decided that the manned combat aircraft was
obsolete, and opted to cancel virtually all its current warplane programmes
in favor of guided missiles.  The idea of a VTOL fighter fell on deaf ears.

US  defense planners rejected the British idea of all-missile air forces as
naive,  and  agreed  to  meet 75 per cent of the cost of developing the new
airplane  and  its  engine.   Refused  British  funding,  the  two  partner
companies  used  their own money to make up the remaining 25 per cent.  Not
until  late  1959  did  the  British  government agree to help fund the two
P.1127 prototypes taking shape at Hawker's Kingston factory.

Camm  and  his  team  wanted  to  create  not just a flying testbed able to
demonstrate  V/STOL  technology  but  an  airplane  which could serve as an
operational  fighter.  The structure was built strong enough for combat and
with  the  internal  volume  needed  to  allow  the installation of mission
related  avionics.   The  problem they faced was that in any VTOL airplane,
the  total  weight  at  takeoff must be less than the thrust created by the
engine.   Get  the  airplane too heavy or be faced with an engine unable to
develop  the specified thrust, and it will refuse to fly a fate not unknown
in the history of VTOL aircraft!

In  September  1959 the new engine, now named Pegasus 1, started running on
the  test  bench.  It developed only 9,000lb of thrust, but showed that the
concept  of  a  "four  poster"  vectored-thrust  engine  worked.  An engine
suitable for flight would have to generate more thrust, plus a supply of HP
rather than LP air for the reaction control system.  Studies had shown that
the  amount  of  LP  air  needed  for  reaction control would reduce engine
performance, and require bulky ducting to feed it to the wingtip, nose, and
tail reaction jets.  To be practical the system would have to be redesigned
to use high-pressure air drawn from the engine's HP section.

To  provide  the extra thrust and a source of HP bleed air, Bristol devised
the  Pegasus  2 engine, which ran for the first time in February 1960.  The
best  that  Bristol  designer  Stanley Hooker could promise was 11,0001b of
thrust  giving  Camm  the  problem  of  packing  this  large engine into an
airplane  about the weight of a Korean-War-era F-86 Sabre.  Redesigning the
reaction  control system was not easy.  The HP bleed air from the Pegasus 2
was  available  in  the  quantities needed to do the job.  and at pressures
high  enough to allow small and compact ducting.  Unfortunately it left the
engine  at  a  temperature  of  around  660  deg F, so had to be ducted via
pipework  made  from  Nimonic  alloy a material originally designed for use
inside jet engines.

By  October  1960, the first P.1127 airplane was ready to fly.  It left the
ground  for the first time on October 21st, beginning the first of a series
of  tethered  tests intended to explore handling in the vertical mode.  The
margin  between aircraft weight and engine thrust was very low during these
first  flights,  allowing  enough  fuel  for  only  two minutes of hovering
flight.   By  early  November,  test pilot Bill Bedford and the P.1127 team
were  ready  to try free flight.  To do this involved the additional weight
of  installing a radio in the cockpit at a time when every pound was vital.
The  first  untethered  flight  was on November 19th.  Soon afterwards, the
British  government  finally  agreed to pay for a batch of four development
aircraft.   Bristol  -  know  known  as Bristol Siddeley also increased the
thrust  of  the  engine  by  a  further  1,000lb,  allowing more fuel to be
carried.

Next stage was to try the airplane out in normal flight.  This phase of the
test  program  started on March 13th 1961, clearing the way for the team to
cautiously  explore  the  problem  of  making  the  way for the vertical to
horizontal  flight  and  back again.  On some hovering flights, the nozzles
were  rotated backward to give the aircraft a forward velocity while during
others  made  from the runway the nozzles were deflected downwards to allow
the  aircraft to fly more slowly, eventually bringing it to speeds at which
its   aerodynamic   control  surfaces  had  little  effect,  control  being
maintained using the puffer jets.

During  a  six  month series of tests using both P.1127 prototypes, the gap
between  the  highest speed attained from the hover and the lowest achieved
in  horizontal  flight  gradually  narrowed, until the first transition was
demonstrated  on  20th  September  1961.   For  todays  AV-8B  pilots, this
maneuver  has  become routine and its one you`ll have to learn to carry out
in seconds.

Early  in  1961,  the  NATO  allies  released  a  specification  for  a new
supersonic  close-support  airplane  able to operate from rough strips some
200  yards  long.   Hawker  had already started work on a supersonic P.1150
design.   Power by an improved Pegasus engine with afterburning in all four
nozzles,   this   would   have   been   a  practical  and  useful  fighter.
Unfortunately its top speed would have been around Mach 1.3 rather than the
then-fashionable Mach 2.  It was never ordered.

By the end of the year, Hawker Siddeley had drawn up plans for the improved
P.1154  -  an  aircraft  which combined the Mach 2.0 performance of the F-4
Phantom  with  the  VTOL  ability  of  the  P.1127.  To power this, Bristol
Siddeley started work on a more powerful engine - the BS.100.

Worried  that the P.1127 concept might be abandoned if left to the British,
around the end of the year the US suggested that a batch of P.1127 be built
to  equip  a proposed tri-national US/UK/West German trials squadron.  Work
started  on a batch of nine aircraft built to an improved design designated
Kestrel.   These  would  have  swept wings and the uprated 15,200lb thrust.
Pegasus  5  engine, but would still not be able to carry a usefull ordnance
load.

Britian  pressed  ahead  with the supersonic P.1154, which was intended for
use by both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy and even started work on
a C-130-sized short-take-off and landing transport aircraft able to support
P.1154  operations.   It  was an ambitious concept and one which would even
strain  today`s  technology  let alone that of the mid 1960s.  In practice.
getting  the  Air  Force  and  Navy  to  agree  on joint design proved near
impossible,  and the commonality between the two versions rapidly dwindled.
Late in 1963 the Navy dropped out of the program and an order for McDonnell
Douglas F-4 Phantoms was announced in February 1964.

Work  continued  on  the  Air  Force  version,  which was expected to enter
servive  in  1969.   The  arrival  in  power  in  late  1964 of a Socialist
Government  intent  on  abandoning  most  of the nation's military aircraft
programmes  resulted  in  both  the P.1154 and the Hawker Siddeley 681 STOL
transport being cancelled in 1965 before either had flown.

F-4  Phantoms  were ordered for both British services, but the go-ahead was
also  given  for  the  subsonic P.1127 to be taken into service as a combat
airplane.  It was to use some of the nav/attack systems being developed for
the  P.1154, and be powered by the latest 19,000lb thrust Pegasus 6 engine.
Six development aircraft were ordered in February 1965.

Between  the  spring  of  1965  and the spring of 1966 the Kestrel-equipped
tri-national  squadron  explored  the military usefulness of VTOL aircraft,
flying  around 600 hours for the loss of a single airplane.  After the unit
disbanded,  six of its aircraft were despatched to the USA for trials under
the designation XV-6A, while the others stayed in Britain.  Flying from the
carrier,  Independence,  and  the  assault ships Raleigh and La Salle XV-6A
proved the potential usefulness of a naval VTOL fighter.

The first of the six development P.1127 first flew on August 31st, 1966.  A
batch of 60 production aircraft was ordered early in 1967, and the first of
the  resulting  Harrier GR.1 aircraft flew on December 28th, 1967.  A total
of  114  GR.1's  were  delivered to the RAF, where they remained in service
until replaced by the AV-8B Harrier II in the early 1990s.

In  1968  the USMC realised that the XV-6A tests had showed the feasibility
of  deploying  an  operational VTOL fighter:  Unlike the other US Services,
the  Marines  are  an  offensive  force,  one  designed  to  seize and hold
beachheads.   The  fire  support  they  need must travel with them.  Marine
Forces  can't  take  with them the massive artillery support which the Army
takes for granted, so strike aircraft must provide the close-support needed
to soften up an enemy position, or to break an enemy attack.

In  the  past,  USMC  aircraft  had  operated from carriers, but the P.1127
Harrier  was an airplane which could be deployed from assault ships or even
improvised  airstrips  close to the front line.  At first, Congress refused
to  allocate  money  for Harriers, but the Marines pressed ahead with their
evaluation of the airplane while arguing their case.

When  Congress  finally  did agree to authorise the purchase of 12 Harriers
for  test  and evaluation by the USMC, it insisted that any follow-on order
for  production  aircraft  would  have to be placed with a US manufacturer.
Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas signed a licence-production agreement
for  the  airplane, while the other deal between Rolls-Royce (who had taken
over  Bristol)  and  Pratt  & Whitney covered US manufacture of the Pegasus
engine.   In  practice  however  the  cost  of  setting  up  US  production
facilities  for  the planned USMC fleet of 102 single-seaters and eight two
seat  trainers  was  so  high that Congress relented, and the aircraft were
purchased from Britian.

By  now  the  RAF  had  progressed  from  the  original Harrier GR.1 to the
improved  GR.1A  (with  the  Pegasus  102 engine), then the definitive GR.3
(with  the  21,000lb thrust Pegasus 103 and additional avionics).  The USMC
version  was  similar  to the GR.3, but did not have the nose mounted laser
ranger  and  marked-target  seeker  fitted to the RAF Aircraft.  The single
seater was designated AV-8A, with the two seater becoming the TAV-8A.

A  further  batch of 13 aircraft was purchased in the early 1970s by Spain.
Ordered by the US Navy in order to spare Britain's socialist government the
political  embarrassment  of  selling weaponry to a right wing regime, they
were  transferred to Spain where they remain in service as AV-8S and TAV-8S
Matadors.   They  entered  service  on  the elderly carrier Dedalo, and now
serve on its replacement, the Principe de Asturias.

The  Marines  use  the  AV-8A  in the close-support role, but what Britains
Royal  Navy  now  needed  was  a  VTOL fighter able to operate from the new
Invincible  class  light  carriers.  Ordered in May 1975, this was based on
the GR.3/AV-8A, but incorporated a raised cockpit, a nose- mounted blue fox
radar, and a marinised Pegasus 11 Mk 104 version of the Mk103 used to power
the  Royal  Air  Force's Harrier GR.3.  The Blue Fox radar was designed for
the task of detecting high altitude targets such as maritime reconnaissance
aircraft,  and  had  none  of the expensive technology needed for look down
operation against low level strike aircraft.

First  flight  of  a  Sea  Harrier  prototype  was  on  20th  Augnst  1978.
Deliveries  to  the  Royal Navy began in June 1979, and the aircraft became
operational  in 1980, first on the carrier Invincible, then on sister ships
Illustrious  and  Ark  Royal.   In its FRS.51 Form, it also serves with the
Indian  Navy  which  purchased 23 (plus four two-seat trainers) for servive
aboard the carriers Vikrant and Viraat.

Both  Britian  and  the US realised that their existing fleets of AV-8A and
Harrier  Gr.1/3  would need to be replaced in the 1980s, so the two nations
had  already  started  work  on  studies  of  a  "Super Harrier".  In 1973,
McDonnell  Douglas  started  preliminary work with British Aerospace (which
had  absorbed  Hawker  Siddeley)  to  develop  an  inproved  version of the
airplane.   The  AV-16A  would  have had a long- span supercritical wing, a
25,000lb   (11,350kg)  Pegasus  15  engine,  and  twice  the  payload/range
performance of the existing aircraft.

The  two  countries were unable to agree on a common design.  In the United
States  the  Marines wanted the most efficient VTOL close- support airplane
which  technology  would permit, but Britain's RAF wanted a design to which
its existing aircraft could be rebuilt.  Not surprisingly in March 1975 the
British  Government  announced  that  there  was  not  enough common ground
between the two requirements to justify a joint programme.

At  this  point  Britain  and  the  US pursued their own national programs.
British  Aerospace  drew  up  plans for what became known as the "Big Wing"
Harrier.   This  would  have had a revised front fuselage, extended intakes
and  a  new  34ft  (10.4m)  span wing of metal construction.  Optimised for
high-speed  flight,  this  enlarged  wing  would have been retrofittable to
existing aircraft.
 
In  the  US,  McDonnell  Douglas pressed ahead with a less expensive design
which  would  combine a new airframe incorporating refined aerodynamics and
the  large-scale  use  of carbon composites with a developed version of the
Sea Harrier engine.  This would be known as the AV-8B Harrier II.

The  cockpit was raised to improve the view back over the inlets and wing a
vital feature in air combat - while a new longer span wing with 15 per cent
more  area  than  that  of the AV-8A produced more lift and less drag.  The
inlets  were redesigned, while under the skin, a new generation oF avionics
promised  better  reliability.  Internal fuel capacity was 50 per cent more
than  that  of  the  AV-8A.   To  minimum  weight,  almost a quarter of the
structure was made not from metal but from carbon composite materials.

To speed the programme, the first two YAV-8B prototypes were not built from
scratch,  but  were  created  by  fitting the new wing to two AV- 8As.  The
first flew on 9 November 1978.  Flight demonstrations were completed during
1979  with  the  two  prototypes  having  flown  more  than  170 test hours
successfully.

The  aircraft  did  have  problems,  but  these  were political rather than
technical.   The Carter administration was opposed to the development of an
aircraft  customised to meet the relatively small Marine requirement.  When
drawing  up  the  Fiscal  Year  1979  Defense  Budget Request, the Pentagon
refused  to  add  funding  for  the  AV-8B.   Instead it suggested that the
Marines  buy  a  batch  of 78 McDonnell Douglas A-4M Skyhawks, and increase
their order for the F/A-18 Hornet.  This would help reduce the unit cost of
the  latter  aircraft,  and  help  keep  the  Skyhawk production line open.
Congress disagreed, and restored funding for the AV-8B.

The  following  year  saw  this  process  repeated,  with the Department of
Defense   refusing   the   $203   million  requested  for  continued  AV-8B
development.   Congress  forced  the release of $108 million held over from
the  previous year and added a further $180 million for FY80.  This allowed
a full scale development contract to be issued in April 1979.

A  year  later  Congress  again  over-ruled  the  Carter administration and
provided  not  only the $240.7 million needed for the FY81 development work
but  also  $90  million  for procurement of "long-lead" production hardware
which  would  have  to  be ordered now to allow procurement of the first 12
aircraft.

By  now  it  was clear that the aircraft's long-term future would depend on
its  becoming  an international program.  The obvious customer was Britian.
In  1980,  the  Royal  Air Force evaluated the aircraft, and concluded that
although  the  aircraft  met the performance standard laid down by Britians
Air  Staff Requirement 409 (ASR 409) in most respects, it was badly lacking
in one area - maneuverability.

The  AV-8B  had  been tailored to meet a US Marine Corps requirement for an
efficient  "bomb truck" able to carry a heavier payload over a longer range
than  had  been  possible with the AV-8A.  In USMC service, the AV-8B would
operate  under the protection of friendly fighters such as the Grumman F-14
Tomcat  and  McDonnell  Douglas  F/A  18  Hornet, but the British wanted an
aircraft  able to fight in Central Europe, where friendly fighters would be
outnumbered by Soviet MiGs

Any  Harrier  replacement  would  have  to be able to defend itself the RAF
decided   so   ASR  409  placed  strong  emphasis  on  maneuverability  and
survivability  for  defensive  air combat performance.  Turn rate of the US
aircraft  was  well  below the 20 degree per second turn rate which the RAF
thought  essential  if  the Harrier was to be able to defend itself against
enemy air superiority fighters.

As  well  as  idetifying  the problem, the British also offered a potential
solution.  The metal wing of the proposed "Big Wing" Harrier - now known as
the Harrier GR.5 would have incorporated wing leading- edge root extensions
(LERXs),  features  intended  to  increase maneuverability.  Studies showed
that by adding similar LERXs to the AV-8B wing, the airplane would meet the
RAF  maneuvrability  requirement  without  jeopardising  the  payload/range
requirement needed by the Marines.

In the summer of 1981, the UK agreed to rejoin the programme, and to buy at
least  60 AV-8B fighters.  British aircraft would be known as Harrier GR.5,
the  designation originally proposed for the "Big Wing" Harrier.  Under the
terms  of  a  deal  announced  in July 1981, the UK agreed to contribute an
initial  $80  million  to  the costs of a joint development program, and to
provide  the  additional $200 million needed for development work unique to
the RAF version.

BAe  would  set  up a production line in England to build the RAF aircraft,
and  would  be  responsible for manufacture of the rear and center fuselage
sections,  center-line  pylon  and  the  reaction  control system.  Fin and
rudder  assemblies may also be included.  Under this work-sharing agreement
McDonnell  Douglas  would  manufacture  approximately  60  per  cent of the
aircraft, BAe the remaining 40 per cent.  Work on the engine would be split
in  a similar manner, with 75 per cent going to Rolls-Royce and 25 per cent
to Pratt & Whitney.

To  keep the existing AV-8A fleet effective until the AV-8B entered service
in   the   mid-1980s,   the  Marines  embarked  on  a  conversion  in  Lieu
ofProcurement  (CILOP) program to rebuild existing aircraft to the improved
AV-8C   standard.    Changes   included  the  installation  of  LIDS  (Lift
Improvement  Devices), plus installation of new avionics such as the AN/ARC
159  radio,  KY-28  crypto  set,  the ALR-45 radar warning receiver and the
ALE-39 flare/chaff dispenser.

The  F402-RR-406  Pegasus 11-2IE engine used in early production AV- 8Bs is
based  on  the  Mk  104 developed for Sea Harrier, but is designed to match
mounting  points  on the AV-8B airframe.  It also incorporates a redesigned
fan  able to run at higher RPM.  It also has new zero scarf cold nozzles, a
revised  swan-neck  intermediate  casing which smooths the flow of air into
the high-pressure compressor a forged combustion chamber, better HP turbine
cooling.   a new shrouded LP turbine and improved seals.  Maximum thrust is
21,500lb

The first true AV-8B was the first of four full scale development aircraft.
It  flew for the first time on November 5, 1981.  All four were sent to the
Naval  Air  Test Center during 1982 to begin a program of flight test.  The
first  of  12 pre-production airplanes flew on August 29, 1983.  A two-seat
TAV-8B version was also developed to help train Marine pilots.

Wherever  possible,  the  AV-8B  uses  off-the-shelf avionics.  Like Marine
pilots assigned to fly the AV-8B, you`ll have to become familiar with these
systems.   Prime  attack  sensor  is  the  Hughes Angle Rate Bombing System
(ARBS),  a  nose-mounted  unit  which  combines a laser spot tracker and TV
contrast  tracker.   This allows day or night attacks to be delivered using
conventional bombs, laser-guided "smart" bombs, unguided rockets, or guided
missiles  such  as the Hughes AGM-65 Maverick.  Navigation is handled by an
ASN-130 inertial- navigation system.

Harrier Gr.3 and the AV-8A had no autopilot, but the AB-8B is fitted with a
unit  known  as  the  Stability  Augmentation  and  Attitude  Hold  System.
Intended  to  reduce  the pilot's workload by about two-thirds, this allows
easier  and  safer hovering and vertical landings.  The pilot can even take
his hands off the controls while the airplane is hovering.

Many  of  the  cockpit  systems were already used on the F/A-18 Hornet, and
include  the head up display (HUD), a multi-function cathode-ray tube (CRT)
cockpit   display   and   an   Up   Front  Control  (UFC)  panel  used  for
communications, navigation, and weapons control.  In the AB-8B cockpit, the
engine throttle and nozzles are operated from a single control to allow the
pilot  to keep his attention focused outside the cockpit during air combat.
Under  this  HOTAS  (hands-on  throttle and stick) scheme the pilot will be
able  to  fly  "viffing"  (vectoring  in  forward flight) combat maneuvers.
Without  looking  down,  he  can  control  the airplanes maneuvering flaps,
select and steer the aircraft sensors, acquire targets, release weapons and
aim the guns.

For  self  protection,  the  AV-8B  is  fitted with an ALB-67 radar-warning
reciever  designed  to  detect  hostile radar signals.  Mounted in the rear
fuselage  is  an  ALE  39  dispenser able to release radar reflecting chaff
designed  to confuse enemy radars, or hot-burning flares able to decoy heat
seeking  missiles.   The aircraft is due to receive the internally- mounted
ALQ-165  Advanced  Self-Protection  Jammer  (ASPJ),  but  delivery  of this
complex  system  has  been  repeatedly  delayed.   (The  RAF version of the
airplane  carries  the  British-designed  Zeus  jamming  system).   For the
moment, the Marines rely on the externally-mounted ALQ-164 jamming pod.

In 1984, McDonnell Douglas started work to create a night-attack version of
the  AV-8B.   This  was  done  by  adding  a  nose-mounted  Forward looking
Infra-Red  (FLIR) system, and equipping the pilot with Night Vision Goggles
(NVGs).   These  systems  are  now standard in current production aircraft,
while earlier examples will be modified to add these.

The  Marines  took  delivery of their first AV-8B in 1984, and the aircraft
became  operational  with  the  USMC's  VMA-331 Bumblebees in 1985.  In its
Harrier  GR.5 form, the aircraft became operational with Britians Royal Air
Force  in  1989.   A  total  of 94 are planned.  Spain ordered 12 EAV-8B to
replace  the  older AV-8A, and these are now in service aboard the aircraft
carrier Principe de Asturias.

In  its  basic  form,  the  aircraft  was  intended  for use by day, but in
September  1989  the USMC took delivery of the first version configured for
night  attack.   A  similar  night-attack version known as the Harrier GR.7
entered service with the Royal Air Force in the following year.

The  new avionics needed to give the pilot a view of the outside world were
developed  in  the  UK.   A  nose-mounted  forward-looking Infra red (FLIR)
creates  an  image of the terrain ahead of the aircraft.  This is displayed
on  the  HUD  as  a  full-sized  image directly superimposed on the outside
scene.   Flying  an  aircraft using only the small area visible through the
HUD  would be difficult, so the pilot also wears night vision goggles which
provide  a  lower-grade  thermal  image  of  the  outside world in whatever
direction  the  pilot  is looking.  This version of the aircraft has a more
powerful  engine, the 23,800lb thrust Pegasus 11-61 known to the US Marines
as the F404-RR 408.

In  AV-8B  Harrier  Assault,  you'll  be  flying  this night-attack capable
version  of the aircraft, the most modern variant currently in service.  An
even  more  advanced  version  known  as  the AV-8B Harrier II plus started
flight  trials  on 22 September 1992, but this will not enter service until
the  mid-1990s.   Main  change  in  this  new  version is a reprofiled nose
containing an APG 65 multi mode radar.

The Marines intend to take delivery of up to 40 AV-8B Plus.  Italy plans to
buy  15  single-seat  and  two twin-seat Harrier II Plus for service on the
carrier  Giuseppe  Garibaldi,  and  could increase this order to around 30.
The  Spanish  Navy  expects  to  operate  12  AV-8B Plus, but will probably
rebuild its existing EAV-8B to this standard rather than buy new airframes.
Japan is known to be interested in the aircraft.

Production  of  the  AV-8B is expected to run into the early 1990s by which
time  the  Marines  will  have  taken  delivery  of 300 AV-8B and 28 TAV-8B
trainers.   Under present plans, 156 of these aircraft will be built to the
night-attack  standard.   To  bring older aircraft up to this standard, the
USMC  plans a rebuild program.  A first phase will install the night attack
avionics; a second could add the APG-65 radar.
 
Britian  will  rebuild  its  Harrier GR.5 aircraft to the GR.7 night attack
standard  but haSs no plan to add a radar as part of a mid-life improvement
programme,  31 Royal Navy Sea Harriers are being rebuilt to FRS.2 standard,
receiving  a  British-developed  Blue  Vixen  pulse  Doppler  radar able to
provide  all-weather look-down capability track while scan, and the ability
to  engage  several  targets  simulaneously using up to four AIM-120 AMRAAM
missiles.   Other changes include a lengthened rear fuselage (to compensate
for  the  enlarged  nose needed to house Blue Vixen), a redesigned cockpit,
and an improved radar-warning receiver

THE REBELLION IN EAST TIMOR

In  August 1975 civil war broke out in the colony of Portuguese Timor.  The
eastern  section  of  the islands which make up the Indonesian archipelago,
Timor had first been settled by Portuguese colonists in 1586.  In 1859, the
island  was  divided  between  the  Netherlands and Portugal.  In 1949, the
western  (Dutch)  portion  joined  the  then  new state of Indonesia, whose
independence had finally been recognised by the Netherlands.

For Indonesia, the continued presence of the Portuguese in Timor remained a
sensitive  issue.   Portuguese  Timor  was  run  as an overseas province of
Portugal,  and  until  1975  no  steps  had  been  taken  to  promote  self
government.   Portugal  finally  decided  in 1975 that it would pull out in
1978,  and  announced  plans to hold local elections for a planned People's
Assembly.

Unfortunately  the  three  main  political factions in Portugese Timor ware
unable  to  agree  as to what form independence should take.  The Associcao
Popular  Democratica  de  Timor  (APODETi)  wanted  the colony to become an
autonomous  province  of  Indonesia,  while  the Uniao Democratica de Timor
(UDT)  favoured  independence  but  retaining links with Portugal.  A third
party  the  Frente  Revolucionario  de  Este  Timor Independente (FRETLiN),
wanted total independence

On August 11th 1975, the UTD announced that it had taken over the colony in
a coup.  Fighting broke out several days later and by the 20th had become a
full  blown  civil  war between FRETLIN on one side and an alliance between
the UDT APODETI and several smaller parties on the other

By  November  28th,  FRETLIN  was  able  announce  the  establishment  of a
"Democratic  Republic of East Timor", but the new state would last for less
than  a  month.   On  December  7th  a  force  of  around  6,000 Indonesian
paratroops  supported  by  bombardments  from Indonesian warships operating
offshore invaded the new republic, and seized Dili the capital.

Four  days  later,  the  United Nations demanded that Indonesia desist from
"furthur  violation of the territorial integrity of East Timor" and ordered
it to withdraw.  Indonesia would admit that its Army was in action claiming
that  the  attack  on  Dili  had been mounted by APODETI, UDT and what were
described as "Indonesian volunteers."

The formation of a "Provisional Government" for East Timor was announced on
December  17th.   Four days later the UN Security Council voted unanimously
for a Resolution calling for a total withdrawal by Indonesian forces.  This
was rejected by Indonesia, which has ignored many subsequent UN Resolutions
on East Timor.

By  mid  February  1976.   the  take  over  of  East  Timor was essentially
completed.   On  May 31st the newly formed "People's Representative Council
of  East Timor" held a meeting which had only a single item on the agenda -
a petition that East Timor be absorbed by Indonesia.

In  a ceremony reminiscent of the colonial era, an Indonesian "fact finding
mission" which arrived on June 24th was handed a portion of East Timor soil
and  a  nugget of gold.  Five days later, Indonesia announced acceptance of
East  Timor  and the existence of the new province was proclaimed on August
17th.

Just over a week later, Indonesian leader Suharto admitted that FRETLIN was
still   fighting.   Two  months  later,  the  Indonesian  Defense  Minister
described  FRETLIN as a "band of bandits" who would be eliminated in two to
three  months.   In  practice,  the  Indonesian  Army was to mount repeated
offensives  against  FRETLIN  over the next few years, the largest being in
1978 and the fall of 1981.

1982  produced  the first reports of human rights violations by Indonesia,
with 4,000 Timorese being held in prison camps on the island of Atauro.  By
this  time, Indonesia estimated that FRETLIN had been reduced to a force of
around  130  combatants,  while  the  guerrillas  claimed  a  force  of six
companies  - about 6,800 in total.  Independent observers suggested figures
ranging  from  200  to 600.  The province seemed quite in the first half of
1983, but fighting broke out again that August.

The mid 1980s saw growing reports of further human rights violations - mass
arrests,  "resettlement  programs",  the  execution of FRETLIN sympathisers
executions   during  the  military  operations,  conscription  of  Timorese
civilians  into  the  Indonesian  Army.  These heavy handed tactics seem to
have  worked.   On 27th December 1988, Indonesia announced that the FRETLiN
rebellion  was  finally  over.   Travel  restrictions  in the area would be
lifted, and the region demilitarized.

In  October  of  that  year  Pope  John  Paul II visited Indonesia, and the
authorities  suppressed  pro Timor demonstrations during his visit.  To the
Indonesian  Government, the most disturbing feature of these demonstrations
must  have  been the relative youth of the agitators many of whom must have
been  children  at  the  time  of  the 1985 invasion .  A new generation of
Timorese was taking up the struggle for independence.

A  program  of  settling  non-Timorese  in  the  region caused protests and
demonstrations in 1990.  A report by Amnesty International in the following
year  spoke  of  an "accelerating program of short term detention, torture,
and ill treatment of political opponents".

On  November  12,  troops  opened  fire  in Dili on a crowd of around 3,500
demonstrators.  The number killed has never been fully established.  At the
time,  the  Indonesian Army claimed 19 deaths, and blamed the incident on a
"misunderstood order" Opposition groups estimated the death toll at between
60  and  180.   A later official investigation by the Indonesian government
put the figure at 50.

Human  rights  groups claimed that within days of the massacre, between 300
and  400 people had been arrested, and that between 60 and 80 were executed
on  November 15.  By late November, claims were being voiced that more than
200 had been executed.

By  this  time,  East Timor had been a closed territory for 13 years.  Some
human  rights  groups  have estimated the number of East Timorese killed or
who have died of starvation in the long-running campaign at around 200,000.
FRETLIN  has  offered  a  cease-fire,  but  this  has  been rejected by the
Indonesian Government.

The  stalemate  continues.   The  rebels  lack  the  strength to defeat the
Indonesian  Army  but that Army in turn has failed to reduce rebel strength
in more than a decade of struggle.  If the people of East Timor are ever to
be  given the chance to decide their own future, this can only be done with
the help of the international community

In  1992,  Portugal  asked President Bush to apply pressure to Indonesia to
persuade  that  nation to accept the many UN resolutions on East Timor, but
with a Presidential election looming and his own poll rating slipping there
was  little,  in  practice,  the US President could do.  For the moment the
problems  of  East  Timor  remain  on  the  international communities "back
burner"
