                           THE Vidi-AMIGA 12 UNIT

    At the front of the unit, you can see a 25 way (male) connector. This
connects the unit to the Amiga`s parallel port (A1500 - A4000 owners may
have to fit a short extension ribbon cable).
    Also on the right hand side of the unit, looking from the front, is a
small hole which is a preset brightness control. Do not adjust this unless
the video  video picture is very dark.
    From the back of the unit you can see the two different types of Video
in sockets.
    Plus the disk drive cable which is used to power the Vidi-Amiga 12
    The spare hole at the right hand side of the unit is for a sound sampler
upgrade.

                        SETTING UP THE Vidi-AMIGA 12

              Please follow these instructions carefully.

    1.   First take the software disk and make a backup of it. (Please
         consult your Amiga manual for details on how to do this).
         Once this is done, only use the backup copy and keep the original
         disk in a safe place.
         Note: the backup disk should have the same name as the original
         ROMBO disk.

    2.   SWITCH OFF the Amiga and fit the Vidi-Amiga 12 to the Parallel Port
         at the back of  your Amiga.
         If you have an A1500, A3000 or A4000 you may have to fit a short
         extension cable between the Vidi-Amiga 12 and the Parallel Port.

    3.   The cable connected to the Vidi-Amiga 12 must be plugged into the
         Disk Drive connector at the back of your Amiga (if you use an
         external disk drive which has a through connector, you may plug it
         in there).

    4a.  FLOPPY DISK USERS : Switch on the Amiga, insert the disk into DF0:
         and the Vidi-Amiga 12 software will auto boot. If you normally boot
         up from a Workbench disk then you will have to run INSTALL
         (Workbench 1.3 users must use INSTALLWB1.3 instead) program
         supplied first and follow its instructions.

PAGE 3

    4b.  HARD DISK USERS: Before you can use the program, you will either
         have to auto boot from the floppy disk or use the supplied INSTALL
         (Workbench 1.3 users must use INSTALLWB1.3 instead) program.

    5.   You should at this stage see the Main Control Panel displayed, as
         shown below.

                           ***** SEE PIC 1 *****

         Please read and follow the tutorial that follows carefully, all the
         software presets have been set up from the start to allow you to
         quickly grab or view HAM colour images from switch on.

                                  TUTORIAL

    This section of the manual covers the most important points of the Vidi-
Amiga 12 hardware and software

                    LOADING AN IMAGE WITH Vidi-AMIGA 12

                           ***** SEE PIC 1 *****

    Just click on the DRIVES gadget, click on DF0: and the file Sean.ILBM
name will then appear in the LOAD window (you may have to scroll the names
to see it by clicking on the down arrow), click on the name and Sean.ILBM
will appear in the FILE box, finish off by clicking on the OK gadget
    The message LOADING IFF will appear and shortly after CONVERTING TO RGB.

PAGE 5

    When the messages disappear, click on the Vidi-Amiga 12 logo to see the
image you have loaded!
    You use this procedure each time to load pictures into the software to
view them.

                         CHOOSING YOUR VIDEO SOURCE

    Take a look at your video camera, camcorder or video recorder`s video
out socket and using a suitable cable, plug it into the Vidi-Amiga 12`s
Phono socket.
    there are many different makes of video cameras, etc. on the market, but
there are only three common types of composite video sockets!

    The first and by far the most common is the phono connector, shown
opposite.
    This will be labelled Composite Video Out or Video Out.
    Consult your video machines manual.
    We supply with the Vidi-Amiga 12 a  phono plug to Phono plug cable for
connecting straight to this type of socket.
    The second type is the multi pin SCART socket like the one in this
picture.

PAGE 6

    Most video or television shops can supply you with a Scart plug - Phono
plug cable.
    But we can supply our own Scart Plug adaptor which has a Phono socket on
it as an extra if required.

    The last and rarest is the BNC socket. This is usually found on more
expensive video recorders and again Rombo can supply a BNC plug - Phono plug
adapter if necessary.

    If you do have a machine which uses a different type of video connector,
then a special case may have to be purchased from your video dealer.

    Owners of S-VHS or Hi8 machines may use the higher picture quality S-VHS
input, a suitable cable may be obtained from video dealers.

    PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY SOCKET LABELLED RF OUTPUT OR TELEVISION OUTPUT MUST
NOT BE USED, AS THIS TYPE OF CONNECTOR IS TOTALLY UNSUITABLE FOR THE VID1
AMIGA 12.

    This is a picture of a typical RF OUTPUT or ANT OUT socket.

PAGE 7

    Once you have decided on which video source you are using either
composite video (Phono, SCART or BNC) or S-Video (S-VHS, Hi8), connect the
appropriate cable from the video source to the Vidi Amiga 12.
    (Please note that only one source can be connected to the Vidi Amiga 12
at any one time).
    If you what to grab an image from a camera, then the best setup is to
position the camera directly over the object and have a strong  (preferably
daylight) light source at an angle of 45 degs to the object. This prevents
the light source from reflecting off the object into the camera lens.

                     GRABBING YOUR  FIRST COLOUR IMAGE

                           ***** SEE PIC 2 ******

    From the Vidi Amiga 12 MAIN CONTROL PANEL, click on the grab gadget.
    The MAIN CONTROL PANEL will be replaced with a GRABBER CONTROL PANEL at
the bottom of the screen and in the background will be a constantly updating
black and white image of the video source.
    If you get the message "No Video Signal found" then either the video
source is not connected correctly or the video source is switched off!
    You can now adjust your video source's focus or brightness if you wish
or by using the two left most vertical sliders on the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL
make minor adjustments to the black and white levels.

PAGE 8

    Once you are happy with the image displayed, click on the GRAB gadget
and a MIXING FRAMES window will appear. after a period of time, a full
screen picture will be displayed. To return to the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL
simply click on the colour picture with the left mouse button.

    You will notice that a white tick has appeared next to the colour
button, this indicates that a colour image is stored. to view the picture
again click on the VIEW gadget.
    To return to the panel click on the picture again with the left mouse
button.

    Please note that for the best quality colour images, the image you are
trying to grab must be absolutely still for approximately one second after you
have clicked the GRAB gadget.

    Note: Even expensive video machines using so called still or pause
picture can in fact be slightly jumping, and this can affect the quality of
the colour image. Only video machines with a digital freeze frame can be
said to be perfectly still.

    After the initial view you may want to adjust the amount of colour
present, this is set by the third vertical slider from the left. You will
need to repeatedly click on the GRAB gadget and then re-adjust the colour
bar until you are satisfied with the picture.

    The grabbed image is only temporarily stored in the Grab Frame buffer in
the Vidi Amiga 12 and if you were to grab another colour image the previous
one will be lost.

PAGE 9

    To store the image in the computer you need to click on STORE. This will
transfer the picture to the CAROUSEL part of the software and you will
notice that a white tick (along with red, green and blue) will disappear.
    This indicates that there is no colour image to view from the GRABBER
CONTROL PANEL and you may safely grab another image.

                          MIXING YOUR COLOUR IMAGE

    When you grabbed a colour image, the Vidi Amiga 12 took three pictures
(a red, green and blue picture) of the image and placed them in a temporary
buffer. These three images are known as RGB triple. You can see that they
are stored by the three red, green and blue ticks highlighted in the GRABBER
CONTROL PANEL.
    The Vidi Amiga 12 software requires these separate images to remix them
into a new image.

    Clicking on the MIX gadget on the left side of the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL
allows the COLOUR MIXING PREFERENCES PANEL to open and allow you to select
different scree modes and resolutions. as shown below.

                           ***** SEE PIC 2 *****

PAGE 10

    You should see that HAM has been selected and the screen resolution is
set to 320*256 (320*200 in America). Click repeatedly on the HAM gadget
until 16 colours is shown and click on the ERROR DIFFUSION gadget as this
will improve the mixed picture quality. Finally click on the MIX gadget in
the MIXING PREFERENCES PANEL and the MIXING FRAMES bar will appear, after a
short time it will have finished processing the new image. To see the
results of your mix, click on the VIEW gadget on the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL.

    You can repeat this and select other screen modes and resolutions, but
please remember not all Amigas can display all the various combinations and
the message IMAGE DISPLAY MODE IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THIS AMIGA that may pop up
instead of your image means that your particular Amiga can not display that
type of picture, but you will still be able to save the picture to disc if
you wish. See page 20 for a list of the screen modes which you can display
in.

                             USING THE CAROUSEL

    From the MAIN CONTROL WINDOW click on the CAROUSEL gadget and the
CAROUSEL CONTROL PANEL will be displayed.

                           ***** SEE PIC 3 *****

PAGE 11

    The CAROUSEL allows the images you have stored to be displayed in
various ways. You can play them as a group running the images forwards or
backwards and adjust the playback speed, you can even perform simple
animations!

    Also from the CAROUSEL you can select an image for EDITING. This allows
the selected image to be further processed.

                           ***** SEE PIC 5 *****

    The Sean.ILBM image you first loaded, will be displayed at the top of
the screen at 1/8 normal size and if you click an LOAD and load in the
Vogue.ILBM image from the disc as well, them return to the CAROUSEL, you
will see two pictures at the top of the screen. Click on the Sean picture
and you will notice a red outline appear around the picture. This indicates
that the Sean picture is selected. Click on the Vogue picture as well, so
that both images have a red outline and then click on the PLAY gadget. You
will see the two pictures flick between each other or animate.

    A click on the screen with the left mouse button will stop the playback.
If you click on the playback speed slider bar and position the black bar
such that the number 25 appears below it, then click on the PLAY again. You
will see the same action again, but much faster this time.
    (The number under the playback speed bar is a rough guide to how fast it
will playback the pictures. The actual speed depends on which type of Amiga
you have).

                           ***** SEE PIC 3 *****

                             EDITING THE IMAGE

    From the CAROUSEL, select the image of Sean and click on the EDIT
gadget.
    The picture of Sean will be shown full sized and there will be the IMAGE
PROCESSING CONTROL PANEL at the bottom of the screen. This panel allows an
image or sequence of images to be processed or enhanced.

                           ***** SEE PIC 4 *****

    For example, click on the NEGATIVE gadget 9you will notice it will
appear pressed) and then click on the EDIT gadget at the right hand side.
The pointer will turn into a clock symbol and after some time you will see
a negative version of the picture start to appear from the top.
    The image of Sean stored in the CAROUSEL has been converted to a
negative!

PAGE 13

    A good use of this is if you have some colour (black and white ) film
negatives, you could grab them and turn them negative so that they appear
normal!

    As with the other control panels, the IMAGE PROCESSING CONTROL PANEL
overlays the image. Clicking on the image will hide the panel, showing all
of the image. Clicking on the image will bring back the control panel.

                              SAVING AN IMAGE

    Once you are satisfied with the image/s you have grabbed or edited, you
will want to save them onto disk.
    Only images selected from the CAROUSEL can be saved, so from the
CAROUSEL panel, select only those images you wish to save and click on the
save gadget. The SAVE IFF-ILBM WINDOW will open and you can either select a
drive from the list in the window or type in the drives name in the Drawer
string gadget (DF0:,DF1:, etc.).

    You must enter a name for the image/s in the FILE string gadget. The
Vidi Amiga 12 software will automatically add the prefix.ILBM (or.ANIM if
more than one image has been selected) to the file name you have not already
done so.

    Before clicking on the OK gadget, make sure that the write protect tab
on the disk is off and that there is a disk present in the drive you wish to
save to.

    The Vidi Amiga 12 software will not allow an image to be saved if there
is not enough room on the disk.
    See page 38 for more details on saving images.

   HAME            262000         Requires a third part E-REG board

    The message IMAGE DISPLAY MODE IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THIS AMIGA will appear
if you try to use those modes which your Amiga can not display.
    Note: The restrictions above are only display restrictions. Even though
an image is not displayable, it can be saved to disk and consequently loaded
into a machine capable of displaying it.

         OPTIMAL PALETTE

    When selected a palette will be chosen by the computer including the
most valuable colours. The results you get from using this are very much
dependant on the subject matter being grabbed. If it makes the image look
better use it. If the image looks worse, do not use it.

         ERROR DIFFUSION

    This technique is used to improve quality when mixing and editing.
    A captured image contains up to 4096 colours, mixing down to, for or
example , 32 colours would result in the loss of useful colour information.
Error Diffusion reduces the apparent loss of colour. We recommend leaving it
selected in most cases, except for HAM type images when mixing and editing

PAGE 21

         CONVERT TO RGB

    When selected, an RGB triple will be derived from the loaded image. The
Vidi-AMIGA 12 software can only mix or edit an image if it consists of a
Red, Green and Blue triple.
    An RGB triple is automatically generated when you grab a colour image,
but if an image is loaded from disc, an RGB triple must be created.
    This is done when this option is selected. From version 2.03 of the
software an RGB triple can now be extracted from any type of image.

         MAIN WINDOW

    When selected, the Vidi-AMIGA 12 logo in the MAIN CONTROL WINDOW will be
replaced by the last image loaded or stored.
    When de-selected you may still see the last image loaded or stored by
simply clicking on the Vidi-AMIGA 12 logo.

         SAVE

    When clicked the settings of all the GRAB PREFERENCES and DISPLAY
PREFERENCES are saved to disc.

         CLOSE

    When clicked it simply closes the window.

    NOTE: The GRAB and DISPLAY PREFS... windows can be left open while using
other functions of the software.

                                  GRAB...

***** SEE PIC 2 *****

    Enter the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL and a requester window saying NO VIDE
SIGNAL DETECTED RETRY, ABORT may appear. This is due to the software
constantly checking to see if a video source is present. Select RETRY to
attempt to display the incoming video source again,. Selecting ABORT will
exit the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL. If the Vidi-AMIGA 12 recognises a incoming
video signal then the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL will overlay a constantly
updating monochrome image. Clicking with the left mouse button on the image
will reveal the full image, clicking on it again will bring back the GRABBER
CONTROL PANEL.

    Clicking on MIX will pop up the COLOUR MIXING PANEL. As with other
control panels, the other four buttons EDIT, CAROUSEL, LOAD and SAVE will
exit the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL and activate the selected function.

         MONO

    This button will allow a monochrome (16 grey levels) image to be
grabbed. When a grab is performed successfully, a tick will appear to the
left of it to indicate that a monochrome image is available for viewing. To
view the image click on MONO and then on VIEW.

PAGE 23

         RED

    This button when selected will allow the red component of an image to be
previewed and grabbed. When a grab is performed successfully, a tick will
appear to the left of it to indicate that a red image is available for
viewing.
    To view the image click on RED and then click on VIEW.

         GREEN

    This button when selected will allow the green component of an image to
be previewed and grabbed. When a grab is performed successfully, a tick will
appear to the left of it to indicate that a green image is available for
viewing.
    To view the image click on GREEN and then click on VIEW.

         BLUE

    This button when selected will allow the blue component of an image to
be previewed and grabbed. When a grab is performed successfully, a tick will
appear to the left of it to indicate that a blue image is available for
viewing.
    To view the image click on BLUE and then click on VIEW.

         COLOUR

    This button when selected will allow the blue component of an image to
be previewed and grabbed. When a grab is performed, the Red, Green and Blue
components are grabbed in quick succession and mixed to produce a colour
image. A tick will appear to the left of COLOUR it to show you that a colour
image is available for viewing.

         AUTO

    When this is selected and you click on GRAB, the image will be grabbed,
mixed (if colour), viewed and automatically stored in the CAROUSEL.

PAGE 24

         MANUAL

    When this is selected and you click on GRAB, the image will be grabbed,
mixed (if colour), viewed. You will have to store the image manually if you
want it placed in the CAROUSEL.

         CONT. (CONTINUOUS)

    When this is selected, the grabber will grab and store monochrome images
into the CAROUSEL continuously until the Amiga's memory if full. A message
will be displayed in the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL  to click the left mouse
button to stop this process.
    INTERLACE is automatically turned of temporarily during this operation.

                           ***** SEE PIC 2 *****

    This slider is used in conjunction with CONT. to allow the software to
perform timelapsed grabbing. By positioning the slider you may alter the
time interval between each grabbed image. Normally set to 0.0 seconds for
ordinary use, other available settings are 0.5 seconds to 1 minute, 2
minutes to 50 minutes, 1 hour to 6 hours, or TRIG.
    TRIG allows the second joystick fire button to be the triggering device.
See page 41 for more details.

         LOOP

    When this is selected and CONTINUOUS GRAB is being performed after the
memory becomes full, CONTINUOUS GRAB will continue, but it will overwrite the
images already grabbed. This allows you to continually grab images without
running out of memory.

PAGE 25

    The four vertical sliders allow you to make adjustments to the level of
(from left to right) white, black, colour and vertical position of the image
displayed. You may adjust them as you see fit.

                           ***** SEE PIC 2 *****

    This vertical bar indicates the amount of free memory available. Whilst
in CONTINUOUS GRAB. The counter below it shows the number of captured images
or the image being overwritten if LOOP is selected.

                           ***** SEE PIC 2 *****

         GRAB

    When clicked, the grabbing process begins.
    Note: If a colour image is being grabbed then the image must be
completely still for approximately 1 second.
    Note: The image grabbed is not stored unless the AUTO option is selected
or STORED is clicked.

         VIEW

    This allows you to view the image held in the Grabber buffer. If the
ticks next to the various colour buttons are not highlighted, then this
means that there is no image to view. To view a red only image, select the
RED button (if there a red tick next to it) and click on VIEW.
    You can do this with each of the images, mono, red, green, blue and
colour.

         STORE

    When COLOUR is ticked and highlighted the contents of the Grabber buffer
are placed in the CAROUSEL store and the RGB triple in the Grabber buffer
emptied, the four ticks (red, green, blue and colour) will switch off
indicating that it is empty. If MONO is ticked and highlighted when STORE is
placed into the CAROUSEL and the tick next to the MONO will switch off
indicating that it is empty.
    To review the now stored picture, you will have to go to the CAROUSEL
PANEL.

PAGE 26

         UNDO

    This will delete the current RGB triple and colour image stored in the
Grabber buffer if Red, Green, Blue or colour is highlighted. If Mono is
highlighted then only that image will be deleted.

                             MIX CONTROL PANEL

                           ***** SEE PIC 4 *****

    The MIX CONTROL PANEL can only be entered if one or more images have
been selected using CAROUSEL.
    The MIX CONTROL PANEL overlays the image which is being remixed (the
working image).
    Clicking on the image will hide the MIX CONTROL PANEL, showing all the
working image, clicking again will bring back the MIX CONTROL PANEL.

    As with the other control panels, the five buttons GRAB, CAROUSEL, LOAD
and SAVE will exit the MIX CONTROL PANEL and activate the selected function.
    Clicking on the Close button will return to the MAIN CONTROL WINDOW and
any changes will be lost.

    The two sets of cycle gadgets controlling the resolution and screen
modes are explained in the DISPLAY PREFERENCES section and control how the
image is to be remixed.

PAGE 27

    The information box above the IMAGE gadget displays the screen mode and
resolution of the working image which is to be remixed.

         IMAGE

    This indicator is ticked when the remixed image is held in a temporary
buffer called the Mix Image Buffer.

                           ***** SEE PIC 4 *****

    These four gadgets in the MIX CONTROL PANEL are described below.

         MIX

    Deletes the image held in the Mix Image Buffer, restoring the working
image.

    Note: Only one image can be remixed at any one time. If the images
selected from the CAROUSEL contains more than one image, only the first in
the sequence will be

PAGE 28

    remixed. Mono images can be remixed to a mono image of different
resolutions or even other screen modes/resolutions, but not to colour!
    Colour images without an RGB triple can not be remixed.

    The Information Box displays the screen mode and resolution of the
current image displayed.

                                    EDIT

                           ***** SEE PIC 4 *****

    This panel is used for changing the image displayed. Once a sequence of
images have been selected using the CAROUSEL, you may alter them singly or
as a group.

PANEL and return to the MAIN CONTROL WINDOW. Any changes will be saved.

                                  CAROUSEL

                           ***** SEE PIC 3 *****

    The CAROUSEL allows selection of images for deletion, editing or
animation.
    The CAROUSEL consists of the panel and a system of pages which display
1/8 sized pictures of the images you may have loaded or grabbed.
    These images may be selected for deleting, editing, mixing, saving or
animation.

PAGE 32

                           ***** SEE PIC 6 *****

    The close button will return you to the MAIN CONTROL WINDOW.

                           ***** SEE PIC 3 *****

    The top two cycle gadgets allow you to view the different screen modes
or resolutions of images you may have loaded or grabbed for viewing, editing
or animating.
    It is only possible to view or animate images which are of the same
screen mode and resolution at one time. You will have to click in these
gadgets to view your images if they are of different screen mode or
resolution.

    The third gadget down is used for selecting images, if set to SEQUENCE,
all images displayed in the CAROUSEL can be instantly selected by keeping
the left mouse button pressed down and moving the mouse through the images.
If set to SINGLE only one image may be selected at a time.

    The bottom cycle gadget defines the way the image will be saved. It is
selectable to ILBM, 12 BIT or 24 BIT.

         ILBM

    Saves the mixed image as standard iff image file.

         12 BIT

    This saves the RGB triple as and IFF 12-bit image.

PAGE 34

         24 BIT

    Allows you to save the RGB triple as a 24-bit IFF image.
    Note: 12-bit or 24-bit images can not be displayed directly on a
standard Amiga.

    This collection of gadgets are used for block selecting or deselecting.

                           ***** SEE PIC 3 *****

    Select an image on the CAROUSEL page and press START to define the first

PAGE 37

                               LOAD AND SAVE

                           ***** SEE PIC 2 *****

    These windows simply allow you to select which IFF file you wish to
load/save, either ILBM or ANIM type files. To select which image/s you wish
to save, you must use the CAROUSEL.

                                  LOADING

    The Vidi-AMIGA 12 automatically detects the file type being loaded. 12-
bit and 24-bit images are mixed to a HAM image for viewing purposes. If an
image is loaded and CONVERT TO RGB is selected an RGB triple is extracted at
loading time.

PAGE 38

    Clicking on DRIVES will display the different drives you can load images
from. (DF0:, DF1:, etc) Clicking on these names will bring up a list of
files on the disks inserted in those disk drives. Simply double click on the
file you wish to load or use the scroll arrows to view all the files.
    You can of course type the name of the file in the FILE string gadget if
you prefer.

                                   SAVING

    Saves the current image/s selected from the CAROUSEL to a file. If more
than one image is selected, then they will be saved as a ANIM file. If 12-
bit or 24-bit is selected and the image has no associated RGB triple or is a
monochrome image the save will default to ILBM, if more than one image is
selected then only the first will be saved.

    Once you have selected one or more images for saving, clicking on
DRIVES allows you to select which drive you wish to save to. (The DRAWER
line shows DF): as the currently selected drive and path). After clicking on
the drive number (or enter the drive number manually in the Drawer string
gadget) you should enter a name for the image in the FILE string gadget and
click on OK.

PAGE 39

                                  GLOSSARY

         RGB TRIPLE

    Three images representing the red, green and blue component of the
colour image.
    Editing, mixing or displaying an image in the MAIN CONTROL WINDOW needs
an RGB triple of the colour image.

         IMAGE SEQUENCE

    A group of images of the same screen mode and resolution.

         GRAB FRAME BUFFER

    The temporary Mono, Red, Green and Blue image storage area used by the
Vidi-AMIGA 12 software.

         MIX IMAGE BUFFER

    A temporary storage area where a remixed image is held before being
stored in the CAROUSEL.

PAGE 40

                            TIMELAPSED GRABBING

    Timelapsed grabbing allows the software to capture images one after the
another with a preset time interval between them. This allows the many
effects of time passing to be observed. E.g. Flowers opening and closing,
Clouds passing overhead or people passing by. Your imagination (and the
amount of RAM you have) is the limit!

    How to use: If CONT. is selected from the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL and the
timelapsed slider set to a value other than 0.0 then timelapsed grabbing
takes place. A good example of this is to point a video camera at the
horizon and set the timelapse slider to 1 minute. After a couple of hours
stop the grabbing by pressing the left mouse button and use the CAROUSEL to
select all the images and play them back. It is amazing to watch the clouds
whizzing past!

                            EXTERNAL TRIGGERING

    When the timelapsed slider is set to its highest setting the word TRIG
appears, this allows the pressing of the second joystick fire button to be
the triggering event instead of time lapsed.

    By simply wiring pins 6 and 8 of a suitable 9 pin D-type plug to a
switch (normally open not locking), you can make a device which will take a
picture each time the switch is pressed.
    Imagine wiring up a pressure sensitive floor switch, your Vidi-AMIGA 12
could take a picture each time the switch was walked on!

PAGE 41

                                 TEST CARD

    From the LOAD window you will come across a image file on the Vidi-AMIGA
12 disk called Teastcard.ILBM, this is a very useful image designed to allow
you to set up your television set to its optimum display.

    Simply load it in and by clicking on the Vidi-AMIGA 12 logo from the
MAIN CONTROL PANEL you will see a colour and grey scale image.

    Adjust the brightness of your television so that you can see all the
different grey levels and adjust the contrast control of your television so
that the black level look really black and not just dark grey.

                       COMPLETE COLOUR SOLUTION USERS

    Users of the original monochrome Vidi-AMIGA and Vidi-RGB units can use
this software by selecting the Vidi-RGB option in the GRAB PREFS... window.
The software will automatically set up your Vidi-RGB unit for you.

    Please note that the images produced using the Complete Colour Solution
are not as good as the Vidi-AMIGA 12.

PAGE 42

                        BLACK AND WHITE CAMERA USERS

    Not everyone has access to a colour camera and for those people wishing
to use a black and white video camera with Vidi-AMIGA 12 unit. please follow
these instructions.
    You will need three colour filters, Red, Green and blue.
    Set the COLOUR SATURATION level from the GRABBER CONTROL PANEL to
minimum. Set the panel to MANUAL and click on each colour component in turn
and with the corresponding colour filter in front of the camera lens grab an
image.

                              TROUBLE SHOOTING

    If you should experience any problems with you Vidi-AMIGA 12, then
please try the following suggestions before taking the unit back to the
place of purchase or phoning the technical support line at ROMBO.

    Some people may find it all too easy to instantly blame the Vidi-AMIGA
12 if it appears not to function at first, but experience has taught us at
ROMBO that most problems are caused by the user simply not having read the
manual properly which can result in the product not being connected to the
Amiga correctly or being connected to the wrong type of video source.

                           PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS

              ERROR MESSAGE STATES - NO VIDEO SIGNAL DETECTED.

    Try connecting the video lead from the Amigas monochrome video out on
the rear of the computer to the video in on the Vidi-AMIGA 12.
    Now try grabbing an image if the no video message disappears then the
Vidi-AMIGA 12 is working and the fault lies with your original video source.
    Please refer to page 4 of the manual for details of the correct type of
video source to be used.

PAGE 44

                      BLACK AND WHITE VERTICAL STRIPES

    Please check that you have the Vidi-AMIGA 12 firmly connected to the
parallel port and if you have to use any extension leads from your parallel
port, please make sure they are also firmly seated.

    Please note that when using a parallel port extension cable that it must
be a short flat ribbon cable type and not a round cable. The reason for this
is that all 25 pins of the parallel port must be connected to the Vidi-AMIGA
12 in order for it to operate correctly.

    We also recommend that a extension lead no longer than 30cm be used. A
short extension cable is available from ROMBO. We can also supply a parallel
port switching box which works with the Vidi-AMIGA 12. We can not guarantee
that another companys will work.

                  IMAGE IS CORRUPTED WITH HORIZONTAL LINES

    This is usually caused by the Vidi-AMIGA 12's disk drive cable not been
connected.
    Please check that you have connected the drive lead to the external
drive port on your computer or the through port on any external drive that
you may have connected. As the Vidi-AMIGA 12 takes power through it.

PAGE 45

    Please note that some external drives do not have any form of through
port on them (or the power supply pins have not been wired up). This will
mean that you will have to purchase a drive port splitter which will allow
both an external drive and the Vidi-AMIGA 12 to be fitted simultaneously.

    A splitter device called TWIN IT may be available from a company called
George Thomson Services. Their phone number is (0707) 271117.

                    MONOCHROME INSTEAD OF COLOUR GRABBED

    This is usually caused by the user not setting their DISPLAY PREFS... to
a colour selection.

            COMPUTER ASKS FOR THE ORIGINAL DISK TO BE INSERTED.

    This is caused by the user making a backup disk which does not have the
same name as the original.
    Rename the backup disk to VidiAMIGA12 (no spaces!)

            ERROR MESSAGE - V34.Lib REQUIRED OR SIMILAR MESSAGE.

    This is usually caused by users booting up from hard drive or from their
Workbench disk. These users must use the INSTALL (or INSTALLWB1.3 for users
of Workbench 1.3) program supplied to copy the library files to either hard
drive or onto their Workbench disk.

PAGE 46

         OVERSCAN MODE NOT WORKING

    In order to display images at full overscan, it is necessary to set the
overscan preferences in the Workbench.
    Consult your Amiga Manual on how to do this.
    Only Amigas with either the enhanced graphic chip set or A.G.A. fitted
can perform full overscan.

         STILL NOT WORKING CORRECTLY

    If after these tests the Vidi-AMIGA unit still appears to be
malfunctioning the if possible try the Vidi-AMIGA on another machine, just
to confirm that there is not a fault on your computer.
    Lastly phone or write to the ROMBO technical supportline.

    Note: It is perfectly possible for an Amiga to have a faulty parallel
port with a printer (or sound digitiser) seemingly working correctly, but
when the Vidi-AMIGA 12 unit the faulty parallel port will not work with it.
This is due to the Vidi-AMIGA 12 using the full capabilities of the parallel
port whilst a printer (or sound digitiser) does not.
