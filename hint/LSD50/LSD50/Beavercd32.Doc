THE GAME
--------
IN THE GAME YOU TAKE ON THE ROLE OF JETHRO IN HIS QUEST TO SAVE HIS
BELOVED. THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO MAKE YOUR WAY THROUGH EACH
LEVEL.OVERCOMING VARIOUS OBSTACLES AND PLATFORMS WHILST AVOIDING THE
VARIOUS RABBIT ALLIES YOU MAY ENCOUNTER.
FOR EVERY 6 LEVELS OF THE GAME YOU COMPLETE, YOU WILL BE GIVEN A CODE, SO
THAT HE CAN CONTINUE HIS STRUGGLE AT A LATER DATE.HOWEVER, THE RABBITS DO
NOT APPRECIATE YOUR TASK BEING MADE ANY EASIER.AND WILL SEND THEIR BIGGEST
AND MOST DANGEROUS FOLLOWERS TO ATTACK YOU,JUST PRIOR TO YOU BEING GIVEN A
CODE.
TO DEFEAT THESE LARGE BEASTS USE A SPIN ATTACK TO PROPEL THE MISSILES BACK
AT THEM.HOWEVER, WATCH OUT AS ROCKS ARE TO HEAVY TO BAT WITH YOUR TAIL,AND
YOU WILL OSE AN ENERGY POINT FOR TRYING.

CHARISMA STARS
--------------
ON EACH LEVEL YOU WILL BE SET A NUMBER OF YELLOW STARS TO BE COLLECTED,
THESE ARE TO MAINTAIN YOUR CHARISMA IN THE FOREST POPULARITY POLLS,IF YOU
FAIL TO COLLECT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF STARS WHEN YOU REACH THE END OF THE
LEVEL, YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE. THESE STARS ALSO HELP IN KEEPING
YOUR HEALTH UP.FOR EVERY 8 STARS YOU COLLECT, 1 UNIT OF ENERGY WILL BE
REPLENISHED.

LIFE STARS
----------
AROUND THE LEVELS THERE ARE ALSO A FEW RED LIFE STARS TO BE COLLECTED.THESE
STARS ARE RED IN COLOUR, AND FOR EVERY 3 OF THESE STARS COLLECTED, YOU WILL
RECEIVE AN EXTRA LIFE. HOWEVER,THESE STARS ARE MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOUR
AVERAGE STAR,AND CANNOT BE COLLECTED AS EASILY AS CHARISMA STARS.TO COLLECT
THE LIFE STARS YOU MUST SNEAK UP UPON THEM.BY CREEPING TOWARDS THEM
(WHISTLING AS YOU GO)THEN JUMPING UPTO THEM WHEN STANDING DIRECTLY BENEATH
THEM.THIS IS DONE BY PUSHING THE JOYSTICK UP DIAGONALLY IN THE DIRECTION
YOU WISH TO SNEAK. IF YOU DO NOT SNEAK UPTO THE REDSTARS THEY WILL MOVE OUT
OF YOUR REACH.

RACCOON SKIN HAT
----------------
AS YOU KNOW THE BEAVER KIDS ARE HELPING YOU IN YOUR QUEST,HOWEVER, THEY ARE
VERY TEMPREMENTAL AND MUST BE GIVEN A PRESENT TO KEEP IN THEIR FAVOUR.ON
EACH LEVEL SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IS A RACCON SKIN HAT,THIS HAT MUST BE
DISCOVERED AND COLLECTED OTHERWISE YOUR KIDS WILL LOSE INTEREST AND YOU
WILL NOT BE HELPED OUT OF THE LEVEL YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN.

SWITCHES
--------
IN SOME OF THE LEVELS THERE ARE SWITCHES THAT MUST BE ACTIVATED,THE
SWITCHES WILL HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON EACH LEVEL,SUCH AS, ACTIVATING A
LIFT,MACHINERY OR CHANGING THE ROUTES OF SOME OF THE DOORWAYS. TO ACTIVATE
A SWITCH IT MUST EITHER BE JUMPED ONTO, OR YOU SHOULD PUSH UP ON THE
JOYSTICK WHEN STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF IT.

DOORS
-----
THERE ARE SEVERAL DOORWAYS/CAVE ENTRANCES IN THE GAME,THESE EITHER LEAD TO
SECRET ROOMS THAT CONTAIN VALUABLE OBJECTS/STARS OR THEY WILL ACT AS A
TRANSPORTER,TAKING YOU TO ANOTHER PART OF THE LEVEL.TO ENTER A DOOR/CAVE
ENTRANCE JUST PUSH UP ON THE JOYSTICK WHILST STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF
IT.

RUBBER LEAVES
-------------
ON SOME LEVELS THERE WILL BE PLATFORMS OR OBJECTS THAT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE TO
REACH IN A SINGLE BOUND,HOWEVER, IF NERABY YOU SEE A SINGLE LEAF STICKING
OUT FROM A TREE,TRY JUMPING ON IT FOR A SUPER BEAVER LEAP.ALWAYS CHECK OUT
THE LEAVES IF YOU CAN THERE MAY BE BONUS STARS IN STORE.

CLOUDS
------
SOME OF THE LEVELS DO NOT FINISH WHEN YOU REACH THE TOP OF THE PLATFORMS,
EXPERIMENT WITH JUMPING INTO THE HEAVENS, SOME OF THE CLOUDS ARE MORE SOLID
THAN THEY APPEAR.A GOOD CLUE IS STARS POSITIONED AMONGST THE CLOUDS.

OBJECTS
-------
THERE ARE SEVERAL OBJECTS IN THE GAME THAT WILL HELP YOU WITH YOUR QUEST.

MUSHROOM SEED
-------------
AFTER COLLECTING THIS,IF YOU DROP IT,IT WILL SEEP INTO THE GROUND AND GROW
INTO A LARGE MUSHROOM, THIS CAN THEN BE USED AS A PLATFORM TO REACH LEVELS
THAT YOU PREVIOUSLY COULD NOT REACH BY JUMPING TOWARDS THEM.

SPANNER
-------
THIS IS USED TO START UP MACHINERY FOUND ON CERTAIN LEVELS, THESE MACHINES
WILL ACTIVATE LIFTS OR SEND A JET OF STEAM INTO THE AIR,THAT YOU CAN RIDE
UPON TO REACH HIGH PLATFORMS(BEWARE- THIS ACTIVITY USES 1 OF YOUR ENERGY
UNITS). TO START MACHINERY WITH THE SPANNER,SIMPLY WALK IN FRONT OF THE
MACHINE AND DROP THE SPANNER.

AND THATS THE END OF THE CD32 INSTRUCTIONS...IF LIKE ME YOUR GONNA PLAY IT
ON YOUR 1200/HD THEN I'VE ALSO ENCLODE THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE PUT OUT
FOR THE AMIGA A500/600..HERE THEY ARE...

Beavers Docs.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*

BEAVERMANIA has swept the World! The Beavers Supergroup and their megastar
leader Jehtro have reached number one in the Chart again! With their catchy
"funky-hillbilly" style songs and the "Beaverspin" dance craze sweeping the
forest discos, the World is their oyster.

Not all the creatures in the valley are pleased with the Beaver's success.
The Rappin' rabbit Rockers, the former number one group, are VERY angry about
the Beavers rise to the top. Not only is it costing them a fortune in record
rales but the Beaver style goes against their underground hare-raising rock/
rap musical taste. They are determined to rid the charts of this cutesy music
- Once and for all!!

A fiendish plan is put into operation. Jethro's beloved wife is kidnapped and
held hostage. She will not be released until the Beavers are disbanded and
all their master tapes are destroyed!

Jethro is determined not to let his Beaver comrades down. In a heroic gesture
he sets off to rescue his kidnapped wife with the aid of his faithful
children.
Hints.
*-*-*-

Before descending into caverns, check the surface areas first, you may not
be able to return to the surface!

Check the Underwater Areas, there is always a reward.

If you are stuck in a level, make sure that you have found all the
switches and activated them
