PREFACE - ABOUT THE GAME
------------------------

Welcome  to  the  world  of  interactive simulation, and congratulations on
choosing  what  we  think  is  one  of  the  best  and most accurate flight
simulators currently available.  Good flight simulators have been available
for  several years, but AV-8B HARRIER ASSAULT extends the concept by asking
the  player  to  play  two roles.  (1) As Commander of the Rapid Deployment
Force  (RDF)  you  will  run  the  campaign  of  Operation  Ocean  Saber, a
UN-authorised  invasion  of  East  Timor  in  Southeast  Asia.  Tasked with
landing   US   Marines  in  hostile  terrain  held  by  a  well  armed  and
numerically-superior  enemy,  you'll  make strategic and tactical decisions
for  the  force  as a whole.  (2) As a squadron pilot, you`ll fly the AV-8B
Harrier  jump  jet  from  the  flight  deck  of  the USS Tarawa taking this
revolutionary  vertical  take-off  fighter  into  combat  against the armed
forces of Indonesia, the nation which seized East Timor in 1975.

AV-8B  HARRIER  ASSAULT  will  place  you  in command of a naval task force
consisting   amphibious  assault  ships,  an  escort  of  powerfully  armed
warships,  transport  ships,  landing  craft,  eight thousand troops, their
vehicles,  stores,  helicopters,  and a squadron of McDonnell Douglas AV-8B
Harrier  II aircraft.  Get the feel of what it's like to be in command of a
powerful  naval  force able to project US military power on distant shores,
then  feel  the  thrill  of  being  the  pilot  of  one of the world's most
effective  close  air support aircraft.  But remember if you fail in either
role,  the  prisoners  of  war being herded behind barbed wire to await the
journey home will be wearing US rather than Indonesian uniforms.

If  you  prchased  AV-8B HARRIER ASSAULT expecting it to be a normal flight
simulation,  and  don`t want to play the role of task force commander, then
don`t  worry.   Using  expert  systems technology built into the game, your
computer  will be able to run the campaign, selecting the objectives of the
land and sea forces, positioning the ships, and specifying the missions for
the  AV-8B  Haariers,  leaving  you free to enjoy flying a simulation whose
flying  characteristics and cockpit layout are closely modelled on those of
the real aircraft.

The  expert  systems also control the actions of the enemy forces, who will
respond  to  your  decisions and tactics.  This allows you to play the game
many  times,  trying  different  methods  of dealing with a large defending
force  determined to fight for what it regards as Indonesian territory.  It
won't  be easy - a decade of struggle against the East Timor resistance has
honed the combat skills of the Indonesian Army.

CONFIGURING YOUR SYSTEM FOR AV-8B
---------------------------------

AV-8B  requires  a  minium  of 2 megabytes of RAM to run.  It will run with
EMM386.SYS  but  it  will  make  better use of memory if you do not use it.
Included  on  disk  2  is a bare bones AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS.  To use
these  rename your existing files to .OLD and replace them with the ones on
disk 2.

Installing AV-8B

To  install  AV-8B,  at the A:  prompt type INSTALL and follow the onscreen
prompts.

Thrustmaster

AV-8B  is  fully  compatible  with  the  thrustmaster range of joystick and
throttle controllers.

SECTION 1 - INTRODUCTION
------------------------

AV-8B  Harrier  Assault  is  essentially two games in one.  The first is an
accurate  flight  simulation  of  the  McDonnell  Douglas  AV-8B Harrier II
vertical/short   take-off  and  landing  fighter.   In  this  part  of  the
simulation  you'll  take  the role of an AV-8B pilot.  The second is a full
simulation  of  an  amphibious landing operation on a hostile shore by a US
Marine  Expeditionary Brigade.  In this part of the simulation, you`ll play
the task force commander.

The flight simulation

AV-8B  Harrier Assault incorporates an extremely accurate simulation of the
AV-8B Harrier.  This is based on two sophisticated aerodynamic models.  One
is   designed  to  provide  as  true  a  representation  of  the  aircrafts
performance  as  possible,  and  is  one  of  the  most  realistic aircraft
simulations  ever  written  for  a  personal computer.  The second model is
simpler,  and  is  designed  to help the novice player get into the game as
quickly  as  possible without having to worry about the complexities of the
full  aircraft  model.   Players  are  advised  to  start  with the simpler
version,  particularly  if  new  to  flight-simulation  games.  Once you've
mastered combat flying using this version, switch to the full simulation to
experience  the  nearest thing your PC can offer to the sensation of flying
the real aircraft.

As  a  pilot, you'll fly a series of missions in support of the task force.
Before  each  mission, you will provided with a pre-flight briefing on your
targets  and  the likely level of enemy defences you'll encounter.  The Nav
(navigation)  system of your aircraft will be automatically programmed with
the  co-ordinates  of  these  targets,  and  a suitable weapon load will be
installed.   You  fly  your  mission and, if you survive, can return to the
Tarawa.   A  post-flight  debriefing  session  will  report  the success or
failure  of  your mission, results which will have an effect on the overall
state  of  play.   The Marines on shore are relying on you for support.  If
you fail, they too may fail in their mission.

The Stategic Simulation

As  commander  of  the  task  force,  you  have two objectives.  Before the
outbreak  of  hostilities,  you will have to devise an overall plan for the
amphibious  landing  and  the  subsequent  ground  battle  with the enemies
forces.   You`ll  decide where to move the ships under your command, and on
which  beaches  to  send  the  Marines  under your command storming ashore.
Which  targets  will  you  "soften  up"  by  air  attack?   Which are to be
assaulted by helicopter borne special forces?  Deciding won't be easy.

Once  a  plan has been devised, you can start the simulation.  The computer
will  act as your staff, passing commands to the units tasked with carrying
out  the individual parts of your plan.  They, in turn, will try to achieve
what  you  have asked.  To provide a challenging and realistic campaign, we
have  simulated  the  entire  combat  zone  and  every vechicle in it, both
friendly  and hostile.  Every unit, vehicle and weapon participating in the
battle  is  controlled by the simulation software.  This will react to your
actions  and  inputs,  creating  a  simulated  battle in which friendly and
hostile forces respond in a realistic manner both to each other and to your
commands.

Multi-layer  expert  systems are used to control the enemy forces, creating
life-like  response  in real time.  Moving realistically, these enemy units
will  fight  your  forces,  providing  you  with  a  strategic and tactical
challenge.   As  the  campaign  progresses,  you'll have to "fine tune" the
battle plan, responding to the movements of the enemy, and the successes or
failures  of  your own forces.  You may have to send out new units or alter
the  orders  of units in the field in order to reinforce a critical part of
the battlefield, exploit an breakthrough, or stop a retreat.

To win the game, you must play both roles to some extent.  You can play (or
replay) the game acting predominantly as a pilot or as overall commander or
attempt  to perform both roles to an equal degree.  If you`ve played flight
simulations  in  the  past, you will probably start by concentrating on the
pilot's  role.  If you're a war games player, you may opt to concentrate of
being  commander  for  your first campaign.  Eventually you'll want to face
the challenge of handling both functions.

To  play  predominately  as  a  pilot, all you need do, as commander, is to
select  and  initiate  a  battle plan from the Tarawa's Tactical Amphibious
Warfare  Data  System  (TAWADS) computer.  AV-8B missions will be generated
automatically,  according  to the pre-set plan and also as required to meet
changing  state  of  battle.   On  its  own,  TAWADS  is not a particularly
effective  commander;  it  can only respond in a limited manner to changing
tactical  circumstances.   If  you  don't take any decisions in the role of
commander,  but  leave  it  all  to  TAWADS,  you  will  have  to be a very
successful pilot to win the campaign!

To  play  predominately  as  the  task force commander, you must create and
initiate  your  own  battle plan, then monitor the progress of the conflict
and  respond  tactically  by  creating  more plans.  AV-8B missions will be
flown automatically for you by the computer, but be aware that the computer
is much less effective at knocking out targets than all you will be after a
few  hours  of  play.   The  Marines  are outnumbered and out gunned on the
ground  by a factor of 4 to 1, so winning air superiority and flying strike
missions  is  very  important.   To win by playing purely as commander, you
will  have  to be a strategic and tactical genius and be prepared to accept
high  casualties  on  the  ground as your Marines fight without the massive
level of air superiority and air support which US ground forces have always
had in the wars of the last half century.

The  information  you  need  to play the game is contained in the following
sections of the manual:

Campaign Overview

The  crisis in East Timor, and why the United Nations has authorised the US
forces to intervene in this long-running conflict.

Quick Start

A  walk-through  of  two typical AV-8B missions.  This section will get you
into  the  air  and flying combat missions as quickly as possible.  It will
also familiarise you with the general features of the simulation.

AV-8B Pilot's Manual

This  describes  the AV-8B, its on-board electronic system and its weapons.
You'll   learn   how   to   obtain  pre-flight  briefings  and  post-flight
debriefings;  how  to select, weapons, how to control and fly the aircraft;
and  how  to  use the aircraft's electronic systems and sensors to navigate
and attack air and ground targets.

Ships and men of the Task Force

A  description of the USS Tarawa, and the other warships, assault ships and
support  ships  taking  part in the operation.  This section also describes
the  Marine  forces  under  your command, explaining how they are organized
into  battalions,  companies  and platoons, and gives short descriptions of
their weaponry.

On board Tarawa

How  to move around the flagship of your Marine Expeditionary brigade.  The
location  and  purpose  of  each of the vessel's compartments in described,
plus  short-cuts  which  will  take  you rapidly from one major location to
another.  You'll also learn how to jump from the Tarawa into the cockpit of
any  AV-8B  currently  flying  a  combat  mission,  and  how  to  switch to
spectacular outside views of the aircraft.

Flight Training

Aboard  Tarawa  is  a  flight  simulator  which you can use to practice the
flying  skills  needed  in the game, and allows these to be practised.  For
players  new  to the world of flight simulation, a Primary Training section
explains the basics of how to fly an aircraft.

Task Force Commander's Manual

The  entire  process  of  creating  a  battle plan is described, along with
instructions  on  how  to  use  the Tactical Amphibious Warfare Data System
(TAWADS),  the sophisticated command and control system which you`ll use to
create this plan and to pass orders to the forces under your command.

Intelligence Brief

Descriptions  of  the aircraft and weapons you're up against, and estimates
of  the  numbers  available  to  the  enemy.  The intelligence experts also
report  how  the AV-8B performed during combat missions in the Gulf and how
the  Harrier  and Sea Harrier performed in the Falklands - this information
should help you visualise V/STOL jet combat and the problems you'll face.

Historical Background

The  information  in this section is not needed to play the game, but it is
provided  as background reading.  The first section describes how the AV-8B
Harrier  family of V/STOL jets was developed; the second charts the history
of East Timor since that territory was seized by Indonesia in 1975.

Controlling the simulation

AV-8B  Harrier  Assault  is  designed  to be played using a pointing device
either  a  joystick  or  a  mouse.   You  can  fly  the simulation from the
keyboard, but you'll need a mouse or joystick for full control of TAWADS.

Mouse & Joystick

In  the  rest  of  the manual, you'll find reference to "clicking", "double
clicking"  ,  and  "dragging".  If you've already used a mouse or joystick,
you`re probably familiar with these terms already.  If not, heres what they
mean.

Single Click - depress and release pointer button immediately

Double Click - depress and release pointer button twice in quick succession.

Drag - depress button, move pointer and then release button.

Menus

You  will  also  meet several menus.  In many cases these will have a title
line,  appearing  as  a  box at the top of the menu.  In other cases, their
purpose will be self-explanatory when you look at the menu contents.  A red
check mark is shown against options which are currently selected.

Several  options will be greyed out, indicating that they are not available
under the current circumstances.

Select  the  option using the up and down arrow keys, then press (space) to
change  its  state.  Press (ESC) to close the menu when you're finished The
menus  you'll  meet below decks in Tarawa can also be operated by the mouse
or  joystick.  Clicking on an option will select or de-select it, and close
the  menu.   If  you want to change several options in a menu its easier to
use the keys.

Mouse  and  joystick  control are not available for menus accessed from the
AV-8B  cockpit in this case, the mouse or joystick is already being used to
control the aircraft, so these menus must be operated via the keyboard.

Waypoints

An essential concept throughout the simulation is the use of waypoints.  If
you`re  an  experienced  war  gamer  or flight simulator enthusiast, you`re
probably  familiar  with waypoints.  If not, don't worry - waypoint is just
the  military  jargon for something you've been using for years when giving
directions.   A  waypoint  is  a simply a geographic location at which some
sort of action must be taken when you get there.

To  see  waypoints  in  action,  imagine  giving  a  friend  the  following
instruction:

"Drive  south  along  Main Street, turn left at the first stop light, carry
stright past the school, turn left at the town hall, and the pizza joint is
on  the  left, directly opposite the library.  Buy six pizzas, then go back
up  the  street,  go  left  at the town hall, then watch for Joe's Computer
store on the right.  Wait in the parking lot behind Joe's until the rest of
us show up with the beer".

The  stop  light,  school,  town hall, library and Joe's Computer Store are
waypoints  in  a  plan  which will eventually see six pizzas delivered to a
bunch of hungry guys in the parking lot, To fulfil the mission, your friend
had  to  go  from  one waypoint to another, changing direction or following
other instructions ("buy pizzas" or "wait") as he reached each one.

In  AV-8B  Harrier  Assault,  you`ll  use  waypoints  to navigate ships and
aircraft,  and  to  command  the  start  of  different  types  of  military
operation.   Instead of sending your hypothetical friend to the pizza joint
waypoint  to  buy  pizza,  you  might  be  commanding  Tarawa to proceed to
waypoint  3,  then  launch  a Harrier to attack Lore then Tutuala.  For the
Harrier,  Lore,  Tutuala,  and Tarawa will be waypoints programmed into its
Nav system.

SECTION II - CAMPAIGN
---------------------

Campaign Overview

Five  months ago, a hard-line faction in the Indonesian Army seized control
of  the  country  while  senior  members  of the Indonesian Government were
visiting  Japan to sign a long-term agreement covering trade and industrial
co-operation between the two nations.  Since then, the country has been run
by a military junta.

Following  the  imposition  of  press  and broadcasting censorship, the new
rulers  moved  swiftly  to silence all civilian opposition to their regime,
imprisoning  without  trial  all  major  opponents of the junta:  Prominent
politicians  of  all  parties and trade union leaders, plus those religious
leaders,  journalists, broadcasters and members of the police and judiciary
who spoke out against the coup.

Large-seale  pro-democracy  demonstrations  in  the streets of Djakarta and
other major cities were ruthlessly suppressed by armed soldiers.  Estimates
of  the  number  of  demonstrators killed by troops have ranged from 300 to
over 1,500.

In an attempt create some measure of public support, the new regime has now
promised  a speedy end to the long-running rebellion in East Timor a former
Portuguese  colony  which  Indonesia  invaded and annexed in 1975.  Despite
repeated  United Nations resolutions, Indonesia has always refused to grant
independence  for  what it regards as one of its legitimate provinees.  For
more  than  a  decade,  repeated  reports  from  East  Timor have described
persistent  human  rights  violations  of the Timorese people by Indonesia,
including mass arrests, detention camps, executions, and the destruction of
entire villages.

Recent  military  communiques  from  the  junta talk openly of a "final and
complete  military  solution"  intended  to  end  the  rebellion.  From its
temporary  exile in Japan, the legitimate Government of Indonesia has asked
the  United  Nations to intervene to prevent the possibility of large-scale
atrocities in the region.

The  only military force in the area with the capability to intervene is an
amphibious  force  of  US Marines.  Currently at sea and scheduled to begin
Exercise  Ocean  Guardian,  the  small  force is not a full strength Marine
Expeditionary Brigade, but has only a single vessel equipped with the AV-8B
V/STOL  jet fighter.  Although some replacement aircraft are present on the
decks of the other assault ships in the fleet, this force must make do with
less than half the number of aircraft which would normally be assigned to a
landing operation, and only a single flight deck from which to operate them
the assault ship USS Tarawa.

As this small force cruises off the southern coast of East Timor the United
Nations discusses the crisis.  Following an all-night debate, the UN passes
a resolution authorising the United States to intervene in East Timor.

As the US President signs the orders which will translate the wishes of the
UN  into  action,  in  the  Timor  Sea it's a few hours until dawn.  Aboard
Tarawa,  technicians  give  the  vessel's AV-8B Harrier II fighters a final
check  over  while armorers fit fuzes to bombs and missiles.  In Tarawa and
the  other  vessels  of  the  task  force,  live ammunition is readied, and
landing craft are prepared for action.  Aboard the escorting warships, guns
and missile launchers are loaded with live rounds.  Ocean Guardian is about
to become Operation Ocean Saber.....

Priority: Flash (transmitted 16.12 EST)

Classification: Top Secret
From: National Security Adviser
To: Commanding Officer, Operation Ocean Saber

In  pursuance of last night's United Nations resolution authorising the use
of  force  to protect the people of East Timor, the President of the United
States issued the following orders at 16:00 Eastern Standard Time today:

1. Using  the  vessels,  aircraft,  and  personnel  currently  under your
   command,  you  are  ordered  to  use  such force as might be required to
   suppress  and terminate all operations in the territory of East Timor by
   the  Indonesian  armed  forces,  and  to  prevent the arrival of further
   Indonesian forces.

2. In a personal phone call to the President, the Secretary General of the
   United  Nations has made it clear that he views the situation as urgent.
   You  will  not  await reinforcements.  Operations against the Indonesian
   forces  on  East  Timor  are  to  commence immediately using those units
   currently under your command.

3. For  reasons  which  will  made  clear to you in a separate classified
   intelligence  briefing,  the ships of the task force are to remain south
   of   East   Timor  at  all  times.   Your  naval  units  must  under  no
   circumstances  move  north  of  Ilheu  da Jaco - the small island at the
   eastern tip of east Timor.

4. You  will land your Marine Expeditionary Brigade on the southern coast
   of  East  Timor,  then  move  inland  to  engage, defeat, and disarm the
   Indonesian  forces  operating there.  Your troops will remain to provide
   protection  and  assistance  to  the  local population, until the United
   Nations  can  consult  all  parties  to  bring  about an end to the long
   running conflict.

5. An   operational   plan   "Saber"   was  despatched  last  night  via
   communications  satellite  and  downloaded  into  the  battle management
   computers  aboard your flagship Tarawa.  You are free to modify or adapt
   this as you see fit, or to use an alternative plan of your own.

6. You  may  open  fire  against  the  Indonesian  forces without further
   authorisation  from  the US Government or the United Nations.  If, prior
   to  the  start  of  hostilities,  Indonesian  aircraft approach your own
   aircraft or fleet in a manner you judge to be a possible threat, you may
   treat them as hostile.

While  carrying  out these orders, you are to keep the following constraint
in mind.  Indonesia has for many years been an ally of the US.  In the hope
of  quickly  repairing  the  damage  to relations between the two countries
which Ocean Saber must inevitably cause, the President wishes this campaign
-  to  be  kept  "low  key"  and  resolved with the minimum amount of force
necessary to get the job done.

The  President  has  also asked me to convey his concern that you are being
asked  to  carry out this mission with such limited forces.  But even had a
second  Marine  Expeditionary  Brigade  been  available at short notice, or
guided  missile  cruisers  for  extra anti-aircraft protection, both he and
State  Department believe that their use would be counter-productive with a
new round of international arms reduction talks due to start within months.
For  the  US  to  use the level of military force which the Joint Chiefs of
Staff  would  have preffered on purely military grounds could also prove an
embarrassment  to  US  foreign policy, allowing unfriendly nations to raise
charges of "Imperialist bullying".

The best intelligence information available from Djakarta and from the East
Timor  resistance  movement  leads  the US Government and the UN to believe
that a swift intervention will not only prevent large scale loss of life by
the  civilian  population  of  East  Timor,  but  could  also bring about a
collapse  of  the  current military dictatorship, and a return to democracy
for all the people of Indonesia.

SECTION III - QUICK START
-------------------------

When  you've  just got back from the computer store, ripped the shrink wrap
off  the  box  and unpacked the game, the chances are you don`t want to get
bogged  down in reading a manual and mastering all the details of running a
task force - you bought the game in order to fly.  AV-8B Harrier Assault is
designed  to  give  you  many hours of game play, simulating all aspects of
both  V/STOL and carrier flight operations, but for the moment we'll ignore
these and get you into the cockpit and into the air.

Even  if  you are an experienced flight simulation enthusiast, we recommend
that  you fly both of the sample missions detailed below.  Flying them will
give  you  a  useful  overview of the entire game, including the process of
planning and flying missions.  The experience you'll gain on these missions
will help you understand the other sections of this manual.

First you must install the game on to your hard disk and get the simulation
running.  The software is not copy protected, so you should have no problem
in getting it installed and started.

Once  the  game loads, you'll see an introductory sequence showing an AV-8B
rising  from  the  hanger  of the amphibious assault ship USS Tarawa to the
flight  deck.   Tarawa  is  the  flagship  of the task force, and once this
animated  sequence  has  ended,  you will be placed in the vessel's command
center.

The  two  AV-8B  missions  described  below  will  give you a chance to get
airborne and fly a simulated V/STOL fighter.

STARTING A BATTLE PLAN AND FLYING YOUR FIRST MISSION.

Starting the Action

1. Run TAWADS
All  battle planning and control of the landing operation is done using the
Tactical  Amphibious  Warfare  Data  System  (TAWADS) in the Command Center
aboard  the  Tarawa.  Full instructions on how to use this system are given
in  the  Task  Force  Commanders Manual, but in this section we'll give you
enough information on TAWADS to get the campaign started and fly your first
missions.

The  game  will start in the Command Center of Tarawa.  To start the action
the  commander  must  instruct  the  TAWADS  battle  computer  to  commence
operations  with  SABER,  the  pre-loaded battle plan.  Click on the TAWADS
screen  (the  central monitor showing a map of Timor on screen).  This will
open the TAWADS interface.

2. Activate a battle plan.
Your  control  pointer is limited to the BATTLE PLAN SELECTION window which
will  show  SABER  as the current battle plan.  To start this plan running,
click  on  the GO icon.  There will be a short pause as the simulation runs
in fast forward mode, taking the task force from your current position (8am
on  day  0, 2 hours sailing time from Timor) to the first waypoint at which
flight operations are scheduled.  The fleet will now be off the east tip of
East  Timor  and  the  time will be 9:3Oam.  Click on the Exit icon (bottom
right of screen) to close TAWADS.

Notice  that  a light is flashing on the white telephone in the foreground.
This  is to tell you that AV-8B missions are available to be flown.  If you
don`t  go  to  the  Pilots Briefing Room to accept a mission, after a short
delay the mission will be allocated to a Harrier flown by the computer.

Pre-Flight Preparation

1. Go to Pilots' Briefing Room 
Clicking  on  the  white  phone  will take you to the Pilots Briefing Room.
This  is dominated by a large whiteboard display, which currently shows the
missions  waiting  to  be  flown.  Combat Air Patrol is always available if
there  is  a  Harrier  on  deck.   The  next  mission  on  the  list  is an
interdiction  (ground  attack)  sortie to the east tip of East Timor.  This
area  has  only  light  defenses,  so, for your first operational sortie we
suggest  that  you  accept this mission.  Click on mission HA\1-1 to accept
it.

2. Intelligence Briefing
The whiteboard will now give you the following information:

The primary and secondary targets for your mission.

The Flight Plan for this mission, including the assigned waypoints.

The defenses you are likely to encounter.

Read this information carefully, then click on ACCEPT to continue. 

3. Aircraft Arming
The armorers will already have installed a suitable combination of ordnance
for this mission.

Click on OK to accept this weapon load.

FLYING THE MISSION

1. Takeoff

You  are in the cockpit of your aircraft, and the engine is running.  Ahead
of  you is the flight deck of Tarawa.  Press the W key to release the wheel
brakes,  then  0  (zero)  to  run the engine up to full throttle.  When you
reach  the  end of the deck pull up the nose and press the G key to retract
the  undercarriage.  From now on, the key(s) you are to press will be shown
in brackets.

2. Fly to Target

Your  left  hand MFD is showing the EHSI navigation display with waypoint 1
selected - this is your target.  Press (/) until the scale at the top right
on the EHSI reads "7".  Turn the aircraft to keep the line to this waypoint
vertical  in  the  display.   When the line shortens and the waypoint - the
small  cross  at  the end of the line - is about half-way between the outer
edge  of  the  EHSI  display  and  the aircraft symbol at the centre of the
display, you are approaching the target and should be able to see it in the
forward  view.   Don't expect the target to appear directly ahead - the Nav
system  is  only as good as the data it received from TAWADS.  Minor errors
could result in the target appearing to one side or the other of the flight
path.

3. Attacking the Target

You  will  be  using  Hydra unguided rockets to attack the target (Read the
weapons  section  of  the  "AV-8B Pilot's Manual" if you want to learn more
about  these).   Press (backspace) until HYD (followed by a number) appears
at the bottom left of HUD.  This indicates that the Hydra rockets have been
selected,  the  number  showing  how  many  rounds  each  of  the underwing
launchers  can  carry.   A  T-shaped  marker in the HUD shows the predicted
impact  point  of  the  rockets  - fly until these are over the target then
press the fire button or (space) to release the rockets.

4. Return to Tarawa

Cycle through the waypoints on the EHSI display (using the ; key) until a T
is  shown at top right of display.  This is a TACAN radio navigation beacon
carried by Tarawa as a navigation aid for its aircraft.  Either fly back to
Tarawa using the EHSI display to guide you, or select the autopilot (A) and
just  sit  back and watch it do the work of flying you back and landing the
aircraft.  Even if you've flown back manually, we'd recommend that for your
first few flights you turn the autopilot on for the landing.

When  you  have  landed, ask for a debrief by pressing (Ctrl D).  This will
take  you  to  the pilots' Briefing Room.  A summary of the success of your
mission will be shown on the whiteboard.

If  you  would like to fly another mission, click on the right hand monitor
in the briefing room to see what's available to be flown.

Time Control

If  no  AV-8B  missions  are  available  to  be flown, you can speed up the
simulation,  "fast  forwarding"  to  the  point  where  the  next batch are
ordered.   To  do  this,  go  to  the  command  centre, click on the TAWADS
console,  then  click  on  the  digital  clock  at the top right of the map
display.  A menu will open, offering the following options:

StopTime

This pauses the simulation.

Normal

The  simulation  runs in real time - this is the normal operating mode when
playing the game.

Fast

The  simulation  runs  at four times normal time.  This can be useful while
units  are  on  the  move,  but  little  else is happening - for example if
landing craft are heading from the assault ships to the beachhead.

Step 1 Min

This is an alternative method of temporarily speeding up the game.

Step Next Mission

This  advances  the game to the point where the next mission is about to be
launched.   This  allows  the player to "fast forward" through parts of the
plan  in  which  no operations are to be launched.  For example, plan SABER
contains  relatively  few  night  missions  for  the  AV-8Bs.   If none are
scheduled,  selecting  "Step  next  mission" will advance the simulation to
dawn of the next day.

Pausing the Game

You  can pause the simulation at any time to cope with phone calls or other
interuptions.   When  aboard  Tarawa, go to the Command Center and click on
its  digital clock.  If you're in the cockpit flying a mission, press the P
key.

A MORE ADVANCED SESSION

When  you`re  ready  to  learn  more  about the game, the next sortie to be
described  will  show  you  how  to  create  an  immediate mission (one not
contained in the battle plan), fly it, then save the game state.

This  example  follows on from the previous one, and assumes that it is has
been  flown.  If you've flown other sorties in the meantime, you'll have to
quit  the  game,  then  reload it, restart plan SABER, and refly that first
mission (or let the computer do it for you).

Checking on Auccess in TAWADS

When  you  have  flown your interdiction mission (if you survived) you will
recieve  a  pilots'  debrief  telling  you  how  successful  you have been.
However, as the commander you will want more of an overview telling you how
that  mission fitted into the "big picture" of the overall campaign.  While
you  were  busy  with  your own sortie, other military operations have been
under way.

To get this you must run TAWADS again.

1. Run TAWADS

From the command control room click on the TAWADS screen, this will run the
TAWADS computer.

2. Zoom into the Target

Your  previous  mission  was  to attack a fixed base on Jaco Island, at the
east  end  of  the  main  island.   Zoom  the  map view into this island by
clicking  with  the  pointer  over the island until the name "Jaco" appears
next  to  a  white square indicating a fixed base or town.  You may have to
move  your  map  view  to keep Jaco near the center of the screen.  This is
done by clicking on the MAP SCROLL icon (four arrows) at the bottom left of
the screen.

3 Open the Intelligence Window

Click on the Intelligence icon (at the top right of the screen).  This will
open a window over the top right corner of the map.

4 Select the Base to Get an Intelligence Report.

Click  on  the  white  square  by  Jaco  with the left (select) button, the
Intelligence  window  will  show the state of the selected object - in this
case, Jaco.  This is an Indonesian military base containing two buildings -
the information window will display the number remaining.

If  you  have been very successful, this will read 0, but is more likely to
be  1 or even 2!  We will assume that one of the targets remains, requiring
the  creation of an unplanned mission to send another aircraft back to Jaco
Island to attack the remaining target.

Creating an Immediate Mission in TAWADS

1. Open the AIR PLAN Window

Click on the AIR PLAN mission icon (near top left) - a window will open top
left  with  the  words  HARRIER  WAYPOINTS  in  it.  You must now enter the
waypoints for the mission.

2. Enter Mission Waypoints

Double click with the pointer over Jaco, a red waypoint icon will appear (a
pyramid with the top cut off) under the pointer.  You have now indicated to
TAWADS that Jaco is to be a waypoint for the new mission.

3. Change the Waypoint Type
 
Click  on  the  background  of  the  HARRIER  WAYPOINTS  window to open its
sub-menu.   Click on PRIMARY TARGET.  This action tells TAWADS that Jaco is
not a navigational waypoint, but a target to be attacked.

4. Finish the Mission Entry

Click  on the EXIT icon in the HARRIER WAYPOINTS window to finish the entry
of the mission - this window will close.

5. Exit TAWADS

Clicking on the TAWADS exit icon to exits the TAWADS system.

Selecting and Flying the Mission

The  red  light  on  the  Pilots' briefing Room telephone will be flashing.
Click  on  the phone to go directly to the briefing room.  Your new mission
will be shown as the second on the whiteboard.  It will be named:

INTERDICTION H\0-0

PRIMARY TARGET JACO

Follow  the  instructions in earlier PRE-FLIGHT and FLY MISSION sections to
fly  mission.   As  you  fly  combat  missions,  you will hear the sound of
explosions.   These  are  the  result  of  ground-based  combat between the
marines  and  the  Indonesian defenders.  When the mission is completed you
will  be  returned  to the Pilots briefing Room.  Clicking on the telephone
will take you back to Command Center.

Flying an Air Combat Mission

To  get  your  first  experience  of  air-to-air  combat, go to the Command
Centre,  and  use  TAWADS  to  create  an Immediate Mission with one of the
airstrips on the south coast of East Timor specified as the primary target.
Go  to  the Pilots' Briefing Room and accept the newly created mission.  As
you  approach the airstrip, defending fighters should try to intercept you.
Once you're familiar with the landscape of East Timor, you can simply go to
the  Pilots' briefing Room, accept the Air Combat Mission which is normally
available, then head for an enemy air base.

SAVING GAME STATE

Assuming  that  you  have  been  fairly  successful in your attacks on Jaco
Island,  we  will now save the state of the game, so that you can return to
it in the future.

1 Click on SAVE icon in the Command Center (a diskette on the table).  This
will open the SAVE/LOAD screen.

2 Click on one of the 10 available slots.  It will become highlighted.

3 Click onto the Save Game icon (an arrow pointing at a disk).

The  current  game  state  will be saved to the hard disk, and the selected
slot  will  now  contain  the  name  of  your  saved state.  It should read
something  like  SABER 0/9:50.  The name is made up to the name of the plan
currently  being  run,  plus  the current date and time.  The example shown
contains  Plan SABER at the state it had reached by 9:50 am on day 0 of the
campaign.

4 Click on the exit icon to return to the command center.

This  saved  game can be retrieved at any time by re-entering the SAVE/LOAD
screen,  clicking  on the slot which contains the saved game, then clicking
on the Load Game icon (an arrow pointing away from a disk).

Full  details  of-the  SAVE/LOAD  facility are provided in Section 7 of the
manual "Aboard the Tarawa".

SECTION IV - AV-8B PILOTS MANUAL
--------------------------------
 
The  McDonnell-Douglas/British  Aerospace  AV-8B  Harrier  II is the latest
member  of  a  unique  family  of vertical/short take-off fighter aircraft.
Originally  designed  in  Britain,  and taken into service by that nation's
Royal  Air  Force,  Harrier was later adopted by the US Marine Corps as the
AV-8A.   A collaborative effort involving the US and UK finally resulted in
today's much-improved AV-8B.

Only  46ft  4in long and 30ft 4in in wingspan, Harrier is smaller than many
present-day  fighters,  and  closer  in  size  to the General Dynamics F-16
Fighting  Falcon than aircraft such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and
F/A-18  Hornet.   The  factor which makes the Harrier family unique is that
the  thrust  of  its  engine  can  be  deflected from rearward to downward,
allowing the aircraft to take off and land vertically, and to hover.

Harrier  may not qualify for the adjective "beautiful" but its curved lines
are evidence of its ancestry from the classic British Hawker fighter design
team  -  an  organisation  which firmly believed that if an aircraft looked
right,  it  was right.  Like another famous British export, the Rolls Royce
automobile, the AV-8B has its own very distinctive appearance.

Its  most  distinctive  feature  is  that its single engine does not have a
single  jetpipe  in  the rear fuselage, but a total of four - two on either
side  of the center fuselage.  A single cockpit control allows the pilot to
move all four in unison through an angle of more than 90 degrees.  Known as
"thrust vectoring" this technique is used for vertical takeoff and landing,
and  hovering.   It  can  also  be  used in combat to increase the aircraft
agility  -  this  is  known as "viffing" (Vectoring In Forward Flight), and
you'll learn how to do this later in this section of the manual.

Vertical  take-off  and  landing  is  only possible if the engine thrust is
greater  than  the  total weight of the aircraft.  This is usually the case
when  landing,  since  most  of  the fuel will have been used, but can be a
problem  at  takeoff  if  the aircraft is carrying a heavy weapon load.  In
such  cases,  deflecting the nozzles downward by 30 - 40 degrees allows the
aircraft  to get airborne after a very short run.  This procedure is widely
used, so Harrier can be thought of as a Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing
(V/STOL) or even a Short Take-Off/Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft.

The  use of afterburning would turn the four nozzles into runway destroying
blowtorches,  so  Harrier does not use this technique.  All the thrust must
be provided by normal engine power.  The sheer size of the engine needed to
provide  the  required  amount  of thrust gives the aircraft its relatively
wide center fuselage and huge "elephant ears" air inlets, while the absence
of an afterburner limits the aircraft to subsonic speeds.  Maximum speed at
sea level is around 575kts (Mach 0.87), rising to Mach O.91 at altitude.

Tactical  range  - the distance the aircraft can fly loiter for long enough
to  perform a useful military mission, then fly back to base depends on the
height  at  which  you  fly  and  the weight of weapons carried.  A typical
figure with a good bomb load would be around 480nm.

A  full history and description of the Harrier family up to and even beyond
todays  AV-8B  is provided at the rear of this manual, but this information
is not needed in order to fly the aircraft.

YOUR WEAPONS

The  AV-8B can carry five types of ordnance guided missiles, "dumb" bombs",
laser-guided  bombs,  cluster  munitions, and unguided rockets.  It is also
equipped with two 25mm cannon.

Two  types  of guided missile are available.  Both are homing missiles, and
must  be  locked  onto the chosen target before being fired.  (You'll learn
how  to  do this when flying the Part Task Trainer missions described later
in  this  section  of  the  manual).   Once  fired,  the  missile will home
automatically with no further action needed on your part.

AIM-9M Sidewinder

The  AV-8B would normally carry four AIM-9M when deployed in the air-to-air
role,  or  two  (one  on each outboard wing pylon) for self defense when on
strike missions.  The AIM-9 flies at a speed of around Mach 2.5, and uses a
nose-mounted  infra-seeker  seeker  to  home  onto an aircraft target.  The
seeker  responds  to  heat.   Early-model AIM-9s could only home on the hot
engine exhaust of the target, but the -9M model is sensitive enough to home
onto the aircraft from any direction.  Maximum range is around 19,000 yards
when  fired  against  an approaching aircraft, but falls sharply when fired
against  a retreating target.  If you find yourself on the tail of an enemy
aircraft, close the range to a few thousand yards before firing.

AGM-65E Maverick

On  strike  missions,  the  AV-8B  can  carry  up  to four AGM-65E Maverick
missiles.   These  have  a  maximum  range of up to 26,000 yards, so can be
fired  from  outside  the range of light SAMs and AAA defending the target.
The AGM-65E version of Maverick was specifically designed for close support
of Marine operations.  It homes not against heat but a bright spot of laser
light.   When  a target needs to be attacked using Maverick, the Marines in
the  front  line  will  use  a man-portable laser designator to shine laser
light  onto  the  target.  The small amount of laser light reflected by the
target  will be detected by the seeker head of the AGM-65E, which will home
onto  the  illuminated target.  The warhead weighs 300lb, so a single round
should be enough to destroy a tank, bunker or artillery position.

AGM-88 HARM

The  High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile is a specialized weapon developed to
destroy  enemy radars.  Its sophisticated seeker head is designed to detect
and  lock  onto  radar  signals,  guiding the weapon to a direct hit on the
radar.   The only counter available to an enemy is to turn off the radar as
soon as the Harm is launched.  If he turns off too late, Harm will continue
its  Night  by "dead-reckoning", landing as close as possible to the radar.
Maximum range of Harm is about 10 miles.

GENERAL PURPOSE BOMBS

Often  referred to as "iron" bombs, these simple but effective weapons have
been  used  in  combat  since  the  First World War.  They take the form of
streamlined metal casings packed with explosives, and fitted with fuzes and
stabilising  fins.   For low-level strikes, retarded bombs are used.  These
incorporate  a drag-producing device such as pop-out fins or a tail-mounted
parachute.   These slow the weapon after release, so that the aircraft will
be  a  safe  distance  away  by the time the bombs hit their target.  Bombs
range in weight from 250lb to 2,000lb.  The AV-8B can carry up to 16 of the
smaller sizes, but only a few of the largest.

"Iron" bombs are a relatively inexpensive weapon, but are only as effective
as  the  pilot  who  aims  them.   A bomb which misses the target is a bomb
wasted.  During the Vietnam war half the bombs released by US pilots landed
within  150  -  200ft  of  the target.  During Desert Storm in 1991, better
training  and  improved  aircraft  had  but  this figure to around 30-40ft.
Despite  this  small  distance,  the  success  rate  of "iron bomb" attacks
against  Iraqi  targets was around 30 per cent.  Tanks, bunkers, and troops
who  have  time to "dig in" are heavily protected, so only a direct or near
direct hit will be effective.

Laser Guided Bombs (LGBs)

First  used  during  the  Vietnam  War LGBs (often known as "smart" bombs")
combine  the body of a general purpose bomb with an add-on laser seeker and
control  fins.   Like the AGM-65E Maverick, these rely on laser designation
by  friendly  ground  forces.  They need to be locked on to a target before
being  released, then home automatically against targets.  LGBs combine the
explosive power of a bomb with the precision of a guided missile.

The  most  common  US  patterns  are the GBU-10 (based on the Mk 84 2,000lb
bomb)  the GBU-12 (based on the Mk 82 500lb bomb), and the GBU-16 (based on
the  Mk  83 1,000lb bomb).  During Desert Storm, US LGBs had a success rate
of around 90 per cent.

Cluster Munitions

These are the pilot's equivalent of a blast from a shotgun.  Like a general
purpose   bomb,   cluster  munitions  are  unguided,  and  thus  relatively
inaccurate,  The explosive payload consists not on a single large explosive
charge,  but  of hundreds of small bomblets.  Just before impact, a cluster
munition  bursts  open,  scattering  these  over  the target area.  Cluster
Munitions  are  highly  effective  when  used  against  tanks, soft-skinned
vehicles  such as trucks, and troops caught in open terrain.  Several types
are  in  US  service.   The  Rockeye Mk20 Mod 0 is designed for use against
tanks, and contains 247 anti-tank bomblets, each weighing just under 2lb.

Unguided Rockets

Carried  in  underwing  launch pods holding between six and 18 rounds Hydra
2.75"  rockets  fly  an  unguided  course to the target.  In the hands of a
pilot  with  a  steady  aim,  unguided rockets can be used against the same
sorts  of  targets  as  cluster  munitions.  (When flying your first combat
sorties, you'll find the Hydra rocket an effective and easily aimed weapon.
Equip  your aircraft with two or more 18 round launchers, and select a four
or eight-round salvo size).

25mm Cannon

Like most fighters, the AV-8B is fitted with a gun.  The GAU-12/U Equaliser
is  a  five-barrelled  rotary  cannon  based  on  the  configuration of the
legendary  Gatling.  Driven by pneumatics, the weapon has a maximum rate of
fire of 60 rounds per second.  The 25mm ammunition comes in three varieties
-  Armor  Piercing  Incendiary  (API), High Explosive Incendiary (HEI), and
Tactical Personnel (TP), and has a muzzle velocity of 3,500ft/sec.

The  cannon  is not mounted within the fuselage, but in one of two fairings
on  either  side of the lower fuselage.  The port-side fairing contains the
gun,  the  starboard fairing the weapon's 300 rounds of ammunition.  Rounds
pass from the magazine to the gun via a linkless feed.

Each  pod  incorporates  a  flat  surface  known  as  a  strake.   When the
undercarriage  is  lowered, the gear door is positioned across the fuselage
just  behind the strakes, while a retractable fence is extended in front of
them.   The  resulting "box" traps the cushion of air created by the engine
exhaust  gases  bouncing  from  the  ground  as  the aircraft hovers at low
altitude, creating extra lift.

THE AV-8B COCKPIT

The  cockpit  display  in this simulation is a close replica of that in the
real  aircraft.   The  game designers have made some minor modifications in
order  to  improve the player's forward view but apart from that, the basic
layout of the cockpit would be familiar to any AV-8B pilot.  The only AV-8B
pilots  who might find it unfamiliar are those of Britain's Royal Airforce,
which has fitted an extra display screen in the cockpit.

Like  the  simulation  model itself the cockpit is as realistic as possible
while  still  being  able  to  run  on a personal computer.  There are more
accurate  simulators,  but  they're classified, your annual salary wouldn't
match  th  price  tag,  and  you'd have to undergo a long interview at your
nearest  USMC  recruiting  office,  the  rigors of "boot camp", then a long
training course before getting your hands on them.

If  you`ve  used  other  flight  simulators, you may find this one a little
difficult  at  first.   The aircraft simulation is based on a sophisticated
aerodynamic  model  is  designed to provide as true a representation of the
aircrafts  performance  as  possible.   Although  this  makes AV-8B Harrier
Assault  one  of  the most realistic simulators ever written for a personal
computer, it makes the aircraft quite sensitive to control inputs giving it
a  more  "live"  feel  than on many other products.  The novice player will
find that it's easy to overcorrect with the controls.

If  this  is the case, pressing Ctrl S will switch in a simpler model, with
smoother  and  more  easily  controlled  responses.   This may be closer in
"feel"  to  the flight simulator software you're used to, and will help you
get into the game as quickly as possible, without having to worry about the
complexities of the full aircraft model.

When  you`re ready for a greater challenge, pressing Ctrl A will return you
to  the  advanced  model, giving you a more accurate simulation of the real
aircraft  and  making  greater demands on your piloting skill.  Once you`ve
become  used to this more accurate simulation, you're unlikely to return to
the simple model.  The advanced model has a fascination of its own.

Flight Information.

The  pilot  has  six  basic  sources  of information - the view through the
canopy, the Head-Up Display (HUD), two Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) and a
single  Up Front Control Panel (UFCP).  All of the above data is duplicated
on  conventional  instruments mounted on the aircraft control panel.  These
will  allow  the  aircraft  to  keep  flying if the HUD fails due to combat
damage.   These  reversionary  instruments  are  mounted in two rows at the
center of the instrument panel:

ASI                             Attitude        Altitude       AOA
AOA

Each will be described after the HUD or MFD function it duplicates.

Looking Aronnd

The  normal  view  in flight is forward.  Pressing the F1 key lets you look
up.  F3 and F4 look 60 degrees to the left and right respectively, while F5
and  F6  allow  you  to  look 120 degrees backward over your left and right
shoulders.  F2 returns your view to the normal forward direction.

The Head-Up Display (HUD)

The  primary  source  of  information  for the pilot is the Head-Up-Display
(HUD),  a  reflective surface mounted ahead of the pilot's eyes.  Projected
onto  this  is  all  the  flight,  navigation,  target  and  weapon  aiming
information needed to carry out a combat mission.

The main symbols visible in the HUD are used for navigation:

LFD

Directly  in  the  center of the HUD, the Longitudinal Fuselage Datum (LFD)
shows  the  direction  in  which  the aircraft nose is pointing.  This is a
fixed  mark.   If  the  HUD fails during a combat mission, the LFD could be
used  as  a  simple sight for the cannon or unguided rockets, but the pilot
will  have  to  aim  high  to  compensate  for  the  ballistic  drop of the
projectiles  caused by gravity and off to one side or another to compensate
for the turn rate on his aircraft.

Velocity Vector

This  moving  marker shows the direction in which the aircraft is currently
flying.   In  normal  flight,  this  will be close to the horizon.  If it's
above the horizon, you're gaining height; if it's below the horizon, you're
losing  height.   If  the aircraft is in a dive, it will be pointing at the
ground,  showing  the  point where the aircraft will crash if it remains on
this course and speed.

V/STOL Velocity Vector

The normal Velocity Vector cannot cope with the slow speeds associated with
nozzle borne and hovering flight.  At speeds of less than 100kts (knots), a
V/STOL  velocity  vector  mark automatically appears in the HUD.  This will
give  some indication of where the aircraft is currently headed, but as the
airspeed  slows to a hover even this marker will not be reliable.  When the
predicted touchdown point falls below the aircraft nose it can no longer be
seen in the HUD, so the marker falls to the bottom of the HUD field of view
and stays there.

Pitch Bars

A  series  of  vertical pitch bars indicate the amount by which the nose is
above  or  below the horizon.  These bars remain parallel to the horizon at
all  times,  so can be used to keep the wings level when the horizon is not
visible  in  a  steep  climb or dive.  The bars are at 10 degree intervals,
with  90  degrees  being  represented  by  a  cross.  If one of these cross
markers  is  in  the  center  of  the  HUD, the aircraft is either climbing
vertically or is in a vertical dive.

Aircraft  altitude is also displayed on the artificial horizon, the central
instrument  on the top row of three circular dials.  The single bar on this
instrument  is  the equivalent of the zero-degree pitch bar in the HUD.  It
remains  parallel to the horizon, and moves up or down to indicate aircraft
pitch.

VSI (Vertical Speed Indicator)

A  vertical  bar  at  the right hand side of the HUD indicates the speed at
which  the  aircraft is gaining or losing height, a small horizontal marker
protruding  to the left of the line indicating the center point - zero rate
of  climb.   The  further the VSI line stretches above this zero point, the
faster  you're  climbing;  the further it stretches down, the faster you`re
losing  height.   A  second marker below the center point shows the maximum
descent   speed  which  the  aircraft  undercarriage  can  withstand.   VSI
information  is  also  displayed on the right hand analog instrument of the
bottom row of three.

Altitude

A  box  at the upper right of the HUD shows the aircraft height in feet The
aircraft  has  two  altimeters - the radar altimeter indicates height above
the  terrain,  while the barometric altimeter shows height above sea level.
You  can  switch  from  one  to  the  other using the R key; when the radar
altimeter is in use, an "R" symbol will be displayed in the HUD just to the
left  of  the  altitude  box.   The  radar altimeter is useful in low-level
flight,  since  it shows your height above the ground.  It only operates at
heights  of  below  5,000ft.   Above  that  height,  you`ll need to use the
barometric altimeter.  An analog altimeter is also provided at the top left
of  the  array  of  six  round-dial cockpit instruments.  the large pointer
makes  one  complete  revolution per 1,000ft, while the smaller advances by
one "hour mark".

Airspeed

A second box at the upper left of the HUD shows airspeed in knots (nautical
miles per hour).  This information is shown in analog form on the air speed
indicator (ASI) at the top left of the bank of six cockpit instruments.

Heading

A  horizontal  band  running  across  the  top of the HUD shows the current
heading in tens of degrees.  00 is north, 09 is east, 18 is south and 27 is
west.   The  direction  in  which  you're  flying  is  indicated by a small
vertical  tick  below the heading display.  A V-shaped steering cue visible
above  the  heading  display  is  linked  to  the  aircraft Nav system.  It
indicates  the  direction  you  must  steer  to  reach  the next navigation
waypoint  or  target.   This  gives  no  indication  of range, and can only
indicate  angles within the HUD field of view if the steering cue is at one
end  of  the  heading  indicator  turning in that direction will eventually
bring  it  moving  toward the center of the heading indicator.  (Target and
waypoint bearings, along with distance to be flown to reach them, are shown
in the EHSI display which is described later in this section).

A  second compass if provided in the form of an analog horizontal situation
indicator (HSI) at the center of the bottom row of instruments.

Nozzle Angle

The AV-8B Harrier II obtains its hovering and VTOL capability from the fact
that  the  four nozzles of its Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine can be moved from
the  full  aft  position  to  vertically downwards.  The topmost of the two
numbers  visible  directly below the VSI indicator shows the angle to which
the  nozzles are currently set.  This varies from 0 (fully aft) to 110 (110
degrees).   Nozzle  angle  is also shown in analog form on an instrument at
the  top  right  of the instrument panel.  A small mark on the edge of this
instrument  shows  the  correct  nozzle angle for hovering.  This is not 90
degrees,  but  80  degrees  -  Harrier  sits  on  its  undercarriage with a
pronounced nose high stance.

There  are  two  ways of moving the nozzles.  Shift = and Shift - swing the
nozzles downward and rearward respectivcly, while Shift 1 to Shift 0 select
the nozzle position in ten degree steps between 0 degrees and 100 degrees.

Engine RPM

The  number  directly below the Nozzle Angle shows engine RPM.  Full thrust
responds  to  a  figure  of around 98 per cent, pre take off idle is around
30-40 per cent.  RPM is also shown on numerically on the instrument panel.

AOA (Angle of Attack)

This  shows  the  angle  between  the  fore-and-aft  axis  of  the wing (an
imaginary  line  drawn  between  the  wing  leading and trailing edges) and
airflow  across  the  wing  caused  by  the  aircraft's  forward  velocity.
Increasing the AOA by a small amount increases the amount of lift generated
by  the wing.  Take this process too far, and the wing stalls (typically at
an AOA of around 20 degrees).

When the wing stalls, the airflow across its surfaces is disturbed, and the
lift  falls  off  dramatically.  In a conventional aircraft, control of the
aircraft  is momentarily lost, the nose falling until the AOA is low enough
to  restore  normal  lift.  By swivelling its engine nozzles, an AV- 8B can
substitute  engine  thrust for lift, so will remain controllable beyond the
stall, and even down to the hover.  An analog AOA indicator is available at
the bottom left hand of the six cockpit instruments.

G Force

This  shows the G force currently being experienced by the aircraft and its
pilot.   The  airframe can accept more G force than the pilot.  At G levels
of  more than around 9 g, he will begin to "grey out" as the G force drains
blood  from  his  head  and  upper torso to the lower torso and legs.  This
causes  a  dimming  of  vision,  or  if  the G load is high enough, loss of
consciousness.   Pushing  the  control  column sharply forward can have the
opposite  effect,  the  resulting  negative G forces pushing blood from the
pilot's torso to his head.  This will create "red out."

Forward-Looking Infra Red (FLIR) System

The  version  of Harrier you are flying is equipped for night attacks.  The
time  of day is reflected by changing light level in the external view seen
through the canopy.  This will dim during dawn and dusk, and darken further
at  night.   For  night  flying  you must use the FLIR night vision system.
This  is  turned  on  by pressing the I (capital i) key, and will project a
full-sized  green  thermal  image  of  the  outside  world  into  the  HUD,
superimposing this on the external scene.

Multi-Function Displays

The  cockpit  also includes two Multi-Function Displays - the screens which
can  be  configured  to one of four modes.  Use the [ key to cycle the left
MFD through its available modes, and the ] key to cycle the right hand MFD.
In  this  way you can set the MFDs to the configuration with which you feel
most  comfortable.  The same display cannot be selected on both MFDs at the
same  time, so a little manipulation may be needed to get the displays into
the configuration you prefer.

STORES DISPLAY - This shows the number and type of weapon available on each
of  the  aircraft's  underwing  pylons, also the number of rounds of cannon
ammunition,  chaff  cartridges  and  flares  available  for  use.   It also
indicates  which  type  of weapon is currently selected, and in the case of
bombs,  laser-guided bombs or unguided rockets, the number of weapons which
will be released when the fire button is pressed.

EHSI  -  Electronic  Horizontal  Situation  Indicator (EHSI) mode shows the
aircraft  in  symbolic form, surrounded by a compass rose.  This display is
centered  about  the aircraft.  The top of the screen always represents the
direction  directly  ahead  of  the  aircraft.   As the aircraft turns, the
compass  rose  moves  to  the  correct  orientation.   When  a  waypoint is
selected,  the  EHSI  displays  this as a small cross, and draws a steering
line  whose  angle indicates the direct to steer and whose length indicates
the distance to be flown.

The  steering  information  is echoed by the steering cue at the top of the
HUD.  The scale of the EHSI display can be toggled by the / (slash) key, so
that  the distance from the center of the display to the compass rose is 7,
15,  30 or 60 nautical miles.  The other type of marker seen on the ESHI is
a cluster of three dots.  These show all the other waypoints currently with
the range setting of the EHSI.

Before  takeoff  a  series  of  waypoints  is  automatically  stored in the
aircrafts  Nav  system,  and  you'll  be given details of these when you're
assigned a mission in the Pilots Briefing Room.  The system can store up to
eight  waypoints  (numbered  1-8),  also  a waypoint T (the TACAN beacon on
Tarawa),  and  a  waypoint  zero.   The Nav system can be switched from one
waypoint to another by pressing the ; (semicolon) key.  The waypoint in use
is  indicated at the top right-hand corner of the EHSI, and on a readout at
the foot of the instrument panel.

Waypoint  T  -  the TACAN radio-navigation beacon carried by Tarawa - is an
important  feature of the Nav system.  Selecting waypoint T at the end of a
mission  allows  the  pilot to find his way back to the ship.  If Tarawa is
sunk, TACAN will no longer be available, but in practise this will not be a
problem.  Lose Tarawa, and you've lost the game.
 
You  can  set  waypoint  zero in flight to mark a target of opportunity - a
target  you  have  not  been briefed on, but noticed on your journey to the
target you're scheduled to attack.  A target of opportunity can be inserted
into  the  Nav  system by pointing the HUD LFD at it and pressing the Enter
key  if  you  have unexpended weapons left after knocking out your assigned
target,  you  can  get the Nav system to fly you back to waypoint 0 so that
you can use the remaining weapons on this target.  To help you re-acquire a
target  of  opportunity, its position on the ground is marked by a cross in
the HUD field of view.
 
If  the MFDs fail in flight, the analog HSI in the center of the bottom row
of  instruments  will provide you with the navigation information needed to
find the carrier.  This is always set to follow the TACAN beacon on Tarawa.
Like  the  EHSI, the analog HSI is stabilised with respect to the aircraft.
The green end of the moving indicator shows the bearing of Tarawa.

Radar  Warning  -  Like  the  EHSI,  the  Radar Warning display is aircraft
stabilised,  with  the direction of forward flight corresponding to the top
of the display.  Any spoke-like lines appearing from the centre towards the
circular  outer  indicate that a sensitive receiver within the aircraft has
detected  a  radar  transmission  on  that bearing.  The length of the line
gives  an  indication  of  the  strength  of the detected signal.  The more
powerful  the  signal,  the  closer  the  threat  radar  is  likely  to be.
Concentric  circles  on  the this display help the pilot judge the relative
strength  of  any signals detected.  A Missile Launch Warning detector will
sound  a  warbling  alarm  tone  whenever  a  SAM  or air to air missile is
launched against your aircraft.

ARBS  -  The  final MFD mode is linked to the aircraft's nose mounted Angle
Rate  Bombing System.  This consists of a laser spot tracker linked with an
imager.  This is used for Automatic Bombing, and is described later in this
section.

Up-Front Control Panel

The  complex  electronic  warfare  (EW) systems aboard Tarawa and the other
ships of the task force will monitor Indonesian tactical communications, so
will be able to tell if fighters are likely to intercept your mission.  The
airspace  above  East  Timor  is being continuously monitored by Boeing E-3
Sentry  Airborne  Early Warning and Control (AWACS) aircraft operating from
the US base at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean so an E-3 will always be on
hand  to  warn  of any enemy fighters if these are operating in your patrol
area.

These  warnings  will appear on the Up-Front Control Panel.  Threat bearing
will  be  shown  in terms of the clock face, with 12 o`clock being straight
ahead,  3  o`clock  directly to the right.  9 o'clock directly to the left,
and  6  o`clock  directly  to  the  rear.   Targets marked H are above your
altitude,  so  will probably be fighters.  Those marked L are below you, so
are probably helicopters.  Those marked C-130 are Hercules transports AWACS
data is updated every five seconds.

Autopilot

Pressing  the A key will toggle the autopilot off or on.  When engaged, the
autopilot  will fly you to the currently selected waypoint, and if you dont
switch  it  off  through  all  subsequent waypoints.  During this time, the
normal  flying controls will have no effect.  When the autopilot is engaged
an  AUTO  indication  will  appear  in the HUD.  An indication will also be
presented at the left hand side of the instrument panel.

The  autopilot  can  be  used  to  fly the aircraft while the pilot is busy
selecting  armament or changing MFD modes, or as a convenient way of flying
from  one waypoint to another.  If the Nav system is set to waypoint T (the
TACAN  beacon  on  Tarawa),  and  the  autopilot is engaged it will fly the
aircraft  back to the ship, and even carry out the landing.  Landing aboard
Tarawa can be difficult, so beginners will find this facility useful.

The  aircraft  also incorporates a Stability Augmentation and Attitude Hold
System  (SAAHS) designed to tame the natural instability which results from
flying  partly  or totally supported by engine thrust.  The aircraft can be
flown  without  SAAHS,  but one pilot has described the experience as being
"like  trying  to balance an egg on a knife edge".  In this simulation, the
SAAHS  is  always  activated,  so  you should`nt have too much trouble when
trying to hover.  To show the capability of the system to journalists taken
for  demonstration flights in the two-seat trainer version of the aircraft,
pilots  have  been  known  to  take  both  hands off the controls while the
aircraft is hovering.

Fuel

The  amount  of  fuel  left  in  the  tanks is shown on an instrument panel
indicator.   Multiply this figure by 10 to get the amount of remaining fuel
in  pounds.   Judging what will be the "Bingo" fuel state for the mission -
the  amount needed to get you back to the ship - is not easy.  When you get
to  the combat zone over East Timor.  check the amount of fuel you`ve used.
Two,  three  or  even  four times that amount might be a reasonable "Bingo"
value, leaving you a good margin for emergencies.

Several  circumstances  could see you running low on fuel during the return
trip.   Tarawa will have moved since you left her, and could now be further
away.   Minor  battle  damage  may  be  causing  you  to  lose  fuel  at an
uncomfortably  high  rate.  If enemy fighters catch you on the return trip,
you'd better have enough fuel for a session of dogfighting at full thrust.

When the Fuel state drops to "Bingo" level, head for Tarawa without further
delay.   Unlike a full size aircraft carrier, Tarawa has no tanker aircraft
able to top up your tanks.  Get this one wrong, and you`ll be examining the
Timor Sea in close up from the comfort of an inflatable dinghy.

Jet-Pipe Temperature

A  sensor  in the aft section of the engine measures the temperature within
the aft nozzles of the Pegasus turbofan, and the result is displayed on the
instrument  panel.   If  this  rises  above normal you could have an engine
problem.   If  you've  taken  combat  damage,  keep  a  watch  on  jet pipe
temperature.   An  abnormally high value could be the first indication of a
possible engine fire.  If the jet pipe temperature misbehaves, head back to
Tarawa.   The  maintenance technicians can change an engine in a few hours,
but  they  can't  build  you  a new Harrier if you crash en route due to an
engine problem which you`ve ignored.

Fuel Flow
 
Mounted  to the right of the Jet-Pipe Temperature indicator, this shows the
rate at which fuel is being used by the engine.

Undercarriage

Harrier  has  a novel undercarriage of bicycle form.  The main gears are in
the  lower fuselage.  Forward and aft of the engine, while two outriggers -
one about mid span on each wing provide the stability needed to prevent the
aircraft tipping over if the ship rolls heavily, or you make a bad landing.
Use  the  G  key to raise and lower the undercarriage.  It should be raised
after  take  off  to reduce drag.  Failing to lower it on landing will send
your  aircraft  to  the  hanger  for  extensive maintenance.  Undercarriage
position is shown on the Indicator Strip (see below).

Wheel Brakes

Undercarriage  wheel  brakes  are  controlled by the W key.  Attempting the
rolling  takeoff without removing the brake is bad for the tyres, and could
see  you  crashing to the sea.  If the take off roll seems slow, hit W then
shift  5.  The thrust from the downward tilted engine nozzles will probably
compensate  for  your  low forward speed.  The state of the brakes shown on
the Indicator Strip (see below).

Air Brake

A  large  air  brake is positioned under the fuselage, just aft of the main
landing  gear.   Extending  the  air  brake  increases  drag,  slowing  the
aircraft.   This  can be useful in combat, where it can reduce your speed -
and thus your turning circle in a dogfight, or in a diving attack.  The air
brake is controlled by the B key and its position is shown on the Indicator
Strip (see below).  Just remember to retract it when it's no longer needed!

Indicator Strips

A  vertical  column  of  five lamps are mounted to the left of the Up Front
Display.  These show the status of several important sub systems:

Unused          Undercarriage        Wheel Brakes      Air Brake
Unused

Warnings

A  vertical column of warning lamps is mounted to the right of the Up-Front
Display.   The  large  FIRE  indicator will light in the event of an engine
fire.  The others will illuminate if any of the following system fail:

Hydraulics         HUD          Nav system      Multi-Function Display
Unused

If  the  hydraulic  system fails, your undercarriage and air brakes will be
unable  to move from their current positions.  Break off the mission return
to  Tarawa,  and  make  the  best landing you can.  HUD, Nav system and MFD
failures  will  make effective attacks near impossible, although the LFD in
the  HUD  can  be  used  as  an impromptu sight for the cannon and unguided
rockets.   Use  the  reversionary  instruments  to  fly  back to Tarawa for
repairs.

Further   malfunction  indications  are  provided  by  a  vertical  row  of
indicators  at the far right hand side of the instrument panel.  These warn
of  sub-system  failures,  and  in practice are of no direct concern to the
pilot.   If  any  light,  one  of  the main warning lamps will also be lit,
identifying the major system which has been affected.

Ejection Seat

If  battle  damage causes you to lose control of the aircraft or if you run
out  of  fuel  and  are  about  to crash, press Control E to eject from the
aircraft.   If  you survive ejection, you will be picked up either from the
sea  or  East  Timorese territory, and returned to Tarawa for a post-flight
debriefing.

FLIGHT CONTROLS

The  main  flight  control of any modern fixed-wing aircraft is the control
column or "joystick", so the easiest way to control the AV-8B simulation is
with  an  analog joystick.  Just as in a real aircraft, forward movement of
the joystick moves the nose of the aircraft down, putting the aircraft into
a  dive, while backward movement raises the nose, putting the aircraft into
a climb.  Moving the joystick to the right rolls the aircraft to the right,
while movement to the left rolls the aircraft left.

If  your  joystick  is spring loaded, the spring force will help you fly by
automatically  centering  the control stick after each maneuver.  The force
of the springs will also provide a crude representation of the stick forces
felt by the pilot.

A  joystick  needs  to  be calibrated before playing the game.  This can be
done  in  two  ways, both of which are available from the aircraft cockpit.
Both are described in the Pre-Flight Customisation section below.

The  next  best control method is to use a mouse.  You should visualise the
mouse  as being the top of an imaginary control stick, moving it forward to
push  the  nose of the aircraft down, pulling it back to lift the nose, and
moving  it  right  and left to command the aircraft to roll.  Unfortunatley
the mouse will do nothing to help you return the imaginary control stick to
the  central position.  To get around this problem, pressing the Z key with
mouse  control selected will re-center the aircrafts flying controls at the
current position of the mouse.

The final method of simulating a control column is to use the arrow keys on
the  keyboard.  Once again, the trick is to imagine these as moving the tip
on  an  imaginary control column.  The Up Arrow will push the aircraft nose
down,  while the Down Arrow pulls it up.  The Right and Left Arrows command
the  aircraft to roll.  Like a mouse, the Arrow keys can do nothing to help
you center the controls.  A flight simulation really needs a good joystick.
If  you  don't  own one, the advanced aircraft model contained in the AV-8B
Harrier  Assault  software is the best excuse we can think for investing in
one.

The  other  significant  flight  controls  are the rudder and trim.  Rudder
control  is  via the < and > keys.  In flight, it can be used to make small
horizontal  aiming  corrections,  or  to  final  heading  corrections  when
landing.   In the hover it turns the aircraft by operating the yaw reaction
jets, while on the ground, it steers the aircraft via its nosewheel.

Pitch  trim  can  be  inserted  using  the  + and - keys on the keypad, and
removed  using  the  * on the keypad.  The + key raises the nose; the - key
lowers it.

If  you`ve  never  used  a  flight  simulator  and  are unfamiliar with the
controls  of  an  aircraft, we strongly recommend that you read the Primary
Training section of part 8 "Flight Training" of this manual.

THE USE OF VECTORED THRUST

Until now there has been no true PC based simulation of a vectored - thrust
jet  fighter.  Whether this is your first flight-simulation purchase or the
latest  of  many you must learn to cope with the aircrafts unique system of
vectored  nozzles.   To  help you, the following flight procedures describe
how  to use this capability.  Most are based on flight procedures contained
in the official Harrier manual.  The fact that they work on this simulation
is  testimony  to the accuracy with which the aircraft has been modelled by
the software.

Vertical Take-Off

This  can  only  be flown with light weapon loads.  Maximum take-off weight
(shown  on  the  right center of the Weapon Loading Screen) must not exceed
the maximum engine thrust of 23,800lb

1. Set the nozzles to 80 degrees, then select full engine power.

2. At a height of 50ft, move the nozzles slowly backwards.

3. At  a  forward  speed of around 180kts, the wings will generate enough
   lift to support the aircraft.

Rolling Take-Off

1. Set  the  engine  nozzles  to  between 40 and 50 degrees, depending on
   aircraft weight.  The heavier the aircraft, the greater the angle should
   be.

2. Remove the wheelbrakes, and select full engine power.

3. Apply a slight back pressure on the controls as the aircraft leaves the
   flight deck, then hold the nose just above the horizontal.

4. When  the  aircraft reaches a forward speed of more than 180kts, raise
   the undercarriage and the engine nozzles.

Tarawas  flight  deck  is  long enough to allow a take-off with the nozzles
left  fully  aft.   You  will  lose  around 20ft of height in the first few
seconds of flight, so keep the nose above the horizontal until the aircraft
has regained height.

Short Rolling Take-Off

This  is  the  procedure used to minimise takeoff run when operating out of
very  short land strips.  You won't need to use it in the game; it has been
included  here  for  your  interest.   Try  to get airborne in the shortest
possible distance while carrying a heavy weapon load.

1. Remove the wheelbrakes, and select full engine power.

2. As the aircraft approaches the end of the flight deck, hit (Shift 5) to
   set the nozzles to 50 degrees.

3. When clear of the ground, hold the nose just above the horizontal.

4. At a height of 50ft, move the nozzles slowly backwards.

5. At  a  forward  speed of around 180kts, the wings will generate enough
lift to support the aircraft.

Returning to the Hover

1. Jettison all unused weapons (Ctrl-R)

2. Set the nozzles to 20 degrees.

3. Increase the nozzle angle to 40 degrees as you approach the ship.

4. At  an  altitude of around 100ft, and about 1,200 yards from the ship,
   move the nozzles to 90 degrees.

Control in the Hover

Once  the aircraft is stabilized in the hover, you'll probably find that it
is not over the intended landing spot.  To move the aircraft in the desired
direction,  the  line  of the vectored engine thrust must be moved from the
vertical.  There are two ways of doing this:

1. Slightly  decreasing the nozzle angle will direct the thrust backward,
   giving  a small forward velocity to the aircraft.  Increasing the nozzle
   angle  will  move  the  thrust  forward,  resulting  in a small rearward
   velocity.

2. Pushing the nose downward slightly will deflect the thrust line enough
   to move the aircraft forward, while pulling it up will move the aircraft
   rearward.   Using sideways movements of the control column will roll the
   aircraft slightly in the direction of control column movement.

In both cases, the rudder can be used to turn the aircraft horizontally.

Vertical Landing from the Hover

1. Apply  power  as  needed  to  maintain your height and use the control
   column to position the aircraft for landing.

2. Once in position, reduce the engine rpm by a few per cent.

3. At touchdown, close the throttle to idle.

4. Move the nozzles to 0 degrees, then apply the wheelbrakes and shut down
the engine.

VIFFING (Vectoring in Forward Flight)

The  AV-8B has a relatively low top speed and effective ceiling compared to
most fighters, but the high level of installed thrust gives it a phenomenal
acceleration in flight, while rotating the nozzles forward provides equally
impressive  amounts  of  braking.   The aircraft is at its best when flying
below  10,000ft; tactics are more important than brute power maneuvers.  In
air combat, the Harrier pilot can use the vectoring nozzles to out-maneuver
a conventional fighter.  The following techniques may be worth trying:

1. By  lowering  the nozzles, the pilot can increase the turn rate of his
   aircraft, trading speed for turn rate.

2. If the Harrier is being pursued by an enemy fighter, moving the nozzles
   to  100  degrees will sharply reduce forward speed, forcing a pursuer to
   overshoot, perhaps to the point where he becomes the pursued.

3. Lowering  the  nozzles  at  the  top of a loop will pitch the aircraft
   quickly  into  a  dive, allowing the pilot to quickly line up his gun or
   missile.

4. Set  to 100 degrees or more, the nozzles can act as an brake, allowing
   the aircraft to dive steeply without a rapid build-up of speed.

5. If  a fast dive is needed, this can be done at full power.  Instead of
   reducing  power  for the pull-out, the pilot can lower the nozzles, turn
   at the maximum G possible, yet still have full power available after the
   pullout to ensure fast acceleration.

PRE-FLIGHT CUSTOMISATION

The  first  time  you  enter the cockpit in a game-playing session, you may
wish  to  customise  some of the features of this simulation.  Pressing ESC
will open a menu with the following options:

Controls

Aboard  Tarawa,  the  game  can  be  controlled  by the keyboard, mouse, or
joystick,  but  in  the  air only one method of command can be active.  The
options for aircraft control are - Joystick, Mouse, or Keyboard.  Selecting
joystick will open a further menu offering Calibrate, and Save as Default.

After selecting calibrate, move the joystick to each of its four corners in
turn.   Once  you've  done that, press either button to end the calibration
process.   To  make  a  permanent  record  of  this  calibration which will
automatically load every time you start the game, around its limits.  press
ESC to re-open the control menu, then select Joystick, and Save as Default.
The  joystick can be recalibrated at any time by pressing the Z key, moving
the stick around its limits and pressing either of its keys.

Display

If  you find that the game does not run smoothly the two options offered in
this  menu  will help reduce the demands it is making on your computer.  As
its  name  suggests, cancelling the Horizon Shading options will remove the
simulated  atmospheric  effects  which  reduce visibility near the horizon.
Selecting Fast Cockpit Draw will replace the normal cockpit display with an
alternative  version  which  presents  the same displays and information in
slightly simpler form.

Simulation

The  default  conditions  here  are  for  the  effects  of G Grey Out to be
simulated,  and  for the game to use the Advanced flight model.  The latter
menu item is also controlled by the Ctrl-S and Ctrl-A keys.

Sounds

Default  is  All  sounds, but you can opt to remove the Engine Noise, while
retaining the others.

Commander

This option returns you to the Command Center on Tarawa.

Exit to DOS

This allows you the end the game session.  Repeatedly pressing ESC from any
point in the game will eventually allow you to exit to DOS.

The  choices  you  make  will  remain in effect for the rest of the current
game-playing  session.   If  you  want  to  make these changes permanent, a
similar  menu can be found in the Save/Restore game screen.  This will save
the changes to the hard disk, so that they can be automatically loaded each
time you play the game.

PRE-FLIGHT OPERATING PROCEDURE

Details  of  missions to be flown are given during briefing sessions in the
Pilots Briefing Room.

Central  item  in  this  compartment  is a large whiteboard used to display
information  to  pilots.  On either side are monitor screens which are used
to call up further information.  Clicking on these selects the type of data
displayed on the whiteboard.

When  you  enter  the  room  from the corridor or directly from the Command
Center  the  whiteboard will show the new missions waiting to be flown.  If
you  want  to  see  this at any other time, click on the right hand monitor
screen.

The  currently  available missions are shown on the whiteboard in two- line
summary form:

<mission type>

Primary Target <type> at <name>

CLOSE AIR SUPPORT

Primary Target fuel dumps at DILI

As  an  AV-8B  pilot,  you  can be tasked with five types of mission during
Operation Ocean Saber.

Combat Air Control

Objective:   To  fly top cover for the fleet or ground forces, engaging any
destroying  any Indonesian aircraft found the in air.  At least one Harrier
will always be available to fly CAP missions.

Waypoints: No waypoints will be programmed into the aircraft's Nav system.

Default weapons: Sidewinder; cannon.

Reconnaissance

Objective:   To  observe the battle area, and to relay intelligence back to
TAWADS  in  order to provide a more compete tactical picture of the current
state of the campaign.

Waypoints:   Automatically  programmed into the aircraft`s Nav system using
TAWADS data.

Default  weapons:  ALQ-164 jamming pod (Its electronic systems will observe
and record Indonesian radar and radio signals); cannon.

Close Air Suppport

Objective:   To  provide fire support for US forces in direct conflict with
Indonesian  units.   Some  targets  will  be laser designated by the ground
forces, allowing pilot to use Maverick missiles and laser guided bombs.

Waypoints:    Automatically  programmed  into  the  aircrafts  Nav  system.
Targets  will  be  described  in  the  mission  briefing,  and  TAWADS will
automatically set waypoints over the targets to be attacked.

Default weapons: Laser guided bombs; Maverick; cannon.

Interdiction

Objective:  The destruction of one or more targets well behind enemy lines.
Targets  will  not  be laser designated, so must be attacked using unguided
bombs and rockets.

Waypoints:    Automatically  programmed  into  the  aircrafts  Nav  system.
Targets  will  be  described  in  the  mission  briefing,  and  TAWADS will
automatically set waypoints over the targets to be attacked.

Default weapons: Unguided rockets; unguided bombs; Sidewinder; cannon.

Air interception

Objective: Engage and destroy enemy aircraft.

Waypoints:   Automatically  programmed  into  the  aircrafts  Nav system by
TAWADS.  Waypoints will be placed at last known location of enemy planes.

Default weapons: Sidewinder; cannon; countermeasures.

To  start on one of the missions waiting to be flown, click on that mission
on  the  whiteboard.   If you don't accept one of the waiting missions, the
computer will assign a computer-controlled AV-8B to fly that sortie.

Clicking  on  an  available  mission  will display on the whiteboard a full
briefing  for  that  mission.   This  will  list  the  primary  target, any
secondary  target,  and the programmed waypoints for both.  An intelligence
briefing  will  also be given, listing the anti-aircraft ground defences at
these targets, and the risk to being intercepted by enemy fighters.

The aircrafts Nav system has pre-set uses for several waypoints.

T  The TACAN radio-navigation beacon on Tarawa.

O  Any target of opportunity marked by the pilot during the flight.

From: Squadron Commander VMA-513

To: All pilots

Subject: Nav waypoints

Before  leaving the briefing room to begin a mission, take care to note the
identity  of  every  waypoint  programmed  into your aircraft's Nav system.
Once  over  East Timor, you'll be busy enough without the added workload of
trying  to remember the purpose of each waypoint.  I know you guys are keen
to  be  heroes,  but  time  moves fast when you're flying at low level at a
speed  of more than 500kts.  Time wasted struggling with waypoint selection
is time in which a fighter, SAM or AAA battery can get a shot at you.

Accepting the mission will take you to the Weapons Loading Screen to select
the weapons you want to carry then into the cockpit ready for take off.

If  you  want to take over a mission currently being flown by the computer,
click  on  the  left  hand  monitor to bring up on the whiteboard a list of
currently-airborne  AV-8Bs.  Clicking on any one of these will put you into
the  cockpit of that aircraft.  Turn off its autopilot, and you can fly the
mission.

Always remember that after a few hours of operating experience, you`ll be a
better  pilot  than the computer.  If several missions are being flown, the
most  effective  tactic  is to let the computer fly them all, while you use
TAWADS  to monitor their progress.  As each aircraft approaches its target,
jump  into  the  cockpit,  switch  off  the  autopilot,  and fly the attack
manually.   Once  the target has been knocked out, re-engage the autopilot,
and  let  the computer fly the aircraft to its next waypoint while you jump
back  to  the  Command  Center and the TAWADS display.  This technique will
give  you  the  most  interesting part of the mission to fly, and leave the
autopilot to handle the routine parts of the sortie.

ARMING THE AIRCRAFT

Once  you've  accepted a mission, go to the flight deck, where the armorers
are  waiting  to  load weapons on your aircraft.  The aircraft arrives from
the  hanger  with all its pylons empty.  A series of buttons at the foot of
the screen allows the individual types of weapon to be selected.

There are two ways of loading your weapons.  One is to leave the job to the
armorers,  who'll already have loaded the pylons with what they consider to
be a suitable warload for the mission you're about to fly.  Details of this
combination  will  have  been  given  during the pre-flight briefing in the
Pilots Briefing Room.

If  you don't like their selection, you can remove it by clicking on CLEAN,
or modify it by removing the weapons you don't want and installing your own
choice.   If you've previously flown a mission, clicking on LAST will order
the armorers to repeat the loading you specified for that mission.

To  install a weapon of your own choice, first select it by clicking on its
button.   It  will appear in the window at the foot of the screen.  To load
this  weapon  onto the aircraft, click below the pylon you want to mount it
on  using  the left mouse (SPACE).  The chosen weapon should then appear on
the  pylon.   To  remove  an  installed  weapon, click with the right mouse
button (ENTER).

As you load weapons, an information line half-way down the screen will show
the  weight  of the weapon currently selected for loading, and the take off
weight  of  the aircraft with the current warload.  If you plan to take off
vertically the latter figure must be kept below the maximum engine thrust!

The  outboard  pylons  (the  one nearest the wingtip) on each side can only
carry  a  small load, but those inboard are closer to the wing root, so can
carry  a  greater  load  without  straining the aircraft structure.  If the
weapon won`t install on the pylon you chose try one further inboard.

In  some cases, several weapons of the same type can be carried on a single
plylon  using  a  multiple  ejection  rack (MER).  If another weapon can be
carried without exceeding the pylon's load carrying capability, clicking on
a pylon a second time will install a second weapon.  In some cases clicking
a  third  time may install a third weapon.  The limits on pylon loading can
be  found  by  experimenting.   The 25mm cannon is always carried under the
fuselage.

If  you`re  going  to  fly  a  reconnaissance  or strike mission, and enemy
fighters are expected, you might want to carry an AIM-9M Sidewinder on each
outboard  pylon.   This  reduces  the number of pylons available for air to
ground  weaponry  but  increases  your chances of shooting down any fighter
which attacks you.

Carrying  an LQ-164 jamming pod will reduce the range at which enemy radars
will  detect  your  aircraft.   This  will  make  it  difficult  -  but not
impossible  for  SAM  batteries  to  launch  radar-guided  missiles at your
aircraft.   Carrying  a jamming pod reduces your chances of being shot down
by  a  radar  guided  missile,  but takes up a valuable pylon, reducing the
weapon load you can carry.

Within  the  fuselage  of the aircraft are dispensers for chaff and flares.
These  are  released by pressing the C or F key.  The numbers remaining for
use are shown on the weapons display on the right hand MFD.

When  released, a chaff cartridge bursts to release a cloud of fine strands
of metalized glass fibre.  These form a radar-reflective false target which
can confuse a hostile radar.  If attempting to lock onto your aircraft, the
radar  may instead lock onto the chaff cloud.  If already locked on, it may
"break  lock",  following  the slow moving chaff cloud rather than the fast
moving  aircraft.   If  a radar guided SAM has been fired at your aircraft,
dropping a chaff cartridge will offer it an alternative target.

Jamming pods and chaff have no effect on anti-aircraft guns, shoulder fired
heat-seeking  SAMs  or on the less efficient optical back up guidance modes
available  of  the  SA-3  and  SA-6  SAM systems.  If a heat seeking SAM or
Sidewinder  is headed for your aircraft, release a flare.  Missiles of this
type  home  onto  heat  radiated by your aircraft.  Flares are fast-burning
devices  which  offer the missile an intense heat source which may distract
it from your aircraft.

When  attempting to distract an incoming missile, it may not be enough just
to release chaff or a flare.  For a start, timing is critical.  Release the
chaff or flares too soon, and the missile will re-acquire you; release them
too   late,   and   the  weapon  will  reach  your  aircraft  before  being
significantly decoyed.

Pulling  a  sharp  turn  in the direction of the attack will help break the
missile's  lock.  Never turn away from the missile - this gives it a simple
"tail-chase"  flight  path  and  an  easy kill.  Turning toward the missile
forces it to maneuver hard in order to follow you.

If you run out of chaff or flares, a sharp turn might still save you.  Once
again,  timing is critical.  The closer you let the missile approach before
making  the  turn, the harder it must maneuver to compensate for your sharp
change of course.  The missile does not have unlimited maneuvering power so
what  you're trying to do is to get out of its way so rapidly that it can't
follow.  If tasked with attacking a heavily defended target, you might want
to carry an external chaff/flare dispenser on one of your pylons.

While  the  armorers  were  loading  and  fuzing your chosen weapons, other
members  of  the  flight  deck  crew  were busy fuelling your aircraft, and
recharging  its  oxygen  system.   To  begin  the  mission, click on the OK
button.  This will put you in the cockpit, and start the aircrafts engine.

SELECTING AND USING WEAPDNS

Once  airborne  and  on  the way to the first waypoint, it's time to select
weapons.   Pressing  BACKSPACE  cycles  through  the  weapons available The
Stores  Display  on  one of your MFDs will show the selected pylons and the
numbers of weapons on each.
 
You can only select weapon types, not individual pylons.  Bombs or unguided
rockets  can  be  released  individually or in a salvo.  Pressing the N key
will  change  the  salvo size.  Guided missiles cannot be salvoed; only one
missile   will   be   released   for  each  press  of  the  firing  button.
Alphanumerics  at  the  bottom left of the HUD will show the type of weapon
selected,  and the number to be released in the salvo.  This information is
duplicated  on  the  MFD  Stores  Display and on cockpit indicators mounted
above the left-hand MFD.

During  the  pilot`s briefing, you`ll sometimes be warned that fighters are
expected.   On  the way to and from the target area, choosing GUN or AIM-9M
will  ensure  that you-re ready to fight back if enemy F-16s or F-5s try to
intercept you.

Use  the fire button or SPACE to release weapons.  When a multi round salvo
has  been  selected,  a  single  press will release all the weapons in that
salvo.   Rockets  fire with an interval of 0.2 seconds between rounds bombs
at  0.4 second intervals.  After releasing weapons, the fire button / space
control is inactive for 0.5 second, 0.1 second in the case of the cannon.

Cannon

The  aircrafts 25mm cannon is aimed using the velocity vector marker in the
HUD.   The  gun  has  300 rounds of ammunition, and the number remaining is
shown in the Stores Display screen on the MFD display.

Iron Bombs & Rockeye

Free  falling  bombs  can  be  delivered  on  one  of  two modes - CCIP and
automatic.  Both are available in this simulation.

CCIP Mode

Normal method of aiming iron bombs is by means of the Continuously Computed
Impact  Point (CCIP) mode.  As its name suggests, during a CCIP attack, the
aircraft's  Nav  system is continuously computing the point where the bombs
would  land  if  released  now,  and  marks  this  in  the HUD with a small
cross-shaped  aiming mark.  A line is automatically drawn between this CCIP
marker  and  the LFD.  Known as the CCIP line, this is used when delivering
bombs in Automatic Bombing mode, or when aiming laser-guided bombs (LGBs).

When  dive bombing, the CCIP marker will be easily visible in the HUD field
of  view.   If you fly a horizontal attack at low level, you`ll have to fly
fast  to keep the CCIP marker in the HUD field of view.  In practice, AV-8B
pilots  normally  keep the speed to 450kts or more when making CCIP attacks
from low level.

Automatic Bombing Mode

To  toggle  between  CCIP  mode and the alternative Automatic Bombing mode,
press the ` (single quote) key.

Once  the  target  is visible in the HUD, place the LFD aiming mark over it
and  press  ENTER  or  the  second  mouse  or joystick key.  This locks the
nose-mounted  ARBS  video  camera  onto  the  selected  spot on the ground,
designates  this  as  waypoint 0, and selects waypoint zero.  Remember that
the  ARBS isn't locked on to the target, but is tracking a designated point
on  the  ground.   If  that  point  wasn't  lined  up  with the target, the
automatic system has no way of compensating for this.

The aiming point will be marked by a cross on the ARBS video display, and a
cross  in  the  HUD.   Position  the CCIP line over the target, and hold it
there.   Press  and  hold down the fire button to indicate to the automatic
bombing  system  that it is free to release ordnance.  If you keep the CCIP
line  on  the  target,  and the fire button pressed down, the bombs will be
released  automatically.   If  no bombs are released, the CCIP line was not
aligned  accurately  with  the  target  -  the Automatic bombing mode won't
release  weapons  which  have  no  chance  of hitting the designated aiming
point.

Unguided Rockets

Rockets  are  launched  in CCIP mode.  In this case the HUD does not show a
CCIP line - only a "T" shaped CCIP aiming mark.

AGM-65E Maverick

Maverick  is designed to home onto targets which have been laser designated
by  friendly  forces.   If  Maverick  is  selected,  andd a target is being
designated  by ground forces, a square marker will appear in the HUD as you
approach  the  target  area.   Maverick  can  then  be  fired and will home
automatically without further action by the pilot.

Firing  a  Maverick  -  or any other guided weapon - does not automatically
result  in a "kill".  For a start, you may have fired at too great a range.
Also be aware that missile homing systems are not perfect, but should bring
a  missile  within  several  feet of its target.  During trials in the late
1970s,  half  the  Maverick  rounds  fired  landed  within four feet of the
target.   The  others  exhibited  greater  errors, in some cases 10 feet or
more.   All  guided  missiles  exhibit  such variations in accuracy between
individual  rounds,  and in some cases may not land close enough to score a
"kill".   In  AV-8B  Harrier Assault, missile behaviour has been accurately
modelled  to reflect such small errors.  If firing a guided missile doesn`t
result  in a kill, the simulation is not at fault.  Make a second pass, and
fire another weapon at the target.

Laser Guided Bombs (LGBs)

Like Maverick.  LGBs are laser-homing weapons which require their target to
be  designated.   Operating  procedure is similar to that for Maverick, but
these unpowered weapons have less range and maneuvering capability than the
AGM-65.   LGBs  must  be  dropped close enough to the target to allow their
limited maneuvering power to successfully guide the weapon to a "kill".  It
is essential that the CCIP line be positioned inside the square marker when
the bomb is released.

AIM-9 Sidewinder

Selecting AIM-9 will automatically activate the IR seeker of the Sidewinder
missile.   This  will  scan  an  area  ahead  of the aircraft looking for a
suitable  target.   Any  target aircraft visible through the HUD will be in
the sidewinder's field of view, and the missile will lock on automatically.
If  several  aircrafi are visible within the HUD, Sidewinder will lock onto
the nearest.

You will receive two indications of successful lock-on.  A circular mark in
the  HUD  will  track  the  target,  and  you  will  hear a "growling" tone
generated  by  the missile seeker head.  The missile can then be fired, and
will  home  automatically.  If the seeker has not locked onto a target, the
missile can still be launched, but it will not home.

AIM-9M  will  not  home onto Indonesian C-130 Hercules transports.  Use the
cannon to attack these.

AGM-88 HARM

If  you wish to attack a radar guided SAM site, turn your aircraft onto the
threat  bearing indicated by the radar warning receiver.  Once the radar is
within  the  HUD  field  of view, a square aiming mark will become visible.
This will track the target, indicating that the missile has locked on.

Firing  at  too great a range can fail to generate a "kill", either because
the  missile  did not have enough range to reach the target, or because the
radar  has  been switched off (The latter tactic is a good counter to HARM,
since  it  deprives  the  missile  of  its  ability  to make furthur course
corrections).   Launching  the  missile  at  closer  range  will reduce the
enemy's  chances  of switching off in time, but if misjudged could give him
the chance to fire a SAM at your aircraft.

POST-FLIGHT DEBRIEFING

On  landing  from  a  successful  mission, waiting a short time or pressing
Ctrl-D  will  bring  you  back  to  the  Pilots Briefing Room.  De-Briefing
information  will  be  displayed  on the whiteboard.  Once you`ve read this
clicking  on  the  right  or  left  monitors will bring up a listing of the
missions waiting to be flown, or those currently under way.

ALTERNATIVE LANDING SITES

Under  normal circumstances, you will always land back on Tarawa.  Although
some  of  the  other  assault ships are carrying spare AV-8Bs and can ferry
them  over  to Tarawa to replace aircraft lost in combat, the aircraft were
loaded  onto  these  ships by crane.  You cannot land on vessels other than
Tarawa.

If  you  run  short of fuel when flying over East Timor you may land at any
airfield  which  has  been  captured  by  the  Marines.   They  will almost
certainly  find  enough  Indonesian fuel to refill your tanks, and may even
have some 25mm ammunition available to reload your cannon.

SECTION V - SHIPS AND MEN OF THE TASK FORCE.
--------------------------------------------

Tarawa: Lead Vessel of the Assault Force
 
The  most  important  vessel in the fleet under your command is the assault
ship LHA 1 Tarawa.  Built in the early 1970s, this was the first of a class
of  five  vessels intended to combine the functions of the earlier Iwo Jima
class  helicopter carrier (LH), with those of a dock landing ship (LPD) and
an assault cargo ship (LKA).

Tarawa  was  built  by Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation.  She was laid down
15th  November  1971, launched on 1st December 1973, and commissioned on 29
May  1976.  She was followed by five sister ships the Saipan, Belleau Wood,
Nassau,  and  Peleliu.  A total of nine had been planned when the class was
trimmed to only six in 1971 even before Tarawa had been laid down.  All six
ships was built by Ingalls, with the last example entering service in 1980.

Tarawa and her sister ships are the world's largest amphibious vessels.  To
the  layman,  Tarawa  looks like an aircraft carrier.  Similar in size to a
Second  World  War  Essex-class aircraft carrier the ship is 834 feet long,
132ft  wide,  and  has a full load displacement of 39,967 tons.  Impressive
though  these  figures  are,  Tarawa  is  some  200ft shorter than a modern
aircraft  carrier,  has  about  half the displacement, and lacks the angled
flight  deck,  aircraft  catapults,  and  arrester  gear  needed to operate
conventional jet fighters.

Tarawa  is designed not to provide the large-scale air power available from
an  aircraft  carrier, but to embark a Marine amphibious unit, transport it
over  long  distances, deploy it ashore, then loiter in the area to support
it.  This ability to land forces on a distant shore is one component of the
mobile force structure which makes the United States a superpower.  Nations
such  as China may have strategic nuclear weapons, but lack this ability to
intervene   at  trouble  spots  around  the  globe.   The  Commonwealth  of
Independent  States  which  resulted  from the break-up of the Soviet Union
would have difficulty in carrying out this sort of force projection.

Tarawa  has  enough  accommodation  space  below  decks  for  a  reinforced
battalion  -  total  of  around 2,000 men, plus the hardware needed to give
them fire power once ashore - five M60 tanks and six 105mm field howitzers.
Although  powerfully  armed,  it's  a  numerically  small force, one better
suited to a swift "surgical" strike rather than long slogging match against
enemy  forces  operating  at brigade strength (around 5,000 - 8,000 men) or
divisional level (around 15,000 - 20,000 men.)

On  land,  armies  can  request  supplies,  firepower, or even diversionary
attacks  from  other  units  along  the  same front line.  There is no such
tactical  luxury  for Marine units sent onto a hostile shore.  Every bullet
and  band  aid they need, they must take with them.  Trained to fight under
such  self sufficient conditions, the Marines regard themselves as an elite
unit,  perhaps  the  elite unit.  A US Marine may pudgingly accept that the
British SAS, the Russian Spetsnaz, the Israeli paratroopers, and the French
Foreign  Legion  are  tough,  but  this  won't dent his conviction that the
Marines are the toughest soldiers who walk this planet.

Tarawas 820ft X 118ft night deck can handle twelve CH-46 Sea Knight assault
helicopters, or nine of the heavier CH-53 Sea Stallion.  Directly below the
flight  deck  are  two  half-length hanger decks.  These can house up to 26
CH-46 or 19 CH-53.  These aircraft can be moved to and from the flight deck
via  one elevator mid-way down the port side of the ship, and a second near
the  stern.   AV-8B  Harriers  are  carried  as required for the individual
mission.

For Operation Ocean Saber, Tarawa carries eight AV-8B, plus 28 helicopters.
A  separate  vehicle deck carries the wheeled and tracked vechicles for the
vessel's force of Marines.  The vessel is operated by a crew of around 900,
bringing the total to around 2,900.

In  the  lower part of the aft section of the vessel is a feature unique to
amphibious  assault  ships  - a large docking well.  This can be flooded to
allow landing craft to enter and leave via a stern-mounted door which gives
access  to the sea.  On Tarawa, the well is 286ft long and 78ft wide so can
acommodate  a  wide  range of landing craft.  For this mission, it contains
four  LCU, and two LCM-6.  Forty LVT tracked landing craft are carried on a
separate vehicle deck.

Built  in  large numbers between the mid-1950s until the mid-1970s, the LCU
(Landing  Craft  Utility)  is  the  descendant  of the Second World War LCT
(Landing  Craft  Tank).   Maximum payload of these 135 foot long vessels is
180  tons.  For example, they can carry three tanks.  Later models have bow
and  stern ramps, to enable vehicles to drive through.  LCUs are powered by
four diesel engines, and have a top speed of 20kts.

The  56  foot  long  LCM-6  was  a Second World War design, but remained in
production  until the 1970s.  It can carry 80 soldiers or 34 tons of cargo.
Two diesel engines give a top speed of 20kts.

One  of  the  most  tactically  useful  vehicles  in the early stages of an
assault  is the LVTP-7 Amphibious Assault Vehicle.  (In the game, these are
referred  to  simply  as  LVTs).   As its full designation "Landing Vehicle
Tracked Personnel" suggests, this is a vehicle able to propel itself in the
water,  climb  a  beach  under the power of tracks, then carry its soldiers
inland.

The  LVT  weighs  around  50,000lb, and can carry 25 Marines, who enter and
leave  the  vehicle  via a rear-mounted ramp.  Hatches in the upper surface
allow  cargo  to  be  loaded from above, either when the vechicle is aboard
ship  or floating alongside a ship.  A Cummins VT8 diesel engine drives the
vehicle at speeds of up to 39mph, while in the water, two water jets propel
it at speeds of up to 8.5mph.

It  takes  primitive  terrain  to top an LVT.  The vehicle can cross an 8ft
wide  trench,  climb over a 3ft obstacle, and has a ground pressure of only
8lb/sq in.  The hull is made from aluminum armor between 0.27 - 1.77 inches
thick,  and the vehicle has a turret armed with an M85 0.5" caliber machine
gun.

More  than  33,000  square feet of storage space is available aboard Tarawa
for  vehicles,  plus  almost  117,999  cubic  feet  of space for palletised
stores.   To  support  the  landed force of close to 2,000 Marines requires
several  hundred  tons  of  stores,  so  the  ship  has  built in automated
cargo-handling  facilities  include  conveyors  and  elevators.   These can
handle up to 240 one-ton pallets per hour.

A massive conveyor system runs along the top of a central support structure
which  divides the docking well in two, then forward onto the vehicle deck.
Five  elevators  - two in the well deck area, and three at the front end of
the  conveyor lift the cargo pallets from the cargo holds deep in the ship,
allowing  them  to  move  rear  ward  to  the  well deck, where an overhead
monorail  system  loads  them  onto  the  landing  craft.   The aft pair of
transporters can also be used to move pallets to the hangar deck.  While an
inclined  ramp allows pallets to be moved up to the flight deck for loading
onto helicopters.

To  be  effective,  Tarawa`s  Marines  must  be  able  to  perform  at peak
efficiency  as soon as they go ashore.  To help prepare the Marines to cope
with  the climate they will experience at their destination, a 5,000 square
foot  training  and  acclimatisation room is available.  (In this game, the
acclimatisation  room  also contains the Part Task Trainers which will help
teach  you  how to fly the AV-8B.) Other facilities include a hospital able
to provide intensive care for up to 90 casualties.

Command  facilities are located in the massive island superstructure at the
starboard  side  of  the  night  deck.   From  here  the  commander  of the
amphibious   task  group  and  the  landing  force  commander  issue  their
instructions  via  the Tactical Amphibious Warfare Data System (TAWADS) - a
computer-controlled  system  able to store information on targets, and keep
track  of landing craft, helicopters, vehicles, soldiers, and cargo.  Later
in  this  manual,  you'll learn how to use TAWADS to generate battle plans,
and to control the amphibious assault forces and the AV-8B Harriers.

In an era when most major US warships are driven by gas turbines or nuclear
power,  the  Tarawa  class  relies  on a traditional steam powerplant.  Two
Combustion  Engineering  boilers  provide  the  steam  needed  to drive two
Westinghouse  geared  turbines, each of which powers one of the vessels two
propeller  shafts.   The  turbines  deliver  a  total of 70,000 shaft horse
power:   enough to take Tarawa to a top speed of 24kts.  Maximum range at a
more economical cruising speed of 20kt is 10,000nm.

The Navy has only two Blue Ridge class command ships:  so may not be in the
area  of  an  amphibious operation.  To get around this problem, the Tarawa
class  are equipped with extensive command and control facilities including
an SPS-52B radar for fighter control.

During  an  amphibious  operation,  Tarawa  and  her  sister ships would be
obvious  targets  for  enemy attack.  Three types of weapon are carried for
self-protection.   A  single  Mk45  75mm/54  gun is mounted at the port and
starboard  front corners of the flight deck, a third at the starboard rear.
These  can  fire  20  rounds  per  minute.   Maximum  range  is  8nm in the
anti-aircraft role, 12.4nm against land targets.

When  the  vessels  first  entered service, the port rear corner carried an
eight-barrelled  launcher for the Sea Sparrow surface-to air missile, while
a  second  was  positioned  forward  of the island.  The final self defense
weapons were six single-barrelled Mk67 20mm cannon.

In  the  1980s,  a  retrofit program installed two General Dynamics Mk15/16
Phalanx  20mm  close-in  weapon  systems  (CIWS)  on each ship.  These were
mounted  in the positions formerly used by Sea Sparrow.  The 20mm Mk87 gave
way to six 25mm Mk 242 cannons.

Phalanx  is  intended  to protect the ship against anti-ship missiles which
make  it  part  of  the  surface-to-air  missile  fire  power of the fleets
warships.   This  is a "last-ditch" weapon a radar-controlled automatic gun
mount  whose  six-barrelled  Gatling  gun  pours out 50 20mm caliber cannon
shells per second.  Maximum range is short - if an enemy missile is closing
for the kill, Phalanx will have only a few seconds to score a kill.

The  cannon shells do not carry an explosive payload; damaging a missile at
such  short  range  would probably not stop the crippled round striking the
ship.   The projectiles leaving the Phalanx gun barrels are solid, and made
from  depleted  uranium,  one of the heaviest metals known to man.  If hits
are  obtained  on  the missile, the impact energy of these heavy high speed
projectiles  should  be  enough  either  to cause massive structural damage
which  will  knock the weapon off course, or even to detonate the missile's
warhead.

Tarawa also carries extensive electronic warfare (EW) protection, including
the  SLQ-32(V)3  system.   This is designed to detect and jam hostile radar
signals.  Four six-barrelled SRBOC launchers are available to release chaff
and IR decoys in further attempts to confuse incoming anti-ship missiles.

More Ships and More Men

On  its own Tarawa could not carry a large enough force of Marines to carry
out Operation Ocean Saber.  Supporting her are six other amphibious warfare
vessels, an escort of four warships, and a tanker.

To  provide  additional  amphibious capability the fleet includes five Dock
landing  ships.   Like Tarawa, these slightly smaller vessels carry Marines
and  their  equipment,  and  incorporate  docking  wells designed to handle
landing  craft.   Newest  of the five is LSD-41 Whidbey Island.  First of a
class  of  eight  modern  dock  landing  ships  built  to replace the older
Thomaston  class,  this  was  built in the early 1980s by Lockheed Seattle.
Whidbey  Island  is  609ft long, and has a full load displacement of 15.725
tons.  It carries a force of 500 Marines plus their equipment.  Its 440ft X
50ft well deck houses four LCAC air-cushion landing vehicles.

Gradually  replacing  the  older  LCU,  are  the  LCAC  (Landing  Craft Air
Cushion).   These  can carry only 24 soldiers, a single tank, or between 60
and  75  tons  of  cargo,  but have a top speed of 40kts when fully loaded.
Their great advantage, apart from high speed, is that they can land on most
shorelines.   Conventional  landing craft require careful choice of landing
site.   According  to the US Navy the LCAC can cope with around 70 per cent
of  the shorelines around the world, while the LCU was restricted to around
15   per   cent.   Apart  from  their  smaller  payload,  CVACs  have  some
disadvantages  compared  with LCUs.  They are noisy, create clouds of spray
(which sometimes interfered with the driver's vision before the addition of
spray suppressers), and can have problems in rough seas.

Whidbey  Island  also  has  up  to  5,000 cubic feet of space available for
marine  cargo,  and  12,500  square feet for vehicles.  Four Colt/Pielstick
diesel engines driving two shafts give a total of 41,600shp and a top speed
of 22kts.

The  rest  of the Marine Expeditionary Brigade is deployed on LPD-4 Austin,
LPD-5  Ogden,  LPD-7  Cleveland and LPD-9 Denver.  These are 570 feet long,
with  a  16,900  ton full load displacement.  Part of a class of 12 vessels
built  in  the  l960s,  each can each carry 1,000 Marines and 2,500 tons of
cargo.   The  168ft  X  50ft  well  deck can house one LCU and three LCM-6.
These landing craft can be supplemented by several more carried on deck and
lowered  into the sea by an aft-mounted crane.  Austin lacks the helicopter
hanger  added  to  later  vessels  of  the class.  As a result, only Ogden,
Cleveland,  and  Denver  can  carry  aircraft.   Typical loads might be one
SH-60, two CH-46, or four AH-1W.  Being almost 30 years old, Austin and her
sister  ships  are  steam  powered.   Both  have  twin-shaft  installations
delivering around 24,000shp and giving a top speed of around 20kts.

For  self-protection,  all  five  Dock  Landing  Ships  are fitted with the
SLQ-32(V)1, a simpler version of the EW system carried by Tarawa.  All five
also have four SRBOC chaff/flare launchers, while Whidbey Island also has a
pair of 20mm Phalanx guns.

Cargo and Fuel

To  carry  the  rest of the Marine Expeditionary Brigade`s heavy loads, the
force  includes  the Vehicle Cargo Ship T-AK 3009 Pfc Dewayne T.  Williams.
Built  by General Dynamics, this 44,330 ton vessel joined the fleet in 1985
on  long  term  charter.  The ship is operated by American Overseas Marine,
and  has a crew of 30, plus 25 technicians.  On its own it can carry 22,700
tons  of  equipment  and  supplies,  25  per cent of the stores needed by a
Marine   Expeditionary   Brigade   over   a   30  day  period.   It  has  a
roll-on/roll-off  capacity  of more than 150,000 square feet, and can carry
530 cargo containers.  It also delivers vehicle and aviation fuel.

Unlike the Whidbey Island and the Austin class, Pfc Dewayne T.  Williams is
not  an  amphibious  ship.   It  unloads  its  cargo  either  by using port
facilities,  or  at  sea by means of its built-in cargo-handling equipment.
This  includes  two  twin  cranes  and  one  single crane.  A small landing
platform for helicopters is located at the rear of the superstructure.  The
vessel  is powered by two Stork Werkspoor 16 TM 410 diesel engines, and has
a speed of 18kts.  Maximum range at this speed is 12,840 miles.

The Warship Escort

Keeping this assault force safe from land and sea attack is the task of the
warships assigned to escort the formation.  During the Second World War, an
amphibious  task  force  would have been escorted by heavy cruisers or even
one or more battleships, but these massive gun platforms have been retired.

For  this mission, the use of guided-missile cruisers has been ruled out by
Washington,  so  the largest and most powerful of the vessels escorting the
amphibious  force  is the 563ft long guided missile destroyer DDG 933 Kidd.
Originally  laid  down in June 1978 for the Imperial Iranian Navy and named
Kouroush,  Kidd  and  her  four sister ships were taken over by the US Navy
following  the  Iranian  Revolution.   Kidd  was launched by Litton on 11th
August 1979, and was completed in the summer of 1981.

The  Kidd  class  are  a specialised anti-aircraft version of the US Navy`s
Spruance  class destroyer.  The equipment fit of the Spruances were trimmed
to   save   money  but  the  Shah  of  Iran  had  opted  for  the  original
specification.   As  a  result,  Kidd  and  her  sister  ships are the most
powerful destroyers in the US fleet.  Full load displacement is 9,200 tons,
around 1,400 tons more than a Spruance.  This extra weight is partly due to
the  installation  of  armor  protection, also three additional radars - an
SPS-48  and  two  SPG-51  radars.   The  Kidd  class  is ideal for tropical
service,  since  its  air-conditioning  systems  were designed to cope with
operations in the Gulf.

The  ship  is  armed  with missiles and guns.  Two Mk 45 5inch guns mounted
forward and aft have a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute.  Maximum range
is  12.6nm  against  surface  targets.   Inboard  of the guns are two Mk 26
twin-rail missile launchers able to fire SM-2MR Standard SAMs or ASROC anti
submarine  missiles.   Maximum  range  of this version of Standard is 40nm.
Two  eight-round  launchers  for  Harpoon missiles allow ship targets to be
engaged  at  ranges  of  up  to  70nm.  The hanger carries either two SH-2F
Helicopters,  or  a  single  SH-60.   Two 20mm Phalanx guns are carried for
point defense.

Like Tarawa and the Dock Landing Ships, Kidd is equipped with an electronic
warfare  suite,  plus  four  SRBOC launchers for chaff and flares.  In this
case  EW  system  is  an  SLQ-32(V)2 updated by the Sidekick program to add
jamming  and  deception  modes.  During the late 1980s, Kidd and her sister
ships  were  updated  under  the  US  Navys threat Upgrade (NTU) program to
improve  their  ability  to  deal  with  sopisticated  aircraft and missile
threats.

The  ship  is  powered by four General Electric LM2500 gas turbines.  These
develop  a  total of 80,000shp, and drive two shafts, giving the ship a top
speed of 30kts.  Range at 20kts cruising speed is 6,000nm.

The  other  three  escorts  are smaller and less well-armed vessels - 445ft
long  frigates  of the Oliver Hazard Perry class.  Built in the late 1970s,
FFG-10  Duncan, FFG-11 Clark and FFG-20 Antrim joined the fleet in 1980-81.
Displacing around 3,500 tons at full load, the Perry class were designed as
a  lower  cost alternative to the Spruance class destroyers.  To keep costs
down,  these  vessels  are  armed with only a single Mk13 trainable missile
launcher plus a 3 inch Mk 75 gun.

Two  General  Electric  L2500  gas  turbines  drive a single shaft (another
cost-cutting  compromise),  and deliver a total of 40,000shp.  This gives a
top  speed  of  28.5kts.   Maximum  range at 20kts is 4,500nm.  Normal crew
complement is 206, including 13 officers and 19 aircrew.

The  Mk13  missile  launcher is the vessels, primary armament.  It can fire
Standard  SM01MR  anti-aircraft  missiles,  or  Harpoon anti ship missiles.
This  version of Standard has a range of only 25nm, much less than the 40nm
of  Kidd's  SM-2MR  missiles.   The  vessel  is also fitted with two triple
launchers  for anti-submarine torpedoes, and carries two SH-2F or two SH-60
helicopters.

The  3in gun can fire 85 rounds per minute.  Maximum range is 8.7nm against
surface  targets,  or  6.6nm against air threats.  A single 20mm Phalanx is
mounted  on  the  roof  of  the  aircraft  hanger.   Electronic warfare and
chaff/decoy facilities are similar to those of Kidd.

To  support  the Tarawa, her five supporting ships, and the warship escort,
the  fleet  is  accompanied  by  the  41,350  ton Replenishment Oiler AOR 6
Kalamazoo.   Built  by General Dynamics, and commisioned in 1973, Kalamazoo
is  one of a class of seven ships designed to support naval units operating
at  sea.   It can carry 160,000 barrels of fuel, 600 tons of munitions, 200
tons of dry stores, and 100 tons of refrigerated stores.  Cargo handling is
highly automated.  Powered by General Electric steam turbines, the ship has
a  top speed of 20kts.  Maximum range is 6,500 miles at 19kts, or 10,000 at
16kts.  Normal crew is 454.

A ship with this capability needs to be able to defend itself, so Kalamazoo
carries   a   single  Mk  29  eight  barrelled  launcher  for  Sea  Sparrow
surface-to-air  missiles.   Like  Tarawa,  it is fitted with the SLQ 32(V)3
electronic  warfare  system,  plus  four  six-barrelled SRBOC launchers for
chaff and decoy flares.  Add on armament can include two 20mm phalanx CIWS,
or  four  2Omm  Oerlikon  cannons.   Kalamazoo  has a small flight deck and
hanger.  These were designed to handle two UH 46 helicopters.

The Marine Expeditionary Brigade

The  force  tasked  with  Operation  Ocean  Saber is a Marine Expeditionary
Brigade  (MEB) whose Regimental Landing Team will carry out the landing and
ground  combat.   An  MEB  is  commanded  by a Brigadier General, and built
around  a  reinforced  infantry  regiment  and  a composite Marine aircraft
group.  Self-sustainable for up to 30 days, an MEB is used to provide rapid
response   in  what  are  euphemistically  called  Low  Intensity  Conflict
situations.

In  real  life,  the  Regimental  Landing  Team  is  a complex organisation
incorporating  specialized units such as armour and artillery and supported
by  a  Brigade  Service  Support  Group.  To make the game easy to play, we
assumed  the landing force consists entirely of normal infantry battalions,
and that these incorporate the supporting armour and artillery.  The number
of  infantry  battalions has been increased to compensate for the "missing"
support units.

A  normal  Marine  regiment  consists of three battalions, each with around
1,200  - 1,400 men.  These have a two digit designation.  Our landing force
is  based  on the 9th Marine Regiment, and has three battalions - 1/9, 2/9,
and 3/9, plus two battalions from the 6th Marine Regiment - 1/6 and 2/6.

Each  battalion has three rifle companies.  The first battalion has A, B, &
c  companies, the 2nd E, F & G, the 3rd I, K, & L.  Company designations D,
H,  and  M are never used.  During the last decade, battalions were slimmed
down  from  four  companies  to  three,  eliminating  D,  H  and M, but the
remaining  three  retained  their  traditional  designations.  Each company
consists of a 1st, 2nd and 3rd platoon.

US  military  "shorthand"  for  the  A  company,  1st battalion, 9th Marine
Regiment  is  "A/1/9", but the unit designations you`ll see in the game are
written  in  fuller  form, such as "A coy 1st bn, 9th Marines".  The TAWADS
tactical  map  does not identify individual platoons, so don`t be surprised
to  see  several  units in close proximity all labelled identically.  These
will be individual platoons of the same company.

The  Marines  will go ashore either in conventional landing craft or in the
amphibious  Landing  Vehicle  Tracked  (LTV).   They can also be flown into
battle  aboard  CH-53  Super  Stallion  helicopters.   These  heavy assault
helicopters can carry up to 55 soldiers, or 36,000lb of stores.

Once  ashore,  the  Marines will move inland in their HMMWVs (High Mobility
Multipurpose  Wheeled Vehicles).  Referred to as "Humvees", these jeep-like
vehicles  can  carry  six  men,  or a light weapon such as a 20mm cannon or
recoilless rifle.

One  thing  any  amphibious  assault  force  is  always short of is armored
vehicles.   The  only  main  battle  tanks available to go ashore are 20 M1
Abrams.   These  tanks  weigh around 60 tons, and are armed with a powerful
105mm  gun.   The  accuracy  and  armor-piercing capability of this gun far
surpasses  that  of  the 100mm gun mounted on Indonesian tanks.  The latter
have  no  modern  fire-control system; if the first shot misses the target,
the  crew must try to correct the aim manually.  The computerized system on
the M1 should near-guarantee that if the first shot misses, the second will
score a hit.

The  M1 has a top speed of 45mph on a road surface, can cross 9ft trenches,
and  climb  a  4ft  obstacle.   It  has a crew of four, and is protected by
composite  armor  which is much more effective that the steel used in older
tanks such as Indonesia's T-59s.

To  supplement  this  small  tank  force,  the  Marines  have more than 400
eight-wheeled LAV-25 Light Armored Vehicles.  The standard version is armed
with  a 25mm cannon and a co-axial machine gun, but the air defence variant
has  a  lighter  four-barrelled cannon and four Stinger shoulder-fired anti
aircraft  missiles.   The  LAV has a crew of three, and a top speed of more
than 60mph on a good road surface.

Although  the  AV-8Bs  will  do  their  best to provide air support for the
Marines,  additional  air-strike  capability is available either from AH-1W
Sea Cobra attack helicopters, or from CH-53 rigged with externally- mounted
weapon  launchers,  and cannon or machine gun able to fire through windows.
THe AH-1W Sea Cobra is a custom-built attack helicopter with a two-man crew
-  pilot  and  gunner  -  and  heavy  armor  protection.   A  nose  mounted
night-vision  FLIR  system, allows it to fight by day or night, carrying up
to  eight TOW or Hellfire antitank missiles, plus AIM-9 Sidewinders for air
to air combat.

For  artillery  support, Marine artillery units are equipped with the light
but  hard  hitting M198 155mm howitzer.  This has a maximum range of around
15  miles,  and  can  deliver  shells  twice  the  weight of those fired by
Indoneesias  shorter-ranged  artillery.   The landing force has 18 six- gun
batteries of M198 howitzers.

To  deal  with  enemy tanks, the Marines also have ground-launched TOW anti
tank  missiles,  plus the smaller shoulder-fired Dragon anti- tank missile.
The  Stinger  shoulder  fired heat-seeking SAM is also available to protect
mobile units from attack by Indonesian aircraft.
