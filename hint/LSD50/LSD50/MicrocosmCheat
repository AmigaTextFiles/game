PAUSE the game and press the following buttons on the joypad:


RED GREEN BLUE YELLOW DOWN DOWN BLUE DOWN RIGHT BLUE

or

GREEN BLUE YELLOW RED YELLOW DOWN GREEN RIGHT RED UP



now you have:
              - unlimited energy
              - all weapons activated
              - you can choose ANY level

              - you have lost the color;((((


Tip  2:   when  you  are  walking  into the pod base, try pressing the LEFT
button  and keep it pressed until you arrive at the crossway..  now all the
maps' level are upside-down..



PS: Sorry for the bad English;))))))))))
