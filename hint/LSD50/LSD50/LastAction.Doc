Be the arnold that walks around and tries to beat people up.
On the way to save some people at the final end. The game
is very hard. Need a trainer there. Find the trainer and use
it. Arnold does not look like him either. Ehh.. lok at the game.
The graphics .. : 90 on the 100 scale. Okay graphics but psygnosis 
can do better then that, don't you think? Well, you guys better play 
this game so you guys can find out how bad amiga games can get,
but if you guys like this kind of game.. you do not deserve to be
in the scene.. See ya!
