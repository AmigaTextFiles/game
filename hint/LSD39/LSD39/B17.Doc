B17 FLYING FORTRESS TECHNICAL SUPPLEMENT
========================================

CONTENTS

Your B17 Flying Fortress game should contain a manual, this Technical and
Flight  Supplement  (including  a  pullout Key Guide), a poster, a set of
3.5" disks and a registration card.

REQUIRED EQUIPMENT

Computer This simulation requires a Commodore Amiga with at least 1 Mb of
RAM

Controls  The simulation can be run entirely from the keyboard and mouse.
Most  sections also support joystick control.  Analogue joysticks are not
supported.

Display This simulation requires a colour display

Disk Drives B-17 Flying Fortress can be installed onto 3.5" floppy disks.
However it works best if installed onto a hard disk drive.

Important:   B-17  Flying  Fortress  should  not be played from the disks
enclosed.   You  must  either  copy the original disks onto backup floppy
disks  (see  Making  Backup  Game  Disks),  or use the Install program to
create a subdirectory on your hard disk.  If you attempt to play from the
disks enclosed they may become permanently altered.

AMIGA KEYBOARDS

The  simulation  has  alternative keys for players who own Amigas without
numeric keypads.  The following keys should be used:

Numeric Keypad      Alternative                  Function 
--------------      -----------                  --------
 9                  CTRL/Cursor Key Up           Pitch View Up
 3                  CTRL/Cursor Key Down         Pitch View Down
 0                  CTRL/Cursor Key Left         Rotate View Left
 .                  CTRL/Cursor Key Right        Rotate View Right
 5                  Backspace                    Centre 3D View
 +                  Close Square Brackets ]      Zoom View In
 -                  Open Square Brackets  [      Zoom View Out

COPY PROTECTION

Flying Fortress has no disk copy protection.  This means that you install
the  simulation  files  from the original disks to a hard disk.  However,
the  program  asks  you a simulation related question.  Use the manual to
answer  the  question.   Microprose  regrets  that  continuing casual and
organized  software  piracy  requires that we retain this minimal form of
copy protection.

INSTALLATION

Installation Concepts

B-17 Flying Fortress is not copy protected.  This means that you can copy
the  game  files  from  the original disks to other floppy disks, or to a
hard drive.  However always keep the original disks handy.

B-17  Flying  Fortress has been left unprotected for your conveinience in
making  backup  copies  and when playing from hard drive.  However making
additional  copies  to  give  away or sell is a Copyright Violation.  See
copyright Notice in the game manual.

Making Backup Game Disks

To  create  the  backup  game  disks for B-17 Flying Fortress load up the
Workbench  Disk  and insert the first disk you wish to copy.  A disk icon
and  the  name  of the disk will appear.  Click once on the disk icon and
the  name  of the disk will appear.  Hold down the right mouse button and
you  will  see  three  menus.   Choose  the Workbench Menu and select the
duplicate  option.   Follow  all  on screen prompts aand the disk will be
duplicated on you blank disk.

When  a  disk  has finished copying you will need to rename it so that it
has  the  same  name  as the original disk from which it was copied To do
this insert your copied disk, click on its icon once with the left button
and  hold  down  the  right  button.   Select  the  rename  icon from the
Workbench  menu.   Finally delete the Copy of prefix in front of the disk
name and press the return key.

Rpeat  the  above procedure for each of the original B-17 Flying Fortress
game disks.

Installing On Hard Disk

Boot  up your hard disk as normal and insert B-17 Flying Fortress Disk A.
Open  this  disk  and  double  click  on the INSTALL_HD_B17 icon.  Please
follow any on screen prompts.  A drawer will be created on your hard disk
containg all necessary files.

RUNNING B-17 FLYING FORTRESS ----------------------------

FROM FLOPPY DISKS

If  yourcomputer  has  kickstart  in ROM turn off you computer and insert
your backup Disk A.  Power up the computer and the program will autoload.

If  your computer does not have Kickstart in ROM load kickstart as normal
insert  your  backup  Disk A at the Workbench prompt and the program will
autoload.

Follow any on screen prompts requesting disk changes.

FROM HARD DISK

Boot  up  your  hard disk as normal.  open the drawer and double click on
the game icon.

SAVED GAMES

Individual  Bomber  Campaigns may be saved to disk but only when missions
have  finished.   Campaigns  may  be  saved  onto  hard  drive  or onto a
previously formatted floppy disk.  It is recommended that you do not save
campaigns  onto  your  game  disks or backup game disks.  Saved files are
normal  Amiga DOS files that can be moved and copied using standard Amiga
DOS comands.

LOADING A SAVED GAME

To  load  a  saved game, choose the Load Save button on the Roster Screen
then follow the on screen prompts.

SIMULATION      ENHANCEMENTS      AND     LAST     MINUTE     INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------

THE COMPARTMENT SCREENS

The  original  PC  version  of  Flying Fortress contained six compartment
screens each showing the position of the crew for that part of the plane.
You  will find many references in the manual to the different compartment
screens  (particularly pages 50-51).  For ease of use and to speed up the
gameplay, the Amiga version has all six compartment screen details on one
top  down  view.   This  is  still  accessed  by  Key C and the icons and
portraits  still  appear.   However you will not be able to click on a 2D
picture  of  the  individual  crew  member  but  will  have to select the
portraits.

This screen will also show damage.

QUICK START

A  quick  start  option  is  available  in  the  Difficulty  Menu  of the
Configuration Screen.  Select this option to bypass the taxi-out sequence
and eliminate navigation errors (see Navigation below)

You  will  begin  the  game as the last of a flight of three B-17s queued
ready  for take off, near the start of the runway.  You will be in manual
control  of  the pilot with your engines running and throttles set in the
idle  position.  Increase power to the engines to begin taxiing forwards,
then  follow  the  other  B-17s  in  your  flight out onto the runway for
take-off.

MANUAL/COMPUTER CONTROL

The  simulation  will show a hand icon in a corner of the screen when you
are  in  Manual control of any B-17 position.  If you choose to revert to
Computer  control  (Key  M)  a  Computer  icon  will  appear  in the same
position.

NAVIGATION

Your  Navigator will always make minor errors in estimating your position
depending  on  his  particular  skill level.  Your B-17 flight (3 planes)
will  drift  off  course unless you manage to correct his estimates.  The
more you correct him successfully the better will become his skill level.

BOMBING

If  you  do  not  wish to aim and drop bombs manually, or if there are no
uninjured crew members qualified to operate the Norden Bombsight you can,
provided  you are in formation, position a crew member at the bombardiers
station  and  have  the computer controlled crew member release the bombs
when he sees the raid leaders signal.

If  you  do  wish  to  bomb manually you should position a qualified crew
member at the bombardiers station and, using the Radio Operator, send the
Bomb  on my command Radio message to take control of the bomb run so that
the computer controlled crew will wait for your commands.

GUNNERY

The  Turrets Menu on the Configuration Screen allows you to set the speed
at  which the turrets and hand held guns will traverse in response to the
keyboard  and  joystick  controls.   In addition fine tracking may now be
enabled  by  holding  down  either the Shift or CTRL keys while operating
other  controls.   The  CTRL  key  is  recommended  as it may give better
results with some keyboards.

LANDING

The  landing  procedure differs depending on whether you are in formation
or not when you reach Alconbury (Home Base)

In Formation

The  formation  will  circle Alconbury descending to an altitude of about
2000 ft.  At this point the Alconbury control tower will radio Permission
to Land.  When this happens the computer controlled pilot will break away
from  the  formation  to  begin  his  landing  approach and will land the
aircraft  unless  you take manual control (by selecting the Pilot and Key
M).   If  you  wish  to  land  immediately,  before landing permission is
granted, you must send a radio message requesting permission to land then
wait for the reply from the Tower to start the landing sequence.

Out of Formation

The  Control  Tower  will  ask  whether you want permission to land.  You
should  reply  with a radio message requesting permission then proceed as
above.

BREAKING FORMATION

If  you wish to breakaway from your 3 plane formation at any point in the
mission, you must send a message to the rest of the flight via your Radio
Operator.

FIGHTING ENGINE FIRES

B-17 now has a more detailed engine fire-fighting procedure.

If your enginefires are not extinguished within 1 minute the engines will
suffer  damage  and stop functioning.  If the fire persists (depending on
the  B-17  reliability  level  you  have  chosen)  your B-17 is liable to
explode between 2 and 12 minutes after the fire has started.

If  your  fire  extinguishers  are  ineffective or have been used up in a
previous  fire, you can try to extinguish the fire by diving your B-17 at
a  speed  in  excess  of  350mph.   Avoid speeds over 400mph as this will
result in structural damage.

CREW NAMES

Crew  members  names  may  be changed by selecting the Name button on the
Crew File Screen when this is accessed from the Crew Photo Screen between
missions.

MUSIC

Music may be switched on/off by pressing Keys ALT/S.

THE PILOTS CONTROL COLUMN ICON

The  Pilots  Control  Column  Icon  is  the lower of the two icons in the
Compartment  Screen  and  not the top icon, as stated in the manual (page
28).   The  top  Control  Column  Icon  will light up when you select the
Co-Pilot.   You  will  begin  every mission in the Pilots seat (left-hand
looking out of the cockpit window).

THE MISSION BRIEFING MAP

The Yellow LIne shows the waypoints to the initial point.

The Red Line shows the initial point to the Primary Target, and the Black
Line to the Secondary Target.

The White Line shows the Waypoints to home base.

VIEWING CREW POSITIONS KEYS F1-F10

There  is  no  need to assign the ten crew positions when you first enter
the  B-17 as stated in the Flying Fortress Manual.  All crew are in their
correct  position  and can be viewed immediately by pressing the function
keys F1 to F10.

SKIP TIME Alt/T

By pressing ALT/T you will jump to the next waypoint, or to a point where
something is happening (eg an attack by enemy fighters)

NAVIGATORS VIEWS

If  you access the Navigators external view Key E (Flying Fortress Manual
page 80) you may return to Map View by pressing Key I

READ ME FILE

The  latest  notes regarding this program, additions, revisons etc can be
found  on  disk  A in an ASCII file named READ.ME.  You can read the file
using  standard  Amiga DOS commands eg.  Type, More.  These utilities can
be found on the Workbench disk.

OPERATING         DIFFICULTIES         AND        LOADING        PROBLEMS
-------------------------------------------

In  the vast majority of cases a loading problem is not because of faulty
software, but either incorrect loading procedure or hardware fault.

Please ensure that the loading instructions have been correctly executed.
The most common hardware failures are due to misalignment of the heads in
the  disk  drive.   Such  faults  may  be detected by loading the game on
another computer.

Alternatively  a virus may have infected your hardware from another piece
of  software.  Pirated copies of games are an incredible common source of
virus problems.  It always pays to own original software.  Inthe unlikely
event  of  a software fault please return the complete package, with your
receipt to the place of purchase.  Microprose regret that goods cannot be
replaced unless bought from the company directly.

If  you  have  any  difficulty while loading B-17 Flying Fortress or need
help  while  running  the simulation , Microprose will be happy to assist
you  on  the Helpline.  Please ring UK 0666 504399, Monday to Friday 0900
to 1700 hours.  Have a pen and paper handy when you call.

THE TAKE OFF

You  will  begin  every  mission in the pilots seat under player control.
Your  Flying  Fortress  will  be  at  its starting point on the airfield.
Ahead of you the two other B-17s in your V will be preparing to take off.

You must take off and join the other two planes.

On your first mission, you may find it easier to watch while the computer
takes  control.   To activate computer control, press the M key.  Repress
the  M  key again to regain control.  If you set the plane under computer
control,  you  can  jump  around any of the views or screens to watch the
take off.

The following pages describe how to take off manually.

STARTING ENGINES

Start all four engines in the sequence CTRL/ 1,2,3,4
Increase the Engine Throttle Controls 1,2,3,4
Release the Brake B

The B-17 will now begin to move

Check  that you can easily flip from Pilots Instrument Panel, I to Window
View, W to see flight information.

TAXIING AND STEERING

Select  an  appropriate  External  View,  E then PgUp, PgDn, Ins, Del and
steer  the B-17 by using your Controller.  Gentle left/right will produce
a slow turn in the chosen direction.

Stay on the correct path.  Do not stray onto the grass.

Steer  the  bomber  carefully to the edge of the take off runway.  Try to
line up the B-17 along the white dotted line.

FLAPS

Check the flaps are down, F

TAKING OFF

Return  to  the Pilots View, W.  Apply maximum power to all four engines,
SHIFT  +.  Do not try to pull the plane into the air.  Normally, when you
reach  an airspeed of 110-115 mph a gentle pulling back on the Controller
will  allow  the  plane to lift itself off the ground.  The B-17 controls
may  feel sluggish compared to other flight simulators, but remember that
this is a big, heavy airplane.

After  the  airplane  has  left the ground and you are sure that you have
sufficient  flying speed, raise the Landing Gear, G.  Check that this has
happened with any appropriate outside view, then change flaps to up, F.

After  reaching an airspeed of 130-150 mph, adopt a normal climb attitude
with the rate of climb indicator pointer at 200 feet per minute and watch
the Altimeter rise gently.

CLIMBING AND CRUISING

Make your climb at 130-150 mph.  Steady smooth flying is important.  this
will cut fuel consumption, increase rate of climb and reduce engine wear.
Always check your instruments.  they are there to tell you how your plane
is performing.

You  will  find the first two planes with which you must join up circling
the irfield at about 1000 feet.

Form a group of 3 in a V formation.

IF  YOU  EXPERIENCE  DIFFICULTY  IN  FINDING  THE  OTHER PLANES SWITCH TO
COMPUTER CONTROL OR USE ALT/T SKIP TIME.

Once  you have joined the other planes of your squadron in formation, the
flight will strike out towards the first Waypoint.


LANDINGS

When  you  are  near the English base, you will receive a signal over the
intercom system giving you a heading to land on.  The other planes in the
formation,  and  yours  if under computer control will begin to move into
their  final  traffic  pattern  (  a flight path in which they circle the
airfield in a rectangular pattern at approximately 1000 feet).

The  landing  procedure differs depending on whether you are in formation
or not when you reach Alconbury (home base)

In  formation  the  formation  will  circle  Alconbury  descending  to an
altitude  of  about  2000 ft.  At this point, the Alconbury control tower
will   radio  Permission  to  Land.   When  this  happens,  the  computer
controlled  pilot will break away from the formation to begin his landing
approach  and  will land the aircraft unless you take manual control ( by
selecting  the Pilot and Key M).  If you wish to land immediately, before
landing  permission  is granted, you must send a radio message requesting
permission  to  land  then wait for the reply from the tower to start the
landing sequence.

Out  of  formation The Control Tower will ask whether you want permission
to  land.   You  should reply with a radio message requesting permission,
then perform a normal landing:  Lower your flaps, F and drop your Landing
Gear, G.  Keep the engines rpms to 2000 at about 130 mph.

FINAL APPROACH

The  approach  is  basically  a controlled glide, with flaps down, and in
whick power is used to maintain accurate landing position.

Reduce  power gradually, - until the desired airspeed (about 100-120 mph)
and  rate  of descent have been established.  Touch down gently trying to
land  all  wheels  on  the  runway  at  the  same  time.  Drop to minimum
throttle.

LANDING ROLL

When  you have landed make sure you use the entire runway for the landing
roll.   Do  not apply the brakes too early.  Apply the brakes, B when you
feel  the  plane  slowing  down from its roll.  The B-17 should then slow
down and stop.
