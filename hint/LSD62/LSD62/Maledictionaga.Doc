    At this day, it is the only *GAME* (Not Demo!) on amiga 1200 who feature
  3D mapping. It's the only game available on this machine. It can runs on
  all Amiga AGA with 2 Mo Chip minimun. But FAST memory is recommanded to
  speed up the game but it works without. The technic of mapping is the
  block-mapping, a technic I created. It isn't as beautiful than the normal
  traditionnal mapping but it is the fastest way on amiga. Some options in
  Config menu can speed up the game, I recommand to try all options to
  determinate the best options for your machine.
   If MALEDICTION doesn't run on your machine,you would try to active the
  options NO BACKGROUND or/and SMALL WINDOW or/and NO MUSIC!

     This game was created in 1 year with Blitz basic 2.0 and inbuilt as-
  sembler. Distribute the demo version to all yours friends because it's the
  free demo version but don't sell it.Don't copy the full version. Piracy is
  a crime who incite developpers to give up the Amiga ! Thanks. Amiga is the
  Only One.
