Just a qick note...
		    If you are thinking why I have been including a few
Wordworths 3 Diagrams into the last few issues without any docs to go with
them. If you want the full docs for Wordworths 3, you can find them on
LSD Docs Disk 58, However, I will be displaying the last of the 
Wordworths 3 Diagrams in LSD Docs Disk 63 & I will also display the 
Wordworths 3 Full Manual again for incase you haven`t got them...
