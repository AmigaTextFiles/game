Team 17, one of the biggest and best game companys of today is (maybe)
soon to say goodbye to us dear amiga freaks. Why? because it doesn't pay
back doing games to our amiga today. Alien breed 3d will be their last
breath for the amiga. IF NOT! we the proud amiga user during the years will
wake up. So maybe it's time for us to buy a game? we think so, everyone
connected to the illegal scene today is always complaining of the loss of
MAJOR releases. we do have our last chance to fix this now. When alien
breed 3d is released we should buy it. If we don't care this time team 17
will *FOR SURE* quit doing games for the amiga. And as we all know Team 17
have done almost ALL great games during the last 2 years. like: super frog,
project-x, alien breed games, arcade pool, all terrain racing, body blows,
full contact, and alot of other awesome games for us. we the 3 who have
signed this text are maybe not the ones who are so intrested in playing
games. (we prefer demos) but we do know that there are alot of modem
traders out there who is interested in games. it's now your decision to take
a stand. do you want your modem related scene alive? then you will almost
get forced to buy some game once a while. why not download 7-8 games then
buy one? i guess we have said what we wanted. maybe we should let the modem
scene die. so the swedish scene wakes up and figures out that demos is the
coolest way!! :) hope all of you out there got the point.....

[Ed.]	I know this isn`t much to about any particular game, but I 
thought that this guy has a valid point...  so I included this text file.
