* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/INTRODUCTION

Introduction

   `term' is a telecommuncations program designed for use with any
Commodore-Amiga computer running Kickstart 2.04 or higher. Its features
include

   · Fast built-in VT-220 terminal emulation

   · Support for custom terminal emulation modules following the `XEM
     2.0' standard

   · Operates in any display environment, supports all screen display
     modes

   · Support for file transfer modules following the `XPR' standard

   · File- and printer-capturing functions

   · Review-buffer support

   · Powerful phonebook and dialing functions

   · `Amiga User Interface Style Guide' conformant user interface

   · Online-help (requires AmigaGuide package)

   · Built-in `ARexx' interface

   · File upload list, which permits selecting the files to be
     transferred before the upload is started.

   · Login script learn mode.

   · Built-in keyword/response parser which makes it possible to have
     `term' respond to BBS prompts and such with the user name,
     password, etc. without having to program the ARexx interface.

   · Interface for external programs to rendezvous with `term', taking
     over serial I/O processing (such as HydraCom).

   Although this program is freely-distributable, it is not entirely
free.  If you like it and use frequently, you are requested to send the
author a donation which you suppose will do as a payment for the
program.  See the chapter registration (see REGISTRATION) for details.

   Admittedly, `term' is a fairly large program which consumes quite an
amount of memory when running. You need to have at least 2 MBytes of
system memory installed if you wish to run the program. Please note
that this is the bare minimum configuration. It is recommended that you
run `term' on a faster machine, i.e. plain MC68000-driven Amigas will
have trouble running the program.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/REGISTRATION

Registration

   `term' is made available under the concept of Gift-Ware, which is a
variant of Share-Ware. Share-Ware software authors often release
`crippled' versions of their products, i.e. these programs do not
support the same functionality as the registered versions you get when
sending monetary contributions to the authors. It all comes down to
`pay for the software you are using' in Share-Ware terms. With
Gift-Ware registration is different, you are not required to contribute
money, but a gift will do. With `term' you always get a fully
functional program, there is no `crippled' test release which you can
try for a limited time and then have to pay for in order to receive the
working registered version.

   It may seem as if `term' was free, but this is not the case.
Although there is no need to pay the author in order to get a fully
functional version of the program you should consider making a
contribution. You don't need to feel guilty if you cannot or do not
want to give me something in return for the work I have put into
`term'. Show me that it was worth spending so much time listening to
users, updating, rewriting and enhancing this program. Your
contributions will provide the motivation for me to keep developing the
program.

   One of the preferred methods of `payment' would be to order the
`Olsen Opals' CD-ROM. This CD contains almost every program I have
written for the Amiga in the last seven years. The CD can be bought for
US$ 35 directly from me or from your local software distributor.

   If you don't have any CD-ROM drive or just don't want to buy the CD,
here is a list of suggested contributions:

   · An old Cinemaware game (`Rocket Ranger', `Sinbad and the Throne
     of the Falcon', `SDI', `It came from the Desert II')

   · An old game by Activision (`Portal', `Tass Times in Tonetown')

   · An old Electronic Arts program (`Seven Cities of Gold', `Marble
     Madness', `Deluxe Paint', `Deluxe Print', `Deluxe Music
     Construction Set', `Deluxe Video')

   · An old Epyx game (`Rogue')

   · An old Rainbird or Firebird game (`Starglider', `Jewels of
     Darkness', `Black Lamp')

   · Infocom games and Infocom hintbooks. Although I already own
     almost all games published in `The Lost Treasures of Infocom vol
     I+II' I still collect the originals (not those super-cheap Virgin
     Software re-releases). With the exception of `A Mind forever
     voyaging', `Arthur', `Hollywood Hijinx', `Infidel', `Leather
     Goddesses of Phobos', `Nord and Bert couldn't make head or tail of
     it', `Plundered Hearts', `Shogun', `Spellbreaker', `Suspect', `The
     Lurking Horror', `Trinity', `Wishbringer', `Zork I', `Zork Zero'
     (which I already own) I welcome any game in any format - it does
     not necessarily have to be an Amiga game, Apple II, Kaypro,
     Atari-XL, C64, etc. will be fine, too.

   · An old Telarium/Trillium game for the C64 on 5.25" floppy disk
     (such as `The Amazon', `Rendezvous with Rama', `Fahrenheit 451').

   · An old Lucasfilm game for the C64 on 5.25" floppy disk (such as
     `Rescue on Fractalus', `Ballblazer'). Please send only the PAL
     versions as the original American program versions were tuned for
     NTSC machines.

   · Scenery disks for the SubLogic Flight-Simulator II - except for
     `Western European Tour', `Hawaiian Scenery Adventure', `Japan',
     `USA #7', `USA #9', `USA #11' and `USA #14'.

   · The films `City Slickers', `Jabberwocky', `Brazil', `The Fisher
     King', `Time Bandits', `Annie Hall', `Zelig' or `Alien' on a
     PAL-VHS video cassette

   · A CD by the Beatles (except for `Help', `Rubber Soul',
     `Revolver', `Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band', `The white
     album', `Magical Mystery Tour', `Abbey Road', `Let it be' and
     `Past Masters, Volume II'), Little Feat (-1989), Weather Report,
     Paul Simon (1971-1985), Eric Clapton (-1985), Peter Gabriel
     (1977-1989), Van Morrison or Daniel Lanois

   · A book by Michael Crichton, Bruce Chatwin, Raymond Chandler,
     Terry Pratchett or Steven Meretzky

   · Cash and checks (no credit cards - sorry) are always welcome.

   Send your contribution to the following address:

                             Olaf Barthel

                           Brabeckstrasse 35

                           D-30559 Hannover

                      Federal Republic of Germany

   If you wish to be notified when program updates become available or
wish to order the next update as it becomes available you must include
enough money to cover my expenses, see the chapter entitled orders (see
ORDERS) for more information.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/COMMERCIAL_DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distribution

   I don't mind if you make a copy of `term' for a customer who is
looking for a decent terminal program. But if you decide to distribute
the program on a larger scale, such as by including a copy with each
modem you sell, I want to know about it. The reason is this: by
distributing `term' you take a certain responsability; if your customer
has difficulties in installing and configuring the program she/he will
most likely ask you for assistance. I want to make sure that if a
`term' user is in bad need of help there is somebody who will be able
to provide it. If you wish to become a `term' distributor and want your
name displayed in the `About' window, contact me for details.

   As a general rule, no profit must be made by distributing `term',
i.e. you may charge fees for copying, disks and for providing a printed
manual but no money must be charged for the software itself. I consider
taking legal actions against anyone who violates this rule. Payments
for using the program should be made to the author, not to the provider.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/ORDERS

Orders

   You can order a copy via standard mail by sending a self-addressed
envelope, including postage and disks (more on this below) to the
following address:

                             Olaf Barthel

                           Brabeckstrasse 35

                           D-30559 Hannover

                      Federal Republic of Germany

   Either include three 3.5" double-density disks or two 3.5"
high-density disks. The postage must cover the mailing costs, this
should be the equivalent to DM 8,- in your preferred currency for
Europe, and DM 16,- for all other countries. All orders are shipped via
air mail. If you cannot provide the disks and the envelope, add DM 1,50
per double-density disk or DM 3,- per high-density disk and DM 2,- for
a padded envelope. If you send a check to cover my expenses, please
make sure that the fee I have to pay for cashing it (which currently is
DM 3,-) does not `eat up' the mailing costs.

   As of this writing I do not distribute printed copies of the
documentation.

   Orders must be made by mail only, not by phone or eMail.

   Whenever a new release of `term' becomes available I will try to
make it known in the telecommunications networks.

   The most current `term' release will be available through ftp from
all Aminet sites, such as ftp.wustl.edu [128.252.135.4].  Look into the
pub/aminet/comm/term directory.

   `term' is available for download in a number of BBSes. Careful
please! For reasons I have always failed to understand certain
individuals take pride in patching program version numbers, copying
archives to disk and compressing them into .DMS files, attach silly
notes to archives or extract single files from archives, just to
recompress and release them later. Hands off these files! `term' is
always distributed only in complete LhA-archives, never as a single
program or as a .DMS-file.  In addition to this file lists and
signatures generated using the PGP program provide authenticity. If any
of these signs are missing chances are that you have found a corrupted
copy which most likely was not released by me. My public key can be
found in the chapter PGP key (see PGP_KEY).

   I will not distribute `term' via eMail, the program is too large to
be mailed and since I am paying both for incoming and outgoing mail it
would also be too expensive for me.

   Unless requested, no update notifications will be sent via standard
mail. I recommend that you include an international reply coupon for
each update notification you wish to receive.

   The author reserves the right to discontinue development of the
`term' program.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/LETTERS_TO_THE_AUTHOR

Letters to the author

   It is always nice to receive feedback from users, to hear about
critical comments and enhancement request. If you wish to communicate
with me I suggest that you try electronic mail channels first. As of
this writing there only exists a single Internet address
(olsen@ourcery.han.de) you can send mail to. I have no Fidonet
accounts or such, in fact I don't even visit any BBSes regularly. If
you need to put a mail through to me and don't have direct Internet
access it is recommended that you use the gateway facilities most nets
offer, your local sysop or postmaster will be able to tell you more. Do
not send mail larger than about 64K bytes, as it may get caught on the
way to me and if it in facts arrives in my mail folder it will have cost
me routing fees since I pay both for my incoming and my outgoing mail.
Please don't expect me to make long-distance calls to your local BBS,
German phone rates are rather steep and I am not that wealthy after all.

   If you happen to be registered in a BBS which has no links to any
net or if you don't have any email access at all the only alternative
to dropping by and paying me a visit in person is to use the standard
mail facilities: send a letter, mail a package.  Although such mail
will usually arrive safely and unharmed there still is a problem: I am
slow at responding to `real-world mail'.  If a letter can be answered
with a few lines of text chances are good for a snappy answer, but if
the topic is a little more complex your letter may go into my mail
service stack. To give you an impression how this stack looks like:
it's a large pile of unanswered mail sitting on my desk which keeps
falling over each time I open the window. Such mail will usually get
answered at the end of the semester or when my bad conscience tells me
to.

   Be sure to mention it if you want me to send you an update to `term'
or the most recent version of the program and include some money to
cover my expenses. If you want me to help you or to give advice please
keep in mind that even though there is no denying the fact that I have
written `term' I am by no means an expert in telecommuncations matters.
So if you need to know which modem brand to choose or which Bulgarian
BBSes are worth trying I strongly suggest that you ask someone else.

   In any case, feel free to make comments and to ask questions.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/KNOWN_BUGS_&_PROBLEMS

Known bugs & problems

   During beta testing certain software did not work very well with
`term' (nothing serious I would say, but you may have a different
opinion). There are also a few problems that would show up at the last
minute (and at great expense) when it was too late to find a fix. Last
but not least the following list also includes a few `features' for
which I was unable to find a better solution.

   · As of Kickstart 2.04 list displays look rather odd.

     The gadtools.library user interface support routines do not handle
     proportional-spaced fonts very well in v2.04. Try to use a
     different user interface font, preferably a fixed-width font.

   · With MagicMenu running in the background the checkmark and Amiga
     symbols overwrite some menu entries.

     MagicMenu does not notice `term' scales these symbols to fit the
     current screen display aspect ratio. Future versions of MagicMenu
     may address this problem.

   · With small terminal window sizes the status line display no longer
     fits into the window.

     `term' always pays attention to the terminal settings, it does not
     take the status line width into account. No harm should be done.

   · Not all the buttons in the file transfer window do what their
     labels say.

     The XPR library running the file transfer is responsible for
     listening to the commands `term' sends to it when the Stop entire
     transfer, Skip current file and Stop transfer batch buttons are
     pressed. Not all libraries will pay attention to these commands.
     So far only xprkermit.library responds to all commands. The
     xprzmodem.library included in the `term' distribution will ignore
     the Stop transfer batch command. All other XPR libraries either
     treat all buttons the same way, i.e. they stop the transfer no
     matter which button is pressed, or just pay attention to the Stop
     entire transfer command.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS

Frequently asked questions

   This section was written in order to answer the most frequently
asked questions concerning `term'. Although I don't suppose that the
users who this section was intended for will really ready it, but it may
nevertheless still be quite useful. Each entry in the following list
explains why a particular feature works this way or the other and
possibly why.

  1. While scrolling `term' quietly swallows characters and sometimes
     whole lines.

     Usually, `term' cannot process incoming serial data while the
     terminal output processing is taking place. If output processing
     takes too much time you may end up losing incoming data. There are
     several way how to approach this problem. You could reduce the
     number of colours used for screen output, or enable the terminal
     emulation process via the Enable emulation process switch in the
     section entitled terminal panel (see TERMINAL_PANEL).

  2. Right after a connection is established the modem hangs up the
     line.

     Following your configuration options `term' makes sure that the
     modem is set up correctly prior to making a call. Does the modem
     drop the line right after the CONNECT message is received your
     modem or the remote modem may reponsible. Not unheard of are
     modems which due to firmware trouble fail to negotiate correctly
     with the remote modem over the transmission protocol to be used.
     With error correction enabled such modems would drop the line right
     after establishing the connection. Turning off the error
     correction mode would correct this problem. `term' cannot do
     anything about the modem behaviour, it is up to you to find the
     correct setup.

  3. Trying to run the modem at higher baud rates causes the modem to
     ignore commands, it does not even echo characters back.

     A number of modems respond only to a fixed set of baud rates. While
     for example 9,600 bps are fine there is no response at 14,400 bps.
     I suggest that you try all available baud rates `term' supports
     until one is found to fit. Do not overdo it however, try to keep
     the baud rate below 57,600 bps.

  4. During file transfers error #6 is reported over and over again.

     Data transfer to and from the serial hardware is a time requires
     quick responses by the handler routines, this is why interrupt
     processing is used for such time-critical jobs. Unfortunately,
     these interrupts cannot always be serviced as fast as possible.
     Read and write accesses to disk may temporarily slow interrupt
     processing down or even disable it in short intervals. If the
     send/receive buffers keep flowing over I suggest that you use a
     smaller file buffer size, so data gets written to disk in smaller
     chunks, making the intervals smaller in which interrupt processing
     may be affected.  You can change the default file buffer size in
     the miscellaneous settings (see MISCELLANEOUS_PANEL). If this
     still does not have the desired effect, turn on the switch Simple
     file I/O (see MISCELLANEOUS_PANEL) and change the buffer size of
     the file transfer protocol you are using. Start with a small
     buffer size, such as 4,096 bytes and gradually increase it as long
     as transfers still work correctly.

  5. I have saved the phonebook and the configuration files to disk and
     an older `term' release reports that it cannot read them.

     `term' stores version information with the configuration files it
     saves. Older `term' releases will refuse to read files created by
     newer releases. Newer releases will almost always read
     configuration files by older `term' releases.

  6. I upgraded from an older `term' release, but the program refuses
     to read my configuration and phonebook files.

     The phonebook and configuration file format was changed and
     greatly enhanced with the introduction of `term' 3.1. Older files
     need to be converted to the new format, this is what the
     UpdateConfig program is for that should be included in the `term'
     distribution. The conversion is easy, just enter UpdateConfig <old
     file name> <new file name>, the program automatically determines
     whether it is reading a configuration or a phonebook file.

     Caution: the conversion program cannot read encrypted phonebook
     files, so they should be saved in unencrypted form first.

  7. In some BBSes ANSI graphics and text output starts at the wrong
     screen position, especially after the screen contents are erased.

     The so-called BBS-ANSI terminal command set treats the `clear
     screen command' different from the VT-100 specs, i.e. it expects
     the cursor to be reset to the home position. You can enable this
     feature using the CLS' resets cursor position switch which can be
     found in the emulation panel (see EMULATION_PANEL).

  8. The text buffer window does not show any special characters, such
     as accented characters, but only dots (`.').

     The text buffer window cannot display characters which fall into
     the range between code #127 and code #159. In order to show any
     text at all these codes get replaced by the dot character.

  9. When I upgraded from an older program release (1.6 - 2.3) to the
     new `term' release the program would no longer find all its
     configuration files.

     In order to annoy you and make things generally irritating some of
     the configuration files were renamed in v2.4, and some were moved
     to different directories. While the files used to be present in
     ENVARC:term `term' now looks for them in TERM:config.  If `term'
     finds no TERM: assignments, it will create one. If no TERM:config
     directory can be found, it will also be created.  The
     configuration files have been changed as follows:

    Preferences.term
    term_preferences.iff
          New name is now term.prefs

    Phonebook.term
    term_phonebook.iff
          New name is now phonebook.prefs

    Hotkeys.term
    term_hotkeys.iff
          New name is now hotkeys.prefs

    Speech.term
    term_speech.iff
          New name is now speech.prefs

    Macros.term
    term_macros.iff
    macros.prefs
          New name is now functionkeys.prefs

    Fast!Macros.term
    term_fastmacros.iff
          New name is now fastmacros.prefs

     In order to use `term' and termcap you need to rename the TERMPATH
     variable to TERMCONFIGPATH. Look into the ENVARC: directory,
     rename the file and reboot.

     Caution: it is not sufficient just to rename the file names, you
     will also have to take care of the phonebook entries.

 10. I have added several phone numbers to the quick dial menu, but
     `term' does not make them all available.

     `term' has room for only up to 50 quick dial entries, any further
     entries will be ignore.

 11. When transferring files between computers connected via null-modem
     cables the transfer always aborts immediately complaining that the
     DTR or the carrier signal was lost.

     During a null-modem transfer there is no carrier or DTR signals
     present, only modems and such offer such features. Switch the
     handshaking mode to None and turn off the Check carrier feature in
     the serial panel (see SERIAL_PANEL).

 12. The dialer skips two entries at once when pressing the Skip button.

     Pressing the Skip button stops dialing, most modems will respond
     to this with an OK message. Some modems will however send NO
     CARRIER, which `term' interpretes the same way as if BUSY had been
     sent. If this is what your modem does, change the `NO CARRIER' =
     `BUSY' switch in the Serial panel (see SERIAL_PANEL).

 13. During ZModem file transfers using a fast modem the CPS display
     first lists an incredibly high value, then drops sharply, followed
     by lots and lots of transfer errors occuring.

     This is effect is mostly seen if the Handshaking mode is not set
     to RTS/CTS when using a fast modem. The trouble is caused by data
     getting sent while the modem has already stopped accepting new
     data. It flags this states using the RTS/CTS line.

 14. None of my ARexx scripts works any more.

     In v3.1 the `term' ARexx interface was rewritten from scratch. If
     you wish to retain your old ARexx scripts they will need to be
     rewritten.

 15. During file transfers errors show up while data is saved to and
     read from a hard disk drive.

     Some hard disk drive controllers temporarily disable interrupt
     processing while accesses take place. In such cases I recommend to
     download and upload from the ram disk or to upgrade the hard disk
     driver.

 16. Even though the speech support feature is enabled, `term' does not
     speak a single word.

     With the introduction of Workbench 2.1 Commodore ceased to support
     the speech synthesizer. If you don't have narrator.device and
     translator.library installed the speech support will not work.

 17. When downloading files they don't end up in the right directory.

     The file transfer protocol usually has it's own opinion on where to
     place files it receives. This behaviour can be changed by editing
     the `term' settings, open the transfer panel (see TRANSFER_PANEL)
     and turn on the Override transfer path switch. Now you can select
     the names of the directories to store files received in using the
     path panel (see PATH_PANEL).

 18. Sometimes `term' stops processing input and output and just beeps
     when a key is hit.

     Look at the status line, if it displays Holding `term' has
     received an xOFF character. Press Control + S to restart.

 19. When I moved my configuration files into a different directory and
     updated my main configuration the phonebook entries started to
     `forget' about their settings files.

     `term' uses the environment variable TERMCONFIGPATH to locate its
     configuration files. However, the local phonebook entries may have
     different search paths set. Check the paths settings to see where
     they are pointing to.

 20. Even though several files are selected for transfer only the very
     first file is sent.

     Not every file transfer protocol supports batch transfers.  There
     is no way for `term' to tell whether a protocol supports batch
     transfers, please consult your protocol documentation for more
     information.

 21. Even though everything is set up correctly no ARexx scripts are
     executed.

     In order for ARexx to work the RexxMast program needs to be
     running. Usually, this program is located in the System drawer of
     your system partition.  Drag it into the WBStartup folder in order
     to use it at system startup time. Also make sure ARexx knows where
     to find your ARexx scripts. Either give a complete path name or
     copy your file into the REXX: drawer. Do not rely upon an Assign
     REXX: <drawer name> add call in your S:User-Startup file to work,
     as of this writing ARexx does not support multi-volume assignments.

 22. Even though the auto-download feature of the current file transfer
     protocol is enabled no auto transfer takes place while an ARexx
     script is running.

     Serial I/O processing only takes place if the main program takes
     care of terminal output.

 23. Running `term' twice from shell does not cause two `term'
     processes to be started, instead only the first program is
     reactivated.

     By default starting `term' more than once only brings an already
     running `term' process to the front. Use the NEW keyword to
     suppress this feature.

   (To be continued)



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/REPORTING_BUGS

Reporting bugs

   `term' is a rather complex program which is difficult to maintain,
especially since there is only one person to take care of it: me.
Although one tries to write correct, bug-free software, one cannot
always achieve this goal. Tough, but that's life. It rains when you
leave the umbrella at home. Toast falls buttered-side down. The phone
rings while you are in the bath.

   In case you come upon one of those nasty features which even the
author was unable to track down and remove, follow these steps:

  1. Keep calm.  Shouting, cursing, crushing disks may help to cool
     your temper, but it will not help anybody (the least yourself!) if
     it results in a sudden cardiac infarction: you will have problems
     in reporting the problem.

  2. Read the documentation!  The bug you may want to report may be a
     deliberate feature.

  3. Repeat previous step as often as possible.  Yes, really, do so.
     Read the documentation. You will be glad you did.

  4. Describe your problem elaborately.  A comment like `things fall
     down when dropped' may have inspired Sir Isaac Newton, but a
     similarly laconic comment `downloads do not work' will most
     certainly fail to give any useful hints how to approach the
     problem. In case you encounter a problem with the built-in
     terminal emulation, try to make a verbatim file capture (i.e. turn
     off the Capture filter) of the session in which the offending
     codes were used and send it to me.

  5. If you wish to report a bug in the ARexx interface include a
     sample ARexx script to produce the bug.

  6. Do not forget to write it down!  There is a difference between
     noticing a bug and reporting it (honestly!). Do not suppose that a
     bug will be fixed in a future program revision or rely on anybody
     else to report it: do it yourself. Send a letter to the author,
     preferably per electronic mailing services. The addresses are
     given at the end of this document.

  7. State your system and program configuration.  It helps a lot to
     know on which machine the program caused problems. Please include
     information such as memory expansion size, Amiga model (A500+,
     A600, A1200, A3000, A4000, etc.), graphics hardware (ECS, AGA,
     etc.), CPU type (MC68000, MC68020, MC68030, MC68040, etc.).


   If you can please run the standard Commodore debugging tools
(Enforcer, Sushi, tnt, MungWall, SegTracker) in the background and
capture the output. If you include Enforcer hit reports make sure that
you have SegTracker running in the background or the Enforcer output
will be worthless to me.

   Please direct reports of problems with the file transfer and
terminal emulation libraries to the respective authors, I am not
responsible for maintaining the support libraries.

   Error reports concerning the ARexx interface should include a sample
script to illustrate what is going wrong.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/BACKGROUND

Background

   This program is a product of anger and despair; I was unable to find
a telecommunications program to suit my personal needs, neither in the
commercial area, nor in the public-domain.

   Most programs had a lot of extras but lacked other more important,
perhaps more sensible features (just to take an example: in revision
2.20c and after four years of constant development Handshake still
fails to use the current keymap settings and also strips the high order
bit when receiving text - sorry Eric, that's why I never registered!).

   I have hesitated for a long time before starting my first attempt at
writing my very own telecommunications program. When Kickstart 2.x was
about to become widely available I took the opportunity to create
`term' always trying to use the new OS routines wherever possible.
While this started to be quite a difficult task it also was a lot of
fun (imagine Columbus wrecking his fleet four times on his journey to
the West Indies due to unexpected leakages in all vessels and sudden
changes in the ships' sailing manuals - that's how I felt!).

   As far as computer-telecommunications are concerned, Germany appears
to be a developing country. This is partly due to the Deutsche
Bundespost, the federal mail/phone company whose telecommunications
monopoly used to be protected by federal law.  Until 1989 you would
risk a heavy penalty if using a non-registered modem or telephone
instead of the Bundespost-supplied hardware. So, if you have any
complaints or miss a few extremely important features in `term', don't
boo and hiss, I am not as long in the telecomm business as you are (I
have yet seen only a single DEC VT-101 from afar!). Tell me what you
need and I will try to add it in the next revision.

   This project was started at December 24 1990 and completed by
January 25 1991.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/FUTURE

Future

   I spent almost five years of my life programming and updating `term'.
Support for new operating system features was added as soon as Commodore
lifted the veil. `term' grew both in functionality and size, it was
difficult to make plans for the path development would follow. While I
have no specific idea which turn development may take in the future
there are a few things I definitely do not want to add:

   · FAX support

     There are plenty of good commercial FAX solutions available for
     the Amiga. I lack both the time and the motivation to add FAX
     support to `term'. However, future `term' releases may provide
     interfaces to FAX programs.

   · More terminal emulations

     `term' offers support for the XEM standard, making it possible to
     easily add external terminal emulation libraries. If you are
     looking for a RIP emulation or a certain Data General terminal
     emulation, try to find an external emulation library.

   · Script language

     `term' supports ARexx, I don't see any reason why I should add
     another script language.

   · More file transfer protocols

     Except for the ASCII transfer routines `term' offers no built-in
     file transfer protocols. This is what the XPR interface is for,
     external file transfer libraries provide all the file transfer
     services. If you need a file transfer protocol, look for an
     external transfer protocol library.

   · Reduced functionality

     It was `tough' enough to implement all the features, bits & pieces
     that make up `term'. Honestly, I don't have the heart to cut back
     features.  It would not have been the first attempt to make `term'
     smaller either; there have been numerous attempts to create
     programs to copy the functionality of `term' or to build a
     smaller, scaled down terminal program based upon the `term' source
     code. As far as I know none of these attempts was successful.

   It is difficult to judge how the next `term' release will look like.
Also, v4.3 may be the last `term' release, but then again maybe not.
The future of `term' depends on its users, and this includes you.

screen bitmaps in a system-integrated manner and to Nicola Salmoria
whose invaluable assistance helped to reduce the incredible number of
bugs lurking in the source code.

   Additional user interface wizardry and advice by Martin Taillefer.
The file transfer section of this manual was rewritten to incorporate
several suggestions made by Mike Safer.

   The XPR libraries were created by Terence Finney (bplus), Marco Papa
& Stephen Walton (kermit), Jack Rouse (quickb), Marc Boucher (xmodem),
Ueli Kaufmann (ascii, ymodem & vms) and Rick Huebner & William M.
Perkins (zmodem).

   The XPR standard was created by Willy Langeveld, the quicksort
routine (QuickSort.asm) was written by David Jones.

   The current implementation of the external terminal emulation
library interface was developed by Ueli Kaufmann, who also wrote the
external terminal emulation libraries supplied with `term'.  Without
the invaluable help of Martin Berndt the library interface would
probably not be working at all.

   Since time did not permit me to translate the full original German
documentation into English, I had asked the Z-Net Amiga community for
help. As a result this document was translated by three different

* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/SOURCE_CODE

Source code

   Since there are still only very few well-documented examples (or
general programming examples) for Kickstart 2.x and Kickstart 3.x I
have decided to include the full `C' source code with the `term'
distribution.

   The source code is not intended for commercial use. If you are about
to include portions in commercial programs you will need to ask me for
permission. Still you may use parts of the source code for
non-commercial software development without my consent.

   I sincerely hope that the release of the full `term' source code
will give Kickstart 2.x a better start (I've overcome quite a lot of
obstacles) so that more programs to use the new OS features will be
available soon.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/DOCUMENTATION_AND_ONLINE_HELP

Documentation and online help

   `term' comes bundled with a number of documentation files, these are:

term.doc
     Human-readable english program documentation in standard ASCII
     format.

term.guide
     English program documentation in AmigaGuide format suitable to
     submit to AmigaGuide or MultiView.

termRexx.doc
     Human-readable english `term' ARexx interface documentation in
     standard ASCII format. This file describes all the ARexx host
     commands `term' supports and also gives a brief introduction how
     to use them.

termRexx.guide
     English ARexx interface documentation in AmigaGuide format
     suitable to submit to AmigaGuide or MultiView.

xprascii.doc ... xprzmodem.doc
     Human-readable documentation on the XPR transfer libraries
     supplied with `term'.

   In addition to the pure ASCII files documentation files are
available in TeX-DVI format and Postscript. As space requirements do
not permit to include them on the distribution disks they are only
available directly from the author.

term.dvi
     English program documentation in a format suitable for printing
     using a utility to print TeX-DVI-output files, such as supplied
     with the packages AmigaTeX or PasTeX.

term.ps
     English program documentation in Postscript format. This file was
     generated from term.dvi using the dvips utility.

termRexx.dvi
     English ARexx interface documentation in a format suitable to
     printing using a utility to print TeX-DVI-output files, such as
     supplied with the packages AmigaTeX or PasTeX.

termRexx.ps
     English ARexx interface documentation in Postscript format.  This
     file was generated from termRexx.dvi using the dvips utility.

   In order to take advantage of the online-help feature, AmigaGuide
and the file term.guide are required. Copy the file to the drawer the
`term' main program is located in and configure the `term' help text
file settings (see PATH_PANEL) to point to PROGDIR:term.guide. Once
this has been done, pressing the Help key in any window to support
online help will bring up a help window.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/FOREIGN_LANGUAGE_SUPPORT

Foreign language support

   `term' supports foreign language text catalog tables as introduced
with Workbench 2.1 locale.library. As of this writing there are Danish,
Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish translations of the
program text available. If you wish to create your own national
translation table you should consult the program source code file
term-blank.ct which is a blank translation table. Before actually
starting to fill in the translation table you should contact me first;
there may already be someone preparing a translation. However, you
should keep in mind that once you have created a foreign language
translation of the program text I may ask you to update your
translation for a future program release.

   Once you are finished with the translation table, send it to me on
disk or via eMail, don't compile the catalog on your own!.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/WORKBENCH_AND_SHELL

Workbench and Shell

   The program can be started both from Workbench and from Shell.
Kickstart 2.04 (revision 37.175) and Workbench 2.04 (revision 37.67)
are the minimum required to run `term'.

   The `behaviour' of `term' can be changed by adding tool type entries
to the corresponding Workbench icon or by specifying additional command
line parameters when running the program from the Shell. Supported
keywords are:

WINDOW
     The console window specifier to be used when opening terminal
     output windows (this will override the default settings). The
     default is CON:0/11//100/term Output Window/CLOSE/SCREEN %s. The
     %s will be replaced by the name of the public screen `term'
     uses.

PUBSCREEN
     The name of a public screen to open the `term' window on. In case
     the public screen happens to be unavailable, `term' will fall back
     to the Workbench screen. Note that `term' assumes that the main
     window is to be opened on a public screen rather than on a custom
     screen if this option is in effect, regardless how the default
     settings may be configured.

STARTUP
     The name of an ARexx script file to be run on program startup.

PORTNAME
     The ARexx host port name `term' is to use instead of the built-in
     default name. The port name will be translated to upper case
     characters as required by the ARexx host port naming convention.
     The resulting name must be unique or `term' will fall back to its
     built-in default name.

SETTINGS
     This keyword determines where to read the default configuration
     file from. In order to read it from Work:term/config, one would use
     term Settings Work:term/config from Shell or add the tooltype
     entry SETTINGS=Work:term/config from Workbench. This argument does
     not necessarily need give the name of a path to search, but can
     also specify the name of the configuration file to be used.

UNIT
     Similar to the DEVICE keyword the UNIT keywords affects the serial
     driver settings. It determines which serial driver unit is to be
     used instead of the one specified in the default configuration
     file. In order to use unit number 4 one would use term Unit 4 from
     Shell or add the tooltype entry UNIT=4 from Workbench.

DEVICE
     In order to use a different serial device driver than the one
     specified in the default configuration file, use this keyword. To
     use duart.device one would use term Device duart.device from Shell
     or add the tooltype entry DEVICE=duart.device from Workbench.

QUIET
     If this parameter is present, the program will not start opening a
     display but rather put an icon on the Workbench backdrop, waiting
     to be invoked. A double-click will bring it to life. This
     parameter will be ignored in case the STARTUP-Parameter is used
     along with it.

SYNC (Shell only)
     If called from Shell `term' will detach itself immediately
     allowing the Shell window to be closed afterwards. This effect can
     be avoided if SYNC is entered in the command line.

NEW (Shell only)
     Usually, running `term' twice will cause the screen of the other
     program to be popped to the front instead of creating a second
     `term' process. To avoid this effect, enter NEW as a calling
     parameter. If called from Workbench, each program will run as a
     separate process.

BEHIND
     This option will cause `term' to open its screen behind all other
     screens and not to activate its window.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/USER_INTERFACE_NOTES

User interface notes

   To operate a gadget, press the key corresponding to the letter
highlighted in the gadget label. Suppose a slider is labeled Baud rate
with the letter r of the word rate underlined; in order to increase the
slider value one had to hit the key labeled R, to decrease the value
one is to hold down either Shift key while pressing the key R.

   With some requesters and windows text gadgets will be
auto-activated. Pressing the Return key will cycle through all the
available text gadgets, holding down either Shift key will break the
cycle.

   Windows in which only a single scrolling list is present cursor keys
may be used to scroll the contents.

   The Return and Escape keys are respected by most windows. A button
surrounded by a recessed box represents the default choice in a
requester, pressing the Return key will select it. The Escape key
always selects the `stop' or `cancel' button usually to be found in the
lower right corner of a window. Most windows to feature a close gadget
in the upper left corner can be closed by pressing the Escape key.

   In control panels featuring a Page button, pressing the Tab key will
flip the pages.

   Numeric entry fields accept input several notations, namely
hexadecimal ($.. and 0x..), octal (&..) and binary (%..).

   The user interface support library tries to make all control panel
windows fit on the screen. If the first attempt fails a different font
is used. If this did not help either a new screen will be opened for
the window. This screen will usually be larger than the visible region.
Move the mouse towards the borders of the screen to reveal more of it.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/SCREEN

Screen

   At the bottom of the `term' screen or window a small display shows
a few basic parameters. These are:

Status
     The current program operating status. This includes Ready, Holding
     (Control + S was pressed), Dialing (the dialing function is at
     work), Upload (data is being sent), Download (data is being
     received), Breaking (a break signal is transmitted across the
     serial line), Hanging up (connection is being cancelled), Recording
     (a script is being recorded) and Rec.line (a line of text is being
     recorded).

Buffer
     Indicates whether the text buffer is currently recording incoming
     text or whether the current text buffer contents are frozen.

Protocol
     The currently selected data transfer protocol.

Emulation
     The currently active terminal emulation mode.

Rate
     The data transfer rate in bits per second (= Baud).

Params.
     The current serial parameters (Data bits-Parity-Stop bits).

Time
     The current time of day.

Online
     The time elapsed after a connection was successfully established.
     This counter will be stopped as soon as the connection is
     cancelled (e.g. by hanging up) and is reset to 00:00:00 as soon as
     a new connection is made.

     This display will show the online time, the online cost or both
     (toggled every five seconds) depending on your current settings.

   Unless configured different, the screen itself is opened as a public
screen (called TERM) which is available to other programs for their
purposes. If more than one `term' process is running, the public screen
name will change according to the number of the program (i.e. the first
`term' to be started will call the scren TERM, the second one will call
it TERM.1, the third one TERM.2, etc.). The screen title bar will also
display the name of the public screen.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/MENUS

Menus

   For each requester and input window there exists a set of menu items
to execute the commands associated with the buttons, dials and gauges in
the requester/window. Press the right mouse button to have a look at
the commands and their shortcuts.

   The following text is to describe the menu items available in the
`term' main menu.


  PROJECT    Printing, log files, iconification, program termination
  EDIT       Clipboard support
  CMDS.      ARexx- and AmigaDOS command execution
  PHONE      Modem and dialing functions
  TRANSF.    File transfer functions
  BUFFER     Text buffer functions
  TERMINAL   Terminal emulation control
  SETTINGS   Program settings control
  WINDOWS    Auxiliary windows
  DIAL       The quick dialing menu



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PROJECT

Project

Save screen as Picture/Text
     This menu serves to save the current terminal window contents
     either as plain ASCII text file or as a picture file.

Print Screen (as text)/Clipboard
     These menu entries are to output plain text on the printer. You
     can either print the contents of the main screen or the contents
     of the clipboard.

Print Screen (as graphics)
     Select this menu entry to make a hardcopy of the screen contents.
     Printing will respect screen colours and follow the on-screen bit
     image.

Capture to File/Printer
     Selecting one of these menu entries will toggle capturing incoming
     text to the printer and/or a file on disk.

Iconify
     Closes all screens and windows `term' has currently open, if this
     feature is enabled, resets and releases the serial driver and puts
     an icon into the Workbench window.  Double-clicking this icon will
     cause `term' to wake up and to return the state is was in before
     iconification took place.

     While `term' is iconified, most incoming ARexx-commands will be
     queued and the corresponding ARexx scripts will appear to `hang'.
     In order to reactivate the program either double-click on the
     program icon or send the ARexx command ACTIVATE. As soon as `term'
     is `awake' again pending commands will be processed again

About
     Shows some information on the program.

Quit
     Terminates the program, hold down a Shift key to quit immediately,
     otherwise you will be prompted to confirm your decision.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/EDIT

 Edit

Copy
     In order to transfer any currently marked screen text to the
     clipboard buffer, select this menu item. Text can be marked by
     double-clicking the select button while the mouse is over a word
     or by clicking the select button and dragging the mouse. Holding
     down either shift key will append the selected text to the current
     clipboard contents.  In any other case the new text will replace
     the previous contents.

Paste
     Pastes the contents of the clipboard at the current cursor position
     provided that the clipboard contains text data. Hold down either
     Shift key to have `term' include the Paste prefix and the Paste
     suffix (see CLIPBOARD_PANEL) along with the clipboard contents.

Clear
     Any currently marked text will be released as soon as any rendering
     operations are to be executed in the main window. To release marked
     text manually, select this menu item.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/CMDS.

Cmds. (= Commands)

Execute AmigaDOS command
     Enter the command you want to execute and its command line
     arguments here.

Execute ARexx command
     This function calls the ARexx server to execute a script file. If
     the first input character is a ` or " the input will be considered
     as a small program in a single line. Note that this function will
     not be available if the ARexx server isn't running.

     The ARexx command set supported by `term' is described in the
     `term' ARexx interface documentation.

Record script
     Select this menu item to start/stop script recording. More on
     script recording can be found under script recording (see
     SCRIPT_RECORDING).

Record line
     When in script recording mode this menu item will cause `term' to
     temporarily switch into full line recording mode, rather than
     recording only single keystrokes. Pressing the shift+return keys
     has the same effect as calling the Record line menu item. More on
     the topic of script recording can be found under script recording
     (see SCRIPT_RECORDING).

Edit traps...
     This brings up the trap list editor (see TRAP_PANEL.  The list
     includes control sequences `term' is to look for in the incoming
     data stream. When a sequence is found the corresponding command
     sequence (see COMMAND_SEQUENCES) is executed.

     The window contains the usual list management tools (edit, add,
     remove, clear and move). Please note that the order of processing
     occurs top-down, i.e. of two entries with the same control
     sequence data only the top-most will be evaluated.

     The buttons Load and Save will let you restore and save the
     current trap list. The Load button appends the contents of a trap
     list file to the current trap list, so take care. On startup
     `term' looks for a configuration file named trap.prefs and tries
     to load it. Thus, there can be only one global trap list. It is up
     to ARexx to load and modify the contents of the trap list,
     although this editor window provides a graphical interface to the
     list. Please note that the more list entries `term' has to filter
     through the input data stream the slower input processing may
     become, affecting mostly terminal output.

Disable traps
     This menu item provides a shortcut to stop trap list processing.
     On startup `term' will enable trap list processing if the trap
     list loaded from disk is non-empty.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PHONE

Phone

Phonebook
     The phonebook is one of the most powerful and complex functions of
     `term' and will be described later in this document (see
     PHONEBOOK).

Redial
     Dialing list entries which the dialing routine was unable to
     establish a connection to are once again passed to the dialer.

Dial phone number
     To dial a single phone number select this menu item. The phone
     number entered will be passed to the dialing routine.

Send break
     Sends a `break' signal across the serial line.

Hang up
     Tells the modem to hang up the serial line.

Wait
     Will cause `term' to emit the character sequence <Blank
     space><Backspace> every second in order to fool the remote into
     believing that terminal input is currently taking place.

Flush receive buffer
     Tells the serial driver to drop its input buffer contents and
     resets the state of the internal serial buffers.

Release serial device
     The serial driver is released for other programs to use it. A
     requester will appear which allows you to reopen the serial driver
     or to quit `term'.

     If the serial driver has been released by the ARexx interface and
     has not been reopened yet, this menu item will do it.

   If you are still online, the Redial and Dial menu entries will be
disabled. In order to make another call, hang up the line first.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TRANSF.

Transf. (= Transfer)

   This menu provides access to file transfer functions. For more
information on this topic, see TRANSFER_PANEL, XPR_OPTIONS_SAMPLE,
TRANSFER_PROGRESS_PANEL, ASCII-TRANSFER_PANEL and
ASCII-TRANSFER_SETTINGS.

Upload ASCII file(s)
     This is a pure ASCII-file upload. It was added to allow poor BBS
     programs to receive text files.

Download ASCII file(s)
     This is a pure ASCII-file download. Refer to Upload ASCII file(s)
     for features/options of this mode.

Upload text file(s)
     Sends a file/files to the remote receiver using the current
     transfer protocol. If possible this command will `ask' the
     transfer protocol to transmit the file(s) in text mode (whatever
     that means) which may include CR/LF substitution and other
     gimmicks. Consult the library documentation to find out if your
     favourite transfer library supports text mode.

Download text file(s)
     Request a file/files using the current transfer protocol. Refer to
     Upload text file(s) for features/options of this mode.

Edit & upload text file
     Invokes the currently selected (see PATH_PANEL) text editor on a
     file to be selected using a file requester. `term' pays attention
     to the EDITOR environment variable and will use the program
     indicated by it.

     `term' will block and wait until the editor has returned.

     After the editor has returned, the user will be asked whether the
     file edited is to be transferred as plain ASCII or via text upload.

Upload binary file(s)
     Send a file/files to the remote receiver using the current transfer
     protocol. True batch upload is supported both through wildcard
     expressions (#?.txt will send all files whose names end with .txt)
     or through multiple selection. Refer to the documentation of your
     favourite transfer library to find out if batch file transfer is
     supported.

Download binary file(s)
     Receive a file/files using the current transfer protocol. If the
     protocol does not support batch download you are required to enter
     the name of the file to be received. Files which remain empty
     after the transfer are deleted automatically.

   The transfer routines open an information window in which a number of
transfer parameters are displayed (see TRANSFER_PROGRESS_PANEL).



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/BUFFER

Buffer

Clear buffer
     Clears the contents of the text buffer (see TEXT_BUFFER). Any text
     will be discarded and cannot be recovered. Capture files are not
     affected by this command.

Display buffer
     Opens the text buffer screen (see TEXT_BUFFER).

Close buffer
     Closes the text buffer screen but does not free the contents.

Freeze buffer
     This menu entry will, if enabled, stop the text buffer from
     filling up with new text.

Load buffer
     Loads the contents of the text buffer from a file. If there are
     still text lines in the text buffer a requester will appear giving
     you the choice to discard the old data, append the new data, or to
     cancel the action.

Save buffer as
     Saves the contents of the text buffer to a file. You will be
     notified if the file to save to already exists (you may discard
     the old file, append the new data or cancel the action).



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TERMINAL

* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/SERIAL_PANEL

Serial panel

   This is where the serial parameters may be changed.

Baud rate
     The transfer speed in bits per second at which `term' communicates
     with the serial hardware. The minimum value allowed is 110 baud.
     You may enter any value you like but keep in mind that not all
     modems will respond to all possible settings.  Clicking on the
     arrows pointing to the left and to the right will cycle through a
     set of predefined rates.

     As of this writing the standard Amiga serial hardware is capable
     of running baud rates from 110 up to and including 1,000,000 bits
     per second. These are the basic hardware limits, but in practice
     reliable transfer speeds are far lower at 57,600 baud and below.
     Custom serial hardware may support higher transfer rates. Do not
     underestimate the overhead caused by the terminal program &
     interrupt processing and the effects of connecting cable lengths.

     Most modems will not recognize a sudden change in the baud rate.
     Type AT<RETURN> to make the change known.

     With data transfer speed greater than 2,400 baud most modems
     require flow control to be used in order to guarantee reliable
     data transfer.  In such cases it is recommended to set the
     Protocol switch to RTS/CTS. If you fail to do so you may lose
     data.

Bits/char
     Number of bits per transferred character (7 or 8). As of this
     writing the Amiga serial hardware does not support all possible
     bits/char, parity and stop bits combinations.

Parity
     Serial parity (none, odd, even, mark or space). As of this writing
     the Amiga serial hardware does not support all possible bits/char,
     parity and stop bits combinations.

Stop bits
     Number of stop bits (1 or 2). As of this writing the Amiga serial
     hardware does not support all possible bits/char, parity and stop
     bits combinations.

Handshaking
     Serial handshaking mode (RTS/CTS 7 wire hardware handshaking,
     RTS/CTS with DSR signal check, none).  The RTS/CTS (DSR) mode will
     make `term' check the `data set ready' signal first before turning
     on RTS/CTS handshaking. If no signal is present `term' will turn
     off RTS/CTS 7 wire hardware handshaking.

     Some modems will appear to `lock up' when the RTS/CTS handshaking
     protocol is enabled. This may either be due to a faulty connecting
     cable (not all cables properly connect the pins required for 7
     wire hardware handshaking) or due to configuration problems. Some
     modems factory settings are incompatible with the way the Amiga
     handles hardware handshaking. In such a case it is very likely that
     the modem does not set the so-called DSR signal by default. To
     change this, first turn off RTS/CTS handshaking, then type the
     command AT&S0 and press return, now turn RTS/CTS handshaking on
     again.

     The RTS/CTS handshaking protocol must be used for reliable modem
     connections using transmission speeds of 4,800 baud and above.

Duplex
     Determines whether characters are echoed back to the terminal
     screen or not (full, half = local echo).

Buffer size
     The number to be specified here allows to set the serial driver I/O
     buffer size. Every number you enter here will result in `term' and
     the serial driver allocating twice the buffer size (this is only a
     word of warning for those among us who prefer buffer sizes of 256K
     and up).

Break length
     Length of the break signal given in microseconds.

Strip bit 8
     If this switch is effect each character received or transmitted by
     `term' will have its high-order bit cleared.

Shared access
     This switch allows you to run the serial driver in shared access
     mode.  Not all driver types will allow this to happen.

Handle xON/xOFF internally
     This switch enables the internal processing of the flow-control
     characters xON (= Control + S) and xOFF (= Control + Q).  Whenever
     you press Control + S `term' will change its state to `holding'
     and stop terminal input and output processing.  Press Control + Q
     in order to restart.

Pass xON/xOFF through
     If this switch is enabled, `term' will pass the xON/xOFF
     characters through to the modem rather than quietly discarding
     them.

Check carrier
     `term' will recognize the NO CARRIER message a modem emits when
     the carrier line signal drops back to low. For maximum safety,
     `term' will also check the carrier signal line after receiving the
     NO CARRIER message if this switch is enabled. This is to make sure
     that no accidentally appearing text causes confusion.

     If this switch is enabled, `term' will check the carrier signal
     during file transfers and will stop the transfer if the signal is
     lost. It will also check the carrier signal at program startup and
     if the signal is detected will start the online timer. If offline,
     `term' will check the carrier signal periodically and go into
     online state if the signal is detected.

     Note:  Be sure to switch the carrier detect check off in case you
     wish to transfer files using a null-modem cable!

High-speed mode
     Activates a special mode of the serial driver which is to skip a
     couple of internal parity and stop bits checks resulting in higher
     data throughput rate. If this switch is turned on, the serial
     parameters will be reset to 8 bits per character, no parity and 1
     stop bit. Do not expect dramatic speed increases.

Direct connection
     You can directly connect the Amiga to other computers, such as by
     using a nullmodem cable. In such a case it does not make good
     sense to enforce a carrier signal check or to warn you if the
     transmission speed requires that you enable RTS/CTS handshaking.
     This switch disables both features.

Quantum
     The number of bytes `term' tries to read in one chunk at a time.
     The more bytes read, the more time it takes to process them. While
     the text is processed, mouse and keyboard input are delayed.
     Choose this value with care.

Use OwnDevUnit
     This switch controls whether Christopher Wichura's
     OwnDevUnit.library will be used to schedule access of multiple
     programs to the currently selected serial device driver.

Satisfy requests
     When a program requests access to the serial device driver, `term'
     is supposed to let go of the driver if possible. This switch
     controls what `term' will do in this case:

    Release device
          The driver is released, just as if you would select the main
          menu item of the same name.

    Release device, attempt to reown
          The device driver is released, but `term' will retry every
          four seconds to reopen and thus `reown' it again.

    Keep device open
          `term' always ignores requests to release the device driver.

Serial device
     The name of the serial driver to be used by `term'. This is usually
     serial.device (modem0.device for the internal Supra modem,
     sxbios.device for ASDG's serial IO card, etc.; consult your
     hardware manual for more information).

Device unit number
     The device unit number of the serial driver selected above. This is
     usually left `0' but can also be used to address multiple serial IO
     ports.

Use
     Accept the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Don't use the current settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/MODEM_PANEL

Modem panel

   This is where modem control text and other related parameters are
configured.

Modem initialization command
     The text to send to the modem after successful program
     initialization.  This text is optional and thus does not need to
     be present.

     The dialing routine will use the initialization text entered here
     before dialing a phone number. You can separate multiple
     initialization commands with vertical bar (|) characters.  Only
     the dialer will use them.

Modem exit command
     The text to be sent to the modem shortly before the program
     terminates. Just like the modem init text it is optional and does
     not need to be present.

     The dialing routine will use the initialization text entered here
     before dialing the next telephone number.

     The dialing routine will use the exit text entered here before
     dialing a phone number. You can separate multiple exit commands
     with vertical bar (|) characters.  Only the dialer will use them.

Hang up command
     The text to be sent to the modem when asked to hang up the line.
     This text does have to be present if the Drop DTR on hangup switch
     is enabled.

Command character send delay
     You will only rarely use this feature. Some of the more modern
     high-speed modems with rather unreliable firmware which support
     baud rates of 28,800 bps and up cannot quite make sense of modem
     initialization and dialing commands if sent at this speed.
     However, small delays between the single characters sent to the
     modem can help. Just set the number of microseconds to wait here.

`No carrier' message
     The message the modem emits if the data carrier is lost. The
     program uses this to determine the length of the connection and to
     calculate how much the user is to pay for it.

`No dialtone' message
     The message to be returned by the modem in case it does not detect
     any dialing tone on the phone line.

`Connect' message
     The message the modem emits after detecting a carrier signal.
     `term' uses this input to determine successful telephone
     connection, to reconfigure itself and to start the online timer.

`Voice' message
     The message `term' is expected to receive if the modem detects a
     voice call. If in dialing mode, `term' will stop the process. The
     user will in any case be notified of the event.

`Ring' message
     The message the modem emits if it receives a call, same effects as
     with the Voice message.

`Busy' message
     The message the modem returns if the number which has just been
     dialed is busy.

`Ok' message
     The message the modem returns if a command was successfully
     executed.

`Error' message
     The message the modem returns if a command was not to be executed
     successfully.

Dial command prefix
     The text to be used to prefix each dialing command. This is
     usually a variant of ATDP or ATDT.

Dial command suffix
     The text to be used to append to each dialing command. This is
     usually the carriage-return character \r.

Dial mode
     This switch affects whether dialing commands will use touch tone or
     pulse dialing. Touch tone dialing usually is quite a bit faster
     than pulse dialing, but not all phone networks support it. This
     switch requires that either the dial prefix or dial suffix commands
     include the \\W command sequence (see COMMAND_SEQUENCES).

Redial delay
     The time to wait after walking through the whole dialing list
     without making any successful connection before another attempt is
     started.

Dial retries
     The number of times the dialer walks through the dialing list
     trying to make a successful connection before giving up. Setting
     this value to `unlimited' will cause the dialer to retry over and
     over again until it either makes a connection or the dialing
     procedure is aborted.

Dial timeout
     The time to wait for a successful connection during dialing. After
     this time has elapsed, the dialer will skip to the next entry in
     the list.

Delay between calls
     Some modems impose a limit on how many times you may dial out in a
     minute or just get hopelessly lost if dial commands come in in
     rapid succession. Here is where you set the time to wait between
     two successive calls. This value also has a profound effect on the
     redial delay which will be extended a bit if it is smaller than
     the delay between calls.

Redial after hanging up
     If this switch is in effect, `term' will redial all the phone
     numbers still in the dialing list as soon as the line is hung up
     or the carrier signal is lost.

Verbose dialing
     By default, `term' will not display any modem response text that is
     received while it is dialing. If you enable this switch no modem
     output will be swallowed, it will even find its way into the
     review buffer.

Connect auto-baud
     Most modems echo the baud rate upon successful connection. If
     enabled the baud rate will be read and set for the serial driver.

     Use this feature with care as it may have certain negative
     side-effects (such as the modem dropping the line just after
     connecting to a BBS)!  If you happen to use a modern high-speed
     modem you will most certainly not need this feature. If in doubt
     whether you need to enable this feature you should rather disable
     it!

Drop DTR on hangup
     Some modems will track the data terminal ready line in order to
     make sure that the terminal program is listening. Once the line
     goes back to low potential, these modems will drop the line and
     hang up. Use this button to make `term' take advantage of this
     feature.

`NO CARRIER' = `BUSY'
     If this switch is in effect, the dialing function will treat the
     modem response code NO CARRIER exactly as the BUSY response code.

Dialer abort hangs up
     Unless this switch is enabled the dialing procedure will try to
     stop a modem dial command by sending a plain carriage return
     character.  If the Dialer abort hangs up switch is enabled the
     usual modem hang up procedure will be used instead.

Time to connect
     `term' cannot measure the time to pass between the remote modem
     picking up the line and the local modem sending the CONNECT
     message. This slider allows to set the length of this interval.
     Upon connection, it will be added to the total online time.

Connect limit
     This gauge is to set a certain period of time to be counted after
     a connection is made. When elapsed, a command sequence (see
     COMMAND_SEQUENCES) will be executed as to be set using the Limit
     macro settings. If set to 0:00 this function will be disabled.

Limit macro
     A command sequence to be triggered when the time to be set using
     the Connect limit gauge has elapsed. If no text is entered this
     function will be disabled.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep original settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/SCREEN_PANEL

Screen panel

Display mode
     Choose the display mode `term' is to use for the main screen here.

Screen font
     This is where you choose the user interface font `term' is to use
     for the main screen.

Faster layout
     Activating this switch will slow down display updates and window
     management. Oh well, not always, there may be a speed increase with
     some configurations, such as with external emulations activated or
     when using more than four colours on the screen.

     I suggest to experiment with the effects of this button before
     actually using it permanently.

Make screen public
     If this switch is enabled, the `term' main screen will be made
     available as a public area other programs may open their windows
     on.

`Shanghai' windows
     This item, which is only displayed if Make screen public has been
     selected, is closely related to the function before. If active, all
     windows that will normally be displayed on the Workbench screen
     will open on the `term' main screen.

Use public screen
     `term' does not necessarily open a custom screen, this switch will
     make the main and auxilary windows appear on a named public
     screen. `term' will try to adapt colours and text rendering modes
     to its new environment. It will share the screen palette with
     other applications which makes it possible to run the built-in
     terminal emulation in eight or sixteen colours provided that
     enough shareable screen pens are available (note:  Kickstart 3.0
     required). `term' will inherit the text font to be used for user
     interface layout from the public screen it will open its window on.

     Note:  only the built-in terminal emulation is guaranteed to take
     advantage of pen-sharing facilities, external emulation libraries
     will most likely fail to display text correctly!

     Take care when resizing the `term' main window as a size change
     will reset the terminal emulation.

Public screen name
     The name of the public screen `term' is to open windows on. `term'
     will fall back to the Workbench screen if no proper name is given
     (i.e. no name is entered) or the desired screen is unavailable.

Screen title
     If this button is enabled, the `term' screen will contain a
     draggable title bar, if not, the title bar will be disabled,
     leaving more space for the terminal output window.

Window border
     The main window will be opened on a custom screen, featuring a
     drag bar and depth gadgets.

Separate status window
     A separate window will be opened for the status display window.

Status line
     This switch allows to disable the status line display or to change
     between two alternative status line displays:

    Disabled
          No status line is displayed.

    Standard
          The standard two status lines are displayed.

    Compact
          A very condensed version of the status line is displayed,
          only the data is shown but no captions. The data is displayed
          in the following order:

            1. Status

            2. Terminal type

            3. Transfer protocol

            4. Baud rate

            5. Serial parameters

            6. Time of day

            7. Online time

Online display
     This switch determines what type of information is to be displayed
     in the bottom right corner of the status display:

    Online time
          The time online

    Online cost
          The amount of money to be paid for the connection

    Time & cost
          Both time and money, the display will toggle between both of
          them every five seconds.

Colour
     This button determines the colour mode the terminal emulation is
     going to use. Until now, four modes have been implemented:

    4 Colours (Amiga)
          Four colours, optionally blinking.

    8 Colours (ANSI)
          Eight colours, optionally blinking.

    16 Colours (EGA)
          Sixteen colours, as the EGA-palette, optionally blinking.

    2 Colours (Mono.)
          Monochrome, two colours.

Blinking
     If selected the VT-100 blinking option is enabled. This may
     require to allocate more colours for a specific colour mode than
     with blinking disabled, so do not be surprised if display
     performance suddenly drops like a brick.

Palette
     These buttons are used to select a colour of the screen palette
     that is to be changed.

Red/Green/Blue
     Use these sliders to modify the red, green and blue components of
     the currently active colour.

Use default colours
     Press this button to have the current colour palette set to the
     built-in default colours.

Use standard pens
     The user interface look is determined by the choice of on-screen
     rendering pens, i.e. which colour to use for highlighted text,
     active windows, inactive windows, etc. If this button is enabled
     the screen will be opened using a predefined standard set of
     drawing pens.

Edit pens...
     Pressing this button will open the pen panel (see PEN_PANEL) which
     permits editing the drawing pens to use for this colour mode.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings; making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PEN_PANEL

 Pen panel

   This control panel is available under Kickstart 3.0 and above only.
Its functionality is not supported under previous operating system
releases!

   The user interface look is determined by the choice of on-screen
rendering pens, i.e. which colour to use for highlighted text, active
windows, inactive windows, etc. Changing the screen colour palette also
affects the look of the user interface, this control panel permits to
compensate for such changes: even if you reverse the terminal colours
you can still retain the correct user interface look by adapting the
pens. The controls available are similar to the Workbench Preferences
editor program Palette:

Background
     The screen background colour to use, by default this is colour 0.

Text
     The default colour to render common text, such as in control panel
     labels.

Important text
     The colour to draw important text in, this should put a certain
     emphasis on the text rendered so the colour should be different
     from the Text colour.

Bright edges
     The colour to use to render the bright edges of windows.

Dark edges
     The colour to use to render the dark edges of windows.

Active window title bars
     The colour to mark the currently active window and selected
     buttons and list entries.

Active window titles
     The colour to use when printing text over active window title bars,
     selected buttons and list entries.

Menu background
     The colour to render pull-down menus in.

Menu text
     The colour to use when printing the menu text.

Use standard pens
     Reset the current pen selection to default values.

Use
     Keep the current settings.

Cancel
     Return to previous settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TERMINAL_PANEL

Terminal panel

   These settings control the basic behaviour of the terminal emulation
`term' uses. More specific emulation options are available in the
emulation window (see EMULATION_PANEL).

Emulation
     This is where you select the terminal emulation. Choose one of the
     following:

    ANSI/VT-220
          This emulation is a `melange' of three terminal command sets
          which themselves are supersets or subsets of one another. Most
          of the VT-220 command set is supported, including some
          additions made in the ANSI X3.64 specifications. With VT-220
          its subsets VT-100 and VT-102 are supported. However, not all
          the VT-52 commands are supported.

    Atomic
          A plain text-only terminal mode which filters out terminal
          commands and special control characters.

    TTY
          Also a text-only terminal mode but which displays all control
          codes and commands it cannot handle on-screen, great for
          debugging.

    Hex
          Another debugging mode which displays all incoming data in
          hexadecimal notation. If possible the corresponding glyphs
          will be displayed as well.

    External
          This enables the use of external terminal emulation libraries
          following the XEM v2.0 specifications. In this mode you need
          to specify the library to use, otherwise `term' will return to
          ANSI/VT-220 mode.

Emulation name
     The name of an external terminal emulation library to be used by
     `term' instead of the built-in emulation code. Requires that the
     emulation mode is set to External

Bell
     This is where you select the action(s) `term' is to take whenever a
     bell character turns up in the data stream:

    Visual
          The screen will flash.

    Audible
          An audible signal will be generated.

    Visual & audible
          A combination of both effects.

    Ignore
          Nothing will happen.

    System default
          The system beep routines will be used.

Columns
     The number of columns to use for the terminal window. The minimum
     value is 20 columns, the maximum value is defined by the actual
     screen size.

Lines
     The number of lines to use for the terminal window. The minimum
     value is 20 lines, the maximum value is defined by the actual
     screen size.

Keymap file
     If your installation requires that `term' is to use a custom keymap
     layout, enter the keymap file name here.

     At the time of this writing the program will not support custom
     keymap layouts with the packet window (see PACKET_WINDOW) due to
     operating system limitations.

Use emulation process
     If you are bold and daring you can have an external process handle
     the terminal text output, just turn on this switch. Please note
     that the external process will consume additional memory and text
     throughput speed is likely to suffer with fragmented memory. On
     the other hand the emulation process will relieve the main program
     of the tedious task of having to process the incoming data which.
     This helps the main program to keep up with the incoming data
     stream and makes it less likely that incoming text is lost.

Text font
     The name of the standard or default terminal text display font.
     Please note that this font cannot be proportional-spaced.

IBM PC font
     The name of the font to use if the terminal is in IBM PC mode.
     Please note that this font cannot be proportional-spaced.

Font
     Here the type of the font to be used for text display in the
     terminal window can be selected:

    Standard
          The standard text font selected under the Text font settings
          in this control panel.

    IBM PC style
          A font similar to the IBM PC text font will be used. No
          matter how the translation tables (see TRANSLATION_PANEL) are
          configured, outgoing Amiga characters are translated into PC
          character values. The terminal window will use the font
          selected under the IBM PC font settings in this control panel.

    IBM PC style (raw)
          This selection has very much the same effect as IBM PC style
          but no character translation is performed. The terminal
          window will use the font selected under the IBM PC font
          settings in this control panel.

Send CR
Send LF
     These buttons determine the sequences that are sent to the remote
     if a carriage return (CR) or line feed (LF) character is to be
     transmitted.  Both characters serve as end-of-line indicators.

    -
          The character is suppressed.

    <<CR>>
          A carriage return character is sent.

    <<LF>>
          A line feed character is sent.

    <<CR>><<LF>>
          A sequence of two characters (carriage return followed by
          line feed) is sent.

    <<LF>><<CR>>
          A sequence of two characters (line feed followed by carriage
          return) is sent.

Receive CR
Receive LF
     These two buttons have largely the same effect as the Send CR/LF
     buttons, they are different in that they affect the incoming data
     rather than the data transmitted.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/EMULATION_PANEL

Emulation panel

   The buttons found here allow you to change the internal parameters of
the selected emulation.

   The following text only describes the parameters to change when using
the built-in terminal emulation; if an external terminal emulation is in
effect, this menu will conjure up the corresponding parameters menu as
supported by the external terminal emulation module.

Cursor keys
     If in `applications mode' the cursor keys will cause a command
     sequence to be transmitted instead of a cursor move event. This
     mode is usually activated by special applications on the remote
     side.

Lock cursor key mode
     Certain applications may excessively change the cursor key mode
     from standard to applications mode. If you do not want this to
     happen you can forbid it by using this switch.

Numeric keypad
     If in `applications mode' the numeric keypad will cause a command
     sequence to be transmitted instead of the characters indicated by
     the key labels.  This mode is usually activated by special
     applications on the remote side.

Lock keypad mode
     Certain applications may excessively change the keypad mode from
     standard to applications mode. If you do not want this to happen
     you can forbid it by using this switch.

Swap `Backspace' and `Del' keys
     If this switch is in effect the backspace and delete key codes are
     swapped. This also applies to sequences such as Control + H which
     will produce a delete character instead of a backspace character.

Wrap cursor moves
     According to the VT-100 specifications the cursor movements have
     to stop at the edges of the screen. In spite of this the cursor
     may leave these borders, especially in ANSI-mode, and may appear
     at the other side of the screen. This button activates a more
     `tolerant' mode.

Wrap characters
     This function activates the automatical carriage return function
     which is triggered as soon as the cursor crosses the right screen
     margin. To avoid unpleasant side-effects, this switch should be
     activated all the time.

Lock line wrapping
     If this switch is enabled, any requests to change the end of line
     text wrapping mode will be rejected.

Insert mode
     Normally, `term' is in overwrite-mode (characters entered
     overwrite the contents of the screen). If this gadget is
     activated, typed characters are inserted by pushing all the
     characters right of the cursor towards the right margin.

     The insert-mode does only work for lines. If characters are pushed
     out of the screen they cannot be restored.

New-line mode
     This gadget activates a special mode in which some VT-100 control
     sequences cause `term' to perform a linefeed instead of clearing
     the screen or other serious changes of the contents of the screen.

`CLS' resets cursor position
     As per the VT-100 specs, the control sequence to clear the screen
     is not to change the current cursor position. However, several
     applications expect it to be moved to the top left corner of the
     screen. This button will activate this behaviour.

Printer control enabled
     `term' supports the standard VT-220 printer control commands. If
     you do not want the remote application to play with the printer
     the corresponding support commands can be disabled with this
     switch. If disabled `term' will act like a VT-220 terminal with no
     printer attached.

Lock text style
     If this switch is enabled, any requests to change the text
     rendering attributes (underlined, highlight, blinking, inverse)
     will be rejected.

Lock text colour
     If this switch is enabled, any requests to change the text
     rendering colour will be rejected.

Lock font mode
     If this switch is turned on, any terminal commands to change the
     font scale will be ignored.

Scrolling
     This button selects one of two different scrolling modes: smooth or
     jumping.

Destructive backspace
     Determines if the Backspace code, which will delete the character
     left from the cursor, only moves the cursor to the left or removes
     the character from the screen. Off turns this feature off,
     Overstrike clears the character below the cursor and Shift shifts
     the line contents to the right of the cursor to the left.

Answerback message
     The text to send across the serial line whenever an ENQ character
     is received. The text is - as usual - a command sequence.

Maximum prescroll lines
     This is where you set the maximum number of lines the terminal
     emulation will scroll the screen contents up in one single `jump'.
     This feature is often referred to as `prescroll'.  Note: the data
     throughput rate plays an important part when counting the number
     of lines to scroll. The higher the rate, the more lines will be
     scrolled.

Maximum scroll jump
     Here is where you set the number of lines to move the screen
     contents up when the cursor moves beyond the last terminal screen
     line.

Use standard pens
     The built-in terminal emulation makes use of up to sixteen text
     rendering pens and four text rendering attributes. For each colour
     mode supported (see SCREEN_PANEL) a specific pen order and text
     attribute assignment is predefined. You can select your own pen
     order and attribute assignment if this switch is not enabled by
     pressing the button labeled Edit pens....

Edit pens...
     Pressing this button will open the text pen panel (see
     TEXTPEN_PANEL) which permits editing the drawing pens to use for
     this colour mode.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TEXTPEN_PANEL

Textpen panel

   For each colour mode (monochrome, 4, 8, 16 colours) the terminal
emulation uses a specific order of text pens and text attribute
assignments.  The text pens determine which text rendering colours to
use. The text attribute assignments define how blinking, inverse,
underlined and highlighted text should be displayed. This control panel
is divided into two parts. One part serves to select the text pens, the
other part will let you assign the text attributes. At the left hand
side of each control you will find a label which indicates the
emulation's default value.

   There is a limitation in the number of text colour you can choose.
While there is a colour mode which makes use of 16 colours, only a
maximum of eight colours can be selected. The reason for this
limitation is found in the terminal control commands which allow for
only eight colours (0-7). The remaining eight colours (8-15) are
selected via a text rendering attribute, known as `highlight'.  This
means, if text is to be printed in colour 7 and the highlight text
rendering attribute is enabled the text will be printed in colour 15.
The `highlight' text rendering attribute always has a special meaning.
In all colour modes except 16 it causes text to be output in boldface.

Drawing pens
     Here you select the text drawing pen order to use.

Attributes
     Here you select which text rendering attribute to use instead of
     the default. You can also choose to disable an attribute.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/CLIPBOARD_PANEL

Clipboard panel

Clipboard unit
     The clipboard supports several units (0-255) which can be accessed
     independently. It can make sense to change this value but
     generally you will probably leave it as unit `0'.

Paste prefix
     If enabled, the text to send before the clipboard contents are fed
     into the input stream, see CLIPBOARD.

Paste suffix
     If enabled, the text to send after the clipboard contents are fed
     into the input stream, see CLIPBOARD.

Convert LF to CR
     On the Amiga, new lines end with the LF (line feed) character. To
     simulate typed text, these characters should be converted to CR
     (carriage return characters) when pasting the contents of the
     clipboard. If this switch is enabled, the conversion will take
     place.

Text pacing
     The mode to determine how text is sent to the remote:

    Direct
          Each line will be sent without any delay.

    Wait for echo
          The program will wait for each single character sent to be
          echoed by the remote.

    Wait for any echo
          The program will wait for the remote to return any character
          in response to any character sent. Typically, this is the case
          with password prompts issued by BBSes.

    Wait for line prompt
          The program will wait until the remote sends a certain line
          prompt text.

    Character/line delay
          The program will respect the character/line delay values to
          be set using this control panel.

    Keyboard delay
          The program will send character separated by a delay to be
          determined by the current system keyboard repeat delay.

     Note: the `echo' text pacing modes are to be used with greate
     care. Certain online services do not echo characters back to the
     sender as they run only in half-duplex mode.  On the other hand
     most BBS programs will not echo certain characters, such as escape
     codes, etc.

Character delay
     When sending text this number determines how many seconds to wait
     before sending the next character.

Line delay
     When sending text this number determines how many seconds to wait
     before sending the line-termination character (carriage return).

Line prompt
     The character(s) to wait for the receiver to issue after a line of
     text is send. This text may include command sequence tokens.

Send timeout
     If the Text pacing mode is set to  Wait for echo or Wait for line
     prompt the maximum time to wait for echo/prompt before the
     insertion is aborted.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/CAPTURE_PANEL

Capture panel

Log actions
     If enabled will write a protocol of each program action (uploads,
     downloads, dial attempts, etc.) to a file. Each action is listed
     along with time and date. Carrier-lost events will also note the
     approximate cost of the call. The log file created by this
     function is not intended for postprocessing via call-log file
     analyzers. Use the Log calls feature for this purpose.

Log file
     The name of the file in which the information on the actions
     executed by `term' will be stored if Log actions is enabled.

Log calls
     If this switch is enabled, `term' will create call-log files in a
     format compatible with the CallInfo program. Sometimes this format
     is referred to as `NComm format'.

Call log file
     The name of the file in which the information on calls made by
     `term' will be stored if Log calls is enabled.

Enabled
     This switch works in conjunction with the Freeze buffer menu entry
     (freezing the text buffer contents). In fact, the menu entry is
     adjusted according to the configuration settings whenever a new
     configuration is invoked (that is, whenever a new connection is
     made through the dialing panel or at program startup time). `term'
     will only freeze the buffer if this switch is set, it will leave
     the buffer state (frozen or not) untouched if this switch is not
     enabled.

Maximum size
     To save memory, a high-water mark concerning the maximum amount of
     memory the text buffer (see TEXT_BUFFER) will allocate for text
     may be specified.  The minimum value to be entered here is 2,000
     bytes which are roughly equivalent to two text buffer pages of
     text. A value of 0 will cause the text buffer to always allocate
     as much memory as required to buffer all the incoming text.

File path
     The path the file requester will bring up when saving the contents
     of the text buffer.

Buffer line width
     The text buffer stores lines at a fixed size, this slider
     determines the maximum line width.

Connect-auto-capture
     If enabled will automatically open a capture file after
     successfully making a connection. Any other already open capture
     file will be closed before proceeding. The files created will bear
     the names of the corresponding phonebook entries.

Filter enabled
     If selected, command sequences are filtered out before the incoming
     characters are captured to disk or printer. This makes good sense
     with noisy lines generating random characters which might scare
     your printer. It also produces a text file that is much more
     readable than with all the control sequence codes cluttering up
     the text.

Convert characters
     This switch works in conjunction with the Filter enabled option.
     When using the IBM PC style terminal font, `term' receives
     characters which normally do not have a place in the standard
     Amiga character set. If the Convert characters switch is enabled,
     these characters will be converted into their Amiga equivalents,
     if there are any, before they go into the capture buffer. Note
     that this character conversion is always enabled for text captured
     to the printer.

Creation date
     By default `term' will append the date of the call made to the
     name of the auto-capture file created (Add to name). Alternatively,
     `term' will leave the name untouched and store the creation date
     within the file (Write to file).

File path
     This text gadget contains the path in which the the capture files
     will be created if Connect-auto-capture is enabled.

Open window
     This switch controls which part of the text buffer contents the
     review buffer window will display when opened:

    Top
          Displays the top of the buffer contents.

    End
          Displays the end of the buffer contents.

Remember position
     If this switch is in effect, the program will remember the text
     display position between calls rather than jumping to the top or
     the end of the text buffer.

Open screen
     This switch controls which part of the text buffer contents the
     review buffer screen will display when opened:

    Top
          Displays the top of the buffer contents.

    Remember
          Keeps the previous buffer position.

    End
          Displays the end of the buffer contents.

Remember position
     If this switch is in effect, the program will remember the text
     display position between calls rather than jumping to the top or
     the end of the text buffer.

Screen position
     The buffer screen will usually not be quite as wide as the system
     overscan settings permit. This switch determines the horizontal
     placement of the screen:

    Left
          The screen will be left-edge aligned.

    Centre
          The screen will be centred.

    Right
          The screen will be right-edge aligned. This will bring the
          screen depth arrangement gadget in line with the other
          screens.

Display mode
     This is where you choose the screen display mode the buffer screen
     should use.

Search history size
     The text buffer search function maintains a backlog of all the
     search text entered. The number of texts to remember, before the
     oldest is discarded, can be set using the Search history size
     control. In the search text entry field you can use the Cursor up
     and Cursor down keys to scroll through the previously entered
     search strings.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/COMMAND_PANEL

Command panel

   Here you will find entries for four command sequences which serve
four functions:

Startup command
     At the beginning of every session with `term' and after a
     connection has been established by the dialing routine a
     command-sequence is executed.  Do not use this command for
     auto-login scripts and such, this is what the Login command is
     for. Note that the dialing procedure executes the Startup command
     after the Login command.

Login command
     This command will be executed immediately after the dialing
     procedure has established a connection. You should use this
     command for login scripts and such. Note that the dialing
     procedure first executes the Login command and then the Startup
     command.

Logoff command
     The command to execute when the line is hung up or the carrier
     signal is lost.

Upload command
     `term' will execute this command after a successful upload has
     been made.

Download command
     `term' will execute this command after a successful download has
     been made.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/MISCELLANEOUS_PANEL

Miscellaneous panel

   This is the place where options can be set which would not fit into
other control panels

Backup configuration
     By default the local program configuration saved along with a
     phonebook entry will replace the global configuration as soon as a
     successful connection is made. If this switch is enabled, `term'
     will remember the global configuration in effect before the
     configuration data of a phonebook entry is adopted. As soon as the
     serial driver loses track of the carrier signal or the user
     chooses to hang up the line, `term' will restore the previous
     global configuration.

Show fast! macros
     If this switch is enabled, the fast macro window (see
     FAST_MACRO_PANEL) will be opened whenever the current
     configuration becomes active (e.g. at startup time). Please note
     that if this switch is not enabled, this does not cause the fast
     macro window to be closed.

Release serial device when iconified
     By default the serial device driver is released when `term' is
     iconified. Unfortunately, some modems drop the line when the
     device is closed so this switch allows you to keep the link.

Simple file I/O
     This switch controls whether `term' is to use double-buffered file
     management routines or not.

Create icons
     If this switch is in effect `term' will try to provide icons for
     all files it receives. The following file types (and the
     corresponding icon files) are supported:

    ·Text file
          icon ENV:sys/def_text.info

    ·Sound file
          icon ENV:sys/def_sound.info

    ·Picture file
          icon ENV:sys/def_picture.info

    ·Tool
          icon ENV:sys/def_tool.info

    ·Archive file
          icon ENV:sys/def_archive.info

    ·Preferences file
          icon ENV:sys/def_pref.info

    ·Other file types
          icon ENV:sys/def_project.info

     Text and pictures saved by the program will also get icons
     attached.

Protective mode
     With this switch enabled `term' tries to be nice and will notify
     you in case file/drawer/program names you have entered probably are
     invalid, data was not saved when the program is to be terminated,
     files are about to get overwritten and also if some program
     settings combinations are likely to cause trouble. Some users may
     find this appealing, while some may find it appaling.

Program priority
     Use this slider to determine the priority under which the `term'
     main process is to operate. Adjusting this value can make `term'
     perform more reliably in a system which experiences heavy task
     loading. It is recommended to experiment with this value until a
     satisfactory state is found.  Setting the program priority too
     high or too low may affect the performance of coprocess services
     such as the double-buffered file I/O routines.

I/O buffer size
     This slider controls how much memory the double-buffered file
     management routines will allocate for each buffer. This means a
     value of 4096 bytes will result in an allocation of 8192 bytes in
     total.

Alert
     `term' notifies the user of certain events, such as a connection
     being established or a file transfer action which has just been
     finished.  This switch allows you to select the type of
     notification:

    Bell
          A bell signal will be given.

    Screen
          The `term' screen will be brought to the front.

    Bell & Screen
          A combination of the two actions above.

    None
          Nothing will happen.

    Requester dimensions
          File, font and screen display mode requesters can be made to
          appear at specific positions and in specific sizes on the
          screen. This switch controls how they should appear:
         Ignore
               The default position and size won't be touched.

         Centre
               The requester will be centered within the limits of the
               main window.

         Relative
               The requester will appear at a specific position
               relative to the top left corner of the main window.

    Edit...
          Pressing this button opens a standard file requester,
          prompting you to resize and move the window to a position
          where you want to have it appear the next time it is opened.
          Click on the Use button when finished.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PATH_PANEL

Path panel

   In this part of the settings all paths, which `term' uses to save or
load any data, can be determined.

...Uploadpath
...Downloadpath
     The directories in which the functions contained in the Transfer
     menu will search and create files.

Configuration storage directory
     The directory that will contain all configuration files (phonebook,
     macro keys, etc.). The default configuration file is called
     term.prefs and will be searched in the path defined by the
     enviroment variable TERMCONFIGPATH (see ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES).

Default text editor
     Contains the name and search path of the editor used by Edit &
     upload text file in the transfer menu (see TRANSF.).

`term' help text file
     This is where the name of the online-help text file is stored. By
     default this is PROGDIR:term.guide.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Default (phonebook only)
     Drop the current settings, making a connection to the corresponding
     phone number will leave the corresponding main configuration entry
     unchanged.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TRANSFER_PANEL

Transfer panel

   This is where the protocols to be employed for file transfers are to
be selected. You will also find a handful of additional options here
which one way or the other fit into the cathegory of file transfer
related data.

Override transfer drawer
     Each batch file transfer protocol allows you to specify the name
     of the drawer to place the files it receives in. By default `term'
     will redirect the files to a drawer to be specified in the path
     panel (see PATH_PANEL). If this switch is disabled, the internal
     settings of the current transfer protocol will be used. This may
     cause files to appear (or rather disappear) in the wrong drawers.

Set `archived' bit
     If enabled, this switch will cause `term' to mark files sent as
     archived.

Transfer file icons
     This switch works in conjunction with the drag & upload feature
     (see TRANSFER_PROGRESS_PANEL). By default, `term' will upload only
     the files whose icons are dragged on the main window or found in
     the upload queue. If this switch is in effect the icon files will
     be transferred as well.

Mangle filenames for upload
     Certain transfer protocols running under MS-DOS get into serious
     trouble if told to receive files with names which do not match the
     local naming scheme (8 characters for the name + "." + 3
     characters for the extension). For example, in such situations
     ZModem will restart the file transfer over and over again in a row
     without getting anywhere. To steer clear of trouble you can turn
     on the Mangle filenames for upload switch which will cause the file
     transfer protocol to report `condensed' file names to the remote
     receiver.  A special algorithm will shrink the file names to the
     MS-DOS file name template, clearing potentially dangerous
     character combinations on the fly. This switch has no effect on
     external programs. Note: the algorithm may map two different Amiga
     file names to the same MS-DOS file name, so watch out!

Transfer performance meter
     When a file transfer is running, `term' may optionally display the
     file transfer performance in a small resizable window. The lines
     drawn represent the following information:

    ·Black line
          This line displayes the current transfer performance (usually
          heavily oscillating).

    ·Blue line
          This line displays the average transfer performance.

    ·White line
          This line displays the smallest transfer performance (should
          be constant during the transfer).

Hide upload icon
     The file upload panel can be invoked by double-clicking on the
     corresponding icon placed in the Workbench window (see
     FILE_UPLOAD_PANEL). If you do not want the icon to apear, turn on
     the Hide upload icon switch.

Notify user after <n> errors have occured
     Here you select after how many file transfer errors you want to be
     notified. The errors are counted separately for each file. When the
     given number of errors have accumulated, an error notification
     sound will be played. Setting this value to 0 suppresses this
     feature.

Notify user
     This switch controls when the file transfer window should be
     brought the front and a notification sound should be played:

    only when an error occurs
          The `term' screen and the file transfer window will stay in
          the background until a serious problem occurs.

    when transfer begins/ends
          Screen and window will be brought to the front at the
          beginning and at the end of a transfer.

    when transfer begins
          Screen and window will be brought to the front at the
          beginning of a transfer.

    when transfer ends
          Screen and window will be brought to the front at the end of
          a transfer.

File comment
     This is where the action to perform on downloaded files can be set:

    Ignore
          The file comment will not be touched.

    File type
          The file will be examined and a guess will be made which type
          of file it is. The file comment will be set to the name of
          the file type.

    Source and time
          The current BBS name and the time the file was received are
          placed in the file comment.

Page
     This control panel holds more settings than are visible at first
     glance.  Right below the Page button you will find the invididual
     settings for the default file transfer protocol, the ASCII
     transfer protocol, the text transfer protocol and the binary
     transfer protocol. You can flip the pages by pressing the Page
     button:

    Default transfer protocol
          Select your most often used file transfer protocol here, make
          individual changes to the ASCII, text and binary transfer
          protocols only if you really need them. Most users may never
          need a different transfer protocol than the default protocol.
          The default protocol will also handle automatic invocation of
          downloads if necessary.

         Type
               You can either select XPR library or External program
               here.

               XPR library will use an external transfer protocol
               library, such as xprzmodem.library. This library will be
               kept open all the time and may for example handle
               download session automatically.  For more information on
               how to use XPR libraries see
               DATA_TRANSFER_VIA_XPR_LIBRARY.

               External program will invoke a program when necessary.
               This program has to temporarily take over serial I/O
               processing. Special facilities are available to pass
               parameters such as the name of the device driver `term'
               uses to the program. For more information on how to use
               external programs see DATA_TRANSFER_VIA_EXTERNAL_PROGRAM.

         Name
               This text entry field either holds the name of the XPR
               library to use or the name of the external program.
               Clicking on the select button at the right hand side of
               the text entry field will bring up either a file
               requester or another control panel to select the program
               name and to edit the program parameters.

         Send signature
               Many file transfer protocols transmit characteristic
               data to the remote at the beginning of a transmission.
               This data is called a signature and when found in the
               incoming data stream `term' will automatically invoke
               the protocol in question. This is particularly useful
               with external programs. This text entry field holds the
               signature which will when received start an upload using
               the current default protocol.  For more information on
               protocol signatures see PROTOCOL_SIGNATURES.

         Receive signature
               This text entry field holds the signature which will when
               received start a download using the current default
               protocol.  For more information on protocol signatures
               see PROTOCOL_SIGNATURES.

         Edit settings...
               Press this button to edit the settings of an XPR
               library. For an example of how these settings can look
               like, see XPR_OPTIONS_SAMPLE.

    ASCII transfer protocol
          This is where you set up the transfer protocol that is invoked
          when you select the Upload ASCII file(s) and Download ASCII
          file(s) menu items.

         Type
               You can either select XPR library, External program, <<
               Default >> or Internal here.

               XPR library will use an external transfer protocol
               library, such as xprzmodem.library. This library will be
               kept open all the time and may for example handle
               download session automatically.  For more information on
               how to use XPR libraries see
               DATA_TRANSFER_VIA_XPR_LIBRARY.

               External program will invoke a program when necessary.
               This program has to temporarily take over serial I/O
               processing. Special facilities are available to pass
               parameters such as the name of the device driver `term'
               uses to the program. For more information on how to use
               external programs see DATA_TRANSFER_VIA_EXTERNAL_PROGRAM.

               << Default >> will use the default file transfer
               protocol.

               Internal will use the built-in ASCII transfer protocol.
               For more information see ASCII-TRANSFER_SETTINGS.

         Send
               This text entry field either holds the name of the XPR
               library to use or the name of the external program for
               sending ASCII data. Clicking on the select button at the
               right hand side of the text entry field will bring up
               either a file requester or another control panel to
               select the program name and to edit the program
               parameters.

         Receive
               This text entry field either holds the name of the XPR
               library to use or the name of the external program for
               receiving ASCII data.

         Signature
               Many file transfer protocols transmit characteristic
               data to the remote at the beginning of a transmission.
               This data is called a signature and when found in the

               the protocol in question. This is particularly useful
               with external programs. This text entry field holds the
               signature which will when received start a transfer
               using the current ASCII transfer protocol.  For more
               information on protocol signatures see
               PROTOCOL_SIGNATURES.

               like, see XPR_OPTIONS_SAMPLE.

    Text transfer protocol
          This is where you set up the transfer protocol that is invoked
          when you select the Upload text file(s), Edit & upload text
          file and Download text file(s) menu items.

         Type
               You can either select XPR library, External program or
               << Default >> here.

               XPR library will use an external transfer protocol

               select the program name and to edit the program
               parameters.

         Receive
               This text entry field either holds the name of the XPR
               library to use or the name of the external program for
               receiving textual data.

         Signature
               Many file transfer protocols transmit characteristic
               data to the remote at the beginning of a transmission.
               This data is called a signature and when found in the
               incoming data stream `term' will automatically invoke
               the protocol in question. This is particularly useful
               with external programs. This text entry field holds the
               signature which will when received start a transfer
               using the current text transfer protocol.  For more
               information on protocol signatures see
               PROTOCOL_SIGNATURES.

         Edit settings...
               Press this button to edit the settings of an XPR
               library. For an example of how these settings can look
               like, see XPR_OPTIONS_SAMPLE.

    Binary transfer protocol
          This is where you set up the transfer protocol that is invoked
          when you select the Upload binary file(s) and Download binary
          file(s) menu items.

         Type
               You can either select XPR library, External program or
               << Default >> here.

               XPR library will use an external transfer protocol
               library, such as xprzmodem.library. This library will be
               kept open all the time and may for example handle
               download session automatically.  For more information on
               how to use XPR libraries see
               DATA_TRANSFER_VIA_XPR_LIBRARY.

               External program will invoke a program when necessary.
               This program has to temporarily take over serial I/O
               processing. Special facilities are available to pass
               parameters such as the name of the device driver `term'
               uses to the program. For more information on how to use
               external programs see DATA_TRANSFER_VIA_EXTERNAL_PROGRAM.

               << Default >> will use the default file transfer
               protocol.

         Send
               This text entry field either holds the name of the XPR
               library to use or the name of the external program for
               sending binary data. Clicking on the select button at
               the right hand side of the text entry field will bring
               up either a file requester or another control panel to
               select the program name and to edit the program
               parameters.

         Receive
               This text entry field either holds the name of the XPR
               library to use or the name of the external program for
               receiving binary data.

* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/XPR_OPTIONS_SAMPLE

XPR options sample

   You will find an excerpt of the xprzmodem.doc documentation file for
the ZModem file transfer protocol below which is the default transfer
protocol `term' is shipped with. Please note that other file transfer
protocols will sport different options and controls, you should consult
the corresponding documentation for more information.

Text translation mode:
    Y = Text Yes
          If receiving, translate CR/LF pairs or solo CR chars to
          normal Amiga LF chars.  Ignore data past ^Z. If sending,
          suggests to receiver that they should receive this file in
          text mode.

    N = Text No
          Receive file verbatim, without changes.  If sending, suggest
          to receiver that they receive this file verbatim, without
          translations.

    ? = Text status unknown
          If receiving, use sender's suggestion as to whether to do end
          of line translations or not. If sending, tell receiver to use
          default mode, since we don't know either.

    C = Text mode set by Comm program
          The library asks the communications program whether or not to
          use Text mode for each file. If the communications program
          does not support the necessary xpr_finfo() call, or if the
          call fails, this option acts like T?.  From the user's point
          of view, what this option normally does is set the Text mode
          to match the communications program's built-in
          text/binary/end-of-line/translation mode, if any.

Overwrite mode:
    Y = Overwrite Yes
          If about to receive file with same name as one which already
          exists, delete the old file and receive the new file in its
          place.

    N = Overwrite No
          If about to receive file with same name as one which already
          exists, append ".dup" onto the name of the new file to keep
          them separate.

    R = Overwrite Resume
          If about to receive file with same name as one which already
          exists, resume receiving file data from the current end of
          the existing file.

    S = Overwrite Skip
          If about to receive file with same name as one which already
          exists, skip this file, we don't want it.  Batch transfers
          will move on to the next file in the set, if any.

Buffer size:
     xprzmodem.library adds a layer of file I/O buffering in addition
     to whatever the comm program may or may not provide.  This option
     sets the size of XPRZModem's file I/O buffer in kilobytes.  The
     minimum value is 1 KB, for those using RAM drives or fast hard
     drives, or those whose comm programs already provide sufficient
     buffering.  The maximum value is as much contiguous RAM as you
     have available in your Amiga.  If you specify more than is
     actually available, XPRZModem will keep decrementing the buffer
     size requested by 1 KB until the memory allocation works.  That
     way, if your RAM is too fragmented to use the amount you request,
     XPRZModem simply uses the largest block available.  Buffering is
     especially helpful for floppy drive users; it keeps your drive from
     continuously gronking and slowing things down all through the
     transfer.

     Additional note for `term' users: this option is practically
     replaced by the I/O buffer size settings in the miscellaneous
     panel (see MISCELLANEOUS_PANEL).

Frame size:
     Although normally avoided, ZModem has the ability to require an
     ACK to be sent from the receiver to the sender every X-many data
     bytes.  Normally you don't want to use this feature, because not
     waiting for ACKs is part of how ZModem works so fast.  However,
     this feature can be very useful in conjunction with file I/O
     buffering on slow devices (namely those floppy drives).  If you
     set up a large I/O buffer to avoid gronking your floppy so often,
     you'll find that when the buffer finally does get around to being
     flushed that it can take a looonng time; so long, in fact, that
     the delay can cause timeouts and errors.  But if you set your
     ZModem to require the sender to wait for an ACK every
     buffer's-worth of data, the sender will politely wait for you to
     flush your buffer to the slow floppy and send it an ACK saying
     it's OK to continue now.  This value should be set to 0 to disable
     ACKs (normal mode), or set it to the actual number of data bytes
     allowed between ACKs.  For example, if you set the Buffer size to
     64KB because of your floppy, you should also set the Frame size to
     65536 bytes.

Error limit:
     This allows you to set the number of sequential errors which will
     be required to convince ZModem to abort the transfer.  The normal
     value is 10, meaning that 10 errors must happen in a row with no
     valid data being transferred in order to cause an abort.  This
     setting is provided for those using XPRZModem with a BBS, who may
     wish to use a relaxed setting, or those with really lousy phone
     lines who are desperate and patient enough to want the transfer to
     continue in spite of horrible performance.

Auto-activate mode:
    Y = Auto-activate Yes
          If the comm program supports the ability, the library will
          automatically go into receive mode when the start of a ZModem
          download is detected.

    N = Auto-activate No
          Don't try to automatically start downloading, make the user
          activate it.

Delete after sending:
    Y = Delete Yes
          Delete each file after it has been Successfully sent.

    N = Delete No
          Don't delete files after sending them.

Keep partial files:
    Y = Keep Yes
          Keep the fragment of a file received so far if file reception
          is aborted.  This allows you to use the Overwrite Resume
          option above to pick up where you left off on your next
          attempt.

    N = Keep No
          Delete any partially-received file after an aborted transfer.

Send full directory path:
    Send path Yes
          Send full filenames including directory path to receiver.

    Send path No
          Send only simple filenames, not including directory path.

Default received path:
     Store all received files in this directory, if option "Use
     received path" is not checked.  Ignored entry if option Use
     received path is checked.  The path can be any valid existing
     directory, with or without trailing / (e.g. df0:, Comm:hold, etc.).

     Additional note for `term' users: the default received path option
     is ignored if the Override transfer path switch in the
     miscellaneous panel (see MISCELLANEOUS_PANEL) is enabled.

   You will also find the familiar Use and Cancel buttons here which
will either keep or discard the changes you made to the settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TRANSLATION_PANEL

Translation panel

   `term' is capable of replacing any incoming and outgoing character
with custom text. This may come in handy with the numerous incarnations
of the dreaded IBM PC font. The control panel to be opened features a
large list of buttons, each single one representing a single character.
Some characters are shown with their corresponding glyphs, some with
their symbolic names and some as plain numbers. Clicking on one of the
buttons will bring up a control panel which allows setting the text to
be received by the terminal emulation when a certain character is
received and the text to be sent when a certain characters is
transmitted. Alternatively, you can press the key combination
corresponding to the character whose translation you wish to change.

   Both receive and send translation texts can consist of standard
command sequences (see COMMAND_SEQUENCES), except for the following
commands which are not supported:  \a, \c, \d, \g, \i, \p, \u and \x.

   Please note that the translation does not come for free, terminal
input and output speed may suffer.

   As of this writing only a few translation table files (see below) are
included in the distribution. If you wish to create translation tables
for IBM doorway mode, national IBM PC style font variants, etc. feel
free to send them to me. I will try to include them in the next `term'
release.

   Currently included in the `term' distribution are the following
translation table files:

ISO-4-(GB).prefs
     British 7 bit (ISO code 4) character set.

ISO-10-(S).prefs
     Swedish 7 bit (ISO code 10) character set.

ISO-11-(S).prefs
     Swedish 7 bit (ISO code 11) character set.

ISO-15-(I).prefs
     Italian 7 bit (ISO code 15) character set.

ISO-16-(P).prefs
     Portuguese 7 bit (ISO code 16) character set.

ISO-17-(E).prefs
     Spanish 7 bit (ISO code 17) character set.

ISO-21-(D).prefs
     German 7 bit (ISO code 21) character set.

ISO-60-(N).prefs
     Norwegian 7 bit (ISO code 60) character set.

ISO-61-(N).prefs
     Norwegian 7 bit (ISO code 61) character set.

ISO-69-(F).prefs
     French 7 bit (ISO code 69) character set.

PC-8.prefs
     Character translation for standard IBM PC style font. If you wish
     to use these translation tables, make sure to set the Font type in
     the terminal panel (see TERMINAL_PANEL) to IBM PC style (raw).

   Unfortunately, there is no translation available for the Norwegian
and Danish variants of the PC-8 character set as I do not yet have a
fitting Amiga font available. Similar reasons have yet prevented to
implement PC-850 character set support.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/FUNCTION_KEY_PANEL

Function key panel

   This control panel allows setting user definable texts for all ten
function keys. All texts are considered command sequences (see
COMMAND_SEQUENCES), a topic which will be covered later in this
document.

Modifier
     All in all 40 keys may be covered with user defined command
     sequences (COMMAND_SEQUENCES). As the Amiga keyboard only has ten
     function-keys this button switches between the modifier keys
     (Shift, Control, Alt) which, if pressed in addition which
     a function key, will execute one of the 40 command sequences.

Load
     Load the function key settings from a file.

Save
     Save the function key settings to a file.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.

   As the definition of the function keys with command sequences
contradicts the standard definition of the four functions keys of a
VT-100 terminal, the keys F1-F4, which may be executed by pressing the
Shift key and the approriate function-key simultaneously, are mapped to
the standard sequences for function-keys.  The user may - of course -
change these settings.

   If an external terminal emulation happens to be active, those
function keys the emulation has allocated for itself will be disabled
and cannot be edited.

   The traditional VT-100 PF-keys (programmable function keys) are
mapped to the top row of the numeric keypad. Hold down the Control key
and press a top row key to produce the corresponding PF key code.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/CURSOR_KEY_PANEL

Cursor key panel

   This control panel both works and looks similar to the function key
panel (see FUNCTION_KEY_PANEL), the only difference is that it is to
assign command sequences to the cursor keys rather than to the function
keys. Displayed are the assignments for all four cursor keys and the
following buttons:

Modifier
     Any cursor key can be pressed along with one of the modifier keys
     (Shift, Control, Alt). This button will switch between the
     different assignments.

Load
     Load the cursor key settings from a file.

Save
     Save the cursor key settings to a file.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.
