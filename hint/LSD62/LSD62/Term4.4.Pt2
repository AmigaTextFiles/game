* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/FAST_MACRO_PANEL

Fast macro panel

   The design and implementation of the settings to be configured in
this menu are closely related to the menu entry function key panel (see
FUNCTION_KEY_PANEL) discussed before. The only difference to be seen in
the fact that the fast! macros are mapped to buttons rather than
function keys (more on this topic later in this document, see
FAST!_MACROS).

Macro list
     The list of macros entered yet, to edit one of these, select it by
     clicking the mouse button with the mouse pointer on it.

Macro
     The name of a macro by which it is listed in the fast! macro list.

Macro text
     The command sequence (see COMMAND_SEQUENCES) associated with a
     fast! macro. Command sequences are discussed later in this
     document.

New
     Appends a new macro to the list. The user may then select and
     customize it.

Remove
     Removes the currently selected macro from the list.

Clear
     Removes all the macros from list, clearing it.

Load
     Loads the macro list from a file.

Save
     Saves the macro list to a file.

|<
     Places the currently selected macro at the top of the list.

<
     Moves the currently selected macro one entry up.

>
     Moves the currently selected macro one entry down.

>|
     Places the currently selected macro at the end of the list.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/HOTKEY_PANEL

Hotkey panel

   This is where the key sequences used to arrange screens and to
execute special functions are to be configured.

term screen to front
     The keys to press to bring the `term' screen to the front.

Buffer screen to front
     The keys to press to bring the screen of the text buffer to the
     front.

Skip dial entry
     As an alternative to the Skip button, pressing these keys will
     skip a dialing entry if the dialing function is currently active.

Stop ARexx command
     An ARexx script started from within `term' can be aborted by
     pressing these keys. Use this function only if pressing Control +
     C does not stop the program execution.

Commodity priority
     The commodity priority to assign this task to. You may want to
     change this value if you have more than one program running which
     uses the same key sequences as `term'. The program with the higher
     commodity priority will receive the keystrokes first.

Hotkeys enabled
     Whether the hotkeys are enabled or not can be toggled by clicking
     on this button, or by using the Exchange program to be found in the
     Tools/Commodities drawer.

Load
     Loads the hotkey settings from a file.

Save
     Saves the hotkey settings to a file.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Cancel
     Keep the original settings.

   `term' will refuse to accept invalid keyword combinations. You will
be notified by a brief screen flash/bell signal and the cursor will
reappear in the text entry field whose contents are rejected.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/SPEECH_PANEL

Speech panel

   If enabled, the Amiga speech synthesizer will be used to alert the
user of certain actions, such as carrier lost, connection made, etc.
This feature makes sense if `term' is running in the background where
the user cannot see what is actually happening on the main screen. By
default this feature is disabled.

   Note: speech synthesis is no longer available since Workbench v2.1
was introdured!

Rate (words/minute)
     Speaking speed in words per minute.

Pitch (Hz)
     The greater this value, the higher the voice appears to be
     speaking.

Frequency (Hz)
     Voice frequency in Hertz.

Volume
     The volume of the voice in percent.

Sex
     Enabled female or male voice.

Speech enabled
     Toggles the activity of the speech synthesizer.

Speak!
     Speaks a small sample text, note that speech must be enabled for
     this function to work.

Load
     Loads the speech settings from a file.

Save
     Saves the speech settings to a file.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Cancel
     Keep the original settings.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/SOUND_PANEL

Sound panel

   As an option `term' will associate sounds with special program
functions and events. This is where the sounds are configured:

Terminal bell sound
     The sound to be played whenever a BEL character is output on the
     terminal screen.

`Connect' sound
     The sound to be played when a connection is established.

`Disconnect' sound
     The sound to be played when a connection is lost.

`File transfer finished' sound
     The sound to be played when a file transfer is finished
     successfully.

`File transfer failed' sound
     The sound to be played when a file transfer is finished
     unsuccessfully.

Modem `ring' sound
     The sound to be played when the modem detects a call by a
     different modem.

Modem `voice' sound
     The sound to be played when the modem detects a phone call.

Error sound
     The sound to be played when a number of file transfer errors have
     occured (see TRANSFER_PANEL).

Volume
     This slider affects the volume of all sounds produced by `term'.
     Setting it to zero suppresses sound output.

Preload sound files
     If this switch is enabled `term' will load all sound files
     immediately rather than accessing and loading them on demand. This
     may save access time when a sound is to be played but may eat up
     precious memory.

Load
     Load the sound settings from a file.

Save
     Save the sound settings to a file.

Use
     Use the current settings.

Cancel
     Keep the old settings.

   There is no fixed size limit to sound files, the amount of available
system memory matters. The sound files may be compressed, mono or
stereo files.

   As of Workbench 2.04 `term' will only load plain IFF-8SVX format
sound files. With Workbench 3.x any sound file can be loaded for which
there exists a datatypes class. Please note that due to an operating
system bug sound files larger than 102,400 bytes will not play
correctly under Workbench 3.0.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TRANSFER_PROGRESS_PANEL

Transfer progress panel

   The transfer routines open an information window in which a number of
transfer parameters are displayed. Additionally, the file transfer can
be aborted by clicking either of the three buttons (Stop entire
transfer, Skip current file or Stop transfer batch).  For most
transfer protocols all buttons have the same effect. Consult the
documentation to see if different levels of abort are supported by your
favourite transfer protocol.

   The following information is displayed in the transfer window:

Protocol
     The name of the transfer protocol currently running.

Information
     A list to contain error message, the names files transferred and
     miscellaneous other messages addressed to the user. Error messages
     are printed in a special colour.

File
     The name of the file being transferred.

Next file
     The name of the next file to be sent.

Space left
     The space left on the destination device. `term' will try to
     calculate the number of blocks the file being received will take
     on the destination device and display a warning the file in
     question is probably not going to fit.

     Caution: `term' only makes a very likely guess which may or may not
     come true. The guess may be wrong if the destination device
     happens to be a kind of Ram-Disk which shrinks and expands as
     memory requirements come and go. Such devices are usually 100%
     full. In most other cases you will probably be able to make room
     for the file being received before any space problem turns up.

Completion time
     If the corresponding information is available, the point of time
     when the current file will be transferred completely.

File size
     If available, the size of the file.

Bytes xfered
     Number of bytes transferred yet.

Total size
     The total size of all files to be transferred.

Total bytes xfered
     The total number of bytes transferred yet.

Files xfered
     The number of files transferred yet and the number of files to go.

Blocks xfered
     Number of data blocks transferred yet.

Characters/second
     The effective transfer speed in characters per second.

Character delay
     The delay between two character being sent.

Packet delay
     The delay between two packets being sent.

Packet type
     A short description of the data block type employed for data
     transfer.

Block check type
     The method employed to verify the integrity of the data blocks
     being transferred (this usually is a form of cyclic redundancy
     checking).

Block size
     Size of a data block in bytes.

Expected time
     The time the transfer protocol expects the transfer will take.

Elapsed time
     The time elapsed during transfer.

Number of errors
     The number of errors occured during file transfer.

Number of timeouts
     The number of timeouts occured during file transfer.

   If the currently active transfer protocol provides the necessary
information, two bars will be displayed at the bottom of the transfer
window indicating the amount of transferred data and of time to go
before the transfer is finished.

   `term' knows about the Z-Modem data-inquiry sequence the remote
receiver issues when expecting files. If recognized, this sequence will
cause `term' to display a requester asking for the type of data upload:
text or binary. One could call this feature `auto upload'. You also have
the opportunity to select Abort which will transfer the ZModem abort
sequence or to click on the Ignore gadget which will plainly ignore the
fact that the ZModem inquiry sequence has been recognized.  The Z-Modem
abort sequence will also be transferred if you select the Cancel button
in the file requester to appear after selecting text- or binary-upload.
If the Upload from queue option is in effect the contents of the
transfer queue will be uploaded.

   Some transfer protocols will allow you to enter a default receive
path the library is supposed to create files it receives in. On request
(see MISCELLANEOUS_PANEL) `term' will ignore these settings and use the
settings to be changed in the Settings/Paths (see PATH_PANEL) menu
instead.

   Each file that is received and which does not remain empty is
examined briefly to find out about the file type. If recognized
successfully and the corresponding feature is enabled, a small comment
indicating the file type will be attached to the file. `term' currently
knows about 83 different file types.

   If the `term' main window is opened on the Workbench screen, you can
select and drag icons on it in order to upload the corresponding files.
A requester will be opened to ask for the upload style (either binary or
text).

   In case a file transfer terminates with an unrecoverable error
(note:  the transfer protocol is responsible for reporting error
conditions to `term') the file transfer window will stay open until
explicitly closed by the user so the transfer error report list can be
viewed.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/ASCII-TRANSFER_PANEL

ASCII-transfer panel

   The built-in ASCII transfer routines as to be enabled in the
transfer panel (see TRANSFER_PANEL) display transfer progress
information in a special window (note that sending and receiving will
open different windows). Here is a description of the controls and
displays:

Bytes xfered
     The number of bytes sent/received.

Lines xfered
     The number of text lines sent/received.

Information
     Transfer progress information and error display.

Character delay
     When sending text this number determines how many seconds to wait
     before sending the next character.

Line delay
     When sending text this number determines how many seconds to wait
     before sending the line-termination character (carriage return).

Text pacing
     The mode to determine how text is sent to the remote:

    Direct
          Each line will be sent without any delay.

    Wait for echo
          The program will wait for each single character sent to be
          echoed by the remote.

    Wait for any echo
          The program will wait for the remote to return any character
          in response to any character sent. Typically, this is the case
          with password prompts issued by BBSes.

    Wait for line prompt
          The program will wait until the remote sends a certain line
          prompt text.

    Character/line delay
          The program will respect the character/line delay values to
          be set using this control panel.

    Keyboard delay
          The program will send character separated by a delay to be
          determined by the current system keyboard repeat delay.

     Note: the `echo' text pacing modes are to be used with greate
     care. Certain online services do not echo characters back to the
     sender as they run only in half-duplex mode.  On the other hand
     most mailbox programs will not echo certain characters, such as
     escape codes, etc.

Quiet transfer
     This switch controls whether incoming text will be displayed in the
     terminal window. You may want to watch how the remote responds to
     the data sent/received.

Skip current file
     Stops sending the current file and proceeds to the next.

Stop entire transfer
     Stops the ASCII data transfer.

   In case a file transfer terminates with an unrecoverable error the
file transfer window will stay open until explicitly closed by the user
so the transfer error report list can be viewed.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/ASCII-TRANSFER_SETTINGS

ASCII-transfer settings

Text pacing
     The mode to determine how text is sent to the remote:

    Direct
          Each line will be sent without any delay.

Character delay
     When sending text this number determines how many seconds to wait
     before sending the next character.

Line delay
     When sending text this number determines how many seconds to wait
     before sending the line-termination character (carriage return).

Line prompt
     The character to wait for the receiver to issue after a line of
     text is send. These character may include command sequence tokens.

Send timeout
     If the Text pacing mode is set to  Wait for echo or Wait for line
     prompt the maximum time to wait for echo/prompt before the
     insertion is aborted.

Send CR
Send LF
     These buttons determine the sequences that are sent to the remote
     if a carriage return (CR) or line feed (LF) character is to be
     transmitted.  Both characters serve as end-of-line indicators.

    -
          The character is suppressed.

    <<CR>>
          A carriage return character is sent.

    <<LF>>
          A line feed character is sent.

    <<CR>><<LF>>
          A sequence of two characters (carriage return followed by
          line feed) is sent.

    <<LF>><<CR>>
          A sequence of two characters (line feed followed by carriage
          return) is sent.

Receive CR
Receive LF
     These two buttons have largely the same effect as the Send CR/LF
     buttons, they are different in that they affect the incoming data
     rather than the data transmitted.

Ignore data past terminator
     With this option enabled the receiver will search for a
     termination character in the incoming data stream. If this
     character is found the transfer will be terminated.

Terminator character
     Enter the ASCII code of the terminator character to be used for
     the Ignore data past terminator feature here.

Quiet ASCII transfer
     If this switch is not enabled, the built-in ASCII upload/download
     routines will display the outgoing/incoming data in the terminal
     window. This option is to let you watch the progress of the file
     transfer, so that, for example, if the remote does not respond to
     the data you send, you may want to stop and restart the upload.

Strip bit 8
     If this switch is effect each character received or transmitted by
     `term' will have its high-order bit cleared.

   With ASCII uploads it is important to make sure that end-of-line
characters such as carriage return and line feed are properly set up
for the remote.  While on the Amiga it is common to end a line of text
with a line feed character, most editors and such expect a carriage
return character to be transferred. This can easily be arranged by
setting the Send LF switch to <<CR>>.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PHONEBOOK

Phonebook

   The functions described in the following can be found in the Modem
menu and relate to the menu entries Phonebook, Dial and Redial.

   `term' is equipped with a telephone number management system, the
phonebook, which is described in the following lines.

Name list
     The names of all phonebook entries are displayed here.

Name
     Name of the last selected telephonebook entry.

Comment
     A comment to associate with a phonebook entry.

Phone number(s)
     The telephone number(s) of the last selected telephonebook entry.

     If a system supports multiple lines, the phone number of each line
     may be entered, each one separated by a vertical bar | character
     (example: 123456|654321 would cause the dialing routine to dial
     the numbers 123456 and 654321). The dialing routine will process
     all these phone numbers before proceeding to the next phonebook
     entry.

     The | character also works for the modem init, modem exit and dial
     prefix sequences. Whenever the dialing routine dials another phone
     number from a list separated by bars, it will try to find a
     matching init/exit/dial prefix sequence. If more phone numbers are
     specified than sequences are available, it will use the last
     sequence given (an example:  a phone number may be given as
     123456|654321|12345, the dial prefix text may be ATDP|ATDT; the
     dialing routine will call the first number using ATDP123456, the
     second number using ATDT654321 and the third number, since no
     special dial prefix is available, again using ATDT12345).

     Note: if you do not enter a phone number you will be unable to use
     the entry for dialing.

Quick menu
     If this switch is in effect, the corresponding phonebook entry will
     be put into the quick dialing menu (see at the right hand side of
     the main menu). Selecting the menu entry will dial the
     corresponding phone number. Note: only up to 50 phone numbers can
     be put into the list.

New
     Generates a new telephonebook entry with standard settings and
     places it at the end of the telephonebook.

Clone
     Will duplicate the currently selected phonebook entry and place it
     at the end of the list.

Remove
     Removes the last selected telephonebook entry from the
     telephonebook and frees the memory allocated for this entry.

Copy cfg.
     A lot of time can be saved by copying selected parts of the global
     configuration to a local configuration which is part of a phonebook
     entry. Selecting this button will invoke a control panel which
     allows to select which parts of the global configuration should be
     copied. The control panel also remembers which parts were copied
     when it was invoked the last time, see COPY_PANEL for more
     information.

Use
     Takes over the local configuration settings saved with the
     currently selected phonebook entry. Also installed are the
     associated password and user name entries.

Tag
     Tags the currently selected phonebook entry for inclusion in the
     dialing list. Pressing the Space key toggles the selection.

Untag
     Removes the currently selected phonebook entry from the dialing
     list. Pressing the Space key toggles the selection. Press the Del
     key to untag the currently selected phonebook entry.

Tag all
     Includes all phonebook entries in the dialing list.

Toggle all
     Adds all phonebook entries that are not in the dialing list to the
     dialing list and removes all entries from it that are already in
     it.

Untag all
     Removes all phonebook entries from the dialing list. Press
     Shift+Del to untag all entries.

Load
     Loads the contents of a telephonebook from a file.

Save
     Saves the contents of a telephonebook to a file.

Print
     This button will cause another control panel window to be opened,
     see PRINTING_PANEL for more information.

Sort
     If any phonebook entries have been selected to be dialled, the
     phonebook entries will be sorted in the order of dialing. The
     remaining phonebook entries will be sorted in ascending
     alphabetical order.

Password
     Press this button if you wish to save a special access password
     with the currently active telephonebook file. You will then be
     asked to enter the password. What you type will not appear on the
     screen.

     To clear an existant password and to save the phonebook file
     without encryption, just press return when asked to enter the new
     password.

     The next time you save the phonebook data, the password will be
     encrypted and saved with it, the phonebook data itself will be
     encrypted using the password.

     Whenever an encrypted phonebook file is loaded, it will take
     longer to load than an ordinary phonebook file, the same applies to
     saving phonebook data.

Dial
     Will pass the list of currently marked phonebook entries to the
     dialing routine.

     Note: phonebook entries which lack a phone number will not be
     entered into the dialing list.

   Another list is located at the right hand side of the window. Each
entry refers to a control panel to be invoked on the currently selected
phonebook entry.

          With Translations, Function keys, Cursor keys and Fast!
          macros the data will be loaded from the corresponding
          files allowing you to edit it. `term' will remember the names
          of the settings files data is read from or is written to. You
          can change the name directly by holding down a shift key when
          clicking on Translations, Function keys, Cursor keys or Fast!
          macros.

    User/Password
          This entry will open a control panel in which the password
          and user name to be used for the current phonebook entry can
          be entered. Both password and name are made available from
          within the `term' ARexx interface to allow auto login script
          files to set up a connection.

    Rates
          `term' will count the minutes you are online and connected to
          a BBS as soon as a connection is made through the dialing
          routine. This entry opens a control panel which allows
          setting the necessary data (see RATE_PANEL).

   If you are still online, the Dial button will be disabled. In order
to make another call hang up the line first.

   To put a phonebook entry into the dialing list, shift-click (i.e.
hold down either shift key, then click once on the list entry) its
name. The number appearing to the left of its name indicates the
precedence of entries in the dialing list. To remove an entry from the
list, shift-click it again. Instead of shift-clicking on an entry, the
space bar may be pressed as well.

   Double-clicking on a name will immediately dial the selected entry.

   To dial the list of selected entries, press the Dial button, control
will be passed over to the dialing panel.

   As I have been asked several times:  For dialing a telephone number
the dialing prefix specified for this telephone number is used. If the
MNP-error correction for a certain mailbox has to be specifically
switched on via the dial text, this has to be done in the modem
settings for this mailbox and not in the global settings of `term'. The
Modem init and Modem exit command entries of the phonebook can also be
used for initialization.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/RATE_PANEL

Rate panel

   `term' will count the minutes you are online and connected to a BBS
as soon as a connection is made through the dialing routine. As soon as
the connection is lost or you hang up, `term' will use the information
to be specified in this control panel to calculate the amount of money
to be paid for the call.

Pay/unit
     The amount of money to be paid for each single time unit when
     online.  This fee must be given in the smallest currency unit
     available (pence, cents, centimes, etc.).

Sec./unit
     This is where you enter how many seconds each time unit lasts.

   There are two different groups of the two entries listed above
available:  one for the first unit and one for all following units. So,
if you only pay for the call you make but not for the time you spend
making it, just enter the fee in the first group and set the second
group to zero.

Days and dates
     This list contains the default rate settings and exceptions for
     certain dates and days of the week. Each line displays the type of
     the entry and a comment (separated by the `>>' character). The
     following types are available:

    Day(s)
          Settings for certain days of the week

    12. Jan (example)
          Settings for a specific date

     If there is no special type available for an entry, it's probably
     the default settings you are dealing with. These settings are used
     whenever `term' cannot find an entry for the current day.

   For each entry in this list there is at least one associated starting
time available which defines when the associated rate settings are to be
used. You will find the time settings in the list titled Time. To add a
new time use the Add button. To edit an existing entry use the Edit
button. To remove an entry, press the Remove button.

Add date
     Will invoke a control panel to create a new rate entry to be used
     on a specific date. Use the sliders and button to select the day
     the settings will be valid for.

Add day(s)
     Will create a new rate entry referring to one or more days of the
     week.  Use the buttons of the control panel to select the days the
     current settings will be valid for.

Import
     Much work can be saved if the rate settings for the current
     phonebook entry are imported (or copied) from a different
     phonebook entry. To do so, select this button. The control panel
     to be opened will display the list of phonebook entries available
     and three buttons:

    Replace rates
          The rate settings of the current phonebook entry will be
          replaced by the settings of the selected entry.

    Append rates
          The rate settings of the selected entry will be appended to
          the current phonebook entry.

    Cancel
          Will abort the selection.

   Whenever a rate entry is selected, the corresponding parameters
(Pay/unit and Sec./unit) can be edited. If the entry refers to a
certain date or a specific day of week three additional buttons are
made available:

Edit
     Just as the labels says, will allow you to modify an entry after
     it has been created.

Clone
     Will duplicate the current rate entry and append it to the list.

Remove
     Removes an entry from the list.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/COPY_PANEL

Copy panel

   This control panel allows you to select which parts of the global
configuration to copy into the currently selected phonebook entry.

To all entries
     The selected parts will be copied to all phonebook entries. If any
     phonebook entries are selected when this action is to be performed,
     only the selected entries will be affected.

Copy
     This is where you select from which source the configuration
     information will be copied:

    Global configuration
          Parts of the currently active global configuration will be
          copied.

    Defaults
          When going online, instead of overriding the currently active
          global configuration with the supplied local phonebook
          configuration the corresponding global configuration will be
          left unchanged.

Select all
     Selects all parts.

Clear all
     Clears the current selection.

Use
     Copies the selected items.

Cancel
     The window is closed, no items are copied.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/DIAL_PANEL

Dial panel

   The following information about the dialing process is displayed:

Calling
     The name of the telephonebook entry belonging to the number being
     dialled. If it is just a telephone number the text << Unknown >>
     is shown, indicatinging that the name of the BBS is unknown.

Comment
     This is where the comment corresponding to the current dialing list
     entry is displayed.

Number
     The telephone number being dialed or just dialed.

Next
     The name of the phonebook entry which will be processed next if no
     connection is established. If no further entry exists, "-" will be
     displayed.

Timeout
     A counter which is decreased every second and which reflects the
     time remaining to establish a connection or to cycle through the
     dial queue again.

Attempt
     This field shows the number of unsuccessful cycles made through the
     dialing queue to establish a connection.

Message
     A message to the user. This can be:

    Dialing...
          A dial is in process.

    Line is busy.
          The dialed number is engaged.

    Incoming call!
          The modem has been called from another modem.

    Incoming voice call!
          The modem is receiving a call which was not originated by
          another modem.

    No dialtone detected!
          The modem was unable to detect any dialing tone on the line,
          it may possibly be not connected.

    Connection established.
          Just as the name says...

    Maximum number of dial retries reached!
          Just as the name says...

    Dial attempt timeout.
          The time available to establish a connection has been reached
          or exceeded.

    Redial Delay...
          Pause until the next cycle through the dialing queue.

   Additionally, the following controls are available:

Skip
     With this function the current dialing attempt is cancelled and
     the next number is processed. If no succeeding telephone number
     exists `term' waits for the next cycle through the dial queue or
     until Skip call is pressed again.

     There also is a hotkey combination available to accomplish the same
     task.

Remove
     This button works in part similar to the Skip call button.
     Additionally, it removes the current phonebook entry from the
     dialing list.

Go to online
     If the line is very noisy, the connection to a mailbox may have
     been made, but the CONNECT text may be got lost. Pressing this
     button will cause `term' to assume that the modem is in fact
     online now, start the rates accounting and return you to the main
     window.

Stop dialing
     Operation of this button exits the dial queue (leaving the the dial
     queue intact) and ends the dialing process.

Start script recording on connection
     As soon as the connection is establish `term' will start recording
     incoming text and your responses to it, thus making it possible to
     create auto-login scripts and such. For more information on this
     topic see SCRIPT_RECORDING.

   If a connection is successfully made the corresponding entry in the
dial queue will be removed.

   Selecting the close gadget will close the window and cause the phone
book panel to be reopened.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PRINTING_PANEL

Printing panel

   This control panel is part of the phonebook. It is opened whenever
the Print button is selected and allows for setting the output options.

Output file or device
     This is where you enter the name of the file or device (such as
     PRT:) the phonebook printout is to be sent to.

Plain text
     If enabled only the plain and bare information text will be
     printed, else text attribute control sequences will be sent as
     well.

Include...
     Each switch determines whether the corresponding phonebook entry
     information will be included in the printout.

Use
     Will start printing the phonebook contents.

Cancel
     Returns to the phonebook.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TRAP_PANEL

Trap panel

   By default `term' scans the input data stream for a set of special
character sequences, such as NO CARRIER, RING and VOICE, depending on
how your modem settings (see MODEM_PANEL) are set up. The trap panel
permits adding custom character sequences which if found cause `term'
to execute the corresponding command sequences (see COMMAND_SEQUENCES).
This makes it possible to write auto-login procedures by just adding
traps for the user name and password prompts. For example, suppose your
BBS prompts you to enter your user name with the text User name: and to
enter your password with the text Password:. You would create two trap
entries, one with User name: as the sequence and \\u\\r as the command
and one with Password: as the sequence and \\p\\r as the command.
Provided the phonebook entry is set up correctly (see PHONEBOOK,
User/Password) connecting to the system will log you in `automatically'.

   The trap settings editor consists of the following controls:

Trap list
     This list contains all the trap sequences `term' knows.

Sequence
     This text entry field contains the currently selected sequence.

Command
     This text entry field contains the command sequence (see
     COMMAND_SEQUENCES) to be executed when the corresponding trap
     sequence is found.

|<
     Move the currently selected entry to the beginning of the list.

     Move the currently selected entry up in the list.

>
     Move the currently selected entry down in the list.

>|
     Move the currently selected entry to the end of the list.

New
     A new trap list entry is added, prompting you to edit it.

Remove
     Removes the currently selected list entry

Clear
     Removes all entries from the list, clearing it.

Use
     Closes the window, using the current trap settings.

Load
     Loads the trap settings from a file.

Save
     Stores the trap settings in a file. Note: `term' reads the default
     settings from the file trap.prefs, so make sure your trap settings
     are named accordingly if you wish to use them upon startup.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/FILE_UPLOAD_PANEL

File upload panel

   `term' permits building a list of files to upload before the upload
is started. This list can be built in many ways, such as by dropping
the icons of the files to send on the icon labeled term Upload queue,
by dropping the icons on the upload panel window, by entering the names
of the files in the upload panel window or by using the file requester.

   There are two ways to open the file upload panel. You can
double-click on the term Upload queue icon or use the main menu entry
Upload queue. It includes the following controls:

Files to upload
     This is the list of files to be sent. The text entry field below
     serves to add new file names or to edit the currently selected
     file name.

Add files
     Clicking on this button brings up a file requester to add new
     files to the list. You can select files from one directory at a
     time. The file requester will pop up over and over again asking
     you to add more files until you press the `Done' button.

Add
     Click on this button to add another file name to the list, you
     will be prompted to type in its name.

Remove
     Press this button to remove the currently selected entry from the
     list.

Clear
     In order to remove all entries from the list, clearing it, press
     this button.

Binary upload
     Use this button to upload the listed files in binary mode.

Text upload
     Press this button to upload the listed files in text mode.

Hide
     Click on this button to hide the file upload panel. The list
     contents will be stored.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/AREA_CODE_PANEL

Area code panel

   In the phonebook (see PHONEBOOK) phone rate accounting information
can be assigned to individual entries. The area code panel permits to
assign phone rate accounting information to the phone numbers
themselves, so even the Dial phone number menu function will take
advantage of it.  The area codes in each phone number determine the
rates accounting information to associate with it. In the area code
list you assign a name to each entry and a pattern to match a single or
multiple area codes; next you configure the rates parameters to use for
this entry.

   The area code rates accounting settings are not meant to replace the
individual rates settings in the phonebook, but they have priority over
them.

   The area code panel sports the following controls:

Groups
     This is the list of area code groups, the single entries are
     edited below.

Name
     A name or title for an area group entry.

Pattern
     The area code patterns are configured here. If you wish to have an
     entry correspond to area codes starting with 009 you would enter
     009#? here. The pattern syntax follows the AmigaDOS wildcard
     pattern syntax, so for example multiple area codes can be easily
     combined, e.g. 009 and 007 could be combined as (009|007)#?. See
     your `Using the system software' manual for more information.

     `term' scans the area code list top-down, i.e. for two consecutive
     entries 009#? and 0097#? the number 00971324 would match the first
     entry, but not the second.

|<
     Moves the currently selected entry to the beginning of the list.

<
     Moves the currently selected entry up in the list.

>
     Moves the currently selected entry down in the list.

>|
     Moves the currently selected entry to the end of the list.

New
     Creates a new area code entry and prompts you to edit it.

Remove
     Removes the currently selected area code entry from the list.

Clear
     Removes all area code entries from the list, clearing it.

Edit
     Brings up the rates editing window for the currently selected
     entry. See RATE_PANEL for more information.

Use
     Closes the window, keeps the current settings.

Load
     Loads the area code & rates accounting information from a file.

Save
     Saves the area code & rates accounting information to a file.
     Upon startup `term' will read the default area code & rates
     accounting information from a file named rates.prefs, so make sure
     that your settings file is named correctly for `term' to find it.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PARAMETER_PANEL

Parameter panel

   When `term' invokes an external program which is to handle the job
of transferring files it can pass special parameters to the program on
the command line, such as drawer names. This control panel helps you to
build a command line for the program in question.

Command
     This is where you enter the command to invoke, such as run
     hydracom.

1 File
     This adds %f to the command line. When the program is invoked a
     file requester will prompt you to select one single file. Its name
     will appear in place of the %f characters in the list of arguments
     passed to the program.

Files
     This adds %m to the command line. When the program is invoked a
     file requester will prompt you to select a list of files. Their
     names will appear in place of the %m characters in the list of
     arguments passed to the program.

Port
     This adds %p to the command line. When the program is invoked the
     name of the ARexx port `term' uses will appear in place of the %p
     characters in the list of arguments passed to the program.

Device
     This adds %d to the command line. When the program is invoked the
     name of the serial device driver `term' uses (see SERIAL_PANEL)
     will appear in place of the %d characters in the list of arguments
     passed to the program.

Unit
     This adds %u to the command line. When the program is invoked the
     unit number of the serial device driver `term' uses (see
     SERIAL_PANEL) will appear in place of the %u characters in the
     list of arguments passed to the program.

Source
     This adds %< to the command line. When the program is invoked the
     name of the drawer files to send should be found in (see
     PATH_PANEL) will appear in place of the %< characters in the list
     of arguments passed to the program.

Dest.
     This adds %> to the command line. When the program is invoked the
     name of the drawer files should be placed in when received (see
     PATH_PANEL) will appear in place of the %> characters in the list
     of arguments passed to the program.

Screen
     This adds %s to the command line. When the program is invoked the
     name of the public screen `term' uses (see SCREEN_PANEL) will
     appear in place of the %s characters in the list of arguments
     passed to the program. Please note that instead of the name of a
     screen an empty string may appear.

Baud rate
     This adds %b to the command line. When the program is invoked the
     currently selected baud rate (see SERIAL_PANEL) `term' uses will
     appear in place of the %b characters in the list of arguments
     passed to the program.

Connect. rate
     This adds %c to the command line. When the program is invoked the
     baud rate the modem made the connection with will appear in place
     of the %c characters in the list of arguments passed to the
     program. Please note that if the modem is not currently online %c
     will produce the same number %b does.

Use
     Keeps the current settings.

Cancel
     Discards the current settings.

   For more information on the escape sequences introduced by % see
ESCAPE_SEQUENCES.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/SIGNATURE_PANEL

Signature panel

   `term' will let you choose from a number of predefined signatures
for use with file transfer protocols. Just pick the signature you need.
Please note that different signatures will be presented for upload and
download protocols.  For more information on signatures, see
PROTOCOL_SIGNATURES.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/DATA_TRANSFER

Data transfer

   One of the important features `term' offers are means to transfer
data from one computer to another conveniently. This is accomplished by
using so-called XPR libraries and external programs which `term' will
invoke when necessary.

* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/DATA_TRANSFER_VIA_XPR_LIBRARY

Data transfer via XPR library

   The so-called XPR libraries implement one or more file transfer
protocols in the form of an Amiga shared library. They offer a
standardized interface for settings their protocol options and for
transferring data. Some XPR libraries will handle file transfers all on
their own, e.g. if the remote initiates an upload the XPR library will
respond by automatically starting a download.

   Of particular importance is the Default protocol (see
TRANSFER_PANEL).  If you have selected an XPR library for this
protocol, the library will remain open during the entire `term'
session. For the Z-Modem protocol as implemented through
xprzmodem.library this means that the XPR library will automatically
handle downloads when initiated by the remote.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/DATA_TRANSFER_VIA_EXTERNAL_PROGRAM

Data transfer via external program

   `term' can make use of external programs for the purpose of
transferring data. Whenever the corresponding file transfer function is
invoked, `term' will try to run the selected program. While the program
is running `term' will temporarily halt its serial I/O processing, so
programs which permit sharing the serial device driver with `term' can
immediately pick up the ball and start transferring data. Please note
that this feature requires `term' to open the serial device driver in
shared access mode (see SERIAL_PANEL).

   Almost every external program will need a few command line options to
know its whereabouts, such as the serial device driver to use or which
files to transfer. You can provide this information by editing the
command line (see PARAMETER_PANEL) to include special escape sequences
`term' will expand into data. The following line could be put into the
binary Receive text entry field:

     run hydracom device %p speed %b line %c nocarrier rec %> get

   This will invoke the Hydracom program which implements the Hydra
protocol which sports bidirectional file transfer and also adds a chat
option. This is what the line can expand into when `term' runs the
program:

     run hydracom device TERM speed 38400 line 14400
        nocarrier rec Work:Downloads get

   %p expands into the ARexx port name `term' uses, %b into the baud
rate currently used, %c into the baud rate the modem made the
connection with and %> into the name of the drawer files received
should be placed in.

   To complete this example, the following line could be put into the
binary Send text entry field:

     run hydracom device %p speed %b line %c nocarrier rec %> send %m

   When `term' runs this program, it will first prompt you to select the
files to send, this is what %m does. The files names will then appear
in place of the %m characters.

   For more information on the escape sequences introduced by the %
character, see ESCAPE_SEQUENCES.

   Please note that for `term' to find the external programs they must
either reside in the AmigaDOS Shell search path or need to be prefixed
by the complete AmigaDOS path their are located in.

   `term' runs the programs in synchronous fashion. Some protocols, such
as hydracom, however need to be run asynchronously. For such programs
it is recommended to prefix the command line with the run command.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PROTOCOL_SIGNATURES

Protocol signatures

   Some file transfer protocols sport automatic download and upload
functions.  At the beginning of a data transmission they send a special
data sequence to the remote, indicating that the local side is ready
for action. This data is called a signature. With `term' you can assign
a specific signature to each upload and download protocol (see
TRANSFER_PANEL). When `term' sees this signature in the incoming data
stream the corresponding protocol will be invoked.

   A signature usually consists of a unique sequence of characters,
some of which may not be printable or visible on the screen. This is
why the standard command sequence syntax is employed for entering
signature text (see COMMAND_SEQUENCES).

   You should avoid using a single signature for more than one
protocol. As `term' scans the input data stream it will always invoke
the first protocol which sports a matching signature. Signatures are
scanned in the following order:

   Default protocol (upload)

   Default protocol (download)

   ASCII upload

   ASCII download

   Text upload

   Text download

   Binary upload

   Binary download

   Most transfer protocols use different signatures for uploads and
downloads.  Hydra for example is an exception as it uses the same
signature for both purposes. Take care, it is recommended to use the
Hydra signature only for downloads. Some signatures, such as the
CompuServe Quick B protocol, use very simple signatures which consist
only of a single character. In the case of the Quick B protocol this
would be the ENQ character which is easily generated by spurious line
noise. In this case the protocol may start up expecting a file transfer
and find out rather soon that none is taking place. Although single
character signatures are supported it is recommended not to use them.

   Some XPR libraries implement auto-upload and auto-download functions
all on their own. A common feature is that the signatures that trigger
these functions will not turn up in the input data stream `term'
receives as the protocols will filter them out. Consequently, the
`term' supplied protocol auto-invocation may not work. Be prepared to
handle this.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/ESCAPE_SEQUENCES

Escape sequences

   When invoking external programs to use for transferring data `term'
will build a command line based upon the template given in the transfer
settings editor (see TRANSFER_PANEL). This template can include special
tokens, known as escape sequences. Unlike the so-called command
sequences (see COMMAND_SEQUENCES) they are introduced by a percent
character (%) and can only be used with external file transfer
programs. Please note that you cannot mix command sequences with escape
sequences.

   The following escape sequences are supported:

%f (Single file name)
     Inserts a single file name when the program is run. A file
     requester will open if necessary. If there are still files in the
     upload queue (see FILE_UPLOAD_PANEL) and an upload is to take place
     the first file name will be inserted and no file requester will
     appear.

     Note: Case matters; %f inserts the file name along with its
     complete path, %F inserts the plain file name only, omitting the
     path.

%m (Multiple file names)
     Inserts a list of file names when the program is run. A file
     requester will open if necessary. If there are still files in the
     upload queue (see FILE_UPLOAD_PANEL) and an upload is to take place
     their names will be inserted and no file requester will appear.

     Note: Case matters; %m inserts the file names along with their
     complete paths, %M inserts the plain file names only, omitting
     their paths.

%p (Port name)
     Inserts the ARexx port name `term' is currently using.

%d (Device name)
     Inserts the name of the serial device driver `term' is currently
     using (see SERIAL_PANEL).

%u (Unit number)
     Inserts the unit number of the serial device driver `term' is
     currently using (see SERIAL_PANEL).

%< (Source drawer)
     Inserts the name of the drawer files to be uploaded should be
     found in. This name will be different for ASCII, text and binary
     transfers. The default protocol will always use the binary upload
     path (see PATH_PANEL and TRANSFER_PANEL).

%> (Destination drawer)
     Inserts the name of the drawer files to be received should be
     placed in. This name will be different for ASCII, text and binary
     transfers. The default protocol will always use the binary
     download path (see PATH_PANEL and TRANSFER_PANEL).

%s (Screen name)
     Inserts the name of the public screen `term' is using.

     Note: This may be an empty string. Be prepared to handle this.

%b (Baud rate)
     Inserts the baud rate `term' is currently using (see SERIAL_PANEL).

%c (Connection rate)
     Inserts the baud rate the modem made the connection with.

     Note: This value may be the same as given by %b if the modem is
     not currently online.

%% (Percent sign)
     Inserts the percent sign.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/HOW_TO_SET_UP_HYDRACOM?

How to set up Hydracom?

   In case you don't know already what Hydracom is: it is a
bidirectional file transfer protocol which also sports a chat option.
It permits to send and receive data at the same time. So far, Hydracom
versions exist for the IBM-PC, the Atari ST and the Amiga of course.

   With the introduction of `term' v4.0 an interface was added to the
Hydracom Amiga port to allow it to take over the serial I/O processing
from `term'. Note that this requires the Hydracom Amiga port revision 2
or higher to work.

   `term' v4.3 will let you choose external programs for use as file
transfer protocols. Hydracom falls into this cathegory.

   Please open the transfer settings editor (see TRANSFER_PANEL) now
and press the button labeled Page three times until the page Binary
transfer protocol becomes visible. This page is divided into two parts.
The top half controls the upload protocol and the other half controls
the download protocol. To use the Hydracom external protocol, now do
the following: there are two buttons labeled Type.  Press them both
twice until they show External program. This will make the Send and
Receive text entry fields available.  In the Send field enter the
following line:

     run hydracom device %p speed %b line %c nocarrier rec %> send %m

   In the Receive field enter the following line:

     run hydracom device %p speed %b line %c nocarrier rec %> get

   The Hydracom command must be prefixed with the Run command due to
the way the protocol interacts with `term'. For other protocols the Run
prefix may be omitted.

   Now close the window by pressing the Use button. Now Hydracom is
configured as the binary file transfer protocol. To receive files using
the protocol, select the menu item Download binary file(s), to send and
receive files at the same time (Hydracom is a bidirectional file
transfer protocol) select Upload binary file(s).

   If you wish to use the Hydracom signature (see SIGNATURE_PANEL and
TRANSFER_PANEL) to auto-start transmissions, you need to keep a few
things in mind. The signature is identical both for uploads and
downloads, but using it for both purposes is not a good idea. `term'
will always pick the upload signature first. Hydracom is a bidirectional
file transfer protocol which allows you to send and receive files at
the same time. This works only when invoking an upload, but not when
running a download. If you select a download signature you will lose the
bidirectional transfer feature. It is recommended to start transmissions manually.

   This setup will always let you transfer data only in one direction.
In order to take advantage of the bidirectional transfer feature Hydra
offers you will need to make use of two ARexx scripts that should have
accompanied `term'. You only need to modify the commands for Send and
Receive a little:

   For Send enter:

     AskUpload.term device %p speed %b line %c nocarrier rec %> send %m

   And for Receive enter:

     AskDownload.term device %p speed %b line %c nocarrier rec %> get

   Before the transfer starts you will be asked whether you wish to send
and receive data at the same time or whether data should be transmitted
only in one direction.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/CONFIGURATION_HINTS

Configuration hints

   Admittely, `term' has more configuration options and settings than
you can shake a stick at. I have received a number of request to
explain where to start after installing the program:

  1. Start with the serial settings (see SERIAL_PANEL). `term' will
     usually copy your current system preferences settings. If you
     happen to know that they are correct and worked fine for you in
     the past you probably don't need to make any changes.  But if you
     never were quite happy with the setup this is your chance to make
     it fit.

     As the lucky owner of a high speed modem to support all those
     nifty compressing transfer protocols nobody knows how to pronounce
     correctly (v.32/v.32bis/MNP/etc.) you will probably want to run it
     at baud rates around 9,600-19,200 bps. If you choose to do so make
     sure that the Handshaking switch is set to RTS/CTS or data is
     easily lost during transmissions.

     Note: some modems will lock up if the RTS/CTS handshaking protocol
     is enabled although they should support it. In most cases the
     modem behaviour can be changed. First turn off RTS/CTS handshaking
     (set it to None), then enter AT&S0 and press return, and finally
     turn on RTS/CTS Handshaking on again. Your modem should now
     respond properly to your commands. To make this change permanent,
     enter AT&W and press return to store the current modem profile in
     its nonvolatile RAM.

     Older modem hardware usually supports only a fixed number of baud
     rates, mostly up to 2,400 bps. Do not enable RTS/CTS handshaking,
     leave it turned off. In fact if you don't turn it off `term' will
     have trouble sending and receiving data.

     Make sure that the baud rate fits and your modem supports it.
     Modern modem hardware usually can adjust to the baud rate you
     choose, older modems will send & receive illegible gibberish if
     addressed at the wrong baud rate. Not unheard of are modems which
     can communicate with the terminal program only at fixed baud
     rates: while they are happy with 9,600 bps they might find 14,400
     bps not at all worth responding to. I recommend that you try
     several baud rate settings until one is found to fit.

     If you don't want to use the built-in Amiga serial port hardware
     you will want to change the device name and unit number settings.
     Your I/O expansion hardware manual will tell you which name to
     choose and which device unit numbers are valid.

     The serial panel (see SERIAL_PANEL) sports a number of additional
     options. Do not change them right now! In particular stay away
     from that sexy High-speed mode button and don't let the Buffer
     size slider tempt you. Return from the serial settings to the
     main menu by clicking on the Use button and save your current
     setup back to disk using the Save settings menu item.

  2. Proceed to the modem settings (see MODEM_PANEL) and take a look at
     the switch labeled Dial mode. A modem usually dials phone numbers
     either using a technique called `tone' or `pulse' dialing.
     Technically, tone dialing requires your local phone net operator
     (some kind of computer) to listen to a sequence of sounds which
     represent the single digits of the phone number dialled. Pulse
     dialing involves getting a number of electric pulses, each of
     which represents a digit of the phone number, transmitted across
     the line. Tone dialing is usually much faster than pulse dialing,
     but it isn't supported all over the world. If the receiver of your
     phone reports a number of beeping sounds when you dial a number
     you can use tone dialing.  If you hear rattling sounds it's
     probably pulse dialing for you. Let's get back to the Dial mode,
     if you wish to use pulse dialing, set it to Pulse, otherwise set
     it to Tone.

     Leave the rest of the modem setup as it is, do not change the
     Connect auto baud switch.

  3. Next, take a look at the screen settings (see SCREEN_PANEL). This
     is where you choose the terminal screen/window look and colours.
     By default `term' is configured to open a plain four colour screen
     using the Amiga default font. This should be sufficient unless you
     plan to spend most of your modeming time in PC-driven BBSes which
     keep throwing lots of colours at you.

     Choose how many colours the terminal should use, the switch labeled
     Colour will let you choose between 4 Colours (Amiga), 8 Colours
     (ANSI), 16 Colours (EGA) and 2 Colours (Monochrome). Each of these
     settings has a particular default palette attached. The Amiga mode
     will use your current system default colours. ANSI represents the
     choice of colours the ANSI committee responsible for standardizing
     a certain terminal command protocol to be the best given the
     constraints they had. EGA reflects whatever the engineers who
     designed the first Enhanced Graphics Adaptor card for the PC
     considered to be an enhanced colour palette. Monochrome is my idea
     how an extremely simplistic, while still readable colour choice
     could look like. Choose what you find appropriate, but keep in
     mind that the more colours to use the slower screen updates,
     scrolling and text output will get. Also, a 16 colour high
     resolution screen will put your system under additional stress if
     you are running an older Amiga model which is not equipped with
     the AGA chip set. Careful please, any changes you make will affect
     the performance of the program!

     You might want to change the screen mode or the user interface
     font. When you are satisfied with the setup, return to the main
     menu.

  4. Now it's time to edit the terminal settings (see TERMINAL_PANEL).
     This is where you control the basic behaviour of the terminal
     emulation. If you wish to use an IBM PC style font for the
     terminal display you can do so by changing the Font switch to IBM
     PC style. Alternatively, you might find it worth changing the Text
     font instead which is the font to be used for terminal text output.
     Note that if the Font switch is set to anything else but Standard
     your Text font settings will be ignored. Well, actually they will
     not be entirely ignored, but the IBM PC style font will be opened
     in the point size you selected.

     Don't touch any other controls, return to the main menu when you
     are finished.

  5. If you are likely to visit a lot of PC BBSes, edit the emulation
     settings now (see EMULATION_PANEL). You might want to turn on the
     switch labeled `CLS' resets cursor position, otherwise the
     terminal screen might not get cleared properly when the BBS sends
     the control codes it considers appropriate for this purpose.

     Leave the rest of the setup as it is and return to the main menu.

  6. The next step involves changing the path settings (see
     PATH_PANEL). When receiving files on your machine you might want
     to have them stored in a special drawer. You can do this by editing
     the default download paths. Most important is the Default binary
     download path, I suggest to create a drawer called Downloads
     within the drawer `term' resides in. Once this is done simply type
     the name PROGDIR:Downloads and return to the main menu. The next
     binary file downloaded will go into the Downloads drawer.

   If you followed these steps `term' should be configured for the first
session. Save the current settings to disk now so you can always return
to this working configuration later in case the changes you made to the
current setup did not have the desired effect. You can try to fine-tune
your `term' setup now and change some of the options not covered in this
brief introduction, but please remember to keep your original
configuration file in a safe place, you will be glad you did.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/BUILT-IN_TERMINAL_EMULATION

Built-in terminal emulation

   The `term' built-in terminal emulation implements the VT-220 command
set with a few exceptions. There are no country specific character sets,
no down-line-loadable character sets, no user defined keys, no keyboard
language support and only ten function keys, not twenty (many of these
features are supported through the Amiga operating system). Most VT-102
and VT-52 commands should be supported as well, but since my
documentation on these command sets is rather incomplete I cannot be
entirely sure all the features are covered.

   The numeric keypad and the four cursor keys can be switched into
applications mode if requested by the remote. The four programmable
function keys (also known as PF keys) are mapped to the top row of the
numeric keypad. When in applications mode these keys will generate the
codes produced by the PF keys on a VT-102 terminal. If in standard
mode, you will need to hold down the Control key in order to make
theses keys generate the correct PF key codes.

   The Tab and Space keys receive special treatment if a qualifier key
is held down when they are pressed. Shift + Tab will generate two
Escape + Tab characters. Control + Space generates the ASCII NUL byte.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TEXT_BUFFER

Text buffer

   The text buffer implements a service which continually stores text
displayed on `term's main screen, so the user can refer to it lateron.


  GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS   General information on the text buffer.
  OPERATION                 How to operate the text buffer?



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/GENERAL_CHARACTERISTICS

General characteristics

   The size of the text buffer is managed dynamically so that for every
new line which is read new memory must be allocated. So the size of the
text buffer is limited only by the amount of the available memory. It
is recommended that the text buffer is emptied periodically to avoid
using the entire free memory.

   If there is insufficient memory to place a new line into the text
buffer, the first line will be deleted to make room for the new line.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/OPERATION

Operation

   The contents of the text buffer can be paged through using the keys
for moving of the cursor (Shift + Cursor keys moves page by page,
Control + Cursor key jumps to the beginning or end of the text buffer).
Additionally, the numeric keypad keys are overlaid with jump and paging
functions (corresponding to the inscriptions/graphics on the front of
the keys).

   There also is a pull-down menu available which is briefly described
below:

Search
     A search function is called which scans from the topmost line on
     the screen for the search text entered. If the search text is
     found it is displayed and highlighted.

     `term' remembers search strings entered. You can use the Cursor up
     and Cursor down keys to recall previous input.

     In addition to the search text there are a number of options which
     may be specified when searching:

    Search forward
          If this switch is enabled `term' search from the topmost line
          on the screen downward to the end of the buffer, otherwise it
          searches upward to the beginning of the buffer.

    Ignore case
          With this switch enabled the search does not distinguish
          between lower case and upper case characters, i.e. TEXT =
          Text = text, etc.

    Only whole words
          If this switch is enabled, `term' will search for whole words
          only, not for parts of a word. For example, searching for
          term with the Only whole words option enabled would stop
          at the word term, but ignore the word terminal.

Repeat search
     Continues the search process started with Search. The previously
     entered search text is carried over.

Go to main screen
     Switches to the main screen of `term'.

Clear buffer
     Clears the contents of the text buffer.

Close buffer
     Closes the text buffer screen but leaves the contents unchanged.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/CLIPBOARD

Clipboard

   Cut & paste functions are available on the main screen, the buffer
screen and the review buffer. Here is how to use them:

Buffer screen
     Use the mouse to point to the first character you wish to send to
     the clipboard, hold down the select button, drag the mouse to the
     last character you wish to copy and release the button. The text
     marked will be transferred to the clipboard.

     Holding down the Control key while clicking on a character will
     feed the single character into the input stream, it will not be
     buffered in the clipboard.

Main screen
     Use the mouse to point to the first character you wish to send to
     the clipboard, hold down the select button, drag the mouse to the
     last character you wish to select and release the button. Select
     the Copy menu item (see EDIT) to transfer the text to the
     clipboard.  Instead of dragging the mouse you may also
     double-click on a single word to select it.

     Holding down the Control key while clicking on a character will
     feed the single character into the input stream, it will not be
     buffered in the clipboard.

Review buffer
     Use the mouse to point to the first character you wish to send to
     the clipboard, hold down the select button, drag the mouse to the
     last character you wish to select and release the button. Press
     Amiga + C to copy the selected text to the clipboard.

   To paste the clipboard contents, i.e. feed them into the terminal
input stream, either select the Paste menu item (see EDIT) or press
Amiga + V. In order to send the clipboard contents along with a Paste
prefix and Paste suffix hold down any Shift key when selecting the
Paste menu entry or when selecting text with the mouse (this works
both with the main screen and the text buffer screen).

   Hold down one of the Alt keys and press the left mouse button to
make `term' emit a number of cursor move sequences which will position
the on-screen cursor at the spot where you clicked the mouse.

   In standard text gadgets a solution had to be found to preserve the
line editing functions while still supporting menu shortcuts. To undo
any changes made press Amiga + Q, to clear the text gadgets press Amiga
+ X. Menus associated with the shortcuts Amiga + Q/X are called by
holding down any Shift key along with the Amiga keys (i.e. Shift +
Amiga + Q will select the Quit menu item if available).



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/COMMAND_SEQUENCES

Command sequences

   Each text sent directly to the modem is a command sequence. This
includes telephone numbers, modem initialisation strings, function key
assignments, etc. In addition to the normal text strings various other
commands are supported which will be described in the following section.


  BACKSLASH   The backslash \ 
  CARET       The caret ^
  TILDE       The tilde ~



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/BACKSLASH

Backslash

\\ 
     Generates a single backslash.

\0
     Resets the text pacing mode (see CLIPBOARD_PANEL) to the settings
     defaults. Any changes of the text pacing mode affect only the line
     to be sent. The next following line will be sent using the default
     text pacing mode.

\1
     Sets the text pacing mode to Direct.

\2
     Sets the text pacing mode to Wait for echo.

\3
     Sets the text pacing mode to Wait for any echo.

\4
     Sets the text pacing mode to Wait for line prompt.

\5
     Sets the text pacing mode to Character/line delay.

\6
     Sets the text pacing mode to Keyboard delay.

\a
     Executes an ARexx command (all text to follow this character).

\b
     Generates a backspace (deletes the character to the left of the
     cursor).

\c
     Calls a main menu entry, the menu entry to be called is determined
     by the argument to follow; this is either a six digit number
     (example: \c 010203 would call subitem 1, item 2, menu 3) or the
     name of the menu entry enclosed in single quotes to call (example:
     \c 'about' would call the About... menu entry, the search is
     case-insensitive and only compares the characters given).

\d
     Executes an AmigaDOS command (all text to follow this character).

\e
     Generates the escape character (ASCII code 27).

\f
     Generates a form feed (skip to beginning of the next page or clear
     the screen).

\g
     Places the text to follow this character in the clipboard.

\h
     Appends the text to follow this character to the current clipboard
     contents.

\i
     Feeds the contents of the clipboard into the input stream.

\n
     Generates a line feed.

\p
     Feeds the password of the currently active telephonebook entry
     into the input stream. The password is automatically cleared for
     security reasons when the connection is lost.

\r
     Generates a carriage return.

\t
     Generates a tab jump.

\u
     Similar to the \p command, the \u command will feed the current
     user name into the input stream.

\w
     Depending on how the Dial mode switch is set in the modem
     settings, this command either produces P for pulse dialing or T
     for touch tone dialing.

\x
     Generates a break signal (as with the Send break menu entry).

\^
     Generates a caret character.

\~
     Generates a tilde character.

\*
     The code to follow the asterisk determines the character to
     produce.  This can be any three digit number or a symbolic name
     from the following list (1):

     NUL, SOH, STX, ETX, EOT, ENQ, ACK, BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF, CR,
     SO, SI, DLE, DC1, DC2, DC3, DC4, NAK, SYN, ETB, CAN, EM, SUB,
     ESC, FS, GS, RS, US, SP, DEL, SS2, SS3, DCS, CSI, ST, OSC, PM, APC,
     NBS and SHY

   If none of the mentioned combinations is recognized the character
which follows the \  will be fed into the input stream without any
changes.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1)  EOU may be implemented in a future release



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/CARET

Caret

   This character is used to change the following character to a
`control character'. So the sequence ^J will become a Line feed and ^I
becomes a tab jump. The character which follows the ^ has to be located
between  @{ub} and [, otherwise it is fed into the input stream without
changes.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TILDE

Tilde

   This character causes the program to pause for exactly half a second
before it continues to process the following commands.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/FAST!_MACROS

Fast! macros

   In implementation and design the fast! macros are closely related to
the function key macros (see FUNCTION_KEY_PANEL). If invoked by
selecting the corresponding menu entry, a window will open on the right
hand side of the screen sporting a scrollable list of macros (the
contents of this list can be edited using the fast! macro panel).  When
a list entry is selected, the associated command sequence (see
COMMAND_SEQUENCES) will be executed.

   By using the fast! macros it is theoretically possible to control a
BBS just by mouse, provided that you have the approriate macros in your
fast! macro list.

   The fast! macro panel can be resized and acts just like the main
`term' window:  menu items can be selected and characters entered are
sent to the serial driver.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/PACKET_WINDOW

Packet window

   In this window a line can be edited before it is sent. All the usual
editing functions known from standard input fields are available (Shift
+ cursor left/right jumps to the start/end of the line).

   Additionally, some extended functions exist which are performed by
pressing a cursor key together with the Shift or Control key:

Control + Cursor left
     Jumps to the next word.

Control + Cursor right
     Jumps to the previous word.

Cursor up
     Shows the last entered command in the input line.

Shift + Cursor up
     Shows the very first command entered so far.

Cursor down
     Shows the next entered command (if you moved back for some
     commands before).

Shift + Cursor down
     Shows the very last command entered so far.

   This text gadget has a buffer where all previously entered commands
are stored (`Command history'). You can page through this buffer, load
and save it and individual lines can be recalled. As with the text
buffer this buffer is managed dynamically. The same memory restrictions
that apply to the text buffer are valid for this buffer.

   The input line also has a menu which offers the following functions:

Load history
     Loads the contents of the input line buffer from a file. Each
     stored line in this file can be recalled and sent.

Save history as...
     Saves the contents of the input line buffer to a file.

Clear history
     Simply releases all previously stored commands and the memory used
     by them.

Other window
     Switches to the main screen of `term'.

Show output
     If not enabled, this causes the input line not to be echoed in the
     terminal window.

Quit
     Closes the window (corresponds to clicking the close gadget of the
     window).

   Every character entered into this window is shown immediately so
that those things where it is better that they should not appear on the
screen (like passwords for a mailbox) should be entered in another way.

   The contents of every input line are interpreted as a command
sequence and therefore can also contain control characters.

   If a line taken from the input buffer is sent without change it is
not stored in the buffer again (`true history' such as known from
`ConMan').

   The contents of the input buffer are cleared automatically after the
window is closed. Under no circumstances are the contents maintained
until the next call!

   Provided that the packet window is large enough, a list to contain
the command line history will be displayed.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/CHAT_LINE

Chat line

   The chat line is roughly functionally equivalent to the packet window
(see PACKET_WINDOW). However, there is no special pull-down menu and no
option to save or load the command history. Unlike the packet window
the command history is kept between invocations.

   The chat line is, as the name says, a text entry field which allows
one single line of text to be entered. Except for the optical
appearance and the handling of control characters (the text entry field
appears as a single line above the status line, it's also a tad smaller
than the packet window) it is virtually identical in handling with the
packet window. The only exception is the special key combination to use
when clearing the entire past command history.  To clear the history,
hold down either Amiga key and then press either the Del or the
Backspace key.

   The chat line always passes control characters, such as Control + C
and Tab straight through to the modem.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/SCRIPT_RECORDING

Script recording

   `term' offers a feature called `Script recording' which lets you
record incoming data sent by a BBS or a remote host and your response
to it, i.e. the text you typed, such as login name and password. The
recorded data can then be saved to an ARexx script file which can be
used as an auto-login script.  In order to record a script you can
either use the dialing panel button labeled Start recording on
connection or the menu item Record.

   Once `term' is recording terminal output and your input the status
display will show Recording or Rec.line, depending on the text entry
mode. By default `term' will only record single keystrokes, which makes
it difficult to enter whole words. If you want `term' to remember the
entire line of text you are about to enter either use the Record line
menu item or press the shift+return key combination: the status will
change to Rec.line. To return to keystroke recording just press the
return key or select the Record line menu item/press shift+return again.

   `term' only remembers the last ten characters sent and a maximum of
256 characters you can enter per line. If you enter more than this
number of characters older keystrokes will be discarded.

   When you are finished recording the script select the Record line
menu item. A file requester will ask you for the file name to save the
script under. If the file is successfully saved you may be asked whether
you want the script file to be used as a login script for the currently
active phonebook entry.

   To make sure that the script associated with the phonebook entry
will be called the next time you dial it the phonebook file must be
saved to disk before you quit `term'.

   The script file generated will consist of ARexx commands `term'
understands, mostly TIMEOUT, WAIT and SEND. The text to be waited for
and to be sent is given in standard `term' command sequence notation.
For more information consult the chapter entitled COMMAND_SEQUENCES.
The `term' ARexx interface documentation provides the necessary
background to explain how the script commands work, it should also give
you hints how to customize the recorded scripts.

   Caution: scripts recorded by `term' usually need additional editing,
don't expect a script to work right away.  You may want to change the
timeout values, remove extra characters and input.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TERM_AND_EMPLANT

term and Emplant

   You need to keep a few things in mind before you actually try to use
`term' with Emplant, the Apple Macintosh emulation and the on-board
serial ports:

  1. Both the emulation and `term' are very demanding programs in terms
     of memory usage. The Macintosh emulation will allocate a fixed
     memory area for itself which normally should be as large as
     possible. `term' has to use the amount of memory that remains,
     which may not be much. It is recommended that at least 3-4 MBytes
     of memory should be available when you start `term'.  Although the
     program will show an error message if it cannot allocate enough
     memory the external modules (terminal emulation libraries, file
     transfer libraries, serial device driver, etc.) may not work
     properly under low memory conditions and thus can cause software
     failures. You should reduce the sizes of the many memory buffers
     `term' uses to perform its functions, such as transfering files
     and capturing text. For example, the text buffer will keep growing
     until all available memory is exhausted unless you set a maximum
     limit for its size (see CAPTURE_PANEL).

  2. `term' can share the device driver selected for the I/O ports with
     Emplant. For example, if you select serial.device as the driver to
     use for Port A Emplant will open the driver in shared mode. In
     `term' you would select the Shared access switch in the serial
     settings (see SERIAL_PANEL). When both programs are up and running
     you must make sure that only one program at a time will access the
     serial device driver, or data may be lost. For example, if you
     have ZTerm and `term' running and wish to use ZTerm for
     communications you must make `term' release the serial device
     driver (use the Modem menu item Release serial device for this
     purpose). Likewise, if you wish to use `term' instead of ZTerm or
     some other terminal program on the Macintosh side, make sure you
     quit the Macintosh terminal program first.

     Take care, LocalTalk can have a negative effect on the serial data
     transfer performance.

  3. If you connect one of the Emplant serial ports to your modem you
     should know whether the connector pins that are used for 7 wire
     hardware handshaking (RTS/CTS handshaking) are properly connected
     or not. Some cables that are sold for use with Hayes modems or the
     Apple ImageWriter do not have the necessary pins connected. If you
     wish to use the RTS/CTS handshaking protocol (see SERIAL_PANEL),
     set the handshaking mode to RTS/CTS (Check DSR).  This insures
     that `term' will run properly even if your cable cannot be used
     for RTS/CTS handshaking. Your Amiga may lock up if the cable does
     not support RTS/CTS handshaking and you have RTS/CTS selected as
     the handshaking protocol.

  4. It is unwise to use empser.device while the Macintosh emulation is
     running. Since the Macintosh drivers are unaware of the Amiga side
     trying to access the serial port hardware conflicts are not to be
     avoided. Either use `term' with empser.device or run the Macintosh
     emulation, you cannot do both at the same time.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/TERM_AND_SLIP

term and SLIP

   If you are brave enough to use `term' to dial into your SLIP account,
you should make sure that your modem does not hang up when you leave
`term' and hand control over to your SLIP software. Typically, closing
the serial device driver causes the DTR signal to drop which some modems
interprete as an immediate command to abort the connection. This signal
is automatically dropped when `term' is terminated.

   To avoid this problem, consult your modem manual for information on
a command that controls how the modem reacts when the DTR signal is
dropped. For a ZyXEL modem this would be AT&D0. Put the command AT&D0\\r
into the modem init command field (see MODEM_PANEL) of the phonebook
entry you use to dial into your SLIP account.



* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES

Environment variables

   Information which is to be available the next time the program is
run is placed as AmigaDOS variables in the directories ENV: and ENVARC:
by `term'.

   The variables used by `term' can be used and manipulated by other
programs transparently. In detail these variables are:

TERMCONFIGPATH
     The name of the directory in which all information used by `term'
     is placed (standard configuration, phonebook, etc.). The default

   Below you will find my signed public key. Save it to a disk file and
enter PGP <file name> to decode it. This will produce a file called
public_key. To add my key to your PGP keyring now enter PGP -ka
public_key and follow the instructions on the screen. To verify my
signature, now enter PGP <file name> again. It's probably pretty
paranoid to rely upon PGP signatures and keys, but then again you might
want to have a somewhat unambiguous proof that the distribution
archives you have downloaded are intact.  Security can still be
compromised, if you don't trust the key below you can still contact me
to ask for an official key.

* TERM-ENGLISH.GUIDE/REVISION_HISTORY

  Revision history 

Changes introduced with v4.4:

    Threw out the optimized scrolling code. It could slow things down
     on slow computers and wasn't working particularly well either.

    Removed the code that did the jump scrolling by taking a look at
     how many line feeds were received in one go. This could slow
     things down and interfere with on-screen rendering, such as with
     on-line games like "Perihelion".

    Now uses gtlayout.library v13 to layout the menus; now many more
     menu items and menus fit onto small screens.

    Screens and windows now open large enough for the status line
     display to fit.

    Put the optimized scrolling code back in. It should now be able to
     behave itself in an orderly fashion.

    The screen saving/printing code is now smart enough not to
     include the status line in the bitmap that it is going to be
     output.

    The phonebook now uses a fixed-width font when running under
     Kickstart 2.04.

    The status line display boxes are a bit wider now, so hopefully
     no data will be cut off any more.

    Simplified the jump scrolling code a bit, eliminating another
     level of data filtering. This should remove the odd slowdown that
     would occur when the modem delivered a large chunk of data.

    Changed the way the download procedure queries how much space is
     still left on the destination filing system. This time it should
     get it right.

    Fixed a weird memory alignment problem in the double-buffered file
     handling code.

    Saving/loading the fast macro settings is now properly
     remembered, so `term' will no longer tell you that the settings
     have been changed upon exit unless they have really been changed
     and not saved to disk yet.

    In the paged settings editors for screen, terminal and capture
     prefs the displays for screen mode and font no longer auto expand
     with their contents.

    Insert mode now works properly again [Andreas Kirchwitz].

    Fixed an Enforcer hit in the emulation settings when called from
     the phonebook [Matthias Scheler].

    Fixed locale string lookup bug in file identification code, also
     added PNG file signature.

    `term' no longer refuses to dial out if the modem is still online
     and the `protective mode' is enabled. In this case, a requester
     will pop up and ask you if you want to hang up the line before
     dialing out.

    Small fixes for deep CyberGfx screens (15 bits and up).

    The check to see if the serial device driver you picked from the
     list did really exist was looking at the wrong buffer.

    The dialer checked for modem errors, but the scanner responsible
     for catching the modem message never actually passed this
     information to the dialer.

    Changed the machine readable version number string; it now
     includes information to explain for which type of machine the
     program was compiled.

    Added new "Direct connection" option to the serial settings. If
     enabled, this switch suppresses RTS/CTS warnings and disables the
     carrier check. This is useful for direct nullmodem connections and
     for using the Amiga as a dumb terminal.

    Moved the "Alert" switch from the terminal settings to the
     miscellaneous settings. This made it necessary to bump the program
     revision number to v4.4.

    You can now configure the opening size and position of the
     standard asl requesters (file, font, display mode) in the misc
     settings. Just select the positioning mode you want (centered or
     placed relative to the top left corner of the main window) and
     click on the "Edit..." button. A file requester window will open.
     Drag it to the position you want and change its size if necessary,
     then click on "Use". `term' will keep position and size as default
     values for the requesters to open.

    Rearranged some settings editors, made some room between
     neighbouring radio buttons and checkboxes, added `Tab' key support
     to some editors which were missing this feature.

    The notorious screen cloning feature did not work in previous
     releases, in fact gtlayout.library was broken in many ways and
     badly needed updating [Klaus Drr].

    Added LZX archive file type.

    Sorry, no speedbar in this release, I just currently don't have
     the time to do it :(

    Added another character send delay option, this time to the modem
     settings. Some weird east-asian built v.34 compliant modems will
     happily operate at 57600 baud, but get into real trouble when
     receiving plain modem dialing and initialization commands. The
     characters come in just too fast. A little delay between the
     characters being sent may help.

    The `about' window now sports scrolling credits.

    The phonebook will no longer load empty configuration items (key
     macros, fast macros, etc.) to edit if the names of the files are
     not given.

    Due to a bunch of internal changes in order to support scaled
     characters in more consistent fashion, the option to select
     half-width characters was removed from the emulation settings. Cut
     & paste with non-normal sized characters still does not work
     properly on the screen.

    Redid the logic for the RTS/CTS (DSR check) handshaking mode.
     `term' now opens the serial device driver with RTS/CTS handshaking
     disabled, checks the DSR signal and then if necessary closes the
     device driver and reopens it with RTS/CTS handshaking enabled.

    `term' no longer locks the serial device driver for exclusive
     access through OwnDevUnit.library when told to open the driver in
     shared mode.

    Loading the configuration and then choosing "Save configuration"
     from the main menu will save the current settings under the name
     of the configuration file loaded last.

    The cursor key control panel now sports a "Default" button.

Changes introduced with v4.3:

    Fixed an Enforcer hit in the code that would open the file
     transfer window in case of error.

    Colour palettes are now 24 bits wide (in reality even 96 bits,
     but the user interface does not support this precision).

    Added support code for AmigaUW terminal window resizing.

    Fixed another bug in gtlayout.library which would cause trouble
     with palette editor gadgets using only two colours.

    Fixed another Enforcer hit in the XEM settings editor.

    Updated the screen settings editor. It no longer displays options
     that cannot be changed.

    The "Dial number" function would use the wrong temporary buffer
     when prompting to enter the number to dial.

    Opening the status window no longer causes crashes. It was the
     call to DateStamp() and DateToStr() which caused the Task to
     handle the status window to crash. It's a process now.

    Cut & paste while the chat line is active now works properly.

    The chat line is now unavailable if an external terminal
     emulation is active.

    The dialing menu items now get properly disabled if the program
     starts up in online state.

    Made the only (!) call in gtlayout.library which could cause
     AmigaDOS to be called an option for Processes only. It will no
     longer crash when called by a Task.

    When running under Kickstart 2.04, the screen overscan mode is by
     default set to the text overscan size.

    The built-in ASCII transfer windows now also get size- adjusted
     in order to avoid overlapping the status line.

    Added a startup notice to explain that *this* really is a beta
     test release.

    The program now consists only of load hunks smaller than 100000
     bytes each. This should make it possible to load the program even
     if the system memory is greatly fragmented.

    Finally discovered why the rate panel editor would swallow the
     first cost entry. Turning off the SAS/C global optimizer did the
     trick.

    The chat line text could become unreadable with some text pen
     choices. According to the BOOPSI documentation my original code
     was correct, but I discovered that the ROM code actually expects a
     different data format.

    The colour palette management code would not work properly under
     Kickstart 2.04.

    Fixed three long standing bugs in the terminal emulation code. If
     a command would erase/clear more lines/characters than the screen
     would hold memory trashing was not to be avoided. This has been
     fixed.

    An uninitialized variable in the colour palette setup code could
     cause real trouble, crashing the machine almost instantly.

    The review buffer process did not protect itself against sudden
     removal, leading to crashes after the review window was closed.

    The "READ CR" ARexx command now does again what it should do.

    The code that would cause Enforcer hits within rexxsyslib.library
     was rewritten to use a different technique to tell free messages
     and Rexx messages apart.

    The AmigaUW TTY resizing code would crash the machine if the
     serial device was unavailable. This would happen for example if
     the serial device driver did not open upon startup.

    The dialing window now displays which dial list entry will be
     dialed next when in redial delay mode.

    `term' now properly allocates its work bitmaps when running under
     Kickstart 3.x, previously it would occasionally fall back to
     constructing bitmaps on its own which could cause speed penalties.

    Another one bites the dust. Found a really long standing bug in
     the double-buffered file routines. Can you say buffer trashing,
     memory losses, crashes? The code used to be very vulnerable to
     memory shortages. I fixed this and also threw in some extra code
     to make the buffers quad-longword aligned to help '040 systems
     with DMA hard disk controllers.

    There is now a bit of new code in the program which opens
     gtlayout.library. If there still is an old library release in
     memory it gets flushed first, then the library is reopened.  This
     has the effect of forcing the library to get reloaded from disk.

    Even more changes to the terminal emulation code; previous
     releases always ignored the current background colour when
     clearing lines, the screens or moving text around. This has been
     fixed. Some code also did BitMap peeking which is strictly
     speaking not allowed. When using fonts with an odd height smooth
     scrolling could leave pixel trash behind.  Some routines, notably
     those responsible for scrolling and erasing display text, never
     made sure that the area to scroll/erase was within valid bounds.
     As the low-level routines always counted upon this data to be
     correct nasty crashes could result. Some of the new code is far
     from being highly efficient, but should be much more robust than
     the old routines. Anyway, those folks looking for a high-speed
     terminal emulation probably have already chosen a different
     program.

    The screen settings editor would occasionally assign the wrong
     colour palette to phone book entry configurations.  This has been
     fixed.

    The routine to reset the text colours to something readable did
     not take the new emulation pen settings into account. This has
     been fixed.

    To aid debugging, there is a new switch in the modem settings
     which tells the dialer to echo commands sent to the modem and to
     show the modem responses.

    Added another switch to the misc. settings editor. You can now
     disable those annoying "File ... already exists, do you want to
     replace it?" requesters.

    Major revamp of the file transfer settings editor. First off,
     it's no longer that tall. The "Page" cycle gadget cycles through
     all the individual entries. As there are: the default protocol,
     the ASCII transfer settings, the text transfer settings and the
     binary transfer settings. For each protocol you will find another
     cycle gadget, a text entry field and a big, friendly button
     labeled "Edit settings...". The cycle gadgets will let you choose
     between 2..4 possible settings for each protocol. "XPR library"
     uses the good old XPR interface, the text entry field holds the
     name of the library to use. "Internal" uses the built-in code.
     "Default" uses the default protocol. "External program" selects an
     external program to handle the file transfer, the text entry field
     holds the name of the program and possible program parameters. If
     using the "External program" mode clicking on the downward
     pointing `select' button will bring up another editor. Here you
     can choose the program to use and you can edit the command line
     options it should use. Pressing a button will append the
     corresponding escape sequence:

    1 File (= %f)
          Inserts a single file name when the program is executed.  A
          file requester will pop up if necessary.

          NOTE: Case matters; %f inserts the file name along with its
          complete path %F inserts the plain file name only, omitting
          the path.

    Files (= %m)
          Inserts a list of file names when the program is executed.  A
          file requester will pop up if necessary.

          NOTE: Case matters; %m inserts the file names along with
          their complete paths, %M inserts the plain file names only,
          omitting their paths.

    Port (= %p)
          Inserts the ARexx port name `term' is currently using.  Very
          useful in conjunction with HydraCom.

    Device (= %d)
          Inserts the name of the serial device driver `term' is
          currently using. This comes in handy with external programs
          which permit sharing a device driver with other programs.

    Unit (= %u)
          Inserts the serial device driver unit number `term' is
          currently using. This comes in handy with external programs
          which permit sharing a device driver with other programs.

    Source (= %<)
          Inserts the name of the upload path for the current transfer
          mode (ASCII, text, binary).

    Dest. (= %>)
          Inserts the name of the download path for the current
          transfer mode (ASCII, text, binary).

    Screen (= %s)
          Inserts the name of the public screen `term' is running on.

          NOTE: May be an empty string.

    Baud rate (= %b)
          The currently selected transfer speed in bits/second (Baud).

    Connect. rate (= %c)
          The transfer speed your modem made the connection with.

          NOTE: this will be the same value as given by %b if the modem
          is not currently connected.

     The escape sequence %% expands into %, in case you need it. The
     file transfer functions support the upload list window and the
     ARexx file transfer list: if %f/%F/%m/%M escape sequences are
     found in the command line text they will be replaced by the upload
     list if necessary. Please note that when using an external program
     no file names will be removed from the ARexx upload list. Here are
     two examples to get you started:

     run hydracom device %p speed %b line %c nocarrier rec %> get

     This will invoke hydracom and start downloading into your download
     drawer. Put this in to the "Receive" field of your binary transfer
     settings.

     run hydracom device %p speed %b line %c nocarrier rec %> send %m

     This will also invoke hydracom. First you will be asked to select
     the files to send, then hydracom will transmit them. Put this into
     the "Send" field of your binary transfer settings.

     `term' runs these commands in synchronous fashion, this is why the
     "run" command is necessary above. Hydracom needs to interface to
     `term' while it is running and not currently waiting for the
     command to complete its task. Aside from the fact that commands
     are executed in synchronous fashion, they are started just as if
     you would invoke them using the "Execute AmigaDOS command..."
     function.

    Fixed a security hole in the review buffer processing code.
     Previously, the review buffer window could easily lock up when
     receiving new data.

    Rewrote most of the carrier tracking code. If the carrier is lost
     during a file transfer `term' will now properly notice that it is
     no longer online and run through the usual cleanup procedures.

    More changes to the file transfer settings; for each protocol you
     use you can now define a specific signature. If `term' sees this
     signature in the input data stream it will automatically invoke the
     protocol in question. The exception is the default protocol which
     is handled a bit differently. There is no distinction between an
     upload and a download protocol, since this is how the default
     protocol works. If the default protocol is an XPR library the
     library will be open all the time. Whenever the default protocol
     is invoked, you will be prompted to select the transfer type (text
     or binary as usual). For auto-activating XPR protocols the
     signatures will probably be ignored.

     IMPORTANT: If you are using the Z-Modem auto-upload feature you
     *MUST* invoke the transfer settings and pick the send signature
     for the default protocol. Click on the select button at the right
     side of the "Signature" text entry field. From the list that pops
     up select "Z-Modem" and save your settings back to disk. If you
     fail to do so, Z-Modem auto-uploads will *NOT* work.

     The signatures are scanned in the following order:

     Default protocol (upload)   Default protocol (download)   ASCII
     upload   ASCII download   Text upload   Text download   Binary
     upload   Binary download

     This means that if you use the same signature for the Default
     protocol and the Binary upload then the Default protocol will be
     invoked.

     For now, there are only three signatures built into the program
     that can be picked from a list: Z-Modem, Hydra and QuickB. QuickB
     really is not a true signature since it consists only of the ENQ
     character. Please note that different built-in signature lists
     will be presented for the upload and download settings.

     For xprzmodem.library it only makes sense to use the upload
     signature.  Starting with v2.0 the library will always filter out
     the download signature and start the download process all on its
     own.

     Hydra is a bit of a problem as it uses the same signature both for
     uploads and downloads. Take care; if things don't work as they
     should it may be better to delete the Hydra signature.

     And before I forget to mention it: the signatures are entered in
     the (hopefully) familiar command sequence syntax, e.g. ^X stands
     for Control+X and \\ stands for \.

    The "\c <Menu name>" control sequence now checks if the menu
     function it is about to call is enabled.

    Even more changes to the file transfer settings; I moved some data
     from the misc settings over here. However, this beta version does
     not move your misc settings values over into the transfer settings.
     You need to to this manually.

    Renamed "Overwrite warning" to "Protective mode". Now this is what
     it does: in every situation (overwriting files, clearing the
     buffer, quitting the program, releasing the serial device driver,
     choosing a file/drawer/program) `term' now runs a test to see if
     either the settings are valid or asks if the user really wants to
     do what he is about to do (it's not that we don't trust you).
     Using the "Protective mode" switch you can turn off all those
     sanity checks.

    Added another two terminal emulation control sequences for "ANSI"
     compliance.

    The menu "Wait" command requester can now be closed with a single
     keystroke.

    The program now uses special magic to make sure that all AmigaDOS
     and ARexx programs started receive proper search paths.

    The button labels "|<", "<", ">" and ">|" have been replaced by
     proper glyphs.

    The code to build the command line for external transfer protocols
     did not handle empty strings correctly. It does now.

    The Hydracom example invocation commands listed in the previous
     section of this document were not correct. If you are using this
     protocol, please update the command lines as described in the
     previous section.

    Any requester that shows just a single "Continue" button can now
     be closed with a single keystroke.

    The status window now properly displays the name of the currently
     connected BBS.

    Slight changes and enhancements to the user interface code.

    String gadgets are now properly aligned in columns in the path
     and command settings editors.

    The prescrolling/jump scrolling code now gets `out of the way' if
     the background colour is currently nonzero.

    Slightly improved low-memory stability, especially during the
     initial setup procedure.

    The "You don't have RTS/CTS handshaking enabled..." request now
     enables RTS/CTS handshaking with DSR checking if the user decides
     so.

    The emulation pen selection now supports public screens again.
     Please note that the implementation is not perfect (which was the
     primary reason for disabling it in v4.2) and may not work properly
     when using the keyboard to pick the colours, i.e.  keystroke
     activation may produce unexpected results.

    Added new tooltype/shell argument to specify the language the
     program is to use.

    Some of the settings windows are now resizable. Please tell me if
     this causes any problems. The code is still a bit weird, for
     example some window sizes can cause the gadgets to overlap the
     window borders by one or two pixels.

    Small changes to the user interface code. Fixed the notorious
     double-click bug.

    The AmigaUW terminal resizing code would get invoked before the
     internal lines/columns variables were set up properly, causing the
     display to get messed up. This has been fixed.

    When invoking an external file transfer protocol the program now
     checks if the file name given refers to an ARexx script (it reads
     the first 256 characters and looks for the comment that identifies
     an ARexx script), a plain AmigaDOS script (it takes a look at the
     script file attribute) and eventually accepts the program name as
     it is. If a file is identified as being a script file it receives
     special treatment.

    Added another friendly reminder in case the user has enabled the
     "Connect auto-baud" switch. Apparently, a lot of users have this
     switch enabled without really knowing what it does and will get
     into real trouble when making a connection.

    The chat line now gets activated when invoked via menu.

    When failing to allocate enough colours for the terminal window
     `term' now falls back to four colour mode.

    Rewrote the dialer (again). If you press skip/abort it will now
     do what it should do rather than ignoring your commands.  The
     original serial configuration also gets properly restored if the
     dialer fails to make a connection. Various nice side effects are
     included. For example, if in waiting state pressing the abort
     button immediately exits.

    After finding out that the window resizing code did not work
     properly in programs derived from the review buffer window
     handling code I gave the original resizing routine another rewrite.

    The ARexx "SEND" command now sports a new "LITERAL" option.  With
     this option the text to send will be transmitted literally, no
     embedded command sequences or special characters will be evaluated.

    The chat line text entry field no longer filters control
     characters, even if you enabled this feature in the IControl
     system preferences editor.

    The text buffer screen could hang when choosing to clear the
     buffer contents from the menu. This has been fixed.

    The colour remapping that usually took place only in two colour
     mode (which tries to avoid mapping the same colour to text
     background and foreground) now also gets applied in four and eight
     colour modes. Previously, it would ignore the colour mode the user
     had chosen and just take a look at the depth of the screen the
     program was using. This could cause all kinds of trouble when
     running on a 256 colour public screen.

    When running on its own public screen with a window border `term'
     could crash if there were still visitor windows open on the public
     screen.

    `term' now opens screens as large as possible if the screen
     settings indicate a specific screen size, but the user has no
     means to change them. In previous program releases you would get
     whatever was found in the screen settings, even if you didn't have
     asl.library v38 or higher handy to change the dimensions.

    The xON/xOFF handling code works a bit differently now. If you
     have the "Internal xON/xOFF handling" switch enabled in the serial
     settings `term' will now go into `holding' state when you press
     Control+S (= xON). To return to normal operation, press Control+Q
     (= xOFF). If the "Pass xON/xOFF through" switch is enabled, both
     xON/xOFF characters will be sent through to the remote, otherwise
     `term' will swallow them. The big difference between this handling
     and the old style of doing things is that `term' will no longer
     drop into `holding' state when receiving an xON character from the
     remote. The only way to bring `term' into `holding' state is by
     pressing Control+S.

    The chat line now passes control characters and function key
     macros through to the main program as you type them, i.e. they
     will not show up in the text you type. The Tab key is special; if
     pressed, the tab character will be passed through to the main
     program. If you press Control+I the character will show up in the
     chat line.

    Added a shortcut to select between pulse dialing and tone
     dialing. This requires that your dial prefix or suffix command
     includes the special command sequence \W. This sequence will
     translate into P for pulse dialing and into T for tone dialing. So
     in order to take advantage of this feature, you should change your
     dialing command to ATD\W and select the dialing mode you want.
     Please note that the dial mode option will be disabled if there is
     no \W in the dial prefix and dial suffix.

    The default serial and modem setups are a bit different now.  As
     always, the program first tries to read the global system serial
     settings and converts them if necessary. If RTS/CTS handshaking is
     enabled, it now enables the RTS/CTS handshaking mode with DSR test
     in order to avoid lockups. If the serial settings could not be
     read the default setup now is 19,200 baud, 8-N-1 and RTS/CTS
     handshaking with DSR checking. The modem settings no longer
     include "ATZ\r" as the modem init command, the dial prefix now
     reads "ATD\W" and the default dial mode is tone dialing.

    The default screen display mode settings are now taken from the
     default public screen.

    Added another friendly reminder that is displayed whenever you
     upgrade from an older program release or start the program for the
     first time. The reminder will be displayed every time you start
     the program until you save the program settings.

    Pasting the current clipboard contents now optionally converts
     line feed characters into carriage returns (there is a new option
     in the clipboard settings for this purpose).

    `term' used to fake an immediate XPR abort by returning a read
     error in xpr_sread() in case the user had pressed the abort
     button. This really should not be necessary, I just rewrote the
     code to abort the read prematurely and to return whatever came in
     so far. This implies the hope that the protocol will eventually
     drop into xpr_chkabort() and find out what's cooking.

    The chat line now gets properly redrawn even if the status line
     is currently turned off or sitting in a separate window.

    When copying the contents of the screen to the clipboard `term'
     now converts alien IBM characters into ISO characters. This is a)
     required for the IFF FTXT format in which text gets stored in the
     clipboard and b) no longer causes invalid data to show up in the
     output stream when pasting the contents of the clipboard.  Put
     another way, in earlier releases the IBM style characters would go
     unmodified into the buffer. When pasting the clipboard contents,
     they would then get `converted' into IBM style characters as
     `term' always expected ISO characters to be found in the clipboard
     (garbage in -> even more garbage out). Nasty, isn't it?  Thanks go
     to Stephen Bowman for telling me about the problem.

    Under some circumstances the text buffer would get the text font
     width all wrong, causing characters to be left behind when
     scrolling the page. This has been fixed.

    Cleaned up gtlayout.library for release, window resizing now works
     a tad better, although the visual effects are not quite that
     striking. But then perhaps they are striking, which is why they
     haven't returned to work yet.

    `term' also takes care of the screen size now when falling back
     to a usable screen mode. This should cure the notorious "half
     height screen" problem.

    The cancel button now does what it should do in the date panel and
     the modem panel.

    Changed the way how colours are assigned to drawing pens if the
     selected colours cannot be displayed. The previous method only made
     sure that there is no black text on a black background, the changes
     now also take care of white text on white background.

    More changes to the XPR abort handling code; the first request to
     cancel the transmission while xpr_sread() is being executed now
     properly follows the rules of how to do things (it stops the read
     request prematurely and gives the protocol a chance to call
     xpr_chkabort() and to eventually find out what the user wanted).
     If you hit cancel again it will - as `term' used to do in previous
     releases - abort the read request, send a bunch of CAN characters
     and return with an error. Martin Berndt suggested this.

    I know some of you won't like it, but the following settings
     editors are now `paged' to save much space: serial, modem, screen,
     terminal, emulation, capture and transfer. The nice thing about
     the new look is that it allows me to save on something else:
     cryptic abbreviations.

    Discovered some old code left over from prehistoric program
     releases.  The local museum wasn't interested, so I just discarded
     it.  Unfortunately, the total program size did not drop sharply
     after I did so.

    Whoops, the sound settings editor did not check for `empty'
     strings and could tell you that it was unable to locate the file
     "".

    The picker button of the "Help file" text editing field in the
     path panel now does what it should do.

    More changes to gtlayout.library, it now respects the window
     bottom border size gadget and allows the Tab key to be used for
     cycling through paged settings editors.

    The clipboard and paths settings editors are now paged.

    In paged settings editors, pressing the Tab key cycles through
     the pages.

    Shortened the english friendly startup reminder message so it
     fits on NTSC screens.

    When starting up for the first time, `term' no longer complains
     about missing DSR signals or notifies the user that RTS/CTS
     handshaking should be enabled. This is done in order to avoid
     confusion, the reminders and messages will follow later when the
     user makes the first changes and saves them to disk.

    The XPR transfer window no longer warns about files not fitting on
     filing system which look suspiciously like ram disks, i.e. are not
     clearly identified as block mapped filing systems.

Changes introduced with v4.2:

    Did not set up serial parameter correctly (nasty, those typos!).

    HydraCom could cause `term' to hang upon startup.

    Increased the width of all the integer gadgets in the rates
     settings panel.

    Incrementer arrows did not work properly in all settings panels,
     this was due to a bug in the SAS/C optimizer which caused
     gtlayout.library to run into trouble.

    When called from the phonebook, the "Standard" button as shown by
     the translation table settings panel will cause the translation
     settings to be reset to standard values.

    Text stored in the buffer did not get bit 7 stripped if this
     feature was enabled in the serial settings.

    New look slider gadgets (requires gtlayout.library v5).

    Numerous bug fixes in the user interface support library.

    Rewrote the text buffer capture routines, there should no longer
     be extra, unwanted data in the buffer.

    Fixed the overly wide incrementer arrow bug which caused so much
     trouble in previous releases.

    Reloading the fast macros when making a new connection did not
     update the fast macro window.

    In the area codes editor, creating a new entry and moving it
     around no longer leads to unexpected results.

    There was a typo in the source code which prevented the EOL
     translation settings from getting changed via ARexx.

    For a phonebook entry dialed, the startup and login macros are
     now executed in sequence rather than in parallel.

    New capture settings options "Convert characters": if enabled
     along with the capture filter, text stored in the text buffer and
     the capture file will be converted into proper ISO characters.
     This effectively discards unprintable IBM font style characters.
     Note that this option will do nothing if you are using the standard
     text font rather than the IBM text font. Also keep in mind that
     this special text filter will always be enabled for printer
     captures in order to avoid nasty side-effects. The text and review
     buffers will no longer use the IBM PC style font if this option is
     in effect.

    In the emulation settings you will find a new switch labeled
     "Lock wrapping" which will let you lock the current line wrapping
     mode so that application software and terminal resets will no
     longer modify it.

    Added another two `lock' options. Now you can choose to lock the
     current text colour and the text rendering style. Take care, the
     `Reset styles' and `Reset terminal' options will no longer change
     colour and style once they are locked.

    Made sure that interleaved screens work properly. They do now.
     If you still see text scrolled or erased plane by plane you're
     either hallucinating or you have the PICASSO monitor driver
     installed which has the systemwide effect of making the operating
     system ignore requests to use interleaved bitmaps.

     Closer examination has revealed that the interleaved bitmap stuff
     did not work properly when using Kickstart v2.04. In fact,
     Kickstart v3.0 is the first operating system release which fully
     supports interleaved bitmaps for all graphics rendering calls.
     Previous releases did not take advantage of them, even if set up
     properly. Sorry folks, you won't be able to use this feature under
     Kickstart v2.04 any more: I removed the necessary support routines.

    Added pen and text attribute translation. In the emulation
     settings you will find an option to select nonstandard pens.  In
     this case, these pens refer to the terminal emulation rendering
     pens and text attributes.

    Tweaked the terminal emulation parser to swallow the Amiga
     specific commands to turn the cursor on or off (aSCR).

    The device/library selection now also includes ROM-resident
     modules. At least one multiserial board includes a driver in its
     ROM rather than on disk. In older releases, this particular driver
     did not show up in the list, causing users to believe their boards
     to be damaged.

    Changed the audio channel allocation priority. In previous
     program releases the channels could be stolen, causing `term' to
     hang or crash. Now it's DeliTracker to break down, not `term' ;-)

    Cloning a phonebook entry did not duplicate the corresponding
     transfer settings. This has been fixed.

    The serial settings now sport an additional OwnDevUnit control
     switch. You can now choose to ignore requests to release the
     serial device driver or to have the device released, causing
     `term' to check in intervals of 4 seconds if the device has become
     available again. The default behaviour (the device driver is
     released) is still supported.

    There is another sound options, called `Error sound'. `term' will
     play this sound if a certain number of transfer errors have
     occured. The number of errors to occur can also be set in the
     transfer settings editor.

    You can now select when the file transfer routines should notify
     you. You can be notified both at the beginning and the end of the
     transfer, just at the beginning, just at the end or even never.

    The program no longer reports phone rates after losing a
     connection if there is no sensible data to report.

    The "WAIT" command did apparently pay attention to the case of
     characters passed in when scanning the wait list for matching
     entries. This has been fixed.

    For some strange reasons, the VT-100 supplementary graphics
     character set never got loaded. This has been fixed.

    Rewrote the status line display code (yet again). When running on
     a custom screen you probably won't see any difference, but: open
     `term' on a public screen and watch your system performance. No
     more deadlocks, no more sluggish mouse movements, no more CPU
     hogging. The display window is a bit larger, but this hopefully
     won't be a problem. After all, the window mode is usable now.  The
     old BOOPSI code is gone and will probably never return. The new
     code is in many ways quite a bit nicer than the old code. For
     example, it is synchronized with the window size changes. As soon
     as the terminal adapts itself to the new window size, so does the
     status line display.

    The review buffer window text rendering colours would also get
     set to some value when opening the program on a custom screen. It
     now leaves the text colour untouched in this case.

    The main window position is now saved along with the main
     settings.

    Finally added the one-line chat text entry field which surely is
     no replacement for the packet window, but nevertheless I hope at
     least some folks will find it useful. No split-screen chat yet,
     sorry.

    The `dial number' requester now remembers phone numbers between
     calls.

    The quick dial menu now gets disabled if the modem is online.

    The ASCII transfer menu items no longer get disabled if the
     internal transfer routines are selected and the XPR ascii transfer
     lib names are blank.

    Updated the font selection code for text and review buffer
     displays. The review buffer now runs as a Process, so it can open
     disk resident fonts if it needs to.

    Fixed a few bugs in the SETATTR ARexx command.

    Auto-expanding control panels, such as the phonebook and the file
     transfer window no longer obscure the status line display.

    The program now properly pays attention to the number of lines to
     use for the terminal display. Thanks go to Russ for his
     persistence ;-)

    In monochrome mode text is no longer printed in inverse video
     mode.

    The screen settings editor now allows you to change the colour
     mode even if `term' is running on a public screen.

Changes introduced with v4.1:

    Fixed an Enforcer hit in gtlayout.library caused by the text
     gadget handling code.

    If possible child windows are now opened within the bounds of
     their parent windows.

    Fixed an Enforcer hit caused by the ARexx interface building
     dialing lists.

    Reordered the parameters of the "ADDITEM" ARexx interface command.

    Rewrote the entire data capturing process. I somewhat opened a
     can of worms, making it necessary to rewrite the code that handles
     the translations for the "Receive CR as..." and "Receive LF as..."
     options as well. Careful please, although I am sure the code works
     correctly I may have knocked over some china cups.

    Added some more safety catches to the upload queue handling.
     Using the auto-upload panel with the upload queue could leave you
     locked out, blocking `term'. Generally, not a very nice thing to
     do. Under the same conditions the code will now fall back to
     presenting the standard file requesters.

    Fixed a bug in the capture panel which could turn up if the
     editor was invoked from the phonebook.

    Corrected some few typos in the english user interface text.

    Turning off script recording did not reset the program status to
     `ready'. This has been fixed.

    Heaven knows why, but v4.0 did not permit changing the screen
     colours if running in monochrome mode.

    The `Freeze buffer' menu now properly toggles the state of the
     capture buffer.

    The terminal settings now take the maximum possible values into
     account when setting the selection ranges for the number of
     columns and lines.

    When using a startup script or a startup command the program no
     longer displays its `about' window on program startup.

    The ARexx command "GOONLINE" now sets up some more of status
     variables than it used to do in v4.0.

    Upon startup the carrier signal is checked (provided your serial
     configuration says that the carrier should be checked) and if it
     is present the online timer is started.

    Added a bunch more of serial baud rates. Don't overdo it, a
     standard Amiga won't go faster than 115K baud.

    Replaced the serial rate slider with an integer gadget featuring
     incrementer arrows. Clicking on the arrows will cycle through all
     standard baud rates. Note: requires gtlayout.library 1.97 or
     higher.

    When offline detecting a carrier signal will bring `term' into
     online state, provided the `Check carrier' flag is enabled in the
     serial settings.

    ^Q now works again.

    The end-of-line character translation scheme was changed into one
     single unified concept. Both carriage return and line feed
     characters can now be translated into <cr>, <lf>, <lf><cr>,
     <cr><lf> or can be ignored.

    The phone rates management is moving from the individual phone
     book entries into a separate global settings editor.  The old
     rates management style will continue to work, but the new
     management scheme has priority over it.

     Here is how the new scheme works: you now assign the rates
     accounting data to area codes rather than to single phone book
     entries. Suppose you want a special set of rates settings to be
     used for all phone book entries and phone numbers which start with
     the area code "009". In this case you would add another group
     entry, assign a name to it and put "009#?" into the pattern field.
     The next time `term' makes a connection to a phone number starting
     with the digits "009" the corresponding rates settings will be
     used. `term' scans the list top-down, so the default settings
     should be put into the last list entry.  The patterns follow the
     AmigaDOS syntax.

    Finally discovered why so many old phonebook files would cause
     trouble: the internal conversion routine was *never* called.

    Horrors! The sound.datatype saves invalid sound files with the
     playback size set to zero, causing `term' to crash with a
     `division by zero' error. The replay routine now handles such odd
     files.

    The sliders for redial delay and time to connect now finally
     sport a resolution of a single second rather than ten seconds.

    Shortened gadget labels & texts and rearranged the gadget layout
     to make sure all windows will fit on a plain 640 x 400 sized screen
     with topaz/8. Sorry folks, 640 x 200 is right out of the question.
     These are the days of miracle and wonder and all modern Amiga
     hardware is capable of displaying screens this size in
     non-interlaced modes.  If things still don't seem to fit try a
     different font, preferably proportional-spaced, or a different
     screen resolution (change the overscan size if necessary).

    Whilst reworking the documentation discovered that I forgot to
     add the `Alert' control to the terminal panel.

    With Workbench v2.04 the screen mode requester automatically
     resets the screen size and overscan values to defaults.

    The text buffer search requester now sports another option,
     "Whole words only".

    The jump scroll option code had a control switch set in the
     `wrong direction'. Nothing serious, `term' would only scroll too
     many lines.

    The jump scrolling routines did not take the size and position of
     the currently active scroll region into account. This could knock
     out the emulation since the cursor could cross the legal position
     limits.

    Added some more control key codes as per the VT 220 Programmer
     Pocket Guide, such as ^2, ^3, ^4, ^5, ^[, ^/, ^].

    Fixed another bug that would cause `term' to busy loop if it
     stumbled upon a non-printable character in IBM PC style font mode.

    `term' now supports context-sensitive help with AmigaGuide v34.
     I finally discovered a set of AmigaGuide commands that would not
     crash when told to change the currently displayed context.

    Changing XEM options will save them back to disk.

    Rewrote the hangup/carrier lost/online/offline handling
     procedure. The online/offline status tracking is protected by
     semaphores now, the code to modify the status was reduced to a
     great deal, it's only in termDial.c, termARexxCommands.c and in
     termMain.c. The hang up command and carrier lost actions now go
     through the same code, i.e. backup config & redial on logoff now
     work both for logoff & hangup.

    The phone rates accounting by area codes did not work since the
     routines were commented out. I removed the comments, they should
     work now.

    The buffer management no longer collapses if you try to clear the
     contents while there is still data coming in.

    Reread the "VT 220 Programmer Pocket Guide" and added most of the
     remaining unsupported control sequences. Not supported are the
     programmable function keys and data transfers bracketed by
     DCS..ST. A number of control sequences are still no-ops, such as
     the national/multinational font support operations.

    Double-clicking on a phonebook entry with no phone number
     attached no longer starts dialing.

    Changed numeric keypad applications mode and PF key handling.  I
     hope it works with all keymappings now.

    Cloning a rates settings entry did not properly duplicate all
     data associated with the original entry.

    Creating a new phonebook entry will set the rates accounting data
     connected with it to zeroes.

    Rewrote the prescrolling/jump scrolling support code which now
     should get the job more quickly than before.

    Resetting the terminal emulation no longer clears the state of
     the `Wrap cursor moves' option.

    Rewrote and simplified serial I/O processing, I hope it still
     works.

    Dialing commands no longer make it into the text buffer.

    The `Cancel' button in the phonebook panel was relabeled, now
     showing `Use' instead.

    The program no longer puts the upload queue icon into the
     Workbench window by default, there is a new option to turn it off.

    You can finally edit all the settings to be changed in the
     phonebook, this includes function keys, cursor keys, translation
     tables and fast macros. Hold down either shift key to bring up the
     old file requesters. Note that you will also get the old file
     requesters if something goes wrong reading and setting up the
     settings data.

    Added an option to make a hardcopy of the screen contents,
     invoking the printer graphics dump function.

    All the windows sporting pull-down menus now support menu help,
     i.e.  if you press the help key while a menu item is being
     selected `term' will bring up the online help page for the
     corresponding menu.

    Duplicating a phonebook entry now properly duplicates the
     corresponding rates settings.

    Added new keyboard shortcuts to the phonebook controls. Pressing
     `Del' untags the currently selected entry, `Shift+Del' untags all
     entries.

    `term' now looks up the "Fonts" and "Libs" drawers in the current
     directory and adds them to the "Fonts:" and "Libs:" assignment
     list.  At least for me, this greatly simplifies the installation
     procedure.  Just copy the contents of all distribution archives
     into a single drawer and let `term' do the rest.

    The fast! macro button list now properly responds to Alt+Amiga
     key clicks. I also thinned out the code a bit, causing the buttons
     to render a little faster.

    Relabeled the button in the bottom left corner of the phonebook
     window again. It now reads "Close".

    The buffer search requesters are now non-modal so you can have
     them open and continue to use the text buffer display.

    I reworked some parts of the user interface, trying to clarify
     the functions of menus and buttons. I also removed some redundant
     button labels and changed all references to `directories' to
     `drawers'.

    Shortened the button labels for the phonebook and the rate panel,
     so they will finally fit on a 640 x 400 screen using topaz/8.
     Some button labels now look fairly obscure, sorry about that.  I
     guess I'll rething the part about the "clarification" again...

    More weird & wonderful changes to the serial device interface
     code. I hope it still works.

    When hanging up the line using the corresponding menu command the
     online state is no longer reset to `offline' if in the serial
     settings the "Check carrier" feature is enabled. This leaves the
     test for the carrier to the usual routines which will detect if
     the carrier is really gone.

    With multi-number phonebook entries the dialer now displays how
     many of these numbers have been dialed already.

    There was something really wrong with the way clipboard text was
     pasted as the `end of line' character conversion would be applied
     twice.

    The "Time to connect" data was never used for phone rates
     accounting, it only played a minor role in the "Connect limit"
     settings.

    The pop-up `About' window no longer is GimmeZeroZero, which is
     both sexy and uses less memory.

    Beep & action sounds are now loaded via datatypes if available.
     Under v39 this may not work well for large sound files due to a
     bug in sound.datatype. Plain IFF-8SVX format sound files will
     still be played using the built-in routines since they are more
     flexible than sound.datatype and can replay stereo sound.

    Non-standard-sized system imagery (sizing gadgets, arrow gadgets,
     etc.) is now supported whereever it is used.

    The phonebook window no longer sports a `Close' button, all that's
     left is the `Dial...' button.

    Phonebook entries which lack a phone number can no longer be used
     for the dialing list.

  Changes introduced with v4.0: 

    The window status line is no longer `misplaced' under Kickstart
     v2.x.

    Font, file and screen requesters are no longer quite so tiny.

    Different font scales as by the VT-100 specs (half width, double
     width, top double size, bottom double size) work again.

    All memory allocations now go through memory pools, reducing
     memory fragmentation greatly. Note: Kickstart 3.x owners *should*
     have SetPatch 40.16 installed as the memory pool code might have
     trouble freeing empty memory pools until the program exits.  This
     memory allocation scheme should also help to get `term' to work
     with certain virtual memory system extensions.

    In the XPR transfer window the error/message list will no longer
     hold more than 100 entries in order to save memory. I have received
     reports of users who ran large file transfers overnight and when
     getting up in the next morning the transfer error/message list had
     accumulated so much memory it was no longer possible to move the
     mouse: Intuition was unable to allocate enough memory to create new
     input events. If 100 messages have accumulated and a new one is
     about to be added the first and oldest entry will be removed.

    The status line display now properly reflects the name of the
     current file transfer protocol.

    The quick dial menu checkmarks would get cleared only on some
     rare occasions, i.e. if the first phonebook entry had the `Quick
     dial menu' feature set. Now it gets the job done no matter which
     phonebook entry is the first one in the quick dial menu.

    The main window menus used to have the command shortcut `W'
     assigned twice.

    If running on the Workbench dropping icons on the `term' window
     would ask for the type of file transfer (text or binary), but it
     would get the selection wrong, i.e. if you chose text you got a
     binary upload and the other way round. This has been fixed.

    When in zoomed state the XPR transfer window will display the
     name of the file currently being transferred and how much of it
     has already been transferred (if available). This display will be
     updated about once a second.

    If icons are to be created for files downloaded it is no longer
     necessary to turn on file type identification to actually get the
     icons attached.

    Freezing the text buffer contents now properly updates the text
     processing routine variables.

    Calling the `Print clipboard' function twice will no longer
     result in a general system lockup.

    The double-buffered I/O routines now let you configure the buffer
     size to use. The memory allocation also is a lot more `forgiving'
     than it used to be: if necessary it will shrink the buffer size
     until it can allocate enough space.

    To keep naughty applications from switching the cursor key and
     numeric keymap into applications mode you can lock both key sets
     now, so they will not to change their current modes.

    The old AmigaGuide release (v34 to be accurate) is supported now,
     but with limited functionality. The help text is not context
     sensitive and you need to shut down the AmigaGuide server manually
     (by closing the AmigaGuide window) if the screen its window
     resides upon is to be closed.

    `RING' and `CONNECT' messages from the modem are now reported
     along with the time when they came in.

    The program now complains loudly about outdated catalog files and
     incorrectly installed locale.library.

    The hotkey settings panel now checks each hotkey description text
     after it is entered and complains if it is unuseable.

    The `QUIET' command line option (makes `term' start up iconified)
     no longer crashes if Workbench isn't running.

    The program now features an all-new user interface.

    There is a new command line option called `BEHIND' which causes
     the main screen to stay in the background and the main window not
     to become active upon startup.

    If `term' fails to open a screen and finds out that the requested
     screen display mode is unavailable it will copy the screen mode
     the default public screen is in and retry.

    No more trouble with mixed-case device and library names.  As you
     pick them from the list the files are validated, i.e.  `term'
     tries to load the file in question and hunts for the
     library/device resident tag included. If the tag is found the
     `real' device/library name is copied from it, replacing the
     original name the file was opened with. This means that you can
     select `XPRZModem.Library' using the file requester and `term'
     will look into the file to find out that the library wants to be
     opened under the name of `xprzmodem.library'.  Also included are a
     type check (i.e. if a library is to be opened only files with a
     library type resident tag are included in the list) and a brief
     name comparison (i.e. only name case differences are allowed, so
     `XPRZModem.Library' = `xprzmodem.library', but `foo.device' !=
     `bar.device').

    The external emulation and the external protocol support routines
     no longer share the same code and the same set of error
     messages/options texts.

    A transfer protocol such as xprkermit.library will no longer
     leave `term' in a `half-dead' state if it opens a new window in
     the protocol setup phase. In previous releases this window was
     never closed.

    The label text of XPR/XEM command options which accept a
     parameter and thus cause the settings window to be closed after
     text is entered is now drawn in the current highlight colour. This
     helps to distinguish regular string gadgets and command option
     parameters.

    If `term' fails to set up the XPR protocol properly, i.e.  the
     setup routine does not flag success, the library is closed right
     away. This is how it has always been in previous `term' releases.
     But this time the main menu is also updated to keep you from
     starting a file transfer or changing the transfer options while
     the library base pointer is invalid.

    In order to support external protocols which write data to or
     read data from the serial line serial I/O processing is
     temporarily disabled while the corresponding setup routines are
     running. Although this behaviour isn't quite that nice it should
     avoid serious trouble with xprkermit.library which could otherwise
     disrupt the serial device request queue.

    There are now three buttons in the file transfer panel which
     correspond to different abort levels:

     * Skip current file   Skips just the file currently being in
     transfer (level 2)

     * Stop transfer batch   Cancels the entire batch transfer (level 1)

     * Stop entire transfer   Emergency stop (level -1)

     These abort levels are supported by xprkermit.library and a number
     of other file transfer protocols.

    Opening the transfer protocol settings editor will cause the
     currently selected default XPR protocol to be reopened in case it
     is not open yet.

    Holding down the control key and clicking with the mouse on a
     space character will now correctly send it.

    Double-clicking on a phonebook entry will no longer start dialing
     if the program is still online, i.e. if the regular `Dial' button
     is disabled.

    If the line is hung up or the carrier is lost the call log file
     (human readable, not the one that is intended for postprocessing
     using call log analyzers) will include the costs for the call. In
     previous releases `term' would only look for the `NO CARRIER'
     message.

    The destructive backspace option now removes the character to the
     left of the cursor but does not move the rest of the line one step
     to the left. This makes the terminal emulation behaviour more
     consistent with how real video terminals handle this job.

    The translation table settings panel now features a `Default'
     button which resets the current translation settings to defaults.

    Just like the text buffer screen the review buffer window is
     handled by a coprocess now.

    The packet window now supports function keys.

    For technical reasons I dropped the string gadget clipboard
     support. I suggest that you use StringClip or a similar program
     instead.

    Clipboard pasting from the review buffer window no longer
     requires that you activate the main window.

    In the phonebook the edit list (right hand side listview display)
     indicates whether an entry uses default settings or whether it
     actually uses custom settings. Custom settings are indicated by
     asterisks (`*').

    The packet window now uses the current terminal text font.

    Pressing Amiga+- in the packet window no longer transmits the
     current string but changes to the main window while leaving the
     current string intact.

    Fixed a potential bug in the generic list management module.

    With some file requester patches installed, such as old ReqTools
     or MFR, the file requester code could fail to notice if a single
     file was selected in multiselect mode.

    The phone rates are now reported according to the current locale
     settings, i.e. they take the grouping and special attributes of
     the local currency into account.

    The IFF-8SVX sound file player code now handles stereo and
     compressed sound files gracefully (all flavours including
     uncompressed stereo, compressed stereo, uncompressed mono and
     compressed mono).

    The ARexx `WAIT' command could fail to report how many characters
     it pulled from the data stream when a matching string was found.

     This could result in random characters showing up in the terminal
     text output.
