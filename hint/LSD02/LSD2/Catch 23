                                CATCH 23

Typed in by CHUCKLES . Edited by PARASITE.


YOUR MISSION
     Intelligence  reports and satellite pictures have  confirmed
the worst - enemy's CK23 orbital interceptor is operational. Able
to  take  off  and  land  like  any  conventional  aircraft,  the
revolutionary   CK23   is  also  able  to  escape   the   earth's
gravitational  pull and then achieve geo-stationary orbit in  any
specific location. There it can lie in wait, for weeks at a time,
ready  to blast back into the atmosphere at frightening speed  to
intercept  and  destroy  enemy  missiles  or  aircraft  with  its
sophisticated missile and laser weaponry.

      The CK23 test development site is the most secret  military
complex  on  earth.  Hidden somewhere on a  mountainous  and  now
deserted  island,  it is surrounded by  deadly  minefields,  high
voltage  electric  fences and surveillance  cameras.  The  island
itself  is  bristling with military  activity,  from  armed  foot
patrols to roaming lethal armoured vehicles.

     It is your mission to explore the island and find the  heart
of the development complex.  Once there you must steal the design
of  the  CK23  and  then set a time delay  bomb  in  the  nuclear
reactor.  The  explosion which follows will devastate the  entire
island.

     At  the  start of the game,  you have just been  dropped  by
parachute.  Where you actually land will depend on the prevailing
wind.  The  time is 2200 hours.  Sunrise is at 0600  hours.  This
gives you just eight hours to complete your mission.

THE ISLAND
     The island is a small island some 400 miles from the nearest
mainland.  Despite this,  it once supported a thriving  community
who  made their living by fishing the well stocked local  waters.
This  community however,  has now been evacuated and the  several
scattered  villages  are virtually ghost  towns.  The  island  is
mostly  flat  windswept heathland,  but there is  the  occasional
forest and marsh. There are also mysterious mountains.

SHUTTLES
     Whilst  the enemy were building the  military  complex,  the
villages  were occupied by the civilian workforce.  To assist  in
rapid transport,  a shuttle network was built that  criss-crossed
the island.  The shuttles run automatically from one location  to
another.  By  switching shuttles,  it is possible to cover  large
distances quickly, but unfortunately your map shows only a few of
the  principle  shuttle routes.  It is not possible  to  leave  a
shuttle in transit.

BUILDINGS
     The island contains a large variety of building types.  Most
of the buildings have been sealed by the military,  but not  all.
It  is still possible to enter and explore those which have  been
overlooked.  Buildings  that  you  can enter  will  have  clearly
visible doors.

     Once  inside  a  building it will be  possible  for  you  to
identify its contents.  You may also find batteries for the  mine
detector, explosives for making bombs and spare ammunition clips.
It is worth making a record of buildings which can be visited  to
obtain  fresh  supplies of these vital  items.  There  are  other
things for you to discover about some of these buildings.

MILITARY ACTIVITY
     The  island  is  subjected to an  unusually  high  level  of
military activity,  a further indication of the military  complex
sensitivity.

     (a) Armoured Vehicle Patrol (AV)
     These AV have set patrol routes.  They will not deviate from
these  routes unless they spot an intruder.  Your image  enhancer
allows  you to see armoured vehicles from a distance  from  which
they are unable to see you.  However, they move more quickly than
you, and a close encounter is usually fatal.

     (b) Foot Patrol
     These  are  heavily  armed and,  like  you  they  have  been
equipped  with capable image enhancers.  If you run into  a  foot
patrol and they see you it is too late to think of running  away.
Being accurate and quick on the trigger is the only way you  will
survive the inevitable shoot out.

MINEFIELDS
     The island has a number of areas which have been mined.  You
have been equipped with a mine detector which,  if the  batteries
are not flat,  will relay a signal to your head-up  display.  Any
mines in your field of vision will be clearly visible to you. The
enemy have used proximity mines. If you get too close to one, its
effect will be swift and lethal.

SIGHTLESS IMAGE ENHANCER (SIE)
     The  parachute  drop has been scheduled to coincide  with  a
moonless  night.  You have been equipped with an  advanced  image
enhancer  which  shows  an accurate 3-D  representation  of  your
"world" as you move within it.  The SIE also has a  sophisticated
head-up display which provides you with a constant update on your
status and situation.

_________________________________________________________________

     (a) Zone
     The  island  has  been divided into fourteen  zones  by  the
occupying military forces.

     (b) Time
     Your parachute drop has been timed for 2200 hours.

     (c) Patrol Warning
     If  an armoured vehicle is nearby a condition GREEN  warning
sign  will appear in this space.  If the enemy  spots  you,  this
warning will become condition RED.  As soon as the AV can get you
in its sights,  you will be destroyed.  Your only hope is to  try
and run away.

     (d) Vision
     Displays a 3-D image of your field of vision.  The range  of
the SIE is approximately 100 meters.  You will not be able to see
anything beyond that distance. There are a large number of things
you  may  see but some objects you need to be able  to  recognise
straight away are:-

     (i) Enemy Mines
     Only detectable if your batteries are not flat.  (Looks like
a pyramid with an antenna at the top.)

     (11) Shuttle Stops
     (Looks like a kite with a tail.)

     (111) Your Own Bombs
     (Looks like a pyramid.)

     (iv) Computer Terminal/transmitter
     (Looks like a UFO with two legs.)

     (v) Any Object in a Room
     (Looks like a square waste paper basket)

     (e) BOMBS
     You  can carry a maximum of three bombs.  Each bomb is  made
from  explosives,  a detonator and a timing device.  You have  an
unlimited   supply  of  detonators  and  timers,   but  to   make
replacement   bombs  you  must  find  buildings   which   contain
explosives used by the civilian workforce to quarry for  building
materials.
     You can use a bomb for a variety of purposes.
  i. To destroy buildings.
 ii. As a mine to destroy armoured vehicles.
iii. To create a diversion.

     (f) Spare Gun Clips
     You  can carry a maximum of three.  With the one  fitted  to
your rifle,  this only gives you twenty available shots.  Try  to
avoid  being trigger happy,  therefore.  Spare gun clips  can  be
found inside most buildings.

     (g) Mine Detector Battery Status
     If flat,  your head-up display will not detect enemy  mines.
Spare batteries can be found in some buildings.

     (h) Compass Direction Indicators
     Displays the direction you are facing.  Can also be used  to
lock  onto the location from which radio transmissions are  being
made.  The direction to the transmitter you have detected will be
displayed in red.

     (i) Message Panel
     This displays text information, Your current score will also
be displayed every time you add to it.

DANGEROMETER
     This  important  panel  displays a  measure  of  the  danger
associated with your current location.
     If  it is high,  the likelihood of your encountering a  foot
patrol  is also high.  For example,  if you set off a bomb  in  a
particular area,  soldiers are likely to rush to investigate what
happened.  Hence your Dangerometer will be high.  However, if you
are elusive,  and keep a low profile, soldiers are less likely to
patrol your immediate area.
     By strategic planning it is possible to reduce the danger in
an  area you need to go to,  by leaving a time delay mine  in  an
adjoining  area.   When  this  goes  off,   soldiers  rushing  to
investigate this diversion will leave your area at a lower danger
level.
     Keep a close eye on your Dangerometer and trying to discover
what affects it, is of immense importance.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
     As  well as the civilian workforce,  the enemy  recruited  a
large  number  of  technicians and scientists to  help  with  the
development of the CK23.  Very few of these people were recruited
willingly,  most  having  been blackmailed,  threatened  or  even
kidnapped whilst attending a bogus conference.
     Unknown  to  the  enemy,   seventeen  of  these   scientists
organised themselves into a highly effective resistance movement,
determined to sabotage the enemy's plans. Unfortunately they were
discovered  and  were all evacuated.  There whereabouts  are  not
known.
     However,  intelligence sources have discovered that each  of
the seventeen found a deserted building and turned it into  their
base.  To  enable them to communicate with each other  in  secret
they  installed  a  computer terminal  and  transmitter  in  each
location.  It  is  very  unlikely  they  all  met  together,  but
nevertheless  your sources indicate that they have devised a  way
to  wreck  the enemy's plans and that they were on the  point  of
carrying this out when they were discovered.
     You  have been provided with a brief description of  sixteen
of the seventeen scientists and this is attached. The identity of
the  seventeenth scientist remains a  mystery.  This  information
will help you recognise which hideout you have located should you
come  across  a  computer  terminal/transmitter.  Being  able  to
correctly  identify  whose hideout you have discovered may  be  a
matter of life and death.

GAMEPLAY
     (a) Movement
     Although the island on which this game takes place is small,
the  distances involved for someone trying to investigate  it  on
foot are very large.  Every time you see the picture move towards
or  away from you represents one step.  By using and mapping  out
shuttle  routes  it  will be possible for  you  to  cover  larger
distances  more  quickly.  However,  using  a shuttle  can  be  a
hazardous undertaking.
     You cannot leave a shuttle until it reaches its destination,
but  it  is  a good idea to keep a watchful eye  on  the  passing
scenery.

     (b) Gun Mode
     If you can see an enemy soldier,  he can see you.  You  will
jump  automatically  into  gun mode and it is up  to  you  to  be
quicker and more accurate than the enemy.
     You  can  only kill an enemy soldier by hitting him  in  the
chest.  If you hit him anywhere else, he will be wounded but will
still have time to shoot at you.

     (c) To Board a Shuttle
     Enter  investigate mode.  Move the cursor over  the  shuttle
stop and press FIRE.

     (d) To Enter or Leave a Building
     Enter  investigate mode.  move the cursor over the door  and
press FIRE.

     (e) To Identify Anything Else
     Enter  investigate mode.  Move the cursor over whatever  you
wish to identify and press FIRE.

     (f) To Pick Up Spare Ammunition, Explosives or Batteries:-
     This will happen automatically if you happen to find them.

     (g) To Leave a Time Delay Bomb
     Press  B to enter bomb mode.  The timer of the bomb you  are
setting  will flash.  Set the timer using the  keyboard  numbers.
Example: To set a bomb to go off in 2 minutes and 12 seconds type
0212.  The  bomb is dropped automatically when set and cannot  be
defused. Press space to quit option.

     (h) To Mine a Tank
     Stand  in  a position which you think is on  a  tank  patrol
route.  (This  can be dangerous.) Proceed as above,  but set  the
timer for a fair length of time.  The bomb will explode if a tank
goes over it.

     (i) Computer Terminal-Transmitters
     These  will  be  found  in  the  hideouts  of  each  of  the
scientists.  To  LOGON to the system network you must  enter  the
correct password.  Identifying whose hideout you are in will help
you do this. If you LOGON correctly to exit systems type BYE.
     Once you are into the system,  there are useful clues to  be
discovered,  if you can crack them.  Also, if you can communicate
with any of the other transmitters your direction indicator  will
get a fix on that transmitter's location and continue to  display
it in red.
     Being  able to understand and work with these  terminals  is
vital to success.  You are alone in the midst of a hostile enemy.
If  you  can find the nerve centre of  the  scientists'  computer
network, you may be able to finish their mission.

     (j) SAVE GAME
     You can save the game to disk,  but only from a safe  house.
If you find the word "safe" written on a wall,  enter investigate
mode  and identify the lettering.  Press S or L to Save  game  or
Load game.

MAP
     The map enclosed with the original instructions is  intended
as a guide only.  Serious game players may wish to make their own
larger map onto which they can plot shuttle routes,  enemy patrol
routes,  minefields, buildings, marshes, forests, mountains, safe
houses, etc.

ADDENDUM TO INSTRUCTIONS

Load / Save Instructions

Save Game
You may save your present game position to disk only from a  SAFE
house.  After  entering  a building,  if you see  the  word  SAFE
written  on a wall,  identify the lettering.  The options  (S)ave
(L)oad  (E)xit  will  appear.  Pressing S  will  save  your  game
position.

Remove your game disk and insert a blank formatted disk into your
drive.  Press any key.  If you have no previously saved games  on
the disk, you will see:
1/2/3/4/5/E(xit)

The E will be highlighted in white.  Press any number 1-5 and the
game  will save as that file number.  If you have any  previously
saved games, their file numbers will be highlighted in white. You
may  save over old files but a BACKUP WILL NOT BE  MADE.  If  the
numbers 1-5 are all highlighted and you do not wish to  overwrite
these files,  select E and repeat the above procedure with a  new
blank formatted disk.

LOAD GAME
Load is very similar to save. Identify SAFE, press L, insert disk
and press any key. Any previously saved game file numbers will be
highlighted in white.  Press the number of your desired file  and
it will load.  When you exit the Safe house,  the game will be in
the same position as you saved  it;  buildings,  patrols,  score,
timers,  etc.  If you press a number not highlighted it will have
no effect.

EXIT
If  at  any time an E appears as an option,  you  may  exit  that
operation by pressing E.
