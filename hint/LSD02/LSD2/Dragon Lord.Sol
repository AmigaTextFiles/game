By SEWER POM. Edited by PARASITE.


PART I
You are Amsel of Fandora, friend of the Last Dragon. Suddenly, you receive
a message from the last dragon in the dragonpearl that he has been drugged
and kidnapped by the Duke of Darkness and is being held in the Southland.
You decide to obtain the assistance of the Monarch of Simbala, Hawkwind,
another old friend.

 The journey will be long and hard. There are many ways of finishing the
quest. Some puzzles have more than one solution and others need not be
solved at all. This is but one possible solution. Remember that the arcade
sequences are for your amusement or frustration and are not necessary to the
quest!! You may find the picturesoff command useful in speeding up your
quest.

 So you board your boat, untie it and set sail east toward Simbala. As you
travel east you soon find your vessel destroyed and yourself beached on an
island. Quickly you discover vines and logs which you tie together to make a
raft. You also find dragonbane which will ward off those evil coldrakes! You
board the raft and soon drift east to Simbala where you are beached.

 You head east where you find yourself in a dense forest. You keep heading
east when you spot a windship overhead. Quickly gather the dry underbrush
and start it on fire using your magnifying glass. The windship picks you up.
As you wait you discover that the vessel is powered by jewels which burn
when water is poured on them. You also learn that the dragonbane is placed
outside the ship to keep away the coldrakes.

 Finally you arrive at the palace. You enter and are taken to a large
chamber. While there, you talk to Hawkwind who agrees to help you. You also
talk to Ephrion who gives you some valuable information. Then exit the room
to the south and you will find yourself on the stairs. Hawkwind asks whether
you wish to take the horses or the windship. Either will do. If you go up,
board the windship and set off to the south. A coldrake approaches!! You put
the dragonbane outside the ship and Hawkwind swerves to avoid the beast.
Unfortunately, you crash. The ship is destroyed but you are both unhurt.

 You find the ship caught in a tree so you climb down and continue east on
foot. The trail then leads south, southeast and finally east where you come
to a fork. Avoid the swamp to the south with its dreaded swamp monster and
head southeast to a north-south road. Keep going south until you find the
road overgrown. There you see some rare tanna leaves which you gather up.
The path continues to the southeast. You then follow the path south to the
mine entrance. Enter the mine and take a torch.

 You head south but find a crying woman blocking your way. Comfort her and
she gives you a wolf's tooth, the symbol of the thieves guild. You remember
that Ephrion mentioned a book in the Kandesh library with a wolf's tooth!
The woman slips away into the shadows, and you continue south only again
finding your way blocked! This time by the Kuln. Fortunately, they are
afraid of light and they let you pass when you wave the torch.

 Continue south where you find a pile of rock. Move the long flat one which
reveals a tunnel and another cavern to the southeast. There you find a
skeleton. You examine the skeleton and find a small key. Take the key and go
up into a small cave. Follow the daylight to the south and you find yourself
on an ancient road. To the south are the ruins of a villa. Go south to the
ruins and then west to an old atrium.

 You see a tree sculpture with ancient amber treebears. You try to reach
them but they are too high. Ask Hawkwind to help you and he lifts you up and
you take one. Then go back to the road and keep going south to the gates of
Kandesh. You see a large knocker and try to reach it. Again Hawkwind comes
to your assistance and knocks for you. The guard eyes you suspiciously but
lets you pass when you show him the tooth. You then enter the City of
Kandesh and head south past the residential area to the plaza.

Part II
 You find yourself in a large plaza, unsure of where to start. You notice
the Garrison to the west which you decide would be best to avoid. Head
northwest to the restaurant. You decide not to dine despite the hunger pangs
and go south. You see the medicine man is selling an elixir which you decide
may be useful in the future. Pay him the 40 talmas and go north and then
southeast back to the plaza.

 Then go northeast to the music shop. You hear some strange music in the
alcove and go northeast to investigate. You find a monkey playing sleep
inducing music on the flute. He asks you to imitate his tune. Quickly and
carefully play D S F A on the xylophone. The monkey is delighted and gives
you his magical flute. Leave the alcove and head back southwest to the
plaza.

 You remember Ephrion mentioning a book, so you head southwest to the
library. You find the reading room door locked. Break the lock with your
sword and enter. You find nothing much of interest so go west. Here You see
a huge dazikar chomping on books!! Quickly head upstairs where the beast
can't follow you. There you find the book with the wolf's tooth! Unlock it
with your key. It tells you of a safe place under the city!

 Your excitement turns to fear when you realize you must get past the
monster. Your mind races. You decide to give him a really good meal and take
the encyclopedia and throw them at him. While he is hiding in his hole,
quickly run down the stairs and out of the library the way you came in. You
are back in the plaza.

 The music in the bazaar is alluring and you head southeast. You see a Rayan
woman who for 5 talmas may tell you some very important information, then
again she may only give you a flower. You decide not to visit the physician,
the artist, the moneylender or the gaming house. The armorer you will save
for another visit. If you decide to enter or leave Castle Doomhaven by the
front entrance you will need an assassin's cowl which you can purchase from
the tailor. In this walkthru a cowl is not needed.

 Go southeast to the tavern. You and Hawkwind sit down at the bar and order
a drink. Pay the bartender, who gives you wine called Dragonsblood. Before
you can drink it you find yourself injured and robbed in a brawl. Hawkwind
carries you to the Physician's tent. You talk the physician into letting you
owe him the 20 talmas and leave your dagger with him for insurance. Leave
the tent to the south then go northwest back to the plaza.

 You decide to visit the Alchemist and go east to his shop. Ring the bell
and he angrily answers saying his Philosopher's stone was stolen. He then
throws a ring at you. You take the ring and see the word LAVA etched inside.
You then examine the unused furnace and find you can enter it.

 You do and find a trapdoor which you leads you to a tunnel. You look around
and see a very black stone which you take. Hawkwind tells you its the
Philosopher's stone! Then go west into the thieves den. They look at you
suspiciously and demand identification. Show the tooth and they greet you
warmly. Leave to the west. You keep west until you find the thieves treasure
trove. Take the talmas and the tuning fork and go upstairs.

 You find yourself in the Garrison's vault. Exit north into the plaza, and
go southwest to the bazaar, then north to the physician and pay him the 20
talmas. He gratefully gives you back your dagger and some dragonscale as
well! You leave to the south and reenter the bazaar. You go west to the
armorer. You buy some rope and ask him about the starsword.

 You remember the Rayan woman saying "The blood of dragons will set the
sword of dragons free". Pour the dragonsblood on the rock and take the
starsword. The armorer asks for 100 talmas for the sword which you gladly
pay him. You are warned that the sword can be used only once. You leave the
armorer happily to the east and head northwest to the plaza.

Part III
 Head south from the plaza to the Boulevard of Death, then west to the
cemetery and south to the Cenotaph. With Hawkwind's help you move the marble
door and enter finding a crypt with a crystal cover. You hit the tuning fork
and the pure note moves the crystal, revealing stairs leading down. At the
bottom of the stairs you find yourself in a north-south corridor beneath
Castle Doomhaven. Go south and then up the stairs to the strong room. Take
the jade key, the ivory and the plank and go back to the bottom of the
stairs.

 Head north to the cistern and then east. You are at the edge of a pit. You
place the plank across the pit and go to the eastern side. Continue east and
you find yourself in front of a lead cell with Prince Alyn inside. You
remember the Philosopher's stone! Touching the stone to the lead bars indeed
turns them into soft gold that can easily be bent. You release Alyn and head
southwest to the bottom of the stairs.

 Go north and up the stairs to the crypt. Exit the Cenotaph, go through the
cemetery and east to the Boulevard of Death. You go north to the park and
then southwest past the hedges to the palace. Enter the palace to the west.
The guards recognize Prince Alyn they let you pass. Alyn brings you into
Tormalion's chamber. Tormalion thanks you and asks you how he may help you.
You ask him about Dragonmount. As you exit, he rewards you with a large
diamond and the guards escort you out.

 You end up usually back at the park. You then decide to poke around the
palace and go southwest past the hedges to the palace entrance and then
north. You find a path and go west. The path continues west and south. You
go south and find a large mosaic with treebears. One branch is empty. Place
your amber treebear on it and a door opens. Enter and follow the hall south
to the treasury. Open the door and enter. Inside you find a piece of ivory
and take it. Then go north until you are again outside the palace on the
path.

 Go north and then west to the dock. Enter and untie the boat and row west.
You then see a sunken ship. You may examine the ship if you like but it's
dangerous and the conch shell you find is of no use to the quest. Keep going
west to the beach. Get out of your boat and go west. You find a rock with a
piece of ivory in it. You pry it loose with your dagger but find that the
crack is the mouth of a monster! In fact the island IS A MONSTER!!

 You remember from the Rayan woman that "music soothes the savage.....".
Play your magic flute and the monster falls asleep. Take the ivory and run
to your boat. Board the boat and row east back to the dock. Leave the boat
and continue east until you reach the south path to the front of the palace
and follow it south. From the front of the palace you go northwest past the
hedges to the park. You then follow the road south to the southern gates fo
Kandesh.

PART  FOUR
 Leave Kandesh and follow the road south. To the east you hear singing and
go there to investigate. There you find a Rayan camp but something catches
your eye to the south. It looks like a sail. You go south to the Rayan
clearing and see a Simbalan windship. Climb up the rope to the ship. Pocket
a few jewels and then pour water on the jewels in the brazier. The jewels
start to burn and you take off to the west.

 You land at the base of dragonmount, again with your ship destroyed! Go
west to the waterfall, Hawkwind suggests that you divert the river. You
remember the jewels and throw them in the waterfall. An explosion occurs and
reveals a cave to the south. As you enter the cave the walls covered with
spikes begin to close on you. Quickly climb up the spikes and open the
trapdoor. You go up into the middle of a volcano with molten lava in front
of you.

 Suddenly, you remember the ring and throw it into the lava. The lava
solidifies into rock and you make your way south to a beautiful door. The
door unlocks easily with the jade key and you enter a mirrored room. A huge
warrior threatens you. You are disoriented by all the mirrors so you begin
to break them with your sword. As you do this, you notice that it is having
the opposite effect on the guard. He is more disoriented!

 Finally, several exits will appear...but you still have to contend with the
guard. You ask Hawkwind for help. When the guard is faced with fighting
Hawkwind without the mirrors, he runs for his life!! Avoid the exit to the
south since it goes to the maze. Go east into the room with the wheel. When
you turn the wheel the room goes up and reveals a new room to the west which
you enter. There you find some runes which Hawkwind helps you decipher. They
give you a recipe for a captive's cure.

 Follow the insructions and place the elixir, dragonscale and tanna into the
cauldron. Get the sticks and rub them to start a fire in the fireplace.
Place the cauldron on the fire and take your cure when it is finished.
Examining the room you discover a hook. Throw the rope up at it and climb up
to the cupola. You see a pattern of a dragon carved in the crystal. After
searching your possessions, you decide to try the ivory pieces. Insert the
ivory pieces into the pattern which reveals a hidden doorway to the south.

 You enter and find yourself in a crater with a platform to the west. The
Last Dragon is on the platform drugged and chained. Go to him. Cut the chain
with the starsword and give him the cure. The dragon is back to himself
again! Then the Duke of Darkness appears and threatens all of you. You
remember then what Ephrion said to you and you say "Darkness fears the
flame" The Last Dragon bursts forth with a huge flame and the Duke is
defeated. You have suceeded in your quest and the Last Dragon is very
grateful.
