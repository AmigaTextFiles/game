                        TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES

Typed in by PARANOMIA. Edited by PARASITE.


PREPARE TO SHELL OUT SOME PUNISHMENT
   Steam rises from Wall Street sewers like hot breath from a pack of
wild dogs.  Just below the pavement's puddle strewn surface, the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have gathered around the leftovers of a
family-reunion-sized sausage pizza with extra sauce.  Usually these
party dudes would inhale the mozzarella platter as if it were the
last "za" on Earth, but not tonight.

   You see, only hours ago, their trusted friend, April O'Neil, was
kidnapped from her mobile news van by the vile, ruthless, terrorist
bully SHREDDER!  He's a Slice-O-Matic crum, a villain more vicious
than an army of mind altered Bruce Lees.

   With their lovely cohort held hostage, the fearless foursome must
concoct a way to rescue April before Shredder brain-washes her into
joining his Ninjitsu Foot Clan.  They'll combine this treacherous
task with the mission they've been on since their mutated beginnings-
to thrash Shredder and capture his Life Transformer Gun, the lone
piece of technology that can turn their rat friend, Splinter, back
into the man he used to be.

   So take control of these heroes in a half shell, and either claim
total victory over New York's premier Kick Man... or lead them onto
the menu at Mc Turtles (Home of the Quarter Flounder with Cheese).

HOW TO PLAY
   Your initial goal is to rescue the fair maiden, April, a hip version
of a medieval damsel in distress.  But your ultimate objective is to
battle through the streets and sewers of New York until you score a
victory at the TECHNODROME, home of the evil Shredder and his Life
Transformer Gun.

   To reach this territory of terror, you must overcome six levels of
adventure without getting all four turtles captured by Shredder's
Foot Clan Warriors.  Each level has several stages.  Along the way,
your every instinct will be challenged both above ground and below,
and imprisonment will happen swiftly if your Life Line runs down or
you're run down by a Roller Car.

   Once a turtle is captured, he is out of action until you find and
rescue him.  (Prisoners could be anywhere.  To release them, simply
touch their hand.)

   At the end of each level (except Level 2) you'll unfortunately
find a Karate Boss who is anxiously waiting to turn you into turtle
soup.

   A FINAL SLICE OF ADVICE: Keep an eye out for weapons, ropes and
life-sustaining pizza pies as you go.

A game screen will appear requesting you to select one of the following:

                           START A NEW GAME
                        CONTINUE A SAVED GAME
HOW TO BEGIN
   Once you've chosen CONTINUE or NEW GAME, press the Joystick Fire
Button.

HOW TO SAVE YOUR ADVENTURE FOR ANOTHER DAY
   At any time during the game, you can use the SAVE GAME FEATURE by
simultaneously pressing the CTRL and the S Key.  The screen will
briefly flash "SAVING GAME" to confirm your command.  The disk must
be write enabled for this feature.

   The SAVE GAME FEATURE allows you to save your game status as you
progress from one level to the next.  You can use the SAVE GAME FEATURE
at any time and as often as you wish, but only one game status is
saved.  Each time you save a game, the current game status replaces
the last saved game.

   The next time you re-boot the game, you can select CONTINUE A SAVED
GAME on the introduction screen and return to the same location in
New York where you finished your last adventure.

STARTING A SAVED GAME
   When you first load the game, you will be asked whether you wish to:
START A NEW GAME or CONTINUE A SAVED GAME.

   If you select CONTINUE A SAVED GAME, you will resume playing the
game from the point where you last used the game save option.

   If you select START A NEW GAME, you will play the game from the
beginning of the adventure.

ENDING YOUR MISSION
   When you are ready to sleaze-out of the sewer, simultaneously press
the CTRL and Q Keys.  You will then be asked whether you wish to:
START OVER or END.

   If you select START OVER, you will restart the game at the
beginning of the first level.  You will not need to reset any game
configurations.

   If you select END, you will have a last chance to save your game
status before quitting.

   If you select YES, to the SAVE GAME question, your current status
will be saved for future use.

   If you select NO, to the SAVE GAME question, your current status
will not be saved and the adventure will come to a shelf-crushing
halt.

GAME CONTROLS
During the game, press:

Key         Function               Action
CTRL P      Pause                  Toggle Pause On and Off.
CTRL B      Background Music       Toggle Background Music On and Off.

CTRL S      Save Game              Save the game at the current status.
CTRL Q      Quit                   Ends the game and returns to DOS.
SPACE BAR   Weapons Select         Toggle between standard weapon and
                                   special weapon (i.e. Boomerang).
                                   If the special weapon runs out of
                                   ammo, you will automatically revert
                                   to the turtle's standard weapon.
RETURN KEY  Special Features       Displays the Information Screen.

JOYSTICK CONTROLS
     Joystick moves the turtle hero in four directions.
                                                         Up
                                                    Left__|__Right
                                                          |
                                                         Down

ATTACK CONTROLS
Joystick Fire Button

   Press and quickly release to fire active weapon.  To jump, press
and momentarily hold the Fire Button down.

TO SWIM
   Use the joystick to maneuver underwater.  To increase your
swimming speed, press the Joystick Fire Button rapidly.

TO PARTY DOWN IN THE PARTY WAGON
   To enter the Party Wagon, stand next to it and press the ENTER key.

   Once inside, use the joystick to cruise around.  Press the SPACE
BAR to toggle between Anti-Foot Clan Missiles and the Vulcan Cannon.
Press the Joystick Fire Button to launch these weapons.

   To exit the Party Wagon, press the ENTER key.

SPLINTER'S MULTI-PURPOSE INFORMATION SCREEN
   The first screen that will appear is the information (AKA:INFO)
Screen.  This screen should be utilized throughout your quest, to read
maps and to gain useful hints from Splinter and April (once you've
rescued her).

   From the Info Screen you'll also choose the turtle you wish to
guide.  Move the joystick Up or Down to select a turtle, then press
the Joystick Fire Button to lock in your identity.

   During play you can return to the Info Screen by pressing the RETURN
Key.  This is crucial to remember, since you'll gain important
advantages by matching each turtle's strengths with those of the
various enemies.

Area Map
   Displays diagram of the level you're exploring.  Your location is
highlighted by a flashing white dot.  Red Grid Squares indicate areas
where the turtles can move through.  White Grid Squares clue you in on
underground passages and buildings.

PIZZA AND OTHER LIFE SUSTAINING GOODIES
Boomerang - If you catch the boomerang on its return, you can use it
            again and again.

Mr. Invincibility - Locate one of these, and you'll find yourself
                    indestructible for a limited period of time.

Nunchukus - Michaelangelo's weapon.

Bo - Donatello's weapon.

Katana Blade - Leonardo's weapon.

Sai - Raphael's weapon

Whole Pizza - Totally revitalizes your turtle.

Half Pizza - Returns a portion of your powers.

Slice O' Pizza - Restores a slice of life.

Anti-Foot Clan Missile - Perfect for demolishing enemy barricades in
                         Level 3.

The Rope - Use in Levels 3 and 4 to leap from building to building.

Kiai - When thrown, it travels in a straight line, decimating enemies
       in its path.

Single Shuriken - Hurl these gruesome weapons one by one.

Triple Shuriken - Toss in trios.

THE TURTLES (Not to be confused with the Beatles!)
   The fab four of Karatedom await your beck and call.  These jammin'
dudes, stars of stage, screen and comic books, are pumped full of
pizza power.  Each has a different skill and a unique personality.
You must decide when is the best time to control each turtle.

   Return to the Info Screen to switch turtles from situation to
situation.  Remember:  These Samurai sidekicks are only as gifted in the
ancient art of warfare as you.

LEONARDO - Leonardo's primary weapon is the hair splitting Katana
Blade.  He's most effective when attacking sewer enemies, especially
ones that lurk overhead.

RAPHAEL - The needle tipped Sai is Raphael's preferred attack tool.
The speec and grace of his strikes are what he prides himself on.

MICHAELANGELO - Compared to his comrades, Michaelangelo's power is
only average.  However, enemies around his feet usually fall prey to
his Nunchukus onslaught.  His courage will also amaze you.

DONATELLO - The dreaded Bo (not to be confused with everyone's
favorite Halfback/Left Fielder) is Donatello's form of amusement.
Don't be fooled by the fact that it looks like a simple stick,
because this baby can take out enemies from both above and below.

THE TURTLES' TOP 10
   At the end of the game, if your score ranks among the 10 best, you'll
be able to enter your name on the Turtle Top 10 List.

   To enter your name, type up to 10 letters on the keyboard and press
the RETURN Key.

   If you fail to score in the Top 10, you'll automatically return
to the beginning without stopping by this illustrious screen.

ENEMIES GALORE
Stick 'Em Up (AKA: The Roof Leaper) - Ignorant to the force of gravity,
this pesty sewer thug (the product of a horrible chemical spill) pounces
about on ceiling pipes, waiting to rain terror from above.

Foot Clan Foot Soldier - Following in the thousand year tradition
of karate combat, he's a killing machine blindly guided by
Shredder's commands.

Mouser - With jaws capable of crushing iron sewer gates, the Mouser
is Splinter's prime enemy and the turtles' smallest threat.

Searchlight Mechanism - If this hovering scoundrel spots you, watch out!

Fire Freak - An ex-pyromaniac from Brooklyn, this hot dog takes careful
aim before launching fireballs that turn into clones of himself.

The Roller Car - In search of turtle fodder, Foot Clan platoons tour
New York's famous avenues in Roller Cars (once used by David Letterman
during his now famous "smashing" episodes).

KARATE BOSSES
Bebop & Rocksteady - Part beasts and part criminal misfits, these guys
are Shredder's most trusted sidekicks and the enforcers at the end of
Level 1. (Value 4,000 and 5,000 points respectively.)

Big Mouser - Ruler of Level 4, he turned to a life of sleaze after
being booted from the Mouseketeer Club.  (Value 8,000 points.)

Mecaturtle - Appearing like your average turtle, this Level 3
commander will show his true colors if you do him any harm.  (Value
6,000 points. Value 7,000 points if destroyed after his transformation.)

Technodrome Guardian - Level 5's mobile stronghold, this roving ruffian
will zap you senseless unless you aim for his eyeclops radar.  (Value
9,000 points.)

Shredder - At last, your arch enemy at arms length.  Of course,
he's the meanest of the mean, the dirtiest dirt in town.  If you fail
to destroy him and capture his Life Transformer Gun, he'll turn you
into an ordinary turtle - and considering all the cars in New York,
that would make you a leading candidate for a future road kill.
AAAAAAARGH! (Value 10,000 points.)
