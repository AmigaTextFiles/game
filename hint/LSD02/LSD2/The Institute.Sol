                        THE INSTITUTE SOLUTION

By SEWER POM. Edited by PARASITE.


Part I
The Institute, from Screenplay is one of the most intriguing high-res
adventures I've played in a long time. You are in a mental institution for
some unknown reason, and your goal is simple; escape! It's not that easy,
though. There are all sorts of fun stuff to get done (including four merry
romps through your subconscious) before you get away. This little Solution
should get you out of the looney bin before the game puts you in the looney
bin.

 The game begins on an up note; you're in bed, drugged and unable to move.
You have a bit of time to kill before you can do anything, so just try all
sorts of stuff before the dwarf comes in. What dwarf you say? The one that
appears on your bed and tells you why you're in this place, (after you TALK
a few times first,) that's what dwarf! When he leaves, the drugs will have
worn off. So GET UP, and look around the room. Why don't you LOOK UNDER BED?
Well, whaddaya know! A mug! Just GET MUG, and E.

 First thing you see in the hall is this big mirror. I hate mirrors. BREAK
MIRROR. A piece of the mirror will break off. GET MIRROR, and S. The door
you see is closed. So OPEN it. Wow, look at all the neat stuff to fiddle
with! Why not LOOK SHELVES? Don't take that bottle out into the hall, or
you'll get busted for stealing. There's so much on that shelf that you'll
probably find more stuff if you LOOK SHELVES again. Sure enough, there's a
nice useful scalpel. GET SCALPEL, OPEN DOOR (to leave the room,) and S.

 Before you go through that door, check out the room to the W)est. You never
know what kind of important stuff you'll hear from crazy people if you
LISTEN to them. What was that word? Better write that down; it may come in
handy! Wonder if there's anything in the room? Type LOOK ROOM and find out.
Well, well, more cryptic facts. Might want to remember that slogan, too...
go E)ast, and OPEN DOOR.

 Welcome to the counselor's office. You can TALK to this guy for a bit, but
he doesn't say anything of major importance. In fact, he makes me mad...
ATTACK MAN. ZAP!!!!

 Uh oh..... Well, as long as you're here, have a look around. If you LISTEN,
you'll hear water dripping. There must be a leak in a pipe somewhere. I
always put something under a leak to avoid making a messy puddle on the
floor; don't you? So DROP MUG. You have a bit more time to kill, so try some
stuff. I wonder what they stuff these walls with? Try to CUT PADDING and
find out. Now why would anyone stuff walls with rope? O, well, better GET
ROPE; it may come in handy. After a while, they let you out and bring you
back to your room. Go back to the office and ATTACK MAN again. ZAP!!!!!!

 While you were out, the mug got filled with water. So GET WATER, and wait
for them to decide you've calmed down enough to let you out. Then go back to
the dispensary and GET BOTTLE. If you LOOK at the BOTTLE, you'll see it's
magic powder. Now then; where to eat it? How about in that room to the
S)outh? Sounds good to me!

 Here we are in the closet. You have some water to wash it down, so EAT
POWDER. oooooooOOOOOOOOOOO........

Part II
Wow, what a nice place! Well, why not look around to see what we can see?
Try going E)ast. How to climb that cliff.... Aha! Here's where the rope
comes in handy. THROW ROPE, then CLIMB ROPE. It's always nice to look
through a telescope, but not if it's all blurry. FOCUS TELESCOPE, and that
problem will go away. LOOK TELESCOPE. You'll see something. LOOK at that.
Etc, etc, etc, until you see what you see. Now anything that's that hard to
get to is probably worth remembering, so do so. then CLIMB DOWN. go W)est,
and look at the corpse. Isn't this a fun game? If you LISTEN, you'll hear a
tree mumbling. TALK to it, and it'll ask you where you're from. You have no
secrets to keep; tell it THE INSTITUTE. CCCRRRRRAAACCCCKKK!!!

 Whaddaya know? CLIMB those stairs, and you'll see someone familiar. You can
TALK to him for a while; he may say something of minor importance. But he
does get on my nerves. Tell him to KILL himself, and he'll be gone. OPEN
DOOR, and look around. If you TALK to the owl, he'll tell you something
that'll make you glad you read the plaque. You may not be thirsty, but you
may want to DRINK from the stream. In fact, keep DRINKing till you turn
green. Go S)outh, and you'll be at the statue base. LOOK at the BASE, and
GET the tube of GLUE that you find. Now go E)ast. This little guy may look
silly, but if you don't TALK to him and tell him what he wants to know, he
won't let you by. So say what the meaning of Death is, and he'll become very
angry for no adequately explored reason. You can just KICK him over a tree,
and he'll not bother you again.

 Now CLIMB the stairs, and you'll be at the log. type PUT GLUE, and when it
asks where, say ON SHOES. This will give you enough traction to CLIMB the
log. (You can DROP GLUE here; you won't need it again.) If you LOOK LOG on
the other side, you'll find a hole. GO HOLE, and LOOK around. You'll find a
bronze key and a shovel. GET them both. You can DROP them somewhere; (like
by the owl,) you won't need them till later. Go N)orth, and TALK to the MAN.
Since you're green now, he'll let you in. So OPEN DOOR, and LOOK NATIVES.
Pick up what the native dropped. Now what would a native need a sturdy
umbrella for?

 Go N)orth, and N)orth again. There is a face in the hole if you LOOK HOLE.
TALK to it, and it will ask to be shown beauty equal to his own. The best
thing to show it is itself, so SHOW MIRROR. The wall will crack, and the
thing will fall silent. (I guess it couldn't handle seeing something as
beautiful as itself...) If you GO CRACK, you will begin to wake up. When you
do and appear back in the closet, EAT POWDER again.

 Now where am I? Oh, well; ever see Mary Poppins? So did the designer of
this game. OPEN UMBRELLA, and you'll begin to float up. You were inside the
smokestack of a ship. When you land, you'll see a life preserver when you
LOOK DECK. GET PRESERVER, and go S)outh. You'll be at the stern, and these
big icebergs will come at the ship. (Did I neglect to mention that you're on
the Titanic? Silly me....) The ship will begin to sink.....so, SWIM, and
you'll be at sea. LOOK DOWN, and GET CROWBAR. Eventually, you'll get eaten
by a shark and wake up. You can DROP the PRESERVER, the UMBRELLA and the
CROWBAR in the closet; you'll not need the preserver again, and the others
aren't needed till later. EAT POWDER again.

 Hoo BOY, has your subconscious been working overtime! Okay, WATER PLANT,
and it'll grow real big and break the door. OPEN DOOR, and you'll be in the
altar room. Unfortunately, this is all you can do right now. So OPEN DOOR,
and you'll die and wake up. EAT POWDER again.

Part III
"Curiouser and Curiouser!" Do not go near that tiger yet, as he has a poor
disposition, and will not be nice. Go S)outh, and LOOK STREAM. then LOOK
UNDER ROCKS. Cute, isn't he? GET LIZARD, and DRINK WATER. This water is
poisonous, and will kill you. EAT POWDER when you wake up.

 NOTE: From this point on, you have to do things in different dreams. They
all cycle 1 through 4, and there is only one way to skip any. So to get to a
certain dream, just die or get out of each dream in between and keep EATing
POWDER till you get to the dream you want.

 Get to dream 3 (The Temple.) OPEN DOOR. SACRIFICE LIZARD. (Be sure you have
the scalpel to do this.) A door will open. CLIMB those stairs behind it. Now
HOLD BREATH. This will keep you from dying of the poison gas when you CLIMB
the second set of stairs. Now go W)est. You'll be in a throne room.
(Literally; try PULLing the HANDLE on the throne!) See the sphere? See the
shaft of light? USE MIRROR, and the light will reflect into the hole. LISTEN
until the sphere breaks open, revealing a steak and a copy of Captain Spud
Comics. (The latter only being good for a laugh.) GET STEAK, and go to dream
4 (The Jungle.)

 This time, THROW STEAK. The tiger will go off and enjoy a hearty lunch.
E)ast, and OPEN CHEST. GET SCREWDRIVER. Now go to dream 2 (Titanic.) Be sure
to GET UMBRELLA before you enter dream 2.

 When you hit the deck, OPEN DOOR. See that picture? UNSCREW SCREWS,
revealing a small key. You can DROP the SCREWDRIVER and the UMBRELLA and GET
SMALL KEY. Now WAKE UP, and when you eat the powder this time, you go right
to dream 1 (The Forest.)

 This time, DRINK at the stream till you turn bright green. Get over to the
Green village, and OPEN DOOR. N)orth. Use the scalpel to CUT STRIPS. OPEN
DOOR. Your brightly glowing body will provide light to see. Use the small
key to UNLOCK TOOL BOX. OPEN BOX. You can now DROP SMALL KEY while you GET
WRENCH. W)est. Now go back to where you left the shovel and the bronze key.
By now, a funny little shrub should have grown by the stream. Use the shovel
to DIG PLANT. DROP SHOVEL and GET SHRUB. GET BRONZE KEY, and S)outh. Now go
W)est. Gee, no Keyhole. You'll need some pretty strong magic to make one.
How about that word that the man told you in the ward? Say it. ZAP!!!!!
Allright!

 Use the Bronze key to UNLOCK DOOR. Once inside, LOOK UP. Then CLIMB the
ladder. There's no air up there, but the plant you dug up will provide air.
See that touchpad. Type the number you saw on the billboard. The door
unlocks. OPEN DOOR.

 Once inside, use the crowbar to LIFT COVER. Then use the wrench to TURN
BOLT. The statue falls over, and you are thrown out, sitting on a gold key.
You can DROP everything now; all you need is the gold key. Get out of the
dream by typing WAKE UP, and go to the counselor's office. No one's here!
Use the key to UNLOCK DOOR, then OPEN DOOR, and you're out!
