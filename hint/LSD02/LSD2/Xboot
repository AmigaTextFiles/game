                                XBOOT

TYPED IN BY THE AUTHOR, EDITED BY PARASITE.


   This is a VERY simple utility I felt I needed to study those nasty Viruses
   hanging around...
   It converts a boot-block into an executable file, so you may use
   your favorite debugger (Wack, Dis, ...) to study it.

   SYNTAX: xboot infile outfile

   CAVEATS:
   <infile> should be exactly 1024 bytes long. It is normally the dump
   of blocks 0 and 1 of a floppy disk.

   DETAILS:
   The first three longwords of the boot-block are put in the second hunk
   (data hunk).
   All other data is thrown into the first hunk (code hunk).
   This has the disadvantage of breaking the PC-relative adressing for
   the data (like in ByteBandits virus).

   COMPILATION NOTES:
   I used standard AmigaDOS file functions, so that you may compile with
   amiga.lib before lc.lib, and have a smaller executable.

   DISTRIBUTION:
      Free ! This a Public Domain. Do whatever you want with this program.
