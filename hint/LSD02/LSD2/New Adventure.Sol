                          NEW ADVENTURE SOLUTION

By ???. Edited by PARASITE.


First an appology, I pinched this document, as I do many, from an ATARI ST
SEWER SOFTWARE docs disk. However the dipstick who put it together deliberately
removed the last 3K of this solution. However it is still useful.


PART ONE
Welcome to the wonderful world of Adventure!  The game called "NEWADV" is the
latest expansion of the ever-popular "Woods-Crowther" Adventure game.  The
object of the game is to collect treasures and leave them safely in the
building...in the correct place and state.  This file will walk you through
the game.  It's a long process; be prepared to spend a fair amount of time on
it.

You start out outside of the well-house.  This is the building where you leave
your treasures.  But first, a cautionary note:  There is a pack rat who
wanders around outside the cave.  In order to protect yourself, you must hide
any articles you're going to need in the cave.  So I'll be telling you to pick
up some things that you won't use until later.

Enter the building and get the lamp and the matchbox.  Go into the storeroom
and get the keys, food, and bottle.  The other articles are not necessary.
The yellow pill is to heal you if the rat bites you, but he only does that if
you attack him, and you aren't going to do that.

Go out and go south until you get to the grate.  Unlock it, and drop articles
so that you can pick up the cloth bag and drop it just inside the grate.  Then
go back out and get your things, and re-enter the cave.  Proceed west, picking
up the cage and the black rod on your way.  Go one step past the bird and drop
the rod.  Then go back and get the bird, and return west and get the rod (the
bird is afraid of it, so you had to hide it).  Go down the steps and west to
the fissure.  Wave the rod and a bridge will appear.  Go back to the Hall of
Mists, and down to the Hall of the Mountain King.

At some point, a dwarf will come along and throw an axe at you.  Retain this
axe and throw it to kill any other dwarves that appear.  There are five
dwarves, so if you count and you've killed five, you can discard the axe.

Also, sometime the pirate will pop out and steal all your treasures.  When
this happens, you can either go get them immediately or finish what you're
doing first (if he didn't take anything you needed to do so).  Once he does
so, his chest appears at the end of the maze west of the Hall of Mists.  All
of the things he stole from you are in it, and you will need the keys to open
it.  Sometimes there will be so much that you can't lift it.  Then you have to
make multiple trips (a pain).

To reach his chest, go to the "west end of the Hall of Mists" and take the
following directions:  South, east, south, south, south, north, east, north,
east, northwest.  Take the chest, if you can.  If it's too full, unlock it
with the keys and take as much as you can out of it.  Then go southeast and
north and down the pit.  You will find yourself in the bird chamber.  You can
then go to wherever you want to store the things with one caution.  Do not try
to go down the steps to the Hall of Mists if you are carrying the gold nugget.
It's too heavy and you'll fall and kill yourself.

Okay, back to the cave.  You're in the Hall of the Mountain King confronting
the snake.  Open the cage, and drop the bird and the cage.  The bird will
chase the snake away.  Take the soiled paper out of the cage; it's valuable
later.  Then go northeast to the Throne Room.  You may have to keep trying the
NE command.  Once in the Throne Room, go east and get the crown and return to
the Hall of the Mountain King.  Go to the South Side Chamber, drop the crown,
get the jewelry, then "wear crown," and return to the Hall.

Go north to the "Y2 room." This is the center from which your explorations of
the cave take place.  It is a magic room because if you use the word PLUGH in
it, you will be transported to the building (PLUGH in the building brings you
to Y2).  Drop everything but the lamp, axe (if you have it), and rod.

Go back to the Hall of the MK, picking up the lyre on your way.  Go west (get
the coins) to the "east end of the long hall".  Go south to a crack that
widens to the south.  If you get a dead-end crack, go north and south until
you get the right one.  Continue south to the cloak room.

PART TWO
In the cloakroom, you will find the dreaded Wumpus.  The only way to get the
velvet cloak is to yank it (YANK CLOAK) out from under the rocks.
Unfortunately, this not only wakes the Wumpus, it also blocks the entrance to
the room.  The only solution is to run like heck; but run the right way.
Follow these directions:  Northwest, north, down, and east three times to the
east side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.  Don't waste any steps on the
way, and don't stop, the Wumpus is right behind you.  When you reach the
*east* side of the fissure, wave the rod.  The bridge will vanish and the
Wumpus will die in the fall.  Wave the rod again to rebuild the bridge,
because it's handy.  Then you can discard the rod.

Now, recross the bridge and pick up the silver horn you passed.  Then go back
east to the Hall of Mists, and go South to the Nugget of Gold room and get the
nugget.  Return to the Hall of Mists, and say Y2 to get yourself back to that
room.  Drop all your treasures.

Take the lamp, axe, horn, and bottle, and wear the crown.  Go to the Arched
Hall (S,D,W,D,N,UP) and blow the horn.  Return to the Complex Junction and
drop the horn.  Proceed west to the west end of the Twopit Room.

Go down the west pit, open the bottle and water the plant.  It will grow, but
not enough to reach the hole above your head.  So you need more water.  The
closest is at the Reservoir (UP,W,UP,N,N).  Fill your bottle, return to the
pit, and water the plant again.  It now has grown enough.  Go to the east pit
and fill your bottle with oil.  Then return to the west pit and climb the
beanstalk.

Go West to the Giant Room and get the eggs.  Then go north to the rusty door.
Oil it, and proceed North to the waterfall.  Jump down the waterfall and
you'll arrive at Sword Point.  Be certain you are wearing, not just carrying,
the crown and yank the sword from the anvil.  Go east to the slide and down to
the Misty Cavern.

Go to the Alcove (west) and drop everything so you can squeeze east through
the tight tunnel.  Fetch the emerald and go back and get all the other things.
A word about the weights of things.  For some reason you can always wear
something, but you may not be able to "take" it.  So if you can't pick
everything up, drop the crown, pick up whatever else, and then WEAR CROWN.

Go NW and south to the Oriental Room and get the vase.  NEVER drop the vase
unless you're in the same room as the pillow (you'll find it).  Go SE and
you're back in the Swiss Cheese Room.  Go to the Complex Junction and drop the
crown, eggs, emerald, and bottle.

Go to the Arched Hall and go north and west from there to the Crypt.  Climb
down, pick up the candle and go south and west to the Gothic Chapel.  Take the
grail.  Return to the cathedral, and take the hidden south passage to the
natural bridge.  Wear the shoes.  Now go to the east side of the Cathedral.
Wave the sword to chop down the brambles and then immmediately put the rose in
the vase (else it will wilt).

Carry everything back to Y2 and leave it.  Do *not* drop the vase until you
have the pillow, keep carrying it.  Go West back to Bedquilt and up until you
get to a north/south passage.  You may have to try several times, the Bedquilt
is very confusing.  Once you get to the passage, proceed north to the window,
and pick up the can.  Go back to Bedquilt, and go to the Swiss Cheese Room.
Go east to the soft room and get the pillow.

Take everything back to Y2 and leave it there (drop the pillow before the
vase).  Then take the lamp, axe, can, lyre, and cloak and say PLUGH to return
to the building.  Turn your lamp off.

PART THREE
Exit the building and go west to the forest.  Take the mushrooms.  Go north to
the salt marsh and take the pole.  Go South and west to the beach and take the
box, and north and up to Ocean Vista and take the flowers.  Then go down and
into Thunder Hole, and walk East.  Play the lyre to put the dog to sleep, and
go east to the tiny door (you have to jump the river).

Here you play Alice in Wonderland.  Eat the mushrooms and you will grow.  Now
you can reach the ledge where the key to the tiny door is.  Take it, and then
eat the tiny cakes on the ledge.  You will shrink back to normal.  Now, if
you've played this before, you've probably run into an obnoxious little man
who kicks you on the knee and yells PHUCE at you.  Use this word to shrink
yourself down to the size of the door.  Open it and discard the key.  Enter,
and use PHUCE again to grow to your normal size.

Take the boat, and put the pole, lyre, and can in it.  You have to have the
pole to propel the boat, but it can just lie in the bottom.  Go south to the
gravel beach.  Leave the boat, turn on the lamp, and go east to the Apiary.
Feed the flowers to the bees, and take the honeycomb back and put it in the
boat.  Turn off the lamp.

Now go north and east to the east side of Blue Grotto.  Put the trident in the
boat and, still in the boat, go north again.  Open the can, put the green
stone in it and close the can.  If you don't close it, you will get radiation
sickness and die.  Leave the boat, turn on the lamp, and go up to Fairy
Grotto.  Wear the cloak, then go East to the Hall of Ice and get the diamonds.
Return to the Fairy Grotto, and turn your lamp off.  Go south to the Crystal
Palace (you can't get in with your light on).  Take the opal and go east to
the yellow path.  There is a hidden passage to the north.  Go up it (lamp back
on) and get the cask.  Then go back through the Crystal Palace and SW and down
to your boat.

Put everything in the boat except the lamp and the axe.  Go south to the east
side of the grotto, and leave the boat.  Ascend to the bat cave and get the
shovel.  Proceed east, then up over the Tongue of Rock, then East again,
picking up the broom, sapphire, and card.  Then SE at the Elbow you reach the
Rotunda.  Enter the phone booth.  If the gnome beats you to it, just keep
leaving the room (going east then west is easiest) until you can get in.  Kick
the phone and take the slugs.  Then go to the Conservatory (east) and get the
flute.  Open the piano and take the letter out (this is the "official" paper
if it ever asks "which paper").

Return to the boat, and drop your treasures inside.  Go back to the Tongue of
Rock, north and down to Lost River Canyon.  Take the ring from the Wumpus'
finger.  Now return to the boat and put everything but the lamp and axe in it.
Take the boat to the west side, and north to the dark cove.  Take the cask and
go northeast, up, and east to the Winery.  Fill the cask with wine, return to
the boat, and return to the west side of the Blue Grotto.

Take everything out of the boat except the pole.  You should be able to carry
it all, but make two trips if you must.  Say PHUCE, go out the door, and say
PHUCE again.  Now go to Ocean Vista and play the flute.  The pack rat will
appear and will throw himself off the cliff to his own destruction.  Now you
don't have to worry about him stealing your things.

Go to the beach and drop the shovel.  From here you can just say "B" to get
back to the building.  Drop everything, then return to the beach and use the
shovel to dig three times.  Discard the shovel, and take the conch shell back
to the building (your hands were probably too full before).

Leave everything in the building except the wooden box.  Go back to the grate
where you hid the cloth bag and get it.  Then go north until you enter the
swamp.  Go east from there and you'll find some bubbling wet sand.  Open the
bag, pour the powder (it's cement) and the quicksand will become concrete.
Drop the bag, and go north to the ravine.  Be certain you're carrying nothing
but the wooden box and go down into the ravine.  Drop the box and place the
marble statue in it.  Then climb back up and go east to the cliff.  Climb the
vines and get the rope.  Go down, part the vines, and go through the defile
and NW at the bend and get the shamrock.  Then go back through the defile.
From here, also, the letter "B" will get you to the building.

Since the rat is dead, you can now move all the things you've hidden in the
cave to the building.  Then get the tools you're going to need for the next
sections of the game.  These are the lamp, axe, candle, keys, eggs, shamrock,
ring, rope, honey, card, trident, broom, slugs, and flute.  Get all these
things to Y2.

Now take the lamp, axe, broom, slugs, and trident.  Go to the dusty room and
sweep it to find the combination to the safe.  Discard the broom.  Go to the
Shell Room and open the clam (you needed the trident).  Chase the pearl down
and get it.  Then return to the Hall of the Mountain King.

PART FOUR
From the Hall of the Mountain King, go SW until you get to the secret canyon.
You may have to try several times.  Continue west to the dragon room.  Kill
the dragon (when it asks if you want to do it with your bare hands, say yes).
Then take the rug and return east to the Hall of the Mountain King.  Go west,
west, and south to the west end of the long hall.  Now you're going to enter
the maze and get fresh batteries in case you need them later.  From this
point, go south, south, east, and south to the vending machine.  Put the slugs
in the machine and take the batteries.  Then go north, southwest, west, and
down to the long hall again.  Return to Y2 and leave your treasures.

Take the lamp, axe, honey, keys and eggs.  Go to the Oriental Room and then
east to the low room.  Go NE to the sloping corridor and up to the Troll
Bridge.  Throwhe building, take
the knapsack, matchbox, "official" letter, and the lamp.  Go out of the
building and east to the helicopter.  Board it.  When the orcs see your
letter, they'll let you in.  Push the button twice and you'll be at the mine.
Exit the chopper and go east into the mine and into the engineer's room.  You
can push the green button to turn the lights on and save your lamp.  At any
rate, push the red button to start the pumps.

Go out and into the engineer's room three times (you're pacing).  Read the
gauge to be sure it's zero, and push the yellow button to stop the pumps.  Go
back out to the helicopter and push the button twice again.  Exit to the west
court of the castle.  Go to the kitchen, light a match, and light the candle.
Pull the chain on the dumbwaiter.  Go back to the chopper immediately and push
the button *once*.  Exit, go east into the mine again, and down to the bottom
of it.  Drop everything and go through the tight tunnel.  You will find the
silver ingots and the dumbwaiter with the candle on it.  Put the ingots in the
dumbwaiter and go back to the mine entrance, picking up all your things on the
way.
