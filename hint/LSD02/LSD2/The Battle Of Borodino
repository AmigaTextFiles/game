                    THE BATTLE OF BORODINO

Typed in by DELTA. edited by PARASITE.


 NAPOLEON'S INVASION OF RUSSIA IN 1812 IS BEST REMEMBERED FOR THE
DISASTEROUS FRENCH RETREAT FROM MOSCOW.THIS CATASTROPHE FINALLY
BROUGHT TO A CLOSE ANY OF THE EMPORER'S REMAINING AMBITIONS IN THE
EAST.NAPOLEON FAILED IN HIS EFFORTS TO BRING THE RUSSIANS TO HEAL
IN A SINGLE DECISIVE BATTLE,AND ONE OF THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS OF
THIS PERIOD IS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HE HAD ACHIEVED THIS AT
THE ONE BIG CONFRONTATION,....THE BATTLE OF BORODINO.
 THERE SEEMS TO BE NO SINGLE REASON FOR THE INVASION.IT FOLLOWED
SEVERAL YEARS OF DETERIORATING RELATIONS BETWEEN FRANCE AND
RUSSIA,AFTER A RATHER WOOLY AGREEMENT WAS REACHED IN TILSIT IN
1807.AT THAT TIME THE TZAR OF RUSSIA,ALEXANDER,WAS VERY EGAR TO
COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH NAPOLEON.THE RUSSIAN ARMY HAD BEEN
MAULED AT AUSTERLITZ,ONE OF NAPOLEON'S GREATEST SUCCESSES,AND THE
TZAR SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY OVERAWED BY THE FRENCH EMPORER.%
  DESPITE THE AGREEMENT REACHED,THERE WERE SEVERAL LONG STANDING
DIFFERENCES THAT REMAINED (AND STILL REMAIN !) TO NIGGLE BOTH
SIDES,NOTABLY THE FUTURE OF POLAND AND RUSSIA'S NEVER ENDING LUST
FOR A SOUTHERN PORT,IN THIS CASE CONSTANINOPLE.A FURTHER PROBLEM
WAS NAPOLEON'S INSISTENCE THAT RUSSIA ABIDE BY AN ECONOMIC
BLOCKADE OF GREAT BRITAIN,KNOWN AS THE CONTINENTAL SYSTEM.THIS WAS
MANIFESTLY NOT IN RUSSIA'S INTEREST,UPSETTING TRADE WITH GREAT
BRITAIN STARTED GROWING UNREST AMONG THE NOBILITY AND MERCHANTS.
  HOWEVER THESE PROBLEMS IN THEMSELVES ARE NOT THE CAUSES OF THE
MAJOR WARS.THE DECIDING ISSUE WAS NAPOLEON'S PERSONALITY.IF THERE
WAS ONE THING HE WAS NOT PREPARED TO TOLERATE,IT WAS A CHALLENGE
TO HIS PERSONAL POWER AND PRESTIGE.THE RUSSIANS WERE REJECTING HIS
POSITION OF MASTER OF EUROPE AND POSING AN INFLUENTIAL CHALLENGE
TO HIS AUTHORITY.IN EFFECT,NAPOLEON'S BLUFF WAS CALLED,AND
RELATIONS DETERIORATED TO THE POINT WHERE IT WAS A CHOICE BETWEEN
WAR AND A LOSS OF FACE.NAPOLEON CHOSE WAR.
  SHOWING HIS MASTERY OF PLANNING AND LOGISTICS,NAPOLEON ASSEMBLED
A HUGE ARMY OF AROUND 675,000 MEN.ON THE 23 JUNE 1812 THIS FORCE
STARTED CROSSING THE RIVER NIEMEN,THUS STARTING THE WAR IN
EARNEST.DIVIDED INTO THREE,HIS PLAN WAS TO TRAP THE RUSSIAN ARMY
AND CRUSH IT.BUT FOR THE INCOMPETANCE AND HESITANT NATURE OF SOME
OF HIS SUBORDINATES,IT MAY WELL HAVE SUCEEDED.BUT IT DID NOT.THE
LAST CHANCE FOR THE FRENCH TO SURROUND AT LEAST SOME OF THE
RUSSIAN ARMY WAS LOST AT THE BATTLE FOR THE CITY OF SMOLENSK.THIS
CITY WAS ABANDONED BY THE RUSSIANS ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 17TH.
  ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE,THE COMMANDER OF THE FIRST ARMY,BARCLAY DE
TOLLY,WAS WAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE SMALLER SECOND ARMY UNDER
PRINCE BARATION,WHO WAS MOVING UP FROM THE SOUTH.THEY DID NOT MEET
UNTIL SMOLENSK.THEIR  COMBINED FORCES OF 127,000 FROM THE FIRST
ARMY,AND 48,000 OF THE SECOND,ENABLED THE COMMANDERS TO CONSIDER A
MAJOR ACTION.
  MAINLY FOR POLITICAL REASONS,PRINCE KUTUSOV WAS GIVEN OVERALL
COMMAND OF THE COMBINED ARMIES ON AUGUST 29TH .HE WAS A SLOW,PLUMP,
BUT CRAFTY AND UNFLAPPABLE INDIVIDUAL.
  NAPOLEON COULD HAVE CONSOLIDATED HIS HOLD AROUND SMOLENSK, AND
WINTERED THERE.HE CERTAINLY CONSIDERED THIS, BUT HIS MILITARY
INSTINCTS SEEM TO HAVE WON THE DAY,AND HE DECIDED TO PRESS ON
DESPITE THE HUGELY OVERSTRECTCHED SUPPLY LINES BACK WEST.IT WAS
NOT UNTIL HIS TROOPS APPROACHED  THE RIVER KALATSHA,BRIDGED AT THE
VILLAGE OF BORODINO, THAT THEY FINALLY SAW THE MASSED RANKS OF THE
TWO RUSSIAN ARMIES,DIGGING IN AND PREPARING FOR BATTLLE.

  BORODINO IS ABOUT 70 MILES WEST OF MOSCOW.IT IS OF LITTLE
SIGNIFICANCE ITSELF,BUT IT IS WHERE THE RUSSIAN COMMANDER IN
CHIEF,KUTUSOV,CHOSE TO MAKE HIS STAND.IT WAS THE LAST CHANCE OF
HOLDING OUT TO PREVENT THE FALL OF MOSCOW.SEPTEMBER 5TH SAW A
FIERCE BATTLE FOR THE ADVANCED RUSSIAN REDOUBT AT SHEVARDINO.THIS
EVENTUALLY FELL WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE FRENCH 5TH CORP UNDER
PONIATOVSKI,AS THE POSITON WAS THE OUTFLANKED.KUTUSOV THEN ORDERED
A WITHDRAWAL TO THE MAIN DEFENCE LINE.
  SEPTEMBER 6TH SAW A DAY OT ALMOST UNREAL CALM.BOTH SIDES WERE SO
PREOCCUPIED WITH PREPERATIONS SUCH AS THE RUSSIANS BUILDING
EARTHWORKS AND THE FRENCH, PONTOONS OVER THE RIVER,THAT THERE ARE
NO REPORTS OF ANY SIGNIFICANT ACTION.
  THIS CALM PROVED TO BE THE LULL BEFORE THE STORM.ON SEPTEMBER 7TH
THE BATTLE PROVED TO BE ONE OF THE BLOODIEST OF ALL TIME..
  THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS WERE INITALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE EXACT LINE
OF NAPOLEON'S ATTACK,AND PREPARED TO DEFEND A 5 MILE LINE FROM THE
VILLAGE OF UTITSA TO THE JUNCTION OF THE RIVERS KALATSHA AND
MOSKVA.THE CENTREPIECE OF THE DEFENCES WAS A LARGE EARTHWORK,JUST
EAST OF THE BRIDGE AT BORODINO,CALLED THE GREAT REDOUBT.FURTHER
SOUTH THREE ARROW SHAPED FORTS,CALLED THE FLETCHES,PROTECTED THE
CENTER LEFT. UTITSA ITSELF WAS NOT PROTECTED BY EARTHWORKS OF ANY
SIGNIFICANCE,AND NORTH OF BORODINO THE RUSSIANS DEFENCES FOLLOWED
THE LINE OF KALATSHA.
  THE RUSSIANS HAD AROUND 120,000 MEN AT BORODINO ,INCLUDING
17,000 REGULAR CAVALRY, 7,000 COSSACKS, 10,000 HASTILY FORMED
VOLUNTEER MILITIAMEN AND 640 PIECES OF ARTILLERY,THE FRENCH HAD A
SLIGHT NUMERICAL ADVANTAGE WITH 131,000 MEN , AND 587 GUNS.
INCLUDING 28,000 CAVALERY AND 587 GUNS.
  FOR REASONS BEST KNOWN TO HIMSELF,NAPOLEON HAD ONE OF HIS WORST
OFF DAYS,AND DID NOT PLAN ANYTHING MORE THAN A FRONTAL
ASSUALT.DESPITE HAVING SEVERAL MILES OF ROOM FOR SOME
MANOEUVRE,MOST OF THE FIGHTING  SURROUNDED THE GREAT REDOUBT AND
THE FLETCHES.THESE EVENTULY FELL AND THE RUSSIANS WERE PUSHED BACK
TO FORM A LINE ALONG THE RIDGES BEHIND THEM. SIDESHOWS INCLUDED THE
CAPTURE OF UTITSA, PONIATOVKSI,AND AN INSPIRED COUNTER ATTACK BY
SOME RUSSIAN CAVALRY ACROSS KALATSHA TO THE NORTH. THIS ACHIEVED
LITTLE,BUT DELAYED EVENTS FURTHER SOUTH BY A VITAL HOUR,AS
KUTUSOV WAS HURRIDLY BOLSTERING HIS LEFT FLANK WITH DIVIONS
BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE NORTH.
  KUTUSOV PLANNED TO CONTINUE THE DEFENCE INTO A SECOND DAY, IT
WAS ONLY WHEN THE CASUALTY REPORTS CAME IN THAT HE CHANGED HIS
MIND. LOSSES WERE HUGE, ESTMATES VARY BUT CASUALATIES WERE IN THE
ORDER OF 40-50,000 EACH SIDE,A TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE THAT ACHIEVED
SO LITTLE,KATUSOV ORDERED A WITHDRAWAL OVERNIGHT,LEAVING THE CAMP
FIRES BURNING ( TO PRETEND NOTHING WAS HAPPENING ) TO DELAY THE
FRENCH PERSUIT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.
  THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS TECHNICALLY A FRENCH VICTORY,AT LEAST
IT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED AS SUCH IN WESTERN ACCOUNTS.A BLOODY DRAW
WOULD SEEM MORE ACCURATE.THE FRNCH ARMY WAS SO BADDLY BATTERED ITS
ADVANCE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A
PERSUIT.MOSCOW WAS ABANDONED TO IT A FEW DAYS LATER, AS NO OBVIOUS
DEFENCE LINE EXISTED.
  NAPOLEON WAITED IN MOSCOW FOR THE TZAR TO OFFER PEACE TERMS.BUT
THE TZAR DID NOT GIVE IN,AND NAPOLEON WAS EVENTUALLY FORCED INTO A
RETREAT THROUGH THE RUSSIAN WINTER.THIS RETREAT WAS CHARACTERISED
BY A WHOLE SERIES OF SMALLER BATTLES,SOME WHERE NAPOLEON SHOWED

CONSIDERABLE GENIUS IN ENABLING HIS ARMY TO ESCAPE.CONTRARY TO THE
POPULAR MYTH THAT THE FRENCH ARMY DIED IN THE COLD, MOST OF THE
SOLDIERS DIED IN THE FIGHTING,OR AS A RESULT OF THEIR WOUNDS.
  THE SHATTERED REMNANTS OF THE GRAND ARMY DID ESCAPE,BUT WITH THE
LOSS OF 570,000 MEN AND ALMOST ALL THE 200,000 HORSES.STRANGELY
PERHAPS,NAPOLEON WAS GREETED AS A HERO WHEN HE FINALLY GOT BACK TO
PARIS,NEVERTHELESS,HE MUST HAVE DEEPLY REGRETTED HIS DECISION TO
INVADE RUSSIA IN THE FIRST PLACE: THE GRAND ARMY COULD NEVER
RECOVER.
