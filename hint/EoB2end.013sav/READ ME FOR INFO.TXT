This is a saved game for use with the Amiga version of Eye of the Beholder II:
Legend of Darkmoon. Simply replace your file EOBDATA0.SAV with my file of the
same name. Start the game and load the first game on the menu "Watchman's
 Solution". You will then be facing in the direction of the final stage of
EOB II; take a left turn and face Dran for a fight to the death. Oh and by
the way you may notice that I have altered the characteristics of my characters
just a little (Every little bit counts) so enjoy the power of your mage and 
cleric who are both on full exp. points with full spell usage. The health points
of each character have also been artificially improved with a steroid type
program that is freely available to anyone who is interested. If you are
interested in super characters right from the beginning of the game,
contact me on the following boards: Ability bbs- (03)-807-0743
                                    Compu-talk   (03)-379-2097
                                    Club Amiga   (03)-527-2835
or where you'll always find me      Andy's Attic (03)-749-4897

Disclaimer: I am not seeking finacial reward in any way for this service
so feel free to contact WATCHMAN for a consultation on how to beat EOB II
Simply contact me and arrange a time to upload me your saved game and I'll
process it and return it with the super characters you desire.

P.S. EOB II is a great game in my opinion and I advise anyone who has any 
contact with it (i.e. plays it) to purchase the original. Watchman in no
way condones the use of pirated software. My cheats are designed for 
originals only. Good Luck with Dran and many happy adventures to you all!
