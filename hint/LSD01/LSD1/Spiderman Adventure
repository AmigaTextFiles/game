Some commands that you can use:

L - LOOK               E - GO EAST              W - GO WEST

N - GO NORTH           S - GO SOUTH

Z - Turn on/off pictures.  Won't access the disk when off!

\ - Move picture so text is/isn't seen

PON  - Turn on printer         POFF - Turn off printer

QUIT GAME - End game           SAVE GAME - Save game *

RESTORE GAME - Restore save game *

* Will ask for a seperate formatted disk to use for save games.

** IMPORTANT -- To save a game on the program disk, ramdisk or hard drive
first REMOVE file: WPROTECT. This file may also be double clicked on and
read. Each save game takes 17k of disk space!

The mouse and its buttons may be also used to move the picture on the
screen.

** NOTE PLEASE: It is highly recommended you just use the \ key. This key
is the same as the left mouse button. It will always move the picture
right above the text that just scrolled under! Hitting it again will
restore the picture to full screen!

When the you hear a Bell or on a color monitor the screen turns green,
you must hit return before anything else happens. (Except you may use the
mouse or \ key!)

This program supports both Color and Monochrome monitors.

To play just double click on the PROGRAM icon.
