THE GAME
You've just made a long, hard climb up the rocky cliff  beneath  Akuma's
Castle.   You pull yourself up onto solid ground only  to  find  yourself
standing before a massive gateway,  your way barred by the first of the
palace guards.  Beyond looms Akuma's palace, where the fair Princess
Mariko
is being held captive.  You must rescue her from the evil Akuma.

You  can withstand only a limited number of hits.   The row of  red
arrows
across  the bottom left of the screen tells you how many.   Every time
you
get hit,  you lose one arrow.  If your last arrow disappears, you die.
The
row  of  blue arrows across the bottom right of the  screen  indicates
the
strength of your opponent.  As long as you avoid getting hit, your
strength
will be replenished.

Every guard has a different headgear and fighting style.   As a  rule,
the
guards get tougher as you advance into the palace.

When you kill a guard,  take advantage of the opportunity and run
forward.
Watch  for  danger when you're standing or  running.   In  these
positions
you're vulnerable to attack - one well-aimed blow could kill you!
