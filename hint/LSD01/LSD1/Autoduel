MOVEMENT:
All movement in Autoduel is controlled with either a joystick or a
mouse.

If you are using a joystick, simply push the lever in the direction
you wish to travel.  Centering the joystick will cause your vehicle
to coast to a stop, while pulling the joystick in the opposite
direction of travel will result in a braking and eventual reverse
movement.

If you are using a mouse, aim the arrow in the direction you want to
head in. Centering the arrow upon the car will cause it to stop.

SAVING CHARACTERS:
Characters can be saved three different ways:
1.  They can be saved directly to the game disk (Disk B).
2.  A formatted disk can be used to save characters when prompted at
    the main menu.
3.  A copy of Disk B can be used to save characters for archival
    purposes or for the playing of simultaneous games.

Special Note:  As your drive grows in Prestige, special courier tasks
will be offered to you through a series of clues.  It is advantageous
to pursue these missions whenever possible.  Check for rumors at the
Truck Stops and Bars for information on these special tasks.
