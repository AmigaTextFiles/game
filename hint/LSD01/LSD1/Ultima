     SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  An Amiga 500, 1000, 2000, 2500HD or 2500UX with
                           at least 512K of memory. The fact that you're
                           reading this means that this can't be too much
                           of a problem.	

i) Ultima Update!
=================

          This is an abbreviated list of new features and functions found
     in this release of Ultima. Note that all changes noted here will be dealt
     with in detail in this documentation file, but are presented here as a
     summary of sorts.

     Change the First:

          Improved graphics. The screen now has three windows, not two,
     with the increasingly useful Sidebar getting its own. Several
     graphic icons have been added, and others have been improved. 
     There's no title screen as of yet (In fact, any submissions of
     viable 320 x 200 lo-res title screen graphics will be considered.
     If I use your picture, you get your name in the credits. That's it.
     [Thus, more financially minded artists should go enter the Moria
     contest.]) There are, however, death and victory graphic screens.
          Scrolling is MUCH faster, much to the disappointment of those
     many fans who send me letters of appreciation detailing how much
     they liked going out for a spot of lunch between screen redraws.

     Change the Second:

          Populated towns! Yes, you can now enter Castle Ardon or the
     Town of Garolin (Farpath was demolished to make room for a shopping
     center, but the plans have not yet come into effect), explore their
     lavishly-detailed interiors, talk with the various inhabitants, go
     shopping at some of the stores, and generally make a nuisance of
     yourself. Now I know from experience that every player of any Ultima-
     type game gets few greater pleasures out of life than laying waste
     to innocent cities, looting and pillaging, wiping out the local
     militia with the wave of a wand, and similar activities; and thus I
     have prohibited combat within the walls of any city or town. This
     may change in future versions. Speaking of combat...

     Change the Third:

          An improved combat system! (Or should I say, "a combat system!"?)
     Your character can now select the weapon of his or her choice with which
     to cleave apart the local fauna, and can wear a variety of protective
     armors. Why? Because I, buffetted with epithet-enlaiden complaints by
     the Monster's Union, have programmed the monsters to fight BACK. That's
     right, the monsters no longer wander about aimlessly, but come directly
     at YOU. Thus, you bloodthirsty maniacs who delighted in how the creatures
     of the Ultima 0.5 DEMO paid no attention to their own defense are in
     for something of a shock. 

     Change the Fourth:

          Greater character development. Your character actually has hit 
     points and gold measurements, and such, and they have a greater role
     in game play. Most notably, if you run out of hit points, you die.
     There's still no choice of class or race, however.

     Change the Fifth:

          Miscellaneous new commands. You'll be delighted with a plethora
     of new and exciting options and commands that await your keypress.
     My favorite is the Talk command...

     Change the Sixth:

          You'll note that the long-awaited (by me) Textfile of Lore
     accompanies this version of Ultima. It basically serves to create
     a history and meaning behind the game, and give everything a sense
     of atmosphere. Most of the things it describes haven't actually
     been implemented in the game, but do give you an inkling of what's
     to come in future releases.

     Change the Seventh:

          The much-needed Load, Save, and Restart features have been
     laboriously thrown in.

     Other Changes:

          There are many other minor sundry alterations that should become
     apparent during game play. The code itself has also been revamped and
     debugged in ways that may not become apparent during play, but
     would surely elicit a low whistle from you programmers out there. 
     Anyway, all these features, and the new rules of game play, will be
     discussed presently. If you're a veteran Ultimaian, you may just want to
     skim the Version Notes. Or maybe you're so entranced with my acerbic
     prose style that you'll want to savor every semicolon and re-read
     everything for nostalgia's sake. Do what you like.     


1) What is Ultima?
==================

Ultima is a blatant would-be Ultima rip-off whose sole purpose is to serve
as a emotional vent for the author's suppressed frustrations and anxieties
that he's incapable of writing any sort of functional program longer than
five lines or so.	

In Ultima, you assemble a stalwart band of adventurers comprising of yourself 
and nobody else, and explore a mythical world of sorcery, horrific monsters,
and fabulous treasure; in short, the typical fantasy role-playing plot
surrogate.  The actual goal of the game varies in both difficulty and
nature with the revision of the program itself.

 
2) How do I play Ultima?
========================

The same way I play Ultima, albeit hopefully with more patience. Simply 
double-click the program's icon (from the Workbench).  Otherwise,
from the CLI, simply type 

	1> Ultima

 ... and the program will run. Simple, eh?


3) What's the goal of the game?
===============================

The object of Ultima is to slay certain monsters in a certain order as
dictated by the King of Dieria (a simple sub-plot being the actual
finding of the King), after which you are awarded unimaginable riches
and win the game.

This may not seem like much of a difference from the last version game until
you realize that killing a monster can be tricky, and may require special
weapons or magic.

The goal and plot of the game shall increase considerably in complexity
in upcoming versions, and shall possibly involve more than mindless violence.
Look for some sort of dungeon in the next release, as well as a bigger
landscape.


4) How do I go about accomplishing it?
======================================

First start the game, as explained in step 2.

Now you'll notice a panoramic display of the crudely-drawn, low-resolution
map of the world of Ultima.  You may now control the actions of your
adventurous alter-ego, who is always displayed at the center of the 
screen, as you attempt to reach whatever the current goal of the game is.

There are many different commands you can use from the main map, the list
of which will hope expand in future versions.  Note that some commands
may also be activated by use of the Intuition menus.

The current commands are:

	(Movement)

	Movement in the four main cardinal directions (you know; north, south,
	whatever) is possible by using the numeric keypad.  These keys must
	also be used when a direction is called for as secondary input for
	another command.

                7            8 (North)      9

         (West) 4            5 (Rest)       6 (East)

                1            2 (South)      3
 						
	A) Attack + [direction]
		This allows you to impart physical violence unto the monster
	of your choice.  Your strike may draw blood, or swish by without
	effect, depending on many factors, such as your skill at fighting
	and the weapon you are currently using.  Have no moral qualms about
	laying waste to any of the horrid beasties that wander around the
	mainland -- without exception, they are vile, merciless, and
	olfactorily unpleasant minions of Evil, and deserve their gruesome
	fates.  Upon slaying a creature, you will be awarded experience
	points and any treasure the monster was carrying, as appropriate. 

	VERSION NOTES (1.0): More monster types have been added, and, as
     said, all creatures will now actively seek you out and attack you.
     They do follow you fairly tenaciously, and will even try to "un-stick"
     themselves if you lure them into a corner. One type of monster simply
     cannot be killed by physical violence, and requires some other method.
     (Plot ho, cap'n! Plot ho!) There's a variety of weapons and armor you
     can purchase, and upon slaying any creature you are now awarded with
     gold and experience. If you're being trampled by a monster that's
     particularly nasty, try running away. If you get out of the monsters's
     sight for a long enough period of time, chances are that it'll get
     bored of looking for you and wander off in pursuit of other things.

	C) Cast
		This allows your character to cast any spell that he or she
	knows.

     VERSION NOTES (1.0): The role of spells and magic in this version is
     very limited, but essential to victory.

	E) Enter
		This will allow you to enter a dungeon, castle, town, or
	other structure of that nature.  You must be currently on top of
	whatever you wish to enter.

     VERSION NOTES (1.0): You can now actually explore the interiors of
     the Castle Ardon and town Garolin, and indeed must, if you wish to
     get anywhere in the game. They're nice places to visit, and house
     many interesting characters and stores that are necessary to the
     completion of your quest. There will be more towns, cities, 
     castles, and perhaps a dungeon or two, in upcoming versions.

	I) Inventory
		This will simply display a nice list of all your character's
	possessions, including any armor or weaponry being used.

	L) Look + [direction]
		This will allow you to identify or examine anything lying
	one square in any of the allowable directions away from you.  For
	instance, if directly to the north of you stood a towering monster,
	and you wished to know precisely what species of monster it was, 
	you could type "L", then "8", and would then be told that, for
	example, "You see an Ogre."  You can also identify terrain types
	this way.

	O) Offer + [direction]
		Should you wish to practice financial cajolery upon a local
	Ultima resident, or simply make a generous gift, select this option.
	You will be prompted for the amount to offer, ranging from 100 to
	900 gold pieces in increments of 100. Note that monsters usually
	aren't terribly inclined to take bribes, if they even know what
	gold is.

	Q) Quit
		I must concede that it is vaguely conceivable that you 
	may wish to interrupt your fervid Ultima-playing once every few
	hours to perform mundane activities, such as eating, sleeping,
	and other trivial fare.  The Quit command will exit back to either
	the WorkBench, or AmigaDOS, depending upon how you started the
	program.

     VERSION NOTES (1.0): Note the spiffy Quit requester, as well as the
     save and load game options that help make trans-game Ultimaing a
     pleasure.

	R) Ready
		This option allows one to wield any weapon he or she possesses.
	Upon selecting this option, one is presented with a list of his
	or her weapons, if he or she possesses any, and is prompted to
	select which weapon he or she would like to ready. Only one weapon
	can be readied at a time. Thus, when a weapon is selected, it 
	disappears from the list, and any weapon that was previously
	readied will re-appear on the list. Unless one has a weapon in hand, 
	one cannot fight hostile foes, either in assault or self-defense.
	Thus, the unarmed adventurer is very vulnerable. 

	Note that selecting this option when one is already using one's
	only weapon will automatically un-ready that weapon.

	S) Status
		This option will replace the view with a screen displaying
	pertinent information about your character that isn't displayed on
	the sidebar. It is as follows:

          Class: This is the class (profession) of your character. Classes
                 include fighter, thief, wizard, etc. (See the Textfile
                 of Lore for more details).

          Level: This is the experience level of your character. As you
                 defeat more monsters, this number increases, as does
                 the power of your character.

         HP Max: This shows the maximum number of hit points your character
                 has when perfectly healthy (as opposed to his or her
                 current hit points as displayed on the Sidebar).

         MP Max: Similar to HP Max, this shows the highest number of Magic
                 Points your character can have at a given moment. 

     Experience: This shows the number of experience points you have. If you
                 gain enough experience, your Level may increase.

     Body Count: This is a measure in cadavers of just how many creatures
                 to whom you've laid waste.  It has no function in game
                 play save the feeding of your bloodthirsty ego.

 Current Weapon: This informs you of whatever tool of death your character
                 is currently using to obliterate the foul beasties of Ultima,
                 if any. You select this weapon with the Ready command.

  Current Armor: This displays the type of armor you're currently wearing.
                 You select this via the Wear command.

           Gold: A numerical representation of your wealth in gold pieces,
                 the standard unit of currency in most of the kingdoms of
                 Ultima. All adventurers start the game with 30 gp. (Note the
                 poignant symbolism here.)

	T) Talk + [direction]
		This allows you to interact with the various inhabitants of
	Ultima. While few people will offer any elongated conversation, you
	may get a few interesting snippets hither or thither. Upon occasion,
	you may even be asked a simple yes or no question. Talking with
	a shopkeeper may allow you to purchase goods or services. You can
	talk over some tables and counters, as well. 

	V) Version
		This will display the author's name, in case you haven't
	yet memorized it, as well as the current version of the game, so 
	that you can see exactly how primitive a rendition of Ultima you're
	playing. It also shows a brief list of some of those selfless
	morons who helped make Ultima what it is today. (Whatever it is...)

	W) Wear
		This option is similar to the Ready command, save that it allows
	an adventurer to wear the protective armor of his or her choice, if he
	or she owns any. Armor makes it more difficult to be struck by an 
	opponent's assault, and will sometimes absorb damage from a blow.
	Note that selecting this option when one is wearing one's only
	armor will automatically remove that armor.

	Y) Clock
		This will display the time, in game turns. Truth to tell, it's
	a pretty useless command, but I use it in debugging. The one purpose
	that it could serve for a player is keeping track of potential
	purchases; stores will refresh their inventories at set turn intervals.
	(Thus, if you don't see a weapon you can afford at the moment, hang
	around!) Keep in mind that time will not pass while you use this
	command.

	Z) Coordinates
		Another useless but faintly amusing debugging command, this
	option will display your X-Y coordinates in whatever region you happen
	to be.

There are also some options accessible via the pull-down menus. Some are
merely Intuitive equivalents of keyboard options (I know that nobody really
believes that dragging a mouse across your desk is significantly more
convenient than pressing "I", but let's face facts: the more menus and 
sub-menus a program has, the more professional it looks. So get off my back.) 
while others can only be selected in this manner (or their respective
shortcuts).

GAME MENU
---------

About - This is the menu equivalent of the "Version" command.

Load Game - This option allows you to continue a previously saved game.

Save Game - This option allows you to save the current state of the game to
            disk for future play, should you opt to do that sort of thing.

     VERSION NOTES (1.0):  I really didn't think I'd include this option in
	this version of the game, but it occurred to me that playing might be 
	a real drag if you had to restart from the beginning each time 
	a troll slit your gullet, so I threw this hack together. As you
	can see, it's somewhat crude; there is no file requester, as there
	is no selectable filename. The game will be saved to a file called
	"Save" in RAM: (don't worry about running out of memory... the
	file is extremely small). This does mean that if you want to play
	a saved game after re-boot, REMEMBER TO COPY IT TO DISK. It's
	inconvenient, but I'm a lazy programmer. The next version will
	have some sort of file requester, I promise. Really.
  
Restart - This option will reset Ultima to its default configuration. It's the
          equivalent of re-booting the game, but more convenient.

Quit - This is the Intuition equivalent of the Quit command.


ACTION MENU
-----------

Inventory - This is the equivalent of the "Inventory" command.

Status - This is the equivalent of the "Status" command.	

Help   - This displays an abbreviated list of commands.

Redraw - Should you encounter some sort of onscreen graphics bug, this will
         allow you to remedy the situation by redrawing the screen's
         contents.


5) I don't understand the display. What are all these numbers?
==============================================================

As of the current version, the display is divided into three segments.

The majority of the screen is a graphic representation of your adventurer
and the terrain and monsters surrounding him.  As he moves around Ultima, 
the terrain will scroll relative to his position.  

The left quarter of the screen is what Infocom calls the Status Bar, and
subsequently I must call the Sidebar for fear of litigation.  You
will see all information about your character and his attributes displayed
here. These are as follows:

     NAME: This is pretty easy to figure out.

      STR: This is a numerical measure of the physical strength of your
           silicon protagonist, ranging from 0 (a gelatinous pile of
           flesh) to 99 (Rambo-like proportions).  Values of above
           99 are possible, but not for human beings unaided by powerful
           magic. 

      WIS: This is similar to the STR value, but measures the wit and
           intelligence of your character.  When more spells are implemented,
           this attribute will be important for wizards and other
           thaumaturgic creatures.

      AGL: This is a measure of your character's agility -- meaning a
           loose representation of physical and manual dexterity, 
           handiness, and speed.

      LVL: This is a measure of your character's ability to excel in his or
           her profession. (IE: A level 4 fighter would generally be a more 
           skilled warrior than a level 1 fighter.) Higher levels are
           achieved through earned experience points.

       MP: Standing for Magic Points, this is a measure of your character's
           magical strength, if any. Casting spells will exhaust a number
           of magic points proportional to the difficulty of the spell.
           Fighter types usually have no magical ability whatsoever.
           Usually.

       HP: This is your character's Hit Point Value, or the amount of
           points of Damage (imparted by monsters, traps, hostile magic,
           dishpan hands, etc.) your character can sustain before (gasp) death.


     VERSION NOTES (1.0): The Display area is now fairly functional. While
     your character's abilities are taken into consideration in various
     activities, his or her name, strength, wisdom, and agility still
     have identical starting values -- that is, there's no true character 
     development yet. This WILL be implemented in the next version. I swear.


6) But what of this Land of Ultima?  How did it come to be? Who lives there?
============================================================================

Apt questions, all.  The history of Ultima, and a more flavored and detailed
explanation of the peoples, places, and things of Ultima are expounded upon
in nauseating eloquence in the Textfile of Lore that accompanies this
file. Keep in mind that many of the things described in the Textfile are
atmospheric, and may have no bearing upon game play.


7) And all these game versions? What of them?
=============================================

This is, as admitted, the first "true" release of Ultima -- prior to this,
rabid Ultima fans had to contend themselves with a fairly pathetic demo
that circulated the BBS world. It's a fairly playable game, I like to
convince myself, but will be greatly enriched and endetailed (is that
a word?) in future versions.
 
I've mentioned several enhancements that are planned for future releases,
but I'm also toying with a few entirely new features. Here's a list of
things that MAY show up in the next version or later. User input is 
always welcomed, of course.

     - The game desperately needs sound. As soon as I cut down CHIP RAM
       requirements somewhat, I can afford to implement this. The way I
       see this, sound could go three ways:

          1) Simple Amiga-generated sound routines embedded in the C code.
             This would yield blurps and blips (aka Ultima on an IBM or
             Apple) but nothing astounding. It would also eat up the
             least amount of memory.

          2) Digitized sound effects. Perhaps an "ARRGH!" when you're
             hit in combat, or the clanking of swords, or the cry of
             a monster. Or maybe I should digitize voices saying each
             character's interactive one-liner, and only release the
             game on a 30-meg hard drive. In any case, this will slurp
             up oodles of memory, but be well worth it.

          3) Sonix-Driven music! If I keep the instruments simple, I could
             see if it's allowed for authors to include the Sonix music
             driver with programs and fit quite a few original melodies
             in. This what they do in the excellent RPG Alternate Reality,
             and the effect is great.

     - Day and night effects. Darkness and such.

     - Weather conditions, such as rain or snow.

     - 16-color graphics. Granted, this wouldn't look as pretty, but it would
       cut memory costs drastically. It ALSO means that I have to go over
       each and every graphic in the game. I wish I had thought of this before.
       Sigh.

     - Multiple character support. Expect this one fur shure, because I've
       already started coding it.

     - A bigger world map! This is a near-certainty. The isle of Dieria is
       wearing somewhat thin.

     - Character classes + Magic. I promise more magical spells by the next
       version, and perhaps character classes as well. I reserve the right
       to lie outrageously in this matter, so don't yell at me if I don't
       come through.

Now, the typical shareware author takes pains to remind you that he or she
is a living, breathing, and often starving human being, and paints a 
mawkish picture of himself slaving away at the keyboard for months, honing
and perfecting a product that he believes will do good for the Amiga
community.  He then  releases it as shareware or PD, and pleads for
ridiculous sums of cash, sometimes in exchange for appearance on a 
"Registered User List".
 
My view is this: If I wanted this to be a money-making venture, I'd make
it commercial.  Much to the disappointment of the legal staff of Origin 
Systems, I've decided not to take this path, and thus shan't shower you
with pleas for altruistic donations. Not that I'll REFUSE them, heavens
no, but that I don't abide under the pretense that it's your obligation
to pay them. In other words, if you value this program to the extent that
you wish to send in a $10 donation or something similar, by all means, 
go ahead. You'll have a friend for life, I assure you. But I won't despise
you if you don't. (In fact, I'll have a somewhat higher estimate of your
sensibilities.)

What I WOULD like, however -- and I ask this, not demand it as a right --
is feedback on this program from anyone who doesn't disgustedly delete
it outright. It's still in production, as you no doubt guessed, and can
assume a variety of different incarnations from here on. I'll continue
working on the program even if nobody admits to having downloaded it,
but it will surely be a better product should suggestions be made.

The best way to leave a comment is through EMAIL.  I belong to no
nationwide networks, so forget CompuSturge or anything like that. You
can EMAIL me on one of the following BBS's, however (all of which I
recommend heartily) in the New Yawk area: 
 
  AMUG		(516) 234 - 6046  [Leave EMAIL to "Mike Shapiro"]
  Battlefield	(718) 225 - 9083  [Leave EMAIL to "Mike Shapiro"]
  LiveLine	(718) 332 - 1330  [Multiuser : Leave EMAIL to "Iago"]

  (Note that you'll actually have to register as a user in each case
   before accessing EMAIL functions, but I recommend this anyway.)

  Or if you prefer to write:
 
     Mike Shapiro
     23 Ridge Drive East
     Great Neck, NY 11021

 In addition to your praise/condemnation, I'd appreciate reports of any
 bugs you find.

VERSION NOTES: (1.0)  Now that the basic flavor of the game has been
established in this version, I'd really like commentary -- not just 
suggestions for new features, but complaints or praise on game play itself.
Is it too hard? Too easy? Generally unappealing? Bug reports are always
welcomed, as well.

Other programs by Mike Shapiro:
 
	DeFunct         - Function key simulator. (It's cute.)
	CLIColor        - Simple ANSI command. (It's useless.)
	Second Conflict - Amiga conversion of Galloway + Markgraf's hit IBM
				space wargame! (Forthcoming, I suppose.)


A Final Note: 
=============

"In one word he teach me secret of success . . . plagiarize!"

								- Tom Lehrer

	You may find Ultima as boring as watching gastric mitosis, or spend your
every waking moment burning its 32-color screens into your retinas. In
either case, one adjective that should not be applied to Ultima is
"original".

	That's right, blokes. In case you weren't aware of this, this game is
entirely modelled (in terms of interface and gameplay, if not actual names,
characters, or events) after Lord British's justifiably successful Ultima
series. If you like Ultima, you'll like these games that I am so eloquently
ripping off, despite the fact that the Amiga ports are of relatively
poor quality. I am only making this plug out of a sense of duty and
admiration for Mr. British's fine works.

	And, of course, to discourage a lawsuit on his part. 

	As for this history of this program, it actually originated as a 
programming exercise (I know, I know. I'm now on Chris Crawford's hit
list. But what can one do?), and it eventually occurred to me that I
might hoist the mess of garbled code onto the Public Domain. And so I
did. Was it a mistake?

	That, of course, is for you to decide.
