veteran looking for something different to do?  Have you actually bought the
game yet?

This is an Amigaguide hypertext database overflowing  with facts, hints, and
anything else I could think of which had any relevance to Frontier: Elite II
and acts as a reference work for those Frontier addicts out there.

Also, remember that Frontier and associated documentation is @{" Copyright " LINK Copyright}.

@NODE Questions "Questions and Answers"
The following  is a  list of problems encountered by various persons presented
in the form of a question and answer session :

Q: @{"How do I proceed to the next rank?" LINK ranks}

Q: How do I get out really far quickly?

A: Apparently,  there is a 'bug' called 'Short Wormhole' which enables you to
do just this.   What you do,  is scroll the system map out far - thousands of
light years.  Soon, the message 'Out of Range' will change to 'Fuel Required:
[n]t',  where [n] is the fuel in tonnes.  Try it,  and tell me if it works in
your copy - my updated version does not allow this, but it might in yours.

Q: How do I zoom FAST in the system map ?

A: Center the planet or space station and double-click on the Zoom icon.

Q: How can I reach my destination faster once I am in the system ?

A: Use the  autopilot to turn  you towards the  destination. Switch to highest
speed.  Now turn the  autopilot off and accelerate by hand (using the "Engines
Off"-state) until  you have reached about 20.000 km/s or about 1AU distance to
the target.  At about 1AU  distance  to  target  (or earlier)  switch  on  the
autopilot and you will be there.  You use up less fuel this way also.

Q: When I  use the autopilot to  take me to the  vicinity of a certain planet,
the end-speed is too high. I always crash into to planet.

A: Note  that your main engines are more powerful then the retros. If you need
a fast stop, turn your  ship around and use  the main engines to slow down, or
manually switch back to manual (and normal time) before the autopilot arrives.
Now point the  craft at the  horizon (edge)  of the destination planet, reduce
set speed to zero, and accelerate time X3 or X4.  Just keep the craft pointing
away from the surface, and all should be well.


Q: How do I fit a different hyperdrive to an imperial ship?

A: Simple.  Kit  up your ship  with the bare  minimum (I'll  explain why  in a
minute) required to survive a fight, and fill up your ship with fuel. Now just
hyperspace back and  forward between relatively  safe systems,  trying to stay
near one  which sells the  hyperdrive you want.  Do  this for a  year  without
maintaining your  drive, and with luck and very little real  time, your  drive
will  crumble due to  lack of  maintainance.  Now  autopilot  to  the  nearest
spacestation,  sell the  rubbish,  and  get  yourself  a  drive  and  whatever
accessories you wish.  The fact  you freed  up cargo  space by not packing too
much equipment  meant  you  could have  more  fuel,  reducing  the  number  of
refueling trips required.


Q: What are the consequences of failing a military mission?

A: I think that the number of successful missions you have carried out will be
reduced by one - ie. you get promoted to Lord, and you fail your first mission
as a Lord, you will be demoted.


Q: How do I get a camera ?

A: If you have solved several military missions, you will be offered Espionage
missions where you have to photograph a secret installation.   Very dangerous!
Hot tip : When  doing these missions, just  fly in straight  over the planet's
horizon to get as close a  possible before  they notice you.  When they do, DO
NOT VEER FROM THE COURSE AND ATTACK THEM. The chances are you would only crash
instead.  So, wait  until you are  close to the  base and  lots  of  dots  are
clustered in your scanner.  Now whack them with the energy bomb.

Q: How do I get permits for a system?

A: You must get a civilian contract to them someone or a package to the system
in question.  Now ask them  for the  permit.  Remember,  only wait  for such a
contract to turn up in a system nearby to the one requiring the permit.


Q: When I start Frontier from CLI, it hangs after some time.

A: Frontier needs a large stack. Just type in @{B}Stack 65600@{uB} followed by @{B}Frontier@{uB}
(providing you are in the correct directory).

   It might be just my imagination, but my copy seems to run a tad faster with
   a large stack - say, 100000.  Try it!!


Q: How much should I pay to the crew ?

A: That depends.  If you are trading, you will make so much money in your trip
that the crew wages will not matter one whit.  However, if you are just flying
around being a nuisance, pay as low as possible.  Its up to you.


Q: Help me!  The pirates are always whipping my ass!

A: Did you know that  you can pause the game,  target the pirate  and  fire  a
missile after him?

@{"Unsolved Mysteries..." LINK Unknowns}
@ENDNODE

@NODE Unknowns "Questions I would like to have an answer to...."
The following are  questions I do  not have an  answer to.  Some  are probably
impossible, but  if someone writes  in and informs me of the answers to any of
them, I  will update the  database accordingly and give that individual credit
within the file (so  and give me your details).

Here goes :

Q: How do I clean my legal status ?

Q: How do I build in a fuel scoop into an imperial or big ship ?

Q: How do I explore unknown stellar systems ?

Q: What is / How do I get the Mirage?

Q: How do you get the Military Drive mark 4 and the Fighter Launch?
   (Yes - the Fighter Launch DOES exist - but what or why or how???)

Q: Can you eventually get to own a Long Range Cruiser or Lynx Bulk Carrier?

Q: Is it possible to destroy  Space Stations and / Ground  Installations using
Large Plasma Accelerator?  If so, how long does it take?

Q: In the list of important dates in the gazetteer, there is mentioned the one
alien artifact found orbiting  somewhere - where  is it and what is it?  Is it
the Mirage?

Q: Is it possible to quit out of Frontier back to  WorkBench - or does it kill
the operating system and take over?

Q: What happened to the other ships from the original - like the Fer de Lance.
The snake itself is deadly beyond anything, the ship sounds a real treat!

Q: What  the hell happened to  the millions of  other races mentioned  in  the
'Dark Wheel' ( as I think it was called )?

Q: Are the PC and Amiga save-games compatible?

Q: Is there a cheat-mode?

Q: When you  broadcast 'Help!  my Engines have  broken down!' or 'Help!  I  am
under attack!',  do you actually get any assistance,  or is  it just  a pirate
beacon?

@NODE Irritated "Mosquito bit my But..."

Most of the time, for the more experienced, combat  is tedious, and gets in
the way.  Usually when you are trying to get somewhere fast, you tend to be
dogged  by  clouds  of  Hawks,  Ospreys, and  Falcons.  This  is  downright
depressing and almost forces you to stop playing. What follows are my usual
tactic for nailing these suckers.


		     @{"   For Craft with no Turrets   " LINK NoTurret}

		     @{"For Craft equipped with Turrets" LINK Turret}
@ENDNODE

@NODE NoTurret "No Turrets!!!"

			      @{B}Got No Turrets!!@{uB}

	Activate icon F10 (switch names on).  Goto manual and get the enemy
ship on screen.  Pause the game with <Esc> and target  the ship by clicking
on it.  Switch on autopilot.  Now either release a missile or resume normal
time.  If no missile is released, engage  Autopilot.  The  autopilot should
now be attempting to align  your weapon vector with the target.  Proceed to
kill the enemy.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Turret

		            @{B}Joy! I've got Turrets!!@{uB}

You can make your craft act like a turret by switching the engines off.  This
makes targetting alot easier, but makes you a sitting duck.  Be careful.

	Do not disengage autopilot.  Switch to turret view and activate names
( icon F10 ).  Find him and shoot him lots.  The problem with  this method is
you may not release a missile after him, but finding, and shooting the target
is a hell of a lot easier.  Believe me.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Piracy "Please don't"



                              @{B}An Urgent Plea@{uB}

Dear Frontier users,

	Are you playing with an  illegal copy of  Frontier?  If so,  why?  I
mean, sure, you don't get the bugging copy protection  system, but you  miss
out  on  alot  more.  The  number of  times  I  have read  the  Manual,  the
Gazetteer,  and Stories of Life  on the Frontier  is  phenomenal.  They  all
contain information which is both crucial to gameplay, and very  interesting
also.

	Look -  the  price  of  Frontier  in  the   shops  has  dropped   to
approximately £15.  For that measly sum, you get original  virus-free disks,
a nice box, a map (veeeery useful, believe me), and three books.

@{B}Remember - the poor guy took FIVE YEARS to make this game.@{uB}

@ENDNODE

@NODE Missions "Military Missions"
@{B}Military Missions@{uB}

Military  missions (in  my  opinion) are  probably  the  most  rewarding  and
satisfying facets of Frontier.  Okay, they are boring at first, but when your
rank permits you to do dangerous  assassinations, espionage, etc. The  thrill
is unbelievable.  What  follows - separated into the  relevant sections - are
the tactics which I employ to perform these missions.

@NODE Launchrequest "Let's do Launch"
                           @{B}All Things Launchy@{uB}

There  is  not  alot which  can be said  concerning this  section.  To leave a
spacestation  you must  use this option - illegal  take-off  on a spacestation
is not possible, and  the same  goes for  spaceports  on a  planet  without  a
breathable atmosphere, as both work via an airlock system.

However, when you are docked on a breathable planet (ie. you land outside) you
can  cause bloody  mischief by  doing an  illegal  take-off.  This  option  is
particularly  useful when  lying in  wait for  the victim  of an assassination
contract. However, when you do commit an @{"Illegal Take-Off" LINK Illegaltakeoff}, the Police will be
all  over  your  ass  quicker  than  you  can  blink.  So the  target must  be
neutralized fast, so you can get out of there fast.

Remember - try not to commit any crimes in the territory of the government you
are  working for - ie. if you work for the Imperium, commit crimes in Interpol
territory  or in the Federation.  NOT the  Imperium.  This will make jobs less
forthcoming.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Started "Let's Get You Started"
		          @{B}Getting Started@{uB}

I assume by now you have chosen your starting position, and  actually started.
Now what?  Well, not much apart from about a week of solid @{" Trading " LINK Trading}.

Basically, in the beginning, it's all a matter of money.  First get the money,
then have the fun.

Once you have in your pocket a healthy seven-figure sum (don't feel daunted -
it  does not take  as long as it sounds) you can stop that messing around and
get down  to some  serious mercenary work.  The best thing to do, is to start
carrying civilian contracts.  The more  you successfully complete, the better
your  reputation.  The better your reputation, the better the jobs which come
your  way.  Once  your reputation is high, go to Military missions.  Stick to
one  allegiance, as the  Military of either side  get annoyed  when you start
working for the  other side.  And no, defecting does NOT help you at all with
work for the enemy.  Instead,  it makes them suspicious, and it takes AGES to
get promoted.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Police "Contacting the Police"
		@B}Dealing with the Local Cop-Shop@{uB}

You've gotta be real careful here.  If you attempt to bribe them, your fine
increases and 'Attempted Bribery' shows up in your Police Record.  If you
try to deny the allegation, your fine increases dramatically but no further
infringement of the Law crops up on your record.

As a rule of thumb, when attempting to bribe a cop, always go for the full
250 credits.  No matter what the crime, this is always cheaper than paying
up.  But, if the fine is relatively small (ie. less than 10,000 credits) and
you want as clean a record as possible, just cough up or reload.

Remember - if docked, pay up before midnight or before attempting to gain
Launch clearance or you get arrested.  Fines can be evaded by performing an
illegal take-off.

For more information regarding the Law, see the section on @{"Crime" LINK Crime}.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Crime "The Criminal Acts"
	                 @{B}Crime in Frontier@{uB}
Several Frontier-fans I know (me being one of them) enjoy 'collecting' crimes
- ie. they like  committing crimes just so that they can fill in their record
sheet  as full  as possible.  Because  this can  have a  deterent  effect  on
civilians asking for a job or looking for someone to hire, they tend to carry
out these deeds in one  particular  territory - ie.  Interpol, Federation, or
Imperium.  Try it - it sure is fun!

@NODE Jobs "Adverts for Jobs"
			     @{B}Job Adverts@{uB}

People are constantly having difficulties with hiring crew members.

@{B}Question:@{uB} Is there any way to get more crew quicker?

@{B}Answer  :@{uB} No. There is no  backdoor (that I know of), but I do have a
tip which may be of help for those with cash to spare.

Let's say  you start  with a Cobra MKIII.  You want to have a kick-ass Panther
Clipper with all the bells and whistles  attached.  So to get 12 crew members,
this is what you do.

1 - Buy a ship which needs maybe three crewmembers.
2 - Get the crew for it.
3 - Kit out the ship with the bare minimum.
4 - Hyperspace to a fairly decently populated system.
5 - Buy a slightly bigger ship.
6 - Perform steps 2 to 5 until you get your Panther Clipper.  Follow me?

Other than that, you'll have to wait a hell of a long time for the crew you
will need.

Warning : When  you fire crew members, rehiring crew will take slightly longer
with each crew member fired.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Package "Taking a small Package"
                       @{B}Taking a small Package@{uB}

Taking packages to places for civilians is hardly worth the trip really.  The
only times it is, is  if you are heading  there anyway,  and if  the item  in
question is  dodgy.  By dodgy  I mean military  battle plans and  the likes -
basically a mission for which the civilian is  willing to pay top dollar for.
Why?  Because A) - Lots of money for  bugger all. B) - Get a good reputation.
C) - Gain credibility with  the military force NOT being  spied upon.  But be
careful - do  not  undertake  such missions  if it  involves smuggling  plans
developed by the guys you work for.  I should not need to explain further.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Passengers "Taking Passengers"
		          @{B}Ferrying Passengers@{uB}

This all depends on whether you have the space and whether you can be 
bothered.  The same applies here as with taking packages - only take highly 
paid jobs - all the others are not worth it.

Passengers tend to want to be taken in single, small, or just plain group 
sizes :

	o Single      - well, one person ain't it.
	o Small Group - 3 to 5 persons.
	o Large Group - 7 people.

Remember :

	Each person will require an individual cabin.  One cabin takes up 5
	tonnes.

	If  after a  month the  passenger group  has still  not  reached  their
	destination,  they will  go mad , demand  to be  taken to  the  nearest
	star-port, and spread hateful rumours about you - hence your reputation
	goes down.

	When Ejecting from your ship, all passengers  are left behind to die in
	the cold wastes of deep space (and your crew).
@ENDNODE

@NODE Charities "Donating to Charities"
			       @{B}Charities@{uB}

These  adverts serve  no purpose  other than  disposing of  useless cash, and
boosting  your  commander's  reputation.  As a  result of  handing over MAJOR
donations, penalties  acquired from  late or  badly done missions are quickly
recovered.  But remember - this only really works with large donations.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Goods "Smuggling Run"
		          @{B}Trading Illegally@{uB}

You'd better  watch out here.  Trading here is a criminal activity, and can be
punishable with a fine of 2500 credits.  Although not alot, it does show up on
your record sheet, and  detracts from your reputation (I think).  To avoid the
@{"Police" LINK Police} traps  is very difficult,  unless you  are a regular  customer at  that
particular station.  Basically,  try  to  avoid  shopkeepers with any  blue in
their features (earrings, shades, clothes, skin, etc.) and  you just might get
away with it.  That's all I can give you I'm afraid.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Dumping "Unlawful Dumping"






It is  illegal to  jettison any  items from  the ship's  hold anywhere  in the
Galaxy.

You can get away with it though by dumping  at least 2AU away from the nearest
populated planet or starbase.

Dumping cargo whilst hovering over one's opponent is exceptionally damaging to
the opponent's health.  Good way of getting rid of radioactives.

It is illegal to  disobey the  direct command  of Traffic Control.  Persistant
violation will result in increasingly heavy fines.

You can't get away with this one.

You usually get this one slapped on you when you are attempting a manual
landing and you go to the wrong pad - ie. bay 3 instead of 6, and when you
take off illegally when attempting an assassination.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Murder "Piracy and Murder"






It is illegal to commit acts of piracy upon another  vessel.  The  destruction
of another vessel by your ship or your ship's weapons is punishable by a 10000
credit fine.

You can  get away  with this when at least 0.5AU from any populated planets or
starbase - I am  not sure though  if self-defence is  counted also  under this
heading.
@ENDNODE

@NODE IllegalMining "Illegal Mining"






Setting up  an MB4 Mining Rig upon a populated or protected planet is illegal.
Expect Police intervention, hot lazer death and a heavy fine.

I know that  this type of  mining is a bit of a bugger,  but it  is  pointless
attempting it in a populated  SYSTEM never mind  a populated PLANET.  You only
get minerals and water this way.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Violation "Permit Violation"






It is  illegal to enter  a prohibited system without the required permit. Such
a permit may be acquired  only by doing  business with a  member of the public
which involves that system (not assassinations).

Refer to the Manual and the section on @{"Questions and Answers" LINK Questions} for more info.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Discharge "Unlawful Discharge of Weapon"






It is illegal  to discharge any  form of weapons, whether energetic, missiles,
or mines, within an area  which includes a  high  population (ie.Orbital City,
Spaceport, etc.).

If you do this, expect lots of police ships to smear themselves around you.
This is depressing, annoying, and quite amusing.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Bribery "Attempted Bribery"






See also @{"Contacting Local Police" LINK Police}.



Bribery is a serious  crime in  the eyes of  the  Law - although  occasionally
successful.

In my opinion - a worthwhile pursuit.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Illegaltakeoff "Launching without Clearance"






See also @{"Launch Request" LINK Launchrequest}.



This is illegal and punishable by heavy fines - although the cops usually skip 
that part and straight to the death penalty.  Well, they try anyway.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Smuggling "Smuggling Illegal Goods"






It is a criminal offense to attempt to import goods into a system which
regards the goods in question as illegal.

I discovered that this includes shipyard upgrades - once I stopped off at
Van Maanens star - a religious commune, and requires a permit - to drop off
a passenger, and they destroyed my Hyperspace Cloud Analyser, and fined me
twice - for smuggling illegal items, and piracy and murder.

It does not matter what you were there for, they bust you anyway.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Illegaltrade "Trading in Illegal Goods"






It is illegal to attempt to trade illegal goods upon the station bulletin
board in any manner whatsoever.

You do realise don't you, that they set police traps in the form of bogus
dealers?

See also the section on @{"Goods bought and Sold" LINK Goods} for more information.

@NODE Mutha "That's one big Mutha"
                     @{B}How do you Kill a Large Target?@{uB}

That all depends.  If  the object of  your anger happens  to be a  Long  Range
Cruiser, or  a Lynx Bulk Carrier,  all you need to have is time on your hands.
Either of them will  not attempt to fight  back or move out of the way - a bit
pointless really.

However, if you want  to nail something like a  Panther or a Python, life is a
lot trickier.  If  you only have a  1MW Beam laser  or less, forget it.  These
suckers tend  to be crawling with  shields so anything smaller than a 4MW Beam
laser won't do diddly.

If your ship isn't  packing anything which  will take it  out in a  couple  of
zaps, you  have to be careful.  Firstly, you have to avoid being rammed by the
sucker.  Secondly, you've  got to evade it's laser.  And thirdly, they tend to
have an Energy Bomb on board - so if you're in a small ship, watch out!

The tactic I use in these situations is to head AWAY from the enemy until I am
approximately  six kilometres  from him.  Then I  turn round and  whack on the
autopilot, which  now has time  to centre the  weapon target.  I  repeat  this
trick several times, slowly whittling down his defences.

Basically,  play chicken with the sucker - Imperial Couriers just seem to love
this for some reason, so watch out when you meet one.

You should use this with anything bigger than an Imp Courier.

If none of the above suits you,  get yourself  a  Large Plasma Accelerator and
a kick-ass Panther.

@NODE Scooping "What a Scoop!"


@{B}Please refer to the following subsections :@{uB}

	@{"Cargo Scooping" LINK CargoScoop}

@ENDNODE

@NODE CargoScoop "What is the Point?"
		     @{B}The art of Cargo Scooping@{uB}

In my holy opinion, this is worse than a waste of time. But just for you, here
goes :

o You must have a fuel scoop and a cargo scoop conversion (10t total).

o Find the cargo you want to scoop.

o Come to dead stop.

o Slowly approach it at about, oh, let's say 200km/h until you are close.

o Manouver the ship closer.

o Manouver so that the object passes beneath the ship into the scoop.

o What more can I say???
@ENDNODE

@NODE FuelScoop "Fuel Scooping"
		       @{B}The Art of Fuel Scooping@{uB}

Fuel Scooping is  really only  worth it  if you are skint, and if you are out
near the Frontier - ie. nowhere near  any populated  systems.  Fuel  Scooping
requires  that your  ship be  equipped with  a Fuel Scoop,  which weighs  six
tonnes.  Now,  not all ships  have a Fuel Scoop attachment.  Apparently,  the
ship  designers decided  that the  bigger the  ship the  more  likely  it  is
captured by the planet or sun you are trying to scoop.  I don't know.

To fuel scoop, do the following :

1   :	Once you've entered the system, target the autopilot for a nearby gas
	giant or sun.  The  smaller the target  the better, as  it means less
	gravity to contend with.

2   :	Wait for the autopilot to take you within the vicinity of the planet.

3   :	Set the Manual speed to approximately 130,???KMS, and aim the ship at
	about one centimetre (on screen! ;-D ) below the planet's horizon.

4   :	Put time acceleration at X4. Time will revert to normal when the fuel
	scoop starts working.

I have discovered that this tactic also works when scooping suns.

@NODE Repairs "Repairing Your Craft"
			     @{B}Do It Now!@{uB}







As the manual says, you should do a full overhaul every  year.  Leave  it too

leaving you with a greasy mess in your engine bay.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Trading
			@{B}Silly Trading Information@{uB}

What can I tell you that you haven't discovered for yourself already?  All you
need  is two systems that each  want something  from the other real bad and is
willing to pay lots.   And you  need  a  big  ship  to  get  any  real  profit
(ie. with a Panther Clipper you can make 2.5 million selling narcs on 1 trip).
@ENDNODE

@NODE Upgrades
			 @{B}Some Info on Upgrades@{uB}

Geez!   What more can  I say on upgrades that isn't in the manual?   Oh,  okay
then.

@{B}Armaments :@{uB}

In my opinion,  anything solid  which you  fling out  your ship  in  order  to
severely damage  your opponent is pointlessly excessive tonnage unless it is a
Navy  or  Nuclear Missile  (which you can't use on other targets - boooo!).  I
don't know about you,  but I  have NEVER used mines  or anything  less than an
LV111 Smart Missile.  I find them pointlessly dull and boring to use.

Pulse lasers?  Pardon?  What is the point? Geez!

@{B}Others :@{uB}

Do Not equip  your ship  with both ECM types.  Just get the Navy Grade ECM and
fix it regularly.  The space is better off used for fuel.

Do  not  bother with  a  cargo scoop  conversion - that is  4 tonnes of wasted
space.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Messenger
	          @{B}How to be a Military Messenger@{uB}

This  is  the basic military mercenary mission type.  All you  have to do,  is
deliver a package to a certain destination, but by a set date.

Basically, get yourself a fast(ish) ship equiped with the bare minimum to stay
alive,  and find two  adjacent  systems  which  regularly  send  messages  and
packages to each other.  This way, you may be able to take up to nine packages
at once for the one destination.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Assassin "Assassinations"
		             @{B}Assassinations@{uB}

You get a  really smug sense of satisfaction when you successfully pull off an
assassination - whether  private or  military.  The  satisfaction value really
intensifies  the  closer your target  is  to  Earth - it  is unbelievably  fun
whacking a senator and his Panther when they are just leaving London!

Down to business. Assassinations may come under a number of specific headings.
This depends  on the location type of your target, and whether or not  you are
bothered by a criminal  record and heavy fines.  By heavy fines,  I mean fines
which are sometimes twice  what you are being paid for the job.  The types and
methods are as follows :

			@{"The Sneaky Way" LINK Sneaky}
			@{"The  Nasty Way" LINK Nasty}
@ENDNODE

@NODE Sneaky "Sneaky and Safe"
			           @{B}Safeway@{uB}

This is undoubtedly  the safest method,  as you do not have to worry about the
police. Basically, you have to wait for the target to take off, and hyperspace
to their destination.   Now you must  analyze the cloud remnant and 'overtake'
him whilst he is in hyperspace.  You now must lie in wait until he 'pops out'.
Now you can kill him at your leisure.

Problems:
o Sometimes he  doesn't hyperspace and just ambles along to a base in the same
star system.

o He can  be devious and perform a mis-jump - to find out if he has done this,
there  will be no cloud for his ship at the destination near yours.  Besides -
he's probably as good as dead anyway.  But you gotta be sure anyhow.

o He might possibly outrun you and escape that way.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Nasty "Nasty and Dangerous"
                 @{B}The 'Hit_Him_with_a_big_Gun' Method.@{uB}

This is the best  and most dangerous way to go about it.  You must have a ship
sufficiently large  to carry at least a  20MW beam laser  (about  75t I think)
and  sufficient  armaments  and  shields  to  remain  alive.  Basically,  this
involves waiting for the ship to actually take off, and frying him while he is
still vulnerable and unable to dodge.  Nasty, but sweet.

Problems:
o The cops will be hot on your rear real quick.

o Fines can amount to over 10600 Credits.

o You have to be rich to repair damages and set yourself up initially.

o You have to be rich full stop.

o You get a major thrill out of it.  (big problem eh?)
@ENDNODE

@NODE Spy "Nosey Parker"
			  @{B}Being a Military Spy@{uB}

This is the point where your commander's life turns really fragile.  The first
time the Military give you a  'Photography Mission'  they equip  your  current
ship with a set of  Military Cameras,  which can be activated on the dashboard
next to your energy bomb.  The good  thing about  these cameras  is that  A) -
they take up no tonnage.  B) - Your dashboard looks more dashing.

Now,  in my opinion,  photography missions are a bit of a bugger.  You see, to
get really good quality pics,  you have to  get your  ship  within  about  ten
kilometres from the target,  and then take the picture.  Meanwhile,  it  seems
that every enemy ship within 50 light years has decided to have a go at giving
you serious G.B.H. at no extra cost.  And you  also have  to make  it back  to
base by a certain date.

So.  What ship?  Well,  something that can take some battering and yet be back
home  in  time.  Currently,  I am using  an Imperial Courier  with an upgraded
engine to do these missions, and I seem to be doing well enough.

@{B}The way I do it :@{uB}

1  Enter system.
2  Autopilot to planet in question.
3  Attempt to sneak up to the base by hiding over the horizon.
4  Start moseying in there.
5  Don't attempt to kill any ships until you are within 30 km of the target.
6  Within 30 km ?  Hit that thar energy bomb NOW, if necessary.
7  Now try to  keep your actual speed  to around 2000 km/h - too much more and
   you will not be able to pull up in time,  and Mr Ground  will come to  meet
   you.
8  You have to  be within 6 km of the  target to gain excellent quality snaps,
   otherwise they will just be good.
9  Done it?  Now leave A.S.A.P.!

@ENDNODE

@NODE Nuke "World War XX"
			@{B}Let's Nuke that sucker!!@{uB}

Fun.  Funfunfunfun.  Oh JOY!!!  <---(This is what you are probably  thinking)

Am I right?

My Frontier character  was promoted to  Baron in the Imperial Navy on the 31st
of December 3219.   I received my first orders to Destroy a target on that day
also.  Man, was that fun!

Anyway,  I have reached approximately the 20th such mission, and have polished
my tactics off to  a  tee.  To do these  missions,  I fly a Cobra MKIII with a
Class 3 Military Drive and 30 tonnes of fuel,  a 1MW Beam laser,  and anything
else I can cramm on. (Actually, here's an update : I currently fly an Eagle
Long Range Fighter with a Class 4 Hyperdrive, a 4 Meg Beam, you name it...)

I have another saved character (for amusement only) who has a  Viper,  a small
Plasma Accelerator, 150 shields, etc. 2000 tonnes cargo space!! I can overtake
assassins!!!

My tactics :

1  Accept the mission.
2  Get there, and target the planet in question.
3  Activate the autopilot and accelerate time to maximum.
4  When you arrive,your actual speed will most likely be in excess of 100 kms,
   so go  to  manual and set  your speed to around 4000 km/h, aim your ship at
   the planet horizon, and accelerate time by 100.
5  Done?  Now save.
6  Go to normal time,  and scan around  the planet looking  for a little white
   dot on the surface. Fly to the other side if necessary in accelerated time.
7  Save again, and fly to the target within 600km.
8  Release the missile,  and watch that  pretty big bang.   Fly in as close as
   you want  before  release - you will  not  be  injured by the blast.  Shame
   really.

P.S.- If you target the missile as it flies and use the Radar Mapper, it tells
      you sometimes that it has a Hyperspace Cloud Analyser - why? Is the base
      gonna try to run? (did you know that a nuclear missile can go 200 ly  in
      one jump!!??!!)


@ENDNODE

@NODE Bored "Feelin' Bored?"
		 @{B}Spicing the Game Play a little bit.....@{uB}

So,  you've played Frontier  for what seems an age now,  and you  are  finally
starting  to get  a  little  bored  and  irritated by  little repetitions  and
suchlike.  But not to worry.  What follows is a list of my favourite things to
do when I am in such a quandary :

o Switch the Amiga into NTSC mode (refer to Workbench Manual) upon boot-up  to
force Frontier to have panavision graphics and actually play alot faster too.


o Target random Hyperspace remnants, and wait at the other end for whatever it
is coming through.


o Try to mis-jump into one of  those wierd,  miscoloured nebulaes on  the  the
system map.  If you succeed, tell me on #amiga and tell me what its like.


o Go sightseeing - visit all the places in the Gazetteer.


o Go for a wander into a disputed system.


o Do some manual landings!


o Use an ASCII binary editor (like NEWZap or Zap etc.) to edit select names to
something else - ie. I changed Abraham Lincoln and Li Qing Jao in orbit around
Earth to  Laga Hale and  Babylon 5 respectively.  It  feels great  docking  at
Babylon 5!!!


o Hunt for the Mirage (again, pllleeeaaaassee tell me if you find it!)
o This would make an excellent @{" GIFT " Link Gift} for me!
o I know the thing exists! Guaranteed!


o Go  boldly forth to where no man has gone boldly before ... and die a greasy
death.


o Use the Short Wormhole technique to go to the Galaxy's centre or edge.


o Play a nice game of Syndicate - if you have this game, do the following :

	Use your persuadatron to get ALOT of people.
	Self-destruct ONE of your agents!
	The carnage is unbelievable!!!


o Watch Babylon 5, Star Trek, and the X-Files consecutively.


o Shoot yourself and see what happens - write in and tell me.


o Get yourself a panther


o Get yourself a Panther Clipper,equip her with everything used to survive and
an  escape capsule.  Now  leave the space station,  and stop the  Panther just
inside the bay doors.   Leave engines on.   Eject.   You have effectively left
the station plugged up until someone with a large gun (you) clears it away!


o Do a slingshot orbit - (refer to manual)


o Do some fuel scooping.


o Sightseeing

  You can fly through all the domes on planets without a breathable
  atmosphere and land between the buildings. If you do this for the
  transparent domes at Ross 154 you will find in one dome administration
  buildings of Vega Line, Sirius Corporation and other trading houses and in
  the second dome the usual combination of concrete blocks and green patches
  in between with scattered brick houses. It is definitely fun to fly
  between the buildings and look at your surroundings. Agriculture domes are
  a bit boring, because they contain nothing more than lots of green balls
  at ground level.
  Domes that are not tranparent, can be entered too but contain absolutely
  nothing. It is interesting, that they are no obstacle for you though. At
  least they are good for some very strange graphical effects if you land in
  one of these domes and use your outside view to look at your surroundings.

   In every major city with more than the space port and a little industry you
  can find little churches with working clocks. The cities are structured as
  large blocks of ugly concrete buildings and patches of green between them
  with scattered brick houses and every now and then a little church. Try to
  rough land in the vicinity of such a church and watch the clock on the
  church steeple. Use time acceleration for better effect. If you are close
  enough you can even read the roman numbers on the clock face. The buildings
  give you an interesting impression of the size of your ship. A Cobra MK III
  looks huge compared with this tiny little church. And have you ever seen a
  huge space ship standing in the graveyard behind a church? It looks
  definitely strange.


o Dumping Radioactives

  One way to get rid of the radioactive waste from military drives is to
  dump it into space right out of your cargo bay. If you are in a system
  where a strong police force is watching, this can get you in trouble even
  if you dump directly after your jump into the system. In such systems you
  should simply sell your waste or (if radioactives are illegal) find a
  reliable merchant on the black market who takes it back.

  You can have loads of fun if you try a few highly illegal dumping
  places. A space port is a very nice place to dump your waste on. Some
  people prefer to dump their radioactives into the still open landing bay
  of an underground spaceport. You can even fling your waste into a long
  range cruiser that waits outside of some space stations. Of course you can
  do the same with mines for the thrill of finally seeing a mine hit
  something!

  There seem to exist systems where you can get real money for your
  radioactives. Look out for systems in the state of civil war. Sometimes
  you can sell your radioactives there on the black market.


o Crash Avoidance

  Assume you have to perform a mission on some planet, reached it and find
  out that you are too fast to be able to decelerate in time to avoid a
  crash landing. What can you do? The correct way is to watch the crash,
  reload a previously saved game and try again. The Frontier way is to use
  time acceleration to avoid the crash. Simply switch to maximum time
  acceleration just before the crash. You will make a big jump through the
  planet and be safe at some distance at the other side.

  This is not really a bug but more or less a consequence of the
  implementation of time acceleration. Collisions are detected if your ship
  collides with an object at a given time frame of the simulation. When you
  accelerate time these time frames are farther apart and so are your
  positions in space if you are moving. If your position at one time frame
  is above a planet and at the next time frame on the other side of the
  planet Frontier will not detect the collision that should have happened in
  between.


o Charity

  If you give money to charity, you will get a better reputation and people
  will trust you more. This means that you can get 10% more money for
  deliveries, get all or part of the money in advance and more people will
  want to work for you (?). Your reputation will also grow if you succeed
  with passenger transports without receiving too much damage to your ship.
  Therefore giving away your money is not really necessary if your
  reputation is not too bad for passengers to accept you carrying them.


o Negotiations With The Police

  If you have been caught selling or buying illegal goods or having them on
  board, the police will fine you. If the officer is not corrupt, you can
  always lower your fine to the original amount if you claim you "haven't
  done it".


o Certain Missile Hit

  Switch to maximum time acceleration after firing the missile. Your missile
  will hit even if you use a nuclear missile and/or have 900 km distance to
  your target.

	Equations for Free Fall

   With velocity v [m/s], acceleration a [m/s^2], distance d [m] and time
   t [s] we get:

      v = a t = sqrt(2 a d);    d = 1/2 a t^2;    t = v/a = sqrt(2 d/a) (1)

@NODE naviquations

	Navigation Equations

   For the distance d travelled with initial acceleration a_1 and final
   deceleration a_2 the values of interest for the journey are the maximum
   velocity at the turning point (where we change from acceleration to
   deceleration) v_u, the distance d_2 of the turning point from the target
   and the time t_d that is needed for travelling the distance d. We assume
   that forces other than those produced by our own engines can be neglected
   and that we start and reach the target with zero velocity. Furthermore we
   assume that the engines are used all the time at full power. If the main
   engine is used for acceleration and deceleration the equations are very
   simple:

	    v_u = sqrt(a d);     t_d = 2 sqrt(d/a);     d_2 = d/2       (2)

   This fastest mode of flight is used to accelerate up to the turning point
   velocity at the distance d_2, turn the ship and decelerate until the
   target is reached.

   If the autopilot is used instead, it will use the main engine for
   acceleration and the secondary thrusters (retro thrusters) for
   deceleration. In this case we get the equations:

		   v_u = sqrt( 2 d (a_1 a_2)/(a_1 + a_2) )

		   t_d = sqrt( 2 d (a_1 + a_2)/(a_1 a_2) )              (3)

			   d_2 = d a_1/(a_1 + a_2)

   The time t_d is always a lower bound for the really used time because the
   autopilot doesn't use the engines at full power all the time. I
   approximated the real time consumption of autopilot flight with a least
   mean square fit of data from 20 undisturbed flights with a Cobra MK III.
   Measuring the distance in astronomical units [AU] and the acceleration in
   units of earth gravitational acceleration [g], I got for the time [d]:

    t_dA = 1.212/86400 *
      sqrt( (2.992 * 10^11)/9.81 ( d (a_1 + a_2)/(a_1 a_2) ) ) - 0.001  (4)

	Hyperdrives and Jump Ranges

   A hyperdrive lets you travel its maximum range in seven days, which is 168
   hours. Travel time is linear with distance, so you will use one day to
   travel a seventh of your hyperdrive range. For a class n drive you will
   need n^2 tons of fuel to travel the maximum range, except for the class 8
   hyperdrive which actually is a class 9 drive and therefore uses 81 tons
   for a maximum range jump. The fuel consumption is linear with the
   distance, using only integer amounts of fuel, so you will need e.g.
   ceil(n^2/2) tons of fuel to travel half the maximum drive range. The only
   difference between the civil and military versions of a drive is the
   weight of the drive and the type of fuel used.

   The relation between jump cost c [t], jump time t [h], ship mass m [t] and
   jump distance d [lj] can be expressed a little more exact to give you a
   few numbers to crunch. Here the equations:

	    c = ceil( d * m / 200),    t = 168/200 * d * m / h^2        (5)

   If you set the time to the maximum 168h in the second equation you can
   calculate the maximum range of the drive of a given class in a given ship.
   If you do this for the class 8 drive in a Panther or Boa you get
   inconsistencies. From the ships table you can see that the class 8
   drive behaves like a class 9 drive in the Panther and like a class 7.79
   drive in the Boa. I hope this indicates a mistake in the table. The
   maximum ranges for the Lynx Bulk Carrier and the Long Range Cruiser are
   calculated as if the class 8 drive were actually class 9 drive. I don't
   know whether these ships can carry hyperdrives at all.

@NODE wormtheory
	Wormhole Theory

   The following seems to be invalid for updated versions of the game.

   A ship can jump very large distances due to a modulo effect in the
   hyperspace continuum with a base of W_sect = 81.62 sector lengths
   (655.36 lj). One can use this behavior to find jump paths that are much
   shorter in time and fuel consumption than the straight distance. This also
   allows you to use a smaller hyperdrive and leaves more room for fuel and
   cargo. The optimal jump points for a journey between two systems with one
   intermediate stop are found on the intersections of circles around the two
   endpoints of the journey. On such a circle lie the systems that can be
   reached from the center of the circle with a minimum amount of fuel and
   time. A system at the intersection of such circles can be reached easily
   from the centers of both circles, making it an ideal intermediate jump
   point. The circles have multiples of the wormhole distance (655.36 lj) as
   radii. To make the calculations simple we assume at first, that the
   "thickness" of a sector can be neglected and that two jumps with equal
   distance shall be made, resulting in circles with equal radius. The
   coordinates of the ideal intermediate jump points can now be found on a
   line that perpendicular bisects the segment between the two endpoints of
   your journey, at the points of intersection of the circles around the
   endpoints.

   For two star systems at the coordinates (x, y) and (u, v) we define:


		       a = (u - x);       b = (v - y)                 (6)


   We choose a jump distance of W_n = n x W_sect sectors. With this
   definitions we get as coordinates for the intermediate jump (p, q):

	     p = (x + u)/2 + b sqrt( W_n^2 / (a^2 + b^2) - 1/4 )
                                                                       (7)
	     q = (y + v)/2 - a sqrt( W_n^2 / (a^2 + b^2) - 1/4 )

   or
	     p = (x + u)/2 - b sqrt( W_n^2 / (a^2 + b^2) - 1/4 )
                                                                       (8)
	     q = (y + v)/2 + a sqrt( W_n^2 / (a^2 + b^2) - 1/4 )

   Now n has to be chosen such that the square root has a real solution (the
   jump radius is larger than the half distance between the systems) and we
   have to find a system near one of the intermediate jump points.  If such a
   system cannot be found, we simply increment n and try again with a
   wormhole distance of the next greater order.

   If you want to perform two jumps with different jump sizes the equations
   have essentially the same structure but get a bit more complicated. We
   define a and b as in (5) and choose the jump distances W_m = m x W_sect
   for the first jump and W_n = n x W_sect for the second jump. m and n must
   be chosen such that:

		 | m - sqrt(a^2 + b^2) / W_sect |  <=  n  <=            (9)
                   m + sqrt(a^2 + b^2) / W_sect

   This ensures, that there exists an intermediate jump point at all. With

	       alpha = (W_m^2 - W_n^2) / (2 (a^2 + b^2)) + 1/2          (10)

   we get for the coordinates of the intermediate jump point (p, q):

      p = (1-alpha) x + alpha u + b sqrt( W_m^2 / a^2 + b^2 - alpha^2 )
				                                        (11)
      q = (1-alpha) y + alpha v - a sqrt( W_m^2 / a^2 + b^2 - alpha^2 )

   or

      p = (1-alpha) x + alpha u - b sqrt( W_m^2 / a^2 + b^2 - alpha^2 )
                                                                        (12)
      q = (1-alpha) y + alpha v + a sqrt( W_m^2 / a^2 + b^2 - alpha^2 )

  Here comes the list of ranks in the German and the English version version
  together with the number of points you have to get to advance to a given

   Konteradmiral      Rear Admiral   Herzog          Duke         14,641
   Admiral            Admiral        Prinz           Prince       20,736

  The following table shows the correspondence between the mission type and
  the points you get for the successful completion of a mission:

			 _Mission_Type____|_Points_

			  delivery	     2
			  assassination     14
			  foto              16
			  bombing           18
			  `excellent' foto  20

   Different kinds of military missions are bound to your rank. In the
   federation you carry unimportant stuff until you get promoted to Sergeant;
   then the first secret messages may be carried by you. You will get your
   first military assassination mission as Sgt-Major. After your promotion to
   Major you will get additional reconnaissance missions and a Colonel may
   execute bombing missions. The empire handles equivalent ranks the same
   way. You seem to get no new type of mission when you advance further in
   rank although there are many rumors that you get new missions to destroy
   enemy ships at Commodore/Marquis level.

   The above does not hold, if you execute missions for more than one side. I
   made the mistake of working for the empire after I advanced to Colonel and
   had gotten my first few bombing missions.
   I advanced to Squire in the empire and went back to the federation. Now I
   had the problem, that I got no more bombing missions but had to stay with
   the usual reconnaissance missions. I eventually got bombing missions again,
   but working for the empire surely stopped my federal career for a while.

   The safest way to advance in the federation and the empire at the same
   time seems to be the famous `rank swing': Advance one rank in the
   federation, work for the empire and advance one rank there, return to the
   federation and so on until you are Admiral/Prince and ELITE and bored to
   death.

   Your rank is not the only prerequisite you need to get a certain type of
   mission. You have to own all the possible medals for earlier missions
   first. You get medals for:

   1. the first delivery of an important item like gravitic detonators,
   2. the first delivery of secret communication,
   3. the first successful assassination,
   4. the first successful reconnaissance mission,
   5. the first reconnaissance mission with resulting excellent film and
   6. the first successful bombing mission.

   A strange side effect is, that you must not perform all reconnaissance
   missions perfectly, because if you do, you will not get your fourth medal!

   The complete list of medals for the German and the English version of the
   game looks as follows:

  And here your combat rating with more magic numbers. They seem to denote
  the number of ships you have destroyed multiplied by 256. In other words,
  you get 256 points for each destroyed ship regardless of its type.

         _German_______________|_English_________|  _Points _|Kills_

          Harmlos                Harmless               0        0

          Durchschnittlich       Average            8,192       32
          U"berdurchschnittlich  Above Average     16,384       64

          ELITE                  ELITE          1,536,000    6,000


   For every 256 destroyed ships you will get a message like: "right on
   commander". This is an indication of your advances between the ranks. From
   the table you can see, that you should get Dangerous between the third and
   the fourth message of this kind. You advance to Deadly between the 11th
   and 12th message. You should become ELITE after the 23rd message.
