          Flight Simulator Scenery Disk #9 (chicago, st.louis, Cinn.)

Typed in by ROM CHIP of ORACLE. Edited by Parasite.
 
     
     This is the latest scenery disks from SUBLOGIC..you must have either
JET SIMULATOR or Flight Simulator II to use these scery disks, they do not
boot by themselves..(in case you're pretty stupid and tried it already!)

 Anyways, for those who dont know how to utilize the scenery disk, heres
a little help...if your using JET sim., just use the LOAD SCENERY DISK
option at the main menu and enter the north and east coordinates listed
below to go to that area of the scenery disk....using Flight Simulator II
is a little bit harder, but you can find the pull down menu area where it
says scenery disk...well..thats when you insert scenery disk into the drive
and then enter that function and follow the north-east coordinates again
just like JET...although FS2 asks for ALTITUDE (which are listed below for
your convience.)

    SCENERY disk #9 includes the areas covered by the CHICAGO, ST. Louis,
and Cincinnati, OHIO NOAA sectional charts. Each section covers an area of
more than 100,000 square miles and is usally named for the prominent city
within that area. DISK #9 includes more detailed cities and airports than
ever before. Many airports now have a visual approach slope indicatior VASI.
  Improved runways feature threshold markings, fixed distance markers and 
touchdown zone markers with dimensions and placements to FAA specifications.
 The city of CHICAGO now has many more buildings, landmarks and visual cues.
ST.Louis is also packed with scenery and borders a HIGHly realistic rendition
of the MISSISSIPPI river that runs all the way from wisconsin to tennessee.
 The Cincinnati sectional area features a cluster of more than thirty 
mountains stretching from tennessee to pennsylvania. With over 150 detailed
airports and numerous VOR and NDB transmitters, this disk should keep you
flying for a long time. The following coordinates should provide the most
interesting sites.

  and that should do it...now you can fly around from chicago down to St.
louis and up and over to cincinnati...and if you have scenery disk #11..
then you can fly over to pittsburg and philidelphia and over the great
lakes and toronto CANADA and Niagra falls NY...then Scenery Disk #7 takes
you all the way down the EASTERN coast from WASHINGTON D.C. to the Florida
Keys....Also look for the WESTERN EUROPE and JAPAN/Tokyo scenery disk.
