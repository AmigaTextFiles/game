We have cheats aîd tips for...Thunderblade,Veôeran,After Burner,Exolon,
Flyiîg Shark,StarRay,Thrust,Rambo III,Sorcery+,Street Fighter,Daley 
Thompsons,Sentinel,Eliminator,


                          *Thunderblade*

Type CRASH when you're on the title screen. UNDO will then take you 
to the next level.

                            *Veôeran*

Hitting the HELP key will take you through to the next level in this 
second rate OP WOLF!

                          *Afterburner*

Don't worry, the AMIGA version of this game is just as bad! Performing 
360 degree rolls all the time will render you immune from just about 
everything. If that isn't enough, hit BACKSPACE to pause the game and 
type in AGES (SEGA spelt backwards). Use the < and > keys to change 
levels.

                            *Exolon*

Type 'ad astra' (in lower case) on the high score table to get some 
much needed infinite lives. 

                          *Flying Shark*     

When you score high enough to make the high score table, type HSC or 
KDJ (holding down the 5 key as you enter the last letter).
HSC gives infinite lives
KDJ gives invulnerability        

                            *Star Ray*

Type AL YANKOVIC to activate the cheat. F5 gives infinite shields, F6 
completes the current attack wave. 

                             *Thrust*

This isn't going to work with those cracked, compacted versions that 
are around - but if you boot the GEM desktop, open the THRUST icon and 
double click on CHEAT.PRG you can survive collisions. All you have to 
do is type 'cheat' during the game.

                           *Rambo III*

You'll need to score at least 5000, enough to make the high score 
table. After that type in RENEGADE. Press 1, 2 or 3 on the title 
screen to access the level of your choice.

                          * Sorcery+ *

Remember that some of the solid looking pillars can actually be 
flown through. 
The Green Monster is killed by the sharp axe.
The Ground Goblin with the strong sword.
The Flying Eye, Pig and Pumpkin are all destroyed using the ball 
and chain.
Cauldrons on the ground replenish energy, and vary from game to game. 
Sanctuary always replenishes energy.
Fleurs de Lys and Coats of Arms permenantly unlock doors bearing 
those symbols, and are not used up in the process.
Bottles and keys open the remaining doors but are consumed in doing 
so.

The objects required to liberate the corresponding sorcerers are-
     OBJECT                            SORCERER LOCATION
Sorceror's moon                           Stonehenge
Wand                                      Tunnel
Book                                      Outer Sanctum
Golden Chalice                            Wine Cellar
Goblet of Wine                            Wastelands 
Little Lyre                               Palace
Crown                                     Strongroom
Scroll                                    Dungeon

The book is the hardest item to get (near the waterfall) so have 
a go at retreiving this first. Once all the sorcerors are free, 
go to the sanctuary and sit on the remaining pillar to complete 
the game. (Note that in the Amstrad disk version of this game, 
once you'd freed all the sorcerors and taken your place in the 
sanctuary, a second level would be loaded. I'm not sure if this 
is the case with the ST version.)

                         *StreetFighter*

Nice graphics, but S L O W !Press HELP to access the next level.

               *Daley Thompsons Olympic Challenge*

The correct shoes to wear for optimum performance......
     Training            Training shoes
     100m                Running spikes
     Long Jump           Long spikes
     High Jump           Flat soles
     Hurdles             Short spikes
     Discus              Half spikes
     Pole Vault          Track shoes

If you have an autofire joystick, engage autofire before starting 
your Long Jump approach. When you reach the you automatically jump
at the perfect time.

                          *Sentinel*

                         *Eliminator*

A diificult cheat to activate....but helpful.
On the title screen press HELP and type in HANDEL to put you on
stage 9. Now when playing, avoid the water to the right and crash 
into the oncoming alien. On the next life, shoot the alien and fall 
into the water on the right just before reaching the first ramp. On
your next life, shoot the green alien, jump over the ramp and stay 
in the right-hand lane. If all has gone well, you should be shot by
a bubble like alien, and you should have-finally-activated the 
infinite lives mode.
