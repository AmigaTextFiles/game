TAKE OFF AND LANDING 

First of all after boot up pick the Training in the USA option because you
don't want to worry about nasty things like FLAK and SAMs.Turn on both
engines (keys 1 & 2) and engage the rotors (key 3).When the rotor speed
reaches about 80% hit the collective up fast key (*) until the readout
shows about 75-80%.At this time the chopper should leave the ground (the
collective key alters the pitch of the rotors to produce vertical momentum).
You will notice that the airspeed still reads zero so push forward
gently on the stick till you start to pick up speed then slowly reduce the
collective until you attain level flight.You can use the collective to
maintain a climb or dive without a loss or gain of speed or you can use
the control stick to produce a climb or dive with a corresponding loss or
gain of speed.At speeds of less than 50 knots you can use the rotate left
and right keys to produce a change of direction without a loss or gain in
height.A helicopter is inherently unstable and as such requires constant
adjustments to keep height and course constant.Climb to 1000 feet and 
practice turning and climbing and diving using the collective to keep a
constant speed.To go into a hover (very important when landing) gently
pull the nose up while reducing or increasing the collective until you
are no longer climbing or diving. Slowly toggle the collective still
further until your speed begins to drop towards zero,then let your speed
drop past zero until you are flying backwards.Slowly increasing the
collective will bring you to a hover. I'll just have a quick read of the
manual then I will tell you how to land.
Before landing line the chopper up with your base (the large white square
on the map) and dive to 200 feet and reduce forward speed to below 100
knots.Close to within 1.5 miles of the base then slowly adjust the collective
until you can maintain a shallow descent,and a slow reduction in speed.
When height is below 100 feet,pull the nose up slightly while still
maintaining a descent.Don't worry about landing directly on the chopper
pad for the moment,anywhere within about half a mile is fine because you
can make short hops to the base.Once within about 100-200 yards of the pad
and on the ground you can shut down both engines (keys 1 & 2),and
disengage the rotors (key 3). 

COMBAT
The first thing you need to know in combat is the capabilities of your
weapons, it is no good firing a Hellfire at an enemy chopper for
instance.Just above the CRT display in the centre of the screen is a small
box which will inform you when the on board computer detects a possible
target.Pressing the fire button once will show the target in the CRT
display.Friendly targets will show green while enemy targets will
show red.Pressing Backspace will toggle through all possible targets
and the zero key on the keypad will clear the CRT.When a target is
displayed in the CRT you will notice in the top left hand corner a set of
figures, this is the range to target. The figure in the top right corner is
the magnification of the camera scanning the target and is as far as 
I know,mainly for decoration. When you have a target displayed on your CRT,
you will notice a small box will have appeared in the upper cockpit window.
This is known as your TADS (Target acquisition & designation system).TADS
will track the target as long as it stays in your field of view. The
weapons of your chopper are listed as follows with their ranges and uses:
The 30mm Chain Gun.This weapon is situated directly under the nose of
the chopper.It is not aimed manually, and will automatically track any
target found by your TADS.It has a maximum range of 1.5 miles but its
effective range is about half that. The further from your line of flight
it tracks the less accurate it becomes.It is a good all round weapon
and can be used with varying degrees of success against most targets.
AGM-114A Hellfire Anti-Tank Missile. The Hellfire can only be used against
'hard' targets (tanks and bunkers),it is totally ineffective against men
choppers and AA guns.It has a maximum range of 6 miles and range does not
effect accuracy as it has to be guided by laser,which means that the chopper
has to stay exposed until the missile finds its target.
2.75" Folding Fin Aerial Rocket.The FFAR rockets are an old weapon,dating
back some 30 years and as such they have no guidance system.They fire
straight ahead so need to be aimed by the pilot pointing the nose of the
chopper straight at the enemy.The warhead of the FFAR is High Explosive
so it is good against all soft skinned targets,but only marginally effective
against armour.It has a range of perhaps 4 miles.Range does effect
accuracy.

AIM-9L Sidewinder Air to Air Missile. The sidewinder is only effective
against air targets.It has a range of about 14 miles and uses an infra red
homing system so is of the 'fire and forget' type.
Defensive Systems : 
Chaff (small strips of metal used to jam radar) and your Radar jammer (key
9) are effective against Radar Homing missiles,while flares and the IR
jammer (key 0) are effective against heat seeking missiles.If these fail to
shake a missile,it is possible to outfly them as both types of missile
have a HUGE turning circle.The only counter measure against FLAK is to
avoid it or to shoot up the guns.When flying against enemy choppers YOU 
have the advantage as their guns are fixed to fire forward and because of
their size and weight you are very much more maneuverable.One other
thing I've just remembered,when you've ECMed a missile,don't just assume
that it won't hit you, as they continue to fly in the direction they
were going when ECMed.
