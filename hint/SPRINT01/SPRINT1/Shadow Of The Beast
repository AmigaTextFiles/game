                            SHADOW OF THE BEAST
THE GAME.        
MANY YEARS AGO,ON A MOONLESS NIGHT,A SMALL CHILD WAS STOLEN AWAY FROM
ITS UNSUSPECTING PARENTS. ITS MYSTERIOUS ABDUCTORS CARRIED IT FAR
ACROSS THE LAND TO THE MIGHTY TEMPLE NECROPOLIS. THERE THE CHILD WAS
ACCEPTED BY THE MAGES OF DARKNESS, WARRIOR PRIESTS OF THE BEAST LORD.
DEEP BELOW THE TEMPLE THE CHILD WAS ESCORTED, PASSING THROUGH A
LABYRINTH OF ROOMS AND PASSAGES TO THE CHAMBERS OF CREATION. THERE
THE EVIL MAGES WORKED THEIR DARK ARTS CREATING STRANGE CREATURES,
PLANTS AND TRAPS TO GUARD THE BEAST`S STRONGHOLD. FOR THE CHILD THEY
HAD A SPECIAL PURPOSE, BUT FIRST CAME YEARS OF PREPARATION. SECRET
POTIONS CONCOCTED FROM THE BLOOD OF RARE CREATURES SLOWLY TRANSFORMED
HIS APPEARANCE - TURNING HIM FROM A HUMAN INTO A STRANGE CREATURE OF
INCREDIBLE POWER, AGILITY AND STRENGTH. DEEP HYPNOSIS CAUSED HIM TO
ERASE MEMORIES OF HIS PAST LIFE COMPLETELY AND BECAME THE WARRIOR
MESSENGER OF THE BEAST. MANY YEARS PAST IN HIS SERVICE TO THE TEMPLE
AS HE GREW TO MATURITY. THEN ONE DAY HE DISCOVERED AN AWFUL SECRET -
THE HORRIBLE TRUTH ABOUT HIS PAST... A TRUTH THAT NOW LEADS HIM ON A
TRAIL OF TOTAL AND BLOODY REVENGE AGAINST HIS MASTERS. YOU WERE THAT
CHILD. NOW THE TIME HAS COME TO ENTER THE `SHADOW OF THE BEAST`.

IN SEARCH OF THE BEAST.
IN THE GROUNDS OF NECROPOLIS ALL  WAS SILENT AND STILL.THE MOON, LOW
AND LARGE ON THE HORIZON,THREW LONG DARK SHADOWS INTO THE CORNERS AND
A COOL BLUE LIGHT ACROSS THE STONY GROUND, DISGUISING THE BLOOD-RED
STAINS ON THE SACRIFICIAL STONE. NOT A SINGLE CREATURE STIRRED TO
DISRUPT THE TRANQUILLITY,NOT A LEAF MOVED ON THE NEARBY TREES. THERE
WAS NOT A TRACE OF LIFE IN THAT SINISTER PLACE BUT FOR A SINGLE POINT
OF LIGHT GLINTING AGAINST THE AGE-WORN FACE OF A STATUE. UP THERE IN
THE HUGE ARMS OF THE DEITY`S IMAGE SAT A LONE CREATURE. IN ITS
POWERFUL HAND IT CLUTCHED A `GLOBE OF SEEING` WHICH IT MOVED SLOWLY
FROM SIDE TO SIDE EXAMINING ITS REFLECTED FEATURES.AS IT DID SO IT
RECALLED THE EVENTS OF THAT DAY: THE FRIGHTENED HUMANS BEING HERDED
INTO THE CENTRAL COURTYARD; THE PATHETIC PLEAS FOR HELP AS THEY WERE
DRAGGED ONE BY ONE TO THE SACRIFICIAL STONE; THE FINAL AIRRENDING
SCREAMS AS THE KNIFE CAME DOWN IN ONE SWIFT ARC AND THE LIFE BLOOD
RAN. AND THEN A TIRED RESIGNED FACE BEING PUSHED TOWARDS THE STONE, A
FACE THAT SEEMED OF SOME IMPORTANCE TO HIM. YET HOW COULD THAT BE
WHEN THE LIVES OF THESE PEOPLE MEANT NOTHING TO HIM?. AND, AS THE
GLEAMING BLADE STRUCK HOME,HE RECOGNIZED THE AGONIZED FACE OF HIS
FATHER AND SUDDENLY THE PAINFUL MEMORIES OF ALL HE HAD BEEN CAME
FLOODING BACK TO HIM. HIS MASTERS HAD DONE THIS TO HIM. THEY HAD BEEN
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THAT HE WAS, AND THE LOSS OF ALL HE MIGHT HAVE
BEEN.WELL NOW THEY WOULD PAY. NOW THE WARRIOR WOULD STOP KILLING FOR
HIS MASTERS AND BEGIN TO EXACT HIS REVENGE. STANDING, HE LIFTED THE
GLOBE HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND, CLENCHING IN HIS CLAWED HAND, CRUSHED
IT TO A HUNDRED TINY SHARDS. NOW THE WARRIOR`S HEAD LIFTED TOWARDS
THE HEAVENS.HE SEARCHED THE SKY FOR THE DARK HULLS OF THE SHIPS
WHENCE HIS MASTERS HAD COME AND LET OUT A ROARING HOWL THAT SPOKE HIS
DEFIANCE. NOTHING WOULD STOP HIM NOW. HE WOULD CRUSH THEM AS HE HAD
CRUSHED THEIR GLOBE, AND HE WOULD NEVER STOP UNTIL THE BLOOD OF ALL
OF THEM AND THEIR CREATIONS SOAKED INTO THE EARTH FLAME RED EYES
STARED OUT ACROSS THE SUN-SCORCHED PLAIN, SCANNING THE DISTANT
TREELINE. THE WARRIOR WAS ALLOWING HIMSELF A BRIEF MOMENT TO ENJOY
THE STILLNESS - A RESPITE BEFORE HE ONCE AGAIN SET MIND AND BODY
AGAINST THE UNNATURAL CREATURES HIS FORMER MASTERS HAD SPAWNED.
DRAWING IN BREATH SHARPLY, HE FLEXED HIS HARDENED MUSCLES, BECAME
AWARE OF THE BLOOD RUSHING THROUGH HIS ARTERIES,THE DOUBLE-HEARTS
POUNDING FURIOUSLY IN HIS CHEST. THE WARRIOR KNEW THAT HIS POWER AND
SPEED WERE ALL THAT ENSURED HIS SURVIVAL. THE DAY THAT HE BECAME WEAK
THE HOUR THAT HE BECAME SLOW ,WOULD BE HIS LAST. SETTING OFF AT A RUN
HE HEADED TOWARDS THE TREES, STIRRING UP A TRAIL OF GRAY DUST BEHIND
HIM. TO HAVE REMAINED ON THE PLAIN WHILE THE SUN WAS HIGH WOULD HAVE
BEEN FATAL,BUT IN THE SHADE OF THE TREES MOST LIKELY CONCEALED A
DARKER FATE. AS THE WARRIOR REACHED THE FIRST GROWTHS HIS INSTINCTS
TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS UNLIKELY TO BE ALONE FOR LONG. HIS EYES DARTED
FROM SIDE TO SIDE WATCHING FOR THE TINIEST MOVEMENT THAT WOULD BETRAY
A PREDATOR. WHEN IT CAME IT DID SO WITH SPEED, RUSHING AT HIM FULL ON
ITS BLACK WINGS CRASHING THROUGH THE FOLIAGE,AND FROM ITS
BLOOD-FILLED MOUTH CAME A PIERCING SCREAM AS IT SIGHTED ITS KILL. THE
 WARRIOR HAD BARELY ENOUGH TIME TO CROUCH AS THE CREATURE FLEW AT HIS
HEAD. TURNING SWIFTLY HE BROUGHT HIS BONE-COVERED FIST UP HARD INTO
THE CREATURE`S SOFT UNDERBELLY. NOW IT SCREAMED IN PAIN, SPINNING IN
MID-AIR AND CRASHING DOWN BETWEEN THE GNARLED ROOTS OF A TREE. BUT
THE WARRIOR IGNORED THE BODY. BEHIND HIM HAD COME ANOTHER SCREECH,
TOO CLOSE THIS TIME. AS HE TURNED AND DIVED FOR COVER ANOTHER WINGED
DEMON FLEW AT HIM, CLAWS EXTENDED FOR THE KILL. THE WARRIOR STRUCK
OUT AGAIN BUT THE CREATURE WAS TOO QUICK AND HE FELT ITS TALONS
TEARING INTO HIS ABDOMEN AS HE ROLLED AWAY INTO THE UNDERGROWTH. HE
LAY THERE PANTING, MOMENTARILY DAZED. HE COULD FEEL A WARM WETNESS
ACROSS HIS SIDE AND STOMACH, AND WITH IT A SHARPENING PAIN. BUT HE
CONCENTRATED ON IGNORING IT. THE WOUND WOULD CONGEAL SOON ENOUGH, AND
IF HE STAYED ANY LONGER HE WOULD LOSE FAR MORE THAN A LITTLE BLOOD.
HE STOOD SLOWLY,FIGHTING THE WAVES OF PAIN THAT PASSED THROUGH HIM,
FEELING HIS HEARTS POUNDING FASTER, BUT HE HAD TO BE MOVING. OTHER
CREATURES WOULD SMELL THE BLOOD SOON AND HE COULD NOT WARD OFF
ANOTHER ATTACK. AS HE STUMBLED BETWEEN THE TREES HE NOTICED SOMETHING
OUT OF PLACE AGAINST A DISTANT TRUNK. COMING CLOSER HE RELEASED THAT
IT WAS A DOORWAY, A BEAST-MAGE CONSTRUCTION, AND HURRIED ONWARDS.
HINKING ONLY OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD SOON BE TRAILING HIM, THE
WARRIOR TOOK A CHANCE AND DROPPED THROUGH INTO THE DARKNESS. HE WAS
JUST IN TIME. BEHIND HIM THERE WAS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM, FOLLOWED
BY A RESOUNDING CRASH AS ANOTHER WINGED CREATURE FAILED TO FOLLOW HIM
THROUGH THE OPENING. THE WARRIOR TOOK ONLY A MOMENT TO REFLECT THAT
ONCE MORE HE HAD BEATEN THE ODDS, BEFORE TAKING STOCK OF HIS
SITUATION. THERE WAS A COOL BREEZE COMING FROM SOMEWHERE BENEATH HIM,
AND,NOW THAT THE CREATURE HAD RETREATED, A MENACING SILENCE FELL, A
SILENCE PUNCTUATED ONLY BY THE SLOW DRIPPING OF WATER DEEPER WITHIN
THE CAVERN. AS THE WARRIORS EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE POOR LIGHT
HE MADE OUT A WORN STAIRWAY CURVING AWAY FROM HIM INTO THE DARKNESS.
SO,HIS SUSPICIONS WERE CONFIRMED. HE HAD STUMBLED UPON ANOTHER OF HIS
EX-MASTERS OUTPOSTS. THEY WERE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT. COULD THIS BE
THE END OF HIS LONG JOURNEY? HAD HE FOUND THE STRONGHOLD AT LAST?
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT...
PADDING SLOWLY DOWN THE STAIRWAY, THE WARRIOR READIED HIMSELF FOR
WHATEVER ABOMINATIONS LAY IN WAIT AT THE BOTTOM. SOON THE STAIRWAY
STRAIGHTENED OUT AND THE WARRIOR FOUND HIMSELF ON A NARROW LEDGE. THE
PHOSPHERESCENCE FROM THE CAVERN WALLS WAS ENOUGH TO REVEAL THAT HE
WAS IN A HUGE CHAMBER THAT EXTENDED AWAY INTO PITCH DARKNESS. NOW THE
SILENCE BROKE INTO DISTANT SOUNDS OF ANGRY GROWLING. WHATEVER
INHABITED THIS PLACE HAD OBVIOUSLY PICKED UP HIS SCENT. THE LEDGE
THAT HE WAS ON APPEARED TO BE DESERTED SO HE ADVANCED SLOWLY. WITHOUT
WARNING THERE WAS A SIZZLING SOUND BEHIND HIM. INSTINCTIVELY THE
WARRIOR JUMPED AND FELT HIS FEET SINGE AS A WHITE HOT FIREBALL SHOT
BENEATH HIM TO EXPLODE VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE CAVERN WALL. SO, HIS
FORMER MASTERS WERE AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE, AND REALISED HIS INTENT.
HE WOULD HAVE TO BE TWICE AS ALERT NOW. THEY WOULD USE EVERY MEANS IN
THEIR POWER TO STOP HIM. AHEAD OF HIM NOW HE COULD MAKE OUT A ROUGH
WOODEN LADDER STAKED INTO THE SIDE OF THE LEDGE. CAT-LIKE HE SWUNG
HIMSELF ONTO IT AND BEGAN HIS DESCENT, DROPPING SILENTLY THE REST OF
THE WAY WHEN HE SAW ANOTHER LEDGE BENEATH HIM. NO SOONER HAD HIS FEET
HIT THE GROUND THAN A SCALED ABOMINATION RUSHED FORWARD, JAWS
GRINDING FEROCIOUSLY. THE WARRIOR TURNED CALMLY AND DISPATCHED IT
WITH A SINGLE BLOW. AND SO THE ORDEAL WENT ON AS HE WORKED HIS WAY
DEEPER INTO THE CAVERN. CREATURES THE LIKE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN
BESET HIM AT EVERY STEP, BUT EACH WAS DESTROYED WITH DETERMINATION AS
THE WARRIOR REMEMBERED HIS PROMISE TO HIMSELF TO CONTINUE UNTIL EVERY
LAST ONE IS DEAD. HE HAD JUST DROPPED ONTO ANOTHER LEDGE WHEN HE
CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF SOMETHING SHINING IN THE DISTANCE. MOVING CLOSER
HIS KEEN VISION MADE OUT A KEY SITTING ON A SHELF ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF A BROAD CHASM. HE STARTED TO MOVE SWIFTLY TOWARDS IT WHEN HE WAS
HALTED BY AN ALMIGHTY ROAR. SUDDENLY HE WAS CONFRONTED BY A HUGE
BEAST-LIKE GUARD. HIS OPPONENT TOOK A SHORT MOMENT TO SIZE HIM UP AND
THEN MADE A BELLOWING CHARGE, SWINGING HIS DOUBLE-HEADED BATTLE AXE
AT THE WARRIOR`S HEAD. WITHOUT LOSING A MOMENT THE WARRIOR
SIDESTEPPED THE BLOW AND SLAMMED HIS FIST INTO THE GUARDS THROAT.
THERE WAS A SICKENING CRUNCH AS THE NECK SNAPPED, AND THE WARRIOR
STEPPED BACK QUICKLY AS THE HUGE BODY TUMBLED FORWARD OVER THE LEDGE.
THERE WAS NO MOMENT FOR RECOVERY BEFORE ANOTHER HULKING FIGURE WAS
RUSHING HEADLONG AT HIM. BUT THIS TIME THE WARRIOR WAS READY AND HIS
FLYING KICK SENT THE GUARD PLUMMETING BACKWARD TO JOIN HIS FELLOW.
NOW A CLEAR WAY LAY AHEAD OF HIM TO THE KEY. HE SPRINTED ALONG THE
REMAINDER OF THE LEDGE AND JUST AS THE EDGE OF THE ABYSS MET HIM HE
LEAPT FORWARD,HANDS REACHING OUT TO GRASP THE EDGE OF THE SHELF. HE
MADE IT IN A SHOWER OF DIRT AND STONES, AND CAUGHT HIS BREATH AS HE
HUNG SWINGING ABOVE A SEEMINGLY BOTTOMLESS CHASM. HE COULD FEEL HIS
SWEATY HANDS BEGIN TO LOSE THEIR GRIP. IF HE LET GO NOW HE WOULD
ALMOST CERTAINLY DIE. IF HE MADE IT ONTO THE SHELF, WHO KNEW WHERE
THE KEY MIGHT LEAD HIM? NOW THE WARRIOR`S TRUE DESTINY WOULD BE
DECIDED...

THE WARRIOR`S OBJECTIVE:                                  
YOU MUST FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT REGIONS IN ORDER TO
REACH THE HEART OF THE ENEMY`S STRONGHOLD AND FACE YOUR ULTIMATE
ADVERSARY. ANY CREATURES YOU ENCOUNTER WILL INVARIABLY BE HOSTILE AND
WILL CAUSE DAMAGE WHEN THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH YOU. CONTACT CAN
BE AVOIDED BY PUNCHING OR KICKING CREATURES AWAY FROM YOU BEFORE THEY
GET TOO CLOSE,OR BY SHOOTING THEM IF YOU HAVE A WEAPON EACH TIME YOU
ARE DAMAGED YOUR HEART RATE WILL INCREASE.YOUR CURRENT HEART-RATE IS
SHOWN ON THE MONITOR IN THE TOP-LEFT CORNER OF THE SCREEN. IF YOUR
HEART-RATE GETS TOO HIGH YOUR HEARTS WILL BURST, RESULTING IN INSTANT
DEATH. DURING YOUR ATTACK ON THE STRONGHOLD YOU WILL FIND VARIOUS
ARTIFACTS WHICH CAN BE USED TO ASSIST YOU ON YOUR QUEST. SOME OF
THESE ITEMS, KEYS FOR INSTANCE,WILL BE COLLECTED FOR LATER USE WHEN
YOU MOVE OVER THEM. ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR POSSESSION WILL BE
SHOWN AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN. OTHER ITEMS, SUCH AS POTIONS, WILL
HAVE AN INSTANT EFFECT WHICH IS SHOWN ON THE SCREEN WHEN YOU MOVE
OVER THE ITEM.
THERE ARE ALSO WEAPONS THAT CAN BE COLLECTED AT CERTAIN POINTS IN THE
GAME. THESE ARE USED INSTEAD OF PUNCHING AND KICKING TO DESTROY YOUR
OPPONENTS.CERTAIN CREATURES CAN ONLY BE DESTROYED BY SPECIAL WEAPONS.
IT IS UP TO YOU TO DISCOVER THE BEST WAY TO USE THE ARTEFACTS YOU
FIND AND HOW TO TACKLE THE CREATURES YOU ENCOUNTER.

CONTROLLING THE WARRIOR.

USE THE JOYSTICK TO CONTROL THE WARRIOR`S MOVEMENTS:

                       JUMP/UP
                      (USE EXIT)

      MOVE LEFT                        MOVE RIGHT

                       CROUCH
                        DOWN

PRESS THE FIRE BUTTON TO `PUNCH` OR `KICK` (WHILE JUMPING). IF YOU
HAVE A WEAPON IN YOUR POSSESSION, PRESSING FIRE WILL FIRE THE WEAPON
RATHER THAN PUNCHING OR KICKING. MOVING THE JOYSTICK UP OR DOWN WILL
NORMALLY CAUSE THE WARRIOR TO JUMP OR CROUCH. IF,HOWEVER, YOU ARE
STANDING ON OR AGAINST A LADDER MOVING THE JOYSTICK UP OR DOWN WILL
CAUSE THE WARRIOR TO ASCEND OR DESCEND.
THERE ARE EXITS BETWEEN AREAS. IF AN EXIT IS FACING YOU, SIMPLY WALK
INTO IT TO USE IT. IF AN EXIT IS TO ONE SIDE OF YOU, STAND NEXT TO IT,
AND THEN PUSH THE JOYSTICK UP TO USE IT.
IT IS ALSO WISE TO WATCH YOUR STEP. THE WARRIOR CAN SURVIVE SHORT
FALLS, BUT STEPPING INTO A PIT OR OFF A HIGH LEDGE WILL PROVE FATAL.
PRESSING `P` AT ANY STAGE WILL PAUSE THE GAME. FIRE THE JOYSTICK TO
RESTART. PRESSING THE `ESCAPE` KEY WILL RESTART THE GAME FROM ANY POINT.

DO NOT HOPE FOR GOOD LUCK. YOUR SURVIVAL WILL DEPEND ON YOUR SKILL AND
INGENUITY ALONE.
