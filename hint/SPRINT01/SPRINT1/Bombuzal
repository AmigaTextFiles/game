                           LEATHERNECK
                           ===========

This cheat works for both the ST and Amiga.
Start the game and type 'CUTHBERTNECK', then press F3. This will 
give all players protection from enemy fire, but not from your 
team-mates' bullets. To return to normal press F3 once again.

                          ENDURO RACER
                          ============

When you first begin to play Enduro Racer, after the countdown 
type the word CHEAT in on the keyboard. Having typed that in, 
pressing one of the following keys will result in a specific 
effect.

     T - Gives you an extra 10 seconds to complete the race
     S - Advances you one checkpoint
     F - Gives you turbo speed (210 kmh)

                             NEBULUS
                             =======

activate the cheat mode, awarding you infinite Pogos. Not only 
that, but you can also press keys F1 to F8 to access any of the 
towers. 

                              OIDS
                              ====

only) will give you infinite lives.

20 dim a%(770):cheat=varptr(a%(1))
30 def seg=0
40 gload "a:start.prg",cheat
50 poke cheat+&h260,&h357c:poke cheat+&h262,&h302c

                             OUTRUN
                             ======

following codes:

B - Gives extended play

T - Adds ten seconds to your time

                        RETURN TO GENESIS
                        =================

On the title screen type WASP ASM then press F5 for invincibility.


                        SDI  (Activision)
                        =================

Cheat modes seem to be getting harder to activate every day, with 
this one being one of the weirdest to date. On the playable high 
score table, shoot down all the swirling pods with your lasers, 
allowing you to enter your name. Type in ALERIC and the cheat 
mode is up and running, allowing you to select any level you want 
with the function keys.                                      

                         ROLLING THUNDER
                         ===============

Type JIMBBBY for infinite energy - type 1 to change level.


                          SUPER HANG-ON
                          =============

On the high-score table enter 207L, which should then be replaced 
by a row of dots (indicating that there's cheating afoot).
When the next screen appears, press CTRL, ALT, Z and T to get the 
cheat mode running, allowing you to change the strength of the 
centrifugal force (what a strange cheat!). Zero will allow you to 
whip around the course at top speed without crashing at all, 
while the higher numbers will more than likely send you off the 
course at every bend.

                            STARQUAKE
                            =========

To help you get about a bit, here's a complete list of teleport 
codes:

     FLIED       ROKEA
     CHING       HINDI
     DAVRO       SOCHI
     SOLUN       NICHA
     TABET       BORNO
     LUANG       CWORE
     TSOIN       KWANG
     KALED       ADKEA          

                             STARRAY
                             =======

Unfortunately the cheat mode isn't as straightforward as the game 
play. Here's the step by step guide to getting an invincible 
ship. Make sure your mouse is plugged in, but don't use it to 
move the highlight.
Access the OPTIONS SCREEN (ie: press the SPACE BAR).
Move down to the VIEW GAME SCREEN option.
Push the joystick LEFT and press FIRE. The GAME SCREEN should 
appear.
Centre the joystick and press FIRE again. The OPTIONS SCREEN 
should reappear.
Move down to the SOUND ON option.
Push the joystick to the RIGHT and press FIRE. If SOUND ON 
changes to SOUND OFF, start again from scratch.
Return to the VIEW GAME SCREEN option.
Push the joystick RIGHT and while holding it in this direction, 
hold down the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.
Press the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.
The OPTIONS SCREEN should change to CHEAT MODE.
Return to RESUME GAME and continue play with a shield that never 
depletes.
If this doesn't work, try again from a new game.

                          KARATE KID 2
                          ============

                           STARGLIDER
                           ==========

Slow down to minimum speed and select F for fixed gunsights. 
Pause the game and type JS ARG S followed by RETURN, then type JS 
ARG S and hit RETURN again. Pressing M stops all enemies in their 
tracks, while P awards an extra missile. N gives an extra 5000 
points to your score.

                          STARGLIDER II
                          =============

Press BACKSPACE (DELETE) to pause and type WERE ON A MISSION FROM
GOD and press 1 on the main keyboard. Then press K to get ALL the
weapons and if you run out, just press K again.

                             MENACE
                             ======

Type XR31 TURBO NUTTER BASTARD and hit keys 1-6 to select a level.
Then press RETURN for extra weapons. (Not sure about this one, 
works for Amiga, but haven't tried it on the ST yet)

                      HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER
                      ====================

If you are surrounded by the enemy ships then simply save the game.
When you restore that game all the ships have disappeared.

                         STREET FIGHTER
                         ==============

To progress to the next level of this abominable licensed beat'em 
up, type STREET CHEAT on the title screen and press the HELP key.
Easy when you know how, eh?

                              VIRUS
                              =====

Start the game and hold down ENTER on the keypad. Whilst keeping 
it depressed, press P then O. Now when you thrust a third bar 
will appear below your fuel and altitude bars. Each of the 
following keys now have different effects...

L - Gives you an extra missile and hoverplane
D - Turns demo on/off
F - Restores your fuel to full
B - Disables graphics (pretty useless)
N - Turns cheat mode off
C - Disables graphics update (just makes a mess) 


                           SORCERY +
                           =========

Type GAS MASK WHEELER WANTS CHEAT (include spaces) and the 
sorceror becomes invisible.

                          SPY Vs SPY
                          ==========

Wait by the door to the airport and booby trap all doors. When 
the other spy has got all the stuff, he'll get killed trying to 
get to the exit - just go through the door which he tried to get 
through. Pick up the stuff by searching the furniture and escape. 
If he does get through, just beat the shit out of him and head 
for the exit.

                          STAR GOOSE
                          ==========

Hit all the function keys from F1 through to F10 and you've got 
unlimited protection in this cute shoot em up.

                            ELITE
                            =====

manual, type SARA. Now type in the correct word when prompted and 
begin play. Press the  *  key to access the hacker screen, where 
bytes and variables can be changed to suit.

                             ARKANOID
                             ========

Yeh, it's ancient I know, but its a cheat ain't it? When the game 
loads (before the title screen changes) type DEATHSTAR (holding 
down that SHIFT key). Now pressing S jumps you forward a screen 
when you want.                        
When you lose all your lives and are at the high score table, 
type in PAJ in capital letters to return to the screen where you 
lost your last life.

                           HADES NEBULA
                           ============

Nice game, but bloody difficult. Type MONITOR. on the high score 
table (include the full stop) and you'll find that when you 
restart the game you have 5 ships and this number will remain 
constant.

                            OVERLANDER
                            ==========

Just a few tips- When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, 
and always choose the highest paid mission. Buy fuel carefully - 
only enough for that level, after level 1 you MUST buy a 
leanburner. Try to stay in the middle of the road and travel 
fast, travelling slowly only burns more fuel. Fire bombs are more 
useful than smart bombs when you learn how to use them.
Bulletproofing is necessary after level 2. When travelling 
through the barriers the best speed is 90-120mph.

                             AIRBALL
                             =======

The spellbook is in the room with the candle. You have to pick up 
and remove the blocks to get it. Take the spellbook back to the 
start screen and drop it in the top left corner and follow the 
instructions to get the ingredients to complete the game. 

                          CAPTAIN BLOOD
                          =============

When you encounter a particularly friendly alien, ask it the 
following question using the alien icons: CODE GG1. The alien 
will then give you the co-ordinates of another alien called GG. 
Go to the specified planet and you can then ask GG for the co- 
ordinates of all the other aliens around by asking CODE 
INFORMATION HELP. If you're met with blind ignorance then put in 
the name of an alien after the HELP.
