"F-15 is a faithful simulation of the high-tech F-15 all weather air 
superiority and ground attack fighter, including all major flight, 
weapons and information  systems. F-15 puts you in the cockpit of the 
world's most advanced fighter airplane to plan your strategy and make 
the critical split second decisions which spell the difference between 
success or failure! Good luck."
        Well gee, I think I must have loaded the wrong program, cos 
I've seen spreadsheets more exciting than this crap. Microprose is 
capable of a hell of a lot more than this! Anyway, here's an abridged 
version of the manual (it sure as hell isn't worth typing the whole 
thing in!).

AUTHENTICATION:
