                         ARKANOID - HOW TO CHEAT

Taken from an ST SEWER SOFTWARE docs disk. Edited by Parasite.

   Boot and run the game as usual,pick a start screen and begin the game.Next
hit the space bar to pause the game. While the game is paused,type in
dsimagic without spaces and without hitting return.
   Unpause the game by hitting the spacebar again. A Yellow power Capsule
with "DS" on it will fall down the center for you to catch. Once you get
it you can call up any type capsule you want at any time in the game!!
Just press the first letter of the type of Capsule you want and it will
roll down the center for you to catch. Examples:

   S low.
   C atch.
   E xpand.
   D isruption. 
   L aser.
   B reak. 
   P addle.

   Suggested strategy is to catch several P addle Capsules to give you
extra lives. In this mode its possible to have several normally incompatible
attributes active at the same time. i.e. you can Disrupt the ball into
three balls then call up the Lasers,too. There are a few more
features of this Cheat mode. Hitting the F key will teleport you to the
Final Screen and a confrontation with DOH {Dominion Over Hour} Make sure you
have plenty of extra lives left first!! The other feature is the
ability to skip any screen you don't wish to play, merely hitting the ENTER
Key on the numeric keypad . You wont receive any points for the screens you
skip so you might prefer to just use a break Capsule. It WILL give you a
score for all the bricks on the screen.
