There are eight levels to this game.  

Leave your finger on the fire button at all times.

When your picking up the power chips for the drone, keep the reflecting
lasers.  

When you have the drone, use it the way it was designed for, ramming and
absorbing bullets. 

LEVEL 1:
Stay back, be patient and pick up upgrades for your drone.  Its best to
have the relecting lasers.  Watch for the creatures that try and sneak up
behind you and the big robots.  The red monster can be dealt with by
shoving your drone up its stomach and keep firing.  In fighting the
rotating guns, get in, blow the blue gun and get out as fast as possible or
try to go up as you approach, shoot at the blue gun emplacement. Hit it and
it will start a chain reaction.

LEVEL 2:
Use reflected lasers to handle the tadpoles.  Go reverse clockwise around
the first worm and hide at the bottom left corner of the mother.  Then jump
to a position just above the eye and shoot away.  Move up to avoid the
third worm.

LEVEL 3:
Go low, hugging the dirt and be patient and lay back.  Go forward at the
last minute to the next gap and then immediately move forward again.  Bring
the drone to the back of your ship.
