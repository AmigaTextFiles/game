Weapons Descriptions 
USE THE SPACE BAR TO HIGHLIGHT MISSIONS OPTIONS 
1. M61-A1 Vulcan Internal Gun - Also called a cannon, we call the M61 a gun
because of the information displayed on the HUDs where its status will
appear. Since the M61 is an internal weapon, your F-16 Falcon already
starts with 5000 rounds of ammo. The gun is an all purpose weapon (Air-to
-Air or Air-to-Ground). 
2. AIM-9J Sidewinder - The AIM-9J is a heat-seeking missile used in Air-to-
Air combat, with an average useful range of 5 miles. It needs a strong
heat source to track, and should be aimed directly at the Mig's rear
quarters for it to be effective. 
3. AIM-9L All Aspect Sidewinder - The AIM-9L is similar to the AIM-9J in
that it is a heat-seeking missile. However it's called an "all aspect"
missile because it contains filters that block out other heat sources
(such as flares). The effective range is 5 miles. 
4. AGM-65B Maverick Missiles - The Maverick is an optically guided
missile used for Air-to-Ground bombing. It must be fired from below 20,000
feet. It has a TV camera in the
nose, when it is selected and your radar is on, you can view the ground/
targets in your Radar CRT (center bottom of cockpit). 
5. Mk 84 2000lb Low Drag Bomb - The Mark 84 is a general purpose bomb. It is used
for any Air-to-Ground bombing
when you want to make maximum impact. @ 6. Durandal Anti-Runway Bomb - This
bomb is especially made to destroy runways. It propels its self
underneath the runway, and then blows. This causes more repair time, and more
damage. 
7. ALQ-131 ECM Pod - The ALQ-131 pod is a radar scrambler for Air-to-Ground
Missions. However, do not use it unless your going to be flying low,
the ALQ-131 pod tells every Mig in the world that your coming. 

Missions 
Milk Run - Destroy the practice buildings east of your runway.
Effective Weapons: Maverick, and Mark 84 
Black Bandit - Destroy one MiG. Effective Weapons: AIM-9J AIM-9L
Vulcan internal gun. Mig loiters north of your base. 
Rattlesnake Roundup - Destroy three SAM sights (you will find these when in
enemy territory, they look like a
mountain with two missile launchers coming out of it). Effective weapons: Mark
84 Maverick Vulcan internal gun.
Double Trouble - Destroy two MiG's. Same effective weapons as Black
Bandit. 

Dragon's Tail - Destroy the bridge in the middle left quadrant. Same
effective weapons as Milk Run. 
Dragon's Jaw - Destroy the bridge in the upper left quadrant. Note: the
only effective weapon is the Mark 84 Hornet's Nest - Destroy the central
airport in the upper left quadrant. Note: the only effective weapon is
the Durandal Anti-runway bomb. Bear's Den - Destroy the Communication Center
north of Dragon's Jaw. Same effective weapons as Milk Run. 
Venus Flytrap - Destroy all the SAM sights in the lower left quadrant.
Hint there are only two. Effective weapons, same as Rattlesnake Round-up. 
Strike Palace - Destroy the enemies headquarters in the left hand center
quadrant. Destroy both buildings!
Same effective weapons as Milk Run. @ Double Dragon - Complete both Dragon's
Tail and Dragon's Jaw in the same 
mission! Use the effective weapons described in those missions. 
Grand Slam - Destroy four MiG's. Same effective weapons as Black Bandit.

FLYING AND USING YOUR WEAPONS 
TAKE OFF PROCEDURE: (key to press is in parentheses []) 
START ENGINES - [+] (JFS Light goes on) RELEASE WHEEL BRAKES - [W] 

INCREASE POWER TO 100% - [+] 
GENTLY PULL BACK ON STICK AT 150 KNOTS (AIRSPEED INDICATOR IS ON THE
LEFT OF YOUR HUD) (The NWS light will switch to DISC when airborne) 
RETRACT GEAR - [G] 
You can change the cockpit views with keys 3 4 5 6 8. 
3 front 
4 left 
5 rear 
6 right 
8 Auto (switches to view MIG, keep it on Auto when your Radar is off,
you can be traced to your radar emissions, then turn it off in combat by
selecting one of the other view
angles) 
Note : At higher ranks (normal engine) when taking off with heavy
loads of bombs and fuel, use the after burner for more speed - [/]
LANDING PROCEDURE: 
Runway 9 is equipped for ILS (instrument landing system) USE it
whenever possible. It's the horizontal runway at your base, approach it from
the west. Turn on your ILS - [F7], at a 90 degree heading towards runway 9.
You will then see "radio" messages from the tower, as well as the Glide slope
deviation scale on your HUD.
When the lines intersect to form a perfect cross, you are on the right
approach. Use your Angle of Attack indicator and indexer. The indexer is the 3
lights on the left side of your
HUD, a down arrow head, a circle and an up arrow head. When the circle is
light you are on a perfect descent angle. The up arrow means too high and slow,
down too low and fast. The
indicator is the scale on the right of your CRT radar. At upper ranks it is 
imperative that the indicator read between 8 and 13 for a safe landing.
(Dropping airspeed increases your AOA) 

Use your airbrakes [B] and Flaps [F] to slow your plane, throttle should be
at about 68%. Lower gear at approx. 4,000 feet. NWS RDY (ready) Light goes on.
As soon as you touch down, apply
Airbrakes , Flaps and Wheel brakes and reduce throttle to 60%. At this point
you can press ESC and select "Mission Completed" from the option screen. 

USING THE WEAPONS 
At Captain rank and higher you select your own weapons. Use the cursor keys
to move from the items, + and - keys to equip or de-equip that item. You
can't always get what you want though, the Sarge'll tell ya'. 

THE GUN: 
   The target designator is a square that wraps around the target when it's on
screen. Through the square, you will
see a line, this is the LCOS, there is an indicator on the Stores control
panel showing when it's active. The Black line is the computers guess of the
enemy's heading, the white line
is his contrail or engine vapour. ALWAYS aim your weapons and plane at the
black line, AHEAD of the target. 
The large circle is the Aiming reticle, this shows where your rounds will land,
when you fire the gun. To
hit the enemy wait for the IN RNG (in range) indicator on your HUD (within
two miles), keep an eye on the Target distance scale on the left bottom of
the HUD, as it moves lower on the scale the closer you are to the
target. When you are within 2 miles, line the Aiming reticle on the LCOS
line directly in front of the target. Squeeze the trigger (space bar or
joystick button) a few times and "Splash" that bogey! Practice at
1st Lieutenant until you get the hang of it. You can hit the P key to pause and
refer to your docs at any
time. Hitting the Pause/Break key may lock your computer, so don't get
confused. 
AIR TO GROUND STRAFING: 
Tap Backspace to select the M61 A1 gun, confirm that it's in A to G mode by
looking at the Stores Control
Panel, the top line should read SRF 999 GUN, the 999 is a rounds count, if you
have less you've already done a little shooting. 
Set your Airspeed to 30 to 40 and your altitude should be about 2,000
feet. Line up the target with the designator (large circle) and 'pickle' the
trigger. In other words, tap it
once to lock the designator on target, if you lock on to the wrong place tap
the X key to clear the lock and re- center the target and pickle again.

Once locked on you don't have to continue a dive! The Falcon is a
remarkable plane and can adjust it's Yaw and Pitch so that the nose is
pointed up or down or left and right and it will continue to fly straight,
up or down! To do this hold down the shift key and push forward on the
stick, the nose will go down, but the plane will fly straight. The
Velocity Vector ( a small circle with a vertical line on it's top) will
indicate your true heading, even though the center point on the HUD
will point at the target, your V vector will indicate level flight.
To re-align the plane so that it points in the same direction it's
flying, tap the <F9> key. 
OK, so you're lined up and locked on to target. Your HUD Target Discrete 
(left bottom of HUD) switches from an ARM indication to LCK it's locked, so 
squeeze the trigger, an X will mark where your bullets hit. 
If you want to ignore the Lock on ranging system, pump your trigger in short
bursts instead of holding it
down in one long burst. The AIM9 SIDEWINDERS: 
   
Use the procedure for tracking and closing on your target as with the
cannon. Select the sidewinders, with the ENTER key. If you have a
combination of AIM9Js and AIM9Ls, switch to the ones you want with ENTER
(note: Joystick button B can switch
between weapons, but to switch between A to A or A to G you must use
BACKSPACE and ENTER keys). Watch your HUD target discrete, as you close, the
IN RNG will light up on the right bottom of the HUD, just under the
Target Distance indicators. Keep an eye on the right bottom of the HUD, the
weapons Discrete. When it switches
from ARM to LOCK, a flashing diamond also appears in the target designator,
fire the missile. 
When fighting multiple bogeys it becomes necessary to switch the
Designator between targets. Use the T key to switch between bogeys and
watch your ass, they like to play carrot and stick. 

THE MAVERICK MISSILE: 
Use the same procedure for locking on as with the strafing run. It's a bit 
easier to lock with the maverick since it has a TV camera in the nose. 
Switch the COMED to radar mode, select the Maverick and activate Radar. You
will now be able the see the ground in the COMED screen. 
Fly straight and level to the target and line it up in the COMED, right
between the two lines. "Pickle" the trigger when in range. You will then get a
lock indication. Fire away! You
don't have to fly directly at the target anymore, just in it's general
direction. As long as you see it so
does the Maverick. Watch your COMED and see the target crumble, if you
aimed right, that is! 
NOTE: WHEN CARRYING BOMBS, FUEL AND PODS AT UPPER RANKS, YOU CANNOT FLY
UPSIDE DOWN UNLESS YOU JETTISON CENTER STORES FIRST. THIS IS KNOWN AS A CAT-3
CONFIGURATION. 
MK 84 AND DURANDAL BOMBS: Practice on the Practice buildings! 
DIVE BOMBING: 
Select the MK84 bombs. Fly at the target at an airspeed of of 45 and an
altitude of 19.5. Keep the aiming
reticle right on top of the target. As you close the bombsight will begin
to move into view from the bottom of the HUD, once you see it, "pickle" the
trigger(tap it once). Adjust the angle of attack to keep the target
designator on top of the building, in other words, DIVE, but do it gently.
When the Bomb site is at the base of the building, tap your trigger to
release a pair of Mk84s. This will NOT MAKE a sound, the only indication you
have of a release is the word REL will replace ARM on your HUD's weapon
Discrete (lower left). Pull back on the stick and get the hell out of
there if this is a combat mission at higher rank. Select a rear view to see
if you were successful, an X marks the spot of impact. In combat never go
back to see if you were successful,let intelligence find out for you when you
land safely. 
NOTE: Use Mavericks against SAMs and buildings whenever possible, but you
must use MK84s against the Cantelever bridge in Dragon's Jaw. When bombing
runways follow this procedure with the Durandal, or use 
THE FLING BOMBING TECHNIQUE: 
AKA "POP-UP BOMBING" 
MK84 OR DURANDAL 
ALTITUDE SHOULD BE BETWEEN 2,000 AND 10,000 FEET. 
   
Maneuver so that the aiming reticle is directly CENTERED on the target.
This usually requires a shallow dive. Pickle the trigger, the target
designator (small black square) will appear in the reticle. The LOCK
discrete will appear in the designator @ Make sure that the designator is
perfectly aligned with the target, if not, clear with the X key and re-lock.
If properly locked on, fly straight and level to the target. The release Queu
and displayed impact line will
appear when in range. The Queu is an X at the top of the screen, the impact
line flows from it to the bottom of the HUD to the bombsight. To stay on
course, you must keep the Displayed
impact line intersecting the center point of the HUD and the reticle
(circle). 
As you approach the target, the Queu will move downward, towards the
reticle. Once the target disappears below the HUD pull back on the stick
 and start a shallow climb of about
110 degrees (flight path ladder between 1 and 2). When the release
Queu passes through the reticle (circle) hit the trigger to release
the bombs. Apply power and go into a 40 degree climb, until you have
cleared the impact area. BLACK BOX

You need at least 384K w/DOS 3.X to have the use of the Black box flight 
recorder. At any time inside the plane or
during the awards screen you can invoke the Box by pressing Control-B 
The top left grid is "top looking down". Top right is "Ground level
facing north". Bottom left is "Ground level facing east". 
Your Flight path is Cyan, enemies are white. 
All controls are invoked using the cursor keys and the enter key. 
The box records for up to 10 minutes, use it to evaluate your performance.
