Here at last! The game for the super heroes amongst you....
The fantastic arcade in which you must reluctantly leave the beautiful
Gwendoline behind and go and fight the monstrous Sfax.
Sfax is a mutant sorcerer from the Red Planet who has cast an evil spell
over your ravishing companion, who is now dying a slow and cruel death.
You have no choice but to go beyond the portals of space and time in order
to find this evil sorcerer, the physical embodiment of Sfax, & destroy him! 
Wait no more. Take charge of your super vessel....
