			CHESSMASTER 2000

WHAT YOU SEE
There are two types of display available.  Menus, which include help 
screens, and chess boards. To switch between these screens, press the F1 
key or ESC key.

USING THE FEATURES
The Chessmaster 2000 has many powerful features, such as teaching, 
replaying games, and more.  Program features are activated by holding the 
Control Key (CTRL) down, and then typing another key.
NOTE: Do not use the Control Key when using the features in the EXTRAS 
menu, SOLVE MATE, MATE LEVEL, PRINT GAME.

CHOICES
In the upper left hand window of the screen is the CHOICES display.  Every 
feature is available through one of the CHOICES in this window.
By pressing a Control-Keyed Letter, from the CHOICES display, a menu will 
appear in the lower left hand window.
Press the appropriate Control-Keyed Letter for the lower left hand window 
to use the desired feature.

CURRENTLY
Some menu selections display specific information about the program in 
progress.
This information is displayed under the CURRENTLY window in the lower right 
hand corner.

WHITE-BLACK
As the game progresses, the upper right hand window displays all the piece 
movement information.  This is the "Move List."
Under each player's heading, the move list is displayed in the algebraic 
format: Square moved FROM - and square moved to (xx-xx).
If the dash is replaced with an asterisk (*), then the moving piece has 
just captured the piece occupying the square where it has landed.
If a plus sign (+) appears to the right of a square, then the piece which 
occupies that square has placed his opponent's king in check.
The player whose turn it is, is displayed at the bottom of this window.

TO MAKE A MOVE
The Chessmaster 2000 uses the standard algebraic notation method for piece 
movement.  Type the letter and number of the square you wish to move from, 
followed by the letter and number of the square you wish to move to.
(When typing in the letters for piece movement, do not use the Control Key 
as the Chessmaster 2000 will activate the menus.)
With the 2D display active you will see number displayed along the sides of 
the board and letters along the top and bottom.  Use these as a reference 
guide while making moves.

TAKING BACK MOVES
Press the Left Arrow Key, and the last move made by either side will be 
taken back.  This maybe repeated until you reach the beginning of the game.
NOTE: The left arrow key, on the 64/128 keyboard is located above the 
Control Key.

NEWCOMERS
EASY MODE ON (Control Key E), and a Play Level of 0 (Control Key D).

CASTLING
when legal, move your king to his destination square,  The rook will move 
into place automatically.

ENPASSANT
When legal, capture an opposing pawn after it moves out 2 squares on its 
first play, by moving ahead and diagonally behind it.  The Pawn will be 
captured "in passing."

PAWN PROMOTION
If you move pawn to the eighth rank, The Chessmaster 2000 will wait for you 
to type a letter indicating to which piece you want the pawn promoted.
To indicate the level of promotion, type the following: Q for Queen, Ro for 
Rook, B for Bishop and N for Knight.

CHANGING SIDES
You may change sides at any point in the game by pressing Return when it is 
your turn to move.  The Chessmaster 2000 will then make your move, and wait 
for you to make a move, since you are now effectively playing black.
(Pressing RETURN at any point in the play cycle will force The Chessmaster 
2000 tomake the next move.  Therefore, pressing return at the onset of the 
game creates a Chessmaster playing the white pieces scenario.)
