INTRODUCTION:

Once upon a time, there was a game called hack.  Hack was a pretty good game,
and a lot of people really enjoyed playing it.  Then a strange and wonderful
creature called "The Dev Team" got hold of it, and hack was never the same
again.  For starters, it suddenly got a name change, and was called nethack.
But the biggest change was in the game itself.  No longer was it a fun
afternoon show to watch in black and white on a nine inch set.  It suddenly
became a three dimensional color holovision show with dolby surround sound and
much, much more.  (Our thanks to the dev team for a job well done.)

The problem with this is that people started getting addicted to the action,
the adventure, their character getting killed over and over again...  In order
to prevent the untimely demise of characters whose rated lifespan was about
double the actual lifespan, a bunch of people came together and began giving
each other hints about how to dodge that nasty shopkeeper, and how to get rid
of that awful wizard, and this worked well... for a time.

There was still a problem with this, though, for once the suggestion was
given, unless carefully hoarded away, it was gone forever, and there were
always new people who hadn't heard the suggestions.  Thus, the nethack spoiler
file was created.

Within this file is a large collection of lore about the game of nethack.
Some of it may not be true, but we have made the best effort possible to
verify all of the information contained herein.  Much of it has been verified,
corrected, or added since the original posting of revision one on the net.

Also, we would like to request that any corrections, modifications,
suggestions, etc. be e-mailed directly to water@wheaton.UUCP and not posted to
the net.  We will attempt to verify any information sent us and then we will
both add it to the spoiler file (for the next release) and post an official
correction/addition to rec.games.hack.

Be warned:  If you use the knowledge contained herein, your game will never be
the same.  Your horizons will suddenly be expanded, but you may end up
thinking that the game is less than it once was.  That is the risk you must
take if you choose to read this file.

Good luck, and happy hacking!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVISION NUMBERS:

In order to keep a decent idea of how the spoiler file is progressing, we have
set up an official policy on how revision numbers will change.  Any minor
revisions/corrections/amplifications will advance the revision number by .01.
New sections added (such as this one), or complete re-writes of existing
sections will advance the revision number by .10.  Any complete re-write of
the entire file (just in case - it might actually happen) will advance the
revision number to the next integer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREDITS:

Well, this should actually be a VERY large list.  Among others, it should
include almost everyone who has posted any hints of value to the net within
about the last year (or even longer in some cases).  Some people who have made
contributions to the cause of these spoilers above and beyond the call of
duty, however, are listed here:

     Kenneth Arromdee
     Alan Edwards
     David Goldfarb
     Laurence Gordon
     Kate Gregory
     Dolf Grunbauer
     David Hairston
     Michael Heggen
     Greg Hudson

     Andrew Pearce
     Robert Potter
     Brajesh K. Singh
     C. G. J. Thompson, et.al
     David Throop
     Steve Warren

If any of the rest of you out there know you contributed something to the
cause, but don't see your name listed here - don't get us wrong.  It's not
that we're ungrateful!  We probably just nuked your name by mistake!

And, just for a bigger ego trip, let's list our own names once again.  The
compilers and editors of this file are:
    Alan Light (alight@wheaton.UUCP)
    Ken Roth (kroth@wheaton.UUCP)
    Paul Waterman (water@wheaton.UUCP)

Note:  All names are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and not by
order of importance of contribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING THE SPOILERS:

There's really not much to say on this subject, other than a few intuitive
pointers.  How you use the spoilers is simple:  You read them, and apply the
knowledge contained within to your game of nethack.  However, we do have one
major hint for getting at what you want within the file quickly.

You will probably notice that the section headings are all in caps (like
"INTRODUCTION"), and that they are folowed by a colon in the actual section
header.  This should make it very simple to get to whatever section you want
quickly.  Just load the file into your editor (or even use 'more' for that
matter), and use the search function (for instance, type "/INTRODUCTION:"
while in 'more' or 'vi') to look for the section header.  Since it's all in
caps and followed by a colon, you'll be able to filter out all the extraneous
references, and get straight to the section you want.  For instance, do you
have any idea how many times the word "armor" occurs before the "ARMOR:"
section?

And now, on to the spoilers themselves!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMON QUESTIONS:

Q: I was playing a character and he/she got polymorphed into a new human.  I
   was asked to give the character a different name, and now I can't get the
   character back.  What do I do?
A: Nethack allows you to have multiple characters with different names, and
   whenever nethack saves a character it always uses the character's name,
   regardless of whether that character used to have a different name.  In
   order to access a character of a particular name (or start one with a
   different name), the easiest thing is to give nethack a -u flag and your
   name.  For instance, type "nethack -u name" where "name" is your
   character's name ("Endiel" in my case - and I'll send you updates to the
   spoilers if you can figure out where it came from).

Q: I was playing nethack when I hit the '!' key by mistake.  Now I'm sitting
   at my prompt, and I don't know what's happened to my game.  What gives?
A: In nethack, the '!' key will create a shell for you.  What this does is
   allow you to quickly pop out of nethack in order to do stuff, without
   messing up your nethack game.  On most systems, you can exit the shell and
   get back to your nethack game by typing "exit."

Q: I've found a Hawaiian shirt lying around, and I've heard them mentioned in
   the spoilers.  What use are they?
A: Basically, Hawaiian shirts let you effectively drop your AC by several more
   points, as they can be worn under a suit of armor (the more pieces of
   armor, the better the possible AC).  When not enchanted, they don't do much
   good (and actually can do harm, as shopkeepers will try to cheat you if
   they see it).  But if it's enchanted and under a suit of armor or cloak
   (where the shopkeeper can't see it), it can be quite useful.

Q: I've made it to the first level of Hell (probably by falling through a trap
   in the castle level), but I can't find any down staircases?  How can I get
   down farther?
A: You'll find that if you're confused and read a scroll of teleportation
   you'll get teleported to a different level.  Cursed scrolls of
   teleportation and level teleporters also do this.  If you have teleport
   control (via a ring or intrinsic), you can use these to teleport down to
   about level fifty and then work your way up.

Q: I've been punished, and I can't stand lugging around this ball and chain.
   What can I do to get rid of it?
A: There are several ways to accomplish this.  In the meantime, though, unless
   you have a pretty good weapon, pick up the iron ball and wield it.  To get
   it off, try reading a scroll (or casting a spell) of remove curse.  Or, try
   feeding it to a rust monster, rock mole, or iron golem.  A nymph may steal
   it.  Or, you can polymorph into a rust monster, rock mole, or iron golem,
   and eat it yourself.  Finally, you can polymorph into a nymph and remove
   it.  Note that lock-picks and keys won't work to get it off.

Q: I've got the amulet, and I'm on my way up through the levels of Hell, but
   I'm stuck.  I'm in a relatively small area in the middle of the level, I
   can't find a way out, and there's no stairway up - only one going back
   down.
A: Sounds like you've found Vlad's Tower.  Try going back down two levels and
   exiting from the base of the tower.  Then try looking in the upper left
   hand corner of the maze for another stairway going up.  The tower levels
   always have an up staircase placed there.  See the section on SPECIAL
   LEVELS for more information.

Q: I've got the amulet, and I'm on my way up, but the Wizard keeps popping in
   and I'm tired of killing him.  Is there anything I can do to get him off of
   my case?
A: Most things you can do won't stop him from coming after you again.  I saw a
   post once on rec.games.hack that had about thirty suggestions, but none of
   them would work.  Basically, the only way to stop him from coming after you
   is to exploit a "feature" of the game.  Wait near the up staircase for him.
   Then, throw a potion of paralysis at him.  During the 1-15 turns that he
   will be paralyzed, go up the staircase.  He won't come after you any more.
   The reason for this is that the game only updates the paralysis counters
   for creatures on the same level as you - thus, it realizes that the Wizard
   is still around, but paralyzed, and it won't un-paralyze him unless you go
   back to that level.  (Incidentally, don't count on this working in the next
   version of nethack.)

Q: I'm in the endgame and I'm in a long hallway that runs north-south.  I
   can't seem to find a secret door, though, and I can't teleport.  How do I
   get to the other side of the level?
A: Be patient and keep searching.  There's a secret door in the upper left
   wall of the corridor.  However, there's a lot of nasty creatures in the
   center of the endgame level, so if you're willing to sacrifice the
   experience, and you can polymorph, it might be better to turn into a xorn
   and go around the center area.

Q: I've heard a lot about "named weapons," but I can't seem to get one.  How 
   can I get one?
A: Well, there are five ways of getting named weapons, also known as 
   artifacts.  The first, and perhaps most obvious one, is to wish for it.  
   When you are asked what you want to wish for, type "a (blessed) (+n) 
   [weapon type] named [name]," where blessed and +n (be sure to substitute a 
   number for n!) are optional, and the weapon type is correct for the name 
   agree (see the ARTIFACTS section and WISHING section for more information).  
   Another way to get a named weapon is to have it given to you by your deity.  
   If you sacrifice (#offer) enough, eventually you will probably see an 
   object appear at your feet.  This will be a named weapon.  A third way to 
   get a named weapon is to find it.  Some of them will just be randomly 
   generated (although very rare), so be on the lookout.  Oh, you will know 
   it's named when you pick it up - it's not necessary to identify it.  You 
   can also gain some of the named weapons by simply finding the appropriate 
   weapon type and using the #name command.  Sting and Orcrist are notable in 
   this regard.  Finally, you can get Excalibur by #dipping a normal longsword 
   in a fountain (see FOUNTAIN EFFECTS for more details about this). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CARRYING CAPACITY:

In order to compute the carrying capacity of a character, you need to know
three things:  the character's strength, level, and if either leg is wounded.
Strength is divided into two parts, and is shown as str/nn.  Str ranges from 1
to 18 (and can jump to 25 with gauntlets of power), and nn ranges from 01 to
** (** is used since 100 won't fit in the two digit space).  How strength
affects carrying capacity varies depending upon the strength.  The character's
level is always multiplied by five and added into the carrying capacity, and
finally, for each wounded leg (either the left, right or both can be wounded)
you have to subtract ten from the carrying capacity.  Thus, the formulae for
figuring out your carrying capacity are as follows:

Strength      Capacity
-----------   ----------------------------------------------
    1-18      5*level + 5*str - 10*(wounded legs)
18/01-18/50   5*level + 90 + nn - 10*(wounded legs)
18/51-18/75   5*level + 140 + 2*(nn-50) - 10*(wounded legs)
18/76-18/90   5*level + 190 + 3*(nn-75) - 10*(wounded legs)
18/91-18/95   5*level + 235 + 5*(nn-90) - 10*(wounded legs)
18/96-18/99   5*level + 260 + 10*(nn-95) - 10*(wounded legs)
18/**         5*level + 410 - 10*(wounded legs)
25            5*level + 380 - 10*(wounded legs)

Interestingly enough, a strength of 25 doesn't allow as much of a carrying
capacity as 18/** does.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASTLE LEVEL:

Contrary to popular belief, the castle (or stronghold) level is not where the
wizard is.  The castle level is more of a proving ground - if you can get by
it, you can probably finish the game, and if you do finish it, there are
excellent rewards (specifically, there is a wand of wishing in one of the
outer four rooms).  Beware, though.  Although this level is littered with loot
(four whole rooms full of stuff to start with), it's also littered with
monsters.  Guards abound, as well as at least four dragons, several lichs,
some nagas, and so on.  An example castle level is below:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first hint that you are on the castle level is the fact that you will
appear in the upper-left corner of the map, and in a maze to boot.  You will
also tend to hear 'courtly sounds'.  The maze you are in (see map above) is
not large, but beware, for a minotaur lurks within, and they are more than a
little trouble.

After you complete the maze, you will be on a large landing, with the castle
in front of you and the moat around it.  The moat will drown you in a second,
so beware.  Also, there are invisible giant eels in the water and they will
attack you.  The first question asked is:  How do I get in?  Well, there are
many answers, so I will outline several ideas below:

If you have sacrificed enough, your god will have given you five musical notes
when you pray.  Play these notes on an instrument, and the drawbridge will
open.  If your god hasn't given you the five musical notes, try random notes.
You'll get a series of sounds.  Use these sounds like the old Master Mind game
to determine the correct notes.  (One sound means correct note, correct spot.
The other means correct note, wrong spot.)  Keep trying until the drawbridge
comes down.

A wand of opening or a spellbook of knock will cause the drawbridge to come
down.  A wand of striking will disintegrate the portcullis, but you still have
to bridge the moat to get in.  Try pushing in a boulder, zapping a wand of
cold or fire at the moat, or using water walking, levitation, or jumping
boots.

Another method of entering the castle is by polymorphing yourself into a xorn.
A xorn can walk through the walls of the castle straight into the middle.  Be
warned, though - xorns can't swim, so you'll still have to bridge the moat.

A final method of getting in is using the back door.  Using boots of
levitation or water walking (or equivalent items or spells), walk through the
moat around to the back of the castle.  Pick the lock on the back door and
walk in.  Be careful of the trapdoors, though!

Once you're into the castle, if you're not prepared to fight for your life
against ravenous hordes of monsters, there are two ways of getting rid of most
of them (albeit forfeiting the experience for killing them).  Either use a
ring of conflict or walk back over the trapdoors, letting them all go falling
down into the upper level of hell as they try to follow you.  Kill off the
rest, grab the wand of wishing, try sitting on the throne for another wish or
two, and then go for the ultimate challenge - the Wizard himself, by
teleporting down to level fifty or so.

FOUNTAIN EFFECTS:

There are basically two things you can do at a fountain.  You can either quaff
of dip something.  Different effects can occur when you do these as follows:

Quaffing at the fountain (chance is out of thirty):

Chance Effect
------ ------
  9    The cool draught refreshes you.  (Gain 1-10 nutrition)
  9    This tepid water is tasteless.  (Nothing happens)
  1    You feel self knowledgeable...  (Lists intrinsics for you)
  1    The water is foul!  You gag and vomit!  (Lose 11-30 food)
  1    The water is contaminated!  (If poison resistant, lose 1-4 hp.
         Otherwise, lose 1-10 hp and 3-6 str.)
  1    An endless stream of snakes pour forth!  (Creates water moccasins)
       You hear something hissing!  (If blind)
       The fountain bubbles furiously for a moment, then calms (If water
         moccasins have been genocided)
  1    You have unleased a water demon!  (Creates water demon)
       You feel the presence of evil.  (If blind)
       Will give you a wish (20 - dungeon level)% of the time.
  1    This water's no good!  (Each item you have has a percentage chance of
       being cursed.)
  1    You see an image of someone stalking you.  But it disappears.
         (Intrinsic see invisible gained)
  1    You sense the presence of monsters.  (Detect monster)
  1    You spot a gem in the sparkling waters.  (Find gem)
  1    You have attracted a water nymph!  (Creates water nymph)
       You hear a seductive voice.  (If blind)
       A large bubble rises to the surface and pops.  (If nymphs are genocided)
       You hear a loud pop.  (If blind and nymphs are genocided)
  1    This water gives you bad breath.  (Monsters flee one round)
  1    Water gushes forth from the overflowing fountain.  (Note:  this cannot

Dipping an item at a fountain:

If the item is a longsword, your experience level is five or greater, the
longsword dipped is not an artifact, and Excalibur does not yet exist in your
dungeon, then you have a one out of six chance of gaining Excalibur.   "A murky
hand from the depths reaches up to bless the sword.  As the hand retreats, the
fountain disappears."

Otherwise (chance is out of thirty):

Chance Effect

 16    The object gets wet.
  4    The water glows for a moment.  (Item uncursed)
       A feeling of loss comes over you.  (If item is not cursed)
  1    The item is cursed.
  1    Water demon (As in quaffing)
  1    Water nymph (As in quaffing)
  1    Water moccasins (As in quaffing)

  1    A strange tingling runs up your arm.  (Nothing happens)
  1    You feel a sudden chill.  (Nothing happens)
  1    An urge to take a bath overwhelms you.
       (If gold > 10...) You lost some of your gold in the fountain.
  1    Far below, you see coins glistening in the water.  (More coins the
       nearer the surface you are.)

KICKING:

Kicking is one of the more useful functions in nethack.  Basically, you can
kick any creature or object within the game.  You cannot, however kick
anything if you are polymorphed into a monster with no legs (a snake, for
instance) or a monster that is too small, if your legs are wounded, if your
load is too heavy, or if you are stuck in a pit or bear trap.  The effects of
kicking certain things are listed below (although be careful - kicking things
can make a lot of noise and wake up monsters on the level):

Altars - kicking an altar is, in general, a bad idea.  Deities can do all
sorts of nasty things to you if you get them pissed off.

Doors - if a door is locked and you don't have a lock-pick, one way to get
through the door is to kick it down.  Watch out for lost hit points and
wounded legs if you do this, though.  Similarly, it is possible to kick down a
secret door, even if you haven't found it.  So... if you're pretty sure
there's a secret door there, and you haven't found it after the last five
searches, you might want to try kicking it a bit.

Chests - it is possible to break the lock on a locked chest by kicking it.  Of
course, it is also possible to lose hit points and damage your legs by doing
so, so be careful to keep on eye out when at lower experience levels.

Empty space - kicking at empty space isn't terribly smart.  Although you
probably will get away with it, you do have a chance of straining a muscle,
which wounds your right leg.

Monsters - in general, when you kick a monster you will damage it.  Kicking a
monster is a good alternative if you have no weapon.  It is also a good
alternative if you are confused, as you will not then randomly wander around
if you miss the monster aimed at.  There are however a few exceptions to the
rule with kicking monsters...  notably, kicking dragons and elephants will do
no damage to them, as their skin is too thick.

Objects - in general, when you kick an object, it will move in the direction
in which you kick it.  The distance it moves will depend on your strength and
the weight of the object.  Fragile objects are not good to kick.  For
instance, kicking an egg will cause it to go splat, and kicking a potion will
generally break it.  Of course, this can be a way of identifying potions, as
you will then get the vapor effect if the potion has any.

Sinks - kicking a sink will produce various effects.  75% of the time, you
will merely get the message "Klunk!  The pipes vibrate noisily." (or just
"Klunk!" if you're blind).  Otherwise, there is a 1/3 chance of having a black
pudding ooze up from the drain and attack you (assuming they haven't been
genocided yet).  If this doesn't happen, you have a 1/3 chance of "the dish
washer" returning.  It just so happens that the dish washer is a
succubus/incubus, however, so you might want to watch out for this.  Assuming
that doesn't happen, you've got a 1/3 chance that a ring (only one per sink)
will pop up from the drain in a bunch of muddy waste.

Thrones - kicking a throne can have several effects.  If your luck is
negative, you will always end up destroying the throne and finding several
gold pieces in the rubble (probably after a few sore toes, however).  If your
luck is positive, you have a chance of kicking loose some ornamental coins
and gems instead.

LUCK:

Your luck begins at 0, (+/-1 depending on the moon), and can range from -10 to
+10.  When modified, it will decrease or increase (time-out) by 1 toward its
starting value every 600 moves (300 for angry gods) unless you're carrying a
luckstone:
   blessed   => good (positive) luck will not decrease
   uncursed  => good and bad luck will not time-out
   cursed    => bad (negative) luck will not increase.
While carrying a luckstone you may still change your luck.

To Increase Your Luck:
   1. Throw a gem at a unicorn.
      +5 (identified jewel & co-aligned unicorn)
      +1 (unidentified jewel)
      -3 to +3 (identified jewel & non-co-aligned unicorn)
   2. Sacrifice on a co-aligned altar.
      +0 to +5 (monster difficulty factor & sacrifice accepted & favor
         awarded)  Seeing a four-leaf clover is a sign that your luck has
         improved.
      =0 (if negative luck & not angry god)
      +1 (if negative luck & angry god)
   3. Sacrifice on a non-co-aligned altar.
      +1 (if negative luck & not angry god & successful)
      Chance of success is (3 + exp. level) / (8 + exp. level)
   4. Sacrificing a human corpse at a chaotic altar.
      +2 (chaotic only)
   5. Sitting on a throne.
      +1 (if negative luck, sometimes)
   6. Prayer.
      =0 (if negative luck & not angry god, small chance)

To Decrease Your Luck:

   1. Killing a co-aligned unicorn.
      -5 Period.
   2. Sacrificing a human.
      -5 (non-chaotic only)
   3. After converting to a new god, trying to sacrifice at the altar of your
      original god.  Conversion is accomplished by sacrificing at a non-co-
      aligned altar while your god is angry.
      -5 Regardless.
   4. Converting to a new god.
      -3 Regardless.
   5. Praying before your between prayer time-out expires.
      -3 Always.
   6. Breaking a mirror.
      -2 (Figures, doesn't it?)
   7. Killing a friendly human.
      -2 Period.
   8. Killing a pet (or other tame monster).
      -1 per pet.
   9. Desecrating (kicking or digging) a co-aligned altar.
      -1 (Ouch!)
  10. Killing a peaceful monster.
      -1 (50% chance)
  11. Sacrifice at a non-co-aligned altar.
      -1 (if not angry god & failure)
      Chance of success is (3 + exp. level) / (8 + exp. level)
  12. Hitting a blind monster.
      -1 (0.2% chance)

Robbing shops does not lower your luck.

as how much damage they can do for each attack, and what type of damage is 
done.  Each monster can have from one to five attacks (except the mail daemon, 
which doesn't attack).  These attacks are listed in the order in which they 
will occur, in the following format:  Attack-type Damage (Damage type).

Attack types, damage, and damage types are explained below the chart.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attack types:  The various attack types possible for an attack are listed 
  below, with a brief explanation for each.

  Attack
   Type       Description
  ------      -----------
  Bite      - The monster will attempt to bite you.
  Breath    - With this attack type, the monster will breathe at you, usually 
              breathing a gas, liquid, fire, or the like.  The classical 
              example of this is the fire breathing dragon (a red dragon in 
              nethack and most fantasy role playing games). 
  Butt      - The monster will head-butt you, much in the same way that a bull 
              would, usually in order to bring a horn into play.
  Claw      - The monster attacks using its claws.
  Defensive - This attack type will only occur if you successfully attack 
              (i.e. hit) the monster in question.  I.E. this is a retributive 
              strike.
  Engulf    - The monster will attempt to engulf you.  This can involve 
              swallowing you whole, as a purple worm would do, or simply 
              surrounding you, as a fog cloud would. 
  Explode   - With this attack type, the monster will literally explode if you 
              come within range of it, and the explosion does the damage.
  Gaze      - The monster will look at you in order attack.  Usually you have 
              to meet the monster's gaze in order for the attack to be 
              successful. 
  Hug       - With this attack type, the monster will use a crushing bear-like 
              hug in order to incapacitate you as well as prevent you from 
              running away. 
  Kick      - The monster will kick you.  For example, a horse (if it were a 
              nethack monster) would probably kick you.  Temple priest(ess)s 
              also use kicking attacks. 
  Magic     - The monster will use a magic spell to attack.
  Spit      - The monster will spit at you, and if the liquid that is spat 
              touches you, the attack is successful.  A prime example of this 
              type of attack would be the spitting cobra. 
  Sting     - The monster will attempt to sting you with a stinger.
  Touch     - In order to successfully attack with this attack type, the 
              monster need only touch you. 
  Weapon    - The monster in question will use a weapon of some type in order 
              to do the damage listed.  Thus, monsters with this attack type 
              will always be generated with weapons.

Damage:  Damage is listed in the format XdY.  In this format, X is the number 
  of dice rolled to determine the damage, and Y is the number of faces on each 
  die rolled.  Thus, if '1d6' were listed, it would mean that one six-sided 
  die would be rolled to determine the damage, giving a possible range of 1-6.  
  If '3d8' were listed, it would mean that three eight-sided dice would be 
  rolled to determine the damage, giving a possible range of 3-24.  

  Note: where "LEV" is listed (i.e. "LEVd4" or "(LEV+1)d4") then substitute 
  the monster's level for "LEV."

  Note that with some damage types, the damage indicated here will not be used 
  for actual hit point damage to the character, but may be used (for example) 
  to determine the length of paralyzation or blindness, etc. 

Damage types:  The various damage types possible for an attack are listed 
  below, with a brief explanation for each.  The default damage type (i.e. if 
  no damage type is listed for the attack) is "Physical." 

  Damage
   Type           Description
  ------          -----------
  Acid          - The damage done in this case is via acid.  Thus, if you are 
                  acid resistant (only certain monsters are), you would take 
                  no damage. 
  Amulet        - Monsters with this damage type (basically the Wizard of 
                  Yendor only) will attempt to steal the Amulet of Yendor 
                  (assuming you have it). 
  Blind         - This damage type is used in conjuction with the engulf, 
                  explode, and spit attack types.  With the engulf attack 
                  type, normal damage is done, and you will be blinded until 
                  you manage to kill the creature or are expelled from it.  
                  With the explode attack type, you will be blinded for a 
                  number of rounds equal to the listed damage, but no damage 
                  will be taken.  For the spit attack type, you will take 
                  normal damage and be blinded for 1-25 rounds. 
  Cleric Spl    - Monsters with this damage type will cast a random cleric 
                  spell, having random effects depending upon the spell cast.
  Cold          - The damage is done via cold or freezing.  Thus, if you are 
                  cold resistant, no damage will be done.  However, this type 
                  of damage also has a chance of destroying potions. 
  Con.          - Damage of this type has the possibility of being poisoned.  
                  If the attack is poisoned, your character will lose 3 to 5 
                  points of constitution in addition to the normal damage 
                  taken. 
  Confuse       - An attack doing damage of this type will confuse you for the 
                  number of rounds that would normally be damage.  (i.e. if 
                  1d6 is listed for damage, you would be confused for 1d6 
                  rounds).  No normal damage is received, however.
  Curse         - If an attack using this damage type succeeds, the attacking 
                  monster will "steal" one of your intrinsics.
  Decay         - This damage type, in addition to doing normal damage, has 
                  the capability of decaying organic material.  Thus, it can 
                  damage armor that is organic in nature (i.e. robes, leather 
                  armor, etc.). 
  Dex.          - Damage of this type has the possibility of being poisoned.  
                  If the attack is poisoned, your character will lose 3 to 5 
                  points of dexterity in addition to the normal damage taken. 
  Digest        - This damage type occurs only in conjunction with the attack 
                  type "Engulf."  Basically, once the monster has swallowed 
                  you whole, any damage done if via digestion in the monster's 
                  stomach. 
  Disease       - In addition to the normal damage done, you also have a 
                  chance of becoming sick and eventually dying of it.
  Disint./Death - This type of attack will usually kill you outright.  
                  However, if the attack is a disintegration beam and you are 
                  wearing armor, your outermost layer of armor will be 
                  destroyed instead. 
  Drain Energy  - Damage of this type is done by draining the amount of damage 
                  from your store of energy points instead of from hit points.
  Drain Life    - Monsters doing this kind of damage have a chance of draining 
                  an experience level from you in addition to the normal 
                  damage done. 
  Fire          - The damage is done via fire or heat.  Thus, if you are fire 
                  resistant, no damage will be done.  This type of damage also 
                  has a chance of catching scrolls and spellbooks on fire, and 
                  causing potions to boil and burst. 
  Heal          - This is probably the most unique of all the damage types, 
                  and is basically reserved for nurses.  If you are wearing 
                  any type of armor, or are wielding any weapon when this 
                  damage type is done to you, normal damage will occur (unless 
                  you are a healer, in which case you'll get a fun message).  
                  If, however, you aren't wearing any armor, and are not 
                  wielding any weapon, you will actually be healed by the 
                  attack, and if already at maximum hit points, there is a 
                  chance that your maximum will be increased by one point. 
  Legs          - Monsters doing this type of damage attack and do damage 
                  primarily to your legs.  Such damage can incapacitate you 
                  and prevent you from walking or fighting, especially if 
                  you're carrying a heavy load. 
  Lycanthropy   - Monsters with this damage type have a chance of not only 
                  doing normal damage, but also conferring lycanthropy upon 
                  you.  If you catch lycanthropy (signified by the message, 
                  "You feel feverish."), you will periodically change form 
                  into a rat, jackal, or wolf, depending upon which type of 
                  lycanthrope you got the disease from. 
  Mag. Mis.     - Attacks with this damage type are made via magic missiles.  
                  If you are magic resistant, no damage will be sustained.
  Paralyze      - For most attack types, this kind of damage includes not only 
                  the normal physical damage, but also the chance of being 
                  paralyzed for a random time period.  However, for 
                  "Defensive" attacks, no damage is done, and you will be 
                  paralyzed for the number of rounds listed as damage. 
  Petrify       - Monsters doing this type of damage have a chance of turning 
                  you to stone.  Generally the stoning (as it's called) starts 
                  with the limbs, and then proceeds to the rest of the body. 
  Physical      - The damage done is physical in nature (i.e. a cut to the 
                  torso, etc.).
  Rust          - Damage of this type has the capability of rusting metal.  If 
                  the attack type is defensive in nature, the weapon you used 
                  to attack can rust.  Otherwise, any metal armor you might be 
                  wearing can rust.
  Seduce        - Monsters with this damage type will attempt to seduce you 
                  and will steal as many of your items as possible while they 
                  are seducing you.  Incubi/Succubi have slightly different 
                  effects with this damage type, and can have effects ranging 
                  from giving you experience to outright killing you.
  Shock         - Damage of this type is done via electrical shock.  Thus, if 
                  you are shock resistant, no damage will be done.  However, 
                  this damage also has a chance of destroying wands and rings. 
  Sleep         - If an attack doing sleep damage succeeds, there is a chance 
                  that you will be put to sleep for a random time period in 
                  addition to the normal damage.  Sleep resistance will 
                  prevent you from being put to sleep, but you will still 
                  sustain the normal damage. 
  Slow          - Attacks doing damage of this type have the possibility of 
                  not only doing normal damage, but also of slowing you down 
                  to normal speed if you are moving at faster than normal 
                  speed. 
  Spell         - Monsters with this damage type will cast a random magic-user 
                  spell, having varying effects depending upon the spell cast. 
  Steal         - Monsters with this damage type will attempt to steal an item 
                  from your inventory.
  Steal $       - Monsters with this damage type will attempt to steal any 
                  gold which you might have.
  Stick         - If an attack doing damage of this type succeeds, in addition 
                  to doing the normal damage, you will be unable to escape the 
                  monster in the next round. 
  Str.          - Damage of this type has the possibility of being poisoned.  
                  If the attack is poisoned, your character will lose 3 to 5 
                  points of strength in addition to the normal damage taken. 
  Stun          - An attack doing damage of this type will stun you for the 
                  number of rounds that would normally be damage.  (i.e. if 
                  1d6 is listed for damage, you would be stunned for 1d6 
                  rounds).  In addition to stunning you for this time period, 
                  you will take damage equal to one-half of the time period 
                  you are stunned.  (I.e., let's say the monster can do 1d6 
                  damage.  Let's say it rolls a 4 for that 1d6.  Thus, you 
                  would be stunned for 4 rounds, and take 2 hit points of 
                  damage.)  The exception to all this is "Defensive" attacks, 
                  where you will be stunned as per a normal stun attack, but 
                  no physical damage is taken. 
  Teleport      - Monsters doing damage of this type can, in addition to doing 
                  normal damage, teleport you to another spot on the level.
  Wrap          - This is a special damage type which is similar to "Stick."  
                  However, this damage type is reserved for eels, and if 
                  successful, in addition to keeping you from running away the 
                  next round, they have a chance of pulling you into the water 
                  and drowning you.

Following is a description of the contents of each column:

Lvl  - This column contains the level of the monster.  Level determines items
       the monster's hit points, how many experience points it's worth, etc.
Spd  - This is the monster's speed.  Compare this with your standard
       character's speed of 10.
AC   - This is the monster's armor class.  The lower this is, the harder it
       will be to hit the monster.
MR   - This is the magic resistance of the monster, and it is the percentage
       chance that any spell hitting the monster has of failing.
Aln  - This is the monster's alignment.  C = Chaotic, N = Neutral, and
       L = Lawful
Wgt  - This is the weight of the monster.  Consequently, it is also the
       weight of any corpse the monster may leave.
Nutr - This is the nutritional value that can be gained from the monster's
       corpse, if eaten.
Siz  - This is the size of the monster, as may be used to compute weapon
       damage.  S is smaller than human size, and L is larger than human size.

PETS:

Pets are one of the most useful things in the dungeons and so should be
treated as such.  Here are a few useful hints regarding pets:

They will eat only what they need in order to survive and will leave food
rations alone unless they are very hungry or you throw them one.

Pets will become violent if they are too hungry-or if you leave them on a
level, go down the stairs and them come back later.

You can actually chat to your pet to gain knowledge about how hungry they are.

"You feel worried about your Dog/Cat" means that your pet is starving. "You
have a sad feeling for a moment" means that your pet has snuffed it. "You hear
noises in the distance" means that your pet is in battle.

Kittens change into housecats and then large cats, whereas little dogs become
dogs then large dogs.

Watch out when you are confused, blind, etc.  You do not want to accidentally
kill your pet.

The minute you eat a pet, every non-tame, non-peaceful monster that is on the
level will head for you with blood in its eye(s).  That is, you gain an
intrinsic:  Aggravate monster

What monsters your pets will attack is directly dependent on the level of the
pet and the level of the monster.  Pets will not attack monsters more powerful
than them.  The one exception is if you have on a ring of conflict.  If so,
your pets will attack anything.  (Ever seen a minotaur make doggie pancake?
Moral: keep your ring of conflict off if you're near a big nasty.)

If you think your pet is a bit wimpy, use a wand of polymorph on him.  If this
makes him wimpier, don't blame us - try again!

A scroll of taming can create more pets for you, but having devils as pets
can be a minor problem (although not as much of a problem in current
versions).

If you meet a wild pet, the best bet is to throw food at it - anything you
could eat.  Tripe is wonderful, but don't bother throwing rotted corpses.

You can even tame pets with names given by other people, i.e. bones levels.

A leash will allow you to keep the animal with you at all times (even if you
get teleported or go through a trap door), but also tends to make him get in
your way more often.

A whistle will attract your pet to you when applied.  Even better, a magic
whistle will teleport your pet to your side when applied.  Very useful when
going up or down levels with your pet.

Pets will not pick up cursed objects or even cross over them, which will help
you to avoid these items.  However, keep in mind that you may have to clear
cursed items from halls if you want your pet to follow you, and that if you
throw a food item (especially tripe) on a cursed item, your pet will be
trained to step on cursed items in the future. A warning, dead-end corridors
can be very bad if there is a cursed item in the exit and the pet is between
you and the cursed item (this can happen if your pet kills a creature that
was carrying a cursed item).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRAYING:

Praying can get you out of a lot of jams in the game of nethack, if your god
is pleased with you.  On the other hand, if the gods are angry at you, you can
get into an awful lot of trouble.

If your deity is pleased with you, chances are that your worst problem will be
fixed, although all of your problems could be fixed, or none of them might be
fixed (this is dependent on your luck).  The following are problems that your
deity might fix, from worst (in the deities eyes, not necessarily yours!) to
least:
   1. You are turning to stone.
   2. You are being strangled (by an amulet of strangulation).
   3. You are sick.
   4. You are starving.
   5. Your hp are below 5, or your hp are below 1/7 of max.
   6. You have lycanthropy.
   7. You are stuck in a wall.
   8. You are wearing a cursed item which levitates you.
   9. You are wearing a cursed blindfold.
  10. You are being punished.
  11. You have a cursed loadstone or cursed luckstone.
  12. You are wielding/wearing a cursed weapon/armor.
  13. You are blind.
  14. You are hungry.
  15. You are poisoned.
  16. You have wounded legs.
  17. You are stunned.
  18. You are confused.
  19. You are hallucinating.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REMOVING CURSES:

There are several ways to uncurse cursed items - and several other ways
to get rid of cursed items:

 1: Dipping in fountains will eventually remove the curse from stuff - "The
    water glows for a moment" indicates that your item has been uncursed.
    You can dip items even if you are wearing them.

 2: Reading a scroll of remove curse will remove the curse from stuff you
    are wearing.  If the scroll of remove curse is blessed, everything in
    your pack will be uncursed.

 3: If you have good relations with your god, your god will uncurse things
    you are wearing, and occasionally will remove the curse from items in
    your pack.  This will happen when you pray.

 4: Reading an uncursed scroll of enchant armor/weapon will remove the curse
    from the armor/weapon that gets enchanted.

 5: Dipping cursed items in holy water will uncurse them.

 6: A wand of cancellation will remove the curse from all items in your pack
    if you zap yourself with it.  Note, however, that it will also remove all
    enchantments and names (i.e. Stormbringer) on all items in your pack.

 7: Try having a monster steal your cursed items.  Nymphs will steal cursed
    armor and weapons.  Be sure that you have dropped everything else,
    however, before trying this.  Succubi/incubi will also remove cursed armor
    sometimes.

 8: An uncursed or blessed scroll of destroy armor can be used to destroy
    cursed armor.  Be sure to take off all your other armor before reading the
    scroll.

 9: Polymorphing yourself into a monster that can't wear armor or use a
    weapon will cause you to fall out of your armor (or it may destroy your
    armor altogether) and/or drop your weapon.

10: For those that enjoy risks, rarely, VERY rarely, a magic trap will inform
    you that 'You feel that someone is helping you'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROBBING SHOPS:

Here we have outlined a few of the standard ways of robbing a shop.  Some of
them let you get away with it scott-free.  Others will send the keystone kops
after you.  Some will even allow you to keep robbing the shop and selling the
stuff back to the shopkeeper until you have all his money!  Experiment with
these and have fun!

For reference, in all the diagrams, @ = shopkeeper, X = you (for clarity),
f = cat (or whatever pet you may have), and P = pile of goodies (also for
clarity).

Method One:  Pile everything in the shop up and teleport it out with a wand of
teleport.  This scatters it on the level for you to find.

   Enter the shop...   Make a pile...      Poof!
   -------------       -------------       -------------
   |!!$%%[))...|#      |...........|#      |.........@.|#
   |$+$$(![[.@.X#      |P....f....@-#      |...........-#
   |+$%]**!$...|f###   |.X.........|####   |.X...f.....|####
   -------------       -------------       -------------

Method Two:  Dig a hole in the wall with a wand of digging or any other handy
method of digging, and then kick the stuff out.  Two notes, here:  1) kicking
potions, eggs, or other fragile items will destroy them.  2) You cannot just
kick an item out of the shop - if you do so, the shopkeeper will charge you
for it.  You have to be outside the shop (i.e., in the wall) while you're
kicking it out of the shop.

   Get positioned...   Dig...   #          Make a pile... (not potions!)
   -------------       ----------.--       ----------X--
   |!!$%%[))...|#      |!!$%%[))...|#      |!!.f......P|#
   |$+$$(![[.@.-#      |$+$$(![[.@..f      |.....!....@.#
   |+$%]**!$...|Xf##   |+$%]**!$...|X###   |......!....|####
   -------------       -------------       -------------

   Kick...  #          You're rich!
   ----------X--       ----------.--
   |!!.........|#      |!!........f|#
   |.....!....@P#      |.....!.....X#
   |......!f...|####   |......!..@.|####
   -------------       -------------

Method Three:  Polymorph the shopkeeper into something easier to handle (with
a wand of polymorph) and then kill him/her.  Of course, once the shopkeeper's
gone, you can take what you like, including his or her gold!

   Enter the shop...   Polymorph...        Kill shopkeeper!
   -------------       -------------       -------------
   |!!$%%[))...|#      |!!$%%[))f..|#      |!!$%%[)f...|#
   |$+$$(![[.@.X#      |$+$$(![[..s-#      |$+$$(![[...-#
   |+$%]**!$...|f###   |+$%]**!$.X.|####   |+$%]**!$.X.|####
   -------------       -------------       -------------

Method Four:  If you do not happen to have any props(wands, etc), and have a
ration (especially tripe) or two, then this method is for you.  It is also the
most common:  train your pet.  Basically, if your pet drops an item right in
front of the door to the shop, you can pick it up for free.  Throw him food,
and he'll keep on doing it!

                                           Throw pet food and
   Let pet in shop...  It brings item...   take item - it is free!
   -------------       -------------       -------------
   |!!$%%[))*..|#      |!!$%%[))...|#      |!!$%%[))...|#
   |$+$$(![[]f.X#      |$+$$(![[]f*X#      |$+$$(![[].X-#
   |+$%]**!$(.@|###    |+$%]**!$(.@|###    |+$%]**!$(f@|###
   -------------       -------------       -------------

Method Five:  Teleport out.  Grab everything in the shop and then teleport the
heck out of there.  This is especially effective if you have teleport control
and know where the stairway is.  It's even better if you have your pet on a
leash, or a magic whistle, so you don't have to worry about leaving your pet
behind.  But note - the Kops *and* the shopkeeper will be after you.

   Enter the shop...   Grab everything...  Poof!
   -------------       -------------       -------------
   |!!$%%[))...|#      |...........|#      |.........@.|#
   |$+$$(![[.@.X#      |.....f....@-#      |...........-#
   |+$%]**!$...|f###   |.X.........|####   |.....f.....|####
   -------------       -------------       -------------

Method Six:  Push a rock into the shop, then use the rock to block the door.
Once the door is blocked, rip off everything in the shop and then teleport
out.  Although the Kops will be after you, you won't have to deal with a
pissed off shopkeeper.

   Push in a rock...   Keep on going...    Push it back...
   -------------       -------------       -------------

SPECIAL LEVELS:

Nethack has several "special levels."  The actual level of each of these
varies from game to game, so we can't tell you what level to look for each on,
but we can give you a description of each so that you recognize what you're
running into.

Big Level:  Basically, this level is exactly what the name implies.  The
entire level is one big room.  This is a bad level to have aggravate monster
on, and a ring of conflict is really handy here.  Here's an example:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Castle/Stronghold Level:  see section CASTLE LEVEL

Medusa Level:  Of all the creatures of Greek mythology, the gorgons  -------
were among the most powerful.  One of these was the medusa, whose    |.``..|
visage was so terrible to behold that one look at her countenance    -...`.|
would turn any living creature instantly to stone.  She was finally  |...`.|
slain by Perseus with the use of a reflective shield given him by    |.@..`|
Athena.  It is rumored that the only two ways to kill a medusa are   -------
to fight her without gazing upon her, or to reflect her terrible 
gaze back upon her, so that she, looking upon her own reflection, should turn 
to stone.  The medusa is raised back to life in nethack, so beware of the 
level upon which she resides.  You will know you are there when you begin to 
see an inordinately large number of statues, find no other life upon the 
level, and hear nothing but silence.  A sample room in which the medusa 
might reside is above at right.   

Oracle of Delphi:  The Oracle of Delphi was reknowned in ancient     -|-@--
times for her ability to tell the future with admirable accuracy.    |.```|
For instance, a great king once came to the Oracle and asked if he   |....|
should send his armies against the armies of another nation.  The    |..{.|
Oracle told him, "I tell you truly.  If you do so, you will destroy  ------
a mighty army."  Enheartened, he attacked, and sure enough, a mighty
army was destroyed - his own!  The Oracle in nethack will give you minor or
major consultations.  Minor ones are cheap, and are the same as a fortune
cookie.  Major ones are expensive, but can give some good clues.  The oracle
room will have the oracle sitting in a niche in the wall, with statues of
mountain, plain, and forest centaurs in front of her, and a fountain in the
room.  An example is shown above at right.

Rogue Level:  Rogue was one of the first of the hack and slash games.  Hack,
Nethack, UltraRogue, Moria, UMoria, Larn, Omega, and undoubtedly many more,
were all based on the idea started by rogue.  Now, rogue, like early versions
of hack, had a very distinctive look.  There were always nine rooms on each
level, and each wall of each room never had more than one doorway.  In memory
of rogue, the nethack engineers have added a "rogue level," that looks very
much like the original rogue game, and the game will tell you that it seems
like you've been on that level before.  Here's an example of one:

             -----          --------------------       ---------------------
             |   +##########+                  |       |                   |

------------------------        -----------------     ------------------

Tower Levels:  The three tower levels are the three levels that probably
generate more confusion that the entire rest of the game combined (a little
hyperbole, but not a lot).  Basically, the tower levels are three consecutive
maze levels in hell.  In the center of each of these maze levels is the a
section of the tower proper.  The tower can only be entered from the lowest
level, and there's no exit at the top.  Inside the tower are many riches, and
vampires galore.  On the top level of the tower, you'll find Vlad the Impaler,
master of the tower. (Oh, did I forget to mention that he's also a Vampire
Lord?)  Below is an example of the three tower sections.  Put each of them in
the center of a maze level, and you've got a tower level!

-------------------      -------------------      -------------------

Wizard Level:  The wizard level is (you guessed it) where the     }}}}}}}
Wizard of Yendor lives.  He has a little room in the middle of    }}---}}
an otherwise normal maze level.  Now, the trick is that this      }--^--}
little room looks just like the little rooms that are on about    }|^^^|}
half of the maze levels.  Only one of them holds the Wizard of    }--^--}
Yendor, and the real Amulet of Yendor, though, so don't be        }}---}}
fooled.  The best way to tell where you are in relation to the    }}}}}}}
Wizard is to put on a blindfold and apply a mirror to yourself
(use '.' for direction).  After a few tries, this will tell you whether the
wizard is above you, below you, or very close.  When you're on the same level,
trek in towards the middle, get past the moat, break into his home, and take
the Amulet!  An example of the Wizard's room is above at right.  Incidentally,
the traps are squeaky boards which will instantly wake up the Wizard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIAL ROOMS:

There are many varied and interesting rooms to explore in nethack.  Besides
your standard room with the possibility of randomly generated items, traps,
monsters, etc., there are several special room types that can be found within
the dungeon.  These are listed below:

Beehives:  Beehives are (you guessed it) rooms completely filled with  -------
killer bees.  There are usually one or more queen bees in one as       |.aaaa|
well.  Beehives can be quite nasty for the inexperienced character,    -.aaaa|
but if you can manage to kill them off, run around picking up the      |.aaaa|
royal jelly that will be left behind.  Eat it, and hey presto -        |.aaaa|
instant strength!                                                      -------

Barracks:  The barracks are a room type that will usually only show    -------
up on lower levels due to the fact that it will kill of all but the    |.@@@@|
most  powerful characters.  Barracks are rooms filled with soldiers.   -.@@@@|
Be careful not to blow a whistle or play a bugle on the level if you   |.@@@@|
don't want to face them. Soldiers will always wake up for a whistle    |.@@@@|
or a bugle, and come to investigate what woke them!                    -------

David's Treasure Zoo:  David's Treasure Zoo is a room totally filled   -------
with random monsters of all types and sizes.  This room can be quite   |.DooQ|
deadly, but each monster in the room will carry a sizeable sum of      -.aggh|
gold, so if you can kill off all of them, you'll probably end up       |.dCkq|
quite rich.  Wands and other ray type weapons, rings of conflict, the  |.qoGc|
ability to teleport out if you have to can be quite handy here, as in  -------
any room filled with monsters.

Graveyards:  If you have a character with a bad AC, you'd better pray  -------
that you don't run into one of these.  Graveyards are rooms filled     |W WZV|
with nasty undead creatures - wraiths and vampires that will drain     -ZZSWS|
your levels away, and zombies and skeletons and ghosts.  (Note that    |VSW V|
ghosts in a graveyard are randomly generated, although they may take   |WWZZ |
names from the high score file.  Thus, they won't leave ghost          -------
stacks.)  If you have a character with a good AC, these can be quite
a boost:  Kill off all the wraiths and eat the corpses to go up many levels!

Shops:  Shops can be an adventurer's best friend.  Note that I said    -------
shops, not shopkeepers - shopkeepers can be an adventurer's worst      |@??!!|
nightmare.  Shops come in all sizes and types.  There are shops that   -.%[))|
sell everything, and shops that specialize in an item type (wands,     |.[!%(|
for instance).  Shopkeepers always carry a key and a lot of gold, and  |.!?/=|
they guard their wares jealously.  Check out the section on ROBBING    -------
SHOPS for more information on how to rob shopkeepers blind.

Temples:  A temple is a room that is dedicated to a particular deity.  -------
Temples invariably contain an altar to that deity in the center of     |.....|
the room, and a priest(ess) of that deity nearby.  You can give an     -..@..|
offering to the deity by #chatting to the priest(ess), and will        |.._..|
perhaps have a blessing bestowed upon you.  You'll know you're         |.....|
entering a temple when you get a message along the lines of "Pilgrim,  -------
you enter a holy place."

Throne Rooms:  A throne room is a room filled with monsters.  The      -------
major difference between this room and David's Treasure Zoo is that    |.kodk|
throne rooms have a throne in them.  Sitting on this throne can        -.ooG\|
produce all sort of interesting effects, and gold can be gotten (if    |.dkgh|
you're lucky) by kicking the throne.  See the THRONE EFFECTS and       |.qCoc|
KICKING sections for more information about thrones.                   -------

Vaults:  Vaults are scattered about the various levels, and can never    ----
be entered except by digging, teleporting, or walking through walls      |$$|
(they have no doors).  Most levels with one of these two by two rooms    |$$|
filled with gold will also have a closet with a single use teleport      ----
trap in it.  That teleport trap will teleport you into the vault
(just be sure you have a way to get out).  Oh, and remember - Croesus was the
king who commissioned the vaults, and all of the vault guards know him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STARTING CHARACTERS:

Barbarian:  poison resistance, lots of strength, dex, con - mind of a slug.
            Starts off with a Two-Handed Sword. Chaotic at the start.

Valkyrie:   cold resistance, good overall fighting stats, longsword and +3
            shield.  Chaotic at the beginning.

Samurai:    fast, skilled at kicking, essentially Lawful version of Valkyrie,
            otherwise (but no cold resistance).  Starts out with katana and
            some shurikens, not to mention some fortune cookies.

Caveman:    Good Strength and Constitution, other stats are bad.  Play
            barbarians instead of these.  Starts out with a bow, arrows and a
            club though.  Believe it or not, he is Lawful.

Knight:     Not so good stats - starts with long sword, has high Wi and Ch.
            Starts off with some armor though.  Of course he is Lawful.

Healer:     Wimpy fighting stats, poison resistance, gets a stethoscope to
            start with (extremely useful).  Gets extra healing potions to
            start with (Hint:  save until you find holy water if you can).
            Also starts out with a spellbook of healing and one of extra
            healing as well and a scalpel as a weapon.  A Lawful person.

Wizard:     Wimpy fighting stats,starts with spellbooks, two rings, athame
            and gets a cloak of magic resistance (vital at deep levels).
            The Intelligence is good as to be expected for a Wizard. In the
            beginning he is Neutral.

Elf:        Generally OK stats - resists sleep, sees invisible, is fast,
            has automatic searching. This character is also Lawful.

Archaeologist:  Similar stats as Wizard, starts with tinning kit (vital), bag,
            knows all gems at first sight.  Is fast and stealthy.  Is the
            exact duplicate of Indiana Jones with the fedora hat and the
            bullwhip.  Definitely a Lawful type.

Priest:     Knows blessed/cursed state of all items.  Poor fighting stats -
            major stat is Wisdom.  Starts out with four holy water potions,
            and has extra kicking abilities.  Also starts with two spellbooks
            and a mace which can bash open chests.  Starts Neutral.

Rogue:      Good Dexterity, otherwise not particularly good stats.  Gets
            Stealth to start with.  This character is Chaotic.

Tourist:    This is a fun one to play.  Starts out with darts, loads of money,
            4 magic mapping scrolls, some healing potions, a credit card and
            the flash camera.  Generally quite weak to start off with but
            the camera is useful for blinding the enemy and the card to open
            doors, chests, etc.  This is a Neutral character.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATS:

Str (Strength):  Affects the damage you do and more to the point how much
   stuff you can pick up. You need a Str of 6 minimum to cast spells. To
   increase this stat, eat royal jelly, giant corpses, or wear gauntlets
   of power.

Dex (Dexterity):  Affects the speed of your attacks and the how likely you
   are to hit.  Affects use of harp. To increase, use gauntlets of dexterity.

Con (Constitution):  High constitution gives you extra hit points whenever you
   go up a level.

Chr (Charisma):  Affects the prices a shopkeeper will give you in a shops, and
   adds to the chance of success with a succubus/incubus.  You can increase
   this with a ring of adornment.

Wis (Wisdom):  This is what is taken into account when you pray to your god
   and the chance of getting something from a pilgrim. Increase this with a helm
   of brilliance.

Int (Intelligence):  Helps to determine whether you can transcribe a spell or,
   more to the point, the chance that you'll be able to cast it. This is also
   increased with a helm of brilliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SURVIVAL:

If you are low on hit points, or are worried about the zoo that you just
stumbled across while blind and confused, there are two primary methods to
survive beyond running away:  engraving Elbereth and a scroll of scare
monster.  As an interesting note, if you happen to get the message "This
water gives you bad breath," you will scare monsters near you away (due to
your awful halitosis).

Engraving Elbereth:

If you engrave "Elbereth" in the dust and keep standing on it, most monsters
will not attack you.  Note that humans, elves, soldiers, shopkeeper, etc. (in
short, all @'s) will not regard Elbereth, and other monsters may throw things
at you.  Dragons can also still use their breath weapons against you.  If you
swing at them or throw things at them you will scuff out the engraving,
allowing them to attack.  Also, in most cases the writing will eventually
fade out.  How long it takes to fade or scuff is dependent on what you used
to engrave.  Your fingers will do, but not for long.  A weapon is really good,
but you tend to dull blades that way (athames will not dull from engraving).
Some wands, magic markers, and other objects can also be used to engrave,
although it will take a charge to do so (wands of fire or digging are excellent
for engraving, for instance).  The trick here is to levitate, which will
prevent you from scuffing the writing.

Scare monster:

Monsters (this does not include humans) will not cross a scroll of scare
monster.  Thus, you can stand on it, and they will not attack you (similar to
Elbereth), or you could drop it in a doorway, and the monsters would not come
through (good way to cork the bottleneck of a zoo).

Every time you drop/pick up a scroll of scare monster it moves toward a cursed
state.  Drop a blessed scroll, pick it up it is uncursed.  Drop that uncursed
scroll, pick it up it is cursed.  Drop that cursed scroll, pick it up it turns
to dust.  (Incidentally, placing a scroll of scare monster in a chest and then
picking it up later will not change its status.)  Thus, if you pick up a
scroll that turns to dust, it is a worn out scare monster scroll.  One neat
trick is to keep blessing the scroll after you use it, so that you can use it
over and over again.

Note:  Minotaurs seems to be an exception to the rule here.  Standing on this
does nothing against them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THRONE EFFECTS:

When you sit upon a throne, you have a one in six chance of having some effect
take place.  The effects which can take place are as follows (equal chances):

 1. You lose 3-6 points from a random attribute, and lose 1-10 hp.
 2. One point is added to random attribute.
 3. A [massive] charge of electricity shoots through your body!  (You lose 1-6
    hp if shock resistant.  Otherwise you lose 1-30 hp.)
 4. You feel much, much better!  (If your hp are within 5 of max, add 4 to max.
    Hp are raised to max, heal blindness, sickness, and bad legs.)
 5. You notice you have no gold.  (All gold lost)
    You feel a strange sensation.  (If you have no gold)
 6. You feel your luck is changing.  (If luck + random of [0-4] < 0, +1 luck)
    Otherise, you can wish for an item.
 7. You hear a voice echo:  "Thy audience has been summoned, Sire!"  (Rather
    obvious:  lots of nasties get summoned.)
 8. You hear a voice echo:  "By thy imperious order, Sire!"  (You get to
    genocide one creature.)
 9. You hear a voice echo:  "A curse upon thee for sitting upon this most holy
    throne."  (If luck > 0, blinded for 250-349 turns; else random item cursed)
10. An image forms in your mind.  (If luck < 0 or you have intrinsic see
       invis. - magic maps level)
    Your vision clarifies.  (Otherwise gain see invisible)
11. You feel threatened.  (Aggravte monsters if luck < 0)
    You feel a wrenching sensation.  (Otherwise teleport)
12. You are granted a gift of insight.  (Identify item(s) in pack)
13. Your mind turns into a pretzel.  (You are confused for 16-22 turns)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNICORN HORNS:

When a)pplied, an uncursed or blessed unicorn horn can do any or all of the
following:  cure blindness, stop confusion, stop hallucination, cure sickness,
stop stunning, or restore ability.  Note that if the unicorn horn is cursed,
these effects will be reversed.

You can #d)ip a unicorn horn in a potion, and if the potion is a potion of
confusion, hallucination, or sickness, the potion will become a potion of
water.  If it says, "Interesting," the potion is of another type.

Unicorn horns will not rust, and they enchant well, so they make ideal
weapons, especially against rust monsters, acid blobs, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WISHES:

There are five ways to get wishes.  These are:

1.  A wand of wishing  (Note for poly-pilers here:  It is no longer possible
    to polymorph something into a wand of wishing.)
2.  A magic lamp - djinni appears and is grateful for his release (Also no
    longer possible to create via a polymorph.)
3.  A fountain (water demon appears and is sometimes grateful for his release)
    Water demons can be summoned by either quaffing or dipping something in
    the fountain.  The demon will usually kill you, but I usually try quaffing
    in all fountains with low-level characters.
4.  Occasionally, a glowing potion will have a djinni in it who is grateful
    for his release.
5.  Sitting on a throne can occasionally give you a wish.  (See THRONE EFFECTS)

To wish effectively, you should wish for an item (or items) that can
(literally) be placed in your inventory.  You could wish for a "wide sword"
and get one.  Better yet, you could wish for a "+3 wide sword" and you would
at least get a wide sword.  Whether you get the asked for enchantments depends
on a random factor.  You may wish for an enchantment as high as you want, but
your chances of getting it go exponentially downwards after +3.  Thus, you're
better off wishing for "+2 gray dragon scale mail" than let's say "blessed +4
gray dragon scale mail."  In either case you would get at least +0 gray dragon
scale mail (although it might be cursed).  If the item is one that often comes
in multiples (scrolls or potions, for example) instead of having an
enchantment, you can wish for several (i.e. 3 scrolls) and have a good chance
of getting them.  The exceptions to this rule are gold, which you can wish for
a lot of, and rocks, which you can wish for as many as you like.

The general modifiers to use when wishing are, of course, "blessed,"
"uncursed," and "cursed."  A specific modifier for small missile weapons is
"poisoned" (as it appears in your inventory).  Also there are named weapons
(artifacts), as in a "blessed +3 wide sword named Stormbringer."

Here's a few useful items and the exact wording you need to use to get them:
   "blessed +3 war hammer named Mjollnir"
   "blessed +3 broadsword named Stormbringer"
   "blessed +3 katana named Snickersnee"
   "blessed +3 long sword named Excalibur"
   "blessed +3 gray dragon scale mail"
   "blessed +3 helm of telepathy"
   "blessed +3 pair of speed boots"
   "blessed +3 gauntlets of power"
   "blessed +3 shield of reflection"
   "blessed +3 cloak of displacement"
   "blessed +3 Hawaiian shirt"
   "blessed amulet of life saving"
   "3 blessed potions of gain ability"
   "3 blessed scrolls of genocide"
   "3 cursed scrolls of genocide" (caution is advised)
   "blessed spellbook of identify" (you can never get more than one spellbook)
   "blessed ring of levitation"
   "wand of polymorph"
   "blessed tinning kit" (makes blessed tins)
   "figurine of a gray dragon" (for that pet gray dragon you've always wanted)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAME MESSAGES:

"You feel a momentary chill."                  - fire resistance gained

   * Lycanthropy means that you will periodically change into a were-thing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL HINTS:

Lizard corpses, like food rations, won't ever spoil.
It is a GREAT idea to give like-aligned priests 400*your level in gold.
If you attack a rival priest in his temple, his god will fight for him, so
  make it your temple first (i.e. convert the altar).
A guaranteed way to change your alignment is to kill of a unicorn of your
  alignment and offer the fresh corpse at an altar of the god whose alignment
  you wish to convert to.
Friendly monsters may become tame if you give them the right food (try tripe).
Zombie and mummy corpses are already old corpses, so can't be sacrificed
  (however, they can be eaten before they spoil).
The bigger the sacrifice, the better the reward.
Eating a clove of garlic cures lycanthropy.  Prayer can too.
You can use a wand of polymorph to polymorph objects as well as monsters.
A ring of warning warns:  white, pink, red, ruby, purple, and run at black.
Kicking is great for killing monsters at low levels (especially for Samurais
  and priests).
DON'T kick in shop doors that are closed for inventory.
A wand of digging makes a quick way down (use '>' for the direction).
Fill trapdoors with boulders.  You can also cross water this way.
When dipping in holy water, amber means uncursed, light blue means blessed.
Dipping a corpse in holy water preserves it.
Dipping a dart may identify a potion of sickness (it poisons the dart).
To make a scroll blank and or holy/unholy water normal, zap a wand of
  cancellation at it.
To use a wand on yourself, use '.' for the direction.
Blessed magic lamps always give wishes if they have a charge.
To identify a gray stone, kick it.  Lodestones don't move.
When you run into a great number of statues, DON'T look out.
Jubilex cannot be hurt by cockatrice corpses.
Zap monsters that engulf you with a wand of digging.
To find the mimics in a shop, walk in, then back out.
To create a scroll with a magic marker just write the name of the scroll on a
   blank scroll (i.e. "magic mapping").
If you are wearing dragon scale mail and get polymorphed, you will polymorph
  into the same type of dragon as your dragon scale mail.
Being magic resistant prevents teleport traps from working properly.
You cannot pick up item while levitating, therefore it is not always good to
   be levitating.  However, vampire lords levitate but can pick up objects.
If you want to stop levitating, just fly over a sink, and you will.
Mirrors may be used to scare some monsters.  They also, of course, kill Medusa.
If you cannot eat it now, tin it or freeze it.
You can wield a cockatrice corpse if you're wearing gloves, but don't go down
   stairs while carrying one, especially if you are overloaded.  They are
   wonderful for clearing out zoos, barracks, and throne rooms.
To determine whether an item is blessed, regular, or cursed, drop it on an
   altar.  If the glow is amber, it's blessed.  Black means cursed.
Dropping water or unholy water at a lawful altar will turn it into holy water.
Dropping water (holy or unholy) at a neutral altar will make it normal water.
Dropping water or holy water at a chaotic altar will make it unholy water.
A ring of levitation will protect you from a xan (they're real short).
It is possible to lose telepathy if you are not chaotic and you kill a
  peaceful human.
Gremlins can steal intrinsics from you.
It is possible to jump through an escaped trapdoor by hitting >.

AMULETS:

Note:  for all item lists, the "Prob" column lists the relative probability
of that particular item being randomly generated (when a level is created,
a monster is killed, an item is polymorphed, etc.).

  Name                      Effect              Prob Weight
----------------------------------------------------------
| amulet of change        | Polymorph(chng sex)| 150 | 2 |
| amulet of esp           | Telepathy          | 190 | 2 |
| amulet of life saving   | Life saved         |  90 | 2 |
| amulet of reflection    | Reflecting         |  90 | 2 |

| amulet of strangulation | Strangled          | 150 | 2 |
| amulet versus poison    | Poison resistance  | 180 | 2 |
| Amulet of Yendor        | -----              |   0 | 0 |
----------------------------------------------------------

Amulet of esp - gives intrinsic telepathy.
Amulet of life saving - will save your life once.  After you die it brings you
   back up to max hp.  Note that if you choke on something while wearing one
   of these, you're liable to keep right on eating and choke again.  Also,
   this won't save you if you genocide whatever you are.
Amulet of Yendor - no effect from wearing.  When in your possession prevents
   level teleport, often prevents normal teleports, randomly maps out blocks
   of level around you, and causes spell casting to take more energy.
Amulet of restful sleep - waits many turns, and then causes you to go to
   sleep (against your will).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDENTIFYING AMULETS:

Identifying amulets is a process of elimination, starting with determining
whether or not the amulet is cursed.  Determining whether it's cursed is easy
enough if you're a priest or have a pet on hand.  If the amulet is cursed,
don't wear it - there are too many nasty things cursed amulets can do.  If the
amulet isn't cursed, it's probably either an amulet of esp, life saving,
reflection, or versus poison.  However, watch out - amulets of change often
aren't cursed.  So, if you don't mind risking the possibility of changing
sexes (and character name), try it on and see what it does.  To see if it's an
amulet of esp, get blinded (put on a blindfold, quaff a potion of blindness,
etc.).  If you can suddenly see all the monsters on the level, that's what it
is.  Next, find a room away from all the monsters, and zap a wand at the wall
so that it bounces at you (do this with a wand that you're immune to, or
something non-harmful like a sleep ray).  If your medallion reflects the ray,
it's an amulet of reflection.  Finally, try eating something poisonous.  If it
doesn't do you any harm, it's vs. poison.  If none of these are the case, you
know it's an amulet of life saving - one of the most valuable items in the
game.

ARMOR EFFECTS:

Cloak of displacement - displaces you, causing first hit against you by a
   monster to miss and other hits to be at a severe disadvantage.
Cloak of invisibility - makes you invisible.
Cloak of magic resistance - gives you resistance against magic, such that
   certain spells won't work against you and magic traps like teleport traps
   won't have any effect on you.
Cloak of protection - makes your AC better.
Dragon scale mail - depending upon the type of dragon scale mail (red, gray,
   etc.) it will give you a different immunity.  See DEAD MONSTERS for
   information about what immunity each dragon type provides.
Elven boots - gives you stealth (i.e. if you walk into a room, a monster that
   is asleep will not wake up).
Elven cloak - gives you stealth.
Fumble boots - makes you drop your weapon, stumble and fall occasionally, etc.
   Tends to be cursed.
Gauntlets of dexterity - increases your dexterity by the defense bonus.
Gauntlets of fumbling - makes you drop your weapon, stumble and fall
   occasionally, etc.  Tends to be cursed.
Gauntlets of power - increases your strength to 25.
Helm of brilliance - adds bonus to your intelligence and wisdom (i.e. a +1
   helm will add one point to each).
Helm of opposite alignment - changes your alignment to opposite, or if neutral
   to random alignment. It can be removed to return to the original alignment.
Helm of telepathy - gives you telepathy, as the intrinsic, but you don't have
   to be blind to use it.  When not blind, only gives telepathy in vicinity,
   not for the entire screen.
Jumping boots - allows you to jump up to two squares away.
Levitation boots - causes you to levitate.  (Nasty if cursed)
Shield of reflection - ray attacks (like lightning, fire, gas) are reflected,
   and also prevents gaze attacks where the monster gazes at you.  Note that
   this will not help if you look at the monster (i.e. the medusa).
   Especially useful against dragons and floating eyes.
Speed boots - doubles your speed.  Allows you to have more attacks and be able
   to run away better.
Water walking boots - allows you to safely walk on water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDENTIFYING ARMOR:

Identifying armor is usually pretty simple.  First, make sure the armor isn't
cursed (again, simple enough if you're a priest of have a pet on hand).  Then,
simply try it on.  Any bonuses will immediately be identified for you.
Certain items will also do other things, as listed above, and these effects
will show up immediately.  The only two types of armor that are somewhat
difficult to identify are water walking boots and jumping boots.  Jumping
boots can be identified by trying to #jump once you've put them on.  If you
can jump, that's what they are.  Water walking boots are only positively
identifiable (short of a scroll of identify or equivalent) by taking a step of
faith and trying to tread on the wet stuff.

DEAD MONSTERS:

Eating certain dead monsters (monster corpses) can confer intrinsics or have
other effects.  Generally intrinsics are conferred by eating a monster with
that intrinsic, although certain individual monsters or monster types can also
confer intrinsics or have other effects.

If you eat a monster with one of the following intrinsics, you will have a
chance of gaining that intrinsic yourself.  The major exception in all cases
are baby dragon corpses, which can never confer intrinsics (so as to prevent
polymorph abuse via laying of eggs).  Note also that each monster corpse may
only confer one of these intrinsics, and they are tested for in the order in
which they are listed.

 Monster
Intrinsic    Chance of gaining
---------    -----------------
Teleport   - monster level / 10
Tel. Cont. - monster level / 15
Fire Res   - monster level / 15
Cold Res   - monster level / 15
Disin Res  - monster level / 15
Pois Res   - monster level / 15 (exceptions: killer bee and scorpion are 1/4)
Shock Res  - monster level / 15
Sleep Res  - monster level / 15 (exceptions: undead cannot confer this)

In addition, the eating the following monster corpses can also have effects as
noted:

bat              - You become stunned for 30 rounds.
chameleon        - Polymorphs you.
floating eye     - You gain telepathy.

                   turning to stone.
nurse            - Restores all lost hit points
quantum mechanic - If you are currently fast, will bring your speed to normal.
                   Otherwise, doubles your speed.
small mimic      - You mimic a pile of gold for 20 rounds.
stalker          - If you are already invisible, you will gain intrinsic
                   invisibility and intrinsic see infisible.  Otherwise, you
                   will become invisible for a random time period.  Also, you
                   will be stunned for 60 rounds in either case.
violet fungus    - Makes you hallucinate for 200 rounds.
werejackal       - You catch lycanthropy (i.e. become a werejackal)
wererat          - You catch lycanthropy (i.e. become a wererat)

wraith           - Gain one experience level, up to level 30
yellow light     - You become stunned for 60 rounds.

Finally, other intrinsics or effects may be conferred as follows:

Monsters which attack via stunning will cause you to hallucinate for 200
rounds if their corpse(s) are eaten.

If you eat a giant corpse, your strength will be increased.

Monsters that are acidic when eaten will stop you from turning to stone.

IDENTIFYING POTIONS:

There are several ways of identifying potions, mostly based upon the messages
listed above.  If you quaff a potion, you should be able to tell what it was
from the info in the quaffing section.  Throwing a potion at a monster will
often tell you what it was from the effects on that monster (especially if you
have a stethescope to examine it with).  Finally, potions can often be
identified by breaking them and observing the vapor effect.  Set the potion
down and kick it until it smashes.  Then pay close attention to what happens.
Oh, and remember - when that red dragon breathes fire at you and your potion
boils and explodes, all is not lost.  You still get the vapor effect, so you
can figure out what the next one like that will do.

RING EFFECTS:
   Note that all rings except +0 rings increase your food consumptions to
   varying degrees.

Adornment
   Will raise your charisma by the bonus on the ring.
Cold resistance
   You become invulnerable to cold, including backblasts from the wand and
   freezing spheres.
Conflict
   Causes monsters to attack each other instead of you if they are next to
   each other.
Fire resistance
   You become invulnerable to fire, including backblasts from the wand and
   (red) dragon's breath.
Gain strength
   Increments (or decrements if cursed) your strength by the appropriate
   amount.
Increase damage
   Increases the damage you do to monsters when hitting them.
Poison resistance
   You are invulnerable to poison (including poisonous corpses, but not rotted
   ones, and all poison stings, bites, and potions).
Polymorph
   Will occasionally cause you to randomly polymorph into another creature.
Polymorph control
   Allows you to choose what monster you turn into if you get polymorphed.
Protection
   Increases your armor class and (probably) your saving throws by the
   appropriate amount.  (Or decreases if cursed.)
Protection from shape changers
   Forces chameleons and other shape changers to take on their true form.
Regeneration
   Replenishes HP at about 1 a move, but increases food consumption a lot.
Searching
   Will automatically look for hidden traps/doors.
Shock resistance
   Lightning/other electrical resistance.
Stealth
   Monsters don't wake up when you enter a room.
Teleportation
   Teleports you randomly around every once in a while.
Teleport control

   teleporting.  If you try to teleport into a wall or monster, you get a
   random teleport.
Warning
   Will glow different colours when different monsters are near.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDENTIFYING RINGS:

To figure out what a ring is, again start by figuring out if the ring is
cursed or not.  If the ring is cursed, don't throw it away!  It's a prime
candidate for identification through the first method:  chuck it down a sink,
and see what happens.  See the SINK EFFECTS section for more information about
what happens when various ring types are thrown down a sink.  If the ring
isn't cursed, it probably is somewhat beneficial.  Try it on.  If something
happens immediately, you'll know what it is (levitation, for example).  Some
rings can only be identified after being worn for a while - for example, a
ring of polymorph will only polymorph you every once in a while, and a ring of
teleport also only works now and then.  Other rings can only be guessed at -
for instance, if you suddenly can find secret doors easier than you have been,
it might be a ring of searching.  If you suddenly are killing monsters more
easily, it might be a ring of increase damage.

* Determining your chances for successfully enchanting armor is fairly simple.
Your chance for succeeding (and not causing the item to disintegrate due to
over enchantment) is totally dependent upon the current bonus of the item.  If
the current bonus is three or less (five or less for elven mithril coats), you
will always succeed.  Otherwise, you have one chance out of whatever the
current bonus of the item is.  In other words, if the bonus is +4, you have a
1/4 or 25% chance of being successful.  If the bonus is +8, you have a 1/8 or
12.5% chance of being successful.  Thus, it is theoretically possible to
enchant armor up to +maxint, but the laws of probability would not favor it!

** Chances for successfully enchanting weapons are far easier.  Basically, you
will always succeed if the weapon is at +5 or less.  Once you're over that,
you have a 2/3 chance of being successful each time, regardless of the bonus.
