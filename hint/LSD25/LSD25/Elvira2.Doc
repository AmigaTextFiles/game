 OVERVIEW
 --------

 NOTE- I AINT TYPING THIS COS IT AINT NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME!.

 SPELLS AND THEIR EFFECTS
 ------------------------

 A SPELL MUST BE COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS LOCATIONS AREOUNG EACH WORLD. ONCE
 COLLECTED, A SPELL CAN BE PUT INTO ACTOION (SEE CONTROLS). SOME OF THE
 SPELLS HAVE A LIMITED TIME IN WHICH THEY CAN BE USED, SO THE CASTING OF
 THE SPELL MUST BE DONE WISELY. A COLLECTED SPELL CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE,
 HENCE IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE IT CORRECTLY TO OVERCOME A PARTICULAR
 SITUATION.

 A SPELL CA BE EXCHANGED IN THE GAME WHEN THE TRADER IS ENCOUNTERED. IT IS
 YOUR DECISION AS TO WETHER OR NOT YOU TRADE THE SPELL YOU HOLD, WITH
 ONE THAT THE TRADER HAS IN HIS COLLECTION, BEFORE CONTINUING YOUR QUEST.

 THE SPELLS
 ----------

 NOTE- THERE ARE PICCES OF THE ICONS!. SO I WILL HAVE TO SAY WOT THEY ARE!

 A SHEILD WITH ARROWS EITHER SIDE - THE SHIELD SPELL IS A TIMED SPELL THAT
                                    ONCE CAST PROTECTS ELVIRA AGAINST HITS
                                    FROM THE MONSTERS.

 A FLAME WITH ARROWS ABOVE IT - THE FIRE RESISTANCE SPELL PROTECTS ELVIRA
                                FROM HEAT, ALLOWING HER TO WALK THROUGH RED
                                HOT LAVA OR FLAMES.

 A FIRST AID BOX - THE FIRST AID SPELL GIVE ELVIRA AND EXTRA LIFE AND ALLOWS
                   HER TO RECOUPARATE ENERGY IN TIMES OF CRSIS

 A FEATHER - THE  FEATHER FALL SPELL GIVE ELVIRA THE ABILITY TO FALL FROM
             HEIGHTS AND DRIFT DOWN TO A SAFE LANDING

 A WORLD WITH A ARROW AROUND IT - THE WORLD WALK SPELL IS USED BE ELVIRA
                                  TO PROGRESS TO THE NEXT WORLD IN HER QUEST

 A TELEPORT THANG! - THE TELEPORT SPELL IS COLLECTED TO ENABLE TELEPORTERS
                     TO BE USED. THUS THIS SPELL IS NEVER ACTUALLY CAST AND
                     REMAINS WITH YOU UNTIL THE END OF THE PARTICULAR WORLD
                     IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN COLLECTED.

 A LIGHT FLAME - THE ICE BLAST SPELL IS MORE DEADLY THEN A COLLECTED WEAPON
                 THE DAMAGE THAT THE SPELL CAUSES DEPENDS ON THE WORLD IN
                 WHICH IT IS USED. IT IS NOT A TIMED SPELL BUT WILL BE LOST
                 WHEN A NEW WEAPON IS COLLECTED.

 A DARK FLAME - THE FIREBALL SPELL IS SIMILAR TO THE ICE BLAS SPELL IN TERMS
                OF POWER AND DAMAGE THAT THE SPELL CAN CAUSE, AND AGAIN IS
                NOT TIMED.

 A LIGHTNING BLOT - THE LIGHTNING SPELL WILL STRIKE A MONSTER CAUSING
                    IMMENSE DAMAGE. ONCE THE SPELL HAS RUN OUT OF TIME YOU
                    WILL RETURN TO THE PEVIOUSLY HELD WEAPON

 WEAPONS
 -------

 THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF WEAPON SCATTERED AROUND THE LEVELS. ONCE A WEAPON
 OF A PARTICULAR TYPE HAS BEEN COLLECTED IT'S FIRE POWER CAN BE INCREASED
 TO A MAXIMUM OF FIVE FOLD, BY COLLECTING FURTHER WEAPONS POTS OF THE SAME
 TYPE. ONCE A WEAPON POT OD A DIFFERENT WEAPON TYPE IS COLLECTED, YOU
 RETURN TO ONE UNIT OF POWER FOR THE NEWLY COLLECTED WEAPON/

 A DAGGER CAUSES ONE POINT OF DAMAGE
 A STAR CAUSES TWO POINTS OF DAMAGE
 A TORCH CAUASES THREE POINTS OF DAMAGE

 COLLECTABLES
 ------------

 OTHER ITEMS THAT MAY BE COLLECTED TO HELP YOU IN YOU QUEST ARE:

 FOOD - COLLECTING FOOD ADDS 10 POINTS TO ELVIRA STRENGTH
 TREASURE CHESTS - THESE ADD POINTS TO YOUR SCORE.
 A RUN STONES - THE RUNE IS AN ACIENT ALPHABETIC SCRIPT WHICH WAS USED
                AS A WRITTEN LANGUAGE. RUNES WERE EMPLOYES AS INSCRIPTIONS
                AND USED FOR TELLING FORTUNES. RUNES IN THIS GAME HAVE A
                VALUE, WHEREBY EACH STONE IS WORTH EITHER FIVE OR TEN POINTS
                OF PURCHASING POWER. RUNES ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED UNDER THE
                TRADER HEADING.

                          THE END!
