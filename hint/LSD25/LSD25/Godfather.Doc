First a note to the tosser who did the protection for this game.

  When you put novella protection on your games, it is done so that you
  can make a back up.  Why did you put 'Light MFM' on the bloody disk!!
  It totally defeated the whole point in it being novella.  It took me
  about 20 minutes extra to get rid of the 'Light MFM'.  Dont waste your
  time with lame efforts.  Also your fucking file loader was well dodgy.
  Several times it failed to load pictures in.  Thank god I was there to
  fix the fucking thing.  So not only did I crack it, but now it is 100%

The Godfather: Action Game.
---------------------------

Scenario
--------

LEVEL 1

The setting is New York in the 1940's.  You find yourself walking the back
streets of a run down neighbourhood, in the early evening.

You enter a local bar which at first appears to be deserted.  Take care...
in your line of business things are 'not as they seem'.

Further along the street you find a barber's shop.  Upon entering there
is a deadly silence.  Anticipating a possible attack you brace yourself 
for what lies ahead.

LEVEL 2

The 1950's streets of Las Vegas is the next setting, brightly lit and full 
activity.  Pedestrians go about their evening's business, heading for the 
cafes, bars and casinos.

As you head down the street, you witness an explosion at a nearby family
run casino.

You consider foul play when you see the bombers fleeing the scene.  Your 
next objective is to enter the colosseum casino and gain revenge for the
bombing, taking out the opposing familys hoods.  Go carefully, you don't
want to harm any innocent bystanders.

LEVEL 3

Havana, Cuba just before the revolution.  As you walk through the poor part
of town, you can see the swanky hotels controlled by the mob in the 
background.

Amidst the remains of a shanty town stands the opulent mansion of Hyman Roth.
You need to enter this mansion but beware - the grounds are crawling with 
armed henchmen who aim to stop you dead in your tracks!

LEVEL 4 

The luxurious surroundings of an exclusive Marina somewhere in Miami during
the 1970's is where the next level takes place.  

The Marina is filled with the sumptuosly furnished yachts moored to the 
jetty.  In hot pursuit of the baddies you find your opponents huge ocean
going motor cruiser, and fight your way on board.


LEVEL 5

After surviving a number of ambushes, you arrive at the gates of one of 
the family's homes.  Set in a small town in America it is now the 1980's.

All the heads of the families are present.  In the conservatory the 
meeting is disturbed by a suspicious helicopter hovering outside. 
This is the final confrontation, you must defend the assembled Dons
by destroying the helicopter, and its crew of assasins.

Your success will cement a near peace between rival families, and the
player will receive his reward from his own Don.

Failure to do so means that the bloody war will continue.
