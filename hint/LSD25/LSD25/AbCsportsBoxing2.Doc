   Rules of the Ring!:

   In Exhibition mode you can select the number of rounds, 1 through 12.
   In career fights, the number of rounds depends upon your boxer's ranking.

   The rounds are clocked 3 minutes.

   There is a 10-Point MUST system. (Judges award 10 points to the winner
   of a round, and fewer to the loser.)

   3 knockdowns in one round is a technical knockout.

   Depending on the referee, 3 of 4 cuts stop the fight.

   A boxer has until the count of 10 to get up after the knockdown. A boxer
   who is knocked-down cannot be saved by the bell.
   
   Once your opponent comes into punching range, the view will change from
   top-down to up-close and personal.

   Joystick LEFT and RIGHT moves your boxer either away from or toward your
   opponent

   Joystick UP and DOWN controls whether your fighter stands up or crouches
   down. A punch thrown while standing will be directed toward your opponent's
   head and one thrown from a croch will go to his body.

  Throwing Power Punches:

  Along with basic individual punches, you can throw power punches. The steps
  to throwing a power punch are:

  1. Press the button(s) and joystick to throw a normal punch.

  2. While holding the button(s) from the last punch, move the joystick UP
     or DOWN to put your boxer into the desired position (standing or
     crouching). He will then cock the arm opposite the one used in Step 1.
     Now release the button(s) and joystick.

  3. Press the button(s) to throw the punch you want

  NOTE:   To end a power punch without throwing the second punch, simply
          release the button(s) and move the joystick LEFT or RIGHT.

  Power punches do more damage than normal punche, but your boxer is more
  vulnerable when throwing one.

  If you can land a good power punch, your boxer might sense his opponent is
  hurt and could go into "Killer" mode which is determined by your boxer's
  name flashing. In Killer Mode, your punches have maximum impact, so go for
  the knockdown right away.


  Stamina-
    Stamina is worn away every time you get hit and every time you throw a
    punch, especially when you miss. You can replenish Stamina by avoiding
    contact. Stamina is also restored significantly between rounds--
    amounts vary by boxer, depending on his conditioning rating.


  Head-
    Punches that land to your head will reduce your Knockdown Head Guage.
    Levels on this gauge are restored only between rounds, again based on
    conditioning.

  Body-
    The Knckdown Body Gauge operates exactly like the Knockdown Head Gauge.

  Knockdowns-
    As your Knockdown Gauges are worn away during a fight, you may
    run the risk of getting knocked down. When you go down, it's not always
    "for the count" You can encourage your boxer to get up by pressing
    BUTTON 1 while the referee is counting. The Longer you wait to get up,
    the more stamina you'll regain. Naturally, if the ref hits "10" before
    you've regained your senses.. it's all over.


  Survival Tips

  For Practice, choose Human vs. Human mode. Since there will be no one
  controlling your opponent, he won't move. In this condition, he makes
  an excellent practice dummy.

  To Learn the controls, fight a human vs. human exhibition match. Move
  the boxers closer until you see the side view. Practice each punch and
  some power punches. Move the second boxer into position and get a feel
  for the range and sounds. Note: IN order to select a boxer for player 2,
  you will need to set up the configuration for Player 2 in the install
  Program.

  To throw a punch hold down the Button(s) and press the joystick LEFT or
  RIGHT. Don't pound on the buttons, but learn to press and release them
  evenly as you lan your punches.

  Each punch has a different range. Practice using punch ranges to hit
  your opponent as he moves in and out. Following are punches in order of
  longest to shortest range for a right handed boxer: Left Jab, Right
  Straight, Left Hook, Right Cross, Left Uppercut, Right Uppercut.
  
  After creating your boxer in New Career, fight a few Exhibition matches.
  This will help you get used to the range and speed of your boxer.

  Before deciding on an opponent, check out your opponent's stats by looking
  in the Magazine. Note how he has won and lost his fights (ie. KO or
  Points). Also take note of his trainer since each trainer adds points to
  two of the boxers ratings

  When moving on to next month's fight, watch the videos of computer vs.
  computer fights of boxers near your ranking; you will probably end up
  fighting one of these boxers so scout them first.

  When in Training Camp, don't hesitate to fight an exhibition match.
  These bouts won't affect your ratings.

  You can change trainers according to your boxing style. You should hire
  trainers that willwork with you on ratings you wish to improve.

  Hitting an opponent in the body reduces his stamina more than hitting his
  head with the same type of punch, but landing one on the head might cause
  a cut or a quick knockdown.

  If any of your knockdown gauges get low, go into defensive mode: back away
  from your opponent, mimc his stance so he can't land a punch, or move in
  and get into a clinch.
