BAAL - THE HORROR BEGINS
------------------------
Archaeology is a strange profession at the best of times, digging up
human remains, picking through what is left of a civilisation after
hundreds of years makes you feel you could be one of the pack of
salivating wolves or a hooded vulture whose patience has been rewarded
with a few maggoty remains and that's if you're lucky. But i shouldn't
complain, the fact is i enjoy it immensely, or i did until we started
our latest dig and i began recieving the letters. At first i put them
down to some kind of crazy crank with nothing better to do. The lads on
the dig thought them a great joke. They started putting chicken bones on
my door and one of them gave me a barbie doll with pins. They pulled my
leg about them coming from a jilted lover, but they weren't the type of
letter. They looked like they'd been written by somebody (thing?) who
was incredibly old. The writing, - no, scrawl - was barely dicepherable.
What i was able to read warned of terrible destruction of the earth, or
death, plague, and of killing of man just for the hell of it. There were
comments about the dig too; I couldn't decide whether they were threats
or warnings. Whoever it was knew a lot about the massive stone slab we
had uncovered.

The stone came to light after we had removed yet more human remains from
the site. The general concensus of opinion was that we had stumbled
across an ancient burial ground but i didn't agree. The thing i couldn't
understand was the grotesque mutilation of so many of the remains, of
the look of abject terror on the faces. It was as if they had seen hell
on earth and had died a hideous death in the process - but why?

The stone was uncovered with strange evil looking hieroglyphics
depicting horned monsters, massive toothed demons, mutants of all shapes
and sizes. In the centre of the stone was a single word "BAAL", it stood
out from the surrounding filth like a puss filled sore. I thought it
looked like a massive door, but to what chamber? The mood of the team
changed as a feeling of dread settled over us - in silence that night we
all went to bed unsure of what tommorow would bring. When i got home
another letter was waiting, i suddenely felt very cold & afraid. My
hands were clammy as i opened it to reveal a crudely composed rhyme
written again by my poison pen friend.

Look at the date,
Turn the last three around
remove the I
your screams won't make a sound.

This one had me totally lost; what was significant about today's date -
5th June 1999, three what? and for heaven's sake there's no 'I' in June
to remove. But the last line brought back images of those corpses all
with their mouths wide open as if in silent scream, I shivered as if
someone or something had walked over my grave.

I played with my food rather than eating it that night and as i looked
at the steak on my plate i suddenely wished i'd become a vegetarian. The
meat (flesh) just stuck in my throat. I decided to swop the solids for
liquid refreshment and opened a can of beer. The bitterness of the beer
matched my moodas i attempted to look at the problem logically. What had
these letters, today's date, the poor tortured souls who had died so
hideously all got in common? and then of course there was the massive
stone with the carvings and BAAL - who or what is BAAL? That feeling of
dread returned, but i needed to know.

I programmed everything i knew into the computer in the hope that
someting relevant just might surface but it had no data on BAAL. So in
desperation i rang my old university lecturer praying that he hadn't
moved or (as i realised how old he must be) died. After what seemed a
life time the phone was answered by a woman and my heart sank thinking
he must have gone but she explained that she was his housekeeper, that
she was already in bed and hated being disturbed. I tried the old charm
on her and soon had her eating out of my hand. In no time old Jonesy was
growling down the phone at me, muttering about being woken in the middle
of the night and who the blazes did i think i was. I just said one word
- BAAL, silence - you could have heard a pin drop, and then a whisper.

"Don't move the stone"
"How do you know about the stone?" I asked
"It was foretold by an old scottish monk way back in the 12th century",
the old man replied.
"He wrote that a pictured stonw would cause death and destruction to the
world at a time when man was reaching for the stars. His contemporaries
thought him crazy and locked him away, but it looks like he wasn't so
daft after all".
"But i don't understand, what have the stars got to do with it?".

He tutted down the phone, and i smiled to myself as he obviously hadn't
changed a bit, he was still impatient Jonesy,

"Don't you see that's a reference to man's space flights!"

I realised as he spoke I'd not told him about my secret letter writer so
i quickly went through everything that had happened. They didn't make
sense to him either, he told me he needed to refer to some past notes
and would ring me back. He left me with a chilling warning

"Move that stone at your peril."

I sat for a while trying to come to terms with the idea that behind that
stone there lurked a beast, a creature so vile that to let it loose
would mean man's destruction. I just couldn't believe it. It was like
the beginning of a horror movie except this time it was for real and the
film had a very reluctant leading man - ME!!

I was rudely awaken by the shrilling of the phone,
"Where have you been?" barked Jonesy as I answered it "I've been ringing
you for hours. You've not moved that stone have you?"

I apologised and assured him i'd not been near.

"While you've been in the land of the nod I've been busy. I checked up
on what our supposed mad monk had propheised in case there was any
reference to dates or times."

He asked me to read the verse again. When i had finished i thought the
phone line had gone dead - then i heard a groan and before i could ask
if he was okay he said in a fearful voice

"You recieved the last letter on the 5th - a day early"
"What do you mean?" I replied,
"That letter should arrived today, the 6th.
"You could be right" I said "But there's still no I in June"
"Heavens you are stupid today" Jonesy said rudely "It's not an I it's a
number 1, don't you see it says - just look at the date (it being now
the 6th of June 1999) turn the last three around - that turns the three
nines into sixes, remove the one (not the I as you read it) leaving you
with the date the 6th of the 6th followed by 666 and you know what it
is?"

I felt sick as i said "Oh my God, the sign of the devil".

As I answered him I noticed my watch on the table - I couldn't believe
the time - 7:50am. I dropped the phone and ran as the lads would already
be on the dig. I prayed I wouldn't be too late as i reached the brow of
the hill overlooking the site.

They had enlisted the help of a large excavator to which they had
attached thick wire strops connected to large eye bolts in the rock. My
cries were lost to the digger as it took the strain and i watched in
horror as the stone started to move. For what seemed like an eternity
nothing happened as i started to run down the hill.

It began as a low rumble, and then a stale foul air erupted from the
uncovered hole. I was thrown to the ground by the roar that followed,
the stench of death by now making me retch.

By this time panic had set in with the men and some started to run. They
were the lucky few - others were frozen to the spot in absoloute terror
- they died where they stood as BAAL rose through the mayhem firing at
anything in his sight. As the dust settled he seemed to survey the area
like an evil general after a battle pleased at the carnage before him.
My mind was working over time on one thought - escape, but the idea flew
right out of the window as he turned to the small hill where i lay
transfixed with fear.

"Good of you to come and watch the sideshow" ,BAAL sneered
sarcastically. "I'm sorry it was all over rather quickly for you, but
never mind, the main event will thrill you to death. He paused and then
added "yes, literally to your death."
"Why me?" i screamed (more in anger than in fear).
He gestured with his hand as if to dismiss me and replied "You just
happen to be useful to me, but any of you pathetic humans would have
satisfied my needs. By the way did you like my letters?"

The demon said this with a terrible evil grin on his face. His look said
it all, he was revelling in the power that burst from his whole self.
The fiend was just playing with me, the letters were all a game. He
interrupted my train of thought by boasting that even as he spoke, his
army of undead were stealing the thing he'd come for - a top secret war
machine with which he could rule or destroy the world. He sneered.

"When we meet again, I will be your master. At last the world will be
mine."

With that, he was gone, back to his stench filled lair, to await the
return of the undead. Unfortunately I had a funny feeling that we would
be meeting again very soon.

That all happened 3 days ago, events have moved fast since then. A war
council has set up an elite squadron of men, code named the 'TIME
WARRIORS' - their mission to find and destroy BAAL and return with the
war machine.

MISSION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
You are in charge of the TIME WARRIORS and here are your top secret
mission instructions. You must guide and control each TIME WARRIOR in
his quest. Although it is impossible to say what horrors you will
encounter when you enter BAAL's lair, his enormous power coupled with
his huge army of monstrous beasts make him an extremely dangerous enemy.

We pray you can do it, we know you can. Many lives will be lost in the
numerous bloody battles ahead but BAAL must be defeated. If not we run
the risk of being ruled by a power crazy demon at best, at worst the
earth as we know it is doomed. OUR FATE IS IN YOUR HANDS.....

BASIC PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------
The joystick is used to control the warrior as follows:
Without firebutton pressed:

j/s centre  - Warrior is still and in firing position where appropriate.
up/down     - Warrior up or down ladders where appropriate.
left/right  - Warrior turn/move left or right where appropriate.

With firebutton pressed:

j/s centre  - Warrior fires laser in direction faced where appropriate.
              (including off the ladders!)
up          - Warrior jumps straight up where appropriate.
down        - Same as j/s centre.
left/right  - Warrior stops & fires or transports where appropriate.
j/s diagonal- Warrior somersaults forward in direction he is facing
              where appropriate.

(It says 'where appropriate', because depending on your situation you
won't be able to carry out some actions, for instance, you can't
somersault off a ladder!)

Where the title screen is being displayed and the music is playing the
following keys can be used:

S           - Save high score table to disk
F10         - Toggle high score table display
<SPACE>     - Start game

KEYBOARD ACTIONS
----------------
The keyboard is also used for some functions:

F1          - Set screen sync to 50hz.
F2          - Set screen sync to 60hz.
1           - Select laser mode 1.
2           - Select laser mode 2*.
3           - Select laser mode 3*.
4           - Select laser mode 4*.
C           - Toggle area co-ordinate display on / off.
P           - Pause game (any key to resume).
R           - Refuel laser (see note below).
S           - Save current game position (see note below).
L           - Load previously saved game (see note below).
ESC         - (With fire button pressed) Abort current game.

* Can only be used when corresponding cartridge has been collected.
  Numbers refer to ones on main keyboard (not numeric keypad).

REFUEL LASER
------------
To refuel the lasers you have to first find one of the few refueling
points and move up to it from the right hand side only, until you are in
very close proximity to it (but not touching). If for some reason you
can not refuel, the info console will tell you. For instance if you have
blown the refueling point up you won't be able to refuel! It could be
though, that you aren't close enough so move close; or you could be too
close (touching) in which case move back slightly and try again. To stop
refueling just move your warrior away.

SAVE GAME
---------
Follow the instructions for refueling but instead of pressing 'R' you
must press 'S' for save. This is only a limited save game facility and
as such is only avaliable in the underground cave section.

LOAD GAME
---------
To load in a presaved game, you may want to do so by pressing 'L'. You
will be asked to verify this, type 'Y' to go ahead or 'N' to abort. This
option is only avaliable in the underground cave world.

TRANSPORTING
------------
There are 3 seperate domains to Baal, 2 large, 1 small. Once all war
machines pieces have been collected (they flash yellow), you need to
find the transporter, enter it and press the fire button. You will then
be transported to the next domain. If you do not have all the war
machine pieces in that particular domain, you will not be able to
transport (You require 10 components to travel from domain 1 to domain 2
and a further 8 from there to the final part of your mission. Each time
a component is collected it turns off one of the flashing L.E.Ds at the
bottom of the screen.) Once you have successfully transported, your
squadron will be granted an extra time warrior. If you have 6 or more
warriors, only 5 will be displayed in the "Active warriors" box, but
don't worry, they are still there.

THE LASER
---------
Your laser has 4 weapon modes (you need the cartridges for 3 of them).
The first is very weak and objects will need many hits before being
destroyed, some more powerful than others. Some objects can't be
destroyed at all where as others need the more powerful weapon modes (4
is the most powerful). When you are low on laser energy (electrolite),
the laser bolt will flash when it is fired.

ENERGY SHIELDS/SCANNER
----------------------
You are equipped with a personal energy shield that will protect you
from alien missiles only, for a limited number of hits. It can be
topped-up at any refueling point. The scanner is equipped with an early
warning system, a flashing red arrow in the top corners of the screen
tell you of an approaching alien.

NOTE:An extra warrior will be designated to your squadron for every
     5,000 personal status points you achieve.

END OF GAME
-----------
Once the game is over, and you have a high personal status, you will be
requested to identify yourself. To do so just type in your name using
the main keyboard. The numeric keypad is used if you want to include
special characters in your name. Each number on the numeric keypad will
produce the character above the numbers on the main keyboard (i.e.
pressing 1 on the numeric keypad will display a!). If you make a
mistake, use the 'backspace' key to delete it. Press 'return' once you
are finished.

To restart the game you must press the space bar or if you wish to go
back to the title screen and music (all 11 minutes of it) you can press
the 'return' key.
