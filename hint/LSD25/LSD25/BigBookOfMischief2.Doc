6.0     ROCKETS AND CANNONS

     Rockets and cannon are generally thought of as heavy artillery.
Perpetrators of violence do not usually employ such devices, because they are
difficult or impossible to acquire.  They are not, however, impossible to
make. Any individual who can make or buy black powder or pyrodex can make such
things. A terrorist with a cannon or large rocket is, indeed, something to
fear.


6.1     ROCKETS

     Rockets were first developed by the Chinese several hundred years before
the myth of christ began.  They were used for entertainment, in the form of
fireworks. They were not usually used for military purposes because they were
inaccurate, expensive, and unpredictable.  In modern times, however, rockets
are used constantly by the military, since they are cheap, reliable, and have
no recoil. Perpetrators of violence, fortunately, cannot obtain military
rockets, but they can make or buy rocket engines.  Model rocketry is a popular
hobby of the space age, and to launch a rocket, an engine is required.  Estes,
a subsidiary of Damon, is the leading manufacturer of model rockets and rocket
engines.  Their most powerful engine, the "D" engine, can develop almost 12
lbs. of thrust; enough to send a relatively large explosive charge a
significant distance. Other companies, such as Centuri, produce even larger
rocket engines, which develop up to 30 lbs. of thrust.  These model rocket
engines are quite reliable, and are designed to be fired electrically.  Most
model rocket engines have three basic sections.  The diagram below will help
explain them.

     The clay nozzle is where the igniter is inserted.  When the area labeled
"thrust" is ignited, the "thrust" material, usually a large single grain of a
propellant such as black powder or pyrodex, burns, forcing large volumes of
hot, rapidly expanding gasses out the narrow nozzle, pushing the rocket
forward.
     After the material has been consumed, the smoke section of the engine is
ignited.  It is usually a slow-burning material, similar to black powder that
has had various compounds added to it to produce visible smoke, usually black,
white, or yellow in color.  This section exists so that the rocket will be
seen when it reaches its maximum altitude, or apogee.
     When it is burned up, it ignites the ejection charge, labeled "eject".
The ejection charge is finely powdered black powder.  It burns very rapidly,
exploding, in effect.  The explosion of the ejection charge pushes out the
parachute of the model rocket. It could also be used to ignite the fuse of a
bomb...

     Rocket engines have their own peculiar labeling system.  Typical engine
labels are: 1/4A-2T, 1/2A-3T, A8-3, B6-4, C6-7, and D12-5.  The letter is an
indicator of the power of an engine.  "B" engines are twice as powerful as "A"
engines, and "C" engines are twice as powerful as "B" engines, and so on.  The
number following the letter is the approximate thrust of the engine, in
pounds. the final number and letter is the time delay, from the time that the
thrust period of engine burn ends until the ejection charge fires; "3T"
indicates a 3 second delay.

NOTE: an extremely effective rocket propellant can be made by mixing aluminum
  dust with ammonium perchlorate and a very small amount of iron oxide. The
  mixture is bound together by an epoxy.


6.11     BASIC ROCKET BOMB

     A rocket bomb is simply what the name implies: a bomb that is delivered
to its target by means of a rocket.  Most people who would make such a device
would use a model rocket engine to power the device.  By cutting fins from
balsa wood and gluing them to a large rocket engine, such as the Estes "C"
engine, a basic rocket could be constructed.  Then, by attaching a "crater
maker", or CO2 cartridge bomb to the rocket, a bomb would be added.  To insure
that the fuse of the "crater maker" (see sect. 4.42) ignited, the clay over
the ejection charge of the engine should be scraped off with a plastic tool.
The fuse of the bomb should be touching the ejection charge, as shown below.


          ____________ rocket engine

     Duct tape is the best way to attach the crater maker to the rocket
engine. Note in the diagram the absence of the clay over the ejection charge
Many different types of explosive payloads can be attached to the rocket, such
as a high explosive, an incendiary device, or a chemical fire bottle.

   Either four or three fins must be glued to the rocket engine to insure that
the rocket flies straight. The fins should look like the following diagram:

          |  \

          |       |
          |       |
           \_____/


     The leading edge and trailing edge should be sanded with sandpaper so
that they are rounded.  This will help make the rocket fly straight.  A two
inch long section of a plastic straw can be attached to the rocket to launch
it from.  A clothes hanger can be cut and made into a launch rod.  The segment
of a plastic straw should be glued to the rocket engine adjacent to one of the
fins of the rocket.  A front view of a completed rocket bomb is shown below.

                              |
                              |

     By cutting a coat hanger at the indicated arrows, and bending it, a
launch rod can be made.  After a fuse is inserted in the engine, the rocket is
simply slid down the launch rod, which is put through the segment of plastic
straw. The rocket should slide easily along a coathanger, such as the one
illustated on the following page:

6.12     LONG RANGE ROCKET BOMB

     Long range rockets can be made by using multi-stage rockets.  Model
rocket engines with an "0" for a time delay are designed for use in
multi-stage rockets.  An engine such as the D12-0 is an excellent example of
such an engine. Immediately after the thrust period is over, the ejection
charge explodes.  If another engine is placed directly against the back of an
"0" engine, the explosion of the ejection charge will send hot gasses and
burning particles into the nozzle of the engine above it, and ignite the
thrust section.  This will push the used "0" engine off of the rocket, causing
an overall loss of weight.

 The main advantage of a multi-stage rocket is that it loses weight as
travels, and it gains velocity.  A multi-stage rocket must be designed
somewhat differently than a single stage rocket, since, in order for a rocket
to fly straight, its center of gravity must be ahead of its center of drag.
This is accomplished by adding weight to the front of the rocket, or by moving
the center of drag back by putting fins on the rocket that are well behind the
rocket.  A diagram of a multi-stage rocket appears on the following page:

     The fuse is put in the bottom engine.

     Two, three, or even four stages can be added to a rocket bomb to give it
a longer range.  It is important, however, that for each additional stage, the
fin area gets larger.


6.13     MULTIPLE WARHEAD ROCKET BOMBS

     "M.R.V." is an acronym for Multiple Reentry Vehicle.  The concept is
simple: put more than one explosive warhead on a single missile.  This can be
done without too much difficulty by anyone who knows how to make crater-makers
and can buy rocket engines.  By attaching crater makers with long fuses to a
rocket, it is possible that a single rocket could deliver several explosive
devices to a target. Such a rocket might look like the diagram on the
following page:

              ___
             /   \                 The crater makers are attached to
             |   |            the tube of rolled paper with tape. the
             | C |            paper tube is made by rolling and gluing
             | M |            a 4 inch by 8 inch piece of paper. The
             |___|            tube is glued to the engine, and is
          ___|   |___         filled with gunpowder or black powder.

6.2     CANNON

     The cannon is a piece of artillery that has been in use since the 11th
century.  It is not unlike a musket, in that it is filled with powder, loaded,
and fired.  Cannons of this sort must also be cleaned after each shot,
otherwise, the projectile may jam in the barrel when it is fired, causing the
barrel to explode.  A sociopath could build a cannon without too much trouble,
if he/she had a little bit of money, and some patience.


6.21     BASIC PIPE CANNON


     A simple cannon can be made from a thick pipe by almost anyone.  The only
difficult part is finding a pipe that is extremely smooth on its interior.
This is absolutely necessary; otherwise, the projectile may jam.  Copper or
aluminum piping is usually smooth enough, but it must also be extremely thick
to withstand the pressure developed by the expanding hot gasses in a cannon.


  If one uses a projectile such as a CO2 cartridge, since such a projectile
can be made to explode, a pipe that is about 1.5 - 2 feet long is ideal.  Such
a pipe MUST have walls that are at least 1/3 to 1/2 an inch thick, and be very
smooth on the interior.  If possible, screw an endplug into the pipe.
Otherwise, the pipe must be crimped and folded closed, without cracking or
tearing the pipe. A small hole is drilled in the back of the pipe near the
crimp or endplug. Then, all that need be done is fill the pipe with about two
teaspoons of grade blackpowder or pyrodex, insert a fuse, pack it lightly by
ramming a wad of tissue paper down the barrel, and drop in a CO2 cartridge.
Brace the cannon securely against a strong structure, light the fuse, and run.
If the person is lucky, he will not have overcharged the cannon, and he will
not be hit by pieces of exploding barrel.  Such a cannon would look like this:

             __________________ fuse hole

      |_______________________________________________________________|
      |endplug|powder|t.p.| CO2 cartridge
      | ______|______|____|____________________________________________
      |_|______________________________________________________________|

     An exploding projectile can be made for this type of cannon with a CO2
cartridge. It is relatively simple to do. Just make a crater maker, and
construct it such that the fuse projects about an inch from the end of the
cartridge. Then, wrap the fuse with duct tape, covering it entirely, except
for a small amount at the end. Put this in the pipe cannon without using a
tissue paper packing wad.
                                         ___
 When the cannon is fired, it           (   )
will ignite the end of the              |C  |
fuse, and shoot the CO2                 |  M|
cartridge. The                          |   |
explosive-filled cartridge              |   |
will explode in about three             \  /

6.22     ROCKET FIRING CANNON

           ___          A rocket firing cannon can be made exactly like a
          /   \    normal cannon; the only difference is the ammunition. A
          |   |    rocket fired from a cannon will fly further than a rocket
          | C |    alone, since the action of shooting it overcomes the
          | M |    initial inertia. A rocket that is launched when it is
          |   |    moving will go further than one that is launched when it
          |   |    is stationary. Such a rocket would resemble a normal
          |___|    rocket bomb, except it would have no fins. It would look
          | E |    like the image to the left.
          | N |
          | G |         the fuse on such a device would, obviously, be short,
          | I |    but it would not be ignited until the rocket's ejection
          | N |    charge exploded.  Thus, the delay before the ejection
          | E |    charge, in effect, becomes the delay before the bomb
          |___|    explodes. Note that no fuse need be put in the rocket; the
                   burning powder in the cannon will ignite it, and
                   simultaneously push the rocket out of the cannon at a high
                   velocity.


7.0     PYROTECHNICA ERRATA

     There are many other types of pyrotechnics that a perpetrator of violence
might employ. Smoke bombs can be purchased in magic stores, and large military
smoke bombs can be bought through ads in gun and military magazines. Also,
fireworks can also be used as weapons of terror. A large aerial display rocket
would cause many injuries if it were to be fired so that it landed on the
ground near a crowd of people. Even the "harmless" pull-string fireworks,
which consists of a sort of firecracker that explodes when the strings running
through it are pulled, could be placed inside a large charge of a sensitive
high explosive. Tear gas is another material that might well be useful to the
sociopath, and such a material could be instantly disseminated over a large
crowd by means of a rocket-bomb, with nasty effects.


7.1     SMOKE BOMBS

     One type of pyrotechnic device that might be employed by a terrorist in
many way would be a smoke bomb.  Such a device could conceal the getaway
route, or cause a diversion, or simply provide cover.  Such a device, were it
to produce enough smoke that smelled bad enough, could force the evacuation of
a building, for example.  Smoke bombs are not difficult to make.  Although the
military smoke bombs employ powdered white phosphorus or titanium compounds,
such materials are usually unavailable to even the most well-equipped
terrorist. Instead, he/she would have to make the smoke bomb for themselves.

     Most homemade smoke bombs usually employ some type of base powder, such as
black powder or pyrodex, to support combustion.  The base material will burn
well, and provide heat to cause the other materials in the device to burn, but
not completely or cleanly.  Table sugar, mixed with sulfur and a base material,
produces large amounts of smoke.  Sawdust, especially if it has a small amount
of oil in it, and a base powder works well also.  Other excellent smoke
ingredients are small pieces of rubber, finely ground plastics, and many
chemical mixtures.  The material in road flares can be mixed with sugar and
sulfur and a base powder produces much smoke.  Most of the fuel-oxodizer
mixtures, if the ratio is not correct, produce much smoke when added to a base
powder.  The list of possibilities goes on and on.  The trick to a successful
smoke bomb also lies in the container used.  A plastic cylinder works well, and
contributes to the smoke produced.  The hole in the smoke bomb where the fuse
enters must be large enough to allow the material to burn without causing an
explosion.  This is another plus for plastic containers, since they will melt
and burn when the smoke material ignites, producing an opening large enough to
prevent an explosion.

7.2     COLORED FLAMES

     Colored flames can often be used as a signaling device for terrorists. by
putting a ball of colored flame material in a rocket; the rocket, when the
ejection charge fires, will send out a burning colored ball.  The materials that

7.3     TEAR GAS

     A terrorist who could make tear gas or some similar compound could use it
with ease against a large number of people.  Tear gas is fairly complicated to
make, however, and this prevents such individuals from being able to utilize
its great potential for harm.  One method for its preparation is shown below.



     EQUIPMENT FOR MAKING TEAR GAS
     _________

     1.  ring stands (2)             7.  clamp holder
     2.  alcohol burner              8.  condenser
     3.  erlenmeyer flask, 300 ml    9.  rubber tubing
     4.  clamps (2)                  10.  collecting flask
     5.  rubber stopper              11.  air trap
     6.  glass tubing                12.  beaker, 300 ml

     MATERIALS
     _________

     10 gms  glycerine   2 gms sodium bisulfate    distilled water

1.)  In an open area, wearing a gas mask, mix 10 gms of glycerine with 2 gms
of sodium bisulfate in the 300 ml erlenmeyer flask.

2.)  Light the alcohol burner, and gently heat the flask.

3.)  The mixture will begin to bubble and froth; these bubbles are tear gas.

4.)  When the mixture being heated ceases to froth and generate gas, or a
   brown residue becomes visible in the tube, the reaction is complete.
   Remove the heat source, and dispose of the heated mixture, as it is
   corrosive.

5.)  The material that condenses in the condenser and drips into the collecting  
   flask is tear gas.  It must be capped tightly, and stored in a safe place.


7.4     FIREWORKS

     While fireworks cannot really be used as an effective means of terror,
they do have some value as distractions or incendiaries.  There are several
basic types of fireworks that can be made in the home, whether for fun,
profit, or nasty uses.

7.41     FIRECRACKERS

     A simple firecracker can be made from cardboard tubing and epoxy. The
instructions are below:

     1) Cut a small piece of cardboard tubing from the tube you are using.
 "Small" means anything less than 4 times the diameter of the tube.

     2) Set the section of tubing down on a piece of wax paper, and fill it
with epoxy and the drying agent to a height of 3/4 the diameter  of the
tubing.  Allow the epoxy to dry to maximum hardness, as specified on the
package.

     3) When it is dry, put a small hole in the middle of the tube, and        
insert a desired length of fuse.

     4) Fill the tube with any type of flame-sensitive explosive.  Flash
powder, pyrodex, black powder, potassium picrate, lead azide, nitrocellulose,
or any of the fast burning fuel-oxodizer mixtures will do nicely.  Fill the
tube almost to the top.

     5) Pack the explosive tightly in the tube with a wad of tissue paper and
a pencil or other suitable ramrod.  Be sure to leave enough space for more
epoxy.

     6) Fill the remainder of the tube with the epoxy and hardener, and allow    
     it to dry.

     7) For those who wish to make spectacular firecrackers, always use flash
powder, mixed with a small amount of other material for colors. By crushing
the material on a sparkler, and adding it to the flash powder, the explosion
will be the same color as the sparkler.   By adding small chunks of sparkler
material, the device will throw out colored burning sparks, of the same color
as the sparkler.  By adding powdered iron, orange sparks will be produced.
White sparks can be produced from magnesium shavings, or from small, LIGHTLY
crumpled balls of aluminum foil.

        Example:  Suppose I wish to make a firecracker that will explode         
      with a red flash, and throw out white sparks.

        First, I would take a road flare, and finely powder the material
inside it.   Or, I could take a red sparkler, and finely powder it.
    Then, I would mix a small amount of this material with the flash powder.
(NOTE: FLASH POWDER MAY REACT WITH SOME MATERIALS THAT IT IS MIXED WITH, AND
EXPLODE SPONTANEOUSLY!)  I would mix it in a ratio of 9 parts flash powder to
1 part of flare or sparkler material, and add about 15 small balls of aluminum
foil I would store the material in a plastic bag overnight outside of the
house, to make sure that the stuff doesn't react. Then, in the morning, I
would test a small amount of it, and if it was satisfactory, I would put it in
the firecracker.

     8) If this type of firecracker is mounted on a rocket engine,        
professional to semi-professional displays can be produced.


7.42     SKYROCKETS

     An impressive home made skyrocket can easily be made in the home from
model rocket engines.  Estes engines are recommended.

     1) Buy an Estes Model Rocket Engine of the desired size, remembering that
the power doubles with each letter.  (See sect. 6.1 for details)

     2) Either buy a section of body tube for model rockets that exactly fits
the engine, or make a tube from several thicknesses of paper and glue.

     3) Scrape out the clay backing on the back of the engine, so that the
powder is exposed.  Glue the tube to the engine, so that the tube covers at
least half the engine.  Pour a small charge of flash powder in the tube, about
1/2 an inch.

     4) By adding materials as detailed in the section on firecrackers,        
various types of effects can be produced.

     5) By putting Jumping Jacks or bottle rockets without the stick
in the tube, spectacular displays with moving fireballs or M.R.V.'s can be
produced.

     6) Finally, by mounting many home made firecrackers on the tube with        
the fuses in the tube, multiple colored bursts can be made.


7.43     ROMAN CANDLES

     Roman candles are impressive to watch.  They are relatively difficult to
make, compared to the other types of home-made fireworks, but they are well
worth the trouble.

     1) Buy a 1/2 inch thick model rocket body tube, and reinforce it with
several layers of paper and/or masking tape.  This must be done to prevent the
tube from exploding.  Cut the tube into about 10 inch lengths.

     2) Put the tube on a sheet of wax paper, and seal one end with epoxy        
and the drying agent.  About 1/2 of an inch is sufficient.

     3) Put a hole in the tube just above the bottom layer of epoxy, and
      insert a desired length of water proof fuse.  Make sure that the fuse
      fits tightly.

     4) Pour about 1 inch of pyrodex or gunpowder down the open end of the       
 tube.

     5) Make a ball by powdering about two 6 inch sparklers of the desired
 color.  Mix this powder with a small amount of flash powder and a small
 amount of pyrodex, to have a final ratio (by volume) of 60% sparkler material
 / 20% flash powder / 20% pyrodex.  After mixing the powders well, add water,
 one drop at a time, and mixing continuously, until a damp paste is formed.
      This paste should be moldable by hand, and should retain its shape when
left alone. Make a ball out of the paste that just fits into the tube. Allow
the ball to dry.

     6) When it is dry, drop the ball down the tube.  It should slide down       
 fairly easily.  Put a small wad of tissue paper in the tube, and pack         
it gently against the ball with a pencil.

     7) When ready to use, put the candle in a hole in the ground, pointed in
 a safe direction, light the fuse, and run.  If the device works, a colored
 fireball should shoot out of the tube to a height of about 30 feet.  This
 height can be increased by adding a slightly larger powder charge in step 4,
 or by using a slightly longer tube.

     8) If the ball does not ignite, add slightly more pyrodex in step 5.

     9) The balls made for roman candles also function very well in rockets,     
   producing an effect of falling colored fireballs.

     Most, if not all, of the information in this publication can be obtained
through a public or university library.  There are also many publications that
are put out by people who want to make money by telling other people how to
make explosives at home.  Adds for such appear frequently in paramilitary
magazines and newspapers.  This list is presented to show the large number of
places that information and materials can be purchased from.   It also
includes fireworks companies and the like.

9.0     CHECKLIST FOR RAIDS ON LABS

     In the end, the serious terrorist would probably realize that if he/she
wishes to make a truly useful explosive, he or she will have to steal the
chemicals to make the explosive from a lab.  A list of such chemicals in order
of priority would probably resemble the following:

     LIQUIDS                    SOLIDS
     _______                    ______

     ____     Nitric Acid        ____    Potassium Perchlorate

10.0     USEFUL PYROCHEMISTRY

     In general, it is possible to make many chemicals from just a few basic
ones.  A list of useful chemical reactions is presented.  It assumes knowledge
of general chemistry; any individual who does not understand the following
reactions would merely have to read the first five chapters of a high school
chemistry book.


1.  potassium perchlorate from perchloric acid and potassium hydroxide     
K(OH)       +     HClO     ---->     KClO     +    H O
    4                                    4          2

2.  potassium nitrate from nitric acid and potassium hydroxide
    "       +   HNO     ---->     KNO     +     "
                   3                 3

3.  ammonium perchlorate from perchloric acid and ammonium hydroxide
      NH OH     +     HClO     ---->     NH ClO     +     "
        3                 4                3   4
4.  ammonium nitrate from nitric acid and ammonium hydroxide
        NH OH   +     HNO     ---->     NH NO     +     "
          3             3                 3  3

5.  powdered aluminum from acids, aluminum foil, and magnesium

A.     aluminum foil    +    6HCl    ---->   2AlCl   +   3H                      
                                                3          2

B.     2AlCl  (aq)   +    3Mg    ---->  3MgCl (aq)   +  2Al
            3                                2

     The Al will be a very fine silvery powder at the bottom of the container
which must be filtered and dried. This same method works with nitric and
sulfuric acids, but these acids are too valuable in the production of high
explosives to use for such a purpose, unless they are available in great
excess.

11.0     ABOUT THE AUTHOR

     The author, who wishes his name to be unknown, is presently attending a
college in the United States of America, majoring in Engineering.  He was
raised by his parents on the East Coast, and received his high school
education there. He first became interested in pyrotechnics when he was about
eight years of age. At age twelve, he produced his first explosive device; it
was slightly more powerful than a large firecracker.  He continued to produce
explosive devices for several years.  He also became interested in model
rocketry, and has built several rockets from kits, and designed his own
rockets.
  While in high school, the author became affiliated with CHAOS, and
eventually became the head of Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies.  At this time, at
age 18, he produced his first high explosive device, putting a 1 foot deep
crater in an associate's back yard. He had also produced many types of
rockets, explosive ammunition, and other pyrotechnic devices.
  While he was heading Gunzenbomz Pyro-Technologies, he was injured when a
home made device exploded in his hand; he did not make the device.  The author
learned, however, and  then decided to reform, and although he still
constructs an occasional explosive device, he chooses to abstain from their
production.
  An occasional rocket that produces effects similar to that of professional
displays can sometimes be seen in the midnight sky near his college, and the
Fourth of July is still his favorite day of the year.

               Pax et Discordia,

Addendum 4/12/91 by kadokev@iitvax.iit.edu


END OF PART 1 OF THE COMPLEAT TERRORIST

PART 2 - Tennis ball cannons 
------   Information from the Usenet.  The Usenet is a worldwide network of      
         15,000 machines and over 500,000 people- And growing!

         Addendum by David Richards:
         The POINT BBS at (312) 338-0632 offers free access to several usenet
         message areas.

         Addendum by The Editor:   If you aren't in the Chicago area,
         check a local BBS list.  If you see a BBS which runs under UNIX,
         odds are it carries usenet.  The appropriate place to look is 
         rec.pyrotechnics.


At this time (twelve years ago) most soft drink cans were rolled tin rather
than the molded aluminum.  We would cut the tops and bottoms off of a  bunch
of them and tape them together with duct tape, forming a tube  of two feet or
more.
        At the end we would tape a can with the bottom  intact, more holes
punched (with a can opener) around the top, and a  small hole in the side at
the base. We then fastened this contraption to a tripod so we could aim it
reliably. Any object that came somewhat close to filling the tube was then
placed therein.

        In the shop, we used the clock as a target and an empty plastic
solder spool as ammunition, with tape over the ends of the center hole and
sometimes filled with washers for weight.  When taken to parties or picnics,
we would use whatever was handy.  Hot dog rolls or napkins filled with  potato
chips provided spectacular entertainment.
 
        Once loaded, a small amount of lighter fluid was poured into the hole
in  the side of the end can and allowed to vaporize for a few moments.  The
"fire control technician" would announce "Fire in the Hole" and ignite  it.
 
BOOM!  Whoosh!  The clock never worked after that! 
---------- 
    Our version of the potatoe chip cannon, was built similarly.  Ours used
coke cans, six with the top and bottom removed, and the  seventh had church
key holes all around one end.  This was spiral  wrapped with at least two
rolls of duct tape.
     A wooden shoulder rest  and forward hand grip was taped to the tube.  For
ignition we used  lantern batteries to a model-t coil, actuated by a push
button on  the hand grip.  A fresh wilson tennis ball was stuffed all the way
back to the grid, and a drop or two of lighter fluid was dropped in  one of
two holes in the end.  The ignition wire was poked through  the other hole.
 
    We would then lie in ambush, waiting for somthing to move.  When fired
with the proper air/fuel mixture, a satisfying thoomp!  At maximum range  the
ball would travel about 100 yards with a 45 degree launch angle.  Closer up
the ball would leave a welt on an warring opponent.  When  launched at a
moving car the thud as it hit the door would generally  rattle anyone inside.
Luckily we never completed the one that shot golf balls.


PART 3 - Fun with dry ice.  LOTS of fun with dry ice.  Also from the Usenet.

from _FM 10-0: TRICKS, AWFUL_  (includes material from rec.humor):

DRY ICE

Time Bombs:

1.  Get a small plastic container with lid (we used the small plastic  cans
that hold the coaters used for large-format Polaroid film). A  film canister
would probably work; the key is, it should seal tightly  and take a fair
amount of effort to open).

Place a chunk of dry ice in the can, put on the lid without quite  sealing it.
Put the assembled bomb in your pocket, or behind your  back.

Approach the mark and engage in normal conversation. When his  attention is
drawn away, quickly seal the lid on the bomb, deposit it  somewhere within a
few feet of the mark, out of obvious sight, then  leave.

Depending on variables (you'll want to experiment first), you'll hear  a loud
"pop" and an even louder "Aarrggghhh!" within a minute, when  the CO2 pressure
becomes sufficient to blow off the lid.

In a cluttered lab, this is doubly nasty because the mark will  proabably
never figure out what made the noise.

2.  Put 2-3 inches of water in a 2-liter plastic pop bottle.  Put in  as many
chunks of dry ice as possible before the smoke gets too thick.  Screw on the
cap, place in an appropriate area, and run like hell.  After about a minute
(your mileage may vary), a huge explosion will  result, spraying water
everywhere, along with what's left of the 2-liter bottle.

More things to do with Dry Ice:
     "I put it in my teacher's coffee. (Holy sh-t, the place is on fire!)"
"Throw it in toilets.  (Creature from the Brown Lagoon)"
      "Make soda from ordinary juice, etc."
   "Blow up balloons and condoms with it  (Put a chunk in a balloon, tie  up
the end.)"

     "Fun stuff. It SCREAMS when it comes into contact with metal..." "You can
safely hold a small piece of dry ice in your mouth if you  KEEP IT MOVING
CONSTANTLY. It looks like you're smoking or on fire." Fluorescein (the stuff
in navy-surplus sea dye markers) is  effective in swimming pools.  Or try a
"Baby Ruth" candy bar...


PART 4
                    More Fun Stuff for Terrorists

                             Carbide Bomb

This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution.... Obtain some calcium
carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide lamps and can be found at
nearly any hardware store.
    Take a few pieces of this stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a
glass jar with some water. Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will react with
the water to produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in
cutting torches.
    Eventually the glass with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a
burning rag nearby, you will get a nice fireball!

                      Portable Grenade Launcher

If you have a bow, this one is for you. Remove the ferrule from an aluminum
arrow, and fill the arrow with black powder (I use grade FFFF, it burns
easy)and then glue a shotshell primer into the hole left where the ferrule
went. Next, glue a BB on the primer, and you are ready to go! Make sure no one
is nearby.... Little shreds of aluminim go all over the place!!

                      Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower

For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a switch.
Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tailpipeby
drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily. Attach the wire (this is
regular insulated wire) to one side of the switch and to the spark plug. The
other side of the switch is attached to the positive terminal on the battery.
With the car running, simply hit the switch and watch the flames fly!!! Again be
careful that no one is behind you! I have seen some of these flames go 20
feet!!!

PART 5- This is all various files I gleaned from BBS's.  (Added 8-23-90)
  
       This works best if you happen to have a lot of derelict  friends, as I
do... Your first day of school you should bring  the following items, to
insure a prosperous school year:
 
   1) Fountain pen (and extra ink refills) 
   2) 3 tubes of Super Glue (Krazy Glue) 
   3) Pennies (about $1.00 worth) 
   4) Balloons (small sized for convenience) 
   5) Mirror (small hand held) 
   6) Liquid soap 
   7) Lighter, (matches as alternate) 
   8) Firecrackers (ladyfingers are great) 
   9) Screwdrivers and other tools (small) 
  10) Small squeezable bottles (like nasal de-congestant type)
  11) Wire (10-20 ft)
  12) Tape recorder mic. (batter operated pref.) 
  13) Ziplock baggies 
  14) Half of an orange 
  15) Light bulb (75 watts and over are great) 
 
       This will do for now... Some of the cool things to do are, take the
pennies and glue them to the cafeteria tables, (and watch the custodians  try
to get 'em off). (this also looks good with silver dollars glued to the  fire
alarm (so it goes off when the custodian attempts to remove the coin)  and to
a door someplace... (principals preferably)

       Another thing to do with a coin is, heat it up over a bunsen burner (in
chem) and just as the bell rings, toss the coin into the hall, I will
guarantee you will know when the coin is picked up... While you're using the
bunsen burner, fill your little squeeze bottle with gas, then cap it tight and
put it in your pocket... later, take a firecracker, and glue it  to the
bottle, use a cigarette as a fuse extension, then put it in the  bathroom, and
get to class fast... (gas and glue make a nice flame)...
          While you're in the bathroom, place a light bulb over the door,  and
when the superintendent goes to see what the explosion was, he gets a  nice
little surprise...
       Now for the wire, if you can access a room near your locker, when no
one is in the room, take off the speaker cover on the PA system, and hook 2
wires from it, to your mic. ( then into your locker) This is good for get-ting
your friends out of classes... Just ask for them... (use your tools for that
one, and try to be neat about it)...
 
        Now for your mirror, you can use this for getting your, uh...
"Friend's" locker combination... after you get that, take that little baggie
you got, and put the orange in it... let it sit for a week or four, then open
the baggie, and place it in your friends locker... I can guarantee he/ she
will love it...

        Another thing that is fun to do, is, Take a penny, and glue it over
the key hole on your friends gym locker, just after he goes  out, thus he  has
to truck around all day in his gym stuff, (unless  you rent him your
screwdriver to pry the penny off)
 
        Balloons are fun to play with in chem lab, fill them with the gas
that you get out of the taps on the lab desks, then tie up the  balloon
tight, and drop it out the window to the burnouts below, you  know, the ones
that are always smoking, they love to pop balloons with lit cigarette.... get
the picture? Good...
 
        Those fountain pens are cool, because if you make a slight jerking
motion with your hand, ink squirts all over the room, (or person, whatever
you're aiming at) It is a good idea not to let the teachers know you have  one
of those, it makes it too easy to find out who did it when there's ink  all
over the principals face... (or on the floors, walls, and ceilings...)
   
        Liquid soap is great for use in crowded hallways, it turns every-body
into a ice skating star, (works especially well when people come in  from the
rain)... If your school is anything like the one I go to, people  never flush
the toilets, A little liquid soap in here makes for a nice  surprise, I mean,
what happens when the soap is not flushed out of the  toilet, and the suds
aren't flushed out either? The janitors have a  really good time trying to
figure out that one... (glue a quarter in one of the urinals, always fun)...
Turn off the water under the sinks too. Getting back to the soap, it is also
good on the hand railings in hall-ways and on steps, If you mix perfume with
it, some poor grub has to have  that stench on him all day.

       The Modern Speeders Guide to Radar and State Troopers
        By : Exilic Xyth                     January 11, 1988

         Introduction:

      Touched off by the discussion on Ripco <312>-528-5020, I found many
users asking questions about police radar, radar detectors, and speeding. With
Ron Majors talking about the oil spill that will appear in detail on the news
at ten I thought a informative file on the subject might  be beneficial. I
myself had my first experience with police radar in my  fathers car, then
following in baseball and my own driving, much more on the  subject.  What a
fascinating device, that it will return your speed instantly,  what fun one
would be to have!  After a quick talk with a police friend of  mine, I soon
took possession of a used police radar gun.

         Part one: Operation.

   Police Radar works via the doppler effect, best demonstrated by sound
rather than microwaves.  The doppler effect is the  relation of speed to the
pitch of 'sound'.  Sometime, all of you must have had the distinct pleasure of
being honked at by a motorist on the go,  you might have noticed that the horn
<an F flat on most american cars>  begins with a higher pitch and as the car
passes, drowns off to a lower tone.  The sound waves at the front of the car
are pressed together by the  forward motion of the car, creating a higher
pitch.  As the car passes, the tone dies off to a lower pitch because the
waves are spread out.

 Police radar works in much the same way.  The major differences are the
frequency and the concentration of the carrier.  As of 1988, the F.C.C.  is
rumored to have lifted restrictions on police radar frequencies.  Before, only
two frequencies were approved for police radar use.  X-band <10.525 GHz> which
is most commonly used, and K-band <24.15 Ghz>.  I will assume for now, due to
lack of any SOLID evidence supporting the restriction lift, that those are the
only two in operation.  Police radar 'beams' are similar in shape to a
flashlight beam.  They begin with a thin width and cone outwards with
distance.  Most guns operating at the X-band level have a range of about 2000
ft., although high power units can exceed 2500 and 3000ft., and K-band guns
fall shorter at about 1200 ft..  At 1500ft., the radar beam becomes about the
width of four highway lanes, so for practical purposes radars range is around
1700 ft..

 A radar signal transmitted from the 'Radar Gun's' transmitter, (called the
oscillator) will bounce off a object and return to the radar receiver (or
antenna).  If the object is moving, the frequency of the beam will be altered
as it bounces.  This is most easily visualized watching water ripples.  Assume
now that I have just dropped a pebble in a pond, and the ripples are moving
outward, assume also for purposes of simplicity that the ripples are moving at
1 foot per second, and that they are one foot apart.  The ripples are
therefore also one second apart.  Upon bouncing off a stationary object the
ripples will return weakened, but at the same interval and speed <Not really
the same speed, but let's not complicate things>.

 Now let us assume that a toy boat is traveling in the water at .5 ft.  per
second, 1/2 the speed of the ripples, away from the point which I dropped the
pebble.  Assume the first ripple has hit the boat and is traveling back.  The
second ripple now traveling at 1 foot per second is only gaining on the boat
by .5 feet per second <1 ft.  per second - .5 ft.  per second>.  This means
that the ripple is one foot away from the boat, as the ripples are one foot
apart. The ripple will take 2 second to reach the boat, as the closure speed
is .5 ft.  per second and the distance is 1 foot.  The ripple strikes the boat
and bounces back two seconds after the first ripple.  The process works
inversely for an object moving towards the pebbles point of impact.

 As the distance between the ripples can be determined by the speed, on the
other side, the speed can be determined by the distance between the ripples.
Police radar works in the same way with microwaves.  The microwave signal
bounces off a moving vehicle and returns altered in frequency.  In this way
the radar unit determines the speed of the object.

 Radar is only accurate when the object is moving directly at, or directly
away from the gun, although some modern guns will account for this 'COSINE
error', most won't.  Cosine error can be defined as this: When a radar signal
bounces off an object at an angle from the objects direction of travel it will
return a portion of the objects speed computed by the cosine of the infraction
angle.  If the angle of the objects direction and the radars direction is 20
degrees the speed returned by the radar is 93.97% of the objects actual speed.
cos (20) = .93969262 * objects speed = returned speed.

 For example: A car is traveling at 75 m.p.h..  The state trooper, in his
infinite wisdom, decides to "Clock" the automobile in hopes of meeting his
quota for the month.  Picking up his handy radar gun, he aims, and fires an
invisible beam of microwave energy.  The officer however, being the rookie he
is, leaves a high angle between the cars direction and his beam of 45 degrees.
Cos (45) = .707106781 .707106781 * 75m.p.h.  = 53.03300859 53 m.p.h. is
displayed on the officers screen.  Lucky motorist.  Sorry 40 column users.

   Part 2: Application

     In 1986, over 15 million speeding tickets were issued, and experts
estimate that over 25% of them were in error.  Police have been using radar
for speed control for many years, and as the technology has become more
complex and accurate, so has the ability to get away with the slight
infractions of the speed limits set by the government become more difficult.
In recent years, the three most damaging advances to motorists in radar
technology include:

     A> Instant on radar.
     B> K-band radar.
 and C> Cosine error correcting radar units.

     Instant on radar.
        With the increase of radar receivers, or "Detectors" on the roads,
police have attempted to bypass the motorists first line of defense.  The most
damaging advance in the war against speeding motorists is instant on radar.
The idea behind instant on radar is to make the radar detector useless to the
motorist by making his warning too late to react to.  Instant on radar was
developed in early 1983, but never marketed until late 1984 when the michigan
state troopers were equipped with the first instant on radar guns.  It
operates by deactivating the oscillator until triggered by the officer.  When
used properly and under the right traffic conditions, it is indefensible.  It
works like a camera, the officer operating the radar will position himself
behind a blind corner or over a hill.  When the approaching car crests the
hill or rounds the corner, the officer will activate the oscillator, taking a
"snapshot" of your car.  As microwaves travel at the speed of light, any
attempt at slowing down is futile, the officer behind the gun has your speed
in less than a tenth of a second.

     K-band Radar.
        When radar detectors were first marketed by the markers of ESCORT,
there was only one type of radar.  X-band.  In an attempt to increase the
dwindling speeding ticket revenue, K-band was brought to life.  K- band is a
different frequency that could not be picked up by the primitive detectors of
the age.  However, as the frequency got out, the detectors adapted, and now
any detector worth a dollar will detect both X and K bands.  K band is more
dangerous as most K-band guns are instant on and they have less 'Splash' and
range than X-band guns.  This means that a K-band signal is probably closer to
you.

     Cosine error correcting guns.

        Cosine error was a major falling of radar in the judicial system, all
readings were under question in court, the result was a gun which will correct
for cosine error by determining the angle which the radar beam "impacts" with
the car.  Also new in correcting cosine error were guns with 'Speed lock on'
in which the highest speed reading received by the gun is locked in and
displayed.

     Moving radar guns.

        Until new developments, all radar units had to remain stationary as
radar measures only closure speed, and not actual speed. Moving radar ended
this trend.  Moving radar works like this.  First the radar gun determines the
patrol cars speed by clocking a sign or fixed object.  The closing speed of
the patrol car to the sign is subtracted from the now taken closing speed to
the target car.

        Patrols speed - 60 m.p.h.
        Closing speed to car - 120 m.p.h.
   120 m.p.h.  - 60 m.p.h.  = 60 m.p.h..


   Part 3: Defense
     From the dawn of speed enforcement, motorists have sought to defeat the
laws, starting with detectors, continuing to jammers and topping out with the
new 'CHiPs detectors' The unfortunate conditions now favor the police and law
enforcement officials with the introduction of new radar technologies such as
instant on radar.

     Detectors:

       The simple radar receiver is the first line of defense
from radar.  Varied in operation and features, the radar detectors of today are
designed to provide high sensitivity and low rates of false alarms.  Good
detectors will measure signal strength and type <K or X> and have an effective
range of about 3000 ft.  and a probable range of well over a mile.  Sensitivity
tops out around 110.5 dBm/cm^2 for X band and 108 dBm/cm^2 for K band <Both set
by the passport>.  A detector can give you an excellent advantage over radar by
alerting you it's there.  Detectors become especially useful in chicago where
instant on radar is not typically used.

     Jammers:
        Radar jammers are essentially units that transmit microwaves at a
frequency dictating a certain speed.  The result is regardless of your speed,
the police radar unit will display the speed you set the jammer to transmit.
Jammers are highly illegal and will be confiscated if discovered, expect a
stiff fine.

     Chip's detector.

        This is a new device, which is really a scanner on the police radio
band.  It takes advantage of a signal transmitted by the patrol cars in some
states as part of their dispatch system.  The signal carries for about three
miles, and the Chip's Detector will alert you if you are within that range of
a highway patrol unit.  It also allows scanning of police radio channels.

   Last words.

     Radar is a basically accurate instrument, when used properly, it can be
deadly.  As I have said before instant on radar is impossible to avoid when
there is no other traffic around, regardless of a detector.  The only thing
that comes close is a Radar Jammer, which will most likely not serve you well
unless it is WELL hidden.  Radar jammers are dangerous with the introduction
of the HAWK, a radar unit by Kustom Signals, which DETECTS radar jammers in
the hold mode.

     Aside from radar, VASCAR <Visual average speed computer and recorder> is
     a new danger to motorists.  It is basically a stopwatch used to time your
     movement between two point of which the interval distance is known.
     Using the formula Average velocity = distance / time, the state trooper
     can determine your speed without setting off your detector.

          Instant on radar defense.

        The only real defense for instant on radar is traffic.  Traffic will
cause the trooper to activate his radar gun more often, cluing you into his
presence.  A jammer well hidden will help, but the best technique is to follow
a car making good time.  Any police units in the area will clock him first,
and legally they have to ticket him, unless you're too close.

Remember: 
 Do not speed, it is a dangerous practice, and I can not be responsible for
any injury, or action due to this file, it is for informational  purposes
only.  The state troopers enforce speed limits for your  safety.

     Radar guns: Models.

        Radar guns are manufactured by many different companies, but the
primary ones are Kustom Signals, M.p.h.  Industries, and Decatur. The
deadliest gun now available is the HAWK manufactured by Kustom Signals.  It is
the first gun capable of clocking cars moving the SAME direction as the patrol
car.  It has two antennas, one forward, and one back.  Like I stated before,
it is also the first gun capable of detecting radar jammers.  These run about
$~2000

        Kr-11
        This gun is a two piece model which uses a weak pulse signal in the
moving mode to determine the patrol car's speed while not triggering
detectors.  This gun permits a faster clocking time for instant on moving
radar, it runs about $~1200

        Falcon
        This is a hand held gun operating on K band Small and compact it is
preferred among law enforcement radars.  It runs about 600$

        Hr-4 Hr-8 Hr-12
        400,500,750$ respectively, these are hand held radar guns made by
Kustom Signals

        All these units are available to you via me for less than the troopers
pay for them.  For prices, and statistics, call my board at (312) - 787 - 2174
or send me mail at Ripco (312) 528-5020

        Prices for radar units range from 250-2000$
     I personally enjoy harassing that 911 who barrels by at 95 with a
  detector.

   Picking combo locks:

    Ok, so ya say ya wanna learn how to pick combination locks...This text
file should help you.  As a matter of fact, if ya do it right, it will help
you.
    First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock.  When the lock
is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch on
the horseshoe shaped bar that is pushed in to the lock when you lock it.
     To free this wedge, you usually have to turn the lock to the desired
combination and the pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting the
lock open.  I will now tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock
without having to waste all that time turning the combination (this also helps
when ya don't know the combination to begin with).
      First of all, ya need to find a hairpin.  What's a hairpin? Well, just
ask your mom.  She will have one.  If she asks what its for, say ya gotta hold
something together...  If she says use a rubberband or use a paperclip,
 go to the store and rip off a box of 50 or so.
    Once you have your hair pin (make sure it's metal), take the ridged side
and break it off right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight
side.  The curved part t can now be used as a handle. Now, using a file, file
down the other end until it is fairly thin.  You should do this to many
hairpins and file them so they are of different thicknesses so you can pick
various locks.  Some locks are so cheap that ya don't even have ta file! But
most are not.
  Ok, now you have a lock pick.  Now if ya haven't figured it out, here's how
ya use it.  You look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.  If you
can't tell, you will just have to try both sides.  When ya find out what side
it opens from, , take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of
the horseshoe-shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.
     Now, put pressure on the handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the
crack) and pull the lock up and down.  The lock will then open because the
pick separated the wedge and the notch allowing us thieves to open it.  Don't
say bullshit until you've tried it.  Because I have gotten lots of beer money
from doin' this to fellow students' gym lockers.
  Also, this technique works best on American locks.  I have never picked a
Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge but if anyone
does it, let me know how long it took. Also, the Master lock casing is very
tight so ya can't get the pick in.  So, if you're locking something valuable
up, use a Master, cuz at least ya know I won't be picking it and I'm sure
there aren't that many that could.  And when I say pick, i don't mean lighting
a stick of dynamite next to the lock, picking is opening a lock without  using
force, making a substitute key, etc...
    If any of you believe that this information is not sufficient for picking
an American lock, or any other kind besides Master, leave me a message at
/\/\etallant 1 (503) 538-0761.   This concludes my text file on picking
combination locks. My next text file will probably be "Picking key locks".
See ya later, The Byte basher.

      How to pick MASTER locks  By Gin Fizz & Ninja NYC
 
    Have you ever tried to impress your friends by picking one of those Master
combination locks and failed? Well then read on.  The Master lock company has
made this kind of lock with a protection scheme.  If you pull the handle of it
hard, the knob won't turn.  That was their biggest mistake......  Ok, now on
to it.
 
    1st number.  Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on.
1: The handle part (the part that springs open when you get the combination),
pull on it, but not enough so that the knob won't move.  2: While pulling on
it turn the knob to the left until it won't move any more.  Then add 5 to this
number.  Congradulations, you now have the 1st number.
 
    2nd number.  (a lot tougher) Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times,
then go to the 1st number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the
1st number once.  WHEN you have bypassed.  Start pulling the handle and
turning it. It will eventually fall into the groove and lock.  While in the
groove pull on it and turn the knob.  If it is loose go to the next groove; if
it's stiff you got the second number.
 
    3rd number: After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2
numbers, then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull on
it.  The lock will eventually open if you did it right.  If can't do it the
first time, be patient, it takes time.
 
Addendum 4/12/91:  I've tried this, and it no longer seems to work (master 
wised up)

HOWEVER- the "MASTER warded padlock" locks are easily picked...

These are the lock with the keys that look like this:

   _                                                       _
  / \_[]_[]__[]_[]    A cross section looks like this:  \_/ \
  \_/ [] []  [] []

Just file the key down so it looks like this:

   _                                                       _
  / \___________[]    A cross section looks like this:  ~~~~~
  \_/           []

Now you can bypass the wards... sometimes you have to pull the key up and
down, turning as you pass each block, to release the latch.

   PYROTECHNICAL DELIGHTS
                               WRITTEN BY RAGNER ROCKER

  Many of you out there probably have fantasies of revenge against teachers,
principals and other people who are justassholes.  depending on your level of
hatred of this person i would advise that you do some of these following
experiments:

  (1) Pouring dishsoap into the gas tank of your enemy- many of you already
know that gasoline + dishsoap(e.g.  joy, palmolive, etc.) form a mixture
called napalm.  now napalm is a jelly-like  substance used in bombs,
flamethrowers, etc.  now you can only guess what this mixture would do to
someone's fuel line!!!!

  (2) Spreading dirty motor oil/castor oil on someone's exhaust pipe- when
the exhaust pipe heats up(and it will!!)the motor oil or castor oil on the pipe
will cause thick, disgusting smoke to ooze forth from the back of that car.
Who knows maybe he/she might be pulled over and given a ticket!!

  (3) Light Bulb Bomb- see part one of the file

 (4) Simple smoke/stink bomb- you can purchaase sulphur at a drugstore under
the name flowers of sulphur.  now when sulphur burns it will give off a very
strong odor and plenty of smoke.  now all you need is a fuse from a
firecracker, a tin can, and the sulphur.  fill the can with sulphur(pack very
lightly), put aluninum foil over the top of the can, poke a small hole into
the foil, insert the wick, and light it and get out of the room if you value
your lungs.  you can find many uses for this( or at least i hope so.
 
                 FUN WITH ALARMS
 
A fact I forgot to mention in my previous alarm articles is that one can also
use polyurethane foam in a can to silence horns and bells.  you can purchase
this at any hardware store as insulation.  it is easier to handle and dries
faster.

Many people that travel carry a pocket alarm with them.  this alarm is a small
device that is hung around the door knob, and when someone touches the knob his
body capacitance sets off the alarm.  these nasty nuisences can be found by
walking down the halls of a hotel and touching all the door knobs very quickly.
if you happen to chance upon one, attach a 3' length of wire or other metal
object to the knob.  this will cause the sleeping business pig inside to think
someone is breaking in and call room service for help.  all sorts of fun and
games will ensue.


    Some high-security instalations use keypads just like touch-tone pads (a
registered trade mark of bell systems) to open locks or disarm alarms.  most
use three or four digits.  to figure out the code, wipe the key-pad free from
all fingerprints.  after it had been used just apply finger print dust and all
four digits will be marked.  now all you have to do is figure out the order.
if you want to have some fun with a keypad, try pressing the * and # at the
same time.  many units use this as a panic button. This will bring the owner
and the cops running and ever-one will have a good time.  never try to remove
them from the wall, as they all have tamper switches.
 
    On the subject of holdups, most places (including super-markets, liquer
stores, etc.) have what is known as a money clip.  these little nasties are
placed at the bottom of a money drawer and when the last few bills are
with-drawn a switch closes and sets the alarm off.  that's why when you make
your withdrawl it's best to help your-self so you can check for these little
nasties.  if you find them, merely insert ones underneath the pile of
twenties, and then pull out the twen-ties, leaving the one-dollar bill behind
to prevent the circuit from closing.

If you shoplift and see cameras, look at the brand.  if it is surveillance video
systems (SVS) you need not worry.  these cameras look realistic to the point of
pilot lights, coax, and scanning.  however, they are only empty boxes.


How to make TNT       By THE SCREAMER
 
       Probably the most important explosive compond in use today is TNT
(trinitrotoluene).  This and other very similar types of high explosives ar
all used by the military, because of their fantastic power- about 2.25
millions pounds per square inch, and there great stability.  TNT also has the
great advantage of being ableto be melted at 82 degrees F., so that it can be
poured into shells, mortars, or any other projectiles.  Military TNT comes in
containers which resemble dryu cell batteries, and are usually ingnited by an
electrical charge, coupled with an electical blasting cap, although there are
other methods.

Preparation of TNT
 
1.  Take two beakers.  In the first prepare a solution of 76 percent sulfuric
acid, 23 percent nitric acid and 1 percent water.  In the other beaker,
prepare another solution of 57 percent nitric acid and 43 percent sulfuric
acid (percentages are on a weig ht ratio rather than volume).
 
2.  Ten grams of the first solutions are poured into an empty beaker and placed
in an ice bath.

3.  Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.
4.  remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until it reaches 50
degrees C.  The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.

5.  Fifty additional grams of the acid, from the first beaker, are added and
the temperature is held for the next ten minutes, and an oily liquid will
begin to form on the top of the acid.

6.  After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath, and
cooled to 45 degrees C. when reaching this temperature, the oily liquid will
sink and collect at the bottom of the beaker.  At this point, the remaining
acid solution should be drawn off, by using a syringe.
 
7.  Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid
while the temperature is SLOWLY being raised to 83 degrees C.  After this
temperature is reached, it is maintaind for a full half hour.

8.  At the end of this period, he solution is allowed to cool to 60 degrees
C>, and is held at this temperature for another full half hour.  After this,
the acid is again drawn off, leaving once more only the oily liquid at the
bottom.

9.  Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently
heated to 80 degrees C.  All temperature increases must be accoumplished
slowly and gently.

10.Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second acid
solution are added, and the temperature is raised from 80 dgregrees C> to 104
degrees C., and is held for three hours.

11.After this three hour period, the mixture is lowered to 100 degrees C.  and
held there for a half hour.

12.After this half hour, the oil is removed form the acid and washed with
boiling water.

13.After the washing with boiling water, while being stired constantly, the
TNT will begin to solidify.

 14.When the solidification has started, cold water is added to the beaker, so
that the TNT will form into pellets.  Once this is done, you have a good
quality TNT. NOTE: the temperatures used in the preparation of TNT are EXACT,
and must be used as such.

  DO NOT estimate or use aproximations.  Buy a good centigrade thermometer.

 El Pirata's Guild On How To Make A Chemical Fire Bottle
 Written for: Toxic Oyster Guild  05/12/85

Materials Required:
==================

    Sulphuric Acid (Battery Acid)                  Gasoline
    Potassium Chlorate (Drug Store)                Sugar
    Glass bottle w/stopper (roughly 1 quart size)  Small bottle or jar w/lid
    Rag or absorbent paper(newspaper,towels, etc.)
    String or rubber bands

Procedure:
=========

1) Sulphuric Acid Must be Concentrated. If battery acid or other dilute acid
is used, concentrate it by boiling until dense white fumes are given off.
Container used should be of eenamelware or oven glass.

CAUTION: Sulphuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is
 spilled, wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also
 dangerous and should not be inhaled.

2) Remove the acid from heat and allow to cool to room temerature.

3) Pour gasoline into the large (1 quart) bottle until it is approximately
2/3 full.

4) Add concentrated sulphuric acid to gasoline slowly until the bottle is
filled to within 1' to 2' from top.  Place the stopper on the bottle.

5) Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

CAUTION: If this is not done, the fire bottle may be dangerous to handle
 during use.

6) Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbent paper around the outside
 of the bottle.  Tie with string or fasten with rubber bands.

7) Dissolve 1/2 cup (100 gm) of potassium chlorate and 1/2 cup (100 gm) of
sugar in one cup (250 cc) of boiling water.

8) Allow the solution to cool, pour into the small bottle and cap tightly. The
cooled solution should be approx.  2/3 crystals and 1/3 liquid.  If  there is
more liquid than this, pour off excess before using.

CAUTION: Store this bottle separately from the other bottle.


                 How To Use:

1) Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth or paper
around the large bottle.  Bottle can be used wet or after solution has dried.
However, when dry, the sugar - Potassium chlorate mixture is very sensitive to
spark or flame and should be handled accordingly.

2) Throw or launch the bottle.  When the bottle breaks against a hard surface
 (target) the fuel will ignite.

Conclusion:
==========
 This weapon proves to be very useful in torching Assholes and/or their
possessions.  Use your imagination.

TIME DELAYED CHEMICAL FUSE
 
1) Put 1 teaspoon full of of potassium permanganate in a tin can.
2) add glycerine
3) wait 3-4 min.
4) get the hell out..  the stuff will smoke, then burst into flame..

** potasium permanganate stains like iodine but worse [it's purple]
** the reaction will spatter a bit ->it can be messy...
** it doesn't matter if the amounts are uneven [ie.  1 part to 3 parts]



                    THERMITE
 
This stuff can burn *anything*.  [except Tungsten]..  It's great for burning
open a fortress fone [a pay phone, for those who do not know]
 
Here is the step-by-step on how to make it.
 
1) First you need rust.  The best way to make alot of it is....
 
  a) get an electric train transformer and attach a common nail to the PLUS
   (+) end of the transformer. take a glass jar and fill it with water, then
   put salt [table salt is fine] into the water. put the other wire into the
   water with the nail [leave the transformer out, of course]. Turn on the
   transformer and let the contraption run overnight. seperate out all the red
   shit [that's the rust] with a filter or a spoon. let the stuff dry [like on
   a paper towel] that's it! you have rust!
 
2) Get some aluminum filings from the hardware store [or shave your own from a
 bar with less that 94% pure aluminum, called duralumin]

3) Now, just mix:
 
   8 grams rust /  3 grams aluminum filings
 
4) That's Thermite!! Now, to ignite it...
 
5) You now need some Magnesium ribbon. To get it, you can:
 
  a) steal it from the chemistry lab at school
  b) buy it at the hardware store or from a chemical supply house.
 
6) Alright, shove the Magesium ribbon into the Thermite at a fuse.
 
7) Then light it with a blowtorch. [It won't get hot enough to ignite the
 Thermite, though]
 
8) last step: get the hell back. [it can vaporize CARBON STEEL!]


 
EXPLOSIVES AND INCENDIARIES by THE RESEARCHER

INTRODUCTION: The trouble with text books on chemistry and explosives is the
attitude with which they are written.  They don't say, "Now I know you would
like to blow holy hell out of something just for the fun of it so here is how
to whip up something in your kitchen to do it".  They tell you how Dupont does
it or how the anchient Chinese did it but not how you can do it with the
resourses and materials available to you.

 Even army manuals on field expedient explosives are almost useless because
they are just outlines written with the understanding that an instructor is
going to fill in the blanks.  It is a fun game to search out the materials
that can be put together to make something go "boom".  You can find what you
need in grocery stores, hardware stores, and farm supplies.  An interesting
point to remember is that it is much easier to make a big e explosion than a
small one.  It is very difficult for a home experimenter to make a
firecracker, but a bomb capable of blowing the walls out of a building is
easy.

   The king of explosives for the do-it-yourselfer is black powder.  It is
easy to make and when properly confined is capable of devestating power.
   It is cheap and works well. Some drug stores sell sulfur under the name
Flowers of Sulfur.  If you use Nitrate of Soda, it will be in the form of
prills (little round beads).  Bake it in an oven at 250 degrees for 10-15
minutes to drive out the moisture.
   Then dump a cup or two into a blender and switch it on.  It will do a
beautiful job of reducing it to powder.  Buy a bag of charcoal briquettes at a
grocery store.  Put a few briquettes in a rag and pound with hammer.  Dump the
result into the blender, grind, then strain through a tea strainer.
   Mix by volume: 6 parts potassium or Sodium Nitrate, 2 parts powdered
charcoal, 1 part sulfur. This mixture will burn if ignited and will explode if
ignited while tightly confined.  It can be greatly improved, however, by
processing it as follows:
    Moisten with water until it will stick together when pinched between thumb
and finger.  Press it into a disposable aluminum pie pan.  Bake in a preheated
oven at 250 degrees for about 30 minutes--get it totally dry.  Grind into as
fine a powder as possible.  A mortar and pestle is best.
    If you use a blender at this point, there is a danger of explosion.  It is
not very sensative to friction or impact, but is very sensative to sparks.  If
you followed these directions, you should have a fine slate-grey powder.
    When baking black powder, remember to preheat the oven.  Place your pie
pan approximately in the center of the oven.  Do not set it on the bottom of
the oven.

  These warnings are to prevent hot spots that could ignite the powder causing
a fire or explosion.  Something went wrong once when my father-in-law was
doing this and it blew the door right off the oven.  His training in military
demolitions included field expedient explosives.  The point is that things can
go wrong even when you know what you are doing.  Protect yourself at all
times.  Use common sense.  Wear safety glasses; don't stand in front of oven,
etc.

                         HOW TO MAKE BLACKMATCH FUSE:
  Take a flat piece of plastic or metal (brass or aluminum are easy to work
with and won't rust).  Drill a 1/16th inch hole through it.  This is your die
for sizing the fuse.  You can make fuses as big as you want, but this is the
right size for the pipe bomb I will be getting to later.

   To about 1/2 cup of black powder add water to make a thin paste.  Add 1/2
teaspoon of corn starch. Cut some one foot lengths of cotton thread.  Use
cotton, not silk or thread made from synthetic fibers.  Put these together
until you have a thickness that fills the hole in the die but can be drawn
through very easily.

  Tie your bundle of threads together at one end. Separate the threads and
hold the bundle over the black powder mixture. Lower the threads with a
circular motion so they start curling onto the mixture.  Press them under with
the back of a teaspoon and continue lowering them so they coil into the paste.
Take the end you are holding and thread it through the die.  Pull it through
smoothly in one long motion.

  To dry your fuse, lay it on a piece of aluminum foil and bake it in your 250
degree oven or tie it to a grill in the oven and let it hang down.  The fuse
must be baked to make it stiff enough for the uses it will be put to later.
Air drying will not do the job.  If you used Sodium Nitrate, it will not even
dry completely at room temperatures.

Cut the dry fuse with sissors into 2 inch lengths and store in an air tight
container.  Handle this fuse carefuly to avoid breaking it.  You can also use
a firecracker fuse if you have any available.  The fuses can usually be pulled
out without breaking.  To give yourself some running time, you will be
extending these fuses (blackmatch or firecracker fuse) with sulfured wick.

                          HOW TO MAKE SULFURED WICK
   Use heavy cotton string about 1/8th inch in diameter.  You can find some at
a garden supply for tieing up your tomatoes.  Be sure it's cotton.  You can
test it by lighting one end.  It sould continue to burn after the match is
removed and when blown out will have a smoldering coal on the end.  Put some
sulfur in a small container like a small pie pan and melt it in the oven at
250 degrees.
    It will melt into a transparent yellow liquid.  If it starts turning
brown, it is too hot.  Coil about a one foot length of string into it.  The
melted sulfur will soak in quickly.  When saturated, pull it out and tie it up
to cool and harden.
  It can be cut to desired lengths with sissors.  2 inches is about right.
These wicks will burn slowly with a blue flame and do not blow out easily in a
moderate wind. They will not burn through a hole in a metal pipe, but are
great for extending your other fuse.  They will not throw off sparks.
Blackmatch generates sparks which can ignite it along its length causing
unpredictable burning times.


    Now you have the basic ingredients to shake the earth like thunder.  In
the next installment or two, I will tell you how to put it all together to do
just that.  You will find that you have baked a very deadly pie.  I have twice
been accused of setting off dynamite in the woods.  The explosive power of
your little grey powder may exceed your expectations, so choose your testing
ground with care.


                           HOW TO MAKE A PIPE BOMB
   Buy a section of metal water pipe 1/2 by 6 inches long, threaded on both
ends.  Buy two metal caps to fit.  These are standard items in hardware
stores.  Drill a 1/16th hole in the center of the pipe. This is easy with a
good drill bit.
    Hanson is a good brand to use.  Screw a metal cap tightly on one end.
Fill the pipe to within 1/2 inch of the top with black powder.  Do not pack
the powder. Don't even tap the bottom of the pipe to make it settle.  You want
the powder loose.  For maximum explosive effect, you need dry, fine powder
sitting loose in a very rigid container.
    Wipe off any powder that has gotten onto the top or threads of the pipe.
Gently screw on the second cap.  Hand tighten only. Place a small piece of
tape over the hole and go to your test site.  Remove the tape and insert a two
inch piece of black match fuse or a firecracker fuse into the hole.  Place the
bomb behind a large rock or tree.
     Using thread or string, lightly tie a 2 inch piece of sulfured wick to
the end of the fuse. Avoid letting the wick touch any objects.  This might
cause it to go out. Light the wick and head for cover in a direction that
keeps the rock or tree between you and the bomb at all times. Get behind cover
at least 50 yards away.  You may not expect such a large explosion from such a
small object.
     Be extra cautious until You have done this a time or two and it gets real
what you are dealing with.  The pipe will be blown to pieces which will fly
through the air like bullets.  An accident could seriously wound or kill you.
This is not a big firecracker.  It is more like a hand grenade.  The size of
the bomb can be increased by using a larger pipe and caps.

    To make a big noise without blowing up your pipe, cap one end only. Drill
a 1/16 hole at the top of the threads at the capped end.  Put in about 3 to 4
rounded teaspoonsful of powder. Pack about 2 inches of wadding on top of the
powder.  Toilet paper or kleenex is good for this.  Pack it tight.  Open up a
safety pin and stick it into the hole.  Work it around to loosen up the powder
so a fuse can be inserted.  When this goes off, the recoil will be tremendous.
You will loose your pipe unless you brace it securely against something.

    The pipe can be reloaded and used again.  A fun trick is to mount the pipe
pointing upward.  Drop a tin can over the open end and light the fuse. The can
will be blown high into the air.  Campbell's soup cans are great for this.



                           HOW TO MAKE ROCKET FUEL

   This is easy to make and fun to play with.  Mix equal parts by volume
Potassium or So dium Nitrate and granulated sugar.  Pour a big spoonful of
this into a pile. Stick a piece of blackmatch fuse into it; light; and step
back.  This is also a very hot incendiary.  A little imagination will suggest
a lot of experiments for this.

                             ANOTHER ROCKET FUEL

 Mix equal parts by volume of zinc dust and sulfur.  Watch out if you
experiment with this.  It goes off in a sudden flash.  It is not a powerful
explosive, but is violent stuff even when not confined because of its fast
burning rate.

  --- As I continue from this point some of the ingredients are going to be
harder to get without going through a chemical supply.  I try to avoid this.
I happen to know that B. Prieser Scientific (local to my area) has been
instructed by the police to send them the names of anyone buying chemicals in
certain combinations.  For example, if a person were to buy Sulfuric acid,
Nitric acid and Toluene (the makings for TNT) in one order the police would be
notified.  I will do the best I can to tell you how to make the things you
need from commonly available materials, but I don't want to leave out
something really good because you might have to scrounge for an ingredient.  I
am guessing you would prefer it that way.

                 HOW TO MAKE AN EXPLOSIVE FROM COMMON MATCHES

 The word "safety" in safety matches is misleading.  The chemical on the heads
of safety matches is a powerful explosive.  It is similar to black powder but
has a lower ignition temperature (more sensative to heat) and unlike black
powder is easily detonated by impact.

  This feature moves it up into the high explosives class. To test this, lay a
paper safety match on a hard flat surface and hit the head sharply with a
hammer.  What do you know! It goes bang! To collect a quantity of this
explosive, it is best to use wooden safety matches.  Buy several cartons.
They're cheap.  Note that these should be safety matches, not the strike
anywhere kind.


  Pinch the head near the bottom with a pair of wire cutters to break it up;
then use the edges of the cutters to scrape off the loose material.  It gets
easy with practice.  You can do this while watching TV and collect enough for
a bomb without dying of boredom.
    Once you have a good batch of it, you can load it into a pipe instead of
black powder.  Be careful not to get any in the threads, and wipe off any that
gets on the end of the pipe.  Never try to use this stuff for rocket fuel.  A
science teacher was killed that way.
      Just for fun while I'm on the subject of matches, did you know that you
can strike a safety match on a window pane? Hold a paper match between your
thumb and first finger.  With your second finger, press the head firmly
against a large window.  Very quickly, rub the match down the pane about 2
feet while maintaining the pressure.  The friction will generate enough heat
to light the match.

  Another fun trick is the match rocket.  Tightly wrap the top half of a paper
match with foil.  Set it in the top of a pop bottle at a 45 degree angle.
Hold a lighted match under the head until it ignites.  If you got it right,
the match will zip up and hit the ceiling.

 I just remembered the match guns I used to make when I was a kid.  These are
made from a bicycle spoke.  At one end of the spoke is a piece that screws
off.  Take it off and screw it on backwards.  You now have a piece of stiff
wire with a small hollow tube on one end.  Pack the material from a couple of
wooden safety matches into the tube.  Force the stem of a match into the hole.
It sould fit very tightly.  Hold a lighted match under the tube until it gets
hot enough to ignite the powder.  It goes off with a bang.

--- For later projects, like a chemical time delay fuse, you will need some
concentrated sulfuric acid.  So, I better tell you how to make it.


           HOW TO MAKE CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID FROM BATTERY ACID

 Go to an auto supply store and ask for "a small battery acid".  This should
only cost a few dollars (about 4 dollars).  What you will get is about a
gallon of dilute sulfuric acid.  Put a pint of this into a heat resistant
glass container.  The glass pitchers used for making coffee are perfect.

 Do not use a metal container.  Use an extension cord to set up a hotplate out
doors.  Boil the acid until white fumes appear.  As soon as you see the white
fumes, turn off the hot plate and let the acid cool.  Pour the now
concentrated acid into a glass container.  The container must have a glass
stopper or plastic cap -- no metal.  It must be air tight.  Otherwize, the
acid will quickly absorb moisture from the air and become diluted.  Want to
know how to make a time bomb that doesn't tick and has no wires or batteries?
Hold on to your acid and follow me into the next installment.

                   HOW TO MAKE A CHEMICAL TIME DELAY FUSE:

    To get an understanding of how this is going to work, mix up equal parts
by volume Potassium chlorate and granulated sugar.  Pour a spoonful of the
mixture in a small pile and make a depression in the top with the end of a
spoon.  Using a medicine dropper, place one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid
in the depression and step back.
     It will snap and crackle a few times and then burst into vigorous flames.
To make the fuse, cut about 2 inches off a plastic drinking straw.  Tamp a
small piece of cotton in one end.  On top of this put about an inch of the
clorate/sugar mixture.
    Now lightly tamp in about a quarter inch of either glass wool or asbestos
fibers.  Secure this with the open end up and drop in 3 or 4 drops of sulfuric
acid.  After a few minutes the acid will soak through the fibers and ignite
the mixture.
    The time delay can be controled by the amount of fiber used and by varying
how tightly it is packed.  Don't use cotton for this.  The acid will react
with cotton and become weakened in the process.  By punching a hole in the
side of the straw, a piece of blackmatch or other fuse can be inserted and
used to set off the device of your choice.

     Potassium chlorate was very popular with the radical underground.  It can
be used to make a wide variety of explosives and incendiaries, some of them
extremely dangerous to handle.  The radicals lost several people that way.
But, don't worry.  I am not going to try to protect you from yourself.  I have
decided to tell all.  I will have more to say about Potassium chlorate, but
for now, let's look at a couple of interesting electric fuses.


                         HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC FUSE

   Take a flashlight bulb and place it glass tip down on a file.  Grind it
down on the file until there is a hole in the end. Solder one wire to the case
of the bulb and another to the center conductor at the end.  Fill the bulb
with black powder or powdered match head. One or two flashlight batteries will
heat the filament in the bulb causing the powder to ignite.

                            ANOTHER ELECTRIC FUSE

    Take a medium grade of steel wool and pull a strand out of it.  Attach it
to the ends of two pieces of copper wire by wrapping it around a few turns and
then pinch on a small piece of solder to bind the strand to the wire. You want
about 1/2 inch of steel strand between the wires.  Number 18 or 20 is a good
size wire to use.
     Cut a 1/2 by 1 inch piece of cardboard of the type used in match covers.
Place a small pile of powdered match head in the center and press it flat.
place the wires so the steel strand is on top of and in contact with the
powder. Sprinkle on more powder to cover the strand.
     The strand should be surounded with powder and not touching anything else
except the wires at its ends. Place a piece of blackmatch in contact with the
powder.  Now put a piece of masking tape on top of the lot, and fold it under
on the two ends.  Press it down so it sticks all around the powder.
      The wires are sticking out on one side and the blackmatch on the other.
A single flashlight battery will set this off.

                              ELECTRIC FUSE # 3

   An excellent electric fuse can be bought ready made at hobby and toy
stores.  They are sold for setting off model rockets.

                         MORE SPONTANIOUS COMBUSTION

 Some of the ingredients for these can only be had from a chemical supply so
they are not my favorites.  Look for powdered aluminum at a good painting
supply.

                                  METHOD # 1
 Scatter out a few crystals of chromic anhydride.  Drop on a little ethyl
alcohol.  It will burst into flame immediately.
                                  METHOD # 2
  Mix by weight, four parts ammonium chloride, one part ammonium nitrate, four
parts powered zinc.  Pour out a small pile of this and make a depression on
top.  Put one or two drops of water in the depression. Stay well back from
this.
                                  METHOD # 3
  Put one gram of powdered potassium permanganate into a paper cup.  Drop two
drops of glycerine onto it.  After a few seconds it will burst into flames.


                                  METHOD # 4
  Spoon out a small pile of powdered aluminum.  Place a small amount of sodium
peroxide on top of this.  A volume the size of a small pea is about right.
One drop of water will cause this to ignite in a blinding flare.
                                  METHOD # 5
  Mix by volume 3 parts concentrated sulfuric acid with 2 parts concentrated
nitric acid. Hold a dropper of turpentine about 2 feet above the mixture.
When drops strike the acid they will burst into flame.

                        HOW TO MAKE NITROGEN TRIIODIDE

 Here are some notes I took four years ago on how to make this wild explosive
that can be detonated by a fly walking on it.

  Five grams iodine, three grams potassium iodide, 20 ml.  concentrated
ammonium hydroxide, filter paper, funnel.

  Stir the potassium iodide and iodine together in a beaker with 50 ml. of
water.  Add the ammonium hydroxide with stirring until no more precipitate
forms.
  Filter and spread a thin layer of the wet solid on several filter papers.
Break the filter papers into many small pieces and allow to dry for several
hours.  On drying, the paper is extremely sensitive to touch and will explode
violently with the slightest disturbance.  Can be handled safely when wet.  Do
not let any sizeable quantity of the dry material accumulate.

supply.

I.  COMMON "WEAK" EXPLOSIVES.

 A.  GUNPOWDER:
  75% POTASSIUM NITRATE
  15% CHARCOAL
  10% SULFUR

  The chemicals should be ground into a fine powder (seperately!) with a mo
rter & pestle.  If gunpowder is ignited in the open, it burns fiercely, but if
in a closed space it builds up pressure from the released gases and can
explode the container.  Gunpowder works like this: the potassium nitrate
oxidizes the charcoal and sulfur, which then burn fiercely.  carbon dioxide
and sulfur dioxide are the gases released.

 B.  AMMONAL:
  Ammonal is a mixture of ammonium nitrate (a strong oxidizer) with aluminum
powder (the 'fuel' in this case).  I am not sure of the % composition for
ammonal, so you may want to experiment a little using small amounts.


 C.  CHEMICALLY IGNITED EXPLOSIVES:

 1.  using various chemicals, I have developed a mixture that works very well
 for imitating volcanic eruptions.  i have given it the name 'mpg volcanite'

Here it is: potassium chlorate + potassium perchlorate + ammonium nitrate + am
monium dichromate + potassium nitrate + sugar + sulfur + iron filings + charcoa
l + zinc dust + some coloring agent.
 (scarlet= strontium nitrate, purple= iodine crystals, yellow= sodium
 chloride, crimson= calcium chloride, etc...).

                                PEROXYACETONE

 PEROXYACETONE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE SHOCK
 SENSITIVE.

MATERIALS-
 4ML ACETONE
 4ML 30% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
 4 DROPS CONC.  HYDROCHLORIC ACID
 150MM TEST TUBE

Add 4ml acetone and 4ml hydrogen peroxide to the test tube.  then add 4 drops
concentrated hydrochloric acid. In 10-20 minutes a white solid should begin to
appear. if no change is observed, warm the test tube in a water bath at 40
celsius. Allow the reaction to continue for two hours.  Swirl the slurry and
filter it. Leave out on filter paper to dry for at least two hours.  To
ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it (while staying at
least a meter away) .

 B.  SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE...

  The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke.  Since this
 reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary

 6 pt. ZINC POWDER
 1 pt. SULFUR POWDER
                       Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back.

 There are many other experiments I could have included, but i will save them
for the next chemist's corner article.  upcoming articles will include
glow-in-the-dark reactions, 'party' reactions, things you can do with
household chemicals , etc...

I would like to give credit to a book by shakashari entitled "Chemical
demonstrations" for a few of the precise amounts of chemicals in some
experiments.

THE CHEMIST'S CORNER #2:    HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS, BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG

 This article deals with instructions on how to do some interesting
experiments with common household chemicals.  Some may or may not work
depending on the concentration of certain chemicals in different areas and
brands.  I would suggest that the person doing these experiments have some
knowledge of chemistry, especially for the more dangerous experiments.

 I am not responsible for any injury or damage caused by people using this
information.  It is provided for use by people knowledgable in chemistry who
are interested in such experiments and can safely handle such experiments.

I.  A LIST OF HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR COMPOSITION

VINEGAR: 3-5% ACETIC ACID              BAKING SODA: SODIUM BICARBONATE
DRAIN CLEANERS: SODIUM HYDROXIDE       SANI-FLUSH: 75% SODIUM BISULFATE
AMMONIA WATER: AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE      CITRUS FRUIT: CITRIC ACID
TABLE SALT: SODIUM CHLORIDE            SUGAR: SUCROSE
MILK OF MAGNESIA-MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE   TINCTURE OF IODINE- 4% IODINE
RUBBING ALCOHOL- 70 OR 99% (DEPENDS ON BRAND) ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (DO NOT DRINK!)

                           GENERATING CHLORINE GAS

 This is slightly more dangerous than the other two experiments, so you
shouild know what you're doing before you try this...

 Ever wonder why ammonia bottles always say 'do not mix with chlorine bleach',
and visa-versa? That's because if you mix ammonia water with ajax or something
like it, it will give off chlorine gas. To capture it, get a large bottle and
put ajax in the bottom.  then pour some ammonia down into the bottle.  since
the c hlorine is heavier than air, it will stay down in there unless you use
large amounts of either ajax or ammonia (don't!).  for something fun to do
with chlorine STAY TUNED....

                            CHLORINE + TURPENTINE

 Take a small cloth or rag and soak it in turpentine. Quickly drop it into the
bottle of chlorine. It should give off a lot of black smoke and probably start
burning...
                           GENERATING HYDROGEN GAS

 To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid and a metal that will react
with that acid.  Try vinegar (acetic acid) with zinc, aluminum, magnesium,
etc.  You can collect hydrogen in something if you note that it is lighter
than air....  l ight a small amount and it burns with a small *pop*.


  Another way of creating hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water.  this
involve sseperating water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric
current. To do this, you need a 6-12 volt battery (or a DC transformer), two
test tubes, a large bowl, two carbon electrodes (take them out of an unworking
6-12 volt battery), and table salt. Dissolve the salt in a large bowl full of
water. Submerge the two test tubes in the water and put the electrodes inside
them, with the mouth of the tube aiming down.  Connect the battery to some
wire going down to the electrodes.
   This will work for a while, but chlorine will be generated along with the
oxygen which will corrode your copper wires leading to the carbon
electrodes...  (the table salt is broken up into chlorine and sodium ions, the
chlorine comes off as a gas with oxygen while sodium reacts with the water to
form sodium hydroxide....).  therefore, if you can get your hands on some
sulfuric acid, use it instead.  it will not affect the reaction other than
making the water conduct electricity.

Addendum 4/12/91: DO NOT use a transformer that outputs AC current!
   Not only is AC inherently more dangerous than DC, it also produces equal
   amount of Hydrogen and Oxygen at each electrode.

                             HYRDOGEN + CHLORINE

 Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover the mouth with your thumb. Keep it
inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine (not one that has reacted
with turpentine).  Say "goodbye test tube", and drop it into the bottle.  The
hydrogen and chlorine should react and possibly explode (depending on purity
and amount of each gas).  An interesting thing about this is they will not
react if it is dark and no heat or other energy is around. When a light is
turned on, enough energy is present to cause them to react...

                            PREPARATION OF OXYGEN
    Get some hydrogen peroxide (from a drug store) and manganese dioxide (from
a battery- it's a black powder).  Mix the two in a bottle, and they give off
oxygen. If the bottle is stoppered, pressure will build up and shoot it off.
     Try lighting a wood splint and sticking it (when only glowing) into the
bottle. The oxygen will make it burst into flame. The oxygen will allow things
to burn better...

                                    IODINE
   Tincture of iodine contains mainly alcohol and a little iodine.  To
seperate them, put the tincture of iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat
it over a candle.  Have a stand holding another metal lid directly over the
tincture (about 4-6 inches above it) with ice on top of it.  The alcohol
should evaporate, and the iodine should sublime, but should reform iodine
crystals on the cold metal lid directly above.  If this works (I haven't
tried), you can use the iodine along with household ammonia to form nitrogen
triiodide.

CHLOROX-DRAINO   By The Mortician     Sysop of: The Morgue (201)376-4462

 I am not too sure on how this works but I am pretty sure that you can make a
really powerful bomb by taking a can of draino and mixing it with Chlorox. I
think that these two compounds will spontaniously explode so don't just pour
them together.

    I think what you do is get the draino in a cardboard can and then put it
in a bucket of chlorox and what will happen is either the draino or chlorox
will eat through the cardboard and they will meet and explode.

     You might want to experiment with this by rigging it up so you can cause
the two to combine while you stand a distance a way.  I reccomend extreme
caution with this and wear goggles....

  Just like pour some chlorox into a pan and then have a can of draino with a
string tied to it so you can make it spill into the chlorox...  Be Careful. I
don't need a law suit... If you find anything out call The Morgue and leave me
feedback and/or get me in chat and I will update this file with credit to
you....

Addendum 4/12/91:   All this reaction does is produce heat and gas.

   I have found that Pool Chlorine tablets with strong household ammonia react
to produce LOTS of chlorine gas and heat... also mixing the tablets with
rubbing alcohol produces heat, a different (and highly flammable) gas, and
possibly some sort of acid (it eats away at just about anything it touches)

If you have any more info, send me mail:  KADOKEV@IITVAX (Bitnet)
                                          kadokev@iitvax.iit.edu

I'd especially appreciate chemical formulas, or other interesting combinations
(also a source for the pure chemicals in the tablets and in household ammonia)

    Any fool can grow their own marijuana.... just plant the seeds in a warm,
sunny and not too public place, water and fertilize as you would any other
plant, and in a short while you'll have your own homegrown weed. I've heard
that you can kill mites by soaking some tobacco (buy a pack of plain pipe
tobacco) in water, and spraying it on the leaves (you don't want to use toxic
chemicals on something you're going to smoke later)

    If you're not used to the stuff, cut it with 50% tobacco, and smoke it in
a filtered pipe or use the mixture to refill a cigarette- the tar content is
MUCH higher than that of a regular cigarrette.

    Remember, cultivation is a FEDERAL crime, so if you can do it at home,
just pick a room with no windows, and put in some grow lights (sodium vapor
lamps are reputed to be the best- steal a couple streetlights) and a water
spigot.

                TRIPWIRES                     by The Mortician

    Well first of all I reccommend that you read the file on my board about
landmines...  If you can't then here is the concept.

  You can use an m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other type of explosive that
will light with a fuse. Now the way this works is if you have a 9 volt
battery, get either a solar igniter (preferably) or some steel wool you can
create a remote ignition system.  What you do it set up a schematic like this.

  ------------------>+ batery
 steel ||          ->- batery
 wool ||            /
 :==:--- <--fuse    \
  ||                /
  ---- spst switch--\

   So when the switch is on the currnet will flow through the steel wool or
igniter and heat up causing the fuse to light.
  Note: For use with steel wool try it first and get a really thin piece of
wire and pump the current through it to make sure it will heat up to light the
explosive.

   Now the thing to do is plant your explosive wherever you want it to be,bury
it and cover the wires.  Now take a fishing line (about 20 lb. test) and tie
one end to a secure object.  Have your switch secured to something and make a
loop on the other end on the line. Put the loop around the switch such that
when pulled it will pull the switch and set off the explosive.

   To ignite the explosive...  The thing to do is to experiment with this and
find your best method...  Let me know on any good kills, or new techniques...

  BOOBY TRAP TRIP WIRES......      BY Vlad Tepes (of Chgo C64 fame)

   Here is a method for constructing boobytraps which I personally invented,
and which I have found to work better than any other type of release booby
trap.

    There are many possible variations on this design, but the basic premise
remains the same. What you'll need is 3-4 nails each 2 inches long and soft
enough to bend easily (galvanized iron works well), some wire or fishing line,
some string or rope, and a really sick mind.

    Hammer two of the nails into the trunk of a tree (about one inch apart) so
they form a horizontal line. They should be angled slightly upward, about 30
degrees.

    Bend each nail Downward about one inch out from the trunk. Take your
nefarious device (say a small rock suspended in a tree) and rig a rope or
string so it comes DOWN towards the two nails. Tie a loop in the string so the
loop *just* reaches between the two nails, and pass a third nail between the
two nails with the loop around this nail between the two others (see diagrams)

      bent nails
     /                        || ^ slight upward tension
# /\                          ||
#/                         @  ||    @         ( @ are the two nails, head on)
#                  ------!----()------
#          trip wire
 \                     /
Trunk                 third nail

    Now tie one end of the fishing line to the head of the third nail, and the
other end around another tree or to a nail (in another tree, a root or a
stump etc).

    When somebody pulls on the trip wire, the nail will be pulled out and your
sick creation will be released to do it's damage (try tying it to a firing
pin). There are several possible variations. More than one trip wire can be
attached to the same nail, or this device can be used to arm a second trip
wire. Large wire staples or hook and eye loops can be used to replace the two
bent nails.

     A more interesting variation uses a straight piece of metal rod with a
hole at each end, or with a short wire loop welded to each end. One end is
attached to the tripwire, the other is attached to a spring.
               ||
*/\/\/\/\/\-===()=======--------------------------------------*
  SPRING     BOLT            Trip wire

    With this design the loop will be released if the tripwire is pulled or if
it is broken. The spring should be under moderate tension and well oiled.

                   RECIPE FOR A STANDARD PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE
 
INGREDIENTS:
 
GASOLINE - 1 PART    OIL - 1 HALF PART      STYROFOAM - 1 PART
 
1) MELT STYROFOAM. -REMEMBER NEVER AT ANY TIME LET THE MIXTURE GET TOO HOT.

Addendum 4/12/91
   Acetone will dissolve the styrofoam, and requires no heat- this is an
 ingredient in nail polish remover, or it is available at any good automotive
 supply store in the paint section.

 A nice trick is to walk into a store, grab a bottle of nail polish remover
 (check the ingredients, it should have acetone in it) then "accidentally"
 pour it into a large stack of (uncoated) styrofoam coolers and wander off.
*End Addendum

2) LET COOL TO A THICK VISCOSITY.
 
3) MIX 3 INGREDIENTS TOGETHER IN FOLLOWING ORDER: FIRST ADD STYROFOAM, THEN
 OIL, THEN GAS.
 
4) MIX IN A DEEP POT - KEEP MIXTURE AWAY FROM ANY TYPE OF FIRE! DO THIS STEP
 WITH EXTREME CAUTION.
 
5) LET THE MIXTURE COOL TO A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN ROOM TEMPERATURE - AROUND
 88 DEGREES FARENHEIT.
 
6) MOLD THE MIXTURE HOW YOU WANT. (DIFFERENT SHAPES WILL MAKE IT MORE OR LESS
 LETHAL).
 
OPTIONAL: YOU CAN ADD NUTS, BOLTS, AND SCREWS WHILE MIXING, ALONG WITH
GUNPOWDER, 2 M-80'S, OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF EXPLOSIVE TO MAKE IT THE EQUIVILANT
OF A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL.
 
NOTE: THE FRAGMENTS (NUTS, BOLT, ETC.) ARE DEADLY.  THEY WILL PENETRATE A
BRICK WALL WHEN THE MIXTURE IS DETONATED.
 
                                  DETONATION
 
1) THE MIXTURE CAN BE THROWN, BUT SOMETIMES DETONATION DOES NOT OCCUR.
 
2) THE MIXTURE CAN BE WIRED FOR AN ELECTRIC CHARGE TO BE SENT THROUGH IT, IT
 WILL DETONATE WITHOUT DOUBT. A REGULAR FUSE CAN BE SENT THROUGH IT ALSO.  IF
 THIS METHOD IS USED, SOME SORT OF TIMER IS RECOMMENDED.

Addendum 4/12/91: This just burns and smokes, WILL NEVER explode.. don't bother!

 
  Nitroglycerin [heretofore Nitro] is a very powerful high- explosive.  I am
not sure who invented it but he probably didn't-- the first person to make it
probably blew himself up and his friend got the info off his notes.

Well anyway, the next best thing to Nitro is TNT which is ten times harder to
make but also ten times safer to make.  If you can't use common sense then
dont even TRY to make this stuff--a few drops can blow off your hand in the
right circumstances.
 
To make Nitro:
  Mix 100 parts fuming nitric acid (for best results it should have a
specific gravity of 50 degrees Baume') with 200 parts sulphuric acid.

  This is going to be HOT at first--it won't splatter if you pour the nitric
INTO the sulphuric but don't try it the other way around.  The acid solutions
together can disolve flesh in a matter of seconds so take the proper measures
for God's sake!!!

 When cool, add 38 parts glycerine as slowly as possible. Let it trickle down
the sides of the container into the acids or it won't mix thourily and the
reaction could go to fast--which causes enough heat to ignite the stuff.

  Stir with a **GLASS** rod for 15 seconds or so then CARFULLY pour it into 20
times it's *VOLUME* of water.  It will visibly precipitate immediatly.  there
will be twice as much Nitro as you used glycerin and it is easy to separate.
Mix it with baking soda as soon as you have separated it-- this helps it not
to go off spontainiously.
 
Addendum 4/12/91: Do NOT let the temperature get above 32 degrees centigrade!!!

NOTES: Parts are by weight and he Baume' scale of spicific gravity can be
found in most chem.  books.  You can get fuming nitric and sulfuric acids
wherever good chemicals or fertilizers are sold.

     It is positivly *STUPID* to make more than 200 grams of Nitro at a time.
When mixing the stuff wear goggles, gloves, etc.  When I first made the stuff
I had the honor of having it go off by itself (I added too much glycerine at a
time.)
    I was across the room at the time, but I felt the impact--so did the table
it was on as well as the window it was next to--they were both smashed by only
25 grams in an open bowl. Oh, yes, glycerine you can get at any pharmacy and
you need an adult signature for the acids.  Any bump can make Nitro go off if
you don't add the bicarbonate of (baking) soda--but even with that, if it gets
old I wouldn't play catch with it.
 
Addendum 4/12/91: Freezing it will make it less sensitive to shock.
 
  Once you have made the Nitro and saturated it with Bicarb.  you can make a
really powerful explosive that won't go off by itself by simply mixing it with
as much cotton as you can and then saturating that with molten (but as cool as
possible, of course) parifine--just enough to make it sealed and hard.
Typically, use the same amounts (by weight) of each Nitro, cotton and
paraffin.  This, when wrapped in newspaper, was once known as "Norbin &
Ohlsson's Patent Dynamite," but that was back in 1896.

                            Improvised Explosives
Gelatine Explosive from Anti-Freeze         Written by: The Lich

 This explosive is almost the same as the nitro-gelatin plastique explosive
exept that it is supple and pliable to -10 to -20 deg.  C
   Antifreeze is easier to obtain than glycerine and is usually cheaper.  It
needs to be freed of water before the manufacture and this can be done by
treating it with calcium chlor- ide until a specific gravity of 1.12 @ o deg.
C.  or 1.11 @ 20 deg.  C.  is obtained.
    This can be done by adding calcium chloride to the antifreeze and checking
with a hydrometer and continue to add calcium chloride until the proper
reading is obtained.  The antifreeze is then filtered to remove the calcium
chloride from the liquid.  This explosive is superior to nitro-gelatin in that
it is easier to collidon the IMR smokeless powder into the explosive and that
the 50/50 ether ethyl alcohol can be done away with.  It is superior in that
the formation of the collidon is done very rapidly by the nitroethelene
glycol.
   It's detonation properties are practically the same as the nitro-gelatine.
Like the nitro-gelatine it is highly flammable and if caught on fire the
chances are good that the flame will progress to detonation.  In this
explosive as in nitro-gelatine the addition of 1% sodium carbonate is a good
idea to reduce the chance of recidual acid being present in the final
explosive.  The following is a slightly different formula than nitro-gelatine:

Nitro-glycol 75%  Guncotton (IMR) 6%  Potassium Nitrate  14%   Flour 5%

    In this process the 50/50 step is omitted.  Mix the potassium nitrate with
the nitro-glycol.  Remember that this nitro-glycol is just as sensitive to
shock as is nitroglycerin.
    The next step is to mix in the baking flour and sodium carbonate. Mix
these by kneading with gloved hands until the mixture is uniform.  This
kneading should be done gently and slowly.  The mixture should be uniform when
the IMR smokeless powder is added.  Again this is kneaded to uniformity.  Use
this explosive as soon as possible.
    If it must be stored, store in a cool, dry place (0-10 deg.  C.).  This
explosive should detonate at 7600-7800 m/sec..  These two explosives are very
powerful and should be sensitive to a #6 blasting cap or equivelent.
    These explosives are dangerous and should not be made unless the
manufacturer has had experience with this type compound.  The foolish and
ignorant may as well forget these explosives as they won't live to get to use
them.
    Don't get me wrong, these explosives have been manufactured for years with
an amazing record of safety.  Millions of tons of nitroglycerine have been
made and used to manufacture dynamite and explosives of this nature with very
few mis haps.
   Nitroglycerin and nitroglycol will kill and their main victims are the
stupid and foolhardy.  Before manufacturing these explosives take a drop of
nitroglycerin and soak into a small piece of filter paper and place it on an
anvil.
  Hit this drop with a hammer and don't put any more on the anvil.  See what I
mean! This explosive compound is not to be taken lightly.  If there are any
doubts DON'T.

Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Aspirin    by: The Lich

 This explosive is a phenol dirivative.  It is toxic and explosive compounds
made from picric acid are poisonous if inhaled, ingested, or handled and
absor- bed through the skin.  The toxicity of this explosive restrict's its
use due to the fact that over exposure in most cases causes liver and kidney
failure and sometimes death if immediate treatment is not obtained.

 This explosive is a cousin to T.N.T.  but is more powerful than it's cousin.
It is the first explosive used militarily and was adopted in 1888 as an
artillery shell filler.  Originally this explosive was derived from coal tar
but thanks to modern chemistry you can make this explosive easily in
approximately three hours from acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin purified).

 This procedure involves dissolving the acetylsalicylic acid in warm sulfuric
acid and adding sodium or potassium nitrate which nitrates the purified
aspirin and the whole mixture drowned in water and filtered to obtain the
final product.  This explosive is called trinitrophenol.  Care should be
taken to ensure that this explosive is stored in glass containers.  Picric
acid will form dangerous salts when allowed to contact all metals exept tin
and aluminum.  These salts are primary explosive and are super sensitive.
They also will cause the detonation of the picric acid.

 To make picric acid obtain some aspirin.  The cheaper brands work best but
buffered brands should be avoided.  Powder these tablets to a fine
consistancy. To extract the acetylsalicylic acid from this powder place this
powder in methyl alcohol and stir vigorously.  Not all of the powder will
dissolve.  Filter this powder out of the alcohol.  Again wash this powder that
was filtered out of the alcohol with more alcohol but with a lesser amount
than the first extrac- tion.  Again filter the remaining powder out of the
alcohol.  Combine the now clear alcohol and allow it to evaporate in a pyrex
dish.  When the alcohol has evaporated there will be a surprising amount of
crystals in the bottom of the pyrex dish.

 Take fourty grams of these purified acetylsalicylic acid crystals and
dissolve them in 150 ml.  of sulfuric acid (98%, specify gravity 1.8) and heat
to diss- olve all the crystals.  This heating can be done in a common electric
frying pan with the thermostat set on 150 deg.  F.  and filled with a good
cooking oil.

When all the crystals have dissolved in the sulfuric acid take the beaker,
that you've done all this dissolving in (600 ml.), out of the oil bath.  This
next step will need to be done with a very good ventilation system (it is a
good idea to do any chemistry work such as the whole procedure and any
procedure on this disk with good ventilation or outside).  Slowly start adding
58 g.  of sodium nitrate or 77 g.  of potassium nitrate to te acid mixture in
the beaker very slowly in small portions with vigorous stirring.  A red gas
(nitrogen tri- oxide) will be formed and this should be avoided.



  The mixture is likely to foam up and the addition should be stopped until
the foaming goes down to prevent the overflow of the acid mixture in the
beaker.  When the sodium or potassium nitrate has been added the mixture is
allowed to cool somewhat (30- 40 deg.  C.). The solution should then be dumped
slowly into twice it's volume of crushed ice and water.  The brilliant yellow
crystals will form in the water. These should be filtered out and placed in
200 ml.  of boiling distilled water. This water is allowed to cool and then
the crystals are then filtered out of the water.  These crystals are a very,
very pure trinitrophenol.  These crystals are then placed in a pyrex dish and
places in an oil bath and heated to 80 deg. C.  and held there for 2 hours.
This temperature is best maintained and checked with a thermometer.

  The crystals are then powdered in small quantities to a face powder
consistency.  These powdered crystals are then mixed with 10% by weight wax
and 5% vaseline which are heated to melting temperature and poured into the
crystals.  The mixing is best done by kneading together with gloved hands.
This explosive should have a useful plsticity range of 0-40 deg.  C..  The
detonation velocity should be around 7000 m/sec..  It is toxic to handle but
simply made from common ingredients and is suitable for most demolition work
requiring a moderately high detonation velocity.  It is very suitable for
shaped charges and some steel cutting charges.  It is not as good an explosive
as C-4 or other R.D.X.  based explosives but it is much easier to make.  Again
this explosive is very toxic and should be treated with great care.

  AVOID HANDLING BARE-HANDED, BREATHING DUST AND FUMES, AVOID ANY CHANCE OF
INGESTION. AFTER UTENSILS ARE USED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS EXPLOSIVE
RETIRE THEM FROM THE KITCHEN AS THE CHANCE OF POISONING IS NOT WORTH THE RISK.
THIS EXPLOSIVE, IF MANUFACTURED AS ABOVE, AHOULD BE SAFE IN STORAGE BUT WITH
ANY HOMEMADE EXPLOSIVE STORAGE OS NOT RECOMENDED AND EXPLOSIVES SHOULD BE MADE
UP AS NEEDED.


Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Bleach     by: The Lich

 This explosive is a potassium chlorate explosive.  This explosive and explo-
sives of similar composition were used in World War II as the main explosive
filler in gernades, land mines, and mortar used by French, German, and other
forces involoved in that conflict.  These explosives are relatively safe to
manufacture.

  One should strive to make sure these explosives are free of sulfur,
sulfides, and picric acid.  The presence of these compounds result in mixtures
that are or can become highly sensitive and possibly decompose ex- plosively
while in storage.  The manufacture of this explosive from bleach is given as
just an expediant method.  This method of manufacturing potassium chlorate is
not economical due to the amount of energy used to boil the solution and
cause the 'dissociation' reaction to take place.  This procedure does work and
yields a relatively pure and a sulfur/sulfide free product.  These explosives
are very cap sensitive and require only a #3 cap for instigating detonation.

  To manufacture potassium chlorate from bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite
solution) obtain a heat source (hot plate etc.) a battery hydrometer, a large
pyrex or enameled steel container (to weigh chemicals), and some potassium
chloride (sold as salt substitute).  Take one gallon of bleach, place it in
the container and begin heating it.  While this solution heats, weigh out 63
g.  potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated. Bring this
solution to a boil and boiled until when checked by a hydrometer the reading
is 1.3 (if a battery hydrometer is used it should read full charge).

 When the reading is 1.3 take the solution and let it cool in the refrigerator
until it's between room temperature and 0 deg.  C..  Filter out the crystals
that have formed and save them.  Boil the solution again until it reads 1.3 on
the hydrometer and again cool the solution.  Filter out the crystals that have
formed and save them.  Boil this solution again and cool as before.

  Filter and save the crystals.  Take these crystals that have been saved and
mix them with distilled water in the following proportions: 56 g.  per 100 ml.
distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils and allow it to cool.
Filter the solution and save the crystals that form upon cooling.  The process
if purifi- cation is called fractional crystalization.  These crystals should
be relatively pure potassium chlorate.

 Powder these to the consistency of face powder (400 mesh) and heat gently to
drive off all moisture.  Melt five parts vasoline and five parts wax.
Dissolve this in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline) and pour this liquid on
90 parts potassium chlorate (the crystals from the above operation) in a
plastic bowl. Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until immediately
mixed.  Allow all the gasoline to evaporate.  Place this explosive in a cool,
dry place.  Avoid friction, sulfur, sulfide, and phosphorous compounds.


 This explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density (1.3g./cc.)
and dipped in wax to water proof.  These block type charges guarantee the
highest detonation velocity.  This explosive is really not suited to use in
shaped charge applications due to its relatively low detonation velocity.  It
is comparable to 40% ammonia dynamite and can be considered the same for the
sake of charge computation.

 If the potassium chlorate is bought and not made it is put into the
manufacture pro- cess in the powdering stages preceding the addition of the
wax/vaseline mix- ture.  This explosive is bristant and powerful.  The
addition of 2-3% aluminum powder increases its blast effect.  Detonation
velocity is 3300 m/sec..


Plastique Explosives From Swimming Pool Clorinating Compound    By the Lich

 This explosive is a chlorate explosive from bleach.  This method of
production of potassium or sodium chlorate is easier and yields a more pure
product than does the plastique explosive from bleach process.

  In this reaction the H.T.H. (calcium hypochlorite CaC10) is mixed with water
and heated with either sodium chloride (table salt, rock salt) or potassium
chloride (salt substitute).  The latter of these salts is the salt of choice
due to the easy crystalization of the potassium chlorate.

  This mixture will need to be boiled to ensure complete reaction of the
ingredients.  Obtain some H.T.H.  swimming pool chlorination compound or
equivilant (usually 65% calcium hypochlorite).  As with the bleach process
mentioned earlier the reaction described below is also a dissociation
reaction.  In a large pyrex glass or enamled steel container place 1200g.
H.T.H. and 220g.  potassium chloride or 159g.  sodium chloride.  Add enough
boiling water to dissolve the powder and boil this solution.  A chalky
substance (calcium chloride) will be formed.  When the formation of this
chalky substance is no longer formed the solution is filtered while boiling
hot.  If potassium chloride was used potassium chlorate will be formed.

 This potassium chlorate will drop out or crystalize as the clear liquid left
after filtering cools.  These crystals are filtered out when the solution
reaches room temperature.  If the sodium chloride salt was used this clear
filtrate (clear liquid after filter- ation) will need to have all water
evaporated.  This will leave crystals which should be saved.

 These crystals should be heated in a slightly warm oven in a pyrex dish to
drive off all traces of water (40-75 deg.  C.).  These crystals are ground to a
very fine powder (400 mesh).

 If the sodium chloride salt is used in the initial step the crystalization is
much more time consuming.  The potassium chloride is the salt to use as the
resulting product will crystalize out of the solution as it cools.  The
powdered and completely dry chlorate crystals are kneaded together with
vaseline in a plastic bowl.  ALL CHLORATE BASED EXPLOSIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO
FRICTION AND SHOCK AND THESE SHOULD BE AVOIDED.  If sodium chloride is used in
this explosive it will have a tendancy to cake and has a slightly lower
detonation velocity.


  This explosive is composed of the following:

 potassium/sodium chlorate 90%
                 vaseline  10%

   Simply pour the powder into a plastic baggy and knead in the vaseline
carefully. this explosive (especially if the Sodium Chlorate variation is
used) should not be exposed to water or moisture.

 The detonation velocity can be raised to a slight extent by the addition of
2-3% aluminum sunstituted for 2-3% of the vaseline.  This addition of this
aluminum will give the explosive a bright flash if set off at night which will
ruin night vision for a short while.  The detonation velocity of this
explosive is approximately 3200 m/sec.  for the potassium salt and 2900 m/sec.
for the sodium salt based explosive.

Addendum 4/12/91:

   It was claimed above that this explosive degrades over time. I would assume
that this occurs due to the small amount of water present in the vaseline, and
that a different type of fuel would be better than the vaseline.

 Revenge: Don't get mad - Get even     By George Hayduke

 subtitled: Fun Things To Do           Written by The Ghost
               SPEED DEMON 415/522-3074 24 HOURS

   This is from a book by George Hayduke.  It describes a variety of ways to
get back at people who cause you distress.  The book has contains a lot of
tips on causing expensive damage to "marks".  Well, I picked the good ones.
Ones that don't cause a lot of expense, in currency that is.  Well, I hope you
enjoy.  Get back at the losers using the system.  Sort of like piracy and
phreaking.

   In a car with automatic transmission, switch the #1 and #8 wires on the
distributer cap.  This will allegedly allow the car to operate in Neutral and
Park, but the engine mysteriously dies in Drive.
   Castor Oil squirted into the tailpipe of a car, will cause a large amount of
smoke.  Just the thing to help nervous drivers.
   If you can get a bank account number for a person, truly wonderful things
can happen.  Depositing one penny every day can get the employees very pissed.
It happens that given a few hundred wanted posters, one will look like you.
OR anybody else you can imagine.  Close anyway.  Think of all the bounty
hunters just waiting to claim their reward.

   Place an ad in a paper for Male Secretarys only.  $11 an hour, must be
physically attractive, gentle, and other related social traits.  This is for
anybody who has an office.  Give the time to show up one half hour before the
normal opening hour.  For example, if the office opens at 9:00, put the time
to be 8:30.  All these faggots will show up and start bitching at each other
and your loser.
          Run an ad in the local paper with the following message.
"I need all used christmas trees.  Please leave them on my lawn, and I'll pay
$5 for each one." then leave the losers address.  The paper will take your $
and print the ad without thinking.
  If you know the guy is going to throw a party, arrange for him to find out
that somebody was going to crash his party, dressed up like cops.  Then call
the cops telling them of a real rowdy party going on.
   If your college uses computers to handle admissions, try this.  Fill out
course withdrawl forms in the losers name.  Then enter them, they probably
won't check. The guy will go the entire block unknowing, then when grades are
posted.  "Where are mine?" "Why didn't I get grades?"

   Call your colleges administration, tell them you are the undertaker of your
losers hometown.  He just died, please take him off your records, records will
follow.  Then call the parents.  He just died in a fraternity accident.  This
will work better if the guy decides to skip a week or so of classes.
   Instead of credit card fraud, just call up the company and tell them that
you just lost your cards.  You name? Why it's (insert loser)
   If you want, advertise the losers phone number as a Dial A Joke.  For
bigots, Dial A Black, etc.


  If you dislike a fast food place with a drive thru, try this.  Order
everything you can think of.  Then just don't go to the window.  Do it during
dinner hours. Or, order a normal sized meal, but with extra helpings of
mustard.  Then the next car will try the food, then freak out at the joint.
   Garage door openers often have dip switches that can be changed to other
combinations.  The cheaper the model, the better.  Sears sells just the unit.
Say you broke yours or something.  Then change the settings.

    Wax crayons tossed into a wash do wonders to whites or anything else.

   There is a whole section of phun things to do with a phone.  Call in a bomb
threat to a school or something, then leave the handset offhook.  Of course,
do this only at the losers house.  Someone will visit.
     Ads placed in papers saying that (insert loser) will sell YOU! the plans
to a device enabling inexpensive calls.  Mention that you keep no records.  If
you are getting back at somebody with a multi-line system, this is good.
     If you can get a private minute with your marks phone, and the handset is
modular, cover the handset plug with clear nail polish.  The phone rings, then
its unlimited "Hello?" "Hello?"
   Remove the pins from all but one of the hinges of a front door of a
business. The door will work fine, for a while, then fall off.  People start
screaming.
  Add luminescent paint into the cans of someone who is painting their fence.
Then, at night, it glows.
   Get some copper paint and paint a small line across the insulator of a
spark plug in a car.  They'll never find it.
   If your loser gets a parking ticket, get it before he sees it.  Then get a
stamp flicking the cops off.  Send it in with no money.
    If you dislike a pet hater, here's one. Advertise that you(the loser)
would like to buy all unwanted strays.  $10 for each one.  Then call the SPCA,
telling them that the loser wants the animals to conduct black masses and
pagan rites.
         Laxatives slipped into dogfood does wonders.

    Or better yet, toss some normal meat into the dog-owners yard.  Then call
him up(in a disguised voice) and tell him you saw a suspicious person hanging
around the yard....
  Mail a letter to the Chief Executive detailing the sexual acts you would
like to commit, the Secret Service investigates this with no humor.
   PA systems in department stores are great.  Just walk up to a deserted unit,
look around, then deliver the most disgusting statement you can think of.
 Call about thirty people, telling them they just won a sweepstakes.  Answer
the questions, no obligation, it's just to show how generous people are.  Then
give the losers phone number to call for more info.
   Remember two things, hot metal and hot glass do not look different from
cool. (as long as it's not too hot)
    Western Telegram has a check on everything going through.  Certain key
words trip alarms.  Guns, Drugs, Sex, Terrorist, etc all ring bells.  Have fun


  There are many ways to thrash someones car.  But they basicly fall under 2
topics.  These are, 1 to just fuck it up and 2, to distroy it.  As long  as
your at it don't for get to steal the stero & speakers.


                                  Sweet-Gas
 This involves taking the gas cap off of you victims car.  If it is a locking
cap break it off.  Or you might pry it off.  Once you have the gas cap off
pour 4 or 5 pounds of white sugar in there gas tank.  Now when the start there
car up and drive away they will go about 2 miles or so then the car will crap
out and they will have to pay some $'s to get it fixed.

Addendum 4/12/91: This does NOT work- try confectioner's sugar, it might.

                                  Sweet-Oil
 In this one you open there hood and pour some honey in their oil spout.  if
you have time you might remover the oil plug first and drain some of the oil
out.  I have tried this one but wasn't around to see the effects but I am sure
that I did some damage.

                                   Slow Air
 Ok, sneak up the victums car and poke a small hole somewhere in 2 of his/her
tires.  They only have 1 spare.  Now if the hole is small but there then there
tire will go flat some where on the road.  You could slice the tire so this is
blows out on the road wih a rasor blade.  Cut a long and fairly deep (don't
cut a hole) and peel a little bit of the rubber back and cut that off.  Now
very soon there tires will go flat or a possible blow out at a high speed if
your lucky.

                               Vanishing Paint
 Spread a little gas or paint thiner on the victims car and this will make his
paint run and fade.  Vodka will eat the paint off and so will a little 190.
Eggs work great on paint if they sit there long enough.


                                 Loose Wheel
 Loosen the lugs on you victums tires so that they will soon fall off.  This
can really fuck some one up if they are cruising when the tire falls off.

 No name for this one.  but where you pour oil into the engine, pour some
sand, this will scar the head and pushrodes and possible scrach the fuck out
of the cylinder.

                                 Dual Neutral
   This name sucks but pull the 10 bolt or what ever they have there off.  (On
the real wheels, in the middle of the axle) Now throw some screws, blots, nuts
and assorted things in there and replace the cover. At this point you could
chip some of the teeth off the gears.

                                  Un-Midaser
 Crawl under there car with a rachet and losen all the nuts on their exhaust
so that it hangs low and will fall off soon. This method also works on
transmissions but is a little harder to get all bolts off, but the harder you
work the more you fuck them over.

Ok.  Heres a really simple bomb that you can make from things you've probably
got lying around the house...  What you ne eed:

A bag of fertilizer
Some Cotton
Some Starter Fluid (etherous kind)
Some Newspaper

Ok...  You fold the newspaper until its in sort of a pocket shape, then fill
it up with fertilizer (not too much)..  Next, you put cotton on top of the
fertilizer.  Then, pour some starter fluid on it (the fertilizer), wrap up
the newspaper (you can use tape).  Now this isnt the kind of bomb you leave
lying around for a couple days, as it drys out.  When you want to use it, just
light the edge of the newspaper and throw it.  Pretty simple, eh?
 
Addendum 4/12/91:  This is stupid.  Starting fluid is DANGEROUS stuff.
Try it if you like, but I recommend a better detonation technique than
burning newspaper... Maybe a spark plug?


 P.S.  I never noticed before, but all the formulas, etc.  that the dude on

How To Make Mercury Fulminate   by The Lockpic & The Blitz

When employing the use of any high explosive,an individual must also use some
kind of detonating device.Blasting caps are probably the most popular
today,since they are very functional and relativly stable.The prime ingrediant
in most blasting caps and detonating devices in general is mercury
fulminate.There are several methods for preparing mercury fulminate.

1.  Take 5 grams of pure mercury and mix is with 35 ml.  of nitric acid.

2.The mixture is slowly and gentle heated.As soon as the solution bubbles and
turns green, one knows that the silver mercury is dissolved.

3.  After it is dissolved, the solution should be poured,slowly,into a small
flask of ethyl alcohol.This will result in red fumes.

4.  After a half hour or so,the red fumes will turn white, indicating that the
process is nearing its final stage.

5.  after a few minutes, add distilled water to the solution.

6.  The entire solution is now filtered, in order to obtain the small white
crystals.These crystals are pure mercury fulminate,but should be washed many
times, and tested with litmus paper for any remaining undersiable acid.

                                Method No.  2

1.  Mix one part mercuric oxide with ten parts ammonia solution.When ratios
are described,they are always done according to weight rather than volume.

2.  After waiting eight to ten days,one will see that the mercuric oxide has
reacted with the ammonia solution to produce the white fulminate crystals.

3.  These crystals must be handled in the same way as the first method
described, in that they must be washed many times and given several litmus
paper tests.


Many other fulminates can be made, however most are extremely unstable and
sensitive to shock.All fulminates including mercury fulminate,are sensitive to
shock and friction,and in no circumstances should they be handled in a rough
or careless manner..

How to Make Ammonium Nitrate  from THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND by: Kurt Saxon
TYPED BY THE REFLEX

Disclaimer:
 I, THE REFLEX, will accept full responsibility for any damage caused by
information obtained from this text-file.  As a matter of fact, I'll let you
sue me and I'll pay.  All you have to do is tell your lawyer, "It's all THE
REFLEX's fault." I'll see you when you get out of the institution.

 Some Militants who don't have much dynamite use ammonium nitrate.  This can
be bought by anyone at $3.75 for and 80 pound bag.  It is fertilizer.
    Ammonium nitrate explodes at rates up to 14,000 feet per second.  It is
roughly compared to dynamite having 60% nitro.

   The fertilizer grade Militants use is mixed with motor oil at the ratio of
one pint of oil to 8-1/2 pounds of ammonium nitrate.  This has to be detonated
with a stick of gelatin dynamite [I didn't say all was easy.  Try to find
another file about that crap.].

    Purified ammonium nitrate can be detonated with a number six dynamite cap.
The pure stuff can be bought at chemical supply houses or the fertilizer grade
can be purified with distilled wood alcohol.

   Put several pounds of fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in a pan.  Pour in
enough wood alcohol (methanol) to cover the fertilizer.  Then stir it until a
lot of it has dissolved.  Next, let it set for a few minutes to allow the
impurities to settle to the bottom along with the undissolved ammonium
nitrate.

   Another pan is set on some pieces of dry ice for the next step.  Dry ice
can be found in the business section of the phone book under "Dry Ice." Locker
companies will sell it to anyone, cheaply and in small amounts.

  The dissolved ammonium nitrate is poured into the cold pan.  This is done
carefully so as to leave the impurities and undissolved ammonium nitrate behind.

  The dry ice causes the purified ammonium nitrate to precipitate out of the
solution in crystals.  When no more crystals are formed they are removed from
the alcohol.

  The alcohol is then poured back into the other pan and stirred to dissolve
any ammonium nitrate left undissolved.  After setting a few minutes the
solution is again poured off the dregs and the dregs are thrown away.  When
the last batch of crystals is removed, the alcohol can be stored and reused.

  The dry ice is simply frozen carbon dioxide and its fumes are harmless
unless they are enough to replace the air.  Don't handle the dry ice with your
bare hands [unless you are into pulling your skin off to the bone] as its cold
will cause blisters.

  In order for pure ammonium nitrate to be detonated by a dynamite cap, it
must be very dry.  Spread it out under a heat lamp or in thte sun.  When
completely dry, store it in tightly closed plastic bags.


  You got here on just the right day! For a limited time only, we will be
offering this *BONUS* file to you free with the above file.  That's right! Two
files for the price of one! And only from Omnipotent!

  So you don't know what to do with your ammonium nitrate once you've made it.
You're saying to yourself, "Great! Now I have a chemical that is supposed to
blow things up, but I don't want to destroy anything [ahem?]." Well...

                                 LAUGHING GAS
  As a special treat for the dopers in the audience and since ammonium nitrate
has been on your mind for a few minutes, you might as well learn how to make
laughing gas from ammonium nitrate.
  Laughing gas was one of the earliest anaesthetics.  After a little while of
inhaling the gas the patient became so happy [ain't life great?] he couldn't
keep from laughing.  Finally he would drift off to a pleasant sleep.
   Some do-it-yourselfers have died while taking laughing gas.  This is
because they has generated it through plastic bags while their heads were
inside. They were simply suffocating but were too bombed out to realize it.
   The trick is to have a plastic clothes bag in which you generate a lot of
the gas.  Then you stop generating the gas and hold a small opening of the bag
under your nose, getting plenty of oxygen in the meantime.  Then, Whee!
  To make it you start with ammonium nitrate bought from a chemical supply
house or which you have purified with 100% rubbing or wood alcohol.

  First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium nitrate in some water.  Then you
evaporate the water over the stove, while stirring, until you have a heavy
brine.  When nearly all the moisture is out it should solidify instantly when
a drop is put on an ice cold metal plate.

  When ready, dump it all out on a very cold surface.  After a while, break
it up and store it in a bottle.

   A spoonful is put into a flask with a one-hole stopper, with a tube leading
into a big plastic bag.  The flask is heated with an alcohol lamp.

   When the temperature in the flask reaches 480 F the gas will generate.  If
white fumes appear the heat should be lowered as the stuff explodes at 600 F.

  When the bag is filled, stop the action and get ready to turn on.

Addendum 4/12/91:  N2O supplants oxygen in your blood, but you don't realize
it.  It's easy to die from N2O because you're suffocating and your breathing
reflex doesn't know it.  SO:  Do not put your head in a plastic bag (duhh...)
because you will cheerfully choke to death.



BLACK POWDER:GRANDPAS RECIPE   TEXT BY, EL PIRATA'

IF YA WANT TO MAKE SOME LOW EXPLOSIVE BOMBS THEN YOU PICKED THE RIGHT CHOICE!
FIRST OF ALL, THIS RECIPE WILL SHOW HOW TO MAKE BLACK POWDER IN A SIMPLE AND
SAFE MANNER YET HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE SOME STRONG LOW EXPLOSIVE BOMBS.
NOTE: THE BELOW AMOUNTS WILL YIELD TWO POUNDS (THAT'S 900 GRAMS FOR YOU METRIC
USERS) OF BLACK POWDER. HOWEVER, ONLY THE RATIOS OF THE AMOUNTS OF INGREDIENTS
ARE IMPORTANT.  THUS, FOR TWICE AS MUCH BLACK POWDER, DOUBLE ALL QUANTITIES
USED.

                              MATERIAL REQUIRED
large wooden stick                   cloth, 2 ft.  sq.
flat window screening, 1 ft.  sq.    heat source
water, 3 cups                        alcohol, 5 pints (any kind)
sulfer, powdered, 1/2 cup (flowers   wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups
of sulfer, at a drug store)          potassium nitrate, granulatd, 3 cups
2 buckets, both 2 gallon, one must   (saltpeter, at drug stores)
be heat resistant

PROCEDURE:
1.  PLACE ALCOHOL IN ONE OF THE BUCKETS.

2.  PLACE POTASSIUM NITRATE, CHARCOAL, AND SULFUR IN THE HEAT RESISTANT
BUCKET.  ADD 1 CUP WATER AND MIX THOROUGHLY WITH WOODEN STICK UNTIL ALL
INGREDIENTS ARE DISSOLVED.

3.  ADD REMAINING WATER (2 CUPS) TO MIXTURE.  PLACE BUCKET ON HEAT SOURCE AND
STIR UNTIL SMALL BUBBLES BEGIN TO FORM.

CAUTION: DO NOT BOIL MIXTURE.  BE SURE ALL MIXTURE STAYS WET.  IF ANY IS DRY,
AS ON SIDES OF PAN, IT MAY IGNITE.

4.  REMOVE BUCKET FROM HEAT AND POUR MIXTURE INTO ALCOHOL WHILE STIRRING
VIGOROUSLY.

5.  LET ALCOHOL MIXTURE STAND ABOUT 5 MINUTES.  STRAIN MIXTURE THROUGH CLOTH
TO OBTAIN BLACK POWDER. DISCARD LIQUID.  WRAP CLOTH AROUND BLACK POWDER AND
SQUEEZE TO REMOVE ALL EXCESS LIQUID.

6.  PLACE SCREENING OVER DRY BUCKET. PLACE WORKABLE AMOUNT OF DAMP POWDER ON
 SCREEN AND GRANULATE BY RUBBING SOLID THROUGH SCREEN.

NOTE: IF GRANULATED PARTICLES APPEAR TO STICK TOGETHER AND CHANGE SHAPE,
RECOMBINE ENTIRE BATCH OF POWDER AND REPEAT STEPS 5 AND 6.

7.  SPREAD GRANULATED BLACK POWDER ON FLAT DRY SURFACE SO THAT LAYER ABOUT 1/2
INCH IS FORMED.  ALLOW TO DRY.  USE RADIATOR, OR DIRECT SUNLIGHT.  THIS SHOULD
BE DRIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY IN ONE HOUR.  THE LONGER THE DRYING
PERIOD, THE LESS EFFECTIVE THE BLACK POWDER.

CAUTION: REMOVE FROM HEAT AS SOON AS GRANULES ARE DRY.  BLACK POWDER IS NOW
READY FOR USE!

   EXPEDIENT GRENADES  The Cheshire Cat

   There are many possibilities in the field of grenade manufacture, but for
the most part, when you're dealing with grenades that must  be constructed of
easily available materials, the quality and the  safety of the grenade is
reduced dramatically.

  Here I will deal  with this problem, trying to produce a reasonable type of
grenade  that is relatively safe, can be stored and transported easily, but
produces dramatic effects.  I strongly suggest that if you find it  possible,
you are far better off getting a REAL grenade than trying  to produce one
yourself, but you can be the judge.  As always, I  want to note that this is
all for educational purposes only, and I  do not recommend anyone trying any
of the following for real.

    The first thing you need is explosives.  If you can't get black powder, or
gun powder, or make your own plastic explosives  (we know there sure are
enough text files floating around to explain  how to make all of the above!)
than you're really in a for making a  grenade of this type.

  You'll also need a coffee can, a smaller sized  can (probably like an orange
juice can, or V8), a coat hanger, and a  fuse.  As for explosives, mercury
fulminate is extremely good  for this sort of thing.

 You could probably get together a ton  of firecrackers and take out the black
powder (if you're desperate)  or get a couple quarter sticks from someone.
The explosive goes in the juice can.  Don't pack  it together too tight.
Loose black powder is better than compressed.   This is the main explosive.

 Cut up the coat hanger into little  pieces approximately 1/2" long and fill
up the coffee can until you  can put the juice can in and the top of the juice
can is level with  the top of the coffee can.  If you don't have the time, and
need to  fill up the space faster, chuck in a couple small rocks or pieces of
glass, and stuff like that until you have the bottom of the can filled.

  Now place the juice can in the coffee can, and center it.  Then fill  the
space around the coffee can with coat hanger stuff until the juice  can is
relatively stable.  Put a model rocket fuse in the explosive in  the juice
can.  Leave (at least) 3 1/2" to light from.  If necessary, secure the juice
can or the explosive with some masking tape, ect... as long as it doesn't
interfere with the action of the grenade.

 Take  the lid of the coffee can and cut a hole so that the fuse is exposed.
You now have a fragmentation grenade.  It might be a good idea to  practice
with a football for a while before trying to destroy the  neighbor's garage
with it.

          How to Counterfeit       Written by The Wave
 
  This article deals with how to make counterfeit money.  Before reading this
article it would be a very good idea to get a book about photo-offset
printing, for that's how you'll have to print it.  For someone who is familiar
with offset printing, printing money is a breeze.  Real money is made by a
process called gravure.  It involves carving out of a metal block (but I don't
think anyone can do that by hand-if you can, you should be on That's
Incredible!).  When you are done (if you did everything correctly) you will
have a finished product nearly identical to real money, depending on your
printing skills.  Well, let's get started!

  First I'd like to tell you briefly how offset printing works.  It starts by
making negatives (kind of like when you take a picture with your camera).
Then you take the negatives and put them on a piece of masking material (
usually orange).  Then you expose the STRIPPED negatives or FLATS to a
lithographic plate with an arc light plate maker.  The BURNED plates are then
developed with the proper developer chemical.  These plates (one at a time of
course) are wrapped around the plate cylinder of the press.  The press to use
should be an 11 by 14 (or so) offset such as the 11 by 17 AB Dick 360.  Then
the printing begins! To learn in detail how to do each of these steps you
should again get a book on the subject.  The presswork takes some practice,
but you'll get the hang of it.
 
    BTW you can
pick up an 11 by 14 offset for about $500 if you shop around (or you can **
BORROW ** a press from your local Insty Prints at about 3:00 in the morning!).
First, like I said before, you need negatives.  Make 2 negatives of the
portrait side of the bill and 1 of the back side.  After developing them and
letting them dry, take them to a light table.  Get some opaque and, on one of
the portrait sides, touch out all the green (the seal and the serial numbers).
Line that one up on the FLAT and leave about 1/2 inch from the top of the
flat.  Then for the other portrait, touch out everything BUT the seal and
serial numbers.  The back side doesn't require any retouching because it is
all one color.

  Now, make sure all the negatives are lined up right, or REGISTERED, on the
flats.  By the way, every time you need another serial number, just shoot 1
neg.  of the portrait side and cut out the serial number. Cut out the old
serial number from the flat and replace it with the new one. Ok, now you have
3 flats, each represents a different color-black and 2 shades of green (which
of course are made by mixing inks).  Now you are ready to burn the plates.
Take a lithographic plate and mark 3 marks on it.  These marks must be 2 &
9/16 in.  apart, starting on one of the short edges.

  Do the same thing to 2 more plates.  Then take 1 of the flats and place it
on the plate, lining the short edge up with the edge of the plate-EXACTLY!
Burn it, move it up to the next mark, and cover up the exposed area you
already burned.  Burn that and do the same thing 2 more times-moving the flat
up one mark.  Then do the same process with the other 2 flats (each on a
separate plate).  Develope all 3 plates.  You should have 4 images on each
plate with an equal space between each bill.


                              Roll the Presses!
 
  The paper you will need won't match exactly, but you can make it pretty damn
close (close enough for the cashier at K-Mart!).  The paper to use should have
a 25% rag content.  I have found that Disaperf computer paper works great -
that's the kind that you can barely see the perforation.  Take this paper (cut
the pinfeed holes off first!) and load it into the press.  Be sure to set the
air, buckle, and paper thickness right.

 Start with the black plate (the one with out the serial numbers).  Wrap it
around the cylinder and load black ink in.  Make sure you run more than you
need because there will be a lot of rejects.  Then, while that's printing, mix
the inks for the serial #'s and the back side.  You'll need to add some white
and maybe yellow to the serial # ink. You need to add black to back side.
Experiment till you get it right.  Clean the press and print the other side.
Now you have the bill with no green seal or serial numbers.  Print a few with
one serial number, make another and repeat. Keep doing this until you have as
many different numbers as you want.

  Then cut the bills to the exact size with a paper cutter Now you have a lot
of money, except there is still one problemo - the paper is pure white.  To
dye it, mix the following in a pan: 2 cups hot water, 4 tea bags, and about
16-20 drops of green food coloring (experiment).  Dip one of The bills in and
compare it to a brand new REAL bill.  Make the necessary adjustments, and dye
all the bills.  Then it is a good idea to make them look used.  Wrinkle them,
rub coffee grinds on them, etc.  Congratulations! You're rich!
 
  Some of the info was taken from The Poor Man's James Bond, but most from
personal knowledge.  Also, it would be a good idea to see the movie To Live
and Die in L.A.  It is about a counterfeiter and they did a good job of
showing how to do it.  Well, that's all folks!

Addendum 4/12/91:

     I have heard that there are several methods of detecting CONTERFEIT
money. First, most green ink flouresces under UV light. Second, some money
verifiers sold use MAGNETIC ink and INFRARED detection to tell if the money
is real.

  I do NOT know what the pattern used is, if anybody does, send E-mail.


 HOMEMADE GUNS from  "The Poor Man's James Bond"

                              PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS

    Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have been used for years
by juvenile punks.  Today's Militants   make them just for the hell of it or
to shoot once in an   assassination or riot and throw away if there is any
danger of apprehension.

    They can be used many times but with some, a length of dowel is needed to
force out the spent shell.

    There are many variations but the illustration shows the basic design.

    First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for the barrel to rest
in.  The barrel is then taped securely to the stock with a good, strong
tape.

    The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is punched in the trigger
flap to hold a roofing nail, which is wired or soldered onto the flap.  The
trigger is bent and nailed to the stock on both sides.

    The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas or water pipe
with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet keeps the cartridge rim from passing
through the pipe.

    The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a hole bored through
it, is screwed on.  Then the trigger is slowly released to let the nail pass
through the hole and   rest on the primer.

    To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand and held back with
the thumb of the right hand.  The gun is then aimed and the thumb releases the
trigger and the thing actually fires.

    Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in any hardware store.
All caliber bullets, from the .22 to the .45 are used in such guns.

    Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested within each other.
For instance, a .22 shell will fit snugly into a length of a car's copper gas
line. Unfortunatey, the copper is too weak to withstand the pressure of the
firing.  So the length of gas line is spread   with glue and pushed into a
wider length of pipe.  This is   spread with glue and pushed into a length of
steel pipe with threads and a cap.

    Using this method, you can accomodate any cartridge, even a rifle shell.
The first size of pipe for a rifle   shell accomodates the bullet.  The second
accomodates its wider powder chamber.

    A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel pipe.  If you want to
comply with the gun laws, the barrel should be at least eighteen inches long.

    Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol. It naturally has
a longer stock and its handle is lengthened into a rifle butt.  Also, a small
nail is driven half way into each side of the stock about four inches in the
front of the trigger.  The rubber band is put over one nail and   brought
around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

    In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it before firing it
by hand.  This is done by first tying the gun to a tree or post, pointed to
where it will do no damage.  Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go
off several yards.  The string is then pulled back and let go. If the barrel
does not blow up, the gun is (probably) safe to fire by hand.


Astrolite and Sodium Chlorate Explosives By: Future Spy & The Fighting Falcon

Note: Information on the Astrolite Explosives were taken from the book
 'Two Component High Explosive Mixtures' By Desert Pub'l

Some of the chemicals used are somewhat toxic, but who gives a fuck! Go ahead!
I won't even bother mentioning 'This information is for enlightening purposes
only'! I would love it if everyone made a gallon of astrolite and blew their
fucking school to kingdom scum!

                                  Astrolite

The astrolite family of liquid explosives were products of rocket propellant
research in the '60's.  Astrolite A-1-5 is supposed to be the world's most
powerful non-nuclear explosive -at about 1.8 to 2 times more powerful than
TNT. Being more powerful it is also safer to handle than TNT (not that it
isn't safe in the first place) and Nitroglycerin.

                                 Astrolite G
"Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to produce very
high detonation velocity, 8,600MPS (meters/sec.), compared with 7,700MPS for
nitroglycerin and 6,900MPS for TNT...In addition, a very unusual
characteristic is that it the liquid explosive has the ability to be absorbed
easily into the ground while remaining detonatable...In field tests, Astrolite
G has remained detonatable for 4 days in the ground, even when the soil was
soaked due to rainy weather" know what that means?....Astrolite Dynamite!

              To make (mix in fairly large container & outside)
    Two parts by weight of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by weight
'anhydrous' hydrazine, produces Astrolite G...Simple enough eh? I'm sure that
the 2:1 ratio is not perfect,and that if you screw around with it long enough,
that you'll find a better formula.  Also, dunno why the book says 'anhydrous'
hydrazine, hydrazine is already anhydrous...

    Hydrazine is the chemical you'll probably have the hardest time getting
hold of. Uses for Hydrazine are: Rocket fuel, agricultural chemicals (maleic
hydra-zide), drugs (antibacterial and antihypertension), polymerization
catalyst, plating metals on glass and plastics, solder fluxes, photographic
developers, diving equipment.  Hydrazine is also the chemical you should be
careful with.

                              Astrolite A/A-1-5
Mix 20% (weight) aluminum powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then mix with
hydrazine.  The aluminum powder should be 100 mesh or finer.  Astrolite A has
a detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.

                                 Misc.  info
You should be careful not to get any of the astrolite on you,if it happens
though, you should flush the area with water.  Astrolite A&G both should be
able to be detonated by a #8 blasting cap.


                           Sodium Chlorate Formulas

Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate,and in most cases can be a
substitute.  Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water.  You can find
sodium chlorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store.  It is used
in blowtorches and you can get about 3lbs for about $6.00.

                          Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder

65% sodium chlorate, 22% charcoal, 13% sulfur, sprinkle some graphite on top.

                                 Rocket Fuel
6 parts sodium chlorate mixed *THOROUGHLY* with 5 parts rubber cement.

                      Rocket Fuel 2 (better performance)

50% sodium chlorate, 35% rubber cement ('One-Coat' brand),
10% epoxy resin hardener, 5% sulfur

You may want to add more sodium chlorate depending on the purity you are using.

                              Incendiary Mixture
55% aluminum powder (atomized), 45% sodium chlorate, 5% sulfur

                                Impact Mixture
50% red phosphorus, 50% sodium chlorate

Unlike potassium chlorate,sodium chlorate won't explode spontaneously when
mix- ed with phosphorus.  It has to be hit to be detonated.

                               Filler explosive
85% sodium chlorate, 10% vaseline, 5% aluminum powder

                            Nitromethane formulas
I thought that I might add this in since it's similar to Astrolite.

Nitromethane (CH3NO2)              specific gravity:1.139
flash point:95f                    auto-ignite:785f

Derivation: reaction of methane or propane with nitric acid under pressure.
Uses:       Rocket fuel; solvent for cellulosic compounds, polymers, waxes,
fats, etc.

To be detonated with a #8 cap, add:

1) 95% nitromethane + 5% ethylenediamine 2) 94% nitromethane + 6% aniline

Power output: 22-24% more powerful than TNT.  Detonation velocity of 6,200MPS.

                       Nitromethane 'solid' explosives
2 parts nitromethane, 5 parts ammonium nitrate (solid powder)

soak for 3-5 min.  when done,store in an air-tight container.  This is
supposed to be 30% more powerful than dynamite containing 60% nitro-glycerin,
and has 30% more brilliance.

 The Firey Explosive Pen   Written by Blue Max of Anarchist-R-Us

 Materials Needed                       Here's a GREAT little trick to play on
 1] One Ball Point `Click` pen          your best fiend (no thats not a typo) at
 2] Gun Powder                          skool, or maybe as a practial joke on a
 3] 8 or 10 match heads                 friend!
 4] 1 Match stick
 5] a sheet of sand paper (1 1/2" X 2")

1] Unscrew pen and remove all parts but leave the button in the top.
2] Stick the match stick in the part of the pen clicker where the other little
  parts and the ink fill was.
3] Roll sand paper up and put around the match stick that is in the clicker.
4] Put the remaining Match Heads inside the pen, make sure that they are on
   the inside on the sand paper.
5] Put a small piece of paper or something in the other end of the pen where
  the ball point comes out.
6] Fill the end with the piece of paper in it with gun powder.  The paper is
  to keep the powder from spilling.

The Finished pen should look like this:

     HOW TO BLOW UP A CAR: A different way      by THE FLYING HERMIT

  There are times in a man's life when he gets mad at someone.  And then there
are times when he gets REAL mad at someone.  These are the times for vengence.
And what better way to get back at someone than damaging his/her car.  The
thing which s/he has saved up for, worked hard for, and paid for.
   Yes!!! This is the item which you must attack, for most of the time, it is
parked outside, easily accesible at night and very important to the asshole
you want to annoy.  The method I will describe is relatively easy and safe to
set up, but very effective in causing damage.  The method of destruction will
be explosion.  The explosive device is already inside the car, factory
installed just for you to use.  It is the standard 12 volt car battery.

Let's look at the princleple behind the exploding battery:

You are by now familiar with the theory of how batteries work, and if you
aren't, your probably too young to be thinking of these sorts of things.
Anyway, within the battery, is not only a current flowing from positive to
negative (actually, it is from negative to positive, but that's another
story), but also a small internal resistance.  The resistance inside the
battery is in the order of magnitude of roughly .0024 OHM, an amount so small,
it is usually ignored. But, that is for normal operation of the battery.  The
case we're interrested in is for the closed circuit of the battery by itself.
For a closed circuit, the internal resistance becomes a big deal, and the
following holds true:
                      12volt/.0024 ohm = 5000 amps
   Amazing!!!!! by causing a short circuit (closed circuit), the battery
produces 5000 amps of current running through that little bugger.  However,
this current is short lived, and the battery cannot handle this capacity for
long, so therefore the battery explodes.  It explodes with a rather large
force, causing considerable damage from the pressure, flames, and hurling
lead.  All these goodies combined with the volatile liquids hidden inside the
engine will cause the vehicle to add another member to the big junk yard in
the sky.
   Great!! now we know how to make the car blow up, but we don't want to go up
with hte car, so what we need is a triggering device.  one can go from the
simple to elaborate, by incorporating sophisticated devices such as radio
transmitters, but for our purposes, we will opt for a simple timer and relay
device.
      First, we will need some heavy cable, capable of handling the massive
current without melting, then we will need a relay also able to cope with
large currents.  Next, we need a timer which will count down the seconds to
our triuphant vengance.  And finally, a small battery to run the relay (the
small battery will run both the relay and the timer if you are using a digital
timer).  Now: Connect the small battery to the timer, the timer to the relay,
and the relay to the car battery.  Connect the heavy duty relay to the the car
battery with the heavy cable.  There you have it!!!!

remember, tinkering with other people's property is a no-no, and officer
friendly might get ugly with you if he sees you doing this, so be forewarned.
Also, car batteries are dangerous to play with, and if handled improperly, may
explode unintentionally, causing the concentrated acid to spray in your face,
making you look like the elephant man.  so don't come crying to me when
something happens, cause i'll just laugh at you and possibly urinate over you
if you rub me the wrong way.

 A milk carton bomb is relitively simple and safe.  It's only purpose it to
create a loud noise.

 The ingredients needed to make this are few and easy to aquire.  You will
need a plastic milk carton, lighter fluid(type used in cigarette lighters), a
piece of paper, and a pair of chopsticks.  If you can not obtain chop sticks,
it's okay to substitute them with something that can hold the paper and is
long enough so that you won't be harmed by the flames.

 After acquiring all of the ingredients, you can now start to make the bomb.
The procedure is easy.  First, puncture a hole at the bottom of the milk
carton with a screw driver or equivalent.  Next fill one-fourth of the milk
carton with lighter fluid.

  Place the milk carton in a fairly large area outisde.  Hold a piece of paper
between the chopsticks and light the paper with a match.  Cautiously place the
lighted paper under the hole of the carton and BOOM! You have your loud
explosion with little damage to the surrounding area.  It would be a good idea
to have some water handy to extinguish any flames.

 Be careful when doing this and have fun.
