  POKELIST - September 1992 Release

  Compiled by Peter Monk

  Games Covered: 137


  In order to use these pokes, you must have an Action replay cartridge.
  Plug in the cartridge, load up the game, and press the red FREEZE
  button while the game is running.  Type in either "M" followed by the
  the line number given and press <Return>.  A line of numbers will appear.
       
  Change the first two in the row so that it reads "FF", then press
  <Return> then <Escape>.  Now press <X> and <Return> to exit back into 
  the game with the cheat activated.

  Apparently, some games write the Lives, Energy, Money etc. to a different
  address every time the game is loaded, so if you find that on loading 
  your game at a later date that nothing happens when you type in your
  cheat, this will be the reason and you will have to start over finding
  the Lives etc.  Hopefully all the cheats below are set addresses, as they
  have not all been checked.
  
  If any part of this list is used for any purpose, please give credit
  where credit is due.
