  CheatList -- September 1992 release

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Welcome to the September release of CheatList.

  CheatList is a collection of various forms of help (cheats, hints, codes,
  etc.) for Amiga games.  At 480 kilobytes in length (uncompressed), it is
  the biggest compilation I know of.  

  The main difference in this release is that the List is now two files,
  A-K, and L-Z.  Until I buy some more RAM chips it's going to stay
  that way.  The main disadvantage with this is that if you are looking at,
  say, the L-Z file and you want to look up a game starting with `D', you
  have to exit one file and load up the other.  Still, some people might
  prefer it this way.  Please write in with your opinions. 

  ***************************** ATTENTION *******************************

  The shareware system has changed for the List!  Check out the new
  Distribution file for details!

  ***********************************************************************

  The files on disk are displayed using Megaview, a terrific text and IFF
  picture displayer program written by Jonathan Potter.  To load a file,
  you merely have to double-click on its icon on the workbench screen. 
  See the Fullview.Doc for more info'.  (Fullview is the doc file from
  MegaView's predecessor, and is thus the closest thing to a doc file.)
  All future releases of the disk will be set up to run from either two
  floppy drives or a hard disk.

  Also on this disk is a file called CL_Survey.  This is a survey which
  you can (if you wish) fill out, print out and send to me (Peter) to give
  me some idea how users would like to see CheatList set up.  You can also
  offer some suggestions of your own if you feel they would improve the
  look or "user-friendliness" of the list.  Also included is PokeList, a 
  list similar to CheatList but containing pokes useable by those who own
  an Action Replay cartridge.  In the last release (June) there were 86 
  games covered in this new list.  Now about 125 games are covered.

  Lastly, I have made CheatList Shareware.  Spending over $400 on computer
  magazines has enabled me to provide you with one of the largest (if not
  THE largest) and most comprehensive compilations of games help in the
  world.  However, it is not only the $400 figure that gives the list its
  value.  It is a good thing to have in your collection a compilation such
  as this, and knowing that it is able to provide you with reliable help
  for many of the games that you may buy in your computer-owning life.
  CheatList not only gives you the cheats, but also tells you if they have
  been tested and proven, and in many cases gives you alternative cheats
  to try if the first one fails.

  CheatList is not a one-off effort: it is being constantly updated, and 
  is released every few months with many new games being added each time.
  For example, between last release and this release, about 50 new games 
  were added.  So show your appreciation of the huge amounts of time I put
  into the list (CheatList has been well over a year and a half in the 
  making) and register.  This also allows you updates in the future.
  Again, check out the Distribution file for more info.

  CheatList is now just about the biggest collection of purely Amiga games
  help in the world, and getting bigger every day.  And with updates to 
  those who register, CheatList is now even better value.
  
  You can also send any cheats, etc, that you have come across, and I will
  publish your name in the next release of CheatList, and also mention how 
  it was you helped CheatList improve in quantity and quality (registra-
  tion, cheat, complete solution, set of codes, survey, suggestions, etc).
  Please though, no deliberately fake data - I would like people to be
  able to rely on CheatList.
