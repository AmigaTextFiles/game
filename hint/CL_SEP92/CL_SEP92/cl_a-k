  CHEATLIST - September 1992 Release

  CheatList - The Ultimate Games Help Compilation for the Amiga
  Compiled by Peter Monk


  Games Covered: 500
  Games Verified: 71
  Complete Solutions: 38


  The asterisk (*) after the name of the game means that the cheat
  for that game has been verified - ie, it works.  If it is not marked
  as verified, it doesn't mean it won't work - it just means that I have
  been unable to test the cheat.  Some of these cheats will not work,
  because of the number of people this information has passed through -
  the cheats may be altered a little bit each time, and pretty soon you
  have a lot of cheats that don't really work, but I have attempted to
  discover if these cheats do work, and have passed this information on
  to you.  If you discover that a cheat here, which is not shown as
  verified, does work, please write in and tell me!

  If you are after a cheat for a game, and you look up the name of the
  game on the index and it says, for eg, "THE RUNNING MAN (Complete Sol-
  ution", it means that, while a complete solution is listed, there may
  also be a cheat, codes, etc. listed as well.  So, if a game is indexed
  as having a complete solution but you want a cheat, have a look anyway,
  because there may well be one!

  Many cheat compilations are merely many files copied on to one disc
  and are usually difficult to follow because of the varying styles of
  writing and different layouts of the text.  I have typed a lot of this
  480 K. file out myself, and what I have imported I have totally re-
  formatted and in many cases, corrected spelling and grammatical errors
  and improved the layout.  Cheatlist has been over a year in the making
  (so far - it is being constantly updated) and I'd like to think that my
  efforts are appreciated by the millions of people who enjoy playing
  games on this wonderful machine.  So please, if you do use and value
  Cheatlist, a small ($10-$20 Australian suggested) donation would
  definately not go to waste.  Please support shareware!

  If you discover any cheats for a game, or have any hints, etc, please
  write in and unless you do not wish to be mentioned I will credit the
  cheat, etc, to your name in the next release.  However, please don't
  submit information that you know is false, because I would like people
  to be able to rely on CheatList.

  ANOTHER WORLD (Complete Solution)

  First note that there are three ways of working the gun:

  * A single quick press will fire a thin beam for breaking ropes,
    disconnecting cables and killing enemy personnel.

  * Hold down the fire button until an energy ball appears then let
    go and a shield will form.  This stops laser shots.

  * Hold down the button until the energy ball swells and begins to
    hum.  Then let go and you will fire a big beam.


  And now, the Solution:


  Get out of the water to begin with!

  Level One - Code: EDJI

  Go left and take note of the vine.
  Go right past the water.
  Here are a number of worm-like creatures - kick them to kill them.
  Go right - more worms.
  Kick these as well, but watch for the worms that drop from the roof.
  Go right until you encounter a big black beastie.
  Now turn and run back to the screen with the hanging vine.
  Take a running jump at the vine - don't stop or you'll die!
  Jump off the vine when it breaks and run right.
  Keep running until you get to the screen where you first met the beast.

  Level 2 - Code: HICI

  You wake up in a cage with an alien for company.
  Rock the cage left and right until it drops.
  Pick up the gun.
  Run right, protecting your alien friend by shooting the guards.
  Use the shield to protect the alien while he opens the door.
  Now follow him through the door, to the lift.
  Go down to the bottom level.
  Go to the end and shoot out the small flashing light on the wall.
  Take the lift to the next level up.
  Blast the door, run and jump up.
  Wait for the alien, then open the door and walk in.

  Level 3 - Code: FLLD

  Into the small tunnels underground:
  Go left, Drop down.
  Go right, Drop down.
  Go right, Drop down.
  Go left, Drop down.
  Go right, Drop down.

  Level 4 - Code: LIBC

  Go left through the door and charge your gun.
  Go right, then blast through three doors.
  Run right to the exit.
  Kill the guard then walk to the edge of the broken bridge.
  Leap onto the lower right ledge.
  Blast a hole in the wall and go through it.

  Level 5 - Code: CCAL

  Go right and down the first shaft.
  Go right again then down onto the large rock.
  Jump right, then go right and jump over the spiked pit.
  Walk to the next screen, wait for the large rock to crash to the floor.
  (Don't forget to dodge the flying creature!)
  When two rocks fall and hit the floor together, run!
  Repeat this on the next screen.
  Beware of the tentacles (they can be shot, or you can run past them).
  Go right - You'll find more tentacles as well as some snapping traps.
  Jump over the traps, continue right to the end and blast the wall.

  Level 6 - Code: EDIL

  Go back to the screen with the falling rocks.
  Walk up the slope, turn around and shoot at the flying creature.
  Walk on to the next screen and watch!
  Take a running jump at the stalactite, climb on top of it and jump on
   to the next one from there.
  Repeat this procedure with all of them.
  If you do all this correctly you should end up on a large rock.

  Level 7 - Code: FADK

  Walk left off the rock, turn and blast the rock, then walk up the rock.
  Go right, jump over two pits, then one pit.
  Walk right, blast the wall to let in the water, then turn and run
   like buggery!  (don't forget to jump over the pits, though!)
  Go right and blast the wall.
  Now go past the steps and across the dried up waterfall.

  Level 8 - Code: KCIJ

  Observe the alien trapped below.
  Exit left over the waterfall and go through the door.
  Go down the steps, walk right and kill the guard.
  Go back up the steps and shoot at the light chain (this releases the
   alien above).
  Go back down the steps and run right as far as you can go.
  Kick the guard, then run and pick up the gun.
  Kill the guard and run right
  Ignore the guards here!

  Level 9 - Code: ICAH

  Dive into the water, swim across, climb out and have a look around.
  Swim down to the hole in the wall, left along the tunnel, and up into
   the second shaft for a breath of air.
  Swim right down to the bottom of the shaft, go right, get out for some
   air, and fire at the pulsating line.
  Now reverse these moves to go back to the pool surface.

  Level 10 - Code: FIEI

  Go left and kill the guard.
  Go right, up the stairs, and kill the guard on the left at the top of
   the stairs.
  Jump across right, blast the two doors down, and get your blaster ready
   to fire at the last door as the protective shield fades.
  Accurate timing and speed are needed to kill the guard.
  (Alternatively you can blast the last door, shield, jump the fireballs,
   then kill the guard).
  Go right, blast the door, then go right again.
  Jump up to recharge your gun, then go right.
  Watch the reflection of the guard on the bottom of the green sphere.
  Fire at the sphere when the guard's reflection is directly under it.
  Go left to the stairs, down the stairs, then down and right to the pool.
  Swim across and get out to find the guard dead.
  Go right.

  Level 11 - Code: LALD

  Jump down the opening, go right and blast the door.
  Run to the end of the corridor.
  Turn and put up a shield, then wait until the alien puts his arm down
   and pulls you up.
  Stay on the left side of the opening until the rocks fall, then follow
   the alien into the tank.
  To escape, press the top left-hand green button.
  (But you may wish to have some fun by pressing a few others first!)

  Level 12 - Code: LFEK

  Exit from the pod, run right onto the next screen and kill the guards.
  Now run right.
  Sit back and leave the machine in drive.
  Crawl across the floor to the levers on the right and wait for the
   guard to walk towards you.
  Pull the lever to kill the guard with the laser.
  Now pull the second lever, and crawl back to the light circle on the
   floor to escape from Another World!



  ANT HEADS (ICFTD 2) (Complete Solution)

  Here is what is hopefully a complete solution to this game!  (It Came
  From The Desert 2).

  DAY 1

  Gather as much information from Biff and Dusty on the first day, but if
  you've got the information from previous games then don't worry, as it
  doesn't change.
  Get into your car and go to the KBUG radio station.  Dusty will tell you
  of the latest ant attack to occur and will give you a Geiger counter and
  a gun.
  Hang around for a while until the afternoon, then go round to the Platt
  University lab, where you will meet the boy Billy and his rather strange
  father.  When they start talking to you, ignore the gibberish that his
  dad speaks but listen carefully to what Billy has to say.
  If you want further information then try asking the fortune tellers and
  expect to get home around eight o'clock.

  DAY 2

  Go out to the KBUG radio station again, where Dusty will tell you about
  a threat from the G-men.  Go back to the lab afterwards, where Billy once
  again provides some useful information.
  At about one o'clock go to Neptune Hall, where you'll find that Billy
  Bob has managed to sprout a rather fetching set of antennae.  Pull out
  your gun and blast his antennae off.  When he comes around he will give
  you an important number, so make a note of it.

  DAY 3

  You should wake up at nine o'clock when Jakie comes round and knocks on
  the door.  Unfortunately, your early morning visitor is one of the Ant-
  heads, so get the trusty old gun working and write down the number again.
  Go to the Ore Plant and befriend the manager by selecting choice A at
  the appropriate time.  Take the train to section M-3 and do the business
  against the ants, then get back to the lab for some more useful info from
  Billy.
  Go to the Police Station and get the old 'he must have tripped on his
  shoelace, your honour' treatment so you get knocked unconscious.  When you
  wake up, the nurse will give you the position of the vault.  Go to the
  vault and get the records containing the conversion process, then make a
  run for it.

  DAY 4

  Drop by Elma's and when he becomes an Anthead blast his stalk to get
  the last number.  Now you have all three numbers, try and get into the
  hospital any way you can (preferably without injury).  Get the lift to the
  basement and find the morgue in the top right-hand corner - you can spot
  it by the four black slabs and the safe.  Enter the numbers in the order
  you recieved them and you should be able to get the secret documents which
  will cause the realisation of the Antheads' existence, so now you can take
  them on face-to-face.



  APB

  Type your name in as `ALF' on the high scores screen for infinte
  demerits.



  APPRENTICE

  Press <Tab> and try one of the following passwords: DRUID, WIZARDS,
  SPELLS, or FAERIE.



  ARCHIPELAGOS

  When you are asked to select an Archipelago, choose 8421 and press
  <Return> twice.  Now you should be able to select any island from 1 to
  9999.



  ARKANOID (*)

  Press <Space Bar> to pause the game and type in "DSIMAGIC".  Press the
  <Space Bar> again and catch the yellow "DS" capsule that falls from
  the centre of the screen.  You can now call up the laser turrent and
  the other powers by pressing the appropriate letter on the keyboard
  (See table below).  Pressing `F' will transport you to the final
  screen where you confront Doh.  Alternatively, for an extra 33 levels
  of play, press <F3> instead of <F1> for a one player game, or <F4>
  instead of <F2> for a two player game.

  <B> - Break        (Opens gates and awards bonus points)
  <C> - Catch        (Holds ball)
  <D> - Disruption   (Split into 3 balls)
  <E> - Expand       (Makes Vaus larger)
  <L> - Laser        (Gives you a laser used with mouse button)

  Complete solution when you solve this [or any other!] game.)



  BARBARIAN (Palace)

  On the final level where you confront Drax, walk forward, and when the
  first fireball comes, jump, then do a forward roll into him.



  BARBARIAN (Psygnosis) (*)

  While playing, type in "04-08-59" and you should be indestructable.  If
  the background goes grey it has worked.  The bow behind the Tin Man is
  a fake.  To kill the final Wizard, you must have a shield.  When his
  shot comes at you, use the defense icon, and it will fly back at him.



  BARBARIAN 2 (Complete Solution)

  This is the Barbarian 2 that is the sequel to the `Palace' version of
  Barbarian (see above).  I'm not sure, but there may or not be two games
  called Barbarian 2 - a sequel for the Palace game and a sequel for the
  Psygnosis game.  Anyway, here it is:

  Level One

  Repeated use of the heap chop is the most effective tactic against the
  neanderthal man, but make sure you take a step back between  hits.  Stay
  low to survive against the Sauron beast - if you don't you'll lose your
  head.  Chopping is the best tactic here, but step back between each
  strike, Use the low chop against the Mutant chicken, but wait until it's
  standing up right before you let loose.

  Level Two

  The orc pushes you against the wall.  Use repeated head chops to kill
  him.  Counter his stabbing manoevre with a low chop.  When the crab comes
  near, kick at it and then low chop it.  If you miss take a step back and
  try again.  Carnivores are killed with the chop, except when they leap
  at you - then a high chop is needed.  The stinger can only be killed by
  repeated high chopping - everything else is useless.

  Level Three

  Escape the grabbing tentacle by leaping the pit as it withdraws.
  Floating eyes can only be killed with a high chop - every other move has
  no effect.  The Dungeon Master is the toughest creature of all.  If he
  punches at you, low chop him and if he kicks use the high chop.  When he
  is approaching, try a flying neck chop - that'll kill him in one go.

  Level Four

  The first monster may seem formidable but he is really easily dealt with.
  Just turn around and walk backwards into it, so you can push your way
  onto the next screen.  This manoevre costs you energy but not as much as
  you would  have lost fighting the beast head on.  The great demon is
  next.  Begin this bout with a flying neck chop and follow it up with a
  low chop.  If you miss first them, retreat quickly to get out of his
  range and repeat.  In a similar fashion to the orgianal Barbarian game,
  the final confrontation is with Drax himself.  The place to stand is
  directly in front of the hanging corpse on the wall.  From here you're
  in a perfect position to execute a flying neck chop - the only move that
  will finish the job.



  BARDS TALE

  The mad gods name is Tarjan.  To kill the crystal golem, first find the
  magic sword.  Put your magician at the front of the party and have him
  cast ANMAR before taking on the Grey Dragon, as this will lessen the
  damage done by the dragons breath.

  Alternatively, try this sneaky move:

  Load your party, go to the statistics screen for the first player.  Pool
  all of the party's' gold to the first player, then remove him from the
  party, and then load him back in.  Then pool the gold to another player.
  Repeat this for each player.



  BARDS TALE 2

  Teleport from the Maze of Dread entry stairs to 1 down, 15 north, 10
  east to find the sword of Zar.  Tell the riddler "DER".  Say "KAZDEK"
  to wake up the Kazdek.  Get the item of Kazdek and the master key to
  make it through to the fortress.  If your tired of waiting for morning
  to come enter and exit the guild.  Find a band of illusiosists and kill
  off the front line, have your caster conjure DISRUPT ILLUSION, you will
  keep disbelieving and gaining expierence.



  BARDS TALE 3

  You will need a wineskin or canteen to get past Valerian's tower.
  Learn the Gill spell from the fisherman then go to the lake behind his
  hut, go in to the lake to get to the Crystal Palace, then find the room
  with the Elixir of Life in it.  Put water on the acorn by the tower,
  then a tree will grow, lifting the stone slab and providing you with a
  means of getting the Nightlance.  For a bit of fun, tell the guard at
  the Mad Gods temple "HAMBURGER".



  BATMAN THE CAPED CRUSADER (Complete Solution)

  Compilers Note: I assume this is the solution for the "The Caped
  Crusader" game, as it IS for a batman game, and it IS NOT for the
  "The Movie" game!

  Move right, pick up the disk and carry on right to the end of the
  corridor.  Go down through the door, continue right and collect the
  key and badge.  Move left until you get to the spanner, pick it up,
  use it and then drop it.  Continue left and collect the grenade, then
  go right and up through the door.  Go right until you reach the room
  captioned `Insert the disk' and use the disk.  Go up through the door
  and leave the cave.

  Move right until you get to the ladder and climb it, collect the banana
  which you can eat to replenish your energy.
  Return to street level and go right (show the badge to the policeman
  and continue right!) to collect the Batrope.  If you hit the Penguin's
  men with your Batarang eight times they will drop a packet of crisps
  which you can eat to increase your energy.

  Go left and collect the sweet (this, like the banana restores all your
  energy).  Carry on left and climb the ladder, move right until you get
  to the torch, pick it up and go back right until you get to the ladder.
  Return to street level and go right, collect the trainers and carry on
  to the warehouse ladder.  Climb the ladder and go right till you get
  to the door, use the key and drop it then enter the warehouse.  Go left
  to the end of the corridor and through the door, go right and then enter
  through the door.  Move right until you get to the room called `Shadows
  everywhere' and go through the door.  Go left and collect the bread, then
  right till you reach the dead end.  Use the grenade to blast the wall and
  go through the door.  Go right and up through the door, carry on to the
  end of the corridor and through the door.  Continue right till you get
  to the room called `Getting you down' and use the Batrope.  Walk left
  and collect the lift key, now use the trainers.

  Move right and up through the door, go right and then down through the
  door.  Go left and down through the door and use the torch.  Go right,
  up through the door and left, collect the dart and go back to the place
  where you landed when you dropped in on the Batrope and use the lift key
  on the lift, drop the key and go through the door and along the corridor
  until you reach the room called `Shadows everywhere'.

  Go through to door and left and throw the dart at the dartboard and pick
  up the passcard.  Leave the warehouse and go right and return to street
  level.

  Go right and stop at the screen called `Clue: pass it on' and use the
  passcard to enter.  Go left and up through the door, collect the key and
  leave the room, go right and up through the second door, then go left and
  through the door.  Go left and up the stairs then right to the end of the
  corridor and through the door, pick up the tape and then go left and
  through the door.  Now go right and through the door using the key.  Pick
  up the disk and go down through the door, head right and through the
  door, carry on right and collect the trumpet then go left and put the
  virus disk in the Penguin's Computer.

  His plan has failed and you have saved the day (again!).



  BATMAN THE MOVIE (*)

  Type "jammmm" on the title screen and it will reappear back to front and
  upside down.  You will now have unlimited lives, and you can jump levels
  by pressing <F10>.

  Here is also the solution of the first level:

  Go up the first ladder then right as far as possible.  Go up as far as
  you can then left avoiding the acid.  To jump the gap at this point,
  swing the rope in a diagonal and rather try to get to the other side
  climb up the platform.  Go up as far as you can, right, then down, stay
  just under the wall on this bit to avoid the bomb thrower.  Go down as
  far as you can, right, up as far as you can, right, down, right, down,
  left, down, right, up until the turn off on the right side, right, down,
  right (avoiding bomb thrower), up, left, up, right, down, right.

  At this point you should be in a large room on the opposite side of
  the two bomb throwers.  Swing across the room pulling down on the joy-
  stick to extend the rope.  You should be able to swing into the first
  bomb thrower killing him.  Drop down to the next platform to take out
  the next thrower.  Go all the way down, right, up and you should find
  Jack Napier. Keep shooting and you've made the second level.



  BATTLE COMMAND

  sing <F6>, <F7>, <F8>, <F9>, or <F10> and you can change to power of
  your selected weapon by pressing <F1>, <F2>, <F3>, <F4>, or <F5>.

  BATTLE VALLEY

  Type "ROGER MELLIE THE MAN ON THE TELLY" for infinite lives.



  BATTLETECH

  Here are some general hints:

  * Money

    Probably the biggest factor in the whole game is money - no money,
    no skill, no mech, no chance.  The more cash the better equipped
    you'll be for combat.
    Every five minutes or so your account is boosted by fifteen credits
    as Ma and Pa robot decide it's time to give some more of your
    allowance.  Don't hang around!  Initially invest in a low risk account
    and then move onto the intermediate one.  Do this for a few hours and
    you'll be counting the wads, around 350,000 of 'em.

  * Training School

    You'll not get far without any training, and the first thing you need
    to know is how to defend yourself.  The important basics to learn are
    knife fight, rifle and machine gun, as these are the only weapon skills
    you'll find yourself needing.
    Stop off at the mechit-lube and take up an apprenticeship.  I know that
    it's expensive, but it enables you to patch up a battlefield mech, and
    take it in for a full repair and slap another member of your party
    inside.

    When it comes to combat training, try to move around as much as is
    possible and overheat as little as possible, and aim for speed on all
    the missions as this contributes to your overall mech skill.
    Medical skill is also a worthwhile venture; it'll also make sure you
    stay in the game longer.

  * Weaponry

    Start off with a machine gun.  It takes quite a few hits to kill a
    human and has no effect on mechs whatsoever - but, still, they're
    relatively cheap.  Later on try to get hold of a Laser Weapon; I
    recommend the inferno best of all.  One shot disposes of 90% of humans
    and Inferno Fire will overheat a mech, giving you time to flee.
    Whatever you do don't hang around taking on a twenty ton mech with a
    hand held SRM - it just doesn't work.  Equip yourself with forty
    point armour, it normally prevents any damage to the person in a
   typical combat round.

  * Mech Etiquette

    First and formost, with the lump of cash you should have by now, any
    mech you own should be customised at the mechit-lube, extra lasers and
    armour always come in handy at the expense of jump jets and missile
    launchers.  Never rule out kicking, more often than not it proves to
    be invaluable when a mech is close to shutdown.  Always try to face an
    attacking mech, all it could take is one hit with a small laser to the
    back to knock out half your arsenal.

  * Additional Hints `n' Tips

    On about the seventh training mission the city is invaded by Kuritans.
    Whatever you do don't fight back; turn tail and run into the ruins of
    the city.  If you make it head for the exit at the south end of the
    eastern wall.  Once you're there hit flee.  Afterwards, head north-
    west-north until you reach the starport.  Buy some civillian clothes
    and infiltrate the Kuritans coronation to find out about your mission.

  BLADE WARRIOR (*) (Complete Solution)

  Gather some ingredients together and make the Heal and Water spells.
  Visit the West Wizard and trade the ingredients for the Travele spell,
  and trade again for the Aulet of the Moon.  Make the Travele spell.
  Collect the key located near the Swamp Wizard's Tower.  Go to Ginit's
  Amulet, take the key, kill the skeleton guards, and take the Amulet.

  Go and see the Swamp Wizard and trade the Amulet for a Tablet Fragment.
  Collect the Silver Ring from the South Wizard level, killing the
  skeleton guards and grabbing the Ring as you go.  Now visit the South
  Wizard and trade the ingredients for a Stone Flute (Compiler: Ideal
  for playing Rock Music with! Ha!Ha!)  Go to the North East top corner
  of the map and get the Veritas leaf.  Visit the Pine Wizard.  Gather
  together enough ingredients for another Stone Flute.  Trade the Veritas
  leaf for The Name.  Trade the `Air' ingredients with the West Wizard
  for the Smoke and Earth spells.

  Journey to the top of the map and find the beehive.  Here, cast the
  Smoke spell and attack the hive.  Now collect the Crystal.  Go to the
  West Wizard and exchange the Crystal for a Tablet Fragment.  Now go to
  the North Wizard and trade one of the Stone Flutes for the Helmet, and
  the Talisman of the Moon for a Tablet Fragment.

  Go to the East Wizard.  Trade the Helmet for the Travele Spell (you
  already have this but the Wizard must have the helmet).  Then trade the
  Name for a Tablet Fragment.  There are a number of Flying Banshees on
  the East Wizards tower level.  When you are attacked by one, immediately
  cast Earth at it, and follow it, continually casting Earth at it until
  it is dead.  Collect the Banshee wail - cast Earth six more times.

  Visit the Palace Wizard next.  You can trade the Banshee Wail for
  another Tablet Fragment.  Go to the path that the Sorcerer's tower is
  on (the red tower on the map).  Locate and take the Swamp Fish sparkle.
  Trade the sparkle for a Tablet Fragment with the Pine Wizard.  Go to the
  South Wizard and trade in the Crystal.  Visit the Sorcerer and he will
  charge your sword for you.  Find Murk and kill the beast with your newly-
  charged sword.  Well Done!

  BUREAUCRACY

  Complete Solution

  You have left your previous job to accept employment with Happitec and
  you have  moved to a new address.  Happitec is sending you on a vacation
  to Paris. All you  have to do is wait for the money order which Happitec
  is sending to you, pick up your plane ticket, and board the plane. So you
   think!  It seems the removals company has misplaced all your belongings.
  The Change of Address card which you  were to file somehow got sent to
  your old address. The new owner of your old home sent your mail to your
  old bank.  Check out your wallet and you'll find that you have no money,
  an expired US Excess card and a Beezer card.  Your new home contains a
  few meager possession, i.e., your Boysenberry computer, a telephone/
  answering machine and a few miscellaneous items.  Take everything you can
  because you'll need everything you can find to solve this game.  Listen
  to the messages on the telephone/answering machine.  Consult your Address
  Book and call all the numbers listed.  You'll learn a lot by doing this.

  The doorbell rings. Chowmail Overnite is delivering a large bag of Llamex
  (R) brand High-Fibre Llama Treats.  You didn't order it, the address is
  wrong; but,  you'll never be able to explain anything to the delivery
  man, so just give him your Beezer card.  You are now the proud owner of
  a bag of Llama treats!

  There's nothing else to do in the house for now, so explore your new
  neighborhood starting with your mailbox.  The mail found in each location
  seems  to be random. For example, in one game you might find a leaflet in
  the mailbox and in another game find a flyer in the mailbox.  That isn't
  important.  The postage is important so try to remember what type of post-
  age was used and the order in which you find it.  The mail you find in
  your mailbox has a postage stamp on it.

  Go to the bookstore. You'll notice it's actually a software store.  Talk
  to the clerk. Ask him about software. He'll offer you a special cart which
  he keeps under the counter. SHOW the game cartridge to the clerk.  He'll
  take it and give you a Recipe Cart.  I found that I got a point for this,
  but did not get a point if I said TRADE cartridges.

  * Your score is now 1 of a possible 21 points.

  Go to the Travel Agency. Give the letter to the Agent and get your round-
  trip ticket to Paris.

  * Your score is now 2 of a possible 21 points.

  Go to the bank and try to file a Change-of-Address form. Lots of luck!
  The bank has already sent you a Change-of-Address form and one is all you
  are allowed. Too bad it was sent to your old address.

  Go to the old tenement building.  There are stairs leading up and a door
  in the south wall.  Nothing can be done about the blank wall at the top
  of the stairs, so forget it.  Knock on the south door.  A voice will
  answer and the door will open.  Enter the flat which is occupied by a
  mousy little man.  Seems he collects stamps.  You will see some mail in
  the floor but the man won't let you pick it up.  Show the stamped envelope
  to the man.  He'll grab it and run out of the flat.  Pick up the mail.
  Notice the Postal Service sticker.

  * Your score is now 3 of a possible 21 points.

  By this time you will probably be getting hungry, so go to the Restaurant.
  The waitress will take your order then return to tell you that your order
  was lost due to a computer crash.  Of course, it's her break time, so
  someone else will take your order.  You must go through the long ordering
  process all over again.  Wait for your order and eat whatever you get.

  You have no money to pay the bill, so sneak out the back door of the
  restaurant into the alley.  From the alley you can squeeze through a gap
  in the fence to arrive at Behind Mansion.  Enter the back door of the
  mansion.  Here you'll find a macaw sitting on a perch.  You can see some
  mail under the perch but the macaw will not allow you to take it.  Go into
  the Trophy Room.  It's a good idea to save the game first bcause the old
  woman shoots.  Make a fast exit.  Go to the front door of the mansion and
  ring the bell, then beat feet to the back door.  Return to the Trophy
  Room, grab the painting of Ronald W. Reagan and exit.  Show the painting
  to the macaw then take the mail from under the perch.  Notice the Postal
  Service sticker.

  * Your score is now 5 of a possible 21 points.

  Go to the llama farm.  Open the bag of llama treats.  Push the bag through
  the mailbox so that it falls into the trough.  While the llama is eating
  the treats, take the mail from the trough.  Notice the Postal Service
  sticker.

  * Your score is now 6 of a possible 21 points.

  Try to enter the farmhouse.  The door won't budge.  You must go away and
  return later.  Go south to the gate.  There's an intercom at the gate.
  It will crackle to life and a voice will say, "Unfortunately, there's a
  radio connected to my brain."  Could this be a password?  Go back to the
  farmhouse.  A heavily armed man resembling Woody Allen will appear in the
  doorway.  He is  rather dazed - not sure where he is or who you are.  Say:
  "Unfortunately, there's a radio connected to my brain."  He will respond
  with: "Actually, it's the BBC controlling us from London."  You can try
  more conversation or merely wait for him to leave.  Return to the gate.

  Again, the voice over the intercom will say, "Unfortunately, there's a
  radio connected to my brain."  You must say, "Actually, it's the BBC
  controlling us from London."  The gate will open.  Enter the Foyer.

  You'll meet the paranoid owner of the house and discover the armed man is
  here also.  The paranoid householder suspects you are an imposter so he
  will ask you a series of questions.  To answer correctly, you must refer
  to the "Popular Paranoia" magazine which is included in your game package.
    One wrong answer and you're dead.  Answer them all correctly and you'll
  find yourself in a gaol cell in the basement of the paranoid's house.

  Examine the gaol door.  Try cutting the molybdenum bars with the hacksaw.
  The armed man will give you the Swiss army knife.  Examination of the
  knife will reveal a button marked POWER SAW and a lever marked GENERATOR.
  Push the button then pull the lever.  Examine both the saw and the
  generator.  Take the power saw and plug it into the generator.  Get on the
  generator (it resembles a bicycle) and start pedaling.  You can't reach
  the bars while sitting on the generator, so give the power saw to the
  armed man.  He'll cut the door open for you.  It's best to stall around in
  the Basement allowing the armed man to go up the stairs before you.  The
  paranoid man and the armed man will  depart. You'll see some mail in the
  foyer.  Don't be surprised if you can't  pick up the money order which
  you want so badly.  Take the envelope.

  * Your score is now 7 of a possible 21 points.

  The envelope contains a memo and a cheque. The check is drawn on the
  Fillmore Fiduciary Trust in the amount of -$75.00.  Yes, that's a minus
  sign.  Go to the bank.  Get a withdrawal slip.  Fill it out then take it
  to the Deposit window.  Give the cheque and the withdrawal slip to the
  teller.  You are depositing -$75.00 using a withdrawal slip which is the
  negative of a deposit slip, negative -$75 is $75.  Makes perfect sense.
  Then go back to the withdrawal window.  Fill out another withdrawal slip
  and withdraw $75.00.

  * Your score is now 8 of a possible 21 points.

  Now that you have money, you might want to return to the restaurant to
  pay your bill.  You are ready to go to the Airport.  Call Getlost Airport
  Cab (number listed in your Address Book).  Wait for the taxi.

  Oh, the Airport is a fun place!  Since you have an Omnia Gallia ticket,
  you should go directly to the Omnia Gallia desk.  Alas, Omnia Gallia has
  been sold.  For further information you must go to the Air Galagasa desk.
  How do you find it?  Well, the way that worked for me was going back to
  the airport entrance, then going through Lost and Found.  Air Zalagasa
  seems to be north of the Lost and Found.  It doesn't matter how early or
  late you arrive at the Air Zalagasa desk.  A fat man will always be in
  line ahead of you and he'll cause you to miss the plane.  Not to worry.
  When your turn finally comes, give the Omnia Gallia ticket to the clerk
  in exchange for an Air Zalagasa ticket.

  * Your score is now 9 of a possible 21 points.

  Once you have the Air Zalagasa ticket in your hot little hand, go south
  one move and climb the pillar.  Open the grate and climb up the duct.
  You'll eventually reach the Control Tower.  A console radio will crackle,
  "Air Zalagasa flight 42 requests permission to take off."  Say:
  "Controller, permission denied."  Go back to the top of the pillar and
  examine the speaker.  Pull the red wire then pull the black wire.  Connect
  red wire to the black wire.  You have short circuited all the speakers
  in the terminal.  The applaluse of the crowd is deafening!

  * Your score is now 11 of a possible 21 points.

  Before you know what's happening, you'll find yourself on the plane in
  seat 3B.  Shortly thereafter, the attendant will bring you a bowl of Llama
  stew.  Eat the stew and you die.  Refuse to eat it and you die.  How can
  you get rid of the stew?  The only way I could get rid of it was to cause
  the seat ahead of me to recline, thus spilling the stew.  By wearing the
  headphones, changing seats, and pushing buttons, you'll learn that the
  whole system is mixed up.  The light button reclines the seats but you'll
  have to experiment to determine which light button controls which seat.

  Here's one way to do it: Before the attendant brings the stew, move to
  Seat 3C.  Wait a few turns.  The attendant will bring the stew.  Leave it
  on your fold-out table and move to Seat 8D.  Push the light button which
  actually reclines the seat ahead of Seat 3C.  That seat will recline,
  thus spilling the stew.

  After the stew is spilled, return to Seat 3C.  You'll see a small piece
  of laminated card.  Examine this and take note of the words "STINGLAI
  KA'ABI."  There will be a telephone call for you, so go to the phone.
  Most likely, it will be the waitress asking about the tip you left her.
  The line will be disconnected and you'll overhear another conversation.
  About this time the flight attendant will ask you to return to your seat;
  however, she will linger, giving you a chance to talk to her.  Say
  "Attendant, STINGLAI KA'ABI".  You'll receive a parachute.  Go to the rear
  of the plane, open the hatch, and jump out.

  * Your score is now 12 of a possible 21 points.

  My Gawd! One strap of your parachute is caught in the plane's hatch.  This
  can be deadly.  Chances are you'll soon be falling without a parachute!
  Knock on the hatch.  The attendant will open it, freeing your parachute
  strap.  Falling! Don't forget to pull the rip cord.

  Hanging from a tree! Yep, you landed in a tree. Get out of the parachute.
  Splash!

  You are now in a cooking pot.  Okay, the natives are hungry, so give them
  a good recipe.  Boot up your Boysenberry and insert the Recipe Cart.  The
  natives will give you an unlabelled cartridge and return your lost address
  book.

  * Your score is now 14 of a possible 21 points.

  You are now in the Antechamber.  Not clear how you got here.  You'll see
  a closed locker door in the west wall and an exit to the east.  Examine
  the locker door and read the sign.  The left handle is pointing up.  The
  middle handle is pointing down.  The right handle is pointing up.  It's a
  key of sorts.  A general knowledge of binary helps.  Okay, here's a
  solution:

  Turn left handle and middle handle.  You hear a click inside the door.
  Turn left handle and right handle.  You hear a click inside the door.
  Turn left handle and middle handle.  You hear a sharp click, as if some-
  thing inside the door had moved.  Open door.

  * Your score is now 15 of a possible 21 points.

  Enter the locker and take the magnetic key-card. Then go east.

  You're in the Switchgear Rooms; it's a maze! Time to use your Boysenberry
  computer, so insert the unlabelled cartridge. Remember, earlier in this
  solution I advised you to notice the Postal Service stickers and the order
  in which you found them.  Hope you paid attention, because you need that
  info now.  I found the Postal stickers in this order: C, D, E and B.  The
  computer program (unlabelled cartridge) gives you a list of commands:
  CLEAR, NOOZ, PRINTB, PRINTC, PRINTD, PRINTE.  You must select the PRINT
  commands in the same order that you found the postal stickers.  I used
  PRINTC, PRINTD, PRINTE, and PRINTB because that's the order in which I
  found the postal stickers.  When you have done this, you should have a
  complete message on the screen.  Can't read it?  Oh, I forget to tell you:
  read from top to bottom one letter at a time.  Using these instructions
  you should  be able to find your way through the maze to the Airlock.

  In the Airlock, put the key-card in the card reader slot.  You'll hear a
  bolt snapping back.  Open the door.  It will take several tries.  Enter
  the Persecution Complex!

  * Your score is now 17 of a possible 21 points.

  The Persecution Complex is a long hall running west.  There are TV
  screens on each side of the hall.  Go west looking at the screens on
  either side as you go.  At the end of the hall you'll find a modular plug.
  Plug in your computer.  You'll be asked for ID and password.  What?  Okay,
  take a look at your Address Book.  Notice anything different?  Right!  The
  first address has been changed.  That's the clue you need.  Type in
  RANDOM-Q-HACKER for ID and RAINBOW-TURTLE for password.  Connection will
  be made.  Use command  DIR for a listing of programs, WHO for a listing
  of users, and TYP for some interesting tidbits.  You'll learn that two
  hackers have accessed the system.  You are one; the nerd is the other.

  You'll also be be advised when the Nerd is about to access another file.
  The TYP command will enable you to learn of a certain file which should
  NOT be used with a friendly computer.  Hmmm, what if you changed the name
  of that file?  So, change the name of DVH2.HAK to whatever file the Nerd
  is preparing to access.  Example: Nerd is about to access FIDUC.HAK.

  Change name of DVH2.HAK to FICUC.HAK.  It might be necessary to first
  change the name of FIDUC.HAK to something else, but you'll have plenty of
  time to do that.  By doing this, you will cause the Nerd to access a file
  which will destroy his own mainframe.  Revenge is sweet!  Once you have
  done this, an opening to the west will appear. It is IMPORTANT to run the
  PLANE.EXE program at some time before you reap your revenge.  This will
  cause a plane to be sent to get you.

  * Your score is now 20 of a possible 21 points.

  Wait patiently at the Landing Strip. The plane you summoned while using
  the PLANE.EXE program will eventually arrive.  You'll be taken on a nice
  plane trip and a predictable taxi ride, arriving at the Hallway of the
  Tenement.  From there, go to your home.  You'll find a new letter from
  Fiduciary apologizing for the problems you've had.  Enclosed in the
  letter you'll find a ticket to Paris, your checkbook and a new Beezer
  card.  Congratulations...

  * Your score is now 21 of a possible 21 points.

  CABAL

  While playing, type in "SCHLIKA", then pressing <F2> will finish the
  level for you.  Apparently, if you pause the game, you can still move
  the crosshair around, so try this as well!



  CADAVER

  To get the second key, go to the guards on level four.  Ignore the levers
  until you have the guard key from the north passage, the candle and the
  shuriken (in the pillow).  Open the wall above the bed to get the second
  key.



  CAPONE

  To find a special bonus, go to the front of the Post Office.  Shoot the
  ball at the top of the flag pole, and your score will raise.  If you
  shoot it again, you'll see a screen of programmers.  Shoot it again and
  you'll be invincible, standing in the bank.  At the end of that round,
  you will start at the beginning with warp speed.



  CAPTAIN BLOOD

  Using the alien icons, ask CODE GG 1.  The alien will then give you the
  coordinates of another alien called GG. Go to the specified planet and
  you can get the coordinates for all the other aliens around by asking
  CODE INFORMATION HELP.



  CAPTAIN PLANET

  For this cheat you will need a copy of CAPTIVE.  Load the game as per
  usual.  On the level selection screen, insert your Captive disc.  Press
  Fire and the screen will say "Disk Error".  Now replace your Captain
  Planet disc and the cheat will be active.

  (Of course, this may just be a cheat published by Tony Crowther to help
  sell Captive!)

  Another source says: When you have completed the Fire level, get killed
  on the Water level.  Enter you high score name as "BBBB" and you should
  be able to start with infinite continues.

  And yet another source (I like my sources on meat pies), says:

  Run through the game as normal until you get to the level selection
  page.  Now type in "go planet".  Now, when the game starts hit <F10>
  and <Return> together, and you should be taken back to the level
  selection page, where you can choose any level.



  CAPTIVE

  When you land go and pick up the message from Ratt on Butre, then return
  to the Swan and then land again.  There will be another message from
  Ratt.  Pick this up as well.  Repeat this 88 times (!) and put all the
  messages in the backpacks, and when they are full, carry them in the
  hands and one on the cursor, enter a base and find a shop.  You can sell
  all the messages and get about 18,500 credits.

  Here are some combinations for the bases in mission one:

  01 Butre..........TL,BL,TR,BR
  02 Pelphi.........BR,BL,TL,TR
  03 Meestre........TL,TR,BL,BR
  04 Triekos........TR,BR,BL,TL

  Here are some combinations for the bases in mission two:

  01 Masgot.........TR,BL,TL,BR
  02 Traphet........TL,BL,TR,BR
  03 Phoopel........TL,TR,BL,BR
  04 Sodcket........BL,BR,TL,TR
  05 Zaitet.........TL,BR,TR,BL

  CARDIAXX

  Pause the game and type in "RACHAEL".  Now press Left <Shift> key, then
  <H>.  Alternatively, try typing in "CAROLILY".



  CARRIER COMMAND (*)

  Pause the game and type "THE BEST IS YET TO BE".  Then press the <+>
  key.  You will now have invincible Mantas.

                     ARNIECAR......100,000 bonus points



  CASTLE MASTER

  The key on the chapel roof can be a swine to get hold of if you don't
  know how to get up there. All you have to do is stand on the drawbridge
  and close it.  You will then be lifted up, making it a doddle to get
  hold of the prize.

  When trying to collect the pentacles in the caverns, fall down one of
  the trap doors and kill the spirit.  Collect the first pentacle then go
  to the other caverns collecting the pentacles and killing the spirits.
  This will make the going easier if you fall into a cavern, since you're
  saved the hassle of tackling a spirit that catches you unawares.

  To get inside the display chamber, crawl inside the granary chest and
  close the lid.  Access is then as easy as falling off a rather wobbly
  chair perched precariously perched on the top of a table.

  Collecting the pentacle in the junk room isn't as obvious as it seems.
  When you enter the room, crouch down, walk over the first shelf and into
  the wall and stand up.  Now do a U-turn and walk forward to collect the
  item.

  To move the big rock or open the pottery door, you need to have maximum
  strength.  If you haven't then fiund some food to top up your energy then
  try again.

  If you have the rock travel potion, you can get to the gymnasium either
  from the Wizard's hut or from directly outside.  If you're having trouble
  finding the spirit in the dungeon, then try looking for something else
  rather than the obvious.  Still stuck?  Well try that rat-like animal at
  the back of the room...

  Now for the big baddy himself.  To kill Magister, the evil owner of the
  castle, wipe out all the other spirits first. Now go to his room and
  blast him in the forehead to destroy him.

  Notes and Hints

  * There are 27 sprites including the dragon. These must be destroyed
    before the Magister can be killed.
  * Maximum health is 12 weights (6 on each side) = Herculean
  * To get onto chapel roof, stand on the drawbridge then close it.

  Note -
   do not do this until you have the key from the wizard's hut and have
   entered the catacombs from under the large rock, and then then under
   the rug in the wizard's hut.

  * Lifting weights in the gymnasium increases your health.
  * Standing in hospital cures you up to normal health.
  * The spirit in the courtyard will only appear when a rock is thrown at
    the flag.
  * To enter the junk room, fire at the plate (on the left of the door),
    until it disappears, enabling the door to be opened.
  * To kill the dragon, shoot eyes, teeth and horns, until they disappear.
  * To kill the Magister, shoot at his head (not eyes).
  * To confront the dragon, start on level 4 in the SW tower. Enter onto
    the ballroom balcony, there is a break next to the last door, drop
    down, and commence along the south passage.
  * To find the Magister, go to the SE tower and press the button in the
    king's solar on level 4. Then reach across the second barrier in the
    corridor, and activate the crank.  Go round to the south passage (the
    long way) and you will be able to enter the Magister's room.
  * A final piece of treasure appears on the table in the wizard's hut
    after the key has been collected from the chapel roof. Use rock travel
    to transport yourself from window in the gymnasium to the wizard's hut,
    then collect treasure and transport back.



  CASTLE OF TERROR

  The flint is found in one of the barrels.



  CHAMBER OF THE SCI-MUTANT PRIESTESS

  You don't have to complete all five Ordeals.  Instead, go into the
  tunnels (from The Noose) and wait an hour.  Then leave the tunnels and
  go to The Master's Eye.  Wait around until The Master dies.  Search his
  body for the whistle.  Use it and a panel will open up.  Reach Inside
  and grab the egg.



  CHAMPIONS OF KRYNN

  See POOL OF RADIANCE - Same Cheat.



  CHAOS STRIKES BACK

  Find a Dragon and cast a "MON ZO GOR SAR" spell, then press <Escape> to
  pause the game.   Now, while holding down the left <Alt> key, type in:
  "LORD LIBRASULUS SMITHES THEE DOWN".  UNpause the game and kill the
  dragon, and when the dragon dies it should leave behind a Firestaff, and
  the party should be invincible.



  CHARIOTS OF WRATH

  When instructed to `press fire to start', push your joystick forward and
  you will get infinite lives.



  CHASE HQ (*)

  After Nancy has told you about the criminal, keep pressing <Space Bar>
  repeatedly, very quickly, and when you start the game, your car will be
  doing about 800 kph.



  CHASE HQ 2

  While playing, type in "IN A GARDENIN".  Now press <T> to reset the timer
  and <N> to go to next level.  Also, holding down <H> and <F5> while the
  game is loading should get rid of all roadside obstacles.



  CHIPS CHALLENGE

  Start the game as normal and press <F>.  The screen should flip upside-
  down.  Type in "SAGITTARIANS MAKE BETTER LOVERS." (with fullstop) for
  an infinite supply of keys, shields, ice boots, and magnets; "09/12/57"
  for unlimited time; or "I THINK THEREFORE I AM." (including fullstop) for
  the ability to escape without collecting all the chips.  <C> will skip a
  level and <F> will return you to the game.

  CHRONOQUEST (*) (Complete Solution)

  Part 1 - INTRODUCTION AND COMMENTS

  (Compilers Note: I have left this discussion-like portion of the solution
   unaltered because it gives a lot of interesting facts and comparisons.
   I know that the ST-related bits are irrelevant to all you Amiga owners,
   but it's nice to know...)

  The following walkthru is a sort of compromise.  The game is available
  for both the Atari ST and the Amiga, but the moves for the two versions
  are very different.  We decided to write just one with lots of version
  notes included.  This is not the most satisfactory method, but it's the
  best we could come up with that didn't involve two separate scripts.
  Generally, the game is a good one.  The graphics are excellent, the
  music is good, and the puzzles are tough but reasonably fair.  However,
  a few cautionary observations are in order before getting into the
  walkthru.

  First, the ST version allows you to read only one document: a scroll.
  However, we know of no way to read even that in the Amiga version.  This
  is a particularly unfortunate problem since it gives some specific
  instructions which are needed to complete the game.  If you are playing
  the Amiga version, by all means drop by The Gamers' Forum when you get
  the scroll, and we will be happy to let you know what it says.  (Or, of
  course, continue reading this walkthru.)  There are also two other
  letters which we suspect gave important clues, but we couldn't read them
  in either version.
  Second, the save/load features are slightly peculiar.  The Amiga version
  allows for complete installation on a hard disk; however, this is not
  true for the ST version.  While the disks aren't copy protected, only
  disks 2 and 3 have hard disk support -- and _only_ for the root
  directory of drive "C" (no folders allowed).  It's certainly possible to
  copy the Boot disk and Disk 1 to any place you wish, but a great many of
  the files have duplicate names.

  In addition, each saved game (which uses less than 700 bytes) requires
  a separate disk.  This is not a major problem since they're entirely
  non-destructive; so, you can use any disk with a bit of space, but it is
  annoying.  Finally, there is no "quit" feature (you must turn off or
  reset the computer), and dying requires a restart.  Third, the documen-
  tation is incorrect where it talks about things you may drop.  Any dropped
  item behaves in exactly the same way, no matter where you drop it -- in
  the room where you pick it up, the room you're to use it in, or any other
  room.  In the ST version, all dropped items appear in the bottom left
  corner of the screen, and you can drop as many as you want.  Only four
  will show at a time; if you pick up one or more, the other items will
  show as space allows.  The Amiga version also lets you drop as many items
  as you want, but finding them is far more difficult.  You must search most
  of the lower portion of the screen.  Fortunately, if you follow this
  walkthru, you won't have to do that.

  Fourth, the Amiga version has no clock, but the ST version does.  The ST
  version requires you to be at a particular place at a certain time.
  While this walkthru will get you there on time, we do not know what uses
  up time and what doesn't.  Therefore, you may need to cause time to pass
  by looking at the TIME icon.

  One final comment: At times the game will display inset pictures on
  your screen of various things you may have examined.  Often, it is the
  inset you need to use in order to get an item, or whatever else you may
  be trying to accomplish.  If something isn't working when you know it
  should be, try using the inset instead of the original (or vice versa,
  depending on what you were using before).  We do tell you which to use,
  however.  So, let's get started!

  Part 2 - THE CASTLE

  Once you start travelling, it is difficult to return to the rest of the
  castle, so we'll start by collecting everything we need in this part.
  You begin in the Entrance Hall of your father's castle.  If you LOOK at
  the left newel post of the stairway, you'll notice it's missing an
  ornament.  Go east into the den, and you'll find it on the bookcase to
  the right of the desk.  It's the only important thing in this room; so,
  GET the ornament, and while you're here, DROP the letter (the one from
  your documentation), and go back west to the Hallway.  USE the ornament
  on the top of the left newel post.  LOOK at the urn and you'll find your
  first punchcard!  TAKE the card from the urn.  Go up and LOOK at the base
  of the statue.  TAKE the key, and USE it on the lock of the chest at the
  back of the room.  LOOK in the chest, TAKE the gloves, and drop the key.
  Now, LOOK at the upper right-hand corner of the carpet, and you'll find
  another punchcard.  TAKE it, and proceed northeast into the bedroom.
  PULL on the handle of the bedside table, then LOOK in the drawer.  TAKE
  the piece of paper.  LOOK at the throw pillows on the bed, and TAKE the
  punchcard you find there.  LOOK under the bed, and TAKE the grapnel and
  rope.  That's all that's important here, and the other bedroom has
  nothing useful.  Head southwest and down to the Entrance Hall.
  Go west into the dining room, then north into the kitchen.  TAKE the
  bottle on the counter.  PULL on the cabinet that is directly under the
  sink.  LOOK at the cabinet, and you'll get a smaller picture of the safe
  that's hidden there!  USE the paper you found upstairs on the safe.
  Voila!  It opens, and you see some money and a lighter.  Ignore the
  money, but take the lighter, then go south, east, and northeast.  Hey,
  it's dark!  Not to worry.  LIGHT the lighter, then go up and east into
  the chapel.  On the right side of the mantel in the rear of the room is
  a candle.
  TAKE the candle, LIGHT it, then UNLIGHT the lighter.  It is important to
  do this as efficiently as possible because the lighter is almost out of
  fluid, and you'll need it later.  LOOK at the book on the lectern, and
  you'll find the fourth punchcard you need.  TAKE it and go west, down
  twice, then east to the Laboratory.  At this point your inventory is
  probably full, so DROP any one item except the candle.

  LOOK at the mirror on the wall, and a hidden switch will appear.  PUSH
  the switch (on the inset picture), and a secret door will open!  DO NOT
  GO THROUGH THE DOOR!  Putting the ornament back on the newel post
  activated the electricity so you could open the door.  But if you go
  through the door now, you'll get fried!  Go west, up, and southwest to
  the hallway.  GET the ornament from the newel post, then DROP it.  Go
  northeast, down, and east back to the Laboratory.  PULL the left-hand
  desk drawer, and LOOK in it.  You'll find some fuses.  TAKE them, then go
  north into the Secret Room.  Ah, ha!  There's the time machine!

  USE fuses on the green square at the bottom of the fuse box on the left
  rear wall, then PULL the lever next to the fuse box.  The Time Machine
  comes to life.

  (Amiga version: Don't be too eager to use the Time Machine just yet:
  You're going to need whichever item you dropped in the Laboratory. So,
  go south and search around until you find it.  Use the GET icon on the
  bottom portion of the picture.  You'll just have to keep searching along
  the bottom of the screen until you find your item, then go back north.)

  This is a good place to save your game.  We're ready to explore Time now,
  so get ready!

  Part 3 - INDIA, EGYPT, PREHISTORY

  Okay we're ready to get started.  To enter the Time Machine use the UP
  icon (to leave it use the DOWN icon).  So, ENTER the machine, and SHOW
  the control panel.
  If you follow this walkthru exactly, you should be able to follow the
  rest of the instructions, because your punchcards will be in the proper
  place in your inventory.  In case you haven't followed along, here is
  where the various punchcards in the Amiga version will take you:
  From the Urn in the Hallway: Prehistory
  From Under the Rug: India
  From Under the Pillows: Egypt
  From the Chapel: Mexico

  If you remove a card, those to its right move to the left to fill the
  empty space, but their relative positions do not change.  USE the SECOND
  punchcard in your inventory on the slot in the control panel.

  Whoosh: You're in India! Go west, then north into the hut.  The Leper
  wants to shake your hand, but you don't want to get leprosy; so, USE the
  glove, then TAKE the Leper's hand.  Leave the glove on throughout the rest
  of the game: You'll need it periodically.
  The Leper will be so grateful he'll give you a piece of paper which
  will allow you to take an elephant ride.  He also asks you to get some
  water from the sacred temple which will cure him.  GET the paper, and go
  south, east twice, then northeast to the Mahouts.  DROP the paper, and
  they'll agree to take you to the temple.
  "Up" will put you on the elephant's back, and you'll automatically end
  up at the temple.
  Go east into the temple, and you'll find the sacred water.  To get the
  water into the bottle, do the following exactly:
  USE
  BOTTLE
  GET
  WATER
  The text should say that you have the water.  Now go west and up, and
  the elephant will take you back to where you started.
  Go southwest, west twice, north, and DROP the bottle.
  The grateful Leper will offer you a key.  TAKE the key, then go south,
  east, and north, and you'll see a smaller picture of a door.  USE the
  key on the door and you'll be inside a hut.  On the table is a letter
  and a piece of punchcard!  TAKE the punchcard piece, and the letter,
  then DROP the letter.  (It probably has an important clue, but nobody
  can figure out how to read it!)  Go south, west twice, and you'll see
  a Fakir who has a scroll in his right hand. TAKE the scroll, but don't
  hang around!  Go east twice, up into the machine, SHOW PANEL
  and PUSH the toggle switch on the left side of the control panel.
  You made it home again!  DROP the candle, then enter the Time Machine.
  SHOW PANEL, and USE the SECOND punchcard in your inventory on the slot.

  You find yourself in Egypt!  LEAVE the Time Machine and go northeast.
  You should see a pedestrian-crossing here.  If you don't, _do not_ go
  north, or you'll get run over!  (The northeast direction in the Amiga
  version was VERY touchy; half the time you ended up going east instead
  of northeast.  You can also get to the pedestrian-crossing by going east
  twice from the Time Machine.)
  Go north twice, and you find yourself in front of a Pyramid.  LOOK at
  the bottom left stone surrounding the entrance.  You're told the stones
  are loose, and you find an amulet.  GET the amulet.  Since we can't find
  a way to READ things, you'll have to trust this walkthru.

  The scroll says: "TOP, TOP LEFT, TOP RIGHT, TOP RIGHT."  Using the
  PUSH/PULL icon, PUSH on the stones in the order indicated by the scroll,
  and the door will open.  If you don't do this right, you die.  DROP the
  scroll.  Go north twice, ignoring the torch on the way.  You don't want
  to mess with all those snakes, so DROP the amulet, and they disappear.
  Now, go north again, then west.  USE the grapnel and rope, and go up.
  Starting from the left, use the PUSH/PULL icon and PULL the SECOND,
  THIRD, FOURTH, and FIFTH levers into the down position.  The sarcophagus
  will open.  In it you find a ring and another piece of the punchcard.
  TAKE the ring and the piece of card.  Using the PUSH/PULL icon, return
  the four levers to their original positions.

  Go down, north, and TURN the right-hand torch on the wall to open a
  secret passage into Nefertiti.  Going down will take you outside to the
  entrance into the pyramid.  (If you hadn't returned the levers to their
  original positions, you would have been impaled on spikes in the secret
  passage.)  Go south twice, west, and up into the Time Machine.  SHOW
  PANEL and PUSH the toggle switch to go home.  A note here about dropping
  pieces of the punchcard.  This was done in order to make room in your
  inventory, but it is a bit of a pain to find them again, especially in
  the Amiga version.  From now on, we will include a note on how many
  inventory spaces you will need in a given time zone.

  For the next time zone (Prehistory), you will need four free inventory
  spaces.  (The ST version requires five.)  The punchcard you USE in the
  time machine will release one inventory space; you can drop an item to
  free another space.
  In the secret room, DROP the piece of punchcard (if you need extra
  inventory space), SHOW PANEL, then USE the FIRST card in your inventory
  to enter Prehistory.  LEAVE the machine and go east.  LOOK at the
   entrance to the hut, and you'll find a bone.  TAKE the bone.  You will
  also find some dry grass and a rock.  If you have space, you can TAKE
  the ROCK.
  Now, go east twice, and north to the remains of a fire.  LOOK at the
  fire and you'll find a piece of wood.  TAKE the wood, LIGHT your lighter,
  LIGHT the wood, UNLIGHT the lighter.  You may now drop the lighter.
  Toward the back of this scene you'll see some small rocks.  LOOK at the
  rocks, and you'll be told there's a small rock there.  TAKE the rock (if
  you didn't take the one from the hut), then go east and south into the
  cave.  LOOK in the area of the candles, and you'll find another piece of
  punchcard.  TAKE the piece, then LOOK at the drawing that appears in the
  left corner of the background.  You should get an inset picture on your
  screen showing the drawing's finer details.  It's a drawing of a temple
  with "13-H" written above it.
  Go north, west, south, and west three times.  ENTER the Time Machine
  (SHOW PANEL), and PUSH the toggle switch to go home.

  Part 4 - MEXICO AND THE FUTURE

  We're about to embark on the most complicated scenario yet; be prepared
  to save your game!  First, DROP the piece of punchcard you picked up in
  Egypt, if you want to.  You only need one free inventory space, and
  you'll get that from the punchcard.  The branch is also useless, so you
  may drop it.
  Go north to the Time Machine (Amiga version: SHOW PANEL), and USE the
  remaining punchcard on the slot.  Suddenly, you find yourself in Mexico!
  From the Time Machine, go east twice, and you'll see a tree on the left
  side of the screen with a hole near its bottom.  LOOK at the hole, then
  TAKE the necklace.  Go west four times to the warrior.  USE the necklace
  on his right hand near the bottom of the screen.  He'll draw you a map,
  and tell you to start from the three rocks.  Go northeast three times,
  then north to a small temple.  LOOK at the temple, and you'll see an idol.
  TURN the idol, and you'll find a key.  TAKE the key, go west three times,
  and you'll be at the three stones the warrior told you about.
  Save your game here!  As mentioned before, the direction icons are _very_
  touchy (particularly in the Amiga version); if you're off by a pixel or
  two, you'll go in the wrong direction and get killed.  Go northeast three
  times, north twice, northwest twice, northeast, then east. You should
  find yourself in front of the temple.  You should be still wearing the
  glove. If so, LOOK at the bush in the middle foreground of the picture.
  (If you're NOT wearing the glove, a snake will kill you!)
  You should get an inset picture of a slab with a slot in the middle of
  it.  USE the ring on the slot in the MAIN picture (not the inset), go
  up, and beams of light will appear, indicating that the door is now safe
  to approach. Going up again will provide you with an inset picture of a
  door.  You'll notice a small hole on each side of the door.  USE the bone
  on the hole on the RIGHT side.  The text will tell you that nothing
  happens, but if you go up again, you'll find yourself in the temple.

  You are now inside the temple facing a chest.  USE the key on the chest,
  and TAKE the final piece of punchcard!  (If you have the other three
  pieces of punchcard with you, they will automatically become one whole
  punchcard.  We guess punchcards worked differently in the 1920s, before
  computers were invented.)
  Go down, and save your game; then, go west, southwest, southeast twice,
  south twice, southwest three times, southeast twice, and southwest.
  You're back at the Time Machine.  ENTER the time machine (Amiga version:
  SHOW PANEL), and PUSH the toggle switch.
  Now LEAVE the machine, and GET the three other pieces of punch card you
  dropped in the room (if you dropped them).  After you find the second
  piece, you'll see a new inset picture appear (in the Amiga version).  We
  have _no idea_ what it represents; if you figure it out, please let us
  know!

  When you find the fourth piece, the punchcard will automatically be
  assembled for you, and you're ready for the final assault! All you need
  in your inventory at this point is the glove, rock, picture, and
  punchcard.  ENTER the Time Machine (SHOW PANEL), and USE the punch card
  in the slot.
  When you arrive, LEAVE the Time Machine.  Ahead of you, you will see a
  door.  To the left of it is what looks like a monitor with a couple of
  buttons under it.  PUSH the red button, and a picture will appear on the
  monitor.  In the lower right corner of your screen, you'll see a console.
  PUSH the red button on the console, and a map of the world will appear.
  Go west, the door should open, and a guard with a gun will appear.  In
  order to take care of him, click in the following order:
  HIT
  MAN
  ROCK
  (Someone suggested that you need to do more here before hitting the
  man. So if this doesn't work, try fiddling around with something first.)

  LOOK at the floor where the man fell; you'll find a suit, a gun, and a
  strange key.  You need the suit and the key, but you can ignore the gun
  if you wish.  USE the suit and you'll be wearing it.
  Go north, east twice, and south to a small room with some equipment in
  it.  At the bottom right you will see a platform with a red button on it.
  PUSH the button, and you'll see a picture of a strange machine with an
  "X" on it.  (Remember the position of the "X"!)  Now, go north three
  times, and west: There's the machine you saw in the little picture!
  PUSH on the area where you saw the "X," and a compartment will open.
  Making sure you're still wearing the glove, TAKE the fuses out of the
  open compartment.
  The machine will stop functioning.  Go east.  There's a storage
  compartment on your right which contains a spacesuit.  This suit will
  let you go out into space, but there's nothing out there, so don't
  bother.  Instead, continue south twice, then east.
  (If you're not wearing the suit, or if you didn't remove the fuses from
  the machine, you'll get killed at this point in the Amiga version.)

  If you're still alive, USE the key on the control box to the right of
  the door.  If you haven't brought the picture with you, the key will have
  no effect.  (It makes no sense to us, either!)
  If you HAVE brought the picture, the servant will appear, confess
  everything, and a picture of Humphrey Bogart will appear telling you
  you've won the game.

  COLORADO (Complete Solution)

  *** The Winnemucca Forest

  Starting from the canoe, head east into the next screen.  Load your gun
  and shoot the Iroquois that makes his way towards you, and then continue
  east and enter the forest.  At the crossroads take the upper trail and
  head back west.  When you arrive at the screen with the archer, go behind
  the trees to avoid his arrows and then use the knife or hatchet to dispose
  of him.

  In the next screen you will come up against the Iroquois chief; use the
  hatchet to kill him, and then take the necklace and skin.  Go back to the
  last crossroads and climb the mountain, being careful not to fall off the
  edge (it's advisable for you to save the game at the peak).  Pick up the
  nuggets at the top of the mountain, and then climb all the way back down
  and return to the first crossroads. Go east from the crossroads until you
  come across another archer.  To kill him, hide in the first recess and
  cause him to shoot an arrow by moving diagonally backwards and forwards,
  then place yourself in his line of sight, make a jump and take cover in
  the second recess.  Cause the archer to fire another arrow and then use
  the knife or hatchet to kill him.  Be careful of the jump in the next
  screen, and then carry straight on.

  *** Mac Biggle

  Swap the nuggets, skin and necklace with him, and if necessary, drink
  a potion.  Now continue walking east and climb to the end of the blind
  alley.

  *** The Canyon of Death

  Climb up, avoid the Apaches and then continue east; take care at the
  jump. On the other side you will be attacked by two Apaches; use the
  gun to dispose of these two, and then save the game.  Continue on the
  lower road until you get to the next screen.  As soon as you enter, move
  into the recess and reload your gun.  Foolow the archer into firing at
  you, then move back out of the recess and shoot him; walk east.  Kill the
  Apache you come across with either the knife or hatchet.  Do the same in
  the next screen, and then walk east again. Yet again, take care on the
  two jump, and after you have got to the other side, reload the gun.

  Use the gun as soon as you enter the next screen, and the use the axe or
  knife to get rid of the Apache chief.  Change the powder horn (freeing one
  icon), pick up the necklace and the peace-pipe.  Go back to the fork and
  take the staircase; at the top of the stairs reload the gun, and as soon
  as you arrive in the next screen use it; reload the gun once more, shoot
  the next Apache you come across and then use the axe or knife to finish
  him off.

  *** Music

  Drop the peace-pipe in front of the Hopi chief and swap it for the silver
  bullet.  Return to the first room in the canyon, make two left turns and
  pick up the nuggets, then return to the forest.

  *** Mac Biggle

  Trade the nuggets and the necklaces, drink a potion and return to the
  canoe.

  *** Big Bear Forest

  Take a right turn twice and then prepare to fight the first of the big
  bears.  There are three methods that can be used but the best way is
  third method.  Firstly, you can kill the bear with a stick of dynamite
  and one bullet; secondly, you can use one complete powder charge; lastly
  is to fight him with the knife.  After you have defeated the bear, go
  right for two passages, take the passage at the back to save the game,
  and then come back to the second passage (in front of the tree on the
  right) and cross the field of rabbits.  When you fight the wolf the best
  thing to do is to hit it immediately with a low blow from the axe,
  otherwise you will have to go back a place in order to let the wolf pass
  in front of you so you can give it a low blow with the axe or you can
  simply avoid it by not moving in a straight line.
  Continue right, and pick up the nugget.

  *** The Gang Down the Mine

  Throw the dynamite into the pile of rocks, then reload your gun and shoot
  the miner.  Now select the knife or axe and strike at the miner who will
  then run away.  Start moving right and when you get to the blind alley
  kill the miner you find there.  Follow Huck through the mine where a
  passage will open up (NB - if there is a tree icon, you can pick up a
  nugget in the room to the right of the secret passage room); take this
  passage and at the first fork take the trail at the back.  Go over a jump
  and at the second fork take the door at the bottom.  Reload the gun,
  shoot the miner and then finish him off.

  Go to the second fork and take the door at the back, reload the gun, and
  on entering the room, take a few steps forward and shelter in the recess.
  Make the Old Timer shoot, then use the gun in the low position to deal
  with him.

  Take, and then read the parchment (drop it afterwards).  Go right and
  throw the dynamite into the pile of rocks, then go to the peak where you
  can save.

  Return to the first fork and go through the lower door; kill the miner
  with the gun, knife or axe.  In the next room advance gradually, and when
  you hear the waggon, take a diagonal step into the recess (pick up the
  nugget if the icon is available), and then carry on right and kill the
  miner. Continue right and you will come across the head of the miners; if
  you still have some dynamite left use it on him, otherwise use the gun
  and knife or axe.  Pick up the large nugget and return to the forest, and
  to the canoe.

  *** In Cheyenne Country

  Right (twice) - jump over the fire, turn right. Pick up skin (if the icon
  is not available, put down the object, pick up water skin, swap it at
  Biggle's store for gunpowder, change the powder horn, pick up object you
  put down).  First fork: take the upper road.

  *** Mac Biggle

  Swap the nuggets and the big nugget. Right, second fork: take the one
  at the back behind the tents.  Make sign of peace to the medicine-man,
  then find out what the parchment says.  Go back to the first fork, take
  the lower road in front of the tent.  Fight the giant in the same way as
  you did the bear.  Go right, make the sign of peace to Chief Two Moons,
  find out what the parchment says; return to the canoe.

  *** Terror in the Woods

  Move right (four times), kill an Indian, right, Mac Biggle, kill the chief
  and take the necklace and skin.

  *** Mac Biggle

  Swap the necklace and skin.  The silver bullet and potions can be left
  there; the powder horn can be swapped and you can drink a potion.
  Return to the third room in the forest and take the passage at the
  back to the right of the rock. Climb the mountain and fight the indian
  (you can avoid him but be careful of the sheer drop).  Archer in the next
  room: reload the gun beforehand, crouch down on entering, cause the archer
  to shoot an arrow with standing/crouching action, then use the gun.  Jump
  and then right.

  *** The Medallion of Courage

  Return to Chief Two Moons and put down the papoose.  Recover the
  medallion.  Take canoe at the beginning of the camp go back to the forest.
  Move back up the mountain; save in the cave and leave the cave by the
  right.  Keep on going right killing all animals you encounter.

  *** Two Moon's Son

  At the foot of the peak, save and then climb the mountainside to the
  level of the sticks.  Climb and at the top fight the condor.  Take the
  papoose.  Return to the mine; return to the cave using the lift.  Go back
  down the mountain, pick up the silver bullet you had put down.  In the
  second room in the forest, use the pasage behind the large bush.  Left,
  reload the gun and kill the indian using either of your weapons.  Right,
  jump, right.

  *** In the Kingdom of the Dead

  Save again.  Passage behind the burial-place on the right.  Note the
  contents of the parchment, go right, pass in front again and to the right.
  Kill two wolves, right. To kill the lone wolf, load the gun with the
  silver bullet, take two steps to the right then use the gun, shooting low.
  Because you have the medallion you will not be hurt by the Great Spirit;
  take the canoe.

  *** Powhatan's cave

  Save your position. Take the right blind alley and climb at the bottom.
  If you take the right, kill the bear with the dynamite and the gun or in
  the traditional way.  Return to the left and choose the barrel on the
  extreme left (move back to avoid the blast of the explosion); the Passage
  of the Great Cross is open.  Left and take the lift. Return to the mine.
  Go back to the fork then go to the back to return to the peak.

  *** Pocahonta's gold mine

  Right, place the medallion in front of chief, the passage open, and that's
  it - you've completed Colorado!

  The End!



  COLOSSAL ADVENTURE (Complete Solution)

  There are several `random' elements within this adventure, so it is not
  possible to indicate EXACTLY where or when they occur.  The best thing
  to do is follow the procedures, detailed in these preliminary notes, to
  deal with each problem as and when it arises.

  * The first Dwarf you meet will throw an axe or small knife at you.  It
    always misses the first time.  Ignore the knife but get the axe.  From
    then on, when you meet a Dwarf, throw the axe and take it again.  One
    throw will usually suffice but you may have to repeat the action.

  * When you have some treasures the Pirate will rob you.  To retrieve
    them (also the chest, which is itself a necessary treasure) go to the
    West End of the Hall of Mists. Now follow these directions EXACTLY:

    South, East, South, South, South, North-East, East, North-West

    You will now have found the chest containing your stolen treasure.
    Take the chest AND your stolen treasures and proceed EXACTLY as
    follows:

    South-East, North, Down, East, East, Say `Xyzzy'

    You are now back at the Small Brick Building.  deposit the chest and
    treasures and resume where you left off.  The Pirate will not return.

  * When you are told that the lamp is flickering, this is a warning
    that the batteries need replacing.  Go back to the Small Brick Building
    and Get The Coins. `Say Plugh' and then `On Lamp' then proceed EXACTLY
    as follows:

    South, South, Up, West, West, West, West, West, South, East, East,
    Climb

    You will now have found the Vending Machine and you should `DROP
    COINS'.  The machine will dispense new batteries and your lamp is
    automatically `recharged'.  Now proceed:

    North, Up, East, East, East, East, East, Down, North, North, Off Lamp,
    Say `Plugh'

    You are now back at the Small Brick Building.  As the coins were a
    necessary treasure, this procedure will deduct TEN points from your
    final score!  This solution cuts a few unnecessary corners out, and
    fully utilises ON/OFF LAMP and the magic words: PLUGH, PLOVER and XYZZY
    to reduce the chances of needing replacement batteries.

  * The `Endgame' will materialise when ALL treasures have been collected
    and shortly after you are informed that the `Caves are closing'.

  * Finally, each time you `SAVE' your position, ONE point is deducted
    from your score.

  The message of the Rose: Love is my shield


  AND MAYBE THIS WILL HELP YOU.......
  The language of the flowers.
  From the earliest days of civilization, flowers have been given special
  meanings.  For example, the rose has a long association with love,
  sexuality and with many goddesses, the virgin mary, and the science of
  alchemy.  Not only the flower itself, but often the color indicated what
  significance was attached to it.  There are many legends of flowers
  springing up where drops of blood or tears fell to the ground.  What
  follows is a list of flowers and their meanings.

  Almond blossom - hope
  Anemone - afterthought
  Buttercup - memories of childhood
  Carnation - heart
  Columbine - folly
  Yellow chrysanthemum - slighted love
  White chrysanthemum - truth
  Cornflower - celibacy (NUN & PRIEST)
  Daffodil - death
  Forget-me-not - true love
  Hyacinth - sport, game, or play
  White lily - purity
  Yellow lily - falsehood
  Orchid - seduction
  Blue periwinkle - early friendship
  White periwinkle - pleasures of memory
  Red poppy - consolation
  Scarlet poppy - fantastic extravagance
  Snowdrop - hope or consolation
  Sunflower - haughtiness
  Red tulip - declaration of love
  Yellow tulip - hopeless love
  Violet - lust

  You only need to answer three, so there is a good chance you will get
   a lot of the questions.  Now that you have answered these three riddles
   you will be set free and teleported before the ice.

  Now go back west two screens to the map and go to Southhampton.
  Talk to the man near the boat.
  Ask the man about Galahad and ASK ABOUT PRICES.
  BUY TRIP TO GAZA.
  The ticket to Gaza will cost 3gp's.
  DO YOU STILL HAVE MONEY IN YOUR PURSE?
  You probably only have two GP's, so give two gold pieces and five
   silver pieces or (if you have them) 3 gold pieces.
  The man and you will get your ticket.
  Off to Gaza!

  When you enter Gaza, you will see a man and a boy.
  They will both persuade you to go with them.

  Now that you have no money go to the man Mohammed.
  He is caring for your mule.
  Sell the mule to him and you will have lots of money again.
  Mohammed will tell you all the conversions for the money he gives to you.

  2 DINARS= GOLD

  Go to the right of the mummy and use your sword to get the medallion.
  Now go to the sarcophagus and read the inscription on it.
  Go to the open part of the sarcophagus and get the golden apple.
  Now you should easily find Galahad.
  Give Galahad the elixir that you got from the Hierophant.
  You should get bitten by a rat right now, but don't worry.
  Just continue on,but hurry now.
  Now look around for the statue of Aphrodite.
  Put the golden apple in the palm of her hand.

  Walk all around the temple and check it out.
  When you encounter the Saracen, eat the strength apple.
  Put on the helmet that Saracen gives you.
  Now fight the thing.

  If you die of poison at any time in this whole area, then you have
   wasted too much time, so restore to the part where you get bitten and
   do everything more quickly.

  After you beat the Saracen, use the dove.
  Follow the dove until Aphrodite appears.
  Listen to what she says.
  Then ask Merlin about the spiral.

  CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS

  See POOL OF RADIANCE - same cheat.

  But also, here's some other stuff, in case your interested...

  In case anyone was wondering, The `Wizard in Red' refers to Dracandros.
  He is the owner of the Crescent Moon bond.  The `Woman in Green' refers
  to the leader of the Cultists of Moander.  They, of course, are the
  owners of the Mouth in the Hand bond, which is the symbol of the God
  Moander.  The `Lord of the Black' refers to the leader of the Zhentrim,
  or `Black Network', an evil alliance of priests, mages and thieves
  that operate out of Zhentil Keep.  They own the big `Z' in the Triangle
  bond.  Lastly, `The Flamed One' is, of course, good old Tyranthraxus.
  He owns the Flaming Bond, which is the Symbol of Tyranthraxus.

  To defeat Tyranthraxus, you must gather the Amulet of Lathander, which
  is in Zhentil Keep, the Helm of Dragons, which is currently being kept
  by Dracandros in his castle near Haptooth, and the Gauntlet of Moander,
  which is kept by Mogion (the Woman in Green!) in Yulash.
  You must take these items to the Pool of Radiance.

  Here's some help on how to get rid of those *&%#!@ bonds:

  The Fire Knife bond is lost when you defeat the leader of the Fire
  Knives under Tilverton.

  The Zhentrim bond is lost when the Zhentrim leader is killed by Dexam
  under Zhentil Keep.

  Dracandros' bond is removed when you confront him and his horde of
  Black Dragons (about 26 of them, so be prepared!) atop his tower near
  Haptooth

  The symbol of Moander is lost when you defeat Mogion and the Bit o'
  Moander in the Pit in Yulash.

  And the symbol of Tyranthraxus?  Well, who knows?  However, I can
  guess that it probably has something to do with killing the guy...

  DEADLINE (Complete Solution)

  From the front path of the Robner's estate, go North to the front door of
  the house.  Type "Open Door" and go North into the Robners' house.  From
  inside the door, go North, East, and type "Climb Stairs" twice (or you
  can just go Up, Up to get to the second level of the estate.  From there,
  go West, West, West, West, and North to the library where you will start
  the first of a series of Sherlock Holmes-type activities.  In Deadline,
  you need to establish the motive and method for the murder beyond all
  reasonable doubt before you can arrest the guilty party.  If you don't
  have an air-tight case, the jury will acquit the defendant.

  It is here in the library where we go about establishing the method by
  which poor Mr. Robner was done in.  First off, type "Examine Rug".  You
  will find some mud spots which is your first clue.  Now, "Get The Cup,
  Pad, Calender and Pencil" and "Rub Pencil on Pad" and then "Turn Page of
  Calender".  Aha!  Perhaps a clue as to the motive?  Let's see if we can
  substantiate the method a little more...that mud on the rug was very
  interesting.

  Type "Open Balcony Door" and Go North onto the balcony.  Check out the
  railing by typing "Examine Railing" and you will see some scratches,
  lending credence to the theory that perhaps the murderer climbed up the
  balcony from the ground below where he (or she) got mud on his shoes.
  Let's have a look below and check for some indication that the murderer
  was indeed below the balcony.

  To leave the balcony, go South, South, East, East, East, East, Down,
  Down, West, South.  Type "Open Door" and go South back to the front door.
  Now go East, East, and South-East to the shed where you will see a
  ladder.  Type "Examine Ladder".  Hmmm!  This ladder-and-balcony theory
  is looking good!  Let's see if we can prove the ladder was below the
  balcony.  This will have to wait a while though, because it's getting
  late in the morning and we have to do some more checking in the house
  before the reading of the will takes place.  And besides that, we need to
  talk to Mr. McNabb and he doesn't seem to be in the mood right now.

  Go back to the house by heading North, South, North and head back up-
  stairs with North, North, East, Up, Up.  Let's see what else we can find
  upstairs.  Go South, South into Dunbar's bathroom.  Type "Open Cabinet"
  and "Examine Loblo".  Aha, again!  Now we go back downstairs and see if
  we can find Mr. McNabb to see if he knows anything about a ladder under
  the balcony.  Go North, North, Down, Down, West, South, and South.  Let's
  take a break for a while.  Type "Wait Until 11:30".  And now for Mr.
  McNabb.  Let's try the garden path first with East, North-East, East,
  and West.

  If McNabb is not around, just wait for a while or snoop around the area
  and he will soon show up.  Deadline is very unpredictable when it comes
  to the various characters moving around the scenario.  Once you spot
  McNabb, go to him and say "Hey  McNabb", followed by "What is Wrong".
  He will tell you about some holes he found in his garden so, naturally,
  you say "Show Me the Holes".  He will take off and you "Follow Hiim".
  When he stops, type "Examine Holes".  Eureka!  The ladder was here and
  the depth of the holes proves somebody climbed it up to the balcony!
  To make sure we cover every angle, type "Examine Ground" and "Dig Around
  Holes".  Hmmm...wonder what this could be about?  To find out, type
  "Analyze Fragment For Loblo".  Oops, it's later than we thought!  Back
  to the house for the reading of the will.  Go North, South-West, South-
  East, and East to the house and North, North, West into the living room.
  Now just "Wait" for the will to be read.

  After the will is read, you decide to see if you can roust some of those
  present into giving you some clues as to the guilty party and, perhaps,
  the motive for the crime.  Let's start with George.  Type "Show George
  the Calender".  He will get very nervous and start heading out of the
  room.  Type "Follow Him" until he finally goes to his room.  He will
  keep telling you to leave him alone, but just keep following him until
  he enters his room.

  At this point, you decide to see if George knows more then he's telling.
  You aren't going to get anything from him here, so let's go to the
  balcony and wait to see if he does anything.  Go West, North, North to
  the balcony and type "Wait 10 Minutes".  Voila!  Here he comes!  Wait
  until he goes behind the bookshelf and then type "Wait 4 Minutes" to
  give him time to really get his hands into the cookie jar.  When your
  four minutes are up, go South, "Examine Bookshelf", "Press Button", and
  go East.  Ha!  Caught him red-handed!!  Type "Get Will", "Look Safe",
  "Get Papers", and "Read Papers".

  Things are beginning to look up!  Let's see if we can substantiate some
  of this stuff.  Go back to the living room with West, South, East, East,
  East, East, Down, Down, West, West.  My, isn't this cozy!  Type "Hey
  Baxter", and "What about Focus".  You know he's lying so you "Show Papers
  to Baxter".  Ah, that's better!  Now for some clever psycho-detective
  work.  Type "Show Lab Report to Dunbar" and "Show Lab Report to Baxter".
  Whip around and "Accuse Dunbar".  Hmmm...a tad nervous, isn't she?
  Perhaps we should go off and wait to see what develops.

  Go East to leave the room and "Wait for Dunbar".  Just as we suspected!
  When she passes you, type "Follow Her".  Once outside the house, she will
  drop a ticket.  Type "Get Ticket" and "Read Ticket."  WOW!  This is get-
  ting good!  Type "Show Ticket to Dunbar".  You know you've got her on the
  run now so head off to the shed to wait and see what develops.  Go East,
  East, and South-East and "Wait for Baxter".  When they both show up,
  "Show Ticket to Baxter" and "Arrest Baxter and Dunbar".  You didn't
  believe them for a minute, did you?

  Due to the dynamic nature of Deadline, there are several ways to end up
  accusing Baxter and Dunbar of the murder.  There are also more puzzles to
  solve, but this is all that is necessary to put together an air-tight
  case against them.

  Pressing the <Escape> key will return you to the game.

  When you have typed "A3" followed by "01" and the entered a number
  "01"-"05" in location 9D for the corresponding mission, hyperspace to
  a different planet and dock with the space station.  You will be now
  given your chosen mission.

  Here is a way to span 80 light years in about two jumps.  First of all
  buy some fuel and launch from the station.  Go to the local cluster
  chart by pressing <F6>, and choose a planet that lies within the fuel
  range as normal.  Press <H> to hyperspace and the cursor will disappear,
  but you can still control it even though you can't see it.  Now move the
  cursor to a planet outside the range and press <F6> to get the local
  chart for that planet.  But remember you've only ten seconds until the
  countdown finishes so you have to be quick.  This should cause the jump
  to move to the selected planet, well outside the 7.2 light year range.

  Do you enjoy the amazing rendition of the Blue Danube?  If so, press
  <H> to hyperspace, when the counter is 5 or lower, engage the docking
  computer, and the Blue Danube will now play till you reach the next
  station.

  - door to the room so he doesn't get those three items while you are off

  - If you now look at the map, you will notice that it maps the strange
  - translucent rooms you find below the dungeon.  If you noticed the
  - tunnels connecting the rooms down there, they were perfectly round and
  - made of carbon.  Well this magic map can make and erase these magic
  - tunnels just by you drawing and erasing lines on the map!

  - However, you only have a couple of lines worth of pencil left, so you
  - have to use it wisely!  The Scroll you need in order to defeat Krill
  - lies in the room marked "P" -- but so does the ultimate evil terror,
  - who is guarding it.  The idea is to release this creature by creating
  - a tunnel to "P", but to trap the terror in other rooms before it gets

  Having typed that in, pressing one of the following keys will result in
  a specific effect.

    <S> - Advances you one checkpoint

  ESCAPE FROM THE PLANET OF THE ROBOT MONSTERS

  This cheat only works in a one player game.  While playing, when you
  meet the Reptillon monster, run past it and stand in the centre of the
  join of the gates that block your way.  When you are here, wiggle the
  joystick left and right and keep dropping bombs.  After a while, you
  will go through the doors and appear on the other side.



  E-SWAT

  Pause the game and type in "JUSTIFIED ANCIENTS OF MU MU".  The screen
  will flash and you will have 99 credits.



  EXOLON

  Enter your name on the high scores table as "ad astra" and you will
  receive lots of lives.



  EYE OF HORUS

  Type "SPAM" on the credits screen for infinite lives and no need for keys
  anymore.



  EYE OF THE BEHOLDER

  Make sure you draw maps as you go along - secret doors can make things
  confusing.  If you get stuck, jump down a pit and look for another way
  up as you may have missed exploring part of the level.  Some pressure
  pads can be activated from a distance by throwing objects onto them.
  Try to explore seperate parts of the dungeon at a time, and explore them
  thoroughly before opening doors onto new unexplored areas.  This will
  make exploring dungeons easier.  When you find some writing and a
  character says "What a strange marking to place here", insert a dagger
  into the crack in the wall and this will open a secret door.  You will
  find two skeletons on the earlier levels, both of which you must take.
  Later on in the game you will be able to resurrect the dead adventurers,
  and they will join your party as NPC's.  On level four, help the dwarves
  and let Dohrun the Dwarven fighter join your party.  You can now visit
  the Dwarven Cleric who will heal and/or resurrect characters.  Never fight
  Rust Monsters hand-to-hand - use missile weapons and long-ranged attack
  spells such as MAGIC MISSILE or MELFS ACID ARROW, as their attacks
  dissolve a metallic object carried by the character, usually armour or a
  weapon.  Make sure you put several different races in your party so that
  you can read every message found on walls in the dungeon.

  The Cheat! - Note:

  To cheat in the way described below, you will need a few things.  For a
  start, an Amiga and a copy of Eye of the Beholder would not go astray.
  However, you will also need a file editing program such as FileMaster
  (which is the one I use, available from most public domain libraries).
  You do not require a knowledge of HEX to cheat here.

  First of all, load up Filemaster (or whatever you are using, but I
  recommend using FileMaster).  Now open the file "EOBDATA.SAV", which
  resides on Eye of the Beholder disc 2.

  For this cheat, we are working in HEX, so click the mouse pointer on
  the HEX part of the screen (the left side) so that the program knows
  this.

  Move the cursor around with the arrow keys so that, on the ASCII side
  of the screen, the first letter of your first character's name is
  highlighted.

  Now, press the right arrow key eleven times.  The cursor should come
  to rest over a number similar to 11 or 12 (on the ASCII side).

  Making sure that you are editing in HEX, type in `72' (without the
  quote marks, fool!) fourteen times.

  Now type in, `FF' twice.

  Now do this with all your characters, then save the file.

  Now your characters should have stats of 114, and about 120 hit points.



 FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF



  F-19 STEALTH FIGHTER

  Press <Alt> and <H> to get the pitch lines on the HUD.  Fly upside-down,
  turn off the planes engines and keep its altitude to 10 degrees.  You
  should now be able to climb without losing any fuel.



  F-29 RETALIATOR

  To fly any mission with infinite weapons, enter your name as "CIARAN" on
  the enrolment screen and press <Return>, then load up your pilots log.
  Your name should now be "OCEAN OK".   Now proceed as normal.




  FAERY TALE (*)

  Take a save game file and use a PD/shareware program such as NewZap or
  FileMaster to patch byte 18 to a non-zero value.  Load your save game,
  and now these cheat options are enabled:

  Arrow Keys   - Move Rapidly over any terrain
  <B>          - Summon Gold Swan
  <R>          - Rescue Princess
  <=>          - Display coordinates
  <F10>        - Location in coordinates
  <F9>         - Increase time by 1 hour

  When you find the turtle, jump on it and start slashing with your weapon.
  The turtle will not be harmed but your bravery will rise.  The best weapon
  in the game is the sword.  The keys to use for different buildings are:

  White - For old castles and manors
  Grey - For the watch tower and buildings in the city of Marheim
  Red - For secret entrances
  Gold - For the maze in Hemsaths tomb and for the inner chambers of King
         Marheim's palace
  Blue - For the sorceresses keep on the Isle of Sorcery
  Green - For normal buildings

  The witch's castle is accessable through the maze of Grimwood forest.
  You must enter the maze from the west and make your way north-east.  A
  cave must also be found.  This should take you to the Sunstone.  The
  Sunstone should be used to kill the witch but this might not work.  You
  should be able to kill the witch with any missile weapon as long as you
  avoid the witch's gaze.  After you kill her, you must get the golden
  lasso in order to ride the Golden Swan.  In the City of Azal, you will
  need the five golden statues.  These statues are located in: The Crystal
  Palace on the Isle of Sorcery, The Battlefield in Grimwood Forest, The
  Castle south-east of Marheim, The Watch Tower, and Hemsath's Tomb.

  If you don't want to go through the hassle of collecting all the
  statuettes:

  Go the the dark citadel
  Stand right up against the force field
  Let yourself starve so that you faint
  When you wake up, you'll be on the other side of the force field

  Sometimes you can accumulate all the treasure you want by going near the
  item, pressing space bar, and then continue hitting 'T'.  You'll receive
  an infinite supply of that treasure.

  Save your position in a dungeon.  Then go through it until you run out of
  keys.  When you restore your game, all the doors will be open and you will
  have a new set of keys.  Also works in caves.

  On the island with the Crystal Castle, press the right mouse button while
  talking to the Sorceress and your luck will go up to 65.  'ASK'ING the
  Sorceress several times will usually boost your luck.

  If running low on Green keys, use a secret entrance for the fort.  It's
  on the left side, almost even with the door.



  FALCON

  While playing the game, pressing <Ctrl>, <Shift> and <X> will replenish
  your weapons.  Another source states that it is only <Ctrl> and <X>
  that must be pressed, not <Shift>.

  If you get badly hit, don't bail out.  Instead swing round and head for
  home.  Press <HELP> and the <+> on the keypad and keep them depressed.
  (Insult them for ten minutes! HaHa!)  The F16 will stay level and drop
  down.  Switch to tracking mode and rotate to side view.  Just before
  touch down, pitch up the nose and the plane will touch down successfully
  every time.  Select end mission and you will be rescued even if you are
  in enemy territory.



  FANTASY WORLD DIZZY

  Enter your name as "IMMORTAL" on the high score table, and when you
  restart the game you should have infinite lives.



  FEDERATION OF FREE TRADERS

  *** Here is how to buy anything on the black market for one credit:

  Load the game.
  Enter the net.
  Type "help", and get yourself an ID number.
  Logoff the net.
  Press the <Backspace> at the bay doors.
  Blast off into space, and find a spaceship for you to trade with and get
   his ID number.
  Enter the net, logon, and press <T> and <Return>.
  You should be now in communication mode with the alien.
  Say hello, have a chat, keep pressing a key or whatever until he offers
   you some goods, such as Hypermint for example.
  At the prompt, straight after he has offered you something to buy, enter
   "1" and press <Return>.
  He will say something like no chance, or sign off.
  Logoff.

  Now everything you buy or sell, you will buy or sell it for 1 credit,
  even if you put 100 credits as an offer, you will still buy or sell it
  for 1 credit.  This only applies to Black Market trading, it will not
  work at a planet or space station.

  Try it.
  press <T> and <Return> to talk to the alien again.
  Say hello, keep pressing a key until he offers YOU something.

  Eg,
         Eh Guvnor, I have some business, do
         you want to buy some excellent
         Bath towels??
         I couldn't let them go for less than
         1100 credits, what do you say?

  Now a prompt comes up again as normal.
  Enter "Y" and press <Return>.
  He will now say something like "You have been done mate" or "Thanks,
  bye"

  Look at your inventory, and at the end you will see "TOWELS".  Now check
  at your credits, and you will see that you have 149 credits left.


  *** Here is how to sell any goods for heaps of money:

  Now here is the clincher, how to get rich quick using the above method.
  Press <T> and <Return> to talk to the alien again.
  Now keep at him until he offers you something.

  Eg,
         Listen, I'm a businessmen and
         I have got some Exquatle Hypermint
         that I couldn't let got for less
         than 2000 credits ?
         Make me an offer.

  Enter a large number, larger than the offer above, say "200000"
  and press <Return>.
  He will say, you have insufficent funds, and logoff.

  Now when you buy or sell anything, you will be buying/selling it for
  "200000".  It is like a counter, that the programmers have forgot to
  reset so that you can make it equal anything - is it a bug or what?
  Now, press <T> and <Return> to talk to the alien, make certain that
  you have got something to sell.

  Keep pestering him, until he says something like, "Have you got anything
  to trade?".
  Tell him what you have got, say "Bath Towels" for example.
  Now he says something like, "name your price"
  Enter "10" and press <Return>.
  It doesn't matter what you enter, as it is set at 200000 anyway.
  Now logoff and check your credits, you should have something like
  200149 credits.  Wow, go splash out on all that new weapons and stuff.

  But don't forget: if You want to buy anything from him, you have to go
  through the first routine to get the counter back to One credit.

  The top routine, is only to be used in buying, as it is no good trying to
  buy something, when it is set at 200000, eh?
  Likewise, the bottom routine is only used for selling, as you are a bit
  stupid if you try to sell your wares for 1 credit!



  FERNANDEZ MUST DIE (*)

  While playing, pause the game and type in "spinynorman" for infinite
  lives.



  FIGHTER BOMBER

  Enter your pilots name as "BUCKAROO", and `Oooooh Nooooo its a Buckaroo'
  should appear at the bottom of the screen.  You should now be able to
  start at any mission, and you can also press <D> at any stage to be tran-
  sported to the next waypoint.



  FINAL BLOW

  Pause the game, press <F10> six times and unpause.  This will probably
  do something amazing like making you invincible, but I'm not too sure
  about this.



  FINAL FIGHT

  When the game starts up: when the picture of the guy watching TV
  appears, wait until "not so fast Mike, turn on your TV" appears at the
  bottom of the screen and press <Help> as soon as it does.  Now you have
  infinite power.  Also, while you are playing, you can now press <+> to
  make all the evil dudes on the screen disappear.



  FIRST SAMURAI

  I'm not sure if either of these cheats work, but go ahead and try `em.
  (If one of them does work, how about writing in and telling me...hint
  hint?)

  When you load up disc one and the word "Goonies" appears, hold down one
  of these mystical keys for various effects:

  <F1> - Infinite energy and infinite weapons
  <F2> - Infinite Energy
  <F3> - Infinite Lives

  If this cheat should fail, and if you should yelleth `All Hail', then
  do not worry your sweet little head...try typing this one in instead!
  (brings a tear to the eyes, eh?)

  While playing the game, hit the pause button and type in "diputs".  Now
  you should be able to press any number key to teleport to different
  stages throughout the current level.



  FISH (Complete Solution)

  Part 1

  Tell Rod to make the coffee and then get the tapes from the bin.  The
  tape bin can be found in the cupboard in the secondary control room.
  Set the amplifier fader in the control room to a suitable level and
  clean the tape heads with the cleaner.  Play the tapes in the player
  and the producer will storm in and sing the combination to the cabinet
  in his office.  Get what you find inside it and you`ve solved the first
  part of Fish.

  Part 2

  Get dressed and pick up the torch from the rubbish in the cab.  Head
  east untill you get to the Abbey and find your way to the catacombs.
  Open the sarcophagus lid and find the ceremonial cord.  Go back up to
  the ruined transepts and turn off your torch.  Drag the pew past the
  hippier untill it`s beneath the arch; you can climb this by standing on
  the pew.  Tie the cord and collect the gargoyle.  Put it in its right-
  ful place.  Get the grommet from the chalice to complete part 2.  You
  may have to do this several times thanks to hippie interference.

  Part 3

  Time is critical in this part so don`t waste any.  Go south east to
  the smithy and free the budgie.  Return to Mickie (mind the bird) and
  get the disc from the stump when he leaves.  Return to the smithy and
  get the tools, gloves and mould.  Wear the gloves and place the disc in
  the crucible.  Hold it in the fire with tongs and pour it in the mould
  when it melts.  Take this to the cool glade avoiding Mickey and anywhere
  wet.  Let it cool for a few turns.  When this is done smash the mould
  with a hammer and lo and behold: HYDROPOLIS!

  Gain a high score and enter the following initials for special effects:

            RHL for acid men bullets
            JGL for full fire power
            KDJ for infinite lives

  Note that you enter the first two letters as normal, then press and hold
  <5> on the numerical keypad, then enter the third letter to register the
  cheat.



  FOOTBALL DIRECTOR 2

  Here's a way of starting the game with lotsa' money.

  Copy the game onto another disk - files are going to be changed so don't
  use the original.  Boot up the copy as normal, clicking on the `FD II'
  and `BOOT.BAS' icons as they appear.

  Enter the game as normal.  When it's up and running, select the `QUIT'
  option from the Main selection of the pull down menu.  A CLI window now
  appears.  Type "list" to list the `FOOT.BAS' part of the game.

  Using the cursor keys, edit the program lines 1514 and 2547 to read as
  follows :

  1514 NEXT
  NW=150+INT(RND*200)
  NW=INT(NW/AP)
  NV=200+INT(RND*300)
  NV=INT(NV/AP)
  AI=5000000pound sign+INT(RND*(500000pound sign/AP))
  NF=(5000+INT(RND*3000))/AP
  NP=INT(NP+NA+NF)
  GOTO 332

  2547 GOSUB 2548
  IF RA=9 AND AI>300000pound sign OR AI>1500000pound sign THEN ]2547
  GOTO 2548
  ]2547: RA=INT(AI/5000)
  PRINT TAB(5);
  PA5
  PRINT "DIRECTORS WITHDRAW";
  PA1         "
  PRINT TAB(30);
  MONEY INT(RA)
  PRINT TAB(38);"-"
  JR=JR-RA

  In line 1514 making AI equal 5,000,000 provides $5M starting budget; this
  can be changed to suit, however Line 2547 making RA=INT(AI/5000) stops the
  directors from withdrawing too much cash every week.

  Click on the `close window' icon for the window containing the program
  text, and save the amended program file by typing: save "FOOT.BAS"

  To run the amended disk, boot up the disk as normal, by clicking on the
  FD II icon.  When the BOOT.BAS icon is clicked the message BAD FILE MODE
  appears.  Accept this by using the OK box.
  Close the CLI window containing the few lines of text, by clicking on the
  close window icon.

  Type "load".  A message box appears prompting for the name of the program
  to load.  Using the left hand mouse button click on the text bar and type
  this: FOOT.BAS

  When the OK message appears, type "RUN".  The program should now start as
  normal with plenty of dosh to spend.



  FOOTMAN

  In the first maze of "New Taste", you can hide from the ghosts and collect
  points from the fruit that emerges periodically, if you go to the upper
  left corner entrance to the tunnel.

  pressing <S> takes you to the shop and <N> will advance you a level.



  FORMULA ONE GRAND PRIX

  When taking part in the next non-championchip event, drive around until
  you are on the last lap.  When you next visit the pits, drive in and
  pull up to the pit crew.  Wait until the "Race Over" message appears,
  and no matter what position you were in, you will have won the race.



  FULL CONTACT

  Start the game in one player mode and type in "QAZWXEDCRFVTGBYHNUJM"
  and your opponent should give up and die before you complete the
  sequence.  Once you have done this, DO NOT press <S> as this will crash
  the machine.



  FUSION

  Enter your name as "SWAMP THING" on the high score table.  Then, while
  playing, <T> cycles through extra weapons, <B> activates large bullets,
  <S> gives you shields, and <E> brings up a cheat mode where levels may be
  selected by pressing the <+> or <-> keys on the numeric keypad.

  Another source speakest thusly:

  Start the game, get into the ship and fly to the top left corner of the
  level.  Leave the ship and drive the assualt crawler right into the
  corner.  Type "STONKER" and re-enter the ship.  Now you can press <D>
  to zip through the weapons available and press <C> to cycle the levels.
  Re-accessing the cheat mode on level two allows you to collect switches
  whilst flying over them by simply pressing <F>.



  FUTURE WARS

  After you have travelled into the future, been into the sewer and
  discovered the beast attacking the woman and her child, and also have
  the fuses and have uncovered the tap, go back up to the surface and hunt
  through the rubble until you find the blowtorch.  Take this down into the
  sewer, fill it with gas from the tap and incinerate the monster.

  GAME OVER 2

  The code for level two is 11423



  GARFIELD (Complete Solution)

  From the start screen go left untill you come to the front door with
  the cat flap.  Pick up the red rubber bone and drop it next to the cat
  flap.  Wait untill Odie opens the cat flap and then move back to the
  start screen with the green chair and go through the door.  Pick up the
  torch and go into the back yard.  Enter the shed and fall down the hole.
  Walk right untill you come to an alley and then go up to it.  Carry on
  right and down until you get to Nermal.  You'll need to kick him
  repeatedly untill he drops the mouse and then move odie to pick up the
  mouse and leave the sewer.

  You should then drop the mouse off at the health shop.  A spinach donut
  will fall and you need to take this to the rat in the sewer.  Drop him
  the donut and he`ll stop.  Then go to the chest, kick it and pick up the
  key.  Take the key to the park and drop it next to the lady on the bench.

  The next step is to fetch either the bucket from the garden or the spade
  from the shed and take it to the hardware store.  By using it in the shop
  you can gain a one dollar bill which may be used to buy some bird seed
  from the health food shop.  Take the bird seed to the park and drop it
  next to the key.  Quickly lift up the key and stand still.  The duck
  will pick you up and drop you in the dog pound.  Walk right and go up
  the alley.

  Go right again and all that`s left to do is get a big smacker from
  Arlene.  Yeah!



  GAUNTLET

  one, don't move, and press Option 1.

  key.  Hold down the <Insert> key while you open the chest.  Release
  <Insert> and hold the joystick down.  Now pressing the <Help> key will
  give you 5000 health points.

  To avoid tricky levels, pause the game and wait for three minutes.
  Press Fire and all the walls turn to exits.  This happens anyway, but
  if you pause the game, you don't lose energy and won't get attacked while
  waiting.  To get into the secret room, clear the dungeon completely,
  picking up the super shots last, then go to the exit without pressing
  fire.



  GEMINI WING

  GENGHIS KHAN

  If you get a land that isnt connected with an enemy, move everything to
  your home country.  The land will be safe, but if another leader captures
  a nearby land, make sure you put something back in or he will attack on
  his next turn.

  Do not move all your forces into your command unit, or an the enemy
  commander will wait till he is down to his last few men and challenge you
  to a one on one fight.  If you lose he will get half your command unit.



  GHOSTBUSTERS 2

  When the Activision logo appears, hold down the keys <Alt>, <Ctrl>, <S>

  levels.



  GIGANOID

  On the Select Player screen, press <Caps Lock> and you should 100 lives
  and a message.



  GLOBULOUS

  The most important thing to remember is that ALL the puzzles can be solved
  without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its the only way to
  solve the screen, look closely.  Some of the puzzles get pretty obscure
  after level 10, but once you eventually beat them you'll kick yourself for
  not seeing the solution earlier.

  Look before you leap.  Think about how the screen will look from a flipped
  perspective.  A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary and waste time
  and switches if you don't.

  Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen.  It is
  possible to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up or
  kill yourself, and the only way out is to press <Esc> and start the whole
  game over again.

  Here are a few codes you might like to try:

  Level 06 - IVEs8AZ?
  Level 11 - dynle1cJ



  GODS

  Select the `Enter Password' option and type in "SORCERY".  You should

  See GREMLINS - same cheat.



 HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

  Level 11: SPIN

  Level 31: BALL
  Level 41: GOAL
  Level 51: LEFT
  Level 61: TWIN
  Level 71: PLAY



  HERO'S QUEST

  Save you game frequently. Don't just overwite an existing save, either:
  give each save a different name to keep your options open.

  In the early part of the game it pays to practice to improve any of your
  abilities such as climbing (climb rocks, tree, walls...) anything to get
  your points higher.

  Practice throwing rocks at anything, but if you have bought some daggers
  from the shop use the target south of the town for practice so that you
  can get them back!

  To improve your fighting skills, Goblins can always be found in their
  camp and are not too difficult to kill.  Each time you enter their camp
  you will be attacked by one more Goblin than on your previous visit.
  Goblin-killing can also be quite profitable, because searching a body
  usually results in finding some silver.

  Staying alive is helped considerably if you can afford to buy Healing
  Potions and Vigor Potions from the Healer.  You can buy them from Zara
  in the town, but they are more expensive.

  *** Making Money

  Fairly easy ways of getting money early in the adventure include
  collecting Magic Mushrooms from the Fairy Ring and collecting flowers
  from Erana's Peace to sell to the Healer.  She will buy three lots of
  these, so PICK three times to save on journeys.

  You can earn five silvers for cleaning out the stables in the Castle,
  BUT be careful not to start too late in the afternoon.  If it is sunset
  before you get back into town you could be in trouble.

  *** Sleep Safe

  In town there's no problem if you can afford to pay the Inn-keeper for
  a bed, but outside town there are only three safe places to get your
  essential kip.  Erana's Peace is safe and you also get all your Health,
  Vigor, Magic Points, etc renewed.  By the Dryad's tree is safe, if you
  can get to it.

  Finally the hermit 'Enry will put you up for a price of 1 Food, though
  unless you can climb you won't be able to get up to his cave.

  *** Thief's Guild

  Contrary to what Bruno by the town gate may tell you, find the Thief's
  Guild by going up to the Goon in the Tavern and saying "Schweinhund".
  In the Guild you can 'fence' any property you have stolen after picking
  the locks to the Sheriff's house and the Old Lady's House.

  *** Help With The Quests

  If you can climb, or if you have Magic with the Fetch spell, you can
  find the Gold Ring lost by the Healer in the nest in the tree outside
  her house.

  When you have built up your abilities and can defeat the Ogre, enter
  the cave of the Bear. He will let you pass if you give him food.  You
  can then enter the cave of the kobold.  He is very difficult to kill,
  but if you throw about 80 rocks at him you will succeed.  Remember,
  before you enter the Bear's cave PICK UP ROCKS.  Repeat this until you
  can carry no more.
  You will almost certainly run out of rocks during your fight, but just
  come out again and get some more before returning to THROW ROCK AT
  KOBOLD.  When he dies, pick up the key that he had been wearing, then
  SEARCH THE CAVE.  You will find a chest that contains money.  Return to
  the Bear and use the kobold's key on a manacle on the Bear's leg.  Stand
  by for a surprise!

  Another quest which requires great fighting ability before attempting
  starts with a visit to the Dryad.  After getting a Spirea seed for the
  Dryad, you are given a list of ingredients to obtain and take to the
  Healer. She will then make a Dispel Potion for you.
  You must then go to the valley where the Archers are.  Run to the logs
  and jump over.  You then fight a series of Brigands with no chance to
  pause and restore your health by drinking any potions, so you must be
  fit before entering the valley.  When you defeat the Brigands you come
  to a gate guarded by a Minotaur.  Kill him, search him and kick the gate
  open.

  You now enter the barracks. Go left round the blockades, then go across
  the right-hand plank over the chasm.  Step over the trip-wire between
  the barriers at the back of the room.  This takes you to the Brigands'
  meeting room.

  LOCK THE DOOR and go to the top right and GET CHAIR. As soon as the
  chair is in place, MOVE CANDELABRA.  Three Brigands will now be behind
  the table, so move in front of the table opposite the right-hand
  chair.

  Wait - the Brigands will now retrace their steps, and when the first of
  them comes to the left-hand end of the table type CLIMB ON TABLE USE
  ROPE.  After the action, don't hang about!
  Open the door at the back of the room and go out.  This will take you to
  a very strange room (ME's room) which you will eventually have to leave
  via the left-hand door on the end wall

  It's a lot of fun, but I suggest you save on entering and during this
  room.  The next room is the Brigand Leader's room.  THROW DISPEL POTION
  on the Leader and stand by for another surprise!

  Another quest can be completed from this point if you have already
  opened the gate to Baba Yaga's hut.  Take the healing potions from the
  Leader's desk and also the Mirror. Go to the hut and when Baba Yaga
  enters, HOLD UP MIRROR.  Exit Baba Yaga!

  The gate to Baba Yaga's hut is opened by the Skull in return for the
  Glowing Gem - I hope you haven't sold it - which in turn you get from
  the Frost Giant for a price of about 70 apples, which you get from
  the shop.



  HEROES OF THE LANCE

                           Level 6: GARLIC

  In addition, entering "BOGEYMAN" will give you infinite lives.



  HOSTAGES

  1st Stage - Whenever possible hide behind walls, or in doorways if you
              are about to be spotted by a searchlight, as lying down or
              doing a roll isn't always effective.

  2nd Stage - When placing your men around the top of the building, put
              them all on the same side.  The best side is the bottom one.
              Now press <F1> which will show you the side where your men
              are placed.  Scan the top windows first for an empty room.
              You should see the men dangling from ropes, if not then you
              have got the wrong side fool!  You should send your first man
              in on the top floor.  If all the windows have silhouettes,
              the hostages are the one's with a slightly fatter silhouette
              at the window than the terrorist's silhouette.  If you shoot
              a hostage at the window by mistake, you might as well start
              again.  Don't forget there are only 3 hostages !!

              When your first man has entered a window on the top floor,
              clean the top floor of all terrorists (in green, hostages are
              blue - they also don't move around much).  When you have
              killed your first terrorist, position your gun where he once
              stood, so when you burst in on the next one, you don't have
              to mess about positioning your gun, but can shoot him
              straight away.  When top floor is clear move your man to the
              top right room, (the one with only one door) and stand him in
              that room with his back to the door.  That way, when you have
              a hostage you can take him to this safe room, and leave him,
              as any terrorists can't get in through the door because one
              of your men is protecting the door, but you can still get in
              and out.

              Now bring another man in through the top floor, still leaving
              one man in the top right room protecting hostages you leave
              there.  Now go forth and find them hostages!  If there is a
              terrorist with a hostage behind him, DON'T shoot the terror-
              ist as you will kill the hostage.  Instead run straight into
              the room and straight at the hostage/terrorist, so you and
              them occupy the same space.  Don't stop, keep holding forward
              and you should be on the other side of the room, as the
              hostage follows you but the terrorist doesn't.  BUT, doing
              this you have to be very QUICK!  Now take the hostage to the
              top floor, the top right room, where your first man is on
              guard.  Walk into this room and back out again, the hostage
              will stay there.  Now you are free to go and get another one.
              Once all hostages have been successfully rescued, Game over !



  HUDSON HAWK

  Typing in "SCIENCEFICTION" on the title screen should reward you with

  different location.

  Alternatively, typing in any of the words below causes a line of text to
  appear on the screen: ANBK, ANGL, EDHK, FOOK, GLZP, GPZP, SIMR, STEW,
  SUNL, or TOTO.

  it properly.  Now return to the control menu and access the demo mode
  menu.  You may notice that a third option, "Do a 147 Break", is now
  available.  Select this and watch `n' weep as the computer executes the
  ultimate break.  Also, during a one player game, if you commit a foul,
  press both mouse buttons to get another shot.



  JOAN OF ARC

  - Defence of the Wall

  As soon as the screen changes start pressing fire to launch rocks.  Use
  oil when time is short or when two or more enemies are coming up the
  same ladder.  Even though it says that oil is limited, there are at least
  five cauldrons at your disposal.

  - Entry to Town

  As soon as the screen has loaded push right and keep pushing right until
  the end.  When an enemy appears keep fire pressed until he is slain.
  Release fire and your man should run straight up the drawbridge.  Repeat
  this until you get into town.

  - Attack on the Wall

  Push the joystick forwards as soon as the screen changes.  Keep pushing
  forwards until the wall is taken.  Use the fire button to ward off the
  rocks until the top is reached.

  - Game Strategy

  At the start of the game ORLEANS must be taken.  Select `Start A
  Campaign' and then displacement to move north into Orleans.  Here you
  should encounter your first battle.

  - Battle Tactics

  Hold your ground and wait to be attacked.  As soon as the enemy move,
  shower them with arrows and then with mortars.  Move your troops forward
  to protect your archers and send your cavalry out (they are likely to
  be killed).  While your troops are fighting, remember to fire your
  arrows if the remainder of the enemy moves forward to attack.

  On the defeat of the enemy, choose `Offensive' and attack Orleans.  Use
  the `Entry in to town' and `Attack on the Wall' tips to succeed.  After
  capturing Orleans move north east into Champagne and take Rheims to
  crown the king.

  After the coronation move north taking each town in every province until
  you have reached the northern most province.  Sweep anti-clockwise until
  each province has been taken.

  Joan's army soon becomes depleted; choose `Royal Army' and then `Mod-
  ification' to top up her army.  About 2,000 archers and 3,000 troops are
  enough.  To pay for this collect the tithe in September but forget about
  the other taxes.  This will avoid any uprising, but means that you will
  have to ransom some hostages.  Choose `Diplomacy' and then `Liberation',
  deal with Henry VI and use Regnault of Chatres and Tremoille as ambass-
  adors.  The meeting place does not really matter.

  - Ransom Demand Guidelines

  Duke of Bedford         $4,000,000
  Duke of Warwick         $2,000,000
  Duke of Gloucester      $2,000,000
  John Talbot             $1,000,000
  Count of Suffolk        $1,000,000
  Cardinal of Winchester  $1,000,000
  Captain Falstaff        $1,000,000

  If you are really desperate halve the ransom.  If your coffers are
  overflowing, execute one of them using the `Royal Justice' Menu, which
  will reduce the number of armies that Henry VI can control.

  Any French characters caught should be executed promptly.  If there are
  no hostages when payday comes choose `Helping Hand' and kidnap one.  Do
  not try for the Dukes because these attempts are most likely to fail.
  Remember to pay well - $20,000 is the right incentive.  If Joan is
  caught, Richemont, War General is a good replacement.



  JUDGE DREDD

  Log on the computer as "DREDD" then type in "BRUCKEN PLAYING HEROQUEST"
  and exit.  Now use the <Help> key to skip levels.



  JUG

  On the title screen hold down <Escape> and click the mouse pointer on
  the right edge of the picture to activate the cheat mode.  This will
  give you infinite energy and lives.



 KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK



  KARATE KID 2

  Enter your name as "MYAGI" in the high scores table and when playing,
  pressing <P> will advance you a level.



  KICK OFF 2 (*)

  If your opponents goalie is too good for you, run your finger along the
  function keys, and "S12" or "S14" shouls appear in the top right hand
  corner of the screen.   You should now be able to substitute one of your
  players for your opponents goalie.   This sub. goalie is usually pretty
  useless, and if you repeat the process he will be even worse.



  KID GLOVES

  Pause the game and type in "RHIANNON" then <F6> will take you to the
  shop, <F8> will give you lots of money, and <F9> toggles immunity on/off.



  KILLING GAME SHOW (*)

  Press <Help> on the "Good Luck" screen for a map of the level.



  KING SOLOMONS MINES

  To get past the mosquitoes you need the bottle from the oasis.  You have
  to dig to find it.  Inside are Anti-maleria tablets.  Use the rope to get
  past the swamp, then go north into the quicksand.  Quickly throw the rope
  and then pull until your free.  To cross the bridge, throw the spear,
  then go to the bridge, and when it starts to collapse, type "RUN" then
  jump.



  KINGS QUEST 3 (*)

  The wand is in the cabinet in the wizards study.   The key is on the top
  of the closet in the wizards bedroom.   You have to be an eagle to get
  into the cave.   The key to the door behind the mirror is in the skele-
  tons hand.

  KLAX

  While playing, pressing <4> on the main keyboard takes you to level 100.



  KRISTAL

  Fights - Proficent swordplay is essential if your to get anywhere in
  the game.  The neck chop is one of the more effective blows, but the
  program blocks repetition of single moves.  To get around this,
  occassionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck chop
  once again.  Give generously to the poor and youll be a step closer to
  obtaining the Sword of the Spheres.

  The Palace - To enter the palace, youll need to get the invitation
  from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala.  Once you have it, keep out of
  fights or you could lose it for good.  When you get into the palace,
  ask Nedrod three questions and he will give you the talisman, which
  can help you find another useful item.  Answer the Princess's question
  with "Its a secret".  She will give you the Ring of Belz, which will
  only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

  In General - Objects are not always found in the same places from game
  to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is often in
  order.  To survive the final confrontation, a high psychic rating is
  needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to the poor.  Dis-
  orderly conduct can have the opposite effect.  The safest technique in
  the space battles, is to slow right down as soon as you see the aliens
  shoot them all, then power at full steam until the next lot.  Follow
  Readheads ship if you see it.  Heatpro tablets are necessary if you
  beam down to one of the hotter planets.  Makes notes of what you are
  told, and use any new names or subjects to weavel out every last bit
  of information from the characters.



  KULT

  Firstly, here is how to complete the five ordeals:

  * The Twins - Object = Goblet

  Go to the source on the left hand side.  Inspect the fountain and press
  the eye.  Fill the Goblet and go back to the room called `The Twins'.
  Open the left-hand serpent and empty the goblet into it.  Get the die
  that emerges from the serpent then open the right hand serpent.  Throw
  the die, and note the number thrown.  Put the die into the right-hand
  serpent and go to the room facing you.  The hands are in a dice formation
  (except for the middle one).  Pull up the hands until they resemble the
  formation you threw earlier, then push the serpent's head on the wall.
  The sliding partition should open; note down the shape which it covered.
  Go back to the fountain room and inspect each cube (each is patterned).
  Lift the cube which resembles the one you found behind the sliding
  partition.

  * In the Scorpion's Presence - Object = Fly

  Pray to the statue then enter the room called `The Web'.  Look at the
  web on the floor and crawl on it.  Give the mistress the fly; show
  affection but don't be too saucy with her.  Feed the fly to the blue
  spider and get the red one.  Leave the room, and then put the red spider
  into the statue's mouth.  Don't listen to the man who pops out, just pass
  through trapdoor.

  * The Wall - Object = Dagger  (can use psi-shift!)

  First choose the third zone, then the second zone; this means that you
  can unlock the sliding wall when you open either door.  Go through either
  door, left or right, and inspect the step.  Then take a look at the slot
  on the Sculpted Warrior and climb onto the step.  Either put your dagger
  into the slot, or if you haven't got one, use Psi-Shift.  You will be
  spun around by the wall.  There are now TWO seperate gaps in the wall,
  one which goes straight on, and the other is a dark, black strip; it
  depends on which door you have taken.  Move the cursor to go down the
  black passage, not straight on.  Stick your hand in the gap on the floor.
  Return the way you came, and this time go straight on.

  * De Profundis - Object = Rope

  First of all, wait.  Then lasso your rope onto the hook on the ceiling.
  When the Granite Monster lurks towards you, jump onto him.  Wait a few
  minutes.

  * The Noose - Object = None

  Do not do as the Poormouth says.  Use either the lantern, or your Solar
  Eyes Power.  Grab hold of left hand rope and climb up.  Push the lever,
  remove the noose-rope and he will fall.  Take the left-hand piece of
  rope.  Inspect the hollow on the platform.  Finally, leave and go to the
  Master's Orbit.


  * What to do after you have got the five Skulls

  Give all five skulls to the Protozorg underneath the trader.  He will
  announce that you are a divot.  Go to the concourse outside the ring,
  and remember, if you are asked any questions, show the egg you were
  given.  Once you are in the concourse, ignore the guard and use all the
  violence you can muster on the upper right-hand guard; then enter the
  upper right-hand passage.

  Go left.  Inspect the toad's head and poke it's eye.  Use the Lantern
  (if you have it) or the Solar Eyes to see.  Inspect the lever and the
  trapdoor.  Use Psi-Shift on the lever and pass through the trapdoor.
  Next keep going straight through until you meet Norma Jean and Ash.  You
  MUST do as Norma Jean says.  Don't move!  Tell her the truth...talk to
  both of them and then use your Zone Scan.  Lift your block on the floor
  and get both objects, the beam and the flask.  Unwrap the bandages from
  the mummy, go to the left and keep going forward.

  By going through the trapdoor you will enter the Threshold of Truth.
  Kill the priestess and put the egg in the opened mouth.  Next off, take
  a look at the Lantern.  Read the book, then use your Psi-Shift on the
  statuette to retrieve it on the left-hand side, near the ceiling.

  Leave and go to the refectory, then go to Saura's Repose.  Put the
  statuette you found into the niche then go to the Presence of God, and
  then to Placating the Powers.  Kill the first priestess, then make use
  of Psi-Shift on Saura's Mark, aiming it at her dagger.  Use Brain Warp
  on the character, Sci-Fi, then giver her the flask to drink.  Go to
  Saura's Repose, putting the monkey into the small tunnel.  Enter the
  Presence of God and wait.  Go into the passage.  Wait.  Use aggro on the
  god, Zorg, and then use Brain Warp on Pratozim, who is holding Sci-Fi
  hostage.  Use Psi-Shift on trap door, and finally, throw the knife or
  dagger at Pratozim.
