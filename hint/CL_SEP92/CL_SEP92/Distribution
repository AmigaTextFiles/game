  CheatList / PokeList  --  Distribution

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Shareware Policy:

  CheatList is Shareware.  This means that if you find it useful, you
  should register with me for extra support. 

  Note that this information is much more recent than the stuff at the
  start of the main CheatList file: that information was written before
  the distribution method underwent major changes.  So this is the
  important stuff!

  People living in Australia can register by sending A$10, in either postal
  order, cheque or cash (not recommended, but if you have to, wrap some 
  paper around it or something).  On receipt of your registration, your 
  name will be added to my users list, you will be informed that your money
  has been received, and every time another release of CheatList is ready,
  you will receive a note through the mail informing you of this.

  People living outside Australia can register by sending either a bank 
  draft or international money order for A$20 (the increased cost is 
  necessary for the greater postage charges - sorry!).  Similarly, on 
  receipt of your registration, your name will be added to my users list,
  you will receive notification that I have your registration, and every
  time another release of CheatList is available, you will be notified.

  As a registered user, whenever you receive a notice through the mail
  notifying you of the next release, you can order that release by
  sending half the registration fee ($5 inside Australia, $10 outside)
  using the same methods.  So, if you feel like, for example, ordering
  only every second release, you can.  I will continue to send release
  notices until either you tell me that you no longer wish to receive
  them, or until four releases go by without you ordering one.  If you
  wish to once again receive notices, you can write to me and inform me
  of the fact, and I'll start bothering you again. :-)

  If you no longer need or want the use of CheatList, please notify me
  of the fact!  I don't mind sending these reminders but don't want to
  waste my money!

  I think this method will work for everyone - it's pretty simple to
  follow and to use.  I hope to hear from you soon.

  Distribution:

  CheatList is Copyright ©1991-92-93 Peter Monk.
  CheatList and PokeList cannot be passed off as anybody else's work!

  Only issues up to and including the September 1992 release are freely re-
  distributable.  All files distributed with the List should remain with 
  the List unaltered.  Both the CheatList and PokeList files should remain
  totally unaltered and entire. 

  Please don't give any release past September 1992 to any Public Domain
  vendor, or upload it onto a Bulletin Board.  In fact, I encourage you to
  give copies of the September 1992 release to whoever you want (for no 
  more than a small copying charge, of course, and as long as all secondary
  files remain with it), just no release past that one.

  Vendors of Public Domain and Shareware material can sell any release
  up to and including the September 1992 release for a small copying fee. 
  Please do not accept any release past that one into your collection.

 
  Please observe all conditions set out above.  I have tried to make them
  easy to understand, as it's usually easier to abide by the rules if you
  know what they are!

  Thanks a lot, and I hope you find CheatList and PokeList useful.

  CheatList is a Shareware file.
  PokeList is a Freeware file.

  See the "Fullview.Doc" file on disk for details on the use and distri-
  bution of the file displayer Fullview.  Only applicable if Fullview
  is in this distribution, of course: Fish disk distributions may contain
  a different viewer.

  If you have any questions regarding the distribution of CheatList, get
  in contact with me at the usual address.  (In the other doc file.)

  Final Plea: Please register.  CheatList is a great resource that has
              been under construction for over a year and a half, and
              I would hate to see it go under due to lack of support.
