  LAST DUEL

  While playing, pause the game with <F9> and hold down the <Help>, left
  <Shift> and <1> keys together.   Unpause, and pressing the Function keys
  will take you through the levels, and <F8> will give you 5 lives.



  LAST NINJA

  To get past the dragon at the end of level one, you must stand at the far
  left side of the path just at the beginning of the Dragons rocky lair.
  Throw a smoke bomb and if you are on target the Dragon will fall asleep.
  You can now walk past without getting killed.



  LAST NINJA 2

  To board the helicopter at the end of level 5, you must first allow the
  helicopter to leave the screen, then run to the end of the building and
  jump in the direction that the helicopter went, making sure that you
  completely exit the screen.



  LAST NINJA 3

  According to issue 27 of ZERO magazine (best mag!), to access the cheat
  mode in this game, do the following: Gently moisten the underside of a
  wild hedgehog with warm milk, turn it upside-down and shave its left leg.
  Now place it on the keyboard for infinite lives.  Compilers Note: I don't
  how much good this will do the keyboard, the hedgehog or your sanity, but
  go ahead and try it if you really feel the urge.

  If for some strange reason this fails to work, try typing these codes in
  on the high score table:

  Level 1: SUSS
  Level 2: IMED
  Level 3: URTI
  Level 4: BASD
  Level 5: NOUS
  Level 6: RERO



  LEANDER

  Here are a couple of codes:

  Level 2: ZXFT
  Level 3: LVFT

  Also, after you have typed in the appropriate code, enter the letters
  "LTUS" for infinite lives and the ability to select any weapon using
  function keys <F1> through to <F5>.



  LEATHER GODDESSES OF PHOBOS

  The answer to the Sultan's riddle is "Riddle".  To get past the assassin
  in space, fight him until he is disarmed.  Take his sword and give it
  back to him.  He will then realise that you are a good guy, and that he
  has no chance of winning.  He will then kill himself.



  LEATHERNECK

  While playing, type in "CUTHBERTNECK", then pressing <F3> will make you
  invincible.



  LED STORM

  On the title screen, type "DAVID BROADHURST  WANTS TO CHEAT" (put two
  spaces between the second and third words) for infinite lives.  If this
  doesn't work, then See STRIDER - same cheat.

  LORDS OF THE RISING SUN

  Yoshitsune is more skilled at fighting than yoritomo, so at the start of
  the game make sure you have almost full strength and men before you try
  attacking anything.  Your main objective now, because you are near
  maximum status, is to deal with your brother and to capture enemy castles.
  If you take over enemy castles, the enemy troops will have nowhere to
  recruit more men and all your brother's men and land is yours if he dies.
  Your next job is to try and secure the eastern half of the island.  To do
  this, take over all the castles and destroy or recruit all the armies on
  that side of the island.  Now concentrate on the rest of the island.  In
  Edo try to leave a general with the least siege abilities as he probably
  won't need to siege castles anymore.  Remember one general will do and
  if the general is at Edo, Nagoya will be easier to storm by boat.  If
  you can send a general from Akita to Matsue via Aikawa you will have a
  good base from which you attack the western catles.

  Once you have complete control over the main island then you should be
  able to wipe out the remaining four castles on the 2 smaller islands.
  Don't go for these unless you have a very firm base otherwise you will
  have to trek all the way back should a range trooper take over the
  castle.

  Yoritomo

  A great politician and strategist but try to take Edo first because it's
  the only castle you won`t have to lay siege to take.  If you`re lucky
  though, you may reach Toyama or Nigata before anyone else.  The same
  rules apply to yoritomo as with yoshitsune: wait until you nearly have
  a full army before attacking.  Be careful if you get into any fights,
  because you have a low battle skill and a smaller army with a higher
  skill can easily wipe you out.  At the begining of the game try to avoid
  taking risks and instead concentrate on improving your skills.  If you
  ever fight your brother and survive long enough, chase him on horseback,
  because if you slay him things can change drmatically.

  Overall...

  Participate in battles as you tend to lose more men if you don`t.
  Chasing the general on horseback often leads to early victory as you can
  wipe out armies in one battle instead of at the end of the game, and once
  you`re confident it`s possible to do it every time: but do not engage in
  the siege sequence, because losing can be costly.  The most important
  factor in battle is strength and long jorneys can weary your troops, so
  ensure they have plenty of rest before a battle.  An army coming by sea
  will be tired but faster and more flexible, so meet them on the shore
  and the advantage will be with your men.

  Whichever character you`ve chosen, try to isolate the rest of the island
  so you`re more able to concentrate on attacking the enemy and won't have
  to worry about defensive manoeuveres and precautions: but watch out for
  the enemy trying to out-flank you.  The islands will all be bitterly
  fought over, so ensure that your troops have confident stength before
  attacking.  The islands are well worth going for though, because they
  are ideal resting places for a tired force and good generals can inter-
  change their armies from island to mainland without meeting to many
  problems.

  The key to early victory is to recruit many more armies than your enemy,
  thus trapping him in a spiders web and gradually wearing him down (of
  course he can always try the same tactic on you, so beware).  It's
  important to have a strong hold on north and south Japan, as a rogue
  force can wreck havoc and open up flanks, causing all sorts of problems.
  If you`re unsure of your force, avoid battles because he who fights and
  runs away really does live to fight another day.  Ninja assassins may
  sound appealing, but only resort to them as a last resort and don`t send
  them too hard a mission because they might turn back and recognise you
  as the enemy.

  MAD PROFESSOR MARIATI

  Here is the solution for the Chemistry Lab level:

  From the starting screen, head left and trip the switch that you find
  there.  This turns off some of the deadly electrical devices and allows
  you to enter a previously inaccessible screen.  Go up the ladder and
  walk to the left, then use the conveyor belt to fall down and collect
  the crowbar.
  Next make your way to the auto ladder.  Use the crowbar and jump on the
  lever three times.

  Go up and collect the jam jar, before returning down and heading right
  to where the other jar is.  Go down two levels and head right.  Use the
  jam jars, and you will be able to read the tiny password and pass through
  the locked door.  Go right.  Collect the hammer and take it up to the
  top level.

  Head left and collect the phial (there's a clue about a "strong aroma"),
  and head down to where the 'test your strength' machine is.  Use the
  potion and the hammer and you will ring the bell, revealing an oil can
  as your prize.  Take this up to the top-right hand screen and use it on
  the pipe and, voila, you have completed the level!

  MIDWINTER

  At the start of the game:

  You are on skis.  Don't stop to snipe.  Get as quickly as you can to the
  nearest garage.  You need missiles against the bombers.  Try to get a
  Wolf snow-buggy.  You can dodge the mortars on skis the same way as on
  a buggy: turn quickly 90 degrees and speed off.  If you stop to snipe,
  the mortars will get you.  When you get the snow-buggy speed to your
  next point while blasting the bombers as they appear.

  Tips On Invulnerability

  ** Against missiles
  Whether you are skiing or driving a snow-buggy, the moment you hear the
  missile being launched, stop immediately and begin to turn around.  Keep
  turning on the spot.  The missile will narrowly miss you then come back
  and keep pace alongside you for a while until it finally speeds off to
  clobber someone else not so smart.

  ** Against mortars
  Watch for the bomber. It will always come over the horizon in front of
  you.  If you are stopped, wait until it is approximately half way to
  you (otherwise it may be able to dodge your missile) then blast it.  If
  you are moving quickly, blast it the moment it appears over the horizon.
  If a bomber does manage to drop mortars, turn 90 degrees quickly and
  speed off.



  MIGHT AND MAGIC 2 (*)

  To earn heaps of experience points, make a backup of your original play
  disc.  Now boot and insert the disk that contains your characters.  Save
  them onto your second backup by going to the inn.  Buy three tickets
  (green, yellow, red or black) and try to win in all three arenas.
  Remember to save after each victory.  Once you have a victory in each
  arena, go to the castle where the bishop is held captive.  Before enter-
  ing flick the write protect tab to protect your disk.  Then enter and
  free the bishop with the correct key.  He will give you 10,000 experience
  points if you have won three fights of the same color.   Exit and go to
  town.  Open the write protect tab and save at the inn.  You can repeat
  this several times.  Once you have acquired mega-experience, save your
  party using your original backup of the play disk.

  Hirelings

  - Dead Eye and Red Duke are in Bozorc's (BOSS ORC) control in D1 at
    14,01.

  - Sir Kill and Jed I are in Sarakin's Mines.  Unfortunately, you have
    to kill Sarakin first (and his undead friends!)

  - Might Nakazama and Lord Peabody's servant Sherman were last seen having
    some problems with amazons near Native's Cove at 10,1.

  - A couple of guys are in prison in Atlantium - break `em out!

  - A couple of kids are in kept in prison by kobolds in kobold's HQ in the
    dungeons beneath Middlegate

  - Buy fried troll's liver at bar in Vulcania.  I think there are a couple
    of hirelings who like your taste...But ya gotta demonstrate your skills
    to them first... (So what is killing a dozen cripples and misers...)

  - A couple of hirelings are almost dinner for the snowbeast in Tundara.
    Kill the snowbeast (in the outer walls of the city), skip the emerald
    ring or you will be accused of murder, and save the 2 hirelings.

  - A lichlord guards a high level wizard in Area D3.

  - A couple of guys are currently being held in prison in Castle Hillstone.

  - Anyway, with the exception of Sherman, most of the hirelings are not
    necessary to win the game.  They are nice to have around.  The most a
    hireling can cost is 50000 gold a day.  There is a list of all the
    hirelings and their locations in the hall of hirelings in Castle Xabran.


  General:

  - New tips appear in the bars every odd, even, 30th and 180th days.
  - Catch a Ferry to Murray's resort isle at C3-7,9.
  - Star Burst is in the centre of the Dead Zone
  - The password for use at Square lake is WAFE

  - To unlock the frozen secrets of evil, try Right 46, Left 23.
  - To free the mystic Thaumaturge of Good, enter Right 32, Left 64.

  - Go to bar in Tundara and eat red-hot wolf nipple chips.  Then go to
    Druid's Grove (C3 - 1,9) and you will find a druid eating the same
    thing.  He'll like your breath so much he will give you the Nature's
    Gate spell

  - For the clerical Divine Intervention spell,  Go to the Druid's Cave,
    and at 14,15 is a arch druid who needs a favor from you.  Find Horvath!
    Well, Horvath is within the cave (5,3?) find him and kill him.  Horvath
    is a pretty tough opponet so beware.  If you succeed, go  back to the
    druid and he will grant you this spell.

  - For the Eagle Eyes spell, complete Nordon's quest in Middlegate, and
    this spell is part of the reward.

  - You will need some sort of protection to get the Starburst spell!
    It is supposed to be in the middle of the Dead Zone, but I do not
    know anyone who has actually got it.

  - For the Enchant Item spell, find the Gemmaker in the Gemmaker's Cave
    (D1 - 10,12? - a bit north of Vulcania!)  The Gemmaker is at 3,3 in
    the dungeon.  Warning: His fee is TIME! (Your character gets AGED.)

  - A list of all spells to be found is at the Hall of spells in Castle
    Xabran.

  - On days 140-170 at B2 - 14,4 (the circus grounds), there is a circus.
    Now try a few events there.  You will probably lose, but you do a
    consolation prize...A cupie doll!   Now go (fly is quicker) to D3
    7,13? (somewhere there!) and meet this old raving hermit.  He will
    take  the doll and direct you to the pool in the Inner Limits (E2 -
    10,11?).  Bath in this pool (usually it is acid) and you will feel
    like a WINNER!  Go back to the circus grounds and choose a category
    you want to improve on.  For example, if you want improved strength,
    try to ring the bell.  Horseshoes for improved accuracy, Kissing booth
    for better personality, Shell game for better intelligence, Sack race
    for better speed, Head dunk for better endurance, etc.  +10 to the
    category.


  Individual Quests

  For one to be true, each class must fulfil his quest.  Each class must be
  alone or be in the company of thieves.  When the quest is done, return to
  Mt. Farview in area D2 - 07,00 to claim true status (+) and 5 million
  experience.

  Tasks for individual characters are:

  Archers must defeat Baron Wilfrey.  (B2 11,02)
  Barbarians must defeat Brutal Bruno, the barbarian chieftain.  (C4 00,15)
  Clerics must defeat a haunt of ghosts at C1 10,15 in the Lost Soul's
          Woods and collect Corak's Soul.  Then go to Corak's Crypt and
          reunite the soul with his body.  One must have an Admit 8 Pass
          to enter the crypt though, and to obtain one, you have to get it
          from a zombie in the dungeon beneath Sandsobar (or find one as
          treasure after a fight!)
  Knights must defeat the Dread Knight of Jouster's Way.  (B3 05,14)
  Ninjas must assassinate the chaotic Dawn of Dawn's mist bog.  (D4 08,09)
  Paladins must defeat the Frost Dragon who resides in the dungeon beneath
           the Forbidden Forest.  (B3)
  Sorcerers must release both the Good and the Evil wizards from the Isle
            of the Ancients.
            For Evil (dark), follow this set of markeddoors: 1, 3, 1, 7, 9,
            11, A, C, G, I.  The combination to free the evil wizard is
            Right 46 (type 46 when you enter the right alcove) and Left 23
            (type 23 when you enter the left alcove!)
            For Good (Light), follow this path: 2, 2, 4, 6, 6, 12, A, D,
            F, I.  The combination to free the good wizard is Right 32 and
            Left 64.

  Robbers must accompany some/all characters on their relevant quests.


  Triple Crowns

  Buy a key of the appropriate colour.  Buy several arena tickets and then
  fight in the 3 different arenas (Middlegate's ARENA, Sandsobar's Monster
  Bowl, and Atlantium's Colliseum).  Once you have won all 3 fights, you
  are a triple crown winner of that colour.  Go to the bishop of the
  appropriate colour to claim the experience earned.  There are 4 colours
  and 4 types of tickets.

        Green Key -   Key Shoppe in Middlegate
        Green Ticket - Supplies Store in Middlegate
        Green Bishop - Castle Woodhaven

        Yellow Key - Key Shoppe in Sandsobar
        Yellow Ticket - Supplies Store in Sandsobar
        Yellow Bishop - Castle Hillstone

        Red Key - Key Shoppe in Vulcania
        Red Ticket - Supplies Store in Vulcania
        Red Bishop - Castle Pinehurst

        Black Key - Key Shoppe in Atlantium
        Black Ticket - Supplies Store in Atlantium
        Black Bishop - Luxus Castle

  You have to be both True and a Black Triple Crown winner to qualify for
  the quest for Princess Lamanda (goal of the game).


  To finish the game

  Get the four weapons (Tolidor, Fluxer, etc.)
  Get the Element Orb.  (Dawns mist bog cavern - 10,15)
    You can't leave with Orb in hand!  There should be a teleporter in
    the dungeon (very near the entrance), use that instead and you should
    end up in Murray's Cave in Murray's Resort Isle.  Another way is to
    transfer the Orb to the hireling and then Dismissing my hireling.  Now
    I can leave the cave with no problem and I can find the hireling with
    the Orb same and sound back at the original inn.
  Get the four elemental talons.
  Use Lord Peabody's time machine to get to the 9th Century (Era 8), and
    go to Castle Xabran at C2 - 14,08.
  Get the four discs
    Using the time machine in Castle Pinehurst, or through the vortex holes
    at the corners of each elemental planes, travel back to the years 100,
    200, 300, 400 to find the talons.  The locations of the talons are
    given above.  Each shrine which holds a talon requires the appropriate
    disc to open.
  Now you should have all 4 talons and the orb.  Go back to the 9th Century
  again and find King Kalohn at C4 - 14,5 and see him fighting the Mega
  Dragon.  When he sees you with the talons and Orb, you will haved changed
  history because history had said the battle would have been lost.  Now
  that the dragon has been vanquished, King Kalohn will live after all.

  You return to the 10th Century and you go back to Luxus Palace.  Instead
  of Princess Lamanda, you now see King Kalohn!  He tells you of the final
  quest.  To go to Square Lake and try to stop the villain that is going to
  doom Cron.

  You enter this fantastic maze.  At the end of this simple maze, you meet
  him.  SHELTEM and his elemental friends...You should be able to defeat
  him, but alas, can you beat his recorded message?  He has left a pre-
  recorded message and REAL-TIME cryptogram puzzle.  If time expires, the
  world crashes into the Sun.  Now, the encription algorithm changes EVERY
  time so I can't help you with that.  But the message is the same every
  time:

  We, the people of Terra, in order to form a more perfect union, establish
  justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense.

  The answer of this is given already, Preamble.  Now, find the corre-
  sponding encryption and translate the word Preamble to its encrypted code
  and then you are done!  Cron is saved from crashing into the Sun.



  MILLENIUM 2.2

  The first thing to do is to activate the Mk.I Solagen which is already
  in stock in the energy module.  Once this is up and running, it's simply
  a question of initiating the Resource Complex to get enough material to
  build a Mk.II.  Once the Mk.II has been researched, you'll find that
  there isn't enough energy to build the thing.  Turn off the Resource
  Complex, build the Mk.II and then turn it back on again.  After that,
  it's simply a matter of researching and building increasingly powerful
  Solagens up to the Mk.X.  Don't worry about the failed Mk.III.  Simply
  use the Mk.II which should be in store and repeat the process.

  Once the base is operating properly, you have a number of options.  But
  before many of the items can be built, extra minerals are needed.  To
  get these quickly, and simply, research and build a small fleet of
  Grazers.  These can continually ferry small amounts of much-needed ores
  from the asteroid field.

  The central part of the game focuses on the growth and expansion of the
  moon and it's colonies. This is a matter of finding which moons or
  planets provide the best sources of raw materials, setting up colonies
  and shuttling to and from these.  The colonies provide minerals and
  ores, while the moonbase sends replacement Solagens, Fighters and
  Orbital Lasers.  The latter equipment - as if you hadn't already dis-
  covered - is employed in the continual fending off of Martian attacks.
  Orbital Lasers are very effective, but can only be used once: obviously
  it's best to keep a reasonable store in each colony and the Moonbase
  (later on in the game you'll need a full complement of lasers on the
  moon so keep building !)

  To find more info about the Solar system, continually build and launch
  probes.  However, don't bother sending them to the inner planets, Mars
  and it's moons, Jupiter and it's moons, or the asteroid belt, since they
  either get destroyed or yeild no/useless info.

  The key to completing the game is Triton: probe, research and colonise
  as soon as possible, for reasons which will become clear later.  When
  reports of Martian flu come in, research and produce the required
  vaccine.  Don't just ferry it to the infected base though, but produce
  enough for all colonies and the Moonbase since the strain is virulent
  and soon spreads throughout the inhabited worlds.

  At some point you will be informed of the crashed Martian Fleet Carrier,
  and the details beamed back to the Moonbase.  Research this immediately:
  it's important that one be built.  However, you'll find it takes rather
  a lot of materials!

  Once the fleet carrier is built, fill it full of fighters and head for
  Mars.  While in orbit the carrier is attacked by a fleet of Martians,
  at which point all the fighters should be launched (lower right icon on
  left hand side).  A ferocious, if slightly tedious battle ensues but the
  Martians should eventually surrender.
  After this, Mars can be colonised in the usual way.  The colonists then
  find plans of a Martian transforming machine, capable of making the
  Earth's air breathable.  Again, this should be researched and built ASAP.
  However, you'll find that the stock of chromium is pretty much nil.
  This is where Triton comes in: you should, by now, have enough chromium
  collected for shuttling back to the moon.

  Once the Terraformer is built, you'll find that even the Fleet Carrier
  isn't large enough to carry it to Earth.  Don't despair: the researchers
  redesign the ship so that the Terraformer just fits in.  The newly
  customised juggernaut can now take it to the Earth, although it cannot
  take off again.

  While the Earth is being transformed, previous reports of a huge Martian
  fleet prove to be true, when the Moonbase is attacked by over 200
  fighters!
  At this point the stockpile of Orbital Lasers - up to 16 - should be
  used, prior to launching your fighters.  Even after all this, it stands
  a very good chance that the attack cannot be repelled completely, and
  the Moonbase still gets duffed up a treat.  In this case you'll find that
  the Moonbase's population has been reduced to zero.  Don't panic: send
  a couple of Carracks to the moon to dismantle them.  The population
  increases by 80 for every Carrack destroyed.

  Having survived the Martian final assualt, it should now be just a
  question of time before Earth is colonisable.  In the mean time, all your
  colonies start declaring independance. As long as you have a good stock
  of materials, don't worry about it.  When a report comes in stating that
  Earth is once more habitable, build the necessary SIOS, and send it to
  Earth, and then throw your joystick around the room, and out through the
  window, as you are greeted with the naff ending sequence!

  NEBULUS (*)

  NECRIS DOME

  Type in "SPRAY SUIT" to use the Thermo-plas suit.



  NEUROMANCER

  When you first begin, sell all your body parts. You can get along just
  fine without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a half way
  decent deck.  You will eventually need to buy them back before you start
  entering cyber-space, or you will be killed easily.



  NEVER MIND

  At the main screen type "328GTS".  A message, "cheat now on steve", will

  NINJA WARRIORS

  While playing, type in the following cheats, but make sure that you have
  <Caps Lock> on while typing them and that you take it off afterwards:

  "THE TERMINATOR" - body parts explode when you die
  "MONTY PYTHON" - enemies walk on backwards
  "SKIPPY" - enemies bounce

  NITRO (*)

  Enter your name as "MAJ" and you will be awarded 5000 fuel points and 50
  coins.



  NORTH AND SOUTH (*)

  An easy way to kill off enemy armies is to, in battle mode, bring your
  infantry to the bottom of the screen, move backwards to get them into
  retreat formation, then move forward to the enemy.  You will see that the
  enemy cannot get quite as far down the screen as you and so they are
  stuck trying to move downwards.  Now you can just advance and shoot them
  all down with minimal losses.  This will only work when playing the
  computer of course.  It may be harder to win if your human opponent has
  read this hint as well!

  (In looking at the other cheats here, I'd say it was <E>.)



  OUTRUN

  While playing, type in "RED BARCHETTA", then pressing <T> will give you
  more time and <G> will advance you a stage.  This cheat may only work
  with the European version.



  OVERLANDER

  A Few Hints:

  * When cruising the highway don't stop shooting.
  * Always choose the highest paid mission.
  * Buy fuel carefully - only enough for that level.
  * After level 1 you MUST buy a leanburner.
  * Try to stay in the middle of the road and travel fast - travelling
    slowly only burns more fuel.
  * Fire bombs are more useful than smart bombs when you learn how to use
    them.
  * Bulletproofing is necessary after level 2.
  * When travelling through the barriers the best speed is 90-120mph.

  POWERDRIFT

  Well, I dunno about this one, but here we go...

  Select any course except D and win all the races (you must win them to
  get a gold medal - finishing in the top 3 is NOT good enough!).  Collect
  all the gold medals and you enter a bonus round on a secret course with
  you in control of the F-14 Tomcat from Afterburner!  Do the same thing
  on course D and collect all the gold medals and this time you will be in
  control of the Super Hang-On bike!



  POWERDROME

  Here are some tips on the various tracks:

  Oval: The secret with this track is to use as much afterburner as
        possible, but without blowing up your engines.  Keep your eye on
        the temperature gauge.  This track is fairly wide, so switch the
        centering field OFF and pick up speed.  Go around as fast as you
        can.

  Antacorp: A difficult track.  Turn the centering field up to four or
            five, which will put you in the middle of the course.  When
            you go through the underground chicane, hold down the right
            shift key.  This will take you through the vertical scanner
            without slowing down; then straighten.

  Clortek: Shortly after the start line, you will encounter a trench.
           Don't waste your time flying through it; just go over it.
           When you reach the pressure gate, which is around half way,
           don't slow down.  If you're going to crash into it then slow
           down.  Hopefully this won't occur, but in this instance it's no
           use fighting the consequences.  When you come out of the
           exit, switch the afterbunrers on.  Go for speed on this next
           stretch.

  Otyaka: It's main section's underground, very dark and at first quite
          difficult.  The track careers from left to right so turn the
          centering on at around level five.  Once you emerge into the
          open, you'll come across a nasty right hand hairpin, so hold
          down the centering key again.  This section takes some practice.

  Banzal: So named because it really is the hardest track.  Crank the
          centering up as much as possible but reduce it down to six if
          feasible and necessary.  You'll encounter the same kind of
          underground dip as on the Otyaka course, so use the same tactics.
          If you get through this you are GOOD.

  Apocalypt: This section has an alarmingly tight hairpin situated three
             corners from the start.  Take it using centring mode.  While
             underground you will go through a loop de loop.  You get
             through this using gentle movements of the mouse, with centr-
             ing set around six.  This should see you right.

  Estoria: Back into sunny climes and a fairly wide track.  Bomb around
           the course with a low centring setting or none at all.

  General: As you've probably noticed, the centring field is a pretty
           useful gizmo in this game.  Specifically introduced to the Amiga
           version, the centring field should make Powerdrome accessible
           to beginners.

  In winter, take a lone captain to the north of the map.  Leave him there,
  but keep an eye on him, because apparently he starts shearing a sheep.
  And then, apparently, he eats it.

  PREHISTORIK

  After killing the strange turtle-like creature on the first level, you
  should come to a screen with two carnivorous fish bouncing up and down
  in the water, as well as four banks.  Do not jump over the first well!
  Jump inside it and you will fall down into a secret room.
  Later on in the first level, look out for a ladder near some water which
  leads up to a platform and an egg.  Climb the ladder, take the egg, then
  go to the left, into the water, and you will find a submarine secret
  room.

  QUESTRON 2 (*)

  Here are some general hints for the game:

  - While playing Wizards Squares, I find that the ball usually lands
    on Red or Blue.

  - If you have low hit points, watch out for Slasher Boars.   Also,
    steer clear of swamps and mountains, as they contain the toughest
    of monsters (Hurlers, Ice Urchins, Spikers,etc.).   Grub Snufflers
    are the best monster to meet because they have a much greater pro-
    fit ratio. (hit points against gold carried)

  - The game is finished in the realm of sorcerers, in the Dungeon of
    Despair.   You must have about 10,000 hit points and many spells
    to finish it.   An absolute neccessity is the "Scroll of Scalna",
    which can be found in the other dungeon in the realm.   The Scroll
    is a magical map, and it automatically maps your path.

  - Watch out in the dungeons, and constantly check ahead of you with
    the "Xamine" command at the bottom of the list of commands, as bear
    traps or spikes whip up and destroy your amour, or do up to 4000
    hit points damage.

  - Some weapons are better than others for killing certain monsters.
    Here is a table indicating what weapon is best against some of the
    different monsters.

                        Tanglers  -  Dagger
                        Wave Slappers  -  Rapier
                        Spincers  -  Rapier
                        Mutant Carps  -  Cudgel
                        Slasher Boars  -  Spear
                        Ramdarts  -  Bow and Arrow
                        Giant Cockroach  -  Fauchard
                        Spiker  -  Staff

  - Make sure that you have plenty of food before descending into any
    dungeons or tombs, as you may get lost and run out of food.   This
    will cause you to starve to death

  - Some magic items can help you in your quest - If you Use the wand
    of power, you gain 200 hit points, and if you Use the moonstone
    amulet, you gain 100 food.

  Here is a part solution.  If I ever get round to it, I may even update
  to the full solution someday!

  After you have finished the bath level, drop down to the bottom of the
  castle.  Walk left until you get to the small snowman statues.  Jump
  on these and they'll turn into a moving platform.  Once you get into
  the top of the screen, walk left into thin air.  Now jump and you should
  be next to some doors.  Go through them for heaps o' bonuses.  This will
  also work after the sweets level, but go to the left of the castle.

  On the second teddy bear level, keep jumping over the spikes until you
  see a hole above you.  Jump up through this and catapult yourself off
  the bus there.  Now get on the higher level and keep walking left,
  bounce on the trampoline and collect the wings.  Now fly along the
  screen to the right and you should find a different exit.  Go through
  this for a special bonus level.

  At the start of the castle, go right until the screen stops scrolling.
  Now jump up onto the nearby roof and walk left until you are transported
  to the extra levels.

  ROCKET RANGER (Complete Solution)

  * Starting the Game

  When you have loaded the game and you are greeted with the option menu,
  go straight to the War Room.  Now move two of your agents to South
  America, and place the other three agents in Africa.  Forget about flashy
  Joe on Germany, move them straight to these areas, then exit.
  Now takeoff.  Forget the fuel depot.  Enter 23 into your tank to get you
  to the Atlantic.

  * The Zeppelin

  On the first screen, the Zeppelin will move from left to right across
  the screen.  You can not hit it with your gun, but you can destroy the
  torpedoes that are fired at you.  Once ten torpedoess have been fired,
  regardless of whether you have hit them all or not, you go automatically
  onto the next screen.

  On the second screen, the zeppelin is much closer.  Here you have to aim
  at the gondola just below the main airsack.  Torpedoes are also fired at
  you.  Try to dodge them; do not bother about destroying them unless they
  get in the way.  The main objective here is to shoot the gondola.  If you
  successfully hit it, a green flash will appear.  Do not fire anymore, and
  you will go onto the next screen.  If you accidently shoot the airsack
  on the zepp, then it blows up and you have failed this bit.  But do not
  worry, as you have not lost the game.  See the `Barnstoff's Captured'
  section in this solution for more details.

  On the third screen, you will now be in the zeppelin gondola, where Jane
  and the Prof are.  After she says something to you, on the FIRST time you
  successfully rescue them, you reply like this:

  "Loosen up Dollface"
  "I like your style"
  "I oughtta teach you"
  "I took the scenic route"
  "Can you use some help?"

  Once this has been entered, you automatically fly back to Fort Dix, with
  Jane and the Prof.  Later in the game, the Nazi's capture Jane and the
  Prof again from the USA, in which you have to attack the Zeppelin again,
  it happens three times in all.  The second time you successfully get into
  the Gondola your relies are:

  "I'm glad to see you too"
  "I just want to help you"
  "Can you use some help?"

  The third time, your replies are :-

  "I'd be happy to leave"
  "I just want to help you"
  "Can you use some help?"

  These replies ALWAYS work successfully if you enter them in the correct
  order, unlike some suggestions that I have seen in magazines concerning
  this game !!

  * The War Room

  You should return here after you have returned from the first zeppelin
  raid.  Your agents should be flashing so read the reports.  Your first
  objective is to find the Nazi Bases.  The next objective is to find the
  5 Rocket parts, organise resistance in the west, and knock Nazi effeciency
  down a bit.

  The Temple base is nearly always in SOUTH AMERICA, whereas the DESERT
  BASE is nearly always in AFRICA.  Try these places for both bases:

   South America: Venezuela, Columbia, etc

   Africa: Middle-East, Kenya, East Africa, Egypt, etc.


  Once a base is found, organise resistance and fly to it straight away.
  When you go for a fly, try to visit more than one country if possible.
  ie, attack a Rocket Factory, then go to a base.  Once resistance is
  organized, Lunarium comes flooding in.

  It is also useful having a bash at a Zeppelin Factory, or a fighter
  base, or a brain washing plant just to slow the Zeppelins down.
  Once the two bases are found etc, you must locate the 5 parts of the
  Rocket.  It is also usefull to try and get Canada, and all of South
  America turned brown, which means resistance organized, as it gives you
  extra time for locating rocket parts, as the zeppelins take longer to
  occupy a country with resistance organized in it.

  Try to keep two agents in the left side of the world, leaving three
  agents to investigate the right part.  If you have less than three agents
  left, and you are still locating the two bases, FORGET IT - start again!
  Once you have all 5 parts, and enough Lunarium, you can construct your
  rocket and fly to the moon.

  * Barnstoff's Captured

  If you blow up the zeppelin (silly bod!) then they are first taken to
  Germany in a sub, when you get back to Fort Dix, you get a message saying
  that they are going to get exterminated, and it suggests you fly to
  Germany.  Well I strongly advise you not too.  I have completed the game
  by ignoring this message, it is up to you, but I advise you don't.  If
  you forget about it, you later get another message saying they have been
  taken to the desert base (one of the Lunarium ones you are trying to
  find!).  If you ignore it again, they just get sent to the moon unharmed.

  If you want to fly to Germany, when you get the message about Jane and the
  Prof, then you get the Shoot Planes screen.
  If you kill them (easy as there are only eight!) you land in Germany,
  where you get immiediately captured, you then get interrogated, and you
  answer as the zeppelin screen.  I never got this right.  I once told him
  that "Hitler eats Babies" in which I escaped to another country, but I
  did not free Jane and the Prof.

  If you are unsuccessful, then when you get the next message about them
  being taken to the Desert Base, fly to it (that is if you have found it!)
  and you get captured again, with the same screen as Germany!  Which is
  why I ignored it as I could never get the answers right!  As I mentioned
  before, it is not necessary to go through this bit.

  If you fly to Germany when Jane and the Prof are not there, and success-
  fully shoot the planes down, then when you land you get a message saying
  well done, and Nazi efficiency has gone down by 5%.

  * Nazi Efficiency

  This is where you can knock down the percentage in the top right hand
  screen, to slow the Zeppelin down.  You do this by your agents reporting
  about a brainwashing plant, or looting of art treasure, zeppelin factory.
  If you fly to the country, then all it is, is the plane shoot, and once
  this is done you get a suitable message saying efficiency down by 10%.
  It is only worth doing this in the early stages of the game, as the plane
  shoot gets much harder later on.

  * ME 109's

  On this screen you are soaring above the clouds, ME 109's attack in
  formations, the best way I have found is to stay at the bottom and pick
  them off.  This screen, in my opinion, is the hardest screen of the game,
  except for perhaps the moon shoot out.  Once you have been hit three
  times, then kaput.  You'd better have enough Lunarium to get home!

  * Takeoff

  Make sure you have loaded up with enough Lunarium - a heavy load is harder
  to take off of course, but if you press the button, in time to his legs
  being directly underneath his body, you should manage it.  Watch out for
  the lame seagull, and also watch out for the UFO which appears from time
  to time on the screen where you soar up through the sky.

  * The Ack-Ack Screen

  This is the attack on the Desert Base.  It is at night, and ack-ack
  batteries come at you from the top of the screen.  If you fire your gun a
  bit before the batteries, you will destroy them.  Once you have hit ten
  you have done it!  You can only take three hits from Flak!  Very easy.

  * The Temple Shootout

  This is also very, very easy.  This places you in front of a temple,
  where you have to knock out machine guns positioned at the windows.  Pull
  down on the joystick and the bullets miss you, you have three seconds
  before the machine gun opens up, so rush to the window and fire slightly
  above it, and KABOOM!  If you get hit three times then you have failed.
  Once you destroy all guns, the door opens and you have done it!

  * The Punch Up

  When you fly to a rocket factory, upon landing you have to bash the pulp
  out of a guard.  There are four moves and two ducks, the ducks are use-
  less.  The first three guards are dead easy, the last two can be sorted
  out if you keep the joystick pressed up, and press the firebutton when
  his face is uncovered, knock his bar down, and BLAM, you did it!

  * The Moonbase

  Once you have the final rocket part and 500 units of Lunarium, assemble
  your rocket, load the Lunarium and blast off!
  You will then find yourself in the Mine.  You have to shoot the women
  zombie slaves from the platforms in similiar fashion to the Temple shoot
  out.  To hit them stay down until the girls cease firing, then move over
  and shoot them.  Be quick as they will escape on ropes and return.
  Repeat the process carefully, for those on the right.  Don't forget that
  your vision becomes impaired due to the effects of the Lunarium, so
  hurry.  If you have succeeded, the world is saved!  If you are to slow,
  then Nazi's are in the Whitehouse!

  SHADOW DANCER

  While playing, pause the game and type in "GIVE ME INFINITES".  Press
  <Return>.  This should give you infinite lives and, you will now be
  able to press <X> to skip a level.



  SHADOWGATE

  Try talking to the rope - it is magical.  The word on the wall will help
  you here.  To get the Cyclops, use the sling with a stone.  The stones
  are near the waterfall.  To get the flute you need the steel glove.
  Operate the well and examine the bucket.  When you get the flute, play
  it.  What you get from doing this fits into the hole in the King's room.
  With the wand, go back to the bridge, remove all excess equipment and
  cross it.  Try out the wand on the snake.  To get the horn, pour holy
  water on the Hell Hound.



  SHADOW OF THE BEAST

  Wait until the main title screen (the one with the beast reaching out at
  the word `Beast') and hold down the left mouse button and the joystick
  button until you are told to change discs.   This gives you infinite
  lives.  If this doesn't work, try it holding down the joystick button and
  both mouse buttons.



  SHADOW OF THE BEAST 2 (*) (Complete Solution)

  Note: While the cheat is verified, the solution has not yet been fully
  tested.

  When you start the game, run right until you come to the man with the
  spear, press `A' to ask a question, type in "TEN PINTS" and press
  <Return>.  You should now have infinite energy.

  When asked to whisper the password, try whispering either "SUNSTONE",
  "OBERON", "NECROPOLIS", or "ETERNITY".

  Here also is a full solution:

  First you should go left.  Through the trees tossing their balls about
  at you, and across the bridge.  You will now arrive at a tree stump with
  a guard (Don't kill him!).  Here you'll need to be as fast as possible
  to jump up about four times and kill the oversized mosquito that is
  going to carry the guard away.  When he's dead then stand still and
  listen to what the guard says.  Now ask him about "traps" and he will
  say either "Upper" or "Lower".  Now descend the stepped branches to the
  left and jump into the side tunnel on the left.  Walk along until a
  cousin of the mosquito that you killed above will fly past.  Turn around
  fast and go to the right where the mosquito is cutting through the rope.
  KILL him quickly or else you're stuffed.  Once he's dead just stand on
  edge of the ledge and wait for a strong dude to push a stone towards
  you.  When he reaches the very edge where you're standing, hit him once
  and he'll kick the bucket.

  Now go to the left and up the rise where the hovering mosquito is
  waiting for you to kill it.  So oblige it then go back to the right
  where a key has fallen when you swatted the bug.  Take the key the go
  back to the left.  Drop off the edge, walk across the see-saw then jump
  up onto the rope that's hangin' around waiting to be climbed.  Climb it
  and jump off onto the ledge at the top.

  Use that key you found open the way for you.  Continue to the right until
  you come to a wall with two switches.  Now remember what the guard told
  you?  Was it upper or lower?  Hit the switch (with your mace) that the
  guard told you. (ONLY that switch!)  If you killed the guard by mistake,
  the try the upper switch.  If you hit the wrong switch the ground
  disappears and you get you're feet wet.  If you got it right then stand
  still and the cage above you will be lowered.  Stand on it and wait.  It
  will then rise up.

  Step off at the top and go the right, across the pit with the guard and
  the puppy dog.  Continue until the end where you will find a key.  Climb
  a chain from the ceiling to get to a high ledge where you'll find some
  goodies.  Then return back to the pit with the guard and his pet puppy
  dog.  Carefully climb down the chain and when you're near the bottom jump
  to the left otherwise you'll wake the guard which will mean restart the
  game.  Use the key you found above and release Fido.  He'll then scare
  the chicken soup out of the sleeping guard who then goes off to look for
  a better life and a large bottle of scotch.  Hit the bottom lever at the
  right off the pit, then climb back out and return to the cage at the left
  and descend.

  Continue to the left and go back down the rope you climbed.  Go to the
  left until you reach a wall with 3 switches.  These switches operate the
  crane that is above you.  The lower switch moves the crane up or down,
  the middle one moves it left or right and the upper one opens and closes
  the claw.  Now use the crane to pick up the huge boulder where you're
  standing carry it across to the right hand spike and drop it.  It will
  then break up.  Be careful when using the switches or else you'll break
  the boulder and you're knackered.

  Now push the rock piece left over to the see-saw.  Now climb the rope
  and after some practise manage to properly jump off to the other side of
  the see-saw where the rock is launched into the air and lands in the
  suspended cage.  Quickly run to the left and stand on the other cage. The
  rock's weight will then lower it's cage thus raising your cage up to a
  ledge.  Go to the left, chat to the dragon if you like, then whip him
  into a fudge brownie.  Next hit the bag hanging from the branch and the
  original guard's brother will then drop down. Ask him about "ishran" and
  he will then give you a password for you to remember.

  Now return right, down, right, upabit, rightdownabit, right and  you
  should be at the edge of the ledge with the rope at your right.
  Climb down the rope and continue to the left until you confront a big
  lumberjack with a skin complaint.  Hit him until he falls back into the
  acid pool.  Continue until you reach the tavern.  Enter go to the left
  and take the bottle of booze you find.  You can talk to the barman on
  the right but he's rather boring.  Leave the tavern, go right and down
  the stepped branches with the leaping greenies.  Go to the wall with
  the ghostly apparition of somebody's granny behind it.  Speak the
  password that you were told (you did remember it, didn't you ???).

  Then continue on until you reach a big dude who gives you a parchment
  of a prehistoric playboy centrefold to help you while away the time
  on those cold lonely nights.  Now return all the way back to where back
  to where you originally started.  Continue to the right, through the
  forest full of uglies with oversized toothpicks, until you reach an
  area where there are jumping green booger balls.  Make you're way up
  until you confront Simon the Snot-Nose Monster.  Kill him and collect
  the axe that he drops. Look around and you'll find a couple of chests,
  one's to you're left and the other's above to the right.  After you've
  raided the chests then go back down to the ground.

  Go to the rock platform that defies gravity on the left.  Under it you'll
  find a patch of grass that looks slightly different to the rest of the
  ground.  Jump on it a few times until it collapses.  Go down the stairs
  and across to the left.  Run to the left until you wake a guard who
  starts to run off.  Keep running until you reach a wall with a sliding
  floor in front of it.  Stand up against the wall and use the axe you
  found to kill the guard who's winding the floor in before you fall and
  have to restart.

  Once he's dead you can then kill the other guard and break through the
  wall using your mace.  You'll find a chain so go ahead and climb it.
  You'll find a switch so activate it then run as fast as your little
  Reeboks will carry you to the left where you have to activate another
  switch then run back to the right before the timer runs out.  If it
  runs out and you didn't activate the cheat then you'll be a skewered
  corpse.  Go down until you find four cards sitting around playing poker.
  Kill the two on the right and collect the key.  Go left until you are
  caught in a cage.  Don't worry it's harmless.  Wait for the guards to
  take you to a cell.  Once in the cell offer the bottle of booze you got
  from the tavern to the guard sitting outside the cell.  He'll then take
  it and drink himself to sleep so you are then able to bash down the
  door of the cell.

  Jump onto the chain and climb up to kill the guard on the left.  Go back
  down and kill the sleeping guard, take the key and go back up to release
  the prisoner with it.  Now climb up to the top of the chain where you'll
  kill any guard you find and take a rather large ring. Go to the right
  where the prisoners are waiting at a door.  Open it with the other key
  and run along with the prisoners, who should get impaled by the Heavy
  Duty Deluxe Model Stainless Steel Low Calorie Toothpicks.  Then return
  to the entrance up at the ground level.

  You'll need to find your way to the right where there is a bridge. If
  you go right from the entrance and go down the rope and into the water
  there will be a rope that you can climb up to get to the bridge.  On the
  right side of the bridge you'll find a large postman with an equally
  large letter opener.  Get him to follow you back to the bridge.  To do
  this go up close to him then run away quickly.  Once he's on the bridge
  he'll fall through.  Go to the right and avoid the hole in the bridge.
  You'll find a guy who you'll give the parchment and ring to, and he'll
  then give you a rather useful new weapon.

  Go back to the bridge and fall down into the river where you'll get
  sucked in by the whirlpool.  Make your way across and down collecting
  energy (wow) and the Horn.  Go across until you find and angry snail
  sitting on the world's largest magic mushroom.  Ask him about "karamoon"
  and he'll then offer to take you for a ride for 36 gold (which you
  should have collected by now if not, restart etc...) so you accept of
  course.  He'll take you to Karamoon where you go to the right until you
  are at the edge of a great sea.  Blow your horn and your limousine will
  arrive to take you to Zelek's castle where you enter and seek out Zelek
  to take your revenge.

  That's it you've now finished the game and you can live happily ever
  after until Shadow of the Beast III.



  SHADOW WARRIORS

  You may need someone's help with this one.  When the intro sequence is
  running, hold down the following keys: <Control>, <J>, <Esc>, <5>, <F2>,
  Right <Alt>, <(>, <V>, <Enter>, and <Help>.  Note: the <Enter> and <(>
  keys refer to keys on the numeric keypad.  Then, while playing, pressing
  <Help> advances you a level, and <Q> turns off the collision detection,
  making you invincible.



  SHADOWS OF MORDOR

  SHINOBI

  SHOCKWAVE

  Here are some tips on the game:

  Mines......Each time a mine is purchased, the income you receive for each
             `time pass' doubles.
  Factories..The more factories you have, the faster more weapons are pro-
             duced.
  Rigs.......Rigs supply you with the fuel for each mission run.  The more
             rigs you have the greater the amount of fuel you get for each
             `time pass'.
  Armys......For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down slightly.

  If more than 50% of the sector is occupied by the enemy then you will
  lose one of your assets for each `time pass' that occurs.   The best
  solution is to, when 30% is occupied, attack the enemy.



  SILKWORM (*)

  Get to the controls set-up page by pressing F10 from attract mode, hold

  Pressing <1> to <-> lets you jump levels.



  SIM CITY (*)

  While playing, hold down <Shift> and type in "FUND" for an extra $10,000.
  However, after using this cheat a few times you will probably get an
  earthquake, so it is best not to build much until you have done this.



  SINBAD AND THE THRONE OF THE FALCON

  You'll be as good as new and back at the map.



  SKIDZ

  infinite lives.   Holding down the Fire button along with <Alt> and <L>

  cheats or you will not be able to get past level 2.



  SKULL AND CROSSBONES (*)

  Keep your sword power high by picking up the small coins.
  DO NOT look at Medusa.
  The lunge and the back slash are the most effective moves.



  SLAYER

  Go to the end of the first stage, making sure that your on your last
  life.  Blow up all the enemy guns and the little green monster.  Next,
  crash into the machine it resided in.  You will then start on level 2

  SPACE QUEST 3 (Complete Solution)

  Escaping from Planet 1

  Get the wire in the tunnel and go to the conveyor belt.  Climb on to
  the conveyor and jump. Travel left until you reach the u-turn and climb
  down into the mobile-chair.  Go around the U-turn and two-thirds of the
  way into the next screen.  Collect the motivator.  Travel right and stop
  just until you reach a chute.  Examine the wall and then the hole.  Take
  the reactor. Climb the ladder and take it.

  Make your way to the robot's head and, after you've been mugged by the
  rat, go back down the chute and retrieve the wire and reactor from
  where the reactor was first found.

  Use the ladder, climb it and get it again.  Go back to the robot's head
  and get as near to the broken eye as possible.  Climb.  Use the ladder
  on the side of the ship and climb again.  Open the hatch.  Use the
  reactor and the wire.  Sit in the pilot's seat and examine the screen.
  Switch the radar and the engines on and Whoosh! Having stopped, press
  <8> to instigate weapons. Turn on the shields and fire.

  Pleebhut

  Travel to Pleebhut at light speed and once arrived, go to the "World of
  Wonders".  Show that you have the gem.  Say "no" twice and then "yes" at
  425 Buckazoids.  Now for a shopping spree.

  What to buy:
  - Orat on a stick
  - Heat-proof underwear
  - Astro-chicken flight-hat

  Return to your ship.  Enter the screen via the X on the map. Travel left
  and once you see the "Terminator" footprints, walk around the killer-
  pods, leaving the nasty to walk under them and perish!  Do not attempt
  to Pick up the Invisibility Belt!  Stand to the left of the belt and use
  Orat.  Return to your ship.

  Time for a Snack

  Travel to "Monolith Burgers".  Walk to the arcade and insert Buckazoid.
  Play the arcade game until your score stops increasing (298/738).  Order
  a fun-meal from the counter.  Sit down to eat your meal and you should
  find a decoder-ring.  Enter the tunnel and climb-down.

  Off to the Hot One!

  Once entered the ship, wear the underwear.  Fly to Ortega and when you
  arrive, go to the other ship.  Travel to the scientists and wait behind
  the rock until they leave.  Take the detonator and the pole.  Go to the
  screen on the right, then walk two screens up.  Walk down to the edge
  of the hole.  Drop the detonator and climb down.  Return to the ship and
  at the point where the unstable rock have disappeared, use the pole.
  Enter the ship.

  Let's go to Scumsoft!

  When you've arrived at Scumsoft, any direction will lead to the bushes.
  Wear and use the belt.  Enter Scumsoft and go down the steps.  Press the
  button and walk forward.  Enter the first door on the (left or right?)
  then examine the closet.  Take the coveralls (all objects carried will be
  dropped but don't fret) and leave.  Walk forward and enter the door on
  your right (without the keycard monitor).

  SAVE the game at this point.

  Work your way to the top of the screen.  You should come across a picture
  with the nearby photocopier and replace the original.  Once in the bosses
  office, empty the bin with the vaporiser.  Exit the screen to the right
  and then return, by which time the boss should have left the office.
  Take the keycard and go back to the corridor.  Find the correct door and
  use the keycard.
  Use photocopy and press the button.  Stand right next to one of the men
  and use the vaporiser.

  SAVE the game.

  You should suddenly find yourself in a giant robot about to fight the
  big bossman.  Continue walking forward and punching repeatedly until the
  boss topples... You now find yourself back at the ship.

  SAVE the game yet again to prevent any personal bloodshed!

  Press '8' to use your weapons. Repeatedly alternate the shield between
  front and back (when the shield is not needed, you MUST turn it off) and
  when you have destroyed five ships...PRESTO!

  The end!  Return to the cockpit view to watch the end of game sequence.



  SPACE QUEST 4 (Complete Solution)

  For the first section of the game, look in pages 8 and 9 of your Space
  Piston book and follow the walk-through provided.  When you have followed
  the walk-through successfully you will find yourself in the sewers.  From
  here:


  Sewer Room:

  Go to the table and get the jar.  Look under the pad on the table and
  press the button that is there.  When the picture show has finished, go
  to the large contraption to the left of you and turn the handle.  The
  door will open, enabling you to go inside.  Do so now.  You are now in
  the sewers underneath Xenon.  Move to the left hand side of the sewers
  and move down.  A little thingie will start to follow you.  Let it follow
  you until the bottom screen, wait until it gets near you and use the jar
  to scoop it up.  Now quickly get out of the way and wait until the slime
  has gone.  Go from here to the ladder and climb up.  Go to the screen to
  the left and here you will find a spaceship.  Climb into the landing gear.


  Main Computer:

  Save the game now, in case you muck the next couple of commands up.  Go
  to the right hand screen and a time pod should appear.  Quickly get into
  it.  When you are inside, enter any combination you like, but note down
  what you entered.  You might like to try different combinations.


  Space Quest 10:

  When you land, get out of the pod and walk around a bit.  Go left - you
  will see something down the path, so go back to the time pod and take the
  path near it.  A large bird comes along and picks you up.  Oh dear!  When
  your in its nest, wait until one of the evil guards drops in, then search
  him and you'll find a piece of paper.  Go to the hole in the nest and click
  on it with the Hand icon to go through it.  In the next screen you will
  meet some nice young ladies.  Get into the sub.  When you get to the
  hideout, wait until a slug turns up.  When the slug tries to eat you,
  press the button that activates the lasers on either side of the chair.
  Now get one of the oxygen tanks and shove it into the slugs mouth.


  Shopping Centre:

  Pick up the card that the girl has dropped, then get on the walkway.
  Go to the Men's clothing shop and talk to the droid there.  When you
  have your new clothes, pay the man.  Next, go to the Mamolith burgers
  and ask the Pig there for a job.  You can do the arcade bit if you want
  to, but it isn't compulsory.

  From here, go back to the place where you came into the shopping centre
  and get the cigar.  Now go to the cash machine, which stands next to
  the software shop.  Use the card you picked up in the machine.  It
  won't work.  Now go to the ladies clothes shop and talk to the droid at
  the desk - she should give you some clothes.  Pay for the clothes and
  go back to the cash machine.  Now you can use the card and get some
  money out.  Go into the software shop and look in the bargain bin to
  get the Space Quest hint book, which should be underneath the other
  software.  Pay for the book and then look at it.  Use the stick icon
  to reveal the answers.

  Go from here to Radio Shock and look at the catalogue.  Look at the
  electrical gadgets and go through them until you come to the adaptor for
  the Pocket pal.  Get the adaptor which is at the bottom right of the
  screen.  Now go back to the ladie's clothes store and into the changing
  rooms.  Get dressed.  When you have finished, go to the arcade.  Go
  over to the Ms Astro Chicken and insert a buckazoid.  Play the game
  as many times as you want.  After a while the game will blow up.  A
  time pod should appear.  When a soldier comes after you, just leave
  the screen and go to the zero gravity skate place.  Go to the top of
  this and wait for the guard to come after you.  From here, dodge the
  guard and go back to the arcade.  Get into the time pod.

  To work out where to go, take the codes that are in the hint book and
  type them out.  Then type in the code that is written on the piece of
  paper you found.


  Space Quest One:

  Go to the bar, where you'll find some nice people.  When you've been
  thrown out, kick over the bikes.  Now go back to the bar, but on the way
  there, jump out of the way of the biker.  In the bar, get the matches
  from the bar table.  Now go back to the Time Pod - but you'll have to
  jump out of the way of the bikers again.  When you're in the time pod,
  go back to the start of the game.


  Start of the Game:

  Go to the far right-hand side screen.  Use the acid on the door lock.
  When you're in the tunnel, use the matches on the cigar.  This should
  show you where the lasers are.  Now go to the Bunny, look at it and
  take the battery out of it.  Put the battery in the computer.  Look
  at the panel on the wall and type in any number you like.  The best
  way to get the lasers in line is to experiment.  I found that using
  100 each time sometimes works.

  When you've managed this, go to the room to the north.  You'll now
  be in the main computer.  Wait till the droid appears from the left,
  then go back to the previous screen.  Go back to the main computer.
  By now, you should have given the droid the slip.  Go from here down
  the left-hand path until you come to another room with a control panel.
  Now use the numbers given in the hint book to open the door.

  Go into the next room.  You should now be given a screen with lots of
  objects on it.  Move all the objects onto the toilet, but not the
  SQ4 one.  Now leave here and goto the main computer.  If you can't find
  your way back, use your computer with the sockets that are around the
  place.

  When you get to the main computer to fight with Vohal, Move your man
  with the cursor keys or joystick.  Move to the middle of the platform
  to fight, and after a while, you should be able to get him into the
  middle of the screen.  When you've done this, go down the ladder.
  When you come back up, a disc will be in your inventory.  Click the
  disc icon on the disc drive.  When the picture of the screen appears,
  click on Upload beam, then Upload disc, then use the arrows to change
  the arrow to Roger Jnr and click on Download beam.

  You have now downloaded Vohal and finished Space Quest IV!



  SPELLBOUND

  Apparently, typing "HEYYOUDIDYOUCALLMYPINTAWOMANNUTS" at some stage does
  somethin' or other.  Another version of this cheat I have seen states
  that these are in fact codes: HEYY, OUDI, DYOU, CALL, MYPI, NTAW, and
  OMAN.



  SPHERICAL

  Type "BLADERUNNER" on the menu screen for a variety of effects.

  Also, here are all the passwords:

  Player One Mode:               Player Two Mode:

  radagast                       ghanima
  yarmak                         gliep
  orcslayer                      mournblade
  skyfire                        jadawin
  mirgal                         gumbachacmal



  SPINDIZZY WORLDS (*)

  There is actually a hidden level designer in Spindizzy.  Load up the
  game as usual and select a cluster of planets to view it close up.
  Now type in "Edit" (capital "E", lowercase "dit") and a disclaimer
  screen will appear.  If you agree to the disclaimer, some brief
  instructions will appear.  Press joystick button to return to the planet
  cluster and button again to play.  There will not be any scenery there -
  you can now create your own.



  SPITTIN' IMAGE

  The game is easiest if fought in this order:

  1) Reagan, Pope
  2) Gorby, Pope
  3) Ayatollah, Pope
  4) Botha, Pope
  5) Margaret, Pope



  SPY VS. SPY

  Wait by the door to the airport and booby trap all doors.  When the other
  spy has got all the stuff, he'll get killed trying to get to the exit -
  just go through the door which he tried to get through.  Pick up the
  stuff by searching the furniture and escape.  If he does get through,
  just beat the heck out of him and head for the exit.



  ST DRAGON

  Hold down Left Mouse Button and Fire Button until game loads for un-
  limited lives.  Alternatively, while playing, press <Caps Lock> and type
  in "DECAFFEINATED" for the same effect.

  I regret that I have been unable to get either of these cheats to work,
  but try them yourself and write in if you discover the way to get it
  right.



  STAR GOOSE

  Hit all the function keys from <F1> through to <F10> and you've got
  infinite protection.



  STARCROSS (Complete Solution)

  The final part of the game invoolves shoving color coded rods into the
  appropriately colored slots.  (Freud would have been proud).  The only
  problem is in finding the rods and slots.

  Beware: If you put a rod into a slot of a different color, it will
          disappear forever!


  *** The Landing

  Get up
  Get library

  Push Red button
  Read screen

  - Get the coordinates for whichever unidentified mass (UM-??) has been
  - chosen at random from the chart below:

  Enter couch
  Say to computer "r is (r), phi is (phi), theta is (theta)"

  - Wait for computer to reply that there is indeed a mass there.  If it
  - doesn't then you got the coordinates wrong!  Try again.  Then type:

  Say to computer "confirmed."

  *** Getting in

  Unfasten belt
  Get up
  Open inner
  Out
  Close  inner
  Open outer
  Out
  Press fourth bump

  - The sculpture is supposed to be the solar system.  You press the fourth
  - bump because it corresponds to your home planet (Earth).  Why is earth
  - the fourth bump and not the third?  Because the sun counts as the first
  - bump!.  At this point you should see a `tiny bump'.

  Press tiny

  - Now you will see a black rod rise up.  This rod is a `self-destruct'
  - device!  Do not put it in any black slot, ever!
  - The airlock door will open when you take the rod

  Take black rod
  In
  Close outer
  Open inner
  In

  - You are now in the `artifact'!


  *** The Artifact

  - Think of it as an intergalactic intelligence test.  Put the right
  - blocks in the right holes and win the prize.  The artifact is cylin-
  - drical in shape, and divided (like a pie) into four wedges, which
  - (like the slots) are color coded.  These colors are: red, blue, green,
  - and yellow.  These wedges are transected by 5 concentric rings.

  - In short, the cylinder is divided into a sort of circular grid system
  - of rings and colors.  (this will be more obvious to you as you move
  - about in the artifact.)  Directions are: N,S,E,W,U, and D.  Up and down
  - correspond to in and out.  East and west correspond to left and right,
  - and also to Port and Starboard.  When you enter the artifact, you will
  - be unable to enter the yellow section without being eaten by the grues
  - (which were apparently captured on the planet zork, but who escaped
  - from the alien zoo for the express purpose of menacing adventurers
  - foolhardy enough to travel without light.)


  *** Collect those rods!

  - You can get these in different orders, but the following order will
  - definitely work: black, red, silver, yellow, pink, blue, gold, brown,
  - violet, green, clear (crystal), white.

  * Getting the Red rod:
  - It's being held captive by `ant-men'! To get there:

  North, West, Forward, East

  - Now, the ant-men will be very nasty if you try to take their rod away.
  - so let's keep them busy doing something else - like rebuilding their
  - nest, throw something at the nest - the tape player will do nicely, and
  - your space suit will also work if you want to bother taking it off.
  - Then get red rod.  Don't forget to reclaim whatever it was you threw!

  Get library (or whatever)

  * Getting the Silver rod:
  - It's on the way to the yellow one, which we really need!  From the
  - nest:

  West, Aft, West, South, South, Port
  Get gun
  Look into gun
  Get silver rod

  * Getting the Yellow rod: it's in the spaceship docked outside the blue
  - airlock.  From the weapons deck:

  East, North
  Open inner
  Out
  Close inner
  Open outer
  Out
  South, South

  - Give the tape library to the spider (the clue here was that he is
  - intensely interested in news).  He'll give you the yellow rod, but
  - that's all he's good for.

  Give tape
  Get yellow rod.

  - The yellow rod is one of the `useful' rods: you'll need to stick it in
  - the yellow slot to get some of the others.  To get to the yellow slot:

  North, North
  In
  Close outer
  Open inner
  In
  Up

  - You are now in the grasslands.  The weasels and unicorns here are
  - strictly local colour, not useful.

  South
  Open hatch
  Down
  Put yellow rod in yellow slot

  - Putting the yellow rod in the yellow slot will turn on the emergency
  - lighting in the yellow section of the `artifact'.  While you're here,
  - put the red rod in the second red slot (this will turn on the life
  - support system and get that tell-tale windex aroma out of the air in
  - a few turns.  Later on this will enable you to trade your old spacesuit
  - For something truly useful (like a brown rod)).

  Get card

  - You'll need to put this into the computer - I suspect it's a disk II
  - controller card - can't boot up without one!

  * Getting the pink rod:
  - it's in the spaceship docked outside the yellow airlock.  Be careful,
  - one false move and it's deep space for you.  To get there:

  Up, North, Down, West
  Open inner
  Out.
  Close inner
  Open outer
  Get basket.

  - This basket can be used to hold the rods `til you need them - that way
  - they won't take up valuable inventory space.

  Open outer (yes, again: it stuck the first time!)
  Out
  Attach line to spacesuit
  Attach line to hook
  Port
  Get pink rod

  * Getting the blue rod:
  - It's in the laboratory, with other useful implements.  To get there:

  East
  Detach line from hook
  In
  Close outer
  Open inner
  In
  South, South
  Put all rods in basket
  East
  Get all disks

  - Now comes the tricky part: the rod is imbedded in the silver sphere.
  - All we have at our disposal to obtain it is the 4-position dial and
  - the two disks.  Fortunately, these are `transporter disks'.
  - Unfortunately, they explode into nothingness if you allow them to
  - touch.  Anyway, here's the procedure:

  Put red disk under globe
  Put blue disk on floor
  Put card on globe
  Turn dial to 4
  Turn dial to 2
  Get card
  Get blue rod
  Get all disks
  Put blue rod in basket
  West
  Put blue disk on floor

  - You have to put it on the floor here so the `maintenance mouse' can
  - collect it and put it in the garage so you can transport there (and
  - out of trouble) later!

  * Getting the gold rod:
  North, North, North, North, West, Aft

  - Now you're in the computer room

  Open  panel
  Put card in slot
  Close panel
  Turn computer on

  - It will spew out a gold rod for you

  Put gold rod in basket

  - Look around if you like, but there's nothing else to do here.  The
  - enunciator panel tells you what you have to fix to put the artifact
  - in order, but I'm going to tell you that anyway...

  * Getting the brown rod:
  North, West, West, South, South, East, East
  Remove suit

  - Look around or `wait' or something until the chieftain comes.

  Offer suit to chief
  Point at brown rod

  * Getting the violet rod:
  - You have no time to put the brown rod in your basket!
  - Follow the chief when he leaves.  It's the only way to get the the
  - violet rod!  Just keep typing "follow chief" until you get to the
  - `center of the warren'.  Then:

  Down
  Close inner
  Open outer
  Out
  Port, Port
  Get visor
  North
  Move skeleton
  Get violet rod

  - move the skeleton only once!

  South, South
  Put red disk on floor.
  Stand on red disk

  - With any luck you'll now be in the garage.  If the mouse hasn't
  - collected the blue disk yet, you'll be back outside the laboratory.
  - You'll just have to wait till he comes and gets it, then transport
  - to the garage.

  * Getting the Green rod:
  Enter bin

  - Keep typing "again" until you find the green rod.
  - It may take up to 10 tries.

  Get green rod
  Put green rod in basket.

  * Getting the Clear rod:

  Forward, Port, North, North, North, North, West
  Look at laser through visor
  Get clear rod

  * Getting the white rod:
  East, South, South, Up, South, South, Port, Up, Up
  Jump
  Put silver rod in silver slot
  In
  Get white rod


  You've got all the rods now.  All you have to do is figure out why
  you've collected them.


  *** Finishing Up

  Put white rod in white slot

  - A black slot will appear.  Do not put the black rod in the black slot!.

  * Getting to the control bubble:
  Out
  Up
  Jump
  Fire gun at drive bubble
  Again
  Again

  - Your location  should now be `on control bubble'

  Down
  Put gold rod in gold slot
  In
  Put clear rod in clear slot

  - Five colored slots will appear
  - Put the appropriate rod in each slot - the order you do it in
  - doesn't matter.

  *** The final sequence:

  - You now use the various colored spots to set the course of the artifact
  - toward earth.

  Touch large square  (The view now covers the area from the sun to Jupiter)
  Touch brown spot  (You will have to touch it four times, until the earth
                     is highlighted)
  Touch violet spot  (Three times, until the path forms a circle around the
                      earth.  Don't stop at the ellipse!)
  Touch green spot  (The path will flash)
  Touch blue spot.  (Blast off!  You win!)

  Now you can sit back and bask in the glory of a perfect score.



  STARFLIGHT (*)

  In the trade depot at the space station buy " 1000" units of Endurium.
  Now sell 990 units back and you get about 2,720,000 mu's.



  STARGLIDER

  Slow down your ship completely, and press <F1> for fixed sights.  Press
  <BackSpace> to Pause the game and type "js arg s".  You should now be
  invincible, and your fuel and shields will never deplete.  Press <P> for
  more missiles.

  To enter the secret object viewer, press <Z>.  Then press <P> to pause.
  Select <[> and <]> and manipulate objects.  You can use all keys but
  <Q> and <Escape>.  Use the Mouse to change point of view, and change
  magnification with Right Mouse Button.



  STARGLIDER 2 (*)

  While playing, press <F> for fixed sights, slow the ship to a halt, press
  the <Backspace> key to pause the game and type "WERE ON A MISSION FROM
  GOD" and press <1> on the main keyboard.   Then, pressing <K> gets all
  the weapons and <F2> brings up some text.

  Here are the nine items you need to build a Neutron Bomb (that is if you
  don't want to cheat by using the above method !)

  Crate of Castrobars
  First get a petrified tree from Enos and take it to the depot on Castron.
  You will automatically get the Castrobars.

  Vistan Wine
  Nip over to Vista.  The wine is scattered all over the surface.

  Flat Diamond
  On Vista have a good look around.  Somewhere you'll find a hole in the
  ground spurting out Flat Diamonds.  Tractor Beam one of `em.

  Cluster of Nodules
  These can be found on the Surface of Dante.

  Asteroid
  Get one of these in the asteroid belt between Millway and Apogee.

  Egron Mini-Rocket
  This can be found on Aldos.  It takes a bit of a search but it is
  definately there!

  Nuclear Fuel
  This can be found lying about on Aldos.

  Rock
  This is lying on Q-Beta.

  Professor Taymar
  He's driving an Emma 2 on Broadway.  Emma's are pretty speedy, so it
  may take a bit of time to trap him in your tractor beam.  Don't carry
  Castrobars when you try to catch him!

  Here is how to complete the game once you have a Neutron Bomb:

  Fly to one of the moons of Millway.  Drop a bouncing bomb on a station
  there and head into a tunnel.  Pick up four missiles and fly to Q-Beta.
  Just next to Q-Beta is a hologram.  Fly into this and you will find a
  Space Station and 8 mini sentinels.  Blow away four of them & fly back
  to Apogee to refuel.  Fly to another moon of Millway and get four more
  missiles, drop a bouncing bomb on a station.  Pull down so you are facing
  the Space station and bombs away.  It should hit and you'll have finished
  the game !



  STARQUAKE

  Here's a complete list of teleport codes:

  FLIED   CHING    DAVARO    SOLUN    TABET    LUANG    TSOIN    KALED
  ROKEA   HINDI    SOCHI     NICHI    BORNO    CWORE    KWANG    ADKEA



  STARRAY

  This cheat only works with the full price game, not the budget release.
  On the options screen, type "AL YANKOVIC", and press <F5> for effect.
  Also, pressing <X>, <C>, <T> and <Space Bar> produces a cheat screen.



  STORMBALL

  While playing, type in "let me win".



  STORM LORD

  On the credits screen, type in "DRAGONBRIDGE".  A scrolly message should
  come accross the screen reading "You cheating swine".  Now, while play-
  ing, press <Space Bar> to pause and then press <L> to skip the level.
  Alternatively, when the game starts to load, hold down the Joystick Fire
  button and the left mouse button and keep them down until the game loads.
  Then when the game starts, pause it straight away and type "MNBVC".  This
  will give you unlimited lives and time, and if you pause the game and
  press <L>, you will advance a level.



  STORMTROOPER

  Enter "JAMES CAMERON" on the high score table.  Now, whenever you need
  more lives, press <F9>.



  STREET FIGHTER  (US Gold)

  On the title screen, type in "STREET CHEAT".  Now, press <Help> while
  playing to go to the next level.

  The technique for getting past Sagat of Thailand is to watch for his
  fireballs and long reach.  Jump high, kick and retreat.  Repeat this
  until he carks it.



  STRIDER

  While playing, pause with <F9> then hold down <Help>, Left <Shift>, and
  <1> together.   Unpause and now keys <F1> to <F5> take you to the
  appropriate level, and <1> to <5> advances you to various places in the
  current level.

  There seems to be a bit of disagreement about whether it's the `F' keys
  that change levels and the number keys that change level position or
  whether it's the other way around.



  STRIDER 2

  While playing the game, type in "SWIFT".  Now press <Space> to turn
  into a robot, <T> for super speed, <S> for a smart bomb, and <E> and
  <D> for more energy.



  STRYX

  While playing, hold down <Help>, <M>, and <E> to replenish lost energy;
  <Help>, <M>, <E> and <P> to get all the passes; and <Help>, <M>, <E> and
  <F10> to be taken to the end of game puzzle.



  SUPERCARS (*)

  When asked for your name, there are a few names you can enter for special
  effects: Enter...
                             RICH for half a million dollars
                             ODIE to start at level 2
                             BIGC to start at level 3
                          or POOR for five dollars



  SUPERCARS 2

  To access the cheat, enter player one's name as "WONDERLAND" and player
  two's name as "THE SEER".   You can now start the game in one or two
  player mode with the cheat active.



  SUPER HANG-ON (*)

  There are two parts to this cheat, one verified and one unverified.

  Get the highest score on the score table (The Africa course is easiest).
  It may take a few attempts, so keep tryin'.  Now you when you enter your
  high score name, enter "750J".  Now hold down the following keys: <Ctrl>,
  Left <Alt>, <Z> and <T>.

  This part of the cheat is verified:

  Now, on your next courses, when you are hooning along, hold down the
  Left <Amiga> key and a stream of yellow bullets will knock off any riders
  in front of you.  However, there are no sound effects!

  This part of the cheat is, as yet, unverified:

  After entering the "750J" on the high score list at the top, and holding
  down the keys named above, when the screen goes back to the title page,
  you should quickly zip off to a cheat page, where you can enter new
  values using the numerical keypad.  The values are the inner outer
  coefficients on how well you handle corners.  If you enter a high number
  you will be more prone to skidding off on the corners.  If you enter a
  low number, say, 20 and 10 respectively, when you come to a corner at
  about 300 mph, you can corner with no problem at all, making it easier
  to complete a course.



  SUPER OFF ROAD RACER

  Buying tires before level two will help you in turning corners.  Winning
  races by short margins will slow down the other cars in the next level.



  SUPREMECY

  If you scrap a solar satellite on a planet with no reserves of fuel, you
  will get 30,000 lonnes of the stuff.



  SUSPENDED (Complete Solution)

  Poet - Go to Weather Control
  Sensa - Go to sub supply room
  Whiz - Go to secondary channel
  Sensa - Take ramp
  Sensa - Go west
  Sensa - Take container and grasper
  Sensa - Go to hallway junction
  Waldo - Go to hallway junction
  Auda - Go to gamma repair

  The above moves set the game up.  Poet is needed to turn the weather
  control off - this minimizes deaths at the surface (your primary goal).
  sensa gets the ramp that is needed to allow the robots to go from one
  level to another.  Auda is sent to the gamma repair area because she
  will be needed later, and without the humans coming for a while there
  is nothing that can be done with her anyway.  Waldo is sent to the
  hallway junction to meet Sensa and take the container and grasper on his
  way to fixing Iris who is reported to be out of order.

  Poet - Turn second dial to 100
  Poet - Go to hallway end
  Iris - Go to main supply room
  Sensa - Put ramp at dropoff
  Auda - Listen
  Waldo - Take container and grasper
  Waldo - Go to main supply
  Waldo - Install grasper
  Waldo - Ttake red ic and yellow ic
  Sensa - Go north
  Sensa - Take ramp

  Once Poet got to the weather control, he had to reset the faulty control
  to 100.  This is only a temporary fix because if you let the game go on
  too long, all hell will break loose with various disasters and accidents
  occuring which you will not be able to control.  Poet is then sent to
  the hallway end where he will be used to get the TV camera needed later.

  Iris is sent to the main supply room where she can be fixed when Waldo
  arrives.  She will also help Waldo repair the machine there.

  Sensa upon arriving puts the ramp in place so that Auda can get to gamma
  repair and so that She and Poet can get to the other level.  Waldo is
  handed the grasper and container which he installs.  This is done now to
  save moves later.

  Sensa - Go to small supply
  Waldo - Open panel
  Waldo - Replace rough device with rough object
  Waldo - Close panel
  Poet - Get in car
  Poet - Get out of car
  Poet - Go to biology lab
  Waldo - Take burned and fried chip
  Poet - Take camera
  Sensa - Put ramp at holder

  This stage sets the robots to their major gathering tasks.  Waldo has
  fixed Iris, and is now set on fixing the machine and salvaging its parts.
  Poet has arrived at the hallway end, gotten in the car, exited the car
  and is now getting the camera.  Sensa has arrived at the small supply
  room to take the cable cutter.

  Sensa - Get on ramp
  Sensa - Take cutter
  Sensa - Get off ramp
  Sensa - Take ramp
  Sensa - Go to sloping corridor
  Poet - Go to vehicle debarkation
  Waldo - Put red ic in red socket
  Waldo - Put yellow ic in yellow socket
  Poet - Get in car
  Poet - Get out of car

  Sensa has completed her task of getting the metal tool that she will
  need shortly.  Poet has gotten the camera and is now coming back and
  Waldo is in the midst of fixing and salvaging the machine with Iris in
  the main supply room

  Poet - Go to primary channel
  Sensa - Put ramp at dropoff
  Sensa (I think!) - Go to gamma repair
  Waldo - Push button
  Iris - Take fuse
  Waldo - Take cable
  Waldo - Go to the secondary channel
  Iris - Go to middle supply
  Iris - Take cable
  Iris - Go to main supply

  Poet has been sent to use the camera in the primary channel (this is a
  kamikaze mission because he has to pass through the cavernous room to
  get there).  Sensa has gotten to the sloping corridor and reinstalled
  the ramp so that She and Poet can get to the lower level.  Waldo and
  Iris have gotten the machine fixed and salvage one of the two needed
  cables to set the fcs in balance.

  Waldo is now sent on a kamikaze mission where Whiz will be waiting to
  install the cable needed in the secondary channel.

  Sensa - Examine object
  Sensa - Turn flowswitch
  Both Sensa and Auda - Move Fred
  Sensa -  Cut cable with cutter
  Poet - Plug TV1 in
  Poet - Aim TV1 at sign

  - This is the important reset code so write it down - it's different
    every game!

  Sensa - Take cable
  Sensa - Go to primary channel
  Iris - Put cable in machine
  Iris - Put fuse in machine

  Sensa and Auda salvaged the remaining needed cable to fix the cable in
  the primary channel.  Sensa is now on her way.  Poet valiently died
  trying to work the camera in the primary channel after having corrosive
  acid spilled on him.  Iris has fixed the reset machine now only awaiting
  the installation of the cables in the FCS to reset the systems to set
  the surface world above right.

  Whiz - Go to waldo
  Whiz - Take fourteen-inch cable
  Whiz - Replace the nine-inch cable with the fourteen-inch cable
  Whiz - Drag Waldo to the east end
  Auda - Go to sleep chamber
  Sensa - Replace four-inch cable with twelve-inch cable
  Iris - Press ----- circle
  Iris - Press ----- circle

  At this point the game is over, only 8000 are dead and you have
  succeeded in your mission.  It should be noted that this does not
  answer all the questions and puzzles that are presented in the game
  it just tells you how to win the game in the shortest number of moves.



  SWITCHBLADE

  Enter your name as "POOKY" on the high score table then hold down either
  <1>, <2>, <3>, <4> or <5> and click on `end'.   Still holding down the
  key, start a new game and you will start on the chosen level.



  SWITCHBLADE 2

  Type "LEVELx" on the title screen where `x' is the number of the level
  you wish to go to.  Then press firebutton to begin play.  Alternatively,
  typing in "CHROME" (and waiting for a while) on the title screen gives
  you access to a hidden sub-game.

  This sub-game is called Chrome.  here are some basic instructions:

  On the title screen, press <F1> for player 1, <F2> for player 2, or <F3>
  for both players.  Now type in the code word for which ever level you
  want and press <Return>.  The game needs a joystick in port 2.  Press
  the firebutton to be shown the player and level number, and press it
  again to begin play.  When playing: not all bad guys can be killed; the
  time bar near the bottom of the screen decays slowly, but decays faster
  if your craft is touching an Anti-Time block; the craft begins with a
  supply of 20 shots; up to 3 shots can be active at once; you begin with
  3 lives; keep going until the craft can go no more, then the level will
  end; a bonus is awarded according to time taken; you can skip the bonus
  countdown by pressing the fire button; there is a high score table which
  you can get your name on if you are good enough.  The properties of the
  magic yellow stars vary.

  The Codes for CHROME are as follows:

  Level 1: START
  Level 2: TRUTH
  Level 3: JELLY
  Level 4: STORY
  Level 5: CLOUD
  Level 6: MOUSE
  Level 7: HUMAN
  Level 8: FLOOR
  Level 9: PAPER
  Level 10: EARTH
  Level 11: SPACE
  Level 12: GENAM
  Level 13: APPLE
  Level 14: JUICE
  Level 15: CHESS
  Level 16: WORLD
  Level 17: AUDIO
  Level 18: LOGIC
  Level 19: TITLE
  Level 20: VENUS



  SWIV (*)

  While playing, press <P> to pause the game and type "NCC-1701N".   The
  screen should flash.   Press <P> again to unpause and from there on,
  both players should have infinite lives.



  SWORD OF ARAGON

  *** Starting Out

  The Ranger is the best man to have as your leader because the characters
  he comes with, (mage, priest, warrior and two rangers) give you the
  chance to build up your mage from the very start, and letting you get to
  those mega powerful spells like Pyro and Disintegrate really quickly,
  thus being able to do much more damage in battle, and from a distance
  where you can't be hurt.

  Also, decommision all your troops at the very start and reinforce your
  bowmen, as these are by far the best men to have as they can attack
  armies without having to engage with them, and save a lode those precious
  hit.  Infintry and mounted cavalry are not a very advisable because they
  always take a lot of damage and take too long to get to the higher
  levels.

  If you really want to have a few armies with melee weapons then go the
  whole hog and get some cavalry.  These blokes can take a hell of a lot
  of stick and still come out almost undamaged; at higher levels they can
  totally decimate the enemy.

  Remember to keep an eye on how your cities are doing, but don't spend
  too much on developement.  The best thing to do is save the same before
  you go to the next month.  That way if anything nasty happens you can
  reload it and try again, thus avoiding the situation.  Not all the
  cities have to be taken by force, and if you can get one to become your
  vassel it guarantees you a profit each month from that city.

  *** Decisions

  Muscle isn't the only thing you're going to have to use.  If you want
  your people to stay loyal you'll have to make the right decisions.  The
  man Olaf who's up for murder is innocent and should be pardoned.  When
  the Elven diplomat arrives and asks you to stop developing the lumber
  do as he wishes and become allied with the elves.  Pay ransoms or the
  people's morale will go down.

  Trolls will sometimes demand money from Sur Nova, but if you take your
  forces to the Troll's village and capture it, you shouldn't have any
  more problems.  The Nomads don't give you many problems if they become
  your enemy, but become their ally anyhow just to be on the safe side.

  *** Unknown Cities

  There are a quite a few unknown cities in the unexplored lands of Aladda,
  some of them friendly, most of them evil.  Below are a small guidelines
  on what to expect from these mysterious places and their inhabitants.

  - Tranavan: City Of The Elves

  Depending on how diplomatic you've been this place could be either
  hostile or friendly.  But if you've followed the tips you won't have any
  problems.

  - Gernok: City Of The Goblins

  This place is filled with goblin forces plus a few rather nasty looking
  monsters with magic capabilities, but it's not too hard to beat them.
  However, remains of the Goblins will come back after and try to win back
  the city.

  - Xafanta: City Of The Dwarves

  These chaps are having quite a few problems with the orcs of Zarnix,
  and they will help you defeat the orcs in the pass just before Zarnix.

  - Medeval: City Of The Elves

  This is yet another city full of Elves, however, unlike the first city
  the Elves aren't so nice and are pretty tough cookies.

  - Char: City Of The Giants

  This is where those big nasties hang out. Defeating them is quite a
  problem, but with a few cavalry to aid your bowmen you should be able to
  capture the city.  A good reason for taking this city is that the giants
  have control of a lake near to Tentula, and once you've got it back the
  city's income should increase a little.

  - Troll Village

  If you're looking for a tough battle then this is the place to come.
  There are tons of Troll and you'll need a lot of men to defeat them.
  You'll also lose a lot of men in the process.  This should stop any ran-
  somed demands from the iliterate Trolls and make life a lot easier.

  - Dersh: City Of The Titans

  Dersh is probably the last unknown city you'll come to, and it is by
  far the hardest.  A huge number of men will be needed to take over this
  city, and nearly all of them will be lost in the battle.



  SWORD OF SODAN

  Enter your name as "NANCY" into the high score table for infinite lives,
  and while playing, pressing <Return> advances you a level.

  According to another source...

  Play a game, get into the high score table, enter your name, then play
  another game.  Press Fire so you can move about, find a safe place where
  you could stand still for a while and not get killed, then stand still
  a while and type in "discoverysoftware" and press <Return>.  You should
  see a message on screen.

  You will now have infinite lives and will go to the next level.  Now
  you can press <Return> anytime to travel to the next level.

  Alternatively, If you type "RAD" into the highscore table and play
  another game, you will have unlimited lives!



 TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT



  TARGET RENEGADE

  On the high score table enter your name as "PA...." for infinite lives.



  TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES

  On the security code entry area, enter the code "8859" and press
  <Return>.  Then enter "1506" and press <Return>.  Now enter the correct
  code and when playing, pressing <Help> will give you infinite energy.



  TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES

  See TEENAGE MUTANT HERO TURTLES - same cheat



  TERMINATOR 2

  While playing, pause the game, press <F1>, <F2>, and the firebutton.  Now
  press <Escape> to skip a level.



  TEST DRIVE

  Holding down the joystick Fire button while going round corners will
  prevent you from sliding and hitting the walls.



  TEST DRIVE 2 - THE DUEL (*)

  While playing type in "GAS".  The sound will go off.  Now press <S> to
  get the sound back on again, and you will suddenly be about 10 metres
  from the target gas station.  Alternatively, type "AERTH" for better
  braking and acceleration.

  Compilers Note: If you do this before you even move it will work, and
  you will have an average speed of about 3300 mph.  However due to the
  way the scoring system is done, if you have a speed that is this high,
  you will actually score negative points.  This brings your score down!
  So do this cheat somewhere in the middle of the stage if you want to
  achieve maximum points.



  THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN

  On the high score table type "generic".  (I'm not sure if this means
  type it or enter it as your name, so try `em both.)  Now when you press
  <Help> during play you'll receive full energy.



  THE BLUES BROTHERS

  On the character selection screen, type in "HOULQ", then a press number
  from <1> to <6> depending on which level you want to start on.  Now press
  <Space Bar> to begin on your chosen level.

  THE GODFATHER

  While playing, pause the game with the <Help> key and type in "Pizza
  Hut" for infinite energy.  (I'm not sure if any of the letters are meant
  to be capitals or what, so, as usual, try, try, try...)



  THE IMMORTAL

  Codes for higher levels are:

  Level 2: befe810006f70
  Level 3: cc5ee21000e10
  Level 4: 465fa31001eb0
  Level 5: b57f943000eb0
  Level 6: 1bbeb53010a41
  Level 7: 8ddfb62010ac1
  Level 8: e011f730178c1

  In Level 4, walk around the ring on the floor three times to open the
  floor.  In level 7, when Norlac dives underwater, you must hurry back and
  throw yourself into the whirlpool rather than climbing the ladder.   In
  level 8, to defeat the dragon and Mordamir, use the BLINK spell six
  times, then use the fire protection spell just before he breathes fire at
  you, and not when he takes a quick breath.   When he pauses, hold up the
  amulet and Mordamir will spin in.   Use the STATUE spell three times to
  avoid being killed by the lightning, then just as he starts his next
  spell, put up a SONIC spell.   Use STATUE twice more and when he animates
  the bones, hit the statue just before they reach you.   He will now say
  that you have no more defences, so wait until he holds up the amulet then
  cast the MAGNETIC spell.   Bingo - end of game.



  THE KILLING CLOUD

  When the game asks for a mission code, enter "1KILLING".  You will start
  the game with 28 PUPs and 28 nets.

  THE RUNNING MAN (Complete Solution)

  Enter your name as "DdIiSsKk" on the high score table, and you should now
  have infinite energy.

  Alternatively, here is a complete solution:

  Level 1

  Right just make your way rightwards kicking the dog occasionally until
  you spot the crevasse, now, you need to run up to the first ice platform
  from the floor, and when you are a couple of paces from it, jump, and
  keep jumping until you are over the crevasse. Once you've done this, the
  only trouble you'll have is the `stalker' and a dog.  Oh and also once
  you have killed the `stalker', the place fills with gas.  What you do is
  this, run right, and kick the `stalker', when he comes by, the only way
  he can harm you is by whacking his exploding pucks at you, or whacking
  you with his stick (whatever you call it, and he doesn't do this very
  often!) If he comes up behind you, run towards him and kick him, then
  continue right.  It is important that you get as far right as you can,
  so that when you have killed the `stalker', you don't get killed by the
  gas as you are running to the exit.

  Level 2

  Make your way to the right, when the dog comes give it a boot.  Even-
  tually you will come to the brick, pick this up and run with it until
  you come to the pipe.  Now chuck the brick, pick up the pipe, run with
  pipe to right.  You will then find the brick again.  Put down the pipe,
  pick up the brick, and chuck it again, pick up the pipe and continue
  running right.  Repeat this process of chucking the brick, putting down
  the pipe, pickup the brick, chuck the brick, pickup the pipe, continue
  right.  Eventually you will get to a much needed medical pack.  Collect
  this, then collect the brick and crawl through the metal tube that's
  ahead, when through, chuck the brick.  Go back through the metal pipe,
  and pick up the pipe, then go back through the metal pipe again, with
  the pipe in your hand.  Keep running to the right, kick the dog if
  necessary, chuck the break when you find it.  The `stalker' will appear,
  chuck the brick at him, bash him with the pipe, after you have hit him,
  crawl, as he can't get you if you duck and crawl, then hit him again,
  don't forget to kick the dog, as the dog can get you when you crawl/duck.
  Once killed, run for the exit (no gas this time!)

  Level 3

  Run to the medical pack and collect it, kick the dog when it comes.  Keep
  running until you find the `stalker'.  Don't try hitting him, because if
  you do, you'll get electricuted.  Your objective now is to get past the
  `stalker'.  If he raises his hand and fires, duck and crawl past him.
  If he lowers his hand and fires, just run and jump past him.  Keep going
  to the right until you come to the brick.  When the `stalker' comes at
  you in his battle car, jump at it in the way it's coming at you.  This
  way it won't knock you over.  When you have found the brick collect it,
  throw at the `stalker', then run or crawl towards it again, collect it
  and throw it at the `stalker' again.  Keep doing this until he is dead,
  and run for the exit.

  Level 4

  Run to the right, kick the dog until you come to the `stalker'.  When
  you find him, keep moving about until he flys into the air (using his
  flame thrower as a jet pack).  Now keep running about in both dir-
  ections, and when he comes near punch or kick him, watch out for the
  flames though - duck. (quack!).  When he is a dead duck, go to the exit.

  Level 5

  Very simple really: keep going to the right, bashing the dogs and
  biffing the guards, and spiffo, you have reached the exit and finished.



  THE SECRET OF MONKEY ISLAND

  Compilers Note: There is a good chance that the Full Solution will be
  here soon!  (grumble...this game is too big!...grumble)

  When you want to fight the Swordmaster on Melee Island, you don't have to
  search through the forest - you can go to the shop and tell the shopkeeper
  that you want to see the Swordmaster.  Then, when he leaves the shop
  quickly follow him and he will show you the way.  To get into the safe,
  the proper sequence is: pull, pull, push, pull, pull, pull, push, push,
  push, push.


  Part Solution:

  Part Two - The Journey

  Once the crew have talked to you and you have returned to your cabin,
  open the drawer in the desk and look at the contents of the drawer.
  Look at the book to read it.  Pick up the feather quill and the jar of
  ink, walk to the door to get to the deck, walk to the rope ladder and
  pick up the Jolly Roger when you get to the top of the ladder.  Go back
  down to the deck and go down the hatch.  Walk to the door to get to the
  galley.
  Open the cupboard and take the box of cereal.  Open it to get the prize.
  Look at and you will see that it is a small key.  Now pick up the pot
  and Walk back up the ladder.  Walk to the hatch to get down into the
  hold.  Open the chest on the right and look at it to get some fine wine.



  THE SEVEN GATES OF JAMBALA

  The correct combination in the staff section is: Brown, Yellow, Violet,
  Red, Light Blue, Blue, Green.



  THE SIMPSONS

  Type in "COWABUNGA" on the opening section of the game for infinite
  lives.

  When you have the whistle, stand by the last window of the Springfield
  Retirement Home and blow it.  Now a guy should appear and start throwing
  lotsa money at you, so grab it and go on a shopping spree!



  THE SPY WHO LOVED ME

  Start the game, stop the car and type "MISS MONEYPENNY".   You should
  now have infinite lives and cash.

  TOKI (*)

  Compilers Note: I have seen at least five different supposed cheats for
  Toki.  However, this is the one that works for me, thus it is the one I
  have printed here

  Start the game and type in "killer".  You should now have infinite
  credits.  Pressing <R> inverts the screen, and you can now press <F1> to
  <F7> to go to that level or <F8> to see the end of game sequence.  You
  can play the game upside-down if your really weird, or you can return
  things to normal by pressing <N>.



  TORVAK THE WARRIOR

  On the high score table, type in "CHEAT...." (with as many full stops
  as you can fit in), then hold down Fire Button and <1> to <5> to be
  transported to the level.



  TOTAL ECLIPSE

  While playing, hold down <1> and <9> on the main keyboard while pressing
  Fire to see the fireworks display.



  TOTAL RECALL

  On the title screen type in "LISTEN TO THE WHALES" and the screen should
  flip over.   In game, you should have infinite energy.   Also, when you
  reach the taxi level type in "JIMMY HENDRIX" for an indestructable cab.



  TOYOTA CELICA G.T. RALLY

  While playing, press <C> to jump to the next stage.  This should work,
  but if it doesn't press <Escape> and <C> at the same time.



  TRAILBLAZER

  On the title screen hold down <Help>, <I>, <1> and <2>, then type
  "CHEAT".  In game, <F3> removes gravity, <F5> changes ball shape, <F6>
  changes the other players ball, and press <Help> to hear laugh.



  TRAINED ASSASSIN

  Let the demo start then press and hold down <2>, <4>, <Y>, Left cursor
  key, and <7> on the numeric keypad for infinite lives.  Also, hold down
  <A>, <T>, <.>, <4> and <Enter> on the numeric keypad.   Now <F1> to <F5>
  changes the level.



  TREASURE ISLAND DIZZY

  For moving around the map, stand as near as possible to the water.  Hold
  down the keys <S>, <P>, <A>, <C>, and <Space Bar>.  Now, when you press
  <C>, you disappear and pressing <Space Bar> makes you reappear.  When you
  have disappeared, <M> makes the map move around.



  TRINITY

  To survive in Earth orbit you must find a round airtight object in the
  fantasy land.   The snake can be distracted by feeding it but it prefers
  live food.   The roadrunner will wake the dog but if you drop the crumbs
  there it will take some time for it to stop and eat them.  Put Skiak in
  your pocket and head to the top of the vortex to stop the icicle from
  melting.



  TURBO OUTRUN

  After the countdown, type in "WEARPEEPEL".  Now to get more turbos
  press <D>, press <F> to see the ending, or <G> to lose a credit.



  TURRICAN (*)

  loads of mines, lasers, etc.



  TURRICAN 2

  Press <Help> to get into the music menu, press <4> to turn off the music,
  then press <2>.   After about 10 seconds of music, press <Escape> twice.
  You can now start the game with infinite lives and power lines.



 UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU



  ULTIMA 3

  Visit lord British to get extra hit points of up to 550.  There won't be
  any sea monsters if you own two ships.   The moon gates open about every
  seventy to ninety moves.



  ULTIMA 4

  The candle of Love can be found in the township of Cove.   You can find
  the altar rooms in level 8 by peering at a gem and searching each room.
  The secret passage can be found in the chamber of ANKH.



  ULTIMA 5

  You can fight for money but don't steal food.   It can be bought in Moon-
  glow.   Look in the chambers of Lord British for the magic carpet.   The
  cities and shrines are almost the same as Ultima 4.   You can find people
  in every town who know the passwords to the dungeons.   You will need to
  get an item from Empath Abbey to climb the mountains before completing
  the game.

  Starting Off

  When first starting the game you will find yourself in a hut in the
  middle of a thick forest in the NW of Britannia. Before you leave this
  hut have a good look around, not only inside but outside.  Find the horse
  and talk to him. You should save your game before you venture out into
  the wilderness this will save you having to go through the stuff at the
  start again if you happen to get killed.  I recommend that the first
  place you visit is the Castle of Lord British.  Getting there should be
  simple since now you know where you are.  Just make your way East to the
  Dragon Spine Mountains and then follow them south until you find the way
  through.  This appears on your map as an plain brown area.  Save your
  game along the way incase you run into some monsters and get killed.

  Exploring and Mapping

  Again in this type of game accurate map making is very important, map
  everything, Towns, keeps, lighthouses and especially dungeons.  Mark in
  all doors, secret doors, traps and ways up or down.  And label things
  like Inns, taverns, Guilds, Apothecaries, pubs, shipwrights etc.  Some
  times it will be necessary to visit one place more than once so if a
  certain person tells you to get a piece of information from somewhere
  else then make note of where he or she was so you don't have to go
  searching again when you return.  Once you have found a Sextant (and
  there is one to be found) make a list of all the localities and their
  grid references, it will help.  You will notice that there are a lot of
  inscriptions or runes around the map.  Make an effort to translate all
  of them into English, you will need to know where some key locations are
  later in the game.

  Finding Your Party

  Unlike other Role Playing Games in Ultima you must find your party and
  not create it.  Since Ultima IV (Quest Of The Avatar) the rest of your
  party have gone on to live there own lives and do other things, you will
  come across them in your travels and you should allow them to join you
  once again.  If you are new to Ultima you of course won't know who I am
  talking about, when you come across them they will recognise you.  But I
  will give you a list of all of them and where to find them,

       Jana    - Secret passage under the town of Yew
       Mariah  - The Lycaeum
       Katrina - New Magincia
       Gefory  - Buccaneer's Den
       Dupre   - Bordermarch Keep

  You may only have six characters in your party at any one time so you
  must choose who you will have.

  Dungeons

  Some of the dungeons you will delve into are very intricate, accurate
  mapping is a must.  I don't find it necessary to map dungeon rooms, I
  just represent them as a square with an `R' in it.  If the room contains
  a way up or down I just put a little up or down arrow in the square.
  Some rooms will have secret panels that you must push or walk over in
  order to open up other parts of the room.  Sometimes you may have to
  throw something like an axe in order to activate a panel, or open a door.
  It's a good idea that when you have defeated all the monsters in the
  room to walk around a bit and push things in order to see if there are
  any secret passages.  A good guideline to follow is that if the word
  "Victory" doesn't appear when you have killed all the beasties there is
  something more to do.

  Combat

  Get into as much combat as you can.  The more experience points you have
  the more levels you will gain, and the stronger you will become.  What's
  different about the combat system used here is that the character who
  kills the monster gets the experience points, instead of everybody
  getting there share.  So try and give everybody there share of kills, so
  you won't have some characters falling behind in levels.  Having a mage
  that can cast spells from the 8th circle is a must, spells like Cone Of
  Energy really come in handy in the latter stages of the game.  Although
  getting to the 8th Circle takes a long time.  Don't keep weapons that are
  of no use, sell what you don't want.

  The Underworld

  The Underworld is a big place and you must go there a few times in order
  to recover certain artefacts. I always used a different save disc when I
  visited the Underworld, it's a very hard place to map and you will get a
  lot of combat practice.  Getting lost is very easy to accomplish, so take
  plenty of magic gems with you.  You will also notice that there isn't
  much light in the Underworld so make sure that you have plenty of torches
  and enough of the appropriate reagents to mix a lot of Vas Lor (Great
  light) spells.



  UNDER PRESSURE

  Type in "GRAYMALKIN" while playing.  Now, <F1> will skip levels and <1>
  to <9> will give you all the weapons.



  UNINVITED (*)

  To get past the ghostly lady, go towards the hall from the stairs, enter
  the storage closet and take the No-Ghost bottle.  Open the bottle and
  go back to the hall.  Operate the bottle on the lady.  To get past the
  dogs, say "INSTANTUM ILLUMINARIS ABRAXAS" to them.  You will find a key
  if you operate the knife on the left chair in the lounge.  This key is
  used to open the cabinet in the master bedroom.  In the cathedral, say
  "SPECAN HEAFOD ABRAXAS" to the plaster head.



  UNREAL

  On the animation screen featuring the 3D balls, type "ORDILOGICUS" and
  press <Return>.  The screen should flash white or colors.  You now have
  unlimited energy on the next play.  Skip levels by pressing <Return>.



  UNTOUCHABLES

  On the title screen, type in "SOUTHAMPTONGAZETTE" then while playing,
  <F10> will advance you a level.   On levels 2, 3 and 6, with the cheat
  mode on, pressing <Help> will take you halfway through the level you are
  on.



 VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV



  VAXINE (*)

  Start the game as normal, then type in "WILDEBEESTE".  Now you can press
  keys for various effects.  <F1> to go up a level, <F2> to go down a
  level, <F3> to go up 10 levels, and <F10> to go up a level and get a
  bonus.



  VENOM WING

  When the scrolly Thalamus logo appears type in "IDJ" and the screen
  should flash.  You should now have infinite lives.

  Level 7 (The Creeping Swamp): LYCAENID
  Level 8 (Tech World): PYRALID
  Level 9 (Translucent Plain): NOCTUID

  Alternatively, typing in the names of some of the planets of our solar
  system apparently give special effects such as infinite time, etc.



  VETERAN

  Press <Help> to skip a level.



  VIGILANTE

  Enter your name as "GREEN CRYSTAL" into the high score table then, while
  playing, pressing <F1> will give you extra lives and <F8> will advance
  you a level.



  VIKING CHILD

  toggle special effects on/off, <L> will add one missile, <F> will re-
  plenish lost fuel, <D> for demo on/off, and <N> for cheat mode on/off.



  VIZ

  On the selection screen, type in "WHAT A GREAT LOAD OF BOLLOCKS".  Then
  keys <1> to <5> will take you to the appropriate level.



  VOODOO CASTLE

  A rabbits foot is great for good luck in the lab.



  VOODOO NIGHTMARE

  This hint will make the game somewhat easier to play. You have probably
  noticed by now that all the nasties go to sleep at night.  When you pause
  the game, the day/night timer still runs.  Thus it is possible to play
  only during the safe night periods, and pausing the game during the
  dangerous daylight.



  VOYAGER (*)

  On the title screen type in "when the sweet showers of april fall" and a
  forth option will apear.   Select this option and you have access to
  three different types of cheat: infinite shields, infinite fuel, and
  all the equipment.

  If you press <Enter> on the main option screen, when the cheat mode is
  active, you have access to an object viewer:

  <Shift>, <Delete>, <Help> - cycle through objects
  Cursor Keys - rotate object
  <7> - decrease size of object
  <4> - enlarges size of object
  <Space> to return to Main Menu

  In game:

  <F1> - Go down a level
  <F2> - Go up a level
  <F3> - Cycle through languages
  <F8> - Game Position
  <F9> - Data on object
  <F10> - Frame rate



 WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW



  WAR IN MIDDLE EARTH

  Here are the locations of some of the objects in the game:

  Tuckborough - Black Flask
  East of Buckland - Wooden Staff
  Grey Havens & Michel Delving - Blue Potion
  Forlond - Black Flask
  South of Forland - Palantir
  Belegost - Mithril Mail
  Bombadils' House - Elven Blade
  Barrows Downs - Elven Blade
  North of Barrow Downs - Elven Blade
  West of Annuminas - Golden Sceptre
  South of Ost-in-Edhil - Ancient Sword
  Rivendell - Mithril Mail
  Lorien - Elven Cloak, Glowing Phial, Coil of Rope
  North of Grebor - Dwarven Hammer
  North of Dol Goldur - Dwarven Ring
  South of Mount Gram - Black Flask, Red Arrow, Mithril Mail

  If Gandalf goes to Derdingle, 1,000 huorns will go to Hornburg and 1,000
  Ents will go to Isengard.  Aragorn can be found at Bree and Merry can be
  found at Buckland.  Five-hundred trolls can easily handle everyone from
  Minas Tirith, Osgiliath and Cair Andros.



  WARZONE

  On the title screen, press <F1>, followed by <F2>, followed by <F3>, and
  you will get infinite lives.



  WEIRD DREAMS

  While playing, in the hall of mirrors, walk into the rightmost mirror as
  far as you can go without passing to the other side and tap out "SOS" in
  morse code with the <Help> key.   Thats `Dot-Dot-Dot  Dash-Dash-Dash
  Dot-Dot-Dot'.  This should give you infinite lives.



  WINGS (*)

  Each letter of the word WINGS on the main title screen does something.
  Hold down Right Mouse Button, now hold down <Ctrl>, Left <Shift>, and
  Left <Amiga>.  Now click on a letter with the Left Mouse Button.  The
  effects are:

  W - Toggles music on/off
  I - Turns <Caps Lock> into an autofire button
  N - No flight school missions
  G - Guess (Dunno what this does!)
  S - Saves game without having to exit game

  Alternatively, go to flight school, and click on the bullseye on the
  plane up the top of the screen with the Left Mouse Button.  You will
  be taken back to the main menu.  (some versions may ask if you want to
  quit - say no!)  Now return to flight school if you have to, and create
  a new pilot and call him "Orca The Killer Tomato" (it IS case sensitive
  so type it in exactly as it appears here).  Orca already has his wings
  and is the best at all the skills.

  To access a large menu of options, go to flight school, create a new
  pilot and name him "  Who is The Riddler" (yes, two spaces at the front
  and it is case sensitive).  But, instead of pressing <Return> to enter
  the name, hit <Escape> instead.  Now you can choose to run any or all
  of these yummy cheats!



  WINGS OF FURY

  When on the carrier, type in "COLIN WAS HERE".  Then <C> changes weapons
  in flight, <M> gives you infinite weapons, <P> gives you an extra life,
  <D> makes you immune, and <F> fully refuels you.



  WITNESS

  There is nothing you can do to stop the murder taking place.  Make sure
  that you examine the keyhole of the clock closely.  A good hiding place
  is the couch.  Ask Duffy for hints - he can be quite helpful.  Search the
  Butler after the crime.



  WIZBALL

  While playing, pause and type in "RAINBOW".   Then unpause and press <C>
  to fill the pot, <S> to complete the level, and <T> to complete the game.



  WIZBIZ

  Put the token in the slot in the Gargoyle.   To get ahead, drink the
  beer.  Give the water demon the earrings to keep him happy.



  WOLFCHILD

  When the title screen appears, type in "the perfect kiss".  You will
  now be able to start the game with infinite weapons.  You could also
  try typing in "its not all walking" while playing, and you will be able
  to restart on that level.



  WOLFMAN

  Find the key under the lid.  To get the book, insert, push, and remove
  the key.  To find the flask, go to the weed, then go north, west, then
  south.  When you get the flask, fill it by the stream.  To get out of the
  ungetoutable room, do this: open the chest, get the garment, remove the
  doublet, burn it, wear the garment, examine your hands, wash them, look
  in the mirror and wash your face.  You can avoid killing the traveller on
  the bridge by looking at the water and closing your eyes.  In the caves,
  throw the flint to get past the skeleton.  When you see the hunters by
  the fire, look around, climb the tree, look around again, then drop the
  touch powder on the fire.

  XYBOTS

  Enter "ALF" into the high score table for infinite energy.



 YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY


  Are there actually any games that start with `Y'?

  (Apart from Yolanda I mean, which as far as I know hasn't got a cheat.)



 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ



  Z-OUT

  While playing, press <J> and <K> together for infinite lives.  Then hold
  down <J> while presing one of the keys from <1> to <8> to be taken to the
  respective level.



  ZAK MACKRAKEN

  To find the lighter, pick up the first passenger seat in the plane.  It
  is hidden underneath.



  ZANY GOLF

  To get to the secret level, make it to the last level (energy), and
  find the mouse hole where two eyes appear occasionally.  When the eyes
  turn red, putt the ball into the hole to warp to the secret level,
  apparently called "Mystery".



  ZOMBI (*)

  Compilers note: This is a partial solution (partial to what, you might
  ask? Ha! Ha!) and I hope to have the complete solution to ZOMBI in the
  next  release.

  Go to level two and take the keys from the office.  Take the lift to level
  four and use the keys to enter the control room.  Drop the keys and take
  the three truck keys.  Go down to level one, and move the trucks in front
  of the entrance.  This will stop zombies from entering the mall.  When all
  three trucks are blocking the entrance, leave the character inside the
  truck - he can't be killed while he's there.  Get the gun from the shop
  on level two, and shoot the zombie in the head.  When it is killed, put
  the body in to the lift.



  ZOOM

  Press the F10 key when asked to select the starting level and you will be
  able to start at level 30 instead of level 10.
