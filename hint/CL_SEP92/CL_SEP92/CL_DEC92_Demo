  Greetings to all you CheatList readers!  This is, I suppose, a crippled
  version of the December release of the list.  This file will list the
  games covered by the December release, so you can see what you're getting
  for your money, and also give details on how to register.  I am doing it
  this way because this list has been very expensive to produce and contin-
  ually update, and in my opinion, CheatList is well worth the A$5 or so
  that you have to pay.

  The reason that these measures are being taken now is that the December
  release is more than 250 Kilobytes bigger than the September release, and
  it looks as though the file size will keep growing steadily.  So, please
  support this effort - for a small amount of money, you are receiving a
  great product, as well as regular updates.

  By the way, the April release is ready and available for any regi-
  stered users!  So, send in your details for the best help around for
  dealing with the latest games!


  Anyway...to business:



  CHEATLIST - December 1992 Release

  CheatList - The Ultimate Games Help Compilation for the Amiga
  Compiled by Peter Monk


  Games Covered: 529
  Games Verified: 69
  Complete Solutions: 51


  The asterisk (*) after the name of the game means that the cheat
  for that game has been verified - ie, it works.  If it is not marked
  as verified, it doesn't mean it won't work - it just means that I have
  been unable to test the cheat.  Some of these cheats will not work,
  because of the number of people this information has passed through -
  the cheats may be altered a little bit each time, and pretty soon you
  have a few cheats that don't really work, but I have attempted to
  discover if these cheats do work, and have passed this information on
  to you. 

  If you are after a cheat for a game, and you look up the name of the
  game on the index and it says, for eg, "THE RUNNING MAN (Complete Sol-
  ution", it means that, while a complete solution is listed, there may
  also be a cheat, codes, etc. listed as well.  So, if a game is indexed
  as having a complete solution but you want a cheat, have a look anyway,
  because there may well be one!

  If you discover any cheats for a game, or have any hints, etc, please
  write in and I will credit the cheat, etc, to your name in the next
  release.  However, please don't submit information that you know is
  false, because I would like people to be able to rely on CheatList.

  Remember: The september release was the last freely redistributable
  release (except that I suspect that I may have released an October
  release, so if you do find one, it is legitimate), and this crippled
  December release is freely distributable as well.  However, the full
  December release, and any release after that are not!  See the relevant
  doc files in the releases for the legal information.

  Also note that these releases (September and December 1992) may seem
  to be a little out-of-date.  Rest assured that there are releases after
  this!  These are merely to enable you to see what the list is like and
  to allow you to see if you would find the list useful.  I am currently
  working on the June 1993 release, so any of you who register will
  continue to get the most up-to-date help on those games!

  Have fun, and I hope to hear from you soon.
