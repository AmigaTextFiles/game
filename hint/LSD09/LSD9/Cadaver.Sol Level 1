                                CADAVER - SOLUTION TO THE FIRST LEVEL

Typed in by SIDEWINDER for LSD.


The caves lie beneath the castle and contain many distinct areas; the
mines, the mortuary, the gaol, the crypts, the chapel and the king's tomb.
A secret opening onto the marsh has allowed Karadoc to gain access
unobserved.  Karadoc starts in the old mine workings and is seeking the
route up to the next level of the castle.
In the first room, collect the pickaxe, coin and diary, then go north.
Pull the lever (this unlocks the north door) and leave through the north
door.  Collect the sack of stones that is on the floor (weapon) and go
west.  Kill the spiny creature and then collect the charm; head south.
Collect the runic stone that is on the ground, kill the spider that drops
from the ceiling and exit north twice.  There are several sacks in this
room, and if you move them you will discover a gem; collect the gem, kill
the worm and exit south.
Go east twice and then south to get to the main chamber, and once there
collect the rope on top of the barrel (the barrel is filled with stamina
restoring potion) and head east twice.  Collect the key in this room and
then make your way back to the room you started from.  Head east from here
this time into the next room and pull the lever that is there.  Make your
way back to the main chamber and go through the now unlocked southern door.
The passage you are now in is blocked by a large wall, but don't worry,
just simply keep on throwing the pickaxe at the wall until it is completely
destroyed, and then exit by the south door.
Search the skeleton in the corridor, and take the clue book that appears.
Go east; you are now at map point A.  This corridor has four buttons on the
northern wall.  These unlock the door to the dragon room if pressed in the
right order (1432, the left button equals one), although you won't be going
there right away.  Once you1've pressed the buttons go north, and then west
to where the well is, take the key that is hidden under the bones, and
leave again.  Go west into the stores, open the chest and take all the
contents (coin, chicken and bread).  Go east, and then north into the gaol.
Collect the coin on the table, use the key on the keyhole in the west wall
and go north into cell one.  Exit south straightaway and kill the monster
that has appeared, then go into the next cell.  There is a man present in
this cell and giving him food will provide you with some handy clues; exit
south afterwards.  Go east into cell three and exit west.  Head east into
cell four, collect the key, exit west.  Now return to map point A, and head
east from there.  Collect the green gem and hit the button on the wall to
lift the cover in the Cadaver store.  Read the book to find out what
you're meant to do with the gems and the pit, then go north into the Cadaver
store.
Drop the rope down the hole in  the  centre  of the room and then fall down
the pit.  Walk over to the rat  and  open  it  to reveal a key for the east
door, collect the other  key  that  is  on  the  floor,  open the chest and
collect the urn that was inside.  Go east twice into a small room.  Collect
all the gems (you should now have six) and go back to the main pit room
that you entered through the hole.  Throw each of the six gems into the
water and you should be teleported to map point B (this is a bit confusing
as when you leave via door E you will be moved to map point F).  From here
go east into the embalming room.  Search the skeleton to find a hidden key
(touching the other corpse will disturb a monster).  After getting the key
go north into the balm store.  There are several potions in this room on a
ledge; cure poison (unknown), shot shield, stamina (red cross), poison
(acrid). Drink or collect the ones you want.  The key on the floor is for
the keyhole in the west wall which reveals three spiders and is not
necessary.
Go back into the embalming room and then head east into the purifactory.
Take the learn potion spell and the giant jump potion (frogskin), then go
west and south to the offal store, although this contains nothing of value.
Return to the corridor with the row of buttons (w,w,w,w); from here exit
south, but be ready with the bag of stones so that you can kill the hopping
brain.  Insert the key (skeleton) into the keyhole and continue south.
Go west twice to the mourning room and kill the hopping brain that is on
the table (not too hard considering it's asleep), then take both the holy
water flasks and the charm before going south.  There is another brain to
kill in this room, however, this one is awake, but if you're quick enough
you should be OK.  Collect the key that is left after you've destroyed the
brain, then go west and north to the Royal Armoury.
Pick up the bronze armour, the sword, the red striped shield and the bronze
helmet.  Now exit south and west into the ante room.  Press the button on
the wall (without the armour that you collected this will not work) and you
will be transported to the king's secret treasury.  Take the crown, the
coins and the charm and then pull the lever to go back to the ante room.
Head south and open the chest with the key you got from the brain and take
the contents (meat and coin).  Return to the mourning room and exit east
into the passage, then east again and south.  You should now be in the
first room of the chapel.  Two bugs are wandering around, but they can be
easily avoided.  Put out the flames in the bowls by jumping on them (this
unlocks the east door), then go east three times to the common crypt.
Collect the key on the alter (revealed when the urn smashes), push the four
stones off the other alter to reveal a dispel trap spell and a canister of
experiance (open the canister, and take the spell).  Exit east into the
shrine.
Collect the money and the bag of stones then return to the common crypt.
Go south into the glutton's shrine and throw the joint of meat onto the
shrine to be rewarded with a super fast potion.  Take it and go back to the
common crypt and head through the west door then north into the lesser
crypt.  Under the pile of stones there is a runic stone (spell); take this
then south and north to the priest's crypt.  While standing on the alter
search the large urn to reveal a charm and a worm.  Take the charm and and
go south twice to the warrior's crypt.  Drop the gold funerary coin onto
the tomb of Kazah, and then collect the potion (fire shield; save this for
the dragon).  Go north again (you will have seen these two rooms when you
were teleported from the pit), and cast a dispel trap on the chest.  Open
the chest and collect the charm and urn.  Return to the first room of the
chapel and go south.  Avoid the bug and drop the urn of Lord Carolus onto
the alter of Lord Carolus and collect the spell that appears (massacre:
unknown and unusable till known.  Save this for the dragon).  Exit south to
the inner sanctum, and west into the crematorium.  Place the urn of Ragnar
the chief alchemist onto the appropriate slab, collect the flask of blood
and return to the inner sanctum.
Drop the blood on the high alter, collect the key and the spell (read
magic), use the key in the keyhole in the west wall, then go west. Cast
dispel trap on the chest, then open it and take the runic stone (read
language).  Head north into the library, collect the spell (map) and return
to the inner sanctum.  Drop the unknown spell that you found earlier and
cast read magic upon it;  this will allow you to use it to kill the dragon.
Now go south and west into the purifactory.
Drop a flask of holy water into the bowl and then drink it; this will
teleport you into a hidden treasure chamber.  Pull the lever and collect
the reward, pull the lever again to be teleported back to the room adjacent
to the purifactory.  Repeat this as many times as you have flasks of holy
water.
Having got the massacre spell, the fire protection and the king's crown you
are now fully equipped to face the dragon.  Go back to the passage with the
four buttons and go west into the dragon room.  Drink the fire shield
potion to protect you from the fireballs, hold the massacre potion and
press fire to cast it ridding you of the troublesome monster.  Press
the button on the wall, exit north, pull the lever, and its level 2!

End.
