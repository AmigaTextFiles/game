LOTUS ESPRIT TURBO CHALLENGE
If you're having trouble qualifying, then simply select a two player game,
enter player one's name as: IN A BIG COUNTRY, and player two's name as:
FIELDS OF FIRE.  Now you can qualify even if you don't finish in the top ten.
If that's not enough, then enter MONSTER as player one and SEVENTEEN for
player two.  You should now be able to get into a bonus game!

KICK OFF 2
is your opponent's goalkeeper stopping too many of your shots?  Well try this
little cheat to put the odds in your favour.
Run along the function keys (that is press them, not stick your feet on the
keyboard) and S12 or S14 should appear on the top right-hand corner of the
screen.  You will now be able to substitute one of your players for your
opponent's goalie.  The sub goalie is more often pretty rubbish and if you
repeat the process he will be even worse.

MIDNIGHT RESISTANCE
If you're not a suitable 'hard man' and can't whup the enemy good, then type
in: ITS EASY WHEN YOU KNOW HOW (including spaces) foe infinite everything.
This should make defeating King Crimson a much easier task.

End.
