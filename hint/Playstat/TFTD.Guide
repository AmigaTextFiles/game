1.0 WHAT IS XCOM AND OTHER THINGS...

     1.1.1 What is the "background" of XCOM2: TFTD?

It is the year 2040. New aliens in flying subs (unidentified swimming
objects, or USOs) have appeared all over the world, often attacking
ships and terrorizing coastal cities. Only one force stand in their
way: the XCOM Underwater Experimental Facility.


     1.4.2 BUG: 

In two-stage missions, all aliens stunned from the first part are
counted as DEAD. All items not carried on the soldiers are NOT
available in the second part.

HydroJet Cannon can only be fired underwater, but when on land, a
soldier can reaction fire it...

2.0 BASES AND GEOSCAPE

The GeoScape screen is where you will control the interceptions and
provides access to the BattleScape and the base controls.  But since
you must establish a base first, let us talk about that first.


     2.1.1 Where should I put my first base? Later?

There are several things to consider while placing your first base.
Keep in mind that your first base will be your only base for a while,
so make sure you place it where you get maximum coverage of the
sponsors, who also pays the most.

The problem is how to maximize the country coverage WHILE maximizing
the covered countries' total payment. We know that the US pays the
most (always), so a base near US is usually a good idea. Something in
the Gulf of Mexico further out is good.ranges than XCOM1.


     2.1.3 What should I add to my base at first? Later?

Initial modifications you need for the main base are: alien
containment (prisoners), general stores (ammo and captured artifacts),
and long range sonar (detection). Later, with more money, add labs,
llving quarters, workshops, and defense, in approximately that order.

Defenses comes last usually since you can defend with aquanauts and
SWSs. Of course, don't clog up the 80-items list.

If you have lots of money and the necesary techs to build a craft, try
to keep an sub pen available,

     2.1.7 Base Management

Since it takes several weeks before additional modules to the base can
be brought online, you need to build them ahead of time. See the base
status often to see how full are your facilities getting. If they are
getting close, start building additional facilities so that they'll be
ready by the time you need them.

Examine base status at least twice every month, check living quarters,
workshops and labs, etc, and determine your expansion schedule. See
above.  Dismantle extra stuff before end of month so you don't pay
maintainence on them.

Hire engineers and scientists at the last hour of the month so that
they get delivered early NEXT month, so you get maximum research from
them while not paying an extra penny in salary.

     2.2 Sub Intercepts

If you send multiple crafts after one subs and the subs gets shot down
or destroyed, the shooter will go home, but other crafts will continue
onto the crash site, THEN return to their base.  So make them return
to base manually. They will return faster, and thus be refueled/
rearmed/ repaired for next sortie faster. Click on its icon on
GeoScape and select "return to base".

If an USO has landed/bottomed, keep a fighter sub on top of it.  That
way, if it takes off before your transport get there, you still have a
chance of taking it down.

Intercepted targets will not go away.  You can keep a terror site
"open" by keeping it targetted by a craft continuously.

Since the best weapons have a chance of blowing a smaller USO totally
to pieces, you may want to keep one fighter armed weaker than the rest
for intercepting smaller USOs.  (Assuming that you even WANT to go
after small USOs)


     2.3 Finding Alien Colonies

XCOM agents have a chance of finding an alien colony for you, but
chances are pretty slim. So do not rely on that. Usually the game will
reveal an alien colony only if you did VERY VERY BAD that month.

Watch for high alien activity (check the graphs) yet no interception:
there's probably an alien colony in the area. Note: alien colonies can
be VERY CLOSE to each other, which should be a bug.

Send something slow like a Triton to patrol the area. An empty Triton
has pretty good range and therefore is good in spotting alien bases.

Watch USOs, esp.  where they land. Trail it and follow it to their
base. After it lands, patrol nearby and you should see the alien
colony. If there are multiple subs landing of appearing at the same
locations, there is probably a base nearby.

Transmission Resolvers can find USOs on supply runs. Follow that will
usually lead you to a base.

Of course, you do NOT have to take out that colony... You go after the
supply subs instead. Just be careful... Some USOs have firing ports!
One Disruptor pulse and...


     2.4 GeoScape Tricks and Tips

Many people don't realize that click on the USO's icon will bring up
all known info about the USO, even crashed ones. If you detected it
via Transmission Resolver, you'll know A LOT about it.


USO crash sites usually disappear in a few days. If you have no
soldiers available, you can let it sit for a day or two.

Landed subs will take off in a few hours (less than a day).

Terror Sites disappear in less than a day (which mean you have to get
to one ASAP, even if it means skipping subs and landing at night! )

You can keep terror sites on the map if you can keep it targetted by a
craft, any craft.  If you have several Tritons, you can probably keep
it targetted almost indefinitely, and it will not disappear!

There appears to be a bug that if you went into a non-terror battle
while the terror site is on the map, when you come back from battle
the terror site will have disappeared. This is unconfirmed.

This is even more important now that your transport subs cannot go on
more than one mission at a time. After a Battlescape mission, they
MUST return to base.

Check your graphs regularly to determine where to build your next
base. Watch for high-paying sponsors with high alien activity, then
check how much did they pay you via the Funding screen and see if they
are worth defending.

Areas with high alien activity activity probably have an alien colony.


     2.5 How do I win? How do I lose?

You win by finding the sources of the alien threat and "deal with it"
once and for all... For some ideas... See H. P.  Lovecraft's works.

You can lose by several ways (unconfirmed, guesstimated from XCOM):

     1)   You were in debt for over $1,000,000 for two months. Your    
     sponsors had had enough of your mismanagement and terminated the
     XCOM project. Earth was conquered by aliens not long after.

     2)   You had two consecutive "badly losing" months (big negative
     score), and your sponsors had had enough and terminated XCOM
     project. Just how bad is a "badly losing" month depends on your
     score and difficulty level

     3)   You lost all of your bases to the aliens.

     4)   You lost a certain number of sponsor to alien infiltration.
     (not sure of exact number, maybe all? All but one?  Two?)

     2.6 How is scoring calculated?

Like XCOM, score is kept for both sides. You get positive score for
conducting successful research, capturing and/or killing aliens,
grounding and/or destroying USOs, destroying alien bases, grabbing
alien equipment, and more.  You get negative score for losing XCOM
aquanauts, crafts, SWS, and civilians.

Aliens score points by overflying your sponsors, lands in the oceans
(for whatever sinister purpose that they may have), conduct terror
raids and hoping that you ignore it (so NEVER do so since this REALLY
scores big for them! ), sign pact with funding alliances (which means
those countries don't pay you any longer! )

Your net score is (your_score - alien_score), which is the score you
see on the monthly performance report (and the graph).  The funding
changes are affected by your total score.




3.0 INTERCEPTING USOS

Don't forget to check section 4 for info on XCOM crafts. Some of these
hints and related hints are also listed in Section 2.


     3.1 Tracking USOs

Remember that USOs have specific targets and they do NOT change
missions in mid-air.  They also head STRAIGHT for their targets on the
inbound leg.  If you see an USO and lost tracking, try to extrapolate
its course and send interceptors to their estimated NEXT location
instead of going toward the last known location.

Interestingly, they sometimes abort their mission (just leave), esp.
in cases where they can't find your base to attack.  If you have
Transmission Resolver, you can see USO's destination directly as it
comes into range.


     3.2 Target Selection

If several targets presents itself, which one should you attack?  Here
are some of my general guidelines:


     3.2.1 USOs in flight

Attack the biggest subs you can handle.




Launch from the closest base FROM USO'S INTENDED TARGET if it is known
or can be deduced from its path.  Launching from the closest base at
the time of contact will result in a tail chase, resulting frequently
in lost tracking and waste of fuel and time.

If the landing site is on the dark side (i.e. night), you may want to
patrol nearby and wait for light. Of course, in the meanwhile the
landed USO may take off again.

Keep a fighter sub on top of a landed USO in case it takes off before
your transport sub can get to it.


     3.2.2 Downed/Landed USOs

Attack the biggest USO you can handle. (How many times did I say
that?)

Larger subs have more aliens and more artifacts to recover, so risk
and reward are proportional.

If you have a choice, attack a landed USO instead of a shot-down USO.
Landed subs are undamaged and therefore have more artifacts (plus
Zrbite). Of course, it also has more enemies.

Some veterans have reported that they can finish game faster by
attacking landed subs only. While score may not be as spectacular,
they also have less risk of retaliation and can get more research done
and have more money (from the extra booty). Of course, land combat is
significantly harder...

Don't follow an USOs around with a loaded transport (with soldiers and
equipment). They are wasting fuel and time and they may not have
enough endurance to finish the race and not able to respond to a
different emergency (such as a terror site suddenly popping up
elsewhere)

This is ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT since transports now can go on ONLY ONE
MISSION at a time, even though it has plenty of fuel remaining. It
MUST return to base after mission.


     3.2.3 Terror sites

Attack one ASAP, no exceptions. Divert from other subs or base attacks
if necesary, and definitely attack at night.  The penalty for ignoring
a terror site is simply too large to ignore, and can cause loss of
sponsors.

Some terror sites are now "long missions" (two-parter), so take along
LOTS of reloads... Or grab every alien ammo you can. (One more reason
to research fast and furious)




A terror site will NOT disappear if you have a ship enroute to it.
I've been told by reliable source (Jeff, that is) that he was able to
keep a terror site on the map for three days until he got bored by
keep targetting it with Tritons.  :-)


     3.2.4 Alien colonies

Depending on your soldiers, you should attack an alien colony as soon
as you are able to (don't take rookies) or people have low MC ability
or bravery.

You may want to consider leaving an alien colony alone nearby so you
can keep attacking the supply subs that drops by. Just make sure you
can handle the alien retaliation.

On the other hand...  Aliens build colonies like CRAZY in XCOM2. They
build MORE THAN ONE PER MONTH, almost geometric growth!  You have to
take out a few or else...  (I've got a saved game where there's OVER
TWENTY alien colonies on the map, and I kill at least two a month...)

Alien colonies are A LOT TOUGHER in XCOM2. It's a "two-parter",
meaning you have to fight your way INTO the base, then fight to
destroy the heart of the base. You'll see LOTS of enemies, including
the really deadly ones.  Take no mercy... No stun weapons, at least in
first half.

See 11.2 Colony assaults for more information.


     3.3 USO Attack methods

Once you got a fighter sub in range of the USO, it's time to attack.
Here's what different attacks mean:

Cautious Attack: causes least damage per attack but remains at the
longest range and therefore has the least chance of getting counter-
attacked.

Cautious attack is useful when you want a not too badly damaged USO
(just enough to "sink" it).

Normal Attack: average damage per attack, enough for most attacks if
your weapon outranges the USOs.

Normal attack is useful as a general purpose attack.

Aggressive Attack: close to point-blank and let them have it in the
face! Causes the most damage per attack, but exposes craft to counter-
fire.


Aggressive attack is good for brave/suicidal charges (toward an alien
battleship or dreadnaught, for instance).  You want maximum amount of
damage done in the short time the fighter sub may live under fire, so
aggressive it is.


     3.4 Weapons

Replace Ajax and Gas Cannon with D.U.P. launchers ASAP. Gauss cannons
are okay but I would go for Sonic Oscillators (equivalent to Plasma
Cannon in XCOM, though far less accurate)

I would not really recommend PWT launchers, since, like Fusion Ball
Launchers of XCOM, they don't cause enough "total" damage.


     3.5 Go Home Early

When you send multiple crafts after one subs and the subs gets shot
down, the shooter will go home, but other crafts will continue onto
the crash site and THEN return. Instead, click on them and turn them
back early (Return to base). They will return earlier, thus be
refueled and rearmed faster for the next mission.


     3.6 Keep Landed USOs covered

Even if subs has landed, keep a fighter sub on top of it until your
landing craft arrives for the action. That way, if the USO takes off,
you still have a chance to shoot it down.


     3.7 Weapon vs subs analysis

Before attacking, click on the VIEW subs button to take a look at your
target before deciding whether to attack or not. Attacking with wrong
weapons means either the loss of your fighter sub or the USO totally
destroyed so that nothing can be recovered.

For this reason, if you WANT to go after the smaller USOs, keep a
fighter around with "wimpy" weapons.


4.0 FINANCE


     4.1 What really eats up money at XCOM?

The answer is: maintenence, and salary. If you have 100 scientists,
their monthly salary is $3 million (!). Add that to your bases (the
BARE MINIMUM sonar base costs over $1 million a month to maintain!),
and you will go broke pretty quick. Sponsors' money will barely make a
dent in your expenses, as they only pay you a few million, probably
not even enough for base maintainence.

Remember that expenses are deducted all at the end of the month.  So
if you don't have enough money in the bank for monthly maintainence,
you will end the month with a NEGATIVE balance, and two months like
that will result in your DISMISSAL as XCOM supreme commander!


     4.2 How do I earn more money?

Three (real) ways to make money in XCOM:

Make your sponsors happy, so they will increase their payments. The
problem is: they don't pay much to start with, and the increase is
just enough to sneeze at. Their payments may be enough to buy some
ammo and stuff, but don't expect much of an increase.

Manufacture arms for sale -- See 4.4 What do I manufacture to make
more money?  As in XCOM, the equivalent of Laser Cannon, Craft Gauss
Cannon, takes the top prize as the top TFTD moneymaker.

Sell captured/surplus equipment--most of your money will be made this
way. Dump off all your obsolete equipment (harpoons rifles, etc) and
surplus and you will get LOTS of money. You will usually end with with
plenty of surplus sonic cannons, etc., and those fetch very good
prices on the market. :-)  Doing this also means you need less storage
space (and less maintainence) and more "real" weapons on base defense
(due to the 80 item limit).  Keep only one item of each type for
research, sell the rest.  You need the money and the space for more
useful stuff.

Trick: once the research has started on the item, you can sell the
item for more money.

As a last resort, you can always cheat. See the last section for how.


     4.3 How do I cut expenses?

     *    Cut Maintenence--dismantle any unused facility.
          Transmission resolver SHOULD detect 100% of UFOs in range,
          so get rid of all sonars once you have one. Also, you don't
          EVER need more than one Alien Containment module.


     *    Build your own crafts--Tritons and Barracudas have a 
          monthly rental fee, your own crafts do not. Of course, this 
          means you have to research subs construction and things.

     *    Minimize salary--use the salary transfer trick! (see 4.5)          


     4.4 What do I manufacture to make more money?

TOP SECRET -- XCOM2 Profitability study -- TOP SECRET

by Kasey Chang   original (XCOM1 version) by Jeff Shaffer

We assume that you, as XCOM supreme commander, are willing to support
technicians long-term in order to make a profit. I calculated results
for a hypothetical 2 workshop operation.  You would get slightly
better results with larger facilities, due to the economy of scale.

Technician actually costs $25000 a month, and scientist $30000 a
month. Check your base information screen.

The "Unit Profit" column is sale price minus cost, minus the cost of
any Zrbite/Aqua plastic used in manufacture. A '-' means a net loss,
no further analysis. Of course, Zrbite is of alien manufacture and can
be hard to find...

"Monthly Profit" column is based on an "XCOM Month" of 24*31 = 744
hours.  The calculation is number of technicians that fit in two
workshops times 744 times unit profit, divided by the hours required
to make one item. For example, the monthly profit for Motion Scanners
is 96*744*11600/220 = 1275993 (1275K).

Of course, that is not quite accurate since TFTD does do months more
correctly now (Feb has 28 days, etc.)

"Net Profit" column is the bottom line. Monthly expenses are the
salaries of as many engineers as fit in the workshops times $25K, plus
the maintenance on 2 workshops and 2 living quarters (70000 monthly).

As you can see, Gauss Craft Cannon is the winner, closely edging out
PWT Launcher. A profit can be made early in the game on particle
displacement sensors, however.

One final note:It costs roughly $7M to hire engineers and build the
facilities, so you'll need to "borrow" some money (preferably from
alien supply ships :) to get started.

[Editor's note: don't forget the "transfer salary trick" below]


     4.5 The "Transfer Salary Savings" trick

Have two bases approximately equivalent to each other, like both
research (or manufacturing), about same living quarters, and
scientists (or engineers). Just before end of the month (last day,
last hour), transfer ALL of the scientists (engineers) to the other
base, and do the same on the other base (i. e.  they swap their
contingent). When the end of month comes along, NEITHER side has their
scientists (engineers) (they are in transit), no salary is paid. If
you have like 100 scientists moving each way, you save $30,000x100x2 =
$6 million!

Of course, you don't get to "keep' the research, but that's nothing
compared to the money you saved.  :-)

     4.6 Aliens signed pact with XXX!

Nothing you can do. One of the Infiltration subs got through and now
the sponsor stopped paying you.  Consensus on the net is you canNOT
get them back (i.e. nullify the pact). And if enough sponsors left
you, you lost.




5.0 RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURING

All information here is subjective change due to a patch that should
be released sometime in the beginning of June from MicroProse.  Some
of the research trees are VERY STRICT (and have "holes").  Even though
pre-requisites are present, because they're not in the right order,
necesary things cannot be researched.  The patch is supposed to fix
that, we'll see.


     5.1 What should I start researching first?

I recommend all gauss weapons for the starting projects.  Dart pistols
and Jet Harpoons are pitiful against Sonic Blasta Rifles and Sonic
Pulsers (super grenade! ).  :-P

After that, research all dead bodies you can find.  As for later, you
need to capture aliens ASAP. Without captured aliens you would have
nothing to research, which is VERY BAD.

Capture would be hard since you don't have enough firepower...  Go for
kills until you nab a couple Thermal Shok Launchers and Thermal Shok
Bombs, and research them ASAP.


     5.2 Overall strategy

Keep roughly 100 scientists in your employment. You need that much
research to discover things in reasonable time, though you can
probably get by with 50-75.

Due to the way research works, concentrate on one project at a time so
you can start on later topics faster.

Research prisoners AND dead aliens ASAP. They now lead to other
technologies.  HOWEVER: DO NOT RESEARCH TASOTH COMMANDER.  According
to "FractalLaw", researching Tasoth Commander will result in NO
Leviathan, which means you will not be able to finish the game.


     5.3 Research Tree [probably incomplete]

These research trees are to the best of my knowledge. If you believe I
have made an error, please document YOUR sequence and and submit them
to me for review...

The "requirements" are more stringent in XCOM2 for researching items.
Often you must have items already present to be able research it when
a breakthrough is made.

This research tree format was supplied by Roy Indrebo of Norway.
Thanks Roy!

Tree Format:

Item1 ->
  Item2 / Item3->
    Item4
    Item5

Translation : Item1's successful research will lead to Item2 and Item3
to be available for research, and Item2 and Item3's successful
research will lead to Item4 and Item5 be available.  Item4 or Item5
cannot be researched until Item1, Item2, and Item3 are done.

Item5 (Item6) ->
  Item6 <Item7>

Translation : Item 5 and presence of item6 in base's stores will allow
item 6 to be researched, and allows <Item7> to be manufactured.  This
is important that if you do NOT have Item6, you will NOT get Item6 as
a possible choice, and this may be hard to "repeat" later.

Item7! -+
Item8  -+-->
  Item9

Translation : Item7 can only be captured, and with its own research
and Item8's research, means Item9 becomes available for research.

It is recommended that you follow the trees in EXACT sequence.  Some
of the prerequisites are not listed since it's obvious (like
Coelacanth/Gauss needs Gauss techs, Displacer Sonic needs Sonic techs,
etc.)

Gauss Weapons ->
  Gauss Pistol / Gauss Pistol Clip ->
    Gauss Rifle / Gauss Rifle Clip ->
      Heavy Gauss / Heavy Gauss Clip ->
        Craft Gauss Cannon / Craft Gauss Cannon Ammo ->
          Gauss Defense  (which later leads to Coelacanth/Gauss)


Sonic Pulser!-----------------------------------+
Sonic Pistol! / Sonic Pistol Clip!--------------+
Sonic Blasta Rifle! / Sonic Blasta Rifle Clip!--+
Sonic Cannon! / Sonic Cannon Clip!--------------+-->

Lobsterman Commander ->
  T'leth, the Alien City
  Latest Flying Sub <Leviathan, Bombardment Shield> =>>


Tasoth Commander ->
  T'Leth, the Alien City  (NO Latest Flying Sub!!!!!)


     5.4 Any hints on manufacturing?

Only manufacture thing that you REALLY need, like crafts, etc.  almost
NEVER manufacture ammo since most require Zrbite, which is always in
short supply.  Captured ammo is much cheaper and don't use your
precious Zrbite supply.

OTOH, Zrbite appears to be a bit more plentiful in XCOM2.. . So go
ahead and make 20 Thermal Shok Bombs for your raids...

NEVER let any engineers go idle. If you don't need anything built,
build something that makes money.

NOTE 1: you can get info on particular alien stats by using a M. C.
Reader on them. Leaders and commanders are 10 to 20% higher, and there
appears to be random modifiers, depending on rank and position.  Stats
are also higher on higher difficulty levels

NOTE 2: higher rank aliens also have higher "intelligence", which
means they will remember your location longer. Some alien species are
also more intelligent than others.

NOTE 3: Not all aliens have all positions.  Only Aquatoids appear to
have medics, for example.

     6.5 Battle Notes on individual aliens

Kill Tentaculats anywhere. Kill them ASAP, even if it means wiping out
any civilians near it. Use all heavy weapons on it freely. You can't
afford to see any Zombies.  (At least Zombies don't fly...)

If you are REALLY worried about Tentaculats (or don't want any one die
without making a kill), have everyone carry a PRIMED grenade around
(prime it first). If your soldier got turned into a zombie, or killed,
all equipment gets dropped, and the grenade should go BOOM at the end
of the turn.

Tentaculats CAN attack "floating" soldiers (via mag. ion armor).

Lobsterman are most vulnerable to sonic and AP weapons.  Best deal:
vibroblade and/or thermic lances.  Walk up behind it and Ziiiip!  No
more lobsterman!



7.0 SOLDIERS, EQUIPMENT, AND LIMITS

     7.1.1 Soldier Statistics

We recommend that instead of using the default names, you adopt a
naming system for your soldiers that will help you to know at a glance
who to take on a mission.

System One reflects a trained specialty, such as scout (SC), heavy
weapons (HW), demolitions (DM), MC combat (MC), sharpshooter (SS),
etc. For example, "Steve Rogers HW/MC" has lots of strength and nice
time units for carrying the heavy weapons (and shooting them). His
MCStr and MCSkl is also pretty high so he also carries a MCAmp for MC
combat.

     Here's some suggested specialties

Scout               (SC)    carry particle displacement sensor
Medic               (MD)    carry MediKit
Sharpshooter        (SS)    shooter, carry nice guns
Intelligence        (IT)    carry MC Reader
Heavy Weapons       (HW)    carry "heavy" stuff
Molecular Control   (MC)    carry MC Disruptor

You can also cross-train, of course. There's no limit in the number of
spots each person can hold... And real-life SEAL teams are all cross-
trained any way.

System Two just places the numbers in the name. Use just the first
digit (if rating is 42, just use 4)

To change the name, go to the soldiers screen (the one base display)
that displays their stats. Click on their name, and a cursor comes up,
allowing you to change them.

System Three, inlcudes a letter for the area the soldieris good in,
like A)ccuracy, T)Us, etc.


     7.1.2 Recruiting Aquanauts

Sack weaklings ASAP. You want high strength, reaction, bravery, and
shooting accuracy, and when you get MC, MC ability.  So recruit lots
of rookies, use them for scouts (they are cheap when compared to
SWSs). If they survive, keep them, else, oh, well, they've done the
world a great service. :-)

Why those traits? High strength means they can carry more (and
heavier) stuff. High reaction means they can get opportunity fire
(reaction shots) while enemy is moving.


High bravery means they are less susceptible to panic, and shooting
accuracy is obvious. :-)Other characteristics are not as important.

Aquanauts only get promoted if there are enough of them to warrant a
promotion. So hire a lot of seamen, send them out to missions.  The
ones that survive are able seaman, and when you have enough able
seamen, you have officers.  Feel free to sack the bad able seamen
later to save on salary.


     7.1.3 How do I improve stats of soldiers?

Try to always take a couple of rookies along to give them experience
to boost their stats. In XCOM, you learn by doing.  Below are
activities that will improve traits:

Time Units             Kills
Strength               Carry heavy stuff
Energy                 Kills
Throwing Accuracy      Throw more!
Firing Accuracy        Shoot more!
Bravery                get panicked more
Health                 Kills
Reactions              Make more reaction shots
MC Ability             fixed
MC Skills              use more MC


Soldiers with kills gain more than those without kills.

     7.1.4 Dividing up specialties

Assuming 10 soldiers and 1 SWS (normal for a Triton) you should have
the following:

2 medics/pack mule (carry medikit + reloads + grenades)

2 grenadiers (pistol and lots of grenades) + MC stuff

2 rifleman (rifles, maybe heavy)

2 heavy weapons (heavy stuff, including disrupt pulse)

2 scout (high TUs + react, carry grenade and pistols)

If you decide to go to 14 soldiers, add two more rifleman and 2 more
grenadier/MC weapons.






     7.1.5 How do I get more officers?

Ensigns come from able seamen, and able seamen come from Seamen who
survived a mission and gotten at least one kill. For exact numbers,
see the manual.


     7.2 Packing Advice

The 80-item limit is always a problem, especially on an Hammerhead and
Leviathan, when you can carry LOTS of soldiers. Here's a couple more
hints to see you through the 80-item Crunch:

     - If you are short on ammo clips, use sonic weapons, which use
     less ammo.

     - Carry only ONE clip for your sonic weapons. You should be able
     to find plenty of reloads during battle, esp. for Sonic Cannon
     (which seems to be used by all aliens near the end of the game)

     - Bring less misc. equipment such as MC Readers, medikits,
     particle displacement sensors, M.C. Disruptors, and so on.  You
     don't need everything on every person (except maybe Medikits)

     - Bring SWSs if you can. SWS is one item yet has plenty of          
     firepower.  Too bad it takes FOUR soldier's space. Still, they
     are quite useful in the early parts of the game

     - Don't fight at night so that you need to take along all those
     stupid chemical falres which you end up throwing all over the
     place.  (exception: Attack Terror Sites ASAP)  Of course, you can
     always pick up those flares again.


     7.3 Basic Loadout for Transports


Triton : 1 SWS / 10 aquanauts or 14 aquanauts. The SWSs early on carry
more firepower and has more TUs than soldiers, which makes them good
scouts, and more survivable. Switch to only soldiers later.

Hammerhead : as many soldiers as you can fit.  Hammerhead doesn't take
SWSs, too bad.

Leviathan : 14 soldiers / 3 SWSs or 18 soldiers / 2 SWSs

As the end of game draws near, your best soldiers should be as fast as
SWSs and carries just as much (if not more) firepower.  SWSs are there
to simply scout ahead, esp. the PWT and/or Sonic versions (one each).
Feel free to add more soldiers if you can distribute 80 items okay.



8.0 GROUND WEAPONS


     8.1 General Weapon Notes

With smaller magazines in XCOM2 (10-15), ammo and reloads are becoming
a problem, esp with Gauss weapons and dart/harpoon weapons, which may
have auto-fire mode.  Therefore, watch your ammo load carefully.

Sonic weapons are less of a problem since they do NOT have auto-mode
and you can usually find reloads easily. Gauss reloads must be
manufactured.

Use SWSs (or rookies?) to "beat the bush" and spot enemies, then shoot
them. Once an alien is found, everybody can take a shot.

If you can, take a aimmed shot. "One shot, one kill" is not a bad
motto. On the other hand...  If you have the ammo, use auto shot
whenever you can.  Why? It ensures a kill. Let me explain:

Auto shot fires three rounds, but is the least accurate of the three
shots. On the other hand, when you use the laws of probability, you
actually come out ahead using an auto-shot, since each shot is
calculated independently.  For example, let's say chance of hitting in
auto shot is 25%, and snap shot is 30% (average). The chance of
getting at least one hit out of three is

     1-(chance of no hits)

So 25% hit prob AND no hit in three tries is

     0.75 * 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.42

Chance of getting at least one hit is then

     1 - 0.42 = 0.56, or 56%       

Which is much better than 30% (but no higher than the aimed
percentage). When your accuracy improves, you increase your chances of
hitting the target multiple times, which ensures a kill, and you use
less TUs than ONE aimmed shot.

It is not unknown to see three aliens line up in a row, you fired
auto, and each shot killed one alien.


     8.2 The Great Pistol vs Rifle debate

          Pro                Con
Rifles    more powerful      use more TUs
          more accurate      two-handed weapon
Pistols   uses less Tus      less powerful
          one handed weapon  less accurate


Give pistols to heavy weapons people for when they ran out.   
Panic has a much better chance of success than control.

M.C. strength is more important than M.C. skill.  M.C. ability
determines resistance to M.C. attacks as well as potential with
training



10.0 GROUND ASSAULTS


     10.1 General Combat Notes

There is no penalty for destroying civilian property, so go ahead and
wreck the whole place like "The Dirty Pair" (anime).  If the only
person inside the craft is unconscious and you abort mission, s/he's
MIA and the transport is lost as well.

In the early game, you want gas cannon and/or Hydrojet cannon as your
heavy weapons, and plenty of greandes (mix of regular and proximity).

Later in the game, you want almost exclusively heavy sonic (except for
the heavy weapons people carrying disruptor pulse launchers, who would
carry sonic pistols)


     10.2 Capturing Aliens


     10.2.1 How to I capture an alien?

You can capture aliens in three ways, so let's discuss advantages and
disadvantages.

Shoot an alien and hope it drops stunned instead of dead: Since smoke
inhalation produce stun damage, if alien had inhaled smoke for a
while, and you shot it later, it may drop stunned. This is too much of
a guess work though, and is dangerous if alien is armed. On the other
hand, Lobsterman, having so much health, does this a lot.

Use thermal tazer on the alien:Dangerous since thermal tazer is a
hand-to-hand weapon, but it's all you have early on.  Remember to
stand RIGHT NEXT to the target, and DIRECTLY FACING the target, or you
cannot stun!  Dangerous, of course, but Lobsterman are pretty dumb, so
if you double-team, you can probably stun it before it realizes that
you're next to it.

Use thermal shok bombs and launcher: safest way to capture an alien,
shoot and scoot. Still double/triple team to be sure though...

[Has any one been able to stun an alien with dye grenades yet? I can't
do it so far... ]


     10.2.2 So what's your recommendation?

Several ways to make captures safer:

Double/triple-team on capture: at least two soldiers should carry
thermal shok bombs/launcher and ready to fire in salvoes in case the
alien does not drop after one hit.
Combine MC combat with capture: panic it with MC to make it drop its
weapon (repeat if necesary), then stun it. Be careful since alien WILL
pull out any other weapon that it has on it, including GRENADES. After
it is out of weapons, and if it does not have HTH attack, you can use
thermal tazer on it safely.

         10.3.1 SWS usage

SWSs should be used for "beating the bush" and flush aliens out for
soldiers to shoot. Since Aqua Jet Torpedoes only work underwater, the
early preference is Coelacanth/Gas Cannon. Later, use
Coelacanth/Gauss, and later Displacer/Sonic.


     10.3.2 Grenade usage

Grenades should be used for firepower supplement. If you suspect an
alien in the area, drop a grenade in the area.  Since you can throw
beyond your visible area, this can REALLY raise your survival rates.

This is important if you see aliens toss grenades or take shots at you
but you don't see them. Toss a grenade in the area, and see if you
hear screams. If not, send an SWS slowly into the area.

Rookies can be effective grenadiers since grenades are area weapons
and grenades don't miss by very far. Of course, make sure their MC
Ability and/or bravery is high, or...

Magna-Pack Explosive is just a very heavy grenade, and you will have
problems tossing it. Toss it a short distance or drop it on ground,
then RUN away from the area. This would mean you need to set it for
multiple turns.

Particle Displacement grenades are great for traps. Use them to
prevent aliens coming up behind you, and/or pin aliens (toss one on
either side of it and it can't move without setting one off)Just
remember where you threw them (check the map) and don't walk near them
yourself.

Par. Dis. Grenades cannot be "destroyed" now.  Many have tried to set
one off by dropping grenades on top of it, but the safest way is to
save the game, and reload it.

All ParDis Grenades will be primed but will NOT explode when you walk
up to them. (This is better than XCOM1, when all Prox. Grenades
disappear after saved game)

You can toss grenades to upper levels and through windows, though you
may have to kneel down to do it, and it requires a bit of extra
"height" available.

Sonic pulsers can punch holes in some USO halls, so save disruptor
pulses for other uses.

This of course, means that your transports can be hit by aliens, and
if a grenade explodes OUTSIDE, aquanauts INSIDE can be killed.
     
     10.4.2 Use the terrain!

You can use the terrain in other ways than just hiding behind
something.

Use secondary explosions to your advantage! If alien is standing next
to volatile object like fuel drums, blow THAT up!

Aliens DO shoot through each other, so if you have NOWHERE to hide,
hide BEHIND an alien and pray. (It was reported that one alien shot
itself when attempting to shoot down the gravlift)

Kneel whenever possible. It increases your accuracy and decreases the
enemy's (make you a smaller target)

WARNING: you may have to kneel down to look through windows.  Be
careful as you "clear" buildings or your aquanauts will get shot in
the back.

Always hide behind something; it could mean the difference between a
wound vs. death! Of course, that also means that you have to have
enough Tus, which is related to snap shots vs aimmed shots and pistols
vs. rifles.

If you have magnetic ion armor, do not stay off floor unless you have
something to hide behind also.

     10.4.5 Spread out and cover each other

Bunch up invites enemy attack you with sonic pulsers, or worse,
disruptor bolts. Stay AT LEAST eight squares apart. Sonic pulsers
(alien grenades) are now HE damage of 120, 33% more powerful than
alien grenades in XCOM1.. .  Which means ONE grenade can kill LOTS
more soldiers...  Same goes for Disruptor pulse torpedoes

12.0 MISC QUESTIONS AND THEIR ANSWERS


     Equipment
     - Why do I lose ammo that was fired only a few times?          

       After combat all clips that had been USED in the battle and
       left in their weapons are lost, no matter only 1 round fired
       or totally empty. UNUSED clips are NOT affected as are clips
       separate from weapons.

       HINT: You should unload any weapons that had fired and use
       valuable ammo before the battle ends.

       HINT: You can get MORE clips if you unload captured alien
       weapons that you come across

     - Why should I need grenades when I have heavy weapons?          

       Heavy weapons such sonic cannon, hydrojet cannon, and gas
       cannon weigh A LOT. For the same weight you can carry a
       lighter weapon plus a couple grenades, and move faster and
       further as a result.

     - How do I wake up unconscious soldiers?
       See UFOpedia on Medikit.

       HINT: Heal any fatal wounds first before attempt to revive.

       HINT: After applying shot of stimulant, exit medikit screen
       and check your inventory. If "body" is still on ground, apply
       another shot of stimulant until the "body" is no longer on
       ground.  S/he should appear in an adjacent square. You may
       need LOTS of stimulant shots to revive a stunned soldier.

       HINT: Stimulant also raises ENERGY. If you had soldiers
       running all across battlescape, add some stimulant if they
       can't move.

     - How do I use particle displacement sensor?          

       See UFOpedia

       HINT: They are useful to detect that one last alien you can't
       find, esp. at night when visibility is less, or city blocks
       (but there you have civilians)

       HINT: They are somewhat useful for looking behind closed doors
       that you would like to enter.

    
     Movement

     - Some of my soldiers have TU's used before I moved them. Why?

       Each soldier has a physical weight limit to the amount of
       "stuff" he or she can carry, usually known as "encumberance".
       If you carry less than or equal to the encumberance, no
       penalty is assessed. For each weight unit over the limit, you
       get a TU penalty. Carry too much and you can't move at all!

       I haven't found the weight table yet, but I expect to soon.

     - How can I fire on aliens in their movement phase?

       This is called "opportunity fire".  Leave enough TU's after
       your move for at least a snap shot, then if your trooper saw
       an alien and has good enough reactions s/he will fire at the
       alien.

       HINT: Use the 4 icons near the bottom left of screen to
       reservethe TUs.  Reactions usually need to be above 50.

     - How do I open doors?

       Target your soldier to move up to the door. Turn to face the
       door (right click behind door), then right click one more
       time.

       HINT: Do not open doors without plenty of spare TU's or expect
       to DIE. Using a motion scanner will help to see if any aliens
       moved beyond the door.

       HINT: When you are not sure, create another door! Either shoot
       a hole in the wall or blow up the entire wall with sonic
       pulser, HE, Sonic Cannon, or Disruptor Pulse.


     Molecular Control Combat

     - How do I get Molecular Control?

       See 9.0 Molecular Control Combat            

     - What is MC ability and MC skill?          

       MC ability is a person's physical talent for MC and cannot be
       improved. It is also a measure of resistance against enemy MC
       attacks.

       MC skill is a person's skill at USING the MC ability. It can
       be improved with usage (so use it!) and training at a MC lab.

     - Help!  My soldiers kept getting MC blasted!          

       Fight harder, make more kills, don't get killed. Low morale
       invites more MC attacks.

       If you survive the fight, sack the ones who's not very good
       and kept getting panicked or controlled.

       Sack newbies with low bravery (i.e. below 40). Screen your
       recruits carefully.

       After you get M.C.Lab, sack everyone who has MC Ability of
       less than, say, 60. Those have 80+ will be your MC
       specialists. Players have reported of being MC-proof with MC
       Ability >70.

       Those getting kills will improve more than those who did not.

       Therefore, try not to let SWS get a kill since you will lose a
       chance to let a soldier improve, and leave the easy shots
       (against panicked aliens, for example) to the rookies. MC
       skill also improves with use. (MC Str does not increase
       though)

       Chemical Flare

       -  Chuck one inside the building through a window to 
       see inside. You may have to kneel to angle one in.

       -  Carry one for each soldier for "night" underwater 
       fights. Visibility underwater is horrible.

       -  You can pick up an existing flare and throw it 
       again.            

       Medikit

       -  Heal fatal wounds first, worry about unconscious and 
       morale later. If necesary, use TWO people's medikits.

       -  To revive a person, keep administering stimulant until 
       s/he no longer shows up on the ground in the inventory 
       screen. Should appear immediately at an adjacent square.

       -  Stimulant also raises energy.  So if you marched an 
       aquanaut all across the map, add some stimulant or they
       won't walk very far...

       Particle Displacement Sensor

       -  Use this to look around corners and behind doors.            

       -  Aliens hardly ever stay still between rounds.            

       Molecular Control Reader

       -  Usually you would use this to ID a target for capture but
       here's a trick that you can use if you do NOT have one: try to
       pick up the unconscious alien on the ground will also identify
       alien's rank and position.


Here's the comprehensive list of all the toys you get to play with.
Of course, most of them requires research.

(1) In a workshop, the object being manufactured takes up some space.
So you will not be able to cram all 50 technicians in there.

(2) For exact composition, see base information / stores

NOTE 1: Defenses are noticeably cheaper to build in XCOM2

NOTE 2: You can dismantle a facility, even when it is under
construction.  Simply click on the facility, and the program will ask
you do you wish to dismantle it, select OK

NOTE 3: To dismantle a base, you must remove all facilities
(transferring all people and equipment elsewhere if needed) then
finally remove the airlock itself.

*    Weapon Range should be divided by 8 for range in KM, see 7.5

?    Range in kilometers are estimated based on XCOM1 data, not
confirmed. Please let me know if this is not correct!

** Maximum crew is absolute maximum reported in one mission.  Number
is in format of X/Y (Z) where X is host race (race the subs belongs
to), Y as terrorists and Z as number of leaders (L) or commander in
the host race. Any 4-space creatures counts as 4 aliens for this.
