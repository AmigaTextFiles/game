     This is a simple informational guide for Parappa the Rapper (music/ 
rhythm game for Sony Playstation).  Along with some general comments and 
suggestions, I'll be listing some patterns to help get you up to the Cool 
rating, and some patterns to use in order to keep your Cool...

3. Info on "Cool" and the "hidden level" (SPOILER ALERT)

     The first time you play a level, the highest rating you'll be able to 
achieve is "Good".  However, after you've successfully completed a level, 
you can go back and play it again (via Stage Select in the Options menu), 
and now you'll be able to achieve "Cool" (which, btw, is more difficult 
than simply maintaining "Good"; "Cool" is, after all, the highest rating 
in the game... =) ).  Achieving "Cool" will change the stage scenery (or 
at least the visual context), and the instructor for that level will 
withdraw (after saying a few words of praise), allowing you to rap 
freely.  And so long as you don't rap badly, you'll be able to continue 
with your "Cool" rating.  If you finish a level on "Cool", you'll get a 
crown marker for that level on the Stage Select screen.

         ** SPOILER ALERT **

     Getting all six crowns will enable an extra stage (of sorts) called 
"KT & the Sunny Funny Band" (name parody of "KC & the Sunshine Band", btw), which will 
appear on the Stage Select screen.  Basically, it's just Katy and Sunny 
dancing to some music, on a little circular stage, in front of an 
audience.  You can change their costumes (3 costumes each; triangle 
(Sunny) or X (Katy) button), change their dance style (6 styles each; 
square (Sunny) or O (Katy) button), zoom in and out (R1/R2 and L1/L2), and 
move the camera angle around (d-pad).  Nothing too spectacular, but kinda 
cute, nevertheless.

@node "4" "General tips and comments, and a note on beat count"
4. General tips and comments, and a note on beat count

     If you play the game as a simple "repeat verbatim" game (the "Simon 
Says" style), you'll probably notice that the game starts getting a lot 
stricter with timing starting with Stage 4 (cooking).  So once you figure 
out the precise timing point(s) the game looks for (pay more attention to 
the timing bar than the actual music), you can probably make your way 
through all the rest of the game.  Of course, I think it's much more fun 
to embellish upon the themes and patterns presented... and as an added 
bonus, if you embellish well, the game seems to be a lot more lenient with 
your exact timing.  =)
     Anyway, one very simple pattern which seems to work fairly well is 
just to follow the beat-count pattern (or half-beat count, if you count 
each star on the bar as one beat (4 beats per line)) through the entire 
line.  So instead of trying to follow the non-standard beat given, you can 
stick with something a lot easier to do!  Of course, this doesn't work on 
every line, but it does make a lot easier the lines it does work on...
     Here are the four-beat and eight-beat counts, btw, in case you're not 
quite sure what I'm talking about here:

       four-beat count:   1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . .
       eight-beat count:  1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6 . 7 . 8 .

     The timing bar in the game uses a four-beat line (each of the stars 
on the line counts as a beat; ignore the two dots before the first star, 
since they don't really count as part of any beat (they're actually a 
redundancy of the latter half of the last beat of the previous line...)), 
but since I think a lot of people might find an eight-beat line a bit more 
intuitive, I'm going to use that for the patterns I present in this 
file...
     So anyhow, getting back to the pattern I mentioned above, it would 
go: "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight" for the eight-beat 
count, and "one, and, two, and, three, and, four, and" for the four-beat 
count.  As I've already stated, it doesn't work for everything, but it 
does help on some of the more difficult lines in Stages 4, 5, and 6...
     Oh, one last thing I thought I'd mention here, since the instructions 
(U/C) weren't as specific as they could have been on the subject, was the 
effect holding Left or Right on the d-pad will have while rappin', and the 
specific difference between the two...  Holding Left will get Parappa to 
repeat the *first* word/segment of the phrase assigned to the button you 
press, whereas holding Right will get Parappa to repeat the last word/ 
segment he just completed with that button.  I think strategic use of this 
"repeat" function can have a bit of an impact on your score, but I haven't 
fully looked into the matter yet...  It's certainly not necessary in order 
to complete the game (even with Cool ratings), but I do think it makes 
some of the improv bits a bit more fun...

@node "5" "Second line Cool patterns"

5. Second line Cool patterns

     Okay, I'm listing some patterns here that I've gotten to work on the 
second line of each level, in getting me to Cool.  To get halfway to Cool, 
just do the first line normally (or embellish, if you want).  Obviously, 
these patterns aren't absolutely guaranteed to work, or anything.  They're 
just patterns that seem to work a good amount of the time for me.  Most of 
them seem to have a fairly good success rating... though I'm still looking 
for slightly better patterns for Stages 4 (cooking) and 5 (bathroom)...
     If any of these patterns give you trouble, just try slight variations 
on them.  Timing groups of clustered notes slightly closer (or slightly 
farther) sometimes works...
     Oh, one last note.  Do note that some of these patterns actually 
start *before* the "Given" line count ends...

@node "6" "In-Cool patterns"
6. In-Cool patterns

     Once you get to Cool, you can actually just use a repeating pattern 
to maintain your Cool rating (or you can free rap more creatively, which 
can be pretty fun).  Here are three patterns I've found to work fairly 
well in-Cool...

      bar:  *  .  .  .  *  .  .  .  *  .  .  .  *  .  .  .  
     beat:  1  .  2  .  3  .  4  .  5  .  6  .  7  .  8  .  
       do:  !     ! ! ! !     !     !     ! ! ! !     !     
       do:  !     !  !     !  !     !     !  !     !  !     
       do:  !     ! ! ! !     !  !     !  !     !           

     The first pattern is probably the easiest to do.  The third pattern 
seems to score the best (of the three listed above), though.  Or you can 
mix and match...
     Note that in some of the levels, some of the buttons will sometimes 
have multi-syllabic segments for a single button pressing... so if you're 
just going for a particular beat (like one of the ones listed above), you 
can use the "repeat" function (Left or Right on the d-pad; see section 3 
of this document for more information) to stay on a particular segment of 
the line (one with one (or two) syllables), to make things a little less 
confusing, so you can stay with the beat a bit more easily.  This also 
applies to the normal game (not just in-Cool), btw...
