 0.01: Initial release


    Hello! This is an FAQ designed to help non-Japanese players through
 this superb game. You will need a Japanese ascii viewer to display
 the Japanese characters : you can find one at (www.njstar.com).
 It comes with a handy Japanese-English translator, which is what
 I used to make most of this document.

    From version 0.15 on, I had to split the FAQ into two parts:
 the General FAQ (this part) and the Abilities List (the other
 part, generally fftabil.txt), because NJStar can only work with 
 files of less than 64K.

    I'm Spanish and my knowledge of English is not very high, so 
 apologies in advance for any grammatical and spelling errors you 
 may find in this document. Eugene, who made many of the ability
 translations (as well as the Chapter One's) is Chinese, so he 
 will be able to translate the meaning of the Kanji, but not
 the pronuntiation as it is different between Japanese and Chinese.
 As the pronuntiation of a Kanji is needed to write it down with
 a Japanese word processor, what this means is that we may not be able
 to transcribe some Kanji to the document, even knowing it's meaning.

    I will usually put four things in each translation:

 Japanese : The original Japanese name in Kana or Kanji (Japanese alphabets).
 Romanji : A phonetic translation of this name in Romanji (Roman alphabet).
 Translation : A literal translation, to the best of my ability.
 Effect : A translation of its effect.

    In many cases I will not be able to write down some or all of the
 Kanji in the ability's name. In these I will put a single question mark
 for each untranslated Kanji so you can match the lenght of the name
 and the relative position of each of the other Kanji.

 much automatic, as you can only control Ramza.

   ------                          --------------------------

    Explanation

    Lv and Exp are your general level and general experience points, 
 as opposed to job points and levels.
    HP, MP and CT are your Hit points (current/Maximum) Magic points and
 Charge Time. The last tells you how much time remains until that 
 character's next turn. 00 means he/she has just finished a turn and must
 wait one full round, and 100 that this is his/her active turn, unless 
 there are other characters who have 100 CT as well. The CT charge speed
 is determined by that of the character.
    O 01 : Here, the O is supposed to represent a colored ball that tells
 you which side is this unit on. Blue is your side, and red the enemies
 side. The number indicates the number of this unit on the current combat
 (not the turn order, just for reference purposes).
    Brave and Faith : These are characteristics that I suppose affect
 the reaction and power of the unit, but I don't know in which way
 exactly.

 | Speed ... 06   L...000 / 00%   (Rod)   04 / 00% / 03% / 00%  |
  --------------------------------------------------------------

    Explanation

    Move is the number of steps the unit can make in one turn.
    Jump is the maximum height the character can overcome when changing
 from one square to the other. I think this is the upward jump height
 but I don't know if this affects the downward jump (units can't jump
 down from too high places) or the horizontal height (units make this
 when jumping from one building to other, and in order to take shorcuts.
 I love the way the AI is implemented in this game :) ).
    Speed affects the CT recharging rate.
    Wep.Power shows the start for both arm's weapons. The left number is
 the weapon's attack power, but the right one is defined in the help option
 (and translated with some NJStar help) as "Evade Rate". I don't know if
 that means the chance of blocking an attack with that weapon,  or the
 chance the enemy has of evading that weapon's attack. The first one would
 make more sense as increases in this parameter when equipping new weapons
 are listed in blue (positive) and obviously you want to have a higher 
 chance of blocking an attack yourself.

    The next part shows your general attack power and evade rates, both
 physical and magical. The sword symbolyzes physical parameters, whereas 
 the rod means magic ones. As for the parameters themselves, they are:
 AT  : Attack power
 C-EV: Character's innate evasion chance
 S-EV: Shield block chance
 A-EV: Accesory evasion/block chance 

    I know it sound a bit strange listing all those evade rates 
 separately but I'm almost sure of all of them, except for the character
 one.
    Notice how there is no "defense power" stat anywhere. That's because
 this game hasn't one! The attacks and spells always do around the same 
 damage even to different enemies. If you notice, armors and helmets only
 raise your character's HPs (and MPs), and shields and accesories give
 you evade rates. It seems somewhat strange not having different defense 
 power and that, but I'm pretty sure that's the way it works.

    This section intends to explain the 3.1.2 menu (just above) 
 and give you an idea on how to use these abilities.

    The first step when learning new abilities is choosing a job for your
 character. Each character can change jobs at any time in the Abilities
 menu, as many times as he/she wishes, but he can only change to a job
 he has already received (more on this later). When you choose a job,
 you will notice that your character can equip different weapons and 
 armor than before. His/her Stats will also vary, and if you change from
 a Monk to a Black Magician you will notice a drop in his/her HP max level,
 as well as an increase in his/her MP max level. When you enter a combat 
 you may notice some other differences in his/her performance: namely,
 he will have a new command under "Fight".

    At first the character will not be very good in his/her new job. If
 you chose a Black Magician, he will not have any Black magic spells
 and so his/her Black Magic command will appear grayed and may not be
 selected. To make the most of his/her new job, you will want to learn
 abilities.

    As he/she fights and wins, he/she will gain, in addition to general
 Experience Points (used to raise his/her general level), Job Points
 (JPs from now on) for his/her current job. These have two meanings:
    First, pretty much like regular Exp, earning certain amounts of Jp 
 for a single job will raise that job's level for that character, giving
 him better characteristics. You don't have to accumulate Jps without
 using them, however, because for raising levels purposes all Jps 
 received so far are counted (both used and remaining).
    Second, you can use those Jps to learn or "purchase" new abilities.

    Perhaps the first type of abilities you should look for are 
 "Action abilities". These are marked by a Thunderbolt Arrow sign.
 This kind of abilities are the ones that can be used by means of that
 job's special command. In the above example, you could buy "Faia"
 and "Burizado" and your black mage would be able to cast them by
 selecting "Black Magic" from the action menu, then the spell you 
 want to cast. 
    The difference in Final Fantasy Tactics's system, however, is that
 it allows you to turn that Black Mage into a Knight, and keep the 
 ability to cast those spells. To do this, you just have to change 
 the job of that character, then use the first option in the abilities 
 menu to  "Set" the second Action Ability of him/her to "Black Magic" 
 (the second, because the first one would be "Sengi", the Knight's innate
 ability, and couldn't be changed). The new Knight would now be able
 to cast ALL the black magic spells he/she would have learnt (with the
 MPs and magic power of a Knight, though).

    So in short, you can use ALL the action abilities for the job you
 currently have (and that you have learnt), and ALL the action abilities
 of any other job you want.

    There are three other types of abilities besides Action. To
 see these abilities lists, you just have to press left/right when selecting 
 which ability you would like to learn. These types are:

    Reaction: Their symbol is a V-shaped arrow. These can be randomly 
 activated when the character is attacked, and are generally counterattacks
 of some type.
    Not all of them are activated by the same types of attacks, and 
 some are more general than others. The Itemshi's "Autopotion" 
 can activate anytime he/she loses HP, while the Thief's "catch" 
 can only be activated when a Ninja throws an item at him/her.

    Support: Represented by a loop arrow. These are "general" abilities 
 and are most varied in the ways they can be used. They may be 
 continuous or not, or even be activated by an additional command 
 (such as the Itemshi's "Change equipment"). 
    Note that some of these are inherent to its job and as such do 
 not require to be "equipped" or even "purchased" as long as you do 
 not change that character's job. The purpose of their existance is 
 to allow you to "export" them to other jobs.
 
    Movement: Represented by a foot. These are activated when the 
 character moves.

    These three types of abilities work in a somewhat different way than
 the Action ones. You must "Learn" ("purchase") and "Set" ("Equip") 
 them separately, and because there is just one slot for each of these 
 types, you can never have more than one of these active at any time. 
 (Excluding the current job's inherent support abilities).

    Sleep, Charm and Confuse status are cancelled by a physical hit.    

    Some notes about Sentouhunou : when a character loses all of his/her 
 HPs, a counter will appear above his/her head. It will usually start on 3
 but it may also begin with 2. Each full turn of combat, the counter
 will decrease one unit, and when it's on 0 and another turn passes, the
 character will die PERMANENTLY. So if you don't want to lose that 
 character, you better use a Fenix no O or Raise magic on him/her!

    There are two exceptions to this: Special characters (guest) are
 of vital importance for the plot and they never die (they have stars
 over their heads instead of a counter). Ramza, however, does have a
 counter and I supppose the game would be over if he dies.

    When a character dies, he/she will turn into a chest or a crystal.
 Chests usually contain and item that was worn by that character, and
 are generally left out by humans. Crystals may be of two colors: the blue
 one restore full HP/MP to the one that touches them, while yellow ones
 can be exchanged by the automatic learning of an ability or by full
 HP/MP recover as the blue ones. A menu with those options will pop up 
 when you touch them.

    A note from Eugene Shen:

    Alright, first things first...  The only part that I can both
accurately AND completely translate is the first Chapter...

  I currently can't supply you with any plot for Chapter 2 because it
was a little too confusing for me.  I'll have to wait until some
magazine starts to talk about it before I can tell you much.
However, I could give you an outline about some of the major things
that's happened.




¡ö £¸.£° ¡¾ £É£î£ô£ò£ï£ä£õ£ã£ô£é£ï£î  £â£ù  £Å£õ£ç£å£î£å  £Ó£è£å£î  ¡ö 



The story that we are playing is essentially a part of history called
the "Lions' War".  The Lions' War came a year after a war called
the "50 Years' War".  The 50 Years' War erupted because the former
king of this place died without specifying an heir.  As a result,
two lords in the country fought each other for 50 years until finally,
one side (your side, which is the one at the west) had a significant
advantage and the other side was forced to sign a peace treaty.  The
major contributor to this cause was, in fact Ramza's father (the one who
told Ramza the importance about integrity when he died).  Apparently,
after the Lions' War, Ramza's friend became heralded as a hero and
became king.  And Ramza?  Ramza is the real hero behind the scenes who
never left his name in history.  There are also some other details that
I left out in the first Chapter.  Remember when you got into a town and
you see one Knight choke another, and then after the first one leaves
and you have to fight the other one in addition to some Black Magicians?
 Apparently, the first one is the leader of the gang and HE is asking
about the whereabouts of the Duke.  Why?  Because the second-in-charge
was responsible for kidnapping the Duke and he Had nothing to do with
it!  Also, the guy that he killed in the cellar right before you saved
the duke is the second-in-charge.  So why si this part important? 
Because it makes Ramza doubt his own ground.  He is starting to think
that maybe, just maybe, he is on the wrong side!  What I jsut love about
the FF series is how deep the storyline is...  In FFT, you repeatedly
see this internal conflict within Ramza as he asks "Why does there have
to be War", or "Why do we have to fight", or "Am I doing hte right
thing?".

    At first, you start off in the present and being a mercenary, you
happened to fall right between Princess Ovelia and a group of people
who want to kidnap her (this is the VERY first battle, where you can only
control yourself and all other allies are "Guests").  Then, after the
battle, you realize that you've been tricked and Ovelia is brought
away from the back door.  However, right before the guy gets away on a
Chocobo, you recognize his face and you start telling the story about
the guy and yourself.

    Chapter 1: You start out as an apprentice swordsman at some sort of
royal institute and the city is being overrun by bandits.  At your side
are your fellow students and a very close friend of yours, Dirita
(recognize his face?  That's cause he's the one who took the princess!).

    After defeating the bandits, you start making your way back home and
on the way, you see another apprentice swordsman being attacked!  Now
you get to choose either to say: "Defeating these bandits is my duty",
or "We've gotta help that guy!"  I'm not too sure what the different
choices do to the plot, but what I AM sure about is that it alters
the "criteria for success" for that mission (one is to kill all
enemies, the other is to rescue the swordsman).

    After you save him (that was the one I chose), he'll tell you that
his name is Argas, and that a duke he's serving is kidnapped by bandits
and he has to go save him...  Afterwards, he joins your party and you
can go home where you'll meet your father on his death bed who tells
you the importance of being honorable. Aruma, your sister, and Teita,
Dirita's sister, urge you two to take care.

    Then you go save the duke, and after you do so, you go home and
get scolded because your brother Daisdarg (who's in charge now) thinks
you're negligent for not doing your duty and going after the duke.
So then you are appointed to get rid of the bandits, and after you do
something (sorry, I can't remember what you do here to carry on the
plot) and go back home, you realize that the bandits have got to your
place and carried off your friend's sister, Teita.

    Afterwards, Argas leaves your party because Dirita is very upset
and Argas commented "what's the big deal, she's only a peasant and
expendable!" (actually, Dirita punched him out).  Then you set
out with Dirita to rescue her sister.  However, after defeating
tons of bandits and arriving at the last bandit who's holding Teita
hostage, your brother Daisdarg and Argas arrived and Daisdarg ordered
Argas to kill both Teita and the bandit (which he did).  Afterwards,
you fight Argas and after you kill him, Dirita goes on the bridge and
cries over Teita.  However, the house explodes and though you're blasted
back, Dirita is engulfed in a ball of fire and disappears. End of 
chapter one.


    Note: A little about Dirita and Argas.  Apparently, Dirita was born a
peasant, however, since the two of you are such good childhood playmates,
your father, a duke of some sort, decided to let both of you attend the
royal academy, and both Aruma and Teita attend the same school as well.

    Understanding that the society is VERY feudalistic and the difference
between the royalty and commonfolk is a HUGE gap, one can see why Argas
called Teita a "peasant" and considered her "expendable".

    Argas, however, was born a royalty, but since his father (or was
it his grandfather) turned out to be a traitor, all was lost and he
had to start all over (which explains why he was so interested in saving
the duke - he wants to prove himself so he can climb back up again).
As a result, he became very power-hungry and didn't care much about
anyone else.

    You start out going after Princess Ovelia and realize that 
Dirita and Ovelia are surrounded by people from your brother 
Daisdarg's army!  After saving Ovelia and Dirita, he puts Ovelia 
in your care and leaves (apparently, he didn't kidnap the
princess, he was just trying to save her).

    Afterwards, you learn of the 12 mythical stones and the legend
surrounding them by saving the mechanic Mustadio.  Entering Mustadio's 
city, you leave Ovelia in the ruler Drakrowa's care and get ready to 
go and find Mustadio's father, Basrodio.  After saving Basrodio, 
obtaining the Tauros stone, and on your way back to Mustadio's city, 
you find Agurias (the Holy Knight that was protecting the princess) 
badly hurt.  You realize what has happened by now (that Drakrowa is 
on the enemy's side) and hear the rumor that they are going to execute 
Ovelia at the execution ground.  When you get there to save her, you 
realize that it was a trap, and Gafgalion, the dark knight who was a 
guest in the first fight, has sided with Drakrowa.

    After defeating those guys, and showing up at Mustadio's city, 
Ramza has to take on Gafgalion one-on-one while everyone else takes
on little guys outside the town gate.  Thankfully, this time you get
to kill him.  When you get inside, you find Drakrowa alone behind
an altar (easy kill, right?  Wrong!).  Unfortunately, he transforms
into a monster called Kyukrein with the "aid" of one of the stones 
he obtained and, well, you've just gotta kill him. After you kill 
him, he reverts to his human self and you take the Scorpio stone 
that he drops. End of chapter two.

Basically the former King's brother Gorutana and the brother of
the former King's "smaller wife" Laak are having wars against
each other for the matter of to who should inherit the throne.
(grammatical er?)  This war is known as the war of the lions since
Gorutana'a army has a symbol of black lion while Laak's army has a symbol
of a white lion.  During the warfare peasants and such are suffering from
heavy taxation and poor harvest and such.  And after the former 50 years
war the former king (forgot his name) held against another country many of
the knights who participated in this war were abandoned by the
royal families because of some reasons that I cannot understand.  So they
formed an "army" themselvs called the "Skull travellers" (rough
translation) and captured a duke in chapter 1.  (Some characters and
events that are involved I cannot comprehend)  Later on Ramza learned that
it was his brother Daisduke's plan to capture the duke with "political" or
"military" reasons, and he thinks his brother is on the wrong path and
that should not be the way of the Beluof family (Ramza's bloodline), so he
deserted the "North Sky" army that his brothers lead and became a
mercenery afterwards with Gabugalian.  Actually Ramza and his sister Elma
do not have the same mother as their brothers Daisduke and Balzak.  That's
why their brothers do not really like them and do not consider Ramza to be
of the pure bloodline.

Then in chapter 2, Ramza learned about the legend of the Zodiac Braves.
In the ancient times twelve warriors seal the dark lord with the twelve
zodiac stones and this became a legend everyone knows about.  Twelve
centuries before a Jesus-like figure in this world called Saint Ajola
appeared like a prophet and many people thought he would save the
corrupted world.  A lord in one of the seven kingdoms was obsessed with
ambitions and he called upon the dark lord Rukavie (?)  Then Saint Ajola
and his twelve disciples used the twelve stones and sealed the demon.
Many people then believed he's the savior and thus the Gravadox religion
is created.  However the priests and such were afraid of Saint Ajola's
authority and his audience so they had to kill him, somewhat like the
Bible story Saint Ajola's thirteenth disciple betrayed him and so he died,
but then again like Jesus he is said to have revived and became one of the
God or God's son :)  Now here's the twist of the story, Ramza, after he
picked up Princess Ovilia from Dilitar, brought her to the Church's
authority (or a priest whose position I cannot understand)  called
Drakrowa.  Then he learned from Basrodio, the engineer whom he saved 
earlier  that another one of the 12 zodiac stones was discovered in 
the engineer's hometown Gook, so Drakrowa asked them to go get it for 
him as the stones may lead the people to peace by the power of God. 
However after Ramza and co retrieve the stone a merchant was out to 
get them and the stone.  He was co-operating with Drakrowa.  
He succeeded by using some nasties and took the stone.  Then Ramza 
knew the princess would be in danger in Drakrowa's hand so he ran 
back to the Church to find Drakrowa gave his body to the spirit of 
the stone and became a demon!  It was at this moment Ramza found out 
that these stones are not "holy", they are evil relics that can bring
the world to destruction!  

So that's it for now.  Whew....  I know I'm missing a lot of stuff and the
translations are not exact.  So now you know the plot has a lot of twists
to it - like what you thought was good turned out to be bad :)

    IMPORTANT! : You can see how much damage an attack is going to do 
 just before confirming it. It will be displayed just above your 
 character's stats. Surprisingly enough, this means that the formula 
 for determining the damage of an attack doesn't have a random factor 
 (except for a few cases) and it will always be the same under the same
 circumstances. 
    You can also see what the chance of success for the attack is, 
 either for physical attacks (they can be evaded) or for the random
 chance ones (instant death, status change, etc...)

    You can also see when an action that requires charge time is going
 to take effect. When selecting the spell, ability or whatever, if
 you press Right over it the Active Turn screen will pop up showing
 the order of the next turns including this action (as if you were
 going to perform it). This can be used in any ability that requires
 charge time excep the Dragon Knight's Jump, as in it you don't
 get to select any ability.


 Training Method by Eugene Shen:

    A word on how to train your characters like crazy: As you know, 
 you'll meet enemies randomly whenever you step on a "Green Dot".
 So what you do is this: First make sure that at least one character in 
 your party has the "steal hearts" thief skill.  Second, make sure that
 you have at least one character who has the healing ability ("Chakra") 
 with the monk. Then, after killing all but one monster, get the thief 
 to repeatedly steal its heart (every successful steal will result in a
 gain of JP and ExP.  Usually, a steal will last 2 to 3 rounds, and 
 the percentage of success is usually above 50%.  As a result, you can 
 almost keep this going indefinitely).  While the monster is "tamed" in 
 this process, get the remaining guys to surround the monk and do 
 special "attacks" to him.
    Examples of the "attacks" are: Poison or direct attack with the black
 magician, decrease mana with the Knight, or whatever other attacks that
 don't hurt him alot.

  (Ignacio's note : I also recomend :

 The Apprentice's "Throw Stone" ability.
 Attacking with Mages and jobs that don't do much damage.
 Using the "Talker" abilities.
 Using any positive status change ability)

 When the knight's turn arrives, get him to use the heal ability
 (also, make sure everyone's on level ground, so everyone gets healed).
 As a result, everyone will gain JP and EXP and you can gain alot of 
 levels without much work.  The only thing is that this is very tiring 
 after a while and really not much fun.  



 Side quests notes by Darren Chan

    When you get to a bar, you can send your characters to do side quests. 
 People sometimes ask you to get rid of monsters or to help them find
 something, so you send three of your characters in a specified number of
 days to do the quest (no battles or events involved), and you have to
 give them money for allowances (?) to do the quest as well.  After the
 completion date you can return to the same bar and ask them to report to
 you.  They will tell you what happened in their quest and finally give
 you what they found in their quest and each of the participating members
 get their JP.  Some special items that cannot be used in battles are
 found by using this method (such as books that you can actually read). 
 Sometimes they may even find new "secret" locations that contain
 interesting stuff.  I've found a town where it is said magical knights
 live there, however this town has not appeared on the map (yet?).  Thus
 I'm not sure whether these places are for real or not (my bet is yes!) 

 As you get more of those treasures that you earn in the side quests
 your reputation as an "adventurer" or "treasure hunter" increases.
 (I don't know what these do to the game though)

  (Ignacio's notes: One day passes for each move you make in the world 
 map. If you want the time to go faster, you can always find two 
 adjacent blue spots and go from one to the other repeatedly (great
 way to reproduce your monsters, by the way). On the other hand, it
 is unknown if finishing the game in more or less days will have 
 negative consequences, and you could use this time to train your 
 other characters)


 Job System notes by Darren Chan:

    Each time your character earns his JP it goes into his current job's
 total JP no matter what he did, (e.g.  A knight casting a white spell -
 the resulting JP still goes to the job knight) and 1/6 of this JP goes
 to the total JP of the same job to the other characters (e.g. A knight
 gets 36 JP - all other characters in battle get 6 JP for thier job
 knight)
    I found that even if one of your character can't change to one
 particular job yet, s/he can still get the 1/6 JP earned by allies for
 that job.  The JPs will show up after you can change to that job :)


 Auto-potion trick by Oscar Ramos:

    Auto-potion is the item user's reaction ability. It works this way:
 when the character with this ability is damaged, he/she has a very high
 chance (80-90%) of using the lowest grade potion you have, i.e. 
 he/she will use a regular potion if you have one, and if not he/she 
 will try to use a Hi-Potion or a X-Potion in that order of 
 preference. By now you may have realized the cheat: dispose of all 
 Potions and Hi-Potions and buy plenty of X-Potions (they heal 150 HP 
 and cost only 300 gil), and that character will be almost inmortal.
    This may spoil the fun of the game, and I myself (Ignacio) have 
 decided not to use it except in desperate situations.



    There are five FMV sequences that can be seen from the begining:
 The intro to the main menu, the "New Game" intro, and three others
 that can be seen just by waiting at the main menu screen (the one
 with New Game, etc...).

    There is a screen saver for the Demo Disk that comes with the game.
 If you don't do anything for quite a long time (around three minutes)
 in the screen where you have to select which demo you want to play, 
 you will see it.

   If you have something to contribute (especially translations of these
 missing Kanji), please help me by sending it to delucas@hotmail.com.
