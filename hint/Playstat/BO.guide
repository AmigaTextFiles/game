1.General Tips

1. When you enter a new town search every house. There you      
   can find nifty items.
2. When you get the option to fly to the next dungeon, walk     
   instead. There could be important items or spells on the     
   way to the dungeon.
3. If you're almost dead, use a heart of darkness while you're  
   alive instead of when you're dead. That way you'll get more  
   blood.

--------------------------------------------------------------

2.Spells

Sanctuary   : This spell returns Kain to his crypt. Use this    
              spell when you're low on HP.

Light       : Illuminates the whole area for a short period of  
              time.

Energy Bolt : Fires an energy bolt, which is very usefull. It   
              isn't very strong, thouch.


Repel       : I think this is the best spell in the game. It    
              protects Kain with an energy shield, making him   
              invulnerable for a short period of time. Even to  
              poison. I recommend using this spell very often.  
              It's very usefull when fighting bosses, and       
              enemies with poisonous attacks

Inspire Hate: Causes enemies to attack themselves instead of    
              Kain. Very usefull with lots of enemies around    
              you. 

Stun        : Stuns enemies with one blow, making it very easy  
              for Kain to feed on them.

Incapacitate: Stops an enemy in his tracks for a short period   
              of time.

Control Mind: With this spell Kain can take over any HUMAN      
              mind until the body dies.

Blood Gout  : With this spell, Kain can drain blood from his    
              enemy, without even hitting him. Be carefull      
              though, you musn't use this spell on enemies      
              who's blood is green. Always check the blood      
              before using this spell.

Blood Shower: Same as Blood Gout, but drains blood over a       
              larger area striking all the creatures in that    
              area.

Spirit Death: A projectile, which seperates the soul from the   
              body leaving your enemies dead.

Lightning   : Summons lightning to hit enemies. This spell      
              must be used outdoors.

Spirit Wrack: Same as Control Mind, but this spell allows Kain  
              to control a creature's Spirit.

Spell                        Location
--------------------------------------------------------------
Santuary                     Kain's Mausoleum
Light                        Shrine of Light
Energy Bolt                  Energy Shrine

--------------------------------------------------------------

3.Items

Heart of Darkness  : When Kain has died, this item brings him   
                     back to life, with a small amount of       
                     blood. When Kain is alive, it gives him a  
                     larger amount of blood.

Flay               : Blades, which track their enemies down,    
                     stripping the skin of their bodies

Implode            : Causes an enemy to shrink, crushing every  
                     bone in it's body.

Slow Time          : Causes enemies to move more slowly. 

Font of Putrescense: Dissolves enemies into a poisonous pool.

Energy Bank        : This item lets Kain use unlimited amount   
                     of Magic for a short period of time.       
                     After that period, Kain magic bar will be  
                     completely empty.

Pentalich of Tarot : A random mixture of 5 interesting deaths.

Anti-Toxin         : Cures Kain of green blood, which is        
                     poisonous. 
--------------------------------------------------------------

4.Equipment


ARMORS

Iron Armor  : This is the armor you begin with. It has no       
              special powers, but offers the most protection    
              against damage.

Bone Armor  : This armor isn't very strong, but because you     
              look like a skeleton, lower undead lifeforms      
              won't attack you that fast.

Chaos Armor : This armor also isn't strong, but causes some     
              enemies to receive the blows as well.

Flesh Armor : This armor is the weakest. It automatically       
              drains the blood of slain enemies. Watch out for  
              green coloured blood!

Wraith Armor: At night, this is the strongest armor. In day     
              light, it's useless.


Armor                        Location
--------------------------------------------------------------
Iron Armor                   Start
Bone Armor                   Tunnels of Coorhagen
Chaos Armor                  Vorador's Mansion
Flesh Armor                  Dark Eden
Wraith Armor                 Avernus' Cathedral


WEAPONS

Iron Sword  : This is strong weapon. It is also quick, but it   
              is not the strongest weapon.

Spiked Mace : With this weapon Kain can strike two blows in a   
              row. The second one stuns an enemy, so Kain can   
              feed.

Axes        : These are very strong. Push the button once and   
              Kain will stike one time. Hit the button twice    
              and Kain will strike two times. Hit it several    
              times and he will strike several times. And if    
              you go beserk on the button, Kain will go beserk  
              too. You can't use a spell or items while using   
              the axes.

Flame Sword : Use this blade to burn your foes. It's stronger   
              than the iron sword, but when you've burned your  
              enemies, you can feed on their blood.


Soul Reaver : This is the strongest weapon, altrough not the    
              best. This blade tears the soul of an enemy       
              apart. The two bad things of this weapon are,     
              that it's two-handed and it uses magic points.    
              The stronger the foe, the more magic points it    
              uses.

My favorite weapon is definitely the flame sword. I know you 
can't drain blood, but if you play well, you won't need to.


Weapon                        Location
--------------------------------------------------------------
Iron Sword                    Start
Spiked Mace                   Nupraptor's Retreat
The Axes                      Malek's Bastion
Flame Sword                   Flame Dungeon
Soul Reaver                   Avernus' Cathedral

--------------------------------------------------------------


5.Forms


Bat     : This form allows Kain to travel to specific placs of  
          Nosgoth, where he has been ready. This could be a     
          dungeon, town or landmark. Kain can't use bat form    
          in a dungeon.

Wolf    : With this form Kain moves a lot faster and can jump   
          over obstacles. When fight however, he is very slow.

Disguise: At first Kain has the diguise as a peasant. With      
          this disguise he can talk to normal people. The form  
          can be upgraded to "Beguile", giving him a look of    
          nobility.


Mist    : This form allows Kain to move over water, through     
          some doors and cracks in walls. This form needs the   
          most amount of magic points to contain.


Form                          Location
--------------------------------------------------------------
Bat                           North/west of Energy Bolt Shrine

6.Special places of Nosgoth


Mooncaves             : These cave only open when the moon is   
                        full. As soon as dawn breaks they       
                        close. When you're walking in a         
                        mooncave and the sun is coming up, it   
                        closes when you leave the cave.

                        if you sacrifice a bit of your own      
                        blood. These caves can often be found   
                        in a mooncave.

8.THE BOSSES


Below is a list of bosses throughout the game. 



1. Name    : Nupraptor the Mentalist
   Location: Nupraptor's Retreat.
   Fighting: Nupraptor the Mentalist attack by shooting         
   Way to :  The row of energy balls he fires at you consists   
   defeat    of green balls and two purple balls. The green     
             balls don't fade , but the purple ones do. At      
             this point walk through the row and move slowly    
             towards Nupraptor. When you reach Nupraptor,       
             you'll be able to hit him once. Then he will       
             teleport to the other side. Do the same thing      
             again. After you hit him  about 5 times, he will   
             teleport to the center. Now you need one hit to    
             kill him. Just walk up to him and give him a good  
             slash with your iron sword.   
     

2. Name    : Malek the Damned Warrior 
   Location: Malek's Bastion
   Fighting: Malek fights with a Polearm. He walks around very       
   Way to  : To defeat Malek equip the iron sword, Now hit him  
   defeat    four times in a row (pushing attack button rapid-  
             ly). He'll fall to the ground (if he doesn't, hit  
             him another four times). Every time he stands up   
             he will shoot two homing energy projectiles and    
             three straight ones (diagonal and vertical).       
             After that, he will continue to walk around        
             trying to hit you.  When you've hit him three      
             times to the ground, he will go to the center of   
             the area and fire a very destructive energy        
             wave. The only thing you can do now is flee to     
             the south/east corner.  


3. Name    : Bane  
   Location: Dark Eden
   Fighting: Since Bane is a wizard of Nature he turns land     
   Way to  : The fact that Bane turns land into water isn't a   
   defeat    problem, because you could change to mist. But     
             when you're in mist form, you can't do anything    
             else. So I suggest you take out Bane as fast as    
             you can. First equip the flame sword. Then use     
             the repel spell to reflect Dejoule's energy        
             bolts. The only thing you have to do is hit Bane   
             a lot of times and he will die.   


4. Name    : Dejoule
   Location: Dark Eden
   Fighting: Dejoule doesn't do much really. She just stands    
   Way to  : After you killed Bane, it's Dejoule's turn to      
   defeat    die. Dejoule is the easiest boss to defeat. Again  
             use the repel shield and walk to the edge of the   
             land so that you can see her. Now you can either   
             throw flay's or energy bolts. If you haven't got   
             enough flay's, throw energy bolt and if you        
             haven't got enough magic power for that either go  
             stand in the east near the door to the teleporter  
             and wait until you have enough magic power. Just   
             keep throwing one of the two at Dejoule's shield.  
             which will disappear and keep throwing until you   
             hit her. After a few hits, she will die as well. 


5. Name    : Azimuth the Planer
   Location: Avernus' Cathedral  
   Fighting: Azimuth summons two Demons at the time to kill     
   Way to  : First use the repel shield against her homing      
   defeat    energy bolts. Then equip the soul reaver, which    
             you have by now and make sure you magic bar is     
             completely filled. Don't waste your magic power    
             on the demons Azimuth summons, when you kill them  
             she just summons two more. Walk to Azimuth inste   
             ad, and with a full magic bar one good blow would  
             be enough to slay her. If you're to slow she will  
             teleport to the other side. Just try again and     
             again until you hit her. When she's dead kill the  
             two demons. There shouldn't be any problems        
             killing them.      


6. Name    : Elzevir the Dollmaker
   Location: Dollmaker's Mansion
   Fighting: Elzevir fights quite the same as Azimuth, but he
   Way to  : The way to defeat him also is the same as Azi      
   defeat    muth. The only differince between the two is that  
             you need a lot more that one magic bar to kill     
             Elzevir with the soul reaver.                   


7. Name    : William the Just
   Location: William the Just's Stronghold
   Fighting: William the Just is one of the hardest enemy 
   Way to  : What can I say. Use the repel shield a keep        
   defeat    hitting him with as much as you 've got. The soul  
             reaver works, well, but you need to fill you're    
             magic bar. The flame blade would be better,        
             because you can use magic while being equiped      
             with it. When you've defeated him a bunch of       
             gaurds will attack you, but with the repel shield  
             on, they can't harm you.     


8. Name    : Mortanius
   Location: The Pillars
   Fighting: Mortanius isn't that hard to defeat
   Way to  : Put on a repel shield (as soon as you have this    
   defeat    shield use it very often) and hit Mortanius with   
             the soul reaver or flame sword.


9. Name    : The Dark Entity 
   Location: The Pillars 
   Fighting: The Dark Entity uses his own body to attack.
   Way to  : For the last time use the repel shield. When the   
   defeat    Dark Entity comes up, you won't get hit. Now       
             strike him as many times as you can untill it      
             drops back in the earth. The flame sword and the   
             soul reaver are the best weapons you can use to    
             fight him.  

--------------------------------------------------------------

11.Secrets                     


Location                  Secret
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Shrine of Light  - At the entrance, walk right and walk in   
                      the south-east corner. A wall will open   
                      giving you a Ancient Vile.
2. Shrine of Light  - Almost at the end of the dungeon you'll   
                      see a pillar, with a red glow around it.  
                      It's a swith, which opens the two door    
                      at each side.

4. Cemetary         - East of the small shrine near the Mauso   
                      leum, there can be found a flay. Use

5. Cemetary         - Same as secret 4, but walk south and      
                      take the vial of blood.
6. Small Shrine     - In the shrine you'll find two small       
                      boulders lying in two symbols of blood.   
                      Push the boulders of their swithes        
                      (you'll need increased strenght) and a    
                      secret door will open to you south/east.
7. Nupraptor's      - After the four tests, at the first        
   Retreat            crossing, go south and push the lever,
