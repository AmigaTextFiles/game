     o Now, in order to open the 5 gates, you must find 5 levers
       which are scattered & hidden throughout the inner city.
       Search the homes & battle the monsters.
     o After opening all 5 gates, head to the center core of the 
       tower.  
     o You will be contronted by General SALBADO's troops.
       Prepare for battle.
     o A sequence will follow.
     o Upon meeting CHONGARA, he will ask you if you are ready to
       board the Silvernoah & face off against General SALBADO.
  
          Top Choice: You are ready to go.
       Bottom Choice: Wait - you have something else you want to do.
     
       If you choose the bottom choice & decide to hold off for awhile, 
       you will be given another set of choice:
  
          Top Choice: Return to the rural town of Kuzu.
       Bottom Choice: Board the Silvernoah & visit a different land.

    !! NOTE: Once you head into the core of 
             the Romania crystal tower, there is no turning back...

100. [ROMANIA: THE FINAL JOURNEY WITHIN...]
 
    o A sequence will take place.
    o Leave the Silvernoah and battle your way through the depths     
      of the dark tower crystal. 
    o You will eventually come across a huge hallway with six  
      separate rooms.  6 of your characters must go into each of 
      these rooms.

      1.) ARC:  Arc will confront Kukuru (or so it seems).  
                Choose the second choice and prepare to fight.
      2.) POCO:  Poco will confront his childhood bullies. 
                 Choose the second choice & prepare to fight.
      3.) TOSH:  Tosh will confront his brother.  Prepare to fight.
      4.) IGA:  Iga will confront his pupils from his temple.
                Prepare to fight.
      5.) GOGEN:  Gogen will confront his old friends from Sumaria.
                  Choose the second choice & prepare to fight.
      6.) ELK: Elk will confront Mirirel.  Prepare to fight.

    o Proceed up through the corridors.
    o You will eventually come across a room with 4 separate rooms 
      & a crystal in the middle of the room.  Battle through each 
      room.  
    o After battling your way through all 4 rooms, search the crystal.
      A new path will be revealed.
    o You will finally encounter General SARUBADO!
      
      NOTE: Be prepared - General SARUBADO will extremely tough.
            He will have 2,200 hps, and his mechanical/crystal 
            minions will inflict quite a bit of damage as well.
            Use your healer frequently to stay alive. 
            Try not to group all your characters in a single spot, 
            as General SARUBADO's attacks has a wide range. 
  
101. [THE FINAL CONFRONTATION]
    
    o A sequence will follow. 
    o The scenery will switch over to KUKURU. 
      Using KUKURU, prepare to fight the evil spirit boss. 
    o Switching back to the character party, prepare to face 
      off against the final boss of the game.  
 
      NOTE: For the 1st round, the final boss will pack over 4,000
            hps and will unlease a few devastating spells here & 
            there.  Attack him without spells as best as you can, 
            for you still have another round with him!
 
            As with the final round, the final boss will reveal his 
            true form, and will pack 9,999 hps, not to mention 
            unlimited amounts of magic points to unlease his 
            devastating magic spells!  Keep your distance & DO NOT 
            have your characters formed in a single group.  Have them
            spread out, and not too close to the boss.  Keep your 
            healers handy & alive at all costs, or else you will be 
            dead before you even realize it. 

     o And with the power of all 5 elements, ARC strikes the final, 
       fatal blow upon the evil spirit!  
     o As the sequence rolls on by, showing the devastation caused 
       by the upbringing of the evil spirit, ARC & KUKURU's 
       spirits bids farewell to the rest of the characters....
       ...ending this truly tragic yet dramatic quest 
          of Arc's epic saga...
