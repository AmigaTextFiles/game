Final Fantasy VII Manual
From http://www.phosphors.com

The town of Makon is under the tight grip of Shin-Ra, the infamous conglomerate. The
Shin-Ra Electric Power Company has been exploiting the life force of the planet,
destroying its precious nature. 
Meanwhile, the underground rebel force with a mission, Avalanche, managed to blow up
Makon Furnace No. 1. Their goal is to destroy Shin-Ra and stop their atrocities. It turned
out that Cloud, one of the former Shin-Ra soldiers, helped the explosion. 
Can just a handful of brave soldiers save the life of the planet? Shin-Ra is much too big an
enemy to fight against. 

THE FATE OF THE PLANET IS ON THIS BATTLE. 


Starting the Game 

   For First-Time Players 
Press the OPEN button on the PlayStation console and open up the CD-ROM holder.
Insert the first disk of the FINAL FANTASY VII CD-ROMs and close the holder. Turn on the
power. The DEMO screen appears, and you are now ready to play. Press the  button, an
a choice of NEW GAME or CONTINUE appears. 

Use the up/down direction buttons to move the finger-icon cursor to the NEW GAME
command. Press the  button to execute. You are now starting the game. To save your
adventure, keep a memory card (sold separately) in a card slot. See Page 33 for the data
saving procedure. 

   Continuing the Game from Saved Data 
Put the CD-ROM used in your previous game and insert the memory card with the data in
the PlayStation console. Turn on the power. Move from the DEMO screen to a selection of
NEWGAME or CONTINUE. Select CONTINUE. 

When the Load screen appears, select the card slot (SLOT 1 or 2) where the memory
card is inserted. Use the up/down direction buttons and press the button to execute. 

On the File Select screen, select the data file to continue your adventure. If you cannot load
the saved data this way, keep the power on, and remove and re-insert the memory card. 

   Notes on Changing the Disk During the Game 
Final Fantasy VII comes on three CD-ROMs. As you move along in your adventure,
beautiful graphic images will prompt you to "Change disk to Disk No...(CD-ROMs are
numbered 1 through 3)." Press the OPEN button on the PlayStation console to open the
holder and place the specified CD-ROM. Close the holder and press the  button to
continue the adventure. The image changes randomly each time this prompt screen
display appears. 


Characters 
Your character will meet friends or other people who are important in your adventure.
Some of the main characters are introduced below. Beware! Not all of them are friendly. 

Cloud Strife 
21 years old. A former soldier of Shin-Ra. He is now a member of the rebel force,
"Avalanche," and is getting involved in battles that would decide the fate of the planet.
There is nothing that his sword would not destroy. 

Aerith Gainsborough 
22 years old. A beautiful woman with a mysterious atmosphere. She met Cloud when she
was selling flowers in Midgul, and now she plays an important role in Cloud's adventure.
She is better at magic attacks than attacking with weapons. 

Tifa Rockheart 
22 years old. A beautiful woman with a mysterious atmosphere. She met Cloud when she
was selling flowers in Midgul, and now she plays an important role in Cloud's adventure.
She is better at magic attacks than attacking with weapons. 

Barett Wallace 
35 years old. The leader of "Avalanche." His overwhelming power and a gun especially
made for him would destroy anything. He lost his wife in the past and now lives with his
little daughter, Marine. 

Red XIII 
Age unknown. Sex unknown. Red XIII has decidedly red fur and looks threatening, but has
an intelligence level that is well beyond that of humans. The only thing know about Red XIII
is that it attacks the enemy with its claws and fangs. A very mysterious beast. 

Cid Hiwind 
32 years old. A pilot who dreams like a boy. In the sky or on the water, no one steers better
than him. He is dreaming of traveling the endless starry sky. A man always willing to face
danger with a lance in his hand. He also has an amazing knowledge of mechanics. 

Sephiroth 
He was also a Shin-Ra soldier, and Cloud was under him. Only Shin-Ra's confidential files
know his past. He was one of the best soldiers there. His long sword has an incredible
power, and he is the only one who can use it. No one knows where he is now. 

Yuffie Kisaragi 
16 years old. She is a member of a Ninja family with long history, but she does not care
much about it. She decided to join Cloud's party only because she wanted to get
"something." She is a clever, selfish girl, but plays an important role in battles by using her
Ninja tricks and skills. 

Cait Sith 
Age unknown. No one knows where he is from. The way he talks lets us guess that he is a
male being. He gives life to the fat stuffed animal of Moogle and rides its back. His attacks
during the battles are worth seeing; it is as though everything in a toy box were coming out.
Fortune telling is his hobby, but what he says is never reliable. 

Vincent Valentine 
27 years old. A guy with a dark, mysterious atmosphere. It seems that the past relation
with Shin-Ra is making him travel with Cloud and others. It is known that his slim body
possesses some kind of amazing power and abilities.

Field Screen Operation 
Your adventure takes place on a 3D field  the first time ever in the series. Final Fantasy
VII offers stages that you can move about so freely that you would think you are really going
around the world! You will be surprised to see how viewing angles change; this surely will
remind you of a real movie. Here on the Field screen, you can move your characters, enter
their names, make your character talk with townspeople, or enjoy events and games. 

   World Map Screen 
As the adventure goes on, you will see the World Map screen shown in the picture. You will
also see a small Game Map at the bottom right corner of the screen. The  shows the
direction that your character is facing and sight range, the red dot is where the character is
now. The  shows where the towns or villages are. The small map enlarges when the Start
or Select button is pressed. Pressing the same button again removes the map from the
screen. Select the same button once again to see the small map. 

   Entering Names 
You are able to name the characters when your character first meets friends. Select from
Hiragana, Katakana, and English Alphabets at the left bottom of the screen to give them
names with. Use either the L1 or R1 button to select. Select the letters with the direction
buttons and input them using the  button. Select "Space" to enter a space, and "Delete"
to delete unnecessary letters. Select "Execute" when you are finished, or select "Default"
to go back to the default settings. 

   Selecting Messages for Dialogue 
Final Fantasy VII offers you a change to select response or reaction when your character
is talking with people. Use the up/down direction buttons to select the response or reaction
you wish. 

   Using Shops and Inns 
The world is full of shops and inns of all kinds. You can go for groceries to prepare for the
next adventure or relax at the inn (See Page 8 for operation). At shops, your character can
sell weapons or items. The following is just a few examples of the shops in the world. 

   Inn 
   Stay overnight to regain the HP and MP of all the members of the party. The damage
   received during the combat will be completely healed here. Different inns have
   different rates. 

   Weapon Shop 
   Sells weapons and armors for the characters. 

   Item Shop 
   Sells various items such as "recovery" and "attack." 

   Accessory Shop 
   Sells accessories that give your character special effects. 

   Materia Shop 
   Sells jewelry called Materia that has special effects when attached to a weapon.
   Note that your character cannot buy multiple Materias at once. 

   Beginner's Shop 
   It is located on the second floor of the Weapon Shop at 7 Slum Street. This is not
   really a shop, but your character can talk to the people there and obtain information
   on this game. 


   Events & Games 
Some of the events require the controller operation. For example, there is a Barrel Throw
and sports events. Pay attention to the messages on the screen before you start. Although
there is no special controller operation, some events have time limits. If you need to quit,
save data and finish (See Page 33 for Saving) , or press Start button to pause. 

Combat Screen Operation 
The Combat screen of Final Fantasy VII is described below. 

   Battle messages. 
   The party member. The  points to the character whose commands are available. 
   The enemy character. 
   Press the Select button during the combat to see the Help Window. It explains the
commands and shows the names of the enemy monsters. 
   Names of the party members, barrier gauge, and the mabarrier gauge. Press the 
button to see the gauge that is behind the Command Window. At the beginning of combat,
the barrier and mabarrier gauges are empty. By attaching the "Barrier" Materia, your
character can chant a magic word to reduce the damage in half. The barrier and mabarrier
gauges fill up each time you chant the magic, and their protective power lasts until the
gauge is reduced to 0. Barrier guards from the physical attacks, and Mabarrier from the
magic attacks. It will be a good idea to chant this when fighting against the Boss-level
enemies (See Page 21 for Materia). 
   The commands available during the combat. Depending on how many Materias your
character has, the commands available varies. 
   The numbers that pop up from the enemy of the party during the combat shows damage
in white, and HP and MP recovered in green. 
   The Status Window to show the status of the party members. From left to right: current
HP left, maximum HP (or the status that have changed), current MP left, and the Limit and
Time gauges. 

    The gauges to show each character's current HP and MP remaining. The gauge is
blue when it is full, but it will turn red as it decreases. 

   Combat Formation 
The enemy appears in the regular combat formation as well as in other formations
described below. Note that the damage will be doubled when attacking the enemy or
being attacked from behind. 

[Initial Attack] 
Enter the commands before you get attacked! This formation really helps your character
and other party members. 

[Back Attack] 
When you are attacked from behind, the front and rear rows switch. Moreover, this always
lets the enemy make an initial attack. This formation, needless to say, is a bad idea for
your character and the friendly force. 

[Side Attack] 
Attack the enemy from both sides. You cannot use the CHANGE command to rearrange
the formation, but this formation works well. 

[Ambush!] 
This formation is just opposite of the Side Attack. When this happens, your party is
exposed to the enemy's initial attack and cannot even run. You can neither attack the
enemy with magic nor change the formation with the CHANGE command. This formation,
therefore, is quite disadvantageous to your force. 


ATB (Active Time Battle) 
Final Fantasy VII employs an ATB (Active Time Battle) system with a flow of time. The
character with a full Time gauge gets to select commands first. Pay attention to how the
enemy makes their move and how the situations change, and select appropriate
commands. 

   Battle Commands 
The following commands in the Command Window vary with the flow of the game and
each character. 

[FIGHT] 
Attack the enemy with the weapon your character has. Your character can even attack the
friendly force if desired. The same applies for the MAGIC command. 

[LIMIT] 
The Limit gauge starts to fill up when attacked by the enemy. When full, the gauge begins
to flicker and reaches a condition "Limit Break." When this occurs, the FIGHT command
changes to the LIMIT command. With this command, the character's attack with their own
Limit skill. If the combat is over without using the Limit skill, it will be available in the next
combat. In this case, the command remains LIMIT. Note that the more damage your
character receives, the faster the gauge fills up (See Page 28 for Limit). 

[MAGIC] 
The commands displayed in the window when attaching the Magic Materia onto the
weapons and armors (See Page 21 for Materia). Select the magic to use after selecting
the command, and decide whom it is going to be used against. For instance, select the
enemy when using the Attack Magic, and the member of the party when using the
Recovery Magic. The amount of MP reduced will not be different between the Unit Magic
and the All Magic, which uses the "Select All" Materia (a red arrow appears after the name
of the All Magic). The magic that is not available is displayed in gray. 

[ITEM] 
Use the combat items which allow your character to attack or recover. After selecting an
item, decide whom it is going to be used against. Select the enemy if using the Attack
item, and select a friend when using the Recovery item (See Page 19 for Item). 

[CHANGE] 
The command that appears when you press left at the left side of the Battle Command
Window. This command allows you to switch the front and rear rows of the combat
formation. Characters located in the rear will receive less damage, but their attack power
will be reduced. Characters in the front row will have the opposite advantage and
disadvantage. Note that this rearranged formation will be canceled in the next combat
(See Page 27 if you wish to keep the rearranged formation). 

[DEFENSE] 
The command that appears when you press right at the right side of the Battle Command
Window. This command reduces the damage received from the enemy in half. 

[RETREAT] 
The party will run away from the combat if you press the L1 and R1 buttons at the same
time. Note that some enemies or formations will not allow your party to retreat. 

   Other Commands 
As the adventure goes on, your character will obtain a number of Materias. Some of which
will add commands that can be used during the combat. They are, for example, Summon,
Enemy Skill, and Steal to name but a few. These commands are available for the
characters with these particular Materias attached (See Page 21 for Materia). 

   Ending the Battle 
The combat lasts until your party wins or until all of the members of either group retreat.
When your party wins the battle, your party will obtain money (currency: guill), items, EXP
(Experience), and AP (Ability Points) that will grow Materias (See Page 21 for Materia).
The amount of money, items, EXP, and AP that your party obtains will vary with the kind
and number of the enemy. 

   Game Over 
The game is over when all of the party members are incapable of fighting or petrified.
Press the [circle] button if you wish to play again. The screen will ask whether you wish to
play a NEW GAME or to CONTINUE. Select NEW GAME if you do not have any saved
data, and select CONTINUE if you do (See Page 5 for Loading, Page 33 for Saving). 

   Status Change During the Battle 
The status of the attacked character will change as seen below. Most of them can be
cured by "Esna" Magic or "Almighty" medicine. However, a status such as Critical, Can't
Fight, Anger, and Sadness need particular magic or an item to heal. All of the changes in
status can be recovered by using the inns or tents. The following are just a few of the
abnormal statuses. 

     Name

Shows the items your character has that are important in the adventure.

[MAGIC] 
This command allows your character to use magic. After selecting the magic word to
chant, decide on whom to cast the spell. Magic that your character can use is in white; the
rest appear in gray. To chant the magic, you need to have Magic Materia attached to your

button as you select magic, the scroll bar will jump, screen by screen. 

[SUMMON] 
This command shows the name of the magic your character can use and its effects. Your
character needs to have Magic Materia attached to the weapon or armor to use this magic
(See Page23 for Magic Materia). 

[ENEMY SKILL] 
This command shows the skills that your character has learned from the enemy. Your
character needs to have Enemy Skill Materia attached to the weapon or armor to learn
these skills. 

   Additional abilities: 
When your character gains additional abilities by attaching a special Materia such as
"Select All," their effect will be displayed. 

   Materia 
Attach a jewel known as "Materia" onto a hole on a weapon or an armor to obtain various
abilities. Select the MATERIA command if you want to attach Materia or to know its effect.
Move the finger-icon cursor to the hole on a weapon or an armor, and press the  button
to attach. The Materias shown are those not used by others; so select any Materia and
simply press the [circle] button. To remove the Materia, select the hole where it is attached
and press the  button. 


   Shows the number of holes on the weapons or armors you character is using. 
   Describes the special effect the Materia will have when attached on those holes. 
   Shows the level of the Materia in the hole, AP (ability point), AP until the next level, and
list of abilities and special effects your character can learn. 
   Move the finger-icon cursor to CHECK and press the  button, then you will be able to
find out types of commands and magic which your character can use in a battle as a result
of Materia effect. 
   Move the finger-icon cursor to the hole on the Materia and press the  button. The
Materia your character now has (but yet to be attached to the weapons) and its effect when
attached will be shown. 

AP (ability point) 
Shows your character's current ability point. AP can be obtained when your character win
a battle. When AP reaches a certain level, the level of that Materia becomes higher and
the ability effect powers up. No AP for the Materia that is not attached to a weapon or an
armor. Once your character powers up the Materia, other characters can use it as their
own. Except for a few cases, most Materias reach the Master Level, shown with five stars. 

Ability List 
Shows the ability your character obtains from the Materia. If the name is shown in white, it
is the ability your character can use now. The ability shown in gray cannot be used. 

Gear-Up Effect 
By attaching certain Materias, your character's status such as power, magic power, max
HP or max MP will change. When their levels become higher, they will be shown in yellow;
when the levels become lower, they are shown in red. 

   There are five kinds of Materia  
There are several different kinds of Materia in the game. They can be classified roughly
into the following five categories, depending on the ability they create. 

Independent Materia 
Color - purple. In general, these Materias increase the character's status such as
maximum HP or power. 

Support Materia 
Color - blue. They work only when used with other Materias like "Select All" or "HP Magic."
